morning i believe the presence of the lord is here i wanted to add my thanks to the brothers who helped us with the curves out of the parking lot take a look at that it looks a whole lot better so we're glad to see that and then i need to meet with the deacons and trustees for just a moment in my office after church i won't keep you long but you deacons and trustees if i could meet with you for just a minute and then um on a wednesday night we'll have a special treat brother braden savage will be here with us to preach for us on wednesday so i know you'll enjoy that and try to be here if you can on wednesday night if you're able to be here or to watch the service online and i'm sure it'll be a blessing to you he was working in the area and able to come so i'm glad he's able to do that revelation chapter 5 and verse 3 and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on i want you to take special notice of that this morning no man was worthy to open but no man was worthy to look at it but was open and one of the elders saith unto me we've not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book amen aren't you glad that he did you have prevailed or in other words he has overcome to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof i pray the lord had his blessing to the word you may be seated see my sister becky back there good to see you this morning in laney to have you with us this morning good to have all of you with us this morning i want to speak to you this morning on the subject of who is worthy and maybe take it a little bit differently than what we would normally think about it we know that no one but our lord was worthy to open the book we know the lamb was the only one because they looked all through heaven they looked on the earth they looked back through time and no one was worthy and so he had to there had to come the lamb it was god wrapped in flesh that come down and then he died as the son of god for our sins and and we and he was resurrected on the third day and he overcame he prevailed to open the book and so in his prevailing he loosed the seven seals of the book but how do we find a people that are worthy to look at what was opened that are worthy to see what it was and and so the book had something in it and brother branham calls it a book of redemption he calls it a title deed he calls it a book of names and in the breach brother brown says now the book he said remember is seal he said here is one here it is this seal then another one is wrapped a seal another one was wrapped to seal he said it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and again he says he saw one sitting upon the throne with this book in his hand in his right hand think of it now and then in this book was a title deed and we talked about that how it was the guarantee the abstract title deed to the earth so he said it's a title deed to redemption so it was sealed with seven seals and he says the lamb is the only mediator do we still believe that today the lamb is the only mediator amen see he was the one that came forth and what did he do now he's been back here interceding until his blood has atoned for every person and and which people are that he said and the lamb now knows what's written in the book so he does not take the book brother joe to find out what's written in the book he doesn't take the book take the book so that he'll know the mystery of the book brother branham tells us he doesn't open it for himself but he opens it for us right he takes the book because he's been back here in her seating and he knows what's written in the book he doesn't take it because he doesn't know but he takes it because he does know and he's going to do something so brother brown said so he knowed from the foundation of the world he said their names were in there their names were in there who are their names those were the those who would be redeemable those who would be redeemed that's the book of redemption and so the ones who were redeemable their names were there and so he says that he knew that from the foundation of the world so he stood back there and done mediator work like this he said until immediate mediatorial work till everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed and it's finished right now these seals were broken for a reason for a reason and brother brown explains that he said the seals was broke why he said in the last church ages to reveal these last church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride so the reason why he did it was to get us we could say it that way to claim us amen to rapture us the seals had to be broken it tells me the seals had to be broken before the rapture not after the saints rise but the seals were broke before the rapture amen and so now he said he wants to bring his subjects he said he wants to bring his subjects to him now and that's what he's doing we're drawing he wants to bring us to the word now so we can go at home with him so this is the hour when we are drawing close to him drawing close to the word he's done that in our in our hearts and our souls but there's coming a time of full redemption when these bodies are changed as well so brother brown says talk about a happy time when them seals broke john must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time now notice he said john looked in and seen past the curtain of time and said there is john now that kind of lays the background for where i want to go today because as he said who is worthy to open the book and to look thereon well john must have been worthy right john must have been worthy who is john in the book of revelation john is the type of the bride so there must have been a worthiness that was placed on him that wasn't there before right because he wept with the rest of them because there was no one worthy and john wept and the elder said don't weep john because the lion of the tribe of judah had prevailed so he was just like the rest of them he was standing there without any hope without any here the whole book everything he said brother robert said he knew everything would be lost the earth and everything on it would be destroyed because because that was the title deed to redemption but now because the book was open he's able to look amen he was found worthy to look what happened a lamb john was worthy because the lamb was worthy don't ever forget that you're only as worthy as your lamb is you're only as worthy as your husband is when you're the bride of christ you're only as worthy as christ and nothing we can do can change that you're only as worthy as he is no matter what you've done no matter how many times you go to church how well you pay your tithe those things are things that christians do but but you're never more worthy than your lamb and nothing that you've ever done could ever take the place he he gives you he imputes his worthiness to you oh my aren't you glad that he did that for us today he imputes his worthiness to us he credits it to us so imputation is a credit it's like if you had a bank account and the and the bank account was empty and maybe overdrawn and you didn't have a way to do it and i walked up there one day and and put fifty thousand dollars in your bank account what would you do it was imputation you didn't do anything you didn't deserve it you the one that run it in the red but somebody credited to your account and so his holiness was credited to us his righteousness was credited to us his worthiness was credited to john so john can now take the book and look at it see his name in it aren't you glad for the word this morning no man was worthy but now john could look and so we feel unworthy but you're only as unworthy as your lamb is what does that say about the lamb now brother branham takes this a little further and he says you know we're not seeing actual names there he says it this way the book doesn't say now lee vale is to be saved in the time of this church age or arma neville or whoever no it don't say that it just shows the mystery it shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is we ourselves by faith believe it no matter how many times you read it and you look at it and you listen to the tapes you can go in and look at the opening of the word all these things you're never going to hear him say your name right unless you happen to be there and we're called out in the prayer lines or he was your friend or something like that but you're never going to hear him just say armand neville's in the book ben pruitt's in the book right whatever your name is you're in the book you're never going to hear him say that but by faith you believe it why because there's an identification there something about it amen something about the opening of the word and this is why we don't want to attract the people's attention by anything else we don't want to attract the people's attention by pencil or even by by miracles and signs those those things go along with the opening of the word but we attract the people's attention by the word because it is the word that changes us it's the word that makes us worthy amen and it's the word that shows us who we are now so brother battle says it just shows the mystery unfolds it but we ourselves by faith believe it someone said now and this is a continuation of the same quote so brother ryan was continuing in his thought he said someone said well there is no need in me trying it brother branham said there's only one be saved out of jeffersonville he said now see it's showing a parable that's where people misunderstand things that brother branham said he said it's showing a parable that isn't it there might be thousands saved he said i don't know i hope every one of them is saved but i don't know but here's the way i want to believe it i'm that one amen and then he says you believe the same for you because they thought well if brother branham said there'd be one in jeffersonville and he's there then where does that leave everybody else we know he's a prophet so that just leaves everybody else listen the devil can give you any excuse in the world to try to make you think you can't make it but you can make it if you want to make it right and so he said there might be thousands he said you believe the same for you if you don't then there's something wrong with your faith you're not sure what you're doing now notice how he takes this and he says he he takes it to his own ministry he said how can you walk up there in the face of death when you're not too sure whether you're saved or not he talks about when you die and then he says how can you go down here and say to this crippled man laying here blinded and twisted up thus saith the lord rise up jesus christ makes you whole you say well i could never say that what peter and john did they said look on us and they said rise up and and be whole and and what was that doing that they something inside of them inspired them to that it wasn't just them saying it but there was inspiration there and when they saw it it was thus saith the lord they believed it so he said you have to know what you're talking about because you go say that to somebody that just like the pentecostals do today just tell everybody that and thus saith the lord thus saith the lord well if it's not true you're a false prophet right but if you have inspiration of that and you know that it's true it won't be just a feeling but it's it's you know that it's true he said you better know what i have to know what you're talking about you say he said well say death claims everything it's all gone yeah he said but when the word of god is revealed i think i skipped over the second part of that yeah he said how can you stand go back to that part before i'm sorry he said how can you stand that old cold stiff body laying there that's dead and been dead for hours and hours and laying there cold and stiff and say thus saith the lord rise up to your feet brother makes the bold statement that if abra if if god told him if the angel lord told him that abraham lincoln would rise from the dead he'd call the newspapers and tell them and he'd gather all around abraham lincoln's grave because he believed it would take place he said but god hasn't told me that right he could only do what god told him and jesus said the same thing but here he said how can you stand that old cold stiff body laying there instead been dead for hours and hours laying there cold and stiff and say thus saith the lord rise up to your feet you better he said you have to know what you're talking about well say death claims everything it's all gone yeah but when the word of god is revealed and you know it's god that changes things right so if you keep it all as a whole he's saying you won't see your name there but it's a revelation it's a revelation the same kind of revelation that brother branham or someone else would have to get in order to raise up a dead person i hope you're with me this morning see we're going to have to have that kind of a revelation about what we believe because these bodies have to change so there's going to have to be a people who are sure they're positive that they're going to make it they're positive that they're going in the rapture they're not worried that satan might be able to thwart it or take it out but there's got to be a people and that's why i believe these things were revealed in this hour we predestination election and all these things he taught he says you're the gene seed of god you can't die anymore then god could die how could how could we ever believe those things we believe it because it's who we are and he tells us that in this hour because we've got to be the ones to take this old dead body one thing to speak to a dead body in the casket and say rise up that's been dead for hours and hours but we've got to be able to save this old dead body rise up from dead denominations increase and one day you're going to speak or you hear me today church you're going to speak and it'll be the last time and all of a sudden things will change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you go into a new body what is it it's something inside of you you're positive you have the earnest of it today you know just like john john could rejoice because he looked there and said there's john and we can rejoice and say that's me mama that's me like the little boy in the mirror now he said well say death claims everything it's all gone yeah but when the word of god is revealed and you know it's god that changes things that's right what makes you worthy what makes you worthy to be able to do that to be able to look and see that you're redeemed to partake in that redemption and no one was worthy but john looked how was he able to look at it now we know that if you're a seed of god you always were a seed of god you didn't become one when you were saved that seed was was given germination it was given life it came alive but there was always a life just like a seed that you would plant in the ground always a life inside of it it had been recently i've heard that china has been mailing people seeds they don't know what they're for people are getting them in the mail it's true i've seen the packages on some of them they're mailing people seats and they've got chinese writing on them and i guess they think people are just going to go out there and spread them out in their yard and it might be an invasive species or something they don't know what it is why would they have these seeds why is china mailing people in in rural counties and things seeds so they're asking you not to plant them that's your public service message for today don't plant those seeds but why are they doing that because they expect them to come to life right they expect that somehow the seed will find a way even if whatever it is if it's some company trying to promote themselves or if it's some if it's a chinese government trying to a real conspiracy theorist you could say well it's the government trying to spread these wild seeds all over the country and try to invasive species and kill our crops it could be we don't know but what it is they expect that seed to come up and it won't come up in the package but when you put it in the right atmosphere it'll come up and that's the way we are as as christians if you put a christian put a a person who's a seed of god but not yet been born again in the right atmosphere that seed will begin to quicken a seed begins to come to life now but if you were a seed of god today you always were a seed of god your name was on the book before time began we know that yet you were born in sin and when you were born i think we misunderstand this we have exactly the same standing as anyone else no we're not the same as everybody else but we have the same standing with god we're enemies to god when we're born whether we're elected or not we're enemies of god we're sons we can be redeemed but we come into the world enemies to god we're born in sin shape and iniquity coming to the world speaking lies all of us are we have that serpent nature but you are different but the difference is not necessarily you know and as i said if you look at worthiness as what you've done and you think back over your life and think well i didn't do as many bad things as this person did that must mean i'm the seed of god i don't know where we get that the truth is you might do more bad things because the seed what the seed does is not just keep you from doing bad things and we watch brother branham's life and we see sometimes how things happen in his life and and you see that and you think well that'll be the way my life is but someone has said that you know brother branham tried to kill himself because he got so uh so upset about his wife dying he tried to try to put a pistol to his head well you might try that and be successful don't go there because you might try that and be successful god was protecting his prophet and god may protect you in very similar ways but he's protecting you for some purpose but but as seed it doesn't mean we can't get that down right and a prophet of god took a rifle and tried to kill a bunch of boys and would have done it but god protected him because he spent the rest of his life in juvenile prison or whatever that it was and we could have never had a message god's protecting he said don't ever smoke drink or defile your body in any way because i got a work to do when you get older we look at that say well that's because he was seed no that's because he was a prophet god had something for him to do god might do that he might keep certain individuals for from certain things so that they can produce something later in their life and but but then others he may let him go through those things right and so you're different but you're different in the way jacob was different jacob was not a better man than esau you know proof of that and questions and answers brother brown says esau was a far better man in every way you wanted to take it than jacob was that's pretty blunt isn't it he was a better man in every way you wanted to take it than jacob was he explains that a little further in the ephesians church he said now both of them was religious but esau when it come to works and these as a good legalist he was probably a better boy all the way around than jacob was he said did you know that jacob was just a little boy that hung around with his mammy all the time but esau got out and worked went out and got venison to give his old blind daddy who was a prophet now think think in message terms about the story of jacob and esau how much better of a message person esau was than jacob was because esau cared for a prophet esau got out and worked huh i'm not those are good things those are things jacob should have done but he didn't do it he saw got out and worked he saw got the deer he was a hunter he was a he would have been a great message person was tough he was a man's man but jacob he says he saw got out and worked he tried to take care of him but jacob only had one thing in mind he wanted that birthright he didn't care how long he had to hang around or whatever he had to do the main thing in his life was the birthright and esau despised it esau was a good man but it wasn't important to him oh i hope you hear me today the word of god has got to be important to you and i think satan is challenging us today with all that we're going through is the word of god important enough to us for us to seek it out is it important enough to us so that we would be immersed in the word of god or do we just spend all of our time doing other things is it important to us now he said the main thing was the birthright and esau despised it in harvest time again brother brown said no esau morally was a better man than jacob but he didn't have respect to his birthright which was the word oh my he could just cross the word not think anything about it what qualified jacob we talk about bride material bride material and that comes from where brother brown talks about there being a lady said like it had some goods she'd take a piece of material and she'd cut out a part of that material and she said that was like the bride and the rest of it he said it's all the same material right you take the materials all all the same but he cuts his bride he chooses out of that material a pattern right for his of his bride and and bride material brother brandon mentions bride material a couple times in the message what it was to be bribed material but never in the context that sometimes we take it to be and we've taken that to be if your bride material you won't do certain things if your bride material you won't you won't go you want you won't fall that so far your flesh is the same as any other flesh the material is all the same the part that qualifies you to be in the bride is the seed no god does work in your life prior to you being born again but jacob wouldn't have been considered bride material he didn't hunt her fish was a mama's boy what qualified him it was a seed it was god's election now look not even the natural seed same parents but look now we know that god allowed your think about this for a moment he allowed your great grandparents to me let's say and farther back than that because he's god he can go all the way back but let's just keep it where we can understand it your great-grandparents met somewhere now you don't know and i don't know your great-grandparents but let's just say mine because i know my family wasn't any good and your great-grandparents might have met in a bar god allowed them to meet there might have been a situation where there was uh and we look at this today people again misunderstand because what brother branham taught it's such an awful sin to cohabitate without marriage it's a horrible thing and when children were produced by that in the old testament they couldn't come in the congregation of the lord brother brown talks about the blood of christ takes care of that right removes that but say your great grandparents you don't know you know there may have been way back there somewhere an illegitimate child an unmarried person that come together and god allowed that to happen he didn't make it happen but he allowed it to happen knew it would happen and caused things to fall a certain way think about that he allowed and we think of this all in the good that god allowed my grandparents to come together and they were good people my great grandparents to come together they were good people and that made me a good person no that's not the purpose of what he's doing he's not producing good people he's bringing the elect to a birth i wish we'd realize that i'm trying to stay out of your your space here trying to distance from you but but you know i wish we'd recognize that god is not looking for good people he didn't come to this church to make us a bunch of good people he didn't bring us here because the baptist can do that the assembly of god can do that there's lots of people out there that can better your life that can teach you how to have a better life that's not what he's doing but why did he bring your great-grandparents together your grandparents together your parents together what did he do it for to bring you to a place of a birth god help us today maybe he had to bring you down to a place where you you just had to understand you were so wicked in order to be saved so he allowed sinners to meet one another and people in an awful family he doesn't just allow the good side but he allows the bad side and you see that in jacob that of all the genes that jacob could have gotten he got the worst ones now if you go back and study their families you'll find out that in isaac and rebecca's family there were certain certain traits that were there and some of those traits were good these were men who start began nations they were great men patriarchs and but they also had some problems so in this family were things you see in esau there was the ability to go out and make way for themselves and do all of these things become a great man financially in this family with all those things but also the things you see in jacob jacob got a double dose of it because god allowed and even drew isaac and rebecca together but there was a strain of cowardice and deception in isaac's family you can go back to abraham and see it in isaac himself and see it abraham lies about his wife twice isaac does it once and it comes on down and but those men were good men they were godly men but that strains in the family and then here on rebecca's side if you look at rebecca's side and find out that that rebecca and come from in her own country was where laban was and you'll find out that in her country and that's where rachel come from that's on that side there were there was manipulation think about it laban was constantly manipulating and and so jacob gets that too you look at rebecca herself she manipulates her own husband to get jacob the blessing so there's a strain of that and it comes out in jacob and jacob is manipulative cowardly and deceptive and he's the worst of the whole bunch because it kind of that gene didn't manifest itself really fully until jacob's time and we talked about gene expression and how that if you take a mouse and you scare the grandfather with the electric shock the grandkids although they've never been shocked to be still scared of that because it's in their genes it's just how they're expressed and but but you take them you take those same mice and put them in a loving family give them a mother and let them be in a loving family those same mice won't express those genes so jacob when he was growing up had problems at home because isaac favored one child and rebecca favored the other one right growing up in the prophet's home but they had problems should give us all of us comfort but they had problems there in the prophet's house they there was a strain of these things in and they come and it seemed like the worst of it come out in jacob now brother brown tells us that he said you were in your great great great grandfather all the way back physically speaking he said then that's what you are in physical being nature sometimes a child would be born in the family red-headed it astonishes the father because there's nobody he knows of his people red-headed or the mothers but if you go back to several generations you'll find out somebody was red-headed that seed keeps coming on down and you come the nature of one from way back so you have a child and you think where did he come from i look at my own children brother on it and i think peter's skinny as a rail and that boy eats constantly some of that's his age it'll catch up to him but i wasn't like i wasn't that skinny when i was that age wasn't built like that at all and and you think where did that come from well maybe his mother what could have come from my side but just way back right and you look at all of our children are different and then you see some of yourself in them and you see things that you never saw in you where did that come from well it come from way back plus how they were raised right because you did raise them you are raising them so that does make a difference so now he said you'll go back several generations you'll find out somebody was redheaded that seed keeps coming on down you come the nature of one from way back and so you have to watch that there's certain traits in your family and some of those things are in our flesh still the new birth does not save the flesh what it does is set a control tower there so that you don't have to do any sin there's a control tower there to keep you from it but if you do sin you have an advocate with god but you won't live in sin because if you live in sin that control tower there's no way that could be there and you just live in sin right it's impossible because that control tower will bring you to repentance so it takes dominion over the flesh but those genes are still there brother charlie cox told a story i remember from his testimony how that he told a story uh he had a problem with how he spoke to his wife none of us have ever had that problem but he had a problem with how he spoke to his wife and he would speak to her in the wrong way and then he wouldn't speak to her for days and it comes from his his fam his family his dad was worse than he was and his grandparents but he didn't realize that and he talks to brother branham about it how how do i overcome this and and brother branham just asking he says well he says that come from way back probably your great-grandparents and he said well how do i get rid of it and brother brad i'm just asking him said how old are you that's all he said never prayed for him never talked to him anymore i just said how old are you and the reason was because brother charlie being a saved man a born again believer and i believe you are this morning if you're a born-again believer then as time goes on you'll overcome that brother charlie said his testimony was that he did but there's things that just the way you are and it helps us kind of deal with other people too you got to have love for somebody that's different because you're just not going to think like they do that's why marriage is so hard right because you you're not going to think like somebody else huh and maybe years later you get to where and brother danny was talking to me how that you guys think alike you know and sometimes you can kind of read each other's minds and and and that's what he said sister vicky i don't know she said back there thinking well he don't read my mind very well but you know that's that's something that we that's something that that marriage does is brings together those two strains and we got to work that out but you put god in the middle of that it'll work it out amen someone says what what who's the one that i'm supposed to be married to the one you're supposed you're married to now if you're a married person the person that you were that was you were meant to be with is the one you're married to why would you ever think anything different if you're in the church you're believing god for healing you're believing god for salvation why would you ever think i can't be saved well this marriage is useless i'll just move on to another one no god put you there for a reason i'm just hopeless there's no way no god put you there for a reason who is worthy god made you the way you are allowed you to be the way that you are so why why you say well if i had it was the bride i'd have better genes some of the brown says you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned he said for many generations back what was it pre-planned for he never said it you were pre-planned to be a good person he said you were pre-planned so that you could be here tonight you were pre-planned so that you could be here tonight why what is that an opportunity you were pre-planned so you would have an opportunity to be saved amen and he did whatever it took to get you here are you with me say what is my life why did it go the way it did why do i have the genes that i do why have i expressed the things that i have because he brought you all this way so that you could be where you are so that you could be here today he brought jacob he had to nature him in such a way that it would force him into an encounter with the angel of the covenant it doesn't excuse what he did doesn't make it right but there come a day when jacob changed amen and we'd have probably given up on him a lot a lot before god did but god waited until he was 80 years old when he was about 80 years old he's there by the side of the of the creek and here comes an angel and he wrestles with him all night now look paul deals with pharisees still have some today and a lot of times legalism manifests itself in strange ways i don't find it so much you know legalism will manifest itself in in touching on taste not handle not and don't wear short long or long short sleeves and don't you know you have to measure your skirts and things like that that we call that legalism it does manifest itself in that way but more often what i find is it manifests in a critical spirit and so the legalist is critical of everybody and sometimes themselves and illegalists can actually put themselves out of the rapture and paul dealt with these legalists and pharisees in romans two and three these jews that thought they knew everything but they did they didn't do what they what they taught but he says and thank you sal this o man that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou should escape the judgment of god but listen what he says or despises thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance pharisees he said can a pharisee be saved paul was paul said he was the chiefest of sinners because he was a sinner he was a pharisee and god had to knock him down to make him realize he needed to be saved you despise the riches of god's goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that it's the goodness of god it's actually leading you to repentance it's not you say well god blessed me yes it's his goodness it's his goodness it's leading you to repentance he's let you be here this morning or wherever that you're at today are you watching you listen you think god let me be here for a reason why did he have me here because he's leading you to repentance yes he's blessed you yes he's good to you yes there's times he withholds his blessings from you there's times you put allow you to go through things why because the forbearance of god he wants you to be led to repentance he saw got all the good genes as we said and despised the birthright jacob got all the bad genes and coveted the birthright because the bible says the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth esau thought he was right but jacob knew he was a sinner he saw all all that happened when thing bad things happened to esau he just got angry and blamed jacob for it i wanted to kill him but when bad things happened to jacob it led him over time eventually to repentance now watch not everybody's called for the same things and so you look at things that have happened in your life and genes that you've been allowed to inherit you think why this one why not the one that was able to make money right why not i've often wondered why i didn't get the sales gene from my dad my dad got had the sales ability he could sell things i didn't get that gene and i tried it i tried i went the same business he did i was his son great things were expected i couldn't sell nothing because here i was i was i felt such empathy for people i'm sitting there thinking you don't need this you know that's not the way to sell things right and my dad could sell you know he could sell a snow ice cream to an eskimo as the saying is he could sell anything i couldn't sell nothing why didn't i get that gene but god allows you to be who you are and and so god had to bring jacob the way that he was because he was going to break that generational curse that had limited itself in in abraham and in isaac but in but in jacob it would be manifested so it could be broken i hope you're hearing me today some of you got kids that are struggling and some of them are out and you think why did they have to go through those things in here i've been able to live for the lord and here they they're doing these things and i wonder why they have to go through those things because it has to be expressed so that it can be broken why because it would be joseph who would be the type of christ in perfection and let's look at it brother says abraham was the foundation of faith he said now let's say it had four foundations he's speaking on the masterpiece he said the foundation of faith was abraham the foundation of love was isaac the foundation of grace was jacob god's grace to jacob anyone knows that now think about this if all we had was abraham and isaac and then a skip to joseph we wouldn't have an example of grace in the in in those patriarchs but now he built his foundation he says faith and love and grace but in joseph was perfection there is where he could set the monument monument not the first foundation the second foundation the third foundation but on the fourth foundation abraham betrayed portrayed christ of course so did isaac in love abraham did in faith isaac didn't love jacob did by his grace amen he said because jacob means deceiver and that's what he was but god's grace was with him and when it but when it come to joseph there's nothing against him just one little scratch there was one little scratch where that gene come through remember what it was it's when he told his his parents or he told he said told his family he said go tell pharaoh that you're not shepherds that you heard cattle because this would tell them something different because they hate shepherds it's an abomination to them that little manipulative lying gene snuck in what was it for joseph perfect in every other way what was it for to show us that he wasn't the one amen amen he said well i'm just going to be perfect today from now on everything will be just right and those genes won't no they'll be from time to time you're just going to have to overcome them why because that little scratch shows you're not him but you're his bride you're not perfect because you're you you're perfect because you're the bride of christ amen it was a man i don't usually stop to tell a story and kind of in the middle here i'm not i'm i'm not that far from being done but i don't want to scare you but there was a man by the name of george young who was a carpenter and a preacher and in the late 1800s he labored in obscurity and served in small rural areas in the united states we don't even have a reliable record of the dates of his birth and death he was pretty much you know somebody that nobody knew his income was so small he had difficulty supporting his wife and family and he was one of them guys that was wishing he had that rich gene he kept on diligently serving the lord though through all those years and he died young as a middle-aged man they during this time that he was working after years of effort and sacrifice the youngs finally got to a place where they could build a house they were delighted with their new house but he went off to preach and somebody burned it down that's all they ever had they put everything they had into it that's all they ever had they were left homeless during his lifetime he writes a song and the title of it and you'll probably recognize it as god leads his dear children along god leads his dear children along and this has become such a blessing to so many people he wrote both the words and the music and there was a hymn writer by the name of halder lunas who was a great hymn writer and composer of hymn books and and he decided to track down he'd heard that this man's wife was still alive and he wanted to get the story of the hymn and so he goes to track her down and when he finally stops at a gas station in a small town where she lived and asked where she was and where the address that he had someone had given him was for and and the attendant said that's the county poor house that's where the people go don't have anything not knowing what to expect he made his way there and he found mrs young a tiny elderly woman and those horrible surroundings just just awful that in that day that she would have been in and but she had the joy of the lord and she spoke to the man to mr lillian as how he how the lord had guided her and her husband over many years and then she exclaimed to him she said doctor lillian has god led me here do you think god would have led you somewhere else other than the poor house but she said god led me here now think about this here this man never was really able and probably people other preachers probably looked down on him and said well he's just not much of a preacher he's not much of a businessman he's not much of a here he's worked all his life not been able to do anything wrote one hymn that people enjoyed but his wife said years later god led me here i'm so glad he did for you know about every month someone comes into this place to spend the rest of their days so many of them don't know jesus she said isn't it wonderful how god leads these are the words that her husband had written so many years before he said in shady green pastures so rich and so sweet god leads his dear children along where the waters cool flow bases to where he was feet god leads his dear children along some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but god gives a song in the night season and all the day long god led me here he went on he said sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright god leads his dear children along sometimes in the valley the darkest of night god leads his dear children along those sorrows befall us and evils opposed god leads his dear children along through grace we can conquer defeat all our foes we believe that today god leads his dear children along and then he wrote this as the last verse he said away from the mire away from the clay god leads his dear children along leading us out of ourselves leading us out of this clay out of this meyers what he was doing to jacob god leads us their children along the way up in glory eternity stay god leads his dear children along you'll find brother branham quotes the chorus some through the waters some to the flood he quotes the course over and over again in the message and in 1956 he he's used it like this he said i'm so glad that god takes us through the wilderness journey there he can get us alone you see what i was saying when i'm talking about this this trial that we've had this government 19 this trial sometimes god has to get you alone there he can get us alone get out alone with god and in this wilderness experience isn't it strange he's speaking of how the children of israel were led right to the waters of mary led to bitter waters he said isn't it strange how god leads us into great tribulations and trials look how those israelites were led look at the waters of mara how the wilderness of sin and all the different places how the path of god leads he quotes the course some through the water some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood god leads his children strange peculiar ways but god works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform it has to be mysterious or he couldn't perform the wonder amen if he hadn't led him to an impossible situation at the red sea he couldn't have performed the wonder if he hadn't allowed him to come through the wilderness of sin and through the waters of mary the tree could have never been thrown in to sweeten the bitter waters he was leading him along and brother mark said it has to be mysterious or he couldn't perform the wonder and the path of our life is mysterious we don't understand it why are these things expressed in my life why did i have to go through this why did i do that god leads his dear children along he allows you to go through things to see what you'll do and he allows you to go through things to bring you to a place of repentance genesis 32 24 says jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hall of his thigh the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me look at his desperation his determination and brother brandon picks it up in desperation and says you know a man can prevail over god a man can prevail over god he said here he said i will not let thee go he said except thou blessed me and he said unto him what is thy name what i what identity do you have he said jacob supplanter deceiver those are my genes that's who i am that's who my parents were that's who my grandparents were it runs in the family and it's i have the worst case of it in the whole family are you with me now i have the worst case of it in the whole family jacob what is your name jacob he said my name shall be called no more jacob but israel as a prince that has power with god and with men and has prevailed what did jacob overcome when he wrestled with the angel he overcome himself church you realize that's the power we have with god it's the power there's something in that seed that if we can ever get that that experience with god if we can ever get close to and get in that atmosphere like jacob was get along with god we can overcome ourself we don't have to be this way we're not confined to it we're not we're not predetermined to be just like our parents we're just like our grandparents were just like what everybody says we were or the way we were raised oh my but as a prince you prevailed with god god showed grace to jacob to come by his way and change his walk let's go back what made john worthy it wasn't the natural genes that he had in him what made him worthy to look who makes you worthy to look or me who is worthy to look and see what are you looking for you're looking to see your identity there you're looking to see your name you're looking to see your identification as an eagle you see something there that's me i can't belong to a system i can't belong to a denomination i don't belong out there i'm uncomfortable around the way the world acts in the way that they do i'm just not comfortable doing that you know we watch and we go places and enjoy some of the things they enjoy but we would never be comfortable sitting under those denominations why why is it because there's something inside of us something inside of us that have been awakened to a better gospel a better life we couldn't go back those that have went back there's just nothing inside of them that has been awakened yet we couldn't go back for anything why we're an eagle no one but the lamb was worthy but he's made us worthy amen you remember the story that jesus told in luke of how that he the master set a feast and he invited everyone to it each one made an excuse he says i bought a cow got to go look at it bought a field haven't haven't looked at it yet another one said i married a wife he didn't even give an explanation that was enough i married a wife all excuses excuses like noses everybody's got one they all had one and so the servant came back and was commissioned to go and invite them in showed his lord these things in luke 14 21 of the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city bring in the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it has done as though it was commanded yet through his room and the lord said unto the servant go out in the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper brother brother said did you notice those three pulls that this is in is your life worthy of the gospel if you haven't listened to a tape lately go listen to that go listen to is your life worthy of the gospel it's an amazing thing is your life worthy of the gospel you'll find that brother branham doesn't place it just on us but the reason we don't live a worthy life is because we're not born again the reason we don't live a life worthy of the gospel he says because there's not been a change go listen to it is your life worthy of the gospel the brother brother says there was three polls or three terms of it he said when they went out first and called to them that were forbidden to come they didn't do it he said there went out a healing campaign went out to get the blind in the hall still there was room so we went out and compelled the good bad and indifferent that they should come in you know why because they would come you don't understand the willingness to come is is the biggest requirement the willingness to come but god because you're the elect chose you and so he caused you your grandfather to meet and your grandmother and all down through your line to bring you to a place where you would be willing to come and so here they were out in the hedges and how was they weren't expecting to get invited anywhere they were just sitting by the hedges maybe some of them drunks and prostitutes and everything else where does he go in the in the hedges and the highways and tell them come here come here he even had to lead them in had to grab them by the hand and show them where the house was they'd probably never been to a fancy dinner probably had to set them up and show them which fork to use had to show them how to eat the feast and everything else but what was it they were counted worthy because they were willing to come no but that was the third poll the third poll is what called them brother branham and recognizing today in this message he said don't begin to think that you've got the world council at your hand you've got the best dressed members of that god is able of alley rats out here to rise up children to fulfill his word prostitutes street walkers drunkards gamblers he is able to do it he is still god do we believe that today he's still god first corinthians 6 and 9 paul says know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind it's all of the sexual sins and here the material says northeast nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god where does that leave everybody it leaves us no one was found worthy he comes back i love this next verse and such were some of you some of you were effeminate i'm not saying some in this congregation you understand but some of those that were called some of those who were the elect during their lifetimes were effeminate or abusers of themselves with mankind or fornicators are idolaters or adulterers or thieves or covetous or drunkards or revilers or extortioners some of you but you're washed that's what we want to see it's not it's not that well my life if i was elected god would leave me a different path no but are you willing to be washed are you willing to stay and i found in my life and i think we'll find as we go on closer to the end that it's those who are nothing who are willing to stand and be washed and those who have material things who have something to hold on to something to grab onto some some pride some arrogance about themselves to think there's something those are the ones who hold back and will not willingly give themselves to god but those who are nothing are willing to lay themselves down at the altar and say i'm nothing i came from nothing i'm going to nothing i need god in my life the third poll went to those who were willing to come but you're washed you're sanctified but you're justified it's as though you never did it in the first place in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god jesus tells the story of the pharisee and the public and the pharisee is standing there and says telling god what he's done lord i'm a blessed man i've i've given ties of all that i possess i fast twice a week but he's got me beat there i've got all the i do everything right i'm able to come close to the holy of holies and the sinner the publican stands afar off way back i don't even think he's worthy to come in but he stands back there and he says smites himself on the breast he said lord have mercy on me a sinner jesus said who went just who went down justified he said the republican did first corinthians 1 26 he said for you see your calling brethren not many wise men after the flesh are called not many mighty not many noble are called we went through that in our teaching in corinthians and i'm hoping to be able to pick that up pretty soon and continue with that because it's such a marvelous thing that paul chose us he says not many mighty not many nobler called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty base things of the world things which are despised that god chosen yea things which are not to bring to not things that are and no flesh should glory in his presence we get there none of us are going to be able to say i did something to earn it he goes on to say but of him are you in christ jesus now now watch the wording of that but of him of who of god are you in christ jesus that's you're identified with christ you're his bride because god chose you to be of him are you in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom he imputes to us he's made unto us wisdom unto us righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorious let him glory in the lord jesus had a dinner in matthew 9. i won't read it all and i've got them on there but we'll just skip past matthew 9 10 through 13. you go read it he call all the pharisees or republicans and sinners come and sit with him to eat and the pharisees got onto him for it and he said they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick but go and learn what that means i will have mercy and not sacrifice i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance he didn't come i love the way jesus as he followed the leadership of the father you remember it was nicodemus who came to jesus by night the rich young ruler came to jesus right but jesus said i must need to go by samaria you ever thought about that they come to him the wealthy and and and the learned come to him and said you must be a prophet we know you're a man of god or you couldn't do these things but they were afraid to make a commitment and the rich man even went away sorrowful the rich young ruler but he come to a well where there was a woman who was so messed up that on the outside was just as black as could be but brother brown told us she had representation there was something on the inside he could that could connect with it not nicodemus or even gamaliel who was a great teacher and even friendly to the christians but the woman at the well not simon pharisee but the woman of ill fame not caiaphas but the thief on the cross are you beginning to see a pattern no something interesting about this is it's the woman at the well it's the woman of hill fame and in one scripture if it's the same instance it calls her mary but then we know caiaphas name but not the thief on the cross we know simon pharisee's name but not the woman that washed his feet we know naked nicodemus's name but not the woman at the well but he knew their name hallelujah he knows their name so they don't go by name in the scripture but he knew exactly who they were amen had a privilege many years ago i say many years ago it's all relative to how old you are but a few years ago and forgive me for as paul said my folly in mentioning this because it it's a touchstone for me in my life when i pastored at bransville i was pastored to a little lady by the name of may brown and it was a simple farm wife who lived near gerst springs area in alton missouri and then she moved to west plains at some point in her life and her husband had died fairly young and and she lived many more years and i was her pastor for about five years had a small house in west plains i remember going in the floors weren't weren't level and it was just old and because she was there by herself for so many years and after many many years she got put in the nursing home and and when she got put in the nursing home i thought well she's just not going to make it because she was independent and liked to do things and she got in the nursing home she flourished she was just that kind of a person she loved being around people and telling them about the lord and things and fellowship with people she was just a saint of god but she was a simple woman and she attended faithfully at bransville but you know sometimes we get arrogant about things and not her but me i remember preaching one time and i was preaching on something like this morning on the seals and this these things were opening up to me as a young man and i was preaching these things and and and as i was preaching these things i looked over and sister brown was sitting there with her head like this and looked like she wasn't listening it looked like she was asleep as far as i could tell but she would sit that way sometimes in church and i thought she was asleep she was at that time probably 95 something like that and she's sitting in church seemingly asleep and i remember thinking while i'm preaching she's not getting any of this you know when you've got just a few people you you get to know them and you get to know how their expressions and how they respond i thought she's not getting anything out of this and after the service so i walk i'll never forget walking out but jt had brought her and he'd already gotten in the van and she's standing out there waiting on me she's excited she said brother ben she said i want you to know that sermon was for me she said she said there's something about those seals and i knew she'd been saved back in pentecost and and and the story was that when she went to years ago she had been in brother bennett's meetings and if you go to a message called future home of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride i got the quote so you could see it and brother man says ladies sitting there looking at me right on the end of the seat she got sinus trouble she'll believe it god will heal her he said mrs brown believe with all your heart jesus christ will make he said you're a stranger to me but he knows you and we got thinking about these women that we don't know their names but but jesus knew who they were they were in the book and the pharisees whose names we knew they're not in the book but here's a woman whose name we didn't know she was in the book and and and he says you're a stranger to me but he knows you he said you believe it raise up your hand and she was healed of her sinus problems she went there with someone else and praying for someone else to receive a greater healing but she got what she needed that night and her testimony was she never had problems a problem with that specific thing again and ag and i remember preaching about the seals and thinking she's just not getting it she i thought well she's probably that pentecostal age you know she probably don't mean anything to her but she says brother ben that's that sermon was for me she said i've been listening to those seals you've been talking about i know there's something there for me something i need to know you know what i believe i believe she looked in i believe god led a 95 year old simple woman who as far as i know never had a driver's license never never was a big name person other than god spoke her name on tape through a prophet you understand but but she was never a you're just a simple woman she never tried to travel on it and tried to go out and say what an important person she was but she was just a person who believed in the mercy of god but she looked in and god showed her then he took her home oh church if you could just realize he wants to show you today he wants to show he doesn't matter how simple the simpler the better he wants you to see it's me i can't be lost i'm a child of god how could i be lost this is where i belong no matter what i've done no matter what's going on in my life this is who i am i can see my name in the book you can see my identification musicians go ahead and come i'm never going to quit if they don't brother branham talks in the sardisian church age and he's talking about revelations 3 4 where it says dies a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in light for they are worthy he said a few names not many he said that age wasn't what everybody thought it was this great outbreak of the protestant church there were just a few a few lutheran messenger and a few others thousand few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy brother brother says do you realize who is saying this it is jesus the worthy one himself amen this is the only one who has accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits on the throne and now this worthy one is saying to his saints you are worthy amen amen you are worthy here is this one he said the only one qualified to judge he said and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy he said these words are as astounding as are the words in romans 8 33 be it's the last part of the verse he said god says i am righteous that's where paul says who shall lay anything in charge of god's elect it is god who justifies god says i'm righteous they're in the white light of god's righteousness hear the sweet voice of jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they are worthy they shall walk with me in white brother said he doesn't put on a different colored rope than they have on but a white robe the same color as those who walk with me they will walk with me and white listen verse 5 says he that overcometh that's the key he that overcometh every one of us has to overcome we've got to overcome this every one of us has got overcome we say when do you stop overcoming when you're gone when you're leaving the rapture or when you when your body is changed or when you when you go by way of the grave that's when you have to you get to stop overcoming but until then you have to overcome every day paul said i keep running my body bringing under subjection yes i'm saved yes i'm i've been redeemed but i want to be worthy how can i be worthy he give me the power to overcome he makes me worthy by his blood these were counted worthy because there was the few that kept his name he said he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment i will not blot out his of god speak the name amen i think the bride has a part in that i don't understand all that but somehow bride has a part and all of this that voice speaks the name amen amen you'll speak and those that you're those that you have died and you knew the ones that you knew all of a sudden will start coming god speaks the voices in the bride you want to quote for but the brown says that the voice is in the bride and they speak the name and when they speak suddenly things start materializing amen god knows who they are everyone that's down to the ages that have been went by the way of the grave that created voice begins to speak and as he speaks they raise from the dead they come back out of that other dimension where they are and they come back and they begin to appear
