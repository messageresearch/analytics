[37:51] oh god of our salvation and cause thine
[37:53] anger toward us to cease wilt thou be
[37:56] angry with us forever
[37:57] wil thou draw out thine anger to all
[38:00] generations wil thou not revive us again
[38:03] that thy people may rejoice in thee show
[38:06] us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy
[38:09] salvation I will hear what God the Lord
[38:12] will speak for he will speak peace unto
[38:14] his people and to his Saints but let
[38:17] them not turn again to Folly and let's
[38:21] read one more place in Malachi 4 very
[38:23] familiar Malachi
[38:25] 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall
[38:28] burn as an oven and all the proud yay
[38:30] and all that do wickedly shall be
[38:32] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[38:34] burn them up sayith the Lord of host
[38:36] that it shall leave them neither root
[38:38] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[38:40] name how many we got here this morning
[38:42] that fear his name but unto you that
[38:44] fear my name shall the son of
[38:45] righteousness arise with healing in his
[38:47] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[38:49] as calves of the stall and you shall
[38:52] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[38:53] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[38:55] the day that I shall do this sayith the
[38:57] Lord of host remember ye the law of
[38:59] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[39:01] him in Horeb for all Israel with the
[39:03] statutes and judgments behold I will
[39:06] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[39:08] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[39:10] the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of
[39:12] the fathers to the children and the
[39:14] Heart of the children to their fathers
[39:17] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[39:19] curse and you may be seated may the Lord
[39:21] At His blessings to the word this
[39:22] morning just for a background here this
[39:24] morning I just wanted to lay this quote
[39:26] in here and it says brother brandom says
[39:28] it like this High breeding first started
[39:30] in Eden started in Genesis it's the
[39:32] beginning we know that's a seed chapter
[39:34] can you say amen and he said that's
[39:36] where it ends up over here in Revelation
[39:38] at the second coming of Christ now
[39:40] remember correctly that's why each
[39:42] generation has its own Revival aren't
[39:44] you thankful for that each generation
[39:46] has its own Revival it gets a chance at
[39:48] the word then they hre it and instead of
[39:52] taking on they go somewhere else and
[39:54] that's in spoken word as the Original
[39:55] Seed 1962 if you go to Genesis CH 2 and:
[39:58] 15 just for the background this morning
[40:00] I'll try not to read too much and bore
[40:02] you Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took
[40:05] the man and put him into the Garden of
[40:07] Eden to dress it and to keep it and the
[40:10] Lord God commanded the man saying of
[40:12] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[40:13] freely eat but of the tree of the
[40:15] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[40:18] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[40:20] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die now
[40:23] God didn't just uh God didn't say you
[40:25] can't do nothing he he gave him a whole
[40:26] entire Garden there's just one word that
[40:28] you can't go against there's just one
[40:30] thing that you can't do so you could
[40:32] have every fruit you could have every
[40:33] herb you could eat everything you wanted
[40:35] and there would be no death there would
[40:36] be a a continuous Revival if we could
[40:39] say it that way there would never be an
[40:40] end to this Perfection that was in Eden
[40:43] brother Bill and so we just but but but
[40:45] they just had to disobey the word of God
[40:47] they had to denominate if I could use
[40:48] the word there they had to do something
[40:51] outside of the word and and we know that
[40:53] that wasn't maybe in their hearts to do
[40:54] it but there was Satan and he's the he's
[40:57] the one that's always there trying to
[40:58] tell us tell us you know we need to do
[41:00] this we need to do that and listen if we
[41:01] ever recognize who he is and if we
[41:03] recognize his tricks then we can stop a
[41:05] whole lot of that nonsense that goes on
[41:06] in our lives can you say Amen but every
[41:08] fruit every tree you could have except
[41:10] for one every word you can believe it
[41:13] every promise is yours but you can't do
[41:15] this one thing and that's the one thing
[41:18] that caused death to the entire human
[41:20] race can you say man and he said so and
[41:23] so I was I was thinking there actually
[41:25] when I was reading that and I thought
[41:26] well that's where that was
[41:27] a Revival right there and that was the
[41:29] cycle of Revival that was Revival it all
[41:32] started it was Perfection and then there
[41:34] was death that followed it and brother
[41:35] brandom actually says that happened in
[41:37] every Revival but aren't you glad that
[41:39] this last Revival will not have that
[41:41] problem uh this will never denominate
[41:43] brother the bill we can just we can we
[41:44] can just feed on this word and we will
[41:46] never denominate and we will never die
[41:49] can you say Amen so I want to go on here
[41:51] just a little bit I believe there's a
[41:53] group of people that'll break that uh
[41:55] recy that cycle of Revival and death and
[41:58] so brother brand says it like this
[42:00] revival is not bringing in new members
[42:02] but it's to revive what you have can you
[42:04] say amen and brother Brandon talks about
[42:06] Revival and this is not really where I'm
[42:07] going but just for a background where
[42:09] you'll see there's differences in
[42:10] Revival there's sometimes a Revival in
[42:12] you there's sometimes a Revival we would
[42:14] call a Revival meeting in a church where
[42:16] we'd get together and have a meeting
[42:17] that's not really Revival although it
[42:19] does sometimes feel like it because when
[42:21] you get the licks of fire together uh
[42:23] you'll see people that'll just maybe
[42:25] they don't go to church all the time but
[42:26] they'll show up for Rev Ral meetings or
[42:28] uh maybe they don't they don't shout in
[42:29] church but they will at a Revival
[42:31] meeting brother Bill and so maybe they
[42:32] don't amen very often and I wish you
[42:34] would this morning but maybe they'll do
[42:35] it more in a Revival meeting so what
[42:38] what happens there is is it's it's a
[42:40] thrill more than anything and it's
[42:41] actually an emotion that you feed off
[42:43] from the other people and that's okay
[42:45] emotion's good if your religion doesn't
[42:47] have emotion the prophet told us to bury
[42:49] it is that right so we don't want to we
[42:51] don't want to do away with the
[42:52] enthusiasm brother brandham actually
[42:54] makes a statement we must never lose our
[42:57] enthusiasm and I would say this morning
[42:59] let us never let the message of the hour
[43:01] become common to us let us never let
[43:03] going to church become common to us let
[43:06] us never lose our enthusiasm but that's
[43:08] not the Revival that we are
[43:09] participating in in the end time the end
[43:12] time bride Revival is a word Revival it
[43:14] doesn't necessarily mean that you'll
[43:16] have the gifts every service it doesn't
[43:17] necessarily mean that you'll have an
[43:19] emotional time every service but what
[43:21] you will have is the word being preached
[43:23] every service because that is the focus
[43:25] in the bride's revival can you can you
[43:27] say Amen all these other things are good
[43:29] all the all the gifts are part of it the
[43:31] restoration was everything was restored
[43:34] everything was restored back in this age
[43:35] so I'm not discounting any of those
[43:37] things but we must have our eyes on the
[43:39] word because brother brandom said as
[43:41] that first Eve fell the second Eve would
[43:44] be the the the second bride to Adam the
[43:46] second bride to the second Adam would
[43:48] not fall Brother David why because she
[43:50] would receive the word in his fullness
[43:52] and she would not fall away from it
[43:54] aren't you glad about it this morning we
[43:56] will not fall away from the word that
[43:58] has been given to us so brother Ram
[44:00] talks about a Revival for our nation and
[44:02] he's pretty pretty Stern when he talks
[44:03] about that he says it ended in 1956 how
[44:06] many knows the quote there he says
[44:08] America has become condemned and what
[44:10] she did do according to the vision she
[44:12] elected the wrong person they might just
[44:14] do it again Brother David but but but
[44:16] according to the vision she elected the
[44:18] wrong person he said I don't know how
[44:20] long it'll ever take it to run out but
[44:22] it will someday he said that's thus
[44:24] sayith the Lord he said it will he said
[44:27] she's on her downward move right now
[44:29] she'll never come back again so
[44:30] America's America's Revival is is not
[44:33] here it's not present it can't happen
[44:35] again she turned down God as a nation
[44:37] for the last time and so now God has
[44:39] turned her back his back on her and he
[44:41] will speak to individuals that are still
[44:43] longing for Revival or he will speak to
[44:45] individuals that still want the word for
[44:46] the day but God will no longer deal with
[44:49] the nation of of USA as he once did he's
[44:52] actually now dealing with he's went back
[44:54] to the Jews as we know we know these
[44:55] things and I don't want to have time to
[44:56] go going into all of it because we will
[44:58] take an extra hour doing that all right
[45:01] Everybody's scared now I'm telling you
[45:03] you don't have to be scared when it's
[45:04] 12:00 I'm going to quit and then then
[45:06] brother Stuart can preach you happy
[45:08] tonight it's going to be good
[45:11] so all right well he said now that's
[45:14] thus sayith the Lord she's been gone
[45:16] since 1956 when she condemned and turned
[45:19] away God from the great Revival hours
[45:21] now he said and brother sister that's
[45:23] why you hear me cutting as hard as I can
[45:26] the American Revival is over it ended
[45:28] about 4 years ago so it's over and
[45:30] there's no more Revival in America we're
[45:32] only gleaning in the fields that's
[45:34] already been reaped and burned over you
[45:36] pick up a stock once in a while but very
[45:38] few can you say Amen some of you
[45:40] Old-Timers probably remember the time
[45:41] when there was revivals everywhere and
[45:43] maybe there was tents set up in fields
[45:45] and and there was just it was just a
[45:46] different time it was a different uh
[45:48] different age it is the same age but the
[45:50] beginning of the age before before
[45:51] started to run out and so you would see
[45:53] an enthusiasm among the people are you
[45:55] all still with me so far
[45:57] and so we're just dealing with just
[45:59] different stages of Revival here and
[46:00] we'll get past this and and I'm not
[46:02] preaching part two of last week's sermon
[46:03] I
[46:05] promise although it was
[46:09] good now that's what the reason today
[46:11] brother B talks about he goes on he said
[46:13] the revivals that we're supposed to have
[46:15] we have denominational revivals we
[46:18] haven't had a real stirring no sir don't
[46:20] think we got revivals we haven't he said
[46:22] oh they've got millions and millions and
[46:24] millions of church members but not a
[46:26] Revival nowhere the bride now I want to
[46:29] lay this in here and I'll I'll show you
[46:31] where brother brandom actually later uh
[46:32] we'll actually take this up again and
[46:34] and and and he'll show you where the
[46:36] Revival is on but in the third seal 1963
[46:39] he says the bride hasn't had a Revival
[46:40] yet see there's been no Revival there no
[46:43] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[46:45] yet see and we're looking for it now
[46:48] this is 1963 that's important to
[46:50] remember but he said it'll take those
[46:52] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[46:54] wake her up again can you say Amen and
[46:57] now this messenger of Malachi 4 just
[46:59] goes a little bit further here he said
[47:01] in Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[47:03] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[47:06] will turn the hearts of the children to
[47:08] the fathers and two he will reveal the
[47:10] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[47:12] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[47:14] contained in the Seven Seals so let me
[47:16] just say that one more time he said he
[47:18] said he will turn the hearts of the
[47:19] children to the fathers and he will
[47:20] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[47:22] thunders in Revelations 10 which are the
[47:25] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[47:27] so when brother brandham says that there
[47:29] has been no Revival yet for the bride
[47:31] but it will happen he said it'll take
[47:33] those seven unknown Thunders back there
[47:35] to wake her up again we can find out in
[47:38] in the church age book he said now he
[47:40] said he will reveal the mysteries of the
[47:41] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[47:43] are the revelations contained in the
[47:44] Seven Seals brother brandom is preaching
[47:46] the Seven Seals telling you the Revival
[47:48] hasn't happened yet but he may not have
[47:50] realized it then but the Revival was
[47:52] taking place right then it was the
[47:54] bride's Revival being revealed in in the
[47:57] seven Thunders which were in the seven
[47:59] the in the Seven Seals so I just want
[48:01] you to know this morning that when
[48:03] there's people that tell you there's no
[48:04] Revival anywhere I say I am the bride's
[48:06] Revival when somebody tells you it's
[48:08] time that we can just sit down and shut
[48:10] our churches down and I just go ahead
[48:12] and tell them right now I am
[48:13] participating in the bride's Revival I'm
[48:16] not looking for a man to come back and
[48:17] open the seven Thunders the Thunders
[48:19] were revealed and those Seven Seals and
[48:21] I'm here to participate in that Revival
[48:24] but is a word revival can you say Amen
[48:26] so I'm not looking for something else to
[48:28] come and reveal more Mysteries the
[48:30] Mysteries have been opened the Mysteries
[48:31] have been revealed Malachi 4 has come to
[48:34] turn our hearts back and and we see all
[48:36] the restoration that has happened I am
[48:38] not here to to to just go back to
[48:41] another age or go back to Pentecost well
[48:43] can you say Amen because that's what
[48:45] every other Church did and they failed
[48:48] to live in the word of the hour because
[48:49] they would go backwards that's right
[48:51] well can you say Amen but what we have
[48:53] today is the true fullness and the
[48:56] revealing of the word of God and all we
[48:58] have to do is just accept it and believe
[49:01] it and I believe the real bride will she
[49:03] will not go back can you say Amen she
[49:06] will not go back to 1906 Pentecost and I
[49:08] I listen I believe in the gifts and I'm
[49:10] not here to preach against those things
[49:12] I believe every one of those things are
[49:13] still in order and still in action today
[49:16] but we're not focused on those things no
[49:17] more because the Pentecostal group he
[49:20] she would see those signs and she would
[49:22] see those remember the first poem they
[49:24] all loved brother Brandon when he was
[49:25] out there Discerning the heart hearts of
[49:27] the people and and he would just preach
[49:28] a A good sermon but when he started to
[49:30] turn and his ministry would change
[49:32] towards the word then the people would
[49:34] start to fall away why because they were
[49:36] not in the bride's Revival but they were
[49:38] a part of the Pentecostal Revival of
[49:40] 1906 now I don't say they're bad people
[49:43] I don't say that those people didn't
[49:44] make it but they were in another age but
[49:47] we are called out of leoda into a bride
[49:50] age to where we can understand the
[49:52] message of the hour and we can believe
[49:54] the message of the hour and we are we
[49:56] are here to say that nothing can
[49:58] separate me from the message that has
[50:00] been preached nothing is going to cause
[50:02] me to go over there and take a bite off
[50:04] of that denominational tree nothing is
[50:06] going to go over here and cause me to
[50:08] fall away like so many others have
[50:10] fallen away why because I am the bride's
[50:13] Revival today you are the bride's
[50:17] Revival it's not coming it's here can
[50:19] you say Amen brother brandom says it
[50:22] like this in recognizing your day in his
[50:23] message 1964 he said everywhere now
[50:26] there's no Revival everybody is
[50:28] complaining ministers crying and he was
[50:30] talking about the herald of his coming
[50:31] he said one of the he's one of the
[50:32] finest papers on the field he said but
[50:35] they hardly will print anything unless
[50:37] it's about fast pre fast pre sound a
[50:39] trumpet how many reads it he said you
[50:41] know you see it all the time fast pray
[50:43] fast pray it's all it's all you he fast
[50:45] pray he said we're going to have a great
[50:47] out great breaking of the day there's a
[50:48] great thing going to happen all of you
[50:50] pray pray we're not too late yet and
[50:52] what do they do they're crying believing
[50:55] that there will be an Awakening they're
[50:56] good people why is it what have they
[50:59] done they have not recognized The
[51:01] Awakening of the Bride in the seven
[51:04] Thunders there was an Awakening of the
[51:05] bride and oh come on somebody I I when I
[51:08] was reading this I just got excited
[51:10] because some people will take that quote
[51:11] over there in the in the third seal
[51:13] Brother David well we got to raise up
[51:14] somebody that can come and reveal the
[51:16] seven Thunders to us no just go ahead
[51:18] and read a little farther and you'll
[51:19] find out the prophet said they were
[51:21] already revealed we are in the time of
[51:23] Revival now we are in the time well
[51:26] nobody ought to Rejoice over it because
[51:28] we are participants in the bride's
[51:31] Revival this is the final Revival
[51:33] there's not going to be another
[51:34] Pentecostal Revival or another Baptist
[51:36] Revival but we are in the bride's
[51:38] Revival today can you say amen and in
[51:41] this revival I would say all things are
[51:43] possible can you say Amen in this
[51:45] revival everything has been restored
[51:47] everything that the Palmer worm and the
[51:48] canker worm and the caterpillar had
[51:50] eaten everything that the worms had
[51:51] eaten off of the tree that everything is
[51:53] restored back now but remember the main
[51:56] thing was Revelations 10 it was the
[51:58] opening of the word can you say Amen
[52:01] everything else has its place everything
[52:03] is important it's important I believe if
[52:05] you take out one thing that puts you
[52:07] right back there just like the first Eve
[52:09] but if you'll just recognize your day
[52:11] and its message then you'll recognize
[52:13] the Awakening of the Bride Can you say
[52:15] amen he said they have not recognized
[52:17] The Awakening Now The Awakening of the
[52:19] Bride the reev the bride's Revival
[52:21] happens when the true church the bride
[52:24] begins to line up with the word can you
[52:26] say Amen so she is not looking for
[52:28] another word for the pill she's not
[52:30] looking for another Prophet but she
[52:31] lines up with the word that's already
[52:33] been revealed can you say Amen now when
[52:35] Wesley's Revival came there was Wesleyan
[52:38] brother Bram talks about Wesleyan would
[52:40] speak for John Wesley because they
[52:41] raised up and they were the voice for
[52:42] the age can you say amen and so they
[52:45] were the voice of that age and so and
[52:47] and so the Wesleyan they they were they
[52:49] listen there was there was going to be a
[52:51] bride in that age there were they would
[52:52] they would stay with the True Light the
[52:54] true word that was open to them in their
[52:57] day but remember it was just a portion
[52:59] just an allotment Luther was the same
[53:01] way that just shall live by faith and
[53:03] and and remember they were not wrong in
[53:04] what they were doing the full light had
[53:06] not come yet because Revelations 10:7
[53:09] and the messenger of Malachi 4 had not
[53:11] come yet but there was a truth to that
[53:13] and they would go ahead and but the
[53:15] problem is Brother Bill they would
[53:16] actually denominate around that truth it
[53:19] was a good truth it's a and it's Bible
[53:21] teaching but they would denominate there
[53:23] and they would completely say that what
[53:25] Wesley had was wrong the sanctification
[53:27] message is wrong but Wesley would come
[53:29] into more light and that would leave the
[53:31] lutherans in a day where they would end
[53:32] up dying in the age that they were in a
[53:34] true Revival but he would die can you
[53:37] say amen and so when Wesley comes along
[53:39] in a true Revival well can you say Amen
[53:41] are you still with me it's a true
[53:44] Revival I'm not we're not discounting
[53:45] another age we're not discounting these
[53:47] men and and what they did they were
[53:49] Messengers to the age but remember that
[53:52] age was not the fullness of the word it
[53:55] had not come yet and so Wesley would
[53:57] have a Revival a great Revival
[53:59] outpouring of the spirit and they would
[54:00] call him the shout Methodist at one
[54:01] point and and I remember some of the
[54:03] old-timers when I was a kid because we
[54:05] were raised around the Wesley and
[54:06] Methodist people and I will say this
[54:08] there were some prayer warriors there
[54:09] were some good Christians there and you
[54:11] couldn't you could your life couldn't
[54:12] match up with any of them they were just
[54:14] I mean they were just straight as an
[54:15] arrow there they were just great people
[54:17] but what happened was they would say oh
[54:19] if you spoke in tongues you were of the
[54:21] devil so what they would do they would
[54:23] they would say well sanctification is
[54:25] all we need we don't need the tongue
[54:26] talkers we oh they'd shout they'd scream
[54:28] they'd run the aisles but they didn't
[54:29] want that tongue talking Pentecostal
[54:31] Bunch well here comes the tongue talking
[54:33] Pentecostal Bunch with a little more
[54:35] light for their day but what do they do
[54:37] they do the same thing the lutherans did
[54:40] the same thing the weslan did and they
[54:42] say if you got the tongues then you got
[54:43] the Holy Ghost this is the evidence no
[54:46] what they did they failed to go on into
[54:48] the light for the age that they were in
[54:49] brother the bill and so what we have to
[54:51] do is quit looking back and saying well
[54:54] this is what we need to do and this is
[54:56] what need to denominate on or we don't
[54:58] have enough gifts in the church so we
[54:59] need to start focusing on the gifts
[55:01] again I say focus on the word and the
[55:03] gifts will happen in order if they're
[55:05] there in the
[55:06] church I believe in the gifts I believe
[55:08] in these things and I know sometimes
[55:10] when you say the word the word they say
[55:11] well your word only and you don't
[55:13] believe in shouting I tell you what I
[55:14] wish we had some runners in the church I
[55:16] wish we had some shouters in the church
[55:18] and maybe if the word is preached hard
[55:19] enough and long enough long enough maybe
[55:22] somebody will get up and run whether
[55:23] it's running out the back door or to the
[55:25] front but but what we're going to do is
[55:27] we're just got to preach the word
[55:28] Brother David and let the seed fall on
[55:30] fertile ground and it will raise up
[55:32] members of this body of Christ on the
[55:34] earth now the bride will be the same way
[55:38] except it's the final Revival and there
[55:40] is no end to it the bride will have the
[55:42] fullness of the light they will they
[55:44] will not do away with what Luther had
[55:45] they will not do away with what Wesley
[55:47] had they will not do away with what
[55:49] Pentecost had but they will walk in the
[55:51] fullness of the light can you say amen
[55:54] and we will not denominate the cycle of
[55:55] r rival and death has ceased can you say
[55:58] Amen now you may get into a church
[56:00] Revival or a church meeting Revival or
[56:02] even a personal Revival and you'll be on
[56:04] a mountain toop one day and in the
[56:06] valley the next have you ever been there
[56:08] I've been in meetings before where I
[56:09] felt so good I thought no devil could
[56:10] ever come against me and Monday morning
[56:12] come around next thing you know I
[56:15] thought well I don't even know if I can
[56:16] make it to Tuesday but what happens is
[56:19] is you've got to participate in the
[56:21] Revival of the age and don't look at the
[56:23] emotion of it well can you say Amen I I
[56:26] believe in Emotion I I hope I've said
[56:28] that enough times this morning that you
[56:29] know I believe in Emotion but I I but
[56:31] but that's not what we focus on because
[56:33] you can feel good and not have the real
[56:35] thing you can look good and not have the
[56:36] real thing what can you sayen you you
[56:39] can have all you can have all the you
[56:41] can have evidences in your life but if
[56:43] you've never met God face to face then
[56:45] you may not have anything on the inside
[56:47] I've I've seen people that dress good
[56:49] and and and and I grew up around a whole
[56:51] a church there where my dad pastored and
[56:53] and the women were you know he was
[56:55] strict you know and they had to dress a
[56:56] certain way and certain length sleeves
[56:58] and and all these things and well listen
[57:00] they they looked Holiness on the outside
[57:02] people would say well your your church
[57:03] looks good but it was just rules it was
[57:05] regulations on the inside when he died
[57:07] they all just went back out in the world
[57:09] so I'll just say it like this if you've
[57:10] got something on the inside it's staying
[57:13] power and it will not cease in this day
[57:16] it will not fall away to Le of sin it
[57:18] will not fall away to the things of the
[57:20] world but it will hold on to the word in
[57:22] this hour can you say Amen good to see
[57:24] the Jones family here this morning God
[57:25] bless you yet and so brother bandam says
[57:28] here he says nevertheless I have someone
[57:31] against he's quoting Revelations 2:4 he
[57:33] says nevertheless I have somewhat
[57:35] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[57:37] first love to understand this you must
[57:39] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[57:41] to the original Saints of Ephesus alone
[57:43] talking about the Ephesian church he
[57:44] said this message is to the entire age
[57:46] which lasted about 120 years its message
[57:49] and then is to all the generation in
[57:51] that span Now history keeps repeating
[57:53] itself in the generations of Israel he
[57:55] said we reive Revival in one generation
[57:57] only to see the fires fading in the next
[58:00] are you still with me in the third
[58:02] generation Embers may be glowing
[58:04] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[58:06] no vestage whatsoever of the original
[58:08] flame now we've seen that happen in
[58:10] families because what happens is
[58:12] there'll be somebody that comes to the
[58:13] message uh uh you know and and they'll
[58:15] really take hold of the word and then
[58:17] maybe their kids follow it and maybe
[58:19] they get into it a little bit and then
[58:20] maybe the third generation well we go to
[58:22] church and then maybe the fourth
[58:23] generation we don't have to go to church
[58:25] we're we're going to go in on Mom Dad
[58:27] and Grandpa's confession well what
[58:29] happens is that's that's a that's a
[58:30] cycle of death that is coming on can you
[58:32] say Amen so yes there was a Revival that
[58:34] started that family in the church but
[58:36] there was a there was a cycle of death
[58:39] that would end that family coming to the
[58:40] church eventually can you say amen and
[58:43] so we don't want to see that in our
[58:44] lives we don't want to see that cycle
[58:46] we've got to break that cycle can you
[58:47] say Amen we need to break the family
[58:49] curse in this day we need to break the
[58:51] time listen church we I I just wish I
[58:54] could preach to you here for a minute
[58:55] sometimes I think we get so we get so uh
[58:58] uh thinking so good about ourselves that
[59:00] well I you know I'm so sealed I'm so
[59:03] good well what about our family
[59:04] sometimes we need to put our Focus over
[59:06] on the family and say you know what I
[59:08] can't lose a one of them we need to put
[59:10] the the prayer altars back in the home
[59:12] again and God help me to have prayer
[59:14] back in the home again and maybe maybe
[59:16] we need to put the Bible back on the
[59:17] table again and maybe the TV should be
[59:19] shut off a little bit I tell you I think
[59:22] sometimes we just need to realize that
[59:23] participating in this bride's Revival is
[59:26] more than saying I'm a message believer
[59:28] it's more than saying well I I'm I'm
[59:30] just a good Christian listen that's not
[59:32] good enough to get you in a Rapture but
[59:34] this second Eve will not fall to the
[59:36] cuttingly devices of the world but she
[59:38] will look to Calvary and say that's all
[59:40] I want I don't want what this world's
[59:42] got to offer can you say
[59:45] Amen brother brandom said the Embers may
[59:47] be glowing slightly but in the fourth
[59:51] there may be there may be no vestage
[59:52] whatsoever of the original flame then
[59:54] God lights the fire again and the same
[59:57] process is repeated it is simply the
[1:00:00] manifestation of the truth that God has
[1:00:02] no grandchildren can you say Amen your
[1:00:05] children are going to make it because
[1:00:06] you believe they're going to make it but
[1:00:07] you remember they still have to have an
[1:00:10] experience you believe that they're
[1:00:11] going to have an experience you don't
[1:00:12] believe that they're just going to make
[1:00:13] it no matter what condition they're in
[1:00:15] but you believe that somehow someway
[1:00:17] there will be a way back before they
[1:00:19] take their final breath can you say amen
[1:00:21] and he said then God lights the fire
[1:00:23] again and the same process is repeated
[1:00:26] it is simply the manifestation of the
[1:00:29] truth that God has no grandchildren that
[1:00:31] is what starts the Revival and that is
[1:00:33] what starts the the cycle of death he
[1:00:35] said then it is simply the manifestation
[1:00:38] he said salvation is not passed on by
[1:00:39] natural birth any more than there is any
[1:00:42] truth to Apostolic succession it isn't
[1:00:45] in the word you start out with the truly
[1:00:47] Born Again Believers and and when the
[1:00:49] next Generation comes along they are no
[1:00:51] longer just plain Christians but they
[1:00:53] have taken a denominational name and
[1:00:55] they're now bapti Methodist and Etc he
[1:00:57] said that is exactly what they are too
[1:00:59] they are not Christians you have to be
[1:01:01] born of the will of God not the will of
[1:01:03] man so I believe there are Christians in
[1:01:05] the denominations today but not
[1:01:07] everybody that says they're a Baptist is
[1:01:09] a Christian not everybody that says
[1:01:10] they're Methodist is Christian not
[1:01:12] everybody that says their Assembly of
[1:01:13] God is a Christian and not everybody
[1:01:16] that says their message is bride well
[1:01:19] can you say Amen I'm not counting
[1:01:20] anybody out I'm not putting anybody out
[1:01:22] but you got to check up yourselves
[1:01:24] sometimes and say what what's really in
[1:01:26] my heart and am I like that first Eve am
[1:01:28] I going over here am I flirting with the
[1:01:30] world over here and am I just saying
[1:01:32] well one word I won't surely die but
[1:01:35] what you're really going to do if you
[1:01:36] are that second Eve and I believe you
[1:01:38] are this morning can you say amen I
[1:01:40] believe you all are this morning I
[1:01:41] believe you are a part of the Bride of
[1:01:43] this last day I believe you are are a
[1:01:46] part of this end time Revival so if you
[1:01:48] are you are not looking for something
[1:01:50] else you're not looking for another
[1:01:52] denomination you're not looking for
[1:01:54] something to to to blend in with the
[1:01:56] World by but what you're looking at is
[1:01:58] saying Lord I'm looking to your word and
[1:02:01] that is my absolute can you say
[1:02:04] Amen so we're not looking at anything
[1:02:06] else we're looking at the word of God
[1:02:08] can you say Amen we have the Revelation
[1:02:12] and it has been open to us the opening
[1:02:13] of the book is here it's not a closed
[1:02:15] book now remember all these other ages
[1:02:17] had they had the opening of the word
[1:02:19] they could have maybe seen what we see
[1:02:20] today but it wasn't time yet there had
[1:02:23] to come a time where there was a certain
[1:02:24] man and and God had God knew before the
[1:02:27] foundation of the world exactly when he
[1:02:29] would come and he would be able to yield
[1:02:31] himself to the ministry of God so much
[1:02:33] that he would not make it about himself
[1:02:35] and point people to himself but he's
[1:02:36] pointing you back to the word at the
[1:02:38] beginning he's pointing you back to a
[1:02:41] Vindication he's not pointing you to
[1:02:43] brother William brandham but he's
[1:02:44] pointing you to Christ himself which is
[1:02:47] the word can you say amen I believe what
[1:02:49] a prophet said but you know why I
[1:02:50] believe this Prophet because he never
[1:02:52] one time said listen to me follow me he
[1:02:54] said no you follow me as I follow Christ
[1:02:56] you stay with the word you stay well
[1:02:58] come on somebody you believe what the
[1:03:00] Bible says you believe what's on them
[1:03:02] tapes when when he said thus sayth the
[1:03:03] Lord I say yes sir because it never
[1:03:06] failed one time it wasn't brother
[1:03:07] brandham speaking that was God speaking
[1:03:09] through a man can you say Amen so
[1:03:13] brother B goes on down he said it isn't
[1:03:14] in the word you start out with truly
[1:03:16] born- again Believers and when the next
[1:03:18] Generation comes along they are no
[1:03:20] longer just plain Christians they're
[1:03:21] methodists and Etc and he goes on down
[1:03:23] to say this and he says I don't say that
[1:03:25] some of them aren't right with God not
[1:03:27] for a minute he said th these folks are
[1:03:29] all coming together now by the will of
[1:03:30] man he said but I don't say they're not
[1:03:31] right with God not for a minute I do I
[1:03:33] say that but the original fire has died
[1:03:36] down there is no more Revival in
[1:03:38] denominational
[1:03:40] churches you sayen right you say well
[1:03:43] how can you say that have you been to
[1:03:44] one well I've been to a few especially
[1:03:46] growing up but I will say it like this
[1:03:47] there's a lot of emotion and many of
[1:03:49] them there's a lot of programs and a lot
[1:03:52] of them but there is no word being
[1:03:54] preached how can you say Amen they might
[1:03:57] get up there and say for God so loved
[1:03:58] the world I could say Amen to that if a
[1:04:00] Catholic priest told me that God loved
[1:04:01] me I'd say Amen to that I I can amen the
[1:04:04] word no matter who it comes from but I
[1:04:05] would like to say this that that is not
[1:04:07] what I'm looking for what I'm looking
[1:04:09] for is more than just Jesus Loves Me
[1:04:11] sermons I'm looking for a word that'll
[1:04:13] change my heart back just like it was in
[1:04:15] the beginning and I believe we have that
[1:04:17] word today can you say amen and brother
[1:04:20] Brandon would say it like this he said
[1:04:22] they are not the same anymore the
[1:04:24] fervent desire to please God the passion
[1:04:26] to know his word the cry for reaching
[1:04:28] out in the spirit all begins to fade and
[1:04:31] instead of that church being on fire
[1:04:33] with the fire of God it has cooled off
[1:04:35] and become a bit formal he said that is
[1:04:38] what's happening back there to the
[1:04:39] Ephesians they were getting a bit formal
[1:04:41] the abandonment of God to God was dying
[1:04:44] out and the people weren't too careful
[1:04:46] about what God thought of them and they
[1:04:48] and they began to be careful about what
[1:04:50] the world thought of them well can you
[1:04:51] say Amen they they didn't think well
[1:04:53] godes does this please God well does
[1:04:54] this please my friend at school or does
[1:04:56] this please the world because if I can
[1:04:58] just look a little more like the world I
[1:05:00] don't have to suffer persecution but
[1:05:02] brothers and sisters I say get as far
[1:05:03] away from the world that you as you can
[1:05:05] get if the world's doing it do something
[1:05:07] else if the world's out here cutting
[1:05:09] their hair and wearing pants and and
[1:05:11] putting on makeup and well come on
[1:05:12] somebody I I think we need to run as far
[1:05:15] away from that Spirit as we can run I
[1:05:17] say we need to quit doing the things
[1:05:18] that the world's doing and come back to
[1:05:20] the in line with the word of God can you
[1:05:22] say Amen we've got young people and I'd
[1:05:25] say for the sake of the children let's
[1:05:27] line up with the word today and keep the
[1:05:29] Revival fires hot in our homes keep the
[1:05:31] Revival fires hot in our churches let
[1:05:33] the word have the preeminence and where
[1:05:35] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:05:37] liberty for souls to be saved there is
[1:05:39] liberty for young people to come back to
[1:05:41] God there is Liberty I tell you there's
[1:05:43] old people that need to come back to God
[1:05:44] there's liberty where the spirit of the
[1:05:46] Lord is can you say
[1:05:48] Amen right brother said just like Israel
[1:05:51] what they did they demanded a king to be
[1:05:54] like the other nations they wanted to be
[1:05:55] like somebody else can you say Amen but
[1:05:58] what they in the world what the world
[1:05:59] thought of the second generation coming
[1:06:00] on was just like that but what they do
[1:06:02] they rejected God but what do they but
[1:06:04] they did it anyway and that is the
[1:06:05] history of the church when it thinks
[1:06:08] more of conforming to the world instead
[1:06:10] of conforming to God it isn't long until
[1:06:13] you see them stop doing the things they
[1:06:15] used to do and start doing things you
[1:06:17] see them stop doing things they used to
[1:06:19] do and start doing things that they
[1:06:20] wouldn't do initially so when you first
[1:06:22] get on fire for God and you hear that
[1:06:24] red hot sermon that makes you run to the
[1:06:26] Altar and you hear that red hot sermon
[1:06:28] that makes you just really fall in love
[1:06:29] with God again and You Weep and you cry
[1:06:32] and you go home and you kick all the
[1:06:33] nasty stuff out of your house and you
[1:06:35] make things right with God and then if
[1:06:37] you let that Revival Fire Die Brother
[1:06:39] David then you'll know six months for a
[1:06:41] year down the road a few of those things
[1:06:43] can come back in the house or you can
[1:06:44] start missing a few Services again or
[1:06:46] you well come on somebody what happens
[1:06:48] is you let the Revival fire die but I
[1:06:51] say keep the Revival fire burning don't
[1:06:53] let the devil blow it out keep it it on
[1:06:56] your hearts and keep it in your homes
[1:06:59] don't let the Revival fires die because
[1:07:01] we do need a personal Revival we do need
[1:07:04] a refilling of the Holy Ghost we don't
[1:07:06] do away with those things just because
[1:07:07] we're in the bride's Revival because if
[1:07:09] you're in this bride's Revival you long
[1:07:11] to have more of God if you're in this
[1:07:13] bride's Revival then you can't hardly
[1:07:14] help but get to church well come on
[1:07:16] somebody if the love of God is in your
[1:07:18] heart so I'm not going there this
[1:07:19] morning this ain't that go to church
[1:07:20] sermon I promise you that but what I
[1:07:22] would like to say this morning if God is
[1:07:23] in your heart the Revival fire fires
[1:07:25] will be in your heart if the love of God
[1:07:28] is there then there's nothing that can
[1:07:29] stop you from praising God if the
[1:07:32] Revival fires are there then there's
[1:07:34] nothing that can separate you from the
[1:07:36] love of God why because it's not
[1:07:37] something on the flesh but it's
[1:07:39] something on the inside it's something
[1:07:41] that'll make you love somebody it's
[1:07:43] something that'll make you treat people
[1:07:44] right brother Bill it's a it's something
[1:07:46] that'll make you put your arms around a
[1:07:48] center and say I know I I know God loves
[1:07:51] you and I know a word that'll bring you
[1:07:53] back but you've got to participate in
[1:07:55] the word for your day and that'll bring
[1:07:58] Revival instead of trying to get the
[1:08:00] Revival to bring the
[1:08:03] word let the word bring revival can you
[1:08:05] say Amen well that was too much word
[1:08:08] this morning well I'll just tell you
[1:08:09] right now if the word was preached
[1:08:10] Revival's there can you say Amen maybe
[1:08:13] you didn't feel it that morning but I
[1:08:14] believe it's coming because God will
[1:08:15] inhabit the Praises of his people and if
[1:08:17] you'll praise God and the word is being
[1:08:19] preached you're in a good atmosphere for
[1:08:21] Success you're in a good atmosphere to
[1:08:23] be changed you're in a good atmosphere
[1:08:25] to let the world fall off of you can you
[1:08:27] say
[1:08:28] amen he said
[1:08:30] now when it thinks more of the
[1:08:32] conforming of the world he said now they
[1:08:33] change their manner of dress their
[1:08:34] attitudes and their behavior they get
[1:08:36] LAX that is what the Ephesus is means
[1:08:39] relaxed and drifting that cycle of
[1:08:41] Revival and death has never failed and
[1:08:44] all you have to do is recall this last
[1:08:46] move of God in the spirit when men and
[1:08:48] women dressed like Christians and went
[1:08:50] to church prayed all night took to the
[1:08:51] street corners and weren't ashamed of
[1:08:53] well I'd say we need to get back to some
[1:08:55] of those days every once in a while and
[1:08:56] he said they took the street corners and
[1:08:58] weren't ashamed of the manifestations of
[1:09:00] the spirit can you say Amen they left
[1:09:02] their old dead churches and worshiped in
[1:09:05] homes or old store buildings they had
[1:09:06] reality but it wasn't too long time
[1:09:09] until they begin to get enough money to
[1:09:10] build fine new churches and they put in
[1:09:13] a choir instead of singing unto God well
[1:09:15] there ain't no choirs there amen he said
[1:09:17] they put in a choir instead of singing
[1:09:19] instead of singing themselves to God and
[1:09:21] so he said and what they did he said
[1:09:24] they he he said and and they put on
[1:09:25] gowns on the choir and they organized a
[1:09:27] movement and ran it by man and they soon
[1:09:29] began to read books that weren't fit to
[1:09:31] read can you say amen and they let down
[1:09:33] the bars and the goats came in and took
[1:09:35] over the Cry Of Joy was gone that's
[1:09:38] right well I think it's a bad day when
[1:09:40] the house of God has no cries of joy in
[1:09:43] it I think it's a bad time when we when
[1:09:45] we forget to worship God when we come to
[1:09:47] meet him I think it's a bad time if we
[1:09:49] don't entertain him while we're here
[1:09:50] well can you say man this is not just a
[1:09:53] place to come and sit it's not a place
[1:09:54] to come and just receive but let's
[1:09:56] participate in it let's participate in
[1:09:59] the bride's Revival that means if you
[1:10:00] need to come and Shout go ahead and
[1:10:02] shout if you need to come and let loose
[1:10:04] a little bit and just worship God in the
[1:10:06] house of God I say let loose and worship
[1:10:08] God in the house of God because we are
[1:10:11] participants amen we're not just here as
[1:10:13] Spectators Brother David but we are here
[1:10:15] as participants in this revival can you
[1:10:18] say Amen sir all right he said he said
[1:10:21] and they put their choir and go on now I
[1:10:23] got to get off that choir thing
[1:10:26] he said the Cry Of Joy was gone the
[1:10:27] freedom of the spirit was gone oh they
[1:10:29] kept on with a form but the fire had
[1:10:31] died down and the Blackness of Ashes is
[1:10:34] about all that's left what can you say
[1:10:36] Amen church I don't ever want to come to
[1:10:38] church and feel like all we've got is
[1:10:41] just another church I don't ever want to
[1:10:43] come to church and feel like all we've
[1:10:44] got is just another Wednesday night or
[1:10:46] just another Sunday morning or just
[1:10:48] another Sunday afternoon God help me if
[1:10:50] I ever get that complacent I want to
[1:10:52] believe that this is a time when I can
[1:10:53] actually meet God can you amen when I
[1:10:56] can actually let the Revival fire start
[1:10:58] again in my life when I can actually get
[1:11:00] in the presence enough to where the sins
[1:11:02] that have tried to bes set me throughout
[1:11:03] the week they can fall away Brother
[1:11:05] David I need the renewing and the
[1:11:07] refreshing in the house of God I'm not
[1:11:09] satisfied with yesterday's Revival I'm
[1:11:12] not satisfied with yesterday's meeting
[1:11:14] you young people don't be satisfied with
[1:11:16] yesterday's youth meeting but remember
[1:11:18] the next one needs to be the best one
[1:11:21] because you need to participate in it
[1:11:22] and say this revival is for me this
[1:11:24] meting is for me this word is for me can
[1:11:29] you say Amen sorry to yell at you but
[1:11:32] I'm enthused about what I got this
[1:11:33] morning I believe that God is absolutely
[1:11:35] wanting to do something for this church
[1:11:37] right here this morning but you've got
[1:11:38] to want it you've got to want what God's
[1:11:40] got for you you've got to want the
[1:11:42] Revival you can't say well I'm satisfied
[1:11:45] with what I got it's good to be
[1:11:46] satisfied with Jesus but I want to tell
[1:11:48] you this you need more of what you got
[1:11:51] yeah you don't need more cars you don't
[1:11:52] need more houses you don't need more
[1:11:53] money you need more of God God in your
[1:11:55] life can you say Amen you can have all
[1:11:58] this world and I tell you it's good to
[1:12:00] have it but you can have everything you
[1:12:01] want but let me just go ahead and tell
[1:12:03] you
[1:12:03] something all that ain't going to buy
[1:12:05] your way to heaven all that's not going
[1:12:07] to get you there if you're out of this
[1:12:09] revival you ain't making it because
[1:12:11] remember every other Revival every other
[1:12:14] eve they would fall and they would die
[1:12:16] it was recycle it was a cycle not
[1:12:17] recycle it was a cycle of Revival and
[1:12:20] death but what would happen at the end
[1:12:22] of all of this there will be a bride
[1:12:24] still on the Earth I'm getting ahead of
[1:12:25] myself a little bit but there'll be a
[1:12:27] bride still on the earth and she is not
[1:12:29] going to taste death can you say Amen
[1:12:31] she will not taste death there's going
[1:12:33] to be somebody that the Revival will
[1:12:35] start in and she cannot die can you say
[1:12:39] amen and I would say that even if you go
[1:12:41] by way of the Grave you can't die if
[1:12:43] you're in this bride's Revival because
[1:12:45] the dead in Christ shall rise first can
[1:12:46] you say Amen you well come on somebody
[1:12:49] that ought to make somebody happy you
[1:12:51] say well what about all these people
[1:12:52] that are dying well if they're in Christ
[1:12:54] they can't die
[1:12:56] well can you say
[1:12:58] Amen brother says it like this when the
[1:13:01] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[1:13:02] a Revival when she begins to come back
[1:13:05] and line herself up with the word of God
[1:13:07] watch then again you see how that the
[1:13:10] scriptures at that time there'll be a
[1:13:11] message sweep out to catch that bride oh
[1:13:14] I believe we've had the message can you
[1:13:16] say amen and I'm glad to be caught by
[1:13:18] the message Brother David I'm glad that
[1:13:20] the message caught I didn't go looking
[1:13:22] for the message but the message found me
[1:13:24] you say well wouldn't you raise in the
[1:13:25] message home I'll tell you what I ran
[1:13:26] just as hard as I could from the message
[1:13:28] but the but the but it wouldn't let me
[1:13:29] go I I tried to go out I tried to leave
[1:13:32] I I you I tried to do those things I
[1:13:34] tried to go UPC I tried I thought maybe
[1:13:36] they're right maybe no no when I come to
[1:13:37] find out this message was right the
[1:13:39] whole time but the devil was trying to
[1:13:40] get me away the devil was trying to say
[1:13:42] why don't you go over here with this
[1:13:43] move what about this move what about
[1:13:45] this group no no I'm not looking for a
[1:13:47] group I found the word can you say
[1:13:49] Amen not looking for nothing else I'm
[1:13:52] not looking for some group first time I
[1:13:53] was ever in a UPC Church they got up and
[1:13:55] talked about the evidence of the Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost speaking in tongues I had heard
[1:13:58] too much word to buy that there was
[1:14:01] something on the inside I thought I
[1:14:02] can't go that way because that's not
[1:14:04] even scriptural that's not even
[1:14:06] scriptural see the seed was there even
[1:14:08] when I didn't want it to be there the
[1:14:10] word was planted before I even had well
[1:14:12] come on somebody God will not leave you
[1:14:15] to just rot in this evil age but if the
[1:14:17] seed is there the word will find you can
[1:14:20] you say
[1:14:22] Amen well are y'all okay so far I know
[1:14:26] this is scattered and that's kind of
[1:14:27] what I do I guess but there's some good
[1:14:29] quotes in here if you don't get nothing
[1:14:30] else here's some of them brother Rand
[1:14:33] says it like this he said the message
[1:14:34] sweep out to catch that bride catch that
[1:14:35] woman elect man can you say Amen how
[1:14:37] many we got in here that's elected this
[1:14:39] morning well you might as well say Amen
[1:14:41] because you are or you wouldn't be here
[1:14:43] just believe like that there's no reason
[1:14:44] to doubt it just believe like it God put
[1:14:47] me here for a reason I am the elected of
[1:14:49] God I'm not looking at my mistakes I'm
[1:14:51] not looking at my past I'm not looking
[1:14:53] at my family history Brother David I
[1:14:55] know I say that a lot because I have to
[1:14:57] my great grandpa had to leave Missouri
[1:14:59] because of our family history and I'm
[1:15:01] going to tell you right now I don't want
[1:15:02] to go back there and say well that
[1:15:04] murdering man I don't want to go back
[1:15:05] there no no I want to say right now well
[1:15:08] come on somebody I can't look to that I
[1:15:10] can't hold on to him for salvation my
[1:15:12] grandpa was a good Church of God
[1:15:13] Holiness man but I can't hold on to that
[1:15:15] for salvation I I can't hold on to what
[1:15:17] my daddy had for salvation because he
[1:15:19] didn't understand the word like I said
[1:15:20] even himself but I'll say this when the
[1:15:22] word found me I couldn't walk away no
[1:15:25] more when the word found me I could
[1:15:27] participate in the bride's Revival oh
[1:15:29] there's many isms in the message there's
[1:15:31] there's a thunder this and I was scared
[1:15:32] to death sometimes I thought well can I
[1:15:34] get up here and say that the Thunders
[1:15:35] was in this absolutely brother brandham
[1:15:37] said it I can say it I don't have to say
[1:15:39] well maybe the maybe the Revival hasn't
[1:15:41] started no no I remember those days of
[1:15:43] wondering which quotes can I believe
[1:15:45] well I learned I could just believe it
[1:15:46] all Brother David I can believe
[1:15:47] everything a prophet said I can say what
[1:15:50] a prophet said on those tapes I can't
[1:15:52] believe it because there's something on
[1:15:54] the inside that won't let me go can you
[1:15:56] say
[1:15:57] Amen brother said what we have now he
[1:15:59] said the world Satan and the deceiver
[1:16:01] who deceived the first bride so uh to
[1:16:03] sinning against God by misbelieving his
[1:16:05] word and now today as we see the church
[1:16:07] natural in your intellectual gospel
[1:16:09] going further and further away from the
[1:16:11] word in some social gospel we find that
[1:16:14] the women of the world on the streets
[1:16:17] members of such is carrying themselves
[1:16:19] in the same
[1:16:20] atmosphere oh come on somebody you see
[1:16:23] you ever see a modern you ever see see a
[1:16:25] modern a modern Church woman they say
[1:16:27] well I'm I'm modest and they've got
[1:16:29] their blue jeans on and so tight that if
[1:16:30] they bend over they'll bust them
[1:16:32] out and they they got a neckline so low
[1:16:35] that they leave I tell you what I I
[1:16:37] think we need to be thankful for The
[1:16:38] Godly women we have in this message I
[1:16:41] think well I'm glad I'm glad for them I
[1:16:43] tell you what the wor the worst of us is
[1:16:45] better than what they got out there I I
[1:16:47] I know sometimes we want to there maybe
[1:16:49] there's things we need to work on but
[1:16:50] I'm just going to say it right now there
[1:16:51] there may be some things we need to work
[1:16:52] on but we're better than what they've
[1:16:54] got going on I'm not saying we're better
[1:16:55] than they are as people because we're
[1:16:57] all Sinners saved by grace but do you
[1:16:59] realize what God has done for us in this
[1:17:01] day you don't dress good because you're
[1:17:03] scared to go to hell you dress good
[1:17:05] because something on the inside is
[1:17:06] revealing itself oh come on somebody
[1:17:09] this is a revealing of the Bride in this
[1:17:11] age there is a revealing of the word in
[1:17:12] this age it's a time for the bride to go
[1:17:15] ahead and put on the garments well can
[1:17:17] you say Amen it's time for the bride to
[1:17:19] realize who she is she is not somebody
[1:17:21] that's going to fall she is not a bride
[1:17:23] of yesterday but she is the bride the
[1:17:26] final voice to the final age the final
[1:17:28] Bride on the earth she's going to go in
[1:17:30] a Rapture she even listen church I told
[1:17:33] you a while ago we don't have to worry
[1:17:34] about death you say well what if you
[1:17:36] would drop dead tomorrow if I drop dead
[1:17:38] tomorrow I'll see you in a Rapture
[1:17:40] brother Bill I don't care which way we
[1:17:41] go whichever way we go we are going to
[1:17:44] come up with that generation we're going
[1:17:46] to come up with that bride generation
[1:17:48] the final bride why because the voice of
[1:17:50] the Resurrection is already in you to
[1:17:53] speak and call things as though they're
[1:17:55] not as though they are I say we need to
[1:17:57] just participate in it in the bride's
[1:17:59] Revival I say The Awakening is here the
[1:18:02] bride look listen I believe the bride is
[1:18:03] awake now he said those other groups
[1:18:05] failed to see The Awakening of the Bride
[1:18:07] why because it wasn't a show well can
[1:18:09] you say man this third poll was of no
[1:18:12] show it wasn't something where there was
[1:18:13] big campaigns anymore there was no more
[1:18:15] brother Brandon going out and putting
[1:18:17] his hand on people and the and the
[1:18:18] things on his hands no let me get to my
[1:18:20] point here this morning there was a
[1:18:22] third pull that came and the third pole
[1:18:24] was catching the the big fish it wasn't
[1:18:26] catching a denominational chicken it
[1:18:27] wasn't catching somebody out of this
[1:18:29] group or that group but it was catching
[1:18:31] the elect for the hour that they could
[1:18:33] come and see the message revealed in
[1:18:35] their day can you say amen I think we
[1:18:38] need to just go ahead and take the
[1:18:40] gloves off sometimes and just go ahead
[1:18:41] and say it like it is we don't have to
[1:18:42] worry about what our children are going
[1:18:44] to do because we believe that God has
[1:18:47] ordained us and our households to take
[1:18:50] the land in this day and I believe that
[1:18:52] we are in the land of promise that is
[1:18:54] the message of the hour can you say
[1:18:57] Amen I'm not well I know some of y'all
[1:18:59] say why do you preach the message I'm
[1:19:01] gonna tell you why I preach the message
[1:19:02] because according to the Bible this was
[1:19:05] what was to take place just before the
[1:19:07] burning right do you remember what we
[1:19:09] read there at the beginning there's
[1:19:11] going to be all there's going to be
[1:19:12] there won't be root nor Branch there'll
[1:19:13] be it'll be burned as an oven there'll
[1:19:15] be nothing left it'll be stubble it'll
[1:19:16] be nothing left but there is a people
[1:19:19] who will grow up as calves in the stall
[1:19:21] well can you say Amen why because
[1:19:23] they've been feasting on man from
[1:19:25] above you remember the story about the
[1:19:27] Cavs brother Bram talks about he said
[1:19:29] there was two barns there was a farmer
[1:19:31] on one side of the road and a farmer on
[1:19:32] the other and they had the two calvs and
[1:19:33] you had one that they had that that
[1:19:35] little calf that was just run down and
[1:19:37] starved to death and then there was that
[1:19:39] other calf that had been fed the
[1:19:40] alphalpha and the good things of God and
[1:19:42] it come out of the barn and he said it
[1:19:44] was fat and happy and he come out there
[1:19:46] and he said it was dancing and clicking
[1:19:47] its heels to well come on somebody we
[1:19:49] can have we can have church this morning
[1:19:51] it's okay with me so what he said that
[1:19:53] calf come out of there that calf had
[1:19:55] been eating good well can you say amen I
[1:19:57] think somebody here has been eating good
[1:19:58] this morning I'm not talking about
[1:20:00] physically although y'all are about to
[1:20:02] want me to quit so you can do that but
[1:20:04] let me go ahead and just say it like
[1:20:05] this if you've been eating on the things
[1:20:06] of God if you've been eating the open
[1:20:09] book well can you say Amen if you're
[1:20:10] eating the open book then I believe the
[1:20:12] open book will come back out of your
[1:20:13] mouth and you will speak as the Oracles
[1:20:16] of God you have a voice why because it's
[1:20:18] not a closed book anymore you can't
[1:20:20] speak as a denomination you can't speak
[1:20:22] as someone from the past but you are
[1:20:24] speaking speaking as the present tense
[1:20:26] body of Christ on the Earth today God is
[1:20:29] speaking through you God has raised up a
[1:20:31] body that could be his voice today can
[1:20:33] you say amen God has raised up you for
[1:20:36] such a time as this God has brought you
[1:20:38] to this moment because he knew you could
[1:20:41] overcome as I said Wednesday night to
[1:20:43] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:20:45] in in my Throne not on it but in my
[1:20:47] Throne you'll be in the same throne room
[1:20:49] you are with him can you sayen but it's
[1:20:51] to the Overcomers it's to the ones how
[1:20:54] many's going to make it here this
[1:20:55] morning how manyan he's going all the
[1:20:56] way then go ahead and say I raise up a
[1:20:59] standard today I'll be the standard of
[1:21:02] the message of the hour I'm not going to
[1:21:04] let somebody else try to be my standard
[1:21:06] I'm not going to let somebody else try
[1:21:07] to be the voice but I'm going to be the
[1:21:09] voice today I'm going to be the standard
[1:21:12] today what can you say
[1:21:14] amen God has called you for a time as
[1:21:17] this such a time as this right brother B
[1:21:20] says it like
[1:21:21] this he said they're going further and
[1:21:23] further away from the word in a social
[1:21:26] gospel they've lost all sense of common
[1:21:29] decency the people have see now this is
[1:21:32] not to you but I want you to know that
[1:21:35] by prophecy of what the world will do
[1:21:36] you can see where you are I'm not trying
[1:21:39] to tell you you're going this way you're
[1:21:40] not going down you're going up can you
[1:21:42] say amen amen I'm not I I believe
[1:21:44] brother brand said keep the promises
[1:21:45] over the people I believe we're going to
[1:21:46] do that I'm not here to preach Doom and
[1:21:48] Gloom to you because I believe everyone
[1:21:50] in here is going to make it well can you
[1:21:52] sayen I I don't believe that this is a
[1:21:54] Time to tell all of our people well you

[1:21:58] are you wouldn't be here I say we might
[1:22:00] as well just go ahead and say you are
[1:22:01] the elect of this generation you are the
[1:22:03] called out you are the bride you are the
[1:22:06] final voice you are Mrs Jesus Christ in
[1:22:09] this
[1:22:10] day he said but then watch
[1:22:12] out he said again the spiritual church
[1:22:15] now he said how that group of people's
[1:22:17] called out and the elected through every
[1:22:19] Revival in Martin Luther it happened the
[1:22:21] same way in the Reformation it happened
[1:22:22] the same thing in the time of John
[1:22:23] Wesley it happened the the same thing
[1:22:25] when Pentecostal first started they
[1:22:27] dropped them women right back in line
[1:22:28] with the word and then they drift away
[1:22:31] and he said there she goes right back
[1:22:33] over in the chaos but then the time that
[1:22:35] the people are ready to line up there is
[1:22:38] a message that comes forth and they line
[1:22:41] with it can you say Amen there is a
[1:22:43] message that has come
[1:22:45] forth can I I I wanted to say this one
[1:22:48] more time so maybe you'll catch it with
[1:22:51] the time that the people are ready to
[1:22:52] line up so when you're ready the message
[1:22:56] comes forth and you will line up with it
[1:22:59] well can you say amen I I don't believe
[1:23:01] we have to the message is right on time
[1:23:03] brother Danny you say well why didn't
[1:23:04] they have it earlier in the it was right
[1:23:06] on time because there had to be a people
[1:23:08] that was willing to participate in a
[1:23:10] word revival can you say Amen there had
[1:23:12] to be a people to realize that this
[1:23:13] world's going down but I'm ready to go
[1:23:15] up this world's going down but I will
[1:23:18] not die I shall be changed can you say
[1:23:21] amen I believe that with all my heart
[1:23:24] yes sir we don't have to worry about
[1:23:26] going down in this tribulation that's
[1:23:28] coming can you say Amen but he said then
[1:23:31] watch again he said the spiritual church
[1:23:33] and then every time that the message
[1:23:35] comes they line with it now brother BR
[1:23:37] goes on down here and he says now
[1:23:39] friends go back with me where is the
[1:23:41] first where did the first Revival come
[1:23:43] after the death the days when the grain
[1:23:46] of wheat had to fall in the ground the
[1:23:48] body of the Bride the body the bride of
[1:23:50] Christ he said Christ organized his no
[1:23:53] excuse me Christ didn't organize his
[1:23:54] bride he said is that right his church
[1:23:56] he never organized it he just sets
[1:23:58] Apostles and Prophets and so forth in
[1:24:00] the church to keep it clean can you say
[1:24:02] Amen well so that means if you get
[1:24:04] somebody that comes in here and just
[1:24:05] kind of preaches it straight we can't we
[1:24:06] might as well just say Amen to it I
[1:24:08] remember a preacher that used to say he
[1:24:10] used to say say Amen or oh me but say
[1:24:12] something and so brother brother BR
[1:24:15] would go on like this he said he said he
[1:24:17] just sets things uh to to keep it in or
[1:24:19] in in order excuse me can't talk this
[1:24:21] morning he said he said he said just set
[1:24:24] Apostles and so forth and they organized
[1:24:26] it made an organization is that right he
[1:24:27] said and it died everything that didn't
[1:24:29] agree with that church was put to death
[1:24:31] now we know if you ever read read the
[1:24:32] fox's book of Martyrs you know some of
[1:24:34] this about how if you didn't agree with
[1:24:36] them man you were you were out you were
[1:24:37] you weren't in the church aren't you
[1:24:39] glad we're not that way now well is
[1:24:41] anybody that way now if you don't agree
[1:24:44] with me or my church we're out of here
[1:24:46] if you don't agree with me I'll tell you
[1:24:47] what I'll I'll skip town you know
[1:24:50] whatever you'll come back when you
[1:24:52] realize you line up with the word right
[1:24:54] that's right he said when you hear the
[1:24:55] message you will line up to it so
[1:24:57] brother R said and it died everything
[1:24:58] that didn't agree with that church was
[1:25:00] put to death and it laid still for
[1:25:01] hundreds of years in the dirt but after
[1:25:04] a while up she come in Luther the first
[1:25:07] little sprigs of corn come up the second
[1:25:09] it buted out from there and they went on
[1:25:11] they had zwingle and so forth and other
[1:25:13] organizations and he said so forth and
[1:25:15] after a while he come uh Anglican along
[1:25:18] and what happened he said here come
[1:25:19] Wesley and there was a Revival in the
[1:25:21] tossel and that looks a little more like
[1:25:22] the wheat and then what happened to that
[1:25:24] it organized and dried up and died the
[1:25:26] life went right into a Shook and the Shu
[1:25:29] come forth almost perfectly like the
[1:25:31] wheat but finally its Folly was made
[1:25:33] manifest in the last eight or 10 years
[1:25:35] especially in the last in the last three
[1:25:37] years he says he says now what does it
[1:25:39] do pull away from the wheat now why
[1:25:42] hasn't there been an organization start
[1:25:44] up in these last 20 years of this great
[1:25:45] Revival it's anointed prophets anointed
[1:25:47] teachers and so forth but why ain't
[1:25:49] there there is nothing Beyond The Grain
[1:25:51] well can you say Amen there's nothing
[1:25:53] more to come there's no this can't die
[1:25:55] because there's not going to be another
[1:25:56] Revival start up can you say Amen this
[1:25:59] cannot die so he said there's nothing
[1:26:00] Beyond The Grain see it's back without
[1:26:02] an organization he said oh my a blind
[1:26:05] man can see that it cannot organize it's
[1:26:07] so firmly against it it's the grain of
[1:26:09] wheat itself the son of man will be made
[1:26:11] manifest the grain of wheat will come
[1:26:13] back to itself again and the son of man
[1:26:15] in the last days there will come false
[1:26:17] impersonations of it in the last days
[1:26:19] that'll almost deceive the elected if
[1:26:20] possible look at their organizational
[1:26:22] Shucks pulling away now he said it only
[1:26:24] let the wheat be known to the elected
[1:26:25] which part of it now I know it's a lot
[1:26:27] of reading but I'm getting somewhere and
[1:26:29] then I'll close I'm out out of time
[1:26:31] almost notice how beautiful this is I'll
[1:26:33] never get this finished today but we'll
[1:26:34] be okay he said the anointed he said
[1:26:37] notice the anointed prophets will be
[1:26:38] false there will there will be among it
[1:26:40] will be true anointed how how how you
[1:26:42] going to tell it by the word well can
[1:26:43] you say Amen how you going to know it if
[1:26:45] you got a prophet over here prophesying
[1:26:46] and a prophet over here prophesying
[1:26:48] brother if it doesn't line up with the
[1:26:49] word leave it alone I don't care how
[1:26:52] anointed they are I don't care how right
[1:26:54] they look if they're off the word leave
[1:26:57] it alone say well I I appreciate you for
[1:27:00] trying but I'm going to stay with the
[1:27:01] word of God well don't listen to that
[1:27:04] deceiver that's trying to tell you to go
[1:27:05] ahead and eat a little bit of this tree
[1:27:07] let's go back here and just do a little
[1:27:08] bit no stay like that first Eve stay
[1:27:10] true to what God has given you in this
[1:27:12] day you've got a whole garden full
[1:27:14] you've got herbs everywhere you've got
[1:27:16] meat in the storehouse you've got
[1:27:18] everything you have need of but what
[1:27:20] you've got to do is eat of the true word
[1:27:23] that has been given and not something
[1:27:25] that is to come or something that has
[1:27:27] been you'll get sick to your stomach but
[1:27:29] if you'll believe on God and His word
[1:27:31] for this day you will be an overcomer in
[1:27:35] this Pride's revival can you say Amen
[1:27:37] now I believe that the signs follow them
[1:27:39] that believe can you say amen I I just
[1:27:41] don't believe that we follow the signs I
[1:27:42] believe that I believe that we follow
[1:27:44] that the word follows or the signs
[1:27:46] follow the word can you say amen I I I
[1:27:48] don't believe that that we should leave
[1:27:49] the word to follow a sign now if it's in
[1:27:51] the word then amen praise God for it but
[1:27:53] if it's outside the word I said leave it
[1:27:55] alone can you say Amen Mark 16:15 said
[1:27:58] go into all the world and preach the
[1:27:59] gospel Every Creature he that believeth
[1:28:01] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[1:28:03] that believeth not shall be damned and
[1:28:04] these signs shall follow them that
[1:28:06] believe the Believers that's who the
[1:28:08] signs are following not somebody else
[1:28:10] but it's following you it's following
[1:28:11] the believer how many Believers are here
[1:28:13] this morning it's foll the signs are
[1:28:15] following you you're not following the
[1:28:17] signs can you say amen and these signs
[1:28:19] shall follow them they shall cast out
[1:28:20] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:28:21] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:28:23] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:28:25] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:28:26] and they shall recover I I know people
[1:28:28] say we don't need altar calls anymore I
[1:28:30] know people say we don't need prayer
[1:28:31] lines anymore I know some people say we
[1:28:33] don't need to lay hands on the sick
[1:28:34] anymore but I'd like to go ahead and
[1:28:36] just remind you that that is a
[1:28:37] commission to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:39] that is the commission to the people of
[1:28:41] this day if you have a need we lay hands
[1:28:43] on you and we believe that God is going
[1:28:45] to do what he promised in his word it's
[1:28:47] not an emotion it's not a workup well he
[1:28:49] didn't pray what I wanted him to pray
[1:28:51] but the Bible said he laid hands on him
[1:28:52] he may not even have to pray for you but
[1:28:54] if you'll just believe that the word is
[1:28:56] true you don't have to worry about what
[1:28:58] the man said when he was praying did he
[1:29:00] lay hands on you did the Bible say for
[1:29:03] him to do it then believe that the word
[1:29:05] still works in this revival can you say
[1:29:08] Amen sir he said they shall take up
[1:29:11] serpents drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:29:13] not hurt them that don't mean you go
[1:29:15] pick up serpents and become a snake
[1:29:16] handling church
[1:29:18] Hallelujah we tried to go to one once
[1:29:20] when I was a kid we went there and they
[1:29:22] were closed is that yeah Sneedville
[1:29:23] Tennessee yeah we went there we were
[1:29:25] trying to go to this snake handling
[1:29:26] church because we want to try something
[1:29:27] new you know what I mean we want to try
[1:29:28] something different I guarantee it would
[1:29:29] have been be like Wendy Bagwell where's
[1:29:31] the back door there ain't one I'll make
[1:29:33] one but we'll
[1:29:35] but
[1:29:37] sorry but we didn't make it in because
[1:29:39] somebody was sick and couldn't be a
[1:29:40] church that night thank the Lord
[1:29:41] probably got snake bit you know and so
[1:29:44] we didn't get to go in and
[1:29:46] experience them taking the word and
[1:29:48] doing their thing with
[1:29:50] it but we don't have to tempt God in
[1:29:52] that way can you say Amen we don't go
[1:29:56] out here and look for trouble just to
[1:29:59] see we don't go out here and and and
[1:30:00] drink something bad for our bodies make
[1:30:02] ourselves sick and then say well now I
[1:30:04] I'm going to get healed because I I need
[1:30:06] a miracle in my life well that's that's
[1:30:08] pretty
[1:30:10] stupid
[1:30:12] sorry unfiltered this morning I
[1:30:15] apologize left over from last
[1:30:18] week now the signs follow them that
[1:30:21] believe we don't follow the signs is
[1:30:24] that okay is that okay I believe in the
[1:30:26] signs remember the word never said there
[1:30:28] would be no signs the word never said
[1:30:30] that we would we would we would not lay
[1:30:32] hands on the sick and I my brother said
[1:30:34] this before and I'll just go ahead and
[1:30:36] repeat it he said if brother Brandon was
[1:30:38] here and he had a prayer line we'd all
[1:30:39] be participating in
[1:30:40] it but if he but he's not here so we
[1:30:42] want to fight about it and say well we
[1:30:43] don't need prayer lines anymore I say
[1:30:45] that everything that God gave the church
[1:30:47] let's go ahead and and participate in it
[1:30:50] he come with a church order to set
[1:30:51] things in order but that didn't put
[1:30:53] things out of the church was to set
[1:30:54] things order in the church can you say
[1:30:56] Amen see he wasn't he was a word Prophet
[1:30:58] brother Bill so he couldn't take parts
[1:31:00] of the word and do away with it we had
[1:31:02] to keep the word but he just put it in
[1:31:04] order so so what it is you'll find that
[1:31:06] he was just like Paul in that regard he
[1:31:08] saw things were getting a little out of
[1:31:09] order and he needed to come back and set
[1:31:10] it in order in the church he was not
[1:31:12] unscriptural in any way and listen we
[1:31:14] don't follow brother Brandon because of
[1:31:16] the man he was I I believe he was a
[1:31:17] great man he didn't smoke or drink and
[1:31:19] and all these things he's a great man we
[1:31:21] don't follow the man we follow the
[1:31:23] message that he he sent he said don't
[1:31:25] don't look for me don't look to me look
[1:31:26] at the message it's it's God it's Christ
[1:31:29] it's it's Christ all the time he said
[1:31:31] it's not me it's not William Brandon
[1:31:32] that's doing these things but he said
[1:31:34] it's the one that's not standing 10 feet
[1:31:35] from me or what however far it was it's
[1:31:38] the one standing there with me he's the
[1:31:39] one doing the work brother Bill that
[1:31:41] same God if it had been brother brandom
[1:31:43] we would have no hope this morning
[1:31:45] because he's dead and buried in a grave
[1:31:46] in Jeffersonville but because it was God
[1:31:48] in brother brandom that same God could
[1:31:51] come right here this morning and do the
[1:31:53] same thing that that Prophet
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:56] did not looking for the gift to come
[1:31:59] again we already saw the gift and it was
[1:32:00] Vindicated and and a word follow of the
[1:32:02] gift can you say Amen we're not looking
[1:32:04] at the gift even now I believe oh I love
[1:32:06] listening to prayer line tapes and I
[1:32:07] love to hear what brother random said on
[1:32:08] it and I love to hear the discernment
[1:32:10] it's faith building I do love to hear it
[1:32:12] but that's not what's going to get me
[1:32:13] ready for the Rapture that was just to
[1:32:15] get my attention to what the word would
[1:32:17] say that's just to get my attention to
[1:32:19] say come out I HT my people because if
[1:32:21] you can get somebody's attention they'll
[1:32:23] follow you for a little bit if you can
[1:32:24] get somebody's attention then maybe the
[1:32:26] word will have an effect on the people
[1:32:28] well are you hearing me this morning if
[1:32:30] you can get the people's attention
[1:32:31] that's all the first poll was to do but
[1:32:34] we see the third poll is the
[1:32:36] manifestation of the word in human lives
[1:32:39] today it is the opening of the word and
[1:32:41] the revealing of the word today well can
[1:32:44] you say Amen I've got five minutes left
[1:32:46] is that okay he said reminds me of a
[1:32:48] story there was a great Welsh Revival
[1:32:50] some great man here in the nation
[1:32:51] thought they would go over and see the
[1:32:53] Welsh Revival
[1:32:54] I hope this is okay I know I'm not a
[1:32:56] teacher I I'm not even much I'm not even
[1:32:58] a preacher but you'll get a good
[1:32:59] preacher tonight so just hang with me
[1:33:01] for five
[1:33:02] minutes and
[1:33:04] uh and if I save some some of my voice
[1:33:07] I'll pull on brother Stewart real hard
[1:33:09] tonight he said the great Welsh Revival
[1:33:11] was
[1:33:12] on and there was there was some great
[1:33:15] men here in the nation thought they
[1:33:16] would go over and see the Welsh Revival
[1:33:19] what would be taking place and as they
[1:33:20] went over to find out they see that what
[1:33:23] building it was H in when they got to
[1:33:25] Wales they went around and begin to ask
[1:33:27] about where the building was and they
[1:33:28] seen this happy little officer now I
[1:33:30] would like to underline
[1:33:33] happy
[1:33:35] because this was a person in revival can
[1:33:37] you say
[1:33:38] amen and he he was on the job so he may
[1:33:41] not have felt like he was in Revival he
[1:33:43] had to work that day but he's but he's
[1:33:47] happy can you say amen amen he's said
[1:33:51] well all right he said uh he said he
[1:33:54] said this happy little officer standing
[1:33:55] on the corner with his little Tommy hat
[1:33:57] on and was swinging his Club around and
[1:33:59] around like that these men walked up to
[1:34:02] him and said sir could you tell me what
[1:34:04] building the W Revival is held in he
[1:34:06] said yes sir I'm it I'm it I think
[1:34:09] that's what sometimes I wonder well can
[1:34:11] you tell me what church you belong to
[1:34:12] well I Church up here on the hill we
[1:34:15] don't even want to tell them what church
[1:34:16] we go to because we're scared to death
[1:34:17] of the mess that we're representing what
[1:34:19] can you say Amen but if you were Baptist
[1:34:21] you'd say well I go to the Baptist
[1:34:22] Church right y i when I ask people I
[1:34:24] work for where they go to church they
[1:34:25] always tell me but if I ask a message
[1:34:27] person they don't even want to tell me
[1:34:29] and I'm in the
[1:34:32] message well I go to brother so and so's
[1:34:35] Church well who is
[1:34:36] he well let me just go ahead and tell
[1:34:38] you something I'm not ashamed of the
[1:34:39] message of the hour I'm not ashamed of
[1:34:42] what I believe because it's the only
[1:34:45] reason I can stand here this morning
[1:34:47] listen you say well if you didn't have
[1:34:49] the message you wouldn't have nothing to
[1:34:50] preach you're exactly right I don't want
[1:34:52] to preach nothing but this message
[1:34:54] I don't want to preach what Dr Dobson
[1:34:56] said or somebody else I don't want to
[1:34:57] preach what even some other message
[1:34:59] preacher would say I want to say what
[1:35:01] the message of the hour says and then
[1:35:03] I'm under the authority to speak it and
[1:35:06] believe that the word will go to work
[1:35:08] and it will bring things to pass that
[1:35:10] need to come to pass in this church this
[1:35:11] morning if I come with my own opinion
[1:35:14] and try to tell you things listen God
[1:35:16] won't anoint that God won't back that up
[1:35:18] but what God will do is he'll say he'll
[1:35:20] say just preach the word brother said
[1:35:21] preach the word and the Bible says pre
[1:35:23] preach the word be instant in season and
[1:35:25] out of season and listen I I want to
[1:35:28] stay with what the word says because
[1:35:30] outside of the word brother Justin I
[1:35:32] have no reason to be standing in this
[1:35:34] Pulpit outside of the word I don't need
[1:35:36] to go to a church outside of the word
[1:35:39] there's nothing left for me but what
[1:35:41] I've got now is a hope because the word
[1:35:43] has come and it's manifesting itself in
[1:35:45] my life and it's manifesting itself in
[1:35:47] your life Amen brother the Jay it's
[1:35:49] manifesting itself through young men
[1:35:50] today it's manifesting itself through
[1:35:52] young preachers and if the Lord terries
[1:35:54] I hope that God raises up young men
[1:35:56] right out of this front row here to
[1:35:57] carry this gospel on to the coming of
[1:35:59] the Lord why because the message and the
[1:36:01] Revival will not die can you say Amen as
[1:36:05] long as this L as long as the Lord
[1:36:07] terries there's got to be somebody to
[1:36:09] preach this message and there will be
[1:36:11] because he brought the message in due
[1:36:13] season when you could accept it when
[1:36:15] there would be somebody to take it I'll
[1:36:17] tell you what it's like the old story
[1:36:18] they were putting them logs down in the
[1:36:20] river and he said I'm riding on it I
[1:36:21] tell you I'm riding on the message of
[1:36:22] the hour this morning morning I'm not
[1:36:24] here to just sit back and look at it I'm
[1:36:26] not here to sit back and say well that
[1:36:28] was good for brother brandham or that
[1:36:30] was good for for some somebody else or

[1:36:38] for the bride why because we're riding
[1:36:40] on the message of the hour the Revival
[1:36:43] is on I believe that the bride is
[1:36:45] awakened now because those Thunders have
[1:36:48] been revealed the the Thunders and the
[1:36:50] re and the seals have been revealed and
[1:36:51] I believe that this is the hour we can

[1:36:57] revival can you say Amen I'm almost done
[1:37:01] almost I just want to stop
[1:37:03] here with this and say the move is on
[1:37:06] for the bride now brother brandham says
[1:37:08] this in recognizing your day in this
[1:37:11] message
[1:37:13] 1964 he said some of you people that
[1:37:16] really believe this to be the truth how
[1:37:17] many's there how many's here this
[1:37:18] morning that really believes this
[1:37:19] message to be the truth not what I told
[1:37:21] you but what the message of the hour has
[1:37:22] said
[1:37:25] amen he said you know the church can't
[1:37:27] go in its condition and it can't get any
[1:37:30] better it must get worse that's a solemn
[1:37:33] thought it's a sober sobering statement
[1:37:36] he's making here but he goes on sir it's
[1:37:40] got to get worse and it can't go like
[1:37:41] this see it's got to be something and
[1:37:44] it's moving right now friend can you say
[1:37:47] amen he said it's on the move is on for
[1:37:51] the bride that's the truth that's the th
[1:37:54] sayith the Lord oh when a prophet speaks
[1:37:56] thus sayith the Lord why don't we just
[1:37:57] say what he said and believe it when a
[1:37:59] prophet said the move is on for the
[1:38:01] bride I say yes I'm going to participate
[1:38:03] in this bride's revival can you say amen
[1:38:06] I I believe the move is on for you
[1:38:07] Brother David I believe the move is on
[1:38:09] for you brother brother Mike I believe
[1:38:11] the move is on why because we are in the
[1:38:13] bride we don't look back to what has
[1:38:15] been but we're looking forward we're
[1:38:18] pressing towards the Mark we believe
[1:38:20] that all things are ready for the feast
[1:38:22] and we are participating in a Revival
[1:38:25] that is not going to leave us with our
[1:38:27] heads hung down but we're looking up
