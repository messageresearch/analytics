[46:20] we pray in jesus name amen
[46:24] amen do you love him this morning isn't
[46:27] it good to be in the house of the lord
[46:30] amen we'll turn to first john chapter
[46:32] one we'll just read verse seven
[46:34] good to have everybody out in the house
[46:35] of the lord this morning and got some
[46:37] visitors this morning it's good to have
[46:39] you all with us
[46:40] and uh it's always good to see all of
[46:42] you some of you i
[46:43] i only get to see especially with the
[46:46] pandemic on and things
[46:47] going like they are and i only get to
[46:49] see you on sundays but it just brings
[46:51] such
[46:51] joy to our hearts to see your face and
[46:54] to know you're still in the battle
[46:55] you're still
[46:56] by the jp on the firing line and that
[46:58] means something to see you here and
[47:00] we thank you for coming amen first john
[47:03] chapter 1 and verse 7
[47:05] but if we walk in the light as he is
[47:08] in the light we have fellowship one with
[47:12] another and the blood of jesus christ
[47:15] his son
[47:16] cleanseth us from all sin
[47:20] amen what a promise that is this morning
[47:23] you may
[47:24] be seated lord at his blessing to the
[47:27] word
[47:29] i'm going to be speaking some from the
[47:31] lord willing from a message
[47:33] brother branham preached december 30th
[47:35] 1962 and then he preached it several
[47:37] times on the absolute
[47:39] and we'll be taking some scriptures and
[47:41] things and today kind of a precursor to
[47:43] that
[47:44] but i encourage you to listen or read
[47:45] that sermon if you get a chance
[47:49] there's several reasons why we'll have
[47:51] someone preach for us here
[47:53] thank you brother danny i appreciate
[47:56] that i appreciate good deacons taking
[47:57] care of me
[47:59] i'm taking care of all of you as well
[48:03] there's several reasons i'll let someone
[48:05] bring a message from the pulpit here
[48:07] the main reason because i believe
[48:09] they'll help you
[48:11] and i we've had a couple of ministers in
[48:13] lately and
[48:14] i believe that they've been a help to
[48:16] the congregation and
[48:17] and it's completely different styles but
[48:20] god uses evangelists god still has
[48:22] teachers god still uses different parts
[48:25] of the fivefold ministry to bless the
[48:26] bride and we thank god for that and
[48:29] and but it got me thinking about some
[48:30] things and and
[48:32] there may be times you wonder why i let
[48:34] someone preach sometimes you wonder why
[48:36] i preach i'm sure
[48:37] but i've told someone i don't preach in
[48:39] spite of this message i preach because
[48:41] of this message
[48:43] and you know and and we find we have
[48:46] different ministries
[48:47] in and i believe they're a benefit to
[48:48] the bride of christ that's the main
[48:50] reason i believe that our ministers here
[48:52] but the spirit brother allen
[48:53] are a help to the body of christ and so
[48:56] i want to give them
[48:56] opportunity whenever i can but the
[48:58] steward will be preaching wednesday
[48:59] night
[49:00] i want to give them opportunity while
[49:02] they're able to to preach for us
[49:03] and they'll preach other places as well
[49:07] another reason why i would have someone
[49:09] preach sometimes is to help the preacher
[49:12] and that's to give an opportunity
[49:13] especially to a young minister to preach
[49:15] because
[49:16] how are they ever going to learn how to
[49:17] stand on the pulpit and deliver the word
[49:19] of god it's a fearful thing
[49:21] to stand in the pulpit and deliver the
[49:23] word of god i still tremble when i walk
[49:25] into the pulpit after all these years
[49:28] and so i know that uh i want you got to
[49:31] give them time for that gift to grow and
[49:33] so we want to do that when we can and
[49:36] the other reason is brotherly kindness
[49:38] or respect
[49:39] we would have someone preached sometimes
[49:41] out of brotherly kindness maybe they
[49:42] wouldn't be the best preacher in the
[49:44] world but it would be
[49:45] but john's good to have you today as
[49:47] well good to see you here
[49:48] and but we'd have just someone because
[49:51] we respect them or brotherly kindness
[49:53] and that's a valid reason to have
[49:55] someone preach because we can be a help
[49:57] you realize you're a help to the
[49:58] preacher
[50:00] this congregation has been such a help
[50:01] to me and and it means a lot to have you
[50:05] here
[50:05] and and to be able to see you but even
[50:07] those that are watching when i can see
[50:09] that you're watching i
[50:10] i appreciate that i it means a lot to me
[50:13] disfellowship is not a badge of honor
[50:18] there is no crown that is given out for
[50:21] not fellowshipping
[50:23] for being the person that was the least
[50:26] fellowship
[50:26] person in the world or in the message
[50:30] and sometimes we act like it is and i
[50:32] say we i use that term loosely i know
[50:35] you're a friendly church and we're a
[50:36] friendly church but
[50:37] but you know we'll sometimes people will
[50:40] uh disfellowship from brothers over
[50:43] something that
[50:44] they both believe the same message they
[50:46] both believe the same bible
[50:47] but they'll disfellowship over something
[50:49] that is uh
[50:51] really minor and you have to be able to
[50:53] invite to divide those things
[50:55] that's part of rightly dividing the word
[50:57] but they'll take something and
[50:59] every word of god is essential but the
[51:00] random told us that but only the word of
[51:02] god is essential
[51:04] so it makes sense to my opinion about
[51:05] the word of god is not essential
[51:08] but every word of god is essential
[51:11] so this fellowship's not a badge of
[51:13] honor doesn't mean
[51:15] there was no messenger that wanted to
[51:16] cut himself off from
[51:18] the denomination of the group that he
[51:19] was in he was forced out
[51:22] always because he preached the truth
[51:25] and if someone is going to leave let it
[51:27] be because we stand for truth not
[51:29] because
[51:30] we just were rude or or because we had
[51:32] some little difference about something
[51:34] that
[51:35] we both believe the same message but
[51:36] there's some little idea that we have
[51:38] that we can't even back up with the word
[51:40] and
[51:40] they can't either why would we
[51:42] dis-fellowship over that
[51:44] right there would be no reason to do
[51:46] that and so we try not to disfellowship
[51:49] with people if there will be a
[51:50] i don't know if the crowd when the
[51:52] crowds are given out if there'll be a
[51:53] crown for fellowshipping
[51:54] but it's much more likely than there
[51:56] being one for disfellowshipping
[52:02] john wesley said it this way he said i
[52:04] want the whole christ
[52:05] for my savior the whole bible for my
[52:08] book
[52:10] and the whole church for my fellowship
[52:13] and the whole world for my mission field
[52:18] we should never be unfriendly there's no
[52:19] excuse for that
[52:21] i've been to message churches that where
[52:24] no one greeted you at all you go to
[52:26] church and
[52:27] show up no one shook your hand no one
[52:28] acknowledged you were there then you
[52:30] leave that didn't hurt my feelings it's
[52:32] just wrong
[52:35] because we should love to see one
[52:36] another and if you know i heard a story
[52:39] about a
[52:40] man who was traveling overseas and he's
[52:42] in south korea and
[52:43] where philip is and he was traveling
[52:45] through south korea there's a lot of
[52:46] christian people there
[52:48] and as he was traveling he sat down at a
[52:50] bus stop and a man sat down beside him
[52:52] had a bundle
[52:53] wrapped up in his hand and he started
[52:55] speaking to him in korean and the man
[52:57] only knew one
[52:57] line of korean and that said i don't
[52:59] understand korean
[53:01] and so he told him that and he just kept
[53:03] trying to talk to him trying to talk to
[53:04] him
[53:04] and finally he looked at him and he said
[53:07] jesus in korean whatever that would be
[53:08] and
[53:09] he understood that he said yes yes he
[53:12] pointed
[53:12] the man he had a korean bible and he
[53:14] pulled it open and he
[53:15] come to the scripture where it says that
[53:17] by this shall we know
[53:19] that oh that you're my disciples the
[53:20] world will know that you're my disciples
[53:21] because you have love one for another.
[53:24] by this shall all men know it and so
[53:26] they had fellowship there on the bus
[53:28] stop
[53:29] even though they were from different
[53:30] countries and spoke different languages
[53:32] but they had something in common
[53:35] something in common and so we've got
[53:38] something in common today and yet
[53:40] the greatest deception the world will
[53:42] ever know is based around fellowship
[53:45] that's the doctrine of balaam right it
[53:47] says we're all the same
[53:49] we're not all the same right so there
[53:52] are essentials to what we believe
[53:54] there's things that we believe that we
[53:55] have to stand on
[53:58] there's things we believe and i got
[53:59] thinking about that and i thought you
[54:00] know
[54:01] there's some things that we we have to
[54:03] believe
[54:05] in order to have any kind of real
[54:06] fellowship and we believe in the
[54:08] inerrancy of scripture
[54:10] we believe that the word of god is true
[54:12] that this bible is
[54:14] the inerrant word of god
[54:17] we believe that we believe in the deity
[54:21] of jesus christ
[54:23] jesus christ is god now that may seem
[54:25] like a simple thing
[54:27] but even in message circles sometimes
[54:29] they get people get away from that
[54:32] that's something we can fellowship
[54:33] around the deity of jesus christ
[54:35] aren't you glad he's god and we're not
[54:38] amen
[54:39] we believe in atonement by christ alone
[54:44] he's the only one there's one lamb
[54:47] right we believe in atonement by christ
[54:50] alone that he is the lamb
[54:51] and we believe in justification by faith
[54:53] alone
[54:55] those are the essential doctrines of the
[54:57] reformation soul of scripture
[54:59] which is the the scriptures alone uh
[55:02] sola
[55:03] christus i believe it is in christ alone
[55:05] we believe in
[55:06] christ as the sole atonement for our
[55:08] sins
[55:09] his death burial and resurrection we
[55:12] believe in rapture and resurrection
[55:15] now you you may say have a little bit
[55:16] different idea about it than i do but we
[55:18] believe in it
[55:20] we can fellowship around that around the
[55:22] fact that we're going to change brother
[55:24] david
[55:24] we're not going to be these whole bodies
[55:26] forever but jt we're not going to be
[55:28] hobbled forever
[55:30] we're going to be in new bodies one of
[55:31] these days we can fellowship around that
[55:33] fact
[55:34] that's a real thing we can grab a hold
[55:36] of
[55:38] we believe in personal and practical
[55:39] holiness
[55:42] we believe in that sanctification in our
[55:44] lives we believe in that
[55:47] and not that we would take somebody and
[55:48] judge somebody but if you come and tell
[55:50] me
[55:50] that something's going on in your life
[55:52] that's against the word of god
[55:54] i have to tell you it's not right
[55:56] because we believe in personal and
[55:58] practical holiness that it ought to show
[56:00] up in our lives
[56:01] that what's on the inside ought to show
[56:02] up on the outside
[56:04] and so if you if you're a church that
[56:07] never preaches holiness you're
[56:08] there's not going to be much we can
[56:10] fellowship around you understand because
[56:12] you go and
[56:13] we were watching some worship music the
[56:15] other night and
[56:16] and not i don't want to be critical god
[56:18] forgive me if i'm critical but
[56:20] but people stand up there in high heels
[56:23] and
[56:23] and tight skirts and or it was actually
[56:26] pants
[56:27] and you have to look away i enjoy some
[56:29] of the music but i hate the way they
[56:31] look
[56:32] and i got to looking at that and i
[56:33] thought there's no fellowship there
[56:36] i couldn't even sit there and listen to
[56:39] that i
[56:40] it just it grieves my heart because it
[56:42] just it creates this disfellowship
[56:45] and i'm so thankful that we can come to
[56:46] the house of god today and
[56:48] and have musicians that love god and
[56:51] singers that love god and
[56:53] people that love god amen and loving
[56:56] enough that it shows up in a practical
[56:57] way in their lives
[56:59] not not that we'll be perfect because
[57:01] again we believe in one atonement
[57:04] right for sin that's it but we believe
[57:07] in
[57:08] in personal and practical holiness we
[57:09] believe in baptism by immersion in the
[57:11] name of the lord jesus christ we believe
[57:12] that's what the scriptures teach us
[57:14] if the scriptures are inerrant then we
[57:16] believe that's the truth
[57:17] we believe in the baptism of the holy
[57:19] ghost
[57:20] do you believe in that today that didn't
[57:23] leave the church
[57:25] right an intellectual conception of the
[57:27] message doesn't replace the baptism of
[57:29] the holy ghost so we believe in that
[57:31] we believe in gifts in the church we
[57:34] believe in ministry gifts and spiritual
[57:35] gifts
[57:36] we don't teach cessation and it would be
[57:38] hard to have fellowship with those that
[57:40] believe in cessation because
[57:42] they don't believe that what i do is
[57:44] it's valuable
[57:45] and they don't believe what we do as a
[57:46] church is valuable but and it's not just
[57:49] me but ministry as a whole
[57:51] we believe if god put it in the church
[57:52] he didn't take it out
[57:54] right and so we believe in in the gifts
[57:57] we believe ministry
[57:58] and we believe in spiritual gifts we
[58:00] still believe in tongues and
[58:01] interpretation and knowledge and
[58:03] helps and all of those things amen
[58:05] brother branham did
[58:08] we we do and why you say what do you say
[58:10] brother branham did well because he was
[58:11] a word
[58:12] prophet right so we believe we have to
[58:14] have some doctrine and we're not a
[58:16] church
[58:16] and yet we treat people right who don't
[58:18] believe that
[58:20] right that's no excuse to be rude to
[58:21] somebody who don't believe these things
[58:24] right we believe in the sovereignty of
[58:25] god an election and predestination
[58:28] right that takes all the worry off of me
[58:29] and all the worry off of you
[58:32] right yes we strive but we strive
[58:35] because there's something on the inside
[58:37] that's calling us to another land we
[58:39] strive because we were preordained to it
[58:42] amen we believe in the sovereignty of
[58:44] the local church
[58:46] if someone teaches a denominational
[58:47] system where there's a bishop that we
[58:49] have to answer to
[58:50] we can't have much fellowship around
[58:51] that
[58:53] we believe in the restoration and the
[58:55] opening of the word by god's prophet
[58:56] messenger to this age
[58:58] brother branham again we don't treat you
[59:00] bad if you don't believe that but that's
[59:02] what we believe
[59:04] as a fulfillment of malachi 4 as a
[59:07] fulfillment of revelations 10 1-7
[59:09] his ministry during his ministry that
[59:11] was fulfilled
[59:13] god fulfilled it through that ministry
[59:15] we believe in the opening of the word we
[59:16] believe in the opening of the mysteries
[59:18] of god the
[59:19] tying up of the loose sins that covers
[59:21] all of the different doctrines of the
[59:23] message we believe in those things now
[59:24] you may have a little bit different idea
[59:26] but we can still fellowship around those
[59:28] things
[59:31] we believe in divine love and brotherly
[59:34] kindness
[59:35] we believe in that
[59:39] i want to ask us today just we kind of
[59:42] go through that and
[59:43] just kind of as we're preparing
[59:45] ourselves in it like i said if the
[59:46] lord's willing i
[59:47] i want to get into this absolute a
[59:49] little bit
[59:51] and what is fellowship fellowship
[59:54] in the original language is corninea
[59:57] which is a greek word that means common
[1:00:01] it's the idea of sharing having
[1:00:04] something in common
[1:00:05] a relation between individuals which
[1:00:07] involves a common interest and a mutual
[1:00:10] active participation in that interest
[1:00:14] and in each other thank you for putting
[1:00:17] up with my stutters
[1:00:21] but it's fellowship it's a common
[1:00:22] interest you've got to have something in
[1:00:24] common
[1:00:25] and so brother random tells the story
[1:00:26] about the little girls were hanging
[1:00:28] around grandma all the time he said she
[1:00:29] must have some candy in her pocket
[1:00:32] you do things keep your grandma around
[1:00:33] you know but or you do things keep your
[1:00:35] grandkids around i guess
[1:00:38] but you know that's if a person you know
[1:00:40] they like to fellowship with people with
[1:00:42] their own kind
[1:00:43] people they have something in common
[1:00:44] with who has more in common than we do
[1:00:48] no one does even our own family by blood
[1:00:51] we don't have more in common
[1:00:53] i have more in common with my brother as
[1:00:55] my brother in christ than i do as my
[1:00:57] brother in the flesh
[1:01:00] right now so we have a mutual active
[1:01:02] participation and interest and
[1:01:04] fellowship is not always fun
[1:01:06] right although though it pleases us and
[1:01:09] i believe it pleases god but
[1:01:11] but it's not always fun you don't look
[1:01:12] at fellowship in the bible and find
[1:01:14] where it was ever
[1:01:14] fun it was a fellowship of suffering
[1:01:18] we'll get into that a fellowship of the
[1:01:20] believers and things but it was not fun
[1:01:22] but it's a it's a participation in
[1:01:24] something something that you believe
[1:01:26] something that you stand on so it's not
[1:01:29] just
[1:01:30] we we call that a fellowship hall it's a
[1:01:31] place for fellowship this is a place for
[1:01:34] fellowship
[1:01:35] but this we we fellowship with the word
[1:01:37] here so we can fellowship with each
[1:01:39] other out there
[1:01:41] right and but we have a common interest
[1:01:43] even here
[1:01:44] now so the word answers to the latin
[1:01:47] communio which means your community it's
[1:01:50] common
[1:01:51] it's rendered in the scriptures
[1:01:53] communion you know that is fellowship
[1:01:56] communion is fellowship fellowship
[1:01:58] between you and god
[1:02:00] and fellowship with one another you
[1:02:01] realize the last thing jesus wanted to
[1:02:03] do
[1:02:04] was get his disciples together and have
[1:02:05] a meal
[1:02:08] just have a meal with them and he said
[1:02:10] do this till i come and we don't eat a
[1:02:12] full meal
[1:02:12] but we honor that it's death burial and
[1:02:14] resurrection by communion
[1:02:16] we fellowship with one another we long
[1:02:18] for that i've found over the years that
[1:02:20] people
[1:02:20] if they don't show up for any other
[1:02:22] service will show up for communion
[1:02:23] because there's just something about it
[1:02:25] it's a fellowship something we have in
[1:02:27] common every one of us
[1:02:28] take the same bread and the same wine
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:31] it's a fellowship that we have and
[1:02:35] so paul talks about your fellowship in
[1:02:37] the gospel
[1:02:38] of participation in sympathy and
[1:02:40] suffering and labor
[1:02:42] and sometimes it even talks about
[1:02:44] fellowship and uses the word fellowship
[1:02:46] for
[1:02:47] a gift that would be given from to
[1:02:49] people in need
[1:02:50] it's a fellowship we care for one
[1:02:52] another
[1:02:54] social media today is a poor substitute
[1:02:56] for real fellowship
[1:03:00] and you know if that's the only
[1:03:01] fellowship that we get it's virtual
[1:03:04] and i feel for our elderly because some
[1:03:05] of them that's all they can get right
[1:03:07] now
[1:03:07] and thank god we have that for them but
[1:03:10] if that's all that we get we're missing
[1:03:12] something
[1:03:14] there's something about being in the
[1:03:15] house of god that just does something to
[1:03:17] you
[1:03:17] you slow down and your week stops for
[1:03:20] just a minute you may be thinking about
[1:03:21] all kinds of things and
[1:03:22] worried about the tractors or whatever
[1:03:24] it is that you're concerned about in
[1:03:25] your everyday life but on sunday morning
[1:03:27] or wednesday night or whatever you can
[1:03:28] come
[1:03:29] you come in the house of god and you
[1:03:31] there's just something about it that it
[1:03:32] it breaks up that
[1:03:34] that idea and your thoughts begin to
[1:03:35] turn toward god and you begin to think
[1:03:37] lord
[1:03:38] i know i have needs i know my family has
[1:03:40] needs what does it do
[1:03:41] it just it creates a peace in your life
[1:03:44] it creates an expectation of coming
[1:03:46] together and receiving from god you
[1:03:48] don't get that
[1:03:50] god instituted it do you realize why we
[1:03:52] have church
[1:03:53] that's why we don't cease having church
[1:03:55] suddenly
[1:03:57] for no reason i read where
[1:04:01] i know and i'll do everything i can to
[1:04:03] keep us safe whether it's snow and ice
[1:04:05] or
[1:04:05] virus or whatever but and the deacons
[1:04:08] work for that diligently as well but but
[1:04:11] we need to meet together
[1:04:14] and i saw where the presbyterian church
[1:04:16] in in
[1:04:17] scotland i believe it is was suing their
[1:04:20] country which was a historically
[1:04:22] christian nation in fact i believe
[1:04:23] presbyterianism is the official religion
[1:04:26] of scotland still
[1:04:28] but they they had to sue the government
[1:04:32] because they've shut them down
[1:04:33] completely they can't even meet in small
[1:04:35] groups
[1:04:36] together after after thousands of years
[1:04:38] of meeting together through
[1:04:40] plague and everything else and they
[1:04:42] can't meet today and
[1:04:43] and that's not a political commentary
[1:04:45] but i looked at that and i thought
[1:04:46] why do you want to meet because why do
[1:04:49] we meet
[1:04:50] because jesus said
[1:04:55] that's enough right that ought to be
[1:04:56] enough that's something we can
[1:04:57] fellowship around jesus said
[1:04:59] if any two of you agree on one thing
[1:05:03] amen we can find at least one thing we
[1:05:04] agree on
[1:05:06] if any two of you will agree on one
[1:05:08] thing he said you ask it in my name
[1:05:10] it'll be done for you
[1:05:12] and he said where two or three are
[1:05:13] gathered in my name i will be in the
[1:05:16] midst thereof
[1:05:17] hey man what a promise that is to us
[1:05:21] hallelujah so the bible speaks the
[1:05:23] fellowship in acts chapter 2
[1:05:24] verse 42 and they continued steadfastly
[1:05:27] in the apostles doctrine
[1:05:28] and fellowship they didn't just receive
[1:05:31] christ and then leave
[1:05:33] right but they continued steadfastly in
[1:05:35] the fellowship
[1:05:37] and then breaking a bread and in prayers
[1:05:40] first corinthians 10 16 the same word
[1:05:43] it's the cup of blessing which we bless
[1:05:45] is another communion that's the same
[1:05:46] word fellowship of the blood of christ
[1:05:48] the blood
[1:05:48] bread which we break isn't not the
[1:05:50] communion of the body of christ
[1:05:52] the fellowship second corinthians 13 14
[1:05:55] the grace of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:57] and the love of god and the communion of
[1:05:59] the holy ghost
[1:06:01] aren't you glad to be able to have
[1:06:02] fellowship with him today
[1:06:04] the communion of the holy ghost he said
[1:06:06] be with you all
[1:06:07] hebrews 13 and 16 here's where it's used
[1:06:10] in a financial sense
[1:06:11] he said but to do good and to
[1:06:12] communicate to fellowship to care for
[1:06:14] one another
[1:06:15] forget not for with such sacrifices god
[1:06:18] is well pleased
[1:06:22] brother bosworth told brother branham
[1:06:24] that fellowship was like two fellows in
[1:06:26] one
[1:06:26] ship that's the idea of being in the
[1:06:29] same boat
[1:06:31] what that means is that you fellowship
[1:06:33] around the journey
[1:06:35] right if you've ever traveled much you
[1:06:37] know that that you fellowship around
[1:06:38] that journey
[1:06:39] you get two preachers who travel to
[1:06:41] different countries they'll immediately
[1:06:42] begin to fellowship around those
[1:06:43] journeys that they've taken
[1:06:44] if you find yourself in an airport or
[1:06:47] sitting on a plane next to somebody you
[1:06:49] find yourself fellowshipping with that
[1:06:50] person why because you you fellowship in
[1:06:53] the journey
[1:06:54] listen we're on a journey we're going
[1:06:57] somewhere for the job there's some place
[1:06:58] that we're going we're not stuck here
[1:07:01] if we were as paul said we were of all
[1:07:04] men most miserable
[1:07:05] if we don't believe in a resurrection
[1:07:06] and a rapture we're of all men most
[1:07:08] miserable but we believe
[1:07:09] we're going somewhere and so we
[1:07:11] fellowship around the journey
[1:07:14] there's a journey going on there's a
[1:07:16] there's a something that god is doing
[1:07:18] and taking us somewhere
[1:07:19] and so we fellowship around the
[1:07:21] commonalities of that oh there may be
[1:07:23] some things we do a little different
[1:07:24] you may be in a different part of the
[1:07:26] ship but we're in the same boat
[1:07:29] right we should be able to fellowship
[1:07:31] with that
[1:07:32] there's fellowship and suffering
[1:07:35] especially suffering for christ
[1:07:38] in philippians 3 10 paul says this he
[1:07:41] said that i may know him
[1:07:43] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:07:46] the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:07:51] being made conformable unto his death i
[1:07:54] can't suffer for myself
[1:07:56] but i can fellowship in his sufferings
[1:07:59] when i suffer then i fellowship in his
[1:08:01] sufferings now look
[1:08:03] the early church was a model of that
[1:08:06] can you imagine coming together maybe
[1:08:09] for communion
[1:08:10] as they would perhaps weekly would come
[1:08:13] together
[1:08:14] and on the first day of the week which
[1:08:16] was the historic practice of the church
[1:08:19] they come together it was illegal during
[1:08:22] that time together
[1:08:24] now that that was a you know we look at
[1:08:25] that time and the early
[1:08:28] that roman empire was during the pax
[1:08:29] romana during the two or three hundred
[1:08:31] years that
[1:08:31] rome had peace but they had peace by
[1:08:34] enforcing it
[1:08:35] and it was a wonderful empire to live in
[1:08:37] unless you were a jew or a christian
[1:08:40] and they had lots of abilities in fact
[1:08:43] historians
[1:08:43] will still argue today that it was the
[1:08:45] best time to ever be alive
[1:08:47] if you were a roman citizen but if you
[1:08:49] were a slave or somebody like that you'd
[1:08:51] be in trouble
[1:08:53] but if you were a roman citizen it was a
[1:08:55] wonderful time
[1:08:56] but they would gather together and i
[1:08:58] read a study that they did on the
[1:08:59] composition of the early church and
[1:09:01] there would be
[1:09:02] there would be some all different kinds
[1:09:04] set together but
[1:09:06] usually they would gather in the home of
[1:09:07] someone who was a citizen of someone who
[1:09:09] had a little money
[1:09:10] because he had to be able to host these
[1:09:12] people and feed them
[1:09:14] so it wasn't like we'd come together in
[1:09:15] a church because there wasn't any
[1:09:16] churches at the very beginning
[1:09:18] it was just we go to joe's house and
[1:09:20] he'd have
[1:09:21] enough money because he worked at the
[1:09:23] funeral home i don't know if they had
[1:09:24] funeral homes in that day but
[1:09:25] he just had enough to be able to make it
[1:09:27] probably and maybe a little extra where
[1:09:28] he could feed
[1:09:29] people that came and there would be
[1:09:31] slaves there
[1:09:33] there would be slave owners there would
[1:09:36] be people of many different ethnicities
[1:09:38] there would be jews there would be
[1:09:42] usually in every service they said there
[1:09:43] was a couple of homeless people
[1:09:45] there was always people there from
[1:09:47] different walks of life and the average
[1:09:49] group was no more than 30. how we got
[1:09:51] that beat this morning
[1:09:53] almost every service we gather together
[1:09:54] we do more than that but that's the
[1:09:55] average of the early church
[1:09:58] because as it spread they just kept
[1:09:59] planting more churches they didn't all
[1:10:01] just stay in one place until rome got
[1:10:03] started
[1:10:04] right they just planted churches in
[1:10:06] their own community and so they would
[1:10:08] gather together maybe in the catacombs
[1:10:09] as the persecution come on
[1:10:11] they would gather together and sit on
[1:10:13] concrete slabs
[1:10:15] or stone slabs they would sit together
[1:10:18] and
[1:10:18] can you imagine what the prayer request
[1:10:19] must have been like
[1:10:22] because brother so-and-so is missing
[1:10:24] this morning
[1:10:26] he got his head chopped off sister so
[1:10:29] and so
[1:10:30] she was with us last week but today
[1:10:33] she's awaiting trial
[1:10:34] they're going to take her and and
[1:10:37] torture her in front of her chill or
[1:10:38] torture her children in front of her
[1:10:40] and then torture her to death brother
[1:10:42] so-and-so was fed to the lions this week
[1:10:44] let's keep his family in prayer
[1:10:48] you talk about fellowship of suffering
[1:10:52] we suffer in our own way right but it's
[1:10:55] a different today it's a mental thing
[1:10:58] right it's an oppression of the mind and
[1:11:00] it's no less real to us but to them
[1:11:02] you imagine what it was to sit there you
[1:11:05] say
[1:11:06] see i don't take this lightly i don't
[1:11:08] take history lightly
[1:11:09] i'm standing in a long line of ministers
[1:11:12] who preach the light of their hour the
[1:11:14] light of their day
[1:11:15] we don't shouldn't take that lightly
[1:11:17] gathering together as a church we have a
[1:11:18] responsibility to keep it open
[1:11:21] keep the doors open keep the keep as
[1:11:23] many of us as we can gathering together
[1:11:25] why
[1:11:25] because that's what they've done for
[1:11:27] thousands of years he said do this until
[1:11:29] i come
[1:11:31] he said as you see the day approaching
[1:11:32] gather more together and more
[1:11:34] as much as you can if we could put it
[1:11:36] like that
[1:11:38] and so we're doing that we're trying to
[1:11:40] get together and to fellowship together
[1:11:42] but can you imagine the fellowship of
[1:11:44] that suffering that's what paul's
[1:11:45] talking about
[1:11:46] i'm in the fellowship of that i suffer
[1:11:48] too
[1:11:49] i've seen it overseas i've seen where
[1:11:50] the people just had so much fellowship
[1:11:52] and joy
[1:11:53] around each other because that's all
[1:11:55] they had
[1:11:56] and so many times we get that taken away
[1:11:59] from us
[1:12:01] maybe because of we let things slip in
[1:12:04] our lives to take away from our
[1:12:05] fellowship
[1:12:06] we don't realize how important it is
[1:12:09] especially our fellowship with god pray
[1:12:12] for brother james's family herod
[1:12:14] decapitated him today
[1:12:16] pray for brother peter he's in prison
[1:12:18] tonight awaiting execution
[1:12:20] they had such a prayer meeting that the
[1:12:22] prison come open
[1:12:23] an angel come down and let him out of
[1:12:25] the prison come knocked on the door and
[1:12:26] they thought he was a ghost
[1:12:31] you get to go through some things just
[1:12:32] start praying you get to go through some
[1:12:34] things god will begin to move in your
[1:12:35] life
[1:12:36] when brother david got sick we began to
[1:12:38] pray other people got sick and things
[1:12:39] begin to have we begin to pray and we
[1:12:41] begin to see miracles
[1:12:42] you can't see any miracles that there's
[1:12:44] never any problems you can't see any
[1:12:46] miracles that there's never any
[1:12:47] situation but as the pressure comes down
[1:12:49] as the demonic pressure of this age
[1:12:51] comes down
[1:12:52] we are led more and more to the to the
[1:12:54] word of god and to love one another
[1:12:57] and to fellowship with one another
[1:13:00] there's something wrong if we don't want
[1:13:01] to do that
[1:13:03] no wonder they prayed without ceasing
[1:13:09] brother branham talked about his own
[1:13:11] church and he's talking about them
[1:13:12] during the time of the depression
[1:13:14] when that church was started was during
[1:13:15] the time of the depression and how that
[1:13:18] they would greet one another and how
[1:13:19] they would love one another he said
[1:13:20] that's what this church was established
[1:13:22] upon
[1:13:22] that godly brotherly love for one
[1:13:24] another i've seen them even shake hands
[1:13:26] with one another leaving a place and cry
[1:13:28] like babies to leave one another
[1:13:30] they loved one another that well they
[1:13:32] loved one another
[1:13:34] there's a song called blessed be the
[1:13:36] tithe that binds brother madam like to
[1:13:37] sing it it's old song it's kind of hard
[1:13:38] to sing
[1:13:40] but they used to sing it together and
[1:13:42] and that song was written because
[1:13:44] a minister in england was about to leave
[1:13:47] a country church that he labored in for
[1:13:49] a few years and
[1:13:50] he was going to a big church in london
[1:13:52] he's about to leave and
[1:13:54] and the people gathered together all the
[1:13:56] whole church got together you know how
[1:13:57] small churches can be
[1:13:58] you love one another if something
[1:14:00] happens it just breaks you
[1:14:02] you understand because you have intimate
[1:14:04] fellowship with one another in a way
[1:14:05] that you just don't have in a big church
[1:14:07] and the church got together and they
[1:14:08] just began to weep and to cry not that
[1:14:10] they weren't begging him not to go they
[1:14:11] understood but they
[1:14:12] it was just such a love for him and and
[1:14:15] finally he just started crying and
[1:14:16] weeping he said i can't do it
[1:14:18] i can't go and so he finally just stayed
[1:14:20] there and that he wrote that song best
[1:14:22] be the pie that binds our hearts in
[1:14:24] christian love
[1:14:27] because it does something it won't even
[1:14:29] make sense sometimes it'll make you
[1:14:30] do things that don't make financial
[1:14:32] sense or or anything else because you
[1:14:34] love one another
[1:14:36] he said they love one another that well
[1:14:37] they love one another they love one
[1:14:39] another we used to stand and sing that
[1:14:40] old song
[1:14:41] let's be the tie that binds our hearts
[1:14:42] and christian love the fellowship
[1:14:44] of kindred mind is like to that above
[1:14:46] when we ascend apart it gives us inward
[1:14:47] pain
[1:14:48] but we shall still be joined in heart
[1:14:49] and hope to meet again
[1:14:51] he said let not that spirit ever depart
[1:14:53] from this place
[1:14:55] said if it ever does i don't care how
[1:14:56] eloquent your pastor might be
[1:14:59] how well he might bring the word of god
[1:15:00] the spirit of god is grieved away
[1:15:03] see when we can have all things in
[1:15:04] fellowship in common and love one
[1:15:06] another then god will work with us
[1:15:10] he said and we're keeping time and so
[1:15:13] brother branham types the church to a
[1:15:14] time piece a watch
[1:15:16] a clock he said we're keeping time
[1:15:20] that the people come by and say if you
[1:15:22] want to see a church that's really
[1:15:23] humble
[1:15:24] a church that really loves god drop in
[1:15:26] up there at the tabernacle one time and
[1:15:28] watch them
[1:15:29] look at the care they have for one
[1:15:30] another the respect
[1:15:32] when the gospel is being preached how
[1:15:34] reverent everything is just in order he
[1:15:36] said yes
[1:15:36] then they can look and see what time
[1:15:38] we're living
[1:15:40] amen why because they see us working
[1:15:43] together
[1:15:45] right the parts of the clock working
[1:15:46] together and they can look and see what
[1:15:48] time we're living you'll see the spirit
[1:15:49] of god moving among you
[1:15:50] great signs and wonders don't you want
[1:15:52] to see that he said that's when you're
[1:15:54] working together you'll see the spirit
[1:15:55] of god moving among you great signs and
[1:15:57] wonders
[1:15:57] things will be taking place if the thing
[1:16:00] is working together it's telling the
[1:16:01] time
[1:16:02] but if it isn't working then time is
[1:16:03] stopped
[1:16:05] it won't tell the time no more he said
[1:16:07] so if we want to know what time we're
[1:16:09] living
[1:16:10] just start everybody working together in
[1:16:11] the gospel
[1:16:13] loving one another can we do that this
[1:16:14] morning
[1:16:17] loving one another loving god and the
[1:16:19] hands itself
[1:16:20] will tell the time that we're living in
[1:16:26] how do we have fellowship how do we have
[1:16:30] fellowship we have fellowship
[1:16:34] with each other because we have
[1:16:36] fellowship with god what does he say if
[1:16:37] we walk in the light
[1:16:39] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:16:42] one with another
[1:16:44] all right and i know i've preached about
[1:16:45] a lot of these things before but then
[1:16:46] we're going to take a little bit
[1:16:47] different direction
[1:16:48] so just hang with me this morning but
[1:16:51] the fellowship is with him first
[1:16:55] vertical fellowship before horizontal
[1:16:58] fellowship
[1:17:00] in order to have real horizontal
[1:17:02] fellowship you've got to have vertical
[1:17:04] fellowship and usually now this isn't
[1:17:07] always the case there's always an
[1:17:08] exception but usually
[1:17:09] when you see someone leave horizontal
[1:17:12] fellowship and i don't mean just leave
[1:17:13] this church
[1:17:14] but leave church all together you see
[1:17:17] someone leave
[1:17:18] the fellowship we have as a body it's
[1:17:20] usually because they've already left
[1:17:23] the fellowship they have with god
[1:17:28] i've seen it over and over again i can't
[1:17:30] see i say how many times
[1:17:33] brother says fellowship is when we can
[1:17:35] come together
[1:17:36] now you can't make like crows and doves
[1:17:39] they can't have fellowship one with
[1:17:40] another
[1:17:42] he said their diet is different their
[1:17:44] habits are different
[1:17:45] he said you have to have fellowship as
[1:17:47] long as you're in
[1:17:48] an agreement as long as you're in an
[1:17:51] agreement
[1:17:52] first john 1 1 says that which was from
[1:17:55] the beginning
[1:17:57] i may have left you behind there that
[1:17:59] which was from the beginning or i may
[1:18:00] have failed to put these on there
[1:18:02] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:18:04] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:18:06] and our hands have handled of the word
[1:18:07] of life
[1:18:09] now watch that was from the beginning
[1:18:11] what we've heard what we've seen what
[1:18:13] we've looked upon
[1:18:14] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:18:15] life that's christ
[1:18:17] for the life was manifested and we have
[1:18:20] seen it
[1:18:21] and bear witness and show unto you that
[1:18:23] eternal life which was with the father
[1:18:25] and was manifested unto us that's not an
[1:18:27] ordinary man that's god
[1:18:30] that's a manifestation a logos the word
[1:18:32] of the father
[1:18:34] right you can say it this way jesus is
[1:18:36] what god said
[1:18:39] and jesus is what god did
[1:18:42] and jesus is who god is
[1:18:46] all right i've contemplated that deeply
[1:18:48] this week
[1:18:49] jesus is what god said jesus
[1:18:52] is what god is and jesus is
[1:18:56] he's the manifestation of god and he's
[1:18:58] who god is now
[1:19:01] everything that we have
[1:19:04] is based on every fellowship we have is
[1:19:06] based on fellowship with him watch what
[1:19:07] he says
[1:19:08] that which we have seen and heard we
[1:19:09] declare unto you that you also may have
[1:19:12] fellowship with us
[1:19:14] so he says we declare this gospel
[1:19:18] so we can have fellowship with you huh
[1:19:22] it don't mean that we don't treat you
[1:19:23] well when we have no fellowship but we
[1:19:24] declare the gospel
[1:19:26] because we want deeper fellowship
[1:19:29] we want beyond just as the brother was
[1:19:32] talking about but jason was talking
[1:19:33] about sunday
[1:19:34] that filia was more when spoken of in
[1:19:36] the scriptures was more than just a
[1:19:38] a love that you'd have for a natural
[1:19:40] brother but it's that deep affection of
[1:19:43] brotherly
[1:19:44] kindness and brotherly love we want that
[1:19:46] fellowship with one another
[1:19:48] so if you want to have fellowship with
[1:19:50] one another you've got to have
[1:19:51] fellowship with god
[1:19:54] watch what he says he says in verse 3
[1:19:58] he says that which we have seen and
[1:19:59] heard declare we unto you that you also
[1:20:01] may have fellowship with us and truly
[1:20:03] our fellowship is with the father and
[1:20:05] with his son jesus christ
[1:20:07] that's where our fellowship is with and
[1:20:10] he said these things we write unto you
[1:20:12] that your joy may be full
[1:20:14] this then is the message which we have
[1:20:15] heard of him and declare unto you
[1:20:17] god is light and in him there's no
[1:20:18] darkness at all
[1:20:20] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:20:22] him and walk in darkness we lie
[1:20:24] and do not the truth
[1:20:27] and people say well i just it's hard for
[1:20:30] me to go to church because i'm always so
[1:20:32] convicted
[1:20:33] we're getting fellowship with god you
[1:20:36] ought to be convicted in church if
[1:20:38] you're walking in darkness
[1:20:40] right and if you are thank god for that
[1:20:45] so many people aren't but if a person
[1:20:48] walks in darkness in their life of
[1:20:49] course
[1:20:50] they're either going to get better
[1:20:51] they're going to they're going to leave
[1:20:54] they won't usually stay around unless
[1:20:55] their heart is just hardened
[1:20:58] to it and so sometimes a person leaving
[1:21:01] is not always a bad sign
[1:21:03] because they have conviction but if
[1:21:04] they're one of god's they'll come back
[1:21:06] and they don't again they don't have to
[1:21:08] come to this church but they'll come to
[1:21:10] the house of god somewhere
[1:21:12] because that's what christians do
[1:21:15] so he said he said if this sin is the
[1:21:19] message which we have heard of him and
[1:21:20] declaring you god is light and in him
[1:21:21] it's no darkness at all
[1:21:23] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:21:24] him and walk in darkness we lie
[1:21:26] and do not the truth
[1:21:30] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[1:21:32] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:21:34] we have fellowship one with another
[1:21:38] now what's he saying if we walk in the
[1:21:40] light it's impossible for us
[1:21:42] to not have fellowship one with another
[1:21:44] fellowship is not something we
[1:21:46] perform or something we make ourselves
[1:21:49] do
[1:21:50] we have fellowship right as a result of
[1:21:54] having fellowship with him
[1:21:56] we have fellowship one with another as
[1:21:59] i've said
[1:21:59] no one exists outside the church if you
[1:22:02] think of the church
[1:22:03] there's a church nominal we know but the
[1:22:05] church spiritual the bride
[1:22:07] no one exists by themselves outside of
[1:22:09] that
[1:22:10] if you're someone that doesn't go to
[1:22:11] church at all you're just a part of the
[1:22:12] body that doesn't work
[1:22:14] right we like to have you back or
[1:22:16] wherever you belong they like to have
[1:22:17] you
[1:22:19] right because you belong somewhere
[1:22:22] but if we have if we walk in the light
[1:22:24] of jesus night we have fellowship one
[1:22:25] with another
[1:22:26] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:22:28] cleanseth us from all sin
[1:22:31] you don't realize the power that there
[1:22:32] is in keeping the church clean
[1:22:34] in the church gathering together right
[1:22:37] the
[1:22:38] power that's in the church that's why we
[1:22:39] talked about taking someone out from
[1:22:41] under the protection of the church
[1:22:42] what that means is there is protection
[1:22:44] in the church
[1:22:46] there is protection and gathering
[1:22:47] together you are protected by the
[1:22:49] prayers of the local congregation
[1:22:51] you're protected even beyond that but
[1:22:52] david we saw that but you're protected
[1:22:54] beyond that by the prayers of others
[1:22:59] people of light precious faith like the
[1:23:02] bible says
[1:23:03] he says if we say that we have no sin we
[1:23:05] deceive ourselves
[1:23:07] and the truth is not in us we need to
[1:23:09] recognize that we need the atonement of
[1:23:11] jesus christ you believe that today
[1:23:15] but if we confess our sins i love this
[1:23:18] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:23:22] our sins
[1:23:23] and to cleanse us from how much from all
[1:23:26] unrighteousness
[1:23:28] all unrighteousness and what does that
[1:23:30] do it restores fellowship here
[1:23:32] and restores fellowship here it has to
[1:23:36] that's why you can't hold something
[1:23:37] against somebody that's repented
[1:23:38] you just have to let it go let god deal
[1:23:40] with that
[1:23:42] let god deal with that you you you have
[1:23:44] to embrace that and
[1:23:45] and keep going he said how many times
[1:23:46] should you forgive your brother seventy
[1:23:48] times
[1:23:48] seven not just seven times
[1:23:52] but over and over and over again you
[1:23:54] forgive them
[1:23:57] you forgive them until you don't even
[1:23:59] remember what the problem was
[1:24:03] wouldn't you like to be a forgiver like
[1:24:04] that you forgive them so many times that
[1:24:07] you don't even remember
[1:24:08] what you were forgiving them for
[1:24:12] amen he said if
[1:24:15] so if we've not sinned if we say we've
[1:24:17] not said we make him a liar his word is
[1:24:18] not in us in other words we're all in
[1:24:20] the same boat
[1:24:21] we need christ dietrich bonhoeffer spoke
[1:24:25] about this and he was a
[1:24:27] theologian in the german nazi era who
[1:24:30] actually worked against him was
[1:24:31] killed by the germans and worked against
[1:24:35] that nazi regime
[1:24:36] he was a wonderful writer and preacher
[1:24:39] and he said this the sinner surrenders
[1:24:41] he gives up all his evil he gives his
[1:24:44] heart to god
[1:24:45] he finds the forgiveness of all of his
[1:24:47] sin and the fellowship of jesus christ
[1:24:50] and his brother the expressed
[1:24:52] acknowledged sin
[1:24:54] has lost all its power i love this
[1:24:57] it has been revealed and judged just sin
[1:25:00] listen i didn't put this on the sides
[1:25:01] but i think it's worth reading
[1:25:03] he said it can no longer tear the
[1:25:05] fellowship asunder
[1:25:08] sin confessed loses its power
[1:25:11] to disfellowship you from christ and
[1:25:14] because of that loses its power
[1:25:17] to disfellowship you from the church
[1:25:20] hallelujah so i can't hold anything
[1:25:23] against you that god doesn't hold
[1:25:24] against you
[1:25:27] amen amen why because if we walk in the
[1:25:30] light as he is in the light the blood of
[1:25:32] jesus christ
[1:25:33] cleanses us from all sin amen
[1:25:37] listen it has been revealed and the sin
[1:25:39] has been revealed and judged as
[1:25:41] sin it can no longer tear the fellowship
[1:25:44] asunder
[1:25:45] now the fellowship bears the sin of the
[1:25:48] brother
[1:25:49] he is no longer alone with his evil for
[1:25:51] he's cast off his sin and confession
[1:25:54] handed it over to god it has been taken
[1:25:55] away from him
[1:25:57] now he stands in the fellowship of
[1:25:59] sinners who live by the grace of god at
[1:26:01] the cross of jesus christ
[1:26:03] the sin listen the sin concealed
[1:26:06] separated him from fellowship
[1:26:09] right though he may have been went to
[1:26:10] church but he couldn't have that
[1:26:11] fellowship
[1:26:12] because he'd broken fellowship with god
[1:26:15] you might tell me oh i feel more like a
[1:26:16] christian than i ever have
[1:26:18] if you've denied the word turned away
[1:26:19] from me i'm not talking about some
[1:26:20] little interpretation we have
[1:26:22] i'm talking about the word of god the
[1:26:23] plain teaching of the word
[1:26:26] you deny that turn away from it you tell
[1:26:28] me oh i feel more like christian you're
[1:26:30] under a deceived spirit
[1:26:32] you've been deceived by a spirit brother
[1:26:34] brandon talks about it and why it's so
[1:26:35] hard for some people to live the
[1:26:36] christian life
[1:26:38] hidden life with christ and all those
[1:26:40] sermons where brother adam talks about
[1:26:41] deceit church by the world
[1:26:42] all kinds of different sermons where he
[1:26:43] talks about how a person could be
[1:26:45] deceived because they feel the presence
[1:26:46] of god and it's only on the exterior
[1:26:51] because you have to have fellowship with
[1:26:53] him before you can have fellowship with
[1:26:54] one another
[1:26:55] god help us today george i don't say
[1:26:58] that and look at you
[1:26:59] say that look at me god help me not to
[1:27:02] ever be deceived
[1:27:04] let me stay right with the word because
[1:27:07] i know if i can stay right with the word
[1:27:08] i can stay right with you
[1:27:12] even if i make mistakes whatever you
[1:27:14] might make mistakes but yet you come
[1:27:15] back to the word and you repent
[1:27:17] and it's all covered under the blood and
[1:27:18] you restore fellowship here
[1:27:20] and here
[1:27:24] now to have true fellowship with one
[1:27:25] another so for us to do that
[1:27:29] we must be born again bonhoeffer said
[1:27:32] the sin concealed separated him from the
[1:27:33] fellowship
[1:27:34] made all his apparent fellowship a sham
[1:27:36] the sin confessed to help him to find
[1:27:38] true fellowship with the brethren in
[1:27:40] jesus christ
[1:27:42] paul says this he said be not unequally
[1:27:44] yoked together with unbelievers
[1:27:46] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:27:48] with unrighteousness
[1:27:49] well communion hath light with darkness
[1:27:52] you've got nothing in common
[1:27:54] what agreement he said what concord hath
[1:27:57] christ with belial what part
[1:27:59] hath he that believeth with an infidel
[1:28:01] what agreement at the temple of god with
[1:28:03] idols
[1:28:06] someone come in here and set up an idol
[1:28:08] up here and say y'all have your servants
[1:28:10] will have ours
[1:28:10] oh let's fellowship brother they can't
[1:28:13] do
[1:28:14] that brother that breaks my heart but i
[1:28:17] can't have fellowship around that idol
[1:28:20] i have no communion with that i
[1:28:23] understand i'm no community i can't
[1:28:24] fellowship around that
[1:28:26] whatever idol that is i can't fellowship
[1:28:27] around it people make idols today
[1:28:30] and they break off festival degrees in
[1:28:31] my heart but they make an idol out of a
[1:28:33] doctrine
[1:28:34] and that doctrine becomes the idol they
[1:28:36] worship around and if people worship
[1:28:38] they just worship around the idol
[1:28:40] and everybody comes and the preacher
[1:28:41] sets up the idol and they all worship
[1:28:43] around it
[1:28:44] and there's no fellowship it becomes a
[1:28:47] cult
[1:28:48] because what agreement hath the temple
[1:28:50] of god with idols for you are the temple
[1:28:52] of the living god
[1:28:53] god has said i will dwell in them and
[1:28:55] walk in them and i will be their god
[1:28:56] they should be my people so he says if
[1:28:58] you're the temple what agreement do you
[1:28:59] have with idols
[1:29:01] you have no agreement with idolatry
[1:29:05] he says what he said wherefore
[1:29:09] come out from among them be separate
[1:29:11] says lord touch not the unclean thing
[1:29:13] and i will receive you
[1:29:14] i will be a father unto you you should
[1:29:16] be my sons and daughters don't you want
[1:29:18] to have a father
[1:29:21] something that is a need in the heart of
[1:29:23] a human being for a father he said i'll
[1:29:24] be a father to you
[1:29:26] if you've dealt with that maybe in your
[1:29:28] life where you had not had a father that
[1:29:29] was a real father but he said i'll be a
[1:29:31] father unto you
[1:29:33] you should be my sons and daughters
[1:29:34] saith the lord god
[1:29:36] amen said the lord almighty
[1:29:40] what do we fellowship around
[1:29:44] what do we fellowship around i'm not
[1:29:46] going to keep you here until 12 30 today
[1:29:49] i recognize i'm not a special speaker
[1:29:54] but what do we fellowship around are you
[1:29:57] with me
[1:30:00] fellowship requires agreement agreement
[1:30:03] requires something what does it require
[1:30:04] absolute
[1:30:07] right there has to be a definition of
[1:30:10] wood
[1:30:10] somewhere or you're never going to agree
[1:30:12] with me that this pulpit is made out of
[1:30:13] wood
[1:30:15] if the definition of wood is based on
[1:30:17] your truth
[1:30:19] or my truth we got a problem
[1:30:22] all right i said well you believe
[1:30:25] whatever you want to no i have to
[1:30:26] we have to have some agreement or you're
[1:30:29] never going to use the right tools to
[1:30:30] work on it you're never going to
[1:30:32] you're not going to realize the
[1:30:33] strengths of it and the weaknesses of it
[1:30:35] you're not going to know anything about
[1:30:36] it unless you can first acknowledge it's
[1:30:37] wood
[1:30:40] right and so there has to be something
[1:30:42] that's absolute as long as adam and eve
[1:30:43] kept god's revealed word as an absolute
[1:30:45] they could have fellowship and he only
[1:30:48] revealed that one word to him he said
[1:30:50] of the tree all the trees of garden you
[1:30:52] can eat but not that one not the treated
[1:30:54] of life or the tree of knowledge of good
[1:30:56] and evil right he said don't touch that
[1:31:00] right and then so they're happy they're
[1:31:02] just doing fine but brother brown said
[1:31:04] that's the thing that broke the
[1:31:04] fellowship in eden
[1:31:06] because eve failed to keep the focus of
[1:31:08] her looking on god's word
[1:31:10] and listen to the reasonings of the
[1:31:12] enemy
[1:31:15] look at the fellowship they had
[1:31:17] wonderful fellowship brother branham
[1:31:19] talks about it so wonderfully where they
[1:31:20] walk down
[1:31:21] in the cool of the day they come down
[1:31:24] for fellowship with papa god
[1:31:26] and he sat there in the evening you
[1:31:29] you've had times like that where you
[1:31:30] just fellowship with the word
[1:31:32] it's just there maybe in your car many
[1:31:34] times i've driven back and forth to work
[1:31:36] early in the morning
[1:31:36] or in the afternoon coming home but
[1:31:38] especially it seemed like in the morning
[1:31:40] i driving things would be quiet and i'd
[1:31:42] be just fellowshipping with the word of
[1:31:43] god
[1:31:44] fellowship with the word things i'd
[1:31:46] heard in church things i'd listen to on
[1:31:47] a tape and just
[1:31:48] the presence of god come down the
[1:31:49] sweetness and the calmness of that
[1:31:52] and so there's a fellowship there and
[1:31:54] they had this kind of fellowship
[1:31:55] it was so great that that shekinah glory
[1:31:58] settled down over them
[1:32:00] whatever they had in need of they could
[1:32:01] just ask and it was done they could
[1:32:03] speak and it would happen
[1:32:06] and if she just stayed right with god
[1:32:08] said so
[1:32:11] the absolute could be defined like this
[1:32:12] it's what god says
[1:32:16] does that make sense the absolute is
[1:32:18] what god says
[1:32:20] i can say it wouldn't be absolute but
[1:32:22] what god says
[1:32:24] however he says it that's why the
[1:32:27] absolute is jesus christ
[1:32:29] because he is what god says
[1:32:32] all right he is what god says he is the
[1:32:35] word
[1:32:36] that he's the logos he is what god says
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:41] so that settles it if god said so that
[1:32:44] settles it god said so but she didn't
[1:32:46] want to do that
[1:32:48] he said see she she didn't want to do
[1:32:49] that he said she changed the focus of
[1:32:51] her glass and began to see
[1:32:52] instead of being just one way there
[1:32:55] become two ways
[1:32:58] you realize the first decision that man
[1:33:00] human beings ever made was the wrong one
[1:33:06] that's why we don't leave ourselves we
[1:33:09] get
[1:33:09] so elevated in our minds and thank god i
[1:33:11] know this i know this is right i know it
[1:33:13] but listen we don't lead ourselves it
[1:33:16] takes the holy spirit to guide you
[1:33:17] through the word
[1:33:18] that's why our absolute and forgive me
[1:33:21] for this but i believe in the inerrancy
[1:33:22] of scripture but our absolute is not
[1:33:23] just printed
[1:33:24] pages or abstinence the living revealed
[1:33:27] word
[1:33:29] christ right because it has to be
[1:33:32] revealed to you to be absolute
[1:33:35] and we'll talk about that because
[1:33:36] brother when he talks about absolute
[1:33:37] talks about an experience
[1:33:40] that mo that paul had and moses had
[1:33:43] where they met the pillar of fire and
[1:33:45] the absolute is what god says it's the
[1:33:47] word
[1:33:48] the pillar of fire the logos come and
[1:33:49] met them
[1:33:51] and then he revealed to them the word so
[1:33:54] we have to have that absolute
[1:33:57] now she saw well now maybe this man
[1:34:00] could be right maybe he is right
[1:34:01] now we know god is right but watch what
[1:34:05] she says we know god is right we do
[1:34:06] don't we
[1:34:07] but maybe he's right he said this is
[1:34:10] just more light on what god said
[1:34:16] so a person could acknowledge that god
[1:34:18] is true that god is right but not for my
[1:34:19] situation
[1:34:22] you know it's easy to
[1:34:25] to uh apply holiness to everybody else's
[1:34:28] lives
[1:34:30] isn't that right well that's the
[1:34:34] absolute man they have to do that
[1:34:36] until it comes down here
[1:34:40] and then you get in that straight you
[1:34:42] get between two opinions
[1:34:45] and that's when it always goes wrong
[1:34:48] when we don't listen to god's word
[1:34:50] he said maybe he is right we know god is
[1:34:51] right maybe he is right this is just
[1:34:53] more light on what god said he said you
[1:34:54] see there
[1:34:55] see what god says is true what god says
[1:34:58] is the absolute
[1:35:00] huh he said there is the same thing
[1:35:02] happens today
[1:35:03] he said exactly right back to the same
[1:35:05] spot see he said you see two ideas
[1:35:07] there's only one
[1:35:08] there's not no creed it's the word god's
[1:35:10] word god's purpose
[1:35:11] god's plan all other plans are not good
[1:35:14] no good i could have a plan for the
[1:35:18] church you could have a plan for your
[1:35:19] life all other plans are no good but
[1:35:21] god's plans
[1:35:23] see something has to be absolute you
[1:35:25] realize how do you know you're saved if
[1:35:27] there's no absolute
[1:35:29] if you can't ever say i know i met god
[1:35:33] and i know he revealed to me the word
[1:35:35] and i know where i belong
[1:35:36] what hour it is how would you ever have
[1:35:38] an absolute
[1:35:39] of anything how would you ever even
[1:35:42] believe for your healing
[1:35:43] if you weren't sure that god could heal
[1:35:46] now john calvin said this about
[1:35:49] christians fellowship he said among
[1:35:50] christians ought to be such a great
[1:35:51] dislike of
[1:35:52] schism that they may always avoid it so
[1:35:55] fast as lies in their power
[1:35:58] ought to prevail among them such a
[1:35:59] reverence for the ministry of the word
[1:36:01] and the sacraments that wherever they
[1:36:02] perceive these things to be
[1:36:04] there they must consider the church to
[1:36:06] exist
[1:36:07] so what he's saying is that maybe they
[1:36:09] would have a personal problem with the
[1:36:10] minister
[1:36:11] but they still must consider that a
[1:36:13] church if the word of god was preached
[1:36:14] there
[1:36:15] and they had communion together that's a
[1:36:18] very simple definition
[1:36:20] right some things are essential some
[1:36:21] things that are not
[1:36:23] but something has to be absolute there's
[1:36:26] no fellowship around a game with no
[1:36:27] rules
[1:36:31] you know i've never seen a football in a
[1:36:33] baseball game played together
[1:36:35] might be interesting you know there's
[1:36:38] also no fellowship around a game with
[1:36:40] that you don't know the rules
[1:36:43] that's why joel and i don't play rook
[1:36:44] anymore
[1:36:47] once you start applying different sets
[1:36:49] of rules it don't work
[1:36:53] right and whether that card should count
[1:36:55] or should not count matters
[1:36:58] when you're playing the game we went to
[1:37:02] joe's house and played dominoes one
[1:37:03] night and he's constantly explaining to
[1:37:05] us because we'd only played once i think
[1:37:07] before that that kind of dominoes
[1:37:09] and so he's constantly explaining the
[1:37:10] rules why would you do that why would we
[1:37:12] do that in church
[1:37:14] there's rules so there's no fellowship
[1:37:16] right and it's not we're just not made
[1:37:18] out of rules but there's got to be some
[1:37:19] boundaries
[1:37:21] there's got to be some things we say are
[1:37:22] wrong and they're just wrong in their
[1:37:24] face
[1:37:25] don't take a a rocket scientist to
[1:37:27] figure it out
[1:37:28] well but you don't know my situation but
[1:37:30] it's just wrong and god will give you
[1:37:32] mercy
[1:37:33] i believe everybody i meet i want to
[1:37:35] believe they can be saved
[1:37:36] but it doesn't change the rules of the
[1:37:38] game so you won't have a baseball
[1:37:40] football player you know they can't even
[1:37:41] agree on how many
[1:37:43] men are on the field they can't believe
[1:37:45] they can't agree on how you score a
[1:37:47] point or what to call
[1:37:48] it right
[1:37:51] but brother brown said there is an
[1:37:52] absolute in a ball game so you have to
[1:37:54] be playing the same game
[1:37:55] if you're playing a different game
[1:37:56] there's no rules there's nothing you can
[1:37:58] agree on
[1:37:59] but even within the game there's an
[1:38:01] absolute in a ball game
[1:38:03] and that's the umpire and
[1:38:06] he said right if he says it's a strike
[1:38:08] that's what it is
[1:38:10] don't care what you say so what i think
[1:38:12] when i saw it the way you saw it it's
[1:38:13] what he said
[1:38:14] it's an absolute amen if he says strike
[1:38:17] you have to agree with it
[1:38:20] you say well i don't have to agree with
[1:38:21] to start my own club go ahead
[1:38:23] you won't get them millions of dollars
[1:38:28] to play on that level you've got to
[1:38:30] agree with the empire
[1:38:34] you may not like it but it's going to be
[1:38:35] a strike
[1:38:37] why because he said it was a strike
[1:38:39] that's the way it's going to be rolled
[1:38:40] up strike what if there was no umpire he
[1:38:42] said now who would be right
[1:38:44] one said it was strike then other one
[1:38:45] said it was no strike it was the ball
[1:38:46] was
[1:38:47] he said well you'd have chaos you
[1:38:48] wouldn't know what to do
[1:38:50] there's got to be somebody somewhere he
[1:38:52] says that somebody's word is final
[1:38:56] amen hallelujah it's got to be somewhere
[1:39:00] that somebody's wearing his final man he
[1:39:01] said i feel
[1:39:02] real good right now glory hallelujah
[1:39:04] there's got to be something that's
[1:39:05] final amen he said i'm so glad of that
[1:39:09] he said oh now there's somebody who can
[1:39:11] say it's sin or it's not sin
[1:39:13] that's not me by the way all right
[1:39:16] that's not it's the word
[1:39:19] and that we have to have to have an
[1:39:20] agreement around that or we can't we
[1:39:22] won't have any fellowship
[1:39:24] he said i'm so glad of that i'm glad for
[1:39:26] an absolute no hard you no need of
[1:39:28] arguing
[1:39:29] the empire said strike that's what it is
[1:39:30] mark it up in your mind it's a strike
[1:39:32] and go on
[1:39:33] when god says anything that's the way it
[1:39:35] is no need of arguing about it that's
[1:39:37] what it is he said so
[1:39:39] that's the christian's absolute i
[1:39:42] bet do you realize what we've had in
[1:39:44] this hour you know what they've done
[1:39:45] over with sports
[1:39:47] through the advent of of the fourth
[1:39:49] dimension through television and through
[1:39:50] replay
[1:39:51] what they've done in sports is the
[1:39:53] ability to look at a play
[1:39:55] and review it and and confirm it to be
[1:39:56] correct
[1:39:58] pretty bad pretty bad you realize what's
[1:40:02] been done in this hour
[1:40:04] that god allowed a man to stand in this
[1:40:07] hour and see
[1:40:08] through that dimension and was able to
[1:40:11] verify
[1:40:13] hallelujah that's fresh church i tell
[1:40:15] you what god's so good to us
[1:40:17] look it's here it is the empire already
[1:40:20] called the balls and strikes
[1:40:23] i bet but he sent a prophet in our hour
[1:40:25] not to create a new rule book
[1:40:27] but to have the vision to see amen
[1:40:32] this is what's right amen
[1:40:35] i can rest on that i can believe for my
[1:40:38] family on that
[1:40:39] amen that's something we can fellowship
[1:40:41] around something we can rejoice around
[1:40:43] not not just the man
[1:40:44] but the fact that god sent a man to show
[1:40:47] us that the
[1:40:48] rules were correct that what god said
[1:40:51] is right amen
[1:40:55] it was an absolute in that way
[1:40:58] he saw the vision and it was right
[1:41:01] amen hallelujah someone has to say it
[1:41:06] someone has to be the one god sent and
[1:41:07] that was the man god sent
[1:41:10] amen hallelujah
[1:41:13] he said that's the absolute to the real
[1:41:15] believer
[1:41:16] that's the christian's absolute if he is
[1:41:19] a christian god said do it this way
[1:41:20] that's the way it's got to be done
[1:41:22] no argument well say it wasn't nothing
[1:41:24] about it god said so that settles it
[1:41:26] that's
[1:41:26] the absolute to the real believer it's
[1:41:28] what god says
[1:41:32] or absolute is christ because he is the
[1:41:34] word he's what god says
[1:41:36] brother brown said now you see you must
[1:41:37] get that absolute that's something
[1:41:39] that's real
[1:41:40] that identifies you with christ and his
[1:41:42] word
[1:41:43] yes the word is christ you must be sure
[1:41:46] that you can say amen to that word or
[1:41:48] your absolute is wrong
[1:41:50] you've got to you've got it built upon
[1:41:51] some creed what a secret something
[1:41:54] outside the bible
[1:41:56] right something extra biblical something
[1:41:58] that you believe
[1:41:59] about the bible that's not written in
[1:42:01] scripture
[1:42:04] he said well what about what brother
[1:42:05] branham believed brother brown believed
[1:42:07] as a word prophet you had to go back to
[1:42:09] the scripture
[1:42:11] and if you find something that you think
[1:42:13] brother branham taught that's not
[1:42:15] scriptural you need to set it aside for
[1:42:16] a while and think about that
[1:42:20] because it's got to go back to the word
[1:42:23] it's got to be scriptural
[1:42:24] we won't have the full knowledge of it
[1:42:26] until the prophet came because he said
[1:42:28] seal up these things until the time of
[1:42:29] the end
[1:42:30] right so there's some things about it
[1:42:32] particulars we didn't know
[1:42:34] but it lines up all the way through the
[1:42:36] scripture so if you come up with a
[1:42:38] doctrine based on a statement that
[1:42:39] brother branham made and said this is
[1:42:40] the truth
[1:42:42] but it don't match up to the scripture
[1:42:43] something's wrong because he could only
[1:42:45] see the replay
[1:42:47] right he was seeing the replay he was
[1:42:49] tying up the loose ends
[1:42:51] huh the play had already been made the
[1:42:53] umpire already called it
[1:42:54] and the replay come back and confirmed
[1:42:56] it
[1:42:58] amen hallelujah he showed us
[1:43:01] my vision said this is what it is amen
[1:43:05] amen now how could protestants have
[1:43:09] fellowship with catholics sin i don't
[1:43:11] mean to put down any catholics if we
[1:43:12] have any hear this today but
[1:43:14] how could protestants have fellowship
[1:43:15] with catholics when their absolute is
[1:43:17] fundamentally different
[1:43:19] because protestants claim to believe
[1:43:20] this is the word of god
[1:43:23] but when protestants do that it shows
[1:43:24] their attitude it's not really the word
[1:43:26] they're absent as their creed because
[1:43:28] their creed ties back to that mother
[1:43:30] church
[1:43:31] right now but we should be able to
[1:43:34] fellowship with anyone who makes to
[1:43:35] absolute the word and yet many
[1:43:36] protestant fundamentalist churches say
[1:43:38] this is the only thing they believe
[1:43:40] we have no fellowship with them though
[1:43:42] we would want fellowship you understand
[1:43:44] we would have no fellowship because we
[1:43:46] can fellowship around that much that
[1:43:48] this is the word
[1:43:49] but immediately fellowship starts to
[1:43:51] fall apart
[1:43:53] why because the bible says wherever the
[1:43:55] carcass is
[1:43:57] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:43:59] together the predestined ones will be
[1:44:01] gathered to the light of the hour
[1:44:04] that's not everybody not everybody's
[1:44:06] called to that there will be many
[1:44:08] there will be a number no man can number
[1:44:09] go through the tribulation period
[1:44:11] huh that's not us i don't want to go
[1:44:14] through the tribulation period
[1:44:16] but wherever the carcass is that's where
[1:44:18] the eagles will be gathered together
[1:44:20] guess where i'm at at the carcass
[1:44:22] brother called that the fresh kill of
[1:44:23] the word
[1:44:25] that's what i'm gathering around that's
[1:44:26] what we fellowship around i have nothing
[1:44:27] to preach without the message
[1:44:29] what would i have i don't have anything
[1:44:31] else i'll just go be a bab to say
[1:44:33] probably
[1:44:34] you know i have better benefits but i
[1:44:37] got better
[1:44:37] benefits in the long run but you just go
[1:44:41] it's not that you just couldn't spend
[1:44:42] your time doing something else
[1:44:45] there's not just a lot of glory in it
[1:44:46] and being a message believer but why the
[1:44:48] carcass is here
[1:44:50] wherever the carcass is that's where the
[1:44:52] eagles are gathered together
[1:44:53] amen aren't you glad there's something
[1:44:55] you can fellowship around today
[1:44:57] the eagles fellowship around the fresh
[1:44:58] kill of the word it's around something
[1:45:00] in common in matthew 16 and i'm just
[1:45:03] going to skip past that because we're
[1:45:04] out of time
[1:45:05] in matthew 16 he talked to peter and he
[1:45:07] said flesh and blood is not revealed
[1:45:09] unto you
[1:45:09] but my father which is in heaven amen
[1:45:13] what was it an absolute to peter
[1:45:17] the absolute wasn't peter himself
[1:45:20] because if it was peter himself we have
[1:45:22] nothing in common with the early church
[1:45:24] because we can't fellowship with peter
[1:45:26] in the flesh
[1:45:28] i understand we have nothing to gather
[1:45:29] around if the absolute is peter in the
[1:45:30] flesh
[1:45:31] so the absolute is not a man the
[1:45:33] absolute is christ the word
[1:45:36] amen amen
[1:45:39] but the prophet says in modern events
[1:45:40] are made clear by prophecy that said the
[1:45:42] bible
[1:45:42] is to be revealed by inspiration that's
[1:45:45] the only thing the revelation
[1:45:46] jesus told peter upon this rock this
[1:45:49] rock of revelation reveals who he is
[1:45:52] oh my if you don't have that revelation
[1:45:54] there's no starting point
[1:45:57] but see people defend it in their minds
[1:45:59] and they think well i got everything i
[1:46:00] need
[1:46:00] but if you could ever catch a revelation
[1:46:02] of who he is do you ever catch that
[1:46:04] revolution revelation would change your
[1:46:06] life
[1:46:07] why because he is the absolute to you
[1:46:10] hey man upon this rock i'll build my
[1:46:11] church not upon peter not upon himself
[1:46:13] but upon the spiritual revelation of who
[1:46:15] he was
[1:46:17] hallelujah amen ephesians 3 and 8
[1:46:21] he says unto me whom less than the least
[1:46:23] of all saints
[1:46:24] is this grace given is that how you feel
[1:46:25] this morning that's how i feel
[1:46:27] unto me who i'm less than the least of
[1:46:29] all saints is this grace given
[1:46:31] he said that i should preach among the
[1:46:32] gentiles the unsearchable riches of
[1:46:35] christ
[1:46:36] and to make all men see what is the
[1:46:39] fellowship of the mystery
[1:46:41] the fellowship of the mystery what is
[1:46:43] the mystery
[1:46:44] he said to make all men see what is the
[1:46:45] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:46:47] beginning
[1:46:47] of the world has been hidden god who
[1:46:49] created all things by jesus christ
[1:46:52] listen paul could no longer have
[1:46:53] fellowship with the pharisees why
[1:46:55] because the fellowship was in christ
[1:46:57] the mystery of god revealed
[1:47:00] that's more than a sermon title that's a
[1:47:02] statement of faith christ
[1:47:04] is the mystery of god revealed and if
[1:47:06] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[1:47:08] is the absolute of what god says
[1:47:11] right and whoever he speaks through you
[1:47:14] say could a man's word become absolute
[1:47:15] if he speaks the word of god
[1:47:18] and we have confidence that the word of
[1:47:19] god come in our day huh
[1:47:22] because god called a prophet so we can
[1:47:24] say it like that we can say the message
[1:47:26] is our absolute amen we can say that
[1:47:28] but we can also say a man is not our
[1:47:30] absolute
[1:47:33] does that make sense because the
[1:47:34] absolute is what god says
[1:47:37] it's the revealed word of the hour amen
[1:47:42] amen amen now
[1:47:46] brother brown says this bible is to be
[1:47:47] revealed by inspiration that's the only
[1:47:49] thing of
[1:47:49] revelation jesus told peter upon this
[1:47:51] rock this rock of revelation reveals
[1:47:54] who he is i already read that now let's
[1:47:57] let's go to close
[1:48:00] you see when paul
[1:48:04] got an absolute maybe we'll talk about
[1:48:06] that next week
[1:48:09] paul met christ one day he met the logos
[1:48:12] the word
[1:48:14] he met the pillar of fire you say well
[1:48:17] that was good for paul i've never met
[1:48:18] the pillar of fire have you been born
[1:48:20] again
[1:48:21] but the brandon says all christians have
[1:48:24] to meet that pillar of fire
[1:48:25] he said don't call yourself a christian
[1:48:27] unless you're willing to meet that
[1:48:28] pillar of fire
[1:48:30] you met him on the back side of the
[1:48:31] desert what is that an absolute
[1:48:35] he may not appear to you in the form of
[1:48:36] a pillar of fire he may just come in
[1:48:38] your heart and say i'm your redeemer
[1:48:41] i'm your savior he may speak to you at
[1:48:44] an altar may speak to you at your house
[1:48:45] they speak to you somewhere else he
[1:48:46] reveals himself to you and when he
[1:48:48] reveals himself to you
[1:48:50] and don't hold me i know i you say
[1:48:54] things like i've said this morning it's
[1:48:55] just the beginning you're gonna have to
[1:48:56] listen
[1:48:57] for a few more services to really go
[1:48:58] know where i'm going
[1:49:00] but see if we don't realize
[1:49:03] if we don't have that that experience we
[1:49:06] got nowhere to go
[1:49:07] we got nothing to fellowship around and
[1:49:10] so
[1:49:10] people grow up in the message feeling
[1:49:12] empty and they grow up and they end up
[1:49:14] leaving the church or
[1:49:16] maybe even turning down the message
[1:49:17] altogether so the message was the worst
[1:49:18] thing that ever happened to me
[1:49:20] because they are of all men most
[1:49:21] miserable
[1:49:23] because they were in the message but the
[1:49:26] message wasn't in them
[1:49:28] and they never met an absolute so there
[1:49:30] was never a
[1:49:32] something that grabbed hold of them
[1:49:36] but you've met an absolute right and if
[1:49:38] you've met that it changed your
[1:49:40] fellowship
[1:49:41] you find yourself in church your back
[1:49:43] hurts
[1:49:45] hopefully hopefully some of you heard a
[1:49:47] little less with the new chair some of
[1:49:48] you may hurt more i don't know
[1:49:50] it's hard to find something that fits
[1:49:51] everybody but
[1:49:53] you know you sit there and you wonder
[1:49:54] what am i doing here i'm in the house of
[1:49:56] god last week we had a long service and
[1:49:58] now i've gone over my time today but
[1:50:01] look
[1:50:02] i have something i'm here for i have
[1:50:05] fellowship with brother joe i have
[1:50:06] fellowship with all of you brothers and
[1:50:07] sisters why
[1:50:08] because there's an absolute i called you
[1:50:10] by your right name today twice
[1:50:15] we have an absolute the absolute isn't
[1:50:17] me remembering your name
[1:50:18] absolutely doesn't mean being a good
[1:50:20] preacher the absolute is christ
[1:50:23] we met the absolute hallelujah
[1:50:27] and he is the word he is what god said
[1:50:34] now we can have true fellowship
[1:50:36] communion
[1:50:37] with one another there was a musicians
[1:50:39] go ahead and come there was a
[1:50:41] meeting of the american psychological
[1:50:42] association where
[1:50:45] a psychologist at union college and a
[1:50:48] graduate student at columbia university
[1:50:49] got together and
[1:50:51] presented some findings on how members
[1:50:52] of the various sections of 11 major
[1:50:54] orchestras
[1:50:56] perceived one another
[1:51:00] and they said this they said the
[1:51:01] percussionist or insensitive
[1:51:03] unintelligent and hard of hearing there
[1:51:06] you go brother stewart
[1:51:09] it says yet fun-loving you know how we
[1:51:12] we typecast drummers right
[1:51:14] drummers mostly look alike and i'm not
[1:51:16] just talking about brother stewart or
[1:51:17] messy jumpers but if you've seen
[1:51:18] drummers that play professionally
[1:51:20] they're all kind of wild
[1:51:24] there's certain it takes a certain kind
[1:51:27] of vibe to play the drums right
[1:51:31] i played guitar but not well because it
[1:51:32] just takes a certain kind of
[1:51:35] you know personality or at least
[1:51:38] people see them that way the orchestra
[1:51:41] members
[1:51:42] describe the bat the brass players as
[1:51:46] loud
[1:51:48] and that's probably the first thing that
[1:51:49] come to your mind too and you thought of
[1:51:52] trumpets or music in general maybe
[1:51:55] especially if you don't like music and
[1:51:57] some people don't
[1:52:00] or don't like loud music they said the
[1:52:02] the brass players are loud
[1:52:04] so they had nothing in common there
[1:52:06] right
[1:52:07] nothing in common now musicians up here
[1:52:10] the piano know we're gonna have a few
[1:52:11] things in common
[1:52:12] but not the same things as the
[1:52:13] percussionists have in common
[1:52:15] the the base of the drum can get going
[1:52:17] together pretty good but if they run off
[1:52:18] and leave the piano you got a problem
[1:52:21] huh i'm making a point here not
[1:52:22] preaching about music hang with me
[1:52:26] the woodwind players were held in the
[1:52:28] highest esteem you know their
[1:52:29] instruments are hard to play so
[1:52:30] everybody thought well they
[1:52:32] they must be really smart
[1:52:36] everybody thought they were quiet
[1:52:37] meticulous but a bit egotistical
[1:52:42] this is how everybody perceived each
[1:52:44] other how do they play together
[1:52:47] how is there ever even enough agreement
[1:52:51] to come together and play a piece of
[1:52:52] music
[1:52:54] well the answer is simple they
[1:52:56] subordinate their feelings
[1:52:58] their biases to the leadership of the
[1:53:01] conductor
[1:53:05] you ever thought that must be a
[1:53:06] thankless job but he's the most
[1:53:07] important man up there
[1:53:10] without a good conductor you can't have
[1:53:12] a symphony even though they're all
[1:53:13] playing from the same
[1:53:15] sheet music we've got this the written
[1:53:18] word of god we've got the message of the
[1:53:20] hour
[1:53:20] that's the sheet music we've got it
[1:53:22] we've got the
[1:53:24] umpire's call we got the replay
[1:53:28] but there has to be agreement with the
[1:53:31] leadership of the conductor
[1:53:33] or we're never going to have any
[1:53:34] fellowship
[1:53:37] there's got to be something that comes
[1:53:39] down among us
[1:53:40] and settles in a reality of an
[1:53:43] experience that we've had
[1:53:44] i have fellowship with god so i have
[1:53:46] fellowship with you
[1:53:48] i love god so i love you i can't say i
[1:53:50] hate you
[1:53:51] because and say i love god i love god
[1:53:54] and i love you
[1:53:55] i get along with you because the
[1:53:57] conductor is standing there
[1:53:58] i'm not the conductor brother david or
[1:54:00] one of these brothers in this thing and
[1:54:01] they're not the conductor
[1:54:02] he's the conductor
[1:54:06] would you bow your heads with me
[1:54:09] the basic beginnings of the christian
[1:54:12] life
[1:54:14] is to subordinate your thoughts your
[1:54:16] feelings
[1:54:17] to surrender what you think to the
[1:54:20] leadership of the conductor
[1:54:22] god has a symphony brother branham
[1:54:24] explained that to us how that
[1:54:26] he was the symphony was played out and
[1:54:29] they
[1:54:29] watched the music and the music has ups
[1:54:31] to it and lows to it
[1:54:34] it has different parts plays quietly for
[1:54:36] a while and plays loudly for a while
[1:54:39] revival and a cycle of revival and death
[1:54:42] but they're still all in the music
[1:54:45] there's got to be a conductor standing
[1:54:46] there in your life
[1:54:48] or it'll never do any good there's got
[1:54:51] to be a conductor every one of us has to
[1:54:53] have a conductor in our lives
[1:54:56] every one of us has to be subordinate to
[1:54:58] that paul says i keep under my body and
[1:55:00] bring it under subjection
[1:55:02] because i want to be subordinate to the
[1:55:03] conductor in the way i
[1:55:05] preach and the way i conduct myself in
[1:55:07] the ministry and the way that
[1:55:09] the way that you sit and listen to the
[1:55:10] word everything about us what we do
[1:55:12] what we believe lord i may not be able
[1:55:16] to
[1:55:16] do just exactly like someone else would
[1:55:19] do i mean i have the gift someone else
[1:55:20] does
[1:55:21] but let me sit here if i'm going to play
[1:55:22] hard if i'm going to be
[1:55:24] here in my life in this body let me
[1:55:27] follow the leadership of the conductor
[1:55:30] you must have the holy ghost in your
[1:55:32] life
[1:55:34] brother writer makes some strong
[1:55:35] statements about that where he says
[1:55:37] no matter if they believe something
[1:55:39] different he said but they
[1:55:41] god gave them the holy ghost and he gave
[1:55:42] me the holy ghost that's even hard for
[1:55:44] me to understand but if god gives you
[1:55:46] the holy ghost and he'll lead you to the
[1:55:48] truth
[1:55:49] he will he has to
[1:55:52] so thank god for that experience that
[1:55:55] you have and if you've not subordinated
[1:55:57] your thoughts and your actions and
[1:55:58] all those things to it would you do that
[1:56:00] today that's all it is it's
[1:56:02] simplicity in the gospel surrender
[1:56:05] yourself to that
[1:56:06] you don't go to an altar to get
[1:56:08] something you go to get rid of some
[1:56:09] things
[1:56:10] you go to get rid of pride and
[1:56:12] selfishness and things like that
[1:56:14] god help us it's hard i know it's hard
[1:56:16] you've been hurt before
[1:56:18] i've been hurt before and that hurt as
[1:56:20] we said builds a complex until you
[1:56:23] you can't you just can't subordinate
[1:56:24] that and it's hard for you to sit and
[1:56:25] fellowship with believers because
[1:56:27] that hurt is in your way but you've got
[1:56:30] to let go of that enough
[1:56:32] to have fellowship with god when you
[1:56:34] have fellowship with god you have
[1:56:35] fellowship with the brothers and sisters
[1:56:37] it's just natural it's just what you do
[1:56:40] heavenly father we love you today and we
[1:56:42] thank you for this group of people that
[1:56:44] have gathered together
[1:56:46] thank you for those that are watching
[1:56:47] today on the stream i know i've talked
[1:56:50] about a lot of these things before
[1:56:52] but lord i just want to bring it home to
[1:56:55] us
[1:56:56] it wouldn't matter what i would say or
[1:56:58] what someone else would say but what did
[1:56:59] the words say
[1:57:01] what did the umpire say and what was
[1:57:04] revealed to us in this hour what what
[1:57:06] did the vision say
[1:57:08] about who you were what did the prophets
[1:57:11] say what
[1:57:12] what message are we under we're sitting
[1:57:14] around the revealed word of the hour
[1:57:16] surely we can have fellowship
[1:57:18] instead of fighting with one another
[1:57:19] like shackles or hyenas or lions
[1:57:23] or may we gather around the word like
[1:57:25] eagles that's enough for everybody
[1:57:28] lord may we just feed on that word until
[1:57:32] one day
[1:57:33] we gain strength lord we fly away
[1:57:36] i pray you'd grant it lord god oh how we
[1:57:39] want to fly away we're so thankful
[1:57:41] i'm so thankful for the spirit that
[1:57:42] we've felt today for the presence of god
[1:57:44] here in the church
[1:57:45] may that never leave us oh god may we
[1:57:48] never get so caught up in our
[1:57:49] preconceived notions and ideas that
[1:57:51] we have to disfellowship one with one
[1:57:53] another over an opinion
[1:57:55] god may we stay right with the word
[1:57:59] lord if someone else leaves it to be a
[1:58:01] little different or
[1:58:02] has it believes it's a seed let them
