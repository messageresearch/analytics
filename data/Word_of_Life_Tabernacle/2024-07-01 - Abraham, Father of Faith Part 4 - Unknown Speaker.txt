work we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor because of your goodness oh God in Jesus name amen amen Genesis CH 14 and verse 14 we'll read down through verse 16 Natalie is that you back there go good to see you my goodness it's been a while since I've I preached Natalie Brown she come up over our youth group over at Gibson so good to have you tonight with us amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord again amen Genesis chap 14 and verse 14 and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people Lord with that his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight on saving pennies saving pennies brother Harvey's favorite subject you know Abraham was given a promise that he would be a possessor of all things all things mzc identified him as a possessor of all things and I think that's good enough Genesis 14:18 look at this mzc king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the high priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high God possessor of Heaven and Earth possessor of Heaven and Earth listen if he identified him as a possessor then we know that Abram was no matter whether he looked like he was or not it looked like he was a nomad he was living in a in a tent he was traveling from one place to another but he didn't go by by sight he went by faith and by faith Abraham possessed all things someone say all things tonight all things Abraham possessed all things and ozdic identified him as that listen just because you have trials in your life just because you have tests in your life just because your journey is not linear it doesn't just go in One Direction Just because you failed or you've Fallen doesn't mean that you're not a possessor of all things it just means you need to walk more into it you need to step up higher you need to start doing what's right you say well I've done what's wrong start today start doing what's right you don't know how your life might be changed just because you have trials and tests does not mean you're not a possessor listen to Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 7 he said by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left he said by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things Paul says even when I got nothing I still got him and I'm a possessor of all things I think every one of us can say Amen to that tonight amen lot has been taken captive by enemies of Sodom and there was a lack of Separation in his life because if he had if he had been like Abraham had he been a a True Believer who stayed away from that thing it would have his life would have never went to captivity like it did and yet he had a place in the economy of God and so it was a lack of Separation that led to that captivity in Genesis 1411 they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah all their victuals and went their way and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom in his goods and departed the brand said oh what what a horrible thing the wages of sin is death lot realized on doubt walking around there maybe with a rope or a chain around his neck it must have really must have really affected him here he is he once he had his freedom once he was up there with Abraham once he once he had become a very wealthy man with Abraham he he was somebody who who uh traveled with him and now even in Sodom he become the mayor of the city but now he had a rope around his neck sin always leads to that it always leads to that the wages of sin is death lot realized no doubt walking around there maybe with a Roper chain around his neck as a slave his children young girls to be ravished his wife and everything probably die at any time if he disobeyed one order maybe going into another kingdom somewhere to be a slave the rest of his days but Abraham I love this you see we can't go into Savory with lot we got to deliver lot from Savory right place is on the mountain our place is in the message of the hour our position is in Heavenly places we don't go into slavery with lot but what do we do we deliver lot from slavery by staying with the word by staying with the son of man Ministry by staying with the prophet that's how we deliver them from slavery now now watch Abraham when he found out that lot had been taken that was part of Abraham's possession and oh God he said and Abraham might have said this God you told me if I would obey you and walk in here in this land you would give this to me it belongs to me and lot's part of this and I'm going after him glory he said this is part of my possession he may not believe like I he may not be what I am but it's part of what is mine so I'm going after him now as the elect of God what should our mindset be towards those who are in cap activity of sin or even the backslider who even even let's say that they're not the elect we don't know who is and who isn't what should our mindset be toward those people now we you church we we've got to understand that the Bible is written for a reason and there's things that were told for a reason because there are those who are in captivity but they love their captivity right and that's why Jude says there some you can have compassion on and make a difference and others you save by fear he's not saying that you use fear to save them he's saying that you you don't you you be careful that you're not partaker of their sin right right you don't want to become a partaker of that and you realize that that in that condition they could hurt you listen when Saul was in a condition uh uh before he got met the pillar of fire any Christian come by his path didn't do him any good but what did it do to him it it actually caused him to be more of a persecutor he threw him in prison he met lots of Christians he threw him in prison he killed him he he did all kinds of stuff to him so you couldn't help Saul in that condition he needed to meet God he had to be called by God just like you were and yet after he had been called by God it was ananas who went down had a vision you remember and he told him to go down there and meet Paul he said won't he throw me in prison hasn't he done all these things he said but I've called him to be my Prophet yes sir right so there's there's a time and a place for those things there are those who are in captivity but they love it and I'll say this if you want to be saved you can be saved if you want to but you got to want to and you got to be willing to do what it takes right John said bring forth fruits meat for repentance what does that mean it doesn't mean you can save yourself it means that you'll you'll take the action necessary to surrender right you'll take the necessary action to surrender if you don't ever raiseed the White Flag you can't help it if the if the battle continues but if you'll raise the the white flag and walk forward and say I'm giving up this is it then God can do something in your life brother Bram talked about a man in Portland that wanted to bring harm to him and he come out of he was uh the the manic he called him in Portland and come out of insane asylum and he wanted to do harm to him and he he was threatening God's people in God's prophet and they asked him they said is he healed and he said this I said no sir he worships that Spirit no way of helping him at all until he gets that out of his head I said but I wish you would roll him off my feet so I can move and who did that the policeman did that right that were there to protect the meeting but he said what was it did I hate that man I loved him a poor mortal in that condition that wasn't that man speaking it was the devil he was possessed of the devil and the devil made the challenge and the Holy Spirit challenged him back right but see that type of person you couldn't help but look at the difference in that man and the maniac of gadera in Mark 5 and verse one it says they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of the gines and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with change this man is is is is completely given over Bound by enemies but he doesn't want to be are you with me now he doesn't want to be he he's got a thousand demons but he doesn't want those Devils so he can be delivered glory to God look at him he he's dwelling among the tombs no man could bind him because that he'd been often bound with feathers and chains and the chains have been plucked a thunder by him and the feathers broken in pieces neither could any man tame him always night and day he was in the mountains and the tombs crying cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus a far off he ran and worshiped him when he saw Jesus AAR off he didn't come and and say I'm going to knock you down or I'm going to hit you or something but he said I run and worshiped him and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adure Thee by God that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered my name is Legion for are many but you know what he got his Deliverance they found him clothed in his right mind and the demons went off in the swine ran off and jumped in jumped off the cliff right but look the man wanted to be well but demons had control of his body listen if you want to be well there's no demon that can stand in the way of the power of God yes sir but you don't know what I've done no I don't but he does and if he's called calling you answer that call 1 Peter 5:7 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you brother Brown picks that up and he takes the the question he asks the question he cares do you care yeah listen what brother Brandon says about Legion he said he cared when the neurotic called Legion cared enough under opposition to wiggle out from under those tombstones of devils and go out to meet Jesus and throw himself prostrate when Legion them Devils would have never come if Legion hadn't have pushed his way out there to meet him and when he cared enough to make that effort that stand in his belief Jesus cared enough to cast out this Legion of devils from him and his neurotic condition was gone he cared he said when you care oh I'm so glad I'm so glad when we make an effort to reach to him he he cares and why do we make that effort because there's something inside of us to do that that's lot was just a penny but he was Abraham's Penny hard to part with your pennies and Abraham was a spiritually Frugal man he didn't want to give up his Penny are you with me now brother Brandon said he was just a penny in in economy of God see our our sons and daughters belong to us right it belong to us I don't mean that in the sense that they were they're some kind of slaves or something like that although my children may feel like that sometimes but they belong to us I'm not going to let them go go I'm not going to let him not be saved that ain't it's not going to happen brother man how can you say that well because I believe that the God was that was big enough to save me is big enough to save my children big enough to save the the the back Sider that belongs to us the backslider that used to sit in the house of God he's big enough to save that person it may be by us having compassion it may be by by him knocking him off of his high horse but somehow somehow God will reach out those children who were raised in church but no longer serve God they belong to us we don't have that attitude and we've seen so many begin to come back and begin to make steps and and I was asked they said they said I don't even know what to do or or what first step to make is said just keep doing what you're doing come to the house of God sit under the atmosphere of God start doing what's right and and pretty soon you begin to see your life change just sit under the preaching of the word it'll wash you if you'll sit under it yes sir let the Holy Ghost begin to call you to repentance and to the baptism of the Holy Ghost look they belong to us we shouldn't give up on them easily Moses in Egypt when after all the plagues and things that happened and and and Pharaoh's down there just just he just hates to give up you know he's a very very stubborn man and Pharaoh just hates to give up and and God hardened his heart and we find that Moses and Aaron in Exodus 108 were brought again to Pharaoh he said un them go serve the Lord your God but who are they that shall go and Moses said we will go with our young and with our old oh if we can make this kind of a commitment towards the Rapture of the church we will go with our young and with our old amen we're not going to leave out the youngest person sitting here we're not going to leave out our elders sitting in the back we're not going to leave out nobody yes sir we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds we will go for we must hold a feast of the Lord we're taking all of them we're not leaving Joy behind we're not leaving happiness behind we're not going to give one inch to the devil if God said we can have church in in in a certain way we're going to have church in that way if God said we can enjoy the house of God we're going to enjoy the house of God we're not going to let one devil get between us and the power of God we're going to take what belongs to us and what belongs to us everything we can see praise God hallelujah now look we're taking all them Exodus 10:24 and Pharaoh called to Moses and said go ye serve the Lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you he said you have your kids just leave your flocks and herds behind huh but see he knew that they couldn't last long in the desert without their flocks and herds right he wanted to give them something to come back to and Moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice to the Lord Our God our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a hoof be left behind Heen not a hoof be left thereof must we take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come there they said we're going to take all of it but the B said what do he want to do leave something back there so they knew that they'd come back for it he said that's what Pharaoh the devil's still saying to the children leave something behind so you got something to go back to I say God calls for a total separation he calls for a complete deliverance don't leave something back there to go back to we're we're going we're going in we're taking everything with us he wasn't ashamed of the Gospel he believed the gospel was for the children too right am some of y'all can say amen the gospel's for the children too you believe that is that not a is that a true statement right now gospel for the children too Moses walked up before Pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell him that they would not compromise and take his so many days out in the wilderness he said some of the women stay by your children said we'll all go not even one hoof will be left behind we'll take our cattle and all he wasn't ashamed why he had come in the light of Deliverance he said that's the reason a man or a woman sick or anything once comes to the presence of God and knows that God has healed him you're stepping into the light of Deliverance amen you don't compromise on anything right you're never going to be able to serve God halfway you might as well just give in and serve him all the way you might as well you be happier anyhow you so I just I'm afraid I won't be happy living like a Christian if you're a seed of God you won't ever be happy living like the devil you won't ever be happy living halfway between the church and the world you might as well come on in where the blessings of God are might as well step on into the to the presence of God Amen he said you're stepping into the light of Deliverance you don't compromise on anything Deliverance was in his heart for he had met The God Who said I'm the god of Abraham who give Abraham the promise and the time time of Deliverance is at hand I'm sending you down there to take them out he said what's to apologize about that come on Church what's there to apologize about about the message what is there to apologize about about what we have it's deliv it's a message of Deliverance say well I you know just kind of feel bad about it wouldn't want to tell my neighbor no it's a message of Deliverance it's calling us out it's not some something that makes you gloomy and sad if it does you didn't really hear the message right you heard what you wanted to hear but it's a message of Deliverance it'll take you out and it'll bring you in amen so it's a Deliverance Hallelujah he said I'm sending you down there to take them out what's to apologize about that Pharaoh could have killed him he was just a man he was a slave he could have killed him but he wasn't ashamed of that word he didn't come down get on his knees and beg to Pharaoh for nothing he said I come to take them Pharaoh said well you can't take them he said all right then there will be fleas on the earth till you Wade through them amen amen there's what happened said oh Moses take them away he said all right he said now do you repent said well you can go so many days in the wilderness he said them flies will come and said Darkness will come it was so so dark he said you couldn't see one place to the other and finally death come from pharaoh to the servant it was death for the oldest child in the family listen brother B said didn't have no apology to nobody he was a son of Abraham born in the spirit of God given commission by God the message of God to go down and take those people out sir listen he said well can't God call the same thing in this hour to take out of the church a bride I believe he called a prophet in this hour that wasn't ashamed of the message and he's called men of God to standing the P but that's not ashamed of it either Hallelujah not ashamed of the gospel because the gospel is effective it works can I just can I just be honest with you it works you say well it didn't work for so and so I know it worked they didn't work but it worked it works every time it's tried you said well brother so- and so failed it didn't work for him or sister so and so failed it didn't work for her well it worked when they repented that's a bigger that that that's a bigger evidence to me that the gospel works and when a person always does right and always does the right things when a person falls and then they repent and they're able to come all the way back don't you realize that's evidence it works the gospel is effective Romans 1:14 Paul says I'm dead both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much is in me is I'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are roome also he said I'll preach no matter if they want to hear me or not I'll preach no matter if it's a biggest city in the world or not I'll preach in front of the emperor if that's what it takes you realize Paul basically gave up his life his freedom to preach to Nero and Nero was he his enjoyment at that time was burning Christians at the stake but Paul said I'll preach to him anyway now Nero never repented but he got to hear the gospel right are you with me now he got to hear the gospel and and we realize he said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel if he had repented he would have been okay he didn't repent now look said it's the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first also to the Greek not everyone is elect but everyone who wants to be saved can be saved how can you say that well even Cain had no excuse Genesis 4:6 the Lord said to Cain why artart thou wroth why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted if thou doest not well sin lith at the door unto thee shall be his desire Thou shalt rule over him you say well that's just a penny but he needs pennies too right right but we just need to get our own hands off of and let God do the work let him call us to do the work right now maybe but some of them are silver dollars you just don't know it yet and and so we we we call we call everyone to come Revelation 2 17 the spirit and the bride say come let him that Hearth say come let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely brother BR said the whosoever will he said that's the ones that goes through the tribulation I'm paraphrasing but the bride is the elected of God acts 10:34 Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him listen brother BR said though you be in error yet in the righteousness of the projective of your heart that you desire to serve God God will honor that so therefore denominations has no lines that they can set that will stop God to any certain Creed because God will look upon the motives of the human heart I'm pre preaching to as hard as I can I want us to understand God wants to save The Sinner but you got to want to be saved but he wants to save those that want to be saved sir amen he said God will look upon the motives of the human heart and there he will work from that spot if you have a desire to serve God that desire came from somewhere obey God and if you got something in your heart for god brother B said you won't express it and so forth just keep putting it off later on later on that little desire you once had to serve God will be taken away from you you might as well serve him the Bible says today the day of salvation now is the accepted time you might as well serve him now he said the devil will come in steal that away and then you won't have any desire to serve him if you just even if you just want to be in church Church Now's the Time to do it Romans 10:8 it says but what sayith that the word is not the even in thy mouth in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved Oh Glory to God what a promise that is for with the heart man believeth under righteousness but with the mouth confession is made to Salvation for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed but there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved got to have the right attitude coming the right way God can save anybody that's that's why the worst Spirit you can have is a religious spirit the worst thing you think you know everything that's the worst Spirit you can have on you worse than a drunker worse than a prostitute why because you think you're okay and you think you know everything but whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord would be saved whoever simple enough just say Lord I need saving yeah and I believe you're a savior Hallelujah you want to be saved cry out to him believe on him Hallelujah second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but as longsuffering to us we're not willing that any should pay perish but that all should come to repentance what should our attitude be towards the sinner what kind of people brother BR said ought we to be to realize that this day maybe the last day will ever be mortal tomorrow we may be immortal this is the only day we may ever have in our life the last meeting will ever set together and work for the kingdom of God how ought this meeting to be conducted tonight then we talked about this Wednesday night how ought this meeting to be conducted every one of us is a generator is a Dynamo we matter right our attitude matters and so brother BR said how about this meeting to be conducted with the very highest of reverence the truth is you don't know everything and there may be somebody sitting there that desperately needs help and your attitude matters towards that and he says how about this meeting with to be conduct with the very highest of reverence so with all of our hearts we're leaning to the Lord Jesus to give us every soul that's here that isn't converted to help do something that'll cause the unbeliever and the lukewarm to look on and receive the Lord Jesus Christ it'd be a selfish thing if a man's heart isn't out to save his brother there's something wrong with his heart no matter what condition if his brother hates him if his brother's against him if his brother's tried everything he can to tear him down yet that man's heart pulls for his brother he can't help it there's something in there that just calls out oh my brother you're wrong but I want you to be saved and therefore you try with everything that's in you to get your brother to believe with all his heart and come into the the kingdom of God brother B that's the kind of meeting we want to have every time every time we want to have that kind of a meeting he said I preached hundreds of thousand I preached just four or five but I wouldn't be any more sincere with 500,000 than I would be with five people because one soul is valued to God as 10,000 worlds I hope you're hearing me tonight listen brother brandham told a story about Ed he was with Ed bisc on a trip and they were they were with Bud Southwick you probably heard his name on the tapes he's with Bud Southwick and he's uh he is actually Bud's brother has epilepsy and Bud's just comeing beginning to believe and understanding brother Rand is a prophet and things and and his brother has Epsy his brother's not a Believer but he his wife is a Pentecostal lady but the BR said she's filled with the Holy Ghost and uh Bud's wife was a Pentecostal lady filled with the Holy Ghost but Bud was just now kind of becoming a Believer and Bud's brother had epilepsy well brother brandom uh Bud's telling him he said I wish my brother could get in the meetings brother Bram said well bring him down here and so he he didn't he brought him to Bud brought him to his house it's some 700 miles away goes and gets him and when he would have this epileptic fit everybody there would be afraid they'd just get really scared because this man had a problem and and he would get very angry and start tearing stuff up and you just having a fit and and so uh usually if that happened uh Mrs Southwick would grab her children run out the house but brother brandham told him something strange you know there's so much of the Gospel is just obedience just simply obeying the word and that proves Faith that's true right when we just obey God that's true you don't have to figure it out just do what God says right and and and this was just brother brand telling brother South he said next time it happens he said par his shirt off of him it don't make any sense throw it in the fire right and he and he'll that epilepsy will leave him right but that's what a prophet told him to do well you know that bud actually went out of the house and went on a a guiding trip to guide he was a guide in the wilderness and here's his his brother at home with his wife and and their children and it happened he had an epileptic fit and brother BR said instead of running out the door like she usually did what she did is she grabbed his shirt he said she jumped up on him like this and she grabbed that shirt and ripped it off of him and threw it in the fire and when she did what happened is the epilepsy left him why because oh Church what was it a man cared enough about his brother to bring him in the presence of a prophet to talk about him with a prophet and the prophet said this is what you got to do and when they did what the prophet said the epilepsy left listen to me church we have the words of a prophet today we have the words of God the god Prophet we've got the words of Christ if we'll just do what he says sir if we'll just follow what he says I believe our family can be saved let's do what he says but they had to care enough to do that well that won't work what do you mean tear his shirt off of him well you don't know if it'll work until you try it right and that's if if the if the holy spirit said to do it that's what to do now make sure it's God right you go tearing people's shirts off but oh church but we have a more sure word of Prophecy brother BR said we have something greater than the vision we have the word of God itself the faith in the word of God now look brother Brandon said we are in the battle now we're after our fallen brother that God before the foundation of the world saw and predestinated unto eternal life and the things of the world's him caught up in a whirlwind he's out into societies and classes him and his wife walking up and down the street smoking and drinking and carousing trying to find peace and the spirit of Christ in us as it would be in Abraham we're going after him with all the armors of God the angels of God encamped about we're going to bring back our fallen brother again he said watch Abraham in the 14th chapter the Blessed Spirit of Christ came upon him he went after his Fallen brother the spirit of Christ on Abraham went out back after his Fallen brother and brought him back Abraham the preacher of righteousness went after after his Fallen brother the denominational brother and brought him back brought him back so he'd have another chance after Satan had took him out brought him back to have Fellowship again what great regards did lot give to it did he go out with Abraham saying Father Abraham I've been wrong I know now I've mixed I missed the blessings I got carried away out there went out into the world now watch lot never did come back with Abraham he never did do it but Abraham still did what he was called to do and went down and and and got him but look he never did come all the way back he said he didn't say I know you brought me back I appreciate it I'll go and take the way with the Lord's sup few why he was just a penny but he couldn't even be a penny in the hands of the enemy real we pray for people that are not elect and believe God will heal them we don't know who is and who isn't but we pray for people that are pray for Sinners and believe God will heal them why do we do that why do we do that because we believe God's a savior he's a Healer right if they can have faith God can heal them we pray for our loved ones we pray for those that uh maybe seem like they've send away we pray for all of them right we we we're going out after them and we're going to treat them right we're going to treat them right but but by the same token we've got to understand that they're not going to necessarily be what we are right and you can't make somebody elected no amount of effort or forethought is going to make somebody want to serve God if they don't don't want to serve God let him go let him go be a lot right but if you try to make take lot and try to make him Abraham you'll have Strife right but now watch he said now he said I know you brought me back I appreciate I'll go and take the way of Lord SP you no he went right back down in Sodom again and there polluted into Sodom but watch Abraham what a beautiful thing it was when Abraham returned from the slaughter of the Kings watch what happened mzc come out to meet him mzc which was the king of Salem the king of peace the king of righteousness listen Genesis 14:17 the king of Sodom went out to meet meet him after his return from the slaughter of cheder and of the kings were with him the valley of shave which is the King's Dale and MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of heavens and earth and blessed be the most high God which ha delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all now I'm take a note on on this tithe not about the tithe but about how things carry down through family Generations the Bible says that Levi paid tithes in the loins of Abraham and brother Brandon picks that up and he said you mothers don't realize he said what you're doing with your daughters said one generation will be this way and the next generation will be that much worse and the next generation will be that much worse I'd commit them to God and let God take over their lives let God have them because just if they're just going to be a worse version of you otherwise because every generation goes down but here it worked the other way he paid tithes in the loins of Abraham and because he paid tithes in the loins of Abraham it was counted to his great-grandson are you with me now Abraham had what what was it it was it was mzc coming to to show that Abraham had the right motives and holding the meeting and fighting the battle if we can say it that way we want to have the right motives don't we we don't want to have church or have meetings just to have meetings we want to have church and have meetings for the right reasons Abraham fought the Battle for the right reasons Genesis 14:23 we know that because he he refused to become rich over it he said I will not take from a thread even to a shoe latchet I will not take anything that is Zine L thou should have say I have made Abram rich but now look after the battle is over we have a promise yeah what is it a meeting with MDC oh church as soon as the battle was over what did he bring out Bread and Wine the communion and remember Jesus said I won't take it again till I take it with you in my kingdom the communion he said they took communion after the battle was over let's fight now bring back the lost brother Jesus said I'll drink it a new with you in the father's Kingdom after the battle's over you say brother Ben you know you need to rest you need to stop you need to quit doing so much I'll rest when the battle's over brother John was one of my best friends in the world even though he was much older than me brother John baduka meant a lot to me but now he's resting his battle's over every one of us are going to reach that place one day one day we'll rest when the battle's over Church oh let's fight until we get there let's go get our fallen brother yes if you think I don't care you you misunderstand me I do care I want to see God's people I want to see God's people healed I want to see them protected I want to see them saved I want to see them I want to see people saved I I don't want to see one person lost I want everybody I preach to be saved but I realize they won't be but I want that I want that with all of my heart but I do have a promise of my family I do have a promise that if you're the elect of God you will make it right you can run but you can't hide right God's coming to get you yes oh Church look when he separated himself then God told Abraham stand up look to the east to the west to the north to the South said every bit of it belongs to you he said that was good enough it's all yours walk through it said I like that walk through it he said that's supposed to matter with the church today when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God every divine blessing in this Bible belongs to you said like a man buying a house he said if I bought a house I'd want to know what was in it if you bought a house it was furnished wouldn't you want to know what the furniture was this house is furnished he said when I got saved brother I took this old Treasure Book of God and look through it to see what I possessed I find out that every blessing someone say every blessing every blessing that's in that Bible belongs to me and it belongs to every believer oh I love that not just to a prophet but to every believer you say brother Ben it seems so Out Of Reach right now I'm not going to hold you much longer you say it's so Out Of Reach right now but don't you realize that brother B said when you're walking out there he said if it seems like to be a little out of my reach I'll pray till I get it Glory he said I I'll get a stool I'll stand up on something what what is I'll pray till I get it it might be Out Of Reach right now but now's not the time to give up pray till you get it Hallelujah every promise in the book is yours pray till you get it get up on the on the shelf and and find out what's yours and if you can't reach it keep believing God I say let's save our pennies yes sir let's be spiritually Frugal we're not walking around we're not walking around just throwing things away well let's save her pennies you never know might not even be a penny what do you do when you drop change on the ground what's the first thing I know what I do because me bending over the Penny's hardly worth it right so what do you do you first you look down and see what what it is what denomination it is right and if it's a penny you might just leave it there but if it's a silver dollar you don't but listen to me we don't know who's who right so we don't care what denomination it looks like that's true or what it's in what condition it's in we want to bend over and re reach down and pick it up if we can and some have compassion make a difference and others let God do God's work and our work is to pray let's not leave a hoof behind can we do that can we can we commit to that not one hoof behind I'm not content I'm not content to leave one behind we've had young people in this church from years ago that that have left went out in the world I'm not content to leave them behind let's see that they come back to the Lord mean you got children let's not be content Let's Get Down On Our Knees and begin to really pray amen we've seen God do it he's starting to do it let's just keep doing let's keep ping let's keep calling I'm not content that one to be left behind the people that I preach to I don't just not just for this church I want every Church to reclaim those that that that have been lost over the years sometimes a person's got to go out far enough in sin they realize they're a sinner so they can be saved say God let them come the spirit and the bride say come let them come be saved they won't be saved if they're fighting it but if God's got a hold of them in any in some way to tell them to pull them to call them they need to they need to come and they need to be saved let's bow our heads together maybe you don't feel worthy of of salvation but you are or he wouldn't call you in fact he he opened that up to everybody he has a right to have a family he has his elect but he opened up the opportunity for salvation even to Cain he opens it up to everybody but I believe if you're sitting here today you got a desire to be in the house of the Lord I believe you're the elect of God why don't you just give your heart over to him you young people don't wait don't wait give your heart to him now let him have control charge of your life see God moving on you I see I see that you have that you have conviction in your heart follow that let him lead you you're here today and you with every head bowed and every eye closed if you need that that salvation in your life you say Lord I I don't know I would you just cry out to him now and just talk to him you're welcome to come to the altar but you're welcome you you can you can meet him there why don't you just cry out to him say Lord I Want to Be Right I want to be saved I I'm not I don't want to be afraid of hell that's not no reason to there no reason to go to church or even to serve God but I know Lord that you love me or you wouldn't call me like you do you wouldn't put that desire in My Heart Lord I want to serve you all the rest of my life would you make that commitment I see these young people and different ones just make that commitment to him Lord I'm going to serve you there's more there's more we've seen several we've seen many come but there more but the CHP sitting back there running sound him and his mom come a couple years ago but there's more sister Stephanie s over here there's more there's more God's working can't you see that God's working
