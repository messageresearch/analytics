asked for gracious heavenly father how we love you tonight lord i i do count it and honor lord to get to speak the service tonight i i know it's not in man's ability or man's ideas oh but tonight we're asking that there'd be something that can be said lord i know my cry is to have more of you in my heart to have a renewal and i refill it something lord and get all this this the starch out of my heart or all the the stickiness of the world here tonight i i pray on this communion lord may i rededicate myself to you tonight father take everything out of me lord that shouldn't be there lord put uh take this heart of stone lord and put a a heart that's tender lords that can just take your word tonight lord and apply it to my life father we thank you lord we put the remaining part of this service in your hands in your precious and lovely name we pray amen and amen well how many loves the lord here tonight i heard you guys had a a good service i hate you have to hear me tonight but i pray there's something that can be said i had a thought on my mind um to speak and actually um the lord put another thought on my my heart so i pray that there'd be something that would be said here tonight if we can turn to james 1 and 12. like to say it's an honor to be here we don't get this way too often so i do appreciate your pastor extending his hand of invitation to us and um amen james 1 and 12 says blessed is the man that in due earth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither attempt that he any man but every man is tempted when he is thrown away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it brings forth sin and sin but it is finished bringeth forth death it says do not air my beloved brethren may the lord has blessed him to the reading of your word amen i tell you having these hooks on right here they're really nice but brother branham says here in perversion um he said when there was when was there any more a wicked in adulterous generation than we've got now when we're there more sin he says we've got more people on the earth right now they tell us as many people on the earth right now that's ever been on the earth since adam is on the earth right now he said this is that wicked and adulterous generation homosexuals perversion we can see that everything on the increased by thousands and thousands says churches fall away they're a heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god and if if i had a title tonight it would be the cycle of sin and if i like to take in parallel the first church age with our life if that's all right here tonight just i know it's a communion night so just give me 20 30 minutes of your time brother branham is identifying that there is more sin than ever before we can see that that churches are beginning to fall away the standards have dropped correction of the word a being preached like it used to be amen where the preaching of the word and its power and demonstration and authority is not being accepted anymore do you believe them or the power of god and i'm not saying it's here so don't get don't take the throne where the power of god can't move through a church anymore and change lives and break chains people are under the the attitude anymore well come to church pay my tithes do do my time and that's all there is for me but there can be a deliverance if you come to the house of god with an expectation god will come down and meet your need i believe that but we have to come to church with an expectation that god i'm not leaving here until i get something from you but churches anymore young people ain't seeking the holy ghost like they used to and be honest with you can't find a true blue sinner anymore it's hard to find someone that's just a true blue sinner and they you know it's just hard to find it but it wasn't so at the beginning do you believe that so we want to look at the root and the progression of sin if that's okay here tonight just like anything it starts out with a seed it's not something that has changed overnight but it's something that has been in work for some time at a very slow pace we you go out there i assume there's farmers here and you don't go out there and plant your corn or your crops and you you don't expect it to be grown by the next day but there is a process and it takes time for this seed to grow and people's idea and perception towards sin has changed with time do you believe that what what's evil is now good and what was what's good is is now evil our our view of the revealed word has changed over time people's minds have been programmed what was wrong is no longer wrong anymore or what was right it's no longer right but regardless of the change of time the message of the hour is still the same the bible and its power and authority is still the same the reason that god allowed the message to be recorded because that voice will never change no matter how satan has changed his tactics over time and the world has changed their their ideas on how things are the word has never changed and it will never change you believe that no matter what may blow against the message or the bible there is it will never change you can put your faith in that because you know god will never change if he promised to heal you back then he'll heal you today if he promised to deliver you then he will deliver you today that power is still very real tonight amen do you believe that if i can say this we don't need the prophet to come back that authority that he had is resting within the bride here tonight you believe that you can speak to your circumstance that authority is now here amen amen brother branham in the church agent seals taught us about the history and the condition of the church and how there was a cycle a process brother branham says here in the first seal now remember the anti-create christ and the beast is the same self-spirit there's the trinity yes sir it's three stages of the same devil power he said it had to be incarnated before it was crowned remember watch this three stages the first stage he called antichrist the second stage he called the false prophet in the third stage he called the beast we see the three stages we see there's a cycle before it can be crowned but it's still the same spirit as it was back then and the garment of it is the same spirit today it hasn't changed do you believe them so we see everything starts with a seed but in time it grows into a full grown tree and we can see how satan was first antichrist we understand that that's anything against the lord bear with me i'm getting somewhere with this in the second stage he was the false prophet and in the final state is the beast which is the incarnated devil we can see the devil being incarnated today brother branham taught us that that satan needs a vessel to work through just as god needs a body to work through where he can display himself satan also needs a body brother branham says satan is powerless without a body there would be no wickedness in this age if no one would allow the devil to take control of their body amen just as christ needs a body a vessel to demonstrate himself into a world today do you believe that and i believe there is a bride that christ is living through do you believe that amen revelations 1 2 and 1 says unto the angel the church of ephesus is right these things say he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works in thy labor and how thou s cannot bear them which are evil thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not as found them liars and as born and has patience for my namesake has labored now it's not faded nevertheless he says here i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love we see how the church ages have progressed and how that as individuals we also progress and i want to look at that first church age for a minute they saw the mighty acts of the holy ghost didn't they they see people influenced by god they've seen the dead rays they seen the sick hill they seen god walking right in the midst of them they had a fervent desire to please god didn't they and i'd like to go back and look at our lives how many remembers the time when we got saved you got saved and how on fire you were for god and how you know if you had the chance you would try to convert the whole world if you could you had such a desire to to express that the newfound joy that you had but after time just like anything we see here that the first church age after all that zeal and they became easy and they got used to the condition that they were in even as as our experiences grow sometimes we can grow relaxed in what god has given us sometimes we get to a place in our life to where that zeal that we once had was no longer there we've all been there i've been there many times and where once when we read the bible and listen to the message it had such a a a new a new found meaning to us but after time as time goes on before you know we're not reading the bible as much and before no before long we're not listening to the the message as much there comes a place in our experience where we must have a renewing of the holy ghost paul says i die what daily he's not dying weekly or monthly but it's something that is happening every day of his life and we get to a place where we can grow stagnant in our experience with god just like the first churches brother branham said they had the right spirit they had the new birth right there they had it but after time they left their first love and after time in our human walk with god it's very easy to do with all the the cares of life coming upon us and having a family and a job and before no it just we grow stagnant and what god has given us but there is a renewing here tonight where this communist service we don't have to leave the same but we can leave here so close to god i said this morning so close to god that the devil don't know what to do with you you could get to that experience with god but it takes a daily dining out where god i need you god not just coming to service on wednesday and sunday but every day that we wake up every morning that we wake up we get a new experience with god we can live so close to god that one day would be like enoch it rapture out of here it is happening but if satan had his way in your life he'd take your life like he did the rest of the world and just corrupt it and pollute it and throw you away satan don't care for you young people satan don't care what you do he is willing to destroy your life here tonight and we begin to see that the first church age relaxed in their experience brother branham says here at a prophet like unto moses he said as the conversation went on it must have been satan who looked out from behind the clouds and said i've caught them alone he's not with him now is my time to get even with him that's how satan walks that's the way he watches that's the opportunity he waits for is to get one time that we go out on what we call a little social fun or play card or tensor rally or something that isn't godly he waits to catch you off guard waits to get to a place where the church has got lukewarm has got too busy doing something else that is what he attacks he's away from them now is my opportunity brother branham is saying here satan is watching you looking for a weakness satan if i can say it like this is not stupid he won't attack you when you're at your your best he won't attack you when you're sitting on cloud nine or or when you just come out of a meeting he will attack you when you're at your lowest point in your life he will hit you with depression and oppression it seems like mental oppression is one thing that is on the rampage today is a mental oppression everybody's fighting depression and anxiety and and they're they're getting caught up right here and brother brown said the greatest battle ever fought is right here because if satan can get you down mentally he has got you beat so he's looking for a weakness in your life where he will come and attack you that's why we must always have our guard up and our shield up no matter what situations we're getting you say brother colby is it wrong to fight depression no no but you don't have to be succumbed by the depression we will fight anxiety in the lives that we live in but we don't have to be succumbed by it but we can overcome it you believe that the bible says that it was in the days of noah they were eating and drinking and marrying so they're doing these normal natural things but they were so caught up with the cares of life until god was pushed aside there's a reason why god is standing on the outside of the church in this age knocking knocking because the cares of life has pushed god right out you believe that so we see 20 years from the birth of the church they begin to get relaxed and in this relaxed stage satan came in and sold his seed just as he sowed his seed and eve satan will try to sow his seed in your heart by planting doubt planting fear planted uncertainty and depression but we may be living in an age of uncertainty but there is one thing that is certain that's the word of god and no matter what we go through in our natural life the word of god promised that he would never leave you nor forsake you that he would be there until the very end and i believe no matter what we go through god will be there to guide us but satan will try to plant the doubt of fear and doubt and anxiety and we can see that in our natural walk we don't pray as we used to we don't read as we used to we become relaxed in the experience that we once have but just like if i could say this just like a marriage i'm not relying on the experience i first had when i first got married to my wife but i'm hoping that that love is getting stronger and stronger every day going on in 10 years of marriage and be honest i i've got blessed with a a beautiful wife and she's not here tonight um the lord has blessed me but if i am not careful i can grow stagnant even in that relationship but brandon says the natural always types the spiritual and if our love and renewal for our my wife must be daily renewed daily renewed what about our walk with god if we want our our marriage to prosper we must have a love shown to her day in and day out what about with god if we want our walk to to to flourish with god we must have a daily renewal but we see at the beginning once the zeal was taken away from once they became relaxed we see the beginning of the downfall of the church brother branham says here they have the right spirit they were writing a book of acts then they lost their passion they lost their zeal they backslid the ephesian age has presented to her the opportunity for god's best and for a while she prevailed and then relaxed and in that unguarded moment satan planted the seed of complete ruin if we can turn to jude one and one and one just give me a few minutes more minutes we'll we don't want to take up too much time for tonight jude wanted one when you there say amen so jew the servant of jesus christ and the brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserve in jesus christ and cult mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints we see that satan didn't move and in full force but he moved in under cover do you believe that as a spirit as an anointing an angel of light as a deception he moved in i'm so glad for the message of the hour that actually showed us what this deception looks like that showed us what this angel of light looks like you believe it and you know it would be very easy you know if i knew that i was going to have a a a a robber come in and break in at my house at a certain certain time i would be prepared for it i would be ready for this guy when he came in and we can see here that the message came and revealed to us what is taking place so we would be ready do you believe that paul says here beware of wolves and sheep's clothing and we can see that in a tiny way a tiny sea that you can see the manifestation of this seed this is the harvest time where both seeds are coming to manifestation you believe that we understand that at the beginning when the seeds were planted that it was hard to tell them apart but now we're coming to the fruition of what these seeds are and we can see the manifestation of it amen brother branham says here that the ephesian age to the christianity at ephesus was where the jews lived at ephesus and it was founded about a.d 53 or 55 christianity was planted there by saint paul later saint paul spent three years at ephesus paul's teaching brought great influence to the believers at ephesus next timothy was the first bishop of the church at ephesus paul wrote to the church at ephesus it says in paul's top it was a great church but ephesus means the very name of ephesus means let go relaxed backslidden which was called by god the backslidden church god acknowledged their first works he said their labor their patience but god rebuked their living leaving their first love for backsliding for no longer bearing light we see here satan is always looking for an entrance he will come in gently so suddenly we don't realize that it's even there and then before we realize it he becomes very harmful amen brother can i continue on in this quote brother branham says here in the ephesian age in the church age book chapter 3 the very name ephesus has a strange compound meaning aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this church that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the death of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god began to give way to a less watchful attitude a lesser dent following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that on the future ages of the physical vehicle called the church was sink to the awfulness of the depths of satan it had become relaxed it was drifting already the age was backsliding it had left its first love the tiny seed planted at the ephesian age would one day grow in the spirit of error until all foul birds of the air would roost in its branches so offensive to a human reasoning that that little plant appeared in the new eve the new church then again she would be deceived by satan and says the ephesian age had presented to her the opportunity for god's best and for a while and then she relaxed and in that unguarded moment satan planted his seed of complete run brother branham also says here this guy isn't called nothing to see he's a white horse the rider has no arrows for his bow did you notice that he had a bow but there there's nothing said about having any arrows he's a bluff here tonight and i can say that satan is a bluff here tonight he wants to make you feel that he's got control over your life but let me tell you something he has a ball with no arrows he has a bark but he has no body you don't have to be deceived by what satan is telling you there's a lot of mind battles that we face that we're not worthy enough that we're not good enough that this message ain't for us if it wasn't for you you wouldn't be sitting here tonight god could have left you in the state that you were in but he felt it is hard to call you and bring you out amen do you believe that he wanted you he longed for you that's the reason he came down so for the bread was saying here he's a bluff tonight don't be succumbed right here in the mind says here right but maybe he's got a lot of thunder but no lightning but you find out christ has both lightning and thunder for out of his mouth goes in two uh sharp two edges sore and he smites the nation with it this guy can't smite nothing see he's playing the part of a hypocrite and he's going forth riding as a white horse going out to conquer now also in the same message brother branham says here a white horse rider went out see he's mighty in his conquering power he's a great fellow in his conquering power you want to tell you want me to tell you who he is he's the antichrist exactly what he is now because you see if an antichrist jesus said the two would be so close together that would it deceive the very elect if i'm so glad for the word if if it were possible but it says here it is not possible are you so thankful for that that we won't be deceived amen but we see here if i can continue on just a little longer sid never starts fully grown if we seen the devil for what he really is we would have no part of him we'd want nothing to do with the sin but he has come in as an angel of light it starts out very small do you believe it but with a tiny seed a tiny spirit something that didn't seem harmful has now turned into something very harmful and if i can use this illustration the same as a a young man or a girl that has feelings for one another and if we're not careful satan can take those feelings and pervert them it takes just a brief moment of holding hands and then a hug they didn't embrace and before you know they have completely committed or submitted to the devil and satan has taken their time and his church and perverted it we see satan came into something that was so inoffensive so slightly so cunningly something that didn't seem bad at all are you with me here this tonight revelation 6 2 is said then i saw a and behold a white horse he thou sat on him had a bowl and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer brother branham says here in the ephesian age he says the very religion of ephesians types out perfectly the first church age and it sets the tenor of of ages to come in the first place the magnificent temple of diana that was so many years in building housed in its sacred courts the most lustrous and obstructive image of dying that one could imagine she was absolute absolutely unlike any other images seated and the other temples dedicated to her she was simply an almost shapeless female figure that finally sunk in a block of wood from which she was carved and her two arms were formed of two simple iron bars and perfectly this depicts the spirit of the antichrist loosed in the first age that he was loosed in the midst of the people yet took no shape as to alarm to people yet the two arms of iron bars showed that it was his intent to crush the work of god as he made his enroll so no one noticed what he was doing but one day they wouldn't notice that with these arms of iron his deeds became a doctrine and his doctrine became the law of an empire you believe it the sin in ephesus was so shapeless it didn't alarm anybody but brother bram says here satan presented something to them it came in his purpose was to destroy that age and satan's purpose in our life is to destroy your life do you believe it amen brother branham says here but this that thou has that thou hateth the deeds of the nickelodeons which i hate the true vine hated the formal deeds of the nickelodeon so did god what deeds in the ephesian age in the church of ephesus became a doctrine in the pergamos church and in ephesus the first church it was a it was a deeds and the next church became a doctrine can you hear it do you understand it now it was a deed in ephesus and watch over here in pergamus it became a doctrine it just started there in a little baby form now in a minute we're going to find out what that was he says now in paul's wolves is the deeds of the nickelodeons can we turn to revelations two and six give me 15 more minutes i hope this is a blessing here tonight this is not a beat down i promise we're going to get to something good here in a minute if revelations two and six foot this that thou has that thou hate is the deeds of the niculadians which i also hate we understand that a deed was just a saying he presented it in such a way that it looked so good that he wasn't trying to kill but that was his purpose amen amen can we turn to also daniel 11 21. amen daniel 11 and 21 it says and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they should not give the honor of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries brother branham says here remember in the church ages when we opened the first church age back then we found out the holy spirit was against a certain thing that got started in that church age and that was called the deeds of the nickelodeons you remember nicole means to conquer laity means the church the laity nickelodeons to conquer the laity to take the holy spirit out of the church and give it to one holy man and we can see that's what satan is trying to do is take the power of god out of the churches amen take the deliverance that god has out of the churches where it's a powerless church today but i believe that there is a powerful church here tonight that will not be succumbed by the devil's tactics but will would attack him and destroy him with power and authority you believe that says notice nicholaity a saiyan in one church it became a doctrine in the next church age and in the third church it was enforcement and they had the nazi council and it was there made a doctrine in a church the seed that was planted grew from a deed into a doctrine because it was not removed as a seed and we all know according to the law of growing only the only way for anything to grow is to water it to have the proper ground and the proper sunlight for you we can prevent doubt from plant being planted in our mind and grow it if we don't water it do you believe that we don't have to let fear be planted in our mind we can we can cut it off we can stop the root of bitterness you believe it amen okay we'll move on so we see here that one seed made a way for every demonic spirit of hell to be unleashed brother branham says here if i can continue on with this quote to see how it started in the early church it was called deeds then it became a doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way it finally took over and god was pushed aside oh it started so small so quietly so inoffensively it looked so good it seemed so sound then i caught hold and like a python and squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality that was in the church there was a false vine oh that false vine is subtle it's like an angel of light until it gets a hold of you now i want to say that i believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men i believe in i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming through the word do you believe that because i believe also that god has sent men in church men are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe that i believe also that the church is ruled over by men that god has sent to take charge but that rule is by the word so that is not every man really ruling but the spirit of god for the word and the spirit are one i'm going to skip through some of this here that's why sin cannot be tolerated in the body do you believe it sin is like a cancer it starts with just a backslidden cell and from there it grows until it finally destroys that person's life until god intervenes you believe that but i believe god can deliver amen so we see sin always progresses sin has the quality of leaven if anything that is contrary to the word comes into your life it will grow into the entire cycle just give me 10 minutes 10 minutes i'm watching the clock here so we see that this cyclist the antichrist false prophet and then the beast so we understand the best time to kill anything is in the early stage the further sin progresses the harder it is to deal with it the further anybody allows sin to grow in their life the more beast-like it will become the cycle of sin a deed that you hate you hate what you've done but remember sin has the quality of leaven it will grow and mature and then it becomes a doctrine then you're re then you reason why you're doing this and you come to the place where you're justifying yourself and while you do a certain thing then you become a false prophet now you have a teaching on why you're doing what you're doing amen and then it moves into a crown where it receives a a full endorsement we understand that it always takes time for anything for people to get used to something an earring in a man's ear was evil in 1960 but we looked down in 2020 going to 2021 it is acceptable for a man to wear earrings a woman cutting her hair and wearing trousers was evil in the 1950s but now after time in 2020 it is now it's accepted evil for a man to wear a neck chain or an arm chain but now it is accepted even the cycle of homosexuality it was once done in secret it was a curse in the family but now it is openly accepted and now it's a hate crime for you to speak against it it was a sin it was unacceptable it was disgusting for for someone to be gay but now you're the disgusting one if you talk against it it has come to a full cycle now what is good is evil what is evil is now good and acceptable if there's ever a time to make a stand it is right now is there ever a time to say i will now allow that junk in my family's home it is right now satan is on the prowl and if he can sneak in you're i don't care what it is through this or through watching this movie or doing that satan will get to you but right now it's a time to take a stand and say no i am not allowing you devil in my home in my mind because he will come in so subtly so unaware before we know it he has completely took that family took the church you believe it amen but i'd like to say no matter how society changes god's voice is still the same through all the darkness and the gloom that we living in there is still a light and there's still a voice that will will never change that will never be overcome by the devil amen can i continue on just a little longer amen first peter 2 and 6 says in churning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemning them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly and deliver just lot vexed with filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day locked became vexed became weak became wore down by the condition that he was in and we can take it and look at lord's life and apply it to us if we're not careful we'll become weak with the conditions that we're living in we're living in such a hellish conditions if we're not careful satan can come in and wear us down with all the thoughts and but here tonight we can be renewed how many needs are renewing how many will say lord i need you here tonight he's here to do so amen i believe that we'll continue on just a little longer here so we see here james 1 15 says then when lust hath conceived and bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not air my beloved brethren it starts with a desire a lost then it is but only one remedy that can stop the cycle of sin and we can read it right here in revelations 2 15. so it says thou also them that hold the doctrines of the nickelodeons which i hate repent or else i will come quickly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth repent quickly it says brother branham says here we learn in no certain terms that this false vine is the vine of satan their gathering is of him saying they meet in the name of god and lie that they are christ's they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by god to the church yet they are not of god but since they say they are god will hold them responsible and at each age he speaks of them and to them they remind us exactly of balaam he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto god as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beast yet he was not a true word prophet for when god told them not to go honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway he was mo motivated by his lust for gold and prestige god let him go the perfect will of god gave him gave way to the permissive will of god because of the heart desire of balaam god actually said go ahead did god change his mind no sir god had his way regardless of balaam going balaam did not annul the will of god god had his way regardless it was balaam who was the loser for he bypassed the word but lebron says this here as musicians get ready to come it says your eternal destination is a choice and maybe some of you tonight will make that choice where you will spend eternity and before the service ends tonight there will be one time if you turn god down many times there'll be one time you turn him down for the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment it is a dangerous thing for a man or a woman or girl to step across that line for there's no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it might be the time that many will make their decision where will we spend our endless eternity if i can say this tonight put an end to sin before it has ever crowned before it ever gets too far in our life tonight let's make a new dedication to god and say you know what i've i've allowed things in my life but tonight lord i need i need you to come down and renew my vision i've gotten tired i've gotten weary i've gotten weak in my fight with the devil but tonight god can renew you he can take the skills off your eyes i believe that don't you there's nothing too impossible for god no how many has ever had did a flower been no i wanted to until i seen how much work was involved in it but my mom and dad has a a beautiful flower bed and it took them months and tons of money to to get this flower bed to where it was beautiful and i remember my mother being out there on the first flower bed the first day was done you see a little weed pop up oh my mom was out there plucking that thing out faster than she was quick well the next day you know how weeds grow they continue to grow they never die so she goes over there and and plucks it out again well before you before you knew it she lost the zeal and the newness of this flower that was once new was now it's 110 degrees outside or whatever it was and she's looking at her flower bed and seeing these weeds grow and she's like you know what i'll go off there and i'll just cut them off so she cut them off and before long these weeds have grown and overtook her flower bed and she's like you know what i'm not even going to deal with it i'll just i'll do it tomorrow well now the weeds have overtaken her flower bed and and she grew lazy and helped my mom stop watching this and and lax did it instead of cutting and plucking them up by the rushing which is going just cutting them off cut we're getting a weeder josh go out there well these things are popping up and if we can take this and apply it to our lives we don't need to just cut off the problem in our life we need to pluck it out by the roots and because that problem that we face and fight we'll come back again and again and again that's where god can come down here tonight and he cannot just cut it off but he can completely pull it out by the roots in your life how many wants that here tonight see i'm more down lord with the cares of life i know this was a weird message for a communion service so forgive me in that aspect but i pray for myself lord i need a refueling may not leave this service here the same but lord lord as i see the the times changing and the conditions that we're living in lord may i never grow relaxed may i never get cold and informal in the experience that i have with you but lord may my love be ever growing if there's ever a time but we need to get closer to god it's now we can see prophecies prophecies being fulfilled at a rapid rapid rapid pace this is the time that we must sincerely seek god because he is coming he is coming i don't want to be left behind but i want to have oil in my lamp i want my land being trimmed for when he comes i will be ready heavenly father lord we love you tonight i know this was an odd message for our community service but i felt this was the direction that we needed to go and lord i pray here tonight that you can renew the minds renew the vision the zeal the pasture that we've had renew renew that tonight lord i know we get tired i know we get weary from fighting day in and day out lord and we ever we wonder if it will ever end but we know there's a promise that you're coming soon there's a land that was made for the overcomer lord give us the strength to endure just a little longer lord lift up the hands of the weak lord the feeble father the ones that don't feel like they can endure tonight lord give the strength to endure coming down lord and refresh our minds refresh our experience tonight oh we thank you for all you've done amen playing it's already done praise the lord [Music] the battle is over victory is one it's already done [Music] hallelujah [Music] hold your hand up to the lord and say i believe this it's [Music] already [Music] and we're going to give you just a minute i believe the lord spoke to brother colby to come by and and speak these words to us tonight and there must be a reason for that and maybe there's something in your life that is just a seed that's there maybe it's just a thought maybe just a little bit of irritation with someone or just something that's there and satan would like to grow that into a root of bitterness and satan would like to take that whatever that is maybe that thought that you had and make it something that would dominate your life why don't you just ask the holy spirit to come down we'll just take a moment and say lord if there's any seeds of sin in my life anything that's not right lord take it out of me tonight i know i'm saved i know i'm a child of god but if there's something there that would get in the way of my communion with you would you just take that out of me lord and just just talk to him like that for a moment heavenly father we believe lord what was said tonight that satan would like to come in just like a a a white horse rider lord and some seem like so simple and and so pleasant but lord we see the end of it is death and the wages of sin is death lord i pray for myself tonight if there's anything that's unlike you that we come to the communion table lord we ask you to take it out lord we believe and we know that you're able to do that and so we come with our simple faith tonight and believe that you're able to remove these things from our life that are unlike you father may we worship you and realizing that just in a moment we can be forgiven lord we thank you for that thank you that there's an advocate that we have and we thank you for this time you've given us to remember you in everything we pray in jesus name amen amen if the brothers would come [Music] and we'll uh we'll have you come and uh if you could have a brother direct the people to come if you could just continue playing um we're going to read first corinthians chapter 11. once we're done with the communion i'll give you an opportunity to be dismissed if you don't want to take part in the foot washing service or you can't for some reason [Music] first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he ends up saying this cup is the new testament of my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home that you come not together into condemnation the rest will i set an order when i come heavenly father lord jesus we have the bread lord as a representative of your broken body i pray god that as it passes through lord the bodies of these people that take it i pray lord that as a body we would be whole it would be one you were broken so we could be whole we thank you for that father i pray that as the elements pass through the body that there would be healing take place tonight lord we believe that it could happen and we know we believe your word lord we're doing this by faith knowing there's nothing lord in in the bread or the wine but it's our faith in believing what you did for us that day thank you for that i pray you'd grant it now to each one give strength to our bodies we pray in jesus name heavenly father over the wine i pray god that you would just come and lord as the wine flows through may there be stimulation of revelation flow through our bodies lord father where there's any healing that needs to take place or whatever needs to happen in our in our lives lord maybe those little things we confess tonight lord may you as the lord as we partake of this spine may there be a just an understanding of what you did for us on calvary and that your blood was shed for my sin lord and for the sins of each one of these people i pray god
