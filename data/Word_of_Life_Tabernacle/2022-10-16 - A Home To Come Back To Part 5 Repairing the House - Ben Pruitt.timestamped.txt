[50:12] of you that went to the tent meetings I
[50:14] know some of you couldn't go but for
[50:16] those of you that could I really
[50:17] appreciated that so many of you went on
[50:20] Wednesday night and if you go back some
[50:22] of you that weren't there on Friday
[50:24] night but if you go back to Friday
[50:25] night's sermon by the Wayne Lawson

[50:34] when we let out service Wednesday night
[50:36] that was the same text and scriptures
[50:39] and quote that he was gonna he came from

[50:44] just the Lord that was confirming that
[50:46] for us and and relating out our services
[50:49] here so I appreciate you going and those
[50:51] of you that could and we're glad to see
[50:53] you this morning it's good to be in the

[50:57] every one of you Second Kings 12 and 4
[51:00] and joash fed to the priest all the
[51:03] money of the dedicated things that is
[51:06] brought into the house of the Lord
[51:08] even the money of everyone that passes
[51:10] the account the money that every man is
[51:13] set at and all the money that cometh
[51:15] into any man's heart to bring into the
[51:17] house of the Lord
[51:18] let the priests take it to them every
[51:21] man of his acquaintance now watch when
[51:24] I'm preaching about money this morning I
[51:26] want you to watch what they did to let
[51:28] them repair the breaches of the house
[51:31] wheresoever any breach
[51:33] shall be found
[51:35] I pray the Lord without his Blessing to
[51:37] the word you may be seated
[51:39] I want to continue to speak this morning
[51:41] on a home to come back to a home to come
[51:45] back to and we'd like to talk this
[51:47] morning on repairing the house
[51:50] preparing the house
[51:52] when Solomon built the temple in
[51:54] Jerusalem it was a magnificent building
[51:56] it was perfect in its design
[52:00] the plans came from David who received
[52:03] them by Revelation from Jehovah himself
[52:06] in first Chronicles 28 11 it says David
[52:09] gave to Solomon his son the pattern of
[52:12] the porch and of the houses thereof and
[52:14] of the treasuries thereof upper chambers
[52:17] thereof of the inner parlors of the
[52:19] place of the mercy seat and the pattern
[52:21] of all that he had by the spirit of the
[52:24] Courts of the house of the Lord and of
[52:26] all the chambers round about
[52:29] of the treasuries of the house of God of
[52:32] the treasuries of the dedicated things
[52:34] and then he goes on in verse 19 he said
[52:37] all this said David the Lord made me
[52:40] understand in writing by his hand upon
[52:43] me so in other words David was drawing
[52:46] in Inspiration he was actually drawing
[52:48] out the blueprint of the temple but he
[52:51] wasn't doing it out of his own mind but
[52:54] he was doing it under the inspiration of
[52:56] the Holy Spirit and when he drew it out
[52:58] he said he said in writing by his hand
[53:00] upon me even all the works of this
[53:03] pattern and so God actually it come from
[53:05] the not from the mind of David but it
[53:08] actually come from the mind of God
[53:10] himself that he drew out the pattern of
[53:13] of the thing that he had that had in
[53:16] God's mind I want you to understand
[53:18] today Not only was the temple built that
[53:20] way but the church was built that way
[53:23] your family was built that way that
[53:25] there's something about it that I feel
[53:28] like my monitors are gone this morning
[53:29] morning but it's something about it that
[53:31] it feels like that that God had it in
[53:35] his mind and you come down to the age
[53:37] that we live in and you realize that
[53:39] God's design has been broken up but we
[53:42] don't have to be broken up right we
[53:44] don't have to follow the design of Satan
[53:46] for the temple because we have the mind
[53:49] of God in this hour the message of the
[53:51] hour that tells us what a family should
[53:53] be what a church should be
[53:56] that's what they had in the temple it
[53:58] was the design if you go back to Moses
[54:00] he also designed it in the same way that
[54:03] it was designed in such a pattern that
[54:05] God himself it was the mind of God that
[54:08] come down and made a tabernacle and made
[54:10] a temple and brother random say he made
[54:12] it like the one fact of scripture says
[54:14] he made it like the one in heaven
[54:16] amen and so a God he imposed his mind on
[54:21] if you translated Supernatural things
[54:24] into natural things and he had that in
[54:27] his mind and he put that in the design
[54:29] of the temple and in the design of the
[54:31] family God has translated what was in
[54:34] his mind in a supernatural form and he's
[54:36] translated those thoughts down into a
[54:39] natural form
[54:40] into how a husband treats his wife how a
[54:43] wife treats her husband how children
[54:45] should be what how a church should
[54:48] operate how the pastor should be and
[54:50] what the deacons should be and all of
[54:52] those things they didn't come from the
[54:53] mind of a man that come from the mind of
[54:56] God
[54:57] so we can't just change those things say
[55:00] well I don't feel like it should be that
[55:01] way I'll just go a different direction
[55:03] no it didn't come from the mind of a man
[55:06] it come from the mind of God himself
[55:09] we believe that today
[55:11] hey man the way we should have church
[55:13] and how we how we should worship God all
[55:16] of those things it was the pattern acts
[55:18] too what's the pattern that God had in
[55:21] his mind
[55:22] are you with me this morning
[55:25] the pattern came from God
[55:28] and when it was finished it must have
[55:30] been glorious
[55:35] can you imagine walking into the temple
[55:37] for the cave
[55:38] it wasn't no small thing it was one of
[55:40] the wonders of the world
[55:42] when they walked into the temple grounds
[55:45] first you come into the outer courts
[55:47] which was very large
[55:49] and you would see a great brass sea or a
[55:52] Laver a brass a great like a bowl a
[55:55] brass out there in in front of the
[55:57] temple that they would use for the for
[56:00] the water in and the blood and they
[56:02] would they would use it in there with
[56:04] instance burning going up to God and as
[56:07] you walked inside the temple you find
[56:08] that the entire Temple was overlaid with
[56:11] gold
[56:13] the whole thing and this is a fairly
[56:16] large building
[56:17] that was actually completely overlaid
[56:20] with gold
[56:22] they tell us that to build that building
[56:24] today would cost between three and six
[56:26] billion dollars
[56:29] to rebuild the Temple
[56:31] three and six billion dollars
[56:34] but God had it in his mind
[56:37] right so they spared no expense
[56:39] the everything was done in fact the
[56:42] Bible tells us to not the sound of a saw
[56:44] or a hammer wasn't heard in that Temple
[56:46] and when you would have walked in the
[56:48] craftsmanship was so perfect they didn't
[56:50] cover up their mistakes everything was
[56:52] just right it was built just right
[56:53] because the workmen were even inspired
[56:56] to fulfill the mind of the Lord in
[56:58] building that Temple and when they
[57:01] walked in when you walked into it you
[57:03] come in and it was all inspiring you
[57:05] come into the holy place with the main
[57:07] part of the temple you walk into the
[57:09] holy place and here here was the great
[57:12] place where there would be a a gold over
[57:15] everything and and here would be an
[57:17] altar and there was a place where there
[57:20] would be an altar and a place to altar
[57:21] of incense but then inside was the holy
[57:24] of holies which was a small room and
[57:27] inside of the holy of holies was the was
[57:30] The Mercy Seat which was the lid that
[57:32] went over the Ark of the Covenant inside
[57:33] of that was the law of God
[57:36] they actually at that time still had the
[57:38] tablets of Moses that he remade after he
[57:41] broke the original ones he had the
[57:42] tablets of Moses on the inside and so
[57:45] there was the law of God it was so
[57:47] perfect and so beautiful yes that's
[57:49] right
[57:51] you would have thought
[57:53] that they would have wanted to keep it
[57:55] up
[57:57] you would have thought that would there
[57:58] would have been something in them but
[58:00] the Joel that would have won it
[58:02] keep that temple in that pristine
[58:04] condition
[58:07] are you with me this morning
[58:09] and just like your house you know I look
[58:12] at my house my house wasn't designed by
[58:13] God
[58:16] because if God would have designed it he
[58:17] would have put some things in different
[58:19] places
[58:21] because there's some things that are
[58:22] just odd about my house so it was built
[58:24] and I'm not complaining it's just
[58:26] whoever built it we like we love our
[58:28] home but it was just built in an odd way
[58:30] it's a Cherokee Village house if you
[58:32] from Cherokee Village you know what I'm
[58:34] talking about
[58:35] so there's just an odd design to it and
[58:39] many times we you know the very best
[58:41] that you could take the care to design
[58:43] something and you would design a home
[58:45] maybe and you build it just exactly the
[58:47] way you want it to be but when you get
[58:48] done you might say well I wish I'd have
[58:50] put the uh the pantry over there or I
[58:53] wish I'd have put the laundry room out
[58:55] here and in our house the laundry room
[58:57] was in the basement so somebody gets to
[58:59] carry the laundry up and down the stairs
[59:01] all the time and and so you just little
[59:04] things like that and you think oh I wish
[59:06] I'd have done that differently once you
[59:08] start living in it but nobody ever
[59:09] thought that about the temple because
[59:11] this was God's house this was God's
[59:13] Divine listen to me I want to get that
[59:15] to you this morning your family is God's
[59:17] design
[59:19] our families are God's design our
[59:22] churches should be God's designs
[59:25] not ours
[59:26] we don't make the church in our image
[59:30] how we want it to be
[59:32] right we don't make our families in our
[59:34] image how we want them to be but we
[59:38] strive to find the mind of the Lord I
[59:40] may want to do that this morning Lord I
[59:42] want your mind I I want my family and
[59:45] your did you tell me Lord howdy what did
[59:47] you tell me to do how did you tell me
[59:48] that
[59:50] hey man
[59:52] amen now
[59:53] a church or a family is the same as a
[59:56] house
[59:57] in that constant care must be taken or
[1:00:00] they'll crumble
[1:00:03] no it had been about 120 years
[1:00:07] since Solomon built the temple
[1:00:10] but there were some very specific
[1:00:12] reasons why that when you come down to
[1:00:15] the time of joash after a thalia's reign
[1:00:18] and now joash realizes that the house of
[1:00:20] God has been broken up
[1:00:23] the house of God has been broken up and
[1:00:25] there were some very specific reasons
[1:00:27] why the house of God was broken up and
[1:00:30] we're going to talk about those this
[1:00:31] morning but I want you to understand
[1:00:33] that it doesn't help you to dwell
[1:00:35] especially when it comes to family life
[1:00:37] or even with church life it doesn't help
[1:00:39] you to look back and say well this is
[1:00:41] why it was broken up if that's all you
[1:00:43] do is look back and realize why it was
[1:00:46] broken up but what you want to do is how
[1:00:48] to how do we repair this
[1:00:50] how do we fix this because and again you
[1:00:53] say well that would never happen to me
[1:00:55] but constant care must be taken or the
[1:00:58] house of God crumbles
[1:01:00] constant care must be taken or your
[1:01:02] family crumbles you know what I'm
[1:01:04] talking about this morning when it comes
[1:01:06] to your own spiritual walk with God you
[1:01:08] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost how
[1:01:10] many knows the Bible teaches that today
[1:01:12] well you're all tired this morning
[1:01:14] the Bible teaches that the holy uh you
[1:01:17] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost if you
[1:01:19] are the Temple of the Holy Ghost what
[1:01:21] does that tell us it tells us that
[1:01:23] constant care must be taken or even
[1:01:26] Solomon's Temple a predestinated temple
[1:01:28] from the mind of God could fall into
[1:01:30] disrepair yes if somebody's not there
[1:01:34] that's why God called Ephesians 4 11.
[1:01:36] that's why he called a five-fold
[1:01:37] Ministry he called those workmen to come
[1:01:40] in and begin to work on the temple to
[1:01:42] keep it up and keep it repaired and keep
[1:01:44] the and keep the gold on and keep the
[1:01:46] keep the wood in the right place he
[1:01:48] called he called Ben to do that and he
[1:01:50] called you Mom and Dad to do that in
[1:01:52] your family
[1:01:54] he called you to lead your family in
[1:01:56] prayer he called you to be a servant to
[1:01:59] you the people
[1:02:00] to your family
[1:02:02] are you hearing me this morning
[1:02:05] amen
[1:02:07] so there was a very specific reason
[1:02:09] though why this Temple was in disrepair
[1:02:10] in second chronicles 24 7 the sons of
[1:02:13] Italian
[1:02:15] that Wicked Woman
[1:02:17] and remember we typed that to this age
[1:02:19] that we're living in
[1:02:20] this age of the spirit of Jezebel which
[1:02:23] was who was a thalia's counselor
[1:02:25] remember Jezebel was taught by a value
[1:02:29] was taught by Jezebel how to be what she
[1:02:32] was
[1:02:32] and so now that Wicked woman teaches a
[1:02:35] value who become the only queen of Judah
[1:02:38] in fact she become the only completely
[1:02:41] unrighteous one that that served that
[1:02:44] was the ruler of Judah because she
[1:02:47] wasn't in the line of David and remember
[1:02:49] the promise had been that there would
[1:02:51] not be a break in the line of David
[1:02:54] remember that and there wasn't until the
[1:02:56] kingdom was completely overthrown so the
[1:02:58] line of David continued on but it
[1:03:01] continued on in secret
[1:03:03] because joash was being hit in the
[1:03:04] temple
[1:03:06] right so if Talia is taking rulership
[1:03:08] over the land and so now she had Sons
[1:03:12] and her sons
[1:03:14] those that Wicked woman's Sons had
[1:03:17] broken up
[1:03:18] the house of God
[1:03:21] oh I'm going to preach this morning
[1:03:25] God help us today
[1:03:28] and also all the dedicated things
[1:03:31] of the house of the Lord did they bestow
[1:03:34] upon Balaam
[1:03:37] that word broken up is to tear apart or
[1:03:39] tear away or to tear off for one from
[1:03:43] oneself
[1:03:44] to be broken off
[1:03:47] and so those princes of Judah who should
[1:03:50] have been caring for the upkeep upkeep
[1:03:53] of the house of God instead used it for
[1:03:55] personal gain
[1:03:58] now watch what they were doing and and
[1:04:00] they were actually going into the house
[1:04:02] of God but you know what's odd about it
[1:04:04] you know Joe Ash notices it but where
[1:04:08] were the priests
[1:04:10] where were the men because this would be
[1:04:13] like excuse me you trustees this morning
[1:04:15] but this would be like the trustees
[1:04:17] because that's what the the princes of
[1:04:20] Israel were in the position of like a
[1:04:21] trustee they were responsible they
[1:04:24] weren't ministers but they were
[1:04:25] responsible for keeping the upkeep of
[1:04:27] that Temple and and the City
[1:04:29] but for taking care of God's people in
[1:04:31] that way
[1:04:32] and so here are the princes of of Israel
[1:04:34] be like the trustees coming to the
[1:04:36] church stealing microphones
[1:04:38] taking away the chairs
[1:04:40] and taking the paint off the walls it'd
[1:04:42] be like Brother David walking in one day
[1:04:44] and say I think I need an organ in my
[1:04:45] house taking it home
[1:04:49] where were the people at
[1:04:51] I tell you where they were at not in the
[1:04:53] house of God
[1:04:54] because if they'd have been in the house
[1:04:56] of God they would have noticed
[1:04:59] God help us today
[1:05:01] they would have noticed that those
[1:05:03] things were missing
[1:05:06] yes they didn't notice
[1:05:08] again you said brother Ben we have a
[1:05:10] house of God it's wonderful but I'm
[1:05:12] talking spiritually now
[1:05:14] spiritually now when things begin to go
[1:05:17] missing and people don't notice
[1:05:19] people don't notice nobody says anything
[1:05:22] well because it's a princely he's got a
[1:05:24] big name he he belongs you know he he
[1:05:27] he's around the message he got a big
[1:05:28] name I don't care who it is taking stuff
[1:05:31] that doesn't belong to them out of the
[1:05:32] house of God we should not allow it
[1:05:34] again I'm talking spiritually now there
[1:05:37] ain't nobody stealing stuff but what's
[1:05:38] he trying to steal trying to steal your
[1:05:40] joy trying to steal your peace trying to
[1:05:42] steal the things of God Your god-given
[1:05:44] Righteous children of God Satan wants to
[1:05:46] steal it away from you today and he
[1:05:48] comes right into the house of God yeah
[1:05:51] come on you imagine they were Brazen
[1:05:53] they come in with crowbars
[1:05:56] come right into the house of God and
[1:05:58] started breaking stuff off
[1:06:00] well I need some extra money this week
[1:06:01] so they come in and grabbed a gold palm
[1:06:04] trees in Boston gold in the house of God
[1:06:07] there was all kinds of the walls were
[1:06:10] decorated in gold and all that and they
[1:06:12] come in and grab some for themselves
[1:06:14] precious stones covered the inside of
[1:06:17] that house you can't imagine the cost of
[1:06:19] it and the value of it don't you realize
[1:06:21] that's what Satan is trying to do today
[1:06:22] is he's trying to come into your home
[1:06:24] he's trying to come into the house of
[1:06:26] God and he's trying to steal anything of
[1:06:28] value he wants to steal your healing he
[1:06:31] wants to steal your salvation he wants
[1:06:33] to steal are you with me this morning
[1:06:35] he's trying to steal everything of value
[1:06:37] out of the house
[1:06:44] Acts 20 and 28 the same thing happened
[1:06:46] in the New Testament yeah
[1:06:50] Paul says stick heed
[1:06:53] unto yourselves into all the flock over
[1:06:55] the which the Holy Ghost has made you
[1:06:56] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:06:58] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:07:00] blood
[1:07:01] for I know this
[1:07:03] but after my departing so Grievous woes
[1:07:06] entering among you yes not sparing the
[1:07:10] yeah
[1:07:12] taking the gold in the jewels
[1:07:15] and the deity
[1:07:16] from the inside of the temple of God
[1:07:20] and again in second chronicles 3 6 it
[1:07:23] tells us there that he garnished the
[1:07:24] house with precious stones for Beauty
[1:07:27] and the gold was the gold pervarium it
[1:07:30] was the very best
[1:07:31] the very best goal the most precious
[1:07:34] stones
[1:07:35] the sons of Italian took out and no one
[1:07:38] noticed it
[1:07:40] you know when no one notices it when the
[1:07:42] church is not in Revival yes
[1:07:44] that's why we constantly strive for
[1:07:46] Revival he said brother being you're
[1:07:48] pushing you're pushing why are you keep
[1:07:49] pushing we want to be in Revival if
[1:07:51] we're not in Revival we need to be
[1:07:53] praying for Revival because we know that
[1:07:55] when the church is in I'm talking about
[1:07:57] Among Us I'm not talking about a
[1:07:58] worldwide thing I'm talking about just
[1:08:00] Among Us and and in our individual lives
[1:08:03] when we are not in Revival Satan can
[1:08:05] come in and it begins to go unnoticed
[1:08:07] that he steals the family prayer out of
[1:08:09] the home and you never noticed that it
[1:08:11] was gone he stole your personal
[1:08:12] devotions out you never noticed that it
[1:08:15] was gone he stole away your time to
[1:08:17] study the message he stole away your
[1:08:19] time to get along with God he stole away
[1:08:22] the time that you spent with your
[1:08:23] children are you with me this morning
[1:08:25] and you thought it was a good thing yeah
[1:08:27] he had a reason I'm sure he did I'm sure
[1:08:29] those Sons when they left they said oh
[1:08:30] we're taking this away because it don't
[1:08:32] really fit it didn't really look good
[1:08:34] there anyway we'll replace it with
[1:08:36] something else I'm sure it looked good
[1:08:37] when they took it away but you can't
[1:08:39] beat God's program yes sir
[1:08:43] good good I don't care who you are and
[1:08:47] how smart you are
[1:08:49] can't beat God's program some of you old
[1:08:51] people ought to say Amen to that this
[1:08:53] morning you know my past experience that
[1:08:55] when you follow the word you there was
[1:08:57] something in your life you could stand
[1:08:59] on yes you had trials yes you had
[1:09:01] trouble yes you had circumstances but
[1:09:03] when you stayed with the word there was
[1:09:05] a standing place there there was a rock
[1:09:08] a foundation but when you stray off
[1:09:11] you can see what happens in your life
[1:09:15] yeah now Solomon's Temple
[1:09:19] was designed in a similar way to the Ark
[1:09:21] of the Covenant and we're told in the
[1:09:23] scripture how that's done but I want to
[1:09:24] go to where brother random talks about
[1:09:26] it because he speaks of it so
[1:09:28] wonderfully
[1:09:29] he talks about how that they put the
[1:09:31] gold over the wood
[1:09:32] in the Ark of the Covenant when they
[1:09:34] built it he said now watch the Ark of
[1:09:35] the Covenant he said You shall make it
[1:09:37] out of acacia wood I don't know if I'm
[1:09:40] saying that correctly and overlay it
[1:09:42] with gold
[1:09:43] he said anyone who knows the scripture
[1:09:45] knows that gold speaks of deity yeah and
[1:09:48] wood speaks of humanity
[1:09:52] that's God's purpose by the way
[1:09:56] is Christ in you in you the hope of
[1:09:58] glory
[1:09:59] right the mystery that was hit from the
[1:10:01] beginning the second part of that
[1:10:02] threefold purpose of God Christ in you
[1:10:05] now watch he said he knows that gold
[1:10:08] speaks of deity in Wood speaks of
[1:10:10] humanity see he said You shall cover it
[1:10:12] overlay it with gold over the wood
[1:10:16] he said that's deity over the wood
[1:10:19] that's the way the temple was built
[1:10:21] deity over the wood Christ over the
[1:10:23] church
[1:10:24] inside and out
[1:10:27] I love it deity overlaid
[1:10:31] he said now you'll have a lid on top of
[1:10:33] it so on top of the Ark of the Covenant
[1:10:35] the Ark of the Covenant was basically a
[1:10:37] box and then on top of that there will
[1:10:39] be a lid he said you'll have a lid on
[1:10:41] top of it it'll be a mercy seat
[1:10:43] or a place of mercy and all the laws
[1:10:46] will rest in it he said but before you
[1:10:48] take it in sprinkle it over with blood
[1:10:50] he said the law speaks of judgment
[1:10:53] remember those tablets were there inside
[1:10:55] the Ark of the Covenant but between the
[1:10:57] law and the congregation
[1:11:00] oh this ought to make a shout this
[1:11:02] morning if we could if we could get
[1:11:04] happy about anything it ought to make us
[1:11:06] happy between the law and the
[1:11:09] congregation what's a curtain yeah
[1:11:11] for deity stood in this place yeah he
[1:11:14] said it was a type of Christ between the
[1:11:16] wrath of God the judgment and Hell
[1:11:18] between that and the believer stands
[1:11:21] dear to himself
[1:11:24] Glory Christ standing in the way
[1:11:28] what's he standing in the way of my own
[1:11:30] stupidity
[1:11:32] my own arrogance oh God my own
[1:11:35] stubbornness he's standing in between me
[1:11:38] and that law
[1:11:40] are you hearing me today that's why we
[1:11:42] need him every moment in our lives
[1:11:43] that's why we should worship him every
[1:11:46] moment in our life that's why we need
[1:11:47] him all the time in the church why
[1:11:49] because he stands between yeah
[1:11:54] yeah oh my
[1:11:56] God hallelujah
[1:11:57] standing in the way with an atonement
[1:11:59] made to save us from our sins and to
[1:12:01] heal us from our sickness
[1:12:04] the law was a judge the law judged
[1:12:09] I just love this but the atonement stood
[1:12:12] between the confessed believer and the
[1:12:15] judgment
[1:12:16] there laid the Judgment in the ark ready
[1:12:19] to come forth
[1:12:21] but when it did it couldn't
[1:12:27] when it did it couldn't
[1:12:29] for there was an atonement standing
[1:12:32] between it and the believer
[1:12:36] Hallelujah
[1:12:37] and the believer come and accepted
[1:12:40] Christ in his shadow in time shed blood
[1:12:42] sprinkled upon The Mercy Seat then he
[1:12:45] had mercy and could walk away rejoicing
[1:12:48] because he was free from judgment
[1:12:53] oh might he used Romans 8 1 there's
[1:12:55] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:12:57] which are in Christ Jesus who walked not
[1:12:59] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:13:00] don't let the devil condemn you for what
[1:13:02] you were you're not that person anymore
[1:13:04] don't let him condemn you for an old
[1:13:06] book The Old book's been done away with
[1:13:07] God don't even remember it against you
[1:13:09] anymore
[1:13:11] yes he said when a man knows that he has
[1:13:14] died to the things of the world and
[1:13:16] those who get in Christ Jesus and
[1:13:17] walking according to the Holy Spirit and
[1:13:20] not the ways of the sinful World there
[1:13:22] is no condemnation to him
[1:13:26] Hallelujah
[1:13:27] you're going to wake up and realize
[1:13:29] what that means someday
[1:13:35] you can look in the face of hell
[1:13:37] and of judgment
[1:13:39] and rejoice yeah
[1:13:42] it's good a hard sermon don't bother him
[1:13:47] he says Thank you lord for keeping me
[1:13:49] yeah
[1:13:50] thank you for making an atonement a
[1:13:52] bleeding word
[1:13:53] I've been lost by the water of the word
[1:13:55] it doesn't matter if I get skin down and
[1:13:57] strung out it doesn't matter whether the
[1:14:00] pastor comes or some evangelists come
[1:14:01] and preaches something that gets on me I
[1:14:03] know that that's the that's an atonement
[1:14:05] word that's keeping me Hallelujah
[1:14:08] it's keeping me a bleeding word keeping
[1:14:10] me from the things of the world
[1:14:12] a bleeding word there's no condemnation
[1:14:15] a bleeding word is keeping me from the
[1:14:17] things of the world
[1:14:19] amen he said he can look in the face of
[1:14:21] hell and judgment and rejoice because
[1:14:23] there's the blood of Christ making
[1:14:24] atonement standing between him and
[1:14:27] judgment
[1:14:28] the believer wants in
[1:14:32] it was a lid
[1:14:36] you realize without the it was done
[1:14:39] separately you'd think that he'd have
[1:14:40] built a box an ark with a lid but he
[1:14:44] built an ark with no lid but the lid was
[1:14:46] The Mercy Seat
[1:14:50] and it sat down on top of the Ark
[1:14:55] and as long as the lid was there that's
[1:14:57] why we believe his Mercy is still open
[1:15:00] because if Mercy was over if the blood
[1:15:02] is off the emergency seat then that
[1:15:04] judgment can come right out of the Ark
[1:15:07] and we've got to face up to it and no
[1:15:10] man can live the law not in these bodies
[1:15:14] are you hear me today you can't live the
[1:15:17] law in these bodies
[1:15:18] you're gonna mess up you're gonna make
[1:15:20] mistakes
[1:15:21] but God said I'm gonna be I'm going to
[1:15:22] stand between you and your mistakes I'm
[1:15:25] going to stand between you and the
[1:15:26] Judgment I'm going to stand between you
[1:15:28] and hell I'm going to stand between you
[1:15:30] and the Judgment look he said the lid
[1:15:33] was shut down
[1:15:35] the lid was The Mercy Seat the lid comes
[1:15:38] down on top of the Ark of the Covenant
[1:15:41] and that settles it
[1:15:44] Glory
[1:15:46] no one
[1:15:48] can take the lid off of a believer
[1:15:51] what is that it's the Holy Spirit yeah
[1:15:54] now watch what he says it was he said
[1:15:56] it's Amen gold deity laid over and
[1:15:59] underneath it and all around it around
[1:16:01] what The Mercy Seat
[1:16:04] right wrapped up in deity
[1:16:08] Glory
[1:16:09] he said in every man that's coming to
[1:16:11] Christ is wrapped up in the Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] yes
[1:16:16] up in the Holy Spirit there's a lid on
[1:16:18] the law yeah
[1:16:20] right and brother Brandon explained it
[1:16:22] this way he said he said if if I had
[1:16:24] permission from the mayor to drive as
[1:16:27] fast as I wanted to
[1:16:29] right maybe you have some kind of a job
[1:16:30] where you have permission that on an
[1:16:32] emergency call you can drive as fast as
[1:16:34] you want to he said how could I break
[1:16:35] the speed limit
[1:16:39] right you realize a Christian cannot sin
[1:16:46] preach a Christian cannot sin
[1:16:52] I don't think we understand that
[1:16:55] it's hard to believe isn't it
[1:16:57] yeah that's what the Bible says
[1:16:59] you have an atonement
[1:17:01] right you're free from sin
[1:17:04] if you say if you sin you have no part
[1:17:06] in Christ
[1:17:08] but you can't sin and the reason why you
[1:17:10] can't sin is because the Holy Spirit
[1:17:14] is overlaid over your life that don't
[1:17:16] mean you can't do the ACT
[1:17:23] what makes it not sin is not that you
[1:17:26] didn't tell that person something that
[1:17:27] wasn't true
[1:17:29] and I'm not excusing that today because
[1:17:31] if deity is in its proper place and on
[1:17:34] the lid in your life you're not going to
[1:17:35] do those things
[1:17:37] you understand that that you're not
[1:17:39] going to want to do those things right
[1:17:41] but the fact that you don't sin is not
[1:17:44] due to the fact that you never did it
[1:17:46] yeah
[1:17:48] but the fact that you don't sin is due
[1:17:50] to the fact that he don't see it
[1:17:53] yes right
[1:17:55] the law cannot come up out of the Ark of
[1:17:58] the Covenant and judge you because deity
[1:18:02] hahaha
[1:18:04] oh God you realize how important the
[1:18:06] holy spirit is
[1:18:08] right so well I'll just I'll just
[1:18:09] believe and be baptized come to church
[1:18:11] that's good but you need the baptism of
[1:18:13] the Holy Ghost you need the baptism of
[1:18:15] the Holy Ghost because what stands
[1:18:17] between you in judgment is not your
[1:18:19] baptism
[1:18:20] not your water baptism but it's the
[1:18:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's deity
[1:18:24] rapping wrapping you in deity
[1:18:27] oh God wrapped in deity every man that's
[1:18:30] coming to Christ is wrapped up in the
[1:18:31] Holy Spirit and become Sons and
[1:18:33] Daughters of God he said over in this
[1:18:35] beat out gold he said they got it hot
[1:18:37] and beat it and the beater of the gold
[1:18:40] beat the gold you had to beat it with a
[1:18:42] hammer and they beat the gold oh I love
[1:18:44] this until you see his reflection in it
[1:18:47] all you say I've been going through a
[1:18:49] lot brother Ben ever since I've become a
[1:18:50] Christian I've been going through it
[1:18:52] just hang in there he's beating out the
[1:18:54] gold he's beating out the gold he's
[1:18:56] getting it ready so he can see his image
[1:18:58] in it
[1:18:59] and he beat out the gold and then what
[1:19:01] do they do they get it hot yeah yeah you
[1:19:04] can't pour deity cold yeah
[1:19:10] oh
[1:19:11] thank you
[1:19:13] oh yeah can you see what I'm saying
[1:19:15] today you can't do it
[1:19:18] that's why people say well we'll just
[1:19:19] take the word we'll just take the word
[1:19:20] you choose the word you can't pull pour
[1:19:24] the word out yeah cold
[1:19:27] it's not in a form to be poured out
[1:19:30] you can't overlay it to get gold in a
[1:19:34] condition where we'll overlay the inside
[1:19:36] of the temple the inside of the holy of
[1:19:38] holies the outside of The Mercy Seat
[1:19:40] when you get to that position where it
[1:19:43] will do that how can you do it you've
[1:19:45] got to get it so hot
[1:19:47] you melt it
[1:19:49] yes sir oh God
[1:19:52] he said he had to beat it with a hammer
[1:19:55] and then get her hot and pour her out
[1:19:58] over the ark and it soaked into the wood
[1:20:02] see the problem with some people is that
[1:20:04] deity is laying there but it's never
[1:20:07] been heated up
[1:20:10] and poured over the wood
[1:20:14] oh my the Holy Spirit wants to pour it
[1:20:17] over the wood until it soaks in
[1:20:20] oh God help us today that's why we want
[1:20:22] the atmosphere to be right that's why we
[1:20:24] strive to have God guilty in our
[1:20:27] services have the Holy Spirit we want it
[1:20:29] to be so hot so fervent
[1:20:33] that you pour down
[1:20:37] oh God
[1:20:38] I don't want deity just next to me you
[1:20:40] realize I had the word I have God this
[1:20:42] is God in repent for him
[1:20:44] it can be right here yeah
[1:20:46] my this got the Bible on it's got 100
[1:20:49] different translations probably it's got
[1:20:51] thousands and thousands of commentaries
[1:20:54] all over the internet that I could find
[1:20:56] and pull in it's got all the messages
[1:20:58] yeah audio and print all of it just on
[1:21:01] this one little tablet but it's just
[1:21:03] there by me yeah
[1:21:05] but if I can ever get the heat of the
[1:21:08] Holy Spirit to come on it
[1:21:11] right well my if I can ever Jesus said
[1:21:13] it's expedient for you that I go away he
[1:21:15] said because the Holy Ghost needs to
[1:21:17] come and lead you and guide you into all
[1:21:18] truth if I can ever get it hot enough
[1:21:20] where it'll pour out on me and soak in
[1:21:24] oh my God
[1:21:26] when the Holy Spirit being the power I'm
[1:21:28] not just saying this what he said when
[1:21:31] the Holy Spirit being the power Holy
[1:21:32] Ghost and Fire poured out upon the
[1:21:35] believer through the blood of Christ
[1:21:36] makes an atonement there for him he is
[1:21:40] safe
[1:21:41] from all Divine judgments yes
[1:21:44] oh Hallelujah aren't you glad to be
[1:21:46] living that way
[1:21:47] I don't have to worry say well brother
[1:21:48] Ben I can't come to church right now
[1:21:50] I've been sinning are you born again do
[1:21:52] you have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:54] repent of that thing
[1:21:56] and you need to discover if your life is
[1:21:58] just habitually that way maybe you need
[1:22:00] the Holy Ghost maybe you thought you got
[1:22:02] an emotion or a sensation you didn't get
[1:22:04] the deed he poured out because when the
[1:22:06] deity is poured out it soaks into the
[1:22:08] wood yeah
[1:22:10] this is what a thalia's son stole
[1:22:14] from the temple yeah
[1:22:16] yeah deity over Humanity this is what
[1:22:19] the Catholic Church began to steal away
[1:22:22] this is what that white horse rider the
[1:22:24] first seal began to steal away from the
[1:22:27] church
[1:22:28] they begin to steal the deity
[1:22:31] oh God help us today
[1:22:33] I don't want to be standing by the door
[1:22:35] when Italian's Sons come by and say oh
[1:22:37] God bless you bless your heart you're
[1:22:40] such a good person I see you carrying
[1:22:42] off that big old hunk of gold I see you
[1:22:44] taking that big old palm tree I see you
[1:22:46] carrying off that vessel that's supposed
[1:22:47] to be in the house of God you're going
[1:22:48] to go out and use it for Balaam bless
[1:22:50] God you're such a good person wouldn't
[1:22:51] want to say anything to hurt you
[1:22:54] here they go out the door
[1:22:56] how many priests stood there at the door
[1:22:58] and watched
[1:23:01] but a thalia's Sons were too big
[1:23:03] to fail
[1:23:07] yeah
[1:23:07] hear me church we don't get that big
[1:23:10] your pastor don't get that big
[1:23:13] other people around it we don't get that
[1:23:15] big I don't care if they're a pastor a
[1:23:16] deacon or trustee or whatever if you see
[1:23:18] things missing from the house of God
[1:23:19] it's the congregation not just the
[1:23:22] preachers but the congregation has a has
[1:23:24] a right not only a right but a
[1:23:26] responsibility to speak up and say where
[1:23:28] are the things missing from the house of
[1:23:30] God where is the deity that covered the
[1:23:33] humanity where is that praise where is
[1:23:35] that love where is that thing that made
[1:23:37] us love our neighbors where is that
[1:23:39] spirit of God that would come down in
[1:23:41] such a powerful way that people would be
[1:23:43] drunk on the spirit of God where's it at
[1:23:45] yes you have a right it's a congregation
[1:23:48] to say where are those things
[1:23:51] come on back
[1:23:54] oh could you say that with me today
[1:23:57] don't you realize that thou your sons
[1:23:58] are in the land today they're trying to
[1:24:00] steal away the deity off of your life
[1:24:03] trying to steal the Holy Ghost right off
[1:24:05] of you and you don't realize that you
[1:24:07] don't recognize it
[1:24:09] oh God
[1:24:10] if you could ever get in the word yeah
[1:24:13] walk into the temple and begin to look
[1:24:16] around there's some things missing here

[1:24:45] around see is there things missing yeah
[1:24:49] he said but I had a reason it doesn't
[1:24:51] matter why the devil don't care how he
[1:24:53] keeps you out of church he don't care
[1:24:55] how he steals the joy out of your life
[1:24:57] he don't care how he does if he does it
[1:24:59] by a preacher or by the internet or by
[1:25:01] TV or by pornography or by lust or by
[1:25:04] field he don't care how he does it he
[1:25:06] just wants to do it he just wants to
[1:25:09] take it out of the house of God so we're
[1:25:12] standing today in the house of God and
[1:25:14] my job as a pastor
[1:25:16] to get you to look around
[1:25:27] you hear me today
[1:25:30] what's missing you can look around and
[1:25:33] say it's all there praise God
[1:25:35] and I believe that the message of the
[1:25:36] hour restored it all but what's missing
[1:25:38] from our individual application of the
[1:25:40] word yeah
[1:25:42] what did God say would be and what are
[1:25:45] we yeah
[1:25:48] God help us today I don't mean no that
[1:25:49] don't mean you're not a Christian
[1:25:51] but I'm trying to de-christianize you
[1:25:53] today but take a look around the house
[1:25:55] yeah
[1:25:56] yeah take a look around your family
[1:25:58] What's missing
[1:26:00] you see your kids start straight away
[1:26:02] and all they're interested in is is the
[1:26:04] things of the world and maybe that
[1:26:06] starts Young by the way I've seen it
[1:26:08] over and over again they get so
[1:26:09] interested in sports and the things of
[1:26:11] the world and they get to a place they
[1:26:12] have no interest you can't drag them to
[1:26:14] a meeting you can't make them go
[1:26:16] and you don't yeah
[1:26:19] until they get colder and they get
[1:26:21] colder and they get colder and they
[1:26:22] finally get to where they're sitting on
[1:26:24] the front but they sit on the back and
[1:26:25] they finally leave the house of God
[1:26:27] entirely and you won't begin to wonder
[1:26:28] what happened see all of the valuable
[1:26:31] things you realize how valuable our
[1:26:32] children are
[1:26:38] Sons realized that they couldn't
[1:26:40] separate the deity from the gold
[1:26:42] because they've been poured in what did
[1:26:44] they do they took the whole post
[1:26:47] took the whole piece of wood took it out
[1:26:49] of the house of God yeah
[1:26:52] Satan's gonna fight our children yeah
[1:26:55] he's gonna fight us yeah
[1:26:57] yeah and the biggest influence over your
[1:26:59] children's life is Mom and Dad yeah
[1:27:03] the biggest influence over your
[1:27:05] children's life is Mom and Dad
[1:27:07] I think family members are close second
[1:27:12] the church is in there somewhere yeah
[1:27:15] depending on how much you're in church
[1:27:18] but it's a big influence
[1:27:19] but only in proportion to how much time
[1:27:22] you realize how much time you spend at
[1:27:23] home with your kids yeah
[1:27:25] some of us
[1:27:28] I should have said some of y'all because
[1:27:29] I've not I've worked and preached and
[1:27:31] taken Saturdays away from my family I've
[1:27:33] done that I've been there done that I
[1:27:34] know what that's like
[1:27:37] I know what that's like
[1:27:38] you got to watch them
[1:27:40] you got to watch the house
[1:27:42] when you see them begin to drift out the
[1:27:44] door
[1:27:44] you better grab a hold of them
[1:27:48] you better grab a hold of that Joy
[1:27:50] it may be serving down there in another
[1:27:52] Temple before long it may be down there
[1:27:54] in the bar room
[1:27:55] it may be down there and say in the jail
[1:27:57] it may be down there somewhere else
[1:27:59] you better grab hold of that gold
[1:28:02] and as I said there'll be some that's
[1:28:04] strange but it knows I belong in the
[1:28:06] house of God
[1:28:08] oh my because the pattern of the temple
[1:28:11] was right what God Said for it to me so
[1:28:13] you may stray your children may stray
[1:28:15] but you know there's I belong I wasn't
[1:28:18] created can you imagine I'm getting way
[1:28:20] off my notes today but can you imagine a
[1:28:22] post that belonged in the temple of God
[1:28:24] and it was overlaid with gold and they
[1:28:26] took it down and put it in the temple of
[1:28:28] Baal and it was sitting there all by its
[1:28:30] Lonesome self it wasn't created to be in
[1:28:32] the temple of Baal it wasn't created to
[1:28:35] be on drugs and alcohol it wasn't
[1:28:36] created for that and so it was miserable
[1:28:39] if a post can be miserable this Humanity
[1:28:42] overlaid with gold was miserable out of
[1:28:45] the house of God some of you know what
[1:28:46] I'm talking about this morning miserable
[1:28:49] out of the house of God but if you could
[1:28:50] ever get it back in the house it began
[1:28:53] to rejoice and begin to serve God for
[1:28:56] the same purpose that it was created for
[1:28:58] in the beginning God you might be
[1:29:00] miserable this morning come back in the
[1:29:02] house of God
[1:29:04] amen come back among the people of god
[1:29:07] good good serve the purpose you were
[1:29:09] created for
[1:29:11] I know the devil puts that old suicide
[1:29:12] Spirit on people
[1:29:16] that don't happen around it does yeah
[1:29:19] say I'm not good for nothing
[1:29:21] especially around church kids that have
[1:29:22] left
[1:29:24] yeah
[1:29:25] because they were born in the house of
[1:29:26] God yeah
[1:29:29] yeah they know what it's like
[1:29:30] yeah they may not have forever got it on
[1:29:33] the inside but they've at least felt it
[1:29:34] yeah
[1:29:36] and so they're standing there
[1:29:39] out of place
[1:29:40] and that old devil gets to talk to him
[1:29:42] he wants to take them completely out oh
[1:29:44] yeah oh yeah wants to get him to commit
[1:29:46] suicide yeah
[1:29:47] but if you're hearing me this morning

[1:29:52] me this morning

[1:29:57] if I can pull you this morning if I can
[1:29:59] take my arms without your sons you
[1:30:02] realize the devil used men to take out
[1:30:04] the things from the house of God what
[1:30:06] did God use to put them back in come on
[1:30:09] he used men
[1:30:11] the devil wants to use you to take your
[1:30:14] kids out the devil wants to use you put
[1:30:16] that on suicide Spirit on somebody but
[1:30:18] God wants to use you to wrap your arms
[1:30:21] around them and bring them back in the
[1:30:22] house of God he wants to use you for
[1:30:24] that reason I tell you what I don't want
[1:30:26] to lose one of them I don't want to see
[1:30:28] one of them I don't know about you I
[1:30:29] don't care how much they annoy me I
[1:30:31] don't care what kind of a spirit how
[1:30:33] many times they bother me I don't want
[1:30:34] to lose one
[1:30:36] care if it's a half wit or a no-wit or
[1:30:39] an intelligent person I don't care if
[1:30:41] it's a poor person or a rich person if
[1:30:43] it belongs in the house of God let's
[1:30:45] keep it in the house of God
[1:30:46] it
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:54] you can quit let me go to meetings
[1:31:00] I have not taken anything was preached
[1:31:02] in the meeting but we sometimes it does
[1:31:04] US good
[1:31:05] take our notes and put them aside and
[1:31:07] just lay in the word and presence for a
[1:31:09] little while yeah
[1:31:12] it's good deity over Humanity
[1:31:15] the devil wants to steal that deity
[1:31:17] take it away
[1:31:20] but random said when the debt when the
[1:31:22] church left off Divine leadership of the
[1:31:23] Holy Ghost and adopted a bishop to take
[1:31:25] his place it was a sad day
[1:31:28] the holy spirit is to be the leader of
[1:31:30] the church
[1:31:31] he is sent to confirm the words of Jesus
[1:31:34] Christ to make the church live
[1:31:37] as it did
[1:31:39] live
[1:31:40] at the beginning
[1:31:42] see the devil wants to steal the
[1:31:44] leadership of the Holy Ghost because
[1:31:46] that's how the family is supposed to be
[1:31:48] led
[1:31:49] the church is led by the pastor under
[1:31:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:53] if the pastor is not full of the Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost the church is not being led by the
[1:31:57] Holy Ghost
[1:31:59] you realize that the church is under the
[1:32:01] leadership is left that's why it's so
[1:32:03] important to have Holy Ghost filled Men
[1:32:04] First
[1:32:06] and then see if they can preach if they
[1:32:07] can sing if they can
[1:32:09] right right
[1:32:10] Holy Ghost filled men because that's how
[1:32:13] God leads the churches by the Holy Ghost
[1:32:16] the holy spirit is the leader of the
[1:32:18] church or the pastor the holy spirit is
[1:32:20] the leader of the family through the
[1:32:21] father
[1:32:22] if the father's not there through the
[1:32:24] mother
[1:32:25] you understand the Holy Ghost is the
[1:32:28] leader of the church
[1:32:30] and Satan wants to strip that away from
[1:32:32] you
[1:32:34] oh God so make you cold
[1:32:38] indifferent
[1:32:40] backslidden
[1:32:42] now he's not just working on you now he
[1:32:44] knows he can't completely destroy you
[1:32:46] because that gold soaked in yeah
[1:32:49] yeah right it got hot and it soaked in
[1:32:51] but he wants to keep these others from
[1:32:53] having that same experience
[1:32:56] so what does he do he makes you cold he
[1:33:00] makes you formal he makes you leaderless
[1:33:02] yeah
[1:33:04] makes you drift from place to place
[1:33:08] no no anything about where what position
[1:33:11] you belong in and the and I'm not
[1:33:13] talking just about your position in
[1:33:14] church but in the body of Christ sitting
[1:33:16] in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:33:18] he makes you not understand where you're
[1:33:20] at
[1:33:20] he wants to strip the deity off the wood
[1:33:22] but the man said that's the reason that
[1:33:24] all this here's snarling and fussing and
[1:33:26] backbiting and biting back and carrying
[1:33:28] on around the church he said that's what
[1:33:30] breaks up the church
[1:33:32] oh God that shows that the devil got
[1:33:35] into you and that shows the Holy Ghost
[1:33:38] left you yeah
[1:33:39] yeah he said now there's only one thing
[1:33:41] to do get that thing out of there and
[1:33:43] the dove will come back to your heart
[1:33:44] when the dove went out of the Ark she
[1:33:46] was turned out but she come back and
[1:33:48] knocked at that art door until Noah let
[1:33:51] her in yes he said the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:53] here the Holy Ghost wants to come in do
[1:33:55] you believe that this morning he said
[1:33:56] that's the reason today the Holy Spirit
[1:33:58] he hasn't gone from you forever listen
[1:34:00] to me church he has not gone from you
[1:34:02] forever I know you've gotten cold I know
[1:34:04] some of us get go I get cold too
[1:34:06] sometimes I get formal too but I find
[1:34:09] when I get back down on my knees and get
[1:34:11] where I need to be in God he's always
[1:34:13] there to meet me he's knocking on my
[1:34:15] door all the time
[1:34:17] yeah hey man she was turned out she'd
[1:34:19] come back and knock to that art door
[1:34:21] until Noah let her in the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:23] here the Holy Ghost wants to come in
[1:34:24] that's the reason today is the holy
[1:34:25] spirit he hasn't gone from you forever
[1:34:27] it's just sitting out there on the limbs
[1:34:28] of the trees somewhere ready to fly
[1:34:30] itself back to coming to you and give
[1:34:32] you love and peace and joy like you used
[1:34:34] to have sure it is he's ready to do it
[1:34:37] he wants to do it he's longing to do it
[1:34:40] but here's the key you won't let him do
[1:34:42] it
[1:34:45] now why don't you let him do it he said
[1:34:46] as long as that lamb nature leaves you
[1:34:48] then the Holy Ghost is gone and brother
[1:34:50] random deals with they say but brother
[1:34:52] Brandon you
[1:34:53] I got the Holy Ghost I know I felt him I
[1:34:56] was there
[1:34:57] he said it was the Holy Ghost and he
[1:34:59] hasn't left you completely right but
[1:35:01] he's flown off into the attic yeah
[1:35:03] flown up into the cable into the house
[1:35:06] of your soul the influence is gone
[1:35:09] the value if he can't completely destroy
[1:35:12] you thou your sons those demons
[1:35:16] huh that come in the world today those
[1:35:19] demons that were You released from the
[1:35:20] Euphrates River
[1:35:21] demons the demon children of that
[1:35:25] Jezebel spirit want to come in and
[1:35:28] affect and take away all the effects of
[1:35:31] the Holy Spirit off of your life
[1:35:34] he said that's the reason people is in
[1:35:36] the condition they are he says because
[1:35:38] they let the wrong Spirit come into
[1:35:40] their heart into their life he said the
[1:35:42] Bible said that's the reason there's so
[1:35:43] many sick and Afflicted Among Us it's
[1:35:45] because of such things we must be gentle
[1:35:46] we must be peaceful we must be a lamb so
[1:35:49] that the dove can abide with us he said
[1:35:51] but you see the reason he couldn't abide
[1:35:53] he said he was a lamb then but when you
[1:35:54] become a wolf he had to take his flight
[1:35:56] he said nothing wrong with the dove it's
[1:35:58] you let that Spirit come to you I told
[1:36:00] you I was going to preach this morning
[1:36:01] so we're just going to plow deep and
[1:36:03] then I'll quit he said did I let it
[1:36:05] brother Branham yes he said when you
[1:36:06] went to listen to that gossip oh God
[1:36:08] help us today when you listen to that
[1:36:10] lie when you went to saying well I've
[1:36:12] got a right too
[1:36:15] I don't care if you're a preacher or a
[1:36:16] teacher or if you're or if you're a
[1:36:18] musician or if you're just a church
[1:36:20] member whatever it is that you are if
[1:36:22] you're a prayer Warrior God the Satan
[1:36:24] wants you just as bad maybe worse than
[1:36:26] anybody else
[1:36:27] and he'll try to pull you out of the
[1:36:29] house and how is he going to do that
[1:36:30] gossiping backbiting fussing fighting
[1:36:37] I don't want to get too personal but
[1:36:38] I've been amazed lately because you know
[1:36:40] I've been going going to a lot of means
[1:36:42] that I haven't been preaching because
[1:36:44] but I preached myself under conviction
[1:36:46] I said I can't preach that you love one
[1:36:48] another and go to all the meetings go do
[1:36:49] all this stuff unless I do it right
[1:36:52] so I've been going and as I've been
[1:36:54] going I've won common theme and
[1:36:57] sometimes I won't hear from somebody
[1:36:57] I'll go somewhere I'll hear from
[1:36:58] somebody for weeks somebody will text me
[1:37:00] somebody will call me brother Ben it
[1:37:02] still amazes us that you would come and
[1:37:04] I'm sitting there thinking
[1:37:06] have we gone so far yeah
[1:37:08] have we gotten so cold
[1:37:13] yeah
[1:37:15] that doing the things we're supposed to
[1:37:17] do surprises people yeah
[1:37:21] oh
[1:37:22] where are we at church
[1:37:24] I'm not preaching to everybody out there
[1:37:26] I'm preaching to us yeah and I want to
[1:37:29] say I appreciate your love that you show
[1:37:31] to visitors when they come here and the
[1:37:33] fact that you win many of you went on
[1:37:34] Wednesday I appreciate that some of you
[1:37:35] I know couldn't go I understand that I I
[1:37:37] realized how hard that is how difficult
[1:37:39] that is but when we have the opportunity
[1:37:41] to love somebody I don't care if it's
[1:37:43] not a church member you say well you
[1:37:45] love message people yes but what about
[1:37:46] people on the street people after your
[1:37:48] job people down at the at the grocery
[1:37:50] store people people when your car breaks
[1:37:52] down and then you have to get it fixed
[1:37:54] that's always a trying time but you got
[1:37:56] to love those people too and if you'll
[1:37:58] just display normal Christian love if
[1:38:01] you'll just say just play normal
[1:38:03] brotherly kindness you'll be surprised
[1:38:05] how it overwhelms people because people
[1:38:07] don't see that do they but they gave
[1:38:08] they don't see that at school they don't
[1:38:10] see that at the grocery store but Robert
[1:38:12] they don't see it everywhere yeah all
[1:38:15] right and if you just display it in a in
[1:38:17] a normal Christian way
[1:38:22] they don't see it in every message
[1:38:23] church right
[1:38:26] I'm not trying to make us different
[1:38:27] because listen we could we could be in
[1:38:29] the same place
[1:38:31] we need to pull back to the fire yes
[1:38:33] yes let's be hard yeah the turtle
[1:38:35] that'll be hot yes our love be hot if
[1:38:37] our love is hot for God it'll be hot for
[1:38:38] one another I know that sounds bad but
[1:38:41] just
[1:38:43] be quiet
[1:38:45] let me go on now let me continue
[1:38:49] it ought to be hot I'm gonna double down
[1:38:52] here
[1:38:53] that's a bad idea isn't it our love
[1:38:56] ought to be hot for one another
[1:38:58] ought to be warmth in our hearts
[1:39:01] for the lowest member of the body he
[1:39:03] said brother Ben you fail in that I'm
[1:39:05] there's gold here but it's wood inside
[1:39:09] that's true there's gold on the inside
[1:39:10] but there's wood between the gold yeah
[1:39:13] yeah there's gold on the outside the
[1:39:14] atonement covering me there's gold on
[1:39:15] the inside the Holy Spirit but in
[1:39:17] between that is humanity
[1:39:19] and when I fail it's because of the wood
[1:39:21] but when I when I reach out when I when
[1:39:24] I when I when I pull to the people of
[1:39:26] God when I when I cry out in love and
[1:39:28] peace and long suffering when I'm
[1:39:30] preaching the word of God what is it
[1:39:31] it's the gold displaying itself
[1:39:35] we want to get where we're not noticed
[1:39:37] what do you think was noticed in the
[1:39:39] temple it wasn't the wood yeah
[1:39:43] looking around some people say well it's
[1:39:45] wonderful all these Cedars of Lebanon
[1:39:46] wonderful it's all overlaid with gold
[1:39:53] oh God
[1:39:57] we don't want to be seen
[1:39:59] well Christ to be seen
[1:40:02] now I want to
[1:40:04] I want to move on well we'll read the
[1:40:06] rest of this you just give me a few more
[1:40:08] minutes
[1:40:10] I got a few more minutes
[1:40:15] did I let it say when you went to
[1:40:17] listening to that he said well I've got
[1:40:18] to write you haven't got no right you're
[1:40:19] bought with a price yeah that was the
[1:40:22] price of the Precious Blood of the Son
[1:40:23] of God you have gold on you
[1:40:26] you have no legal rights
[1:40:28] the only rights you have is come to the
[1:40:30] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[1:40:32] Emmanuel's vein when Sinners plunged
[1:40:33] beneath the blood the flood lose all
[1:40:35] their guilty staying I preached a sermon
[1:40:37] I preached part of it here I preached it
[1:40:38] somewhere else the lamb has rights
[1:40:41] we want to defend the rights of the Lamb
[1:40:44] you talk about our own rights we want to
[1:40:45] defend the rights of the Lamb yes
[1:40:49] how do we repair the house
[1:40:51] we want to know that this morning in the
[1:40:52] last few minutes
[1:40:54] but then I look around
[1:40:56] I see breaches in the house of God
[1:40:59] I see hardness
[1:41:01] I see trouble I look around here
[1:41:04] I see things that shouldn't be there or
[1:41:06] things that should be there that aren't
[1:41:08] and I wonder
[1:41:10] did I replace that golden altar
[1:41:13] with some kind of man's creation
[1:41:15] of a feel-good kind of thing did I
[1:41:18] replace that innocence with something
[1:41:19] God didn't want there
[1:41:21] how do we repair the house of God
[1:41:25] where the Holy Spirit would feel welcome
[1:41:27] once again how do we repair our families
[1:41:30] second chronicles 24 4 it came to pass
[1:41:32] after this first thing Joyce said joash
[1:41:35] was minded yeah you have to want to
[1:41:40] Apprentice would stir up a desire in our
[1:41:42] hearts Lord I want to have that gold
[1:41:44] where it ought to be
[1:41:45] I want to have those vessels where
[1:41:47] they're supposed to be good Joy I looked
[1:41:50] around the house with the Lord and God
[1:41:52] put something on his heart said I want
[1:41:54] to see it right
[1:41:55] yes I want to see the people loving each
[1:41:59] other I want to see I'm not just looking
[1:42:01] at this church but looking at the
[1:42:02] message of the hour look at my among us
[1:42:04] we fight and we fuss and we back by I
[1:42:06] want to see it right yeah
[1:42:08] yeah and I realize we'll always be human
[1:42:10] we will not we will not gain a Utopia on
[1:42:13] this Earth we can't do it yes
[1:42:15] but we can reach out in love we can when
[1:42:18] we're reviled we don't have to revile
[1:42:20] again
[1:42:22] joash was minded to repair the house of
[1:42:24] the Lord what's the second thing he did
[1:42:26] he held leadership accountable yeah in
[1:42:28] second chronicles 24 and 5 he gathered
[1:42:30] together the priests and the Levites and
[1:42:31] said to them go out unto the cities of
[1:42:33] Judah and gather all of all Israel money
[1:42:35] to repair the house of your God from
[1:42:37] year to year see that you hasten the
[1:42:39] matter do it quickly
[1:42:42] he said do it quickly and but you know
[1:42:44] these are the same priests that haven't
[1:42:45] been watching while they literally
[1:42:47] bankrupted the house of God
[1:42:50] so they didn't notice yeah
[1:42:53] oh God
[1:42:55] oh God help us we get so used to the
[1:42:57] world the way it is yeah
[1:42:59] when we could have life so much better
[1:43:01] yeah
[1:43:04] your marriage could be so much better
[1:43:06] my marriage our our home all of us it
[1:43:09] can be so much better if we just stay
[1:43:11] with the word
[1:43:14] but they wasted and in Kings it tells us
[1:43:16] they wasted 23 years yeah
[1:43:21] yeah and finally King joash said it this
[1:43:23] is enough
[1:43:24] I'm gonna hold them accountable
[1:43:29] and the king called for Jedediah the
[1:43:31] chief and said to him last thou not
[1:43:32] required of the Levites
[1:43:34] because he was the the one in charge
[1:43:36] like the pastor there the high priest
[1:43:38] he said why is thou not required of the
[1:43:40] Levites to bring in out of Judah and out
[1:43:42] of Jerusalem The Collection according to
[1:43:44] the Commandment of Moses the servant of
[1:43:45] the Lord another congregation of Israel
[1:43:47] for the Tabernacle of witness well the
[1:43:49] truth was they were going out and living
[1:43:51] off of all of it instead of living off
[1:43:54] the tithing
[1:43:57] they were going out and again I'm not
[1:43:59] talking about money this morning but
[1:44:00] it's emblematic of how we treat the
[1:44:02] things of God yes
[1:44:04] see there's were put they were given
[1:44:06] these things in trust we're not giving
[1:44:07] joy and peace and and all these things
[1:44:09] just so we can use them ourselves yeah
[1:44:12] yeah but so that we can be what God
[1:44:14] wants us to be for somebody else
[1:44:16] the temple was there for service so God
[1:44:19] could dwell in it now watch he they they
[1:44:22] they they said why have you not done
[1:44:24] this
[1:44:25] and he said why have now not required to
[1:44:27] Levites to bring out of Judah and out of
[1:44:29] Jerusalem The Collection now watch
[1:44:30] according to the Commandment of Moses
[1:44:32] the servant of the Lord and of the
[1:44:35] congregation of Israel for the
[1:44:36] Tabernacle of witness so joash goes all
[1:44:38] the way back to the law and he said
[1:44:40] there's a law that said this is how it
[1:44:42] was supposed to be done why are you not
[1:44:43] doing it and I would hold us accountable
[1:44:47] today I say us as Ministry why would
[1:44:49] there be no gifts in the church why
[1:44:51] would there be no no praise in the
[1:44:53] church why would there be no Holy Spirit
[1:44:54] in the Church of God why would there be
[1:44:57] no no power in the Church of God why
[1:44:59] would there be no preachers in some
[1:45:01] Churches why would there be are you with
[1:45:03] me now
[1:45:04] why would they not be there they belong
[1:45:06] in the house of God how do you know
[1:45:08] brother being God put them there
[1:45:12] foreign
[1:45:18] ERS he never sent Bishops Cardinals
[1:45:20] priests popes he sent the Holy Ghost for
[1:45:23] the church to lead the church when he
[1:45:24] the Holy Ghost has come he will lead you
[1:45:26] into altruists reveal these things to
[1:45:27] you that I have told you bring them to
[1:45:29] your remembrance we'll show you things
[1:45:30] to come that's what we've come from he
[1:45:32] said the Holy Spirit wants to do that
[1:45:33] that's what that early church was we
[1:45:36] have a responsibility to hold the
[1:45:38] leadership accountable bring us back to
[1:45:40] that
[1:45:41] yeah amen
[1:45:42] it's good preaching buddy honestly it
[1:45:46] should be you pushing me for Revival
[1:45:47] yeah
[1:45:49] yeah but Ben when can we have church
[1:45:55] you hear me
[1:45:59] number two you have to get back to God's
[1:46:00] way of doing things
[1:46:02] God had a way
[1:46:04] second chronicles 24 and 8 at the king's
[1:46:06] commandment they made a chest and said
[1:46:08] it without at the Gate of the house of
[1:46:09] the Lord they made a proclamation
[1:46:11] through Judah and Jerusalem to bring
[1:46:12] into the Lord The Collection that Moses
[1:46:14] the servant of God laid upon Israel in
[1:46:16] the wilderness let's get back to running
[1:46:18] the church like we were taught yeah
[1:46:19] brother Branham said the church is to be
[1:46:21] operated by nine spiritual gifts by the
[1:46:23] Holy Spirit he has gifts signs and
[1:46:25] wonders in the church that's God's
[1:46:26] provided way of perfecting his church
[1:46:28] now we're not talking about sinless
[1:46:30] perfection he explained that that's by
[1:46:31] the blood of Jesus Christ we're talking
[1:46:33] about maturity let's ask God's Divine
[1:46:35] Way of perfecting his church we try
[1:46:36] anything else we try anything else
[1:46:38] theology teaching yeah
[1:46:41] yeah anything else it'll never work
[1:46:44] it never did and it never will that's
[1:46:46] right he said we've got to come back to
[1:46:49] God's way now again teaching has a place
[1:46:50] but not without the spirit of God right
[1:46:53] we've got to come back to God's way God
[1:46:55] has a way to support a church not making
[1:46:56] blankets having soup suppers but every
[1:46:59] man paying his tithes and offerings into
[1:47:00] the church doing the way God said do
[1:47:02] that's God's provided way for that he
[1:47:04] said God's got to provide a way for a
[1:47:06] man to come into the church today we
[1:47:08] bring a men into the church to give him
[1:47:09] a letter bring him into the church the
[1:47:11] right hand of Fellowship sprinkle a
[1:47:12] little salt shaker full of water on top
[1:47:14] of his head bring him into the church
[1:47:15] that's not what God Said God's got a
[1:47:18] different way from that to bring the
[1:47:19] people into his church by one Spirit
[1:47:21] we're baptized into one body by the Holy
[1:47:23] Spirit how many believe that this
[1:47:24] morning
[1:47:25] hey man I'm almost done
[1:47:28] did God's provide a way bringing men
[1:47:29] Christians into the Church Believers
[1:47:31] Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:33] repent every one of you be baptized in
[1:47:34] the name of Jesus Christ for their
[1:47:35] mission of your sins you shall receive
[1:47:37] the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise
[1:47:38] unto you and your children to them
[1:47:39] that's so far off even as many as the
[1:47:41] Lord Our God shall call he said that
[1:47:43] must continue on as long as the Lord was
[1:47:45] calling God still promised the Holy
[1:47:47] Ghost
[1:47:48] that's God's provided way of coming into
[1:47:50] the church yeah
[1:47:53] now he used we use money as an example
[1:47:55] of that because
[1:47:57] a church this size couldn't do what we
[1:48:00] do operating under denominational
[1:48:01] headship
[1:48:03] it'd have to be partially supported and
[1:48:05] funded by a headquarter somewhere right
[1:48:07] but the reason why church this size a
[1:48:09] number can operate the way that we do is
[1:48:11] because the people of God
[1:48:14] have a heart to do what God Said and
[1:48:16] bring bringing the tithes into the
[1:48:18] storehouse bring the offering the
[1:48:19] storehouse I'm commending you for that
[1:48:20] by the way I'm commending you for that
[1:48:23] that's why it can operate the way it's
[1:48:24] supposed to
[1:48:25] thank God for that but there's other
[1:48:28] things that God put in the church that
[1:48:29] are the same way if we're doing the way
[1:48:31] God said they'll be right they'll be
[1:48:34] fruitful and must continue on brother
[1:48:36] bear said there's five offices elected
[1:48:38] of God God is set in the church Apostles
[1:48:39] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:48:42] God did that
[1:48:43] yeah come on yeah he said well that
[1:48:46] little gold palm trees I don't mean
[1:48:48] nothing I'll just take that and spend it
[1:48:49] the money
[1:48:50] God did it
[1:48:53] that little that little Ultra event
[1:48:54] since it don't mean nothing I'll just
[1:48:56] take that out put it in the house of
[1:48:57] bail God did it
[1:49:01] he said God always uses men for his work
[1:49:04] he said is that right he don't use
[1:49:05] organizations or Mechanical Devices he
[1:49:07] uses men the Holy Spirit fell upon men
[1:49:09] that's God's instrument here on the
[1:49:10] earth that was in 1947 in 1963 he said
[1:49:13] God won't leave his program that's the
[1:49:15] reason we know in this day it's got to
[1:49:16] be simple see now he always works in
[1:49:18] Simplicity but God in the beginning that
[1:49:20] could have made the son preach the
[1:49:21] gospel the winds preached the gospel or
[1:49:23] an angel preached the gospel but he
[1:49:25] ordained men for that purpose
[1:49:27] yeah and he never changes it
[1:49:31] he never ordained denominations he never
[1:49:33] ordained groups of men he didn't
[1:49:35] ordained men to preach the gospel not
[1:49:37] Machinery Mechanical Devices or any
[1:49:39] Angelic being it was men
[1:49:41] it was men let's get back to the old
[1:49:43] landmarks let's get back to the right
[1:49:45] way let's get back to what God Said
[1:49:49] amen
[1:49:51] let's get back to a man and a woman
[1:49:53] yeah let's get back to a husband and a
[1:49:56] wife let's go back to Ephesians 5 and
[1:49:59] Colossians 3 and First Corinthians 11
[1:50:01] and First Peter chapter two let's go
[1:50:03] back to family prayer let's go back to
[1:50:05] ordering the home
[1:50:06] let's go back to the house of God let's
[1:50:09] go back to being there when the doors
[1:50:10] are open he said it doesn't matter it
[1:50:12] does matter
[1:50:16] yes the third part of this that was
[1:50:17] faithfulness and giving and work
[1:50:20] I just want to close with this this
[1:50:22] morning
[1:50:23] the Bible says in all the princes and
[1:50:25] all the people rejoiced
[1:50:27] and brought in
[1:50:28] and cast into the chest
[1:50:30] until they had made an end in other
[1:50:32] words they filled up the chest
[1:50:34] now in second in verse 11 it says it
[1:50:37] come to pass at what time the chest was
[1:50:38] brought into the king's office by the
[1:50:39] hand of the Levites when they saw that
[1:50:41] there was much money
[1:50:42] the kingscribed on the high priest
[1:50:44] officer came and emptied the chest and
[1:50:45] took it and carried it to his place
[1:50:47] again thus they did day by day
[1:50:50] and gathered money in abundance
[1:50:53] let me leave this with you churches
[1:50:55] aren't repaired in a day
[1:50:57] every day
[1:51:00] some of them widows come back in drop
[1:51:02] their might in
[1:51:04] you don't know what that means
[1:51:07] some of you that pay tiers and I know
[1:51:09] you don't have the money to give 10 of
[1:51:10] your income
[1:51:11] that you're going to cut down on grocery
[1:51:13] I know that
[1:51:14] and I do everything I can to help you if
[1:51:16] you hear that today and we've got to
[1:51:18] fund here in the church for widows and
[1:51:19] for things like that if you have a need
[1:51:21] you have a need you go to us come to us
[1:51:24] and but I see you pay your tithes and I
[1:51:26] can't reject that Jesus didn't
[1:51:28] he said the example that why not because
[1:51:30] but does it does make me pray for you
[1:51:33] when I see it because I look at that and
[1:51:35] I think every day
[1:51:36] that's what keeps the church going
[1:51:39] every week
[1:51:41] every every Sunday every every two weeks
[1:51:44] here comes a woman
[1:51:45] drop her a little bit in the chest
[1:51:47] here comes a man again I'm not preaching
[1:51:49] about money I think about it every time
[1:51:50] you come to church you bring something
[1:51:51] with you yeah
[1:51:53] you come in every day you come in you
[1:51:55] bring your musical ability
[1:51:58] you bring your ability to preach
[1:52:00] you bring your ability to sing
[1:52:02] you bring your ability to amen
[1:52:06] I'm getting down there now
[1:52:07] you bring your ability to stay awake in
[1:52:10] church
[1:52:12] some of you that can't even stay awake
[1:52:14] in church but you bring your ability to
[1:52:16] pray yeah
[1:52:18] yeah and those of you who can't hear and
[1:52:20] can't speak you can't pray you know get
[1:52:22] old and it's hard but maybe you have a
[1:52:24] baby and it's hard to stay in church and
[1:52:25] hard to be in the house of God is the
[1:52:27] baby constantly keeps you out and you're
[1:52:28] caring for the baby but remember what
[1:52:30] you're doing you're setting an example
[1:52:31] yeah you're telling the devil what side
[1:52:33] he's on every time you come in that
[1:52:35] little oh God
[1:52:37] that little penny that that wouldn't put
[1:52:39] the gold on the temple that wouldn't
[1:52:40] that wouldn't overlay it that little
[1:52:42] Penny wouldn't do much it wouldn't do
[1:52:44] much but it inspired somebody with more
[1:52:46] come on when they saw the example of the
[1:52:49] one with the penny it inspired someone
[1:52:50] with more to bring a free will offering
[1:52:52] God needs all kinds he needs someone's
[1:52:55] with money and the ones without money
[1:52:57] but the ones without money sometimes are
[1:52:58] the ones that Inspire us to come and
[1:53:00] drop into the house of God the ones
[1:53:02] without gifts are sometimes the one who
[1:53:05] inspire me to preach the most
[1:53:07] you don't have no gift in your quiet in
[1:53:10] church and you just sit there and say
[1:53:11] well I don't ever do anything but you
[1:53:12] inspire me sister Jackie by sitting in
[1:53:15] the house of God because I know what
[1:53:16] you've been through I know what some of
[1:53:18] you sitting here on the back have been
[1:53:19] through I know the things in your life
[1:53:21] you inspire me when you come to the
[1:53:23] house of God you young families inspire
[1:53:25] me to bring my family to the house of
[1:53:27] God

[1:53:31] family there on the sea what are you
[1:53:32] doing faithfulness and giving of
[1:53:35] yourself
[1:53:37] that's how you rebuild the house
[1:53:41] and you do that at home faithfulness
[1:53:44] day by day
[1:53:46] we don't feel like praying today but
[1:53:48] we're going to pray
[1:53:49] God help us
[1:53:51] I stay so busy sometimes we go and go
[1:53:53] and go and do but I need to watch my own
[1:53:56] family
[1:53:59] I don't say you should make it a
[1:54:00] legalism although sometimes tradition
[1:54:01] helps but you don't want it just to be a
[1:54:03] tradition yeah
[1:54:05] but don't say you should make it
[1:54:06] illegally and say well we do this at a
[1:54:07] certain time but watch your family yeah
[1:54:10] make sure you're not blinded
[1:54:12] say brother Ben I can take it maybe you
[1:54:15] think you can take it yeah
[1:54:16] but let him that thinketh he stand and
[1:54:18] take heed yes as default that's right
[1:54:24] they did it day by day
[1:54:26] and gathered money in abundance
[1:54:29] every time the house you come to the
[1:54:30] house of God you bring a lake of fire
[1:54:32] your own spiritual currency
[1:54:35] amen

[1:54:39] back to the Lord and see chips sitting
[1:54:41] back there and they're faithfulness of
[1:54:42] the house of God they brought a lick of
[1:54:43] fire into the church didn't they I see
[1:54:46] amen
[1:54:48] I see brother Bill Poole come to the
[1:54:49] house of God and I pastored him many
[1:54:51] years ago but the bill come to the house
[1:54:52] of God his wife was sick for many years
[1:54:54] and unable to come but he's here with us
[1:54:56] now and become faithful but the bill
[1:54:57] that means something to me that's
[1:54:59] faithfulness to the house of God
[1:55:01] I could I could speak to each one of you
[1:55:03] today I don't have time but you
[1:55:05] understand every one of you I see you
[1:55:06] coming and you get married and you
[1:55:08] you'll come back to the house of God

[1:55:14] you you lose someone you still come to
[1:55:16] church you have trouble but you still
[1:55:18] come to church it inspires me to see you
[1:55:20] come
[1:55:21] yeah it inspires me sister Betty to see
[1:55:25] you sitting there on Sunday you may not
[1:55:26] realize it but it inspires me because it
[1:55:28] means something to be in the house of
[1:55:30] God and to see your son come with you
[1:55:32] bring you to church it inspires me
[1:55:35] I think it inspires more than me
[1:55:38] churches aren't repaired in a day
[1:55:41] but every time you come you bring your
[1:55:42] portion of God
[1:55:44] brother Brown said he works through you
[1:55:46] and I as portions of God he said that's
[1:55:49] why the Holy Spirit when it come on the
[1:55:50] day of Pentecost it broke all up that
[1:55:52] Pillar of Fire and divided itself in
[1:55:54] licks of tongues and set upon each one
[1:55:55] he said we have to have one another
[1:55:59] oh God can I say it can I say it for the
[1:56:02] people in the back for the people on the
[1:56:04] front for the people behind the pulpit
[1:56:05] listen we have to have one another
[1:56:08] oh my
[1:56:10] second chronicles 24 and 12 and the king
[1:56:12] in jail diah gave it such as gave it to
[1:56:15] such as did the work of the service of
[1:56:16] the house of the Lord and hired Masons
[1:56:18] and Carpenters to repair the house of
[1:56:20] the Lord and also such as wrought iron
[1:56:22] and Brass to men the house of the Lord
[1:56:24] so the workmen rot and the work was
[1:56:27] perfected by them what was it
[1:56:30] faithfulness in giving faithfulness and
[1:56:32] working
[1:56:33] and they set the house of God in his
[1:56:36] State and strengthened it and they
[1:56:37] didn't complain about it they had an
[1:56:39] eternal reward oh my their name would be
[1:56:42] associated with it all through eternity
[1:56:43] I don't want to complain about being a
[1:56:45] pastor I don't want to spend all my time
[1:56:47] whining and moaning and groaning about
[1:56:49] what how hard it is to be a pastor I
[1:56:51] understand it's hard but I'm happy to do
[1:56:53] the work because we're repairing God's
[1:56:55] house I'm not just talking about us I'm
[1:56:58] talking about God's house
[1:57:00] amen
[1:57:01] they were yielding themselves to do the
[1:57:04] work they were born to do
[1:57:05] I already had those gifts but now they
[1:57:07] yielded themselves
[1:57:10] Hallelujah
[1:57:12] it's manifesting himself to us in human
[1:57:14] flesh our flesh of the Holy Spirit as we
[1:57:16] can yield to
[1:57:18] that Holy Spirit musicians go ahead and
[1:57:19] come
[1:57:21] he said now there's the thing knowing
[1:57:22] how to yield yourself
[1:57:24] and some people are set in the church
[1:57:25] some can yield themselves to preaching
[1:57:28] some can yield themselves easily to
[1:57:30] teaching some can yield themselves to
[1:57:33] prophesying
[1:57:34] some can yield themselves to other gifts
[1:57:36] so all the gifts won't be alike
[1:57:38] excuse me there wasn't a like then Paul
[1:57:40] said they wasn't but each man is called
[1:57:42] and placed into the church
[1:57:44] for a purpose
[1:57:46] every one of you have a purpose yes
[1:57:50] and if you'll find out what God can use
[1:57:52] him best at
[1:57:53] and healed himself to that place he will
[1:57:57] be
[1:57:58] success yeah
[1:58:00] yeah oh God
[1:58:02] I've been wondered I've been wondering I
[1:58:04] I pray Lord
[1:58:07] how can I be a success as a pastor I
[1:58:09] don't even know what that means
[1:58:12] does it make sense if being success the
[1:58:15] pastor is numbers then TD Jakes has got
[1:58:17] us all beat
[1:58:18] and just use a common name
[1:58:22] if that's what success is then I want it
[1:58:25] but but that's not necessarily what God
[1:58:27] looks at as success
[1:58:29] but if I can instead of chasing the
[1:58:32] goals
[1:58:33] the success if I can just yield myself
[1:58:36] to my place
[1:58:38] yes I will be a success
[1:58:40] say God thank you for that can you see
[1:58:43] that in your own life you can yield
[1:58:44] yourself to being a real husband you
[1:58:47] will be a success yeah if you yield
[1:58:49] yourself to being a real life you'll be
[1:58:51] a success if you yield yourself to being
[1:58:53] a real you said but I've had so many
[1:58:55] struggles in my life but maybe that
[1:58:57] success in the eyes of God
[1:59:00] oh God you and I have been tasked with
[1:59:03] keeping God's house in repair so that
[1:59:06] our children yeah we'll have a home
[1:59:09] come back too
[1:59:11] yeah I want you to take a look around as
[1:59:13] they play something Softly
[1:59:15] I want you to take a look around this
[1:59:16] morning with every head bowed and every
[1:59:18] eye closed
[1:59:21] if my prodigal came back
[1:59:26] would they remember the house
[1:59:30] did they slide back into that spot
[1:59:33] or are so many other things missing
[1:59:36] but they wouldn't even recognize it as a
[1:59:38] house of God
[1:59:40] [Music]
[1:59:43] my prodigal came home
[1:59:48] what's missing from the tip I want you
[1:59:49] to take a good look around
[1:59:51] look first at your own life
[1:59:55] it's missing
[1:59:56] [Music]
[1:59:57] we'll spend all my time and the things
[2:00:00] of the world do I take time
[2:00:02] I know it's hard church I know sometimes
[2:00:04] you you say well I just deserve to have
[2:00:06] some rest and you do you you need rest
[2:00:08] you need to sometimes you have to take
[2:00:10] your mind off of things
[2:00:12] but even in that we ought to give our
[2:00:13] praise and glory to God
[2:00:15] and not just spend it wasting our time
[2:00:18] on the things of the world
[2:00:21] oh God
[2:00:22] help me today even if I'm with my family
[2:00:24] having a good day
[2:00:26] all right I want to be a success in that
[2:00:29] I want you to be in it Lord
[2:00:32] your head's about and your eyes are
[2:00:34] closed I I gotta
[2:00:36] a message from South Korea the other day
[2:00:40] and brother Michael Nutter who some of
[2:00:42] you know
[2:00:43] uh brother young man brother Philip was
[2:00:46] there in station the Army went to his
[2:00:48] church for a while
[2:00:50] and my daughter
[2:00:51] was the other night we didn't want to
[2:00:54] take her because the devil fought Us in
[2:00:56] this because they put practices for the
[2:00:58] intramural basketball at Highland they
[2:01:00] put them I'm saying this for a reason
[2:01:02] they put them
[2:01:04] on Wednesdays and Sundays
[2:01:08] we say we can't do that
[2:01:10] she said well they'll let us practice
[2:01:11] the first one was on Thursday so they
[2:01:13] let me practice one time I can I can go
[2:01:14] to a game I said okay so she went and
[2:01:17] they let her play with the other
[2:01:18] children
[2:01:20] and
[2:01:22] what she was playing with the other
[2:01:23] children
[2:01:24] she had a skirt on
[2:01:27] that was below her knees but it was just
[2:01:29] an athletic skirt and then she had
[2:01:30] something under it where it wouldn't fly
[2:01:32] up and
[2:01:33] she's running with a skirt on I took
[2:01:35] some pictures and posted I didn't think
[2:01:37] nothing about it was funny to me because
[2:01:39] well I tell you what third grade girls
[2:01:41] basketball is bad
[2:01:44] it's awful to watch but I set through
[2:01:47] that basketball game and I got a message
[2:01:49] a couple days later from South Korea for
[2:01:50] brother Michael Nutter he said brother
[2:01:52] Ben I wanted to tell you I've I've got
[2:01:54] some people in my church have been
[2:01:55] discouraged some others
[2:01:57] whose children whose girls grew up and
[2:01:59] went out in the world
[2:02:00] and don't dress like we dress anymore
[2:02:03] and they're in South Korea they're all
[2:02:04] alone there's almost no churches with
[2:02:07] this message
[2:02:08] and he said I I was he said I was trying
[2:02:11] to tell him God still has young women
[2:02:13] God still has girls that dress right
[2:02:16] he said I saw your daughter in the
[2:02:18] basketball game
[2:02:20] he said I saw the way she was dressed he
[2:02:22] said I want to thank you
[2:02:23] for sharing that with us
[2:02:25] he said because it encouraged the lady
[2:02:27] in South Korea that God still has some
[2:02:29] young ladies
[2:02:31] God
[2:02:33] want you to look around the house today
[2:02:35] the every decision that you make
[2:02:36] remember somebody's watching
[2:02:39] somebody's looking
[2:02:41] maybe you could be an encouragement to
[2:02:43] somebody across the ocean maybe an
[2:02:44] encouragement to somebody next door
[2:02:47] I told you over the last few weeks we've
[2:02:49] we've physically we're tired because
[2:02:51] we've been to all these different
[2:02:52] meetings and trying to reciprocate for
[2:02:54] them coming to ours and I I get so tired
[2:02:56] and I think well I just won't go but
[2:02:58] then I end up going anyway
[2:03:00] and I I ended up going last night the
[2:03:02] young lady come up to me and she said
[2:03:03] brother Ben I I'm from this area she
[2:03:05] said I know the way it is
[2:03:07] she said I just
[2:03:09] there's something in my heart she said I
[2:03:10] can't I want to tell say thank you for
[2:03:13] showing up I didn't do nothing I just
[2:03:15] showed up
[2:03:16] but it showed love to people can you can
[2:03:19] you just look around your house today
[2:03:20] and say I wanted to be repaired I want
[2:03:23] the love to be there and what is it that

[2:03:34] everything's fine then that's wonderful
[2:03:36] but if you find yourself with just a
[2:03:38] little bit of coldness a little bit of
