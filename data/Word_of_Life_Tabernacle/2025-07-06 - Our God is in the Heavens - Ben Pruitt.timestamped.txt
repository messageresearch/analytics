[37:24] I left a barren landing
[37:29] for
[37:31] stumbling. round in amnesia,
[37:35] bitterness and distress. But then I met
[37:39] the kinsman redeemer who's called the
[37:43] mighty one. He took this old Moabitete
[37:47] from the field and he brought me to his
[37:51] house
[37:53] and he said, "Fear not, my child for you
[37:59] are a part of me and I'll not rest till
[38:04] you are at my side.
[38:08] I will do all that you
[38:13] ask. I'll be a virtue in my eyes.

[38:49] All the mysteries being revealed. And
[38:52] now I see who I am. And I lay claim to
[38:57] all that's mine. I'm Lamb's wife.
[39:03] I've been bought with a price.
[39:07] He said, "Fear not my child, for you are
[39:13] a part of me, and I'll not rest till you
[39:18] are at my side.
[39:22] I will do all that you
[39:27] ask of me. You hold in my eyes.
[39:33] Virtuous woman,
[39:36] you are my bride.
[39:50] [Music]
[39:52] When I look back and see
[39:55] how much grace and love you've shown me,
[39:59] Lord, it brings me to my knees that you
[40:03] would even think about me.
[40:07] You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're still
[40:10] the greater
[40:13] and with faith I'll stand on your word
[40:17] because you're more than able
[40:24] my child for you are a part of me and I
[40:30] rest.
[40:32] You are at my side.
[40:36] I will do all that you
[40:41] ask of me. Your rule in my eyes,
[40:47] virtuous woman,
[40:50] you are my bride.
[40:56] And so I'm casting all my cares on you,
[41:03] Lord. And I know that you'll love me.
[41:08] [Music]
[41:10] Redemption by love.
[41:17] That's the greatest love story.
[41:24] Full restoration,
[41:28] full redemption.
[41:31] That's what seven angels in a cloud
[41:35] testify.
[41:37] My redeemer's
[41:39] no longer dead. He's alive
[41:44] and he's coming back for you.
[41:50] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[41:57] Lord, I know that you love me.
[42:05] Redemption by the blood.
[42:11] That's the greatest love story
[42:19] for restoration
[42:22] for redemption.
[42:25] That's what seven angels in a cloud
[42:29] testify.
[42:32] My redeemer's
[42:34] no longer dead. He's alive
[42:39] and he's coming back for you and me.
[42:50] Enjoy
[42:57] that.
[42:58] Aren't you glad for the redeemer? And
[43:00] he's coming back for you and me. Let's
[43:02] stand together. My life is in your
[43:04] hands. Give you
[43:05] [Music]
[43:08] Well, you don't have to worry.
[43:14] And don't you be
[43:17] afraid.
[43:21] Joy comes in
[43:24] the morning.
[43:26] Troules they don't last
[43:30] always.
[43:32] Oh for there's a friend
[43:36] named Jesus
[43:39] who will wipe your tears
[43:43] all the way.
[43:44] [Music]
[43:46] And if your heart
[43:49] is broken,
[43:52] why don't you lift your hands and say,
[43:57] "Oh, I know that I
[44:02] can make it.
[44:05] I know that I can stand."
[44:11] And no matter what may come my way,
[44:18] my life is in your hands.
[44:23] Oh, with Jesus I can take it.
[44:30] With him I know I can stand.
[44:36] But no matter what may come my way,
[44:43] my life is in your hands.
[44:49] So when your test
[44:52] and trials,
[44:55] they see.
[44:58] Anybody ever been there before?
[45:01] Oh, and all your friends
[45:05] and loved ones
[45:08] are nowhere to
[45:11] be found.
[45:14] Remember, there's a friend
[45:18] named Jesus
[45:20] who will wipe your tears
[45:24] all away.
[45:26] Oh, and if your heart is broken, oh, can
[45:31] we lift our hands this morning? Just
[45:34] lift your hands.
[45:37] All your hearts now. Oh, I know that I
[45:43] can make it.
[45:46] I know that I can stand.
[45:52] Oh, no matter what may come my way,
[45:58] my life is in your hands.
[46:04] Oh, with Jesus I can take it.
[46:11] With him I know I can stand.
[46:17] No matter what may come my way,
[46:23] my life is in
[46:27] your hands. I wonder if you just
[46:29] continue to play that song there. Amen.
[46:31] We're going to change order of the
[46:32] service and have our pastor come this
[46:33] morning. We're going to sing that one
[46:34] right there. Just stay on that song.
[46:36] Amen. I believe that's a testimony this
[46:38] morning. I know that I can make it. How
[46:40] many knows you can make it this morning?
[46:42] I know I'm an overcomer. In a time when
[46:45] so many fall away, we can't fall away.
[46:47] You believe that this morning? So, I
[46:50] just want us to just make that our
[46:51] testimony as our pastor comes this
[46:53] morning. And I was thinking, you know,
[46:55] when the test and trials comes, it don't
[46:58] matter cuz we've got a friend named
[46:59] Jesus. How many can testify of that this
[47:01] morning? Can you give the Lord a big
[47:02] hand clap of praise?
[47:07] And if you believe that this morning, I
[47:09] want us to just raise our hands and sing
[47:10] it with all of our hearts as our pastor
[47:12] comes. Oh,
[47:15] I know that I can make it. Do you know
[47:20] this morning? I know that I going to
[47:24] stand.
[47:26] Oh, no matter what may come my way,
[47:33] my life is in your hands.
[47:39] Oh, with Jesus my
[47:44] [Music]
[47:52] [Applause]
[47:54] [Music]
[47:56] way. Oh, my life is in your hands. Can
[48:01] we sing it one more time? Oh, I know.
[48:04] Oh, I know that I can make it. You know
[48:08] it this morning. Oh, I know that I I can
[48:14] stand.
[48:16] Oh, no matter what may come my way,
[48:23] my life is in your hands. Oh yes, with
[48:30] Jesus I can take it.
[48:34] Oh, with him I know I can stand.
[48:41] Oh, no matter what may come my way,
[48:48] my life is in.
[48:54] Believe that this morning. Let's bow our
[48:56] heads together for a word of prayer.
[48:58] Maybe you have a special need you'd like
[49:01] to lift to the Lord this morning by way
[49:02] of uplifted hand.
[49:04] know he sees every every need. Good to
[49:07] have each and every one of you with us
[49:09] this morning. God bless you, Lord Jesus.
[49:11] We we come to your house this morning
[49:14] and needy people. Lord, we know that
[49:17] you're a big God. You're able to meet
[49:20] our needs. So, we don't just come with
[49:22] requests this morning, but we come with
[49:24] expectation, Lord, of that you're going
[49:27] to meet our needs, that you're going to
[49:29] provide for us what we have need of.
[49:32] So we thank you for that Lord in advance
[49:34] God before the symptoms leave before
[49:37] even our need is met in phys in the
[49:40] physical world. We we by faith Lord we
[49:43] reach out this morning and we believe
[49:45] that you're meeting our need. I pray
[49:47] that you'd grant it now. We thank you
[49:49] for all that you do for you bless this
[49:51] service. Move me out of the way and
[49:53] speak directly to your people. We pray
[49:55] this morning in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[49:59] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[50:03] Amen. Turn with me to Psalms chapter
[50:06] 115. Psalms 115 verses 1 through3.
[50:13] Brother David, good to see you back
[50:14] there this morning. Good to have you.
[50:16] Different ones that haven't been here in
[50:17] a while. Justin, good to see you guys
[50:19] back and and uh some of you all uh sure
[50:23] I'll miss somebody, but good to have
[50:24] you. Ashley, I heard you singing this
[50:26] morning. She's here somewhere. Good to
[50:28] have her.
[50:29] and my brother-in-law, my it's hard to
[50:32] say my favorite brother-in-law, but I
[50:34] guess you are my favorite. You're my
[50:35] only brother-in-law, aren't you? And uh
[50:37] so Josh is my favorite brother-in-law.
[50:40] Glad to have him and my sister Tabitha
[50:42] with us this morning. Psalm chapter 115
[50:46] and verse one. Not unto us, O Lord, not
[50:49] unto us, but unto thy name give glory.
[50:53] For thy mercy and for thy truth's sake.
[50:57] Wherefore should the heathen say, where
[50:59] is now their God?
[51:02] But our God is in the heavens. He hath
[51:06] done whatsoever
[51:08] he hath pleased. That's a powerful
[51:11] statement. Pray the Lord will add his
[51:12] blessing to the word. You may be seated.
[51:15] I want to speak on that this morning.
[51:17] Our God is in the heavens. Our God is in
[51:22] the heavens. He hath done whatsoever
[51:26] he has pleased. Psalms 113 through 118
[51:29] are known as the hell psalms or praise
[51:32] psalms meant to be sung during the
[51:35] Passover. Psalms 115 especially is a
[51:38] reminder that our God isn't like other
[51:42] gods. He is not like other gods. Our God
[51:46] is omnipotent and their gods are
[51:49] impotent.
[51:50] There's a big difference. Our God is in
[51:53] the heavens.
[51:55] He has done whatever he wanted to do.
[52:00] Right now, there's a great revelation in
[52:01] this. I'm taking it slow to begin with
[52:03] because I I want it to really sink in
[52:06] because it would change our lives. If
[52:08] you could understand this this morning,
[52:10] it would change your life. It would
[52:12] change how you think about things. It
[52:14] would change how you react to bad things
[52:17] that happen or good things that happen
[52:19] or situations that come along or
[52:21] sickness that comes. If you believed, if
[52:24] you really understand that God is in the
[52:27] heavens and he has done whatever he
[52:30] pleased,
[52:32] right? Satan never stopped God.
[52:35] He never he never stopped him from doing
[52:37] what he what he from fulfilling his
[52:40] attributes. He never kept him from being
[52:42] God. It was not that God and Satan were
[52:45] in a battle and God lost so he had to
[52:47] retreat to heaven. No, God is in the
[52:50] heavens. And when Satan goes to do
[52:52] something, he's got to go ask God for
[52:55] permission
[52:57] whether or not he can do it.
[52:59] I wonder if we really understand that
[53:01] this morning. So, David is saying our
[53:03] God is in the heavens. It's a great
[53:06] statement about the sovereignty of other
[53:08] gods of of our God. In other words, if
[53:10] he's in the heavens, he's on the throne.
[53:13] Yeah.
[53:14] And if he's on the throne, it means he
[53:16] reigns.
[53:17] And if he reigns, it means he has the
[53:19] rule. It means he does whatever he
[53:21] pleases. And it means we don't get the
[53:23] glory he does. If we do anything good,
[53:26] it's because of God. And if we do
[53:28] anything bad, it's because he allowed
[53:30] something to happen in our life, but
[53:32] he's going to he's going to get a hold
[53:33] of the situation. Now, you understand? I
[53:35] know that's hard for us. It's hard for
[53:37] us. We want to have responsibility for
[53:39] our actions. And here on this level of
[53:41] earth, we need to take responsibility
[53:44] for our actions. But we understand in
[53:46] the big picture that God is in control.
[53:49] He is in the heavens.
[53:51] He has done whatever he wanted to do
[53:55] from the beginning of time. That that
[53:57] statement is always true and has always
[54:00] been true. So he does whatever he
[54:03] pleases. We don't get the glory. He
[54:05] does. See if he is Elohim, he is not one
[54:09] of many gods. He is the only God. Elohim
[54:13] means the selfexisting
[54:15] one. He is not limited by anything. His
[54:20] power is without limit.
[54:24] Oh church in knowledge. He is omnisient.
[54:29] And I know sometimes we want to we want
[54:32] uh you know say brother Ben preach to us
[54:34] something that'll help us in our
[54:35] everyday life. This will help you in
[54:38] your everyday life. If you could ever
[54:40] recognize how much control that he has.
[54:44] Yeah.
[54:45] Right. You could never get despondent. I
[54:47] know people get despondent sometimes to
[54:48] the point of wanting to take their own
[54:50] life. They they get they get in despair.
[54:53] They get depressed and even even wanting
[54:55] to uh maybe they get on drugs or alcohol
[54:58] or or cigarettes or something like that
[55:00] and because they say, "Well, I need it.
[55:02] I just feel bad about myself. I feel
[55:04] bad." If you could get a revelation this
[55:06] morning that God is in the heavens and
[55:08] he has done whatever he pleased.
[55:10] Yes.
[55:12] Yeah.
[55:13] You wouldn't have to turn to those
[55:15] things.
[55:16] Good.
[55:16] Now, now listen. He's not one of many
[55:19] gods. He's the only God.
[55:21] He's not limited by anything. His power
[55:24] without was without limit and knowledge.
[55:27] He's omnisient.
[55:28] Yeah.
[55:29] And brother Brandham said his
[55:30] omniscience makes him omniresent.
[55:33] Right. Because it means that if he's if
[55:35] he knows everything, he can be anywhere.
[55:40] He's never late.
[55:42] Yeah.
[55:43] He's never in a hurry.
[55:45] Are you with me now?
[55:47] He He's never He's never You ever felt
[55:50] like that? You say, "Well, I just missed
[55:51] it.
[55:53] Well, I I would have done that, but I
[55:54] just missed it. Just missed the bus.
[55:57] Just missed the plane. Just missed the
[55:59] million dollars.
[56:01] Just missed the job. Just missed that."
[56:03] God don't ever just miss.
[56:07] He's right on time.
[56:09] He He He is a creator. He is not He was
[56:12] not created.
[56:14] He has always existed.
[56:16] He was by himself
[56:18] and he created out of nothing everything
[56:22] and that's our God. Now listen, if God,
[56:25] brother Brandon says, if God is
[56:26] infinite, almighty, all powerful,
[56:29] omniresent, omnisient, why he knew all
[56:32] things from the beginning.
[56:35] So he know there's nothing out of cater.
[56:37] It's just us that thinks it is. It's
[56:41] everything run. Look back at it again.
[56:45] As long as things are going good, we
[56:46] believe this. Yeah.
[56:48] You know, you got a new car sitting out
[56:50] there and a good job. And you're sitting
[56:52] there thinking, "Well, all things work
[56:54] together for good,
[56:58] but all things include sickness,
[57:03] includes trouble,
[57:06] includes your friends turning your back
[57:07] their back on you if they do,
[57:09] includes trouble in your life,
[57:12] all things."
[57:14] All things. I I know Satan is trying to
[57:18] attack attack this generation. And I
[57:20] think sometimes we allow him to attack
[57:22] us because we don't have a good concept
[57:24] of God. God is not God because of me.
[57:27] He's not God because, well, I'll decide
[57:30] if he's God today. No, he's not God
[57:32] because I decide he's God. He's God
[57:34] whether I think he's God or not. He was
[57:36] God before I knew him. He was God before
[57:38] I met him. He was God. He knew me before
[57:40] I ever knew him. And he had chosen me to
[57:42] be one of his before I even knew to
[57:45] worship him. Oh God. But when I was
[57:47] against him, when I was running the
[57:49] other way, he already knew me. When I
[57:51] was at my worst moment of life, David
[57:53] said, "If I make my bed in hell, behold,
[57:55] thou art there."
[57:57] He's God.
[58:00] He said, "There's nothing out of Cater."
[58:03] He said, "Look back in his word and see
[58:05] what he's doing, and then we'll have an
[58:07] understanding."
[58:08] Abraham calls him Ellelon, the most high
[58:12] God. When he spoke to the king of Sodom,
[58:16] Abraham said, "I've lift up my hand unto
[58:18] the Lord, the most high God, the
[58:22] possessor of heaven and earth." The
[58:24] reason he says this is because he just
[58:25] got done paying tithes to Melzdc,
[58:29] the priest of the most high God. Genesis
[58:31] 14:18. and MelkiseDC, king of Salem,
[58:34] brought forth bread and wine, and he was
[58:37] the priest of the most high God. And he
[58:41] blessed him and said, "Blessed be
[58:43] Abraham of the most high God, possessor
[58:46] of heaven and earth." Now, it's a
[58:48] powerful statement. So, he's saying,
[58:49] "Everything in heaven and everything on
[58:52] the earth is possessed by the most high
[58:54] God." Elleon in the in the Hebrew, it's
[58:57] a it's it's the God above all gods, the
[59:00] high God, the the God who who's alone,
[59:04] the God who has no equal. Amen.
[59:07] The most high God, the possessor of
[59:10] heaven and earth. So, anything that you
[59:12] might need this morning, he is already
[59:15] the possessor of it. And and brother
[59:17] Brandon preaches a message called
[59:18] Possessing All Things. How many have
[59:19] ever heard it?
[59:20] Possessing all things. It's a good one
[59:22] to go back and listen to. It's a
[59:23] communion sermon. Yeah.
[59:25] Well, the Brandon preaches it from
[59:26] Melzdc and he says, "If God was a
[59:29] possessor of all things, then then
[59:31] Abraham was a possessor of all things
[59:33] because God gave it to him."
[59:35] And if Abraham was a possessor of all
[59:37] things, the seed of Abraham is the
[59:39] possessor of all things. If Melzdc was
[59:41] the priest of the most high God and
[59:43] Christ is the is a priest after the
[59:45] order of Melzdc, are you with me this
[59:48] morning? This isn't too deep for us. I
[59:50] think we can understand this. Melisedc
[59:52] is a priest of the most high God. Christ
[59:54] is the priest after the order of
[59:55] Melkisedc. And so if Christ was a
[59:57] possessor of all things then Mel Melzdc
[1:00:00] was a possessor of all things. Christ
[1:00:02] was a possessor of all things. We are
[1:00:04] joint hes with Christ. What are we?
[1:00:05] We're possessor of all things. Someone
[1:00:07] say it with me this morning. All things.
[1:00:10] That's why brother Brandham said Abraham
[1:00:12] could go after his fallen brother. He
[1:00:14] could go after Lot and bring back
[1:00:16] everything that was stolen from Lot. He
[1:00:18] said because Lot belonged to him.
[1:00:20] Listen, don't give up on somebody this
[1:00:22] morning. You be a possessor of all
[1:00:24] things.
[1:00:25] A possessor of all things. That's what
[1:00:27] we are. We're not called to be a bunch
[1:00:28] of wimps. We're not called to sit here
[1:00:30] and say, "Well, I was going to be a
[1:00:32] Christian, but somebody stopped me. I
[1:00:34] was going to be a believer, but somebody
[1:00:35] held me back. I want No, you're a
[1:00:37] possessor of all things. Go and take the
[1:00:40] promises of God." People
[1:00:45] turn to drugs
[1:00:47] and alcohol and depression,
[1:00:51] fear
[1:00:52] because they just don't really recognize
[1:00:55] that they already own it
[1:00:59] by faith in Christ
[1:01:02] by the new birth. Now look, the most
[1:01:04] high God, possessor of heaven and earth,
[1:01:05] owns everything.
[1:01:07] Nehemiah 9 and6
[1:01:10] says, "Thou even thou art Lord alone."
[1:01:17] He's not the Lord. And then I get to be
[1:01:19] the Lord sometimes.
[1:01:24] He's not only the Lord when I like it.
[1:01:28] He's not only the Lord when things are
[1:01:30] going good.
[1:01:31] He's the Lord.
[1:01:32] That's why we don't change the word. We
[1:01:34] leave the word the way it is. We don't
[1:01:36] change it for nobody
[1:01:38] because he said it.
[1:01:40] He can't be wrong.
[1:01:44] You see everything everybody, you know,
[1:01:46] men have set up dictators on the earth.
[1:01:49] And you forgive me. It's just coming to
[1:01:50] me as I'm preaching. But but men have
[1:01:52] set up dictators. They set up a Hitler.
[1:01:54] They set up men, politicians, a superman
[1:01:56] wanting somebody to be right all the
[1:01:58] time.
[1:02:00] Yeah. And none of them are.
[1:02:02] None of them have ever been right all
[1:02:03] the time about everything. All of them
[1:02:05] have been wrong about something.
[1:02:07] Listen, you want you want a a husband or
[1:02:09] wife, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, a
[1:02:11] pastor. You want them to be right all
[1:02:12] the time,
[1:02:14] but there's never been one.
[1:02:17] There's never been one,
[1:02:19] but there is one.
[1:02:21] Are you with me this morning? Who's
[1:02:23] right all the time?
[1:02:24] And when we set him up as God, when we
[1:02:27] worship him as God, you don't realize
[1:02:28] how important worship is because we're
[1:02:30] worshiping the most high God. We're
[1:02:33] telling him, "Lord, you are God.
[1:02:36] And when when my marriage is on the
[1:02:38] rocks, you're still God. When I when I
[1:02:40] don't have money to pay the bills,
[1:02:41] you're still God. When I when I struggle
[1:02:43] in my relationships, you're still God.
[1:02:46] When I struggle with my family, you're
[1:02:47] still God. When my when it seems like I
[1:02:49] just can't overcome, you're still God.
[1:02:51] And I know if I trust in you, I can be
[1:02:53] an overcomer. I know if I trust in you,
[1:02:56] I can have my healing. I know if I trust
[1:02:58] in you, I can Are you with me this
[1:02:59] morning?" Well, I'll bring a worship in
[1:03:01] our hearts. We are. the servants of the
[1:03:03] most high God.
[1:03:06] If he owns it, we own it.
[1:03:10] Nehemiah 9 and6, thou even thou art Lord
[1:03:14] alone.
[1:03:15] Thou has made heaven, the heaven of
[1:03:18] heavens with all their host the earth.
[1:03:22] There's things that God made in the
[1:03:24] heavens that we haven't seen yet.
[1:03:29] You know that's right. They don't have
[1:03:31] not seen
[1:03:33] the extent of the universe. They don't
[1:03:36] know how far it goes.
[1:03:39] God are he made it.
[1:03:41] He owns it. Right? The heaven of heavens
[1:03:45] with all their host, the earth and all
[1:03:48] things that are therein, the seas and
[1:03:50] all that is therein. And thou preservest
[1:03:54] them all. Yeah.
[1:03:56] And we're sitting here this morning
[1:03:57] saying, "Brother Ben, I don't know if
[1:03:58] the Lord's going to take care of me."
[1:04:02] And you're on a ball of gas.
[1:04:10] Come on, church. We need to correct our
[1:04:11] thinking.
[1:04:12] We need to stop correcting the word and
[1:04:15] correct our thinking.
[1:04:17] We're on a great big ball of gas
[1:04:20] and dirt and minerals and fire.
[1:04:26] lava down in the core of it
[1:04:29] which happens to be inhabitable by
[1:04:32] humans
[1:04:33] and from space it looks like a speck of
[1:04:35] dust.
[1:04:37] It's all it is.
[1:04:40] And we're
[1:04:42] and God said I preserve the heavens and
[1:04:46] the earth.
[1:04:47] The Bible says by his word they are kept
[1:04:50] in store
[1:04:52] until the day of judgment. Come on.
[1:04:55] The reason it's spinning is because he
[1:04:56] keeps it spinning
[1:04:58] because he said for it to spin. The
[1:05:00] reason it's orbiting the sun and all the
[1:05:03] things that it's doing, everything that
[1:05:04] it does, it's doing it because because
[1:05:09] he said so,
[1:05:11] right?
[1:05:13] Come on, church. See, we we think, well,
[1:05:16] but but he don't really he don't really
[1:05:17] care about me. He don't know anything
[1:05:19] about me. If he can see the earth, make
[1:05:22] it an inhabitable zone. Out of all the
[1:05:25] planets in the in in the in the in the
[1:05:28] uh solar system, out of all the planets
[1:05:30] in the universe, if he can see the
[1:05:32] earth, which is a very very small minute
[1:05:34] part of the of the solar system, if he
[1:05:36] can see that and he can put life on it
[1:05:38] and he can put oceans on it and he can
[1:05:40] make beauty out of it and he can make a
[1:05:42] people to live on it, even let sinners
[1:05:44] live on it rentree.
[1:05:47] Are you with me? Are you with me,
[1:05:48] church? He does all of that. He He He He
[1:05:51] lets him live here and and has mercy. If
[1:05:53] he can do that, he's got mercy for you.
[1:05:55] He's got grace for you. He can hold you
[1:05:57] up. You're not going down. You can be
[1:05:59] held up by the grace of God. You say,
[1:06:01] "Brother Ben, why do you preach this
[1:06:02] way?" Because Satan's attacking the mind
[1:06:04] in this day and age, trying to get
[1:06:06] people to think
[1:06:08] and and what he's trying to get you to
[1:06:10] do. Brother Joel preached on atmospheres
[1:06:12] here a couple weeks ago, and it's very
[1:06:14] important because what Satan knows,
[1:06:16] you're a creator.
[1:06:19] And he's trying to get you to disbelieve
[1:06:22] God
[1:06:23] and create an atmosphere of unbelief.
[1:06:27] Which is an uninhabitable zone
[1:06:29] for the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:35] Are you with me now?
[1:06:36] He has to pull away his influence. When
[1:06:39] you disbelieve, when you believe, he
[1:06:42] hovers over you. Are you with me now?
[1:06:45] So, he tries to get you to disbelieve.
[1:06:47] He tries to get you to speak because he
[1:06:49] knows how powerful your words are.
[1:06:53] Good.
[1:06:53] But if you could only see this morning
[1:06:55] that the most high God has got it in
[1:06:57] control, then you could end up being
[1:06:59] like Job who had a great revelation of
[1:07:02] God and and and they come to him. They
[1:07:04] said, "All these things have happened."
[1:07:05] And he said, "I came naked into the
[1:07:07] world. I'll go naked out of the world."
[1:07:08] He said, "I won't curse God. Blessed be
[1:07:11] the name of the Lord." And he fell down
[1:07:12] on his face and worshiped. What was it?
[1:07:15] He understood God is God and I'm not.
[1:07:18] I'm going to worship God whether I feel
[1:07:20] like it. I'm going to worship God
[1:07:22] whether things are going good or bad or
[1:07:24] whatever. I'm not going to worship God
[1:07:25] because I I hear a fast song or
[1:07:27] something. There's nothing wrong with
[1:07:28] that. But that's not why I worship God.
[1:07:30] I worship God because he's God. He's God
[1:07:32] when I'm sick. He's God when I'm well.
[1:07:34] He's God when I'm not feeling good. When
[1:07:36] I am feeling good, when I'm on the
[1:07:37] mountain or in the valley, he's still
[1:07:39] God.
[1:07:40] What right do we have to tell him,
[1:07:42] "Well, I'm feeling bad. You're not God
[1:07:44] today.
[1:07:47] I'm I'm being very straight with that,
[1:07:48] but you understand what I'm I'm trying
[1:07:51] to say. I don't mean to yell at you.
[1:07:53] He's God.
[1:07:56] I want you young people to understand
[1:07:58] that. He's got it in control. You don't
[1:08:01] have to push or shove
[1:08:04] or worry.
[1:08:06] We'll get to that in a moment. Now,
[1:08:09] looks
[1:08:11] look what he says. I'm still on the
[1:08:13] phone. Nehemia 96. This might take a
[1:08:16] while. Brother Joel.
[1:08:18] Boy, got quiet there for a minute. Have
[1:08:21] I ever been long-winded? Don't answer.
[1:08:28] The earth and all things that are
[1:08:29] therein. He created these things. He
[1:08:31] made them. The seas and all that is
[1:08:33] therein. And thou preservest them all.
[1:08:35] And the host of heaven worshipeth thee.
[1:08:39] Psalms 146:5. Happy is he that hath the
[1:08:42] God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is
[1:08:45] in the Lord his God, which made heaven
[1:08:48] and earth, the sea, and all that therein
[1:08:51] is, which keepeth truth forever, which
[1:08:54] execututeth judgment for the oppressed,
[1:08:57] which giveth food to the hungry. The
[1:08:59] Lord looth the prisoners. The Lord
[1:09:03] openeth the eyes of the blind. The Lord
[1:09:06] raiseth them that are bowed down. The
[1:09:08] Lord loveth the righteous.
[1:09:10] The Lord preserveth the strangers. He
[1:09:13] relieveth the fatherless and widow. But
[1:09:15] the way of the wicked he turneth upside
[1:09:18] down. Now notice what he's saying. He He
[1:09:21] is the great God, the most high God, the
[1:09:24] God who made the heavens and the earth.
[1:09:25] He's He's the most high God. He owns the
[1:09:28] heaven and the earth. You realize Satan
[1:09:29] could never own it. Satan could possess
[1:09:33] it. He could He could claim it. He could
[1:09:36] squat on it, but he could never own it.
[1:09:40] Satan could never own you.
[1:09:46] Again, the reason we like to think that
[1:09:49] we could be lost because we like to
[1:09:51] think that we saved ourselves
[1:09:54] from being lost.
[1:09:56] Somehow we fixed it.
[1:09:59] We didn't have anything to do with it.
[1:10:02] We didn't fix ourselves. He fixed us. We
[1:10:06] were lost, but he knew where we were.
[1:10:09] Are you with me now?
[1:10:11] We were not lost from him. Oh my. He
[1:10:14] knew where we were. And yet he sought us
[1:10:16] out and he found us and he called to us
[1:10:19] and he wooed us. But he was not. It was
[1:10:21] not a God who didn't know. He always
[1:10:23] knew where we were. We just had to come
[1:10:25] to ourselves and recognize who we were
[1:10:27] and who we belonged to. We were never
[1:10:30] not owned by God. We were in the devil's
[1:10:31] pawn shop,
[1:10:32] but we were still God's.
[1:10:36] If you pawn something, it still belongs
[1:10:39] to you. And he is not a a person who
[1:10:42] will pawn things and lose them. He
[1:10:44] didn't pawn them in the first place. We
[1:10:45] pawned ourselves. And we were we will
[1:10:47] not be lost because he had a plan for
[1:10:49] redemption.
[1:10:51] Are you with me now?
[1:10:52] He is the most high God. He owns the
[1:10:54] heaven and the earth. Satan could never
[1:10:56] own it. He may claim you, but he doesn't
[1:10:59] own you. Now, he owns you by purchase,
[1:11:02] but he was simply redeeming what was
[1:11:05] already his,
[1:11:07] right? So, he doesn't just own you by
[1:11:09] purchase. It's as not as if you were a
[1:11:12] slave that was purchased,
[1:11:14] but you were purchased because you
[1:11:16] already a son.
[1:11:17] You were already a daughter.
[1:11:19] So, he bought you back.
[1:11:21] Do we realize that this morning? Am I
[1:11:23] just preaching to myself this morning? I
[1:11:25] hope you understand what I'm trying to
[1:11:26] say. that that we were purchased by God.
[1:11:29] And and when we were purchased by him,
[1:11:31] he was buying us back. That's what
[1:11:32] redemption means. And so, Satan could
[1:11:35] not own you. Look at Revelation chapter
[1:11:37] 5 and verse one. Look, he said, "I saw
[1:11:39] in the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:11:41] throne a book written within and on the
[1:11:44] backside sealed with seven seals."
[1:11:49] I want you to notice it was sealed, but
[1:11:51] it was in his hand. Come on.
[1:11:56] It wasn't open yet,
[1:11:58] but it was in his hand.
[1:12:01] It was not revealed, but it was in his
[1:12:04] hand.
[1:12:04] Right.
[1:12:05] Why was it in his hand? Brother taught
[1:12:08] us, and we went through that in the
[1:12:09] brief, but I want to drop it in here
[1:12:10] because it's important. But the Brandham
[1:12:12] taught us that the forfeited title deed
[1:12:14] is now in the hands of the original
[1:12:16] owner, Almighty God.
[1:12:19] The title deed to the earth and to
[1:12:21] eternal life. When Adam forfeited it,
[1:12:23] listen, Adam did everything wrong he
[1:12:25] could do. Eve did everything wrong she
[1:12:27] could do. They denied the word of God,
[1:12:28] left the Garden of Eden, left a perfect
[1:12:30] place.
[1:12:31] You talk about backsliding. They didn't
[1:12:33] backslide from a normal church. They
[1:12:36] backslid from a church where God was
[1:12:37] their pastor
[1:12:40] where God come down and dwelt with them.
[1:12:42] Listen, church, it's not hopeless for
[1:12:44] you. You can come back to the altar. You
[1:12:46] can come back to the fire. You can be
[1:12:48] rejuvenated this morning. You can be
[1:12:50] renewed. It's not a hopeless case. Why?
[1:12:52] Because Adam and Eve were in the best
[1:12:53] place they could be. And they turned
[1:12:55] down God's word and left the Garden of
[1:12:57] Eden. And yet God, they were still
[1:12:59] God's.
[1:13:01] They were still his. Listen, when they
[1:13:03] left,
[1:13:04] the book,
[1:13:06] the deed to them
[1:13:08] and the deed to the earth did not go to
[1:13:12] Satan.
[1:13:14] When Adam forfeited his rights to all
[1:13:16] things to be possessor of all things, it
[1:13:20] did not go.
[1:13:23] You say, "Well, the devil's running me
[1:13:25] around." Only if you let him.
[1:13:31] It did. The book didn't go back to him.
[1:13:34] It went Oh, church.
[1:13:36] It went back to the original owner.
[1:13:39] Because the earth was one of God's
[1:13:41] attributes. It was not the devil's
[1:13:44] attribute. You are not the devil. Quit
[1:13:46] letting the devil tell you that you're
[1:13:48] not the devil's attribute. You're not
[1:13:50] worthless. You're not some little
[1:13:51] insignificant nothing. But there's a
[1:13:53] God. Hallelujah. Ellelion, the most high
[1:13:56] God is a possessor of the heavens and
[1:13:58] the earth.
[1:14:00] And you belong. You girls, you belong to
[1:14:02] him.
[1:14:05] I don't care what social media tells
[1:14:06] you.
[1:14:08] I don't care what the world tells you.
[1:14:10] You don't believe you are not worthless.
[1:14:16] I don't care what what your friends
[1:14:19] might say or what the people at school
[1:14:22] might say. You belong to God,
[1:14:26] the most high God.
[1:14:28] And he will not lose you. But he will
[1:14:30] seek you, brother Ryan, until he finds
[1:14:32] you. And he is found. Oh my. He will he
[1:14:35] will keep after you, come after you
[1:14:38] until he gets you. Yes,
[1:14:41] he is the possessor of heavens and earth
[1:14:46] and Satan's dirty hands.
[1:14:48] Come on now.
[1:14:49] Hallelujah. I love how Brother Brandham
[1:14:50] belittles the devil.
[1:14:53] One place he said he was toothless,
[1:14:56] right? Didn't have the keys to his own
[1:14:57] house.
[1:14:58] I love that.
[1:15:00] It's about time we quit giving him so
[1:15:01] much power.
[1:15:05] Look,
[1:15:06] he said Satan's dirty hands could not
[1:15:10] take it,
[1:15:11] so it went back in the hands of its
[1:15:15] original owner.
[1:15:17] There he sits on the throne with it in
[1:15:20] his hand, the title deed. He said, "Oh,
[1:15:22] that makes me feel religious." The title
[1:15:24] deed to eternal life. Abstract title
[1:15:26] deed to eternal life. When Adam forfeit
[1:15:28] it for wisdom instead of faith, it went
[1:15:30] back to the hands of the owner. Almighty
[1:15:33] God, he said, "What a great thing."
[1:15:35] The book was in his hands. Our
[1:15:37] redemption is not subject to a preacher.
[1:15:41] It's not in the hands of a preacher.
[1:15:44] It's not Oh, church.
[1:15:46] Preachers may come and go, but our
[1:15:48] redemption is not in the hands of a
[1:15:50] preacher.
[1:15:52] Hallelujah. He didn't even put your
[1:15:54] redemption in the hands of a prophet.
[1:15:57] A prophet couldn't hold it. A preacher
[1:15:59] couldn't hold it. He could only tell you
[1:16:01] what was on it, but he could not hold
[1:16:03] it.
[1:16:04] The lamb had to take the book and open
[1:16:06] the seals.
[1:16:07] Come on.
[1:16:08] Why? Because the lamb was God. They
[1:16:10] tried to make Jesus less of God
[1:16:12] than God. If he wasn't God, he couldn't
[1:16:14] take the book.
[1:16:15] Come on.
[1:16:15] If he wasn't God, he wasn't the original
[1:16:17] owner and he had no rights to it. But it
[1:16:19] had to be God who came down and and
[1:16:21] bought our redemption or he could have
[1:16:23] never claimed it
[1:16:25] if it wasn't God. The Bible says that
[1:16:28] the blood of God paid for our sins.
[1:16:33] You can break that down however you want
[1:16:35] to, but I believe he was God.
[1:16:37] He was man, but he was God.
[1:16:40] He was fully God. Listen, listen to me
[1:16:43] now. There he sits on the throne with it
[1:16:46] in his hand. the title deed. The book
[1:16:48] was in his hands, not in a preacher's
[1:16:49] hands, not in a pastor's hands. That's
[1:16:52] why we don't make a pastor the ultimate
[1:16:54] arbiter and judge of everything.
[1:16:56] Pastor has authority, but not over your
[1:16:58] salvation.
[1:17:00] Are you with me now?
[1:17:02] Church has authority. Deacons have
[1:17:04] authority, but not over your salvation.
[1:17:07] All we can do is offer it.
[1:17:08] He gave us the keys to heaven and to
[1:17:10] hell. And and and the church unlocks the
[1:17:12] gates by what? by preaching the word,
[1:17:15] not by holding it like Catholics who can
[1:17:17] excommunicate, but by preaching the
[1:17:19] word. Brother Brandon said Peter took
[1:17:20] the key and he used it on the day of
[1:17:22] Pentecost. When he said when he said
[1:17:24] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:17:26] in the name of Jesus Christ and for the
[1:17:27] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:17:29] the gift of the Holy Ghost, what was he
[1:17:30] doing? Unlock the key. Brother said when
[1:17:32] click in heaven would click on the
[1:17:33] earth.
[1:17:34] Yeah, right.
[1:17:35] That's the keys.
[1:17:36] Yeah.
[1:17:37] Not my ability to take you in or out of
[1:17:39] the church.
[1:17:40] Are you with me now?
[1:17:41] Come on. Not everybody has to go to the
[1:17:43] same church, but we all have the same
[1:17:44] God.
[1:17:45] Come on.
[1:17:47] Right.
[1:17:48] Look,
[1:17:50] who could make our redemption complete?
[1:17:53] What could make it complete? Now, look,
[1:17:55] it had to be God. It was all of his
[1:17:57] doing.
[1:18:01] It cried out for a redeemer,
[1:18:04] but it was his doing that created a
[1:18:05] redeemer.
[1:18:07] Look what Brother Brandham teaches us.
[1:18:09] Look, look. He's telling us it went back
[1:18:11] in the hands of the original owner. Look
[1:18:12] at Revelation 5:2. I saw a strong angel,
[1:18:15] proclaiming with a loud voice. I believe
[1:18:18] that's taking place in our day. Who is
[1:18:20] worthy? He's advertising for a redeemer.
[1:18:22] Who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:18:24] loose the seals thereof? No man in
[1:18:26] heaven nor in earth, neither under the
[1:18:27] earth was able to open the book, neither
[1:18:29] to look thereon.
[1:18:31] A message went out and said, "Who is
[1:18:32] worthy?"
[1:18:33] Advertising for a redeemer. And John the
[1:18:36] bride began to weep. He said, "I wept
[1:18:38] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:18:41] open and to read the book, neither
[1:18:42] looked on." That was John's legalistic
[1:18:43] stage.
[1:18:47] That's good right there.
[1:18:49] But Joel, you'll have to preach that
[1:18:50] sometime so the people can get it. But
[1:18:53] look, that's John's legalistic stage and
[1:18:57] we've all got to go through it. I
[1:18:59] realize we're sinners. Who is worthy?
[1:19:04] But but the the elder didn't let him
[1:19:06] stay there. But what did he do? One of
[1:19:09] the elders said to me, "Weep not.
[1:19:12] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:19:14] the root of David, hath prevailed to
[1:19:16] open the book and to loose the seven
[1:19:18] seals ro." He didn't say he needs to
[1:19:20] prevail. He said he has prevailed
[1:19:22] to open the book and to loose the seven
[1:19:24] seals. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:19:26] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:19:27] beasts, and in the midst of the elders,
[1:19:29] stood a lamb, as if it had been slain,
[1:19:30] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:19:32] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:19:34] into all the earth. And he came and took
[1:19:36] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:19:38] that sit upon the throne, who could take
[1:19:40] the book and open it up, the bloody
[1:19:41] lamb, who proceeded from the father. He
[1:19:44] was the only one, the logos that came
[1:19:45] from God, who was the fullness of God,
[1:19:48] took a body of flesh and became the son
[1:19:50] of man. Yes.
[1:19:53] He did not die.
[1:19:56] Oh, church. He didn't die to restore
[1:20:00] possession of the book to God.
[1:20:04] Are you hearing me?
[1:20:06] He didn't die to restore possession of
[1:20:10] all things
[1:20:11] to God.
[1:20:13] God already owned it,
[1:20:17] right? So whatever you have need of
[1:20:18] today, he didn't die to restore. Well,
[1:20:22] now God can heal. Now God God was
[1:20:24] already a healer.
[1:20:25] He was already a savior.
[1:20:28] He didn't die to restore the book back
[1:20:29] to God.
[1:20:30] He already had it in his hand.
[1:20:32] But God had to become a man.
[1:20:35] Hallelujah. That's why he had to be a
[1:20:37] man. He He couldn't stay a god. Oh my.
[1:20:40] The man had to possess all things. He
[1:20:42] had to possess the book. That's what was
[1:20:44] going to happen in the beginning. And
[1:20:45] Adam forfeited his right. But God said
[1:20:47] he already had a plan for redemption.
[1:20:49] His attribute would be displayed.
[1:20:51] Brother said that perfect attribute of
[1:20:52] God called love.
[1:20:53] Yeah.
[1:20:54] And when he was displayed in a body of
[1:20:56] flesh, what did he do? He did not die to
[1:20:58] restore possession to the original
[1:20:59] owner. He died to resto restore
[1:21:01] possession to us.
[1:21:03] So he took the book out of the hands.
[1:21:08] Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] So before you were saved,
[1:21:12] are you with me now? Before you were
[1:21:14] saved, you
[1:21:18] didn't have the book. You didn't know
[1:21:20] who you were.
[1:21:22] God knew who you were.
[1:21:24] So God had the book.
[1:21:25] Yeah.
[1:21:26] But what happened
[1:21:28] when the lamb
[1:21:30] took the book? He's already died. He
[1:21:33] come up a bloody lamb. What did he do?
[1:21:35] He come and he took the book. Take the
[1:21:37] book from me. See, he took the book. Now
[1:21:40] it's in his hands.
[1:21:41] But he's also the original owner
[1:21:44] cuz he's not two gods,
[1:21:46] right?
[1:21:47] It's one God.
[1:21:48] So the original owner still has the
[1:21:50] book.
[1:21:52] If you're a trinitarian, you can't
[1:21:54] believe that.
[1:21:56] You would have to believe that it passed
[1:21:57] from the original owner to the son.
[1:21:59] But we believe that the original owner
[1:22:01] still has the book. But what did he do
[1:22:03] with the book when he took the book? He
[1:22:06] opened the book.
[1:22:08] Yeah. I just read the quote to you the
[1:22:10] other day. Brother Brandon said that
[1:22:11] just recently happened. He said that in
[1:22:13] 1963.
[1:22:15] That happened in when a prophet
[1:22:17] preaches. That's how simple that is.
[1:22:20] God opened the seals.
[1:22:23] Showed a prophet what to say.
[1:22:26] Revealed to him what to say. And in his
[1:22:28] broken English and and and Kentucky
[1:22:30] hillbilly English, he he told us
[1:22:32] something we could understand
[1:22:35] in simplicity. God hiding himself in
[1:22:37] simplicity. But what was it doing? It's
[1:22:39] that word that was revealed by a prophet
[1:22:41] that claims us. It's that word that
[1:22:43] shows us he's the most high God. He He
[1:22:46] had it in his hand. He had me in his
[1:22:48] hands. I was an attribute of God. If I
[1:22:51] have eternal life, it's got to be God's
[1:22:52] own life, Zoe, that comes down in me.
[1:22:55] Then if I am an attribute of God, I have
[1:22:57] been claimed by God.
[1:23:00] That's why I have such a problem with
[1:23:01] people believe, well, the seals haven't
[1:23:02] been fully opened yet.
[1:23:05] Well, then this hasn't happened. We
[1:23:06] don't can't know who we are.
[1:23:08] But brother Brandham tells us, he said,
[1:23:10] "Now we have the perfect revelation
[1:23:12] from God with divine vindication."
[1:23:14] Yeah.
[1:23:17] Right. Are you with me now?
[1:23:19] He said, "Since the seals came open, the
[1:23:21] book become a new book."
[1:23:22] Yeah. Come on.
[1:23:24] Hallelujah. And in it was the mysteries
[1:23:26] of God hid from the foundation of the
[1:23:27] world. The thunders that uttered the
[1:23:29] mystery that was behind the seal came
[1:23:31] and was preached to us.
[1:23:33] I don't need to go back and reveal it.
[1:23:35] It was already revealed.
[1:23:38] But I'm telling you, it's important
[1:23:39] because it reveals to you who God is,
[1:23:42] right?
[1:23:42] And when you when you go down to the
[1:23:44] bank and there's no money in there or
[1:23:45] you look on your phone and there's no
[1:23:47] money in the bank, you realize he's
[1:23:49] still God. He still opened the seals. He
[1:23:51] still died for me. He still came down in
[1:23:54] our hour. He's the same yesterday,
[1:23:55] today, and forever. And I'm one of his.
[1:23:57] Yes.
[1:23:59] It's the revelation of who God is and
[1:24:01] who you are.
[1:24:02] Yeah.
[1:24:03] Who I am. Are you with me now?
[1:24:06] So the lamb took the book. The logos
[1:24:09] that came from God, the fullness of God
[1:24:11] took a body of flesh became the son of
[1:24:12] man and died to restore possession of
[1:24:14] the book to you, to me.
[1:24:18] Look now remember Genesis 14 where Adam
[1:24:20] stood there and he swore to the king of
[1:24:22] Sodom
[1:24:23] or or uh Abraham. Sorry, I'm getting
[1:24:26] old.
[1:24:28] That would have been a trick if Adam had
[1:24:29] stood there.
[1:24:32] But Abraham stood there and he he lifted
[1:24:33] his hand to the most high God, possessor
[1:24:37] of heavens and earth
[1:24:38] and he swore to the king of Sodom said,
[1:24:40] "I won't take anything of yours because
[1:24:41] it all belongs to me."
[1:24:45] Hallelujah. That's a revelation right
[1:24:47] there.
[1:24:48] I won't make deals with the devil to get
[1:24:51] some momentary gain when it all belongs
[1:24:53] to me anyway.
[1:24:56] Hallelujah. So Abraham stood there and
[1:24:58] he lifted his arm up, lifted his hand
[1:25:00] and he swore,
[1:25:02] oh my, by the by the most high God, the
[1:25:05] one he just met in the form of Melzdc.
[1:25:08] Yes.
[1:25:09] And he said he's a possessor of heaven
[1:25:11] and earth. Look at Revelation 10:1. I
[1:25:13] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:25:15] heaven. And we know this angel was
[1:25:17] Christ.
[1:25:18] How many know that? He said only Christ
[1:25:19] it could be clothed with a cloud. A
[1:25:21] rainbow was upon his head. His face was
[1:25:23] it as it were the sun. His feet as
[1:25:25] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand.
[1:25:29] Come on, church.
[1:25:30] In his hand,
[1:25:32] who has ownership of it? The mighty
[1:25:33] angel.
[1:25:35] He came as a bloody lamb, but this time
[1:25:37] he's coming as a mighty angel.
[1:25:39] He came as a mighty angel. And he had in
[1:25:41] his hand a book.
[1:25:44] Open.
[1:25:47] Hallelujah.
[1:25:48] Open. If you if you can understand that
[1:25:52] this has taken place in our day, it will
[1:25:54] open up the message to you. That's
[1:25:56] right.
[1:25:57] Right. That's the that's the doorway you
[1:25:59] open begin to open up and say, "Oh, I
[1:26:01] recognize this is what God was doing."
[1:26:04] Right? So, the message, not a book of
[1:26:06] laws. It's not a bunch of dos and
[1:26:08] don'ts.
[1:26:09] God came down.
[1:26:12] Spoke through a prophet speaks through
[1:26:14] the bride. He said the bride would be
[1:26:15] the final voice to the final age.
[1:26:17] Yeah.
[1:26:18] Right. And what is he doing? What is he
[1:26:20] doing? John went to prophesy again once
[1:26:22] he took the book. Remember, that's what
[1:26:23] we got to do. Now he had in his hand a
[1:26:25] little book open. He said his right foot
[1:26:26] on the sea, left foot on the earth, and
[1:26:29] he cried with a loud voice. When a lion
[1:26:32] roars, when he cried, seven thunders
[1:26:34] uttered their voices. When the seven
[1:26:36] thunders had uttered their voices, I was
[1:26:38] about to write and I heard a voice from
[1:26:40] heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those
[1:26:41] things which the seven thunders uttered,
[1:26:42] write them not." The angel which I saw
[1:26:44] stand upon the sea and upon the earth.
[1:26:46] What did he do? Lifted up his hand to
[1:26:48] heaven
[1:26:49] and swear by him.
[1:26:52] Hallelujah. The original owner,
[1:26:55] Ellelion, the the most high God that
[1:26:58] liveth forever and ever, who created
[1:27:01] heaven and the things that therein are,
[1:27:03] and the earth and the things that
[1:27:04] therein are, and the sea and the things
[1:27:06] which are therein, that there should be
[1:27:08] time no longer. In other words, there's
[1:27:09] no more delay. This is it.
[1:27:11] This is the last stage.
[1:27:14] Come on.
[1:27:20] You realize why brother Random had to
[1:27:21] come down and preach. Who is this
[1:27:22] Melzdc?
[1:27:23] Come on.
[1:27:25] Right. God come down in our time and
[1:27:29] spoke to us. And we realize Melzdc that
[1:27:33] was one of those seven thunders. Melzdc
[1:27:36] was the most high God
[1:27:39] in a theophony form,
[1:27:41] in a body form. Are you with me now?
[1:27:44] Revelation 10:7, but in the days of the
[1:27:47] voice of the seventh angel, not the
[1:27:51] mighty angel that came down, but the
[1:27:52] voice of the seventh angel, that's the
[1:27:55] earthly prophet, right? An angel as a
[1:27:57] messenger. When he shall begin to sound,
[1:27:59] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:28:01] he had declared his servants of the
[1:28:03] prophets. There's an angel in heaven.
[1:28:04] There's an angel on the earth. Listen,
[1:28:05] brother Brandon said, "God came down and
[1:28:06] become flesh and died his the death in
[1:28:08] Christ so that he could clean the church
[1:28:11] in order to get into it for fellowship."
[1:28:14] God loves fellowship. I believe that
[1:28:17] Christians love fellowship. Don't you?
[1:28:19] Look, we might have little differences
[1:28:20] and disappointments and things, but we
[1:28:22] still love to fellowship with one
[1:28:23] another.
[1:28:24] Right? Why? Because that's an attribute
[1:28:26] of God.
[1:28:27] He said that's what he made the man at
[1:28:29] the first time was for fellowship. God
[1:28:31] dwelt alone with cherubam. And notice
[1:28:33] now, he made man and man fell. So he
[1:28:36] came down and redeemed man because God
[1:28:38] loves to be worshiped. The very word God
[1:28:40] means object of worship. I know they say
[1:28:42] we shouldn't gather and worship anymore,
[1:28:44] but they're going to be doing that in
[1:28:45] heaven.
[1:28:49] Now look, and this that comes among us
[1:28:51] as a pillar of fire as something that
[1:28:53] changes our hearts. He said, I passed
[1:28:56] that too quick. This that comes among
[1:28:59] us.
[1:29:00] Come on.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah. as the pillar of fire. As a
[1:29:04] pillar of fire, the pillar of fire that
[1:29:06] was t the picture was taken of it. You
[1:29:08] say, "Well, I wish that was here." It is
[1:29:10] here.
[1:29:11] Brother Brandon said, "The pillar of
[1:29:12] fire become a person."
[1:29:14] That person is Christ who lives in you.
[1:29:17] Right? The pillar of fire is the Holy
[1:29:18] Ghost in you.
[1:29:20] Right? That's very simple. Pillar of
[1:29:22] fire is here. But he let his picture be
[1:29:24] taken with the prophet to vindicate that
[1:29:26] prophet's message,
[1:29:28] right? That that he was speaking, God
[1:29:30] was speaking through a prophet. But
[1:29:32] look, this that comes among us. This
[1:29:34] that comes among us as a pillar of fire
[1:29:36] as something that changes our hearts.
[1:29:39] That is the same God.
[1:29:43] Brother Brandham says this, I'm
[1:29:45] paraphrasing so you can go find the
[1:29:46] quote, but brother Brandham says that
[1:29:49] that that he said that warm feeling that
[1:29:50] you have, he said he said when the
[1:29:52] pillar of fire comes in, you can feel
[1:29:54] it.
[1:29:55] It's something you can actually feel the
[1:29:58] presence of God.
[1:29:59] Now the feeling is not him. That's the
[1:30:01] effect of his presence.
[1:30:03] Brother Brandon would tell the people
[1:30:04] there's a warm feeling on you. He said
[1:30:06] he would tell you feel that warm
[1:30:07] feeling. That's the pillar of fire
[1:30:09] standing right above you.
[1:30:11] So the pillar of fire is right in this
[1:30:12] room this morning.
[1:30:14] Are you with me now? The same pillar of
[1:30:17] fire
[1:30:18] that is among us
[1:30:20] right at every pew. Where did it do it
[1:30:22] on the day of Pentecost? It divided
[1:30:23] itself into 120 people.
[1:30:26] That same pillar of fire is still here
[1:30:28] today. Come on.
[1:30:29] And he's right here. You can feel the
[1:30:31] presence of it.
[1:30:34] Oh, church.
[1:30:35] I don't believe we should ever have a
[1:30:36] dull service.
[1:30:37] I don't believe it should ever be a
[1:30:39] throwaway service or just something we
[1:30:41] do for a form, but if the pillar of fire
[1:30:43] is here, then I can worship in the
[1:30:45] presence of the almighty God. I can
[1:30:48] worship in the presence of Elleion. I
[1:30:50] can worship in the presence of the God
[1:30:52] who made the worlds.
[1:30:53] That same pillar of fire, that is the
[1:30:55] same God that said, "Let there be
[1:30:57] light." and there was light. He's the
[1:31:00] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[1:31:02] said, "Now, in the beginning, God dwelt
[1:31:04] alone with his attributes that I spoke
[1:31:05] of this morning." That's his thoughts.
[1:31:07] There was nothing. I I hope you can
[1:31:09] fellowship with me on the word just for
[1:31:10] a minute. Hang with me for a little bit.
[1:31:12] The burgers, we ain't going to start
[1:31:14] cooking them till we're done. So,
[1:31:17] they'll be there this morning. Just
[1:31:19] fellowship with me for a moment. Look,
[1:31:21] let there he said the same God said,
[1:31:23] "Let there be light. In the beginning,
[1:31:25] God wrote alone with his attributes.
[1:31:28] That's his thoughts. There was nothing.
[1:31:30] Just God alone. But he had thoughts.
[1:31:34] And listen, when you're alone with your
[1:31:37] thoughts, that has power.
[1:31:39] Has power for good and evil
[1:31:41] because you're made in the image of God,
[1:31:44] right?
[1:31:46] That's why you need to be around the
[1:31:47] people of God.
[1:31:51] I mean, God, there's nothing evil, so it
[1:31:52] can only produce good. But you have a
[1:31:55] flesh.
[1:31:56] Sometimes when you're alone with your
[1:31:57] thoughts, what happens? Evil comes out.
[1:32:02] It don't come out of your soul. Not if
[1:32:04] you're saved.
[1:32:06] Comes out of your flesh. See, can evil
[1:32:08] come out of a believer's flesh?
[1:32:09] Absolutely.
[1:32:11] If not, you wouldn't have to worry. Men
[1:32:13] wouldn't have to be careful around women
[1:32:14] that they weren't married to. They they
[1:32:16] could just do whatever they wanted to.
[1:32:18] Had somebody tell me, "If I got the Holy
[1:32:19] Ghost, I could I could look at anything.
[1:32:20] It wouldn't bother me." That's not true.
[1:32:22] Well, the Brandon taught us that wasn't
[1:32:24] true. You're still twothirds unsaved.
[1:32:26] You got a body and a spirit.
[1:32:28] Right? There got to be something come in
[1:32:30] on the inside to control that.
[1:32:32] But it's free will. It's it's faith or
[1:32:34] doubt that allows him to have control
[1:32:36] over you.
[1:32:36] Come on.
[1:32:37] Right? So when you dwell alone with your
[1:32:39] thoughts,
[1:32:40] you need to make sure that those
[1:32:41] thoughts are his thoughts.
[1:32:44] Are you with me now?
[1:32:45] Because Satan will make you think you're
[1:32:47] crazy. He'll make you think you're not
[1:32:49] worthy. He'll make you think you're
[1:32:50] still a sinner. He'll make you think you
[1:32:52] you should do this or do that. But the R
[1:32:54] said he'll make you try to fall in love
[1:32:55] with somebody else's wife. He'll he'll
[1:32:57] make you do all kinds of crazy things.
[1:33:00] So don't just be alone with your
[1:33:02] thoughts. Let his thoughts which is the
[1:33:04] word revealed word is the thoughts of
[1:33:06] God. But remember in the back part of
[1:33:07] his mind he had some thoughts he wanted
[1:33:09] to express. That's the message of the
[1:33:11] hour. You and I heard it in our hour.
[1:33:13] When we hear the message, what are we
[1:33:15] doing? We're letting God express his
[1:33:17] thoughts.
[1:33:17] Come on. Amen.
[1:33:20] When he was alone with his thoughts.
[1:33:22] You ever been there?
[1:33:25] Out of out of when you're alone is your
[1:33:27] thoughts. You're not influenced. See,
[1:33:28] there was nothing there to influence
[1:33:29] him. It's just him. And out of that came
[1:33:32] you
[1:33:38] how could you be more perfect?
[1:33:42] Now listen to me, church. You say,
[1:33:44] "Well, I'm I'm not up to stuff. I'm not
[1:33:50] message material." If God called you,
[1:33:54] how could you be more perfect than you
[1:33:58] are right now
[1:33:59] in the mind of God?
[1:34:01] Because you proceeded, you're a thought
[1:34:03] of God. You proceeded from a being that
[1:34:06] can't be wrong,
[1:34:08] the most high God. That's where you came
[1:34:11] from.
[1:34:12] How could you be more perfect? He said,
[1:34:15] "But I fail." You need to surrender
[1:34:18] to the most high God.
[1:34:23] Are you with me now?
[1:34:25] Let that pillar of fire fill you,
[1:34:27] control you. Look, he he said he was the
[1:34:30] great architect
[1:34:31] there by himself. He had a plan.
[1:34:34] He said a word is a thought. When it's
[1:34:35] expressed, it's a word. A thought
[1:34:36] expressed is a word, but it has to be a
[1:34:38] thought first. So God's attributes it
[1:34:41] becomes a thought then a word. He said
[1:34:42] those who have tonight eternal life was
[1:34:44] with him and in him in his thinking
[1:34:48] before there was an angel star cherubam
[1:34:51] or anything else
[1:34:56] there was Jaden.
[1:34:58] There was Matney. Right
[1:35:01] in his thoughts
[1:35:03] he thought of you. You said boy starting
[1:35:06] to look like my dad. I'm ugly.
[1:35:12] But God made you.
[1:35:14] I'm sure my boys thought that.
[1:35:17] We've talked about that. Brother Logan
[1:35:20] and I have talked about that. Someday
[1:35:21] they're going to be us.
[1:35:26] Look forward to it, guys.
[1:35:32] But you were in his thoughts,
[1:35:36] right? So everything imperfect is not
[1:35:38] from God.
[1:35:39] What's perfect is from God.
[1:35:41] But it's what he thought was perfect.
[1:35:44] Not what the world says is perfect. Not
[1:35:46] their idea of beauty. It's just fake.
[1:35:49] But his idea of beauty.
[1:35:50] Come on.
[1:35:51] Are you with me now?
[1:35:53] You don't have to take a backseat to
[1:35:54] nobody.
[1:35:56] Say, "Well, I have a I have a nice super
[1:35:59] sports car. I have a
[1:36:02] I got to come down a little level for
[1:36:04] these younger ones. I don't think very
[1:36:05] many sports cars in our group,
[1:36:09] but I got a I got the best iPhone.
[1:36:14] Everybody else is like, "Man, I wish I
[1:36:16] had an iPhone. This old Android, man, is
[1:36:18] dragging me down.
[1:36:20] My daughter's tethered to a a tablet
[1:36:26] and she just we just won't we haven't
[1:36:28] gotten her phone. She just Oh, she could
[1:36:31] just have a phone.
[1:36:36] But you can tell somebody say, "Well,
[1:36:38] you're, you know, you're not as good as
[1:36:39] me. You don't have a phone." But you
[1:36:41] were in the thoughts.
[1:36:44] Are you with me? I know I'm taking it
[1:36:46] slow, but I want you to understand. I
[1:36:47] want this. I want us to grasp the
[1:36:49] concept. I could get up here and yell at
[1:36:51] you for an hour and and maybe wouldn't
[1:36:53] you wouldn't understand what I'm trying
[1:36:54] to say, but I want you to understand it.
[1:36:55] I was in his thoughts.
[1:36:58] What could be more perfect
[1:37:00] than being in his thoughts?
[1:37:04] So I'll worship him. I'll surrender to
[1:37:06] him. I'll be what he wants me to be
[1:37:09] because he chose me from the beginning.
[1:37:11] He created me in his thoughts.
[1:37:17] He said if you have eternal life, you
[1:37:18] always was. It's not your being here,
[1:37:19] but the shape and form
[1:37:23] that the infinite God. So the real you,
[1:37:25] there's you
[1:37:27] and then there's you.
[1:37:29] Brother Brandon taught even our natural
[1:37:31] birth was predestined. You know he
[1:37:32] taught that.
[1:37:34] But our spiritual birth is is a
[1:37:36] predestinated seed that come from God,
[1:37:38] the thought of God. But our natural
[1:37:40] birth, he said he chose us to be what we
[1:37:42] are even in the natural. But that isn't
[1:37:44] what we'll always be.
[1:37:47] Hallelujah. Thank God. One day we'll be
[1:37:51] like he wanted us to be how he saw us.
[1:37:54] God had a photo album, if we can say it
[1:37:56] that way. He had a picture of you. at at
[1:37:59] what you were at your best and that's
[1:38:02] what he wants you to be. But even at
[1:38:04] your best in this life, you were a
[1:38:05] sinner. You you had a flesh that was
[1:38:08] wrong. But he's going to take you better
[1:38:09] than your best.
[1:38:11] Glory to God.
[1:38:14] Amen.
[1:38:15] You know, sometimes, you know, people
[1:38:16] say, "Well, will we recognize each other
[1:38:17] in heaven?" I think we will, but I'll
[1:38:19] say this. You might have trouble
[1:38:20] recognizing me because you've always
[1:38:21] seen me with mistakes.
[1:38:27] I'm a walking mistake.
[1:38:30] And I'm I'm ready to admit that. Come
[1:38:32] on, church. We're not We're not angels.
[1:38:34] We don't have halos. We're walking
[1:38:36] mistakes. But he don't make no mistake.
[1:38:39] So when you see me up there, I'll be
[1:38:41] without mistake. Praise God.
[1:38:43] I'll be able to preach and I won't
[1:38:44] preach at all. I'll sing and won't won't
[1:38:46] miss a word.
[1:38:49] Look, if he look he said if he wasn't
[1:38:53] infinite he isn't God. God has to be
[1:38:56] infinite. We are finite. He is infinite.
[1:38:58] And he was omniresent, omnisient,
[1:39:00] omnipotent. If he isn't, he can't be
[1:39:03] God.
[1:39:03] Amen.
[1:39:04] If you don't make him the most high God,
[1:39:08] he's not God at all.
[1:39:11] He can either save you and heal you and
[1:39:15] keep your marriage and keep your home
[1:39:18] and help you out in life or he's
[1:39:20] nothing.
[1:39:25] Either his word is everything or it's
[1:39:28] useless.
[1:39:31] I believe it's everything. How about you
[1:39:32] this morning?
[1:39:35] He he he said if he isn't, he can't be
[1:39:37] God. He knows all things, all places.
[1:39:39] because of his omnipresent. Omnicient
[1:39:40] makes him omnipresent. He's not like the
[1:39:42] wind. He's a being. He dwells in a
[1:39:44] house, but being omnisient knowing all
[1:39:45] things makes him omnipresent because he
[1:39:47] knows everything that's going on. There
[1:39:49] can't be a flea bat its eye. But what he
[1:39:52] knowed it, he knew it before there was a
[1:39:54] world. How many times it batted eye, how
[1:39:56] much tallow it had in it before there
[1:39:58] ever was a world. That is infinite.
[1:40:02] We can't comprehend it in our minds, but
[1:40:05] that's God. God infinite. Remember you,
[1:40:09] your eyes, your stature.
[1:40:12] Hear me church. We get so down on
[1:40:14] ourselves.
[1:40:16] But your eyes, your stature, whatever
[1:40:19] you was, you were in his thinking at the
[1:40:22] beginning.
[1:40:23] And the only thing that you are is
[1:40:24] expression, word. You don't need
[1:40:27] Hollywood to make you look good. He told
[1:40:29] you, he said, you look good.
[1:40:32] You look good to him. You don't need to
[1:40:35] be famous to look good to God. He knows
[1:40:37] you. He knows who you are.
[1:40:39] Yeah.
[1:40:41] He said he thought it, he spoke it, and
[1:40:42] here you are. If it isn't all, if he
[1:40:44] wasn't in his thinking, there's no way
[1:40:45] at all for you to ever be there. He's
[1:40:47] the one that gives eternal life.
[1:40:49] He said it's not him that willth or him
[1:40:50] that runth, but God.
[1:40:52] That his predestin predestination might
[1:40:54] stand true. He could choose before any
[1:40:55] time. God is sovereign in his choosing.
[1:40:57] Did you know that God is sovereign? Who
[1:40:59] was back there
[1:41:00] to tell him a better way to make the
[1:41:02] world?
[1:41:02] Come on.
[1:41:05] who was back there. You know, you know
[1:41:06] how it is. If you're a plumber,
[1:41:08] everybody's got a better idea. I was
[1:41:10] sitting there watching Caleb put a hole
[1:41:12] in my wall the other day. I'm sitting
[1:41:13] there thinking, I could do that better.
[1:41:15] Actually, I wasn't. I was sitting there,
[1:41:17] but I was admiring his work. But you
[1:41:20] realize how annoying it is if I stand
[1:41:23] there and overlook over his shoulder as
[1:41:24] I like to do, watch the work getting
[1:41:26] done. You know, I said that'd be better
[1:41:28] over here. I don't know anything about
[1:41:29] it. I don't have a clue till it gets
[1:41:31] finished what he's doing. Looks like
[1:41:33] he's tearing stuff up, but it gets done.
[1:41:36] It looks nice. Thought, well, praise the
[1:41:38] Lord.
[1:41:41] Who was there
[1:41:43] when he made Jaden? Now, think about
[1:41:45] this. When he made you, who was there to
[1:41:47] tap him on the shoulder and say, "No,
[1:41:49] no, do it different."
[1:41:54] When he thought of you, who was there to
[1:41:56] tell him, "Oh, no, not her. She
[1:42:01] not not Millie. She's She's too
[1:42:04] excitable. Don't make her like that. She
[1:42:07] may not be at all. I'm just It's just an
[1:42:09] illustration.
[1:42:12] She may, you know, who But who was there
[1:42:14] to tap him on the shoulder?
[1:42:18] Are you with me now?
[1:42:19] Listen,
[1:42:21] I'm doing this on purpose today. We need
[1:42:23] to understand that God made us. He made
[1:42:25] us a certain way and he just wants us to
[1:42:28] live out his life. what he wants,
[1:42:31] what he wants. We get so up and down
[1:42:34] based on what people think about us.
[1:42:36] Listen, church, don't do that. Love
[1:42:38] people, but worship God.
[1:42:43] Love people, but love God more than you
[1:42:47] do people. Worship God. Worship God.
[1:42:50] Don't worship the opinions of people.
[1:42:53] Worship the opinion of the Almighty God.
[1:42:57] Who would dare to tell him he was
[1:43:00] running his business wrong?
[1:43:04] You know, I just just for us preachers,
[1:43:06] I know it's something you get all the
[1:43:07] time. And I don't I don't mind it at all
[1:43:09] because people don't understand it is
[1:43:10] something that it's a gift. It's
[1:43:12] something that it's hard to do. Very
[1:43:14] difficult. God has to gift you to be
[1:43:15] able to stand and do it. And and yet at
[1:43:17] the same time, you realize that you
[1:43:18] could have a gift, not even be saved,
[1:43:21] right? But but it is a gift. God gives
[1:43:23] you the ability to do that. And people
[1:43:24] all the time tell you, "Well, if I was a
[1:43:26] preacher, I'd do that. If I was a, you
[1:43:28] know, this is the way I would have
[1:43:29] preached it. Well,
[1:43:31] you know,
[1:43:33] who's who would dare to tell God,
[1:43:35] though? It's one thing to tell a
[1:43:37] preacher because you might be one one
[1:43:38] day. I don't know. It's one thing to
[1:43:39] tell a preacher, but who would dare tell
[1:43:41] God? He was running his business wrong.
[1:43:45] Even the very word itself is very
[1:43:47] sovereign. He said, even the revelation
[1:43:49] is sovereign. He reveals to whom he will
[1:43:51] reveal. The very revelation itself is
[1:43:53] sovereign in God. That's how people
[1:43:55] pound at things and jump at things and
[1:43:57] hit at things not knowing what they're
[1:43:59] doing. God is sovereign in his works.
[1:44:00] Listen to me, church. We don't have to
[1:44:02] reinvent the wheel. God does what he
[1:44:04] wants to. God is in the heavens. He has
[1:44:06] done h what he pleased.
[1:44:08] I don't have to make it say something it
[1:44:10] doesn't say. God is in the heavens.
[1:44:14] He'll take care of the message.
[1:44:16] Are you with me now?
[1:44:18] He'll take care of the message. We come
[1:44:21] boldly before the throne of this great
[1:44:22] God, but we come reverently, not telling
[1:44:26] him what he will do, but acknowledging
[1:44:28] the truth of his word, reminding him of
[1:44:30] his promises and worshiping him in
[1:44:32] spirit and in truth.
[1:44:35] Ecclesiastes 5 1-8 tells us, and I'm
[1:44:38] just going to read the first two verses,
[1:44:40] then we'll skip down, brother Robert,
[1:44:41] because I don't have time. I've run out
[1:44:42] of time. But he said, "Keep thy foot
[1:44:44] when thou goest to the house of God. Be
[1:44:46] more ready to hear than to give the
[1:44:47] sacrifice of fools, for they consider
[1:44:50] not that they do evil. Be not rash with
[1:44:52] thy mouth. Let not thine heart be hasty
[1:44:55] to utter anything before God, for God is
[1:44:58] in heaven and thou upon earth.
[1:45:01] Therefore, let thy words be few. In
[1:45:02] other words, don't be making a bunch of
[1:45:04] promises that you can't keep. And he
[1:45:06] addresses dreams in there. He talks
[1:45:08] about how we have imaginations and
[1:45:10] dreams and we want to we want to promise
[1:45:12] God all kinds of things, but just stay
[1:45:14] with the word. You don't have to make
[1:45:15] anything up. Just stay with the word.
[1:45:17] God is in the heavens.
[1:45:19] He said, "Let your word be few."
[1:45:21] Hallelujah. See, we don't have to
[1:45:23] imagine he will save us. He's already
[1:45:26] done it.
[1:45:27] How many believe that today? We don't
[1:45:29] have to imagine he will heal us. We have
[1:45:31] his word for it.
[1:45:32] Our God is in the heavens if we believe
[1:45:34] that. Listen. Why do we worry so much?
[1:45:38] Now, I'm just going to hit this for a
[1:45:40] few minutes, then we'll close. Why do we
[1:45:42] worry so much? Matthew 6 and again I'm I
[1:45:46] I won't read but just the first verse
[1:45:47] here he said therefore verse 25
[1:45:49] therefore I say you take no thought for
[1:45:51] your life what you shall eat what you
[1:45:54] shall drink nor yet for your body what
[1:45:56] you shall put on is not the life more
[1:45:57] than meat the body than raignment that
[1:45:59] word thought is no anxious thought take
[1:46:02] no anxious thought it's not that you
[1:46:03] shouldn't think about it but don't worry
[1:46:05] about it verse 32 says for after all
[1:46:08] these things do the Gentiles seek for
[1:46:10] your heavenly father knows that you have
[1:46:11] need of all these things but seek ye
[1:46:13] First the kingdom of God and his
[1:46:15] righteousness and all these things.
[1:46:16] Someone say all.
[1:46:18] All these things shall be added unto
[1:46:20] you.
[1:46:21] Yes.
[1:46:22] Brother Brandon said, "I may." He said,
[1:46:23] "I'm going to explain to you that all
[1:46:24] sin and sickness was settled." Again,
[1:46:27] someone say, "All
[1:46:29] all sin and sickness was settled." Glory
[1:46:31] to God. When God dealt with it at
[1:46:33] Calvary 1900 years ago, when his son
[1:46:36] died to save us from sin and sickness,
[1:46:37] he was wounded for our transgression.
[1:46:39] With his stripes, we were healed. He
[1:46:41] said, "I don't know. I don't mean that
[1:46:42] he made one atonement for your sickness
[1:46:44] and one for your sins. He made one
[1:46:45] atonement and that was for sin. When you
[1:46:47] deal with sin, you got to deal with
[1:46:49] every attribute of sin. Sickness was
[1:46:50] issued in as an attribute of sin which
[1:46:52] had to bring death. Sin is death.
[1:46:54] Sickness follows sins. Worry follows
[1:46:57] sin.
[1:47:02] I'm trying to teach my children. Maybe I
[1:47:04] haven't done as good a job. Maybe
[1:47:05] because they watched me worry too much.
[1:47:09] But worry is an attribute of sin.
[1:47:13] There is, you said, did you ever notice
[1:47:15] what a horrible thing worry is?
[1:47:18] There's not one value in it at all.
[1:47:23] So what worry does, but Landon, worry
[1:47:25] makes us act as if God is not in the
[1:47:28] heavens,
[1:47:31] it causes us to behave as if he is not
[1:47:34] the most high God,
[1:47:36] as if he does not have everything in
[1:47:38] control.
[1:47:39] Worry is an attribute of sin. There's
[1:47:41] not one value in it at all. He was
[1:47:43] telling that he said speaking that in a
[1:47:44] club he said if you was going to be
[1:47:46] killed in the morning a club in the city
[1:47:48] he said if you were going to be killed
[1:47:49] in the morning I said worry would not
[1:47:50] help you one bit. I seen one man kind of
[1:47:53] look down kind of laugh. He said well
[1:47:54] what would faith do? I said sign your
[1:47:56] pardon.
[1:47:58] That's right. Worry there's no value in
[1:47:59] it. So just get away from worry and have
[1:48:02] faith. Can we do that this morning? Get
[1:48:03] away from worry and have faith. You
[1:48:06] worried about it long enough. Give it to
[1:48:07] him. Let him have it.
[1:48:12] What do you worry about this morning?
[1:48:13] Are you worried about your health? I
[1:48:15] know we can worry about that sometimes,
[1:48:17] but he made one atonement for all sin
[1:48:18] and all sickness.
[1:48:20] Are you worried about your health? He
[1:48:21] said, "He forgives all thine iniquities.
[1:48:23] He heals all thy diseases."
[1:48:26] Brother Brandon tells the lady this. He
[1:48:27] said, "How do you do, lady? Do you
[1:48:28] believe with all your heart? Been full
[1:48:29] of sorrow, haven't you? You're real
[1:48:31] nervous, broke down, you just lost
[1:48:33] someone, your husband. That's right.
[1:48:34] Don't worry.
[1:48:36] It's hard not to worry when you become a
[1:48:38] widow suddenly.
[1:48:40] Some of you know what I'm talking about.
[1:48:42] But don't worry, God's with you.
[1:48:47] Hallelujah.
[1:48:48] He promised to be a sustainer for you.
[1:48:52] You said, "Well, where did he promise
[1:48:53] that?" In the scripture, when Elijah,
[1:48:55] when the messenger come to the house of
[1:48:56] the woman who was there with not
[1:48:58] anything left, but just enough to make
[1:49:00] enough food for one day, what happened?
[1:49:02] The oil never run out. The meal never
[1:49:04] run out because she obeyed the word of a
[1:49:06] prophet. If you'll believe the message
[1:49:08] of the hour today, you don't have to
[1:49:10] worry. He said, "Your real nervous broke
[1:49:12] down. You just lost someone, your
[1:49:13] husband." He said, "Don't worry. God's
[1:49:16] with you. He promised to be a sustainer
[1:49:17] for you. Don't be nervous. He holds
[1:49:19] everything in his hand, Sister Dear. He
[1:49:21] loves you and he will bless you. I'm
[1:49:24] sure." I wonder if we can take that for
[1:49:25] ourselves this morning.
[1:49:29] He speaks to another man said, "If you
[1:49:31] won't worry, sir."
[1:49:34] Well, that's a big if, isn't it?
[1:49:37] If you won't worry, sir, sitting there
[1:49:40] at the end of the row, if you'll believe
[1:49:43] with all your heart, God will heal you
[1:49:46] of that heart trouble that you're so
[1:49:49] concerned about.
[1:49:56] You realize
[1:49:58] the woman with the issue of blood, I'm
[1:49:59] sure she worried about it. She stressed
[1:50:00] about it, but worry never did her any
[1:50:03] good. God had an appointed time
[1:50:07] that Jesus was going to pass by.
[1:50:09] When when he came by, she pressed
[1:50:11] through the cl crowd. She didn't worry.
[1:50:14] She said, "If I can touch the hem of his
[1:50:16] garment, I've worried long enough. I've
[1:50:18] been to every kind of doctor there is
[1:50:20] known to man, and they couldn't do
[1:50:21] nothing for me. I've worried long
[1:50:23] enough. Let me touch the hymn of his
[1:50:25] garment, and I'll be made whole."
[1:50:28] She presses her way through the crowd,
[1:50:30] touches the hem of his garment, turns
[1:50:31] around and and Jesus feels virtue,
[1:50:33] strength draining from him. And he turns
[1:50:35] around and said, "Who touched me?" And
[1:50:37] he saw her in the crowd. And and he and
[1:50:39] he told her, "You're healed. Your hope
[1:50:41] this very hour. What was it? What did
[1:50:43] that quit worrying?" And reached the
[1:50:45] hymn of his garment. You need to quit
[1:50:47] worrying this morning. I need to quit
[1:50:49] worrying. And we need to touch the hymn
[1:50:50] of his garment. Amen.
[1:50:55] We let worry keep us out of church
[1:50:59] when we ought to be seeking his presence
[1:51:02] for our needs.
[1:51:04] Finances sometimes we worry about that,
[1:51:06] don't we?
[1:51:08] Trust me, I've been right there with
[1:51:10] you.
[1:51:11] Psalm 50:10 says, "Every beast of the
[1:51:13] forest is mine." Think about that next
[1:51:16] time you go hunting.
[1:51:20] Well, they're all yours, Lord. Could you
[1:51:21] send a great big one down here? You
[1:51:23] know, he said, "They're all his."
[1:51:29] Every time that big buck walks by, he
[1:51:30] said, "That one's mine." No, they belong
[1:51:32] to God. He gave it to you.
[1:51:36] Amen.
[1:51:37] Hallelujah. Every beast of the forest is
[1:51:40] mine, and the cattle upon a thousand
[1:51:43] hills. I'd like to have one cow.
[1:51:46] Cherokee Village won't let me have it.
[1:51:50] love to have one cow, but I know I have
[1:51:53] a father. Elleon, the most high God,
[1:51:57] Elohim, who created the heavens and the
[1:52:00] earth. My God is the owns the cattle
[1:52:03] upon a thousand hills.
[1:52:06] God sees your finances. Don't worry, go
[1:52:09] to work.
[1:52:11] That sounds strange, doesn't it? But
[1:52:12] worry will keep you from work because
[1:52:15] you're stressed out about it. Don't
[1:52:16] worry, go to work. You said, "Why would
[1:52:18] you say that? That don't seem like you
[1:52:19] shouldn't work. You should just wait for
[1:52:21] God to provide." But God has provided in
[1:52:23] the scripture. He's told you to go to
[1:52:25] work and you'll get wealthy.
[1:52:27] That's what God said. Proverbs 13:11,
[1:52:29] "Wealth gotten by vanity shall be
[1:52:31] diminished. But he that gatherth by
[1:52:33] labor shall increase."
[1:52:35] 2 Chronicles 15:7. Take this. You you
[1:52:38] men that are working. I I've taken the
[1:52:40] scripture for myself. Be strong,
[1:52:42] therefore. Let not your hands be weak,
[1:52:44] for your work shall be rewarded.
[1:52:49] What do you worry about children?
[1:52:52] I worry at times about my children, but
[1:52:54] I shouldn't. Do you know that we
[1:52:57] shouldn't worry about our children?
[1:52:59] Because the Bible, we have a promise
[1:53:01] where they tell he said, "What can I do?
[1:53:02] How do how do I achieve salvation?" They
[1:53:05] said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:06] and thou shalt be saved and thy house."
[1:53:10] Paul told the Roman centurion to believe
[1:53:12] thou and all the house shall be saved.
[1:53:13] Apply it to your family. He said if you
[1:53:15] got an Now he said they have to get
[1:53:16] saved themselves.
[1:53:18] That's important. You can't save them.
[1:53:21] Believing for them is not is not you
[1:53:23] saving them. You just believe it's going
[1:53:25] to happen.
[1:53:27] God does the work.
[1:53:29] But you claim it. You act as if it's
[1:53:30] already done. He said apply it to your
[1:53:32] family. If you got an unsaved child, lay
[1:53:34] the token right on top of him. Lord God,
[1:53:37] I claim it. I don't believe we have to
[1:53:38] take our Bibles and lay it on top of him
[1:53:40] or a book. Listen, or a tape. If the
[1:53:42] token was just literally the token tape,
[1:53:44] you'd have to lay that on somebody's
[1:53:46] head. That's not what he's talking
[1:53:47] about. The token, he said, is the
[1:53:48] literal life of Jesus Christ. It is the
[1:53:51] word of God.
[1:53:52] We don't lay tapes and books on people's
[1:53:54] heads. We lay the token over their head,
[1:53:56] the Holy Spirit. And right on top of
[1:53:58] them, say, "Lord God, I claim him." Stay
[1:54:00] right there. If you got a mother or
[1:54:02] loved one that's lost, come on. How many
[1:54:04] got someone that you're praying for? If
[1:54:05] you got a mother or loved one that's
[1:54:07] lost, lay that token on them and say,
[1:54:09] "Lord God, I claim it." Can we do it
[1:54:11] this morning? Don't worry, apply the
[1:54:13] token
[1:54:15] with confidence.
[1:54:17] The problem comes when we try to do it
[1:54:18] ourselves.
[1:54:21] Look at Elezer in the Bible. Remember
[1:54:23] Elazer was Abraham's trusted servant.
[1:54:26] And he goes down to find Rebecca. When
[1:54:28] he goes down to find Rebecca, what does
[1:54:30] he do? He he he gets down on his knees.
[1:54:33] As soon as he gets there, he said,
[1:54:35] "Lord, I've come a long way and I'm
[1:54:38] committing this to you.
[1:54:42] I I don't want it to be my choice. I
[1:54:43] want it to be your choice, Lord. Oh,
[1:54:46] we'd worry a lot less if we could commit
[1:54:47] things to God.
[1:54:48] Brother Brandon said, "Oh, if we could
[1:54:50] only learn to be a trusted servant of
[1:54:52] God like that, we could commit things to
[1:54:54] God." He said, "It's the most powerful
[1:54:56] thing that I know of is a committ.
[1:55:00] Commit thy ways unto the Lord. Commit
[1:55:02] your thinking to him. If you're sick and
[1:55:04] the doctors can't help you no tomorrow,
[1:55:06] just commit your case to God. Act like
[1:55:08] it's already done. Something will have
[1:55:10] to take place. They just can't keep from
[1:55:11] it because God is a creator.
[1:55:14] Jesus said the word we want to control
[1:55:15] all the outcomes. We can't control
[1:55:17] outcomes.
[1:55:18] God controls the outcomes. All we do is
[1:55:21] put in the work.
[1:55:23] Listen, an an actor in a play, he plays
[1:55:26] a part.
[1:55:27] He don't play the whole.
[1:55:29] This isn't a one-man band.
[1:55:31] I play a part. I just got to come out
[1:55:33] and do my part.
[1:55:35] Go behind the curtain. God is the
[1:55:37] director. Yeah.
[1:55:38] He's the one who makes everything work
[1:55:39] together.
[1:55:40] All I'm doing is my part. If all I got
[1:55:42] is just one line, let me say my line.
[1:55:44] Let me do my job. Let me sweep the
[1:55:46] floor. Let me preach the word. Whatever
[1:55:48] it is he's called me to do, let me do my
[1:55:50] part.
[1:55:51] Let me be a If you're a mother, a
[1:55:53] mother, a father, whatever it is, let me
[1:55:55] play my part. God's got the big picture.
[1:55:59] He's the director.
[1:56:03] You know, if you heard if you got a
[1:56:04] great symphony and you heard one violin
[1:56:06] playing by itself, wouldn't sound very
[1:56:07] good because it's not playing the whole,
[1:56:10] it's playing a part.
[1:56:13] You imagine just a trombone, you know,
[1:56:16] playing by itself, a bass drum playing
[1:56:18] by itself. But when you put it all
[1:56:21] together, it's not my responsibility to
[1:56:24] put it together. It's my responsibility
[1:56:25] to look at the sheet music and play my
[1:56:27] part.
[1:56:28] Listen,
[1:56:31] brother said Jesus was said the word was
[1:56:33] a seed. The seed has fallen into your
[1:56:34] heart. You water that seed by faith
[1:56:36] believing it'll bring forth after its
[1:56:37] kind. He said you can put me on record
[1:56:39] after 30 years of preaching. I can say
[1:56:41] this that I have never one time
[1:56:43] sincerely ever asked God for anything
[1:56:45] and committed it to him. He either gave
[1:56:47] it to me or told me why he couldn't do
[1:56:49] it. He would he couldn't do it. He said
[1:56:51] if you'll take the right mental attitude
[1:56:52] towards any. Someone say any. Divine
[1:56:54] promise God has made it'll bring it to
[1:56:56] pass. If you'll just simply say, "It's
[1:56:59] God's word. It's not for me to try to
[1:57:02] figure it out." That's God's business.
[1:57:05] Come on, church. You want somebody to
[1:57:06] fix everything. You want somebody to
[1:57:08] have all the answers. It's not for me to
[1:57:10] figure it out. It's God's business.
[1:57:13] But he's still the most high God.
[1:57:15] He spoke it. And that's if you find
[1:57:17] somebody that's got all the answers,
[1:57:18] it's a gimmick.
[1:57:19] They'll convince you to move to their
[1:57:21] church or go to their place and be under
[1:57:23] their ministry. And it's just a gimmick.
[1:57:25] They have all the answers. Cuz if they
[1:57:26] can tell you what house to move into and
[1:57:28] what car to buy, it's a gimmick. Come
[1:57:30] on, church. That's not the word of God.
[1:57:32] The word of God says what? No matter
[1:57:34] what house you buy, you let be led by
[1:57:36] the spirit. No matter what car you buy,
[1:57:37] you be led by the spirit. Let God come
[1:57:40] down and do his work in your life and
[1:57:42] know that he's in control. Even if you
[1:57:44] buy a lemon,
[1:57:48] are you with me now?
[1:57:51] Pastors aren't God.
[1:57:55] I want you to really get a revelation of
[1:57:57] that.
[1:57:59] And I put decrease the pressure a whole
[1:58:00] lot on me.
[1:58:05] Say he spoke it. That's all that's
[1:58:06] necessary. Something will take place.
[1:58:08] Don't go painting on God's masterpiece.
[1:58:14] You see that, brother Josh? I I see
[1:58:16] that. Or we try to reshape it. Just make
[1:58:18] it what we want it to be. And we want
[1:58:19] this to be right and that to be right.
[1:58:21] And that's good. We want to be right.
[1:58:23] We're creators. We have a desire in as
[1:58:25] us to
[1:58:26] but don't go painting on God's
[1:58:28] masterpiece. You imagine someone take
[1:58:30] the mo the Mona Lisa
[1:58:33] some little painter that may puts their
[1:58:35] little artwork down here in Hardy. I
[1:58:37] don't think the Mona Lisa is right. I
[1:58:38] think I'm going to go and now they
[1:58:41] probably do good in Hardy. I'm sorry if
[1:58:42] I if someone here paints in Hardy. I
[1:58:44] apologize. I didn't know that.
[1:58:46] But but if you have a you know someone
[1:58:50] that just paints a little picture and
[1:58:51] you go up to the museum there in France,
[1:58:53] you go up and said, "Give it to me. Let
[1:58:55] me take it." It's already a masterpiece.
[1:58:59] Why would you want to change it?
[1:59:03] And you find out just a little nuance
[1:59:06] would change it, make it something it
[1:59:07] wasn't. I don't want to change the word.
[1:59:10] Let it change me.
[1:59:13] Let me look at the masterpiece until it
[1:59:15] changes me. I I I can't control every
[1:59:18] area of my life, but I believe my family
[1:59:20] is a masterpiece of God.
[1:59:22] Huh? Listen to me, church. We We can't
[1:59:25] If we We're going to go crazy if we're
[1:59:26] trying to control every I'm not saying
[1:59:28] we shouldn't try to help and we should
[1:59:30] we should give every effort we can give.
[1:59:32] But remember, at the end of the day,
[1:59:34] when we've done everything we can do,
[1:59:35] remember, he's still God.
[1:59:40] Let him finish the work.
[1:59:43] We don't take it away from him right
[1:59:44] here at the end of time and say, "Let me
[1:59:46] finish it, Lord." He can finish it. And
[1:59:49] what we see as a flaw may be the
[1:59:51] masterpiece itself. If you've heard
[1:59:53] brother Brandham's sermon on that,
[1:59:56] brother Brandham talked about Paul Rider
[1:59:57] and how he had a dream one time. He said
[1:59:59] he was in South America in missionary
[2:00:01] work. He got very sick. He had a dream.
[2:00:04] In the dream, he said he was back
[2:00:06] logging again. And his boss told him
[2:00:08] said, "Go up on that mountain and get
[2:00:09] the by that river." He said, "Go get
[2:00:11] this log." He said, "and and bring it
[2:00:13] back to me." So he goes up there and he
[2:00:15] said, "I can just see the axe hitting
[2:00:17] the tree and that soft wood." He said he
[2:00:19] got it down, knocked it down, cut it
[2:00:21] down, and he said, "I went to pick it
[2:00:23] up." He said, he was a stout man, but he
[2:00:24] couldn't pick it up. He said he tried.
[2:00:27] He couldn't he couldn't even hardly move
[2:00:29] it. And he said, "There's no way I can
[2:00:30] get it all the way down the mountain. I
[2:00:31] can't I can't roll it. There's other
[2:00:33] trees. There's no way to get it out.
[2:00:35] What am I going to do?"
[2:00:39] He said all at once he heard his boss's
[2:00:41] voice. He said but it was the sweetest
[2:00:42] voice he'd ever heard.
[2:00:45] He said he said don't don't trust don't
[2:00:49] struggle with it. Write on it.
[2:00:53] He said he saw the river and he
[2:00:54] understood that he should throw the log
[2:00:56] in the river and write it down.
[2:01:00] Hallelujah. Then he turned to look and
[2:01:02] it was Jesus. It was the voice of Jesus.
[2:01:05] Now look what did he do? He said don't
[2:01:06] struggle with it. Write on it. And he
[2:01:08] wrote it all the way down screaming in
[2:01:10] the dream. And he woke up screaming,
[2:01:11] "I'm riding on it. I'm riding on it."
[2:01:13] Brother Brandham said, "Why would you
[2:01:15] tugle with your load of sin?" Why would
[2:01:17] you be in the condition be the condition
[2:01:18] you are? He said, "Don't know where
[2:01:20] you're standing running from church to
[2:01:21] church, from place to place. Why don't
[2:01:23] you just pitch it in on the cross
[2:01:24] tonight, right on the word? Why don't
[2:01:27] you just take God's promise? Can we do
[2:01:28] that this morning? Why don't you take
[2:01:30] God's promise right out on out of the
[2:01:32] mess on out into the big blue open like
[2:01:34] that? Don't tussle with it. Don't worry
[2:01:37] with it. Just believe it. Accept it.
[2:01:39] It's a kingdom that cannot be moved
[2:01:40] right on it. If you're sick, take God's
[2:01:42] promise. I'm the Lord that heals all
[2:01:44] your thy diseases. How am I going to get
[2:01:46] well? The doctor says, "I got heart
[2:01:48] trouble. I'm deaf, dumb, blind, cancer,
[2:01:49] whatever." What difference does that
[2:01:50] make? Just accept God's promise and ride
[2:01:52] on it. Let's take a great big stick. Oh,
[2:01:54] come on, church. Let's do this this
[2:01:55] morning. Let's take a great big stick.
[2:01:57] Musicians, go ahead and come. I'm
[2:01:58] closing. Let's take a great big stick
[2:02:00] and drive it down here. Right on the top
[2:02:02] of it. The prayer of faith has been
[2:02:04] prayed tonight. I'm going to ride on it.
[2:02:05] Amen.
[2:02:07] When I read that, I thought of something
[2:02:08] I hadn't thought of before. You know
[2:02:09] what we did with sticks?
[2:02:12] We took a stick and put it at the front
[2:02:13] at the beginning of a row.
[2:02:18] Y'all know where I'm going. Took a stick
[2:02:20] and put it at the beginning of a row
[2:02:22] where we had planted a seed.
[2:02:28] And and we put a date on it and a piece
[2:02:31] of paper or maybe the package it came
[2:02:33] from. and you put that upside down on a
[2:02:35] stick and you write on it and say
[2:02:37] there's corn here.
[2:02:39] I planted corn on this date.
[2:02:43] So even if I don't see it, I know I
[2:02:46] planted corn.
[2:02:47] Even if I can't understand it, even if I
[2:02:51] come on church, we didn't go dig it up
[2:02:52] every day, see if it was still there.
[2:02:54] That would have prevented the growth.
[2:02:56] But what did we do, brother JT? We took
[2:02:58] the corn, we planted in the ground, and
[2:03:00] we put a steak down. put a sign on it
[2:03:03] and said, "Hey, today I planted a seed."
[2:03:07] And I know it takes time for a seed to
[2:03:09] grow, but eventually that seed
[2:03:14] is going to grow into what it was on the
[2:03:16] package in the beginning. Eventually
[2:03:19] that seed is going to make it. I trust
[2:03:23] the quality of the seed and the
[2:03:26] atmosphere that it was in to grow into
[2:03:28] Oh, come on, church. Listen, don't worry
[2:03:30] about your children. trust the quality
[2:03:32] of the seed and the atmosphere that
[2:03:34] they're growing in to bring them up in
[2:03:36] the right way.
[2:03:39] We think we got to fix everything. Let's
[2:03:41] give it to him. If you've done wrong, if
[2:03:43] you're wayward, he said, "He that covers
[2:03:45] his sin shall not prosper, but he that
[2:03:47] will confess his sin shall have mercy."
[2:03:49] Why not confess it? What must I do,
[2:03:51] brother Brandham? Confess it, then write
[2:03:53] on it. God said so. It'll take you right
[2:03:55] away from your sin. Said, take that
[2:03:58] stick and write on the top of it. Prayer
[2:03:59] of faith has been prayed tonight. I'm
[2:04:02] going to ride on it. Let's stand
[2:04:04] together.
[2:04:06] Hallelujah.
[2:04:09] Oh God, you imagine if we could do that
[2:04:12] this morning.
[2:04:13] The prayer of faith has been prayed.
[2:04:16] Let me ride on it.
[2:04:20] Let me take my worries and my struggles
[2:04:22] and the job he's given me and cast it
[2:04:24] into the waters of life.
[2:04:26] Let me ride it all the way home.
[2:04:29] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] Let's sing this together.
[2:04:35] I give I give you glory.
[2:04:38] Oh, can we sing it now? Because of who
[2:04:39] you are.
[2:04:40] Because of who you are, I give you
[2:04:45] praise.
[2:04:46] Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:48] because of who you are.
[2:04:52] I will lift my voice and say,
[2:04:56] "Lord, I worship you because of who you
[2:05:00] are."
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:03] Oh yes, I worship you. We do that this
[2:05:06] morning. We're going to have prayer in a
[2:05:08] moment, but let's just worship him with
[2:05:10] all of our heart. Let's tell him
[2:05:11] hallelujah.
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:14] Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] my proider.
[2:05:20] Oh Jehovah.
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:23] Oh yes, you reign in victory.
[2:05:28] Jehovah shalu.
[2:05:32] Oh you're my prince of peace
[2:05:37] and I worship you because of who you
[2:05:41] are.
[2:05:44] Oh yes, I worship you because of who you
[2:05:50] are.
[2:05:50] We bow our heads for just a moment
[2:05:53] before we sing it again. Every head
[2:05:55] bowed and every eye closed. If you need
[2:05:57] prayer, the altar is open. I make time
[2:06:00] try to make time every service for you
[2:06:03] to come. Throw your worries, throw your
[2:06:05] cares
[2:06:06] on him.
[2:06:09] I believe he's here. I believe that
[2:06:12] pillar of fire
[2:06:14] was where the prophet of God is right
[2:06:16] here. It's not cuz you're here in the
[2:06:18] band. It's not cuz I'm here. It's
[2:06:19] because God's here.
[2:06:21] The most high God dwells in his people.
[2:06:24] If you're worried this morning, would
[2:06:25] you cast your worries on him? If you've
[2:06:28] been trying to do it yourself and making
[2:06:29] a mess of it, would you just come and
[2:06:32] cast your worries on him this morning? I
[2:06:34] just have a season of prayer about it. I
[2:06:37] I I want because of who you are, Lord. I
[2:06:39] want to worship you. I don't want to let
[2:06:42] anything get in my way of of worshiping
[2:06:44] you, calling out to you. Could you do
[2:06:46] that today?
[2:06:48] It may be right there where you're at.
[2:06:50] You can just say, "Lord,
[2:06:52] Lord, I I want to treat you as if you're
[2:06:54] God.
[2:06:56] I don't worry in my mind. Though you're
[2:06:59] always on the throne, but it obscures
[2:07:02] that the fact that you are God. Lord,
[2:07:04] help me not to worry. Help me not to be
[2:07:07] afraid. Help me to trust you, Lord. Help
[2:07:11] me to love you so much that I believe
[2:07:13] whatever you do, it'll be for my good.
[2:07:15] Could you do that today? God bless those
[2:07:17] hands. God bless you. You're welcome to
[2:07:19] come and pray if you want to pray.
[2:07:21] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father. Lord Jesus,
[2:07:24] you said the prayer of faith shall save
[2:07:26] the sick. The Lord shall raise him up.
[2:07:28] And if he committed any sins, they'll be
[2:07:30] forgiven him. I pray it would be a soul,
[2:07:32] Lord, in this building. Lord, I pray
[2:07:34] that you would move right now. Oh, God.
[2:07:37] I pray that you'd make the darkness
[2:07:39] light before your people. I pray you'd
[2:07:41] remove the worry, Lord. Remove the fear
[2:07:44] that Satan is trying in this hour to
[2:07:46] make people afraid. If I don't follow
[2:07:47] this, if I don't do this, if I don't if
[2:07:49] I don't do this certain thing, I won't
[2:07:51] be. Oh, God. Help us today. Help us not
[2:07:53] to fear, but to trust you, Lord, to know
[2:07:56] that that you've revealed yourself in
[2:07:58] this hour as the most high God. I pray
[2:08:01] you grant it today. Lord Jesus, I pray
[2:08:03] if there's one here that doesn't know
[2:08:05] you, maybe in the power of salvation or
[2:08:07] the power of s of sanctified life, in
[2:08:10] the power of the Holy Ghost, I pray
[2:08:11] they'd receive you right now. Lord, I
[2:08:13] pray if there's one in need of healing
[2:08:15] today that you'd heal them. Lord, I pray
[2:08:17] you'd help us, protect us, keep us,
[2:08:19] Lord. Let our words be few in your
[2:08:21] presence, but our praise be great. Oh
[2:08:23] God, I pray you'd grant it, Lord. We
[2:08:26] will not boast. We will not we will not
[2:08:28] imagine. We will we will repeat back the
[2:08:30] words of God. I believe I'm saved. I
[2:08:33] believe I'm healed. I believe I'm going
[2:08:34] to make it. I pray you grant it, Lord.
[2:08:36] Bless these people now. We ask in Jesus
[2:08:39] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just
[2:08:42] worship him now. If you need to pray,
[2:08:44] you're welcome to come. Hallelujah.

[2:08:53] Hallelujah. Oh my prince of peace.
