[0:27] Heat. Heat.
[1:15] At last I lay down.
[1:21] Yes, I will cling
[1:25] to the old rugged
[1:28] cross
[1:33] and exchange
[1:35] it someday
[1:37] for a crown. Sing the course again now.
[1:42] Oh, so I'll cherish
[1:47] the old rug
[1:49] and cross
[1:54] until my trophies
[1:57] at last I lay down.

[2:37] And when the music fades
[2:41] and all is stripped away
[2:44] and I simply come
[2:51] longing just to breathe
[2:56] something that's worth
[2:59] that will bless your heart.
[3:05] I'll bring you more than a song.
[3:10] For a song in itself is not what you
[3:14] have required.
[3:19] You search much deeper within.
[3:24] Through the way things appear, you're
[3:27] looking into my heart.
[3:33] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[3:39] where it's all about you.
[3:43] Yes, it's all about you, Jesus.

[4:04] Yes, he is.
[4:09] King of endless worth,
[4:13] no one could express
[4:16] how much you deserve.
[4:23] And though I'm weak and poor,
[4:27] all I have is yours.
[4:30] Every single breath
[4:37] I'll bring you more than a song.
[4:41] For a song in itself is not what you
[4:45] have required.
[4:51] You search much deeper within
[4:55] through the way things appear. You're
[4:58] looking into my heart
[5:04] and I'm coming back to the heart of
[5:09] worship
[5:10] where it's all about you. I know that
[5:14] it's all about you, Jesus.
[5:18] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[5:23] it. But it's all about you.

[5:36] worship.

[5:46] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[5:51] it. When it's all about you.

[26:45] is dry.
[26:50] There's no stars in
[26:53] the sky.
[26:58] And the sparrow

[28:21] a love
[28:26] the ocean
[28:29] is dry.

[29:17] love, y'all sing it with me. If that is
[29:22] alone,

[33:04] Take away my healing. There ain't no
[33:06] devil.
[33:09] Someone got started.
[33:16] There ain't no devil
[33:20] take away my joy. There ain't no devil
[33:25] robb me of my peace. There ain't no
[33:28] devil.
[33:31] He's going to keep my family. Ain't no
[33:34] devil
[33:37] take my victory.
[33:40] There ain't no devil.
[33:44] may return
[33:46] right now.
[33:50] Tell me God is there.
[33:56] It's going to keep my family on.
[34:04] There ain't nothing.
[34:09] learnable.
[34:13] It's not what got us started.
[34:26] Amen. If that don't light your fire,
[34:28] your wood's wet. Amen. Wasn't that good?
[34:31] Amen. Give the Lord another hand. He's
[34:33] worthy of it this morning. Let's stand
[34:34] together.
[34:36] Amen. Are you Are you ready for the word
[34:38] of the Lord this morning? Amen. I tell
[34:40] you what, uh we've heard about how he
[34:42] left the splendor of heaven and you
[34:44] know, he showed his love to us and I'll
[34:46] guarantee you there's no greater love
[34:49] than this. That one would lay down his
[34:50] life for his friends. Aren't you
[34:51] thankful that he did it? Nobody else
[34:54] died for me but Jesus. And so we're here
[34:55] to worship Jesus this morning. That's
[34:58] that's it's what it's all about. It's
[35:00] what it's all about. Amen. Aren't you
[35:01] thankful? The prophet stood and
[35:02] declared. He said he said, "I am here."
[35:05] He said, "My ministry is here to declare
[35:07] that he is here. And if he's here this
[35:11] morning, I don't care what sickness
[35:12] you've got on you. It can be it can be
[35:14] healed right here this morning." It was
[35:16] already healed, but it's time we claim
[35:18] our healing this morning. It's time we
[35:19] go ahead and just take our victory. You
[35:21] say, "Well, the walls hadn't fell down
[35:23] yet." Well, I'll tell you what. Just go
[35:24] ahead and march around them walls and
[35:25] start shouting anyway and just watch the
[35:27] walls start falling. I believe this
[35:29] morning we could just have a good time
[35:31] in the Lord. Amen. Just pull on the gift
[35:34] of God. Ain't going to hurt nobody to
[35:36] say amen. Going to hurt nobody to raise
[35:39] your hand and just I tell you what, a
[35:41] preacher, it's a hard it's a hard job to
[35:42] preach the message of the hour with
[35:44] people staring at you. But if you just
[35:47] pull on the gift of God, operate the
[35:49] gift, you know, you have to operate the
[35:50] gift in the pulpit. You can't leave a
[35:52] service and say, "Well, that preacher
[35:54] failed me today." No, it's all on you
[35:55] right now. If you operate that gift,
[35:57] watch the I know the brother's been in
[35:59] his study. I know the word's going to be
[36:00] preached. Let's pull on the gift of God.
[36:03] Amen. That brother Josh loves the
[36:04] message with all of his heart. Amen. His
[36:06] family means a lot to us here at the
[36:08] church. I know his dad, Brother Wendell,
[36:09] is is a real uh real blessing to us
[36:11] during our meetings. And and uh and we
[36:14] just love Brother Josh Martin. So, he's
[36:16] going to come and he's going to come and
[36:17] preach for us or sing whatever he wants
[36:19] to do. Amen. Let's just open our hearts
[36:21] to receive this morning and just pull on
[36:22] the gift. You going to do that this
[36:24] morning? Somebody say, "Praise the
[36:25] Lord." Let's sing this with all of our
[36:27] hearts as you come now. Holy me.
[36:31] Every day I see
[36:36] he's helping me faithfully
[36:39] to overcome my trials.
[36:44] And he's guiding me constantly,
[36:49] giving me victory.
[36:53] He's a reality
[36:56] cuz Jesus is holding
[36:59] me.
[37:01] Oh, I know something keeps holding me
[37:07] every day. My
[37:16] all my trust
[37:21] constantly,
[37:24] giving me victory.
[37:28] He's a reality.
[37:31] And Jesus is holding me. One more time
[37:34] now.
[37:36] Oh, something keeps holding me.
[37:48] Overcome
[37:51] my tri
[37:54] guiding me constantly.
[37:58] Giving me victory.
[38:06] holding me.
[38:11] Amen. I trust that's your your
[38:12] confession this morning that something
[38:15] is holding me. And it's incredible the
[38:18] grace of God that it's a keeping power
[38:21] as brother Brandham would tell that the
[38:23] testimony of how when he lost his wife
[38:25] and his daughter and somebody would ask
[38:28] him, "Do you still what do you think
[38:29] about your God now?"
[38:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I think of him the same.
[38:33] He's still faithful. And the critic
[38:35] would say to him, "Oh, you kept your
[38:37] religion, huh?" He says, "No, my
[38:39] religion kept me."
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And it's incredible that the keeping
[38:42] power of God ain't just there when
[38:45] you're on the mountaintop, but it's when
[38:47] you're in the valley. In the times of
[38:49] decision, the grace of God is there. The
[38:51] time of discouragement, the time of
[38:53] victory, it don't matter what season
[38:55] you're in, the grace of God is still
[38:57] going to remain. And it's a keeping
[39:00] power over our lives. Are you thankful
[39:02] for that? out this morning. Amen. Well,
[39:04] it's good to be with y'all here today. I
[39:06] count it an honor and a privilege to be
[39:08] here. I I appreciate the invitation by
[39:11] brother Ben to to come and minister as
[39:15] it's been said before, but it's always
[39:17] uh uh an honor to come and minister when
[39:20] the pastor is there, but when he has
[39:22] confidence in you when you're when he's
[39:23] away to invite you to come, that's
[39:25] always a something a minister don't take
[39:27] for granted. So I pray something can be
[39:30] said this morning to to be a blessing.
[39:32] But first Peter 1 and1 and we'll read
[39:35] that down to the second verse. Then
[39:37] Galatians 3 and 28. I bring greetings
[39:41] from my my pastor brother Wenda Martin
[39:43] and the saints there new life outreach
[39:46] there in Pawne. They they send their
[39:48] greetings and we sure love the church
[39:50] here and and your pastor and and brother
[39:52] Joel and all of the the workers here. We
[39:55] we sure love and appreciate all of
[39:57] y'all. I know the the the meetings were
[39:59] a blessing back a few months ago. We was
[40:02] able to make it for a few of the
[40:03] services and I know it's a lot of work
[40:05] and effort goes into it, but it sure
[40:08] sure was a blessing to me personally. So
[40:10] I I appreciate all that y'all do. First
[40:13] Peter 1 and1 Peter an apostle of Jesus
[40:17] Christ to the strangers scattered
[40:20] throughout Punctus, Galatia, Capidosia,
[40:23] Asia and Bethneia elect according to the
[40:27] fornowledge of God the father through
[40:30] sanctification of the spirit unto
[40:32] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[40:35] Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace
[40:38] be multiplied. and Galatians 3 and and
[40:42] 28,
[40:44] the Bible would say, "There is neither
[40:46] Jew nor Greek. There is neither bond nor
[40:49] free. There is neither male nor female.
[40:52] For ye all are all one in Christ Jesus.
[40:55] And if you be Christ, then you're
[40:57] Abraham's seed and heir according to the
[41:01] promise." Are you thankful for that this
[41:02] morning? Amen. Let's bow our heads this
[41:05] morning. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[41:07] Lord, we're thankful for this
[41:09] opportunity that we have to come into
[41:11] your house one more time, Lord. God,
[41:13] we're thankful for your presence that we
[41:15] feel among us, God.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's an atmosphere that's been
[41:19] created, Lord. We ask that you would
[41:20] just feel welcome here among us, Father.
[41:23] Lord, you know the needs and the desires
[41:25] of every one of the hearts that are that
[41:27] are sitting here, Lord. We're we're a
[41:29] needy people, Father, and only you can
[41:32] can change lives and situations, Lord.
[41:34] We ask that you would just have your way
[41:36] today. We give you the preeminence in
[41:38] this service. Father, we commit all of
[41:40] these things into your hands in Jesus'
[41:43] name. Amen. You may be seated here this
[41:46] this morning. I just have a a simple
[41:48] thought, but it would be on the lines of
[41:50] elected strangers. And and here uh the
[41:54] apostle Peter is addressing these words
[41:56] to the strangers that are scattered
[41:59] throughout these places. And whenever
[42:01] you look at the word stranger, it's
[42:03] always connected with the words pilgrim
[42:06] and and souljourner. And we can look in
[42:09] in the Bible, the children of Israel was
[42:11] always likened unto strangers or
[42:13] pilgrims. And you can look in the uh
[42:15] book of Leviticus 25 and 23. The land
[42:19] shall not be sold forever, for the land
[42:22] is mine, for ye are strangers and
[42:24] souljourers with me. In Hebrews 11:13,
[42:28] these all died in faith, not having
[42:30] received the promises, but having seen
[42:32] them a far off, and were persuaded of
[42:34] them, and embraced them and confessed
[42:37] they were strangers and pilgrims upon
[42:40] the earth. And and I believe that God
[42:42] has has called us to be a separated
[42:45] people. You know, I don't believe he's
[42:47] called us to fit in with the world.
[42:49] We're we're walking among the world, but
[42:51] we're but we're not to be a part of
[42:53] them. and and I think it's an incredible
[42:55] thing how that that God would call a
[42:58] people in the most wicked age that
[43:00] there's ever been for his name's sake
[43:02] and would set her apart and and brother
[43:05] Brandham would say but a little
[43:07] something you might look at here in this
[43:09] in the scripture those who sought this
[43:11] new city acted different they professed
[43:14] they were pilgrims and strangers but on
[43:16] the side of Cain they became fugitives
[43:19] and renegades but Christians were
[43:21] pilgrims and strangers A fugitive has no
[43:24] home. A renegade is a horrible person.
[43:27] But a pilgrim is something real from a
[43:30] real land in another nation trying to
[43:33] find his way home professing by his
[43:36] living that he has something that he's
[43:39] from another country. And I think it's a
[43:42] powerful how how brother Brandham is
[43:44] describing that that we have something
[43:47] different. A pilgrim is something real.
[43:49] So I believe a pilgrim is more than just
[43:52] a confession that that I don't belong
[43:54] here and I'm heading somewhere. But
[43:56] brother Brandham says he's professing by
[43:58] his living that he has something. So in
[44:02] other words, there's an ambition that a
[44:04] pilgrim has that is pushing him or or
[44:08] driving him to a destination that he has
[44:11] in mind. And and I believe that's what
[44:14] separates the serpent seed and the bride
[44:17] of Christ. And brother Brandham would
[44:19] even say that on the side of Cain, the
[44:21] serpent seed, the fugitives and
[44:23] renegades. And and he would get that
[44:25] from the from the book of Genesis when
[44:27] when God would come and ask Cain where
[44:30] where his brother was. And he would say,
[44:31] "My brother's keeper." He would say that
[44:34] the the void the blood cries out against
[44:37] him and and he would put a mark on Cain.
[44:39] It would say, "You're going to be a
[44:40] fugitive and a renegade." So that is the
[44:43] side of Cain. But you can look that the
[44:46] bride is not a fugitive or a renegade.
[44:49] They belong somewhere. Even though they
[44:51] might not belong here, there's a place
[44:54] that God has predestinated that we come
[44:56] from and we're going back to. And it's
[44:59] like Jesus would say, "I come from God
[45:01] and I'll go back to God." So I believe
[45:04] that's the CONFESSION OF THE BRIDE as
[45:06] well. We come from God AND WE'RE GOING
[45:08] BACK TO GOD. And I believe that that
[45:11] this message has given us an ambition.
[45:14] We we we might not know what tomorrow
[45:16] holds, but we know who holds tomorrow.
[45:19] We might not know when when the body
[45:21] change is going to take place or or the
[45:23] rapture is going to take us out of here,
[45:26] BUT WE KNOW IF GOD SAID IT, I BELIEVE
[45:28] IT. WE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
[45:31] AND UNDERSTAND how things are going to
[45:33] happen, BUT THERE'S A FAITH IN THE WORD
[45:35] OF GOD. IF HE SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT. AND
[45:39] AND THAT GIVES AN AMBITION TO GET INTO
[45:42] THE WORD of the Lord because if the word
[45:44] is FULL OF PROMISES, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
[45:47] HE PROMISED ME. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY
[45:49] FUTURE IS. AND AND THAT'S WHAT'S
[45:51] INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE ambition of the
[45:54] bride is there's A FUTURE THAT IS
[45:56] CONCRETED. There's a FUTURE THAT THAT
[45:59] GOD HAS ALREADY PLACED OUT THAT ALL WE
[46:02] HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW THE VISION and act
[46:05] out what God has GIVEN US. AND THAT'S
[46:07] WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE serpent
[46:09] seat. ALL THEY HAVE IS WHAT'S UPON THE
[46:12] EARTH and and their ambitions in the
[46:14] stock market. It's in it's in their
[46:16] money in in their their their houses and
[46:19] their cars AND AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
[46:21] STRIVING FOR. And and I believe we need
[46:23] to make a living. WE WE NEED TO PROVIDE
[46:25] for our families. BUT BUT THAT'S NOT OUR
[46:27] AMBITION. BUT SERPENT SEED, THAT'S ALL
[46:30] THEY HAVE BECAUSE ONCE THEY GO BY THE
[46:33] WAY OF THE GRAVE, THEY HAVE NOTHING
[46:35] LEFT. COULD you imagine living a life
[46:37] and believing there's no God? Could you
[46:39] imagine living a life and believing
[46:40] there's no THERE'S NO HEAVEN? WHAT WHAT
[46:43] ARE YOU STRIVING FOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
[46:46] FUTURE? BUT YOU CAN LOOK AT JEREMIAH 29
[46:49] and 11. FOR I KNOW THE THOUGHTS THAT I
[46:52] think towards you, SAITH THE LORD,
[46:54] THOUGHTS OF PEACE AND NOT OF EVIL, TO
[46:57] GIVE YOU AN EXPECTED END. SO WE MIGHT
[47:00] NOT HAVE MUCH WE CAN OFFER HERE BUT WE
[47:03] HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT GOD HAS GIVEN
[47:06] us and it's AN EXPECTED END. HALLELUJAH.
[47:09] YOU SEE WE DON'T GO BY ANYTHING OR GO
[47:12] THROUGH ANYTHING BY ACCIDENT. BUT GOD
[47:14] HAS ALREADY SEEN IT AND HAS PROVIDED A
[47:17] WAY OUT of it. AND SO THAT'S WHY IF IF
[47:20] you lose a loved one maybe that goes by
[47:22] the way of the grave, YOU DON'T SORROW
[47:25] LIKE OTHERS WITHOUT HOPE SORROWS BECAUSE
[47:28] YOU HAVE an expectation. You can look at
[47:31] 1 Thessalonians 4:16. For the Lord
[47:34] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[47:37] shout, with a voice of the archangel and
[47:39] the the trump of God, and the dead in
[47:42] Christ shall rise first. Then we which
[47:44] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[47:47] together with them in the clouds to meet
[47:50] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[47:52] ever be with the Lord. WHEREFORE COMFORT
[47:55] ONE ANOTHER WITH THESE WORDS. AND SO
[47:58] IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THERE'S COMFORT IN
[48:01] THE AMBITION THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US.
[48:04] BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE SOMEBODY BY THE WAY
[48:06] OF the grave, 1 Thessalonians 4:13 would
[48:09] say, "But I would not have you to be
[48:11] ignorant, BRETHREN, CONCERNING THEM
[48:13] WHICH ARE ASLEEP." THEY'RE NOT DEAD.
[48:16] THEY'RE JUST RESTING. THAT YOU SORROW
[48:18] NOT EVEN AS OTHERS WHICH HAVE NO HOPE.
[48:22] SO WE SORROW, BUT WE DON'T SORROW LIKE
[48:25] THEM THAT HAVE NO HOPE. WE HAVE
[48:27] SOMETHING THAT IS PUSHING US AND KNOWING
[48:30] WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEM ONCE AGAIN. AND
[48:33] AND THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT THE
[48:35] WORD OF the Lord. If if you have a
[48:37] teenager THAT IS MIGHT BE MIGHT BE
[48:39] REBELLIOUS, YOU CAN COMFORT YOURSELF IN
[48:42] THE WORD OF THE LORD. IF IF YOU'RE
[48:43] DISCOURAGED AND AND YOU CAN'T YOU FEEL
[48:45] LIKE YOU CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
[48:47] THERE'S A COMFORT IN THE WORD OF THE
[48:50] LORD. IT WOULD BE DAVID THAT THAT WOULD
[48:53] HAVE TO COURAGE HIMSELF IN THE LORD
[48:55] BECAUSE THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT HIS
[48:58] FLESH WAS DISTRESSED AND HIS FAMILY WAS
[49:01] TAKEN AWAY. HIS WARRIORS THAT THEIR
[49:03] WIVES AND CHILDREN WAS TAKEN AWAY. They
[49:06] they WOULD PICK UP STONES TO STONING.
[49:08] BUT YET THERE WAS A COMFORT ON THE
[49:10] INSIDE THAT WOULD COMFORT HIM IN THE
[49:13] TIME OF DISTRESS. AND AND I BELIEVE
[49:16] SOMETIMES OUR BACK may be against the
[49:19] wall, BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. YOU
[49:20] CAN TURN ON A TAPE OR OR COME TO CHURCH
[49:23] AND AND YOUR PASTOR AS HE BEGINS TO
[49:25] PREACH. THERE'S A COMFORT THAT COMES
[49:28] FROM THOSE WORDS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE HAVE
[49:31] AN EXPECTATION. WE KNOW WE HAVE A AN AN
[49:35] END THAT we're working for. AND AND SO
[49:38] THAT THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES US FROM THE
[49:41] SERPENT SEAT IS WE HAVE A DIRECTION. WE
[49:44] HAVE SOMETHING we're striving for.
[49:46] Because many times when you think OF A
[49:48] PILGRIM, YOU THINK OF somebody that is
[49:50] just roaming and and they got no
[49:52] direction. They have no no no no no no
[49:54] no no no no no no place they're trying
[49:55] to get to. But if you think about it, a
[49:58] pilgrim has more of A DIRECTION THAN
[50:01] THAT OF THE LOCALS BECAUSE ALL HE HAS IS
[50:04] THIS DIRECTION. HE HE HAS NO HOME. HE HE
[50:06] MIGHT NOT HAVE NO FAMILY. HE MIGHT NOT
[50:08] have a bank account. And the only THING
[50:11] HE HAS IS THE FUTURE THAT HE HAS in
[50:14] mind. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
[50:16] BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD HAVE A HOMELESS
[50:18] man that that would come and knock on
[50:20] his door and and would want want some
[50:23] food and brother Brandham would would
[50:25] bring him inside, give him a sandwich
[50:26] and ask him, "Where were you going?" He
[50:28] says, "Oh, nowhere." HE SAYS, "WHERE'D
[50:30] YOU COME FROM?" HE SAYS, "OH, NOWHERE."
[50:33] He says, "Wherever my hat is resting,
[50:35] that's the place I call home." And and
[50:37] he, Brother Brand, I'm going to ask the
[50:39] man, "How long have you been doing
[50:41] this?" He says, "For about 20 years." He
[50:43] says the man HAD NO AMBITIONS TO BETTER
[50:46] HIMSELF. And you can look at the
[50:48] children of Israel HOW THAT WHEN THEY
[50:50] GOT INTO the promised land that then
[50:53] they would say, "GIVE US A KING THAT WE
[50:55] CAN BE LIKE THE other ones." So it's
[50:57] easy when you GET SETTLED IN TO LOSE
[51:00] YOUR DRIVE. It's it's EASY WHEN THINGS
[51:02] ARE GOING GOOD that you lose your
[51:04] AMBITION AND THEN YOU want a king like
[51:07] the rest of the nations. BUT BUT LET ME
[51:10] SAY THIS. GOD HAS CALLED US NOT to fit
[51:12] in, BUT HE'S CALLED US TO BE A ROYAL
[51:15] PRIESTHOOD. WE'RE A CHOSEN GENERATION
[51:18] THAT HAS BEEN SET APART AND BEEN GIVEN
[51:21] AN AMBITION. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
[51:23] AN AMBITION IS WHAT DRIVES YOU. AND and
[51:26] brother Brown would would he would tell
[51:28] us that that when you're young, HE SAYS
[51:31] YOU SET YOUR AMBITIONS TO what you want
[51:33] to do. And he says, "You find it in your
[51:36] mind and and then it drops into your
[51:38] heart and then your ambitions drive you
[51:40] to it." AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE
[51:43] BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE NATURAL. BUT THE
[51:45] same thing happens IN THE SUPERNATURAL.
[51:47] WE TAKE ON THE MIND OF CHRIST AND AND
[51:50] THEN THAT DRIVES US TO WHAT GOD HAS
[51:53] CALLED US TO DO. AND AND SO, BROTHER
[51:55] BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US TALKING about
[51:57] his wife, and he would and she said,
[51:59] "Well, then we're not Americans. What
[52:02] are we?" I said our kingdom is from
[52:04] above. And so we are free. We're born
[52:07] again. The kingdom of God is within you.
[52:10] See, act like up there. You're delegates
[52:13] from there. I said we're citizens here
[52:16] living in the flesh, but our spirits
[52:18] were pilgrims AND STRANGERS. WE'RE
[52:21] FOREIGN TO THE world now, even our own
[52:23] nation. for we have accepted the
[52:25] invitation when a KNOCK AT OUR HEART TO
[52:29] BE A TO BECOME A PART OF him his word
[52:32] AND SO THERE'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR
[52:35] AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW HOW BROTHER
[52:37] BRANDHAM he he would explain how do we
[52:40] become a pilgrim and a stranger he says
[52:43] our flesh is citizens here here BUT OUR
[52:47] SPIRIT MAN IS CITIZENS OF ANOTHER
[52:50] country another PLACE AND BROTHER
[52:52] BRANDON WOULD SAY MANY TIMES. HOW DO YOU
[52:55] HOW DO YOU BECOME a part of the kingdom
[52:57] of God? HE WOULD SAY BY ONE SPIRIT WE'RE
[52:59] ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY. AND SO
[53:02] THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES us that we're
[53:05] walking in the earth, but we're not a
[53:07] part of the earth. And and THEN BROTHER
[53:09] BRANDHAM TELLS US WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE
[53:12] INVITATION WHEN IT KNOCKED OUT OUR HEART
[53:15] to become a part of him, his word. AND
[53:18] SO THAT AND WHAT WHAT I THINK IS IS AN
[53:21] INCREDIBLE THING THAT ACCEPTING THE
[53:23] INVITATION IS MORE THAN A SINNER'S
[53:26] PRAYER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD HAS
[53:28] THAT THE NOMINAL CHURCH MEMBERS IS
[53:30] THEY'RE GETTING MEMBERS ALL OF THE TIME
[53:32] AND IT'S JUST A SINNER'S PRAYER. COME
[53:34] COME RECITE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE BORN
[53:36] INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. BUT BROTHER
[53:38] BRANDHAM IS TELLING US IT'S MORE THAN
[53:40] THAT. YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE WORD WHEN IT
[53:43] KNOCKS UPON YOUR HEART. AND ONLY THE
[53:46] ONES THAT HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE IS
[53:49] GOING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION. CUZ IT
[53:52] WAS JESUS THAT WOULD SAY, "THE PEOPLE
[53:53] DRAW NIGH UNTO ME with their mouth
[53:56] honorth me with their lips, BUT THEIR
[53:59] HEARTS IS FAR FROM ME." AND BROTHER
[54:01] BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT'S THE
[54:03] CONDITION OF THE CHURCH. RIGHT?
[54:04] Revelations 3, BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE
[54:07] DOOR AND KNOCK. IF ANY MAN open the
[54:08] door, I WILL COME IN AND WILL S WITH
[54:10] HIM. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT'S THE
[54:12] CONDITION OF THE CHURCH. THE VOICE OF
[54:15] GOD, WHICH IS THE WORD, IS ON THE
[54:17] OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH TRYING TO get in.
[54:21] AND IF YOU LOOK AT REVELATIONS 3,
[54:23] THERE'S NO CLAIMING in that verse. I
[54:25] STAND AT THE DOOR. IF ANY man hear MY
[54:27] VOICE AND OPEN THE DOOR, THAT'S A
[54:29] WHOSOEVER WILL. It's and brother Brandon
[54:31] would tell us, GOD DOES NOT GIVE
[54:33] JUDGMENT WITHOUT FIRST GIVING WARNING.
[54:36] SO GOD HAS GOT TO GIVE THE CHURCH A
[54:38] CHANCE AT THE WORD IN ORDER FOR HIM TO
[54:41] BE A JUST GOD. BUT THERE'S NO HEART TO
[54:44] RECEIVE IT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE BRIDE OF
[54:46] CHRIST. THE BRIDE OF CHRIST MIGHT BE A
[54:49] STRANGER, BUT THEY'RE ELECTED TO RECEIVE
[54:52] THE WORD WHEN IT KNOCKS UPON THEIR
[54:55] HEART. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SITTING HERE
[54:57] THIS MORNING. IT'S NOT BY YOUR OWN
[54:59] ACCORD OR YOUR OWN MERITS. IT WAS A DEEP
[55:02] CALLING INTO THE DEEP. AND WHEN THE WORD
[55:04] WOULD CALL OUT YOUR NAME, THERE WOULD BE
[55:07] A HEART TO RECEIVE IT. ARE YOU THANKFUL
[55:10] FOR THAT THIS MORNING? BUT WHEN MAYBE
[55:11] WHEN FAMILY MEMBERS TURNED AWAY OR OR
[55:14] CHURCH MEMBERS TURNED AWAY, PASTORS MAY
[55:16] HAVE DENOUNCED THE MESSAGE, YOU'RE STILL
[55:19] SITTING HERE WITH THE REVELATION, IT WAS
[55:21] BECAUSE OF THE GRACE OF GOD THAT WOULD
[55:24] CALL YOU FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND SO CHRIST
[55:28] HAS GIVEN THE CHURCH A CHANCE. But
[55:30] brother Brandham would say church
[55:31] members want a denominational FILTER SO
[55:34] THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN DESIRE OR THEIR
[55:37] OWN AMBITION AND STILL be classified
[55:40] religious people. SO THEY WANT TO BE
[55:43] CALLED A CHRISTIAN BUT HAVE THEIR OWN
[55:45] AMBITION. BUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST SAYS
[55:47] IT'S THE WORD AND THE WORD ALONE.
[55:50] WHATEVER THE WORD SAYS THAT IS YAY AND
[55:53] AMEN. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US
[55:56] AND HE WOULD SAY IF you want to see the
[55:58] condition of the church he would say
[56:00] look at the women right he says the
[56:02] condition OF THE WOMEN DESCRIBES THE
[56:05] CONDITION OF THE CHURCH and we're living
[56:07] in a w a women's world AND AND IT'S
[56:09] INCREDIBLE HOW THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HE
[56:12] WOULD see these THINGS HE HE WOULD SAY
[56:14] THAT THAT WOMEN would rather have dogs
[56:16] and cats instead of birthing children he
[56:19] says because it'll deform their bodies
[56:21] and make their bodies ugly HE SAYS YOU
[56:23] CAN'T GO TO THE CLUBS WITH A WITH A
[56:25] NURSING CHILD. And so they would rather
[56:28] they would rather MOTHER A A DOG OR A
[56:31] CAT INSTEAD OF BRINGING FORTH LIFE. AND
[56:34] THEN HE WOULD SAY THE CHURCH IS doing
[56:35] the same thing. HE SAYS SHE'S INCRED SHE
[56:38] SHE'S IMPREGNATED WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE
[56:41] SHE'S bringing forth members all of the
[56:44] time. BUT SHE DOES NOT WANT THESE ACTS
[56:46] 238 SCREAMING, HOLLERING, BABBLING
[56:49] CHILDREN. BUT HE SAYS THAT'S THE ONLY
[56:51] KIND THAT THE CHURCH WILL BRING FORTH.
[56:55] SO THEY WANT TO BE LABELED A CHRISTIAN,
[56:57] BUT THEY WANT THEIR OWN AMBITIONS. THEY
[56:59] DON'T WANT TO ACT OUT THE WORD FOR THIS
[57:02] AGE. BUT THERE'S A TRUE CHURCH THAT IS
[57:04] THE TRUE BRIDE. THERE'S BEEN CHURCHES,
[57:07] CHURCHES, BRIDES, BRIDES. BUT THERE'S
[57:08] GOING TO COME ONE THAT IS GOING TO TAKE
[57:11] ON THE HEADSHIP OF THE WORD AND BE
[57:14] PRODUCING THE WORD IN THIS GENERATION.
[57:17] AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER
[57:18] BRANDON, HE'S DESCRIBING THE CHURCH AND
[57:21] and the and the and the women of the
[57:23] day. And then he says THIS HERE. NOTICE
[57:25] THIS CHARACTER WHEN YOU SEE WOMEN JUST
[57:28] GO ON the rampage just just doing
[57:30] anything they want to do. HE SAYS,
[57:32] "WATCH THE CHURCH IS DOING the same
[57:34] thing." HE SAYS, "NOTICE. BUT WATCH WHEN
[57:36] THE SPIRITUAL BRIDE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO
[57:39] HAVE A REVIVAL, WHEN SHE BEGINS TO COME
[57:41] BACK AND LINE HERSELF UP WITH THE WORD
[57:44] OF GOD. WATCH THEN AGAIN. YOU'VE SEEN
[57:47] HOW THE SCRIPTURES AT THAT TIME THERE BE
[57:49] A MESSAGE SWEEP OUT TO CATCH THE BRIDE,
[57:53] CATCH THE WOMAN ELECT. SO WHILE THE
[57:55] CHURCH IS BEING CONDITIONED BY REJECTING
[57:58] THE WORD OF THE LORD, THE BRIDE IS BEING
[58:01] CONDITIONED BY ACCEPTING IT. AND SO
[58:03] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS IS THE
[58:05] CONDITION OF THE CHURCH BUT NOT THE
[58:07] CONDITION OF THE BRIDE. THAT'S WHY
[58:09] BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD PREACH A BRIDE
[58:11] AGE BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS CONDITIONED BY
[58:14] HAVING THE WORD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE
[58:16] CHURCH. BUT THE BRIDE IS IN A SECRET
[58:19] PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD BECAUSE SHE'S
[58:22] ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHEN NOT UPON
[58:26] THE WORD. KNOCK UPON YOUR HEART. JOHN
[58:28] 10:27 WOULD SAY THIS HERE. MY SHEEP HEAR
[58:31] MY VOICE AND I KNOW THEM AND THEY FOLLOW
[58:35] ME. AND SO THIS IS A SEPARATE THING THAN
[58:38] REVELATIONS 3. REVELATIONS 3 IS
[58:41] WHOSOEVER WILL I'M STANDING and knocking
[58:43] ON THE DOOR. BUT JOHN 10 SAYS MY SHEEP
[58:47] WILL HEAR MY VOICE. THAT'S A CLAIMING
[58:50] OVER YOUR LIFE THAT IT'S NOT YOU MIGHT
[58:52] MISS IT OR OR YOU MIGHT ACCEPT IT, BUT
[58:55] THIS IS A CLAIMING THAT MY SHEEP IS
[58:58] GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE. BROTHER BRANDON
[59:01] WOULD SAY THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED of
[59:03] God. the church goes through. That's the
[59:06] ones that says whosoever will let him
[59:08] come. BUT THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED OF
[59:12] GOD. AND SO JOHN 10, MY SHEEP HEAR MY
[59:15] VOICE. I BELIEVE THAT IS A CLAIMING OVER
[59:18] OUR LIVES. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[59:20] BECAUSE THERE'S THREE THINGS in that
[59:22] verse that that really stood out to me.
[59:24] My sheep hear my voice and I know THEM
[59:27] AND THEY FOLLOW ME. SO THE VERY REASON
[59:31] THAT YOU HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE THE
[59:34] WORD IS BECAUSE YOU CAME FROM THE MIND
[59:36] OF GOD IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO WHEN
[59:38] THE WORD CAME ACROSS, CHRIST WASN'T I I
[59:41] HOPE THEY'RE going to accept it. I I
[59:43] HOPE THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE IT. BUT HE
[59:45] ALREADY KNEW YOU. MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY
[59:47] VOICE BECAUSE I KNOW THEM. SO THERE WAS
[59:49] AN ELECTED SEAT. AND I DON'T BELIEVE
[59:52] THAT WHENEVER THE 70 would leave Jesus
[59:54] and he would look at his disciples and
[59:56] would say, "Will you LEAVE ME ALSO?" I
[59:58] DON'T BELIEVE HE HAD A QUESTION THERE. I
[1:00:00] BELIEVE HE WAS QUESTIONING THEIR FAITH
[1:00:03] TO SEE WHERE THEY STOOD. HE KNEW WHAT
[1:00:05] PETER WAS SAYING. AND PETER WOULD SAY,
[1:00:07] "WHERE WOULD WE GO? FOR THOU HAS THE
[1:00:09] WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE." HE WAS
[1:00:11] QUESTIONING HIS FAITH TO SEE WHERE HE
[1:00:14] STOOD. AND SOMETIMES OUR FAITH GETS
[1:00:17] QUESTIONED. BUT GOD DON'T HAVE A DOUBT
[1:00:19] THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REFUSE IT. HE KNOWS
[1:00:22] YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE HE
[1:00:24] KNOWS YOU. HE PREDESTINATED YOU FROM
[1:00:27] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND
[1:00:30] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WHENEVER PETER
[1:00:32] WOULD SAY THOSE WORDS, WHERE WOULD WE
[1:00:34] GO? BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT
[1:00:36] IT WAS RIGHT RIGHT BEFORE THAT. Jesus is
[1:00:39] saying, "Eat my flesh and drink my
[1:00:41] blood." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "PETER
[1:00:43] AND THE DISCIPLES DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
[1:00:45] HE MEANT, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT."
[1:00:48] HALLELUJAH. THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE
[1:00:49] UNDERSTOOD IT. AND SINCE THEY DIDN'T
[1:00:51] UNDERSTAND IT, THEY DIDN'T TURN AWAY
[1:00:53] LIKE THE OTHERS, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT
[1:00:55] BECAUSE THEY KNEW THIS WAS THE WORD FOR
[1:00:58] THE HOUR. AND YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:01:01] EVERYTHING, BUT YET YOU BELIEVE IT. IT'S
[1:01:03] BECAUSE THERE'S AN ELECTED SEED ON THE
[1:01:06] INSIDE. WHERE WOULD I GO? FOR THOU HAST
[1:01:09] THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. WHERE WOULD I
[1:01:11] GO? THERE'S NO RAPTURE OUTSIDE OF THIS
[1:01:14] MESSAGE. THERE'S NO BODY CHANGE OUTSIDE
[1:01:16] OF THIS MESSAGE. AND THERE'S A SEED TO
[1:01:19] ACCEPT IT EVEN WHEN YOU MIGHT NOT
[1:01:21] UNDERSTAND IT. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[1:01:24] ENCOURAGING AS A YOUNG PERSON BECAUSE
[1:01:26] YOU MIGHT NOT NOT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN
[1:01:28] EVERYTHING, BUT YET THERE'S A HEART TO
[1:01:31] RECEIVE IT. THERE'S A HEART THAT SAYS,
[1:01:33] "AMEN. YES, I believe it." AND SO THAT
[1:01:36] THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SERPENT SEED
[1:01:39] DOES NOT HAVE. THEY DIDN'T COME FROM GOD
[1:01:42] AND THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK TO GOD. BUT
[1:01:44] YOU HAVE AND AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[1:01:46] SAY HE'S an eagle. This is in the rising
[1:01:48] of the sun. He says he's an eagle to
[1:01:51] begin with. He recognizes the real EAGLE
[1:01:54] RECOGNIZES THE CALL OF GOD'S WORD. WHY?
[1:01:58] HE'S AN EAGLE. AN EAGLE TO AN EAGLE AND
[1:02:01] THE WORD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION. HE SAYS
[1:02:03] the word to the word. And so in other
[1:02:06] words, YOU'RE A PART OF GOD'S WORD.
[1:02:09] You're a predestinated SEED. AND WHEN
[1:02:11] THE WORD come across YOUR COME ACROSS
[1:02:14] YOUR PATH, IT WAS WORD RESPONDING UNTO
[1:02:17] WORD. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY,
[1:02:20] "MY SHEEP hear my voice." And he would
[1:02:22] say, "They know my word. THEY SEE IT
[1:02:24] VINDICATED FOR THAT AGE." So in other
[1:02:27] words, when Jesus says, "My sheep will
[1:02:30] hear my voice." He's making a CLAIM THAT
[1:02:33] MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VINDICATED
[1:02:36] WORD OR IT'S GOING TO HEAR MY MESSAGE.
[1:02:38] AND THERE'S MANY VOICES OUT THERE THAT
[1:02:41] CAN GET YOUR ATTENTION THAT WILL TRY TO
[1:02:43] CLAIM YOUR LIFE. BUT THERE'S ALREADY A
[1:02:46] CLAIM THAT IS ON YOUR LIFE THAT MY SHEEP
[1:02:49] IS GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE. NO MATTER THE
[1:02:52] OTHER VOICES, NO MATTER THE OTHER
[1:02:55] INFLUENCES, WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY
[1:02:57] ALMIGHTY GOD. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S
[1:03:00] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE JESUS WOULD WOULD
[1:03:03] WOULD SAY THAT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS
[1:03:05] LIKE a net, right? AND YOU THROW IT OUT
[1:03:07] INTO the ocean and and you're you're
[1:03:09] going after the fish, BUT YOU ATTRACT
[1:03:11] many things. And brother Brandham, HE HE
[1:03:14] WOULD SORT OF DRAMATIZE IT AND WOULD SAY
[1:03:17] WHEN YOU THROW OUT THE NET. He says
[1:03:19] there's water spiders get in there. HE
[1:03:21] SAYS THERE'S SERPENTS THAT GET IN THERE.
[1:03:23] AND HE SAYS THE FISH, THEY ALSO GET IN
[1:03:26] THERE. AND HE SAYS THAT THAT THE WATER
[1:03:28] SPIDER THAT IT STAYS in there for about
[1:03:30] 10 days, but then says I have to give up
[1:03:32] my pants. So it jumps out of the net.
[1:03:34] AND THEN THE SERPENT'S IN THERE FOR A
[1:03:36] LITTLE WHILE AND SAYS, "I HAVE TO GIVE
[1:03:38] UP MY CLUBS." HE JUMPS OUT OF THE NET.
[1:03:41] HE SAYS, "THE NET HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:03:44] IT. IT WAS ALREADY A WATER SPIDER BEFORE
[1:03:47] IT CAME INTO THE NET." SO, in other
[1:03:49] words, THE NET DID NOT MAKE A FISH A
[1:03:52] FISH. IT ATTRACTED EVERYTHING, BUT ONLY
[1:03:55] CLAIMED THE ONE IT WAS AFTER. AND THIS
[1:03:58] MESSAGE DID NOT MAKE YOU BRIDE. IT
[1:04:01] ATTRACTED MANY. REMEMBER THE THREE
[1:04:03] POOLS. THE FIRST PULL ATTRACTED SOME.
[1:04:05] THE SECOND ATTRACTED SOME. BUT THE THIRD
[1:04:07] PULL WAS ONLY AFTER THE RAINBOW TRAP. IT
[1:04:11] WAS ONLY AFTER THE ONE IT COME TO CLAIM.
[1:04:14] AND MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD THE
[1:04:16] MESSAGE AND LIKE THE SIGNS, like the
[1:04:19] wonders, LIKE THE ANOINTING, BUT THEY
[1:04:21] DID NOT HAVE A HEART TO RECEIVE THE WORD
[1:04:24] BECAUSE IT WASN'T AFTER THEM. IT WAS
[1:04:26] AFTER YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY MANY
[1:04:29] TURNED AWAY, BUT YOU'RE STILL SITTING
[1:04:31] HERE TODAY is because it come to claim
[1:04:35] your life.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THIS MESSAGE DID NOT MAKE
[1:04:38] YOU BRIDE. IT BROUGHT THE POTENTIALS
[1:04:41] THAT WAS ALREADY LAYING THERE. SO WE
[1:04:43] WOULD GO FROM POTENTIALLY BEING THE
[1:04:45] BRIDE TO MANIFESTING THE LIFE OF THE
[1:04:49] BRIDE. AND AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT the
[1:04:51] message has claimed our lives. BROTHER
[1:04:54] BRANDON WOULD SAY IN MANY PLACES HE
[1:04:56] WOULD SAY, "FATHER, THEY are yours. THEY
[1:04:58] ARE TROPHIES of your word." He would
[1:05:01] say, "I claim them for you tonight,
[1:05:03] Jesus, as your PERSONAL TREASURE, AS
[1:05:06] GEMS in your crown." He would say in in
[1:05:09] one place, he says throughout the world,
[1:05:11] wherever this message may go, turn them
[1:05:13] loose. I CLAIM THEM. AND HE SAYS THIS IN
[1:05:16] MANY PLACES. AND HE WOULD SAY IN IN
[1:05:19] multiple places as well that the ones
[1:05:21] that are in here, I claim them. And the
[1:05:23] ones that will hear this message OR OR
[1:05:26] HEAR THIS TAPE, I claim them as well. SO
[1:05:29] IT IT TAKES AWAY WITH I WASN'T THERE, SO
[1:05:32] GOD AIN'T DEALING WITH ME. NO. IF YOU
[1:05:35] HAVE A HEART to receive the word,
[1:05:37] THERE'S A CLAIMING THAT IS TAKING PLACE.
[1:05:40] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD say in one place,
[1:05:42] HE SAYS, YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE WORD AND I
[1:05:45] claim them. AND HE SAYS, "AND SATAN
[1:05:47] CANNOT BE AROUND THEM no more. I CLAIM
[1:05:50] THEM FOR THE GOSPEL." SO IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:05:54] when God claims you, all of the CLAIMS
[1:05:57] THAT THE DEVIL HAS ON YOUR LIFE IS NOW
[1:06:00] BROKEN. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS
[1:06:02] BROTHER BRANDHAM JUST SAYING praying a
[1:06:04] prayer, I claim them. I claim them. I
[1:06:06] CLAIM THEM. BUT I believe it WAS A WORD
[1:06:08] OF AUTHORITY THAT WAS CLAIMING OUR LIVES
[1:06:11] AND AND WOULD CALL US MAYBE OUT OF A A
[1:06:14] DENOMINATIONAL SETTING, MAYBE BORN ON A
[1:06:16] CHURCH PEW, BUT WAS BOUND BY A RELIGIOUS
[1:06:18] SPIRIT. AND THAT RELIGIOUS SPIRIT WOULD
[1:06:21] HAVE A CLAIM ON YOUR LIFE. BUT ONCE
[1:06:23] THERE WAS A HEART TO RECEIVE, THEN YOU
[1:06:25] WOULD BE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER VOICE. AND
[1:06:28] THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN A BRIDE AGE
[1:06:31] BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE'S A SEPARATION.
[1:06:33] THE BOOK OF THE BIBLE WOULD TELL us that
[1:06:35] in Exodus THAT THAT THAT WHENEVER THE
[1:06:37] DEATH ANGEL WAS COMING THROUGH THE LAND
[1:06:39] OF EGYPT, THE GOD WOULD SAY, "I WILL
[1:06:41] SEVER IN THAT DAY IN THE LAND of Egypt."
[1:06:44] He would S PUT A DIVISION BETWEEN MY
[1:06:47] PEOPLE AND THY PEOPLE. SO EVEN THOUGH
[1:06:50] THE CHILDREN of Israel WAS IN EGYPT,
[1:06:53] THEY WERE IN A PLACE CALLED GAN AND THEY
[1:06:56] WERE SET APART AND THERE WAS NO CLAIM
[1:06:58] THAT THE DEATH ANGEL HAD ON THEIR LIVES.
[1:07:02] AND WE MIGHT BE AND LAY ON A SEA, BUT
[1:07:04] WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED INTO A BRIDE AGE. I
[1:07:07] HEARD ANOTHER VOICE SAYING, "COME OUT OF
[1:07:09] HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE NOT PARTAKERS OF
[1:07:12] HER SINS AND NOT OF HER PLAGUES."
[1:07:14] THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
[1:07:16] BEEN CLAIMED BY ONE VOICE, BUT WHEN THE
[1:07:19] VOICE OF GOD CAME ACROSS YOUR PATH, IT
[1:07:22] WOULD SAY, "NO MORE CLAIMS FOR YOU,
[1:07:24] SATAN. YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A CLAIM ON
[1:07:26] HIM, BUT NOW I'M CLAIMING THEIR LIFE FOR
[1:07:28] THE GLORY OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO BE A TROPHY
[1:07:32] OF GOD'S GRACE. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE IN
[1:07:35] THIS GENERATION. WHILE MARRIAGES ARE
[1:07:37] FALLING APART, YOU'RE A TROPHY OF WHAT
[1:07:40] THIS MESSAGE CAN DO. WHILE CHILDREN ARE
[1:07:42] OUT IN THE WORLD, YOUNG PEOPLE IS A
[1:07:45] TROPHY OF WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAN DO.
[1:07:47] HALLELUJAH. IT'S SHOWING THAT WHILE ALL
[1:07:50] OF THE WORLD MIGHT BE IN SMOKING AND
[1:07:52] DRINKING AND DRUGS AND PORNOGRAPHY,
[1:07:54] THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT IS A TROPHY OF
[1:07:57] WHAT GOD CAN DO.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE GOD HAS A WITNESS
[1:08:02] UPON THE EARTH THAT IS SHINING THE LIFE
[1:08:06] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? Because
[1:08:09] he HAS PUT A DIVISION between us and the
[1:08:13] world. There's a separation. And brother
[1:08:15] Brown say, "Didn't Jesus say in the last
[1:08:18] days, Matthew 24 and 24, these two that
[1:08:22] the the two would be so close it would
[1:08:24] deceive the very genes predestinated the
[1:08:27] elected ones if it was possible. Almost
[1:08:30] like the real thing. See, so in the last
[1:08:32] days now you see it's wheat time now.
[1:08:36] It's getting harvest time. This is not
[1:08:38] Luther's age. This is not Pentecostal
[1:08:40] age. He says THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. As
[1:08:43] Moses called a nation out of a nation,
[1:08:46] Christ today is calling a church out of
[1:08:49] a church. You see the same thing in type
[1:08:53] taking them to the glorious eternal
[1:08:56] promised land. And I believe THIS
[1:08:58] POSITION IS NOT SOMETHING TO COME, BUT I
[1:09:01] BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED
[1:09:04] FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[1:09:06] BECAUSE BROTHER Brandon would say that
[1:09:08] when the death angel was coming through
[1:09:10] the land of Egypt, he says that the
[1:09:12] DEATH ANGEL COULD GO INTO ANYWHERE. It
[1:09:14] could go into the children of the ch the
[1:09:17] children of Israel's home. It could go
[1:09:18] into the palace. BUT HE SAYS THERE WAS
[1:09:20] ONE PLACE that it could not get into.
[1:09:23] And he says NOT A HOME BUT A PLACE. AND
[1:09:26] HE SAYS THAT'S WHERE the blood of the
[1:09:28] lamb was. AND HE SAYS SO IS IT TODAY. HE
[1:09:32] SAYS THERE'S ONE PLACE THAT THE DEATH
[1:09:34] ANGEL CAN'T GET INTO, and that's where
[1:09:36] the word of the LORD IS. IT'S INCREDIBLE
[1:09:40] BECAUSE THERE WASN'T one location there
[1:09:42] IN EGYPT THAT ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF
[1:09:45] ISRAEL HAD TO COME INTO. IT WASN'T ONE
[1:09:48] LOCATION, BUT IT WAS ONE PLACE. AND AND
[1:09:50] WE MIGHT NOT BE ALL IN THE SAME
[1:09:53] LOCATION. I LIVE IN OKLAHOMA. Y'ALL live
[1:09:55] in Missouri and Arkansas. Brother Josh
[1:09:58] IS IN ARIZONA. BUT YET WE'RE ALL IN THE
[1:10:01] SAME PLACE. WHAT IS THAT PLACE? IT'S A
[1:10:04] SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. THERE'S
[1:10:07] BEEN A SEPARATION. WE'VE BEEN SEATED
[1:10:09] INTO HEAVENLY PLACES. WHAT IS IT? IT'S
[1:10:12] THE WORD COMING AND CALLING THE ELECT,
[1:10:15] SAYING, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, AND
[1:10:17] BE A STRANGER. COME OUT OF HER AND BE
[1:10:21] AND BE PLACED INTO A A POSITION WITH ME
[1:10:24] AND ME ALONE." WELL, THERE'S MANY
[1:10:26] VOICES. YOU WILL ONLY HEAR MY VOICE.
[1:10:29] IT'S GOING TO BE MY LOVE SECRETS TO YOU.
[1:10:31] I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOUR FUTURE
[1:10:33] IS. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW I CAN SAVE
[1:10:36] YOUR CHILDREN. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW
[1:10:38] I CAN KEEP YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN.
[1:10:40] IT'S A SECRET PLACE WITH YOU AND GOD
[1:10:43] ALONE. HALLELUJAH. THAT WHEN YOU MIGHT
[1:10:45] GET DISCOURAGED, YOU CAN SAY, "LORD, I
[1:10:48] NEED SOME ENCOURAGEMENT." MAYBE WHEN
[1:10:50] THINGS IS NOT GOING THE WAY YOU THINK IT
[1:10:52] SHOULD, YOU CAN SAY, "LORD, I I CAN'T DO
[1:10:55] IT, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE WALKING WITH ME.
[1:10:57] IT'S A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:11:01] AND THERE'S NO DEATH ANGEL THAT CAN GET
[1:11:03] INTO THERE." And we know what that death
[1:11:05] angel is. It's spiritual death. But yet,
[1:11:07] we're living in life because we've been
[1:11:11] separated for his name's sake. And so
[1:11:14] that the claim OF SPIRITUAL DEATH HAS
[1:11:17] BEEN BROKEN OFF of our lives. AND AND
[1:11:19] THE APOSTLE PAUL WOULD TELL US THAT the
[1:11:22] voice of the blood speaks better things
[1:11:24] than that of Abel because the the the
[1:11:27] voice of the BLOOD OF ABEL WOULD CRY OUT
[1:11:29] AGAINST CAIN, BUT THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD
[1:11:32] OF CHRIST CRIES OUT for you. AND BECAUSE
[1:11:35] THE DEVIL WANTS TO TO MAKE THIS MESSAGE
[1:11:37] a voice of condemnation, a voice of dos
[1:11:40] and a voice of don'ts. BUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:11:43] IS NOT THE VOICE OF CONDEMNATION. THAT'S
[1:11:46] WHAT THE BLOOD OF ABEL WAS. IT WAS
[1:11:48] CONDEMNATION AGAINST CAIN. BUT THE
[1:11:51] BLOOD, the voice of THE BLOOD TODAY IS
[1:11:53] not a voice OF CONDEMNATION. BROTHER
[1:11:55] BRAND TELL US THE VOICE has the blood
[1:11:58] has a voice. AND THAT VOICE IS THE WORD
[1:12:01] of the Lord. AND SO WHAT IS THE VOICE OF
[1:12:03] THE BLOOD? IT IS THIS MESSAGE THAT IS
[1:12:06] NOT CONDEMNING YOU BUT IT'S BRINGING
[1:12:08] GRACE SAYING GRACE GRACE you can DO IT
[1:12:11] BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU WORTHY YOU CAN
[1:12:14] MAKE A RAPTURE IN YOUR OWN ABILITY BUT
[1:12:16] I'M GOING TO POUR OUT A GRACE THAT IS
[1:12:19] GOING TO SPEAK BETTER THINGS THAN THAT
[1:12:22] OF LEODYSIA IT'S GOING TO SPEAK BETTER
[1:12:24] THINGS THAN THAT OF LUKEWARMNESS AND AND
[1:12:27] LACKNESS AND FORMALISM THEY MIGHT HAVE
[1:12:30] VOICES AND CLAIMS BUT MY VOICE IS
[1:12:33] SPEAKING BETTER THINGS. HALLELUJAH. ARE
[1:12:36] YOU THANKFUL FOR THAT? THE VOICE OF THE
[1:12:38] RAPTURE IS SPEAKING BETTER THINGS THAN
[1:12:40] THAT OF GRAVITY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN
[1:12:43] CLAIM OUR LIVES. AND YOU MIGHT GO
[1:12:45] THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF
[1:12:47] DEATH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEAR NO
[1:12:49] EVIL. HOW COME, BROTHER JOSH, I'VE BEEN
[1:12:52] CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. I'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY
[1:12:55] ALMIGHTY GOD. SO THE VOICE OF THE blood
[1:12:58] speaks better things. AND IT'S A
[1:13:00] POWERFUL THING BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT
[1:13:03] MANY CLAIMS. Generational curses is a
[1:13:06] genuine CLAIM THAT CAN PASS FROM one
[1:13:08] generation to another. A TEMPER CAN PASS
[1:13:12] FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER.
[1:13:14] PORNOGRAPHY CAN PASS FROM ONE GENERATION
[1:13:17] TO ANOTHER. LYING CAN PASS from one
[1:13:19] generation to another. You remember
[1:13:21] whenever whenever Abraham would go to
[1:13:23] the land of Greer and would tell his
[1:13:25] wife, tell the king that YOU'RE MY
[1:13:27] SISTER. IF YOU LOOK, IT WAS THE next
[1:13:29] generation. It It was Isaac that would
[1:13:31] go into the land OF GREGER AND WOULD SAY
[1:13:33] THE SAME THING ABOUT ISRAEL. IT WAS A
[1:13:36] GENERATIONAL CURSE. BUT THE VOICE OF THE
[1:13:39] BLOOD, IT SPEAKS BETTER THINGS. MARITAL
[1:13:42] PROBLEMS CAN PASS FROM ONE GENERATION TO
[1:13:45] ANOTHER. CONDEMNATION CAN PASS. BUT YET,
[1:13:48] THE VOICE OF THE BLOOD IS CRYING FOR
[1:13:51] YOU, NOT AGAINST YOU, THAT YOU MIGHT BE
[1:13:54] IN A GENERATIONAL CURSE. BUT I BELIEVE
[1:13:56] THERE'S A BRIDE UPON THE EARTH THAT CAN
[1:13:59] MAKE A STAND. MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE MAY
[1:14:01] HAVE ended in A DIVORCE, BUT THAT'S NOT
[1:14:03] MY FUTURE. MY BROTHER MAY HAVE WENT OUT
[1:14:06] INTO THE WORLD, BUT THAT'S NOT MY
[1:14:08] FUTURE. WHAT IS IT? THERE'S A CLAIM THAT
[1:14:11] IS SPEAKING BETTER THINGS THAN ALL OF
[1:14:14] THE OTHER VOICES. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR
[1:14:16] THAT THIS MORNING? That there is a claim
[1:14:19] over our lives that speaks better things
[1:14:22] than that of the enemy. And it's it's an
[1:14:25] incredible thing because THE BIBLE WOULD
[1:14:27] TELL US ABOUT about Rahab and how that
[1:14:30] her house was upon the walls of the city
[1:14:33] and how it WAS THAT CITY THAT WAS
[1:14:35] PRONOUNCED judgment upon him and those
[1:14:38] walls were going to come down and she
[1:14:40] should have been another statistic.
[1:14:43] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HER HER HOUSE WAS
[1:14:45] upon the walls of the city and here
[1:14:47] we're living IN THE MIDST OF LEGACY
[1:14:49] WHERE MARRIAGES are falling apart where
[1:14:51] where young people are backsliding and
[1:14:54] and this is happening that is happening
[1:14:56] AND WE SHOULD BE ANOTHER STATISTIC BUT
[1:15:00] WHAT WOULD SEPARATE THE RAHAB WAS WHEN
[1:15:03] SHE AND THE SPIES WOULD COME INTO THE
[1:15:05] LAND AND SHE WOULD START TO TALK WITH
[1:15:07] HIM and would say we heard how that your
[1:15:10] god split THE RED SEA WE HEARD WHAT your
[1:15:13] god God did to the kings. WE HEARD WHAT
[1:15:16] YOUR GOD DID. AND THEN SHE WOULD STOP
[1:15:18] AND WOULD SAY, "BUT GIVE ME A TRUE TOKEN
[1:15:21] THAT MY HOUSE COULD BE SAVED, THAT MY
[1:15:23] BRETHREN CAN BE SAVED, THAT MY SISTERS
[1:15:25] CAN BE SAVED, THAT MY THAT MY DAD CAN BE
[1:15:28] SAVED, THAT MY MOM COULD BE SAVED." IT
[1:15:31] WAS A TRUE TOKEN THAT WOULD SEPARATE
[1:15:34] HER. AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS SHE WOULD
[1:15:36] START TO CLAIM THINGS. SHE WASN'T JUST
[1:15:39] HAPPY WITH HERSELF HAVING A POWERFUL A
[1:15:42] POWERFUL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE WANTED HER
[1:15:44] WHOLE FAMILY HAVING A POWERFUL
[1:15:47] EXPERIENCE AND THAT SHOULD BE THE
[1:15:49] ATTITUDE OF EVERY PARENT IS LORD I DON'T
[1:15:52] WANT TO JUST BE SAVED BUT CLAIM MY
[1:15:54] CHILDREN HALLELUJAH AND I BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:15:56] THE AUTHORITY OF THE BRIDE THAT YOU CAN
[1:15:59] CLAIM YOUR CHILDREN YOU CAN PRAY AND PUT
[1:16:01] THE HEDGE OF PROTECTION AROUND THEM
[1:16:03] APPLY THE TOKEN BUT THE BRON WOULD SAY
[1:16:06] THAT HE WOULD SAY APPLY THE TOKEN AND
[1:16:08] PUT IT OVER YOUR PRAYERS. AND HE WOULD
[1:16:10] SAY, "CLAIM YOUR FAMILY." HE SAYS, "IF
[1:16:12] YOU'VE GOT AN UNSAVED CHILD," HE SAYS,
[1:16:14] "LAY THE TOKEN RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM AND
[1:16:17] SAY,"LORD GOD, I CLAIM THEM." STAY RIGHT
[1:16:20] THERE. IF YOU GOT A MOTHER OR a loved
[1:16:22] one that's lost, LAY THE TOKEN ON THEM
[1:16:25] AND SAY, "LORD GOD, I CLAIM THEM." WE'RE
[1:16:28] LIVING IN THE TIME WHERE WE'RE NOT
[1:16:30] BEGGARS, BUT WE ARE STANDING IN A PLACE
[1:16:32] OF MATURITY WHERE YOU CAN SPEAK THE WORD
[1:16:35] OF THE LIVING GOD. AND GOD BACKS THAT
[1:16:38] WORD UP.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RAHAB SAYS, "NOT JUST ME,
[1:16:42] BUT I WANT MY FAMILY SAVED."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE CLAIMED, BUT
[1:16:46] CLAIM my loved ones. And so, IT'S A
[1:16:49] CLAIMING POWER THAT SPEAKS BETTER THINGS
[1:16:52] than that of the enemy. And so, AND MY
[1:16:55] SHEEP always know my voice. and I know
[1:16:57] them. And the third part of that verse
[1:16:59] that I LOVE IS AND THEY FOLLOW ME. SO IN
[1:17:02] OTHER WORDS, THERE'S GOING TO BE ACTIONS
[1:17:05] BEHIND IT. IT'S MORE THAN a lip service,
[1:17:08] but it's something THAT IS GOING TO
[1:17:09] DRIVE YOU. AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[1:17:11] RESPONSIBLE TO IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
[1:17:14] ACCEPT IT. AND THAT'S THE HARDEST THING
[1:17:16] TO DO MANY TIMES IS ACCEPT WHAT GOD
[1:17:19] THINKS OF YOU.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. ACCEPT THE WAY GOD
[1:17:23] THINKS OF SITUATIONS. You remember
[1:17:26] whenever Elijah was in the CAVE AND HE'S
[1:17:28] CRYING UNTO GOD AND HE WOULD SAY,
[1:17:30] "THEY'VE TORE DOWN YOUR ALTARS. THEY
[1:17:32] THEY KILLED ALL OF YOUR PROPHETS." AND
[1:17:34] WHAT WOULD GOD SAY? HE SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT
[1:17:36] THE ONLY ONE STANDING. I'VE GOT 7,000
[1:17:39] THAT HAVE NOT BOWED THEIR KNEE TO BAIL."
[1:17:42] AND MANY TIMES WE LOOK AT THINGS
[1:17:44] DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING
[1:17:46] AT IT. OH, COME ON, SOMEBODY. SOMETIMES
[1:17:49] YOU look at SITUATIONS AND SAY, "THERE'S
[1:17:51] NO WAY I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH IT." BUT
[1:17:53] YET GOD'S LOOKING AT HIM AND SAYS, "WHAT
[1:17:55] DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH
[1:17:56] IT? I'VE ALREADY MADE A WAY THROUGH IT."
[1:17:59] YOU REMEMBER IT WAS GIDEON THAT WHEN THE
[1:18:01] MESSAGE WOULD COME TO GIDEON AND WOULD
[1:18:02] SAY, "YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR." IF
[1:18:04] YOU LOOK UP that word valor, it means
[1:18:06] wealthy. YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF WEALTH.
[1:18:08] AND AND WHAT WOULD GIDEON SAY TO THE
[1:18:10] ANGEL? HE SAYS, "MY FAMILY IS POOR AND
[1:18:13] I'M LEASHED IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE." HE
[1:18:16] WAS LOOKING AT HIMSELF DIFFERENTLY THAN
[1:18:19] THE WAY GOD WAS LOOKING AT HIM. COME ON
[1:18:21] NOW. NOW, AND WE GOT TO GET OUR FOCUS IN
[1:18:24] LINE WITH THE word of the LORD AND SAY,
[1:18:26] "I ACCEPT IT. I CAN'T DO IT, BUT YOU CAN
[1:18:30] DO IT THROUGH ME. GREATER IS HE THAT IS
[1:18:33] IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. I
[1:18:36] CAN DO IT, BUT I'M believing you can do
[1:18:39] it." HALLELUJAH. MY SHEEP will hear my
[1:18:42] VOICE AND A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT
[1:18:44] FOLLOW. SO ONCE YOU BECOME A STRANGER TO
[1:18:48] THE WORLD, THEN the world becomes a
[1:18:50] stranger to you. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE
[1:18:51] MANY TIMES THE word's a stranger to us
[1:18:54] because we're NOT A STRANGER TO THE
[1:18:56] WORLD. YOU SEE, YOU CAN'T BE A STRANGER
[1:18:58] TO BOTH. YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO BE A
[1:19:00] STRANGER to the world or a stranger to
[1:19:02] THE VOICE OF GOD. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:19:05] A STRANGER TO THE TO THE WORD. I WANT TO
[1:19:07] KNOW THE WORD BECAUSE THE WORD ALREADY
[1:19:09] KNOWS ME. LET ME ACCEPT IT AND GET INTO
[1:19:12] IT. You know, you remember the story of
[1:19:14] the two walking to the road to Emmas.
[1:19:17] The Bible would tell us that that that
[1:19:18] they were discouraged. THEY WERE THEY
[1:19:20] WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY THOUGHT
[1:19:22] CHRIST WAS the Messiah. Y'all remember
[1:19:24] the story AND HOW THAT THE BIBLE WOULD
[1:19:27] SAY THAT CHRIST HIMSELF would draw near
[1:19:29] unto them AND WOULD SAY, "WHAT COMM WHAT
[1:19:32] MANNER OF COMMUNICATIONS are these that
[1:19:35] ye are sad?" AND IT'S INCREDIBLE TO
[1:19:38] THINK HOW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:19:40] WORD, BUT yet they WERE SAD.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; OH MY. SOMETIMES CHURCH MEMBERS CAN GET
[1:19:45] THAT WAY. WE TALK ABOUT THE WORD. WE CAN
[1:19:47] QUOTE THE WORD. BUT YET WE'RE
[1:19:49] DISCOURAGED. WE'RE BEAT DOWN. YOU KNOW
[1:19:51] WHY? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YOURSELF IN THE
[1:19:54] BOOK YET. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
[1:19:56] CHRIST WOULD REBUKE THEM. HE HE WOULD
[1:19:58] FIRST ASK THEM, "WHAT MAN WHAT MANNER OF
[1:20:00] communications are these THAT YE ARE
[1:20:02] SAD?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY TELL JESUS?
[1:20:04] THE VERY ONE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT COMES
[1:20:06] INTO THEIR MIDST. AND THEY WOULD SAY to
[1:20:08] him, "ARE YOU A STRANGER IN these
[1:20:10] parts?" HERE, THE ONE THEY'RE TALKING
[1:20:13] ABOUT COME TO THEM. and yet he was a
[1:20:15] STRANGER TO HIM. OH, I DON'T WANT GOD TO
[1:20:18] COME AND TRYING TO ANSWER MY QUESTION
[1:20:20] AND YET HE'S A STRANGER TO ME. BUT THE
[1:20:23] BIBLE SAYS HE WOULD REBUKE THEM, OH
[1:20:25] FOOLS AND SLOW OF HEART TO BELIEVE ALL
[1:20:28] THAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SPOKEN OF ME. AND
[1:20:30] THE BIBLE WOULD SAY HE WOULD GO THROUGH
[1:20:32] THE BIBLE OR THE scrolls speaking of
[1:20:35] himself. And yet they would come about
[1:20:37] the evening time that he WAS GOING TO
[1:20:39] WALK BY THE HOUSE. AND WHAT WOULD THOSE
[1:20:41] TWO MEN DO? THEY WOULD STOP HIM AND
[1:20:44] WOULD SAY, "COME IN WITH US." Brother
[1:20:46] Brandham says right there THEY RECEIVED
[1:20:48] THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. THEY WOULD HE
[1:20:50] WOULD COME INTO THE HOUSE AND AS HE
[1:20:52] BROKE THE BREAD, THE BIBLE SAYS THEIR
[1:20:55] EYES CAME OPEN. AND WATCH HOW THEIR
[1:20:58] CONFESSION CHANGED. THEIR CONFESSION
[1:21:00] WENT FROM BEING DISCOURAGED, HOW THEY
[1:21:03] THOUGHT HE WAS THE WORD, HOW THEY
[1:21:04] THOUGHT HE was going to do it TO DID NOT
[1:21:06] OUR HEART BURN WITHIN US AS HE TALKED
[1:21:09] WITH US ALONG THE WAY. THEY WENT FROM
[1:21:12] TALKING ABOUT THE WORD TO THE WORD
[1:21:14] TALKING TO THEM BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED
[1:21:17] IT. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT CAN
[1:21:20] HAPPEN ON A SUNDAY MORNING. IT GO FROM A
[1:21:22] PREACHER JUST TALKING ABOUT IT TO THAT
[1:21:24] PREACHER SPEAKING A WORD THAT CAN SPEAK
[1:21:27] TO YOUR HEART BECAUSE YOU RECEIVED IT.
[1:21:29] AND IT CAN TAKE YOU FROM A GLOOMY
[1:21:31] ATMOSPHERE AND PLACE A FIRE ON THE
[1:21:34] INSIDE OF YOUR HEART THAT YOU CAN SAY,
[1:21:36] "GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE
[1:21:39] THAT IS IN THE WORLD." I ONCE WAS
[1:21:41] DISCOURAGED, BUT NOW THERE'S A FIRE ON
[1:21:44] THE INSIDE OF MY HEART BECAUSE HE SPOKE
[1:21:46] TO ME.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEN THE BIBLE WOULD
[1:21:49] TELL US A FEW verses later THAT THESE
[1:21:51] TWO MEN WOULD GO BACK TO THE DISCIPLES
[1:21:54] AND WOULD TALK TO THEM about what Christ
[1:21:56] told them along the way. And the Bible
[1:21:58] says as they were talking about him,
[1:22:01] Christ appeared in the room and said,
[1:22:03] "Peace be unto you." AND I THOUGHT, OH
[1:22:06] MY, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH A BELIEVER.
[1:22:08] WHEN THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH GOD, YOU
[1:22:10] CAN TALK ABOUT HIM AND THEN HE COMES IN
[1:22:13] THE MIDST OF YOUR SITUATION AND BRINGS A
[1:22:16] PEACE to him. HE CAN BRING A CALM TO THE
[1:22:18] SITUATION. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE THAT
[1:22:21] GOD STARTED TALKING TO them and they
[1:22:23] received it.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then it was a claim over
[1:22:28] every situation they would go through.
[1:22:30] AND SO MY SHEEP WILL HEAR my voice. I
[1:22:33] know them and they follow me. You
[1:22:35] remember when brother Brandham was over
[1:22:37] in the Middle East and how that that
[1:22:39] there was a herd of sheep that was going
[1:22:41] through that going through the road and
[1:22:42] how they were at a four-way stop and it
[1:22:45] brother Brandham says the sheep are
[1:22:46] watching the shepherd and they WERE
[1:22:48] WALKING BUT THEN they would go into a
[1:22:50] through a market and brother Brandham
[1:22:51] would tell us their markets it's like
[1:22:53] our farmers market everything is on the
[1:22:55] outside and upon the pavement or upon
[1:22:58] their on their streets and brother
[1:23:00] Brandon would say to himself oh this is
[1:23:01] going to be crazy. HE SAYS ONCE THOSE
[1:23:04] SHEEP BEGIN TO SEE ALL OF THE FRUIT, ALL
[1:23:06] OF THE VEGETABLES, ALL OF THAT BREAD, HE
[1:23:08] SAYS THEY'RE not going to follow the
[1:23:09] shepherd no more. But he says AS HE WAS
[1:23:12] WATCHING, THOSE SHEEP never looked to
[1:23:14] the left or to the right, but they
[1:23:16] looked AT ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE
[1:23:18] SHEPHERD. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, I
[1:23:20] COULD HAVE STOPPED AND PREACHED A SERMON
[1:23:21] TO THOSE SHEEP RIGHT THEN. HE SAYS, "MY
[1:23:24] SHEEP WILL KNOW MY VOICE." AND SO THERE
[1:23:27] WAS MANY attractions out there that
[1:23:30] could have pulled their attention BUT
[1:23:32] YET THEY WERE FOLLOWING ONE THING AND
[1:23:34] THAT WAS THE SHEPHERD. AND I'M SO
[1:23:36] THANKFUL THAT HE'S THE GOOD SHEPHERD.
[1:23:39] You remember brother Brown tell us that
[1:23:40] there's a difference between a between a
[1:23:42] herdsman and a shepherd. He says the
[1:23:45] HERDSMAN OR HIRELAND HE SAYS IS with the
[1:23:47] sheep during the day but at night time
[1:23:50] HE GOES INTO THE HOUSE. BUT HE SAYS A
[1:23:52] SHEPHERD is with the sheep during the
[1:23:55] day and AT NIGHT TIME HE BECOMES THE
[1:23:58] DOOR. HALLELUJAH. SO WE DON'T GOT A GOOD
[1:24:01] HERDSMAN OR A GOOD HIRELAND. WE GOT THE
[1:24:03] GOOD SHEPHERD THAT IS GOING TO BE WITH
[1:24:05] YOU IN THE GOOD TIMES. BUT ALSO IN THE
[1:24:08] BAD TIMES HE BECOMES THE DOOR. IT WAS
[1:24:10] JESUS THAT WOULD SAY I AM THE DOOR OF
[1:24:13] THE SHEEP AND NO MAN NO NOTHING CAN COME
[1:24:16] IN UNLESS THAT'S THROUGH ME. WHAT IS IT?
[1:24:19] HE'S NOT WITH YOU JUST IN THE GOOD
[1:24:20] TIMES, BUT IN THE BAD TIMES, THE ONLY
[1:24:23] WAY A TRIAL CAN GET TO YOU IS TO BE
[1:24:25] COMING THROUGH HIM.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRAND, I'M GOING
[1:24:30] TELL US THAT GOD WOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE
[1:24:32] IN JOB. It was Job THAT WOULD TELL
[1:24:34] SATAN, "HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT
[1:24:37] JOB?" HE WAS STILL A GOOD SHEPHERD. EVEN
[1:24:40] WHEN JOB WAS ON THE ASH HEAP, HE WAS
[1:24:43] STILL A GOOD SHEPHERD. HE KNEW THAT JOB
[1:24:45] COULD LAST THE COURSE OF TIME. HE KNEW
[1:24:48] JOB MIGHT GO THROUGH HELL. HE MAY GO
[1:24:50] THROUGH MANY THINGS, BUT YET he was
[1:24:52] going TO STAND. AND SOMETIMES YOU GO
[1:24:55] through things and you don't feel like
[1:24:56] you can take another step. YOU FEEL LIKE
[1:24:58] YOU'RE ABOUT to lose your mind. You feel
[1:25:00] like your world HAS FALLEN APART. BUT
[1:25:03] YET, HE'S STILL THE GOOD SHEPHERD. CUZ
[1:25:05] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE KNEW HOW MUCH
[1:25:07] HE COULD TRUST JOB. AND THEN HE STOPS
[1:25:09] AND HE SAYS, "AND HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE
[1:25:12] CAN TRUST YOU. HE'S STILL THE GOOD
[1:25:14] SHEPHERD. HE KNOWS YOU CAN MAKE IT. HE
[1:25:17] KNOWS YOU EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
[1:25:19] ALL ALONE. IT WAS GOD THAT WAS SAID TO
[1:25:21] JOB, "WHERE WAS YOU, JOB, WHEN I LAID
[1:25:24] THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD, WHERE WAS
[1:25:26] YOU, JOB, WHEN THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTED
[1:25:29] FOR JOY? YOU WAS IN MY MIND, AND THERE'S
[1:25:32] NOTHING THAT CAN TAKE YOU FROM GOING
[1:25:34] BACK TO MY MIND."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO
[1:25:37] INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS message is this
[1:25:39] message would show us our future. IT
[1:25:41] WOULD SHOW US THAT IT WOULD SHOW US HOW
[1:25:43] HOW THERE'S NOTHING PRESENT THAT CAN
[1:25:45] KEEP US DOWN. But it also took us back
[1:25:48] to the mind of God and would say you was
[1:25:51] in THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE HE WHEN HE WAS
[1:25:53] GOD ALONE, you was with HIM IN HIS
[1:25:55] THOUGHTS.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S A COMFORT IN
[1:25:58] KNOWING THAT NO MATTER WHAT MY PRESENT
[1:26:01] condition is, I was already in THE MIND
[1:26:03] OF GOD AND HE KNOWS THE THOUGHTS THAT HE
[1:26:06] THINKS TOWARDS ME. HALLELUJAH. And so
[1:26:09] it's a it's an incredible thing what God
[1:26:12] has done for us in THIS GENERATION. IT'S
[1:26:15] ACCEPTING THE word of the Lord and
[1:26:17] following the word of the Lord. And and
[1:26:19] you can look at Moses. The Bible would
[1:26:21] say in Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith Moses
[1:26:25] when he was come to years refused to be
[1:26:28] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:26:31] AND I THINK THAT'S POWERFUL BECAUSE IT
[1:26:33] WAS WHEN he had come of years or
[1:26:35] maturity that there would be a
[1:26:37] separation take place that he refused
[1:26:40] the identity of Pharaoh's DAUGHTER AND
[1:26:43] WOULD ACCEPT the identity of a stranger.
[1:26:46] And it's incredible because I believe
[1:26:48] THAT THE BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE as well.
[1:26:51] Well, we're not just some some some
[1:26:53] immature bride, but this word we've been
[1:26:55] ripening under. And brother Brandon
[1:26:58] would tell us that he was says tears
[1:27:00] already maturing very fast under corrupt
[1:27:03] teachers who can turn the people from
[1:27:05] the word. But the wheat is the wheat
[1:27:08] also must mature and to her. NOT TO JUST
[1:27:12] ANYBODY BUT TO HER. GOD IS SENDING THE
[1:27:16] PROPHET MESSENGER WITH A VINDICATED
[1:27:18] MINISTRY THAT HE MIGHT BE ACCEPTED BY
[1:27:22] the elect. and they will hear him as the
[1:27:25] first church heard Paul and she will
[1:27:28] mature in the word until becoming a word
[1:27:31] bride and the mighty works will be found
[1:27:34] in her. So I believe that THIS THAT THIS
[1:27:37] BRIDE HAS been maturing under the word
[1:27:40] of the hour and I believe she has come
[1:27:42] of age and you remember WHENEVER THE
[1:27:44] BIBLE WOULD tell us how how there was a
[1:27:46] blind man that Jesus would come and open
[1:27:49] his eyes. Y'all remember the story and
[1:27:51] that the Jews, the Bible says the Jews
[1:27:53] would go to his parents and would say,
[1:27:54] "Was this your son that was blind?" And
[1:27:56] they would say, "Yep, that's our son."
[1:27:58] Y'all remember that? And how that the
[1:28:00] Jews would ask the parents, "How did he
[1:28:03] receive HIS SIGHT? AND WHAT would the
[1:28:05] parents tell the Jews? ASK HIM. HE'S OF
[1:28:08] AGE. HE CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF. HE'S OF
[1:28:12] AGE. ASK HIM. HE SHALL SPEAK FOR
[1:28:15] HIMSELF." IN OTHER WORDS, HE WAS MATURE
[1:28:18] ENOUGH to speak FOR HIMSELF. AND THE
[1:28:21] BIBLE WOULD SAY that that the the that
[1:28:22] the Jews would come back to the man
[1:28:24] would would bring him to the synagogue
[1:28:26] and would say, "This man Jesus, HE'S A
[1:28:28] SINNER. HE'S THIS AND HE'S THAT." AND
[1:28:30] WHAT WOULD THE blind man say? HE WOULD
[1:28:32] SAY, "I HE'S A SINNER OR NO, I DON'T
[1:28:34] KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW
[1:28:38] I SEE." THERE WAS AN AUTHORITY BEHIND
[1:28:41] HIM SPEAKING BECAUSE HE HAD EXPERIENCED
[1:28:44] IT. COME ON NOW. AND I BELIEVE THIS
[1:28:46] BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE WHERE SHE CAN
[1:28:49] SPEAK FOR HERSELF. SHE'S RECEIVED THE
[1:28:52] WORD. And brother Brandham says, "As you
[1:28:54] receive THE WORD, YOU BECOME THE WORD.
[1:28:56] YOU WILL BECOME THE FINAL VOICE TO THE
[1:28:58] FINAL GENERATION UNDER HER MESSENGER."
[1:29:01] WHAT IS IT? YOU'VE BEEN MATURING UNDER
[1:29:04] RECEIVING THE WORD AND YOU'VE COME OF
[1:29:06] AGE. AND YOUR VOICE IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S
[1:29:09] VOICE.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT JUST SOME
[1:29:12] PENTECOSTALS that are speaking for a
[1:29:14] car, speaking for this, SPEAKING FOR
[1:29:16] THAT. BUT WE'RE TAKING UP THE WORD OF
[1:29:18] THE LORD. YOU'RE JOHN. GO TAKE THE BOOK,
[1:29:20] EAT THE BOOK, PROPHESY AGAIN. IN OTHER
[1:29:23] WORDS, YOU'RE PICKING UP THE WORD AS
[1:29:25] YOU'RE RECEIVING THE WORD. THAT WORD
[1:29:27] COMES ON YOUR LIPS
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SPEAK THY WORD AND IT'S A
[1:29:31] CREATIVE WORD THAT CAN CHANGE
[1:29:33] SITUATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WORD
[1:29:35] CAN STILL BREAK THE THE BINDS OF OF
[1:29:37] PRODICAL SONS AND BRING THEM BACK TO THE
[1:29:40] HOUSE OF GOD. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF THE
[1:29:42] LORD CAN STILL BREAK DEPRESSION OVER
[1:29:45] PEOPLE'S LIVES. HE CAN STILL BREAK
[1:29:47] ANXIETY OVER PEOPLE'S LIVES. IT'S a word
[1:29:50] THAT CAN CLAIM
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE WORD IS NOW ON your
[1:29:54] lips. I say YOU SPEAK THE WORD.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK THE CREATIVE WORD AND AND IT'S
[1:30:00] AS GOOD as God speaking. And brother
[1:30:01] Brandham must tell us that it's as good
[1:30:03] as deity speaking when you speak the
[1:30:05] word of the Lord.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT A PENTECOSTAL IDEA, A
[1:30:09] PROSPERITY GOSPEL THERE THAT WE'VE
[1:30:11] ALREADY BEEN SEPARATED from the
[1:30:12] Pentecostals. You brother Joel, I was
[1:30:14] told the other day that the that the
[1:30:16] bride ain't adopted yet because the
[1:30:18] Pentecostals haven't separated yet. I
[1:30:21] said, I I believe we're I'm adopted. I
[1:30:23] DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I'M I'M PLACED IN
[1:30:25] AUTHORITY. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT
[1:30:27] is the adoption? It's it's that you it's
[1:30:29] in your position. It's God placing you
[1:30:31] where you're a manifested son. He would
[1:30:34] say that the voice that the that God
[1:30:36] would bring his voice to the bride and
[1:30:38] he would say THAT THE BRIDE ACCEPTS IT.
[1:30:40] SHE DON'T REFUSE IT. SHE DON'T DOUBT IT.
[1:30:42] SHE ACCEPTS IT AND HE KNOW OR SHE KNOWS
[1:30:45] what he wants done with the word. See,
[1:30:48] THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:30:50] GOD WANTS DONE with this word. We're not
[1:30:52] just running around speaking things, but
[1:30:54] under the inspiration of the word, we
[1:30:57] can take the word AND SPEAK THE PROMISES
[1:30:59] OF GOD AND HAVE A CONFIDENCE. Brother
[1:31:02] Brandon would say when you speak the
[1:31:04] word or when you pray, what's your
[1:31:05] motive and objective? Right? He says if
[1:31:08] you want healing, what are you going to
[1:31:09] do with your healing? You see, BUT THE
[1:31:11] BRIDE KNOWS WHAT GOD WANTS done with the
[1:31:13] word AND OUR AMBITION IS HIS AMBITION.
[1:31:17] Our motives is his motives. OR
[1:31:19] OBJECTIVES IS HIS OBJECTIVES AND GOD
[1:31:22] KNOWS THAT ONCE YOU RECEIVE the word we
[1:31:25] come in line with what HE WANTS DONE
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because
[1:31:30] brother Brandham he would tell us that
[1:31:32] he says there would be a time come forth
[1:31:34] when he could express himself in the
[1:31:36] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:31:39] his church have the preeminence in this
[1:31:41] church he says oh my what the anointed
[1:31:44] man now the ANOINTED PEOPLE OH MY TO
[1:31:48] BRING BACK THE ANOINTED ED BRIDE AND THE
[1:31:50] BRIDEGROOM ANOINTED by what? Accepting
[1:31:53] what Eve TURNED DOWN. YOU SEE THE POWER
[1:31:56] OF ACCEPTING. WHEN YOU ACCEPT WHAT?
[1:31:59] WHAT? WHAT? EVE TURNED DOWN. Then
[1:32:01] there's a union
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; that begins to take place. And brother
[1:32:04] Brandham would tell us this is the
[1:32:06] uniting time. He says what's the bride
[1:32:08] uniting herself up with the word which
[1:32:10] is the bridegroom. AND SO HERE WE ARE.
[1:32:13] WE'RE living in the uniting time where
[1:32:15] whether the World Council of Churches is
[1:32:17] uniting with the Roman Catholic Church,
[1:32:20] but yet the bride is uniting with
[1:32:22] something else, which is the word of the
[1:32:25] hour. And I believe that we're living in
[1:32:27] the time of adoption. Do you believe
[1:32:29] that this morning? That we're living in
[1:32:31] the hour of manifested son. We're living
[1:32:33] in the TIME WHERE WHERE GOD IS PLACING
[1:32:36] his loved ones or his children in their
[1:32:38] inheritance. That that that that you can
[1:32:41] speak the word. And and brother
[1:32:42] Brandham, HE WOULD TELL us that THAT
[1:32:44] WHENEVER THE SON was to be adopted and
[1:32:46] and placed, he says THAT SON WOULD BE
[1:32:49] ADOPTED into the same family that he is
[1:32:52] born into. That's why with the brand of
[1:32:54] Matelis that our adoption is not our new
[1:32:57] birth, right? We were placed where we're
[1:32:59] born into a family, but one spirit were
[1:33:01] baptized INTO ONE BODY, BUT THEN it's
[1:33:04] going to take something to place us into
[1:33:07] our inheritance. And brother Brown was
[1:33:09] saved. Then if that child was obedient,
[1:33:12] there's a set there then there's a set A
[1:33:14] CERTAIN DAY WHEN HE BECOMES of age. NOW
[1:33:17] THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH OUGHT TO BE OF
[1:33:20] age 40 years or BETTER ABOUT 50. SO IT
[1:33:23] SHOULD be of age. SO HE'S SAYING THAT
[1:33:26] THAT THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH THEY THEY'VE
[1:33:28] come up to the HOLY GHOST BUT HE SAYS
[1:33:30] THEY haven't come up to age yet where
[1:33:32] they can be placed. He was saying in one
[1:33:35] place that the Pentecostals did the same
[1:33:37] thing as the other churches. they would
[1:33:39] denominate. But then he says out of them
[1:33:42] GOD WOULD CALL HIS SONS THAT ARE
[1:33:44] STANDING FOR THE WORD. SO WE'RE NOT
[1:33:47] PENTECOSTALS, WE'RE THE BRIDE. WE'RE NOT
[1:33:49] STUMBLING AROUND IN a Pentecostal church
[1:33:52] age, but we've been placed into a bride
[1:33:54] age AND PLACED INTO OUR INHERITANCE
[1:33:58] WHERE YOU NAME IS AS GOOD AS PAPA GOD'S.
[1:34:01] AND THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[1:34:02] TELL US THAT WHENEVER THE SON WOULD BE
[1:34:05] ADOPTED, his name is as GOOD ON THAT
[1:34:07] CHECK AS PAPA IS. AND THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:34:10] BRIDE OF CHRIST IS. Your name is AS GOOD
[1:34:14] AS GOD'S HIMSELF. THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK
[1:34:16] THE WORD, YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS DONE WITH
[1:34:18] THE WORD AND YOU DO IT. BROTHER BRANDON
[1:34:20] WOULD TELL US YOU DO IT IN HIS NAME. AND
[1:34:23] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER Brandham
[1:34:25] would tell us that in the beginning God
[1:34:27] was alone. But he says, "But in Genesis
[1:34:29] 2, he was no longer the self-existent
[1:34:32] one, BUT NOW HE'S JEHOVAH." AND BROTHER
[1:34:34] BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT'S that mean? HE'S
[1:34:36] NOT SELF-EXISTENT no more, BUT NOW HE'S
[1:34:39] EXISTING WITH A FAMILY." HALLELUJAH. SO
[1:34:42] HE'S NOT GOD ALONE ANYMORE, BUT NOW HE'S
[1:34:44] GOD IN A FAMILY. HE'S GOD IN A YOUNG
[1:34:47] PERSON. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE COME TO
[1:34:49] DO. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:34:51] revealed. WHERE WHERE'S HE BEING
[1:34:52] REVEALED AT? THROUGH CHRIST. NOW IN THE
[1:34:54] BRIDE. NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE
[1:34:56] GARDEN OF EDEN. WHAT is it? THIS MESSAGE
[1:34:58] COME TO PULL OUT THE POTENTIALS THAT
[1:35:01] WERE LAYING ON THE INSIDE THAT YOU WERE
[1:35:04] RELENTED FOR THIS.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I PREDESTINATED THE BODY
[1:35:09] UPON THE EARTH and you ARE THE
[1:35:11] MANIFESTATION OF THAT THOUGHT THAT I HAD
[1:35:14] IN MY MIND.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This message IS A POWERFUL
[1:35:18] MESSAGE. ARE YOU THANKFUL FOR WHAT GOD
[1:35:20] HAS DONE IN THIS GENERATION THAT WE CAN
[1:35:23] FEED UPON THE WORD, THE BODY WORD OF THE
[1:35:25] SON OF MAN? AND AS WE FEED ON THE WORD,
[1:35:28] WE START TO SEE OUREL IN A DIFFERENT
[1:35:30] WAY. You remember the boy that never
[1:35:32] seen himself before? Never seen a mirror
[1:35:34] before. Y'all remember that story?
[1:35:36] Brother Brandon MATTAIL HAD NEVER SEEN
[1:35:38] HIMSELF BEFORE. SO HE WOULD GO to his
[1:35:39] aunt's house, I believe, and he would
[1:35:41] see a mirror, right? AND HE WOULD WAVE.
[1:35:43] THE BOY WOULD WAVE. HE WOULD JUMP. THE
[1:35:46] BOY WOULD JUMP. AND HE WAS EXCITED CUZ
[1:35:48] THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY. BUT WHAT WOULD
[1:35:50] HAPPEN? THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THAT
[1:35:52] MIRROR, THE TOMB BECAME ONE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:56] AND A REVELATION STRUCK THAT BOY'S
[1:35:58] HEART. MAMA, THAT BOY IS ME. AND THAT'S
[1:36:01] THE REVELATION THAT THIS BRIDE IS
[1:36:03] GETTING. IT AIN'T YOU AND THE BRIDE. BUT
[1:36:06] THE CLOSER YOU GET INTO THIS WORD, YOU
[1:36:09] SAY, "MAMA, THAT IS ME." THAT'S WHAT'S
[1:36:12] HAPPENING. WHEN YOUR PASTOR'S PREACHING
[1:36:14] AND YOU SAY, "AMEN." YOU'RE SAYING,
[1:36:15] "PREACHER, THAT'S ME." IT'S NOT THE
[1:36:18] BRIDE AND YOU. BUT YOU'RE SAYING, "I AM
[1:36:20] THE BRIDE." IT'S NOT A RAPTURING
[1:36:22] GENERATION AND YOU. TWO SEPARATE THINGS,
[1:36:25] BUT YOU ARE THE FULFILLMENT OF IT.
[1:36:27] SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES, FOR THEM TESTIFY
[1:36:30] OF WHO I AM.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE TWO HAVE BECOME ONE.
[1:36:35] HALLELUJAH. I and my father are one. And
[1:36:38] I believe the bride and the bridegroom
[1:36:40] have has come together and they become
[1:36:42] one. I believe you've become the word.
[1:36:45] Hallelujah. You believe that this
[1:36:46] morning that you have become the word.
[1:36:49] So, brother Brandon would say, here's
[1:36:50] the secret. The word is in the bride and
[1:36:53] the mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:36:55] done with the word and she does it in
[1:36:58] his name. She has thus saith the Lord.
[1:37:01] And and SO WHAT'S SO SO significant
[1:37:04] about his name? Why why do we have to
[1:37:06] take on his name? And and I and I won't
[1:37:08] be much longer because brother Brown
[1:37:10] would teach us that your name
[1:37:12] characterizes who you are. Right? He
[1:37:15] would say that if your son is named
[1:37:17] Ricky or Elvis, what would he say?
[1:37:19] Change the name. because it
[1:37:20] characterizes who they are. AND THE
[1:37:23] BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT JACOB
[1:37:25] WOULD BE CHANGED to Israel, Simon to
[1:37:28] Peter, and Saul to Paul. And what would
[1:37:30] brother Brandham tell us at the opening
[1:37:32] of the seals? He would say, "I'm not
[1:37:34] GOING TO CALL YOU CHURCH." RIGHT? BUT
[1:37:36] WHAT WOULD HE SAY? I'M GOING TO CALL YOU
[1:37:38] BRIDE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE not going
[1:37:40] to have the life of a church member, but
[1:37:43] now you're going to have the life OF
[1:37:44] CHRIST HIMSELF. Because that name
[1:37:47] becomes a characteristic. The Bible
[1:37:49] would tell us in the in in the book of
[1:37:51] Acts 15-14,
[1:37:53] Simeon hath declared how God the first
[1:37:56] did visit the Gentiles to take out of
[1:37:59] them a people for his name. And brother
[1:38:02] Brand tell us thus concerning this day
[1:38:05] that God is calling a people for his
[1:38:07] name. And and if you look at the word
[1:38:09] name in in the Strong's concordance, it
[1:38:12] means reputation, fame, or glory. So in
[1:38:16] other words, God's calling a people for
[1:38:18] his reputation, for his glory. Brother
[1:38:21] Brandon would tell us that that God will
[1:38:23] always have a witness upon the earth,
[1:38:25] right? That the that the that the David
[1:38:26] was a witness, that the the patriarchs
[1:38:28] were witnesses, but now God has a
[1:38:30] witness upon the earth for his name's
[1:38:33] sake. And so the reputation of the Lord,
[1:38:36] I don't believe, is just FLOATING
[1:38:38] AROUND, BUT WE'RE living out the life.
[1:38:41] WE'RE LIVING OUT THE GLORY. That's what
[1:38:42] the Bible would say. RISE AND SHINE FOR
[1:38:44] THY LIGHT HAS COME. THE GLORY OF THE
[1:38:46] LORD has risen UPON THEE AND SHALL BE
[1:38:48] SEEN UPON THEE. YOU REMEMBER HOW ZAKIUS
[1:38:52] THE BIBLE SAYS HE SOUGHT TO SEE WHO
[1:38:54] JESUS WAS. He sought to see Jesus who he
[1:38:57] was. So he didn't want to JUST SEE THE
[1:38:59] BODY OF JESUS. HE WANTED to see who
[1:39:02] Jesus was. HE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THAT
[1:39:05] REPUTATION. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US
[1:39:07] THAT THAT THAT JESUS would come to
[1:39:09] Zakius's house. Right? Y'all still with
[1:39:11] me this morning? how that the that Jesus
[1:39:14] comes to Zakius's HOUSE AND THE BIBLE
[1:39:16] WOULD TELL US THAT JESUS would leave
[1:39:18] Zakius's HOUSE, BUT THE GLORY OF the
[1:39:21] Lord WOULD REMAIN BECAUSE SOMETHING
[1:39:23] WOULD CHANGE IN ZAKIUS'S LIFE. THE BIBLE
[1:39:26] WOULD TELL us that he would do all the
[1:39:28] people that he done wrong to, he would
[1:39:31] go and make it right. SO, THE BODY
[1:39:33] DIDN'T DO IT. THE GLORY OF THE LORD DONE
[1:39:36] IT. AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE CORPORAL
[1:39:38] BODY OF JESUS CHRIST HERE TODAY, BUT HIS
[1:39:41] GLORY, HIS REPUTATION HAS COME UPON US.
[1:39:45] AND JUST LIKE ZAKIUS, WE'RE BEING
[1:39:47] CHANGED BY DAY BY DAY. WHEN WE GET UP IN
[1:39:50] the morning AND WE FEED UPON THE WORD,
[1:39:53] IT'S CHANGING US.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S GOT TO BE CHANGES
[1:39:57] TAKE PLACE. You remember whenever
[1:39:58] Lazarus when Jesus would say Lazarus
[1:40:01] come forth, he had life in his body. HE
[1:40:03] WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE. THE VOICE of the
[1:40:05] resurrection brought him to life. But he
[1:40:07] came out of the tomb and was still in
[1:40:10] grave clothes. So even THOUGH HE WAS
[1:40:12] ALIVE, HE HAD TO GIVE UP SOME THINGS.
[1:40:14] HALLELUJAH. And even though WE'RE ALIVE,
[1:40:17] WE STILL HAVE TO GIVE UP some things.
[1:40:19] AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD MAKE HIM GIVE
[1:40:21] UP those things? IT WAS THE SAME VOICE
[1:40:24] THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SAY, "LAZARUS,
[1:40:26] COME FORTH WAS THAT SAME VOICE THAT
[1:40:28] WOULD COMMISSION A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY."
[1:40:31] JESUS WOULD SAY loose him and let him
[1:40:34] go. So Jesus wasn't loosening him, BUT
[1:40:36] HE WAS COMMISSIONING A FIVE-FOLD
[1:40:39] MINISTRY TO LOOSEN HIM. AND WHAT HAPPENS
[1:40:41] EVERY TIME YOUR PASTOR IS GETTING up and
[1:40:44] preaches AND AND THESE OTHER MINISTERS
[1:40:46] GETS UP AND PREACHES. YOU ALREADY BEEN
[1:40:48] BROUGHT TO LIFE, BUT THAT VOICE, THAT
[1:40:50] WORD IS UNWRAPPING YOU FROM those grave
[1:40:53] clothes THAT WE ARE BECOMING MORE AND
[1:40:56] MORE LIKE HIM. GOD WANTS TO SEEK HIS
[1:40:59] REFLECTION. WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU, HE
[1:41:01] WANTS TO SEEK HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE
[1:41:03] THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. BUT THE
[1:41:05] PREACHING OF THE WORD IS PERFECTING THE
[1:41:07] SAINTS. AND EVERY TIME GOD LOOKS AT YOU,
[1:41:10] HE SEES HIMSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU
[1:41:12] LOOK AT THE WORD, YOU SEE YOURSELF. WHAT
[1:41:15] IS IT? THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM HAS
[1:41:18] COME TOGETHER AND HAS UNITED.
[1:41:21] HALLELUJAH. The glory of the Lord has
[1:41:24] risen upon us. And it's at the
[1:41:26] proclaiming of THE NAME. WE'RE WE'RE
[1:41:28] taking on his name. And the Bible would
[1:41:30] tell us in Exodus 33:18 and he SAID,"I
[1:41:34] BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME thy glory." And he
[1:41:36] said, "I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS
[1:41:38] before thee, and I will proclaim the
[1:41:40] name of the Lord before thee, and will
[1:41:42] be gracious to whom I WILL BE GRACIOUS
[1:41:45] AND WILL SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW
[1:41:48] MERCY." IN OTHER WORDS, the grace of the
[1:41:50] Lord and the mercy of the Lord was going
[1:41:52] to be poured out at the proclaiming of
[1:41:55] that name.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would would tell
[1:41:57] us, he would bring it down to our day
[1:42:00] and would say, "What is the
[1:42:01] manifestation of the name of God?" What
[1:42:03] would he say? The word being interpreted
[1:42:06] is the manifestation of the name of God.
[1:42:09] So when HIS WORD WAS INTERPRETED, THAT
[1:42:11] WAS THE PROCLAIMING OF THE NAME OF THE
[1:42:14] LORD THAT YOU COULD HAVE GRACE AND MERCY
[1:42:17] IN THIS GENERATION. Cuz you remember
[1:42:19] whenever whenever the the the the death
[1:42:21] angel was coming through the kingdom of
[1:42:22] of the Egyptians, could you imagine
[1:42:24] being Pharaoh thinking, man, how am I
[1:42:26] how can I stop this from taking over all
[1:42:28] the firstborn? Could you imagine maybe
[1:42:30] he would he would start to think but yet
[1:42:33] there was something so simple
[1:42:36] among them that could save them but they
[1:42:38] had no revelation of it. Brother
[1:42:40] Brandham would tell us now the Bible
[1:42:41] would tell us too that that you would
[1:42:43] take the hishup dip it in the blood
[1:42:45] right Brandon would say THAT HISSUP WAS
[1:42:48] A COMMON WEED in Palestine. So while the
[1:42:50] death angel was going through the land
[1:42:53] of Egypt, THERE WAS SOMETHING COMMON
[1:42:55] THAT COULD KEEP THAT FROM THEM, but it
[1:42:58] was not the the the grace of THE LORD
[1:43:01] WAS NOT GIVEN TO THE EGYPTIANS. But yet
[1:43:04] over in GOAN BY THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS
[1:43:06] NAME, THERE WAS A GRACE THAT WOULD SAY
[1:43:09] THERE'S SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT CAN
[1:43:11] SEPARATE YOU FROM THE JUDGMENTS THAT IS
[1:43:14] COMING ON THE LAND. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:43:16] WOULD TELL US WHAT WHAT IS HIP? IT'S A
[1:43:18] TYPE OF YOUR FAITH.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHILE THE WORLD IS
[1:43:22] FALLING APART, MARRIAGES ARE FALLING
[1:43:25] APART, WHILE PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR
[1:43:27] MIND, THE GRACE of the Lord HAS BEEN
[1:43:29] POURED OUT UPON YOU AND HAS RESTORED A
[1:43:32] FAITH AND FAITH IN THE WORD OF THE LORD
[1:43:35] IS SAYING, "COME UP HIGHER." AND AS
[1:43:37] YOU'RE RECEIVING IT, IT'S SEPARATING YOU
[1:43:39] FROM THE PLAGUES that is coming UPON THE
[1:43:42] LAND. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? BY THE
[1:43:44] PROCLAIMING OF MY NAME, I WILL BE
[1:43:46] GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS. I
[1:43:49] WILL BE MERCIFUL TO WHOM I WILL be
[1:43:51] merciful. HALLELUJAH. IT'S only the
[1:43:55] elected that has seen it. But at the
[1:43:57] proclaiming of his name, the brand was
[1:43:59] saying and the name is in the word
[1:44:01] because he is the word. Amen. What is he
[1:44:04] then? The word interpreted is the
[1:44:06] manifestation of the name of God. So at
[1:44:10] the proclaiming of his word or or the
[1:44:12] proclaiming of his name, I will be
[1:44:14] gracious to whom I will be gracious.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; What is it? You may BE A STRANGER, BUT
[1:44:19] YOU'RE an elected stranger.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that a powerful thing? But we can
[1:44:23] take on his name.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; It's incredible cuz brother Brown tell
[1:44:26] us that through the Old Testament, God
[1:44:29] had many titles. He was rose of Sharon,
[1:44:31] lily of the valley, THE BRIDE AND
[1:44:33] MORNING STAR. BUT WHEN CHRIST WOULD
[1:44:35] COME, he didn't say, "I'm the title of
[1:44:37] God." What would he say? I come in my
[1:44:40] father's name. So he came in the
[1:44:42] manifestation or the interpretation of
[1:44:45] the word. And with that name came
[1:44:47] authority. That's why the apostle Paul
[1:44:50] would say whatever you do in word or in
[1:44:52] deed do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:44:55] Christ. I believe we've taken on the
[1:44:57] name. Brother Brandon would teach us now
[1:44:59] that Abraham and I'm trying to bring
[1:45:01] this to a close. Give me a few more
[1:45:02] minutes. Brother Brandham teach us that
[1:45:04] Abraham had four steps of his journey.
[1:45:07] Right? He would say that justification
[1:45:09] was whenever God would call him out. And
[1:45:11] he says sanctification was whenever the
[1:45:14] the confirming of the covenant. Y'all
[1:45:16] remember that where where Abraham would
[1:45:17] get the different animals and would
[1:45:19] separate them. He says that was the
[1:45:21] second phase of his journey and that was
[1:45:23] sanctification which was Wesley. And he
[1:45:25] says then El Shadi was the baptism of
[1:45:28] the Holy Ghost which he says was
[1:45:29] Pentecost. But he says but then his name
[1:45:32] was changed WHICH IS THE FOUR STEPS OF
[1:45:34] THE JOURNEY. HE SAYS HIS NAME WAS
[1:45:36] CHANGED from Abram to Abraham. AND WHAT
[1:45:40] WAS THAT? Brother Brham would tell us
[1:45:42] THAT IT WAS ELOHIM, RIGHT? ELOHIM, the
[1:45:44] last part of Elohim was coming to
[1:45:47] humanity. So it was a it WAS A COMING
[1:45:49] TOGETHER OF HUMANITY and Elohim, WHICH
[1:45:53] WOULD CHANGE HIS NAME, WHICH WOULD PUT
[1:45:55] him in a position to fulfill the
[1:45:58] promise. And brother Brown was saying
[1:45:59] THAT WAS HIS ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH. We He
[1:46:02] didn't just justify us in this
[1:46:04] generation. HE DIDN'T JUST SANCTIFY US.
[1:46:06] HE didn't just fill you with the Holy
[1:46:08] Ghost. But he gave you his name that YOU
[1:46:11] CAN BE ADOPTED INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[1:46:14] THAT YOU ARE IN POSITION for the
[1:46:16] supernatural.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're in position for the
[1:46:20] supernatural. You believe that this
[1:46:22] morning? Brother Brown would say this
[1:46:24] here. God took Abraham out and placed
[1:46:26] the adoption upon him and changed his
[1:46:29] name from Abram to Abraham. Abraham
[1:46:32] comes from the word of Elohim, God's own
[1:46:34] name. He's he's he's associated his name
[1:46:36] with God's name. God is Elohim. How many
[1:46:39] knows that the great Jehovah Elohim, THE
[1:46:42] ALLSUFFICIENT ONE, THE SELF-EXISTENT
[1:46:44] ONE, he says, Elohim.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And so when he changed his name, he
[1:46:48] didn't change it to make it sound
[1:46:49] better. He changed him so he can be
[1:46:51] conditioned to see the promised child.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he didn't change your
[1:46:55] name just to make it sound better, but
[1:46:57] he changed it so you can be conditioned
[1:46:59] for the promised tri. So we're
[1:47:01] conditioned for a rapture. We're
[1:47:03] conditioned for a body change. We're
[1:47:05] conditioned for the greater works. The
[1:47:07] greater works wasn't WITH BROTHER
[1:47:08] BRANDON. YOU ARE THE GREATER WORKS.
[1:47:10] WE'RE CONDITIONED for it. And when we
[1:47:13] speak the word, it's God speaking
[1:47:15] through us. Let our musicians come this
[1:47:16] morning.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful for that? That God is
[1:47:20] speaking through a vessel. Once again,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham would say this here.
[1:47:25] Now your old book is gone with your old
[1:47:27] union. Now your name and your old, he
[1:47:29] says, has been transferred. Now you say,
[1:47:32] do you do you mean to tell me that my
[1:47:34] old book God put in the sea of his
[1:47:36] forgetfulness? He says, you stand
[1:47:38] perfectly before God. He says, now your
[1:47:41] name is, he says, now your name is now
[1:47:43] in the new book, not the book of life,
[1:47:46] but the lamb's book of life. What the
[1:47:48] book redeems. Now, the old book of your
[1:47:50] natural union, he says, but but your new
[1:47:53] bride, he says, hallelujah, your new
[1:47:55] life is in the lamb's book of life. And
[1:47:57] he says this here, your marriage
[1:47:59] certificate. So, how do you know that
[1:48:02] your name has been changed when a union
[1:48:04] take place? Right? My wife ain't called
[1:48:06] Loretta Mass no more. It's Loretta
[1:48:08] Martin. Her name is my name. Right? So,
[1:48:10] how do you know that your name is God's
[1:48:12] name? He says, "This message is your
[1:48:15] marriage certificate. If you can accept
[1:48:17] it and receive it and act it out, my
[1:48:19] sheep know my voice. I know them and
[1:48:21] they follow me. This is your marriage
[1:48:23] certificate. I say don't be discouraged
[1:48:25] this morning. Don't listen to the lies
[1:48:28] that the devil tells you that you're a
[1:48:29] nobody. That you'll never amount to
[1:48:31] anything. Come on now. That you can
[1:48:34] never see the promises of God fulfilled.
[1:48:36] That's a lie. Look at THIS MESSAGE. IT'S
[1:48:38] YOUR MARRIAGE certificate that proves to
[1:48:41] THE DEVIL THAT HE HAS an end and you
[1:48:43] have a future. He's going to be burning
[1:48:46] in the lake of fire, but yet you're
[1:48:47] going to be reigning. It's going to be
[1:48:48] you that's going to march over the ashes
[1:48:51] of the wicked. I say don't get weary and
[1:48:53] welloing. But keep on fighting. Keep on
[1:48:57] walking. This ain't the time to give up
[1:48:59] and give in and say I can't do it no
[1:49:01] more. But God has given you his name. I
[1:49:04] say you're in a place of authority. Act
[1:49:07] like it. Hold your head up high and say,
[1:49:09] "Satan, greater is he that is in me. I
[1:49:12] ain't listening to your lies any longer.
[1:49:14] I AIN'T LISTENING TO IT no longer. But I
[1:49:16] want to get into the word for myself and
[1:49:18] see who I am. It's who I am. It's who
[1:49:21] YOU ARE. YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST.
[1:49:24] YOU are the rapture. Brother Brand say
[1:49:26] that the rapture is within you now.
[1:49:28] THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE THE
[1:49:30] manifestation
[1:49:32] a manifested son and daughter of God.
[1:49:34] You believe that this morning? Let's bow
[1:49:36] our heads.
[1:49:38] Dear heavenly father,
[1:49:41] Lord, how we love you this morning.
[1:49:44] We're thankful for your mercies and your
[1:49:45] grace. Lord, thank you for proclaiming
[1:49:48] your name, proclaiming your word over us
[1:49:51] and would claim our lives. Father,
[1:49:54] would give us an ambition,
[1:49:57] Lord. Give us a future,
[1:50:00] Lord. If there's some here that might be
[1:50:02] weary,
[1:50:04] I ask that you would strengthen them,
[1:50:05] Lord.
[1:50:07] If there's some here that might not see
[1:50:08] them themselves in in this word yet,
[1:50:11] Lord, give them eyes to see. Lord, put
[1:50:14] some eyes out on them that they may see.
[1:50:19] Lord, if there's some here that is weary
[1:50:21] in faith,
[1:50:23] Lord, strengthen that faith. Like the
[1:50:26] man that would come to Jesus and would
[1:50:28] say, "I believe, but help my unbelief."
[1:50:30] Lord, sometimes we just get weary,
[1:50:34] but Lord, where your spirit is, there's
[1:50:36] strength.
[1:50:37] Father, I ask that you would uplift the
[1:50:39] feeble hands. Lord,
[1:50:42] we love you and we're thankful for your
[1:50:43] mercies and your grace in Jesus name.
[1:50:48] Amen.
[1:50:51] I gra
[1:50:53] this this morning. I know that he
[1:50:58] took my place
[1:51:02] so that I through
[1:51:05] his love could take his
[1:51:16] beame
[1:51:19] so that I might
[1:51:22] become him
[1:51:25] by singing us this morning.
[1:51:30] I know that he
[1:51:33] became me
[1:51:37] so that I might
[1:51:40] become him by grace.
[1:51:48] Oh, he
[1:51:50] became me
[1:51:54] so that I might
[1:51:57] become him
[1:52:00] by grace.
[1:52:04] Aren't you glad that he
[1:52:07] he took my place
[1:52:11] so that I
[1:52:14] through his love could take his.
[1:52:22] I know that he
[1:52:25] became me
[1:52:28] so that I might
[1:52:31] become him.
[1:52:34] Oh, sing it one more time with all your
[1:52:36] hearts now.
[1:52:38] Oh, I know that he
[1:52:42] became me
[1:52:45] so that I might
[1:52:48] become him by grace.
[1:52:56] Yes, he
[1:52:59] became me
[1:53:02] so that I might
[1:53:05] become him
[1:53:08] by grace.
[1:53:11] Aren't you glad he did this? Oh, he he
[1:53:16] took my place
[1:53:18] so that I through his love could take
[1:53:25] his.
[1:53:29] I know that he
[1:53:32] became me.
[1:53:39] become him
[1:53:41] by grace.
[1:53:45] Amen. How many enjoyed the word of the
[1:53:47] Lord this morning? Go ahead and give the
[1:53:49] Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen.
[1:53:52] Brother Robert, would you pull up? Why
[1:53:54] didn't we recognize? Why didn't we
[1:53:56] recognize? Let's sing this together now.
[1:53:58] Amen. When he was walking and talking
[1:53:59] along with him, I love what brother Josh
[1:54:01] said. Amen. The word was, "Who are you?
[1:54:04] Who's this man?" And then when the word
[1:54:05] was spoke, I tell you what, just like
[1:54:08] that little eagle,
[1:54:10] thought it was an eagle. I thought it
[1:54:12] was a chicken the whole time. And then
[1:54:14] when the eagles went flew over the coupe
[1:54:17] and when it heard the voice of the
[1:54:18] eagle, amen, it knew then who it was.
[1:54:22] We're being placed by the message of the
[1:54:24] hour. Aren't you glad you know who you
[1:54:26] are now? Amen. You can say, "Well, I
[1:54:29] used to be." Well, you might have been
[1:54:30] in a chicken pin, but you always were a
[1:54:33] son or daughter of God. Aren't you
[1:54:34] thankful for today? Somebody give God
[1:54:36] some more praise here in the building
[1:54:37] this morning.
[1:54:41] Oh, why didn't we recognize
[1:54:47] the son of God
[1:54:51] was here today?
[1:54:55] Oh, and in our hearts
[1:55:00] over
[1:55:03] as he talked along the way.
[1:55:11] Oh, shouldn't we have no
[1:55:18] should we have known him?
[1:55:24] I wish that we had known him
[1:55:29] before the Lord had come
[1:55:33] and gone.
[1:55:40] The day be before yesterday
[1:55:45] they
[1:55:47] crucified
[1:55:49] my Lord,
[1:55:54] beat him un mercifully
[1:56:00] and nailed him to a tree.
[1:56:04] Oh, the sky grew dark and the earth
[1:56:10] began
[1:56:12] to fall.
[1:56:17] Oh yes, the people cried. Surely
[1:56:26] we've crucified
[1:56:29] the son of God.
[1:56:35] Oh, I dream we recognize
[1:56:41] the son of God
[1:56:44] was here today.
[1:56:48] Oh, and in our hearts
[1:56:54] burn
[1:56:56] as he talked along
[1:56:59] the way.
[1:57:04] Oh, shouldn't we have known?
[1:57:11] Shouldn't we have known here?
[1:57:17] I wish that we had known him
[1:57:22] before the Lord had come
[1:57:26] and gone.
[1:57:33] Today a friend and I
[1:57:38] walk down that road.
[1:57:45] We didn't know our Lord
[1:57:50] had
[1:57:51] arose.
[1:57:56] Oh, but then a man drew near and he
[1:58:01] spoke words
[1:58:04] so wise.
[1:58:11] He broke the bread and blessed it.
[1:58:17] He vanished and opened up our eyes.
[1:58:24] I like this part. It's for us here.
[1:58:27] Well, I'm so glad that I recognized
[1:58:32] the mighty God
[1:58:35] is here today.
[1:58:39] Oh, and does it our hearts?
[1:58:44] Oh, they burn
[1:58:47] as we talk along the way.
[1:58:53] Aren't you glad this morning? Well, I'm
[1:58:56] so glad I know him.
[1:59:01] Yes. I'm so glad I know him.
[1:59:08] Oh, I'm so glad I know him. For soon
[1:59:13] he'll come and
[1:59:16] be gone. Sing it again now. Well,
[1:59:20] I'm so glad that I recognized
[1:59:26] the mighty God
[1:59:29] is here today.
[1:59:34] And as our hearts
[1:59:38] burn
[1:59:41] as we talk along the way.
[1:59:48] Well, I'm so glad. How many knows he's
[1:59:52] here this morning? Well, oh, I'm so glad
[1:59:56] I know him.
[2:00:01] Oh, I'm so glad I know him. For soon
[2:00:06] he'll come and
[2:00:09] be gone.
[2:00:13] How many knows him to be real here this
[2:00:15] morning?
[2:00:16] And all I want to do is love him.
[2:00:22] Well, I'm so glad I was his love for me.
[2:00:28] For Jesus paid the price of redemption
[2:00:34] on the cross of Calary.
[2:00:38] Can you praise him now? Oh, so every day
[2:00:41] my heart is going to praise him.
[2:00:45] Oh, I know I'll ever be the same.
[2:00:52] And all I want to do is love him. Love
[2:00:57] is holy.
[2:01:00] Sing it one more time before we go. Now
[2:01:02] we're singing, "All I want to do is love
[2:01:06] him.
[2:01:08] I'm so glad I feel his love for me."
[2:01:14] And Jesus paid the price of redemption
[2:01:20] on the cross of Calary.
[2:01:24] Oh, so every day my heart is going to
[2:01:28] praise him. Oh, I know I'll never be the
