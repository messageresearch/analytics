[52:11] thou art no more a servant hallelujah
[52:16] we are no longer servants
[52:19] we are sons of god
[52:21] we are doctors of god
[52:23] we no longer serve the devil
[52:26] the devil has no dominion over us
[52:29] the devil has no power over us

[53:01] because we are
[53:03] sons of god
[53:06] this morning i want to speak on another
[53:07] topic
[53:09] knowing who you are
[53:12] knowing who we are it is very important
[53:15] to know who we are
[53:18] if a man knows who he is or she is
[53:22] it influence whatever he does
[53:26] his way of speaking
[53:29] his way of dressing
[53:31] his way of behaving among people
[53:35] shows who
[53:37] he or she is
[53:39] and this can only be done if he knows
[53:42] who he is
[53:45] if maybe
[53:47] a president comes here
[53:50] knowing that he's a president
[53:52] there are certain things he may not do
[53:56] because he knows that he's a president
[53:58] but if he
[54:00] is not
[54:01] or he doesn't know who
[54:04] he is
[54:05] he may do things
[54:07] and people will start questioning is it
[54:09] not the president he's not this man
[54:12] why is he behaving this why is he doing
[54:14] this
[54:15] amen
[54:16] i understand there are many things we do
[54:18] as children of god today
[54:20] is because we forget who we
[54:22] are tonight i want us to know who we are
[54:27] if we know who we are then we know our
[54:29] position
[54:30] and the prophet said
[54:31] our position
[54:33] is our authority
[54:36] amen
[54:39] in a message
[54:41] entitled
[54:43] jesus
[54:45] christ the same yes
[54:48] the prophet
[54:50] made a statement here i want to
[54:52] ask to read
[54:54] he said i've often said
[54:56] i met two classes of people
[54:59] in my times around the world
[55:02] in mission work i met two classes of
[55:04] people one of them is pentecostal
[55:10] the other one is founder mentor
[55:13] the fundamentals positionally know
[55:16] where they stand
[55:18] he takes it by the word
[55:21] i am a son of god
[55:24] by my confession see
[55:26] he positionally
[55:28] takes
[55:30] the stand
[55:31] but he's
[55:32] got no faith in what
[55:35] he is talking about
[55:37] hallelujah
[55:39] they claim they are sons of gods
[55:41] they confess this yes but unfortunately
[55:46] they don't have faith in what they are
[55:48] confessing
[55:51] hallelujah
[55:53] if we don't have faith in what we are
[55:54] confessing
[55:56] then it means that
[55:58] we we don't know what we are saying
[56:02] we must be able to have faith in
[56:04] whatsoever we confess we need to have
[56:07] faith in our position we need to have
[56:09] faith in whom we are
[56:12] then of course we can have authority
[56:14] to act to behave
[56:17] like that person
[56:19] but this class of people
[56:22] the prophet said
[56:24] they don't have faith but they confess
[56:27] yes
[56:31] amen
[56:34] there he got no faith in what
[56:36] he's talking about
[56:38] the pentecostal has no not
[56:41] has
[56:42] the pentecostal has a lot
[56:45] of faith but don't know where this where
[56:48] he stands
[56:50] he don't know who he is
[56:53] it's just like a man
[56:56] has got money in the bank
[56:59] and he don't know how to write a check
[57:03] and the other man write a check
[57:06] and and got money in the bank
[57:12] one class of
[57:14] people
[57:16] the prophet said
[57:19] they
[57:20] have money in the bank
[57:22] but unfortunately for them
[57:24] they don't know how to write the check
[57:28] the other people
[57:29] don't have money in the bank
[57:32] but they have
[57:33] they know how to write a check
[57:36] he's talking about the fundamentals
[57:38] and the pentecostals
[57:42] he said
[57:46] and the fundamentals and and fundamental
[57:50] doctrine
[57:51] or vice versa make the pentecostal
[57:54] realize who they are
[57:56] they are sons and doctors of god
[57:58] already
[57:59] dead buried rose again and sitting in
[58:02] heavenly places
[58:04] have healthy places in christ jesus
[58:07] not
[58:08] you would
[58:10] you are
[58:12] amen
[58:13] [Music]
[58:14] we need to know who we are
[58:18] even
[58:20] like the prophet said
[58:22] the fundamentals
[58:25] and the pentecostals
[58:27] there's something
[58:29] yes that is lacking
[58:31] lacking
[58:34] in the two of them
[58:36] they all lack something
[58:38] but i want to say this morning
[58:41] that
[58:42] we need
[58:43] to have a money in the bank
[58:45] and we need to know how to write a
[58:47] cheque yes
[58:48] amen
[58:50] is that if the two come together yes
[58:53] then we are sons
[58:55] and daughters of god and hearts of the
[58:58] kingdom
[59:00] we have to claim our rights
[59:03] amend
[59:04] we don't allow the devil to press us
[59:06] down
[59:09] we are
[59:11] the children of god
[59:14] god said it
[59:16] he made it and the devil has no right
[59:22] the prophet said
[59:24] he said there are many that are looking
[59:27] at signs
[59:28] or symptoms
[59:30] yes
[59:31] even though the pastor prayed for them
[59:35] they come back
[59:36] when they are asked how do you feel
[59:39] he said somehow i'm feeling better
[59:42] they are still looking at signs they are
[59:44] still looking at symptoms yes
[59:47] the devil
[59:49] always uses symptoms against us
[59:54] but sometimes have nothing to do
[59:57] once god said you are healed you are
[1:00:00] healed
[1:00:01] once god said you are delivered you are
[1:00:03] delivered yes one god said you are a son
[1:00:06] of god you are a son of god
[1:00:10] we need not to look at
[1:00:12] the symptoms the symptoms
[1:00:15] are deceitful
[1:00:17] the symptoms
[1:00:19] discourages us
[1:00:21] the symptoms
[1:00:25] take us from
[1:00:26] claiming the promises of god
[1:00:31] if we go to the days of jonah
[1:00:34] the scripture made us to know that
[1:00:37] god called jonah as his servant
[1:00:39] and sent him to the ninevites
[1:00:42] to go
[1:00:44] send a message to them
[1:00:46] pray to them
[1:00:48] that they shall repent for god is going
[1:00:50] to destroy
[1:00:52] the land
[1:00:54] the scripture said you're not god ready
[1:00:58] he took off for the journey
[1:01:00] but unfortunately for jonah
[1:01:03] when he arrived
[1:01:05] at where he was going to take the boat
[1:01:08] the prophet said
[1:01:11] he thought of going to vacation
[1:01:16] in taxes instead of going to nineveh
[1:01:19] because jonah was a jew
[1:01:21] and he was sent to the gentiles
[1:01:24] so the brother said his intention was
[1:01:28] because god was judging
[1:01:30] them in 40 days
[1:01:32] he waits
[1:01:34] when the days are getting closer
[1:01:37] then he will go and then when he goes
[1:01:39] when he preaches
[1:01:41] they will believe it
[1:01:43] so when he arrived
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:45] at the seaside
[1:01:48] or the riverside
[1:01:49] instead of going to take the boat going
[1:01:51] to
[1:01:53] to nineveh
[1:01:55] he took the bulls going to taxes
[1:01:58] and the scripture said
[1:01:59] along the line
[1:02:01] god started hunting him
[1:02:04] he was running from the presence of god
[1:02:07] we can run from the presence of god
[1:02:10] heaven is his throne
[1:02:12] earth is his fulfilled
[1:02:14] where can we run from
[1:02:16] where can we run to from the presence of
[1:02:18] god jonah thought he was running from
[1:02:21] the presence of god
[1:02:23] and the scripture said
[1:02:24] god started started hunting him
[1:02:28] and there was tom
[1:02:31] they did all they
[1:02:32] could but
[1:02:35] nothing happened
[1:02:37] finally they thought of casting a lot
[1:02:40] knowing very well that he was running
[1:02:42] from
[1:02:43] the presence of god he went and hit
[1:02:45] under the boat
[1:02:47] having a nice time there relaxing
[1:02:50] the scripture said
[1:02:51] they cast a lot in the front of that
[1:02:54] there's somebody
[1:02:56] and the lot felt on jonah
[1:03:00] when it fell on jonah
[1:03:03] jonah
[1:03:04] knew what
[1:03:06] was happening
[1:03:09] he could have prayed
[1:03:12] but he never prayed
[1:03:15] but because he knows that it is not a
[1:03:17] matter of praying
[1:03:19] it is a matter of restitution
[1:03:22] it is a matter of doing what god wanted
[1:03:24] him to do
[1:03:26] yes sir
[1:03:27] so all he told them was
[1:03:29] i am the cause
[1:03:31] and the only way we can
[1:03:33] save the situation
[1:03:34] is to throw me
[1:03:36] into the sea
[1:03:38] jonah was not a simon
[1:03:41] jonah may not know how to swim but they
[1:03:44] buy his hands
[1:03:46] they burn his feet
[1:03:47] and he threw him into the sea
[1:03:50] the scripture said
[1:03:53] in the sea
[1:03:55] he started praying
[1:03:57] hallelujah
[1:03:58] and when he prayed
[1:04:00] god sent
[1:04:02] a feast to come and swallowed him
[1:04:06] and in the feast bella
[1:04:09] the prophet said
[1:04:11] jonah could have looked
[1:04:13] to the symptoms
[1:04:15] or he could have looked into the belly
[1:04:18] of the fish
[1:04:20] but jonah did not look at this
[1:04:23] he looked at the promise of god he
[1:04:26] looked at the word of god
[1:04:28] because
[1:04:29] when solomon
[1:04:30] was dedicating the temple he prayed that
[1:04:33] every jew that would be in trouble
[1:04:36] wherever he is
[1:04:37] if he can turn to the temple and pray
[1:04:41] god should answer him
[1:04:43] so jonah in the fishbelly
[1:04:46] managed to turn to
[1:04:48] the direction of
[1:04:51] the temple
[1:04:53] hallelujah
[1:04:54] and the prophet said
[1:04:56] jonah could have looked at the symptoms
[1:04:59] he could have looked at the condition in
[1:05:01] which he was
[1:05:02] and this condition would have
[1:05:03] discouraged him
[1:05:05] but he did not look at the condition but
[1:05:08] he looked at the promises of god
[1:05:10] he looked at what god said
[1:05:12] brethren and says the lord it is time we
[1:05:15] stop looking at the symptoms
[1:05:19] and look at the promises of god he that
[1:05:22] has made the promise he is able to
[1:05:24] fulfill it
[1:05:25] even though he carries he will surely do
[1:05:28] it because he is god
[1:05:33] praise the lord
[1:05:35] jonah started praying
[1:05:38] and the prophet said
[1:05:40] god instructed the fish
[1:05:43] that he should send jonah to navy
[1:05:45] and at that time
[1:05:47] the fishermen
[1:05:50] the universe
[1:05:53] they were fishermen
[1:05:55] they were washing their nets out of
[1:05:57] seaside
[1:05:58] behold
[1:06:00] their fish came around
[1:06:03] and the prophet that fish was the fish
[1:06:06] that they worshiped
[1:06:08] and when he came informing jonah
[1:06:11] jonah preached
[1:06:13] they believed
[1:06:15] they prayed they fasted
[1:06:18] they were so close
[1:06:20] and god also repented from heaven
[1:06:23] god stopped
[1:06:25] what he was going to do
[1:06:27] brendan said lord
[1:06:30] the prophet said jonah could have looked
[1:06:32] at the symptoms
[1:06:34] he was bind
[1:06:37] his feet was burned
[1:06:39] his legs were bind
[1:06:41] his hands were burned
[1:06:42] but he never looked at the symptoms
[1:06:46] sometimes when we look at the symptoms
[1:06:48] it discourages
[1:06:52] it makes us not to have faith
[1:06:55] it brings doubt into our life
[1:06:57] and as a result
[1:06:59] the promises of god cannot be made
[1:07:02] manifest in our life
[1:07:04] brethren say lord
[1:07:06] it depends on what we are looking at
[1:07:09] amen don't look at who you are but look
[1:07:12] at the promises of god
[1:07:15] look at the covenant that god has made
[1:07:18] with you
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] he thought himself in calvary
[1:07:27] and he swore by himself
[1:07:31] he took his body to heaven
[1:07:35] and he returned his spirit upon us
[1:07:38] he gave us his spirit
[1:07:40] back the spirit of god is in the church
[1:07:44] to lead the church
[1:07:46] the same life that was in christ
[1:07:49] is in the church now
[1:07:51] is in the church this morning
[1:07:54] in the form of the holy spirit
[1:07:57] going to perform the very things that he
[1:07:59] performed what he was here on earth
[1:08:02] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:08:04] and forever
[1:08:06] we got a promise
[1:08:09] we got a covenant
[1:08:11] let us know that we are covenant men
[1:08:14] we are not just an ordinary people
[1:08:18] we are covenant people
[1:08:20] we are sons and doctors of god
[1:08:23] we need to know who we are
[1:08:25] we need to know our position
[1:08:27] we need to know our calling
[1:08:30] we need to know
[1:08:32] hallelujah what god is doing in our life
[1:08:35] that is what gives us the authority
[1:08:40] amend
[1:08:42] if you don't know who you are
[1:08:44] you continue to fail
[1:08:47] and the devil will torment you yes but
[1:08:50] if you know who you are you realize who
[1:08:52] you are it makes a devil mad
[1:08:56] when a child of god
[1:08:58] a daughter of god realize who he or she
[1:09:02] is
[1:09:02] it makes the devil mad
[1:09:04] hallelujah and it gives us fit
[1:09:08] it gives us authority
[1:09:10] it gives a power
[1:09:12] hallelujah and when we are praying we
[1:09:15] pray with faith we pray with assurance
[1:09:18] because we pray as children of god
[1:09:23] for we know where we are standing
[1:09:26] and we know our position
[1:09:29] our position
[1:09:31] in christ is our power
[1:09:33] this morning if you can know your
[1:09:35] position
[1:09:38] you know your power
[1:09:40] you can speak
[1:09:42] the prophet said we can create even
[1:09:44] another world
[1:09:46] we can create an atmosphere
[1:09:48] if we know who we are
[1:09:51] our problem
[1:09:53] is not the word of god our problem is
[1:09:56] not the message
[1:09:58] our problem is not our brother
[1:10:00] our problem is not our sister
[1:10:02] our problem is not our dickens
[1:10:04] our problem is not our pastor our
[1:10:07] problem is
[1:10:08] we do not know who we are
[1:10:13] let us pray
[1:10:15] that god give us a revelation
[1:10:18] about who we are
[1:10:20] the prophet said
[1:10:22] when we have a revelation when the
[1:10:25] church gets a true revelation it becomes
[1:10:28] an invisible army
[1:10:30] that is why the devil doesn't like
[1:10:32] revelation but we like revelation
[1:10:35] because by revelation we defeat the
[1:10:37] enemy
[1:10:39] by revelation hallelujah we doubt every
[1:10:42] we will reject every lie of the devil
[1:10:46] we need revelation we like revelation
[1:10:49] but the devil hates revelation because
[1:10:52] with revelation we know the tatties of
[1:10:55] the devil and the prophet said to
[1:10:57] overcome
[1:10:58] the devil is to know the tactics of the
[1:11:01] devil
[1:11:02] we are overcomers yes
[1:11:05] event
[1:11:07] he overcome for us
[1:11:09] and
[1:11:10] we are living in that
[1:11:13] overcoming spirit
[1:11:15] satan
[1:11:18] don't care about who you are
[1:11:21] if you don't know your position
[1:11:24] satan don't care about your jumping up
[1:11:26] and down
[1:11:28] it will still lay there
[1:11:31] but when you move from there
[1:11:35] and you come to know who you are
[1:11:38] as a child of god
[1:11:40] it gives you faith
[1:11:42] and then you can now enjoy the blessings
[1:11:45] of god
[1:11:46] you can enjoy the healings you can enjoy
[1:11:49] the deliverance you see the power of god
[1:11:51] in your life you see god moving in your
[1:11:54] life

[1:12:14] then we live in sin
[1:12:16] yes and when we know who we are
[1:12:19] then
[1:12:20] hallelujah
[1:12:22] the devil
[1:12:24] cannot do anything
[1:12:27] or somebody asked brother brown a
[1:12:28] question

[1:12:45] wonders

[1:12:48] let us listen to what the prophet said
[1:12:51] or is it just
[1:12:53] is this the direction of the holy ghost
[1:12:56] the prophet said yes
[1:12:58] it is the direction of the holy ghost
[1:13:01] if you are a son of god or a doctor of
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:06] whatever you are
[1:13:08] when you have received the holy ghost
[1:13:11] then the holy ghost will direct you to

[1:14:06] revealed to us yes it is only by the
[1:14:08] holy spirit that we can hear his voice
[1:14:12] we are living a time when there are many
[1:14:14] voices yes there are voices of jesus
[1:14:17] there are verses of men
[1:14:19] but to hear the the voice of god it
[1:14:22] takes the holy spirit
[1:14:25] to hear the voice of god and the voice
[1:14:27] of god to the children of god
[1:14:30] is a special thing
[1:14:32] that is what we need

[1:16:01] our wife share our property with us
[1:16:04] i will share what we have
[1:16:07] they shared with us
[1:16:09] so it is with christ
[1:16:11] if we can recognize
[1:16:13] if we can know if we can realize
[1:16:16] that we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:16:20] living in this end time
[1:16:24] then we are a special people
[1:16:26] we can live above sin
[1:16:28] sin can no longer influence us
[1:16:31] sin cannot dominate us we will be
[1:16:34] influenced from our path
[1:16:37] and we know that
[1:16:39] we are from a different place that's
[1:16:42] right
[1:16:43] brethren this is the lord
[1:16:47] he promised us
[1:16:49] and he will fulfill his promise
[1:16:51] let us not listen to what the devil is
[1:16:53] saying
[1:16:55] the devil is a liar
[1:16:58] he only bluffs
[1:16:59] right
[1:17:00] we are co-equal with jesus
[1:17:04] we are in his presence
[1:17:06] satan doesn't have any right
[1:17:09] of doing anything
[1:17:12] because in cavalry
[1:17:14] he was stripped off yes and the
[1:17:16] scripture said
[1:17:18] the last word that jesus said
[1:17:20] was it is finished yes
[1:17:23] it is finished
[1:17:25] i want to assure you this morning
[1:17:27] that your problem is finished
[1:17:30] when we said something is finished it
[1:17:32] means it is ended
[1:17:35] jesus said it is finished
[1:17:37] at the cross it says it is finished
[1:17:39] our sit next problem is finished
[1:17:42] our sin problem is finished
[1:17:46] everything is finished
[1:17:49] the devil
[1:17:51] has no right
[1:17:53] the devil
[1:17:54] has no power
[1:17:56] the devil
[1:17:58] is just lying
[1:18:01] it is finished
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:05] once it is finished
[1:18:07] the devil has no legal right
[1:18:09] anymore in our life no sir
[1:18:14] the only thing that is left for us
[1:18:17] is to believe
[1:18:18] is to know our position
[1:18:21] many a times
[1:18:23] we say it is the devil that has done
[1:18:25] this it is the devil that has done this
[1:18:28] it is the devil that has done it let us
[1:18:30] leave the devil alone
[1:18:33] for the devil cannot do anything
[1:18:35] in the life of a child of god no
[1:18:39] even though god permits the devil to do
[1:18:41] it
[1:18:42] god will give it a limit yes
[1:18:46] the prophet said god can use the devil
[1:18:48] against the disobedient children of god
[1:18:50] but god would give him a limit
[1:18:54] like god gave him a limit in the life of
[1:18:56] job
[1:18:57] he said you can destroy everything
[1:19:00] but you don't have right to his life
[1:19:03] so we saw the devil did everything to
[1:19:06] europe
[1:19:07] but the devil could not take job away
[1:19:10] because god has given it a limit
[1:19:14] my brother my sister
[1:19:16] the devil has no legal right in the life
[1:19:18] of a child of god
[1:19:20] therefore let us stop
[1:19:22] magnifying the devil
[1:19:24] it is the devil
[1:19:26] it is the devil no
[1:19:29] if you knew your position
[1:19:31] the devil can do nothing in your life
[1:19:36] oh and my sickness
[1:19:38] and my headache has come back again
[1:19:42] my bodily pain has come back again
[1:19:45] my whispering has come back again
[1:19:49] it shows that you are making that demon
[1:19:53] your possession
[1:19:56] the prophet said
[1:19:58] he said every sickness
[1:20:01] is a demon
[1:20:03] even though they might give it a
[1:20:04] scientific name
[1:20:06] at the end of the day is the devil in
[1:20:09] action
[1:20:10] therefore if we continue to say
[1:20:13] my sickness
[1:20:14] my headache
[1:20:15] my waistband
[1:20:17] my body pains
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:21] then we are still
[1:20:24] maintaining the devil in our homes
[1:20:26] in our life
[1:20:28] now
[1:20:29] as children of god we have right to cast
[1:20:32] the devil away
[1:20:34] to speak yes and stop everything that
[1:20:38] the devil is doing in our life
[1:20:40] every sickness
[1:20:41] every trouble
[1:20:43] every demon every problem we can speak
[1:20:47] yes and it will be done
[1:20:50] hallelujah but before we can speak
[1:20:53] we need to know who we are
[1:20:56] amen
[1:20:59] we need to know we are believers
[1:21:02] we need to know that
[1:21:05] the sting
[1:21:06] of death
[1:21:09] that the devil got
[1:21:11] has gone
[1:21:13] the devil has no strings any longer
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:18] oh my brother my sister
[1:21:20] let us look at calvary
[1:21:24] we can show the devil the resurrection
[1:21:29] the scripture says we reckon ourselves
[1:21:31] dead
[1:21:32] we are buried with him
[1:21:34] in the baptism
[1:21:35] into his death
[1:21:37] and we
[1:21:39] were raised with him in the resurrection
[1:21:43] now that we are going to be raised with
[1:21:45] him
[1:21:46] we are already raised with him
[1:21:48] and where are we now
[1:21:50] the scripture said
[1:21:52] we are with him in the heavenly places
[1:21:56] at the right hand of god
[1:21:58] and that is the authority of god
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:04] we are sitting with him in the heavenly
[1:22:05] places in christ jesus
[1:22:09] we need to realize that
[1:22:12] heaven is our place even though we are
[1:22:14] sitting here this morning
[1:22:16] we are sitting in the heavenly places
[1:22:20] as believers
[1:22:22] we need to take our position in christ
[1:22:24] we need to stand by our position in
[1:22:26] christ
[1:22:28] we need to demonstrate the power of the
[1:22:31] resurrection
[1:22:33] and make the devil
[1:22:35] know that we know who we are and make
[1:22:38] the devil know we know our position
[1:22:41] and make the devil know that
[1:22:43] we know that
[1:22:44] it has no power
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] oh my brother and sister
[1:22:50] the devil is defeated
[1:22:54] is defeated
[1:22:56] every form
[1:22:58] that is making itself manifest is
[1:23:00] defeated
[1:23:02] but our problem is
[1:23:04] we do not know
[1:23:06] you know in africa
[1:23:09] we do buy
[1:23:11] chickens
[1:23:13] say you go to the market to buy a
[1:23:14] chicken
[1:23:15] you buy the lake
[1:23:17] and when you buy the lake and you bring
[1:23:19] it back home
[1:23:21] you lose the leg
[1:23:23] but sometimes because the chicken has
[1:23:25] stayed so long
[1:23:27] in that rope even though you lose
[1:23:32] the rope
[1:23:33] the chicken things is still being bind
[1:23:37] and it will lie there quietly
[1:23:39] even though you push it it will not go
[1:23:43] in his mind
[1:23:44] i am still being bind
[1:23:47] that is the problem of many children of
[1:23:49] god today
[1:23:51] they've been delivered yes but
[1:23:54] because
[1:23:55] they have suffered so much in
[1:23:57] in their life and
[1:23:59] it has created something in their
[1:24:01] mentality
[1:24:03] they never knew that they has been
[1:24:05] delivered
[1:24:06] they have been loosed
[1:24:09] they still
[1:24:10] stand as if they are still buying
[1:24:13] my brother my sister
[1:24:15] what the bride of christ needs today is
[1:24:17] to know who he is
[1:24:20] and the word that christ has done for us
[1:24:23] the prophet said
[1:24:25] he said
[1:24:26] to sin
[1:24:30] you know you will not be condemned for
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:33] because sin is unbelievable
[1:24:35] he said we'll be condemned because
[1:24:38] the work that christ did for us
[1:24:41] we don't recognize it we don't accept it
[1:24:46] and because of that we crucify him the
[1:24:48] second time
[1:24:50] it's because we are not conscious of
[1:24:52] what he has done for us
[1:24:55] we don't know he has delivered us
[1:24:57] we don't know he has made a sense and
[1:24:59] doctors of god
[1:25:01] that is where we are living under the
[1:25:03] privileges
[1:25:05] that god has given us
[1:25:07] instead of living above the privileges
[1:25:09] we are living hallelujah
[1:25:13] under the privileges
[1:25:16] oh what we need today
[1:25:19] is to know who we are
[1:25:22] to know our position in christ
[1:25:24] we should know that we have been
[1:25:26] delivered
[1:25:27] we should know that we have been saved
[1:25:30] we should know that the devil
[1:25:32] cannot do us anything any longer
[1:25:35] the devil
[1:25:37] will just bluff
[1:25:39] the devil is just like a lion
[1:25:42] that has no teeth in his mouth
[1:25:46] it can only rule
[1:25:49] but it cannot do anything
[1:25:51] and remember in africa there's a tribe
[1:25:55] there are cows
[1:25:58] but they have mouth
[1:26:00] when you have problem with them
[1:26:02] they'll be jumping
[1:26:04] going forward coming back if you don't
[1:26:07] take care i'll kill you now
[1:26:08] i'll stamp you i'll do you this
[1:26:11] and you'll be frightened it's only muff
[1:26:15] they are just boasting
[1:26:17] if you can stand
[1:26:18] they will run away from you
[1:26:20] that is what the devil is
[1:26:23] this morning the devil is a defeated
[1:26:25] food
[1:26:27] if we can tell the devil you are
[1:26:28] defeated in my life
[1:26:30] you are defeated in my family you are
[1:26:33] defeated in my home you are defeated in
[1:26:36] my business you don't have any right
[1:26:38] again
[1:26:39] we will start enjoying the blessings of
[1:26:41] god
[1:26:44] amen
[1:26:47] hallelujah
[1:26:51] know your position
[1:26:55] praise the lord
[1:26:58] we have got
[1:27:01] the power of god in our life
[1:27:04] to do things
[1:27:06] we could speak the world into existence
[1:27:09] we have powers church
[1:27:12] the scriptures say what we buy on earth
[1:27:14] will be bound in heaven
[1:27:16] god has given his church authority
[1:27:20] god has given us as children of god sons
[1:27:22] of god authority
[1:27:25] he has given us power
[1:27:27] if we can use them
[1:27:29] the devil
[1:27:31] will be defeated
[1:27:32] anywhere in the ground
[1:27:34] in any condition
[1:27:38] all things are possible to them that
[1:27:40] believe
[1:27:42] the prophet said we are not called to
[1:27:44] reason with the word of god
[1:27:47] we are called to believe the word of god
[1:27:50] and if we can believe what god says
[1:27:54] all things are possible
[1:27:56] and the child of god must be a believer
[1:28:00] must believe every promise of god
[1:28:02] must believe every word of god
[1:28:05] every promise in the bible is ours yes
[1:28:09] and we have to take it and hope
[1:28:12] and take god by his word yes
[1:28:16] it is only when we know who we are
[1:28:19] god promised joshua
[1:28:21] he said whatever the soul of your
[1:28:23] faithful truth
[1:28:25] will become yours
[1:28:27] and the prophet said
[1:28:28] that promise has not gone it has not
[1:28:31] ended up with jesus right it's still
[1:28:33] today
[1:28:34] that every son and doctor of god
[1:28:37] wherever our feet will truth will become
[1:28:39] ours
[1:28:41] amen
[1:28:43] once we are saved
[1:28:46] and we are children of god
[1:28:48] and we know who we are
[1:28:51] we can overcome the enemy
[1:28:54] and the scripture said
[1:28:56] faith
[1:28:58] is arbitrary
[1:29:00] and by faith
[1:29:02] we can overcome the world
[1:29:04] we're going to overcome
[1:29:06] the devil
[1:29:09] we can change things
[1:29:12] harry lawyer
[1:29:15] the prophet said
[1:29:17] he said entirety is not in heaven
[1:29:21] the deity is in a believer
[1:29:25] and he went on to say
[1:29:28] the believer does not pray to god in
[1:29:30] heaven
[1:29:31] we pray to god that is in us yes
[1:29:34] and if the deity is in
[1:29:36] us and god is in us
[1:29:40] then whatsoever we pray for
[1:29:43] we need to believe that we have it yes
[1:29:45] and we need to realize that the almighty
[1:29:48] god
[1:29:49] lives in our life
[1:29:52] then we have right to life
[1:29:54] and we have right to everything
[1:29:57] we have right to every promise of god
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:01] then we know who we are
[1:30:04] and if we know who we are
[1:30:06] then we can leave our best scene
[1:30:10] the prophet said we are loosed from sin
[1:30:14] and sin has no longer dominion over us
[1:30:19] we are our best sin
[1:30:23] sin has no power over us
[1:30:26] we can make mistakes anyway
[1:30:28] but thank god that the blood of jesus
[1:30:29] christ
[1:30:30] forgive us all our mistakes
[1:30:33] forgiveness of our sins
[1:30:35] a sinner that is one page
[1:30:37] has no more desire for sin
[1:30:40] he can make a mistake
[1:30:42] but he cannot
[1:30:45] sin
[1:30:46] hallelujah
[1:30:48] brethren say lord
[1:30:50] when christ came here
[1:30:52] he came according to the word of god
[1:30:56] but before he could exercise his
[1:30:58] authority
[1:31:00] he must believe all that the scripture
[1:31:02] said about him
[1:31:06] he must act upon the scripture
[1:31:09] he said i do nothing
[1:31:10] i said that which i see the father has
[1:31:13] done
[1:31:14] i do nothing except what the scriptures
[1:31:17] says about me
[1:31:19] he told the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:31:22] you claim you know the bible and you
[1:31:24] read the bible
[1:31:25] and in them you have eternal life
[1:31:29] examine it
[1:31:31] examine what i'm doing
[1:31:32] and see
[1:31:34] if
[1:31:35] i'm not doing what this creature said i
[1:31:37] would do
[1:31:38] none of you can condemn me
[1:31:41] he had faith
[1:31:44] in what the word of god says about him
[1:31:47] and that is what we need today
[1:31:49] if the word of god says you are a child
[1:31:51] of god you have to believe that you're a
[1:31:52] child of god
[1:31:54] no matter who you are no matter the
[1:31:56] condition in which you are once god has
[1:31:58] said it believe it yes and when you
[1:32:01] believe it
[1:32:02] when god says you are healed believe it
[1:32:05] and once you believe it and you go
[1:32:07] confessing it your body
[1:32:10] will obey it
[1:32:12] and you see it fulfilled
[1:32:14] in your life
[1:32:16] so jesus
[1:32:17] has to believe what the scripture says
[1:32:20] about him
[1:32:21] and we also need to believe what
[1:32:23] the scripture says about us
[1:32:25] even god himself the brother said in the
[1:32:27] message entitled the sixth sense
[1:32:30] is that when god spoke the word
[1:32:33] for the word to be fulfilled
[1:32:35] he delivered it
[1:32:38] is let it
[1:32:41] be light and he believed it and it was
[1:32:44] light yes
[1:32:45] our problem
[1:32:46] today
[1:32:49] is that we are not seeing what god has
[1:32:50] done for us
[1:32:53] our problem today is we are not
[1:32:55] believing what god said about us
[1:32:59] oh
[1:33:01] there is power
[1:33:03] in what
[1:33:05] god says about us if only we can believe
[1:33:08] it
[1:33:09] if we can rely upon the word of god
[1:33:12] another compounds idea not of our idea
[1:33:16] but what the word of god says about
[1:33:19] ourselves
[1:33:20] what the word of god has made us
[1:33:22] if we can believe it
[1:33:25] hallelujah
[1:33:26] we are always overcomers
[1:33:31] nothing of the devil
[1:33:33] can pull us down no
[1:33:37] as believers
[1:33:39] let us rely
[1:33:41] on what god has made us
[1:33:44] he has made the sons and daughters of
[1:33:46] god it is not our making
[1:33:49] it is not your making
[1:33:51] it is not my making
[1:33:53] the scripture said
[1:33:54] at the fullness of time
[1:33:57] he sent his son
[1:33:59] because we were sown
[1:34:01] we were in him before the foundation of
[1:34:03] the world
[1:34:05] and the prophet said
[1:34:06] once we are sung and we were him we have
[1:34:09] always been songs
[1:34:12] and at the right time
[1:34:14] he brought us up
[1:34:16] and nothing
[1:34:17] can change us
[1:34:18] a sound is a song
[1:34:21] like the prodigal son
[1:34:24] he left
[1:34:26] he took
[1:34:27] his share of the inheritance
[1:34:29] he went and lived in a life that he
[1:34:31] thought
[1:34:32] he could leave
[1:34:34] but he lose the properties but he could
[1:34:37] not lose his sonship
[1:34:39] when he came back
[1:34:41] when the father saw him after the
[1:34:43] scripture said he said this my son was
[1:34:46] dead
[1:34:47] but now he's alive
[1:34:49] he's come back again oh my brother my
[1:34:52] sister once you are a son and a doctor
[1:34:55] of god nothing can take you out of it
[1:35:00] if you back light at all at the
[1:35:02] appropriate time god will bring you back
[1:35:05] but the scripture said
[1:35:07] the father said
[1:35:09] let us feast
[1:35:11] let us make merry because our son
[1:35:16] was dead
[1:35:17] but now
[1:35:18] he is alive
[1:35:20] he couldn't lose his sonship
[1:35:22] you cannot lose your sonship
[1:35:24] stop listening to the devil
[1:35:27] stop listening to the life of the devil
[1:35:31] you cannot lose it once you are son
[1:35:34] you are a son once you are a doctor you
[1:35:36] are a daughter of god
[1:35:38] before you were part of him
[1:35:40] he knew you before the foundation of the
[1:35:42] world
[1:35:43] and at the right time the right
[1:35:46] disposition
[1:35:47] he brought you up
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:51] and
[1:35:52] not only are we his sons
[1:35:56] but we are his wife
[1:35:59] we are married to him
[1:36:01] we are married to the word
[1:36:03] and we are living in the word
[1:36:05] we are living in christ and if we are
[1:36:07] living in christ
[1:36:09] who is perfect
[1:36:11] then we are also perfect
[1:36:15] oh my brother my sister
[1:36:18] there is nobody
[1:36:20] that can condemn you
[1:36:23] once you are in christ
[1:36:25] even the devil
[1:36:27] the prophet said
[1:36:29] before the devil
[1:36:30] can do you something
[1:36:33] the devil need to go through these
[1:36:35] processes
[1:36:38] devil need to repent
[1:36:40] the devil needs to be justified
[1:36:44] the devil needs sanctification
[1:36:47] and the devil needs the baptism of the
[1:36:49] holy spirit before it can come to where
[1:36:51] you are
[1:36:52] and once the devil goes to this prophet
[1:36:54] these processes
[1:36:56] before he reaches you
[1:36:58] it becomes your brother
[1:37:00] he becomes your sister
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:03] oh my brother my sister we need to know
[1:37:07] who we are
[1:37:10] that is our problems
[1:37:12] if we know who we are
[1:37:14] then we can be identified with jesus
[1:37:16] christ
[1:37:18] we can be identified with the word
[1:37:20] then we can stand in the word
[1:37:25] because we are sons
[1:37:27] the scripture said
[1:37:29] he sent the spirit of his son
[1:37:32] into our hearts
[1:37:34] because we are sons
[1:37:37] because we've been sons
[1:37:39] because we are always sounds
[1:37:41] he sent the spirit of his sons into our
[1:37:43] hearts
[1:37:45] christ came and died to have this
[1:37:48] purpose accomplished
[1:37:52] to restore it back to our original
[1:37:54] position
[1:37:56] our position of being sonship
[1:37:59] our possession of some
[1:38:01] being sons of god
[1:38:03] being the test of god
[1:38:05] he came
[1:38:06] and he paid the price
[1:38:08] hallelujah
[1:38:10] and he purchased us
[1:38:12] he redeem us
[1:38:15] back to our position as sons and doctors
[1:38:18] of god
[1:38:20] all we need is to accept it yes all we
[1:38:23] need is to believe it
[1:38:25] all we need is to walk into it
[1:38:28] all we need is to walk by it all we need
[1:38:31] is to confess it all we need is to
[1:38:33] believe it
[1:38:35] all we need is to see it
[1:38:38] oh brother sister
[1:38:40] a gift is not a gift
[1:38:42] until it is
[1:38:44] received yes
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:48] the brothers a pardon is not pardoned
[1:38:51] until it is received as a pardon
[1:38:54] oh my brother my sister
[1:38:57] we need to recognize who we are
[1:39:01] we need to know our position we need to
[1:39:03] know who we are
[1:39:05] the scripture says
[1:39:07] because we were sons
[1:39:10] not because we are going to be songs
[1:39:12] because we were sung
[1:39:14] he sent the spirit of sonship into our
[1:39:17] hearts
[1:39:18] hallelujah
[1:39:20] oh
[1:39:22] this morning
[1:39:24] he has a purpose in your life yes
[1:39:27] whether you are small
[1:39:29] whether you are big
[1:39:31] whether you are important
[1:39:33] whether you are not important
[1:39:35] no matter who you are
[1:39:37] hallelujah
[1:39:39] he has a purpose in your life
[1:39:42] that is why he brings you here this
[1:39:44] morning
[1:39:46] there are people in the churches
[1:39:50] they think
[1:39:51] that we are nothing yeah i want to tell
[1:39:54] you this morning that you are something
[1:39:58] god needed you here that is where he
[1:39:59] brought you here
[1:40:01] i remember there was
[1:40:03] i had a problem at home
[1:40:06] we left the key in the room
[1:40:10] and we locked the door
[1:40:12] there's no way we can
[1:40:15] get to the room
[1:40:17] and we didn't have the spare key
[1:40:20] but at home
[1:40:22] the windows we do it with bar and there
[1:40:24] are space inside
[1:40:27] just
[1:40:28] to avoid the teeth from breaking into it
[1:40:32] so finally what we thought was
[1:40:35] we have our little child
[1:40:37] we carried it
[1:40:39] we put the head through the bar
[1:40:43] and the head went through
[1:40:46] so we managed and put the child through
[1:40:48] the window through the bar
[1:40:50] and the child went
[1:40:52] there to go and pick the key where the
[1:40:54] key was the child went and picked the
[1:40:56] key
[1:40:57] brought it we receive it and we opened
[1:40:59] the door
[1:41:01] i asked myself that day
[1:41:05] there is nobody
[1:41:07] that we can say is of no use
[1:41:12] this little child
[1:41:13] has saved us from this embarrassment
[1:41:17] this little child
[1:41:19] has saved us from breaking the door
[1:41:22] buying another lock
[1:41:25] we couldn't do it
[1:41:28] because we are too big to go through
[1:41:31] the window
[1:41:32] but that little child our child
[1:41:35] was small
[1:41:37] at that age
[1:41:38] and it could go through
[1:41:40] to go bring the key
[1:41:42] all i want to say this morning is
[1:41:44] don't look down upon yourself
[1:41:47] don't underestimate yourself
[1:41:50] don't say i am nothing you are something
[1:41:53] you are special to god
[1:41:55] he has your name written in the land
[1:41:58] book of life before the foundation of
[1:42:00] the world
[1:42:01] because of you he came down
[1:42:04] because of you he went to calvary
[1:42:06] he took your place
[1:42:10] instead of you being condemned
[1:42:13] instead of you being
[1:42:15] being crucified he said no
[1:42:17] let me take his place
[1:42:19] bring all his accusation upon me
[1:42:23] everything that he did
[1:42:25] put it into my account
[1:42:27] and he died for us
[1:42:29] oh my brother my sister
[1:42:32] paul looked at it and he said we are
[1:42:35] expensive
[1:42:37] because
[1:42:38] we are bought with the price
[1:42:44] recognize who you are
[1:42:46] recognize your position i always say if
[1:42:49] we recognize our position we recognize
[1:42:51] who we are
[1:42:53] that's not going to be fine there's not
[1:42:55] going to be quadrant
[1:42:56] there's not going to be a problem
[1:42:59] we will fit
[1:43:00] to where god
[1:43:02] wants us to be
[1:43:05] we will not start
[1:43:07] impersonation
[1:43:10] we will not
[1:43:11] start copying somebody
[1:43:13] because we know what we are able to do
[1:43:16] we know what our brother is able to do
[1:43:19] we know we need our brother
[1:43:21] and he also need us in a way that is how
[1:43:24] god made it
[1:43:25] therefore this morning
[1:43:27] no matter who you are
[1:43:29] whether you are little
[1:43:31] whether you are big
[1:43:33] whether you are poor whether you are
[1:43:34] rich whether you are important whether
[1:43:37] you are not important
[1:43:39] we are all sons and daughters of god
[1:43:45] jesus when he was here
[1:43:50] he spoke of
[1:43:53] a rich man
[1:43:56] who wanted
[1:43:59] to celebrate the feast
[1:44:01] marriage field
[1:44:03] for the
[1:44:04] doctor and what he did was
[1:44:08] he make sure
[1:44:11] that he has dresses
[1:44:14] packed at the gate
[1:44:16] whosoever
[1:44:18] comes to the feast
[1:44:20] must go through the gate
[1:44:23] you remove your dress
[1:44:25] whether it be expensive dress whether
[1:44:27] it's poor you remove it and they'll give
[1:44:28] you a dress there
[1:44:31] anyone that comes through the door has
[1:44:34] to receive address and the prophet said
[1:44:38] that dress is the holy spirit
[1:44:43] he wants everybody to be of the same
[1:44:46] yes
[1:44:49] the same position the same dress
[1:44:54] there's no there's not going to be
[1:44:56] discrimination
[1:44:57] there's not going to be a big man
[1:44:59] there's not going to be a slow small man
[1:45:01] but unfortunately for a man
[1:45:03] instead of passing through the gate
[1:45:06] he
[1:45:07] he climbed over
[1:45:09] and when the fist was
[1:45:11] at his peak
[1:45:14] this man went around
[1:45:18] and he saw him he said gentleman
[1:45:24] by which way did you come in
[1:45:27] he said i climb over
[1:45:31] he ordered his servants
[1:45:33] to bind him
[1:45:35] by leg
[1:45:37] by feet
[1:45:39] by hands
[1:45:41] and threw him into total darkness
[1:45:44] and the prophet said
[1:45:46] that there's only one way
[1:45:48] and that is jesus christ
[1:45:51] we cannot come by any other way
[1:45:54] he said i'm the life the truth
[1:45:56] and the way the life and the truth
[1:45:59] no one comes to the father
[1:46:00] except by me
[1:46:03] if we can go through the door
[1:46:06] then we are all going to be dressed
[1:46:07] alive
[1:46:09] don't
[1:46:11] underestimate yourself
[1:46:14] know who you are this morning
[1:46:17] live
[1:46:21] by
[1:46:22] your god-given privileges
[1:46:26] the brother said when we
[1:46:28] repented
[1:46:29] when we believed christ
[1:46:31] all that we need
[1:46:33] for the journey
[1:46:35] he gave it to us as a package
[1:46:38] all that we needed to to to travel the
[1:46:40] way
[1:46:41] he gave us to us as a package
[1:46:44] therefore
[1:46:47] let us recognize ourselves
[1:46:50] let us recognize who we are
[1:46:53] as i bring my meeting to an end
[1:46:55] of my sermon to an end
[1:47:00] my question is
[1:47:03] do we know who we are
[1:47:06] let us
[1:47:08] come
[1:47:09] out let us away from our slumber
[1:47:13] and let us
[1:47:14] know our position
[1:47:17] let us know who we are
[1:47:19] and let us believe who we are
[1:47:23] let us not allow the devil to deceive us
