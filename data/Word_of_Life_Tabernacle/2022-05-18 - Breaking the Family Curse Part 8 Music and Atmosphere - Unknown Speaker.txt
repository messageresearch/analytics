what else would i have to hope in lord as it just thrilled me tonight as i was walking across this platform earlier i thought what a privilege to be able to come to preach to the bride of christ on a wednesday night lord i don't want to ever take it for granted and i realized lord that i'm insufficient tonight to bring anything that would help the people but all my hope is in you lord long ago i gave up everything that i was and the old man was crucified the heart and i was raised the new newness of life to walk with you so thankful for that lord may i ever walk with you just as you would have me to walk i pray that would be so with each and every one of us lord may we listen to your word may we be led by it lord lord as it goes forth tonight if there's something lord that said that maybe would stir our hearts may we respond to it lord and we say lord i know that's for me amen to the word i pray you'd grant that today lord and i pray that you'd move in a mighty way in jesus name amen amen do you love him this evening i know you do you wouldn't be here on a wednesday night first samuel chapter 16 and verse 14 i told you i probably wasn't going back to saul but we're going to go back there one more time and this will probably be it i've learned not to say never but to probably to say probably i say that a lot because we don't really know what tomorrow holds and but we do know who holds tomorrow we know our futures are secure because because we don't hold them he holds them amen first samuel 16 14. i want to talk to you tonight about music and atmosphere and kind of spring from the story of saul and david first samuel 16 14. i wanted to ask you to pray with me this weekend my aunt is coming supposed to be here with us in service and she's going to come and spend a couple days with us my mother's sister she's got cancer and it's the second or third time that she's had cancer and she's beat it before and she's had leukemia as well but the prognosis isn't good and so we're just praying that the lord will do something for her and i'm just believing that the lord will do that and so you'd be praying with me if you would as a church and you know people come for a reason they when they get in that condition they come because they believe there's something in them that tells them that there must be healing in the word of god i know that she's a believer as far as as what she knows and so let's be praying for her and and my mother's family in that situation and i believe god will do a miracle doesn't have to do it here he could do it right now tonight and there's other needs i know that you have i think of brother doug sitting tonight probably watching this but the doug and sister jan is for the jt's sister and brother-in-law he's got cancer i believe the lord is going to move for him and as well and he was going to come up and wasn't even able to make the trip to be prayed for but we know god is not limited by that and we were going to go down to see him and it was hindered as well but god knows what he's doing and so we'll just believe for these situations we don't we're not scared of cancer because we've seen god take care of it before yeah but the spirit of the lord first samuel 16 14 but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him and saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god trouble with thee that's quite a conversation isn't it you know sometimes you just have to bring it up to somebody hey you're a little bit off today behold an evil spirit from the lord troubleth thee and and remember this is after he has been rejected as king and he knows it and the spirit of the lord has left him and so now he the an evil spirit from the lord to come to trouble him and they said let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on a harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me and then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and plain and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him and then i want to skip down to verse 23 it says that it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took a harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was a well and was a well it was like it was a sickness that come upon him when he played he was well and the evil spirit departed from him i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated tonight music is fundamental to human existence they say it's universal language and this will kind of go a little bit with what we preached on sunday night if you were here but whenever humans come together for any reason music is there there is no culture without music where people don't sing henry wadsworth longfellow was the one who said music is the universal language of mankind it was martin luther who was restored music as far as congregational singing to the church during the reformation the catholics had made it something that only monks sang or or priest or someone who was paid to do it would sing or would chant they had kind of done away with music as a whole and just had a a gregorian chant that they would do and martin luther brought music back into the church and during that time and of course they thought he was some kind of a sinner for doing that but he said this about music he said next to the word of god the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world he said it controls our thoughts minds hearts and spirits he said our dear fathers and prophets did not desire without reason that music be always used in the churches he said that's why we have so many songs and psalms this precious gift has been given to man alone that he might thereby remind himself that god has created man for the express purpose of praising an extolling job extolling god you know i i i've often said it this way and i think it was billy graham that said it first but you know when we get to heaven you all will have a job i won't as far as i know i don't know maybe they'll but there won't be really any need to preach but we'll all sing yeah yeah sure right and so we we may not uh we may not hear a preacher once we get to heaven because we'll have him when we finally get there and and after all these things have happened at the end times we'll be there with with god with christ and yet during that time we'll still sing because that was his purpose and god created music in heaven it's the first thing that god created and the first thing that satan corrupted and i know many times as believers we focus on those negative aspects of music the corruption of music like rock and roll being a great example of that and those negative aspects are very real that's a that's a very real thing music affects you for good or bad it has a profound effect on you if you're feeling a certain way and you're listening to a certain type of music all the time maybe it would be good for you to turn on a different kind of music so that you'd feel differently if you find yourself depressed and you're listening to sad songs all the time you're listening to country and western and stuff like that it'd probably be good if you'd turn on something happy it'd probably be good for you if you'd if you'd play something that was upbeat and and happy because that would have a it has such a powerful influence in your life you can be driving down the road you'll hear a song or something will come back maybe it just happens in your head and it'll come back to you a song you heard years and years before and sometimes even we'll have a situation where i know as a kid we used to sing out of a hymn book and i would i love the old hymns because that's what we sang and we would sing out of the old hymn book and and i may be saying it once or twice in my life i can still remember the words now not if you ask me for them but if i if just just on a random note i might be able to sing the whole song through why because if it's music does something to you just the words by themselves don't do but music has a hugely positive role for christians not just a negative one and i think we sometimes we exalt the negative so much that people begin to think well i just have to be careful what i listen to but people are listening to music right to some kind of music and some listen to rock and roll some listen to uh to country but i prefer to listen to music that's going to bless my soul i prefer to hear music that's going to do something for me and and it would be good if we would even our children would learn to play music and to and to sing even in the home and to sing on the job and it does something for you to be able to do that yes and and whether you can sing or not you can sing somewhere and it does something it does good for you even science has proved there is physical healing in music you know that that congresswoman gabby giffords when she uh when she got shot in the face in the head here not long ago she had a uh she lost her ability to speak and she had to go give a testimony before congress and the way that they taught her to speak was by getting her to sing her testimony and then eventually she could say it but she had to sing it she could sing it before she could say it because you lose whenever you've lost the ability to speak many times you still have the ability to sing and because singing is such an integral part of who you are as a human being and and and that will actually if you can sing it it will actually heal your speech and they've also proved that if if they take someone in for a test of some kind or or some kind of a surgery say even a colonoscopy or something like that if you'll listen to music before that's calming before that happens before you go in and then you go in that that will actually affect the way you do in the surgery it will actually affect that because what it does it lowers your blood pressure lowers your heart rate it makes you more comfortable because music has that much of a powerful effect on people there are it's an essential part to the christian worship service right there's i counted five things and brother harvey's gonna think of something else and tell me later but i counted five things that are essential to the christian worship service prayer is one we we always have prayer we should never forget that to pray one for another when we come together scripture reading yes we always read the scripture but the random always read the scripture always and he would say well you know even if we closed the book and went home now we've heard the word of god right he always had the scripture and then preaching is an essential part of a christian worship service amen it's an essential part we don't that's why we don't even if the spirit takes over we have a wonderful song service we still have time for the word right and some of you if you've been in pentecost you know and back into a wesleyan church they just loved the services when they when they praised god and began to worship worship broke out and they have no time for the word but the word the preaching of the word is an essential part of the service it must be there the offering brother branham taught us was essential to the service an offering that doesn't necessarily mean even when during covenant when we didn't take it up there was still an offering in the service it was still part of your of your gift uh your giving was part of the service but singing is an essential part of the service because it prepares the way for the word and it also waters the word at the end so the bible tells us this speaking of the christian worship service and how we should do colossians 3 16 it says let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom and he said this is how to do that teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord so it matters the the attitude that you're in when you sing seeing with grace in your hearts to the lord i've heard it said said this way why don't you run that lyric through your brain before you sing it because if you're singing joy unspeakable and full of glory and you've got a frown on your face that's a little bit of a disconnect there right everybody will be happy over there and you're frowning right at some point there's a disconnect there i guess you could say well everybody will be i'm not now but but it ought to make us happy right and so there are three types of songs and we're just laying a background for where i'm going tonight but there's three types of songs that were given there psalms was the first one psalms are scriptural songs that is uh seeing the scripture and that was something that's always been done in the church i'd like to see more of it i'd like to see more of the scripture sung it's one of the good things about the praise and worship music is that sometimes they'll take a scripture especially a psalm and they'll take that and set it to music well that's what david did he wrote it with music and so it was meant to be actually accompanied by an instrument in the original or instruments and sometimes many many instruments so then you would have psalms that's the first one the second one is hymns and that's songs that everyone knows songs that have stood the test of time but in in the scripture it meant congregational singing right so we all knew the words to it so we could sing it together because they didn't have these back then i know we get addicted to these and sometimes we we can't sing unless we got one or if they get the wrong words or the words a little messed up brother robert maybe he gets the wrong song up there every once in a while not often but every once in a while the robert won't hear it just exactly right and he'll get the wrong one up there for just a minute and then he'll change it and everybody kind of stops singing but back then you had to learn it right so a hymn would be a song everybody knows right that's the song everybody knows that's a good one to sing because you can sing it together you're doing it together you're worshiping god together with one voice as we said sunday night blending your voices in harmony in worship to the to the king of kings amen but we want to do that we want to have psalms we want to have hymns and the third one was spiritual songs spiritual songs in the new testament was actually singing in the spirit paul said i'll sing in the spirit and i'll sing in the with the understanding also so in that sense he was talking about spiritual songs singing in tongues they would actually sing boy they were pentecostal weren't they they would actually sing in tongues during that early church and so but so paul said make sure you don't do that all the time right he said you want to sing with the understanding so that people know can sing with you right but there's a time for singing in the spirit it also means new songs written by inspiration and every move of god in history has been accompanied by new songs that come along and bless the people and especially by people within that move of god and i think it's wonderful when somebody in the message of the hour understands the things that we know begin to write songs it's a wonderful thing and you all had a pastor here some time ago with lafontaine and they were songwriters and the children were songwriters brother paul's a songwriter and i love to hear that music because it's written by somebody who knows something about what i believe something that i believe right so it's a move of god whenever there's a move of god it's accompanied by new songs the bible says in psalms 33 3 sing unto him a new song right so this is it's something it's part of it we don't just sing old songs we sing songs because they're good not because they're old right we sing songs because they're good not because they're new right we don't have to see everything that comes out on the radio we don't have to sing everything that that's not on the radio we we can sing what a new song if it's a song that honors god and sets the right kind of atmosphere and so we should judge every song that way every song whether it's southern gospel or contemporary or whatever that it is we should judge every song that way is it rock and roll if it is it don't belong in the church right does it sound like it does it put you in the attitude for going to a club does it put you like sound like a honky tonk it don't belong in the church but if it could be something that's upbeat it could be something that's slow but if it's worshipful to god if it puts you in an attitude of worship that's the kind of music that you want to listen to and see right because otherwise you get yourself in a box well i'll only sing a certain type of music well god likes other things other than bluegrass praise god i actually like bluegrass my daughter does too esther i don't know if she's trying to get on my good side or what but she plays bluegrass at a man i eat that up i love bluegrass huh but god's not necessarily a bluegrass musician we may not have banjos i'm not sure what the harps exactly will be but i you know i don't think it'd necessarily be banjos but there'll be instruments of music david invented new instruments to sing his new songs with he said they ain't got nothing good enough to play these songs so he just made some new ones praise the lord so he said singing him a new song play skillfully oh that's good with a loud noise everybody in the back heard me play skillfully with a loud noise so i can't complain too much about her how loud the musicians play because he said play skillfully with a loud noise and there's something david was a musician he would have understood too that when the musicians play with all their art they play better when he when you play trying to hold it back you don't play as well at least that's always been true for me although i was barely considered a musician psalm 144 9 i will sing a new song unto thee oh god upon a sultry and an instrument of ten strings well i sing praises unto thee i will sing a new song psalms 149 and 1 praise you the lord sing unto the lord a new song in his praise where in the congregation of the saints sing with understanding with other people who know the songs jesus set the pattern of singing before you go into a battle in matthew 26 and 30 when he was about to go and was about to come into the garden of gethsemane about to go through the hardest time that anyone has ever been through the greatest moment any anybody's ever been through he set the pattern it says when they'd sung a hill they went out into the mount of olives they sung what was it for he led him into him because it was it was to calm his spirit to get him ready to go into a great battle brother branham said this you know singing gives courage you know that don't you the soldiers when they're going to battle you know what they do they play music and sing and things to give them courage and when we're going to battle we sing and it gives us courage to go on oh thank the lord this is a battle when the word comes forth there'll always be a battle i'm up here fighting sometimes it's a real fight especially on a wednesday night or a sunday night sometimes it's it's just like you're sogging through you're fighting tiredness and you'll fight as well it's not just me fighting you're fighting too because you're fighting everything you've heard during the week and whether your bank account's got money in it or not you're fighting your kids and you're fighting you you're fighting your relatives and you're fighting work and everything else but if you just fight through that you're fighting a battle so to get courage for that we sing to get courage to fight devils hey man now so that kind of gives us a little background if we go back to the story saul was sick and his sickness was caused by his separation from god it wasn't a physical sickness it was depression he was depressed and many times we are depressed and we we feel that we know what that's like you don't lose the ability to be depressed when you become a christian but we do have to learn how to deal with it and how to get rid of it so saul was depressed and we're told he had an evil spirit from the lord in other words god allowed an evil spirit to come to him because he had left god but he was one of gods right right saul was one of god's he was god's chosen man even though he wasn't supposed to be king right he he was saved in the end so because he was god's god didn't leave him alone but he allowed an evil spirit to come on him a depression to come on his body come on his mind an evil spirit took his he brother adam said whenever uh god's spirit leaves the evil spirit will take its place but the branham said he backslid and went so far away from god until the spirit had left him and the evil spirit took his place come on saul and saul was all moody and in a bad humor and kicking things around oh you've never been like that had your brother bill i haven't brother bill never was waiting on sister karen to agree with you but she got it right home she almost nodded her head yes and she don't want to lie in church mr karen we've all been there haven't we i think brother brown said monday morning because that's when it's hardest on a preacher is on monday morning it's difficult and and many times as a worker as well you're tired because you've been doing whatever you do on the weekend and you don't want to go back to work saul was all moody and in a bad humor kicking things around all out of sorts like some people gets on monday morning he said so he was out of sorts watch all the time now you're going to get out of sorts sometimes but saul got to where he was so out of sorts all the time that his his people his friends his advisors told him saul you got an evil spirit from the lord right they recognized this was something more than just being out of sorts on a monday morning he was actually out of sorts all the time he was just that way he got that way and it's wrong yeah right it's an evil spirit brother said did you know that's the evil spirit now watch he said the doctors couldn't do him any good they had a lot of doctors around there but they couldn't help that because it was a spiritual condition and so you have to be able to rightly divide that many times we try to treat a natural condition as if it's a spiritual condition and it's not and a doctor might be able to help us but sometimes we've got a spiritual condition and we're trying to treat that with medicine and the medicine don't help right and and it's because it's a spiritual condition if you get your life where it was supposed to be if you could get back in that fellowship with god you'd find out maybe this condition would go away especially when it comes to conditions of the mind and of the spirit because that's where satan works on us the most now the doctors couldn't do him any good because it was a spiritual condition so one of the men had passed around and seen a few places they said well we know where there's a divine healer at said why who would that be said jesse's got a son back out there yeah he's a divine healer sure he was he healed by music he had a divine healing ministry he healed by music you realize how important the music is that we play here in the church that we have here in the church because it's a ministry it's not just somebody to get up and play or a job to do it's a ministry and this one had a ministry he david had a ministry he was a divine healer brandon said he had a gift of casting out evil spirits he said the holy ghost hadn't come in those days so he cast him out by music now you can cast him out and this day is cast out by the preaching of the word but yet brother random even allows that even for this day he said he cast him out by music playing the words of the lord he said the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me besides still waters and it disturbed the evil spirit so much that they left saul and so he brings it on down that's still valid for this day as a way of casting out evil spirits he said shame on you people that don't believe in string music now he's talking about the music and that's an important thing for you to understand because people today will tell you music is immoral it doesn't matter it's only the words that matter that's not true the music matters the music matters because the music it's the music itself and then you take words the word of god and put it with that music and you got something right the music itself now you can take beautiful music and put the word of god with it and it'll create an atmosphere i think of the song down from his glory if you know that song it's a beautiful song what an atmosphere of worship when we sing down from his glory together what a what a wonderful atmosphere oh now in that is a classical song it's actually an italian song and i went and got the words of it one time in the original it was a love song and it wasn't anything bad but it was uh it was hilarious actually if you go look it up the translation doesn't make much sense and this guy's standing under somebody's window singing to her and and and so it kind of you know it's like well i don't i don't know if i like that but when you sing it with those words down from his glory ever living story right it's but it you wouldn't put you wouldn't put certain music with those words the music still has to fit does that make sense the music is not immoral it it does take on the character of the words but it's not in itself it has to fit with the words that's why there's certain types of music that you would play at even if the words were good but there are certain types you wouldn't play at certain times and it's something we have to learn and some of you have learned we've got wonderful musicians here at the church and they've learned that when there's a prayer line when there's somebody up here when you're when you're praying up here behind the pulpit or whatever they play softly and and they play something quietly because that kind of music goes with that moment right but there's a moment i've noticed that if you want to get people up from the altar and people are done praying and but they're just kind of a people if you'll change the song to a faster psalm people start getting up there's a reason for that because it it's it's a moving song and sometimes you have to sing a song with faith to get people to realize that that god's let them there at the altar sure so he said shame on you people that don't believe in string music no wonder evil spirits never like it they have to get away david cast out devils by playing on his string instrument another instance of this is in second chronicles 20 21 i've preached on this before and you've heard it preached on i'm sure that when when the king come down i believe it was jehoshaphat he come down and and there was a prophet that come out and spoke amongst the people and then he said if you'll believe the prophets that you'll prosper and that's the verse before this and then he gets the people together they're about to go to battle against the against the ammonites and the moabites it says when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord what an odd thing to do it before a battle but he appointed singers unto the lord that they should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever now that wouldn't be a time to play nearer my god to thee you're about to go out and and have to use a sword that's not a time to play near my god do they they're playing onward christian soldiers or something like that marching right they're playing marching music they're playing music that'll that'll get you you say well it's wrong to stir up people people's emotions by music no it's not wrong to stir people's emotions by music in fact it's necessary what's wrong is when people put their faith in that right so brother branham went against the pentecostal church because he said the only time you can dance is when the music's playing right yeah right and the only time you can sing is when the music's going and the only time you can have churches when there's a lot of music he said that shouldn't be the case you should be able to dance when you're out there by yourself with the lord right you should you shouldn't have to have the music because it's inside of you the music's in here but that'll make the music bad in fact the music is necessary how many times did brother branham call up a musician and didn't begin to play only belief let me tell you something if you've listened to a lot of tapes you know this is true and i know many of you have some of you probably more than i have but i've listened to a lot of tapes and if you go to the prayer lines you know it makes a difference who's on the piano how the prayer line goes how quickly brother branham can get in the atmosphere of the service and they would use certain people to do that it was quite a job to do it because you it took somebody who knew how to play in such a way that it was playing in the holy ghost and it would bring the right kind of an atmosphere you watch some of sometimes the pianist would be off-key or they'd be playing something that wasn't appropriate or something it takes brother branham a lot longer to get in that atmosphere than if they come up playing softly and playing what he had asked him to play it's true go look it up i'm not gonna make that up you'll have to listen to a lot of tapes but you'll find out that's true now brother branham said this he said i remember he was talking about going to phoenix he said i remember the first time in phoenix he said i have a record that was made during that meeting he said i don't think i finished that verse before but it's all right if i go back i'll take too long he said when i get kind of get feeling a little down how many of you kind of get feeling a little down sometimes you say well i believe i'll go listen to brother ben preach well that may make you feel worse he might depend on the sermon right you go listen to me preach and i preach a real convicting sermon then you just oh whoa it's me you know you get feeling real down you turn on straight as the gate and we've heard that certain brother branham preached straight as the gate oh get the feeling down turn that on it's like man lord deliver me yeah right you know turn on you know there's some they're just so somber the unwelcome christ we preached on pride he preached on the meanest man and you talk about the woman watching jesus feed wonderful wonderful worship but it's not gonna make you feel happy right it makes you weep so there's things that that you would do maybe then to if you're getting a little down by the wrestler when he got a little down he said i go play this record i go play this record and if you listen to the music they've cut a lot of it off the tapes but if you can go in here brother outlaws choir it was an upbeat kind of music it was pentecostal music and so he said when we heard these fine songs he said i said to brother outlaw i'm glad they're being taped he said because i like to study that as brother branham says i'm in the office studying he's sitting back there listening to brother outlaw's choir yeah right well that's something you need to study sometimes some of us are too spiritual well i'm going to get myself in trouble tonight we're too spiritual sometimes sometimes you'd be better off going fishing than sitting at home worrying about everything you call it spiritual but if you if you read your bible in a worried state of mind all you oh you're sitting there reading it but your your thoughts are are worried and you're you're sinning while you're reading it you'll be better off going fishing now that's just good practical advice but you could listen to some music and some people music doesn't have the same effect on some people as it does on others but for most people it has a profound effect to listen to music some people i know there's times myself when i just want quiet i just want to think but if you don't want to think listen to music if you really don't want to think listen to it loud that's true science has proved that loud music makes you not think if you want to think that's why if you're studying don't turn on loud music turn on soft music you'll be able to study or maybe even sleep if you want to do that but he said i'd like to study that i like to hear those songs and play the tape here in the songs when you can sit down he said there's nothing like music he said you know god heals by music yes do you know that god heals by music so it's not just me but the job here casting out devils which is what we do by preaching the word not just me up here brother joel or brother stewart or brother allen casting out devils it's not just it's not just us up here or whoever's leading the singing but it's brother joe on the organ or sister carlo on the piano or sister mary on the piano or the organ or one of the brothers on the drums they're casting out devils are you with me now that's an important job devil casting out right so before you go cast out devils say a word of prayer talk to god for a minute get in a spirit in the atmosphere of worship because if you just walk up here and you've been working all day and you just walk up here and you just do it you know give god a few minutes because it's important what you do are you with me now and i'm glad we've got good musicians that i believe that do that but there's nothing like music god heals by music god heals by music god heals my love yeah oh god god heals by medicine yes sir praise the lord i told you i had a lot of troubles with my stomach and the doctor gave me something and god healed me in two ways i believe god healed me i've had less trouble talking but i'm wearing this thing in my ear so you see that that's molded to fit my ear so i can hear myself preach and i don't cut out as often because i'm not putting exerting myself my voice as much because my voice is terrible and it just i was blessed with that i guess so i'm wearing like a hearing aid in my ear basically so i can hear myself preach and then a doctor gave me a pill that i take every day and i believe there will come a day when i won't need it they give me a pill to block the acid in my stomach and that helps it really helps when i eat right too praise god but sometimes god heals that way god heals by prayer god has many ways of healing depends on what type that you need right but we believe we have that we serve a god who when the when the medicine won't work and when the music won't work when nothing else will work but we serve a god who can still heal cancer who can still heal diabetes who can still heal the things that the doctor can't do nothing with we serve a god who still races to death you believe that tonight church god still does that but some of these little things he wants to heal by love that's right you realize you could heal somebody by showing love to him you could heal us he said sometimes a little love stretched out will just cure an old sword oh my a little love stretched out will just cure an old sore an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal it right over just a little love a little care sometimes when you feel down he said as we call it a street expression down in the dumps see just put on one of those tapes oh praise god he said well he's wanting me to listen to his tapes that's not what he's saying that music he's not talking about his own tapes he said put on one of those tapes that music or a record and go to play in it the first thing you know you're patting your foot or your hand it's all over then you're right up and ready to go again aren't you glad god wants to heal you he wants you god don't want you to be frowning all the time god don't want you brother bran we put that quote up on the board god wants you to be happy he wants you to live like little children before the father god didn't intend for us to come all depressed to the house of god all the time worried about everything that's going on i know some of you have been through been to hell and back in your lives i know you've had struggles i know you've been through things but i tell you what this is a place where you can find joy because there's joy in our salvation we don't find joy in our life many times but there is joy in our salvation we don't have to come depressed and down and weary all the time we may come that way but we can come with we can come to a place where we say lord i know you've got this i know you'll take care of me i know when i heard the music and i i saw the smiles on my brother and sister's faces and i saw i began to hear the preaching of the word something happened inside of me and i began to know i'm gonna make it god heals that way the first thing you know you're patting your foot in your hand it's all over then you're right up and ready to go again see one of the marks of depression is that you lose the desire to sing well there's a lot of depressed people in church isn't there am i right brother allen these brothers that lead singing a lot of depressed people in church but you do you lose the desire if you've ever had clinical depression like what they serious depression in your life you just couldn't shake it very good you lose the desire many times to hear singing you lose the desire to sing and to hear singing yeah brother branham talked about getting so old he said i wouldn't enjoy the music no more get cranky and indifferent god help us today yes we don't want to end our lives like that when we get to where we don't want to sing we don't want to hear singing everything bothers us because we're depressed david talked about that in psalm 137 and 1. and i believe actually this was some of the writers later on because it's talking about the the babylon when they went down into babylon were taken captive it says by the rivers of babylon there we set down a we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows that's a country song right there we hanged our hearts upon the willows in the midst thereof for they they they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion because the jews were known for their singing and their dancing and so they said we want you to sing he said how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land oh my god but isaiah speaks of the millennium for the jews that'll be a great time for them when they come back into their land once again in isaiah 35 10 it says and the ransom to the lord shall return and come to zion oh my that place where when they left there they couldn't sing anymore but they'll come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sign shall flee away why they're going to reach a place where they're back in the land again they know they're in god's perfect will again oh god if we only knew listen as christians we today we're in the land we're not waiting to go into a land we're in that spiritual land do you believe that tonight church we're in our land now the bible says he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus ephesians parallels joshua and that's where he placed him in the land paul places us in the land he said you're there so how do we come to zion how do we come to the church how do we come to the house of god we come with singing with everlasting joy upon our heads yes he said come into his presence with singing come with joy why because that's we know we're in the land yes we may be hurting yes there may be things going on around us but there's joy in the house of god because we're in the land they can't take us out of the land you listen as long as the children of israel were there they were blessed they might have had a famine they might have had trouble they might have had people come up against them they might have been fighting wars but as long as they were in the land they were blessed listen to me tonight church as long as you're in the land you're in the land not by your own will but by the predestination of god god put a seed down inside your heart and as long as you know that you're in the land as long as you have that revelation i'm a child of god then nothing can take you out of the land you may get hurt at work you may get hurt at school you may get hurt in the church you may get your feelings hurt you may get depressed you may get down but when you realize you're in the land you can sing are you with me in our church he hath raised us up together listen in the new testament when the book was opened the saints sung a new song worthy of the lamb oh my but saul lost that due to his backslidden condition elisha the prophet you remember elijah followed elijah elisha lost his ability to see visions he was a prophet but he needed to get in the presence of god to see visions now think about it he was still a prophet but he couldn't see a vision until the atmosphere was right i'm a preacher but i can't really preach until the atmosphere is right you're a christian but you can't really receive from god in the way that you ought to until the atmosphere is right how many know that today the atmosphere has to be right so we're talking about music and atmosphere now so saul needed a different atmosphere elisha needed a different atmosphere so what did he do in second kings 3 15. he didn't say now okay so now come and read me the word read me the torah read me the bible he didn't say that he said bring me a minstrel a music a musician a music player and it come to pass when the minstrel played brother branham adds a detail in there i really love he said he played a long time because elijah was in such a bad mood sometimes i don't think we give god enough time to get us out of our bad moods he played a long time and said he he become and the minstrel played and then the hand of the lord came upon him brother branham you said it's a text maybe a dozen times down through his ministry that that verse of scripture he said so they got to play in the music the tambourine he said now listen if you can't be the prophet now notice what type of music that he's listening to now brother branham gives different different songs that he may have been listening to and we know that it was just some type of worshipful music that would be pleasing to god we don't know what the minstrel played but brother branham gave different songs he said meeting in the air one place he said near my god to thee so he used different songs but look how he says it here he said the tambourine he said now listen if you can't be the prophet you can be one of the instruments you say well i'm not preaching today so i hope the preacher is in the right atmosphere so that he can be blessed you're the atmosphere creator right yes you know why it's so hard to keep this building cool in the summer because of you and me body heat right a bunch of us get together it's hard to keep the building cool right especially as the units get older it's harder it's harder to keep the building cool because when we come in that's why when we have a meeting we have a bunch of people need these these chairs will be full and when these chairs get full it gets really hot because of the people yeah right you're creating an atmosphere you realize you do that in a spiritual realm as well whenever you're there it creates an atmosphere i'd go as far as to say when you're not there it creates an atmosphere now that's something you can't do you see they feel they say well we can just do all this at home we'll do our religion at home you can't create an atmosphere for the preacher at home you can receive of the word and i'm glad that many of you are watching tonight and i'm happy to be able to do that but you can't give in the way that you would give when you were here because you're creating an atmosphere for me while i'm preaching right you're creating an atmosphere not just for me but for the word you're heating things up or cooling them down i love the way brother ron spencer put that not long ago he said we've got ice machine preachers producing ice cubes all over the audience because the atmosphere the atmosphere up here affects the atmosphere out there but it works the other way too the atmosphere out there affects the atmosphere up here so we don't want it to be cold in one part of the church and hot in another part but we want the whole thing to be on fire for god amen so he said you can't you may not be the prophet but you can be one of the instruments yes you know that plays the music to bring the spirit down on the prophet he said so they begin to play the tambourine and so forth and beat the drums how would that get him you see the the music is a tool yeah right it's a tool and the tool here he's gonna the minstrel is gonna use the tool to get elisha out of his bad mood right so he may have to beat some drums might have to play a tambourine we don't know what he did but whatever he did it worked right whether it was soft whether it was hard but brother branham in this place he said he beat the drums and played the instruments and all of them began to beat and play and had a great big old song maybe playing up and he goes meeting in the air meeting in the air oh there's going to be a meeting in the air oh i believe that don't you does that song make you happy yeah unless you have a hard time playing it i always had a hard time playing it right that song makes you happy now look now he said a great big old song now if you had a if you had a musical number or if you've ever been to a play a musical you forgive me for getting carnal tonight but again i think sometimes we think too much up here and we don't realize our lives would be could be simply affected by little simple things that go on could really make a major change in our lives so now here if you've ever been to a musical you know that at the end there's a big number right they get everybody up they don't end usually on a sad note you end with a big number and the reason for that is because you want people to leave happy right that's why they end the way that they do because they want people to leave in the right atmosphere because if they leave unhappy they'll girls say what did i spend my money and you want them to go tell somebody else you want to walk down the street and say hey you wouldn't believe how that was well you slept through most of it but i left happy all right so brother brown said that's what they did for the prophet they had a great big old song playing meeting in the air or some song like that the prophet began to get in the spirit of the first thing you know when he got in the spirit things began to happen you forgive me but if i want to get in the spirit and i want my wife to get in the spirit i don't play near my god to thee nothing wrong with that song by the way i love that song but i keep mentioning it because it's really slow if i if i want to get my wife in the mood to love me excuse me for being too carnal tonight but it's just the fact i do want my wife sometimes to show me affection she wants her to me to show her affection we don't do this very often but you know what you do you you do have a nice candlelight dinner and you cook the steak you get everything just right and get rid of the kids and everything just right what do you do you set an atmosphere and you play music you play music and you don't play church music usual well maybe some of you do i don't know as the deer during weddings that's kinda some of you may do that but usually i play a love song not some crazy song but just something good you understand and that gets me in the atmosphere sometimes i need it more than she does it gets us in the atmosphere right that's what we're doing in church it's not the holy ghost that's not the holy ghost maybe in some some types of churches i almost said something there i'll tell you later maybe in some types of churches that organs the holy ghost maybe in some other types of churches the pianos the holy ghost or the drums i've known some pentecostal churches like that that's not the holy ghost but it's a tool not to bring the holy ghost but to get us in the right yeah atmosphere the holy ghost is here the prophet was already a prophet he didn't have to make himself a prophet the music wasn't making him a prophet it was getting him in the right atmosphere to see a vision yes amen he said the spirit got on the prophet he said they begin to the prophet get begin to get in the spirit and the first thing you know things begin to happen they begin to get to clap in their hands and maybe they're having a good time in church surely not i can't stand for people not to have a good time in church i have a hard time with it and i know some people their resting face is not good have a hard time man it's like how did he he woke up that way but i know some people are happy and they just don't show it like other people do sometimes i look like i'm happy and i'm not so that's just fair warning but they uh you know you want people to be in the right atmosphere you want people to be happy but the random says they begin to have a good time there's no reason why we can't have a good time in church i won't be just a frolic because there's times right there's a time in a season when we want it to be solid there's a time when that sweet presence of the holy spirit comes in and we just want to bask in that you don't want to break that up i used to have a piano player not here i'm not getting after any of our piano players but i used to have a piano player a long time ago many moons to go on a galaxy far away i had i had a piano player who would always break into the prayer at the end we'd get real solid and you'd be having an altar call and she'd just start playing go down the thing and just play loud and hard and man i just i got to where i dreaded it because i said sister now play softly you know because what will happen is what will happen is it will it will make it'll set the wrong atmosphere a wrong atmosphere for the service and people start being happy but you want them to think you want them to be introspective but you don't want to stay that way godly sorrow works repentance not to be repented of go look it up it's in the bible god at least sorrow works for penis not to be repented of you don't stay there the sorrow of this world works death you don't stay in that condition but you want to get up to where you're able to be happy in christ that's the position you want to stay in right now but there's a time and a place for everything now he said they began to have a good time and the spirit of god began to fall in the prophet the spirit god on the prophet he began to see things he said you'll go to seeing things when you get in the spirit he said i was talking to a man not home ago that didn't believe in music in the church he was holding a fuss with me about it he said oh the music belongs to the world i said the spirit of god didn't come on that stood up prophet until he got the minstrel out began to play a good old-fashioned holy ghost song and the spirit of god come down on the prophet that's right god doesn't change if god liked music in that day god likes music today he said i tell you brother when we get all the formal shackles shook down and the spirit of god in the songs again get back to an old place where we can have the spirit of god moving in the place then the prophet can see a vision then the powers of god comes in the church he said then they can see divine healing then they can see the resurrection of christ how many want to see that well we can do that by getting in the right atmosphere for it preparing our hearts for the word amen he said then the prophet can see a vision the powers of god comes on the church you can see divine healing you see the resurrection of christ they can see us the same yesterday today and forever well you say brother branham i'm not the prophet well if you ain't the prophet you can be one of the instruments anyhow just keep playing yes that's right you ain't got no more than them ten just give vent to them just as hard as you can if it's a clapping song clap i'm not yelling at you but it's if it's a clapping song it won't hurt you well maybe it will if you've got some condition where it does i'll excuse you you are excused but if you don't have some condition that would hurt you to clap clap what are you doing you're not sitting there saying make me happy preacher make me a happy singer no you're getting in the spirit of it yourself you're adding something to the service yes you ain't got no more than them 10 just give it to them as hard as you can if you can't be the prophet be part and by the way that works the other way too if it's not a clapping song don't clap if you can't be the prophet be part of the minstrels do something to bring the spirit of the lord down how we can commit to that i'm gonna bring do something we got serious cases we got people that need god we got kids that need god we've got people around here need god we need to fill up this church with sinners that need to be seeking god how are we going to do that by getting the atmosphere right not just the atmosphere in the church but the atmosphere in our homes the atmosphere in our vehicles the atmosphere on the job amen and when the problem he said the prophet couldn't do it himself he couldn't do it himself he had to have the minstrel to help him amen he said when the prophet and the people got in harmony with god that's what we talked about sunday night when the prophet and the people got in harmony with god the prophet began to see things and they went out he said they got all the music i'm reading from different places where brother branham talked about this just pulling a few quotes many many quotes he said they got to play in the music some real good hymn the first thing you know when they when they songs return to zion when the music and the children begin to sing from their heart something takes place it's not a concert you're singing from your heart the spirit of the lord came on the prophet and if a real old-fashioned godly singing and repenting would bring the spirit of god on the prophet then it'll do the same thing today oh hallelujah he said and notice he wanted to see the way out and the only way out that they could do would be to have a revival maybe you're caught up in something tonight you won't you can't see the way out maybe this generational thing has come down on you this family curse and you can't seem to get over it you keep making the same mistakes over and over again maybe the way to get out of it you can't see a way out have a revival you say well you're not having a revival you don't have anything scheduled well we do have a meeting scheduled but don't wait for the meeting you have a revival brother said when they bring a a special speaker and he said that's not the revival for you the revival for you is when you're washing the dishes and and you're standing there weeping because of the the blessings of god and you're rejoicing and worshiping god that's the revival for you and you bring that kind of revival to the house of god we'll have church yes sir he had a revival so he had some repentant sinners come in and the music played and the prophet saw a vision the only way you're ever going to see your way out is an old-fashioned spiritual revival oh lord give me a revival yes where the hallelujahs of god is ringing from the bottom of your heart in an old-fashioned holy ghost scent revival hits the place then you begin to see things then god will begin to reveal things yes now what is music again it's a tool and it affects your emotions that's what it's supposed to do all right i remember years ago brother ron spencer again i'm on why i'm thinking of him tonight but ron i heard him say years ago he said he said brother ron i'm afraid i'll get in the flesh he said what else are you going to get in you're not raptured yet see it's emotions god uses that yeah that's not where we put our faith we don't put our faith in how we feel right or how loud the service was or how well the people played the piano or the organ or the how well the preacher preached thank god we don't put our faith in the in the goodness of the preacher or the eloquence of the preacher we put our faith in god our faith is in an unchanging god and god is his word we put our faith in the word emotions don't last neither does a bath but you like to take one now and then right i don't last but i like to feel it now and then i'll tell you what if you could ever get inside the holy of holies you know the difference in the outside of the holy of holies is on the inside and the holy holy they had that all the time right and i do believe a christian has it all the time in here sometimes we just have to let it out and part of getting in revival is just getting out of the way and letting the holy spirit sometimes we need music to do that yeah just to get us out of the way sometimes we need to we need love to do that just to get ourselves out we need to we need some positivity to do that because you say well i'm a christian i can take it no sometimes you need some positivity to get out of that to where you can get past your flesh brother branham said if you could see listen to me i'm talking about a real god tonight if you could see he said pass the veil of your flesh he said you'd see angels at their position on every pew yes they're there they are there they are not waiting on something to happen they're there if you could get past what passed the veil of flesh you'd see like hazel they said lord open his eyes and he saw there were chariots of fire a horseman of fire right amen but emotions don't last and that's why saul david would have to come back yeah and play come back and play appreciate those amens back there david come back and play he kept having to come back and it came to pass first samuel 18 6. now watch he got to feeling pretty good david was helping him david become like the associate pastor he was his armor bearer that's a warrior that's a king's associate pastor it says armor bearer and it came to pass to say came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women now watch he's gone out there and killed goliath what a wonderful time what a joy the women came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabarets with joy and with instruments of music what a wonderful service you'd have thought this would have put saul in a good mood but his problem was deeper yes sir and the women answered one another now he may have been in a good mood at first till he got to hearing what they were saying and the women answered one another as they played and said saul preaches some pretty good sermons oh saul he's pretty good but that little david every once in a while have somebody tell me i know you don't mean it wrong he said man brother joel did a good job man brother allen did a good job and i preached that morning and i'm like well [Laughter] i know you don't mean bad these brothers can wait out preach me i just we can't really let that on okay don't tell nobody but they come out and they begin to say it's all saints thousands he's a good preacher but david is ten thousands it's a masterpiece and saul got angry bible said he was very rough and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands media described by thousands and here comes that generational curse here comes that family curse he was little in his own side he never got over the insecurity he says what can he have more but the kingdom david would have never done it he proved that because he could have killed him and taken the kingdom and he wouldn't do it proved on multiple occasions he would have never done it but saul got it in his mind yeah sure because it's just the way he was raised and the way he was born you understand he was a man of god but he just couldn't get past that and verse 9 says in saul i'd david from that day forward verse 10 it came to pass on tomorrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul here it comes again no this is strange the evil spirit came down and he prophesied he preached remember i told you there's a couple things you never want to do angry one of them was preach i think the other one i said was never don't spank your kids or talk to your wife when you're angry don't correct your wife make your kids or preach a sermon in anger he prophesied in the midst of the house he was preaching he come out to preach his sermon there was a javelin in his hand he gets to the point he gets so stirred up in his preaching he thinks it's the lord think about it he prophesied he thought it was god it was an evil spirit from god god allowed to come on him he thought it was god and it was the complex speaking he thought it was god and it was the depression speech we better be careful what we ascribe to god oh but i got this revelation but you put it on god and what did it make you do how did it make you he took the javelin he said i will smite david even to the wall with it i'll pin him down he'll never get out yeah and david avoided out of his presence twice two different services david had to run for his life because saul took up the javelin and threw it at him oh my why didn't the music work this time see he wasn't you know what time it is i'm sorry i'm it's time to close he's he wasn't just depressed this time but he was also jealous right that needed there was a different cure yeah he needed to do some repenting i wasn't able to do it the spirit that had troubled him now possessed him listen to me as we close musicians can go ahead and come i'm going to skip over some of this you can use music or counseling if i read that clock right it's time to close you can use music or counseling or anything else to help if you struggle with depression if you struggle with anxiety but if you don't ever deal with your backslidden heart if it's an evil spirit from the lord it may not be but if it is it won't last see god wants to use music to get you in a condition to believe the word brother said it's the attitude of the people that brings the results he said that's the reason that pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord he said it's the atmosphere that brings the results do you believe that you believe that tonight he said let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning he said that's right it's atmosphere right and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous yes and wonders and powers of god among the people it's the atmosphere of what of the people and when people get to a place they're reasoning and wandering and stewing and thinking realize what sometimes god uses a preacher to get loud and get in your face he wants you to stop thinking start receiving i hope you hear me today you're thinking about what's going on you're thinking about something i said you're thinking about something that i said earlier maybe then and it bothered you and you're still thinking about that but sometimes you've got to the spirit will move me to change my voice and and speak directly to you because when you're reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and don't know where you stand he said half of them not even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be right it's got to be in one accord one place and settle down with one motive one thing then you're going to see something happen he said put the right kind of a music on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that jesus christ is there that's the atmosphere we want it's an atmosphere of faith he said i'm going to meet everything that happened though something will go to taking place he said but that's the hardest thing there is to do that is to get people in the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing he said any person that ever come into that atmosphere one time will never be satisfied nowhere else yes sir can you say amen to that tonight any person that ever come oh i appreciate good services and i'm glad we have a good atmosphere here but oh i long for the time when we just get lost in the spirit we've had a few services like that and i don't mean just get dancing and running but just a time when it feels like the spirit of god is so strong that you're just lost in it the preacher can't preach too long it don't matter what's going on around you because you're lost in that atmosphere there's something just going on it's happening all around you he said that's why i believe that we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost not by some denomination somewhere not by some message preacher somewhere trying to control another church but that's why i believe we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost that men and women in their work and wherever they should be should continually desire and they will if they've ever once come into that atmosphere hallelujah amen would you bow your heads with me amen if you play something do you believe [Music] if you believe [Music] what do you believe do you believe he's here what'd i tell you sunday he didn't say i will be in their midst he said i am in the midst thereof there i am oh god that means he's here tonight if the atmosphere is right and i believe it is all things are possible but it's wednesday night i don't limit god oh it's just another service just be our pastor don't limit god unless you let it have a need tonight if you struggle maybe with a spirit of depression maybe it don't come from the lord but he does allow all these things to come on us but maybe it's not something that we've done maybe it's just we struggle with that maybe it's in our friends and our family we just struggle with that why don't you get in the atmosphere of worship one time that thing will begin to fall that worry will begin to fall when you begin to worship an omnipotent god how could you worry about what you wear what you'll eat when you begin to get in an atmosphere that that you begin to believe they say that when brother branham was on the field when you walked under the tent i remember a pentecostal man assembly of god man it was in those meetings found out we believed in a prophet and he come and he told us he said i was there he said and i remember he said when people it was different under brother browner's tent all the other pentecostals had their their show and their things that they would do he said but when you walked under brother branham's tent you would just begin to weep he said and people were healed just by walking under the tent because the atmosphere was right oh god oh god that didn't that atmosphere didn't leave the earth when brother branham died it's still here he's still brooding the holy ghost the holy spirit is still brooding over the church wanting to bring things right wanting to to bring out the flowers wanting to bring the seeds that have been planted the word has been planted in your life to fruition let him do it tonight let him brood over you not just tonight but as we leave here tomorrow the next day at work he said anybody who's ever been in that atmosphere always wants to get back in it may that be us this week we'll come sunday morning and say i'm ready i'm ready to come and be in an atmosphere of worship i'm ready to sing i'm ready to rejoice i'm ready to worship god do you believe if you believe all things are possible heavenly father lord we believe tonight and i believe with all of my heart there's a people of god here lord is such a privilege to preach to him lord being the sons and daughters of god the pride of jesus christ but oh god when you just come in this place lord move aside every doubt every worry every fear every bit of depression i know sometimes it's hard for us and some of us have been through so much and some of us are just not naturally affected as much emotionally but oh god may on a deep of the deep lord the deep calling to the deep may there be something deep inside of us not just an outward show not just an outward emotion but something on the inside that begins to respond back to the word and say lord i believe i believe that you're here i believe you're the same yesterday today and forever i believe you still heal the sick i believe you still you still put money in the bank i believe you still provide jobs to those who need them i believe you still give people to what they have need of i believe that you still heal the minds of the people i believe you still drive away anxiety i believe you still drive away depression i believe you're still god oh my lord if we could just believe that way lord we would come under this atmosphere and right now every every sick person could be healed every every depressed spirit would leave and we could rejoice in the word of god in the spirit of god we thank you for it we believe that atmosphere is here lord may we ever keep it lord may we ever keep the atmosphere right in the church lord not let anything break that lord when we leave it and we always long for it the heart and we can create that atmosphere even in our homes even lord around our table lord even even when we pray together as a family even when we come together lord may that atmosphere still be there when we work lord may it still be there so that the world can't bother us shut us in lord in the holy of holies where the shekinah glory is until the world and the things of the world have no place anymore until we only have you i pray you granted lord move to the musicians and and the song leader lord may you soothe every troubled heart preach lord through the music in psalms and hymns psalms and hymns and spiritual songs i pray you grant it now we thank you for all that you've given us thank you for a good atmosphere lord may we keep it all the days of our life we pray in jesus name amen amen amen it's that simple if you believe he's here you receive
