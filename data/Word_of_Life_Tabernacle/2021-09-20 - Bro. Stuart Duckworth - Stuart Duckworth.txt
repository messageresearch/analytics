can we can be the washed bride of the lord jesus christ amen washed by the bleeding word amen amen we just certainly love the lord tonight and just happy to be here in the house of the lord and just thankful to be in his presence amen amen if we could we'll turn the scripture tonight due to romney the second chapter the third verse deuteronomy 2 and 3. let's just buy our hearts for a moment for prayer let's just talk to him if you'd have a need to not just lift that up to god he knows your need your situation let's just talk to him just for a moment lord we come to you tonight lord lord your people lord your chosen people here tonight your bride lord and lord we're just believing lord that we're your people and that you're our god lord and we just come tonight in the service father and lord just give it back to you lord may you just receive all glory and all honor and any praise may it be given to you to not father we just ask that you bless the word to your people's hearts lord may i be able to step aside lord that you can come to speak this one word lord that would mean so much to us tonight lord and lord may we just lord have the mind of god tonight we pray and we just ask you bless your word we ask in jesus name amen amen due to romney two and three and the lord spoke and said you have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward amen you can be seated tonight amen god speaking speaking here telling the children of israel he said you've you've come past this mountain long enough amen for 40 years they went around the same old mountain on a journey a man on the same old mountain on a journey to a land that god had promised them and then they can pass this same mountain and that word can pass is to turn turn about around a side back towards go around surround and circle change direction so for 40 years they had wandered in the wilderness going to the land that god had promised them but just going every which way going around and around but that which would only truly be a few days journey turned into 40 years of wandering around amen we just want to stir up your pure minds and not by way of remembrance as the bible says amen we want to awaken our minds by the word and that's what the word must do to us in this hour amen to stir our spirits to stir us up amen to remember what the prophets have spoken the apostles our lord jesus and knowing that that peter said just speaking of the condition that peter said in the last days scoffers would come saying where is the promise of his coming amen it would be a spirit of unbelief that would mock the word and it mocks what we as christians are trying to uphold and this hour the goal that we're trying to get to what we're trying what we're trying to go amen amen and we've been called out of this world out of the systems of man to the word amen to be changed to be different to become the word and then we've been called to come out come out from the world to come up amen as john in the in the book of revelations to come up higher amen amen so the world would try to belittle that amen and it would be easy it would be easy if you don't keep yourself shook if you don't keep yourself awake and stirred up by the word to just to fall under that under that sleepiness and i think of the message that god that brother branham spoke and recognizing your daily message just how he would how he would say to us that he was trying to prepare for this but but he was fighting tiredness fighting sleepiness and that he said that satan was trying to cause that amen and if we're not careful we'll find ourselves in this hour falling under that that spirit of tiredness amen but the word has come to shake us amen we're in a journey amen we're in a journey no doubt we're in the wilderness we're on the way to the promise we're on the on the way to the rapture the promise of the rapture amen we've got to re we've got to shake ourselves by the word we've got to stay stirred up because there is a spirit of unbelief there's a spirit that would mock what we're trying to do amen so we're going somewhere we're going somewhere amen and you know we're we're trying to sell our home and and lord willing we will but you know everybody asks well where are you moving to when when you moving up here where where are you going brother andrew glover he asked me you know where are you moving out of state i say yeah i am he said where i said i'm going up yonder i'm going up yonder to be with my lord i mean i i don't know where i'm going we're just selling our house we don't know what we're going to do we're we don't have it together you know we just ain't got things together but we're going to try to sell our house anyways but everybody always wants to know what are you doing where are you going well i'll let you know when i get there but we've got a goal you know this world isn't our home you know we may move here we may go here and you can say that you're not going to do something you say i'll never do that and i don't have any goals of moving off or doing anything crazy but you just never know where you'll be in five years ten years you you just never know you say you won't do something and you'll be right there doing it or you'll you'll have you'll have a uh something that you want to do amen but is it the lord's will you know and the bible says that we should say lord willing if it be the lord's will we'll do this so lord willing we'll sell our house [Music] amen we're going up yonder tonight amen we all have that same goal we're all we're all going to that same place we may not live in the same neighborhood but we're all we've all got the same goal tonight amen hebrews 11 8 it says by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went the bible says by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise amen we're heirs of that same promise tonight amen amen we're heirs amen and the bible says for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god amen i believe tonight that we are the seed of abraham amen we are heirs of the promise do you believe that tonight and we as abraham we are sojourners in this land amen we're pilgrims and strangers and then walking by faith walking towards the promise walking towards what god has showed us in this hour and then we're seeking a city and we're seeking a place that has eternal foundations not something that's going to give away and crumble and be destroyed and be burned amen but i'm seeking a city tonight that has a foundation has an eternal foundation amen whose builder and maker is god and then john saw that same city abraham met the king of that city in melchizedek but john saw that city coming down the as a as coming down from god out of heaven you get tongue-tied there john saw that same city amen and we're searching amen we're going to a place where we're preparing to go to that place that's what we're trying to do now we're preparing ourselves we're walking by faith towards that promise amen in this word this message amen and i believe that it has inspired amen this word this message the holy ghost the holy spirit in this hour has inspired us amen that there is a place amen that there is a place beyond the darkness of this age be beyond the darkness and the corruptness and the evil and the unbelief and the spirit of mockery and there's a place beyond all this that we're going to and it inspires us it makes us want to live right it makes us want to it makes us want to live right live according to his word amen we are inspired amen amen we are not to wonder here aimlessly amen never never finding our position you know toss to and fro amen but we as a people are here to walk by faith amen to to be stabilized amen to have a sure foundation to know to know what we believe to know in whom we believe amen amen not wondering about from pillar to post amendment finding our position finding our position in christ and that is part of our maturity part of our perfection is to find that position and then find your place in the word not to try to take somebody else's place but find your place in the word and stay there and stand there amen and walk by faith and walk in the will of god knowing amen in whom you believe in what you believe and then we are to be stabilized i don't have covert i hope i don't excuse me excuse me amen amen to find our place to be stabilized amen to be about the father's business amen to be about the word be about what the word has called us to be and meant to be about the task at hand amen amen and that's all of us amen to be about the word amen and turning northward brother brown said it would be hard for israel to think that the promised land was 40 years away when they were standing on the other side of the red sea dancing shouting rejoicing when they were only merely just a few days from it so here they were 40 years from it little did they know 40 years from it here standing on the other side of the red sea seeing their their enemies destroyed rejoicing having a pentecostal jubilee but yet it would be 40 years away amen brother branham said by walking you could make it in two days three or something like that amen you could go on to the promised land and just think of that it was right there it was right there but here they were wandering around in the wilderness going around and around and around the same old mountain amen and if you find yourself in that condition tonight and and we're all in a journey tonight we're all wandering around amen we're all we're all in a journey together towards the promise amen and no doubt it seems like it's taken longer than it should no doubt it seems like you just wonder when it will get there but god has a plan he allows things in the word and then he allows these things that have happened in the word amen for our edification amen to show us amen amen the journey that we're on amen who knew 30 40 years ago as as people come out of the end of the message and they come out of the denominations who knew that they would be here this long amen my parents and your parents say none of them thought that we would be this far along but yeah here we are and you begin to think of it in that in that wilderness journey i'm getting way ahead of myself here but i'm going to go ahead and do it there was a generation that had to come it wasn't time yet but there was a generation that had to come and the old fighters had to die off is that right i'll try not to get too too far ahead of myself here amen so here they were wondering wandering around and around the same old mountain amen but we've got to move on don't don't find yourself wandering around going back and going around and going every which way we've got to go in a line we've got to go towards the promise amen don't don't find yourself wandering around amen they were wandering around that mountain yet there laid the promise there laid the promising land just a few days journey but a few days turned into 40 years amen but there came a time when god spoke amen he said you have compassed this mountain long enough and then you have been in this condition long enough now is the time and brother branham says here an invisible union of the bride of christ he said some of you people that really believed this to be the truth that were entering another age were entering the raptured age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse i mean he said how many knows that say amen he said it's got to get worse and it can't go like this he said it's got to be something instead it's it's moving now he said friend it's on he said the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the lord and when the prophet amen directing his people as moses directed those people you have come past this mountain long enough amen we say it in these systems and man we've cowed down on denomination we've cowed down on these ideas it's time to move on with the word and man you've come past this long enough you've stayed in this condition long enough hey man it's the bright age it's the rapture age and then the prophet was directing it to you and i showing us and then calling us by the word to come out and he said the move is on for the bride it's thus saith the lord the bride won't stay in any old condition and then if she finds herself in the condition she'll be shook by the word she'll be changed by the word the move is on for the bride amen she won't stay here but she'll move on up so we must move up from this age we must move up from the conditions of this age even the lukewarm and the relaxed spirit and as brother earth said it will only get worse the church in his condition it will only get worse as time goes on the world will only get worse the condition and the sin and the darkness and we can we can we can testify that we're experiencing that and then it's as crazy and insane as it's ever been it can only get worse amen but i believe tonight thus saith the lord according to the word of the lord according to the prophet that the move is on for you and i tonight amen we're getting closer we're getting closer every single day amen you've got to believe that you've got to shake yourselves in this time amen i believe that tonight amen and those that live in the condition of this age will never make a rapture amen but you must be awakened by the word to be prepared for the rapture amen do you believe that tonight amen the bride will move with the spirit she will move as the spirit moves she won't stay she won't stay cowed down in a certain camp but she'll move as the spirit moves do you believe that tonight and then she's not going back she's not going back in the world she's not going back amen and to cow down on some belief or some man-made system she's not going back to those things but she's moving up she's moving them with the spirit of god she's moving on with the word amen and the move is on and we must step
