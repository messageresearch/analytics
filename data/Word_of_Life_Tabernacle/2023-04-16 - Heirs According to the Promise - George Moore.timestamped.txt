[37:45] um there's a quote that's been uh
[37:47] not it's not I'm not going to preach on
[37:49] that this morning but it's a quote it's
[37:50] kind of been my my rallying cry the past
[37:53] couple months or so and and sometimes
[37:56] you just read a scripture or you read
[37:58] something a message that just it just
[38:00] kind of speaks to you and this has been
[38:02] that for me and uh it's from the message
[38:05] of why and brother Branham makes this
[38:08] statement he said we just don't know
[38:11] what lays ahead yet tonight he says I
[38:16] like that because you can be expecting
[38:18] just anything to happen
[38:22] and he says we don't know just what time
[38:26] that God might just come into us here
[38:29] and just give us another Pentecost and
[38:34] Saints I love that this morning I I love
[38:37] that we serve the almighty God today and
[38:40] and I love that the possibilities today
[38:43] are endless I love that God can do
[38:47] anything he chooses to do for you and I
[38:50] today I love that we don't know just
[38:53] what lays ahead yet we we don't know
[38:55] what might happen in this service we

[38:59] don't know what things God can work for
[39:01] us we we know he's the same yesterday
[39:04] today and forever we know that he still
[39:06] heals the sick we know that he still
[39:08] raises the dead we we know that he still
[39:11] gives the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[39:13] know these things we don't know what he
[39:16] might do for us today I love that
[39:19] and he said we don't know just when God
[39:22] might just come into us here and just
[39:24] give us another Pentecost and I I don't
[39:27] know why Pentecost got to be a bad word
[39:30] Saints but I'm not talking about
[39:31] Pentecost like an organization I'm
[39:34] talking about Pentecost like I'm a
[39:36] Believer and I got a Pentecostal
[39:38] experience
[39:40] the Lord yes sir I'm not talking about
[39:42] Pentecost like I'm trying to uh work
[39:45] something up I'm talking about I believe
[39:46] in a Pentecostal blessing for the
[39:49] believer he said that's what we need so
[39:52] I've indicated Prophet said today that
[39:54] that's what we need is another Pentecost

[41:35] neither male nor female for ye are all

[41:41] and if you be Christ then you are
[41:44] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[41:48] the promise let's just bow our heads
[41:51] Heavenly Father we thank you today that

[42:23] exceedingly abundantly father above what
[42:26] we could even think or ask for I ask you
[42:28] to Watch Over Me Lord and bind my lips

[42:34] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:37] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[42:40] seated and all right brother turn to
[42:42] monitors halfway back to where we just
[42:44] came from
[42:45] amen all right so I'm gonna take these
[42:48] glasses off I don't really need the
[42:49] glasses to to read I'm just really dumb
[42:53] and I think the glasses make me look
[42:55] smarter so
[42:58] and I'd like to take a little text this
[43:00] morning on errors according to the
[43:02] promise airs according to the promise
[43:05] and and I come across this a few months
[43:08] ago I was getting together uh the
[43:11] documents needed uh to get a passport
[43:13] for my wife and and we were going to
[43:16] Canada I was holding some meetings up in
[43:17] Saskatoon or or close to Saskatoon and
[43:20] as I got to researching getting the
[43:23] documents together we were missing uh uh
[43:25] her her birth certificate didn't have
[43:27] her parents names on it and so if you've
[43:30] ever tried to get a passport they're
[43:31] really particular about it and there's a
[43:33] given number of things you got to have
[43:35] and if you don't have those things
[43:37] then what they'll do is there's some
[43:39] substitute documents that you can have
[43:41] and so uh I got to research in those
[43:44] substitute documents and I I uh what I
[43:47] found was that you can get many of the
[43:48] documents that you need off of a website
[43:51] called ancestry.com anybody looked at
[43:54] that
[43:56] yeah y'all have
[43:58] well it's probably a gimmick all right
[44:00] but uh it but they got it set up to hook
[44:03] you and so I got in there plugging in my
[44:06] relatives and plugging in you know my
[44:07] father mother and then their parents and
[44:09] and I got to research it and and before
[44:11] you know it I've been on that thing an
[44:13] hour plugging in names and finding out
[44:15] who my uh genealogy was now anybody done
[44:18] that this morning
[44:19] and so so I was I was punching all that
[44:21] stuff in and and uh I come to the the
[44:24] realization saints that I don't really
[44:27] come from much
[44:30] and uh I was a little bit uh discouraged
[44:34] I might be discouraged ain't the right
[44:36] word maybe disappointed it would be the
[44:37] right reason right word is is to say
[44:40] that I didn't come from a religious
[44:42] family would be an understatement
[44:44] Brother David I had to go back 250 years
[44:47] in my genealogy to find any record of
[44:50] anybody that had been baptized or went
[44:52] to church anywhere and so and so to to
[44:54] say I didn't come from very much that's
[44:56] that's an understatement and I I you
[44:59] know what I want if if you children if
[45:01] you are born into a message home you are
[45:04] blessed today
[45:06] you're a blessed person to be born into
[45:09] the message of the hour it's it's a
[45:10] blessing to be but to be born into that
[45:12] and if you're but that's just not the
[45:14] hand that I was given it's not how I
[45:16] came up I didn't come up that way that's
[45:18] what I want for my children that's what
[45:20] I want for my grandchildren is to be
[45:22] raised in the message of the hour it's
[45:24] just not what my hand was it's not how I
[45:26] was brought up and and I had to go back
[45:28] 250 years to find anybody that even went
[45:31] to church in my family and so that's how
[45:33] it was but brothers and sisters I'll
[45:34] tell you this
[45:36] Levi paid tithes when he was in the
[45:39] loins of of Abraham is that right and so
[45:43] when Levi came into the into the word
[45:45] and he came into the when he came into
[45:47] the world he he was blessed when he came
[45:51] because of what Abraham had done before
[45:53] him amen and if you and you were born in
[45:56] the message you were blessed when you
[45:57] got here amen if your parents loved the
[46:00] Lord and you were raised in a message
[46:01] home you were blessed when you got here
[46:04] but I'll tell you this Saints if you
[46:06] can't be a Levi you can be an Abraham
[46:09] [Applause]
[46:12] you might not have been born into the
[46:15] best circumstances but you can start the
[46:17] blessing for your home
[46:21] you might not have come into the message
[46:23] of the hour in your home but you can
[46:25] start it for future Generations if there
[46:27] is any amen you can start and you may
[46:29] not be Levi today but you can be Abraham
[46:32] today
[46:35] is that right thanks
[46:37] and we find in our natural lineage and
[46:40] our natural genealogy that we get all
[46:42] kinds of problems that can be passed
[46:44] down into that there's all kinds of
[46:46] things that you can get that are uh
[46:48] unpleasing characteristics from your
[46:50] family saints come on somebody this
[46:53] morning I wish y'all helped me preach a
[46:55] little bit yeah and if you got a
[46:57] especially if you got a background like
[46:58] mine there's all kind of stuff you're
[47:00] going to get and and and you know uh you
[47:02] may not be able to to do anything about
[47:05] some of these negative attributes we
[47:07] find brother Branham in the message
[47:09] talks extensively about it and he talks
[47:11] a lot about complexes and he talks about
[47:14] sickness and infirmity and and these
[47:16] things that can be passed down from
[47:18] generation to generation to generation
[47:20] these things can be passed down to you
[47:22] and I today
[47:24] amen you know and and even if it's not a
[47:27] negative characteristic even if it's not
[47:29] a negative attribute you're going to
[47:31] find Saints as you get older you just do
[47:34] things the way your parents did them
[47:37] I remember seeing my dad do things and
[47:39] thought I will never do that I'll never
[47:41] do that and I have to fight to the nail
[47:43] not to be just like that today
[47:47] there's just things and ways that we
[47:48] have about us they're just they're just
[47:51] it's like our parents it's like your mom
[47:52] it's like your dad it's like your
[47:54] grandparents you just do things you have
[47:55] ways the same and so we find it all this
[47:58] that builds up and and you know like for
[48:00] example when my grandson when he's
[48:03] throwing a fit my wife looks at him and
[48:05] says well he's a more
[48:12] yeah now I'm assuming she's not talking
[48:15] about his rugged good looks I I'm
[48:17] assuming it's this terrible disposition
[48:19] that she's talking about
[48:21] we just got waves
[48:23] come on somebody's got waves
[48:27] and we find in our natural bloodline
[48:29] that we can get complexes and and I know
[48:31] we know about complexes but I don't know
[48:33] if we recognize or realize how much
[48:36] complex is control what we do and how
[48:38] much they impact how we live our life
[48:40] and and you do things subconsciously
[48:42] that you don't realize it and it and it
[48:45] builds up in your life and it just it it
[48:47] changes the way you behave and act and
[48:49] you find it there's many times where
[48:51] things will upset you or things will
[48:52] bother you that don't make no sense why
[48:54] they bother you has anybody here ever
[48:56] been mad and you don't know why you're
[48:58] mad you're just mad about it for
[48:59] something for no reason it's it's a
[49:01] complex it builds up and and it bothers
[49:03] you and it impacts your life and it
[49:05] impacts her relationships and these kind
[49:07] of things and there's no rational reason
[49:09] why
[49:11] and brother Brown says my Christian
[49:12] Brother's sister he say he's talking
[49:14] about somebody had a stubborn complex
[49:16] now now he said stubbornness was a
[49:18] complex now I'm preaching on that I know
[49:20] ain't nobody in this church dealing with
[49:21] that today I'm just telling you like for
[49:23] other churches y'all go tell them about
[49:25] it all right he said come on
[49:27] my Christian brother sister whoever may
[49:29] be now most times when you find people
[49:31] that's got stubborn Spirits it's usually
[49:34] a complex that causes this either they
[49:37] have inherited from a mother father
[49:40] uncle aunt grandmother grandfather
[49:42] somebody like that and if you'll trace
[49:46] it back down through your life
[49:48] he said now I've taken this by
[49:50] experience under discernment because
[49:52] I've met cases on the platform
[49:54] thousands of those that had that spirit
[49:59] and the first thing you know I chase
[50:00] that Spirit right by the sermon and find
[50:02] out that there was a granddaddy or
[50:04] grandmother
[50:06] there was something else back down there
[50:08] and you inherit that by Nature he says
[50:12] now aren't you glad today that there's
[50:15] somebody else you can blame for how
[50:16] weird you are huh
[50:19] yes there's things and ways that you
[50:23] have and things you have to deal with
[50:24] you didn't have nothing to do with
[50:25] Saints it was something but back before
[50:28] you it's passed down and passed down and
[50:30] passed down so some of our weirdness and
[50:33] our own fault it's just yeah but we got
[50:35] to deal with it don't we
[50:37] is that right Saints
[50:39] and so we find also that sickness can be
[50:42] passed down and sickness that runs in
[50:44] families and and and and you find that
[50:46] some people deal with like maybe heart
[50:48] disease or cancer or different things
[50:50] that run in your family and and you know
[50:52] for example all of the Moors all the
[50:55] Moore's family dies of cancer I don't
[50:57] know if it's because of that it runs in
[50:58] our family or because they all smoke
[51:00] like freight trains or or what it is but
[51:02] but we all
[51:04] but these sicknesses can run in our
[51:06] family
[51:07] right and brother Brandt talks about
[51:08] complexes and he talks about his complex
[51:11] and he says
[51:13] let me talk to you about sickness he
[51:14] says because that sickness is an
[51:16] attribute of sin
[51:18] and he said before we had sin we had no
[51:20] sickness and sickness came because of
[51:23] sin and he said maybe not something
[51:25] you've done something that you inherited
[51:29] yeah it wasn't even your sin in some
[51:31] cases and then he goes on talking about
[51:34] a complex and he makes his confession of
[51:36] having a complex and he says that I pray
[51:38] that God will place into my heart that's
[51:40] something that I lost out there in that
[51:42] complex he was talking about you know he
[51:44] preached so hard and the people wouldn't
[51:46] receive it and all of those things and
[51:48] he said he had that complex and then he
[51:49] makes this statement brother Joel he
[51:51] said it's so easy to build a complex so
[51:55] not only do we have complexes that were
[51:57] passed down to us but then we can easily
[52:00] build our own complexes and then we
[52:02] become responsible for some of our own
[52:04] weirdness
[52:07] so you got you got complexes that's
[52:09] coming at you and you got complexes that
[52:11] you build
[52:13] amen right
[52:15] right so we pass these things down and
[52:17] we build new ones and and so I want to
[52:19] look at some of those this morning just
[52:21] so we're clear but brother Brennan talks
[52:23] about all kinds of different complexes
[52:25] and I want to touch a few of them today
[52:27] but if you look into the message it's
[52:28] extensive so it's apparently a big
[52:30] problem and we find that one of the
[52:32] complexes he talked about that was
[52:34] shocking to me was self-pity and he said
[52:37] self-pity is a complex
[52:42] he says a complex self-pity he's talking
[52:44] to a woman he says you're in a pitiful
[52:46] condition then that's really true when
[52:49] you get to pitying yourself and you want
[52:51] everyone to pity you and you pity
[52:54] yourself now Saints we all know somebody
[52:57] let's feel sorry for this self a lot
[53:00] when I said that y'all probably thought
[53:02] of somebody
[53:04] just make sure nobody's thinking about
[53:06] you when I say that
[53:07] you say self-pity well that doesn't seem
[53:09] like a big deal well I'll tell you
[53:11] Saints self-pity complex can stop you
[53:14] from receiving every blessing that God
[53:16] has for you
[53:17] you see self-pity wants attention and
[53:20] you find then that when people want
[53:22] attention what they begin to do is
[53:24] they're scared to receive their healing
[53:26] for example
[53:27] they don't want to receive their healing
[53:29] because they're scared if they get
[53:31] healed people will quit feeling sorry
[53:32] for them
[53:37] now if we'll be honest we've all come to
[53:40] the point in our life where we have just
[53:42] established that day that we don't feel
[53:43] good
[53:45] maybe we already called in sick to work
[53:47] Brother David
[53:49] and we don't want to be healed come on
[53:52] come on that's a complex
[53:54] now everybody likes somebody to feel
[53:56] sorry for them
[53:58] right everybody likes that a sensation
[54:00] everybody likes that feeling all right
[54:02] now your husband you know when you when
[54:03] you hurt you like your back sore your
[54:05] back's tired or something you go home
[54:06] you want Mama to feel sorry for you
[54:10] come on
[54:14] now the more house ain't the right place
[54:16] to go for that
[54:21] but it can stop it you say well I don't
[54:22] believe that brother George I don't
[54:24] believe that self-pity can stop my
[54:25] blessing well let me read it to you
[54:26] brother Brown says notice I want to Mark
[54:28] in your remembrance he said of course
[54:30] it's on tape here aren't you glad that
[54:33] it's on tapes that's worse you don't
[54:34] have to just take my word for it you can
[54:36] shake it for yourself I'm glad we got
[54:38] the taste today
[54:40] I'm glad we got some we can go back to
[54:42] in reference he said of course it's on
[54:44] tape here now the one thing that's the
[54:46] matter with the people that they don't
[54:47] get healed it's not because that he said
[54:49] look I've wondered here sets one Hill
[54:51] here sets another one notch Linger on
[54:54] and on and on here's another one here's
[54:56] another one and he said there's
[54:58] something wrong somewhere and I think
[55:00] it's this it's a complex that people
[55:03] build up especially people who's been
[55:06] sick a while he's sitting out now he
[55:08] said you'll resent this when I tell you
[55:11] but it's true now see that's why I like
[55:13] the message thanks sometimes it hurts
[55:15] and sometimes it cuts but it's always
[55:17] true see come on yeah he said you'll
[55:20] resent it when I tell you this he said
[55:23] but
[55:24] and he said this
[55:27] he said you'll resent it when I tell you
[55:28] but it's true he said you take a child
[55:30] that's been petted that child becomes to
[55:33] a place till it just wants to be petted
[55:35] it builds up a complex he said he said
[55:38] you can't do nothing with that child
[55:40] until you shake him right good he said
[55:43] now that's the same thing when a person
[55:44] gets sick they become self-pityed
[55:47] he says oh Mom in such a condition oh
[55:50] I've prayed for the people that say well
[55:52] I don't believe I I feel any better he
[55:53] said you'll never feel any better like
[55:56] that
[55:57] he said that's not it if that's the
[55:59] attitude don't even approach him at all
[56:01] because it's not right in his sight
[56:03] don't have a complex but come with a
[56:05] Burly robust Faith it's a subtle thing
[56:08] God said so that settles it right now he
[56:11] said
[56:13] so he said people listen get healed that
[56:15] and get that one won't this thing gets
[56:16] healed that one doesn't this one gets
[56:17] healed that one does he said a complex
[56:19] builds up where they get self-pity yes
[56:24] come on
[56:26] say sometimes we don't get better
[56:28] because we don't want to and then we
[56:30] claim everything for our own you know
[56:32] like we say well well I'll tell you
[56:34] brother I don't feel too good today my
[56:36] high blood pressure is acting up well
[56:37] it's not my high blood pressure
[56:40] it's the devil's high blood pressure I'm
[56:43] not taking that for myself I don't want
[56:45] you Boxing Around snakes oh my
[56:48] congestive heart pain my kidney problems
[56:50] no no it's not yours
[56:54] that's the devils
[56:57] and we're not taking that box of
[56:59] rattlesnakes
[57:01] hand it right back to him Saints
[57:04] amen
[57:05] brother Brown talks about the
[57:06] relationships that you're in and how the
[57:09] people that you associate with can cause
[57:11] a complex in you yes
[57:17] now he gives the example of the two twin
[57:19] girls he said they were Ube people he
[57:21] said they were real Christians and he
[57:24] said they really believed in God and he
[57:26] said they were Twins and they went to
[57:28] school and he said one twin was a little
[57:31] healthier than the other twin and they
[57:32] said when they go to school the people
[57:34] at school would make fun of them because
[57:36] they didn't go to dances and they didn't
[57:37] drink and it didn't smoke and it didn't
[57:39] do all kinds of evil things and he said
[57:41] to one twin she was so strong that when
[57:44] they tell her she'd say I don't care
[57:46] what they say I'm here to serve the Lord
[57:49] and she say they can go jump in a ditch
[57:53] I think it said River
[57:55] but we ain't really got rivers in Tucson
[58:01] River's got water in them but they call
[58:03] a river in Tucson's a ditch see River's
[58:05] got water in it yeah and so
[58:09] but he said they can go jump in the
[58:11] river I'm here to serve the Lord is that
[58:14] your testimony today I don't care what
[58:15] they do I don't care what they say I'm
[58:18] here to serve the Lord today
[58:22] and and the other one though he said it
[58:24] got to upset her the other twin girl
[58:26] that got to upset her it got to
[58:28] bothering her and they kept making fun
[58:29] of her and they got to bothering her and
[58:31] he said she finally ended up in the
[58:33] insane institution yeah
[58:35] he said she went insane they had her in
[58:38] the insane Institution for two years of
[58:40] course brother Rand went and prayed for
[58:41] him brought her out
[58:43] so it stands to reason saints that if if
[58:46] the people that we're around can develop
[58:49] complexes in us then we can develop
[58:52] complexes in others
[58:55] come on somebody
[58:57] yeah and I'll tell you Saints as a
[58:59] parent we have to be keenly aware not to
[59:02] develop complexes in our children yeah
[59:06] we got to be real careful or say in
[59:08] front of our kids because we impact the
[59:09] way they think and what they feel and
[59:11] what their opinions of other people
[59:13] right
[59:15] right oh y'all go ahead and get quiet
[59:18] but that's the true Saints
[59:20] that's the truth we got to watch what we
[59:22] say in front of our kids I'll give you
[59:25] the example brother Brown used of Elisha
[59:27] and his she-bears
[59:29] now the prophet of God said that that
[59:31] that they've seen Elijah go up and they
[59:34] didn't know if they believed it or not
[59:35] and their parents will sit at home
[59:37] making fun
[59:40] is that right thanks
[59:43] and he said he said instead of telling
[59:45] them not to say nothing about it he said
[59:47] they were sitting at home and they heard
[59:49] their Papa and Mama sitting at the table
[59:50] laughing one to another
[59:52] and saying no why don't you know said
[59:54] that old Holy Roller was taken up you
[59:56] ever seen anything like that and he said
[59:58] he he goes on talking about that and he
[1:00:00] said he they called it nonsense and they
[1:00:02] and they mocked it and they made fun of
[1:00:04] it and he says then they said because he
[1:00:06] won't come to our churches see
[1:00:10] the Elisha wouldn't come to their Church
[1:00:12] Elisha wouldn't fellowship with they
[1:00:13] made fun of it see
[1:00:15] and he said uh caught some kind of
[1:00:18] Witchcraft or some kind of hoodoo and he
[1:00:20] made fun of it he said if they'd been
[1:00:21] taught reverence and respect they'd have
[1:00:24] walked out there before that prophet of
[1:00:25] God and ask a prayer for themselves
[1:00:29] but he said instead they've been talked
[1:00:31] to Snicker and laughing to make fun
[1:00:33] about like the children of today he said
[1:00:36] he said so Elijah uh cursed them Elijah
[1:00:40] cursed them in the name of the Lord
[1:00:43] not because of the children listen to
[1:00:45] this but because of the irreverent
[1:00:48] parents that has brought the children up
[1:00:51] that way to disrespect God see they
[1:00:55] thought they were disrespecting the
[1:00:56] prophets but actually they were
[1:00:58] disrespecting God
[1:01:01] so you got to be careful what you say
[1:01:03] about God's prophets
[1:01:05] he said they thought they was
[1:01:07] disrespecting the prophet but they were
[1:01:08] actually disrespecting God
[1:01:12] and he said two sea bears come out and
[1:01:13] kill 42 of them he said God demands
[1:01:16] respect
[1:01:17] and when they disrespect His prophets
[1:01:20] they disrespect him no matter how much
[1:01:22] they didn't believe they ought to kept
[1:01:24] their mouth shut he said that's right
[1:01:27] what a lesson says and we need to keep
[1:01:30] our mouth shut sometime don't we and
[1:01:33] I'll go a step further I don't want to
[1:01:34] hear any disrespect to God's prophets
[1:01:36] and I don't want to hear any disrespect
[1:01:38] to God's servants either
[1:01:41] come on now amen because it's not the
[1:01:43] man it's the god in the man
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:48] see they thought they were disrespecting
[1:01:50] a man but they were actually
[1:01:51] disrespecting God
[1:01:54] amen he said Elisha didn't go to their
[1:01:57] Church you know we get the same kind of
[1:02:00] ideology in this message
[1:02:03] and if they don't go to our church and
[1:02:05] they don't fellowship with our group
[1:02:06] they're not there
[1:02:10] oh they got a fellowship here they got a
[1:02:12] fellowship there they were the best in
[1:02:14] the world at labeling people yeah
[1:02:17] oh they go over there I bet you they I
[1:02:19] bet you they're Thunders I bet they're
[1:02:21] peruse you I bet you we got all these
[1:02:23] different names for everybody
[1:02:25] he preached at that church I bet he
[1:02:26] believes this I bet he's returned I'll
[1:02:28] bet he's this and that yeah come
[1:02:31] well I'll tell you what since I'm not
[1:02:33] any of those things I'm a Believer today
[1:02:38] amen I'm not any of those things I just
[1:02:41] want to believe a message amen
[1:02:43] man I don't want no labels
[1:02:47] man that you know what there can be news
[1:02:50] flash
[1:02:52] there can be Christians that don't go to
[1:02:55] our church
[1:02:57] yes
[1:02:59] yes there are believers in other
[1:03:02] churches Brother David can you believe
[1:03:04] that Saints
[1:03:08] can you believe it today
[1:03:10] now we find the same thing in the Bible
[1:03:12] if you want to jot it down it's Mark the
[1:03:14] 9th chapter and and in my bowel in my
[1:03:17] Bible it says it's titled an intolerance
[1:03:20] rebute and it was John talking to Jesus
[1:03:23] and he said Master we saw one casting
[1:03:26] out devils in thy name
[1:03:29] and he followed not us
[1:03:32] and we forbade him
[1:03:40] yeah so they run across a guy
[1:03:42] casting out Devils Saints
[1:03:47] now that's a pretty good thing to do
[1:03:48] isn't it
[1:03:50] this man was casting out devils in the
[1:03:53] name of Jesus and Saints we can all use
[1:03:56] some more people running around casting
[1:03:58] out devils
[1:04:00] and he was casting out devils and John
[1:04:03] said but he didn't go to our church
[1:04:07] so he said stop doing that you don't go
[1:04:10] to our church
[1:04:13] is that right or wrong Saints
[1:04:17] Mark the 9th chapter 38th verse if you
[1:04:19] want to look at it he said but Jesus
[1:04:21] said forbid him not yeah for there is no
[1:04:25] man which shall do a miracle in my name
[1:04:28] that can lightly speak evil of me
[1:04:31] well he that is not against us is on our
[1:04:34] part yes
[1:04:40] yeah amen if they ain't bothering us
[1:04:42] leave them alone
[1:04:45] if they're doing the work for the Lord
[1:04:46] leave them alone
[1:04:50] they don't go to our church leave them
[1:04:53] alone
[1:04:54] if they're not against us
[1:04:56] they're for us
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:04] so we passed a lot of judgment don't we
[1:05:06] say
[1:05:07] you know we impact the way other
[1:05:09] believers feel about other believers we
[1:05:13] impact I think we'll all say we're
[1:05:15] guilty of having an opinion or an idea
[1:05:17] about somebody that we don't even know
[1:05:20] based on something we've heard somebody
[1:05:22] else say
[1:05:24] come on we feel like this church
[1:05:26] believes that or this church believes
[1:05:28] that or that brother there he goes over
[1:05:30] there

[1:10:15] people afraid
[1:10:17] some people are afraid to hear a
[1:10:19] preacher
[1:10:22] preaching the gospel is the will of the
[1:10:24] Lord Saints yes
[1:10:27] people get a fair complex on them and
[1:10:29] it'll even stop them from receiving the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost yes
[1:10:33] yes they won't they although they'll be
[1:10:34] scared to get the Holy Ghost because
[1:10:36] they're afraid oh they don't look
[1:10:38] fanatical yeah yeah they're afraid to
[1:10:40] praise the Lord because they don't want
[1:10:41] to look fanatical they get they get
[1:10:43] scared you shout too loud and they don't
[1:10:45] want to be fanatical
[1:10:47] preach amen say so I know what I'm
[1:10:50] shouting about yeah I know what I'm
[1:10:52] happy about I know what God did for me

[1:10:58] delusional today I'm I'm happy today
[1:11:01] man I'm not trying to work nothing up
[1:11:03] but I'll tell you when I think about
[1:11:04] what God did for me it makes me happy
[1:11:09] when I think about the goodness of God
[1:11:11] it creates an emotion in me
[1:11:18] right or wrong Saints
[1:11:21] creates an emotion
[1:11:24] so how do you know what the will of the
[1:11:25] Lord is well brother Brown said his will
[1:11:28] is his word that's right
[1:11:31] so if you went over to the will of the
[1:11:32] Lord or not is it in the word because
[1:11:34] it's in the word it's his will
[1:11:39] yes we don't have to over complicate it
[1:11:42] that's right yeah
[1:11:45] now brother Brown said now she's a true
[1:11:46] bride was so sold out to him that she
[1:11:48] uses no mind of her own his mind of
[1:11:51] course is his will and his will is his
[1:11:54] word Brothers
[1:11:56] so another complex that stops us from
[1:11:59] getting anywhere with God is the complex
[1:12:02] of pride
[1:12:05] yes
[1:12:06] Pride
[1:12:08] he said there's another little door
[1:12:10] called Pride
[1:12:12] he says oh
[1:12:14] what a horrible little black devil is
[1:12:17] all pinned up in the heart of pride
[1:12:21] yeah now like brother Joel said you just
[1:12:22] don't feed that devil
[1:12:27] y'all gonna get that in a minute
[1:12:31] come on it's just thinking
[1:12:33] you're better
[1:12:35] than somebody else
[1:12:38] how in the world says can we ever feel
[1:12:41] like we're better against somebody else
[1:12:43] says there ain't one thing we did
[1:12:51] since there's not one thing that we did
[1:12:54] to be here today
[1:12:56] right that's not one thing we had to do
[1:12:58] with it there's not one thing you can do
[1:13:00] to see this message there's not one
[1:13:02] thing you can do to believe it it's
[1:13:04] ordered of the Lord God did that for you
[1:13:09] if you see this today you're blessed
[1:13:13] you're not better than somebody you
[1:13:15] didn't do nothing you didn't work your
[1:13:17] way into it God just blessed you with it
[1:13:19] he gave it to you
[1:13:22] God gave it to us Saints we didn't do
[1:13:25] anything to deserve it I wasn't looking
[1:13:27] for God he came looking for me yeah
[1:13:31] how could we ever feel better than
[1:13:33] someone I don't ever want to get to
[1:13:34] myself to a place to where I'm so good
[1:13:36] so high so mighty that I can't talk to a
[1:13:39] sinner yeah
[1:13:41] I don't get so religious
[1:13:43] that I can't be associated with somebody
[1:13:45] now why would anybody want to be around
[1:13:48] somebody like this
[1:13:51] how would we ever win somebody to the
[1:13:53] Lord
[1:13:55] how do we ever witness to somebody and
[1:13:58] treating them like we're better than
[1:13:59] them
[1:14:01] it's not one thing we did Saints not one
[1:14:05] thing we did come on
[1:14:08] oh God
[1:14:11] he did it all Jesus Paid It all all to
[1:14:15] him I owe
[1:14:18] yes
[1:14:20] he did it
[1:14:25] yeah thank you Lord
[1:14:28] says well I I wouldn't send my children
[1:14:30] over there they don't dress right the
[1:14:31] people that goes there isn't my class
[1:14:37] he says if Christ is Lord in your heart
[1:14:42] you're all one class
[1:14:44] because of one spirit
[1:14:46] we're all baptized into one body
[1:14:50] Pride feels just a little complex that
[1:14:52] we have and he says you don't want Jesus
[1:14:56] to touch that because it would degrade
[1:15:00] your social standing in the community
[1:15:04] there's a striking here Saints he said
[1:15:06] I'd rather degrade my social standing in
[1:15:08] the community than to rub my name off of
[1:15:11] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:13] old man
[1:15:16] yeah you know people can get so proud
[1:15:19] yeah
[1:15:20] that they're almost ashamed to mention
[1:15:22] this message yeah
[1:15:24] they're almost as scared you know people
[1:15:27] say well where do you go to church at
[1:15:28] well

[1:15:40] I'm not ashamed of this message
[1:15:44] I'm not ashamed of what God did for me
[1:15:47] thank you Lord people get so proud
[1:15:49] they're too proud to yield to the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost yes
[1:15:53] yes they get so proud that if the spirit
[1:15:55] of God can be moving and they won't
[1:15:57] yield to it because it scares somebody
[1:15:59] might look at them
[1:16:01] yeah they're scared to pry themselves up
[1:16:03] out of the chair one time yeah scare
[1:16:05] somebody to think something about them
[1:16:07] saints if you're here to Worship the
[1:16:09] Lord that's your focus don't worry about
[1:16:11] what anybody else thinks don't worry
[1:16:12] about what everybody else says
[1:16:15] make yo jump in the river I'm here to
[1:16:18] serve the Lord
[1:16:20] I'm here to Worship the Lord I don't
[1:16:23] care if they like it or not David said
[1:16:24] I'll tell you what you hide and watch
[1:16:27] come on yeah come on back tomorrow if
[1:16:30] you want to see some more of it yeah
[1:16:32] yeah
[1:16:33] we're not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ I'm not ashamed to worship the
[1:16:37] god the in a way that's called heresy
[1:16:40] that's the way I worship the god of my
[1:16:42] father
[1:16:45] amen we get so prideful
[1:16:47] we're scared to yield to The Holy
[1:16:49] Spirits we become starchy brother Brown
[1:16:52] says you cannot come starchy
[1:16:58] you can't come start you think about it
[1:17:01] says if you're blessed to hunger and
[1:17:03] thirst after righteousness
[1:17:05] to hunger and thirst that's a
[1:17:07] righteousness you're blessed just to
[1:17:09] have that desire now think about
[1:17:12] if you'd been about four or five days
[1:17:14] without anything to eat yeah
[1:17:20] and and you looked up here and I had a
[1:17:23] big fine steak
[1:17:24] and a nice glass of water for you up
[1:17:27] here don't tell me you're going to come
[1:17:30] dignified after four days and not eating
[1:17:36] right you
[1:17:38] desperation will strike
[1:17:40] after four days of not eaten desperation
[1:17:44] strikes and you forget
[1:17:47] everything else going on
[1:17:49] and your sole focus is on getting
[1:17:52] something to eat
[1:17:54] yes it's all you can think about
[1:17:56] that's the way we got to get with God
[1:17:58] yeah
[1:18:01] yeah but instead we get to be at kind of
[1:18:03] half-mast Christians yes you know
[1:18:05] half-mast where you can get to about
[1:18:08] right here
[1:18:10] or so yeah
[1:18:14] come on

[1:18:23] over anything else in the world
[1:18:25] I'll take a holy ghost service over in
[1:18:29] it if you offered me a trip to
[1:18:31] Disneyland or a holy ghost service I'll
[1:18:34] take a holy ghost service a hundred
[1:18:36] times out of a hundred
[1:18:39] I don't just want to live a message live
[1:18:42] on Sunday it is my life Saints I ain't
[1:18:45] got no other Hobbies all right
[1:18:48] this is my life
[1:18:51] this is what I live for
[1:18:54] I don't also come to church the church
[1:18:57] is my life
[1:19:00] that's good yes
[1:19:02] and I'll take this over anything else
[1:19:05] because this is eternal life
[1:19:10] this is better than vacation this is
[1:19:13] this is better than entertainments this
[1:19:15] is eternal life
[1:19:19] I love it I love to be in the atmosphere
[1:19:22] I love to be in the house of God I love
[1:19:24] to come and fellowship I love it
[1:19:28] do you love it this morning
[1:19:31] and we got people so proud they're so
[1:19:34] proud there's two proud to even humble
[1:19:36] themselves to sit under a Ministry yeah
[1:19:39] yeah that's true
[1:19:41] yeah I'll tell you since if you're a
[1:19:43] believer in this message
[1:19:45] and you say you're a Believer and you
[1:19:47] don't go to church
[1:19:49] and you don't have a pastor I would
[1:19:52] question your experience
[1:20:00] and now today
[1:20:02] we've gotten into the habit I guess
[1:20:04] maybe with the Advent of the streaming
[1:20:05] and so forth to where many Believers are
[1:20:08] claiming somebody else as their pastor
[1:20:15] I'm on preach say it's your pastor he
[1:20:18] don't live 12 hours away
[1:20:22] he don't live on the other side of the
[1:20:24] country he he don't let your pastor goes
[1:20:27] to church with you
[1:20:31] am I off base here Brother David am I
[1:20:34] looking at something wrong I can't my I
[1:20:36] can't claim my pastor my pastor needs to
[1:20:39] know who I am
[1:20:41] okay all right
[1:20:44] brother so and so that I've never met
[1:20:46] can't be my pastor
[1:20:52] amen I can stream his Services every
[1:20:55] Sunday I can listen to him preach that
[1:20:57] don't make him my pastor
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:02] our question does he even know your name
[1:21:04] does he know who you are and you say
[1:21:06] well well no brother George I don't have
[1:21:08] that Pastor like well brother Branham is
[1:21:10] my pastor and I hear that in a lot
[1:21:12] brother Branham is my pastor well okay
[1:21:14] I'll go with you on that because Elijah
[1:21:16] was Jezebel's Pastor is that right we
[1:21:18] know that all right well let's look at
[1:21:20] what your pastor says then yeah come oh
[1:21:23] yeah
[1:21:24] let's just look at what your pastor said
[1:21:27] man his arm and spirit he says a new
[1:21:29] testament Prophet is a preacher he said
[1:21:32] we all know that just any Minister
[1:21:34] that's a preacher is a prophet now look
[1:21:36] that's true
[1:21:38] but that ain't the same kind of prophet
[1:21:40] like brother Brown
[1:21:45] a new testament Prophet if he's
[1:21:47] prophesying preaching not to try to
[1:21:49] edify himself or make a big name or to
[1:21:51] edify his organization which he should
[1:21:54] be in an organization
[1:22:00] now
[1:22:02] now context is critically important
[1:22:05] so don't leave out of here and say what
[1:22:07] brother Branch said join an organization
[1:22:11] he says here I am without one but yet
[1:22:13] preaching you should be that's right
[1:22:15] every man
[1:22:17] ought to have a church home yeah
[1:22:23] you
[1:22:23] ought to have a place not just to float
[1:22:26] about from Pillar To Post
[1:22:29] but have somewhere that you go to church
[1:22:32] and you call it your church
[1:22:36] somewhere where you pay your tithes and
[1:22:40] somewhere you help support the cause
[1:22:44] take your choice
[1:22:46] but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:22:49] other man because he don't belong to
[1:22:52] your group
[1:22:53] see discern his spirit and see if he's
[1:22:56] got the same purpose in his heart
[1:23:00] then you got fellowship with one another
[1:23:03] yes
[1:23:04] yeah you're working for one great cause
[1:23:08] that's the cause of Christ yes
[1:23:14] so so the Pastor said
[1:23:17] find your church
[1:23:19] go to it
[1:23:20] support
[1:23:22] yeah yes
[1:23:26] but see people don't want nobody tell
[1:23:27] them what to do
[1:23:29] that's right they don't want to listen
[1:23:30] to nobody
[1:23:31] come on they don't want nobody holding
[1:23:33] them accountable yeah
[1:23:36] yeah they won't do what they want to do
[1:23:37] yeah yeah they don't want to answer to
[1:23:39] nobody yeah yeah so so it's Pride Saints
[1:23:41] it's Pride that keeps people from doing
[1:23:44] that people people can get to where they
[1:23:46] don't want anybody to tell them what to
[1:23:47] do since if you go to a church very long
[1:23:49] and you've been going there for a while
[1:23:51] and you've never been condemned you're
[1:23:53] going to the wrong Church
[1:23:54] come on free
[1:23:56] that's TV preaching that's what that is
[1:23:58] come on I go to the house the Lord to be
[1:24:01] corrected since I you know what it don't
[1:24:04] feel good at the time I don't always
[1:24:06] like it but I like the results of it
[1:24:11] yes
[1:24:13] I need it Saints I I need to be
[1:24:16] corrected
[1:24:17] amen I like the results of it because my
[1:24:20] desire is I want to be a better
[1:24:22] Christian today than I was yesterday
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:28] people get kind of territorial in
[1:24:30] churches sometimes though and they get
[1:24:32] to where they got you know they got
[1:24:33] their own territory that they kind of
[1:24:35] Patrol and and you know one sister she
[1:24:37] got the she got the cake decorating
[1:24:39] Ministry
[1:24:43] and any cake that gets decorated in this
[1:24:46] church
[1:24:47] I'm the one that does it
[1:24:55] don't know
[1:24:57] come on don't nobody ever fight over the
[1:24:59] church vacuuming Ministry
[1:25:08] we'll get proud yeah well you're proud
[1:25:11] you know what Saints you can't have
[1:25:14] enough gifts in the church
[1:25:15] that's right you can't have enough
[1:25:17] musicians you can't have enough good
[1:25:20] preachers you can't have enough good
[1:25:22] Sunday school teachers you can't have
[1:25:24] enough good people say
[1:25:27] yeah come on
[1:25:30] if God's blessing the church say Amen
[1:25:33] thank the Lord nobody can take your
[1:25:35] place nobody can do what you do there's
[1:25:38] no amen like you're amen amen there's no
[1:25:41] handshake like your handshake there's no
[1:25:44] hug like your heart
[1:25:48] nobody can take your place nobody can do
[1:25:51] what you do we don't have to be proud we
[1:25:53] don't have to be
[1:25:54] come on preach
[1:26:00] how many of you a little lower this
[1:26:01] morning
[1:26:02] amen Amen brother Brown said in that
[1:26:04] stubbornness complex I'm gonna finish
[1:26:06] that quote here just as we uh as we
[1:26:09] finish up
[1:26:10] he says
[1:26:12] stubbornness is not of God
[1:26:16] he said and now the only way to get away
[1:26:18] from that is you have to have faith to
[1:26:21] overcome that you're a Christian you're
[1:26:24] a son and daughter of God
[1:26:26] which whatever you may be and you'll
[1:26:28] never be able to just stand and rebuke
[1:26:31] it and rebuke it and rebuke it it's like
[1:26:33] tantalizing a rattlesnake he said he
[1:26:36] says it's laying there ready to bite you
[1:26:39] right he says if you'll just ignore him
[1:26:41] and walk away from him he can't hurt you
[1:26:45] see
[1:26:46] so when you feel that you got a stubborn
[1:26:48] Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and
[1:26:50] believe that God that the thing is dead
[1:26:52] and you'll never have it no more and go
[1:26:54] on and don't even pay any attention to
[1:26:55] it no more and the thing will leave you
[1:26:57] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:27:01] you
[1:27:02] yes so there's a lot of complexes we
[1:27:05] deal with there's a lot of them that's
[1:27:07] been passed down to us right there's a
[1:27:09] lot of them that we develop ourselves
[1:27:10] and they're working in our lives and
[1:27:12] we're dealing with them so they said you
[1:27:14] know in in marriages you deal with them
[1:27:16] the husband can't understand what the
[1:27:18] wife's talking about because it's not
[1:27:20] his complex the wife can't understand
[1:27:22] what the husband's talking about because
[1:27:24] it's not her complex it's it's
[1:27:26] individual complexes you find you deal
[1:27:28] with it in churches brother Randolph
[1:27:30] said we gotta get over one another's
[1:27:32] peculiarities
[1:27:36] and we have to deal with these things we
[1:27:39] have we and we do deal with them saints
[1:27:41] but we don't have to be subject to them
[1:27:45] yeah
[1:27:47] yeah that's right Brothers said they get
[1:27:49] complexes he says you don't get no
[1:27:50] complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you
[1:27:54] get love yeah
[1:27:56] see we don't have to accept these
[1:27:58] complexes we might have dealt with them
[1:28:00] we might have been passed down some we
[1:28:02] might have developed our own but we
[1:28:04] don't have to accept them yeah
[1:28:09] now the Bible says it and I'm I'm gonna
[1:28:12] you can turn them if you want to Genesis
[1:28:14] the 12th chapter now heirs according to
[1:28:17] the promise everybody says you're
[1:28:18] Abraham's seed and your heirs according
[1:28:20] to the promise yes
[1:28:22] yes your heirs according problems we
[1:28:23] talk about that all the time but do we
[1:28:25] ever really look at some of the promises
[1:28:28] that Abraham was given now in Genesis
[1:28:30] the 12th chapter uh the first verse the
[1:28:33] Lord said to Abram he said get thee out
[1:28:35] of thy country and from thy Kindred and
[1:28:38] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[1:28:40] will I will show thee so the very first
[1:28:42] promise that God made to Abraham was the
[1:28:46] promise of the promised land yes
[1:28:51] now to you and I that's the
[1:28:55] Holy Ghost
[1:28:57] come on somebody yeah y'all got to know
[1:29:00] that
[1:29:01] our promised land today is the Holy
[1:29:05] Ghost
[1:29:08] is that right thanks is that message
[1:29:10] teaching right there
[1:29:12] our promised land is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:14] Saints the Holy Ghost is a promise to
[1:29:18] you
[1:29:21] your heirs according to the promise yes
[1:29:24] and I will make of thee a great nation
[1:29:27] and I will bless thee and make thy name
[1:29:29] great and thou shalt be a blessing so
[1:29:32] the second promise that God made Abraham
[1:29:35] the first thing he promised was the
[1:29:36] promised land the second thing was a
[1:29:39] Godly heritage
[1:29:42] he promised not somebody else's loins
[1:29:45] out of you I will make a great nation
[1:29:49] now to you and I that's the token
[1:29:55] God has promised you your family
[1:30:00] come on somebody yeah God has promised
[1:30:03] your family
[1:30:04] God has promised the Holy Ghost yes God
[1:30:07] has promised your family yes
[1:30:10] yes third verse and I will bless them
[1:30:12] that bless thee and curse them that
[1:30:13] curse thee and in thee shall all the
[1:30:16] families of the earth be blessed so the
[1:30:20] third promise God made Abraham he
[1:30:22] promised him the Holy Ghost he promised
[1:30:24] the token the third promise was he
[1:30:26] promised blessing upon his life
[1:30:29] he promised that he would fight his
[1:30:31] battles for him
[1:30:36] and blessed I Will Bless thee yes yes
[1:30:39] and I will curse
[1:30:41] those that curse thee yes yes see
[1:30:45] we need to let go and get out of God's
[1:30:47] way sometimes yes and let God handle it
[1:30:50] amen he promised he would handle it he
[1:30:53] promised he would do it for us
[1:30:57] y'all believe that today
[1:31:00] and in my heavenly lineage brothers and
[1:31:03] sisters there were all kinds of
[1:31:05] blessings passed down not in my natural
[1:31:08] image but in my heavenly

[1:31:54] and my heavenly lineage
[1:31:57] supersedes my natural language
[1:32:00] amen that's good now let me reach this
[1:32:02] quote he said when Jesus atoned for sin
[1:32:06] he killed sin
[1:32:08] and every one of its attributes
[1:32:14] now there's another quote where brother
[1:32:16] Brown said if you're fighting a dragon
[1:32:19] or a large reptile he said he said and
[1:32:22] you're fighting him and he said he's got
[1:32:24] his claw in your side digging at your
[1:32:27] side you got two choices you can attack
[1:32:31] the claw
[1:32:32] yeah yeah or you can knock it in the
[1:32:35] head and it'll take care of the claw
[1:32:38] yeah
[1:32:42] see Jesus knocked it in the head
[1:32:46] now we're busy treating symptoms yeah
[1:32:50] we're busy treating oh I got this going
[1:32:52] on I got that going on Jesus knocked it
[1:32:55] in the head he said he killed sin and
[1:32:58] every one of its attributes he killed
[1:33:00] the serpent from his head
[1:33:04] now this is a quote that struck me he
[1:33:06] says then if he atoned for sin he atoned
[1:33:10] for sickness it could because sickness
[1:33:12] is secondarily an attribute of sin
[1:33:16] our worry our troubles our fears and all
[1:33:23] those things are attributes from sin
[1:33:28] so not only did he atone for our
[1:33:31] complexes not only did he turn for our
[1:33:34] sin not only did he turn for our
[1:33:36] sickness but it's all for our worry it's
[1:33:40] on for fear he had told for our
[1:33:42] stubbornness yeah
[1:33:46] thank you Lord good preaching
[1:33:49] any atone for those complexes too yeah
[1:33:53] now the devil likes to tell you this
[1:33:55] let's say you come from a family like
[1:33:57] mine

[1:34:07] something and maybe his father had some
[1:34:09] kind of mental issue or nervousness or

[1:36:42] of sin we had sickness not because maybe
[1:36:45] you sinned but something that come down
[1:36:47] through the generations he visited even
