your presence here this morning lord your overwhelming love amazes us today the fact that you shed your blood there on calvary for us it just it just thrills us today to know that you came not just

being with us lord not just for coming 2000 years ago but for being with us in this hour lord in this time when we face so many trials and tribulations of life not only the regular things of life but

mighty way speak directly to your people we pray in jesus name amen amen do you love the lord today it's good to be in the house of the lord on a sunday morning and worship the lord turn with me to acts chapter 2 verses 1 through 4. i want to greet my family that's here today some family members that i've been in church with for a while my aunt brenda is back there and she was back there there she is waving her hand back there god bless you this one good to have you guys and hadassah my cousin is with her and and my aunt janet is here as well god bless you back there and we're glad to have them i haven't been in church with them i don't think in probably years and but i remember having church together out back behind the house years and years ago with my grandfather who was a minister there and and we're glad to have him and uh the devil has attacked aunt brenda's health and uh but we believe the lord is a healer and and so we're going to trust that's mom's sister in case you didn't know and they all look alike so they can all cook kind of runs in the family and we won't say who the best cook is but we'll just kind of leave it now it's not you um uh we'll kind of leave that where it's at and uh but we're glad to have it's good to have family it's good to be part of the family of god isn't it every one of you good to have each and every one of you here this morning amen acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost all that you would give us a refilling this morning began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning to have the rest of my family here as well my sisters and their husbands enjoyed that guitar playing this morning i always love to hear that you know an atmosphere is a surrounding influence or environment when a bird lays an egg the egg has to be kept in a certain atmosphere to hatch so if the egg was laid say a chicken would lay an egg the egg would never hatch in the environment that it's in when it is born into the world it comes into the world but it actually has to uh have the environment created by its mother and god equipped the mother with a special set of feathers and the ability and and the know-how the instinct to hover down or brood over the chicken to actually make it hatch out of the egg and the bible talks about that in deuteronomy chapter 32 and verse 11 it says as an eagle stireth up her nest uttereth over her young and that word means to brood or or to move over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so god jehovah god says i'm like that mother eagle to you i i care for you i'm brooding over you i'm creating an atmosphere over you so that you can you can be born you can make it into the new land that's flowing with milk and honey and in a in a spiritual way today our god still says the same thing he says i'm brooding over you today i'm i'm working in your life i'm creating an atmosphere something that you could you could actually begin to bear fruit and bring forth what god would have in your life and so we find that it means to hover or to brood and the same word is used in genesis 1 in genesis 1 2 where it says the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved that word moved is to brood over the face of the waters to brood over the face of the waters the creator if you can imagine the chaos that was then and how that it was such a a condition of darkness and a condition of chaos and the spirit of god came on that chaos and began to brood over it begin to the random put it this way he said it was making love to it it was it was cooing to it it's brooding over it and he said it began to begin to bring an atmosphere over the earth that would not it would not have come to the place where it is now where it's habitable for life where there's where there's people on it where there's trees on it where there are all the seeds that were there in that in that world that was it would not become what it what it was in the garden of eden unless the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters to make it what it was let me tell you this you'll never be a christian the way god wants you to be without being in an atmosphere of faith you've got to have an atmosphere around you that is an atmosphere that will cause you to believe and not doubt the word of god and the atmosphere of the world won't do that because the atmosphere of the world is there to try to get you to disbelief it's there to try to make you worry it's there to try to say god's not real it's there to try to make it where you can't feel god you can't know god to try to make you doubt the word of god try to make you doubt everything about what you've been taught about the word but god if you can if you can go get away from that and come into the atmosphere of the word that's what we're doing here this morning and the word tells you you are a christian you are a child of god you you're a son or daughter of god you're the bride of jesus christ you were born to win you're born to you were created to do something in this world and so he creates it creates an atmosphere that then you can begin to birth things out of your life you can begin to become what god wants you to be he don't want you to be frowning all the time he don't want you to be unhappy he don't want you to be sad he don't want you to live your life in depression he don't want you to live your life in some kind of a worry but he wants you to be happy he wants you to live free he wants you to be able to rejoice he wants you to be able to worship him that's his whole purpose in creating you is to worship him right amen and god put a thirst within us for that yes he put a desire within us just to worship him something inside of us just to just to call out to him and we fill that void with with other things with alcohol or cigarettes or or the world things of the world that's a void there's something there it's not that the desire is wrong see the problem is not that the desire is too strong but the desire is too weak it's satisfied with things of the world but if the desire could ever get strong enough that we could say that don't satisfy me anymore i've tried those things that don't work no more i want to desire something inside of me that'll cr that wants god that won't settle for anything less than god hey man is that why you're here this morning i trust that it is because there's some things only god can do in that atmosphere of chaos when the world was all the elements just all over the place without form and void only god could turn that atmosphere of chaos into the world that we have yes even today that's beautiful and even though scarred by sin yet we see the world in in order in the natural world and you look at that say what could do that only god could do that are you with me this morning only god could do that then what could take an atmosphere of chaos in your life an atmosphere of chaos in your family what could take and bring order to that what could possibly bring an order to where a family is at peace with one another where a church is at peace with one another where people can receive from god where they can believe god what can bring that order it takes an atmosphere of the holy spirit brooding over the people it takes the word being preached and then the atmosphere producing what the word says so now we find the spirit of god moving on the face of the waters the creator making an atmosphere for life brooding over the seeds that were planted god's planted seeds in your life there's a word there that's been put in your life over the years that's been placed in there and he wants that seed of healing to come up he wants that seed of joy to come up he wants that that expression in your life but he's got in order to do that you got to let him brood over you you've got to be in an atmosphere that will be conducive to that now a bird again may lay a lot of eggs but if she doesn't brood over them they'll never come to life so she creates an atmosphere for the egg to be born you say well how will there be an atmosphere around me well you are a creator do you know that you're a creator look at genesis 1 27 it says so god created man in his own image yes in his own image what is god the creator right he's the creator of heaven and earth so god created man in his own image what was the difference in the man and all the other animals and the birds and everything else only god could create are you with me now satan was an angel you remember when he fell from heaven satan couldn't create right satan can only pervert yes right as cancer is is a cell that's been perverted by satan right and whatever sickness in your body it's something that's been perverted by satan the world that we live in is it's always the right thing that god made perverted in some in some way that's not according to the word of god and so satan is a perverter a deformer but god is a creator so if god is create a creator and he created you in his own image what does that make you the brown says let me tell you something each man that's born again with the spirit of god in him is a miniature creator he said now that might shake you a little but that's the truth he said we're in the image of god god is a creator he said that's the reason that you can believe that god could heal a person because god is in you and god made this world he just spoken and his word became material the very ground that you're setting on i love this it's not just church but the ground that we're sitting on how can we deny the existence of god how can we rebel against god the ground that we're sitting on the dirt underneath the concrete and the chairs and everything that you're sitting on the dirt underneath you what's holding you up is the very word of god made manifest he said let there be and there was yes right so we don't rebel against his word whatever his word says is right because what we're setting on is the word of god made manifest he just spoke it it turned it into existence he believed in his own word oh my he said if a man born of the spirit of god he's an offspring of god and that part of god is in him and he believes every word that god says will materialize and so that makes him part of god the holy spirit and the man makes him a part of god he said now so now he's going to begin to deal with how we are a creator specifically of atmosphere he said did you ever see people nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them oh we're going we won't point anybody out today he said sure you have you don't have nothing against them but you can't stand to be around them he said then you've seen some person maybe a little old scrawny fellow a little old woman been over a wash tub but you just love to be around that person you just love them somehow it's the atmosphere that they've got around them yes the way they live they create an atmosphere that you like to be into he said that's lovely people to be with now brother branham when he tells us then he begins to tell a story and i won't read you the story but i'll tell you parts of it and you can go back and find it he tells the story about some chaos that was in his home and many times that happens in a minister's home i know a little bit about that because sometimes they're just calls that you have to take there's times you got to go out and eat there's times that you got my wife and i some many times on our anniversary we've had to move things around and and to accommodate things going on in the ministry you just you have to do it and just in everyday life but i can't relate really to that kind of ministry that he had where he had that the people coming in all the time wanting to pray for pray for him you know as a pastor you want people to want to to be prayed for because you believe that's the word of god and people can get help not because you can help them because the word says that you want people to want to be prayed for but brother branham people believed in his ministry and they believed in what god did so they came to be prayed for from everywhere even a possum came to be prayed for one time and it was healed and so people would come to the house and they would wander through the house they knock on the door and people don't realize sometimes they're desperate for healing they want to be healed and so they would come in the house and they'd come in the kitchen and they'd come in the in the dining room in the living room and brother branham would have to leave the house to escape them but guess what his wife was still there and she had to deal with it just constant phone calls just just around around the clock just constant and so he's dealing with that chaos in his home and whenever that happens in a home it creates an environment or an atmosphere of chaos and so he found that his wife was standing trying to do the dishes she was crying the kids were fighting with each other because it seems like that always happens if the devil can't get to you he'll try to get to your wife or to your children or to somebody around you because he wants to upset the atmosphere and that's why sometimes it i've seen it many times especially with mothers that children the devil worked through not that the children are devils but the devil worked through the children to try to make an atmosphere that's so upset that you can't ever think about god you don't even have time to go to church you don't have time because you're always caring for the children sometimes even if they're adults but listen that's the devil trying to get in that place you've got to be a creator and create an atmosphere that'll change them right right and so now here that was the situation that he was in now uh he he caused the atmosphere to be different now he said now my wife's sitting there and she was crying so i said now the only thing for me to do now heavenly father in my heart he was saying this i said is to create a different situation here i wonder if we could believe that we could do that that wasn't limited to brother branham but branham just came to show us that it could be done yes right right every one of us are creators yes we were created in the image of god so we are miniature creators we have the ability to create an atmosphere for for the people of god and for the people around us for our families that we could be at peace and in that peaceful atmosphere then god can begin to work it becomes an atmosphere of faith so he come and how did he do it and you all know the story many of you do he come and he put his arm around his wife you come up behind her like you will many times when she's doing the dishes because i just really appreciate it when my wife does the dishes i don't know about you but that means i don't have to do them right so many times i'll come up behind her i'll put my arm around her now that's touch you can create an atmosphere by touch you remember how hard it was during coven when we couldn't shake hands with one another it seemed nobody wanted to shake hands nobody wanted to get within six feet of each other how difficult that was why because there's no atmosphere because we're creating even when brother allen had you get up and shake hands with one another that you're creating an atmosphere by just by touching one another's hand you're creating an atmosphere of fellowship right right touch does that we're human beings we're we're touched by touch if you could say it that way and so touch does that he put his arm around her and so he began to he began to come and he and by example that he famously took an apron and put it on yeah right and we don't go too far down this this road but he put on an apron and he worked there with her and washed the dishes yeah and we think about that story and it shows what was he doing though he was creating an atmosphere by what by his touch and by the things he touched and by his example and then by words yes he began to speak positive things and if you go back to the different times that he tells the story he'll tell it and he'll say what he was saying to his wife and he began to tell her how the healings had taken place that day and and began to give testimony to the things god had done and then he began to tell her about a dress that he'd seen or something that he'd seen and how they were going to go out to eat and they were going to take a ride later what was he doing by using positive words instead of coming in and saying woman you better straighten up you've got to believe i'm a man of god but he didn't do that he come in and created an atmosphere so that she could calm down so that they could actually have peace so god could work so he come in and and he began to speak those things and he began to tell her now we're going to take a vacation and the kids can go catch some trout and won't that be a good time and she said oh yes it will after a while she began to smile and she began to she began to respond positively because he was speaking positive things whenever you go into a negative situation and you go in and begin to speak negative words in a negative situation you just double the negativity all you're doing is poisoning an already poisoned atmosphere right right and that's why you can't you got to balance the word and we don't preach just a a gospel that's easy believism and just one that you come and be as you are but no we believe in a god who changes things we believe in a god who makes things different and yet you can't get all the way over on the negative side where you preach at sin all the time because we but we don't believe we believe god can save you from sin but you've got to keep it balanced because if you don't you create a poisonous atmosphere in the church that people just come under condemnation and sit there all of the time and eventually they they leave under that condemnation because people don't like to be a human being wasn't made to be in an atmosphere like that but you are you need to know that you're a sinner you need to feel conviction for that there's times when you need to hear the word of god skin you alive and take everything off of you god washes us by the water of the word but you also need to know that there's hope for you that there's light at the end of the tunnel that there's strength that god can give you to overcome no matter how deep you've gone no matter how black it is that you can see god and know god for yourself yes all right so now he he did that he began to speak positive words you know sometimes doing a work for god can be overwhelming yes and i'm speaking now to those of you who have an office in the church of some kind be careful with your family because sometimes doing a work for god whether it's a deacon or a trustee or or a song leader or a pastor or a minister it can be overwhelming to your family it can create a chaos in the home because of the obligations that you have so we have to be careful of that and make sure that we're being a creator at home with our words god help me to do that many times i failed to do that and yet i've seen when i have done it the positive results that it that it gets god's word works yes now so he said you just keep believing when he gets done telling the story he said you just keep believing create the atmosphere never let doubt come around you believe all the time how many could do that this morning believe all the time don't accompany any of that doubt at all no sir no matter what the circumstances is push your way down walk right on through it just refuse it yes sir don't give no grounds at all listen you don't have an option over whether or not you're sick if you're sick you're sick you don't have an option about that but you do have an option whether you're going to be depressed about it you do have an option whether you're going to be whether you're going to spend your life worrying about it you've got options in doing that you say well the devil has stolen things from me but you have an option you can go get them back and even if you died on the journey at least you'd be on the way and then you'd have it all come on yes sir right you'd have it all because once you leave this body to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord right so but sometimes we we we just don't refuse it like we should you need to not sign for that box of rattlesnakes just because it was delivered in your name and just because you feel it doesn't mean that it's yours so now with with his words and his actions he was creating an atmosphere of faith and brother madam said the reason why some people are you you want to be around him he said it's because of the atmosphere that you create for you as a son of god or a miniature creator because you're a part of god and that's the reason you can believe the bible for anything it says yes right for the word is god's word you being a part of god will agree with the word yes he said that do you understand the reason people said this was not inspired and that is not inspired and this is for another day it's because they have never come in contact oh my he said no matter how many degrees they can show that has nothing to do with it but they've never become in contact with god to be born again oh they may have jumped they may have did this they may have a phd they may have spoken tongues they may have danced in the spirit but jesus said by their fruit you shall know them for where the spirit of god is there is love right there's not hate with the spirit of god he's all i have a revelation if it produces hate it's not a revelation from god whether where the spirit of god is there's love there's understanding there's something that you like to be around that's right yes amen and see he's given you the ability to become this creator this miniature creator john 1 says that he in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us but it said that the world that he came to he came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him verse 12 to them gave he power to become the sons of god power to become creators power to be in his image even to them that believe on his name right now we'll fast forward to our text because all of that was background and we'll get to what we're preaching on this morning as we begin to move through this now this is what pentecost was all about right right god was giving them the power to become sons at pentecost the promise of the holy spirit had been given to the disciples by jesus christ but they were told to terry until the promise came that that so that during the time that they were tarrying they made ready for it by creating a right atmosphere yes now think about it we know that they did that because of acts 2 1. it says when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place right now that don't just happen yeah right that don't just happen you don't put 120 people especially 120 jewish people in the same room yes you don't put 120 arkansans in the same room either especially message believers and expect there to be one accord all at once now the holy ghost hadn't come yet right but they were already in one accord and in one place because each one of them was a creator now let's see how they did it just as we saw how brother branham created that atmosphere in his home let's see how they did it on the day of pentecost but the random says this he said god is still the same that he ever was the people gets away from god but god remains the same his nature is power his desire is always the same through every generation it never changes it's always the same it's the people that get away from god not god from the people they lose their faith god covers all space all everywhere he's all not present so he's everywhere he's always has been everywhere he always will be everywhere but it's the attitude of the people that brings the results you realize as much as i would want to i can't make you be healed i can't make you be saved i can't force you to do anything you're you're born a free moral agent you're you're born that way you're that way where you have the right to make a decision i can't make you do that but if you have the right attitude i can preach the word these brothers can preach the word and we can sing about the things of god and we can create an atmosphere so that if you have the right attitude it'll bring a right attitude around you when you have the right attitude then you can receive from god it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord it's the atmosphere what brings the results he said let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus i read you this quote the other day but it fits just right in here he said and believe that he's standing present right now do you believe that that's what you have to believe you got to create an atmosphere so that you believe he's here and then if you believe he's here he's able to do anything because he's god right right you believe he's here he's standing present right now and you'll see something happening oh i pray that god would help us today that we'll believe you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning right he said right this night while we're sitting here if this right atmosphere would take place this entire group would be refilled with the holy ghost every sick person would be made well it's the atmosphere that does it said you can take a head egg and put it in an incubator and keep the atmosphere right it'll hatch out a chicken not an incubator he said because that is it's the atmosphere that counts put a chicken egg under a dog it'll hatch a chicken he said it's the atmosphere yes not our dog he jumps around too much he said that's what it takes in the church today not so much starchy creed in theology but the spirit of the living god pouring down upon among his people upon his people to bring a spiritual atmosphere he said do you know when the holy ghost first came it was on the day of pentecost when they were all in one place and one accord and there came from heaven and sound like a rushing mighty wind that had to get the atmosphere right now again how did they do that how did 11 disciples let alone over 100 other jews 120 jews how did they ever get into that right atmosphere now think about it they were in one place in one accord where before the 11 disciples couldn't even agree about who was the greatest right constantly they were seeing miracles they were seeing signs and wonders they were walking with god literally god was in flesh walking among them and yet they could not agree they wanted to know who would sit on his right hand and on his left hand they wanted to know everything about it they wanted to know how much how much money they would have in the new kingdom they they fought over who was the greatest they fought about just about everything he said they didn't understand many many left but the 11th state but many had already left and and even when he when he left the earth there were 500 that saw him go up that saw the ascension but only 120 of them 380 of them disappeared because it was just too hard they couldn't get along but there was 120 and i'm so thankful for the 120 that put aside their differences and put aside their who was the greatest and put aside all of that and said you know what we're going to believe the word today we're going to come together in an upper room and we're going to believe that god will do what he said could we do that today if we could come together in one accord in one place we could see the same results yes sir right amen now the first thing they obeyed the word yes in luke chapter 24 and verse 49 he said tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from one high so they didn't get up at the first day and say well i think we've been here long enough i think we know enough about it i think we could go now and do what god asked us to do they didn't do that he said perry until and notice he didn't they did what he told them to do he said terry he didn't even say pray he just said terry now they may have prayed but he didn't say pray he said terror do what he says to do he didn't tell him to stand on your head but if he had they'd have been standing on their head for 10 days yeah sure right moses he said moses take your shoes off but the brandon said he didn't tell him to take his hat off right he said take your shoes off he said take his hat off he took his hat off he said take off your shoes yes right and so he just did what god said yes that's how simple it is to come in an atmosphere of faith just do what god said yes right just just do what god said did god say to come together to god say to forgive one another yes if he said to forgive one another what do you do just forgive yes but you don't understand my situation you don't know what i've been through forgive yes he said when you stand pray and forgive that's not optional right right you just do what god says did god tell you how to act and what to do if it's in his word you just obey it yes sir and you don't have to obey everything everybody adds to it he didn't tell him stand on your head he didn't tell him to do jumping jacks are you with me now you don't have to obey everything everybody tells you to do but you got to obey the word of god yes what did the word say yes so that he told them to tear he said do that and and and they did it and so the the bible tells us in first daniel 15 22 that god has a delight not in burnt offerings and sacrifices but in obeying the voice of the lord he said behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of brands it's better just to obey god than it is to make a make a big deal and a big show and make a lot of noise it's better to simply if you'll obey god god will god will there'll be noise there'll be there'll be something happen but it'll be done by god and so to obey is better than sacrifice to hearken or to listen than the fat of rams right micah 6 6 where shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousand rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul oh god yes he said i could do all these things i could i could give all my money to feed the poor i could i could speak in tongues i could prophesy all those things are wonderful i could do all those things but will god be pleased with that no he showed the old man what is good and what does the lord require of thee yes oh god see god is not pleased just because we do things right right he's pleased when we do things according to his word right right he has showed you what is good and what does the lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god you'd be better off just resting in the grace of jesus christ you'd be better off just falling in his arms and saying lord i can't do it for myself then you would being a legalist and trying to set everything up and trying to make your life so so high and so holy that it would appeal unto god no we believe in holiness but it's the holiness of god it's the holiness of god it's something he puts a desire down inside of us to be holy why he won't be pleased with my holiness my my my righteousness is like filthy rags in front of him i can't be clean in front of his presence he don't even recognize my own effort but he recognizes the blood of the lamb oh the blood of jesus i love that song all the blood of jesus it washes white as snow because nothing else will he ever be satisfied with oh i'll come to god i'll believe i'll i'll be a christian when i can quit this or i can do that no he wants you to fall in the arms of jesus yes and he wants you to believe and if you really believe those things will begin to go from you that rebellion will leave you what does he want of you to do justly to love mercy to walk humbly with god see god loves obedience peter when he was fishing one day he'd fished all night caught nothing and jesus said cast out on the other side and peter said lord i fished all night i know how to fish i'm a good fisherman there ain't nothing there yeah there ain't nothing worse than sitting there all day fishing you ever done that you fish all day and they haven't caught nothing somebody walks up and says well if you do this you don't believe i've tried that well if you use corn or if you you know my grandpa you say grandpa fruity'd say if you hold your mouth just right then you'll catch some fish and off when somebody comes and tells you that jesus what is in peter's boat and after they preached he's preached a meeting from the boat and so the people could hear him and he says cast out on the other side he said we've got we've we've fished all night he said but that's thy word lord yes amen at thy word lord he knew there weren't any fish there now you catch it he knew there weren't he had fished it all day and all night his intelligence told him there was no fish every fiber of his being said there's no fish there he could not intellectually accept what jesus said but nevertheless he said that thy word oh that's where god wants you to be today you may be you may completely be able to prove it in your own mind say well it can't be that way i can't be healed i can't be saved my family's not going to make there's no way but if you'll just believe his word yes at thy word lord and the supernatural god caused the ra the fish somehow to either be created in that spot or be led suddenly to that spot not knowing what they were doing but a supernatural god filled the nest with fish until they break and they had to call for help oh that same god is here today if you're struggling with money if you're struggling with those kind of things and god says cast out again do what i told you believe me pay your tithes go to church live for god and he said well i've done it i've tried it and it's not working but if you'll just do what he says god will bless you amen it was a man who was born blind and he was born blind the disciples come to jesus and they said well you know this man must have sanders parents which one was it he said they haven't sinned he said but this was done this man was born blind so the works of god might be manifested yes and john 9 6 said when he had thus spoken he sped on the ground that's a strange healing yeah god works differently almost every time but he still works yes look at all the healings that happened with jesus every time he was different circumstances that's the way he saves you by the way look at how he brought the holy ghost he brought it to some before they were baptized some after they were baptized some some uh the holy ghost fell on them they were baptized later in all different situations paul had a unique experience every one of them had a unique experience the thing is you have to have an experience right you may speak in tongues you may shout you may you may have a warm feeling as john wesley said he was strangely warmed we don't know what it is but there'll be something happening yes right and so he spit in the grass fit on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay yes well that's anti-cova did it regulations isn't it and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which means scent so he sent him to the pool of scent and he went his way and washed and came to seeing yes you imagine brother branham dramatized it he said he's walking along there and people ask me where are you going well i'm going to the pool of siloam because a man told me if i could walk if i'd wash there he's walking around with with clay all over his eyes where are you going you look stupid but i'm going down to do what god told me to do oh they may laugh at you make fun of you whatever else but you say i'm healed i'm delivered i'm saved the clay may still be on my eyes the symptoms may still be there but i'm going down to the pool because that's where god said to go that's what god said to do with simple obedience that led them to the upper room to be in one mind and one accord yes amen we've come today listen in this service let's bring it let's bring it down to our time we've come in obedience to the word the bible says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one of you say well it has to be at a certain time or you have to do a certain thing that's not what he said he said come together yes as a man or some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching so in other words instead of instead of not coming together exhort one another to come together hey man exhort one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching james 5 13 tells us what we should do when we come together is any among you afflicted let him pray is any mary let him sing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith listen shall yes save the sick and the lord shall raise him up amen and if you committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much yes amen no we don't obey as i said to earn grace we obey because of grace yes grace come to the blind man and said if you'll go to the pool of siloam so he obeyed grace it wasn't legalism he obeyed grace and went washed and he was healed amen and secondly they come in a unity of purpose they were with one accord in other words one mind somehow all these different difficult people came with one mind to the meeting that day it may have taken 10 days to get them in one mind but they were there philippians 2 2 says fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind this was not forced we find paul and peter later when paul received the holy ghost he come back he compared notes with peter and they believed the same thing why they both had the same guide which was the holy ghost they've been led to the same thing but the brother said the guide isn't going to take one over this way one over that way send one east and the other one west he's going to keep you together yes amen sometimes i pause for the effect i like to pause when i know it might get quiet the guide won't lead one this way and one that way the guide brings you together why because the words that assemble yourselves together right right he said he's going to keep you together and if we'll just let the holy ghost keep us together we'll be one yes if you just don't let the devil pull you off on the wrong road we'll be one heart one mind one accord by one spirit the holy spirit the guide of god that will guide us to all truth that's right but you got to follow your guide he said we need the fire of god's love in our hearts we can't get warmed by some historical doctrine we've got to have the holy ghost now you believe that today the same spirit that sent pentecostal fire in the first day it's got to be the same pentecostal fire today that's burning their hearts their love they die for one another he said they went forth with only one objective to win souls to christ one motive love yes oh my that's why we do what we do one objective to win souls for christ one motive love why would you do that why would you go for that one person why would you talk to that person look what they've done one motive one objective love yes are you hearing me today that's why we go we don't go to build kingdoms right we don't go to build churches i just got to notice this morning i've gotten my uh my visa to go and where the lord willing will be going to egypt this year and you pray for us i'll tell you more about it but if we're able to go and haven't bought the tickets yet but we've got the we've got the things that we need and got a budget for it and things and they're setting up meetings there's one message church in egypt today but i got to thinking about that and i thought and i struggled with it because it's a lot of money and it's a lot of effort and you never know what's going to happen in a country like that and and we don't even release the details of it where we'll be and things like that because of the country and the people that are there and things that goes on and terrorism and things like that and i thought well what would make it worth it what would what would be success what would make it a success well i tell you if one person yes if one person would accept christ yes would believe in god yes would believe the word would come and be saved be baptized in the name of jesus christ that would be worth it yes that's right right and i had to struggle with that because i don't like doing that but it would be worth it i'm gonna be maybe gone for about 10 days or two weeks and i thought you know and and i i don't want to be gone this is where i want to preach all the time i have the most freedom here because you all have loved me and accepted me and this is where i want to preach but why do i go sometimes somewhere else because because of love love constrains us why do we want to do something for a church where we can't be helped back i'm not intending to build another word of life tabernacle over there we want to see the gospel preach yes are you with me now we're not intending on on building our church up to some mega church i'd like to see ministers go out from this church and start churches all over the place i'd like to see us fill up so we can empty out are you with me now that's what i'd like to see i'm not building a kingdom we're not here to build a kingdom we will go forth with one objective i believe that's what they did after the day of pentecost they went with one objective to win souls to christ one motive love amen they continued daily with one accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house and ate their meat with gladness and singleness notice that word singleness of heart one purpose the bride brother said must be unified together by the word my sheep hear my voice and this is his voice on printed word he said all right you're not unified by the word she makes herself ready not with the regular creed like esther when esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn themselves with all the things but she adorned herself with a sweet meek spirit that's what the bride is adorning herself with with all the fruits of the spirit following what she got assembling together oh my this is the bride yes this is what a prophet taught the bride was assembling together in the fellowship of the word fellowship of the word that's right fellowshipping that's that can't be the bride we just all stay in our own churches that's not what he said yeah fellowshipping or we stay in our own homes that's not what he said sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus tonight one accord one place one spirit one mind one hope one god one purpose every time the bible say anything we say amen amen punctuating every word with amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ see everything it works when you say man let's see how much better that is everything just amen amen amen right on down seeing fellowship you don't have to amend what i say but you do have to mean amen the word yes at least agree with it what were they there in the unity of purpose they were in one place they were in the unity of place i'm closing in just a moment in one place and then say i said a moment that could mean different things to different people he said it wasn't a zoom call or a live stream think about it i've done zoom meetings i preached to over 3000 people on a zoom meeting in india i preached here from the church got up at six o'clock in the morning come up here and preach over 3000 people sitting at their in their separate places because covet was so rampant in that country at the time was my privilege to do that but that's not what pentecost was right you understand they were with one accord in one place one place matters as much as the one accord that's why we come together every opportunity that we get see every time the bible says something we say amen the bible said to be in one accord in one place it wasn't a zoom call or a live stream stream they weren't together in individual homes they were together literally together yes ever since the garden of eden the people of god have come together in that way first corinthians chapter 12 tells us our comely parts have no need but god had tempered the body together tempered the body together he's made it fit together to where he's talking about those parts which have more need the parts that are stronger can help the parts that are weaker that's the way god made it we can't do that off by ourselves we need to be together he said having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another yes so i care for you in the way that you care for me and i care for my family in the way that i care for you for your family you care for my family in the way that you care for your family sure i understand there's obligations you have to your family you don't have the mind but you do have the same care because we're the bride of christ we're the children of god he said having the same care one for another when one member suffers all the members suffer with it one member be honored all the members rejoice with such an hour where there's no empathy today and that scares me it scares me when somebody can cut themselves off from people and walk away and never never have any empathy never try to help them yeah i don't care how right you are that it's wrong yes right there's no empathy in it you see these shooters go out and go into a a grocery store and start shooting people yeah no empathy for people don't care yeah don't even care can laugh while they shoot people live stream it yeah oh god one member suffers and people watch that trash people kill one another even on a movie and and the blood and the gore and the destruction people watch that junk and laugh at it become immune to its effects but the bible calls for empathy among believers yes when one member suffers don't get hard church when one member suffers we all suffer yes when one member is honored all the members rejoice with it yes no jealousy but the brother said when the holy spirit come in the upper room there come a sound as a rushing mighty wind he said nothing nothing was blowing it just like a sound like it was he said it filled all the house where they were sitting and then cloven tongue sat upon them like fire he said how did this great pillar of fire the angel of god the logos that went out of god that led the children of israel to the wilderness when it came among these people it separated itself and great licks of fire began to come on each one as the pillar of fire began to break up he said was god dividing himself among his people he said oh that ought to tear the heart out of anybody god tearing himself apart where did he do that on calvary god tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit with each one of us that all together he said you see what it means he said can you see now why i'm standing for unity of every church every full gospel church every believer we ought to be one heart one mind and one accord he said no matter how much we differ in the scriptures he said one might see it this way that has nothing to do with it he talked about how we stand on principle not on our different ideas but we stand on certain principles of the word of god now if those principles aren't there and someone don't believe in the virgin birth they don't believe in jesus they don't believe in god they don't believe in the things that we've the major doctrines it's hard two can't walk together unless they want agreed but when we have a principles that we share we can come together in fellowship we don't care about our little differing ideas yes right that's what brother branham taught us he said oh how i think of god separating himself that he might dip down i love this into his big soul and i just got this mental picture of god with this great big soul and he takes a ladle and he dips down into it a spoon a lay it dips down into it and he pours out a little spoonful in me yes a spoonful in you you see why it's so important that we come together he dips down into this limitless soul of god that always was that wasn't created that that was before time that was the self-existing one and he dips down into his attributes into his into his soul and he said he takes a spoonful and he puts it on you gives it to you in a spoonful to me that's what happened in the upper room he said and you and you and you and you he said dividing himself the fire the cleansing power of god yes he said then if you have a spoonful and i have a spoonful and we both get together we've got two spoonfuls it's math some of you will figure it out later and if 50 of us are together we got more of us here than that this morning if 50 of us are together we got 50 spoonfuls wow where there is unity where there is gathering yes there is safety and what more it's right it's good oh god do you ever you need to feel safe today yes or there's unity where there's gathering there is safety now jesus body was broken on calvary and we typed that in the communion paul said the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion or the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ the communion itself isn't the literal body but it's a type of the broken body of christ the body of christ is broken on the earth we're separated so we come together as much as we can does that make sense yeah we are not all of god there is no man who is a god to himself because the fullness of the god had dwelt bodily in jesus christ and since that day it's been divided among the entire church yes i don't have any more of god than you do right if you've received the holy ghost right so now he said did you notice he said the communion when we come together in this way there god comes down yes do you believe he's here today when we come together in this way what did he say in the scripture when two or three are gathered together in my name there am i yes there am i not i will come but there am i he said it and when we come together god comes down and the communion table is actually break broken body for the body of the lord that we separate among us he said did you notice on the day of pentecost what a great thing we have there that god who led the children of israel through the wilderness that great pillar of fire on the day of pentecost this great fire fell and divided itself among his people oh to think how he wants us to sit together in heavenly places he said then each one enjoying that warmth of the fire of the holy spirit cloven tongue set upon them like licks of fire he said god dividing himself amongst the church oh wouldn't that though just set our hearts burning that when we come together he said that's when we can come together in heavenly places he said now we know that his table where the people sit together and commune with him i love this he said it's like an oasis in a desert yes the world's a desert today yes you need an oasis in the desert yes he said it's like an oasis in a desert he said and there where there's a great spring where weary travelers come all that we could be that as a church where weary travelers come and sit around this oasis in the desert and refresh themselves and then remembering how it got there he said and that's the way it is in the church this table of communion where all the blessings of god the full gospel everything that god has for his church is brought out laid out among us it's like an oasis in this hot burning sinful desert that we're traveling through and then when we come in and talk of and read the menu don't you love to sit in a nice restaurant and sit down and look at the menu and everything's just prepared everything's proper it's beautiful and it's like i like it i love it the way they do it in africa and different places and we're in the philippines in that tropical country where you can sit out on the veranda you sit outside and the weather's so nice there by the ocean and you can sit there and and the waiter a nice waiter dressed nice will come up to you and bring you something to drink and give you a menu and you sit there reading the menu he said that's what we do when we come to church we sit here and we read the menu he said and he when he see when we see that he turns back around i love this and he's not fresh out of this yes very bad now look he here we are sitting together we're reading the menu says well the lord said i'm the god that heals all thy diseases and when we ask him say waiter preacher tell me is he still the same yes oh he's fresh out no he's not he said jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever waiter can you tell me is there still joy can i still have joy is the promise there for my kids is it still there waiter tell me and the preacher if he's a gospel preacher a full gospel preacher he'll come back and he'll say yes yes you can still have joy yes the cook's got it yes he's able to prepare it my wife and i went out to eat for our anniversary the other night we went out and went to this steakhouse up here and maybe i shouldn't mention the name of the place but they didn't do anything it wasn't their fault really just the way it is right now everything's all messed up and so we went there and they have good food and good service and i looked at the menu and i got something and my wife ordered some shorter chicken tenders and and because neither one wanted to spend much money and we've gotten past that i've been married 16 years so and so she ordered chicken tenders and i had some kind of pasta and i and and we come there and and they brought mine and they said yours will be out in a minute and she sat there for a while and sat there for a while and the lady come out embarrassed she said we don't even have chicken tenders it wasn't the best day for brittany so they gave her what i had she waited a while and got what i had and we left we went to dollar general get some ice for mom and she went in there and paid for the ice walked out there was no ice went to casey's to get ice drove down to casey's went to get ice and i looked and i saw the first thing i saw there was a sign on the ice machine i thought you got to be kidding me so i went in this time because i didn't want her to be rejected again i went in i parked right by the ice machine they said oh there's i said you want a large bag i said yes whatever you've got must be an ice shortage she said okay it's around the other side of the building so i walked all the way around the other side of the building and there was a 20-pound bag of ice i pulled it up it was stuck to the floor i pulled it up from the floor and had a hole in it so i had to carry the ice like a baby god god's not like that there's a shortage of baby food but not of the holy ghost there may be a shortage of gas but not of the fire of god there may be a shortage of doctors in medicine but there's not a shortage of healing yes sir are you hearing me today god there's still god he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not broken yes he don't have workers that aren't equipped for the job but he has said in the church god has set in the church prophets pastors evangelists teachers god did that his waiters are there they're they're not there for their own sales they're they're there to let you read the menu oh god so that you can pick the blessings of god that you need oh my listen he's not fresh out of this or fresh out of that or that struck off but he's the same yesterday today and forever he's got everything on the menu ready to give it out that's the good part he said then we can just look over the menu and just take the whole thing you know sometimes god just lets you go through things i had this quote i'd already finished my notes before we had that experience this week i just happened to think of it he's not fresh out well we are enjoying these blessings musicians go ahead and come i'll never quit but we're enjoying these blessings each one feeling his presence saying amen praise god hallelujah so forth he said in that we can remember the one that brought it to us i'm so thankful for the one that provided the food not just the natural food but the spiritual food that feeds my soul he made it possible he said the death of the lord jesus christ the son of god remember him we came together brenda i'm going to ask you in just a moment to come and we're going to pray for her today for her healing and maybe there'd be someone else in a moment as they play something softly and we'll have you come in just a moment but you know when they left that place in the upper room they left that place and they they said they went to the temple because just what they did they liked to go to church they left the upper room they went to the temple and as they were going there was a man lying there was lame in his feet and he was sitting there and he's crying for alms and peter looked at him being a pentecostal preacher he didn't have much money but he looked at him he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i have something i'm a creator [Music] i have something i have something from god there's no shortage such as i have i give he said rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ said the man and what they did then is they helped him that's the role of the church see they had to help him stand we should be gathered around one another that when we see someone this week we can help them stand and they grabbed him by the hand helped him stand and then his ankle bones received strength the bible says he began to run begin to walk and begin to leave begin to praise god why there was no shortage on healing i was in africa in a prayer line i'll never forget it brother wilson robert wilson preached that night in benin africa one of the poorest countries of the world there was a lady who came that night her husband was a catholic she went to some other kind of church and her her son had been in a car accident was laying in the hospital with a broken body and they don't have any way their hospitals are just we wouldn't even go to them they call the one in togo call it the morgue they just they just don't go to the hospital if they have to because this is where you go to die your son was laying in the hospital she'd never been in that kind of a service she didn't know nothing about the message and she'd come in the prayer line and and her her son was lying there her husband was at home hadn't been able to work they were dead in a desperate condition unable to work and her husband was at home a catholic he was unable to work he had some kind of a sickness they couldn't figure it out another family member had another sickness in his body and so she come with those multiple requests and said she come up the first time and she felt the power of god moving the prayer line she goes home and gets her husband that's how long the prayer line was she goes home and gets her husband brings him back to the meeting and brings him back through now i don't even remember the couple but she sent us she actually told the pastor of a church later in benin and he emailed it to us the testimony and he said that when they went to the prayer line the man was supernaturally healed he said a god like that i'll go to a church that believes in a living god and that family sits they they found out what was wrong with the other family member the son was healed and come out of the hospital a few days later and this is the woman who knew nothing but in that atmosphere where the people had gathered together just like we are this morning they were there with one mind and one accord no distractions there weren't even any cars the parking lot there was about 50 about 50 motorcycles and a thousand people came to that meeting they either walked or they come on a motorcycle 50 motorcycles brought a thousand people to a meeting to sit in the extreme heat with no air conditioning and the dark with almost no lights and to sit there and listen to the word of god preach and when they heard it preach and they come to the prayer line they just believed god but it created such an atmosphere of faith don't you see we can do that every service we don't need to let one of them fall to the ground every service now that we may not always shout and dance and run the house but every service there ought to be an atmosphere of faith in our in our church that god could move in every home there ought to be an atmosphere of faith so that when you have a need even when you're not in the church you can believe god yes lord i believe as a man said help thou my unbelief and brenda if you would come and if some of you want to come with her that would be fine you want to come and and uh your daughter hadas is here with her and aunt janet and my my mother
