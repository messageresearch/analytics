[30:56] been on this some of you been here I've
[30:59] preached to the last couple times just
[31:00] on the atonement just you know one God
[31:03] lay something on your heart just seems
[31:05] like you can't get away from it
[31:06] sometimes and so just pray it's a
[31:08] blessing tonight if we would let's just
[31:10] read that numbers chapter 21 and verse 4
[31:13] and then we will bow our heads for word
[31:15] of Prayer
[31:15] and they journeyed from mount hor by the
[31:17] way of the Red Sea to compass the land
[31:19] of Edom and the soul of the people was
[31:21] much discouraged because of the way if
[31:24] we could just bow our heads if you have
[31:26] maybe an unspoken request or something
[31:28] it's on your heart you'd like God to
[31:29] speak to you tonight I won't you just
[31:31] make that known by the lifting of your
[31:32] hand Lord we just come before you this
[31:35] evening Lord just with the great
[31:36] expectation just to hear from you
[31:38] god I pray you just move me aside and
[31:40] come and speak to your children Lord
[31:42] just once again god I pray that if
[31:44] there's if there's anything that's in
[31:45] the way to not god I pray you just
[31:47] remove that tonight Lord and just let
[31:49] your spirit come and have free will here
[31:50] tonight with your people or if there be
[31:52] any sick among us or listening in God I
[31:54] pray while the word goes forth that your
[31:56] healing power would go with it pray just
[31:58] bless the words bless the the people
[32:00] that have come out tonight to they've
[32:02] set aside this time to come in here from
[32:04] you I pray you just bless them as well
[32:05] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[32:09] you can have your seats tonight I'll
[32:12] read their numbers chapter 21 and verse
[32:13] 4 again and we'll read down to verse 9
[32:15] and they journeyed from Mount hor by the
[32:17] way of the Red Sea to compass the land
[32:19] of Edom and the soul of the people was
[32:21] much discouraged because of the way and
[32:24] the people will begin to speak against
[32:26] God and against Moses wherefore have you
[32:28] brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
[32:30] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[32:33] is there any water our soul loathe this
[32:35] light bread and and the Lord sent fiery
[32:37] serpents
[32:38] among the people and they bit the people
[32:40] and much people of Israel died and
[32:41] therefore the people who came to Moses
[32:44] and said we have sinned for we have
[32:46] spoken against the Lord and against the
[32:48] prey unto the Lord that he take away the
[32:50] Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for
[32:52] the people and the Lord said unto Moses
[32:55] make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon
[32:57] a pole and it shall come to pass that
[32:59] every one that has bitten when he
[33:00] looketh upon it shall live and Moses
[33:03] made a serpent of brass and put it on a
[33:05] pole and it came to pass that if a
[33:06] serpent had bitten any man when he
[33:09] beheld the serpent of brass he lived and
[33:12] so you know many times reading through
[33:14] the the scripture here and many times
[33:16] reading through through the Bible you
[33:17] look at the children of Israel and you
[33:19] just you kind of get sick of it you're
[33:20] like well lady they serve God and then
[33:22] they go back and they serve God and they
[33:23] go back and they do this and they go
[33:25] back and they do this and they go back
[33:26] and we see many times they do this and
[33:29] then we kind of look at our own life and
[33:30] we say you know it's kind of like it's
[33:34] kind of like me you know I kind of
[33:35] forget what God did for me in the past
[33:37] and forget this and forget that and I
[33:38] come back to another mountain and I get
[33:40] so I get tired again I get get exhausted
[33:42] I get down again and we become
[33:44] discouraged because of the way and I
[33:46] want you to know that people begin to
[33:47] speak against God and against Moses and
[33:49] says wherefore have you brought us up
[33:51] out of Egypt to die in the wilderness
[33:53] for there's no bread neither is there
[33:55] any water and our soul oh that's a
[33:57] slight bread and we know that that God
[33:59] had sent man amongst the people and they
[34:01] begin to reject that word that that life
[34:03] that he was sending to him and they
[34:04] begin to become discouraged and so we
[34:07] see that God had to send fiery serpents
[34:09] among the people and I wanted to look
[34:11] this this evening if we could just to
[34:13] look at the atonement and what all was
[34:14] within that atonement and brother
[34:16] Branham said the brass serpent had a
[34:17] compound meaning it meant the healing
[34:19] and removal of sin and so we see that
[34:22] whenever there's you know when we look
[34:23] at the brass serpent it wasn't only that
[34:25] they would be healed and lived but it
[34:26] was the removal of sin as well and so I
[34:29] really want to focus on that tonight
[34:30] brother Branham says he says and out of
[34:32] a very beautiful parable what was it
[34:35] lifted up for the brazen serpent he said
[34:37] for healing it was a compound reason
[34:39] when they needed Hill and they lifted up
[34:41] the brass serpent what was it it was
[34:43] because they were murmuring and
[34:44] chattering against God and Moses and it
[34:47] was for a compound reason that they were
[34:48] murmuring in sinan and they were sick
[34:50] and he did heal and he said and my
[34:52] as Jesus said as Moses lifted up the
[34:54] brass serpent in the wilderness just for
[34:56] the same purpose the same cause the same
[34:58] atonement so must the Son of Man be
[35:01] lifted up it's a compound reason to save
[35:03] your soul
[35:04] so we see that Christ he didn't die on
[35:05] the cross just for the healing it wasn't
[35:07] just for the stripes that he bore but it
[35:09] was for salvation of our soul is that
[35:11] correct
[35:12] there was more that was in the atonement
[35:14] than just the repair or just the
[35:15] repentance of sins it was a new life in
[35:17] the atonement and the smitten rock that
[35:20] brought forth water that gushed out into
[35:22] the land to save a perishing people God
[35:24] so loved the world in his knew he said
[35:26] in the New Testament the type or the
[35:28] anti-type rather God so loved the world
[35:31] that He gave His only begotten Son that
[35:32] whosoever shall believeth him should not
[35:34] perish but have everlasting life he said
[35:38] there you are and that's what was
[35:39] perishing and dying and helpless people
[35:41] that the brass serpent was lifted up and
[35:43] the smitten Rock was smitten was to give
[35:45] forth life and healing and peace to
[35:48] those people he said so God lifted up
[35:51] his son that you would not perish but
[35:52] have everlasting life he says my brother
[35:55] my sister I pray you'll accept him
[35:57] tonight so we see that Christ was lifted
[35:59] up that you and I might take on the new
[36:01] life of Christ as that right so within
[36:03] the atonement you we have healing we
[36:05] have salvation there's so much that lays
[36:07] within the atonement it's the removal of
[36:09] sin if you will accept that atonement
[36:12] amen and that was the part that was on
[36:14] the people they didn't have to do
[36:15] anything else but look and live is that
[36:17] right so we see tonight it's not about
[36:19] what you've done or what you've been or
[36:20] where you're going it's about if you can
[36:22] look at that you have that right as a
[36:24] Christian as a human being to look at
[36:26] that and live tonight amen so we see
[36:29] that God he took all the responsibility
[36:30] he took all the all all the debt are all
[36:33] the things upon him and let us have the
[36:36] reward is that right
[36:37] brother branham says the Christ is the
[36:39] inexhaustible fountain of life we are
[36:41] planted in him by the Holy Spirit he
[36:43] said and then all we have to do is drink
[36:45] from him amen do you love the Lord this
[36:48] evening so we see there is in John
[36:50] chapter 3 and verse 1 and I'll just kind
[36:52] of work my way into this and and if you
[36:54] if you've ever heard me preach I just
[36:56] start going and keep going as fast as I
[36:57] can so I pray you can keep up I've tried
[37:00] to slow down but it just doesn't work
[37:01] for me so
[37:03] and even just take notes as fast as you
[37:05] can or just hang on for the ride a man
[37:07] there was a man in the pharisees named
[37:10] nicodemus a ruler of the jews and the
[37:12] same came to jesus by night and said
[37:14] unto him rabbi we know that thou are a
[37:15] teacher come from God for no man can do
[37:18] these miracles that thou doest except
[37:20] God be with him jesus answered and said
[37:22] to him verily verily I say unto you
[37:23] except a man be born again he cannot see
[37:26] the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said
[37:28] saith unto Him how can a man be born
[37:30] when he is old can he enter a second
[37:33] time into his mother's womb and be born
[37:34] so this see this question was presented
[37:37] of Jesus and brother branham says and
[37:39] who is God and nineteen fifty says o the
[37:41] brass serpent couldn't pray for nobody
[37:43] couldn't the brass serpent didn't he
[37:45] said what did they do the brass serpent
[37:47] you believe that was God's gift to
[37:48] Israel right he said they looked and
[37:50] lived the angel in the pool in the water
[37:52] Bethesda didn't pray for nobody they
[37:54] stepped in the water and was healed is
[37:56] that right God is the only way that you
[37:58] can be healed tonight if you look at
[38:00] that and you read into that it's all
[38:01] about the faith if you look at something
[38:03] and believe it God will make it come to
[38:05] pass a man but if you look at the Word
[38:06] of God you don't have faith in it then
[38:08] nothing
[38:08] fruitful will come of that is that right
[38:10] amen I believe you know it's like I
[38:13] believe brother Bren was speaking on it
[38:14] you know you just write the check if you
[38:17] begin to look and say well there's
[38:18] nothing in the bank account I don't want
[38:19] but I don't believe when I write this
[38:21] check it's gonna be it's gonna be
[38:22] payable I just don't believe it then
[38:24] guess what that check is not going to be
[38:25] payable but if you look at it and live
[38:27] and believe with your heart it will be
[38:29] cashed amen so we see in verse five down
[38:32] on in John chapter three jesus answered
[38:34] and said verily verily I say unto you
[38:35] except a man be born of water and of
[38:37] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[38:40] of God he said that which is born of the
[38:43] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[38:44] the Spirit is spirit
[38:45] malvert Marvel not that I saying to you
[38:48] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[38:50] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[38:53] sound thereof but cannot tell whence it
[38:55] cometh or whether it goeth so is every
[38:57] one that is born of the Spirit Nicodemus
[38:59] answered and said to him how can these
[39:01] things be and jesus answered and said
[39:04] unto Him art thou a master in Israel and
[39:06] knowest not these things he said verily
[39:08] verily I say unto you we speak that we
[39:11] do know and testify that we have seen
[39:13] and he received not our witness if I had
[39:15] told you earthly
[39:16] and you believe not how shall you
[39:18] believe if I tell you of heavenly things
[39:20] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[39:22] that come down from heaven even the Son
[39:24] of Man which is in heaven and as Moses
[39:27] lifted up the serpent in the serpent in
[39:29] the wilderness even so must the Son of
[39:31] Man be lifted up that whosoever
[39:32] believeth in him should not perish but
[39:35] have eternal life for God so loved the
[39:37] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[39:39] that whosoever believeth in him should
[39:41] not perish but have everlasting life and
[39:43] so just to kind of lay a foundation
[39:45] there and just kind of go back over over
[39:47] that but we see in our own personal life
[39:49] and you know I used my family a lot and
[39:52] in my examples but you know there's one
[39:54] time I took Matney and I brought him up
[39:56] here and I didn't tell him what I was
[39:57] gonna do I didn't tell him I just set
[39:59] him up on the pulpit and I turned him
[40:00] around I'm like fall back and he just
[40:02] immediately fell back and I caught him
[40:04] why he had faith that I was going to
[40:06] catch him is that right and I believe as
[40:08] Christians when we look into the Word of
[40:09] God if we have faith and we look into
[40:12] the Word of God and it says we can be
[40:13] healed or we can have the things that we
[40:15] desire if you have faith it will be
[40:17] given unto you is that right the Bible
[40:20] says if you have the faith of the grain
[40:21] of a mustard seed anything that you ask
[40:23] shall be given unto you and I believe as
[40:25] Christians that's the way it ought to be
[40:27] in our lives if we ask God for something
[40:29] just because we don't get it the next
[40:31] day or the next day we ought to believe
[40:32] even more the next day that it's gonna
[40:34] come around the next corner amen
[40:36] you know when we when we ask God for
[40:38] something we he's not an errand boy that
[40:40] he would go and fetch it for us
[40:41] immediately I know brother Branham says
[40:43] God wants to give it to you more than
[40:44] you want it and I think it's hard for us
[40:46] to fathom that sometimes but if we could
[40:48] just look into the Word of God and say
[40:50] this is my right as a Christian if I ask
[40:53] anything in the name of the Father he
[40:55] will give it to me then we as Christians
[40:57] ought to believe that once we ask that
[40:59] it's coming it's on its way amen if you
[41:02] call somebody and you say hey do this
[41:03] for me would you mail this for me would
[41:05] you get this for me that takes faith to
[41:08] believe that person's gonna do it amen
[41:10] I don't call Matney and be like hey
[41:12] could you go in and start the oven and
[41:14] cook supper because I know he wouldn't
[41:16] know what to do but I know when my wife
[41:18] calls me or I call her to start the oven
[41:20] we know how to handle that and I can
[41:22] promise you tonight there's nothing you
[41:24] can ask God that he don't know how to
[41:25] handle amen if you can just come to him
[41:27] and believe that it will come to pass
[41:29] and it's God's will for it to come to
[41:31] pass in your life then it shall come to
[41:33] pass a man and that's the thing we have
[41:35] to remember as people just because we
[41:37] want it doesn't mean it's right for us
[41:38] is that right you know I heard a man say
[41:41] one time at a convention you know and I
[41:43] think I've heard it many other times but
[41:45] you know many people want more money and
[41:47] he said you know if you're not faithful
[41:48] with a hundred what would make you
[41:50] faithful with a million if you can't
[41:52] handle a hundred you can't handle a mean
[41:53] so if you can't have faith to cure a
[41:55] headache why are you trying to stop
[41:56] storms and move mountains and things
[41:58] you've got to start off and build your
[42:00] faith is that right if you have faith to
[42:02] believe it it shall come to pass but and
[42:04] brother Branham says he said the serpent
[42:06] represented sin already judged God
[42:08] judged the serpent in the Garden of Eden
[42:10] in the third chapter of Genesis in the
[42:12] fourteenth verse God already passed
[42:14] judgment upon the sir but he said oh he
[42:16] was beautiful walked upright he was the
[42:19] most subtle bita beast of the field but
[42:20] God judged him and put him down on his
[42:22] belly the rest of his days and he says
[42:24] he was judged and Christ was our sins
[42:28] judge he says amen do you see it
[42:29] beautiful my sin your sins
[42:31] justly we should go to hell and be
[42:33] punished for our sins but Christ took
[42:35] our place he said the serpent he said
[42:37] that's why it represented Christ the
[42:39] brass serpent being made out of brass
[42:40] meant divine judgment he said now the
[42:43] serpent was sin already judged and he
[42:45] said the brass meant divine judgment so
[42:47] it was divine judgment on our sin
[42:49] already being judged and and that's the
[42:51] great thing tonight that you and I have
[42:53] is as Christians our sin is no longer
[42:56] attached to you and I as that right
[42:57] everything that you and I had done or
[43:00] had failed or had - had fallen or what
[43:02] anything that was in our past God took
[43:04] it and judged it upon Christ is that
[43:06] right and the ultimate sacrifice was
[43:08] paid then that you and I could go free
[43:10] amen
[43:10] that's why we don't do we don't do bulls
[43:13] and goats he was the ultimate sacrifice
[43:14] that entered once into into the Holy of
[43:18] Holies that he would be our sacrifice
[43:20] for ever and ever is that right
[43:22] Hebrews 12 and 6 verse says for whom the
[43:25] Lord loveth he chased Mithen scourgeth
[43:27] every son whom he receiveth if he
[43:29] endured the chastening God dealeth with
[43:31] you as sons for what son is he whom the
[43:33] father chasing if not and I believe as
[43:36] people we like everything easy we live
[43:39] in a microwave age is that right you
[43:41] know we don't want we
[43:42] want to go to a restaurant and have our
[43:44] food ready by the time we get there we
[43:45] haven't even ordered yet but we want our
[43:47] food ready is that right and we see many
[43:49] times in life you know my kids don't
[43:52] understand what you know what what I had
[43:54] to wait on and I don't understand what
[43:55] my parents had to wait on what my
[43:57] grandparents had to wait on you know we
[43:59] grow up and we see different things and
[44:01] I look at the things my kids not gonna
[44:02] see that I ever did you know I didn't
[44:05] have a cell phone at this age I didn't
[44:06] have access they didn't have I phones
[44:08] you know when I was younger now it's
[44:09] just all smartphone technology and and
[44:11] you know we we don't know what we did
[44:13] before we had phones is that right we
[44:15] were disconnected so to speak but it
[44:18] seems to be that everybody was fine
[44:19] before it got here but now if we leave
[44:22] we we don't know what to do is that
[44:23] right you know my phone died last night
[44:25] like it's 6 o'clock and I didn't have it
[44:27] till this morning at 8 it was great I
[44:29] was disconnected but nobody could get
[44:32] ahold of me nobody you know there was no
[44:33] way there was no way to connect to me
[44:35] and and I believe in this age we've kind
[44:37] of grown to where everything is instant
[44:38] it's an instant age instant mashed
[44:40] potatoes instant everything and and as
[44:43] Christians that's not all the way that
[44:44] God's time is not our time is that right
[44:46] you know you know if we ask God for
[44:49] something we expect it to be done right
[44:51] then and if any of you work in customer
[44:52] service with people when they call you
[44:54] they want it done right then it's not
[44:56] like we have a thousand other things to
[44:58] do where we're helping a hundred people
[44:59] and there's a list we're going down it's
[45:00] like let me stop everything that I'm
[45:02] doing right now and just take care of
[45:04] you and and that's not the way it always
[45:05] works is that right you call somebody
[45:08] you want something you want it done
[45:09] right then and I have a lot of customers
[45:11] who just you know who think they just
[45:12] hung the moon and the world revolves
[45:14] around them if I don't take care of them
[45:16] it's just the end of the world and
[45:17] that's not the way it works and I don't
[45:18] call people and expect that same thing
[45:20] and and as humans we just get this idea
[45:23] ideology that we are the most important
[45:25] thing the universe wraps itself around
[45:27] us and and were that we're it we're the
[45:30] one thing my little boy Matney when it
[45:32] comes to chocolate that's what the world
[45:34] revolves around is chocolate you know I
[45:37] asked him do you love me or chocolate
[45:39] chocolate every time it's it I know it's
[45:41] gonna be chocolate I don't have to
[45:43] question it I don't know it's just
[45:44] that's that's what his world revolves
[45:46] around and and you know so so as
[45:48] Christians and as people we've got to
[45:50] begin to look and say you know hey
[45:52] there's more than just me is that right
[45:54] there's more than just what I want and
[45:56] what
[45:56] what I need this is what what the Oh the
[45:59] greater picture is the bigger picture is
[46:01] what God wants me to be amen
[46:02] you know you hear all the time people
[46:04] saying well God told me to do this and
[46:05] God told me to do this listen God is not
[46:08] going to tell you anything that doesn't
[46:09] line with his word amen so if if
[46:11] somebody comes you said God told me to
[46:13] do this and it doesn't line with the
[46:14] word doesn't line with a message then
[46:15] God didn't tell them to do that when he
[46:17] speaks something from the you begin and
[46:19] his said his word will not return unto
[46:21] Him void it's not gonna change on the
[46:22] way back if God tells you to do
[46:24] something then and it lines with the
[46:26] word then it will come to pass say man
[46:30] do you love the Lord tonight and then
[46:33] we've got the people on the other side
[46:34] of the spectrum that God does tell them
[46:37] to do something God does give them a
[46:38] promise but they're too afraid to take
[46:40] it amen you've got the people who spend
[46:43] the money when there's no money and you
[46:44] got people who won't spend the money
[46:45] when there is money is that right now
[46:48] I'm a banker so that's just where my
[46:49] mind goes I'm not saying anything about
[46:51] anybody but you got people who don't
[46:52] have it they spin it you got people who
[46:54] do have it and whilst you couldn't get a
[46:55] penny out of them
[46:56] I always go back to my grandpa Wayne pep
[46:58] all Wayne and man you know he's worked
[47:01] all his life he's retired and and I'm
[47:03] sure he has some money but when he would
[47:05] take me and my cousin somewhere we
[47:07] stayed in the cheapest hotel we ate
[47:09] bologna sandwiches I mean it was it was
[47:11] rough living for me I thought but and
[47:13] these hotels were rough I'm talking
[47:15] rough hotels and so you know this place
[47:18] my mom probably wouldn't let me stay but
[47:19] you see you've got people on both end of
[47:21] the spectrum is that right you got some
[47:23] people are afraid to look at the word
[47:25] and say well this is for me is that
[47:27] right and you've got people who just go
[47:29] and throw it out everywhere well God
[47:30] said I can have this God said I can have
[47:32] that and they're speaking things into
[47:33] existence they're doing this and and as
[47:35] Christians we've got to align ourselves
[47:36] with the word we've got as brother
[47:39] branham said get back in line we've got
[47:40] to get back on point is that right
[47:42] because if you're off an inch at 20
[47:44] yards at a hundred yards you're going to
[47:46] be off a couple feet and we know that
[47:47] and and so we see that as God is dealing
[47:50] with our lives and dealing with us as
[47:52] Christians we've got to align ourselves
[47:54] with the word and and as Christians I
[47:56] think when we when we align ourselves
[47:58] with the word we're looking at that
[47:59] atonement we're looking at that
[48:01] sacrifice and and we're constantly
[48:03] reminded this is what God did for me so
[48:05] that I would have eternal life and and
[48:07] anytime we begin to say this is what I
[48:09] did and this is
[48:10] I'm doing we get away from Christ amen
[48:13] you know we see that Moses endured
[48:15] chastening when he returned to Egypt and
[48:17] I love how brother Brandon put it he
[48:19] said what Moses lacked the burning bush
[48:21] had and and what the church lacks the
[48:23] Holy Spirit has is that right so
[48:25] everything that you don't have God's
[48:27] gonna supply it amen and everything that
[48:29] you do have if you've got a little bit
[48:31] of extra God might have to chasten you
[48:33] and chip that away too you can line with
[48:35] the true Christian God wants you to be
[48:37] amen amen you love the Lord this evening
[48:40] so the word atonement it's actually an
[48:42] agreement a Concord or reconciliation
[48:44] after enmity or controversy and so we'll
[48:48] go to Romans 5 if we can in verse 10 and
[48:51] it says for for if when we were enemies
[48:53] we were reconciled to God by the death
[48:55] of his son much more being reconciled we
[48:57] shall be saved by his life and not only
[49:00] so but we also joy in God through our
[49:03] Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now have
[49:05] received the atonement are you thankful
[49:08] for the atonement tonight he says
[49:10] wherefore as by one man sin entered the
[49:12] world and death by sin so and so death
[49:16] passed upon all men for that we all that
[49:19] all have sinned so we see that when sin
[49:21] entered in the garden it through all of
[49:23] man into the fall is that right from
[49:25] then on out it was a fall for man and
[49:27] sin had entered in so therefore death
[49:30] had entered in says for and it says for
[49:32] at verse 13 for unto the law sin was in
[49:35] the world but sin is not imputed where
[49:37] there is no law nevertheless death
[49:40] reigned from Adam and to Moses even over
[49:42] them that had not sinned after the
[49:45] similitude of Adam's transgression who
[49:47] is the figure of him that was to come
[49:49] but not as of the offence so also is the
[49:52] free gift for if through the offence of
[49:55] one many be dead much more the grace of
[49:58] God and the gift by grace which is by
[50:01] one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto
[50:03] many and I thought that's a lot of back
[50:06] and forth but if you look it was a gift
[50:08] it was a free gift and anything about a
[50:10] gift if brother bian came out and gave
[50:13] me a water and I gave him a dollar for
[50:14] it that's not a gift if he comes out and
[50:17] gives me a water and I take that I give
[50:18] him nothing in return that's a gift amen
[50:20] so I want you to know this free gift God
[50:22] didn't want any
[50:23] thing in return from you he didn't want
[50:25] you to do anything he didn't want you to
[50:27] mess it up or get involved in any way he
[50:28] gave you that free gift and and me and
[50:30] brother Brent Ben we're kind of talking
[50:32] before service and and that's the thing
[50:34] I love about Christianity when you lead
[50:36] somebody to Christ you can see that they
[50:38] actually met him by the fruits of their
[50:40] life is that right you can see if you
[50:42] lead somebody to legalism and they just
[50:44] change for church and they just change
[50:46] for this and just change dear and these
[50:48] times but their outward life doesn't
[50:49] reflect Christ is that right so that's
[50:52] the thing about Christianity if you if
[50:54] you actually if you actually are saved
[50:56] and filled with the Holy Ghost you can't
[50:58] help but express what's on the inside is
[51:00] that right you can you can you can cut
[51:03] every limb off an orange tree it doesn't
[51:05] change that it's an orange tree from
[51:07] that seed gene is that right and if
[51:09] Christ was away if you're that seat of
[51:11] Christ there's no devil no mountain no
[51:14] trial no no no problem that can ever
[51:16] bury that seed deep enough that it can't
[51:18] grow to the fruit of Jesus Christ so we
[51:21] see in verse 16 and not as it though not
[51:23] as it was by one that sinned so was the
[51:26] gift for the judgment by what was by one
[51:28] to condemnation but the free gift is of
[51:31] many offenses under justification for if
[51:34] by one man's offense death reigned by
[51:37] one much more they which receive
[51:39] abundance of grace and the gift of
[51:41] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[51:43] Jesus Christ therefore as by the offence
[51:46] of one judgment came upon all men to
[51:49] condemnation and so all of us were born
[51:52] in sin and shaped in iniquity none of
[51:53] you were born perfect none of you were
[51:56] as much as I think my little girl is the
[51:58] cutest human being in the world she's
[52:01] not perfect she's got to have a change
[52:04] is that right
[52:05] many of you think yourself you think oh
[52:07] man I am the cat's meow I'm the perfect
[52:09] one let me tell you something if you
[52:11] have that attitude you will die and go
[52:12] to hell without Christ there's none of
[52:14] us it doesn't matter how good you preach
[52:16] how good you sing how good you dress how
[52:18] good you do this or pay your tithes are
[52:20] often without Christ you will go to hell
[52:22] is that right if you don't have that
[52:24] change in your life where that that soul
[52:27] that the master of your soul becomes
[52:29] Christ if you don't have that change
[52:30] there's no hope for you and I this
[52:32] evening so I don't care how you dress
[52:34] how you live how you do this if you
[52:36] don't have Christ
[52:37] on the inside it'll reflect on the
[52:39] outside a man you can fool people for so
[52:42] long but you can't fool him is that
[52:43] right in the end we've all got to stand
[52:46] we've got to stand for the life that
[52:48] we've lived a man do you love the Lord
[52:50] this evening so there for us by the
[52:53] offence of one judgment came upon all
[52:56] men to condemnation even so by the
[52:59] righteousness of one free gift came upon
[53:01] all men the justification of life for
[53:03] his by one man's disobedience many were
[53:06] made sinners so by the obedience of one
[53:08] shall many be made righteous are you
[53:11] thankful that in the garden he said let
[53:12] this pass if the cup could pass let it
[53:14] pass from me but he went to the cross
[53:16] knowing what he was gonna have to do
[53:18] knowing that our sin would be laid upon
[53:20] him and he went and made us righteous
[53:23] amen we took on his righteousness in the
[53:26] Indian Calvary
[53:27] moreover the law entered that the
[53:29] offence might be might abound but where
[53:31] sin abounded grace did much more abound
[53:33] are you thankful for that tonight now
[53:35] where sin was growing where sin was
[53:37] abounding grace come in and abounded
[53:39] greater than then sin could and that a
[53:42] sinneth reigned unto death even so might
[53:44] grace reign through the righteousness
[53:45] unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
[53:48] Lord are you thankful for that this
[53:50] evening that God would come down and Men
[53:52] and form himself in the flesh of Jesus
[53:54] Christ and and we see that Jesus went to
[53:57] the cross and died so that your and I
[53:58] sins would be placed back upon him and
[54:01] you and I could go free is that right
[54:03] you know many times in our life we don't
[54:05] you know when I begin to think about it
[54:08] sometimes I begin to say why would he
[54:09] pick me why would he do this and I think
[54:11] as Christians and as believers you know
[54:14] we need to quit you know we need to quit
[54:15] asking why if God put us here if God
[54:18] chose us he's going to see through see
[54:20] us through to the end is that right
[54:21] God's gonna see us through he's not only
[54:23] gonna see us through but he's going to
[54:24] equip us to make every trial every
[54:26] tribulation we go through God has
[54:28] prepared you to overcome at a man do you
[54:31] love the Lord just because we see people
[54:36] fall by the wayside we see this one do
[54:38] this we see that one do that doesn't
[54:40] mean that you and I are not living the
[54:41] right life is that right it doesn't take
[54:43] anything away from Christ
[54:44] it only takes away from that person and
[54:46] their experience wasn't real now the bad
[54:49] thing as Christians is us
[54:50] well they can't come back it's not up to
[54:53] you and I to say who can or who can it's
[54:55] up to God he for Dana before the world
[54:57] if God put a seed down in that life
[54:58] doesn't matter what they did if God's
[55:00] gonna bring them back he will bring them
[55:02] back amen
[55:03] so if you've got children and loved ones
[55:05] that are out in the world don't give up
[55:06] hope
[55:06] is that right if Christ placed something
[55:08] on the inside of their life it could be
[55:10] the last minute or the last second but
[55:12] God will bring them in do you believe
[55:13] that a man as Christians many times we
[55:16] don't have the right to pick you know
[55:18] and and we go out and look in if you
[55:20] went out and you just lined us all up
[55:21] before maybe we were saved or in church
[55:23] and you went to pick and you would
[55:25] probably pick the completely wrong
[55:26] people is that right you begin to go
[55:29] back and look at my life or anybody
[55:30] else's life you say well I wouldn't pick
[55:32] them I wouldn't pick them but that's not
[55:33] the way God chose he Ford ain't if you
[55:36] understand predestination there was no
[55:38] way Satan could have you well as brother
[55:40] branham says we were sold out in the
[55:41] pawn shop there was there's only one way
[55:44] we were gonna get back to Christ and
[55:45] that was him coming and dying and
[55:47] becoming a kinsman for you and I do you
[55:49] love the Lord this morning you know I've
[55:51] never looked and I think it was brother
[55:52] Ben that was preaching I never looked at
[55:54] at Ruth and Boaz that way and how Ruth
[55:56] and I loved how he put it you know she
[55:58] had everything she needed she was
[55:59] gleaning in the right field she was
[56:01] laying at his feet and and and she was
[56:03] she was having all the food she needs
[56:05] she had a place to live she had
[56:06] practically everything but there was a
[56:08] desire in her heart to become a wife is
[56:10] that right and you and I we've it's good
[56:13] to hear the message it's good to read
[56:14] the word but until that life comes on
[56:16] the inside until that changes made it
[56:18] it's it becomes a relationship that you
[56:21] just can't explain is that right
[56:23] brother branham says then the inside man
[56:25] he says his provided he's provided away
[56:27] like the brass serpent he's provided
[56:29] Jesus to meet all that we have need for
[56:31] while we're in this journey between
[56:33] heaven and earth I want to read that
[56:35] again
[56:35] he provided Jesus to meet all that we
[56:38] have need of for while we're in this
[56:40] journey between heaven and earth so we
[56:43] can't say that God didn't prepare us for
[56:45] this or dot God didn't give me enough
[56:46] didn't give me enough will or enough
[56:48] strength if God brought you into it
[56:50] he'll see you through amen he provided
[56:53] Jesus Christ he's God's all sufficient
[56:55] sacrifice and if you look at that word
[56:57] all sufficient it covers everything it
[56:59] means that he is enough anything that
[57:01] you have to go through that all
[57:03] sufficient sacrifice will
[57:04] ring you through it amen everything you
[57:07] have need of tonight it's not in your
[57:08] church it's in Christ he says there it
[57:11] is it's not in your education it's not
[57:12] in your theology or what your Creed is
[57:14] he said it's in Jesus Christ look to him
[57:17] with simple humble loving faith and say
[57:19] God cleanse me from my selfishness and
[57:22] take on my impurities from me and let me
[57:24] from this day be wholly thine he said
[57:26] see what God will do for you
[57:28] and I believe as Christians tonight any
[57:30] in my life and when I say you know what
[57:32] I'm preaching I'm preaching mainly to
[57:34] myself and from myself if there's
[57:36] anything I want to do it's not I don't
[57:37] want to become more knowledgeable I
[57:39] don't want to be able to able to out
[57:40] quote people I want to know him more
[57:43] day after day amen I love I love this I
[57:46] don't know who said it but I heard a
[57:47] preacher say it one time he says God
[57:49] didn't tear down Jericho to prove who he
[57:51] was he tore down Jericho to prove who
[57:53] Rahab was and so when we begin to see
[57:56] that that he wasn't trying to prove
[57:58] anything about himself but he was
[57:59] wanting to prove in this day in the
[58:01] seventh age and this time when it's the
[58:03] darkest hour he's one to prove who the
[58:05] bride is amen
[58:06] and you and I are living this life of
[58:09] Christ and if he's on the inside we
[58:11] won't fall away we won't fail we won't
[58:12] do that he will see us through to the
[58:14] end do you love the Lord and I asked
[58:18] that question a lot while I preached so
[58:20] just a simple reminder the answer is yes
[58:23] and if the answer is not yes we will
[58:26] pray for you there's a there's a God who
[58:29] can come and take all the hate all the
[58:30] bitterness all the anger everything
[58:32] you've got stored up and he can turn
[58:34] that into divine love amen do you love
[58:37] the Lord this evening Isaiah 45 and 21
[58:40] he says tell ye and bring them near yea
[58:42] he let them take counsel together who
[58:45] declared this from the ancient time who
[58:47] have told it from that time have not I
[58:49] the Lord and there is no God else beside
[58:51] me of just God and a savior there is
[58:53] none beside me look unto me and be you
[58:57] saved all you ends of the earth for I am
[58:59] God and there is none else do you
[59:00] believe that he said return that unto me
[59:03] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[59:05] shall swear he says surely shall one say
[59:07] in the Lord have I righteousness and
[59:09] strength even to him shall min come and
[59:12] all that are incensed against him shall
[59:15] be saved and so you know as Christians I
[59:17] think
[59:18] Abraham said you know the hardest thing
[59:19] God had to do was to get one mortal to
[59:21] believe another is that right and you
[59:23] know tonight you know I don't want you
[59:25] to believe me I don't want you to even
[59:26] maybe even listen to me or take
[59:28] everything I say for for a fact but you
[59:30] ought to take everything back to the
[59:32] word
[59:32] it's a Christians responsibility to take
[59:35] everything back to the Word of God is
[59:37] that right that and I promise you God
[59:40] will if God is the captain of your soul
[59:42] he will not lead you where you ought not
[59:44] to be you know just because you maybe
[59:46] don't understand the same thing that
[59:48] another person understands doesn't mean
[59:49] they're wrong and doesn't mean you're
[59:50] wrong you only can understand you can
[59:52] only see what God has allowed you to see
[59:55] but I promise if the desire in your
[59:56] heart is to see more God will show you
[59:58] more if your desire is to be closer to
[1:00:00] him then God will get you closer to him
[1:00:02] if your desires for your family to be
[1:00:05] stronger or something to happen in your
[1:00:06] family's life pray and ask God and
[1:00:09] believe that it shall come to pass a man
[1:00:12] but then God rich in mercy sent forth
[1:00:15] the Savior Jesus Christ he sent forth
[1:00:17] Jesus both Savior and healer for he said
[1:00:20] as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in
[1:00:22] the wilderness so must the Son of Man be
[1:00:23] lifted up for the same purpose and I
[1:00:26] love I want to focus it on that you know
[1:00:28] we look at the children of Israel and
[1:00:29] sometimes I just look at them and throw
[1:00:30] my hands up like they never learned and
[1:00:32] then I'm like well he said it's for the
[1:00:35] same purpose so maybe I don't ever learn
[1:00:36] as human being sometimes it's hard to
[1:00:39] get through our schools what is right is
[1:00:41] that right now we may not be doing the
[1:00:43] same thing the children of Israel did in
[1:00:45] in fullness but in part we begin to
[1:00:47] doubt is that right what a brother
[1:00:50] branham say sin was he said it's
[1:00:51] unbelief whenever you begin to unbeliev
[1:00:55] that God's gonna do something for you
[1:00:56] soon you know as soon as you get prayed
[1:00:57] for you got all this faith you were in
[1:00:59] this maybe maybe there was some some
[1:01:00] emotional emotional pull in the church
[1:01:03] and you believed it was gonna be done in
[1:01:04] the next day you don't have it you begin
[1:01:05] to doubt right away and you know God is
[1:01:09] looking down at us it's like well it's
[1:01:10] kind of like the children of Israel they
[1:01:11] they needed food God gave them food they
[1:01:13] needed water God gave him water and then
[1:01:15] all sudden they didn't like the food
[1:01:16] anymore they didn't like the water
[1:01:18] anymore
[1:01:18] and they began to murmur and complain
[1:01:19] and maybe we don't go to that same level
[1:01:22] but we ought to think as Christians
[1:01:23] sometimes what does God see when he
[1:01:25] looks back at us I know some of y'all to
[1:01:28] come up here and switch place with us
[1:01:29] one time and see what we're looking at
[1:01:31] you know you're looking at us we're
[1:01:32] looking at you and sometimes it's happy
[1:01:34] faces sometimes it's sleepy faces
[1:01:35] sometimes it's smiling faces you can see
[1:01:37] when people are engaged or see when
[1:01:39] people are disengaged and so many times
[1:01:41] we look at God and and in your we want
[1:01:44] to see what God sees in our life and and
[1:01:46] and I want you to know something as
[1:01:48] Christians if if you've got a question
[1:01:50] in your life or you've got something
[1:01:52] that you don't feel right about go to
[1:01:54] Christ about it come to the altar pray
[1:01:56] pray it through this is the most
[1:01:58] important thing in our life is that
[1:01:59] right you know many people say well this
[1:02:02] is my eternal destination and we don't
[1:02:03] really put much focus on it right we put
[1:02:06] all of our focus and efforts into these
[1:02:08] things but this is our eternal life our
[1:02:10] Redemption all everything all the
[1:02:12] culmination of everything we've done in
[1:02:13] our life should come to this this
[1:02:15] doorway where we transfer into eternal
[1:02:18] life you know if you look at the space
[1:02:20] if somebody lives a hundred years old
[1:02:21] and you compare that to eternal life
[1:02:23] it's not even a you know you can't
[1:02:25] actually compare it it's infinity you
[1:02:27] can't actually you can't comprehend it
[1:02:29] in the human mind and Matney always
[1:02:31] asked me all the time you know I'll say
[1:02:32] I love you he says well I love you
[1:02:33] infinity that's the biggest number in
[1:02:35] the world you know say well how big is
[1:02:37] infinity I'm like well there's really
[1:02:39] not a number just zeros just continue on
[1:02:41] forever and ever and he's like so
[1:02:43] there's not a number I'm like well there
[1:02:44] is a number but it just continues on
[1:02:45] forever and ever and every weekend the
[1:02:47] human mind cannot comprehend it and he
[1:02:50] can't comprehend what I'm trying to
[1:02:51] explain to him I believe it was Einstein
[1:02:53] said if you couldn't explain to a fourth
[1:02:55] grader what you thought you knew then
[1:02:58] you really don't understand it and
[1:03:01] sometimes we got people trying to
[1:03:03] explain things to other people you know
[1:03:07] we want to explain this or explain why
[1:03:09] we do this or explain why we do that I
[1:03:11] promise you if you can get somebody to
[1:03:13] Christ everything will make sense amen
[1:03:15] if we can get them to the fountain if
[1:03:17] they can taste of that fountain they'll
[1:03:19] thirst no more is that right when Jesus
[1:03:21] come to the woman of Samaria he wasn't
[1:03:22] trying to explain anything wasn't trying
[1:03:24] to do this he just said hey you are you
[1:03:26] thirsty and he begin to tell her about
[1:03:27] her life and and so as Christians we
[1:03:29] ought to be that we ought to be that
[1:03:31] water and we I think brother Branham
[1:03:33] said it the best he said you know we're
[1:03:34] his hands wears physical hands were his
[1:03:36] feet were his voice in this day he says
[1:03:39] but God he said but God rich in mercy
[1:03:41] says he says as Moses lifted up the
[1:03:43] brass serpent in the wilderness so
[1:03:45] must the Son of Man be lifted up for the
[1:03:46] same purpose he the atonement that what
[1:03:49] we have claimed upon nothing but the
[1:03:51] atonement he said what Jesus purchased
[1:03:53] by his blood that's what we have claims
[1:03:55] upon and the Bible said he was wounded
[1:03:57] for our transgression he was bruised for
[1:03:59] our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:04:00] peace was upon him and with His stripes
[1:04:02] we are healed and that's what we can
[1:04:04] claim because that's what the atonement
[1:04:06] that's what's what we stand for he says
[1:04:10] we're healed that's what we can claim he
[1:04:12] says that's what God ordered for us God
[1:04:15] rich in mercy he says this was to be an
[1:04:17] eternal atonement he says because he
[1:04:20] came himself and God came himself in the
[1:04:22] form of sinful flesh an eternal
[1:04:24] atonement and he suffered in flesh and
[1:04:27] made the atonement and returned back in
[1:04:29] the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm
[1:04:31] that atonement he said we're no brass
[1:04:33] serpent or troubled water could do it
[1:04:35] all pointed to the perfect atonement God
[1:04:37] rich in mercy has did this thing so we
[1:04:41] see that when God did this thing it
[1:04:42] wasn't to point to you and I are point
[1:04:44] to a man but it was point to Christ is
[1:04:46] that right look and live upon him is
[1:04:48] that right if we're looking at anything
[1:04:50] else besides Christ we're looking at the
[1:04:52] wrong thing we've got to look and live
[1:04:55] hey man do you love the Lord this
[1:04:57] evening as Christians we've got one goal
[1:04:59] and that's to finish this race is that
[1:05:01] right it's a hard race we get
[1:05:03] discouraged we get downhearted we get
[1:05:05] downtrodden but if God be for us who can
[1:05:08] be against us this evening in this evil
[1:05:10] age in the darkest hour the light will
[1:05:13] shine the brightest is that right I
[1:05:15] preached a sermon one time what are we
[1:05:16] preparing for it's preparing for a
[1:05:18] rapture and and many times in our life
[1:05:20] we prepare to come to church on Sunday
[1:05:22] and we prepare to come to church on
[1:05:23] Wednesday but as Christians I remember
[1:05:25] when I was a young kid when every day I
[1:05:27] thought the rapture was going to happen
[1:05:28] that's how much the focus was on every
[1:05:31] dot when I went to bed I didn't think I
[1:05:33] was going to wake up because I thought
[1:05:34] the rapture was going to happen
[1:05:36] and I feel like his Christians we've
[1:05:37] kind of gotten away from that we've kind
[1:05:39] of gotten away from thinking the rapture
[1:05:41] could happen the next day amen but as
[1:05:43] Christians we ought to focus on praying
[1:05:46] that the rapture takes place the next
[1:05:47] day and preparing ourselves we know
[1:05:50] brother Branham said hey pack your lunch
[1:05:51] do your things keep going on about your
[1:05:53] daily lives but are we preparing for a
[1:05:55] rapture anymore are we looking for that
[1:05:57] rapture
[1:05:58] to actually be tomorrow morning or order
[1:06:00] this evening whatever we're looking are
[1:06:02] we looking for a rapture to come job 16
[1:06:05] and 19 says also now behold my witnesses
[1:06:08] in heaven and my record is on high I'm
[1:06:10] so thankful that he didn't need me to be
[1:06:12] a witness he didn't call me to to stand
[1:06:15] in my own place and plead my case but he
[1:06:18] pled my case is that right he pled
[1:06:20] you're in our case that when the enemy
[1:06:21] come in and put all this evidence
[1:06:23] against you and I
[1:06:24] I love how brother Branham puts it he
[1:06:26] says he takes you know when the Son of
[1:06:27] God is on the other side of that chasm I
[1:06:30] love how he says the Son of God comes
[1:06:32] back onto the the right side of the
[1:06:33] chasm with Christ but I also love
[1:06:36] focusing on the point where he says and
[1:06:37] all that sin that was on that son of God
[1:06:40] was laid back on the accuser so he
[1:06:42] becomes the guilty one is that right
[1:06:44] that all the things that Satan made you
[1:06:46] do wrong all the things that that sin
[1:06:48] brought into the picture is all laid
[1:06:50] back on the responsible party which is
[1:06:52] Satan is that right and you and I go
[1:06:54] free he said behold my witnesses in
[1:06:57] heaven and my record is on high and
[1:06:59] brother branham says in divine love he
[1:07:00] says and I know only he says I only know
[1:07:02] one thing here it is he says I want you
[1:07:04] to hear it
[1:07:05] there's only one thing that will conquer
[1:07:07] the devil and that's pure divine love
[1:07:08] love will conquer everything he said God
[1:07:12] so loved the world it conquered the sin
[1:07:13] question it conquered the sickness
[1:07:15] question it'll conquer the difference in
[1:07:17] the church it'll conquer everything
[1:07:19] there is unlike it to be conquered he
[1:07:22] says it'll do it if you'll just let it
[1:07:24] do it and that's one thing I found out
[1:07:26] as a husband and a father if I come into
[1:07:28] a situation where there's trouble and I
[1:07:30] bring more trouble and more stress to
[1:07:31] the situation guess what it only gets
[1:07:34] worse you know many times we think well
[1:07:36] you know Pete the kids are mad if I
[1:07:38] bring my anger into it it will fix it
[1:07:39] but it doesn't really make sense is that
[1:07:41] right that's like saying well I'm gonna
[1:07:43] put this fire out with gasoline I'm
[1:07:45] gonna throw more on it but no if we look
[1:07:48] at the Word of God divine love when you
[1:07:51] can truly say you love someone when you
[1:07:53] disagree with someone when whenever they
[1:07:55] whatever they may be done wrong against
[1:07:56] you but you can look at them and forgive
[1:07:58] them that's the kind of love we have to
[1:08:00] get to amen
[1:08:01] and that's the divine love that Christ
[1:08:03] represented when they pulled his beard
[1:08:05] when they slapped him when they called
[1:08:06] him names he's reviled not as that right
[1:08:10] do you love the Lord this evening a man
[1:08:13] I told you is gonna be very simple and
[1:08:14] not very much longer so just just hang
[1:08:16] in with me and we'll we'll finish it up
[1:08:18] a man when I get to preaching on the
[1:08:23] atonement and forgiveness and all the
[1:08:25] things that the devil did and I can
[1:08:26] place it back on him and it just kind of
[1:08:28] gets me excited a little bit a man that
[1:08:30] that everything that he tricked me into
[1:08:32] do it and everything that I did wrong it
[1:08:34] all goes back to him you know I can I
[1:08:35] get a little bit excited about that amen
[1:08:38] you know my little boy asked me the
[1:08:41] other day says what's the difference in
[1:08:42] a trick in a lie that's a hard question
[1:08:46] to answer for a kid you know but it is
[1:08:49] true the devil he tricked us into doing
[1:08:51] this that's what brother Branham said he
[1:08:52] tricked us into doing this and and I
[1:08:54] believe as people we ought to have maybe
[1:08:56] you know we ought to be mature enough to
[1:08:59] know that that this isn't a law to say
[1:09:02] oh God's gonna forgive us of everything
[1:09:03] he's wiped everything away this is not a
[1:09:05] freedom to sin if anybody looks at the
[1:09:07] Word of God and and looks at grace and
[1:09:09] say this is a freedom to sin they don't
[1:09:10] have Christ on the inside when when you
[1:09:13] begin to love love him and and you begin
[1:09:16] to love the things that he loves and you
[1:09:18] begin to love the word that he's put
[1:09:19] forward because that life on the inside
[1:09:21] can only reflect what's on the inside is
[1:09:23] that right and so whenever you see
[1:09:25] somebody say well this is a freedom to
[1:09:27] sin when you hear me preach it on grace
[1:09:28] and maybe I focused more on grace than I
[1:09:30] do the law but you know when I preach it
[1:09:32] on grace that it's not a freedom to sin
[1:09:34] if you if you look at it that way you
[1:09:35] need to get right with God is that right
[1:09:37] anybody who looks for a way to find
[1:09:39] freedom to sin needs to get right with
[1:09:41] God I may not believe everything that
[1:09:42] you believe or see everything that you
[1:09:44] are understand but but I know one thing
[1:09:46] that if you were living like Christ
[1:09:48] it'll reflect on the outward man amen he
[1:09:51] said and there shall be a great cry and
[1:09:53] excuse me Exodus 11 and verse 6 and I
[1:09:56] just like to look at this for a few
[1:09:57] moments and and there should be a great
[1:09:59] cry throughout all the land of Egypt
[1:10:02] such as there was none like it nor shall
[1:10:04] it be like any more but against the
[1:10:06] children of Israel shall not a dog move
[1:10:08] his tongue any against man or beast that
[1:10:11] you may know that the Lord does put a
[1:10:13] difference between the Egyptians in
[1:10:15] Israel and I love that little phrase
[1:10:17] he's put a difference
[1:10:19] he put a difference in our life in the
[1:10:21] world's life is that right he puts
[1:10:23] then he put something different into us
[1:10:25] sometimes we say we're a little
[1:10:26] different but God put a difference in
[1:10:28] between you and us and the world is that
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:31] he placed something in our lives that
[1:10:33] maybe we can't comprehend or understand
[1:10:35] at times but he put a difference that we
[1:10:37] could serve him in this evil age when
[1:10:39] all the world is going crazy when when
[1:10:41] everything seems to be going wrong and
[1:10:43] spun out of control we know that we have
[1:10:45] a father a man that knows the number of
[1:10:47] hairs upon our head then he will see us
[1:10:49] through until the rapture amen John 9
[1:10:53] and verse 24 then again they called the
[1:10:55] man that was blind and said to him give
[1:10:57] God praise we know that this man is a
[1:10:59] sinner and he answered and said whether
[1:11:01] he be a sinner or no I know not one
[1:11:04] thing I know that whereas I was blind I
[1:11:06] now see him I'll give a little backstory
[1:11:08] to this in John chapter 9 you see that
[1:11:10] Jesus and the disciples are coming down
[1:11:12] through the streets and they come upon a
[1:11:13] blind man and and the disciples asked
[1:11:16] Jesus a question and said who sinned
[1:11:17] this man or his father is that writer
[1:11:19] you go back and read the whole story in
[1:11:21] John chapter 9 they said who sinned this
[1:11:23] man or his father and I love how Jesus
[1:11:25] said neither this man sinned nor his
[1:11:26] father or his parents he said but he was
[1:11:29] made blind so that the works of God
[1:11:30] might be made manifest in his life and
[1:11:33] you begin to look at the store and you
[1:11:34] read all the way down through it and we
[1:11:36] realized that this man was blind from
[1:11:38] birth just so God could do a miracle in
[1:11:40] his life and I always go back to this
[1:11:43] when I'm going through something I don't
[1:11:44] understand I go back to this scripture I
[1:11:46] say hey this is just so God can perform
[1:11:48] a miracle in my life amen
[1:11:50] if you don't understand what you're
[1:11:52] going through you don't know why this
[1:11:53] has happened or what's going on around
[1:11:55] you just know God's working a miracle to
[1:11:57] see you through to the other side and we
[1:11:59] see the Pharisees got mad that jesus
[1:12:01] healed him on the Sabbath they come to
[1:12:03] him and they were mad Nate they come to
[1:12:05] the son and they said hey we you've got
[1:12:08] to reject this he's a sinner he says he
[1:12:10] says I don't know what to do so they go
[1:12:12] to his parents and to confirm that he
[1:12:13] was blind from birth and then they want
[1:12:15] the parents to do something about their
[1:12:17] like hey he's a v's of age let him speak
[1:12:19] you know the parents are afraid of the
[1:12:20] Pharisees let the boy speak and I love
[1:12:23] this phrase he says hey I don't know if
[1:12:25] he's a sinner or not but one thing I
[1:12:26] know that whereas I was blind I now see
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:30] you may not be able to say I don't know
[1:12:31] why
[1:12:32] used to do the things I did not don't
[1:12:33] anymore but whereas once I was blind I
[1:12:35] now can see Amen it's not up to you and
[1:12:38] I to choose who's gonna make it and
[1:12:40] who's not gonna make it but if they were
[1:12:41] once blinding God opened their eyes they
[1:12:43] will see Amen
[1:12:45] he said the Christian experience is
[1:12:47] based solemnly and wholly upon rest he
[1:12:49] says come unto me all ye that are heavy
[1:12:51] there heavy laden and I will give you
[1:12:53] rest he says we're tossed about with
[1:12:56] everything until you come to Christ and
[1:12:58] then it's all finished
[1:12:59] resting in Christ perfectly says no
[1:13:01] matter what comes or go nothing can
[1:13:03] touch us without it comes over the
[1:13:05] Shepherd he has to permit it the Bible
[1:13:08] said all things work together for the
[1:13:09] good to them that love the Lord he has
[1:13:12] to come over the Shepherd first he said
[1:13:14] I'm the door and no man can come in
[1:13:16] without me excepting he says let me let
[1:13:18] me tell you that when God permits
[1:13:20] anything it's working - you're good
[1:13:21] let's focus on that sentence because we
[1:13:24] heard all this God doesn't let anything
[1:13:25] bad or didn't let anything come through
[1:13:27] he says when something happens to you
[1:13:28] God's working it for your good do you
[1:13:30] believe that he said so what sickness be
[1:13:32] the same thing he said certainly that
[1:13:35] God might heal you just to show a great
[1:13:37] testimony give you a little something to
[1:13:39] move on for he said all things work
[1:13:41] together for their good we see that God
[1:13:43] uses us in his life and you know God
[1:13:46] can't show a miracle unless something
[1:13:47] happens that needs a miracle is that
[1:13:48] right we all want healing but if you
[1:13:51] want healed you got to get sick first if
[1:13:52] you want a miracle in your life you got
[1:13:54] to go through the struggles and the
[1:13:55] trials to get that miracle amen
[1:13:57] I remember when I was a young kid I
[1:13:59] always wanted to seek I want to always
[1:14:00] want a God to talk to me
[1:14:01] I always wanted to hear inaudible voice
[1:14:03] I always needed something to move me to
[1:14:04] the altar you know God speak to me and
[1:14:06] tell me it's my time to go and and you
[1:14:08] know I was always focused on the signs
[1:14:10] and you know and then that type of thing
[1:14:12] and you know I begin to come to a point
[1:14:14] where you know I really wanted it and
[1:14:16] you know I heard someone you know preach
[1:14:19] on desires one time and and and check
[1:14:21] your desires to see what's really in
[1:14:23] your heart and and you know God
[1:14:24] beginning to move on my life and and I
[1:14:26] believe as Christians you know many
[1:14:28] times we still need to go back and check
[1:14:29] our desires what is our desire to be
[1:14:31] what is our desire for our families and
[1:14:33] this and we can see that if your desire
[1:14:34] is to be more like Christ is to be a
[1:14:36] Christian then we know that that's the
[1:14:38] right thing is that right
[1:14:40] but if our desires are to focus on the
[1:14:41] world and do these these things and this
[1:14:43] and that then we know we need to get
[1:14:45] right
[1:14:45] God we need to check ourselves is that
[1:14:47] right now in Genesis 50 and verse 15 and
[1:14:52] I just want to read on this just real
[1:14:54] quick before we close and I may not get
[1:14:57] to everything but and when Joseph's
[1:14:59] brethren saw their father was dead they
[1:15:01] said Joseph / / venture hate us and will
[1:15:05] certainly require all the evil which we
[1:15:08] did unto Him and they sent a messenger
[1:15:09] unto Joseph saying my father did command
[1:15:12] before he died saying so shall you
[1:15:13] saying to Joseph's forgive I pray thee
[1:15:15] now the trespass of thy brethren and
[1:15:18] their sin for they did under the evil
[1:15:20] and now we pray thee forgive the
[1:15:22] trespass of thy servants of God and of
[1:15:25] the Father and Joseph wept when he spake
[1:15:27] to them and so we see that the the
[1:15:32] brothers that had done Joseph's wrong
[1:15:34] are now afraid that now that their
[1:15:35] father's dead Joseph's gonna come back
[1:15:37] and and do bad things and what we would
[1:15:41] call revenge is that right and uh you
[1:15:44] know I'm go ahead and tell you in your
[1:15:45] life if you have a problem with revenge
[1:15:47] or bitterness or when something happens
[1:15:50] to somebody that's bad and you get
[1:15:51] excited and say they deserve that you're
[1:15:53] probably not right yourself and I'm just
[1:15:56] gonna call it like it is if you're happy
[1:15:57] to see somebody fall or or mess up you
[1:16:00] need to get saved a man is that right a
[1:16:03] man I'll say it again if you like to see
[1:16:05] people get in trouble or fall you need
[1:16:07] to get saved
[1:16:08] I'll put it plain and simple I think the
[1:16:11] Bible says you know if you say you love
[1:16:12] God but love not your brother you were a
[1:16:14] liar that's about as plain and simple as
[1:16:17] I can put it if you say you love God but
[1:16:18] don't love your brother you're a liar so
[1:16:20] we see here tonight that Joseph you know
[1:16:24] they send this letter to Joseph because
[1:16:25] they're like he's gonna remember all the
[1:16:27] bad things we did to him and Joseph and
[1:16:30] Joseph wept when they spake unto him and
[1:16:32] his brethren also went and fell down
[1:16:34] before his face and they said Behold we
[1:16:36] be thy servants and Joseph said having
[1:16:38] them fear not for I'm in the place of
[1:16:40] God and he's saying that as a question
[1:16:42] he says but as for you he thought evil
[1:16:45] against me but God meant it unto good he
[1:16:47] said to bring to pass as it is the day
[1:16:49] to save much people alive now therefore
[1:16:52] fear ye not I will nourish you and your
[1:16:55] little ones and be comforted and he
[1:16:57] comforted them and spoke calmly
[1:16:58] unto them and so as Christians this is
[1:17:01] you know as Joseph is typing Christ in
[1:17:04] many ways we see that if somebody did
[1:17:06] wrong to us if somebody wronged us and
[1:17:08] somebody did wrong you know to us we
[1:17:11] ought not to go back to and perform evil
[1:17:13] upon those people is that right
[1:17:15] I believe brother Branham says that's a
[1:17:17] God power when you can return good for
[1:17:18] evil is that right
[1:17:20] he said now if you're a prophet tell us
[1:17:22] who you are he said who hit you and will
[1:17:24] believe you he could have done it but he
[1:17:26] said I'll just do it as the father shows
[1:17:28] me what was it he always believed and
[1:17:31] let me stop right there because I want
[1:17:32] to make sure I get this point across now
[1:17:34] somebody continually does evil against
[1:17:36] you you should separate yourself from
[1:17:37] that person right if someone you know if
[1:17:39] you if somebody does evil against you
[1:17:41] and you forgive them they come back and
[1:17:42] do evil again and you forgiving
[1:17:44] they come back and do evil again there's
[1:17:45] a point where you've got to say hey
[1:17:46] listen I love you but you gotta move on
[1:17:49] right you know you're messing with my
[1:17:51] life you're messing with with you know
[1:17:53] the what we would say today good vibes
[1:17:55] were here you're messing up everything
[1:17:57] you're kind of hindering everything in
[1:17:59] my life and there's a point you've got
[1:18:01] to say that to some people and and you
[1:18:03] know so I want to make sure that's clear
[1:18:05] not we should just go out and say oh you
[1:18:06] know you did me so wrong I'm so sorry I
[1:18:09] forgive you not that we're not that
[1:18:10] we're bowing down to people or not that
[1:18:12] we're just just becoming wimps or not
[1:18:14] standing up for what we believe in but
[1:18:16] there's got to come a point when we love
[1:18:17] those people enough to not hold it
[1:18:19] against them amen
[1:18:20] I love the quote it says bitterness is
[1:18:23] like taking poison and expecting the
[1:18:25] other person to die and that's the thing
[1:18:28] that bitterness will do to you you you
[1:18:30] you are bitter in yourself at someone
[1:18:32] else and you you you look at them and
[1:18:34] you take the poison and expect them to
[1:18:35] be the ones that get sick from it that's
[1:18:37] not the way it works hey man do you love
[1:18:39] the Lord I got way off topic there for a
[1:18:41] few minutes but whoever that was for
[1:18:43] there you go how could Satan say that
[1:18:45] that man could be God and man that could
[1:18:48] take the challenge of a priest and let a
[1:18:50] drunken soldier spit in his face and
[1:18:52] today we got the wrong conception of
[1:18:54] power power is overcoming and returning
[1:18:58] good for evil says that's real power he
[1:19:00] says that you can love your enemy and do
[1:19:02] good for those that do evil to you
[1:19:03] that's real power that's God Perry says
[1:19:06] yes maniacs can break change but it
[1:19:08] takes a real man to return good from
[1:19:10] evil from his heart not because of
[1:19:12] religious duty but from his heart and
[1:19:14] I'm not saying this is a freedom to let
[1:19:16] everybody do what they want to do and we
[1:19:18] just forgive them and go on that's not
[1:19:19] what I'm saying but if somebody does
[1:19:21] does evil upon you you can return good
[1:19:24] for evil is that right now brother
[1:19:27] Branham says in the salutation in
[1:19:28] Revelation 2 and 8 he says these things
[1:19:30] saith the first and last which was dead
[1:19:32] and is alive the first and last which
[1:19:34] was dead and is alive now there are not
[1:19:37] the words of these are not the words of
[1:19:38] man a mere man could he speak from the
[1:19:41] grave would say I'm the first and the
[1:19:43] last which was alive and is dead he said
[1:19:46] the first thing that happens to a man
[1:19:47] that that when he's born he's alive and
[1:19:50] the last thing that happens is that he
[1:19:52] dies so this man is not speaking he says
[1:19:54] this is not a man speaking this is deity
[1:19:56] man Adam he said took life and turned it
[1:19:59] into death but this man Jesus took death
[1:20:02] and turned it into life Adam took
[1:20:05] innocent and turn it into guilt this one
[1:20:07] took guilt and turned it into
[1:20:09] righteousness are you thankful for that
[1:20:10] tonight that all the guilt that was
[1:20:12] placed upon you and I he changed it out
[1:20:15] for righteousness amen he said Adam took
[1:20:17] paradise and turned it into a waste
[1:20:19] howling wilderness but this one is
[1:20:21] coming back to turn and earth rocking
[1:20:23] and reeling and with destruction into
[1:20:25] another Eden are you looking forward to
[1:20:26] that day he said Adam took a life of
[1:20:29] fellowship and joy with God and turned
[1:20:30] it into a desert of spiritual darkness
[1:20:32] that brought forth all sin moral decay
[1:20:35] pain suffering delusion and corruption
[1:20:38] that wars within the soul of man but
[1:20:40] this one from all the tragic death and
[1:20:42] degradation and that fueled all mankind
[1:20:45] brought forth a life of righteousness
[1:20:47] and beauty so that a sin once reigned
[1:20:49] unto death even so men now reign in
[1:20:52] righteousness by one Christ Jesus not as
[1:20:55] the offence was though terrible indeed
[1:20:57] it was but now much more his is his gift
[1:21:01] unto eternal life so we see what Christ
[1:21:03] did for you and I we see what laid
[1:21:06] within that atonement that when we
[1:21:07] looked and lived we had that ability to
[1:21:09] claim our healing in that our salvation
[1:21:11] was in that there's so many things in
[1:21:13] the atonement that you and I all we have
[1:21:15] to do is look and live do you believe
[1:21:17] that tonight I believe many times as
[1:21:20] Christian we try to make it too
[1:21:22] difficult we try to make it too hard for
[1:21:23] us to come in or for our children or for
[1:21:25] others if God ever gets ahold of
[1:21:27] somebody he won't let him go I can
[1:21:29] promise you that is that right we see
[1:21:32] that when God wants to deal with a
[1:21:33] person he will come down and he will he
[1:21:35] will speak in such a way that that
[1:21:36] person will know that it is him many
[1:21:38] times you hear different ministers come
[1:21:40] and speak and brother Ben will be able
[1:21:42] to reach people that I'll never be able
[1:21:43] to reach and brother Stuart will be able
[1:21:44] to reach people that we could never
[1:21:46] reach and you see God has different
[1:21:48] gifts in different callings that will
[1:21:49] come to people and they can speak
[1:21:51] directly not that the man speaking but
[1:21:53] that God is speaking to his children in
[1:21:55] such a way that they know that he's
[1:21:56] speaking right to them amen are you
[1:21:59] thankful for that you know I remember
[1:22:01] when I was kind of trying to trying to
[1:22:03] get my life right with God I would say
[1:22:05] God speak to me and then he would you
[1:22:07] know the minister would come up and and
[1:22:08] God would speak to me and tell me all
[1:22:10] the things I was doing wrong and how I
[1:22:12] needed a change is like okay maybe we
[1:22:13] don't need to speak that much but you
[1:22:15] know as a Christian your desires to hear
[1:22:17] from God is that right and God's gonna
[1:22:19] get you back in line and this isn't
[1:22:20] something you can just fix overnight you
[1:22:23] know I always thought that with my
[1:22:24] children I thought I could just turn
[1:22:25] them into responsible mature adults
[1:22:27] overnight I have found out greatly that
[1:22:30] is impossible to do it didn't happen
[1:22:33] with me it won't happen with them it
[1:22:35] didn't happen with my wife you know I'm
[1:22:38] still maturing
[1:22:39] I'm 32 I'll be honest my wife still has
[1:22:42] to get on to me sometimes you know
[1:22:44] sometimes me and the kids we get out on
[1:22:45] the floor and wrestle I'm a big kid but
[1:22:47] we're all not gonna change just like
[1:22:49] this and I think as Christians that's
[1:22:51] what we want to see is just I want them
[1:22:52] to be perfect right now
[1:22:54] that's when the body change happens when
[1:22:56] we become perfect when we see him as he
[1:22:59] is because we will be like him amen
[1:23:01] that's when the body change happens and
[1:23:03] you and I become just like he is but
[1:23:05] until then we ought not to point out
[1:23:07] everybody's faults and point this out
[1:23:08] and point that out but we ought to love
[1:23:10] one another and pray for one another
[1:23:11] that we would all come to the fullness
[1:23:13] of God as that right that we would all
[1:23:15] come to that rapture and preparedness
[1:23:17] that we're ready to take a rapture hey
[1:23:19] Mandy love the Lord this evening as the
[1:23:21] musicians would go ahead and come but we
[1:23:24] see that if God has called us he's also
[1:23:26] equipped us to see us through to the end
[1:23:29] and I love that you know you look it you
[1:23:32] looked down through the Bible and you
[1:23:33] look at all the heroes of faith and all
[1:23:35] the people that were that were there may
[1:23:37] be used as examples in the Bible I would
[1:23:39] not picked any of those people you know
[1:23:41] I wouldn't have picked Abraham I
[1:23:42] wouldn't have picked Rahab I wouldn't
[1:23:44] have picked the woman at the well I
[1:23:45] wouldn't have picked the maniac in the
[1:23:47] in the graveyard we wouldn't have picked
[1:23:48] these people and and I think we ought to
[1:23:50] go and look and say you know I wouldn't
[1:23:52] have picked myself right you know I
[1:23:54] wouldn't have come down if I was just
[1:23:55] being an on a non-biased judge I
[1:23:57] wouldn't have picked me I probably
[1:23:59] wouldn't have picked brother Ben I
[1:24:00] wouldn't have picked Joel with a big day
[1:24:01] but I would have picked any of y'all but
[1:24:03] God knew who would see through to the
[1:24:06] end is that right God knew when he
[1:24:07] placed his seed out there by
[1:24:09] predestination by foreknowledge he knew
[1:24:11] who would follow him is that right and
[1:24:13] whenever you come to Christ and that
[1:24:15] seeds on the inside no matter if you
[1:24:16] fall you're gonna make mistakes you're
[1:24:18] gonna have trials along the way things
[1:24:20] are gonna come up that you don't know
[1:24:21] how to fix things are gonna happen that
[1:24:23] you don't understand but if you've got
[1:24:25] that seed gene on the inside God will
[1:24:27] see you through to the end amen do you
[1:24:29] believe that hey man do you love the
[1:24:31] Lord this evening a man I truly believe
[1:24:34] that if God has called us he's equipped
[1:24:36] us he's prepared us and and you know he
[1:24:38] doesn't just throw us out and just to
[1:24:40] see what happens he's gonna see us
[1:24:42] through to the end day man if we could
[1:24:44] let's just sing that song at Calvary a
[1:24:48] man he loved the Lord this evening
