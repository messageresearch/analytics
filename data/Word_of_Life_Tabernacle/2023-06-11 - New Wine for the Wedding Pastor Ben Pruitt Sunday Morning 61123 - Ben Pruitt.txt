========================================

good and many things many other reasons why that they would have had wine there at the wedding it was important it was a hot hot climate and it was mostly Outdoors that they would have this celebration and so it was very very important and it was but it was most important like you could survive it but it's most important for the attitude of the guests right for the happiness of the guests so if you think about it now if there's going to be a wedding going on the guest in order for the wedding to be what it should be the guest ought to be in the right attitude it's good no all right we've all been there where there was somebody disgruntled at the wedding I I remember our wedding and and I had some disgruntled family members not because of who I was married but they were fighting amongst themselves and and uh and some of our pictures are really curious because you've got very happy people and very mad people in the same picture and some of y'all maybe have had intended weddings like that and been like that and and uh and and so there had to be something to keep the attitude of the guests in in their proper place and I'll say Jesus is always on time to help us to make sure that we're where we're supposed to be even in our attitudes Even in our worship Even in our the Revival there's a moments he's always on time to do that brother Joe when we need him yeah do you believe that today amen so here at the evening time he didn't just he didn't just have a wedding now they could have had the wedding without the wine but it would have been a little bit sour a little bit grumpy people be a little disappointed now listen God could have come in this age he could have come and had the wedding and not sit and not poured out his Spirit come on not had any Revival right not having you could just sit there and I could teach you the message you could all sit there like bumps on a log and we could sit there and say well bless the Lord we're being married to Christ the lord we're being united and we could just all have like a classroom setting and a chalkboard we could do that but he cares about Oh my he cares about our attitude he cares about our faith level he cares about the Revival Among Us he wants us to be he wants us to worship him he wants us to he wants us to honor him in the way that we treat each other and everything else and so what does he do he provides wine at the wedding at the end time amen Hallelujah so now so the wine had run out and when they wanted wine or when they were out the mother of Jesus saith unto him they have no wine that's an interesting thing to say she knew who he was now this was a crisis again for that family at that time it's not like they'd go down to the store and buy a canned soda there wasn't any anywhere they could go the wine running out was a big deal yeah but their guest enjoyment at the wedding depended on the wine you could say it this way that the line was the life of the wedding now we know that Satan has always tried to control the spiritual life of the church he's always done that he tries to do that today he probably did that to you this morning or tried to he's always trying to dampen your spiritual enthusiasm for the word come on now that's his job you take a person will be on fire one day and excited and happy and the next day they start to back up and back up and usually because well there's something going on there's something troubling that person why would they why would that happen like that it's because Satan is trying to maybe he'll make you think well you're too emotional you're you you say too much in church and maybe you ought to sit quietly like everybody else and but what he's doing he's trying to dampen your enthusiasm for the word and he does that to all of us every day he does it he tries to get us where we won't speak out and we won't do we won't testify we won't come to church because we well it's just it's just not enjoyable anymore he wants to control the spiritual atmosphere but at times I think it's time we took Satan's hands off the thermostat and put a lock box on of the Holy Ghost and control the Atmosphere by the Holy Spirit to letting Satan do it Revelation six and five is how he did it in the dark ages in the opening of the third seal he said I heard the third Beast say come and see and I'll be held in lower Black Horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny the three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil in the wine the Antichrist Spirit now listen to me church this is important this morning for all of us as a local church body this Antichrist Spirit had made Church a transaction that made the church service a transaction they made the sacraments a transaction legalism makes church and makes the your spiritual life a transaction something for something the Latin saying is quid pro quo which means something for something something for something this for that well if I go to church maybe maybe God will heal me man if I if I go to church maybe I won't be judged if I get baptized maybe I won't go to hell it's transactional right it's a pair of balances it's legalism and the Catholic church was the inventor of that right they're the ones that said well if you pay this much you'll get your soul out of hell out of purgatory and John pitzel walks around in that in that age in Martin Luther's time and he walked around selling indulgences to put up a cathedral in Rome and he said this as soon as the gold and the casket Rings the rescued soul to Heaven Springs transaction if you've ever seen the Martin Luther movie the one the Lutheran Church put out maybe 50 years ago I'll never forget that Martin Luther walks down the alleyway and here's an old drunk you know that I've been trying to do better and he's out there just as drunk as can be he said he said why are you acting like this he said didn't you know he said I'm free man I'm clear I can do whatever I want to said I paid my Indulgence I put my money in the Box oh my but don't you realize that when we try to reduce church when we try to reduce the gospel and we try to reduce the message to legalism it does the same thing it becomes a transaction because I pay my tithes then I can maybe I can come to church and feel good about myself no it's not a transaction I don't deserve one bit of his love I don't deserve one ounce of his Mercy I don't deserve any of his presence coming down on me so when he comes I'm going to worship him I'm going to praise him because I didn't do anything to earn it I don't have I'm not sitting here with a pair of balances weighing your works to see whether you get spiritual favors buddy yes sir he said his balances where scales was in his hands see what they did is they took the joy and spiritual life of the people and based it on on what they could do for the church instead of the finished work of Christ at Calvary oh my now look he said he's balances and scales his hand you see calling out a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is wheat and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff is made from but you see he was charging for this what it means he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was sending out to them just give them a glimmer of hope well maybe you might make it if you get up in front of the church and confess all your wrongs and and make sure that you just do everything just right that's nonsense most things there are some things need to be confessed in front of the church but most things you need to confess to God and then you need to come and worship you need to come to the house of God and get some freedom in your heart and in your soul and begin to worship God right that's good hey we should never judge anyone for worshiping come on I don't care what they've been through what they've done where they've been what their prior life has been we should never judge someone for giving praise to the King of Kings hope you're hearing me this morning we shouldn't look down on people for worshiping and say Well they're not worthy of worshiping neither are you neither am I but we're here anyway we might as well worship if he came we might as well worship sir but he was charging for the spiritual life of the church oh God people still do it today he said he started in at that very time making them pay for prayers charging for prayer he said they still do it no Venus now oil types of spirit wine types of stimulation of Revelation how many know that brother Brandon taught us that in the third seal now when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated yeah brother Brown said wine is a stimulation yeah he said Glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts yeah got some of that new wine yeah when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself unnormally I like that yeah yeah we might as well just let her hair down there ain't no reason to be nervous in church there's no reason to feel condemnation there's no reason to go through and I'm going to deal with that a little bit tonight but there's no reason to just just walk around with your head suck it and throw it out to the ground say well I better pay Penance for all I've done that's not how we're saved we're not saved by doing enough good works to overcome our bad words we're not saved because the balances are balanced out it'll never be balanced out what he did for us is way much greater than anything we could ever do for him but we serve him because we love him we dress this way because we love him we shout because we love him we worship because we love him right and that's what was wrong with Pentecost even their Worship in shouting and praising became a transaction yeah it's like if you do this you're going to be all right no it doesn't matter I could not shout another day in my life and still be born again and still be saved but I shout because I am saved worship because I am saved a transactional we shouldn't teach our young people that they have to have a transaction in order to be saved no you're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ and you believe that and when you do it changes your life now watch this is what happened at Pentecost he's got to hold some of that new wine God oh my god Jehovah God poured himself into Christ all of God Jesus the Bible says is the fullness of the godhead bodily all that God was he poured into Christ bottled him up right the God man walked on Earth lived died he died the man died and it's it's it's it's Spirit he went and preached to the souls in hell for for three days and then he comes back up and when he raises up from the dead he sits down as it were at the right hand of God at the right hand of authority of power and and then he comes 50 days later you remember Andy after the Ascension after the 40 days he comes back then after 10 days to uh the disciples who are waiting in the upper room right and what was happening was God was uniting himself with man he was pouring himself into his body it was a marriage right he was identifying himself he would be Mr Jesus and she would be Mrs Jesus right he was identifying himself with the church and when he did something happened listen listen to me what they did was not the Holy Ghost itself like speaking in tongues and languages where the people could understand staggering like drunk men that was not the holy ghost that was the effects of the Holy Ghost but there was wine at the wedding yes are you with me now the wedding was the important thing and some people you know many times we begin to think I'm just preaching to you this morning but we think well you know I I know the word I understand the message that's enough I I have a an ability to comprehend the Mysteries that are in the book and I understand these things that's good that's wonderful God give you that by Revelation but there needs to be wine at the wedding in order to make it to the hardships of life you need some stimulants you need something in your life that's going to keep you alive something that's going to move you something I don't mean that you'll be shouting running and jumping all the time I mean something that'll make you happy when you shouldn't be happy something that'll give you peace that passes understanding something that'll make you right and live right and look right in the world that you live in is so full of darkness and wrong huh this is what happened at Pentecost they were they were United with Christ and when they did the Bible says they were all amazed we're in doubt saying one to another what means this that's the ones that we're watching this take place so we're hearing it and others mocking said these men are full of new wine which is the same type of wine that Jesus provided at the wedding yeah these men are full of new wine but Peter's standing up with the love because new wine is at its strongest this is why we have to have many refillings of the Holy Spirit right right this is why we need to have Revelation stimulation of revelation we need to we need to dig into the message we need to search out the things of God you need new wine you can't always say well I like that age stuff and stuff I got 30 years ago that's good but ain't got as much stimulant in it right but the new ones got new stimulant in it that's why sometimes you go through some things you say well I was healed 20 years ago I know God's A Healer but you get sick again why because there needs to be some new wine in your life so God's going to bring uh allow a sickness to come upon you so that so that he can heal you so you can have a new stimulant are you hearing me this morning he does that for us he cares about us so Peter stood up and said men and Brethren hearken into my words he said these all you that dwell the Jerusalem hearken of my words he said these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it was about the third hour of the day the bars aren't even open yet he said but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel I love that he had to use that he had to convince them these it can't be drunk there's nothing open selling liquor they act drunk but they can't be drunk because there's nothing open Sound liquor but he said this is that yeah which was spoken by the prophet Joel it had to be scriptural I watched and it fulfilled the scripture until it also fulfilled the scripture in Isaiah Isaiah 28 9 it says Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and are drawn from the breast for a precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line upon line here a little there little for what's tampering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and when the wine runs out in the middle of the wedding when it gets really hard to serve and it gets really hard to fulfill your obligation and if it gets really hard to do your duties at the church this is the refreshing yes oh don't you need a refreshing from time to time this is the refreshing said yet they would not hear speaking of that Jewish Nation they would not hear notice brother Brandon said this is the wine that's poured out what is wine in the Bible refreshments Refreshments this is the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord you can have all your all the old stuff that you want to you can have all this stuff for the world all the the sports and I'm not preaching against Sports I'm not preaching against those things but you can have all of it give me that new wine that lets me come to the house of God and lets me Worship in a way that I know that God is pleased and I know that I've made him happy late give me that new wine that lets me hear a sermon that I'll get Revelation from that lets me or open a book or listen to a tape I get Revelation from it and I get stimulated new wine are you with me this morning so when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen the fire of God fall upon their mind that began to stimulate them oh my first thing you know they got so stimulated so that people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by the Revelation God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them they was happy about it God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them here was a man standing there saying this is it this is that this is it and there it was being a Vindicator by the same sign he said that we have today Hallelujah he said oh how wonderful revealed revealed they become so stimulated when they seen The Vindicator that just always does that it always does maybe we need to get our heads off out of out of Fox News and out of CNN and get them back into scripture where we can get some stimulation of Revelation get it back in the house of God and get some stimulation of Revelation find out that everybody's not against you everybody don't hate you there's a power and a purpose of God you can you can have stimulation of Revelation in your life I get stimulated when I eat remember the bill I get stimulated I ate them ribs man I get stimulated I go to a really good restaurant I'm in a really good restaurant I get stimulated as soon as that my wife will tell you I start making no oh that was good man that excites me you all know that so some of y'all get stimulated about things maybe it's not food maybe it's a new car or an old car that stimulates you huh something something that stimulates your sports whatever it is it is when's the last time you opened up the book yeah and you begin to read and you read about a wedding in Cana and you and that wine began to stimulate you realize how much God does for us and sometimes I just love being able to stand up here and preach to you because it what it does for me is I'm standing up here and we were preaching the other day and preaching about the about the crystal the sea of glass I didn't hardly have any voice to preach it with but the crystal the crystal sea that was there before them it was completely clear brother said it meant they had nothing against them they were completely redeemed what that did for my heart was the stimulation of Revelation is something inside of you that moves you yes man that's good and we could go and look at the message of the hour and look at what we have and look out of denominationalism and and I'll be honest with you I'm glad that we got a prophet I'm glad we have a prophet I was looking just the other day that they actually preached a sermon on an Evangelical conference and it was it was a oh it was AI it was artificial intelligence that preached a sermon in Germany and it preached a good denominational sermon it did in fact there's been a lot of preachers speculate could it take our place and it probably will because they can get a self-help seminar an algorithm can preach what they're preaching hope you realize where we're at this morning algorithm a computer can preach what they're preaching but a computer cannot preach to you this message God didn't call mechanical devices to preach the gospel he called men amen a computer can't preach this message a computer cannot get stimulated by revelation right hold on over to God it can probably preach about this message it can probably preach a Methodist message but it cannot preach the word of God it cannot go get the hidden man and bring it out yes sir oh my god brother Branham said he said when I see that God promised to do a certain thing in this day when he promised to break off these seals this last day you don't know the joy the glory when I've seen him reveal this stand there and watch it happen and know that I'll take any person to charge he never did say one thing to us but what happened that way and then to see the joy that's in my heart it wasn't cold and dead and formal but it when the seals come it didn't come in a clinical way but it come in a way that brought joy to his heart what is your Revelation done for you let me ask you that what has it done for your family what has it done for those around you what has it done for the church that you go to what is it done for the people around you if it's a revelation from God it don't come in a dry desert dry bear in place but it comes with stimulation of Revelation that gives you the ability to do more than what you were able to do Hallelujah he said he said you know that I'll take any person to charge he never did say one thing to us but what happened that way and then to see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise for this last stage as he promised to do it here I've seen it Vindicated me perfectly right you hear me say I feel religious he said that's what's the matter the stimulation is so bad I just about ready to go cutting up you know stimulation from Revelation said they become so stimulated over the Revelation you've got to catch this they become so stimulated over the Revelation that they Vindicated the promise so the wine was not just to make them feel good although it had that effect yeah right but it had a purpose brother Harold it had a purpose the wine had a purpose wine they say it has a medicinal value a medicinal value and this wine has a medicinal purpose they've indicated the promise what did it do the actually the stimulation made them with stammering lips and staggering like drunk men yeah God let me say this without the stimulation of Revelation you can't fulfill the word of the hour without the stimulation of Revelation they could not have fulfilled Isaiah 28 yeah they could not have done it oh god without the joy without the stimulation listen you say why can't I have it without the joy why can't I just have it as a clinical experience why can't it just be a teaching because it takes the wine of the Holy Ghost to actually make you fulfill the word he said they become so stimulated that they Vindicated the promise Hallelujah that we'd be that stimulated today since they broke out the joy of stimulation until the people said they're drunk on new line when God revealed his promise to them and not only did he reveal it but he proved it how did he prove it through a bunch of seemingly drunk people Hallelujah John 2 and 4 Y'all Gonna think I'm crazy for I'm done so it's all right Jesus says in her woman what have I do with thee my hour is not yet come this isn't my wedding oh God but if he would provide wine for a wedding in Galilee we don't even know who the wedding was for don't you think he'll have wine at his wedding which is going on right now Hallelujah see the wedding could have went on just as well with a bunch of dry thirsty people but the word he was the word and he would not allow the wedding to go on that way yeah I see people say well I like the way it was 40 years ago and we all just sat around the tape and I'm sure there were there were dedicated people that loved the Lord many of you were there during that time everybody just sit there real quiet and things that's wonderful but at the wedding sometime during the wedding when the wine runs out there's got to be some wine there's got to be some enjoyment there's got to be some some satisfaction there's got to be some there's got to be some promises that are preached and there's got to be some people who believe them sometime during the wedding there's got to be simulation of Revelation he could have come and just taken a bunch of dry thirsty people and revealed the bride and went home but he waits until the people get the new wine Hallelujah the word would not allow the wedding to continue like it was and notice brother Reynolds says when his presence is near it certainly brings emotion he said anything without emotion is dead any religion hasn't got some emotion to it you better bury it instead it brings emotion he quickens us when we are quick and let's remember what quickened US right so there's a purpose it's not just just a bunch of people acting like drunk people because you could act like that on your own yeah yeah right but that's not what it is but it's actually something that is vindicating that it's vindicating the word he said let's remember what quickness what did is the presence of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in our midst showing himself that he is alive brother Branham taught us that the angel of the Lord accompanies the message I love that he didn't say it accompanies the messenger always but it accompanies the message always the message always so when we preach the message brother Joel brother Stewart when we preach the message the angel of the Lord accompanies our message we need to believe that it accompanies our message because it's not our message it's the message that came from the mighty angel so the company's the message always and brother random goes in another place he said oh the greatest place where I know of is to pray until I can realize I'm in the presence of God and recognize it he said I think that ought to be the thrill of the church it's the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated you know to give Faith to make cripples walk and blind sea and death here and dumb speak that's good yes right now I want you to watch John 2 and 5. so his mother see Jesus doesn't do it on his own look his mother said to the servants whatever he says unto you do it I like that whatever he says unto you do it and so there had to be somebody there that was responsible to carry the wine now they could not they could fill the pot with water and they could bring the people together we might say in this hour but they could not turn the water into wine the word Christ had to be there to bring the stimulation of Revelation but there was somebody oh my there was a servant there God help me to be one today a servant that will carry the stimulation of Revelation see this this message is not to be preached as some kind of a a some kind of a a lesson brought by some kind of a professor somewhere that's not what it's supposed to be preached at but it's remember the ark was to be carried over their shoulders over their hearts the message is supposed to be on our hearts and the stimulation of Revelation the way this works is that actually we carry the stimulation now we don't have big Stone vessels or little bitty cups to carry the wine in him we don't have little little wine cups carrying them out here while we're I'm not walking around mother Joel with a cup of wine and giving you a drink and giving them a drink that's not my job what I'm doing is I'm carrying the stimulation of Revelation in my own heart if I don't have it I can't give it to you but the servant had it so he could give it to the people at the wedding [Applause] amen this time we got excited about the message of the hour again it's time we it's time we took a step back and realized what what we're a part of yeah we're part of the greatest thing that's happened since the beginning we're part of the restoration we're part of the going home time we're sitting on the train it's already left the station we're going home we know who we are we ought to be excited about that ought to be some stimulation of that revelation sometimes I'm sorry church I I don't want to be harsh this morning but sometimes we stand here and say I'm elected I know that I am well you ever seen a victory party when I'm talking about the ones when they hit when they get elected they I think they turn that camera off after a while because it gets kind of crazy because when the president gets elected to be president or the congressman gets elected to be Congressman you know what they do they throw a party and the balloons fall and everything goes on why they are elected yeah come on some of y'all get it after a while they've been elected so I've been elected if you really get a revelation of that if you've really read the returns that you begin to realize I'm the elected of God I belong to God it'll bring a smile to your face at the very least it'll do something to your heart I'm elected I belong to God They carried it on their hearts oh my God oh my Paul says Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost with stimulation of Revelation and much Assurance as you knew what men or men we were among you for your sake we became the evidence that the wine was good today that most of the people don't want a man that'll stand and tell the truth about it they want some little Ricky with a Hollywood haircut perfume all over walk right up here and talk about some theology that he learned off in some Cemetery or seminary he said excuse me it's all the same place a home of corpses so then we find that everywhere they want something like that they don't want the old-fashioned gospel handed out in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost anymore hand it out that's our job to hand it out we didn't make it we can't create it I didn't give myself the inspiration I didn't bring the message to the hour but I can hand it out that's my job is to hand it out and if I believe in what I'm handing out you'll know it yeah okay that's good Hallelujah remember we need a testimony meeting a great thing you said well well I'm not I'm not a preacher we need a testimony meeting we need a prayer meeting when you're digging down tearing up we need Christ back in our midst and know the Bible he said we're just drifting looser and looser all the time we need to come back to the original Foundation come back to the place of the rock that we were hewed from start over again it's time to get that new wine it is listen it is a responsibility of the ministry to carry the stimulation of the revelation of the word not in their arms but in their hearts again you say well I'm not a preacher but you're still carrying the gospel but the brand said what the church is slacking today is testifying of our great powerful Jesus today we try to limit him try to say well he was and back Yonder but today he's the same that he was then and the church who's got a vision of this do we have a vision of it today and knows it ought not to be slack at any time I mean did you hear that ought not to be slack at any time when the church goes slack when they don't care what the building looks like and they don't care whether they come to church or not and they don't care what the music is like and they don't care about nothing you say well people complain sometimes I really haven't complained and not care yeah I don't want them to complain but I'd rather have them complain than not care yeah all right the whole thing works I've said that before in a marriage the only thing worse than fighting is apathy or you just don't care no more the church has got a vision amen of a great powerful Jesus Oh My of a message of the hour that's alive amen the church has got a vision of this ought not be slack at any time but telling everywhere they go Jesus lives and Reigns Hallelujah we ought to do the very best we can for the gospel if we have an ability to buy a better microphone to help the gospel we ought to do it if we have the ability to preach with all of our heart and give it our all we ought to do it if we've got the ability to witness to our neighbor we ought to do it if we've got the ability to come to the house of God even if feel like it but sometimes you're just there to help somebody else we ought to do it why because we are not to slack when it comes to testifying of who Jesus is Hallelujah we have to help sometimes we gotta help but the brand talked about the shunami woman how she helped Elisha she helped Elijah she gave him a room he could stay in and it helped her because she wasn't able to have children and she had one and then the child died and it was raised from the dead brother better said that that was a prophet's reward was to be friends with a prophet because she was a help she had a Ministry of Health she couldn't stand on the pulpit and preach she couldn't be but she had a Ministry of Health I thank God for some of you you have a Ministry of helps and again that's enough if that's all your ministry ever is that's enough that's more important maybe than many other Ministries and if there's anything brother said he talks about that shooting my woman he said if there's anything we ought to be it's kind to one another when you see a brother or sister in fault don't never breathe it to nobody help us Lord let me turn around and repent I'll get back to you isn't that good yeah yeah don't ever breathe it to nobody oh my that's the next one next quote he said if there's anything keep it to yourself and pray for that person be kind to them and if the spirit of God is in you then you will be kind to one another Jesus said I come to do thy will father oh God help me today God help all of us you know why sometimes we're not kind because we have a sticky nature it's sticky for a reason just what it is but God help me to be kind help me to be kind yeah yeah now listen let me let me be kind in helping others and then let me be kind to the person who's not kind that's what Jesus did now look he said you'll if that spiritually you have that same attitude towards people he said we're about to master his business as he was about the father's business and the same spirit that he had to begin the works of the father and to finish the atonement to make a way that we could carry the message that we could carry the message listen Jesus wasn't just in it for himself but he made an atonement he said that he was he was diligent The Same Spirit that he had in him to begin the works of the father and to finish the atonement to make a way that we could carry the message if that spirit's in you you'll have that same attitude towards people trying to do what you can to help them no matter who they are yes right even if they are message people sometimes I hate to say it sometimes we're kinder to Outsiders when we are to message people well it got quiet didn't it we should be kinder to outside we should be kind to Outsiders they should know but especially Paul says to those of the household of faith yeah he said you'll have that same attitude towards people trying to do what you can to help them no matter who they are where they are you'll try to help people amenities that's kind of strong but that's the truth we'll move on what were they they were carrying the wine the new wine oh my and there were set there six water pots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the Jews contained two or three Firkins or the measures a piece two or three measures is about 120 to 180 gallons would be the total of all all six jars 120 to 180 gallons of water that's quite a bit quite a bit of water if you've ever carried water in stone jars and the the jars were actually made out of a single piece of stone because they were purification jars for the purpose of ritual purification it had to be made out of a single piece of stone and so all six of them together about 120 to 180 gallons of water and Jesus said for them fill the water pots with water and they filled them up to the brim now you know sometimes we have to be willing to do the work so that the stimulation of Revelation can come right the servants had to be willing to go out there and take and mess with the water water represents people right right the servants had to be willing to go among the people and and pick up some people and carry them to church and put them down and go get some more and pick them up you see what I'm see where I'm going see they had to be willing to go out and mingle among the people they had to be willing to get the water and put it in there before it could become wine right they had to be willing and sometimes even in preaching what we're doing is we're laying a foundation we're laying a foundation you hit preachers say that what are you doing you're pouring that water in there pouring that water in there because we've got to be water for there can be wine yeah all right so there had to be water because he was going to change something I'm gonna get to that in a moment if I have time this morning but he took the water pops he filled him with water actually he didn't fill it with water the servants did they probably got sweaty they probably wish they'd put on more deodorant it was hot they thought it was useless can you imagine well we were told to do we're just doing what we're told but man it's a dead bunch of people I'm telling you what now y'all are not but you know what I'm saying so the servant stinks sometimes we might as well go over where the Wine's already operating you don't want to go work where the Wine's already there you want to go to a place where you need it right go to a place where the wine where the wine is going to be poured out it's not all about us that's right go to a place where you can dump in some water yeah yeah so the song leader comes and dumps his water in there and the preacher comes and dumps his water in there reads the scriptures and reads the quotes and that's all they can do but only Jesus can turn the water into wine Jesus said fill the water pots with water I loved how they followed his instructions exactly they filled them up to the brim yeah well nobody gonna slip in and mix the water with wine or the wine with the water now what was he going to do with all that water well the brother said what's he going to do with the church listen remember said I'm glad I got faith in him tonight that someday when my life my body within 16 elements would be back in the dust of the earth he will say William Branham and I'll come forth he will breed the breath of life into it and say there you are he will bypass the birth through my mother and so forth he said like Jesus on his first miracle he turned water into wine he said eventually it would have been wine but he bypassed all that procedure and said turn the water to wine at the resurrection he will not say Mr Mrs Branham get married again bring forth William he will speak and I'll come forth Hallelujah by the spoken word he bypassed the process of the fermentation of the water that's the age we live in church we're at the wedding he's turning the water into wine hey man he said did you notice when he went to make water into wine he took water first already created substance turned into wine I want you to watch he said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do so he do also brother Joel hit on this I think last Sunday night he said Greater Works for these shall he do because I go to my father for Years brother said that was more but then he gives us another explanation of it and the message Shalom towards the end of his ministry he said the Greater Works if you look at it if you look at it in the original greater is actually greater yeah and brother Adam says greater he said was actually that he took something that he took out of nothing he created something yeah that's the third poll right he said did you notice when he went to make water into wine he took water first already created substance turn it into wine when he fed five thousand people he took a fish at one swam in the water broke it handed it out multiplied creation he took bread that was one sweet baked into bread broke it handed it after the people that were turned back again multiplied creation but in the last days when there was no sign of creation he speaks it into creation anyhow shows to be the same God don't give up on your family this is a time of the spoken word at all he can make water he can make wine when there is no water yeah right Hallelujah shows me the same God he was at the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he is God he said greater things that's what you do before I go to my father the word is infallible it has to be manifest has to be fulfilled greater than this so you do not multiplying but speaking out into creation listen there has to be a group that type Jesus type through the resurrection in fact he was one of those right God took that body and resurrected it yeah oh my but there's got to be a group that'll be changed in a moment in twinkling of an eye they're not just going to bypass the the birth again they're going to bypass death itself listen he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump the trumpet shall sound the dead should be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed that's why he had to come in the end time with the third full ministry it was more than just a man yeah was God vindicating he was going to make something out of nothing yeah glory to God this message is spread all over the Earth without any headquarters yeah people tried to denominate and it wouldn't denominate yeah people tried to tried to push down on it won't push down people tried to say they're all backslid they're all going back to the church and they won't go back why won't we go back in spite of persecution because God took something that was nothing and made something out of it God did it we didn't do it God did it [Applause] he said to the said oh Jesus knows when it's time water got turned into wine Jesus told the Jesus told the servants he said it's time to close draw out now there is a time to close draw out now bear into the governor of the feast and they buried now you know I like to think that they didn't stop on the way wherever the governor of the feast was they just went straight to him other people might have tried to stop and talk to him oh can you go get me another piece of fish no I got a job to do Jesus told me that somehow this water that we poured into the vessels has become wine we're going to let the governor of the feast drink of it and see what he thinks they had a job and they did it and when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not wince it was but the servants which through the water new amen the governor of the feast called The Bride group and saith on him every man at the beginning oh God they did have good wine at the beginning but in the middle it got to where there wasn't no wine at all it got worse and worse because what they would do is they would mix water with the wine to make it go longer and finally they had it so thin they just believed in Trinity and and and and all kinds of things it was so thin that they had all kinds of doctrines going on they had no move in the spirit they would and all that was gone it was the Dark Ages but God said I got a servant named Martin Luther yeah it'll take the water when I tell him to and he'll draw out a cup I'm gonna turn the water into wine yeah I got a servant named John Wesley I got a servant named William random word of God that's going to bring the best wine at the end of the wedding glory to God when we've been fully United to the word at the time of the appearing of the Bride oh God men of well drunk he said than that which is worse because maybe they won't taste as much yeah so but thou has kept the good wine until now most people would mix the wine with the best at the beginning and it was slowly die that's the nature of things but not Jesus he said I am the resurrection and the life the bride was about to be presented she'd been hidden down Through the Ages but now she was to be married now she is married and she's introduced to the world this is Mrs Jesus Christ I hope the church truly understands it what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it yes yes the bride has been introduced he said we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age we're not living in the method of stage we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age you're calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that's the age that we're now living so if the bride age is here or the bride in time if we could say it that way the bride has to be here let that sink in for a minute you say well the bride failed not if the bride age is here come on right if the bright age is here there has to be a bride who would not be deceived if the bride age is here that infant private has to have become a mature bride when the bride agents here the bride has come out of her chamber and if that's the case listen to me there must be new wine at the wedding Revelation 19 7. listen what it says let us be glad and rejoice why it's wedding time yeah the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready let us be glad and rejoice at the revealing of the Bride there's a stimulation of Revelation at the end time don't you realize where you're at church there is no excuse to
