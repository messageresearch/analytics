[38:31] Oh yes, for the grace that you have

[38:39] So thankful, Lord. Oh, I can't repay
[38:44] from my heart. I'd like to say
[38:48] that I
[38:51] thank
[38:52] you.
[38:54] Let's bow our heads for just a moment.
[38:56] Heavenly Father, we want to thank you
[38:58] for the grace that you've given us.
[39:01] Lord, for the mercy that we find in your
[39:03] word and the the the power and the
[39:06] strength that it gives us to go on,
[39:08] knowing that though we were sinners, yet
[39:10] you we've been washed by your blood.
[39:12] Lord, our sins have been placed in the
[39:14] bleach and the blood of the Lord Jesus
[39:17] Christ. We're so thankful for that. I
[39:19] pray that you'd help us to walk worthy
[39:21] of the vocation that we've been called
[39:23] to, Lord, to do, Lord, the thing that
[39:25] you've called for us to do. I pray you'd
[39:27] grant it today. Help us as we hear your
[39:29] word, Lord. May we may we not just hear
[39:32] it, but may we be doers of the word,
[39:34] Lord. May we become the word that you've
[39:36] given us in this hour. We pray for you
[39:38] to heal every sick person. Touch
[39:40] everybody, Lord. Every soul, every
[39:42] spirit, we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[39:46] Amen. And God bless you this morning. Uh
[39:49] you can be seated for just a moment. I
[39:53] uh Sister Lori, did you want to give
[39:55] that testimony this morning? Could you
[39:57] do that? Uh we're going to have Sister
[39:59] Lori come up and uh she's going to
[40:02] testify about some things the Lord has
[40:05] done. Uh and uh we just we just love the
[40:08] Lord. Aren't you Aren't you always happy
[40:09] to hear testimonies of the goodness of
[40:11] God? Amen. That's good.
[40:21] going to give you something to talk
[40:22] with, don't I?
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I text Brother Ben this morning
[40:30] because
[40:32] God has done so much for our church and
[40:35] for people in our church.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And I felt like I wanted to give God all
[40:40] the glory if I can get through this
[40:42] without crying.
[40:44] Uh it started a few weeks away when we
[40:47] had the meeting. Uh you all know Sister
[40:50] Fritz wears oxygen, had to wear oxygen,
[40:53] was weak and and so uh after the
[40:57] meetings, it was the dinner we had and
[41:00] we walked over there. She was pretty
[41:02] weak, couldn't hardly walk. And I pulled
[41:03] up over there and we got her in there
[41:05] and we sitting there at the table and
[41:08] and she uh she seen brother Daryl walk
[41:10] by and she said, "Would you mind going
[41:13] over there and telling him to come over?
[41:14] I'd like to shake his hand before he
[41:16] leaves. I may not get to shake his hand
[41:18] again." So I said, "I don't mind." So I
[41:20] went over there and got him. And I said,
[41:22] "Brother Daryl," I said, "You see that
[41:23] little lady over there sitting at the
[41:24] table?" And he said, "That little lady
[41:26] with an oxygen on." I said, "Yeah." I
[41:29] said, "That's sister Fritz. she want to
[41:30] wants to uh talk to you and shake your
[41:32] hand. So he went over there and didn't
[41:34] even get his food. He just left and went
[41:36] right over there and and she said, "I'd
[41:38] like to shake your hand and tell you how
[41:40] I appreciate your ministry." And and
[41:42] might not never get to shake your hand
[41:43] again. And
[41:45] there was some words said and he kneels
[41:47] down there right there in the middle of
[41:49] the dinner and I was sitting on the
[41:51] other side and I knew it was a moment in
[41:54] time.
[41:56] He started praying for her. And although
[41:59] she may be 91 years old, God is no
[42:02] respector person.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And I know she's got her mind that she's
[42:07] she's older than us and and it's maybe
[42:10] time for her to go on, but God knows all
[42:12] of that. Well, he he knelt down there
[42:15] and I heard his words. He said, "Lord,"
[42:18] he said, "I pray you'll renew her
[42:20] strength." And he said, "Get her off
[42:22] this oxygen." And I thought that was
[42:24] kind of odd why he said that.
[42:27] So all the way home we we talked about
[42:29] that and I thought
[42:32] that was something, you know, I thought,
[42:34] why would he say that? She never even
[42:35] asked him for prayer, nothing. And I we
[42:37] got to talking about I thought, you
[42:39] know, she didn't even have the strength
[42:40] enough to come through the prayer line,
[42:41] but God knew he knew what she needed.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; So
[42:47] anyway, she got home and that week, uh,
[42:50] we talked every evening. We kind of
[42:52] talked to each other before we go to bed
[42:54] and we got to talking about it. She said
[42:57] one night she said, "Lori, I'm not on my
[42:59] oxygen no more." And I said, "Well,
[43:00] praise the Lord." During the day she's
[43:02] been leaving it off, just having it at
[43:04] night. Then a couple days later, she
[43:06] said, "Guess what? I'm not using it at
[43:08] night anymore."
[43:09] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I said, "Thank the Lord."
[43:12] And so, anyway, uh, she said, "You know,
[43:14] Lori, I've had a battle. The devil you,
[43:16] of course, the Lord don't do anything
[43:17] but the devil tries to come and put fear
[43:19] in your mind." And so she'd lay down and
[43:21] she'd say thoughts would come to my mind
[43:24] and the devil would try to say, "You're
[43:25] not going to wake up cuz you ain't got
[43:27] your oxygen on." And she said, "I got to
[43:29] thinking. I thought, well, if I don't,
[43:32] I'll be in a better place, you know." So
[43:34] anyway, that going on to that, uh, she'd
[43:38] been on oxygen for over two years. She's
[43:40] not on oxygen no more. So anyway, I got
[43:43] one more thing to say.
[43:46] So, uh, since the meetings, it really
[43:48] been on my burden on my heart that she'd
[43:51] have to go to the hospital. I don't know
[43:52] if y'all know anything about Sister
[43:54] Fritz, but she's got a condition where
[43:55] her bone marrow doesn't make blood
[43:57] anymore. And she has to go every month,
[43:59] every two months for blood transfusions.
[44:02] And she don't have very little blood for
[44:05] when she goes in to get her blood drawn,
[44:07] they have to stick her and stick her and
[44:08] stick her. and she'd stay all day long
[44:11] after they told her she'd have to go get
[44:14] blood transfusions. It would take
[44:15] sometimes all day long. So, uh,
[44:20] she had to go to the doctor this week
[44:23] and every time this has been going on
[44:25] for months, she had to go to the doctor
[44:27] this week. She's been going for
[44:28] transfusions every month, every uh,
[44:31] she'd stay all day and come home and the
[44:33] last few times she's done it, she's told
[44:35] me, she said, "Lori, I don't feel no
[44:36] stronger."
[44:38] Well,
[44:39] about a
[44:42] about uh a week before the meeting, she
[44:46] told me. She said, "Lori, I'm so weak."
[44:47] I remember coming into her house one
[44:50] Sunday and she said, "I'm so weak."
[44:51] After a blood transfusion, she said, she
[44:54] said, "I I just don't know what I'm
[44:56] going to do this tomorrow. I don't know
[44:57] if I can make it." And I said, "Well,
[44:58] are you going to go to church?" And and
[45:00] she looked at me, she said, "Yes, I am."
[45:03] So, we come on and that was the day
[45:05] brother Harvey brought her in and she'd
[45:06] been so weak. So anyway,
[45:09] brother Bruce had to take her, he took
[45:11] her to her doctor's appointment this
[45:13] week. He made a statement to her and he
[45:16] said, "You know, Sister Fritz, he said,
[45:18] uh, you know, God took care of your
[45:21] oxygen." And he said, "He's going next
[45:23] is going to be your blood." So she goes
[45:26] in there and, uh, she called me that
[45:29] night. She said, "You know, Lori," she
[45:30] said, "Uh, they usually have to stick me
[45:33] so many times to even get blood." She
[45:35] said, "They got it on the first stick.
[45:38] And I said, "You know what?" I said,
[45:39] "God is God is making blood for you."
[45:43] &gt;&gt; So anyway, she went to the doctor and
[45:46] she got home and the next day I was at
[45:48] my job and my phone rings and it was
[45:50] sister Fritz and I didn't get it. So I
[45:52] called her back and she said, "I just
[45:54] got to tell you something." She said,
[45:57] "The doctor said I don't have to have a
[45:58] blood transfusion. First time in three
[46:00] years."
[46:03] So,
[46:05] I just want to give God the praise. And
[46:07] we talk every night and I tell her, I'd
[46:10] say, "Sister Fritz, there's nothing too
[46:12] hard for God." And I told her, I said,
[46:14] "Whose report are we going to believe?"
[46:17] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I don't care how old or how
[46:18] young you are." I said, "God is still
[46:20] the healer."
[46:21] &gt;&gt; So, I just want to give God praise for
[46:23] that.
[46:33] Amen. If you can do it for Sister Fritz,
[46:35] he can do it for you.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many love our sister Fritz
[46:40] back there? Don't you love Sister Fritz?
[46:47] She meant so much to us and our family.
[46:49] It's just hard to put into words. But
[46:52] the Lord can do that. And he's done so
[46:54] much for us just lately. And you know
[46:57] the devil just keep trying to attack and
[46:59] come and and attack. But you just
[47:01] remember it's just another opportunity
[47:02] for God to show himself faithful. He's
[47:06] still the rock. How many believe that
[47:07] today? He's our rock. He's our
[47:09] salvation. Let's stand together.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. My we could just rejoice right now
[47:14] and go home and say it was good to be in
[47:16] the house of the Lord, but we'll get
[47:17] into the word this morning and I'll try
[47:19] not to hold you real long.
[47:22] Amen.
[47:24] We just love the Lord so much for doing
[47:26] that for our sister. And just believing
[47:28] this morning is going to be another time
[47:30] when when chains are broken off and
[47:34] people are healed and and our minds are
[47:36] restored and renewed and things are
[47:39] different for us. Brother Brandham said
[47:40] we never leave here the same way that we
[47:43] came in.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; So let's just leave better than when we
[47:45] came in.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's leave change from this
[47:48] building. We don't we don't waste
[47:50] opportunities in the presence of the
[47:52] Lord. Tonight we're going to have a
[47:54] youth service for the youth by the
[47:55] youth. And so you old folks, older folks
[47:59] don't have to come, but if you do want
[48:00] to come, you're welcome to to sit in in
[48:02] the back of the building and encourage
[48:04] them. And and uh but we're going to do
[48:06] that at 3:00 this afternoon. First Kings
[48:08] chapter 5 and verse 15
[48:12] says, "And Solomon had three score and
[48:14] 10,000 that bear burdens and four score
[48:17] thousand hewers in the mountains. beside
[48:20] the chief of Solomon's officers which
[48:22] were over the work 3,300 which ruled
[48:26] over the people that wrought in the
[48:27] work. And the king commanded, and they
[48:30] brought great stones, costly stones, and
[48:34] hued stones to lay the foundation of the
[48:38] house. And Solomon's builders and
[48:41] Hyram's builders did hue them, and the
[48:44] stone squarers. So they prepared timber
[48:47] and stones to build the house. Amen. I
[48:51] pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[48:52] the word. You may be seated this morning
[48:58] to build a temple, a building of the
[49:01] size of the temple and and with that
[49:03] kind of splendor that it had. Uh they
[49:06] had to obtain raw materials. In fact,
[49:09] there was so much gold in the temple
[49:11] that if you valued it at today's prices,
[49:14] it would be worth $360 billion.
[49:18] And and they overlaid the entire
[49:21] interior of the temple with gold. And on
[49:24] the exterior, it was stone. And the
[49:26] building, the structure was made of
[49:28] stone. And then on the inside, they
[49:31] overlaid that and and a ways coating of
[49:33] of wood on the inside. And so it had to
[49:37] be obtained. It had to be sourced. It
[49:40] had to be carefully prepared uh just for
[49:43] that temple. And I believe that God
[49:45] prepares his people in the same way that
[49:48] he's brought them from different places,
[49:50] different backgrounds, different earth,
[49:52] if you will. And he's dug them out and
[49:54] shaped them to be a part of the house of
[49:57] God. We are the house of God today. We
[50:00] are the temple of God. And so he has
[50:03] shaped us to be what we are and to fit
[50:06] in a certain place. And it was such that
[50:08] in 1 kings 6:7 it says, "And the house
[50:11] when it was in building was built of
[50:14] stone, made ready before it was brought
[50:17] thither, so that there was neither
[50:19] hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron
[50:23] heard in the house while it was in
[50:25] building." So by the time it was put
[50:27] into the house, it was actually uh fit
[50:31] so well together that it actually they
[50:34] didn't have to make any adjustments.
[50:36] Now, think about that for a minute. If
[50:37] you've ever been part of a building
[50:39] project and you bought pre-cut lumber or
[50:42] pre-cut or you had some kind of thing
[50:44] like that, there's always some
[50:45] adjustment that you've got to make.
[50:47] Maybe the lot's not perfectly level.
[50:49] Maybe things just aren't perfect. If
[50:51] you've remodeled a house, Allan, if
[50:53] you've been remodeling, you know this.
[50:55] It nothing works out the way that you
[50:57] envision it just exactly. It's it's
[51:00] going to be a little bit different. and
[51:01] you're going to have to make some
[51:02] adjustments. But these things worked out
[51:05] just exactly right because it was in not
[51:08] only was it a natural skill that the
[51:11] builders had, but it was a supernatural
[51:14] element to it that they were inspired to
[51:16] cut it in such a way that it would fit
[51:19] exactly in the temple when it was
[51:21] finished. So each stone and the wood
[51:23] that overlaid it had to be perfectly cut
[51:26] before it got to the construction site.
[51:29] And so they brought down cedars from
[51:31] Lebanon and they floated them in from
[51:33] Japa and hauled them by oxcart and so
[51:36] forth. Brother Brandham says they then
[51:38] they cut all their stones all around the
[51:40] world. But when they come together they
[51:42] were such perfect masonry. Perfect
[51:45] masonry. In 40 years in the building of
[51:48] the temple there wasn't a buzz of a saw
[51:51] or a sound of a hammer. every stone
[51:53] went, he said, "One was cut this way,
[51:56] one was cut that way, one was cut back
[51:59] this way, but every one of them went
[52:01] together."
[52:03] And I think as we begin to look at the
[52:06] differences in the stones and even the
[52:08] differences in how they were cut, it
[52:11] would have been impossible for you to
[52:12] envision just by looking at one single
[52:15] pile of stones what the end result was
[52:18] going to be. But there had to be an
[52:21] overwhelming uh uh there had to be a
[52:23] vision and a pattern that would show us
[52:26] what the total what the what it would
[52:27] look like. But it's very difficult to
[52:29] see the full temple in any particular
[52:32] piece of stone. And yet that particular
[52:35] stone was cut for that particular place.
[52:38] If we could say it this way, it was a
[52:39] peculiar stone cut for a particular
[52:43] place. A peculiar stone cut for a
[52:46] particular place. I believe that's what
[52:48] each one of us are this morning. We may
[52:50] be a peculiar stone, but God cut us,
[52:53] brother JT, for a particular place in
[52:56] the house of God. We belong somewhere in
[52:59] the building of God. And so, and brother
[53:02] Brandham said, the Bible is the
[53:03] structure. He said, "But the Holy
[53:05] Spirit's building the building." Now, he
[53:08] said, "Certainly, it's got to frame
[53:09] together and look like this and like
[53:11] that and like that, but the Holy
[53:13] Spirit's putting it together." Yeah.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; He said just as Solomon's temple was cut
[53:18] out all over the world, one block was
[53:20] cut this way, one cut that way. When
[53:22] they come together, he said every block
[53:24] went right to its place without a buzz
[53:27] of a saw or a sound of a hammer. He
[53:30] said, "The great church of the living
[53:31] God is born again stones cut out."
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Born again stones cut out. So
[53:38] when you when you're born again, when
[53:40] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[53:41] Ghost, God isn't done with you yet.
[53:44] Yeah, true.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that because I wasn't
[53:48] what I am today a year ago, 5 years ago,
[53:51] 10 years ago, and I'm not today what I
[53:53] will be tomorrow. But I know if God's
[53:55] still working on me, then there's a
[53:57] product to finish. I'm not happy with
[53:59] what I am. I believe I believe I have
[54:01] the Holy Ghost. I believe God has given
[54:03] me very great things in in my life,
[54:06] blessings in my life, and given me
[54:08] people that that love me. And I I
[54:10] appreciate that. But yet, I know that
[54:12] there's more that God wants out of my
[54:14] life. We should never be completely
[54:16] satisfied with where we are at any
[54:19] particular place in time. Because we
[54:21] know we're headed for something. We're
[54:23] meant to be somewhere. We're meant to
[54:25] fit in a right particular place. A
[54:28] peculiar stone for a very particular
[54:30] place. Brother Brandham said, I he said,
[54:32] I want you to notice one stone was cut
[54:34] this way, another stone cut another way.
[54:37] Perhaps when the masons were cutting
[54:39] them, he said, now listen, he said they
[54:42] might have argued and fussed and
[54:45] everything else,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; the masons might have argued and fussed.
[54:50] Why? Because they were cutting different
[54:51] stones
[54:52] &gt;&gt; for different purposes,
[54:55] &gt;&gt; right? So the masons get, you know, to
[54:57] talking to one another and and and they
[55:00] get to fussing with one another and you
[55:02] can imagine what it must have been like
[55:03] as one maybe he's got a very small
[55:06] instrument and a tool and he's he's
[55:09] doing his uh his cutting in a very fine
[55:12] way, a precise way, cutting small
[55:14] stones.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And another one he's got great big
[55:18] stones. Some of the stones in the temple
[55:20] were I think 600 tons. They were huge
[55:23] stones, foundation stones, and he's just
[55:26] got an axe and he's cutting them with a
[55:27] with a great big stone axe or stone
[55:30] hammer, a sledgehammer, and and he's
[55:32] cutting his great big piece of stone.
[55:34] And here's this other one cutting a very
[55:36] small piece of stone. And and he's
[55:38] looking over at him and saying, "What is
[55:40] what what good is that? It's so big.
[55:42] Where's that going to go? What use is
[55:44] that going to be?" And someone else with
[55:46] his small piece, he's saying, "What good
[55:47] could that big old stone be?" or or the
[55:50] big piece say what good is that little
[55:51] bit of stone but it was all going into
[55:54] the temple.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham said the masons
[55:57] begin to fuss and I think that's where
[56:00] we get caught up a lot of times as
[56:01] preachers is we begin to fuss with one
[56:04] another maybe because another church
[56:05] isn't exactly like ours or maybe because
[56:08] our church isn't exactly like what we
[56:10] want it to be. We say well I wish that
[56:12] brother Ben would do it this way or
[56:13] brother Joel would do it this way or
[56:15] brother so and so would do it this way.
[56:16] when actually it may be that God's using
[56:19] the way the man is made and the way his
[56:21] his particular skill in the gospel his
[56:25] particular gift to cut the stone a
[56:27] certain way to fit in a certain place to
[56:30] meet the challenge of a certain hour
[56:32] that gives me hope if there's something
[56:34] bigger than us I don't know how to
[56:36] prepare these young people to meet the
[56:38] challenge of the next 20 years if there
[56:39] is another 20 years I don't know how to
[56:41] I don't know how to to guide the people
[56:44] in that way but I know God does and I
[56:46] know he'll use me to do that. He'll use
[56:48] other ministers to do that.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; So they said, they may have argued and
[56:54] fussed and everything else like a bunch
[56:55] of preachers does today.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the Methodist. I'm the church of
[57:01] God. Glory to God. I belong to the
[57:03] assemblies. I this. He said, "You keep
[57:05] fussing." But remember, it's God is the
[57:08] one that's doing the cutting.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can use a man. He will use men.
[57:12] That's what he uses. He don't use
[57:13] mechanical devices. He uses men, but
[57:16] God's the one doing the cutting. He
[57:18] said, "You fuss if you want to. You
[57:19] argue if you want to, but God does the
[57:22] cutting."
[57:23] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is doing the cutting. And we
[57:28] don't always understand. We want to
[57:29] hurry things along and we want to make
[57:31] something happen, but it's God's stone,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; right? It's his rock,
[57:37] &gt;&gt; his peculiar rock that he made and
[57:40] pre-ordained before the foundation of
[57:42] the world to be a part of this house of
[57:44] God.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Not all the rock in the world was
[57:47] chosen to be a part of the temple, but
[57:50] the rock that was chosen to be a part of
[57:51] the temple was pre-ordained by God. I
[57:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we can catch this this morning.
[57:57] It was pre-ordained by God to fit a
[58:00] particular time and a particular place
[58:02] and a particular need in the house of
[58:05] God.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says there a bunch
[58:09] of preachers said, "I belong to the
[58:10] assemblies." He said, "You keep fussing.
[58:12] Remember, it's God is the one doing the
[58:13] cutting." And when this cuts this way
[58:16] and one that way, they couldn't
[58:19] understand.
[58:21] And I think it's a it's a mistake
[58:23] &gt;&gt; to try to make all of our churches the
[58:25] same.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. to try to do everything just
[58:28] like somebody else does them.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And I think we could go a little bit
[58:31] further and make that even in our own
[58:32] individual lives. It's a mistake to try
[58:34] to be somebody else.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I could never be brother Jeremy. Brother
[58:38] Jeremy could never be me. But we belong
[58:40] in the house of God,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; right? We got a particular place and and
[58:44] many times we discount somebody else
[58:46] because they don't fit our place. Or
[58:47] maybe our idea, maybe this we have an
[58:50] idea what a pastor should be or what a
[58:52] what an evangelist should be or what a
[58:54] song leader ought to be, what a what a
[58:56] piano player ought to be and we we got
[58:57] this particular idea and if they don't
[58:59] fit our cutting the way we've been cut,
[59:02] we think, well, you know, they must not
[59:03] fit at all. No, they just fit a
[59:05] different place than you fit. And that
[59:07] don't even mean they fit a different
[59:08] church. They just fit a different place
[59:10] in the church,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; right? There's things that they can do
[59:14] maybe that you can't do. things that
[59:15] they can do maybe that I can't do. That
[59:17] don't mean they're not they're not
[59:19] children of God. It's just they've been
[59:20] cut a certain way. They've been prepared
[59:23] for a certain thing.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And God may he may
[59:29] prepare someone for years. One stone may
[59:31] be ready early and not take much cutting
[59:35] &gt;&gt; and another stone might take years. Very
[59:38] good.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And the more unique the stone,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; the more important the place that where
[59:45] it fits,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; right? Because it fits a spot where
[59:48] there's a change
[59:50] &gt;&gt; in the architecture.
[59:52] So he said the whole thing was laying on
[59:54] the ground. When they went to put it
[59:55] together, the whole thing was laying on
[59:56] the ground and they put it block on
[59:58] block on block and didn't have to cut no
[1:00:02] more.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, 'I believe one of these
[1:00:06] glorious days when this United
[1:00:09] Confederation of Church goes together.
[1:00:11] Now, you all going to start recognizing
[1:00:12] this quote now. This is the same quote.
[1:00:15] He said, "And the new pope is brought
[1:00:17] out of the United States."
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; And put over there according to
[1:00:21] prophecy. I believe we've seen that.
[1:00:23] People get mixed up in that because they
[1:00:25] see a new pope from the US and they
[1:00:27] think, "Well, that means that the the
[1:00:29] tribulation's coming and now we're in
[1:00:30] the tribulation." No, that's not what
[1:00:32] that means. It just means prophecy was
[1:00:34] fulfilled,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; right? What was the prophecy? Revelation
[1:00:37] 13,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; right? That America, there would be a
[1:00:40] uniting of that power. There would be an
[1:00:43] image to the beast,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; right? And so, Brother Brandham takes
[1:00:46] that and says there has to be an
[1:00:47] American pope. And so, he said when the
[1:00:49] new pope is brought out of the United
[1:00:50] States and put over there according to
[1:00:51] prophecy, then they'll then they'll form
[1:00:53] an image like into the beast. So, I
[1:00:55] believe we're living in those times,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; right? We're living in those times, but
[1:00:58] that doesn't mean that that doesn't mean
[1:01:00] it happened tomorrow. Are you with me
[1:01:03] now? We don't even know if this pope
[1:01:04] will be the one that becomes the
[1:01:05] incarnate. We don't know that.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Right. But what we do know is that
[1:01:09] prophecy has been fulfilled in our day.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Right? And if that prophecy has been
[1:01:13] fulfilled, then what's brother Brandham
[1:01:15] talking about? He said when that
[1:01:16] happens, he said I tell you the true
[1:01:18] church of God will be drove together.
[1:01:20] The real true believers out of
[1:01:22] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:01:23] Pentecostal, Nazarene, pilgrim holiness,
[1:01:26] whatever they'll be will cemented by the
[1:01:29] love of God. He said, "That'll make the
[1:01:31] body of the Lord Jesus Christ, all the
[1:01:34] believers and agnostics and shallow
[1:01:36] minded will be cast to one side, they'll
[1:01:38] go right on into the confederation of
[1:01:40] churches." I want to be a part of what
[1:01:41] God's doing in our day. So, if the Pope
[1:01:44] from America has come in our time, then
[1:01:46] it must be time for the temple to be put
[1:01:48] together. It must be Hallelujah. must be
[1:01:51] time for the for the Masons to stop
[1:01:53] fussing with one another and begin to
[1:01:55] realize just because your church is
[1:01:57] different don't mean that they're not
[1:01:59] part of the program of God.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So they they were cutting
[1:02:07] different stones
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; different ways,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:13] And part of maturity is recognizing our
[1:02:17] uniqueness and not being uh you know
[1:02:21] when when you're little and have you
[1:02:24] ever seen young people get mad? I say
[1:02:26] young people little kids get mad because
[1:02:28] they all want to play a different game,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; right? And and so they
[1:02:34] some of you kids have done that. I know.
[1:02:36] I've been out here and you see one of
[1:02:37] them crying, you know, and fussing and
[1:02:39] what is it that Well, nobody else will
[1:02:41] play the game she wanted to play or he
[1:02:43] wanted to play, right? And so they they
[1:02:46] won't they'll just pull off by
[1:02:47] themselves and and and they'll cry about
[1:02:50] it for a while and then pretty soon
[1:02:51] they're back playing a game they forgot
[1:02:53] all about it. But they've actually what
[1:02:55] they're doing is is they're trying to
[1:02:58] make all the other kids enjoy what they
[1:03:00] enjoy. And that's just not the way that
[1:03:02] we're made. And as you get older, you
[1:03:04] realize that there are things we can
[1:03:06] enjoy together, but we're different and
[1:03:09] that's okay. There's families that are
[1:03:11] different from one another. There's
[1:03:13] families that are are enjoy board games
[1:03:15] and they play those. There's other
[1:03:17] families that would be bored by board
[1:03:19] games,
[1:03:20] right? There's family in our family, we
[1:03:22] always enjoyed getting together. It was
[1:03:24] real loud. We'd play rook. I don't know
[1:03:25] if I should admit to that, but but we
[1:03:28] play rook. We didn't gamble on rook. We
[1:03:30] just played rook, you know, and didn't
[1:03:31] use the real cards, so we thought we was
[1:03:33] okay, you know, and so we played with
[1:03:35] Rook and Rook and we we loved that game.
[1:03:38] That was that was it was so But there's
[1:03:39] people who don't do that, right? And and
[1:03:41] there's people who who sit together.
[1:03:43] I've seen families that would get
[1:03:44] together and they'd all just sit there,
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; right? And they just be happy in each
[1:03:48] other's company. And that makes me
[1:03:50] nervous,
[1:03:52] right? If we're not all talking at the
[1:03:54] same time, something's wrong,
[1:03:57] right? And so, but it don't it's just a
[1:03:59] difference in the way a family is cut
[1:04:01] out,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; right? It don't mean, you know, me and
[1:04:04] and uh me and and brother Harold can get
[1:04:09] together and I do almost all the talking
[1:04:12] and and then maybe get together with
[1:04:15] somebody else and they do almost all the
[1:04:17] talking,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; right? Because there's different levels
[1:04:19] of that,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; right? And and and there's nothing wrong
[1:04:23] with that. But many times what'll happen
[1:04:25] is we'll only want to hang out around
[1:04:27] people like us.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Who have the interest we do. And
[1:04:30] and some of that's natural and that you
[1:04:32] would hang out around people that have
[1:04:33] the same interest in things that you do.
[1:04:35] But but but some of that is just uh you
[1:04:38] know, you got to reach a place where you
[1:04:40] where you say, "Lord, what do you want
[1:04:41] out of my life? What do you want me who
[1:04:43] do you want me to hang out with? Where
[1:04:45] do you want me to be?
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to be a part of?
[1:04:49] what what kind of a a place or position
[1:04:51] do what what do you want out of my life?
[1:04:53] Because we know sometimes it helps us to
[1:04:55] be around people who are different from
[1:04:57] us. And some people who do things
[1:05:00] completely different from us might
[1:05:02] actually be a way for us to to change
[1:05:05] and be cut in a way that God would want
[1:05:08] us so we could fit in not into the
[1:05:10] church so much as fit in to the to the
[1:05:12] family of God, to the house of God,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; to the people of God. So because the
[1:05:17] stones looked different, the masons
[1:05:20] fussed one with another. But now look,
[1:05:24] but when the stones came together, they
[1:05:27] made exactly the building that God
[1:05:30] wanted.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Now we know the masons are preachers,
[1:05:35] right? The stonemasons, I mean, not the
[1:05:37] Freemasons,
[1:05:38] but the stonemasons were preachers.
[1:05:42] They they were stone cutters, stone
[1:05:45] squarers, as the Bible puts it. So
[1:05:48] they're preachers. Now in 1 Corinthians
[1:05:50] chapter 3 and verse 9, you say, "Why are
[1:05:53] they preachers?" Because that's the way
[1:05:54] God chose to do it.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Right? I didn't do that. God did that.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 3:9, we are laborers
[1:06:01] together with God. You are God's
[1:06:04] husbandry. You are God's building.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Right? We should never forget that.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; You are God's building. You're not my
[1:06:11] building, you're God's building.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; So, everybody's not going to fit into my
[1:06:15] idea. Everybody's not going to fit into
[1:06:18] even what I can help them with.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Right? But some there there's something
[1:06:22] there's some ministry somewhere that can
[1:06:24] help you. There there's some something
[1:06:26] that God has for you. Many times we look
[1:06:29] at that and say, "Well, I'm not getting
[1:06:31] I'm not getting fed." And maybe we look
[1:06:33] at somebody else and say, "Well, they
[1:06:34] must not be getting fed either." But
[1:06:36] that may not necessarily be the case
[1:06:38] because there's some people who could
[1:06:39] never sit under a ministry like mine. I
[1:06:41] realize that I wasn't called to preach
[1:06:43] to everybody. But if you were if I was
[1:06:45] called to preach to you even for a
[1:06:48] season of your life, then there'll be
[1:06:49] something inside that'll respond to the
[1:06:52] word,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; right? Even if you're not a loud person,
[1:06:55] you may not say amen or raise your hand,
[1:06:57] but there'll be something inside that is
[1:06:59] convicted by the word and changed by the
[1:07:02] word and things are made different in
[1:07:03] your life.
[1:07:06] But so Paul says, "According to the
[1:07:09] grace of God, which is given unto me as
[1:07:10] a wise master builder, I have laid the
[1:07:14] foundation, and another buildeth
[1:07:16] thereon. Let every man take heed how he
[1:07:19] buildeth thereon." He goes on to say,
[1:07:21] "Some men build with hay, and some men
[1:07:23] build with combustible materials, but
[1:07:25] others build with the jewels of God and
[1:07:27] with the right kind of stones." So,
[1:07:30] brother Brandham taught us that actually
[1:07:32] he said confessions are stones or we
[1:07:35] could say it like this maybe people who
[1:07:37] have made confessions,
[1:07:40] right? So, when you confess Christ, when
[1:07:43] you believe on Christ, you're you're a
[1:07:45] stone that God can work with.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe, then there's
[1:07:50] nothing there to work with. But if you
[1:07:52] believe, if you confess that Jesus is
[1:07:55] God, then God can begin to work on you.
[1:07:58] Yes,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; we find that in Peter's confession that
[1:08:00] he made. But what what good is a stone
[1:08:04] if there isn't a stonemason? Brother
[1:08:05] says to there to shape him into a son of
[1:08:08] God. He said, "You're just piling up a
[1:08:11] bunch of rocks." Is that right? It isn't
[1:08:14] doing a bit of good. You see, he said,
[1:08:16] "The water we wear away the stone." See,
[1:08:17] that's right. That's the people. He
[1:08:19] said, "What good is stones if you
[1:08:20] haven't got a true stonemason with a
[1:08:23] good sharp tool to shape him into the
[1:08:25] fitting place in the house of God?" And
[1:08:27] so I I want to, you know, kind of
[1:08:30] introduce to this what we're talking
[1:08:31] about to this idea of just because we
[1:08:34] don't like what's being preached doesn't
[1:08:37] mean we don't need it.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Right? Do you ever think of that?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; I know there are people and I I've met
[1:08:46] people who are none of you are this way.
[1:08:48] I don't I don't believe. But I have met
[1:08:50] people who will only their ears only
[1:08:52] perk up when they hear a certain kind of
[1:08:54] preaching,
[1:08:56] right? And so they'll maybe it's real
[1:08:58] evangelistic preaching or some like
[1:08:59] teaching like really really educated
[1:09:02] intellectual teaching. And so when they
[1:09:04] hear that kind of preaching, their ears
[1:09:07] prick up and they begin to listen and
[1:09:09] they kind of shut everything else out
[1:09:11] and they sit there and say, "Well, you
[1:09:12] know, it's another service and another
[1:09:14] time and I really wish I could hear
[1:09:16] brother so and so preach because then he
[1:09:17] would explain this to me then it would
[1:09:19] make sense what the brother's saying."
[1:09:21] But many times what we need to hear
[1:09:23] isn't what we want to hear. Right? And
[1:09:27] it may not even fit in our natural uh
[1:09:29] ability of hearing, but there's
[1:09:31] something that we need. And God knows
[1:09:33] what we need.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And so, he's able to take me or take
[1:09:36] brother Joel or brother Stewart or able
[1:09:38] to take one of the brothers we have in
[1:09:39] Brother Nathan last week. He's able,
[1:09:41] Brother Nathan had a way of saying
[1:09:43] things that I just can't put it like
[1:09:44] that, right? There's nothing in me to
[1:09:47] preach like that. And yet, Brother
[1:09:48] Nathan's completely different from
[1:09:50] Brother Andrew Glover or somebody like
[1:09:51] that. So, you look at that and think or
[1:09:53] Brother Window Martin. You look at the
[1:09:55] differences in the ministry. You say,
[1:09:57] "Well, uh, here's a brother that can
[1:09:58] really, really lay it in. That's what I
[1:10:00] like." But maybe what we need to hear is
[1:10:02] what we're hearing. I believe God cares
[1:10:04] enough about us that he'll send the
[1:10:06] right people at the right time. He'll
[1:10:08] put us in the right pile, so to speak,
[1:10:11] so we can hear what God wants us to
[1:10:13] hear. He's allowed you to be in this
[1:10:15] pile of rocks this morning. Not just so
[1:10:17] we could come together, but so we could
[1:10:19] be cut into what God wants us to be. I
[1:10:22] say, God, let me be cut. Let me be
[1:10:24] shaped. Let me be changed.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; He said, I just want to ask you, what
[1:10:35] good's decisions? What good are you
[1:10:37] putting your name on the book? What good
[1:10:38] is come join the church if the
[1:10:40] stonemason isn't there that'll shape
[1:10:42] that? And it's kind of interesting here.
[1:10:45] He said, "Make them quit this and that.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Cut them. Make them over this way.
[1:10:50] square them up and make them like
[1:10:52] Christians that sits in the house of God
[1:10:54] with signs following the believers.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He said that's end time evangelism
[1:10:59] taking the stones and shaping them.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But now every stonemason didn't get to
[1:11:05] just cut how he wanted.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; But he's cutting according to the
[1:11:09] pattern,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; right? He's cutting according to the
[1:11:12] word. So I don't get to just come out
[1:11:14] here and chop things, you know, and and
[1:11:17] just use a broad sword and just cut. I
[1:11:19] see this is a problem, so I just cut it
[1:11:22] off, kill it, whatever that I don't get
[1:11:24] to do that, right? What I get to do is I
[1:11:26] have to be inspired to preach, right?
[1:11:29] There's got to be something. So, I get
[1:11:30] along with God and pray and these other
[1:11:32] brothers do the same thing. What can I
[1:11:33] bring to the young people? What can I
[1:11:35] bring to the elders? What can I bring to
[1:11:36] the church that would be a help to the
[1:11:38] church? I don't want to just preach. I I
[1:11:40] want to follow the blueprint. I want to
[1:11:42] make sure it's in the word. It's got to
[1:11:43] be in the word,
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; right? Because if I go to cutting things
[1:11:46] that aren't in the word, I get in
[1:11:48] trouble.
[1:11:49] Right? Because I may only cut a part of
[1:11:51] it and someone else may cut another
[1:11:53] part. But if I get to cutting outside
[1:11:54] the word, you're never going to fit in
[1:11:56] his building because his building is
[1:11:59] 100% the word.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; It come from his thoughts, from his
[1:12:02] mind.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So end time
[1:12:06] evangelism is is me being inspired to a
[1:12:09] portion of the word and preaching that
[1:12:11] to the people. And remember Noah Noah
[1:12:14] had to cut a certain part. He had a
[1:12:16] certain thing to preach. And they said,
[1:12:17] "Why are you preaching the same thing
[1:12:19] over and over, but it was Noah's job to
[1:12:22] cut that way. That was his job to
[1:12:24] preach. Every one of us have got a job
[1:12:25] to do. We got something to cut on. We
[1:12:28] got something we can we can be a part of
[1:12:30] and something that that that we need."
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope we're hearing it this
[1:12:34] morning.
[1:12:36] Good.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually makes a
[1:12:39] statement, excuse me, makes a statement
[1:12:41] that the stones would actually be better
[1:12:44] off
[1:12:45] left where they were
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; than gathered together if they were not
[1:12:50] shaped.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Look it up. He said they'd be better off
[1:12:56] if they weren't going to be shaped to be
[1:12:59] left. He said, "Because they might be
[1:13:01] useful
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; somewhere else, but if you're going to
[1:13:05] if we're going to come together, we got
[1:13:08] to let the word shape us."
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham said, "They've got
[1:13:12] to be cut
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; and fit into the program of God by gifts
[1:13:17] and callings
[1:13:19] and placed into the church as they
[1:13:22] should be must be." So God didn't limit
[1:13:26] that just to a prophet, right? Even a
[1:13:30] prophet has to stay with the word.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Brother said the way you know he's a
[1:13:35] prophet is by saying what a previous
[1:13:36] prophet said,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; right? So you don't just get to make it
[1:13:40] up,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; But the prophet what he he's a he's a
[1:13:44] stone cutter for the age. But God also
[1:13:47] called pastors.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Huh? God called evangelists. God called
[1:13:52] apostles. God called teachers. He called
[1:13:54] him what for? To cut in a particular way
[1:13:59] out of this group that's been cut out by
[1:14:01] the message. There are ministry. There's
[1:14:04] ministries that's meant to cut in a
[1:14:06] particular way within the the the
[1:14:09] framework of that message. Are you with
[1:14:11] me now?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; So within the framework, it has to stay
[1:14:13] within the message. It's got we got to
[1:14:15] say what he said. But but yet we have a
[1:14:17] unique way and and a local church is
[1:14:20] sovereign in that. a local pastor who's
[1:14:22] sovereign in that in the way that the
[1:14:24] stones are cut in that particular place.
[1:14:26] Now, brother Ram said they got to be cut
[1:14:28] by gifts and callings. Again, he said,
[1:14:30] "What good is a stone without a
[1:14:32] stonemason with the sharp word of God to
[1:14:34] cut him into a son of God or daughter of
[1:14:35] God and place him in the church where he
[1:14:37] belongs?" Rolling up stones won't make
[1:14:40] the building. You got to cut them and
[1:14:42] shape them. Yeah.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "We need men today, anointed
[1:14:47] men like Amos was that would cut the
[1:14:49] world away from that woman." He said,
[1:14:51] "Make her a daughter of God. Cut that
[1:14:52] world away from the man regardless of
[1:14:55] how many trustees throw him out." I
[1:14:57] thank God for good trustees. Today's
[1:14:59] Brother Bill's birthday and I'm
[1:15:00] preaching on trustees, but thank God for
[1:15:02] good trustees. But he said regardless
[1:15:04] how many trustees throw him out or
[1:15:05] anything else, he would stand on thus
[1:15:07] sayeth the Lord.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And he preached the gospel because
[1:15:10] that's his business. That's right.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; See, we're not in the business of piling
[1:15:16] up rocks.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Though I love to see them. I'd like to
[1:15:19] see a great big pile of rocks,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; right? Empty pews didn't ever inspire
[1:15:24] anybody,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; right? But I'd like to see a great big
[1:15:28] pile of rocks, but that's not our
[1:15:30] business.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Our business is not seeing how many
[1:15:32] rocks we can pile up,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; but the ones that God give us. That's
[1:15:36] right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Because there's some that I can't do
[1:15:40] anything for.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; There's some that Brother Joel could
[1:15:44] never touch or I could never touch. We
[1:15:46] could never do anything for. But God's
[1:15:48] called us to do something for the ones
[1:15:50] we're preaching to.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Right? And it's important that we
[1:15:55] realize that there's a particular stone
[1:15:57] cutter that is cutting a particular
[1:16:00] stone, a peculiar stone for a particular
[1:16:04] place. And it's important that we don't
[1:16:06] use our influence
[1:16:08] to bring other stones into our pile more
[1:16:12] than what we can cut.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right? That's why I don't believe in
[1:16:17] prociding. I know some of y'all come
[1:16:19] from different churches and I appreciate
[1:16:21] you choosing to come here. We have an
[1:16:23] open door policy. You come where you
[1:16:25] feel led to come
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; and go where you feel led to go. Listen,
[1:16:28] this isn't a cult. If you decide to go
[1:16:30] somewhere else, I I'll pray for you just
[1:16:32] as much as I ever did. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's that's just what
[1:16:36] we are. I don't believe in that nonsense
[1:16:38] of trying to hold people. We I preach if
[1:16:40] there's five people here, I preach to
[1:16:42] five people. Or if there's 500. I
[1:16:44] believe God has given us a great
[1:16:45] responsibility, but we're not in the
[1:16:47] business of holding people. If God
[1:16:49] called them to be in our particular
[1:16:50] pile, then let's shape what we've got.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Let's work with what we've got.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; There's so many men by influence. And I
[1:17:00] see that even in the message, but
[1:17:02] especially in denominational circles by
[1:17:05] influencer trying to pull one away cuz
[1:17:07] he's a big tithe payer. Pull this one
[1:17:09] because he's got this uh gift or that
[1:17:12] gift and and I would love to have all
[1:17:14] the gifts, you know, just pile. But you
[1:17:16] can't use them all,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; there's a place,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; right? There's somewhere you can be a
[1:17:23] help.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; There's somewhere you can make a
[1:17:26] difference. And if you're here, I
[1:17:28] believe that place is here.
[1:17:30] If you're here listening to me this
[1:17:31] morning, I mean, there's a difference
[1:17:32] you can make for our young people.
[1:17:34] There's a difference you can make. I'm
[1:17:36] not trying to take over your life or
[1:17:37] make you work, but if if there's an
[1:17:39] opportunity here, there's opportunity to
[1:17:41] help out with the young people. There's
[1:17:43] opportunity to be a part of the worship.
[1:17:44] There's opportunity to be a part if you
[1:17:46] young men, maybe you feel a call of God
[1:17:48] in your heart to preach you. There's
[1:17:50] opportunity for that, but you need to
[1:17:52] grow up in the fear and admonition of
[1:17:53] the Lord and and wait on your ministry
[1:17:55] and things, but there's opportunity for
[1:17:57] that one day.
[1:17:59] You see our young men and becoming
[1:18:01] something in their life. I I I'm proud
[1:18:03] of some of them. I really am. And but
[1:18:05] you see the differences even in them.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Some are reluctant and some are shy and
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; some at certain stages in their life,
[1:18:14] they're only interested in certain
[1:18:16] things, you know. Others are just
[1:18:18] interested in people, good with people.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I uh man, he's looking at me, so I'm
[1:18:26] going to call him out. But uh Maddie,
[1:18:29] I've watched Mattie in our uh in our uh
[1:18:32] banquet and anytime we get the kids
[1:18:34] together, Matt's a star
[1:18:38] and and and he is in a good way.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He he he leads people. And I you'll see
[1:18:43] that I don't know what God's going to do
[1:18:44] in Matney's life, but I'll say this. Let
[1:18:47] God shape you.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Let God shape you. Don't don't just
[1:18:54] don't don't don't discount what God
[1:18:56] might do in your life.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Look, I didn't I wouldn't have put
[1:19:02] myself where I'm at.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I was a peculiar stone
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; for a particular place.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And it works because God put it
[1:19:12] together.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We can't put it
[1:19:15] together ourselves. It works because God
[1:19:17] puts it together. We can't make these
[1:19:19] young men preachers or these young
[1:19:20] ladies preachers wives or or deacons or
[1:19:23] deacons wife. We can't do that. But if
[1:19:25] God put that in your heart, there's
[1:19:26] something there that you can do it.
[1:19:28] Something in your heart that you you
[1:19:29] know there's something there. You want
[1:19:31] to help people. And I say don't limit
[1:19:33] God. Let God You may be different from
[1:19:35] the other deacons. That don't mean
[1:19:36] you're not called.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You may be different from the other
[1:19:40] preachers. That don't mean you're not
[1:19:41] called,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You may lead songs differently than
[1:19:45] somebody else. That don't mean you're
[1:19:47] not supposed to do it. Just do what God
[1:19:49] called you to do. Be what God called you
[1:19:51] to be. I want to encourage our young
[1:19:53] people with that. Just because you can't
[1:19:55] sing like somebody else don't mean you
[1:19:57] shouldn't sing. Just because you can't
[1:19:59] clap like somebody else don't mean you
[1:20:00] shouldn't clap. Just because you you you
[1:20:03] don't Maybe that's a bad analogy. Just
[1:20:04] because you don't uh play like somebody
[1:20:06] else don't mean you shouldn't play.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You should do what God wants you to do.
[1:20:13] And there's something you can do that'll
[1:20:15] be a benefit to the house of God.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want just listen, just
[1:20:21] because a man's a man of God doesn't
[1:20:23] mean he knows the will of God for your
[1:20:25] life.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon taught us to be wary
[1:20:28] of men that had all the answers,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; right? Somebody come up and say, "I know
[1:20:34] what you should do." I had a young man
[1:20:35] tell me one time, he may be listening, I
[1:20:37] don't know, but listen to this, but he
[1:20:38] told me, he said, "Brother Ben, if you
[1:20:40] tell me to move to go to your church,"
[1:20:42] he said, "I will." I said, "Brother, I'm
[1:20:45] not going to do that.
[1:20:47] I'm not going to do that.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Because if I tell you to move, then I'm
[1:20:51] responsible for you.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; This might not be the place for you.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But if you if you if you want to move,
[1:20:57] let it let God do the moving."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Huh? And he's being used in another
[1:21:03] place, in another way. Man, I'm glad for
[1:21:04] that. I'm happy for that. It's important
[1:21:07] that we don't we don't press on people
[1:21:09] into something that even brother
[1:21:11] Brandham dealt with that that the people
[1:21:13] he said that a bunch of preachers got
[1:21:14] around him and said, "You can do it,
[1:21:15] brother Brandham. You can do it, brother
[1:21:16] Brandham."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Remember and he overexlained the second
[1:21:20] pole
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; and he said it brought a bunch of carnal
[1:21:23] impersonations
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; because he tried to explain it. This is
[1:21:27] how you do it. He said he got the line
[1:21:28] all tangled around him. He said the
[1:21:31] angel said, "You don't want your line
[1:21:32] tangled in these kind of times."
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So, we're not trying to force somebody
[1:21:36] into something. We We just want to
[1:21:38] preach and let God do what God does. And
[1:21:40] we just want to be what God We just want
[1:21:42] to be happy in the house of God. I don't
[1:21:44] want to see people miserable in God's
[1:21:45] house. Let's be happy in the house of
[1:21:47] God. Even if we're hearing something,
[1:21:49] maybe we think, Lord, why why would he
[1:21:50] the preacher preach that, but it must be
[1:21:52] for me, Lord. There must be something
[1:21:54] there I can attain to, something I can
[1:21:56] grab a hold of. Lord, I thank you for
[1:21:58] your word.
[1:22:00] Amen.
[1:22:02] A man, you know, he might be a good
[1:22:04] salesman. That don't mean he has the
[1:22:05] will of God.
[1:22:08] You remember the prophet that went out
[1:22:10] one time, and I'm running out of time,
[1:22:12] and I'm not nearly done, but I'll quit.
[1:22:14] I promise at some point.
[1:22:19] But there was a prophet who'd come by
[1:22:22] and and he was had a job to do, a young
[1:22:25] prophet. He had a certain job to do. And
[1:22:28] the Lord told him, "Don't stop."
[1:22:30] Right? And and the Lord and an old
[1:22:33] prophet, the Lord told him what to do,
[1:22:36] too. And it would be a test to the young
[1:22:37] prophet.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; And the old prophet was doing the will
[1:22:40] of the Lord.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Telling the young prophet to stop. But
[1:22:45] the Bible said he respected him so much
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; that he stopped. He went to eat at his
[1:22:50] house. And the old prophet rose up and
[1:22:52] said, "Cuz you didn't do what the Lord
[1:22:53] told you to do."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll be eaten by a lion."
[1:22:57] That's pretty gruesome, isn't it?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Huh? But it's important to do the will
[1:23:00] of God.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Just because it's an old prophet or just
[1:23:03] because it's a a good man or just
[1:23:05] because he's he's a man of God don't
[1:23:06] mean he knows the will of God for your
[1:23:08] life.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You do what God called you to do. See,
[1:23:11] the Bible said the steps of a good man
[1:23:13] are ordered by the Lord.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Ordered by the Lord. And he delightth
[1:23:18] his in his way. Listen. Oh, I love this.
[1:23:21] He delightth. Listen. The Lord delights
[1:23:24] in the way of a of a good man. a born
[1:23:27] again man. Listen, you young people that
[1:23:28] are starting out and maybe you don't
[1:23:30] know what job to do or you don't know
[1:23:32] exactly what the future's going to hold
[1:23:34] for you. Remember that that God the
[1:23:36] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:23:39] Lord.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I look at my kids and Peter, you know,
[1:23:42] he's working in a grocery store right
[1:23:44] now. I think he's in the back. I can't
[1:23:45] see him behind that screen, but Peter's
[1:23:47] working at a grocery store right now.
[1:23:49] Brother Robert, I never intended that
[1:23:50] for Peter.
[1:23:52] And I don't know if that's what his
[1:23:53] future holds. Who knows? But you know
[1:23:56] what? God has a way of ordering steps
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; to meet the right people at the right
[1:24:02] time.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; I'm just comfortable this morning. Y'all
[1:24:07] forgive me. But I got when we got
[1:24:09] married, you know, when I met my wife, I
[1:24:12] had nothing. And and I'm not I had less
[1:24:14] than nothing.
[1:24:18] I I was a poor man in fellowship with
[1:24:19] poor people. You know, whether JT
[1:24:22] remembers or some of y'all, Brother Bill
[1:24:23] remembers, and I I was poor. I remember
[1:24:25] I ran out of gas one time in West Plains
[1:24:27] and JT had to come give me gas and and
[1:24:31] because I the reason I run out of gas
[1:24:33] cuz my gas gauge didn't work. And the
[1:24:35] car cost $700. You'd think they'd put a
[1:24:37] working gas gauge in it,
[1:24:40] but you know, I didn't know what I was
[1:24:44] going to do.
[1:24:45] I just living life, you know, and not
[1:24:47] worrying too much about it. Maybe I
[1:24:48] should have been more concerned looking
[1:24:51] back at it, but I didn't know. I worked
[1:24:53] part-time at Burger King and preached.
[1:24:55] That's what I did.
[1:24:58] And some of y'all laughing because you
[1:25:00] know that ain't much money.
[1:25:04] And so I didn't have nothing. I didn't
[1:25:05] at the time I when I first, you know,
[1:25:08] met my wife, I didn't have a car. I had
[1:25:10] was driving somebody else's car. I was
[1:25:12] living in a little shack like a trailer
[1:25:14] that somebody had made for preachers.
[1:25:16] And I was living in that and I was just
[1:25:18] happy to do what I was doing, preaching
[1:25:20] on the weekends and working three or
[1:25:21] four days a week. And boy, I was just so
[1:25:23] happy, you know, and I met my wife and
[1:25:25] said, "Lord, what am I going to do now?"
[1:25:27] God put her great aunt told uh told me
[1:25:29] one day said, she said, "You need a
[1:25:31] better job."
[1:25:33] And she said, "I I know a company's
[1:25:35] looking for somebody to do something and
[1:25:37] it's title works working for an
[1:25:38] attorney." Well, I I always wanted to be
[1:25:39] an attorney, but I knew I didn't have
[1:25:41] the education to work for one. And I
[1:25:43] thought, well, I can't do that. And I
[1:25:45] went I remember going to the job
[1:25:46] interview and I went and sat in the job
[1:25:48] interview with Harvey Allen who's a
[1:25:49] judge up here now in the job interview
[1:25:51] did not go well
[1:25:54] and he looked at me and basically told
[1:25:56] me I wouldn't get the job. Two weeks
[1:25:58] later, they called me and wanted me to
[1:26:00] come in and I got that job and I stayed
[1:26:03] in that job for in in in not the same
[1:26:05] office but in that particular job for 15
[1:26:08] years doing land title examinations and
[1:26:10] made a career out of it and and and I
[1:26:13] couldn't have picked that. Listen, the
[1:26:15] steps of a good man are ordered of the
[1:26:18] Lord
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; and he delights in his way.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; See, by by worry, you can't put yourself
[1:26:25] in a certain position. You may not be
[1:26:27] cut out even to do what you're wanting
[1:26:28] to do. Don't worry about it. Let God do
[1:26:30] what God does. You just work when the
[1:26:33] opportunity presents itself to work. It
[1:26:35] won't matter. You know, some people are
[1:26:36] waiting so much on a good job that they
[1:26:38] failed to take the job that God gave
[1:26:40] them.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Right? Let's just do what God allows us
[1:26:44] to do. There's a reason why he put us in
[1:26:46] the spot that we're in right now.
[1:26:48] There's a reason. It may not be the best
[1:26:50] thing in the world, but there's a reason
[1:26:52] for it.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; The steps are Do we believe that or
[1:26:55] don't we? The steps of a good man are
[1:26:56] ordered by the Lord. Many of you got
[1:26:58] testimonies like that. You didn't end up
[1:27:00] doing what you started doing.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; But the steps of a good man are ordered
[1:27:04] by the Lord. And he delightth in his
[1:27:07] way.
[1:27:12] We worry about it. And I remember one
[1:27:13] time, I've told you this before, but I
[1:27:15] was worried so worried about my job
[1:27:16] because I had gotten into a bad office
[1:27:18] and and my boss was a a cruel man
[1:27:21] really.
[1:27:23] and he trouble and I was so stressed
[1:27:25] out. I thought, Lord, you hear I've been
[1:27:28] praying about getting another job. I got
[1:27:30] to work and I can't got to provide for
[1:27:32] my family and I was stressed out and
[1:27:34] praying about it and one day I went to
[1:27:37] delete my spam email and I just
[1:27:39] something stopped. I never I never read
[1:27:41] it and something stopped me and I went
[1:27:43] and looked again. And I began to look
[1:27:45] through it and for the last 3 months
[1:27:48] since I had been praying, there had been
[1:27:51] a job offer in my email.
[1:27:55] Went to my spam folder and it was
[1:27:56] already waiting on me. And I went and
[1:27:58] took that job and was there for years
[1:28:01] and and been they they still wanted me
[1:28:03] to come even after that amount of time
[1:28:05] had elapsed. But sometimes we just limit
[1:28:07] God. We don't realize he's working for
[1:28:09] our good. And if he's kind of if we find
[1:28:12] ourselves stuck somewhere, it's probably
[1:28:14] because he needed us stuck,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; But see, a a good stone cutter's got to
[1:28:22] have a vision,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; See, there's a mystery that lays within
[1:28:26] the rock,
[1:28:28] right? So, every rock has a mystery.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Like Michelangelo did with the marble.
[1:28:34] There was a mystery.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And the mystery was in the mind, excuse
[1:28:39] me, of the of the creator o of the of
[1:28:42] the sculptor, but he had to he had to
[1:28:46] take it and put it into action. He had
[1:28:48] to cut it and even injure it to really
[1:28:52] get it to speak to say what he wanted it
[1:28:55] to say.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; See, that's what we've got to do.
[1:28:58] Brother Brandham could have had the
[1:29:00] largest church in the world
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; if he was interested in building
[1:29:03] churches. But he wasn't interested in
[1:29:06] just building a church. He wanted to see
[1:29:08] people built into the sons and daughters
[1:29:10] of God.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not for one moment do I bring
[1:29:13] a message to the people that they may
[1:29:15] follow me or join my church or start
[1:29:17] some fellowship and organization." I've
[1:29:19] never done that. Will not do that now. I
[1:29:21] have no interest in those things. But I
[1:29:23] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:29:25] and people. I believe it do us good to
[1:29:26] get back to the basics. Let's have an
[1:29:28] interest in the things of God and
[1:29:30] people. And if I can accomplish just one
[1:29:32] thing, I will be satisfied. That one
[1:29:35] thing is to see establish a true
[1:29:37] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:29:39] men wherein men become new creations in
[1:29:41] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[1:29:43] according to the word. How many want to
[1:29:45] do that today? I want to be a new
[1:29:47] creation. I I don't want to just be a
[1:29:48] stone, a rock.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; I want to be what God has built.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of the building.
[1:29:56] Brother Brandon makes this statement. He
[1:29:57] said, "If I seen every person come to
[1:29:59] this tabernacle, walk out and go to Don
[1:30:02] Ruddle or JT Parnell or these brother
[1:30:04] that's our brothers here and fellow
[1:30:05] citizens of the kingdom." He said, "I'd
[1:30:07] be so happy. I wouldn't know what to
[1:30:09] do."
[1:30:11] I'd say, "Lord, fill this one back up
[1:30:13] again.
[1:30:15] Let's pour it out and fill up another
[1:30:17] one." I know some of you sitting there
[1:30:18] saying, "Who's leaving?" Nobody's
[1:30:20] leaving.
[1:30:24] But he said, "I'd love to see those
[1:30:26] boys. They're my children. He wasn't
[1:30:28] building a cult,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; some cult.
[1:30:32] If you can just leave whenever you want
[1:30:34] to leave, you know,
[1:30:36] he wasn't building a cult or a kingdom.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; What was he? I believe he was a master
[1:30:40] builder like Paul
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; finishing the work that Paul began.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:47] And somehow we got it into our heads
[1:30:49] that everybody needs our particular
[1:30:51] ministry.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; They don't.
[1:30:55] Huh? They just don't.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But we're pre-ordained. And I believe
[1:30:59] God leads us in that manner to be taught
[1:31:02] by certain people at certain moments in
[1:31:04] our lives.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And maybe even later, it wouldn't work.
[1:31:07] I've had pastors that helped me, but
[1:31:10] later on maybe I couldn't even sit under
[1:31:11] their ministry, but it was God bringing
[1:31:14] me through a time in my life and things
[1:31:16] that that would help me. And so,
[1:31:18] different men use different tools to do
[1:31:20] the job. I want to get to this before we
[1:31:22] close. Look at this next slide. I
[1:31:24] believe those are stone cutting tools.
[1:31:27] Look at the difference in size. Those
[1:31:29] are ancient stone cutting tools similar
[1:31:31] to what would have been used in the
[1:31:33] temple. There's a there's a sledgehammer
[1:31:37] of sorts
[1:31:39] there. There's a knife.
[1:31:41] I I don't know what they use the horn
[1:31:42] there for. Not sure. They that there's a
[1:31:46] uh what must be like a level. It looks
[1:31:48] like there are little bitty picks,
[1:31:51] little bitty chisels,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; all used for the purpose of cutting
[1:31:56] stones,
[1:31:57] but different gifts. See, sometimes God
[1:32:00] calls a sledgehammer gift to an area
[1:32:03] because that's what God needs at that
[1:32:05] time,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; right? And he just goes in and and raise
[1:32:09] that thing way back and slams it and the
[1:32:12] pieces fly everywhere.
[1:32:15] Other times they need a very small
[1:32:17] chisel
[1:32:18] or even sandpaper,
[1:32:21] maybe just a cloth. So you can imagine,
[1:32:24] if you can imagine, why did the builders
[1:32:26] fuss, right? Why did the builders fuss?
[1:32:30] Well, because one of them is using that
[1:32:31] big old hammer.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Right. And another one's using that
[1:32:35] little bitty pick
[1:32:37] and he's sitting over there saying,
[1:32:38] "Boy, if he was more like me, he'd get
[1:32:39] more done."
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:44] Oh my. But see, the way it works in
[1:32:46] ministry is you don't get to make
[1:32:48] yourself into what whatever you want to
[1:32:50] be,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; God made you what you are,
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; right? And mold you into what he wants
[1:32:55] you to be. So you may never be a small
[1:32:58] little pick or little chisel, but yet
[1:33:01] you're a part of the economy of God. You
[1:33:03] may belong in the finishing work, or you
[1:33:06] may belong right there. I've seen
[1:33:07] ministries that were so good at getting
[1:33:09] people to the message or getting young
[1:33:11] people saved. But if you put them in a
[1:33:13] church as a pastor, they'd never be able
[1:33:15] to do it.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; But it's it's no it's no shame on them.
[1:33:19] It's what God called them to do.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; See what in explaining that from the art
[1:33:27] ofmaking.com. They explained what that
[1:33:29] was back then. Exactly what tool a
[1:33:31] carver will use for a particular process
[1:33:35] will depend on the stone being worked.
[1:33:38] the final effect sought and the carver's
[1:33:41] own training.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; So even two carvers with the same tool
[1:33:47] wouldn't cut the stone in the same way.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Because they had different
[1:33:52] training.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon puts it like this and
[1:33:54] it's pretty. He said, "Let a man go
[1:33:56] where God leads him to go."
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Because God knows how to mold us.
[1:34:01] He's talking about ministers there and
[1:34:04] and how they try to put a pet in a
[1:34:06] church and try to orchestrate those
[1:34:07] things. He said, "Let a man go where God
[1:34:09] leads him to go." God knows how to mold
[1:34:11] us using the gifts or tools he's placed
[1:34:13] on the earth. Ephesians 4:11. I'm not
[1:34:15] going to read that, brother Robert, but
[1:34:17] you find that he talks about the
[1:34:18] five-fold ministry. But the Brand said
[1:34:20] in the church, there's the pastor. The
[1:34:22] pastor is a special person. He's built
[1:34:24] where he can put up with the fusses of
[1:34:25] the people. He's a burden bearer. He's
[1:34:27] the ox of the team,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; right? But not everybody can be an ox.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And why would you want to be,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He said he's a man that can sit down
[1:34:38] when somebody's got something against
[1:34:39] somebody else, sit down with them two
[1:34:41] families, take either side, reason it
[1:34:43] out, bring it right back into sweetness.
[1:34:44] See, he's a pastor. He knows how to take
[1:34:46] care of things. He said the evangelist
[1:34:48] is a special man. He's a man that's
[1:34:50] burning like a fireball. He runs into a
[1:34:52] city and preaches his message and gets
[1:34:54] out there somewhere else. He He's a
[1:34:56] special man. We need evangelists in our
[1:34:58] day,
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; right? We need men that are burning like
[1:35:00] a fireball. Pastors, by definition,
[1:35:03] can't do that very often, right? If you
[1:35:06] did that all the time, it wouldn't work.
[1:35:08] But an evangelist can do it. The teacher
[1:35:09] is a special man. He sits back under the
[1:35:11] anointing of the spirit, is able to take
[1:35:12] the words, put them together by the Holy
[1:35:14] Spirit that the pastor or evangelist,
[1:35:16] either one, could not compare with him,
[1:35:19] he said. Then we find out the apostle is
[1:35:21] a special man. He's a setter in order.
[1:35:23] He's a man that sent from God to set
[1:35:25] things in order. I've worked with men
[1:35:27] like that overseas. I could never do
[1:35:29] what brother Robert Wilson does. I could
[1:35:31] never do what some of these other
[1:35:32] brothers do that go overseas and start
[1:35:34] churches. I couldn't do that. I can be a
[1:35:36] help, but I can't do what they do. Not a
[1:35:39] missionary. The prophet is a special
[1:35:41] man. Prophet is a man whom the word of
[1:35:43] the Lord comes to. Because a prophet is
[1:35:45] so designed in his life that his
[1:35:47] subconscious and his first conscious is
[1:35:49] so close together that he doesn't go to
[1:35:51] sleep to dream his dream. He sees it
[1:35:52] when he's wide awake. He said, "Now
[1:35:54] that's something God has to do, right?
[1:35:57] You can't make yourself a prophet.
[1:35:58] Neither can you make yourself a pastor
[1:35:59] or an evangelist.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He said, see, he sees what's going and
[1:36:04] and you find in the Bible, you know,
[1:36:07] illustrations of that. You'll find Paul
[1:36:11] Paul was a certain way
[1:36:13] and he was a writer of scripture, but he
[1:36:16] had a certain mentality when it come to
[1:36:18] work and the gospel. And remember,
[1:36:20] Barnabas was there to bring Paul into
[1:36:23] the into the church. If it hadn't been
[1:36:25] for Barnabas, nobody would have ever
[1:36:27] accepted Paul. God put Barnabas in
[1:36:29] Paul's life.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; But when they got to a certain point,
[1:36:33] they got to arguing and fussing. And the
[1:36:36] reason was because Mark Mark was
[1:36:39] Barnabas's nephew.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; And he got homesick for mama decided to
[1:36:44] leave the mission field. And Paul just
[1:36:46] wasn't built like that,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; right? Paul's just straight ahead 100
[1:36:50] miles an hour. He's just not built like
[1:36:52] that. And so he they feuded over it and
[1:36:55] they went their separate ways.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Years later, Paul writes, and I'm glad
[1:37:00] he did because otherwise you'd wonder
[1:37:01] what ever happened.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Paul writes, he said, he said, "Bring
[1:37:04] Mark with you." He said, "He's
[1:37:06] profitable to me
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; for the ministry." He realized that Mark
[1:37:09] did have a place.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; But God used Paul to write the scripture
[1:37:12] and he used Mark to write the scripture.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have the Gospel of Mark
[1:37:16] unless Paul probably had sent Mark home
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; and and parted ways with him. But we got
[1:37:23] the Gospel of Mark out of that. I say
[1:37:24] thank God that there could be different
[1:37:26] men with different ideas and and working
[1:37:28] in different areas, but we can all come
[1:37:30] together as long as we can realize that
[1:37:32] God's in charge of it all.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "What a wonderful
[1:37:36] picture it gets us because it's a type
[1:37:37] of God placing in the church himself.
[1:37:39] Every member." So it's not just
[1:37:41] preachers. Every member, every stone,
[1:37:44] every place, every Christian to itself,
[1:37:48] each one of us in our peculiar way. Yes.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Right. Has a place in the house of God.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:00] He said when they brought them all the
[1:38:01] rocks in there, he said all these odd
[1:38:03] rocks had their place when the temple
[1:38:06] went together.
[1:38:07] And I think that God down through this
[1:38:09] time has cut out some very odd stones
[1:38:12] that we might not have understood, but
[1:38:15] they have their place exactly in the
[1:38:18] temple in the building of God. Right?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to watch something
[1:38:24] as we're turning a corner now.
[1:38:28] The closer you get to the completion of
[1:38:30] the temple,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; the odder the rocks get.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Right? because you're I'm not a stone
[1:38:44] layer or work with stone or brick or
[1:38:46] anything like that, but but if you're
[1:38:48] building a building, but you put in them
[1:38:50] odd pieces last, it's like a puzzle,
[1:38:53] right? You put together a puzzle, that
[1:38:56] odd, misunderstood piece,
[1:38:59] you you can't see where it goes. Maybe
[1:39:00] it's got several different colors on it
[1:39:02] and you just can't see it.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And and then the last the last one comes
[1:39:08] in.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And it fits that hole
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; what was needed. But you'd have never
[1:39:17] put it there.
[1:39:19] Right? So the Bible tells us that the
[1:39:22] stone which the builders refused.
[1:39:26] In other words, it was so odd that they
[1:39:28] could not see a place
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; where it would fit.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's become the headstone of
[1:39:34] the corner."
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous
[1:39:37] in our eyes. And this stone would not
[1:39:40] make sense because remember if they're
[1:39:42] building maybe this stone cutter, he's
[1:39:46] only got a part of the blueprint,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; right, that's revealed to him and he's
[1:39:51] working off of that part, right? And and
[1:39:53] maybe in with a partial blueprint, he
[1:39:56] can't see what's going to happen. That's
[1:39:59] why you you you you realize that the
[1:40:01] builders didn't see that the stone that
[1:40:04] they rejected was actually the most
[1:40:06] important stone. Look, Isaiah 28:16,
[1:40:10] "Therefore, thus sayith the Lord God,
[1:40:11] behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a
[1:40:13] stone, a tried stone, a precious
[1:40:16] cornerstone, a sure foundation. He that
[1:40:19] believeth shall not make haste." Isaiah
[1:40:21] 8:14 says, "He shall be for a
[1:40:23] sanctuary." In other words, he is the
[1:40:25] temple of God. But for a stone of
[1:40:28] stumbling, and for a rock of offense to
[1:40:31] both the houses of Israel, for a jin or
[1:40:34] trap, and for a snare to the inhabitants
[1:40:36] of Jerusalem, and many among them shall
[1:40:38] stumble and fall and be broken, and be
[1:40:41] snared and be taken. Why? Because they
[1:40:43] didn't have the stone in its proper
[1:40:45] place.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church.
[1:40:50] If if you don't put the stone in its
[1:40:52] proper place, you'll stumble over it.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; If if Christ doesn't have first place in
[1:41:01] your life, the message is going to
[1:41:03] bother you,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; you're going it going to feel like a a
[1:41:10] burden,
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; right? to hear it preached, to go to
[1:41:13] church.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; It's going to get hard.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to stumble over it because
[1:41:18] it don't belong on the ground.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; His place is the chief cornerstone.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; He doesn't belong on the ground. Us
[1:41:30] tripping over it.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; And many times what we do in our life is
[1:41:33] we we get to thinking, well, you know, I
[1:41:36] I just wish I could be normal and be
[1:41:38] like everybody else. But don't you
[1:41:39] realize that stone, that stone was not
[1:41:42] meant to be stumbled over. The stone
[1:41:44] that brought holiness to your life and
[1:41:45] and brought godliness. And though it
[1:41:47] wasn't meant to be stumbled over, it was
[1:41:49] oh God, it was meant to be put in its
[1:41:51] proper place.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And the reason people stumble over it is
[1:41:55] because they haven't lifted him up.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I want to lift him up
[1:41:59] in my life. If you're stumbling over the
[1:42:00] things in the message, if you're
[1:42:02] stumbling over what's preached in the
[1:42:03] house of God, maybe it's because you
[1:42:05] haven't put him in his proper place.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, you be the leader of my life. You
[1:42:11] be the headstone of the corner. You be
[1:42:13] the chief capstone of it all.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus testified he was that stone.
[1:42:20] Jesus said, "Did you never read in the
[1:42:22] scripture the stone which the builders
[1:42:24] rejected? The same has become the head
[1:42:25] of the corner. This is the Lord's doing.
[1:42:28] It's marvelous in our eyes. Peter
[1:42:30] testified the same thing when the lame
[1:42:31] man was healed. Acts 4:11, "This is the
[1:42:33] stone." He said, "The what's doing this
[1:42:36] is not some man." He said, "I didn't do
[1:42:38] it. John didn't do it. But this is the
[1:42:40] stone."
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which was said not of you
[1:42:45] builders, which has become the head of
[1:42:48] the corner, a peculiar stone for a
[1:42:52] particular place. As brother Nathan told
[1:42:54] the young people during the banquet, he
[1:42:56] said, "There's a hole in your heart that
[1:42:57] only God can fill."
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; A peculiar stone
[1:43:03] for a particular place.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon said a stone was
[1:43:08] cut this way and cut this way and cut
[1:43:09] this way, but they found that every
[1:43:11] stone slipped right to its place.
[1:43:15] And that's what I think about believers
[1:43:16] in God. Every one of us has a place in
[1:43:17] this building. We may not be just like
[1:43:19] the other one, but we got a place to
[1:43:21] place here. every born again Christians.
[1:43:25] He said, "Here's what's the matter with
[1:43:26] you builders, you minister sitting out
[1:43:28] there. Here's what's the matter. When
[1:43:29] they built the temple of Solomon, they
[1:43:30] started putting the temple up and they
[1:43:32] found a freak stone.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; They said, "We can't use that thing."
[1:43:36] Kicked it over in a weed pile.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; They went on building the building. They
[1:43:40] come to go, they got to end at the end
[1:43:41] of the road. They couldn't go any
[1:43:42] further. They had a hole in the wall
[1:43:44] that they couldn't make the rest of the
[1:43:45] building fit with.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, is that the way you feel in your
[1:43:48] life? Then you need that stone.
[1:43:51] Good.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Come to find out the very stone they
[1:43:54] rejected was the chief cornerstone.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I don't need that. That's old time. That
[1:44:01] that's I don't need that that worship. I
[1:44:03] don't need that. I don't need that
[1:44:04] praise. I don't need that that
[1:44:05] atmosphere. I don't need the Holy Ghost
[1:44:07] no more. I don't need the message of the
[1:44:09] I don't need to listen to them tapes.
[1:44:10] But the stone that you've rejected is
[1:44:12] actually the head of the corner.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; They said it's too odd to be used.
[1:44:18] There's no such a place. But come to
[1:44:20] find out, they had built the building so
[1:44:22] high until they missed the stone. And
[1:44:24] they didn't know where the stone was.
[1:44:25] They might have searched all the ships.
[1:44:27] They might have run through every ox
[1:44:28] cart. They might have said, "Messengers
[1:44:29] up into Jopets. They has another load
[1:44:31] come in. Did you lose one on the road?
[1:44:33] There's something wrong. We just can't
[1:44:34] find that stone for this place. And when
[1:44:36] they could not find it nowhere else,
[1:44:38] come to find out it was right on the
[1:44:40] ground. It was the chief cornerstone the
[1:44:43] builders rejected."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "I
[1:44:46] think that's been a great big failure
[1:44:48] today among the builders."
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; He said the denominational foundations
[1:44:53] were laid in sincerity, but as the
[1:44:55] building began to materialize, they
[1:44:56] realized that the hole that was left,
[1:44:58] the odd stone fitted to the dot.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; He said that's where the spiritual
[1:45:02] builders today. That's why the bride
[1:45:03] building of Christ is not ready for the
[1:45:05] bridegroom. It's because the builders
[1:45:06] has rejected the chief cornerstone that
[1:45:08] was laid on the day of Pentecost, which
[1:45:10] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It's been odd. People act funny and they
[1:45:14] don't come in the order of our
[1:45:15] psychology or educational or learning or
[1:45:18] creeds. It don't fit in there and they
[1:45:19] kicked it out because it was too odd,
[1:45:21] too peculiar, too disagreeable with the
[1:45:23] plans that we as men had.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Ideas of what the church ought to be.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Oh God. So they rejected the Holy Ghost
[1:45:32] because it didn't fit the idea. Yes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:45:40] Can we look at our own lives and see?
[1:45:43] I'm I'm trying to not just preach, but
[1:45:45] but minister what's on my heart this
[1:45:47] morning?
[1:45:49] Have we rejected the stone,
[1:45:54] the Holy Ghost that we needed?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Just left it there on the ground.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; It don't fit into our lives.
[1:46:02] They kicked it out because it's too odd,
[1:46:03] too peculiar, too disagreeable with the
[1:46:05] plans that they had, ideas of what the
[1:46:08] church ought to be, what our life ought
[1:46:09] to be. He said, "No, we already have the
[1:46:11] stones. The stones God for ordained.
[1:46:13] See, we've got them all the way from
[1:46:15] Ephesus to Leoa." He said, "We're only
[1:46:17] waiting for the headstone that the
[1:46:18] builders rejected. Waiting for his
[1:46:21] coming, the capping stone."
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He is the stone that makes up the
[1:46:26] building.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Brother talked about the pyramid. I
[1:46:29] stood there at the pyramid two two three
[1:46:31] years ago. Brother Joel and I stood
[1:46:32] there. Great big giant all them great
[1:46:34] stones that fit together with no mortar
[1:46:37] in between them. They just fit exactly
[1:46:39] together. Even after thousands of years,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; but it's missing the capstone.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; The top's missing off of it. Brother
[1:46:46] Brand said that capstone is Christ.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember he told Zerubbabel,
[1:46:52] we read it last week that Zerubbabel
[1:46:54] laid the foundation. His hand shall also
[1:46:56] finish it. Thou shalt know the Lord of
[1:46:57] hosts has sent me unto you. Listen, even
[1:46:59] the ministry of this age is a capstone
[1:47:01] ministry. Now listen, don't get it
[1:47:03] confused. Brother Brandham's not the
[1:47:04] capstone, but he preached the capstone
[1:47:06] message.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; He preached Christ.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; This ministry will end soon. He said the
[1:47:11] expected son will appear himself. The
[1:47:13] church has come from justification,
[1:47:14] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:16] Ghost, and now winding up to the
[1:47:17] headstone ministry, typing all the time
[1:47:19] right into that perfect negative shadow,
[1:47:21] becoming positive. Then Jesus will come
[1:47:24] to catch his church someday. those who
[1:47:26] believe. Do you believe it's about time
[1:47:27] for the headstone to sit fully down on
[1:47:30] the body?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] When Jesus returns, he'll find a church
[1:47:38] that's washed without spot or wrinkle.
[1:47:41] It'll be the same ministry he had. It'll
[1:47:43] bring back the headstone. Brother
[1:47:46] Brandham told the Pentecostal people, he
[1:47:47] said, and it's down a paragraph. He
[1:47:49] said, "Oh, don't be the rough part on
[1:47:51] it. Pentecostal brothers, shine up at
[1:47:53] the word. Believe every bit of it. Don't
[1:47:56] get out of these isms and things.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; See, God's building a house.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Musicians, go ahead and come. Be done in
[1:48:06] just a second. God's building a house.
[1:48:11] He He's building his house.
[1:48:13] He's making something out of us,
[1:48:16] something he can put his image on.
[1:48:18] Brother Brandon tells the story when he
[1:48:19] talks about the stones, then he
[1:48:20] switches. He begins to talk about rags.
[1:48:23] And he tells the story of Queen
[1:48:26] Elizabeth, she went to visit a paper
[1:48:27] factory. And many of you know that in
[1:48:30] the old days, paper was made out of
[1:48:32] rags. In fact, they still do that today.
[1:48:36] You can do it at home. You can actually
[1:48:38] make paper out of rags as a science
[1:48:40] experiment. So, they took the oldest,
[1:48:43] dirtiest, filthiest rags.
[1:48:46] I like I got to looking at the process
[1:48:48] of it. You know, the filthiest rags have
[1:48:50] to be cleaned by bleach.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah. Brother said the bleach is
[1:48:57] what took the sin back to the beginning.
[1:48:59] Send it back on the devil.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:05] But he he said Queen Elizabeth was
[1:49:07] touring this rag or this paper factory
[1:49:11] and they opened up the door of this room
[1:49:12] and it was full of rags.
[1:49:15] And she said, "Oh my." She said, "How
[1:49:18] could anything how could anything be
[1:49:20] made out of dirty, filthy rags like
[1:49:24] these?" They said, "Well, it has to go
[1:49:26] through the process."
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; So, the rags get taken. Hallelujah. Out
[1:49:31] of the room that they're in
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; and taken and put in the process, run
[1:49:36] through the bleach.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till all the colors of sin
[1:49:41] are bleached out of them.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:44] And it comes out on the other side
[1:49:46] clean.
[1:49:48] And he said, "Watch this." And they let
[1:49:50] the rags dry at a certain time and and
[1:49:53] spread them so thin. Let them dry. Make
[1:49:55] them into pulp first and let them dry.
[1:49:57] And then spread them thin. And when they
[1:49:59] do, all of a sudden, they're paper. He
[1:50:02] said, "Watch this." He had a great seal
[1:50:04] with Queen Elizabeth's face on it. And
[1:50:07] he took the seal and he put it down in
[1:50:10] the paper and said, "Look, it bears your
[1:50:13] image."
[1:50:15] What was a filthy rag now bore the image
[1:50:17] of the queen. Brother Brandham says, "We
[1:50:19] were filthy rags. We come out of
[1:50:21] denomination. We come out of a of an old
[1:50:23] life. We come out, come on, some of you
[1:50:25] come out of drugs and alcohol and
[1:50:26] everything else." But thank God for the
[1:50:28] cleansing process that we come through
[1:50:31] justification, sanctification, and the
[1:50:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And we got we
[1:50:35] got put in the bleach.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you this morning, if you not
[1:50:40] been fully cleansed, let the bleach of
[1:50:41] the word of God clean you this morning.
[1:50:44] Make you something different. They were
[1:50:46] put in the bleach and then when they
[1:50:48] come out, the image of the queen was
[1:50:50] stamped on them. Oh, I believe the image
[1:50:52] of the king has been stamped on you,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; been stamped on me. Oh, I thank God for
[1:50:58] it today.
[1:51:00] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "Do
[1:51:02] you see it? It's Christ now taking the
[1:51:04] rags of yesterday.
[1:51:07] Hallelujah. Putting it through a
[1:51:09] process, a process of the Holy Spirit.
[1:51:12] He said what they had plus
[1:51:15] justification plus sanctification plus
[1:51:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost plus the
[1:51:20] gifts of the spirit plus the word of the
[1:51:22] hour
[1:51:24] making it till he is pressing his own
[1:51:26] image. When the church in Christ becomes
[1:51:29] one in union, you said what can do that?
[1:51:31] See, a rag cannot pick up itself.
[1:51:36] A stone can't choose itself.
[1:51:40] What a stone is, it's it is because of
[1:51:43] the maker.
[1:51:46] Are you with me? It has nothing to do
[1:51:49] with it.
[1:51:51] Oh my. What it is, if you see a stone
[1:51:54] carved, the stone itself never carved
[1:51:58] itself. It can't do that. What can it
[1:52:02] do? Submit to the carving.
[1:52:04] Oh God, listen. When Zerubabel got done,
[1:52:08] when when when they he was trying to
[1:52:10] encourage Zechariah was trying to
[1:52:12] encourage Zerubbabel because he's
[1:52:13] building the temple
[1:52:16] after it had been destroyed. Solomon's
[1:52:17] temple had been destroyed. This is the
[1:52:18] second temple. And and Zachariah cried
[1:52:21] out, "Who art thou, oh great mountain
[1:52:24] before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a
[1:52:26] plain and he shall bring forth the
[1:52:30] headstone thereof. Hallelujah.
[1:52:34] Oh, glory to God. He wasn't the
[1:52:35] headstone, but he brought forth the
[1:52:37] headstone crying grace.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe that's where I'm living
[1:52:41] today. That's where you're living. A
[1:52:43] headstone crying with shoutings, crying
[1:52:46] grace, grace unto it. A peculiar stone
[1:52:49] rejected by the builders for a
[1:52:51] particular place in our lives.
[1:52:54] Hallelujah. Would you bow your heads
[1:52:56] with me now?
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:01] And now my life or your life will not
[1:53:03] fit the headstone without this message.
[1:53:08] But by the message of the hour, it's not
[1:53:10] just words,
[1:53:12] but it's a process.
[1:53:14] With the message of the hour, I can be
[1:53:17] honed down until I fit the headstone
[1:53:21] exactly.
[1:53:23] until my life is his life.
[1:53:27] But I had nothing to do with that
[1:53:29] message coming. It was all grace. Would
[1:53:32] you accept that grace today?
[1:53:34] Could you be one crying out like
[1:53:36] Zachariah? Grace. Grace.
[1:53:39] Do it. I've been washed by grace. I've
[1:53:43] been chopped and cut by grace.
[1:53:46] Made me what I am by grace.
[1:53:50] Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] Amen. Maybe with every head bowed, every
[1:53:54] eye closed, you'd like to raise your
[1:53:55] hand and say, "Lord, Lord, make me what
[1:53:58] you want me to be." That's my desire
[1:54:01] this morning. Make me what you want me
[1:54:03] to be. Oh, oh, that we could cry grace
[1:54:06] to my life. Grace,
[1:54:10] I don't want to just be what what what I
[1:54:12] wanted to be, but Lord, I'd fit
[1:54:14] somewhere. Help me, Lord. Make me what
[1:54:16] you want me to be. I say as a pastor,
[1:54:18] Lord, make me. I'm a pastor. I'm a stone
[1:54:20] cutter, but I'm also a stone. Lord, make
[1:54:23] me what I ought to be. Oh, granny. Lord,
[1:54:26] heavenly father, with hands up all over
[1:54:28] the building, I pray God that you'd take
[1:54:31] each one of these, Lord. I pray you'd
[1:54:33] make them into what you want them to be.
[1:54:35] Lord, not our will, but thine be done.
[1:54:37] Lord, change our lives. Change
[1:54:39] everything about us, oh God. Make us
[1:54:41] more like you, oh God. I pray you'd
[1:54:44] grant it, Lord. Some get worked slow,
[1:54:46] some are worked fast, but Lord, we won't
[1:54:48] give up on them because we know it's
[1:54:49] grace in the end. I pray you'd help us,
[1:54:52] Lord. Help us to know it. I pray you'd
[1:54:54] help us, God, to pass through that
[1:54:56] process today be washed by the water of
[1:54:58] the word, Lord. May all the memory of
[1:55:01] sin and the things of the world be cast
[1:55:03] away from us, Lord. Be washed away. May
[1:55:05] we sit in your presence knowing we have
[1:55:07] been redeemed. I pray you'd grant it,
[1:55:10] Lord. If there's one here that needs the
[1:55:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost, I pray you'd
[1:55:13] help them that they wouldn't rest until
[1:55:14] they receive it. Lord, knowing that's
[1:55:16] the the thing, Lord, the the headstone
[1:55:20] that the builders rejected,
[1:55:22] oh God, may they see the need of it
[1:55:25] today, Lord, and come to it. We pray in
[1:55:28] Jesus name.
[1:55:30] Hallelujah.
[1:55:33] Hallelujah.
[1:55:35] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, the tears
[1:55:46] from your eyes.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:50] This child, thank you, Lord. Cares
[1:55:55] for you. Could you sing it? Someone to
[1:55:57] care, someone to share. Sing it now. Oh,
