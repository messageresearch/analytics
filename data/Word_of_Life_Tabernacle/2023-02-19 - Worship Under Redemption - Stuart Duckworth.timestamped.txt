[26:23] under Redemption
[26:25] and
[26:27] amen the price of redemption has been
[26:29] paid amen
[26:32] amen Hebrews 11 4. if
[26:35] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[26:38] excellent sacrifice than came by which
[26:40] he obtained witness that he was
[26:42] righteous and God testifying of his
[26:44] gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh
[26:49] amen you can be seated this morning
[26:54] amen this as I said
[26:56] um
[26:57] just wanna it's our title worship under
[26:59] Redemption the the price of redemption
[27:01] has been paid
[27:03] I mean these thoughts were just kind of
[27:04] coming to to me as we drove here this
[27:07] morning amen and there are Redemption
[27:10] claims that have been made the price has
[27:13] been paid I mean they're also Redemption
[27:15] claims that have been made amen upon you
[27:18] and I
[27:19] amen and we are we are nearing amen the
[27:22] the fullness of redemption amen the
[27:26] price has already been paid 2 000 years
[27:28] ago it was paid
[27:30] um it's taken care of Amen but there
[27:32] comes a fullness a time of fullness of
[27:35] the fullness of redemption and we're
[27:37] living and worshiping under the fullness
[27:39] of the word amen under the fullness of
[27:42] the atonement
[27:43] and man nothing amen we're not shorted
[27:46] anything in in this age I mean
[27:48] everything has been provided amen and
[27:50] we're coming we're coming and we're
[27:52] living under that fullness of the word
[27:54] the fullness of redemption
[27:57] amen and
[27:58] true revelation will bring bring a true
[28:01] worship
[28:02] amen and where where we live we amen
[28:06] where we live believe and worship Amen
[28:08] in faith as the redeemed as the
[28:11] blood-bought Sons and Daughters of God
[28:14] amen
[28:16] I'm going to try to keep my voice this
[28:18] morning
[28:21] try to hang on to it as best I can
[28:23] just take my time here I'd love to love
[28:26] to get sideways here this morning and
[28:28] shout and preach hard but I'm not going
[28:31] to do that okay
[28:34] I'll try try not to
[28:39] amen so we're living in faith as a
[28:41] redeemed amen amen in it you know this
[28:45] true Revelation amen it brings a true
[28:47] worship and it brings brings you into a
[28:50] the word brings us into a true spiritual
[28:52] relationship with God and that's what we
[28:55] want in this hour amen where we are a
[28:58] made new creatures in Christ amen and
[29:01] that's that's the goal a man of of
[29:03] preaching the word and trying to help
[29:04] people and you know and to be filled
[29:07] with the spirit amen live according to
[29:10] you that's why we're here amen
[29:12] hey man that's what we want to see
[29:14] that's what a man we want to as a church
[29:17] as a as a people of God as as
[29:20] caretakers of the word as as as mothers
[29:23] and fathers we want to see those that we
[29:25] love those that we care about to come to
[29:28] that because that's the goal Amen to to
[29:31] be new creatures to be filled with the
[29:33] Holy Ghost and live according to his
[29:35] word amen as he shows us
[29:39] and so Abel as we read and Abel amen
[29:42] offered unto God a more excellent
[29:45] sacrifice
[29:46] amen he sacrificed and worshiped by
[29:49] faith he worshiped amen under or from
[29:53] the Revelation that he received from God
[29:55] and that's all we can do that's all
[29:58] anybody can do amen what what God would
[30:01] show you amen that's what you believed
[30:03] that that's all you can believe
[30:05] right what he shows you and what he
[30:07] allows you to see amen and and I just
[30:10] think of all that he's allowed us to see
[30:12] all that he showed us amen and what
[30:15] we're living under amen and what he has
[30:18] showed us in this hour amen we ought to
[30:19] be a grateful people amen he hasn't just
[30:23] given us a little portion or just a a
[30:25] certain amen but he's open the fullness
[30:27] of the thing to us every bit amen every
[30:30] uh no loose sin has been left undone
[30:33] everything has been shown to us in this
[30:35] hour
[30:35] feminine is here for us to partake of
[30:40] and so so Abel from his heart
[30:44] amen from the Revelation and from his
[30:47] heart he he sacrificed and he did these
[30:50] things and his life was an expression of
[30:53] what God revealed to him I mean he lived
[30:57] he lived what he believed he identified
[31:00] himself with the Revelation he
[31:02] identified himself with that sacrifice
[31:05] that he brought forth amen he was
[31:07] committed he was all in on it
[31:10] amen he he identified himself with that
[31:15] and there amen he identified himself and
[31:18] God himself gave witness and testified
[31:21] that his sacrifice was accepted amen he
[31:24] accepted his faith
[31:27] right and that's that's what God that
[31:30] you know you can believe God and you
[31:32] know you can you can you know that'll
[31:34] that'll take you so far but God has to
[31:36] accept your faith he has to testify amen
[31:39] amen and that's what the Holy Ghost is
[31:41] amen where God comes down and then he
[31:44] seals you off he accepts your faith I
[31:47] mean he accepts amen amen that you
[31:50] believe in him
[31:52] and he comes down by the Holy Ghost and
[31:55] testifies of your life
[31:57] amen
[32:00] so God testified amen that he was
[32:03] accepted that he was righteous
[32:06] amen and to be righteous is to be to be
[32:09] upright to be to be one who keeps God's
[32:12] Commandments keeps his word amen amen to
[32:15] be right to be right with God that's
[32:16] what righteous means I mean is that what
[32:19] you want in this hour amen I want to be
[32:21] accepted of God Amen I want to be
[32:24] accepted I Want My Worship to be
[32:26] accepted to him amen I don't want to
[32:28] just live haphazardly amen just bring
[32:31] whatever amen but I want I want I want
[32:34] to keep his word I want to keep his
[32:35] Commandments I want to be pleasing to
[32:37] him I want to be accepted amen with my
[32:40] creator
[32:42] with my Lord
[32:45] and brother Brown says here
[32:48] in the results of a decision he said
[32:50] Cain and Abel both of them worshiped in
[32:52] the beginning Cain built an altar and so
[32:54] did Abel
[32:55] Cain worshiped and so did Abel Cain
[32:58] wasn't in Infidel but built an altar
[33:01] and they brought a sacrifice they done
[33:04] everything they they could do do both of
[33:06] them why was Abel accepted because Abel
[33:10] was spiritual minded it was revealed to
[33:12] Abel that it wasn't fruits and apples
[33:15] that brought us out of the Garden of
[33:16] Eden it was blood and he offered the
[33:19] blood of a lamb by spiritual Revelation
[33:22] and then he says and Jesus said that he
[33:24] would build his church on the spiritual
[33:27] Revelation and so here these two
[33:30] brothers in the beginning not too far
[33:33] removed amen from Eden not too far
[33:37] removed from from that eaten condition
[33:40] Amen in
[33:41] there back in Eden before the fall we
[33:45] look and we see where where Adam was
[33:48] called of the Earth
[33:49] God had made him a secondary God and and
[33:52] there he's described brother he
[33:54] described as the as the god of the earth
[33:57] and then they're in that condition it
[33:59] was a perfection
[34:01] amen there was only life
[34:04] there was perfect peace perfect Joy amen
[34:07] God's creation was in Perfect Harmony I
[34:11] mean everything was was as it should be
[34:14] and then and that's that's that's a true
[34:17] Eden amen and and I believe we can have
[34:20] that here this morning I believe we can
[34:23] have that here within our lives and
[34:24] that's what we want to want to try to
[34:26] preach if we can that God is has has
[34:28] brought us back to that
[34:31] and and you may not fully see exactly
[34:34] what what Adam and Eve what they lived
[34:35] in but but we're going back to that
[34:37] that's what we're trying to get back to
[34:41] hey man we we we don't have to live in
[34:43] confusion we don't have to live in in
[34:46] disruption of constant disruption amen
[34:49] but there's a peace here this morning
[34:51] there's a peace amen for the believer
[34:53] amen if we'll come amen come God's
[34:56] provided way
[35:00] so everything was as it should be
[35:03] I mean it was so perfect and so pleasing
[35:05] to God that he rested in his Works he
[35:08] was so satisfied with it and what he had
[35:11] created and man it was it was beautiful
[35:13] it was beautiful it was perfect it was
[35:15] unblemished
[35:17] right
[35:18] and that's what we're coming back to
[35:23] I mean everything was as it should be
[35:26] amen and brother Brown describes he said
[35:28] God would come down in that sacred that
[35:31] sacred light he would come down there in
[35:34] the cool of the evening and there under
[35:36] the Cathedral of the heavens and in the
[35:39] canopy of of the palm trees and and the
[35:41] woods there and the forest he would come
[35:44] and he would have Fellowship
[35:46] he would have he would have Fellowship
[35:48] he he would commune and and talk with
[35:51] Adam and Eve
[35:52] amen and that that's what we were
[35:54] designed to be
[35:55] that's what we were made for that's what
[35:57] man was made for in the beginning that
[35:59] for for God to have somebody to
[36:02] fellowship with and then even Adam Adam
[36:05] walked the Earth alone and God saw that
[36:09] man was lonely
[36:11] brother Isaac
[36:14] he saw that he was lonely
[36:16] amen and and there he he provided him a
[36:20] mate
[36:21] amen he provided him a maiden God
[36:23] himself that that was expressed in God
[36:25] Amen God was lonely
[36:28] he dwelt with his thoughts
[36:30] and then he had the Angels there to
[36:32] worship Him amen but he wanted someone
[36:34] in his own end but someone in his own
[36:36] likeness
[36:38] I mean that he could come down and live
[36:40] in
[36:41] amen Adam there God of the Earth
[36:44] but that's what man was made for Amen to
[36:47] worship and commune and have fellowship
[36:49] with God Amen that's why we're here amen
[36:52] this morning is to commune with him Amen
[36:55] to talk with him Amen to to tell him all
[36:58] about it amen to tell him our needs amen
[37:00] and then then him in return he can come
[37:03] and tell us what he wants us to be tell
[37:05] us what he wants us to do give us
[37:07] Direction amen amen be the bring a calm
[37:11] in our lives Amen in the disruption and
[37:13] the and the confusion of the sage and
[37:15] the evil spirits that are that are that
[37:18] we have to walk amongst or walk amongst
[37:20] and live in amen he said calm amen he'll
[37:23] come in that he'll come in Satan's Eden
[37:26] amen he'll come in the time that you and
[37:28] I live in amen there will be an eating
[37:31] condition amen amen a calm amen a peace
[37:34] amen a fellowship with him
[37:41] amen
[37:45] it was so perfect
[37:48] so God he would come down there in the
[37:50] cool of the evening
[37:52] but and then so because here of the Fall
[37:55] amen where Eve listened to the LIE of
[37:57] Satan amen he had only Twisted one word
[38:01] and Eve he fell for his lie
[38:04] and the Bible says that Adam being not
[38:06] deceived in the transgression but he
[38:08] stepped out and he took Eve's sin upon
[38:10] himself is that right and then he went
[38:13] against what God had commanded them not
[38:15] to do and there the condemnation fell
[38:17] upon them and they hid themselves from
[38:19] God In His holy presence
[38:23] and brother Brown says here in the
[38:25] message of Grace he said there come
[38:26] Jehovah down like a roar of Thunder
[38:28] walking through the garden crying Adam
[38:31] Where Art Thou and that's when Adam
[38:33] realized he was naked and had sinned
[38:35] before God he hid himself tried to make
[38:38] himself a religion but it didn't work
[38:41] amen so he says here but God killed some
[38:44] Sheep amen I wish I could preach here
[38:46] this morning amen God killed some sheep
[38:49] took the skins and showed that something
[38:52] had to die to cover sin
[38:55] and he goes on to say he says there's
[38:56] joining church will never cover sin no
[38:59] dried confession will ever cover sin it
[39:02] takes us sorrow and repentance and the
[39:04] grace of God Amen to cover sin for the
[39:07] blood of Jesus Christ the one that God
[39:09] killed at Calvary to cover sin
[39:14] and there how how the prophet described
[39:18] it
[39:18] them walking out with with tears in
[39:21] their eyes
[39:22] covered in in sheepskins
[39:25] amen mixed with her tears amen God had
[39:28] come down himself
[39:30] God had come down himself and provided a
[39:32] sacrifice for his children I mean they
[39:35] tried to do it on their own but God it
[39:38] wasn't pleasing to him it wasn't what
[39:40] God required so God himself come down
[39:43] and he and he killed the Sheep
[39:46] amen and amen they didn't just kill the
[39:49] Sheep amen but they they clothed
[39:51] themselves in the very skins of that
[39:54] sacrifice they were they were covered
[39:56] from head to toe
[39:58] and there brother Brown describes it he
[40:00] says that they're they're tears dripping
[40:02] down them them walking out of the garden
[40:04] and he said I can hear I can hear those
[40:07] sheepskin slapping their skins
[40:12] and it describes it so real to us
[40:16] amen that blood dripping from their
[40:18] bodies because of what they had done
[40:20] they had to be covered amen God required
[40:23] a sacrifice he required a blood a man of
[40:26] an innocent one
[40:30] and so God Amen God
[40:33] 's seen this
[40:35] those sheepskins them walking out in
[40:38] this condition and as they walked out
[40:39] there amen here brother Ramses Cobbs it
[40:42] says he who had no beginning amen the
[40:45] god of the heavens there he's seen them
[40:47] walking out in that condition and there
[40:49] he he come down
[40:51] he come down and amen in the amen and
[40:54] the the atmosphere and the things and
[40:56] amen and God come down there he he
[40:58] dwelts alone he had no form amen but he
[41:01] would come down there amen and he
[41:03] funneled down to them amen no doubt in
[41:05] the form of that light amen there amen
[41:08] everything just came together and there
[41:10] he's seen his children as they walked
[41:12] through the garden amen where once there
[41:14] was Perfect Harmony and fellowship amen
[41:17] God himself couldn't stand it he
[41:19] couldn't stand to see it
[41:22] but it was expressing God Amen God
[41:25] allowed it to happen that he could be
[41:27] expressed amen amen God will allow
[41:29] things to happen he'll allow things
[41:31] happen in your life amen just so he can
[41:33] come and express himself to you
[41:36] amen but there he couldn't see he
[41:38] couldn't stand it and he called back to
[41:40] them as they were walking out and then
[41:43] they had to leave this perfect this
[41:45] perfect place and there there he called
[41:48] to them as they walked out and he said I
[41:50] will put enmity between you your seed
[41:53] and the Serpent's Seed amen and he made
[41:55] a promise a man of a coming Messiah of
[41:57] one that would come Amen in the head of
[42:00] that serpent would be bruised amen and
[42:02] he will bruise your heel amen he would
[42:05] be able to bring Affliction upon you
[42:08] amen he would be allowed to do that but
[42:10] also that his Works amen would be
[42:13] destroyed amen that that word there
[42:15] bruising means to destroy man
[42:22] amen
[42:25] amen
[42:27] the head of the serpent amen will be
[42:30] crushed
[42:32] but man because he had partaken of the
[42:35] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he
[42:37] had to be cut off from from accessing
[42:39] the tree of life and you just be patient
[42:41] with me this morning that's trying to
[42:43] take my time
[42:46] I'm not a big storyteller
[42:48] this is just what I had on my heart amen
[42:53] so because they had partaken amen of the
[42:57] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they
[42:58] had to be cut off from from the Tree of
[43:00] Life from accessing him
[43:02] Genesis 3 and 23 and says therefore the
[43:05] Lord God sent him forth from the Garden
[43:08] of Eden to till the ground from once it
[43:10] was taken they had to leave
[43:13] but so and then verse 24 so he drove out
[43:15] the man any place at the east of the
[43:18] Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming
[43:21] sword which turned every way to keep the
[43:24] way of the tree of life and brother
[43:26] Brown said what is that tree of life he
[43:28] said he said that was Christ
[43:30] amen that was that was that eternal life
[43:32] that that Adam and Eve amen if they
[43:35] wouldn't have partaken of the other tree
[43:37] man they would have lived they would
[43:39] have lived
[43:40] eternally but they stepped out of that
[43:42] right they stepped out of that
[43:45] amen he said if they wouldn't if the
[43:48] fall wouldn't have happened we would
[43:49] have all just came forth we would have
[43:51] been spoken to exist and we would have
[43:53] come into existence just the names amen
[43:55] just the Sons and Daughters of God the
[43:57] thoughts of God
[43:59] amen but they stepped out of that
[44:03] that tree was crossed
[44:06] that tree was life to them it was it was
[44:09] it was what made Eden Eden
[44:11] right
[44:14] but also what what made Eden was them
[44:17] being there also it wasn't the same
[44:22] and then questions and answers
[44:24] brother Branham says here he says the
[44:26] Garden of Eden
[44:27] was east east in Eden the east side of
[44:30] Eden and the cherubims was placed in the
[44:32] tree of life was at the East Gate of the
[44:34] garden he said and that's where I think
[44:36] Cain and Abel made their sacrifice and
[44:39] that's where the cherubim with the
[44:40] Flaming sword wouldn't let them come in
[44:43] anymore east of the gate
[44:46] so he said he describes he believed that
[44:48] this is where they came and made their
[44:49] sacrifice could you imagine
[44:51] could you imagine standing there perhaps
[44:54] and and they weren't too far from
[44:56] removed from from all these events time
[45:00] Tom had only transpired just so long but
[45:04] maybe you know if you lived seven eight
[45:06] nine hundred years you know it seemed
[45:08] like an eternity
[45:10] I'm kind of glad we don't have to live
[45:12] that that long
[45:13] especially
[45:14] as bad as things are right now
[45:18] but
[45:19] I don't know what at at what point in
[45:22] their life that they realize that they
[45:24] needed to come bring a sacrifice they
[45:27] needed to come worship but because you
[45:29] imagine they're perhaps being what they
[45:32] had been taught by Adam and Eve that
[45:34] just a just a little further past this
[45:37] gate there was the Tree of Life
[45:40] but they could only they could only come
[45:42] so far to it they were cut off they're
[45:45] the the cherubims the Angels there with
[45:47] the Flaming sword guarding the way back
[45:49] to the Tree of Life
[45:51] they had been cut off man had been cut
[45:54] off
[45:54] they're just beyond that gate was life
[45:57] Amen in just a short span of time that
[46:00] man man didn't face death he didn't face
[46:03] sickness he didn't face sorrow he didn't
[46:05] feel condemnation but they both they
[46:09] both came back as far back and as close
[46:11] as they could to the Garden where the
[46:13] tree of life was but they were only they
[46:16] were only allowed to come so far amen
[46:18] but there was something in them that
[46:20] that wanted to worship amen and God
[46:22] God's created man to worship something
[46:25] God created God created a man to worship
[46:28] him but man man amen sometimes don't
[46:32] rightly know what to worship so he'll
[46:34] he'll almost worship anything
[46:36] Amen in different cultures they have
[46:38] different gods and and different things
[46:40] and I don't understand a lot about that
[46:42] amen but you even come in the religious
[46:44] world of this day and there's so many
[46:47] different versions of what God is
[46:49] there's so many different versions of
[46:52] who Jesus Is Right
[46:54] and then you come down even in what we
[46:56] believe there's so many there's so many
[46:58] different ideas amen amen but there's
[47:01] one God that can come and change a
[47:04] person's life and when there's one God
[47:06] Amen and we've seen him so revealed in
[47:08] this age amen there's one God that could
[47:11] come down and an imperfection and then
[47:13] reveal the secrets of the heart amen
[47:16] amen the son of man amen being revealed
[47:19] to you and I man we were able to
[47:21] identify it wasn't a Baptist Jesus it
[47:24] wasn't a Pentecostal Jesus amen but it
[47:26] was Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[47:28] today and forever amen I don't just want
[47:31] to worship amen my own concept of what
[47:34] he is amen but I want to worship that
[47:36] Living God Amen the one amen that'll
[47:38] come down and change a person's life
[47:40] amen amen you can't fake that Satan
[47:43] cannot impersonate that he can
[47:45] impersonate all kinds of emotions all
[47:47] kinds of all kinds of gifts amen but he
[47:50] cannot impersonate that life amen in my
[47:53] Jesus amen this gospel this word amen
[47:56] that we have received that we've been
[47:58] pointed back to amen this gospel that we
[48:01] have been restored to amen is a
[48:03] life-changing gospel amen from what I've
[48:05] experienced
[48:09] amen
[48:11] amen
[48:13] that's that's the God that I want to I
[48:15] want to point people to amen not a not
[48:18] some church not some idea I mean because
[48:21] God didn't displace his name anywhere
[48:23] amen God placed his name in his son amen
[48:27] what is the name of the father it is the
[48:29] Lord Jesus Christ their God Amen
[48:31] identified his beloved Son
[48:34] amen and here's ye him this morning hear
[48:38] ye him amen not not some man not some
[48:41] Creed not some idea not what some church
[48:43] says amen but here's ye him amen
[48:46] everything will pass away amen
[48:48] everything will will go away everything
[48:50] will fall amen but the son of man amen
[48:52] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[48:55] and forever
[49:02] amen
[49:05] amen
[49:08] so ma'am here they come to worship
[49:11] as we said
[49:14] man's going to worship something
[49:17] amen because it's in us to worship it's
[49:19] it's in us to do that
[49:22] and so here in Genesis 4 3 and in the
[49:24] process of time it came to pass that
[49:26] Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[49:28] and offering unto the Lord
[49:30] so there came built his altar his church
[49:34] amen it was beautiful brother Brown
[49:36] describes him
[49:38] amen he Brethren said he was so sincere
[49:41] amen said he even said that he wanted to
[49:44] be saved
[49:45] I think of that and he said that'll
[49:47] choke some of you he said but even even
[49:49] Cain wanted to be saved he wanted to be
[49:51] right he knew that he was lost and he
[49:53] wanted to find favor with God
[49:55] and I I try not to talk about television
[49:58] programs
[50:00] but the chosen
[50:02] and how Judas came and I I think it's so
[50:06] so good how they depict him that he he
[50:08] starts out we know what his end is
[50:11] but he starts out wanting to be right
[50:14] wanting to follow God wanting to do
[50:15] something for God
[50:17] and no doubt this is how this is how
[50:19] Cain Cain was he had within within him
[50:23] every good intention Amen to do what was
[50:26] right
[50:27] to worship and find favor with God to do
[50:30] everything he could to bring everything
[50:31] he could offer and then he worshiped he
[50:34] prayed he went to church he he paid his
[50:36] tithes he did everything and then a
[50:38] regular uh good church member would do
[50:41] it but he tried to cover himself just as
[50:44] Adam and Eve did with their own covering
[50:47] amen and in trying to figure it out and
[50:50] then he became confused he became amen
[50:53] he became rejected
[50:56] and then he thought he thought he
[50:58] thought they ate an apple or it could
[51:00] have been something like that he wasn't
[51:01] real sure just in my own words here he
[51:04] wasn't real sure so he just you know he
[51:06] just piled on Amen one of everything
[51:11] they tried to offer his own idea and his
[51:14] own wisdom he tried to bring his own own
[51:16] works well I well I I think this is what
[51:19] God wants all right I think he'd be okay
[51:22] with this
[51:23] so he so he added some flowers you know
[51:26] he was a tiller of the ground he he grew
[51:29] all these fruits and these flowers and
[51:31] and everything that you could think of
[51:34] all these all these beautiful things
[51:37] so we added some flowers and
[51:40] he dressed it up he tried to make it as
[51:42] beautiful as he could and that was in
[51:44] his nature
[51:45] to to want beautiful things like that
[51:48] and even added his own special doctrine
[51:52] that he could only see
[51:55] there so he he added some some pumpkins
[51:58] and gourds
[52:00] you know just add a little bit here and
[52:01] there and try to make it pretty much try
[52:03] to make it acceptable as acceptable as I
[52:06] know how to do
[52:08] and so he he added some pumpkins and
[52:10] some gourds
[52:12] me just describing here this I didn't
[52:14] find this in the message anywhere so
[52:16] y'all this is just me you take it for
[52:18] what it is
[52:19] so maybe he had taken a quote or two
[52:22] from Adam
[52:23] amen and maybe some personal testimonies
[52:25] for me pieced it all together he really
[52:27] felt like he had it all figured out I
[52:30] mean and he tried to present it he tried
[52:32] to present his own theology his own idea
[52:35] of the thing his own his own Doctrine
[52:37] and no doubt Amen to the regular eye was
[52:40] so beautiful but being the son of the
[52:42] devil that was his nature for Satan
[52:45] wanted a more beautiful kingdom a more
[52:48] greater Kingdom than that of Michael he
[52:50] wanted his own kingdom he wanted to
[52:52] bring his own thing and that's the
[52:54] difference in in The Believer
[52:58] that's the difference in the seed of God
[53:00] I believe and the serpent seat is is we
[53:04] don't have anything to bring
[53:06] amen when we when you come to God
[53:08] there's nothing that you can bring
[53:09] there's nothing that you can do
[53:12] amen any there's nothing that you can
[53:14] even understand you just have to
[53:16] surrender yourself to it you can't even
[53:18] explain it yourself amen but because we
[53:21] are his seed he won't lose a one amen
[53:25] and I can tell you that when I was first
[53:26] Saved I I can't remember what was
[53:28] preached
[53:29] but I knew that I came and I came in and
[53:32] I knew that I needed God I knew that I
[53:35] needed something and all I could do was
[53:36] Just Surrender amen my whole life to him
[53:39] there was nothing I could bring to him
[53:40] in my condition
[53:43] and as a seed of God that's there's
[53:44] nothing that we can do we just have to
[53:46] come to him amen
[53:50] amen there's nothing that we can do we
[53:51] were designed him into worship God we
[53:54] were designed to depend upon God
[53:57] fully and completely
[54:04] amen
[54:10] he wanted his own kingdom he wanted his
[54:12] own way
[54:13] so Genesis 4 4 and Abel he also brought
[54:17] of the of the firstlings of his flock
[54:20] and of the fat thereof and and the Lord
[54:22] had respect unto Abel and to his
[54:25] offering
[54:27] and here Here Comes Sable to the to the
[54:30] East Gate of Eden
[54:32] the cherubims the angels are there with
[54:34] a flaming sword guarding the Tree of
[54:36] Life there he comes I mean he he he
[54:39] himself can only go so far
[54:42] he himself can only can only come just
[54:45] he could only Come Just As far as Cain
[54:46] did
[54:48] and there brother Brown describes as
[54:50] there the Angels the the presence of God
[54:52] is there and there he comes as far as he
[54:55] could and and there he builds his altar
[54:58] amen he too has been cut off from from
[55:00] that perfect condition
[55:02] amen and and in him is a desire to be
[55:05] right in him is a desire to worship God
[55:09] and then because that's what he was
[55:10] created to be but amen there's a hunger
[55:13] there was a hunger and a thirst in him
[55:15] amen that only Jehovah could satisfy
[55:18] only that presence could satisfy amen he
[55:22] didn't have any Works to bring of of his
[55:24] self amen amen God Amen he didn't create
[55:27] that lamb God provided that lamb that he
[55:30] would bring amen he didn't he didn't
[55:32] bring it from the ground amen but God
[55:34] provided that lamb
[55:36] God provided that revelation
[55:40] amen God hasn't provided a place of
[55:43] worship amen this morning for his people
[55:44] he's provided everything that we have
[55:47] need of God has a provided sacrifice
[55:49] this morning amen he has everything that
[55:51] we have need of he has provided
[55:54] and brother Brown says here he says but
[55:56] here comes Abel dragging a little old
[55:58] lamb behind him
[56:00] I mean he said I don't see nothing
[56:02] pretty about that
[56:03] and he said I can see he gets he had a
[56:06] Vine maybe wrapped it around his neck he
[56:08] said because it was cross that's who it
[56:10] was for they led him like a lamb to the
[56:13] slaughter him and they put a rope around
[56:15] his neck and here he come leading this
[56:17] little lamb bleeding pulling back and
[56:20] then he laid him there on a rock he said
[56:21] perhaps they didn't have any sharp
[56:23] knives in them days probably took an old
[56:26] sharp Rock and held his little head back
[56:28] there and began to to beat his little
[56:30] throat amen able to see he said in the
[56:32] blood amen this is kind of graphic but
[56:34] he said the blood began to spurt out of
[56:36] his little arteries in his neck
[56:37] imminence he said did you ever hear a
[56:40] lamb dying it's the most pathetic thing
[56:43] you ever heard of sahir lamb die how it
[56:46] bleeds and it beats
[56:48] hey remember this this is what God was
[56:51] wanting this is what God was wanting
[56:53] amen God looking down he said God
[56:56] looking down from heaven said that's
[56:57] what it takes he said the blood speaking
[57:00] amen what did it speak of
[57:03] preach with me this morning
[57:05] what did the blood speak of
[57:08] because the blood has a voice
[57:11] the blood has a voice of the very blood
[57:13] of Abel the Bible says when when Cain
[57:16] slew him that very blood cried out from
[57:18] the ground and he said in this Blood
[57:20] this blood of Jesus Christ speaketh
[57:23] better things than that of Abel so what
[57:25] does it speak of this morning
[57:28] hey man what does it speak of it spoke
[57:30] of a lamb of God that would come and be
[57:32] led away to Calvary amen it was a shadow
[57:34] of what was to come amen it wasn't
[57:37] exactly what God wanted fully but God
[57:39] would accept that that that gold That
[57:42] Dying lamb that Abel brought but God had
[57:44] something in his mind greater something
[57:46] that would be amen of the full effect
[57:48] amen that would abolish everything that
[57:52] Satan had done it spoke of one that
[57:54] would come and defeat the Devil and
[57:56] Conquer every sin for you and I that
[57:59] away we wouldn't have to do it ourselves
[58:01] but he would come amen that's what that
[58:03] sacrifice testified of
[58:06] that's what the voice of the blood spoke
[58:08] through that
[58:10] amen the blood
[58:12] and we are the blood of our mother and
[58:14] father
[58:15] we are the blood of every generation of
[58:18] every one that's come before us and and
[58:20] brother Brandon describes how the plan
[58:22] he brought this one together and that
[58:24] one together amen and and how
[58:27] predestinated it was and and forethought
[58:29] out by God he brought this one and this
[58:32] one because he had to get us here
[58:34] somehow
[58:35] but through this one and that one amen
[58:37] through that blood and and through the
[58:39] things they had done and the things they
[58:41] had developed over over these thousands
[58:43] of years amen that it took to bring you
[58:45] and I hear every bit of that every bit
[58:47] of the bad every bit of the bat has been
[58:50] passed down to you and I amen but the
[58:52] blood speaks amen of of taking that away
[58:56] it speaks of overcoming power and grace
[58:59] and mercy amen for the believer amen
[59:05] he had to get you here somehow
[59:08] amen so every bad trait every every
[59:11] potential habit
[59:13] that you have laying down within you
[59:15] every weakness that you have hidden down
[59:16] within you it was passed down and it was
[59:20] passed down and it was passed down
[59:22] remember that's the blood of your mother
[59:24] and father that's the blood of your
[59:26] ancestors amen that's the blood of the
[59:28] ones that were brought together to bring
[59:30] you here amen but the blood of the Lamb
[59:32] speaks of something different Eminem
[59:34] being born again you become the blood of
[59:37] God Amen the blood of Christ will
[59:40] annihilate your sin it would uh it will
[59:43] destroy your weaknesses it will destroy
[59:46] those complexes of things amen that you
[59:48] were that you're here to overcome and
[59:50] when the blood speaks of that this
[59:52] morning
[59:53] he testifies and it speaks amen of our
[59:56] Lord Jesus a man who defeated death hell
[59:59] on the grave preach with me this morning

[1:00:02] more voice I've got but help me this

[1:00:10] could remain sick amen he didn't die so
[1:00:12] you could remain unhappy and defeated
[1:00:15] and and weak and and feeble amen but he
[1:00:18] died he defeated death Hell In The Grave
[1:00:20] he defeated overcome every sin for you
[1:00:23] and I that's what the blood speaks of
[1:00:25] this morning that's what it has provided
[1:00:27] for you and I that's what the that's
[1:00:29] what the sacrifice of Abel it was
[1:00:31] prophesying that it would come it would
[1:00:34] take many years
[1:00:35] but it come
[1:00:38] they come in the fullness of Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ
[1:00:44] that you could be healed this morning
[1:00:46] that you could go away from here healed
[1:00:48] this morning that you don't have to put
[1:00:50] up with that devil you don't have to
[1:00:52] deal with that sickness
[1:00:54] you don't have to deal amen with that
[1:00:56] thing amen just your whole life amen but
[1:00:58] you can have victory over here this
[1:01:00] morning and manifest God's will for you
[1:01:02] to be healed amen

[1:01:19] with the Holy Ghost amen it provided
[1:01:22] that amen and sealed into his kingdom
[1:01:25] and speaks it speaks of a return it
[1:01:28] speaks of a return to Edom amen where
[1:01:30] we're going back to what Adam lost

[1:01:39] amen I don't know what else to believe
[1:01:42] I don't know I don't know what else what
[1:01:44] else to believe amen we we needed the
[1:01:47] blood
[1:01:47] we needed a sacrifice
[1:01:50] amen and Jesus came he offered himself
[1:01:53] amen that you could believe in him
[1:01:56] I love preaching about Jesus as simple
[1:01:58] we just hope sometimes we just don't
[1:02:01] hardly do it enough we don't do it like
[1:02:02] we should
[1:02:03] but the sacrifices available this

[1:02:18] interceding there on the throne for you
[1:02:20] and I this morning
[1:02:22] they're that sacrifice ladies
[1:02:30] and brother Branham he says here I
[1:02:32] thought this was this was good the only
[1:02:34] way Abel was accepted
[1:02:36] and only way he was any different was
[1:02:39] that something was revealed to him
[1:02:41] and that's that's what sets God's seed
[1:02:44] and his sons and daughters apart because
[1:02:46] God can reveal to them his will and his
[1:02:49] provided way
[1:02:51] now I believe this morning amen we're
[1:02:53] worshiping amen under the fullness of
[1:02:55] his word do you believe that and in the
[1:02:57] fullness of the word has come amen and
[1:03:00] we're worshiping under that

[1:03:22] this age amen we're going all the way
[1:03:24] back and then the Malachi 4 the word
[1:03:26] restored us back to that our original
[1:03:28] Pentecostal church amen that original
[1:03:31] Apostolic Faith amen by Brothers
[1:03:33] we're going back further than that we're
[1:03:36] going all the way back to Eden amen

[1:03:40] Perfection amen of what God had in his
[1:03:42] mind for you and I amen and that's what
[1:03:45] God that's how God sees you this morning
[1:03:47] he sees you through the blood the
[1:03:49] blood's speaking this morning it's their
[1:03:51] interceding on your behalf on your
[1:03:53] ignorance this morning on my ignorance
[1:03:55] is it's interceding on my mistakes and
[1:03:58] my failures amen God sees you through
[1:04:01] the blood he sees you that Perfection
[1:04:03] and that it speaks of
[1:04:06] and we're going we're going all the way
[1:04:08] back
[1:04:09] amen amen Redemption was paid for it
[1:04:12] calvary amen but we live in the age of
[1:04:15] the fullness of redemption amen where
[1:04:16] we're going to be changed
[1:04:18] hey man we're going to go back to what
[1:04:20] was in God's mind
[1:04:29] so the Revelation is what sets us apart
[1:04:31] we're not any better
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:34] everybody a lot of people that want to
[1:04:37] be right
[1:04:38] but God Amen be thankful this morning
[1:04:41] that you can receive his word
[1:04:44] amen we didn't receive a man in the
[1:04:46] sorrow but we received the word amen for
[1:04:49] this age
[1:04:51] we didn't receive just a man we received
[1:04:53] that message
[1:04:58] and brother Brown says here
[1:05:01] I'm sorry Matthew 11 25.
[1:05:07] and at that time Jesus answered and said
[1:05:09] I thank thee your father Lord of Heaven
[1:05:11] and Earth because thou has hid these
[1:05:13] things from the wise and prudent has
[1:05:15] revealed them to babes amen even soul
[1:05:18] fathers so it seemed good in thy side
[1:05:22] and all things are delivered verse 27
[1:05:24] all things are delivered unto me of my
[1:05:26] father no man knoweth the son but the
[1:05:28] father neither knoweth any man the
[1:05:30] father saved the son and he to
[1:05:33] whomsoever the son will reveal him
[1:05:37] amen so it's not what you can learn it's
[1:05:40] not what you can it's not what anybody
[1:05:43] can even tell you it's not what flesh
[1:05:44] and blood can tell you but it's to whom
[1:05:46] the son will reveal himself
[1:05:49] First Corinthians 1 19 for it is written
[1:05:52] I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[1:05:54] and I will bring to nothing the
[1:05:57] understanding of the prudent
[1:06:00] amen what God calls foolish the world
[1:06:02] world calls great and what the world
[1:06:05] calls crazy and foolish God calls great
[1:06:08] amen Jesus Jesus said heavens and earth
[1:06:11] will pass away but my word will never
[1:06:13] fail and so if the Revelation is in you
[1:06:16] this morning it can never fail amen if
[1:06:20] you just relying on your head knowledge
[1:06:22] or or what you've been able to bring
[1:06:24] that's going to pass away in your own
[1:06:27] wisdom amen and what you can what you
[1:06:30] can muster up and what you can figure
[1:06:31] out amen but if the Revelation is there
[1:06:34] if you've brought in amen it will never
[1:06:36] pass away amen amen because it is the
[1:06:39] word amen the word of God in you amen
[1:06:42] everything will else will perish
[1:06:45] everything will be destroyed but that
[1:06:47] will remain Amen in the revelations what
[1:06:49] sets us apart this morning it makes the
[1:06:52] elect and the chosen people of God
[1:06:55] different
[1:06:58] and brother Brown says here it was a
[1:07:00] revelation that Abel had that made him
[1:07:01] just he had a revelation of the
[1:07:04] requirement of almighty God he brought a
[1:07:06] lamb and that's the only way you'll ever
[1:07:08] see Divine Healing the baptism of the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost it'll be by Revelation amen
[1:07:15] we don't know these things you don't
[1:07:17] know Jesus amen by the flesh amen
[1:07:21] we can't even come close to that we're
[1:07:24] two thousand years apart from him from
[1:07:26] him being in the flesh and knowing him
[1:07:28] that way amen but it takes a revelation
[1:07:31] it takes a revelation from God Amen to
[1:07:34] reveal to you who he is amen it takes it
[1:07:39] takes a revelation from God to make the
[1:07:40] thing real to you we can understand and
[1:07:43] we we can look and we can see and we can
[1:07:45] read amen before to be real to you amen
[1:07:48] for it to be Faith to you for it to be
[1:07:50] bread and to be life it's got to be
[1:07:52] revealed to you
[1:07:54] amen if God's revealed to you this
[1:07:56] morning that you can be healed claim
[1:07:58] your healing this morning claim whatever
[1:08:00] you have need of this morning amen
[1:08:02] everything's yours this morning
[1:08:04] everything is ours this morning amen the
[1:08:08] word has been revealed this morning let
[1:08:09] it become bread to you let it become
[1:08:11] life to you let it let it come from from
[1:08:14] head knowledge down to the heart and
[1:08:16] then when you can believe from the heart
[1:08:18] that is what becomes manifested that's
[1:08:21] when it becomes life when it comes down
[1:08:22] into that inner man into that conscience
[1:08:25] amen we can read we can understand we
[1:08:28] can hear what the intellect and that's
[1:08:30] what that's what Cain tried to bring
[1:08:31] amen but it wasn't good enough it
[1:08:34] wouldn't hold up
[1:08:35] amen but when something anchors down
[1:08:38] once something's revealed to you you'll
[1:08:40] stand on it you'll believe it nobody can
[1:08:42] talk you out of an amen God's my healer
[1:08:45] God's my savior God's My Redeemer amen
[1:08:50] and then God in your life will testify
[1:08:52] that
[1:08:57] amen you'll be identified with it
[1:08:59] and then you'll you'll come with your
[1:09:01] sacrifice you'll come with what God has
[1:09:03] has told you
[1:09:05] the God will come down and witness that
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:13] and he says here in 1965 the whole Bible
[1:09:17] is the revelation of God the whole
[1:09:18] church is built upon the revelation of
[1:09:20] God there's no other way to know God
[1:09:22] only by Revelation to whom the son will
[1:09:25] reveal him Revelation is everything is
[1:09:27] revelation
[1:09:30] Amen brother Rome said Revelation is is
[1:09:32] more important to us than we realize
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:34] Christ is the mystery of God revealing
[1:09:36] he said look Christ and you makes him
[1:09:38] the center of the Revelation The Sinner
[1:09:40] of life of the Revelation see Christ's
[1:09:43] life in you makes him the center of the
[1:09:44] Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:09:47] Bible amen the complete revelation of
[1:09:49] Christ and Christ in you makes you the
[1:09:52] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:09:54] see what God is trying to do he said
[1:09:57] what is the new birth then he said well
[1:09:59] brother bran what is the new birth it is
[1:10:01] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:03] personally to you
[1:10:05] and then it's made life to you it's made
[1:10:08] real to you
[1:10:10] the whole complete thing
[1:10:12] amen that's what the new birth is and he
[1:10:14] said and then brother Roman says that go
[1:10:16] on to say in that message he says we've
[1:10:18] got the devil's answer we've got the
[1:10:20] devil's answer chose this question he
[1:10:22] said what is it he said it's Christ and
[1:10:24] you the hope of glory it's the
[1:10:27] resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:10:29] hey Minister resurrected one that
[1:10:31] overcame death hell on the grave amen
[1:10:34] you've been quickened amen by the
[1:10:36] Revelation to that life
[1:10:39] you've been quickened Amen in the New
[1:10:41] Birth has changed you it's made you a
[1:10:43] different person amen you're you're
[1:10:45] completely different than what you were
[1:10:46] amen because it's Jesus Christ it's a
[1:10:49] revelation of him of everything he is of
[1:10:51] everything that he does for you
[1:10:54] it's in you
[1:10:56] and then that Revelation the new birth
[1:10:58] amen when you're born again and when
[1:11:01] you're born again you're just a babe in
[1:11:03] Christ when you start out but that which
[1:11:05] is inside you that Revelation everything
[1:11:07] you have need of is within you every bit
[1:11:09] of healing everything you have need of
[1:11:11] rapturing faith is within you and it
[1:11:14] only takes time it only takes the course
[1:11:16] of your life and what God allows and
[1:11:19] that revelation of that new bird will
[1:11:21] Express healing in your life it will
[1:11:23] express everything you have need of for
[1:11:25] every part of the journey
[1:11:28] we won't make it without the new birth
[1:11:31] we won't make it without him coming in
[1:11:33] and changing us completely
[1:11:36] and so then you may not see it you may
[1:11:39] not understand it
[1:11:41] and as we said as time goes on as your
[1:11:43] life goes on it will be expressed
[1:11:45] whatever you have need of will be there
[1:11:48] because he is our everything he's he's
[1:11:50] our all in all amen
[1:11:54] so we got he said we got the answer to
[1:11:55] the devil's question it's Christ in you
[1:11:57] the hope of glory
[1:12:00] amen it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:12:03] glory the resurrected Lord Jesus living
[1:12:06] in the church amen gaining preeminence
[1:12:09] is backing up people amen amen the Satan
[1:12:13] Devils that he defeated he's going to
[1:12:14] come in you again amen and walk and live
[1:12:16] in you amen and he's going to give you
[1:12:18] strength he's going to give you courage
[1:12:20] he's going to give you ability he's
[1:12:21] going to give you everything that you
[1:12:23] have need of
[1:12:24] amen so we can walk unconscious this
[1:12:26] morning of fear we can walk unconscious
[1:12:29] amen a failure this morning if we really
[1:12:32] just let loose
[1:12:36] and he says in the New Birth brings you
[1:12:39] back to what Adam lost
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:45] in the fundamental foundation for Faith
[1:12:48] and I'll try to try to wind it down here
[1:12:50] the fundamental foundation for Faith he
[1:12:52] said now when God made man in the
[1:12:54] beginning he made him Superior to
[1:12:55] anything on the earth he gave him the
[1:12:57] jurisdiction of everything on Earth to
[1:13:00] control everything so he he had dominion
[1:13:03] over over all life over everything
[1:13:07] every animal
[1:13:09] every plant every tree every every
[1:13:12] element He had control and jurisdiction
[1:13:15] over that but the New Birth the new
[1:13:16] births he says brings you back to that
[1:13:19] and that's what we we want to try to
[1:13:21] understand here today and we've been
[1:13:23] brought back
[1:13:24] and then we're going we're going back
[1:13:26] even even further than where we are now
[1:13:29] amen amen we're going back to Perfection
[1:13:32] we don't see it just quite clearly we
[1:13:34] don't just see it quite fully amen but
[1:13:37] but it's happened
[1:13:38] it's began and there's nothing that can
[1:13:41] stop it right
[1:13:43] we're going back to that
[1:13:46] so he was made amen amen he was made the
[1:13:50] god of the Earth the second
[1:13:53] the secondary god of the Earth
[1:13:55] he controlled everything around he
[1:13:57] controlled everything brother Ram said I
[1:13:59] mean he controlled the atmospheres
[1:14:01] around him and he walked in perfect love
[1:14:03] and perfect faith in a perfect
[1:14:05] fellowship with his creator there was
[1:14:08] nothing in between him and God Amen and
[1:14:10] that was that was man's original
[1:14:11] condition and that's why you were
[1:14:14] designed to be
[1:14:16] that's what you were designed to be it
[1:14:18] wasn't just for Adam it wasn't just for
[1:14:20] Eve and then we can't never go back to
[1:14:22] that and we got to live in constant
[1:14:24] sorrow and and disruption and and
[1:14:27] confusion no we were meant to we were
[1:14:30] meant to be that and that's what God's
[1:14:32] trying to that's what God's trying to
[1:14:34] show in this age amen and Satan's eating
[1:14:36] amen there will be a people amen with a
[1:14:39] need and condition in their life amen
[1:14:40] amen everything may be going wrong but
[1:14:43] they've got to calm in the storm they've
[1:14:45] got a piece amen God of Faith amen
[1:14:47] because of the one amen that came in
[1:14:49] their life and brought a perfect love
[1:14:51] brought a perfect peace amen he brought
[1:14:53] us from from the old monk amen and it
[1:14:56] was love that done that and it created I
[1:14:58] mean it created a confidence in us and
[1:15:00] we can believe our God we can believe
[1:15:02] Amen in this word
[1:15:07] amen and we can begin to create an
[1:15:09] atmosphere around us say man no matter
[1:15:11] what's happening no matter what's going
[1:15:12] on no matter how how stupid things get
[1:15:16] how ignorant and and just evil things
[1:15:19] get and what what goes on Amen there's a
[1:15:21] people on this Earth amen amen to have
[1:15:24] an atmosphere about them amen an
[1:15:26] atmosphere of Faith amen they're they're
[1:15:28] creating and they're changing things
[1:15:30] around them amen because we've been
[1:15:32] called Amen to be little Messiahs little
[1:15:35] creators it was in us that's what we
[1:15:37] were designed to be
[1:15:40] that's why you can say something
[1:15:41] negative and watch it happen
[1:15:44] watch it take place
[1:15:46] every time
[1:15:48] watch it manifest itself down the road
[1:15:50] somewhere
[1:15:52] but then also you can say something
[1:15:53] something positive something that you
[1:15:55] want
[1:15:56] and it may take years
[1:15:59] and then one day you'll be walking in
[1:16:01] that and you'll remember what you said
[1:16:04] you'll remember that you you claimed
[1:16:06] that and that you're you're an heir with
[1:16:09] Christ you didn't do it out of want but
[1:16:11] you did it out of need it was something
[1:16:12] that you desired within you
[1:16:15] right
[1:16:18] we're creators
[1:16:20] and how much more the word has been
[1:16:23] given how much more Vindicated
[1:16:25] you know our words aren't so Vindicated
[1:16:28] though if God speaks it through you they
[1:16:31] believe it
[1:16:32] but how much more when we can speak and
[1:16:34] we can believe and we can amen that
[1:16:36] which has been Vindicated
[1:16:38] that which we have no shadow of a doubt
[1:16:41] that God come down and spoke to us in
[1:16:43] this age
[1:16:44] spoke to us what abroad would be spoke
[1:16:46] to us amen the blessings and and the
[1:16:49] things that that have been provided for
[1:16:51] you and I how much more can we take
[1:16:53] those things and and man and put it on
[1:16:56] our lips
[1:16:57] and let it go forth
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:02] amen is the anointed word
[1:17:05] don't count yourself out either
[1:17:08] if your heart's right your motives are
[1:17:10] right amen and
[1:17:12] amen and you're you're in the will of
[1:17:15] God
[1:17:16] speak the word and go forward
[1:17:19] speak to the storm
[1:17:21] amen David didn't have to go pray up
[1:17:25] hey man he he went forth into battle and
[1:17:27] he prophesied that he would defeat that
[1:17:29] Goliath he prophesied that he would cut
[1:17:31] his head off he couldn't go back and
[1:17:32] read that nowhere else
[1:17:34] amen but he went forth he didn't he was
[1:17:37] already prayed up
[1:17:38] but he spoke the word amen and it went
[1:17:40] out forth and defeated the enemy
[1:17:45] and brother Rome says now is the
[1:17:47] beginning of man that what God gave him
[1:17:49] power over everything on the earth now
[1:17:51] through the fall he lost that power then
[1:17:54] he becomes unconscious of the fact after
[1:17:56] losing his relationship and friendship
[1:17:58] and fellowship with the father
[1:18:01] and become unconscious of him and that
[1:18:04] that's where we are we're
[1:18:05] we're many times unconscious of it
[1:18:09] we've been so far removed from Eden
[1:18:12] right
[1:18:13] we've been so far removed amen we were
[1:18:16] we were in the mind of God we were there
[1:18:19] his thoughts and and that Perfection
[1:18:21] amen but the word is coming this hour
[1:18:23] Amen to bring us back to that and when
[1:18:26] the Holy Ghost is here Amen to change
[1:18:28] our lives to make us different and to
[1:18:31] bring us from glory to glory to bring us
[1:18:32] back to that amen don't be unconscious
[1:18:36] this morning amen amen amen don't be
[1:18:39] unconscious of who you are this morning
[1:18:42] amen have faith
[1:18:46] but it was because of the loss of
[1:18:47] Fellowship
[1:18:49] in the communion
[1:18:50] that's that's what made him unconscious
[1:18:52] of it
[1:18:54] amen keep keep the flame keep the flame
[1:18:57] burning in this hour
[1:18:58] keep the Flame Hard amen
[1:19:04] and he says here then he lost that all
[1:19:07] of his great channels become clogged up
[1:19:08] he couldn't get he couldn't get through
[1:19:10] now what Adam was in Christ's Christ
[1:19:13] redeemed us back to that
[1:19:15] now a redeemer to redeem anything is to
[1:19:19] bring it back to its original again oh
[1:19:22] what a redeemer we have
[1:19:24] oh what a Redemption that's taken place
[1:19:27] oh what a blood that was spilled
[1:19:31] oh oh what power is in the blood oh what
[1:19:34] power is in this word amen amen in the
[1:19:37] Revelation Amen to bring us back amen
[1:19:40] amen for one Amen to go and die on the
[1:19:43] cross amen and provide everything that
[1:19:45] we have need of to redeem us back to
[1:19:47] that original condition
[1:19:51] amen just walk unconscious of fear
[1:19:54] walk unconscious of fear in this hour
[1:19:56] amen amen amen amen walking perfect love
[1:20:00] perfect faith
[1:20:02] amen amen perfect faith is the master of
[1:20:05] all circumstances it's the master of
[1:20:07] every sickness every demon is subject to
[1:20:09] us here today you believe that
[1:20:12] he says here Adam never had to be sick
[1:20:14] he never had to die he never had to
[1:20:16] worry he never had a heartache he never
[1:20:18] had a fear he just clowned in the arms
[1:20:21] of father just like a child
[1:20:24] now I can't say that that I've never
[1:20:27] been sick because I have you can't say
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:30] well we're going back to that
[1:20:33] we're going back to a perfection
[1:20:36] amen and we don't have to wait amen on
[1:20:38] on a body change or to die to be healed
[1:20:41] well we can be healed today
[1:20:43] we can be here we we may still get sick
[1:20:46] we may not be in that Perfect Adam
[1:20:48] condition of what he fell from but the
[1:20:50] fullness of redemption is bringing us
[1:20:51] back to that amen but I'll say today you
[1:20:54] don't have to live with sin you don't
[1:20:56] have to live with your problems Amen in
[1:20:58] your failures and your mistakes amen

[1:21:02] bring a change amen there's a blood amen
[1:21:04] that speaks this morning
[1:21:06] and Redemption is speaking fullness of
[1:21:09] redemption is speaking this morning of a
[1:21:12] Rapture it's speaking of a body change I
[1:21:14] believe that's where we're going amen
[1:21:19] he said now the thing of it is since
[1:21:22] he has restored man back to that place
[1:21:24] the man and the fall lost his conscious
[1:21:26] of what the father put him on Earth here
[1:21:28] to do in other words all the plumbing
[1:21:30] it was all as it was in our brain he
[1:21:32] says and the outlets and the faith had
[1:21:34] been clogged up with business affair
[1:21:36] with home life domestic things it all
[1:21:38] becomes so clogged up with that until
