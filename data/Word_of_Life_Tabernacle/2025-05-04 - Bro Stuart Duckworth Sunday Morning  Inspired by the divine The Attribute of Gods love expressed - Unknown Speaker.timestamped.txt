[46:42] help in a time of need, in a time of
[46:45] trial, Lord, at whatever we're going
[46:46] through, whatever the need would be. We
[46:48] know that you're on time this morning.
[46:50] We know that you're able to speak to
[46:52] every heart. We know that you're able to
[46:54] move in every situation, Lord. Whatever
[46:56] the the need would be, small or great,
[46:58] Lord, we know that you're able this
[47:00] morning. So, we've got a faith and a
[47:02] love in you this morning, Lord. Our
[47:04] hearts are anchored, Lord, in you. Lord,
[47:07] we just ask now that you would just just
[47:09] move me aside this morning, Lord. May
[47:11] you just move in a special way for your
[47:13] people, Lord. May the word of God just
[47:15] come forth in power, Lord, in love. We

[47:30] these things.
[47:32] Amen. Amen. You love the Lord this
[47:35] morning.
[47:36] Amen. Amen. Just happy to be here. Amen.
[47:41] Let's just turn the scriptures
[47:43] to a familiar scripture. St.
[47:47] John 3 and
[47:51] 16. St. John 3 and
[47:55] 16. Certainly miss our brother Ben and
[47:58] brother Joel. We know they're at a
[48:00] wedding and I believe Brother Joel may
[48:02] be may be preaching this morning. I know
[48:04] brother Ben is too actually. And so
[48:06] we're just we'll be in prayer for them.
[48:09] Amen. I asked my kids what I should
[48:12] preach on and and uh Luke told me I
[48:15] should preach on Psalms
[48:17] 23. And then Maddie just said, "Make
[48:19] sure your title is not really long." And
[48:23] so I couldn't help you out, Maddie. I
[48:26] I've got a long title here this morning.
[48:28] They're writing everything down over
[48:30] there. And
[48:31] so, Amen. This uh St. John's
[48:36] 3:16, familiar scripture. For God so
[48:39] loved the world that he gave his only
[48:40] begotten son that whosoever believeth
[48:43] believeth in him should not perish but
[48:46] have everlasting life. For God sent not
[48:49] his son into the world to condemn the
[48:51] world but that the world through him
[48:53] might be saved. And he that believeth on
[48:56] him is not condemned. But he that
[48:58] believeth not is condemned already
[49:01] because he hath not believed in the name
[49:03] of the only begotten son of God. Amen.
[49:06] and you can be seated this morning. We
[49:08] just pray God would bless the reading of
[49:10] his word. Just kind of the the thought
[49:13] that we've been having for a little bit
[49:14] inspired by the divine and a subtitle of
[49:17] the attribute of God's love and grace
[49:20] expressed to us. We look here. Amen. God
[49:25] lo God so loved the world that he gave
[49:27] his only begotten son that that we who
[49:30] believe in him would not perish that we
[49:33] would not be lost that we would not be
[49:35] written off and and destroyed but that
[49:38] we would have everlasting life through
[49:41] God's son that he gave to to all of us
[49:45] to have everlasting life and not just
[49:48] from service to service or meeting to
[49:50] meeting but an eternal well springing up
[49:54] in our soul s it's an eternal well it's
[49:58] a everlasting peace it's an everlasting
[50:01] joy and and that's what God through
[50:03] Jesus Christ he he expressed himself and
[50:06] and gave himself uh through Jesus Christ
[50:09] amen to to give back that life and
[50:12] that's an it's an overcoming life that
[50:14] uh the overcoming life of Christ in the
[50:17] believer producing producing a love
[50:20] producing a a divine love a producing a
[50:23] faith a love of faith in his word.
[50:27] And brother Brham says here and familiar
[50:30] here, but he said, "I used to think that
[50:32] God was angry with me, but Christ loved
[50:35] me. And I come to find out that Christ
[50:38] was the very heart of God. He is God's
[50:41] heart, and Jesus Christ is God's heart."
[50:46] So, and we've ministered on these things
[50:48] before. Maybe just kind of go back over
[50:50] some of them.
[50:51] So all that God was, he expressed in
[50:54] that body of his son. And all that God
[50:58] was, he poured into Christ. And that
[51:01] life expressed and made visible, showed
[51:05] and put on display his eternal power and
[51:09] godhead.
[51:11] He showed us through his son his very
[51:14] own divine his his divine nature the
[51:17] nature of God that we might as the
[51:19] scripture says be more be made
[51:21] partakers. Amen. By divine allotment.
[51:25] Amen. All that and all that God was all
[51:27] that God was he poured into Christ.
[51:29] Amen. That we might be made partakers.
[51:32] Amen. All that God was that was in
[51:35] Christ and he pours into you and I. And
[51:37] that divine nature that God expressed
[51:40] that God put on display. Amen. He didn't
[51:42] just bottled up uh within himself,
[51:44] within his son, his only begotten son,
[51:46] but he gave his only begotten son. Amen.
[51:49] That that eternal godhead and power
[51:52] could be expressed. Amen. In a people,
[51:54] amen, in a young people and in an old
[51:56] people. And whoever would desire it,
[51:58] Amen. that it could be poured down. That
[52:00] eternal Godhead expressed. Amen. That
[52:03] divine nature. Amen. Amen. coming into
[52:06] this old sinful nature. Amen. The Bible
[52:08] says that we are born in sin, shaped in
[52:10] iniquity, coming into the world,
[52:12] speaking lies. But God so chose to
[52:14] express himself by his love and by his
[52:17] grace. Amen. And pour himself. Amen. And
[52:20] release himself, empty himself into
[52:22] Christ. Amen. That we could be made
[52:24] partakers of that divine nature, that
[52:28] expression of
[52:31] God. Amen.
[52:35] Amen. That that nature, God's nature
[52:37] comes down and it destroys our sin
[52:40] nature. It destroys. Amen. The the
[52:43] nature that you were born with. Amen.
[52:45] And then we then become bound. Amen. We
[52:47] were bound by the enemy. We were bound
[52:49] by the devil. We were bound by habits.
[52:51] Amen. Amen. But thanks be to God, love
[52:54] was expressed through Jesus Christ.
[52:56] Amen. And the love of God was shed
[52:58] abroad in our hearts by the indwelling
[53:01] by the filling of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[53:04] That's what it means this this morning.
[53:06] The the expression of love. That was God
[53:08] pouring himself. Amen. Expressing
[53:10] himself by the Holy Ghost and releasing
[53:14] you. Amen. You're released this morning.
[53:17] Amen. We can cut loose in the house of
[53:19] God this morning. Amen. You're released.
[53:21] Amen. We're no longer bound. Amen. You
[53:24] don't have to be bound. If you are bound
[53:26] this morning, there's been a releasing
[53:28] come by the expression of the love of
[53:30] Jesus Christ.
[53:33] Amen. We can cut loose this morning.
[53:35] Amen. We can worship God. We can respond
[53:38] to the word of God. We can enter in the
[53:40] service. Amen. Amen. You can come and
[53:42] get what you ask for. Amen. If you need
[53:44] something this morning, amen. Cut loose.
[53:46] Amen. Enter in the service. Amen. Reach
[53:49] out. Amen. And grab the blessing of
[53:52] God. Amen.
[53:57] Amen.
[53:59] Brother Renham says here in Christ is a
[54:00] mystery of God revealed. He said this is
[54:04] God's great mystery of love
[54:06] expressed that God and man became
[54:09] one. See the whole thing is God and man.
[54:12] God and man was one there and God and
[54:14] man is one here. See what is it? Being
[54:17] filled with his spirit. him having the
[54:21] preeminences. That was God's
[54:23] achievement. That was God's purpose to
[54:25] do that he might be in Christ and Christ
[54:29] in us. And all of us together, the Holy
[54:32] Spirit, the same thing. It revealed it
[54:34] to Christ. It reveals it here. Amen. It
[54:37] reveals it here. Amen. The supernatural
[54:40] creative power. Amen. That's the That's
[54:44] the That's what God has wanted all
[54:46] along. Amen. that supernatural creative
[54:49] power not just within himself. Amen. To
[54:52] speak worlds, to speak stars, and to
[54:54] speak this into existence. Amen. That he
[54:56] might have the preeminence in a man.
[54:59] Amen. And not just in that man, but that
[55:00] he might have preeminence in a young
[55:02] people. preeminence. Amen. In a people,
[55:05] amen, in the age of Leodysia, that he
[55:07] could express himself. That he could
[55:09] express his love and grace.
[55:13] That he could be your
[55:15] sufficiency. That in your in your dire
[55:18] time of need that he could be the one
[55:20] that could step in and express himself.
[55:23] Amen. And express himself. Amen. And
[55:25] have the preeminence. And and that you
[55:26] could have a testimony of no matter what
[55:29] no matter what the need would be, the
[55:31] sickness, the trial. Amen. You can say
[55:33] and you can testify by God's love and by
[55:36] God's grace, he brought me through it.
[55:38] Amen. I don't know how, but he's my
[55:40] sufficiency. I just stepped aside. I
[55:42] just moved aside and let him come in.
[55:44] That's all he wants this morning. He
[55:46] wants us to move aside. He wants us to
[55:48] step aside. Amen. That we that he could
[55:51] come in and have all preeminence and
[55:52] dwell in the fullness. Amen. And express
[55:56] his his power, express his love, express
[55:58] his grace to us. Amen. Amen.
[56:03] I'm going to preach myself out here too
[56:05] quick.
[56:07] You love the Lord this morning.
[56:16] Amen. We look at our
[56:19] scripture. For God so loved the
[56:23] world. For God so loved the world, he
[56:27] gave his life for mine. Thank you. He
[56:31] gave his life. He could have bottled it
[56:34] up within himself. Amen. He was a man
[56:38] just as I was. He had desires. He He
[56:41] wanted to He could have He had a right
[56:42] to have a family. Brother Ram said he
[56:44] had a right to have this and a right to
[56:46] have that. But he laid all that side
[56:49] aside and he sanctified himself for you
[56:51] and I. He sanctified himself. Amen. That
[56:54] we could that we could have fellowship
[56:56] this morning. Amen. That you could have
[56:58] fellowship with him. Amen. It's not
[57:00] something of the past. It's not
[57:02] something of the future. But he's a
[57:04] present tense God this morning. Amen.
[57:06] That's what how he wants to reveal
[57:07] himself. Amen. Amen. In present tense,
[57:14] to break the captive,
[57:18] to break us that were bound in chains.
[57:20] Amen. To show us power, to show us love,
[57:24] to break the chains that are upon our
[57:27] lives. And brother Ram tells a story
[57:30] here in God projecting his love. He
[57:32] talking about during the the civil war.
[57:35] He said there was a soldier that was
[57:37] tried and court marshal marshal for a
[57:40] certain crime and and this man was set
[57:42] to be shot at sunrise. And the day
[57:45] before some of his friends, some of his
[57:48] close companions, whoever, they went to
[57:51] the president and begged for this man's
[57:54] life. And the president, brother Bram,
[57:56] tells the story of being in a hurry,
[57:59] being in a hurry to having different
[58:01] things to do, picked up a a small piece
[58:03] of paper and wrote on it, "I pardon this
[58:08] man, and signed his name, Abraham
[58:12] Lincoln."
[58:13] And the carrier brought the piece of
[58:15] paper down there. The pardon on this
[58:17] piece of paper, the releasing power on
[58:20] this piece of paper signed by the
[58:22] president of the United States. Amen. He
[58:26] carried this piece of paper and he
[58:27] brought it to the cell and and said to
[58:29] the man, "You're free. You're
[58:31] free. The pardoning is here. You're
[58:36] free." But the man looked and there just
[58:39] he said it just didn't mean much to him.
[58:41] It didn't seem official. there just just
[58:43] on a piece of paper. Amen. But on that
[58:46] piece of paper was a man that wrote that
[58:49] had authority. Was a man that wrote that
[58:52] had something that would back up his
[58:53] word.
[58:55] We we've seen the pardons now. It's
[58:57] almost a
[58:58] joke. There is pardoning whoever for
[59:02] whatever reason. But this man, he was in
[59:05] need of a pardon. He needed this. It was
[59:08] a life and death situation.
[59:11] But he wrote it off like it was
[59:14] nothing. Like it was nothing. It did. It
[59:17] didn't mean nothing to him. It didn't
[59:18] come in a great way. The president
[59:20] didn't come
[59:22] himself. His word wasn't good enough.
[59:25] You see what I mean this morning? The
[59:27] the word has got to mean something to
[59:29] us. It's more than more than just words
[59:31] on a page. It's more than just a book.
[59:33] Amen. But there's an authority behind
[59:35] the word of God. There's an authority.
[59:37] Amen. When you open your Bible and you
[59:39] read, Amen. And that authority, amen, is
[59:41] there to give you power because we have
[59:43] no power of our own. We have no power to
[59:45] break the chains upon us. Amen. But God
[59:48] has given you authority by the word of
[59:50] God. Amen. He's given you the power.
[59:52] Amen. If you can accept it, Amen.
[59:54] There's a releasing power this morning.
[59:57] Amen. You can cut loose of everything
[59:59] that's holding you back as a son or
[1:00:01] daughter of God. Amen. And if we miss
[1:00:03] that, if we're just good message people
[1:00:05] sitting on a pew, we've missed it. We've
[1:00:07] missed it in this hour. Amen. God has
[1:00:10] come. Amen. And brought his word. Amen.
[1:00:12] God has come and brought his love. Amen.
[1:00:14] To bring forth sons and daughters of the
[1:00:16] word. Amen.
[1:00:24] The next morning the man wrote it off.
[1:00:27] The next morning the man died and
[1:00:30] sentenced by the fire the by the firing
[1:00:33] squad. There the paper was written with
[1:00:36] the president's name. the man is p
[1:00:38] pardoned and they shot him after the man
[1:00:41] the president pardoned him and they took
[1:00:44] this and they I guess he found out about
[1:00:46] it that why was this man shot? Why was
[1:00:50] this man killed? He had a pardon and
[1:00:52] they determined that a pardon can only
[1:00:54] be re be a pardon except it be received
[1:00:59] as a pardon. Amen. We've got to receive
[1:01:02] the pardon this morning. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:05] Don't beat yourself up. Amen. There's a
[1:01:07] pardon written for you in this hour.
[1:01:09] Don't let Satan beat you over the head
[1:01:11] by what you done yesterday. There's a
[1:01:13] pardon in this hour. Amen. There's a
[1:01:15] word of God, amen, that releases you and
[1:01:17] I. Amen. And it is written by the blood
[1:01:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. All
[1:01:22] authority, all heaven is behind it in
[1:01:24] this hour. Amen. All heaven is behind
[1:01:26] the word of God in this hour.
[1:01:30] We can be free.
[1:01:33] See, the man took the wrong attitude
[1:01:35] towards the pardon. Maybe it didn't come
[1:01:39] the way that he thought it should have,
[1:01:42] but it come nonetheless.
[1:01:44] Amen. The authority was there, but it
[1:01:46] had to be received as a pardon. And
[1:01:49] brother Ram says here, he says, St. John
[1:01:51] 3:16 is a pardon to every mortal man and
[1:01:54] woman on earth. If if it's received as a
[1:01:56] pardon, but if it's not, you're still
[1:01:58] condemned. For God so loved the world,
[1:02:00] he said, "What a pardon to Adam's fallen
[1:02:02] race to any man or woman that wants to
[1:02:05] receive it. It's a free pardon for you
[1:02:07] and me. All we've got to do is read and
[1:02:10] hear that pardon and accept that
[1:02:12] pardon." Amen. Amen. And he goes on to
[1:02:14] say, "The love of God, love is a
[1:02:17] powerful force. When love is projected
[1:02:19] and it and it comes to its end, it
[1:02:21] strength, sovereign grace will take it
[1:02:23] up from there and project the object
[1:02:26] that it's asked for." Amen. That's the
[1:02:28] reason we have a savior tonight because
[1:02:30] God loved the world and that and being
[1:02:33] projected to the world produced a
[1:02:34] savior.
[1:02:36] He says here God wanted this wanted to
[1:02:38] see you well so much his love went out
[1:02:42] and it produced an atonement for your
[1:02:43] sickness and for your sins. It was a
[1:02:46] love that constrained him to do it.
[1:02:50] Amen. Love constrained God to produce a
[1:02:53] savior. Amen. God had within him. God
[1:02:57] had within him attributes to be
[1:02:59] expressed. Attributes to be a savior, to
[1:03:02] be a healer, to be a redeemer. And his
[1:03:05] love constrained him. It compelled him
[1:03:09] to express himself to all who could
[1:03:11] receive and accept the pardon.
[1:03:16] Yes, sir.
[1:03:19] To all who could receive and accept it.
[1:03:22] St. John 3:16, the the scripture that we
[1:03:25] know so well for God so loved the world
[1:03:27] that he be gave his only begotten son.
[1:03:29] The one that we know so well, it is a
[1:03:32] pardon to you and I. It is a pardon to
[1:03:36] Adam's fallen race. Adam and Eve sold
[1:03:39] you out. They sold me out. Amen. They
[1:03:44] sold us out when they when they got be
[1:03:47] away from the word. They sold us out
[1:03:49] when they and when they accepted the lie
[1:03:51] of the devil. Amen. And they sold us
[1:03:53] out. Amen. And they put us in the
[1:03:55] devil's pawn shop. But brother Ram said,
[1:03:58] "Thanks be to God." Amen. I was in the
[1:03:59] devil's pawn shop. But one day, Jesus
[1:04:02] come by. The one who paid the price. The
[1:04:04] one who had the pardoning power. The one
[1:04:06] that loved me so so much that would come
[1:04:09] down and lift me up from from what I was
[1:04:11] when I was unlovable. Amen. I we we
[1:04:14] deserve God's judgment, but he took
[1:04:16] God's judgment upon himself. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:19] You don't have to stand. You don't have
[1:04:21] to sit in condemnation, amen, with that
[1:04:23] feeling all over you. Amen. That you're
[1:04:25] not going to make it. That you're going
[1:04:26] to hell. Amen. There's a releasing power
[1:04:29] in this hour. There's a releasing power
[1:04:31] this morning. There's a releasing power
[1:04:33] this morning here if you'll accept it.
[1:04:38] Now, I know I'm preaching to the saved.
[1:04:40] This is just what's on my heart.
[1:04:43] If it ain't for you, then just throw it
[1:04:45] out and just just preach with me. Okay?
[1:04:55] Amen. Amen. Jesus paid the
[1:04:59] price. He paid the price. You believe
[1:05:01] that this morning that he paid the
[1:05:03] price. He paid the ultimate
[1:05:06] price. And when you purchase something,
[1:05:09] when you go buy
[1:05:11] something, you don't just wait a couple
[1:05:13] years to go get it. Amen. You go get it.
[1:05:18] I'm going to pick it up. Man, I spent
[1:05:21] money on this. Saved up.
[1:05:24] It's mine.
[1:05:26] And Jesus Christ gave his blood, spilled
[1:05:30] his blood. He didn't purchase you to
[1:05:32] lose you. Amen. But he's coming to get
[1:05:35] you this morning. He's coming to get
[1:05:37] you. Amen. It's a predestinated moment.
[1:05:39] It's a predestinated hour. What a time
[1:05:41] it is to be a Christian. What a time it
[1:05:43] is to be alive. What a time it is for
[1:05:46] God to choose you and I to live. Amen.
[1:05:48] And come and we can accept the
[1:05:50] blessings, accept the grace of God.
[1:05:52] Amen. And be an expression of what he
[1:05:54] did for us. What a time it is to be a
[1:05:57] Christian. Amen. The world is in chaos.
[1:05:59] Amen. The world is in confusion. Amen.
[1:06:01] But the bride is not in chaos. She is
[1:06:03] not in confusion. Amen. God has spoke
[1:06:06] directly to her. Amen. By the prophet of
[1:06:08] Malachi 4. Amen. Amen. God has revealed
[1:06:11] himself to her through St. Luke 17:30.
[1:06:14] Amen. God has revealed the mystery.
[1:06:16] Amen. It's no longer a hidden thing.
[1:06:18] Amen. Revelation 10:7. Amen. The whole
[1:06:20] thing has been blowed wide open.
[1:06:22] Everything's been showed to you. Amen.
[1:06:24] Just come and accept it in this hour.
[1:06:26] Amen. Accept it. Amen. That you're a
[1:06:28] part of it. Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] You buy
[1:06:36] something, I'm going to go pick it up.
[1:06:39] And the pardoning and purchasing power
[1:06:40] of the blood has redeemed us from our
[1:06:43] fallen condition and it's able to pick
[1:06:46] us up. Amen. It's not it's not a
[1:06:49] something that's
[1:06:51] ineffective. Man, I'm preaching right at
[1:06:53] these guys here. I'm sorry. Sorry,
[1:06:55] y'all. Right
[1:06:58] here. It's effective this morning. It's
[1:07:03] effective. We can testify of its power
[1:07:05] this morning. We can testify of its
[1:07:08] goodness. We can testify that it works.
[1:07:11] That we were down low, as low as we
[1:07:13] could go in sin, but something picked us
[1:07:17] up. We weren't worthy. Amen. But he made
[1:07:20] us worthy. Amen. One that was worthy.
[1:07:23] Come by. Moses wasn't worthy. He made
[1:07:25] mistakes. David wasn't worthy. He made
[1:07:27] mistakes. Paul wasn't worthy. He made
[1:07:29] mistakes. Brother Brandon wasn't worthy.
[1:07:31] No man was worthy, but one man. Amen.
[1:07:33] And that man gave his life. He gave us
[1:07:35] all. Amen. To pick you up and to bring
[1:07:38] you out. Amen. In this hour.
[1:07:45] Yes, sir.
[1:07:50] Amen. His grace came to me when I was
[1:07:51] lost.
[1:07:53] Came to me when I was bound. Thank Thank
[1:07:57] you, Lord, that I had enough faith to
[1:07:58] realize it. Amen. That you had an ear to
[1:08:01] hear and that you had eyes to see. Amen.
[1:08:04] And there was a tug on your heart. Be
[1:08:06] thankful in this hour. There's a tug on
[1:08:07] on your heart. Amen. To be able to hear
[1:08:09] the voice of God. Amen. To hear the
[1:08:11] wooing of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Saying,
[1:08:13] "You are you are mine. You are mine.
[1:08:16] Come unto me." Amen. All you that are
[1:08:18] heavy laden. And I will give you the
[1:08:19] rest of the Holy Ghost. Amen. You won't
[1:08:22] no longer. It won't be you trying to do
[1:08:24] it, but I'll come and do it through you.
[1:08:26] That's what the Holy Ghost is. It's him
[1:08:28] in you. It's greater is he that is in
[1:08:30] you than the devil of Leodysia of this
[1:08:32] lukewarm condition of this lukewarm hour
[1:08:35] that we live in. Amen. Greater is he
[1:08:36] that is in us. Amen.
[1:08:42] John
[1:08:43] 8:36 the son therefore shall make you
[1:08:46] free. You shall be be free indeed.
[1:08:51] Amen. Not part of the way, not halfway.
[1:08:55] God God don't have no halfway
[1:08:56] Christians. You're not a sinner and a
[1:08:58] saint. Amen. He's made you free in this
[1:09:00] hour. Amen. If there will make you free,
[1:09:03] you shall be free indeed. Amen. He
[1:09:05] picked you up. He made you free. Amen.
[1:09:08] He made you that. Amen. He made you free
[1:09:11] in this hour. Amen. Don't go back to the
[1:09:13] bondage of of the world. Don't go back
[1:09:15] to the the weak and beggarly elements of
[1:09:18] of the things of this life. Don't go
[1:09:20] back and be tied down and choked down by
[1:09:22] those things. Amen. Be free in this hour
[1:09:24] by the pardoning and the love of Jesus
[1:09:27] Christ.
[1:09:28] Romans
[1:09:33] 8:31 love the
[1:09:36] scripture. There is therefore now
[1:09:38] no
[1:09:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:09:42] Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
[1:09:45] after the spirit. For the law of the
[1:09:48] spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
[1:09:51] me free from the law of sin and death.
[1:09:54] For what the law could not do, and that
[1:09:56] it was weak through the flesh, God
[1:09:59] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:10:01] sinful
[1:10:03] flesh or and for sin condemns sin in the
[1:10:07] flesh. So what the what he's saying
[1:10:10] here, the what the law couldn't do, what
[1:10:11] it couldn't produce, the Holy Spirit
[1:10:14] could. And on Mount
[1:10:16] Transfiguration, there was Christ and
[1:10:19] there was Moses and Elijah. And Peter
[1:10:22] there tried to quickly make a a
[1:10:23] denomination out of the thing. He tried
[1:10:26] to make a tabernacle for Elijah and one
[1:10:28] for Moses and one for Jesus. But in the
[1:10:31] end, Amen. Moses and Elijah went away.
[1:10:33] The law and the prophets went away.
[1:10:35] Amen. There was no releasing power in
[1:10:38] the law and the prophets. Amen. It was
[1:10:40] weak. It could not deliver this flesh.
[1:10:41] Amen. But in the end, all they could see
[1:10:44] was Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Hear ye
[1:10:47] him. Hear ye him. Amen. Amen. And this
[1:10:50] is whom and my beloved son and whom I'm
[1:10:52] pleased to dwell in. Hear ye him. Amen.
[1:10:55] Hear his voice in the in this hour, man.
[1:10:58] When you read the scripture, when you
[1:10:59] hear the message, amen. Amen. That
[1:11:01] that's a deity expressed in this hour.
[1:11:03] That is the light expressed in this
[1:11:05] hour. Amen. Through the word of God
[1:11:07] speaking to you. Amen. Trying to give
[1:11:09] you power. trying to give you, amen,
[1:11:11] that power to to release you.
[1:11:18] Amen. And when you hear him, there's no
[1:11:21] condemnation. Amen. There's no
[1:11:23] condemnation. Amen. The sentence. Amen.
[1:11:26] That that that that this world that the
[1:11:28] that the devil put on you. Amen. That
[1:11:30] damnatory sentence there. That's what
[1:11:31] that word means. The damnatory sentence.
[1:11:34] Amen. That condition. Amen. He took you
[1:11:36] from that condition. Amen. He took your
[1:11:38] prison sentence. Amen. He went to prison
[1:11:40] for you. He went to hell for you. He
[1:11:43] took the sentence for you. He did the
[1:11:46] time. Amen. Amen. On the third day, he
[1:11:49] rose again. Amen. Amen. And that body
[1:11:51] would not see corruption. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:53] But he did the time that was necessary.
[1:11:56] Amen. He went to jail for you and I. Oh
[1:11:59] Lord,
[1:12:01] I wish I could
[1:12:03] preach. I'll eat that
[1:12:06] later. That'd be good. on my
[1:12:12] stomach. Man, he did the time. I
[1:12:15] couldn't do the time. I couldn't go to
[1:12:19] hell. We deserve to go to hell. But we
[1:12:22] don't have to. He did the time. Amen.
[1:12:26] Amen. He went to hell and he took the
[1:12:28] keys. Amen. He overcome death, hell, and
[1:12:31] the grave and rose again on the third
[1:12:34] day. Amen. God's expression of love and
[1:12:37] grace produced that. It produced a
[1:12:39] blood. It produced an atonement. Amen.
[1:12:41] To for sin. It produced a Holy Ghost and
[1:12:44] overcoming life for you and
[1:12:47] I. Oh
[1:12:49] my Lord help
[1:12:53] us.
[1:12:55] 1957. Why some people can't keep the
[1:12:57] victory. I I like the title of that
[1:12:59] sermon. You go listen to that this
[1:13:02] week. Look what he said here. Listen. Oh
[1:13:07] brother, God gave the Holy Spirit, God's
[1:13:09] love to control the church. Not smart,
[1:13:12] educated, but love. Gifts goes in the
[1:13:15] church, but it don't control the church.
[1:13:17] Love controls the church. And God so
[1:13:20] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:13:21] begotten son. His love constrain him to
[1:13:24] do it. And when a love is constrained
[1:13:26] and sovereign grace projects its
[1:13:29] object. And may I say that again? When
[1:13:31] divine love is projected, grace produces
[1:13:33] its object. And God loved the world so
[1:13:36] much that sovereign grace projected a
[1:13:38] savior to the world. He said, "Yes
[1:13:41] indeed. When you love God so much,
[1:13:42] sovereign grace will project to you the
[1:13:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost to make you
[1:13:47] live and love and be a real Christian."
[1:13:50] Amen. Is that what you want to be in
[1:13:52] this hour? Amen. Do you want to be a a
[1:13:54] real Christian? Amen. To have life. To
[1:13:57] have love. Not to be a not to be
[1:13:58] hateful.
[1:14:00] Not to be sinful. Amen. But to but to
[1:14:03] have life. to have the life of Jesus
[1:14:04] Christ projected the overcoming life.
[1:14:07] Amen. And he said, "Whosoever believes
[1:14:09] in him, as we read, whosoever believes
[1:14:11] in him shall not perish but have
[1:14:14] everlasting life."
[1:14:18] You believe it this morning?
[1:14:21] Do you really believe it?
[1:14:25] It's an everlasting life to the
[1:14:28] believer, to whoever can accept it.
[1:14:32] It's everything you have need
[1:14:36] of. Read here in Numbers 20 and
[1:14:45] two. 20 and two. Numbers 20 and two. And
[1:14:48] there was no water for the
[1:14:50] congregation. And they gathered
[1:14:52] themselves together against Moses and
[1:14:54] Aaron. And the people choed with Moses
[1:14:57] and spake, saying, ' Would God that we
[1:14:59] had died when our brethren died before
[1:15:02] the Lord? And why have you brought the
[1:15:04] congregation of the Lord into this
[1:15:06] wilderness, that we and our cattle
[1:15:08] should die there? And wherefore have you
[1:15:11] made us to come up out of Egypt to bring
[1:15:13] us unto this evil place?
[1:15:16] It is a it is no place of seed or of
[1:15:19] figs or of vines or pomegranates.
[1:15:22] Neither is there any water to drink. And
[1:15:25] Moses and Aaron went from the presence
[1:15:27] of the assembly unto the door of the
[1:15:29] tabernacle of the congregation, and they
[1:15:31] fell upon their faces. And the glory of
[1:15:34] the Lord appeared unto them. And the
[1:15:37] Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take thy
[1:15:39] rod, and gather thou the assembly
[1:15:41] together. For thou and Aaron, thy
[1:15:43] brethren speak ye unto the rock before
[1:15:46] their eyes, and it shall give forth his
[1:15:48] water, and thou shalt bring forth to
[1:15:50] them water out of the rock. So thou
[1:15:53] shalt give the congregation and their
[1:15:56] beast drink. And Moses took the rod from
[1:15:58] before the Lord, as he commanded him.
[1:16:02] And Moses and Aaron gathered the
[1:16:04] congregation together before the rock
[1:16:05] and said unto them, "Here now, ye
[1:16:07] rebels, must we fetch you water out of
[1:16:10] this rock." And Moses lifted up his
[1:16:13] hand, and with his rod he smoked the
[1:16:15] rock twice, and the water came out
[1:16:18] abundantly, and the congregation drank,
[1:16:20] and their beast
[1:16:22] also. And the Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:16:25] Aaron, because you believed me not to
[1:16:28] sanctify me in the eyes of the children
[1:16:30] of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring
[1:16:32] this congregation into the land which I
[1:16:35] have given them. He said, "This is the
[1:16:38] water of Meabbah. Because the children
[1:16:40] of Israel strove with the Lord, and he
[1:16:43] was sanctified in
[1:16:46] them." That word Meaba there means
[1:16:48] strife and contention.
[1:16:51] We see here Moses got himself into
[1:16:54] trouble. It cost him being able to go
[1:16:57] into the land to be able to lead the
[1:16:59] children of Israel into the land. The
[1:17:02] Lord told him because you have believed
[1:17:04] me not because of your unbelief and your
[1:17:07] distrust in what I said. You did not
[1:17:10] sanctify me. You did not honor me. You
[1:17:13] did not honor what I said. The people
[1:17:16] made it hard on Moses. They chided the
[1:17:19] prophet by complaining about the dryness
[1:17:22] of the
[1:17:23] wilderness. The people made it hard on
[1:17:26] Moses. They chided the prophet by
[1:17:28] complaining and
[1:17:30] complaining. And they let their love,
[1:17:32] listen to this, they let their love for
[1:17:34] the promise of God to bring them to the
[1:17:38] to the land leave their hearts. They let
[1:17:40] that love leave their hearts for that
[1:17:42] promise that he would see them through.
[1:17:44] that he would bring them through to the
[1:17:45] place that he told them. Their heart
[1:17:48] wasn't wasn't in it anymore. That's
[1:17:50] right. The way became too hard.
[1:17:55] Don't let that be us in this hour. Amen.
[1:17:58] When the way gets hard, may we just draw
[1:18:00] that much nearer to the word. Amen. May
[1:18:03] God give us a renewing day by day by
[1:18:07] day. Amen. We go through hard things. We
[1:18:09] go through hard times. Amen. But each
[1:18:11] morning, the Bible says, each morning,
[1:18:13] his mercies are new. Amen. It can be a
[1:18:16] new day. It ain't got to be what it was
[1:18:18] yesterday. That was yesterday's child.
[1:18:20] Amen. Amen. Today is a new day. This
[1:18:24] church service is a new church service.
[1:18:26] Amen. We can come with a different
[1:18:27] expectation. Amen. It's not got to got
[1:18:30] to be what it was before. My my my
[1:18:33] expectation can be greater. It can be
[1:18:36] something greater. Amen. Amen. I can
[1:18:37] live. Amen. Amen. not off what yesterday
[1:18:40] was. Amen. But I can look forward, amen,
[1:18:42] to know that there's a God, amen, that
[1:18:44] can renew my life. Amen. I I may have
[1:18:47] wonderings. I may have backslidings.
[1:18:48] Amen. But that there's a voice of God,
[1:18:50] amen, speaking to your heart. Amen.
[1:18:52] Amen. Let him come in and renew that
[1:18:54] flame. Let him renew that love. Amen.
[1:18:58] I'm just preaching to you. If we can get
[1:19:01] to the 45 mark, I'll let y'all out.
[1:19:04] Okay.
[1:19:09] But
[1:19:10] see, they left God.
[1:19:14] They begin to complain. They begin to
[1:19:16] murmur. They're the ones that left him.
[1:19:19] God never leaves you and I. It's us that
[1:19:21] leave him. It's us that make it hard on
[1:19:24] ourselves. Amen. But he he's always
[1:19:26] there. Amen. He said he would never
[1:19:29] leave us nor forsake us. Amen. And that
[1:19:32] rock that had that water followed them
[1:19:35] wherever they went. They didn't have to
[1:19:37] complain. The Rock was there the whole
[1:19:40] time. And you don't have to complain
[1:19:42] about the service this morning and the
[1:19:44] preacher and and who didn't show up and
[1:19:46] and who did show up. You don't have to
[1:19:48] complain. The rock's here this morning.
[1:19:50] Amen. The rock's here. It's an eternal
[1:19:52] rock. Amen. Amen. The pillar of fire has
[1:19:55] returned after 2,000 years. Amen. God
[1:19:58] has shown himself alive. That he's the
[1:20:00] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[1:20:02] don't have to complain. It's not my
[1:20:04] responsibility to bring the presence of
[1:20:06] God. It's God's responsibility. Amen. To
[1:20:09] come in this hour. Amen. It's our
[1:20:10] responsibility to show up. Amen. To come
[1:20:13] our way. To come to meet God
[1:20:18] halfway, sir.
[1:20:20] I ain't trying to be mean.
[1:20:26] If you're thirsty this morning, come get
[1:20:29] a drink.
[1:20:31] If your soul's thirsty this morning,
[1:20:33] speak to the rock this morning.
[1:20:38] But there Moses, instead of taking the
[1:20:41] divine instructions that had been
[1:20:43] given, the commandment of God only
[1:20:46] required for it to be smitten once. This
[1:20:48] rock had already been smitten. And the
[1:20:51] divine instructions told them that after
[1:20:53] the this rock was struck by the rod of
[1:20:56] Moses, then to then speak to the rock.
[1:20:59] Amen. in the time. But you know, you
[1:21:02] know, when things get hard, when things
[1:21:03] get rough, when things get dry, you
[1:21:06] know, in the in the times of desert,
[1:21:08] Amen. Everybody gets all worked up,
[1:21:10] don't they? When things ain't going the
[1:21:12] right way. Amen. When the bills are
[1:21:15] piling up, Amen. You know, we all get a
[1:21:17] little frustrated. Amen. When things
[1:21:20] ain't quite going our way. Amen. We're
[1:21:22] in a wilderness. We're We're in a
[1:21:25] wilderness.
[1:21:26] We
[1:21:27] are. We're going to the rapture.
[1:21:31] We're we're in type, you know, we can we
[1:21:33] can put ourselves in a land you can Hey,
[1:21:36] hey, this is a wilderness journey. We're
[1:21:38] on a journey by faith. And it's going to
[1:21:41] take faith to get us from point A to
[1:21:42] point B. And point A is is he that began
[1:21:46] a good work and point B will be the he
[1:21:49] that that finishes it. Amen. And I just
[1:21:51] got to put faith and confidence in him
[1:21:53] that that he's going to provide that
[1:21:55] he's going to see me through. That
[1:21:56] whenever whenever a situation rises that
[1:21:59] that when I meet it that God will meet
[1:22:00] me there. I've got to believe that.
[1:22:02] Amen. We're on a journey. Amen. We've
[1:22:04] got needs. Amen. We've got we got things
[1:22:06] that we go through. Amen. But there's
[1:22:07] there's an everpresent help this
[1:22:09] morning. Amen. It's more than the
[1:22:11] preacher. It's more than the deacons.
[1:22:12] It's more than more than even a prophet.
[1:22:14] Amen. There was a rock. Amen. Even when
[1:22:17] Moses disobeyed. Amen. There was a rock
[1:22:19] there. Even when he didn't do it exactly
[1:22:21] like God God showed him and God told
[1:22:23] him, "Amen, the waters still came
[1:22:25] forth." Amen. Because God's got a people
[1:22:27] that he's going to bring through. Amen.
[1:22:29] He's got a people that he's going to
[1:22:30] bring to the land. Amen. He's got a
[1:22:32] people this morning that he's going to
[1:22:34] bring to a rapture. Amen. Amen. In a
[1:22:36] moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Amen.
[1:22:38] We shall be changed. Amen. We're going
[1:22:40] to be changed. Amen. From what? These
[1:22:42] old bodies are going to change. Amen.
[1:22:44] They're going to put on incorruption.
[1:22:47] God's bringing us to that place. I got
[1:22:50] to believe it. You got to believe it.
[1:22:53] Amen. Don't lose your way because things
[1:22:55] get hard. Amen. You got to believe it.
[1:22:57] You got to press on in Jesus name.
[1:23:04] But in the dry
[1:23:06] times, the times of what seems like dire
[1:23:09] need, when we come under trials and
[1:23:12] tribulations, famine, temptation, the
[1:23:14] way becomes harder than what we expected
[1:23:16] it to
[1:23:18] be. I didn't expect it to be this
[1:23:21] hard. I'm a young person. I didn't
[1:23:24] expect it to be like
[1:23:26] this. I'm
[1:23:28] alone. It's hard. It's not easy.
[1:23:33] It's not supposed to be easy.
[1:23:36] Amen. But in those hard times, that's
[1:23:38] where he meets you. In those hard times,
[1:23:41] he'll give you a drink. When your throat
[1:23:43] is parched and you you're dry and you
[1:23:45] don't know how much further you can make
[1:23:47] it. Amen. God will give you something to
[1:23:49] eat. God will give you something. Amen.
[1:23:51] He'll come by your way. Amen. He'll
[1:23:54] he'll he'll give you a scripture. He'll
[1:23:56] give you a message to listen to. You'll
[1:23:58] let the preacher say one thing if he can
[1:24:01] give you a drink. You can keep going.
[1:24:05] Amen.
[1:24:07] Sometimes it's like that.
[1:24:11] We don't have to be parched this
[1:24:13] morning. We don't have to be parched.
[1:24:15] There's a case of water back there. I
[1:24:17] can drink till I can't drink no
[1:24:19] more. There's more than enough this
[1:24:22] morning for everybody to go around. You
[1:24:24] don't have to be parched in the desert.
[1:24:26] You can be full of life and full of
[1:24:28] water.
[1:24:32] But we complain when it gets hard. We
[1:24:35] complain about the hard times. We
[1:24:37] complain about the dryness of the
[1:24:39] service. But remember, there's a rock in
[1:24:41] a weary land. There's a rock this
[1:24:44] morning in your weary land. Amen. All
[1:24:45] you have to do is speak to the rock. All
[1:24:47] you have to do is begin to worship him
[1:24:49] in spirit and in truth. Amen. And watch
[1:24:52] him come on the scene. I believe that
[1:24:54] this morning. Show up in this service.
[1:24:56] show up in the next service. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:58] He He's an on time God. Amen. To show up
[1:25:00] to prove that he's the same yesterday,
[1:25:03] today, and forever. Amen. You can speak
[1:25:05] to the rock this morning. Whatever you
[1:25:07] have need of.
[1:25:13] When we become exhausted and tired and
[1:25:15] faint, don't lose your love for the word
[1:25:19] because it's not going your way. Don't
[1:25:22] become contentious. Don't live in the
[1:25:25] land of strife. Don't drink the water of
[1:25:27] strife. Don't become contentious with
[1:25:28] the message. Don't become contentious
[1:25:30] with your brother and sister. We're all
[1:25:32] trying to get to the same place. Amen.
[1:25:35] And together we press towards the prize
[1:25:37] of of the high calling of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:40] We're pressing. Amen. Don't be hard on
[1:25:42] one another. Don't don't be hard on
[1:25:44] Moses. Don't be hard on on the message.
[1:25:47] Amen. Don't be hard on the pastor. Don't
[1:25:49] be hard on whoever. Your brother and
[1:25:50] sister, your mom and dad. Amen. We're
[1:25:52] all trying to get to the same place.
[1:25:54] Amen. Amen. Don't lose your love. Don't
[1:25:56] lose your focus like they did.
[1:26:00] And a God that will bring you through,
[1:26:02] that will lift you up. Amen.
[1:26:08] Listen. The same God that inspired and
[1:26:12] told a prophet to take his rod and
[1:26:15] strike the waters of the Red Sea to make
[1:26:17] a way. That was the same God that made a
[1:26:21] way when they when they come to the
[1:26:23] river Jordan and they parted the waters
[1:26:26] there and they walked upon dry ground.
[1:26:27] The river was high. There was no way
[1:26:29] across. But the same God that was at the
[1:26:31] Red Sea was the same God that was at
[1:26:34] Jordan. Amen. Elijah, Amen. When he went
[1:26:37] away, Elisha got my father, my father,
[1:26:40] the horsemen and the chariots thereof.
[1:26:42] Amen. Amen. But when he come to the
[1:26:43] river, Amen. He took that man of Elijah.
[1:26:46] He didn't say, "Where is where is
[1:26:47] Elijah?" He struck the waters and he
[1:26:50] said, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"
[1:26:52] Amen. We don't need a prophet to come
[1:26:54] back on the scene. Amen. Jesus Christ is
[1:26:56] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:26:58] Amen. Everything that he could ever do
[1:27:00] for you, he did while he was in this
[1:27:02] flesh. Amen. And if he's not the same in
[1:27:04] every way now, then he's not God. Amen.
[1:27:07] He's the omnipotent, the omn
[1:27:09] omnipresent, omnisient. He knows your
[1:27:12] need. Amen. And he is all powerful this
[1:27:14] morning. And he's an ontime God. Amen.
[1:27:16] He knows right when to show up. Yes,
[1:27:18] sir. But you got to call that God upon
[1:27:21] the scene. Amen. Amen. Not Elijah, not
[1:27:24] your not your favorite preacher. Amen.
[1:27:26] That God's got to be in you. Amen. And
[1:27:28] you call him on the
[1:27:32] scene. That same
[1:27:35] God that said, "Smite the rock, the rock
[1:27:38] once, and then speak." That same God has
[1:27:42] provided you everything you have need of
[1:27:44] to make a rapture. I believe that in
[1:27:47] this hour, don't you? Don't you believe
[1:27:49] he's sufficient in this hour? Amen. The
[1:27:52] Holy Ghost. Amen. Taking the word,
[1:27:54] living upon the word. Amen. Worshiping
[1:27:56] him in spirit and truth. Amen. Building
[1:27:58] up the believer. Building up your holy
[1:28:00] faith and the oracles of God. Building
[1:28:03] the son and daughter of God to meet the
[1:28:05] challenge of the hour. Amen.
[1:28:11] It takes God's love.
[1:28:14] Only way we'll make it is by his grace,
[1:28:16] by his
[1:28:17] love. That's the only way we'll make
[1:28:20] it. Brother said, "It'll take it'll take
[1:28:23] perfect love to be in that place." The
[1:28:27] divine love that was expressed, amen,
[1:28:29] that same love just comes and and is
[1:28:32] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:28:34] Ghost. I know this is simple. Amen. But
[1:28:36] that love, amen, he can come and give
[1:28:37] you a fresh baptism this morning. Amen.
[1:28:40] If you're hard, if you're hardened, if
[1:28:42] you if you become weary along the way,
[1:28:44] amen, that things have gotten difficult.
[1:28:46] Amen. There's a fresh baptism of love
[1:28:48] for you this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:51] We get so revelated. Amen. We We think
[1:28:53] we don't need love. We don't need faith
[1:28:54] in this this hour. Amen. Amen. We need
[1:28:57] love. That's the only thing that's going
[1:28:58] to enter that place is perfect love.
[1:29:01] That's the only thing that's going to
[1:29:02] overcome Leodosa and every demon cuz
[1:29:04] they're all coming after you. Amen. But
[1:29:07] it's love. Amen. And love will drive
[1:29:08] back fear. It'll drive back confusion
[1:29:11] and it'll drive back the enemy because
[1:29:13] the enemy don't know what that is. He
[1:29:14] can't stay in the presence of that
[1:29:17] divine love. When the divine love of the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost was shed abroad in your
[1:29:21] hearts the day you were saved,
[1:29:23] sanctified, filled. Amen. Amen. It runs
[1:29:25] Satan out. Amen. It runs Satan out. He
[1:29:28] was bound by a chain of circumstance.
[1:29:30] Then it could no longer work with you
[1:29:32] anymore. Amen. Because love came in.
[1:29:36] Love lifted me. Love lifted me when
[1:29:41] there seemed to be no way. Love lifted
[1:29:44] me.
[1:29:45] I'm just preaching this morning. We'll
[1:29:48] try to hurry
[1:29:51] up. Same God that brought forth water
[1:29:54] out of the rock. The same God will take
[1:29:56] you to the rapture. The same God that
[1:29:58] gives you overcoming victory at every
[1:30:01] turn. Amen. We're not a defeated people.
[1:30:05] Amen. But God has given you the victory.
[1:30:08] Amen.
[1:30:11] Well, we've got to keep that love
[1:30:13] renewed in us. Do you believe that?
[1:30:19] In the first church age, Ephesians
[1:30:22] church
[1:30:23] age, he said, "I have somewhat against
[1:30:25] you because you've left your first
[1:30:29] love." We understand that. Brother Brham
[1:30:32] says here, he said, "What's the matter
[1:30:34] with the tabernacle?" A man ought to be
[1:30:35] able to say when you meet a man is your
[1:30:38] Christian experience when when was it
[1:30:40] dearest to you? He said you ought to be
[1:30:42] able to say right now.
[1:30:45] Well, my best experience was back when I
[1:30:47] first got to baptism the Holy Ghost when
[1:30:49] I come. He said, "Brother, then you've
[1:30:51] fallen from grace." That's right. He
[1:30:53] said, "Thou you've left your first love,
[1:30:54] showing that you had something in the
[1:30:57] beginning and left it." He said, "Not he
[1:30:59] that beginth, but he that endureth to
[1:31:01] the end, the same shall be saved. Not
[1:31:03] the ones that start out, but the ones
[1:31:05] that go on. No matter how hard it gets,
[1:31:08] they keep that love, that spark, that
[1:31:09] flame going. Not all that say, "Lord,
[1:31:12] Lord," but the one that doeth the will
[1:31:14] of my father. He said, "Let me just soak
[1:31:16] in a few minutes." He said, "Anyhow,
[1:31:18] just let us soak." He said, "He that
[1:31:20] doeth the will, not he that endureth,
[1:31:23] but he that endureth to the end." He
[1:31:26] said, "No, if you think about that, I if
[1:31:28] you think that about me, I'll leave
[1:31:30] church." Go on with me now.
[1:31:32] Preach with me now. If you think that
[1:31:35] about me, I'll leave church. I won't I
[1:31:37] won't have no more to do with it. He
[1:31:38] said, "All right, there you are. Shows
[1:31:40] what you're made out, brother. If it was
[1:31:42] a wheat to begin with, it'll be a wheat
[1:31:43] at the end. You just never stayed long
[1:31:45] enough down there or you never made the
[1:31:47] thing right." He said, "Remember from
[1:31:49] when you fall." He said, "Go back and
[1:31:51] remember when you used to have the
[1:31:52] experience where you wouldn't talk about
[1:31:54] nobody." Listen to me. Listen to me.
[1:31:56] Anything went anything went wrong in the
[1:31:58] church. You didn't sit on your
[1:31:59] neighbor's steps over there and talk
[1:32:01] about the church and talk about
[1:32:02] everybody else and fly loose and go join
[1:32:04] another church. You stayed right there
[1:32:06] patiently and prayed it out and God
[1:32:08] brought it on through.
[1:32:10] That's where we got to get to, church.
[1:32:13] If we fallen from that, that's where we
[1:32:15] got to get back to a God that'll bring
[1:32:16] it through. Amen. Not Amen. We ain't We
[1:32:19] ain't got to fly off the handle. Amen.
[1:32:21] But there's a God that'll bring it
[1:32:22] through in this hour.
[1:32:26] Sir, good.
[1:32:30] Love. Expression of love.
[1:32:34] Amen. It's not just in Christ. It wasn't
[1:32:36] just in God. Wasn't just in Christ. But
[1:32:40] it's expression of the eternal Godhead
[1:32:43] and
[1:32:44] power by
[1:32:46] love. Love will conquer
[1:32:49] everything. Love conquers every enemy.
[1:32:56] 1 Peter 4 and7 the end of all things is
[1:32:58] at hand. Peter said be fervent in
[1:33:01] prayer be sober and above all things
[1:33:05] have fervent charity among yourselves
[1:33:06] for charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:33:10] sins. So he says above all have have a
[1:33:13] fervent
[1:33:14] charity above everything keep a love for
[1:33:18] the moving of the spirit above
[1:33:20] everything keep a love for the truth.
[1:33:23] Keep a love for the brethren, for your
[1:33:25] brother and sister. Amen. And it's in
[1:33:27] the hard times that we as the bride of
[1:33:30] Christ can come. Amen. We can come and
[1:33:33] sit together in heavenly places in the
[1:33:36] presence of Jesus Christ. We can come
[1:33:39] and sit here. We can take our position
[1:33:41] in the word. We can take our stand,
[1:33:43] amen, on the word. We can come together
[1:33:46] in worship in spirit and in truth. Amen.
[1:33:48] Amen. And we as the bride, amen, we can
[1:33:50] join together. We can join our licks of
[1:33:52] fire here this this morning. Amen. We
[1:33:55] can join our licks of fire here this
[1:33:57] morning. Amen. That little bit that
[1:33:59] little bit of fire. Amen. Brother said
[1:34:00] it's the size of your thumbnail. Amen.
[1:34:02] That God deposited in you by the Holy
[1:34:04] Ghost. Amen. He pulled it off that
[1:34:06] pillar of fire and by the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:08] Amen. Deposited that little bit in
[1:34:10] there. Amen. We can take our elix of
[1:34:12] fire and join in faith this this
[1:34:14] morning. We can join in faith. Amen.
[1:34:16] Amen. And we can bring amen. The spirit
[1:34:18] of God so upon the scene. Amen. Amen. to
[1:34:20] come under the authority of the word.
[1:34:22] Amen. To join our faith. Amen. For those
[1:34:25] that are battling, for those that are
[1:34:26] struggling, amen. And when we can stand,
[1:34:28] Amen. Amen. And bind the enemy. Amen. He
[1:34:31] said, "Whatsoever you loose on earth,
[1:34:33] I'll loose it in heaven. Whatsoever you
[1:34:35] bind on earth, I'll bind it in heaven."
[1:34:37] The church has that power this morning.
[1:34:46] 1 John
[1:34:47] 4:17, "Here is our love made
[1:34:51] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:34:53] day of judgment, because as he is, so
[1:34:56] are we in this world. There is no fear
[1:34:58] in love, but perfect love casteth out
[1:35:01] fear, because fear hath torment. And he
[1:35:04] that fearth is not made perfect in love.
[1:35:08] We love him because he first loved us."
[1:35:12] So he said here in our love is made
[1:35:14] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:35:16] day of
[1:35:18] judgment and that word judgment there is
[1:35:20] your
[1:35:21] damnation the
[1:35:23] accusation the trial the contest and
[1:35:27] that which was meant to destroy you.
[1:35:29] Amen. That judgment that that no doubt
[1:35:32] would come upon us without without the
[1:35:34] mercy and the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:35] Amen. Amen. Amen. Our love is made
[1:35:38] perfect. Amen. that we have may may have
[1:35:39] boldness to be able to stand and
[1:35:41] withstand these things. We stand by
[1:35:44] love. Amen. A perfect love cast out all
[1:35:48] fear. I'll try to wind it down
[1:35:50] here. 1951 faith is a substance. He
[1:35:54] said, "Now love one another. Above
[1:35:57] everything that you do, love one
[1:35:58] another. And as you love one another,
[1:36:00] you'll love God. You love each other and
[1:36:02] you'll love God. For God is love. And if
[1:36:04] a man walks in love, walks in life,
[1:36:06] perfect love casteth out all fear. He
[1:36:09] said, "Then if you can take him at his
[1:36:10] word and not fear a bit about it,
[1:36:12] say,"Lord, I love you. I know you're
[1:36:14] going to answer because you promised me
[1:36:16] you would. I just know you're going to
[1:36:17] do it." See, it takes all the fear away.
[1:36:20] Amen. He says here, "In the power of the
[1:36:22] devil, I love him and I want you to love
[1:36:25] him and I want you to believe him.
[1:36:29] Perfect love casts out all fear. And if
[1:36:31] you love him with the right kind of
[1:36:32] heart, you won't have one speck of fear
[1:36:34] whether he can keep his word or not. Is
[1:36:37] that the love you have towards him this
[1:36:39] morning? Is that the love you have
[1:36:41] towards, Amen, the things that we've
[1:36:42] heard through the years? Amen. That God
[1:36:44] is able. That God is able to keep his
[1:36:46] word. That God is able to bring me my
[1:36:48] children, to bring me my family, that
[1:36:51] God is able to heal me of this sickness.
[1:36:53] Amen. There's not a shadow of a doubt.
[1:36:55] There should not be a shadow of a doubt.
[1:36:57] Amen. the faith, amen, that we that
[1:36:59] we've gathered together, amen, to sit in
[1:37:01] heavenly places, amen, amen, there ought
[1:37:03] to be an atmosphere this morning, amen,
[1:37:05] that amen, there's there shouldn't be
[1:37:07] one bit of doubt, one bit of confusion
[1:37:09] of what God is able to do in our
[1:37:12] midst. Cut loose this morning. Cut
[1:37:15] loose. Amen. Amen. Don't worry about the
[1:37:18] chicken. Don't worry about the mashed
[1:37:19] potatoes. Amen. Cut loose this morning.
[1:37:21] Amen. Amen. God's here. He's ready to
[1:37:24] give it to you. Amen. Amen. Just speak
[1:37:26] to the rock this morning. Amen. Speak.
[1:37:28] Amen. Put the word on your lips. Amen.
[1:37:31] How many times have I said amen, ladies?
[1:37:36] 192.
[1:37:40] I know somebody's keeping
[1:37:43] [Laughter]
[1:37:45] up. Where we at?
[1:37:48] Are you
[1:37:51] serious? She's not really counting, is
[1:37:53] she?
[1:37:57] Put that thing
[1:37:59] away. Just like your
[1:38:04] mama. Matthew 18. Verily I say unto you,
[1:38:08] whatsoever you bind on earth shall be
[1:38:10] bound in heaven. Whatsoever you loose on
[1:38:13] earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I
[1:38:15] say unto you that if two of you shall
[1:38:17] agree on earth as touching anything they
[1:38:20] shall ask, it shall be done for them of
[1:38:22] my father which is in heaven. Where two
[1:38:24] or three are gathered in my name, there
[1:38:27] I am in the midst. Amen. What can we
[1:38:29] agree upon this morning? What's your
[1:38:32] need? What's your problem?
[1:38:36] We can agree on that he's more than able
[1:38:39] this morning. Is there anything too hard
[1:38:42] for the Lord? That's the question.
[1:38:45] Nothing too hard for him this morning. I
[1:38:48] can't do it within myself, but the
[1:38:50] authority of the word has given us the
[1:38:52] power. Amen. We don't have that
[1:38:54] authority within oursel. Amen. Amen. But
[1:38:57] he gave it to us. We couldn't produce
[1:38:59] it, but he gave it to us. Amen. We are
[1:39:02] gathered in the mighty name of Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ this morning. Not in the name of
[1:39:07] the father, son, and holy ghost. Not in
[1:39:10] titles, but we've been gathered in the
[1:39:12] name of Jesus Christ, the king of kings
[1:39:14] and the lord of lords. We've come to
[1:39:17] give him his due due honor. We've come
[1:39:19] to sanctify the Lord this morning. Not
[1:39:22] as Moses and and got angry and got upset
[1:39:25] and and struck the the rock twice and he
[1:39:27] broke every top and that kept him out of
[1:39:29] the land. Amen. But we've come to obey
[1:39:31] the word in this hour. Amen. We've come
[1:39:33] to sanctify the Lord, to believe the
[1:39:35] Lord. Amen. To not glorify ourselves.
[1:39:37] Amen. But to lift up the name of Jesus
[1:39:40] Christ. Amen. That that at that name
[1:39:43] every demon has to bow. Everyone has to
[1:39:46] confess that he's the King of Kings and
[1:39:47] the Lord of Lords. Amen. There's no
[1:39:49] situation, there's no chain too powerful
[1:39:51] this morning. Amen. For the power of the
[1:39:53] Holy Ghost to break that chain. Amen. If
[1:39:56] you'll accept, Amen. St. John 3:16.
[1:39:58] Amen. Amen. There's a pardon for you
[1:40:00] this morning.
[1:40:03] There's healing for you. There's healing
[1:40:04] in the rock. There's healing in the
[1:40:07] rock. Christ Jesus this morning. If you
[1:40:08] need healing, Amen. He's more than able.
[1:40:11] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:40:16] Brother Ram says here, there's where
[1:40:18] Moses made his sin by striking the rock
[1:40:20] the second time instead of speaking to
[1:40:22] it. He smoked it the first time where to
[1:40:24] speak of the weakness of the blood of
[1:40:25] Jesus that he'd have to sm be smitten
[1:40:28] for each individual. Christ was smitten
[1:40:30] for our healing. We just speak to the
[1:40:32] rock now and that brings forth its
[1:40:34] healing. Speak to him this morning.
[1:40:37] healing of your body, healing of your
[1:40:39] mind, of the past, of whatever you're
[1:40:43] going through, of your soul. Amen. It's
[1:40:45] a healing power. Amen. From the rock
[1:40:48] this morning that they can overflow if
[1:40:50] you'll just speak to them. Not just a
[1:40:52] little bit. There was enough water in
[1:40:54] that rock to water two million people
[1:40:58] and all their cattle. Does it's
[1:41:01] ridiculous. It's
[1:41:03] ridiculous. But that was God's way of
[1:41:05] doing things. Amen. They There was a
[1:41:07] cliff in the rock, Bible says. And there
[1:41:10] was honey. There was honeycomb. There's
[1:41:12] honey in the rock this morning. If
[1:41:14] you're hungry, there's a sweetness of
[1:41:16] the life in the presence of Jesus
[1:41:18] Christ. If you're hardened, amen,
[1:41:20] there's something to sweeten you up this
[1:41:23] morning. I'll try to wind it down
[1:41:31] here. He says the rock was the old
[1:41:33] driest looking place. And yet they where
[1:41:36] they sang through every old little place
[1:41:38] where they ought no water, no water. It
[1:41:41] went to this oasis, no water. Went down
[1:41:43] there, the spring, no water. And then
[1:41:44] God tells them to do something
[1:41:46] ridiculous. Go speak to the dest thing.
[1:41:49] An old rock sitting up there on the
[1:41:51] hill. Go speak to that and it'll bring
[1:41:54] forth water. Amen. There was one that
[1:41:57] died on the hill one day.
[1:42:00] No little
[1:42:01] thing. lifted up as an
[1:42:04] insign that died on the hill one day.
[1:42:07] The rock Christ Jesus sir, simple as it
[1:42:10] is, speak to the rock by faith. When you
[1:42:14] was saved, you had to meet him there at
[1:42:16] that place. If you've got a need, we
[1:42:18] meet him at Calvary because everything
[1:42:20] was paid for at Calvary.
[1:42:23] Amen. He says, "What the church needs
