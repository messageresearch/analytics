[39:57] what else would i have to hope in
[40:01] lord as it just thrilled me tonight as i
[40:03] was walking across this platform earlier
[40:06] i thought what a privilege
[40:08] to be able to come to preach to the
[40:10] bride of christ on a wednesday night
[40:14] lord i don't want to ever take it for
[40:15] granted
[40:17] and i realized lord that i'm
[40:18] insufficient tonight to
[40:20] bring anything that would help the
[40:21] people
[40:22] but all my hope is in you lord
[40:25] long ago i gave up
[40:28] everything that i was and the old man
[40:30] was crucified
[40:31] the heart and i was raised the new
[40:34] newness of life
[40:36] to walk with you so thankful for that
[40:39] lord may i ever walk with you just as
[40:41] you would have me to walk i pray that
[40:43] would be so with each and every one of
[40:45] us lord may we listen to your word may
[40:48] we be led by it lord
[40:50] lord as it goes forth tonight if there's
[40:51] something lord that said that maybe
[40:54] would stir our hearts may we respond to
[40:56] it lord and we say lord i know that's
[40:58] for me
[40:59] amen to the word i pray you'd grant that
[41:02] today
[41:03] lord and i pray that you'd move in a
[41:05] mighty way
[41:06] in jesus name
[41:09] amen
[41:11] amen do you love him this evening i know
[41:14] you do you wouldn't be here on a
[41:15] wednesday night first samuel chapter 16
[41:17] and verse 14
[41:19] i told you i probably wasn't going back
[41:21] to saul but we're going to go back there
[41:23] one more time
[41:24] and this will probably be it i've
[41:26] learned not to say
[41:28] never
[41:30] but to probably to say probably i say
[41:32] that a lot
[41:33] because we don't really know what
[41:35] tomorrow holds and but we do know who
[41:37] holds tomorrow
[41:39] we know our futures are secure
[41:42] because because we don't hold them he
[41:45] holds them amen first samuel 16 14. i
[41:48] want to talk to you
[41:49] tonight about music and atmosphere and
[41:52] kind of spring from the story of saul
[41:55] and david
[41:56] first samuel 16 14. i
[41:59] wanted to ask you to pray with me this
[42:01] weekend my
[42:03] aunt is coming supposed to be here with
[42:05] us
[42:06] in service and she's going to come and
[42:07] spend a couple days with us my mother's
[42:09] sister she's got cancer
[42:12] and it's the second or third time that
[42:14] she's had cancer and she's beat it
[42:16] before and she's had leukemia as well
[42:18] but the prognosis isn't good and so
[42:21] we're just praying that the lord will do
[42:22] something for her
[42:24] and i'm just believing that the lord
[42:26] will do that and so you'd be praying
[42:28] with me if you would as a church and you
[42:30] know people come
[42:31] for a reason they when they get in that
[42:33] condition they come because they believe
[42:35] there's something in them that tells
[42:37] them that there must be healing in the
[42:38] word of god i know that she's a believer
[42:41] as far as as what she knows and so let's
[42:44] be praying for her and and my mother's
[42:46] family in that situation
[42:48] and i believe god will do a miracle
[42:51] doesn't have to do it here he could do
[42:52] it right now tonight
[42:54] and there's other needs i know that you
[42:56] have i think of
[42:57] brother doug sitting tonight probably
[42:59] watching this but the doug and sister
[43:01] jan is for the jt's
[43:03] sister and brother-in-law
[43:05] he's got cancer i believe the lord is
[43:07] going to move for him and as well and he
[43:10] was going to come up and wasn't even
[43:11] able to make the trip to be prayed for
[43:13] but we know god is not limited by that
[43:16] and we were going to go down to see him
[43:17] and it was hindered as well but god
[43:19] knows what he's doing and
[43:21] so we'll just believe for these
[43:23] situations
[43:25] we don't we're not scared of cancer
[43:27] because we've seen god take care of it
[43:29] before yeah
[43:30] but the spirit of the lord first samuel
[43:32] 16 14 but the spirit of the lord
[43:34] departed
[43:35] from saul
[43:37] and an evil spirit from the lord
[43:39] troubled him
[43:41] and saul's servant said unto him behold
[43:44] now
[43:44] an evil spirit from god trouble with
[43:47] thee
[43:48] that's quite a conversation isn't it you
[43:50] know sometimes you just have to bring it
[43:52] up to somebody hey you're a little bit
[43:54] off today
[43:55] behold an evil spirit from the lord
[43:57] troubleth thee
[43:59] and and remember this is after he has
[44:02] been rejected as king and he knows it
[44:05] and the spirit of the lord has left him
[44:08] and so now he the an evil spirit from
[44:10] the lord to come
[44:11] to trouble him and
[44:14] they said let our lord now command thy
[44:16] servants which are before thee to seek
[44:17] out a man
[44:19] who is a cunning player on a harp and it
[44:22] shall come to pass when the evil spirit
[44:24] from god is upon thee
[44:27] he shall play with his hand
[44:29] and thou shalt be well
[44:32] and saul said unto his servants provide
[44:34] me now a man that can play well
[44:37] and bring him to me
[44:39] and then answered one of the servants
[44:40] and said behold i have seen a son of
[44:42] jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning
[44:45] and plain and a mighty valiant man and a
[44:48] man of war and prudent in matters and a
[44:50] comely person
[44:52] and the lord is with him and then i want
[44:53] to skip down to verse 23
[44:56] it says that it came to pass when the
[44:58] evil spirit from god was upon saul
[45:00] that david took a harp and played with
[45:03] his hand
[45:04] so saul was refreshed
[45:07] and was a well
[45:09] and was a well it was like it was a
[45:11] sickness that come upon him when he
[45:13] played he was well and the evil spirit
[45:16] departed
[45:17] from him i pray the lord would add his
[45:19] blessing to the word you may be seated
[45:22] tonight
[45:27] music is fundamental to human existence
[45:30] they say it's universal language
[45:33] and this will kind of go a little bit
[45:35] with what we preached on sunday night if
[45:37] you were here
[45:38] but whenever humans come together for
[45:41] any reason music is there
[45:43] there is no culture without music where
[45:45] people
[45:46] don't sing
[45:48] henry wadsworth longfellow was the one
[45:50] who said music is the universal language
[45:52] of mankind
[45:54] it was martin luther who was restored
[45:56] music as far as congregational singing
[45:59] to the church during the reformation the
[46:02] catholics had made it something that
[46:04] only monks sang or or priest or someone
[46:07] who was paid to do it would sing or
[46:09] would chant they had kind of done away
[46:11] with music as a whole and just had a a
[46:14] gregorian chant that they would do and
[46:17] martin luther brought music back into
[46:19] the church and
[46:20] during that time and of course they
[46:22] thought he was some kind of a sinner for
[46:23] doing that but he said this about music
[46:26] he said next to the word of god the
[46:28] noble art of music is the greatest
[46:30] treasure in the world he said it
[46:32] controls our thoughts minds hearts and
[46:35] spirits
[46:36] he said our dear fathers and prophets
[46:38] did not desire without reason that music
[46:41] be always used in the churches he said
[46:43] that's why we have so many songs and
[46:45] psalms
[46:46] this precious gift has been given to man
[46:48] alone that he might thereby remind
[46:51] himself that god has created man for the
[46:54] express purpose of praising an extolling
[46:57] job
[46:58] extolling god you know
[47:00] i i
[47:01] i've often said it this way and i think
[47:03] it was billy graham that said it first
[47:05] but you know when we get to heaven you
[47:08] all will have a job
[47:09] i won't
[47:11] as far as i know i don't know maybe
[47:13] they'll but there won't be really any
[47:15] need to preach but we'll all sing
[47:17] yeah yeah sure
[47:19] right
[47:20] and so we we may not uh we may not hear
[47:22] a preacher once we get to heaven because
[47:24] we'll have him when we finally get there
[47:27] and and after
[47:29] all these things have happened at the
[47:30] end times we'll be there with with god
[47:33] with christ and yet during that time
[47:35] we'll still sing because that was his
[47:37] purpose and god created music in heaven
[47:40] it's the first thing that god created
[47:42] and the first thing that satan corrupted
[47:45] and i know many times as believers we
[47:47] focus on those negative aspects of music
[47:50] the corruption of music like rock and
[47:52] roll being a great example of that and
[47:55] those negative aspects are very real
[47:57] that's a that's a very real thing music
[48:00] affects you for good or bad
[48:02] it has a profound effect on you
[48:05] if you're feeling a certain way and
[48:07] you're listening to a certain type of
[48:08] music all the time maybe it would be
[48:10] good for you to turn on a different kind
[48:12] of music so that you'd feel differently
[48:15] if you find yourself depressed and
[48:17] you're listening to sad songs all the
[48:19] time you're listening to country and
[48:20] western and stuff like that it'd
[48:22] probably be good if you'd turn on
[48:24] something happy it'd probably be good
[48:26] for you if you'd if you'd play something
[48:28] that was upbeat and and happy because
[48:30] that would have a it has such a powerful
[48:32] influence in your life you can be
[48:34] driving down the road you'll hear a song
[48:36] or something will come back maybe it
[48:37] just happens in your head and it'll come
[48:39] back to you a song you heard years and
[48:41] years before and sometimes even we'll
[48:44] have a situation where i know as a kid
[48:47] we used to sing out of a hymn book and i
[48:49] would i love the old hymns because
[48:51] that's what we sang
[48:52] and we would sing out of the old hymn
[48:54] book and and i may be saying it once or
[48:55] twice in my life i can still remember
[48:58] the words
[48:59] now not if you ask me for them but if i
[49:02] if just just on a random note i might be
[49:05] able to sing the whole song through why
[49:07] because if it's music does something to
[49:09] you just the words by themselves don't
[49:12] do
[49:13] but music has a hugely positive role
[49:16] for christians
[49:18] not just a negative one and i think we
[49:21] sometimes we exalt the negative so much
[49:23] that people begin to think well i just
[49:26] have to be careful what i listen to but
[49:28] people are listening to music
[49:31] right to some kind of music and some
[49:32] listen to rock and roll some listen to
[49:35] uh to country but i prefer to listen to
[49:38] music that's going to bless my soul
[49:40] i prefer to hear music that's going to
[49:42] do something for me and and it would be
[49:44] good if we would even our children would
[49:46] learn to play music and to and to sing
[49:49] even in the home and to sing on the job
[49:52] and it does something for you to be able
[49:54] to do that yes
[49:55] and and whether you can sing or not you
[49:57] can sing somewhere
[50:00] and it does something it does good for
[50:01] you
[50:02] even science has proved there is
[50:04] physical healing in music
[50:06] you know that that congresswoman gabby
[50:08] giffords when she uh when she got shot
[50:11] in the face in the head here not long
[50:13] ago she had a uh she lost her ability to
[50:16] speak and she had to go give a testimony
[50:19] before congress and the way that they
[50:21] taught her to speak was by getting her
[50:23] to sing her testimony and then
[50:26] eventually she could say it
[50:28] but she had to sing it she could sing it
[50:30] before she could say it because you lose
[50:32] whenever you've lost the ability to
[50:34] speak many times you still have the
[50:36] ability to sing
[50:38] and because singing is such an integral
[50:40] part of who you are as a human being and
[50:43] and and that will actually if you can
[50:46] sing it it will actually heal your
[50:48] speech and they've also proved that if
[50:51] if they take someone in for a test of
[50:52] some kind or or some kind of a surgery
[50:55] say even a colonoscopy or something like
[50:58] that if you'll listen to music before
[51:00] that's calming before that happens
[51:02] before you go in and then you go in that
[51:05] that will actually affect the way you do
[51:07] in the surgery
[51:08] it will actually affect that because
[51:11] what it does it lowers your blood
[51:12] pressure lowers your heart rate it makes
[51:14] you more comfortable because music has
[51:17] that much of a powerful effect on people
[51:21] there are it's an essential part to the
[51:23] christian worship service
[51:25] right there's i counted five things and
[51:28] brother harvey's gonna think of
[51:29] something else and tell me later but i
[51:31] counted five things that are essential
[51:33] to the christian worship service prayer
[51:35] is one
[51:37] we we always have prayer
[51:39] we should never forget that to pray one
[51:41] for another when we come together
[51:42] scripture reading yes we always read the
[51:45] scripture but the random always read the
[51:46] scripture
[51:47] always and he would say well you know
[51:49] even if we closed the book and went home
[51:51] now we've heard the word of god
[51:53] right he always had the scripture and
[51:55] then preaching is an essential part of a
[51:57] christian worship service
[52:00] amen it's an essential part we don't
[52:03] that's why we don't even if the spirit
[52:04] takes over we have a wonderful song
[52:06] service we still
[52:07] have time for the word
[52:09] right and some of you if you've been in
[52:10] pentecost you know and back into a
[52:12] wesleyan church they just loved the
[52:14] services when they when they praised god
[52:16] and began to worship worship broke out
[52:17] and they have no time for the word but
[52:20] the word the preaching of the word is an
[52:22] essential part of the service it must be
[52:24] there
[52:24] the offering brother branham taught us
[52:26] was essential to the service
[52:28] an offering that doesn't necessarily
[52:30] mean even when during covenant when we
[52:33] didn't take it up there was still an
[52:34] offering in the service
[52:36] it was still part of your of your gift
[52:38] uh your giving was part
[52:40] of the service but singing is an
[52:42] essential part of the service because it
[52:45] prepares the way for the word
[52:47] and it also waters the word at the end
[52:50] so the bible tells us this speaking of
[52:52] the christian worship service and how we
[52:54] should do colossians 3 16 it says let
[52:57] the word of christ dwell in you richly
[53:00] in all wisdom and he said this is how to
[53:02] do that teaching and admonishing one
[53:04] another in psalms and hymns
[53:07] and spiritual songs singing with grace
[53:09] in your hearts
[53:11] to the lord so it matters the the
[53:13] attitude that you're in when you sing
[53:16] seeing with grace in your hearts
[53:19] to the lord i've heard it said said this
[53:21] way why don't you run that lyric through
[53:23] your brain before you sing it
[53:25] because if you're singing joy
[53:26] unspeakable and full of glory and you've
[53:28] got a frown on your face that's a little
[53:30] bit of a disconnect there
[53:33] right
[53:33] everybody will be happy over there and
[53:36] you're frowning right
[53:38] at some point there's a disconnect there
[53:40] i guess you could say well everybody
[53:41] will be i'm not now
[53:43] but but it ought to make us happy
[53:46] right and so there are three types of
[53:48] songs and we're just laying a background
[53:50] for where i'm going tonight but there's
[53:52] three types of songs that were given
[53:54] there psalms was the first one psalms
[53:57] are scriptural songs
[54:00] that is uh seeing the scripture and that
[54:02] was something that's always been done in
[54:03] the church i'd like to see more of it
[54:05] i'd like to see more of the scripture
[54:07] sung it's one of the good things about
[54:09] the praise and worship music is that
[54:11] sometimes they'll take a scripture
[54:13] especially a psalm and they'll take that
[54:15] and set it to music well that's what
[54:16] david did he wrote it with music and so
[54:19] it was meant to be actually accompanied
[54:22] by an instrument in the original or
[54:25] instruments and sometimes many many
[54:26] instruments
[54:28] so then you would have psalms that's the
[54:29] first one the second one is hymns and
[54:31] that's songs that everyone knows songs
[54:33] that have stood the test of time but in
[54:35] in the scripture it meant congregational
[54:37] singing
[54:38] right so we all knew the words to it so
[54:40] we could sing it together because they
[54:42] didn't have these back then
[54:44] i know we get addicted to these and
[54:46] sometimes we we can't sing unless we got
[54:48] one or if they get the wrong words or
[54:50] the words a little messed up brother
[54:52] robert maybe he gets the wrong song up
[54:54] there every once in a while not often
[54:55] but every once in a while the robert
[54:57] won't hear it just exactly right and
[54:58] he'll get the wrong one up there for
[55:00] just a minute and then he'll change it
[55:02] and everybody kind of stops singing but
[55:03] back then you had to learn it right so a
[55:06] hymn would be a song everybody knows
[55:09] right that's the song everybody knows
[55:11] that's a good one to sing because you
[55:12] can sing it together you're doing it
[55:14] together you're worshiping god together
[55:16] with one voice as we said sunday night
[55:19] blending your voices in harmony in
[55:21] worship to the to the king of kings amen
[55:24] but we want to do that we want to have
[55:25] psalms we want to have hymns and the
[55:27] third one was spiritual songs spiritual
[55:30] songs in the new testament was actually
[55:32] singing in the spirit paul said i'll
[55:34] sing in the spirit and i'll sing in the
[55:35] with the understanding also so in that
[55:37] sense he was talking about spiritual
[55:39] songs singing in tongues
[55:42] they would actually sing boy they were
[55:43] pentecostal weren't they
[55:45] they would actually sing in tongues
[55:47] during that early church and so but so
[55:50] paul said make sure you don't do that
[55:51] all the time
[55:53] right he said you want to sing with the
[55:54] understanding so that people know can
[55:56] sing with you
[55:58] right but there's a time for singing in
[55:59] the spirit it also means new songs
[56:02] written by inspiration
[56:04] and every move of god in history has
[56:06] been accompanied by new songs
[56:09] that come along and bless the people and
[56:11] especially by people within that move of
[56:13] god and i think it's wonderful when
[56:15] somebody in the message of the hour
[56:16] understands the things that we know
[56:18] begin to write songs it's a wonderful
[56:20] thing and you all had a pastor here some
[56:22] time ago with lafontaine and they were
[56:24] songwriters and the children were
[56:26] songwriters brother paul's a songwriter
[56:28] and i love to hear that music because
[56:30] it's written by somebody who knows
[56:32] something about what i believe something
[56:33] that i believe right
[56:35] so it's a move of god whenever there's a
[56:37] move of god it's accompanied by new
[56:39] songs the bible says in psalms 33 3 sing
[56:42] unto him a new song
[56:45] right so this is it's something it's
[56:46] part of it we don't just sing old songs
[56:49] we sing songs because they're good not
[56:51] because they're old
[56:53] right we sing songs because they're good
[56:55] not because they're new
[56:57] right we don't have to see everything
[56:58] that comes out on the radio we don't
[57:00] have to sing everything that that's not
[57:01] on the radio we we can sing
[57:04] what a new song if it's a song that
[57:06] honors god and sets the right kind of
[57:08] atmosphere
[57:10] and so we should judge every song that
[57:12] way every song whether it's southern
[57:14] gospel or contemporary or whatever that
[57:16] it is we should judge every song that
[57:17] way is it rock and roll if it is it
[57:19] don't belong in the church
[57:21] right does it sound like it does it put
[57:23] you in the attitude for going to a club
[57:25] does it put you like sound like a honky
[57:27] tonk it don't belong in the church but
[57:28] if it could be something that's upbeat
[57:30] it could be something that's slow but if
[57:32] it's worshipful to god if it puts you in
[57:34] an attitude of worship that's the kind
[57:36] of music that you want to listen to and
[57:38] see
[57:40] right because otherwise you get yourself
[57:41] in a box well i'll only sing a certain
[57:43] type of music well god likes other
[57:45] things other than bluegrass
[57:50] praise god
[57:54] i actually like bluegrass my daughter
[57:56] does too esther i don't know if she's
[57:57] trying to get on my good side or what
[57:59] but she plays bluegrass at a man i eat
[58:02] that up i love bluegrass
[58:04] huh but god's not necessarily a
[58:06] bluegrass musician
[58:08] we may not have banjos i'm not sure what
[58:10] the harps exactly will be but i you know
[58:13] i don't think it'd necessarily be banjos
[58:14] but there'll be instruments of music
[58:16] david invented new instruments
[58:18] to sing his new songs with
[58:20] he said they ain't got nothing good
[58:22] enough to play these songs so he just
[58:24] made some new ones
[58:26] praise the lord so he said singing him a
[58:29] new song play skillfully
[58:32] oh that's good
[58:34] with a loud noise
[58:37] everybody in the back heard me
[58:41] play skillfully with a loud noise so i
[58:43] can't complain too much about her how
[58:45] loud the musicians play
[58:47] because he said play skillfully with a
[58:50] loud noise and there's something david
[58:52] was a musician he would have understood
[58:53] too that when the musicians play with
[58:55] all their art they play better
[58:58] when he when you play trying to hold it
[59:00] back you don't play as well at least
[59:02] that's always been true for me although
[59:04] i was barely considered a musician psalm
[59:07] 144 9 i will sing a new song unto thee
[59:09] oh god upon a sultry and an instrument
[59:12] of ten strings well i sing praises unto
[59:15] thee i will sing a new song
[59:17] psalms 149 and 1 praise you the lord
[59:21] sing unto the lord a new song in his
[59:23] praise where in the congregation of the
[59:25] saints
[59:26] sing with understanding with other
[59:29] people who know the songs
[59:32] jesus set the pattern of singing
[59:35] before you go into a battle
[59:37] in matthew 26 and 30 when he was about
[59:40] to go and was about to come into the
[59:42] garden of gethsemane about to go through
[59:44] the hardest time that anyone has ever
[59:46] been through
[59:47] the greatest moment any anybody's ever
[59:50] been through he set the pattern it says
[59:52] when they'd sung a hill
[59:54] they went out into the mount of olives
[59:56] they sung what was it for
[59:58] he led him into him because it was it
[1:00:01] was to calm his spirit
[1:00:03] to get him ready to go into a great
[1:00:05] battle brother branham said this you
[1:00:06] know singing gives courage you know that
[1:00:09] don't you the soldiers when they're
[1:00:10] going to battle you know what they do
[1:00:11] they play music and sing and things to
[1:00:14] give them courage and when we're going
[1:00:16] to battle we sing
[1:00:18] and it gives us courage to go on
[1:00:21] oh thank the lord this is a battle when
[1:00:23] the word comes forth there'll always be
[1:00:25] a battle i'm up here fighting sometimes
[1:00:28] it's a real fight especially on a
[1:00:30] wednesday night or a sunday night
[1:00:31] sometimes it's it's just like you're
[1:00:33] sogging through you're fighting
[1:00:34] tiredness and you'll fight as well it's
[1:00:37] not just me fighting you're fighting too
[1:00:39] because you're fighting everything
[1:00:40] you've heard during the week and whether
[1:00:42] your bank account's got money in it or
[1:00:43] not you're fighting your kids and you're
[1:00:45] fighting you you're fighting your
[1:00:47] relatives and you're fighting work and
[1:00:48] everything else but if you just fight
[1:00:50] through that you're fighting a battle so
[1:00:52] to get courage for that we sing
[1:00:55] to get courage to fight devils
[1:00:58] hey man
[1:01:00] now
[1:01:02] so that kind of gives us a little
[1:01:03] background
[1:01:04] if we go back to the story
[1:01:06] saul was sick
[1:01:09] and his sickness was caused
[1:01:12] by
[1:01:13] his separation from god
[1:01:16] it wasn't a physical sickness it was
[1:01:18] depression
[1:01:20] he was depressed
[1:01:22] and many times we are depressed and we
[1:01:26] we feel that we know what that's like
[1:01:29] you don't lose the ability to be
[1:01:31] depressed
[1:01:33] when you become a christian
[1:01:36] but we do have to learn how to deal with
[1:01:38] it
[1:01:39] and how to get rid of it
[1:01:42] so saul was depressed and we're told he
[1:01:44] had an evil spirit from the lord in
[1:01:46] other words god allowed
[1:01:48] an evil spirit to come to him
[1:01:50] because he had left god but he was one
[1:01:54] of gods
[1:01:55] right right saul was one of god's
[1:01:58] he was god's chosen man even though he
[1:02:01] wasn't supposed to be king
[1:02:03] right he he was saved
[1:02:06] in the end
[1:02:07] so because he was god's god didn't leave
[1:02:10] him alone
[1:02:11] but he allowed an evil spirit to come on
[1:02:13] him a depression to come on his body
[1:02:16] come on his mind an evil spirit took his
[1:02:20] he brother adam said whenever uh god's
[1:02:22] spirit leaves the evil spirit will take
[1:02:24] its place but the branham said he
[1:02:26] backslid and went so far away from god
[1:02:28] until the spirit had left him and the
[1:02:30] evil spirit took his place come on saul
[1:02:33] and saul was all moody and in a bad
[1:02:35] humor
[1:02:36] and kicking things around
[1:02:39] oh you've never been like that had your
[1:02:40] brother bill i haven't
[1:02:42] brother bill never
[1:02:44] was waiting on sister karen to agree
[1:02:46] with you but
[1:02:49] she got it right home
[1:02:54] she almost nodded her head yes and she
[1:02:57] don't want to lie in church mr karen
[1:03:00] we've all been there haven't we
[1:03:03] i think brother brown said monday
[1:03:04] morning because that's when it's hardest
[1:03:06] on a preacher
[1:03:07] is on monday morning it's difficult and
[1:03:10] and many times as a worker as well
[1:03:12] you're tired because you've been doing
[1:03:13] whatever you do on the weekend and you
[1:03:15] don't want to go back to work
[1:03:16] saul was all moody and in a bad humor
[1:03:19] kicking things around all out of sorts
[1:03:22] like some people gets on monday morning
[1:03:25] he said so he was out of sorts
[1:03:28] watch all the time
[1:03:30] now you're going to get out of sorts
[1:03:32] sometimes
[1:03:34] but saul got to where he was so out of
[1:03:35] sorts all the time
[1:03:38] that his his people his friends
[1:03:41] his advisors told him saul you got an
[1:03:43] evil spirit from the lord
[1:03:46] right they recognized this was something
[1:03:48] more than just being out of sorts on a
[1:03:50] monday morning he was actually out of
[1:03:52] sorts all the time
[1:03:53] he was just that way he got that way and
[1:03:56] it's wrong yeah
[1:03:59] right it's an evil spirit brother said
[1:04:00] did you know that's the evil spirit
[1:04:03] now watch he said the doctors couldn't
[1:04:04] do him any good they had a lot of
[1:04:06] doctors around there but they couldn't
[1:04:08] help that because it was a spiritual
[1:04:10] condition and so you have to be able to
[1:04:12] rightly divide that many times we try to
[1:04:14] treat a natural condition as if it's a
[1:04:16] spiritual condition and it's not and a
[1:04:18] doctor might be able to help us
[1:04:21] but sometimes we've got a spiritual
[1:04:22] condition and we're trying to treat that
[1:04:24] with medicine and the medicine don't
[1:04:27] help
[1:04:28] right and and it's because it's a
[1:04:30] spiritual condition if you get your life
[1:04:33] where it was supposed to be if you could
[1:04:35] get back in that fellowship with god
[1:04:37] you'd find out maybe this condition
[1:04:38] would go away especially when it comes
[1:04:40] to conditions of the mind and of the
[1:04:43] spirit because that's where satan works
[1:04:45] on us the most now
[1:04:47] the doctors couldn't do him any good
[1:04:48] because it was a spiritual condition so
[1:04:50] one of the men had passed around and
[1:04:52] seen a few places they said well we know
[1:04:54] where there's a divine healer at
[1:04:56] said why who would that be said jesse's
[1:04:59] got a son back out there yeah he's a
[1:05:01] divine healer sure he was he healed by
[1:05:03] music
[1:05:07] he had a divine healing ministry
[1:05:09] he healed by music
[1:05:12] you realize how important the music is
[1:05:16] that we play here in the church
[1:05:18] that we have here in the church because
[1:05:19] it's a ministry it's not just somebody
[1:05:22] to get up and play or a job to do it's a
[1:05:24] ministry
[1:05:26] and this one had a ministry
[1:05:29] he david had a ministry he was a divine
[1:05:31] healer brandon said he had a gift of
[1:05:34] casting out evil spirits
[1:05:37] he said the holy ghost hadn't come in
[1:05:38] those days so he cast him out by music
[1:05:41] now you can cast him out and this day is
[1:05:43] cast out by the preaching of the word
[1:05:45] but yet brother random even allows that
[1:05:47] even for this day he said he cast him
[1:05:49] out by music playing the words of the
[1:05:50] lord he said the lord is my shepherd i
[1:05:52] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[1:05:54] in green pastures he leadeth me besides
[1:05:56] still waters and it disturbed the evil
[1:05:59] spirit so much that they left saul
[1:06:03] and so he brings it on down that's still
[1:06:05] valid for this day as a way of casting
[1:06:07] out evil spirits he said shame on you
[1:06:09] people that don't believe in string
[1:06:11] music
[1:06:13] now he's talking about the music
[1:06:16] and that's an important thing for you to
[1:06:17] understand because people today will
[1:06:18] tell you music is immoral it doesn't
[1:06:20] matter it's only the words that matter
[1:06:22] that's not true
[1:06:24] the music matters
[1:06:26] the music matters
[1:06:29] because the music it's the music itself
[1:06:34] and then you take words the word of god
[1:06:36] and put it with that music
[1:06:38] and you got something
[1:06:40] right the music itself now you can take
[1:06:43] beautiful music
[1:06:45] and put the word of god with it and
[1:06:47] it'll create an atmosphere
[1:06:49] i think of the song
[1:06:52] down from his glory if you know that
[1:06:54] song it's a beautiful song what an
[1:06:56] atmosphere of worship when we sing down
[1:06:58] from his glory together what a what a
[1:07:00] wonderful atmosphere oh now in that is a
[1:07:03] classical song it's actually an italian
[1:07:06] song and i went and got the words of it
[1:07:08] one time in the original it was a love
[1:07:10] song and it wasn't anything bad but it
[1:07:12] was uh it was hilarious actually if you
[1:07:15] go look it up the translation doesn't
[1:07:17] make much sense and this guy's standing
[1:07:19] under somebody's window singing to her
[1:07:22] and and and so it kind of you know it's
[1:07:24] like well i don't i don't know if i like
[1:07:26] that but when you sing it with those
[1:07:27] words
[1:07:29] down from his glory ever living story
[1:07:32] right it's but it you wouldn't put
[1:07:35] you wouldn't put certain music with
[1:07:36] those words
[1:07:38] the music still has to fit
[1:07:40] does that make sense the music is not
[1:07:43] immoral it it does take on the character
[1:07:46] of the words
[1:07:47] but it's not
[1:07:49] in itself it has to fit with the words
[1:07:52] that's why there's certain types of
[1:07:53] music that you would play at even if the
[1:07:56] words were good but there are certain
[1:07:57] types you wouldn't play at certain times
[1:07:59] and it's something we have to learn
[1:08:00] and some of you have learned we've got
[1:08:02] wonderful musicians here at the church
[1:08:04] and they've learned that when there's a
[1:08:05] prayer line when there's somebody up
[1:08:06] here when you're when you're praying up
[1:08:08] here behind the pulpit or whatever they
[1:08:10] play softly and and they play something
[1:08:12] quietly because that kind of music goes
[1:08:14] with that moment
[1:08:16] right but there's a moment i've noticed
[1:08:18] that if you want to get people up from
[1:08:20] the altar and people are done praying
[1:08:21] and but they're just kind of a people if
[1:08:23] you'll change the song to a faster psalm
[1:08:25] people start getting up
[1:08:28] there's a reason for that because
[1:08:30] it it's it's a moving song and sometimes
[1:08:32] you have to sing a song with faith to
[1:08:34] get people to realize that that god's
[1:08:36] let them there at the altar
[1:08:38] sure
[1:08:40] so he said shame on you people that
[1:08:41] don't believe in string music no wonder
[1:08:43] evil spirits never like it
[1:08:46] they have to get away david cast out
[1:08:48] devils by playing on his string
[1:08:51] instrument
[1:08:53] another instance of this is in second
[1:08:54] chronicles 20 21 i've preached on this
[1:08:56] before and you've heard it preached on
[1:08:57] i'm sure that when
[1:08:59] when the king come down i believe it was
[1:09:01] jehoshaphat he come down and
[1:09:03] and there was a prophet that come out
[1:09:04] and spoke amongst the people and then he
[1:09:06] said if you'll believe the prophets that
[1:09:08] you'll prosper and that's the verse
[1:09:10] before this and then he gets the people
[1:09:11] together they're about to go to battle
[1:09:13] against the against the ammonites and
[1:09:15] the moabites it says when he had
[1:09:17] consulted with the people he appointed
[1:09:19] singers unto the lord what an odd thing
[1:09:21] to do it before a battle
[1:09:23] but he appointed singers unto the lord
[1:09:25] that they should praise the beauty of
[1:09:26] holiness as they went out before the
[1:09:28] army and to say praise the lord for his
[1:09:30] mercy endureth forever now that wouldn't
[1:09:32] be a time to play nearer my god to thee
[1:09:37] you're about to go out and and have to
[1:09:39] use a sword that's not a time to play
[1:09:41] near my god do they they're playing
[1:09:43] onward christian soldiers or something
[1:09:46] like that marching right they're playing
[1:09:48] marching music they're playing music
[1:09:50] that'll that'll get you you say well
[1:09:51] it's wrong to stir up people people's
[1:09:53] emotions by music no it's not wrong to
[1:09:56] stir people's emotions by music in fact
[1:09:58] it's necessary
[1:10:00] what's wrong is when people put their
[1:10:02] faith in that right so brother branham
[1:10:04] went against the pentecostal church
[1:10:06] because he said the only time you can
[1:10:07] dance is when the music's playing right
[1:10:09] yeah right and the only time you can
[1:10:11] sing is when the music's going and the
[1:10:12] only time you can have churches when
[1:10:14] there's a lot of music he said that
[1:10:15] shouldn't be the case you should be able
[1:10:17] to dance when you're out there by
[1:10:18] yourself with the lord
[1:10:20] right you should you shouldn't have to
[1:10:22] have the music because it's inside of
[1:10:24] you the music's in here
[1:10:25] but that'll make the music bad in fact
[1:10:27] the music is necessary how many times
[1:10:29] did brother branham call up a musician
[1:10:31] and didn't begin to play only belief
[1:10:35] let me tell you something if you've
[1:10:36] listened to a lot of tapes you know this
[1:10:38] is true
[1:10:39] and i know many of you have some of you
[1:10:40] probably more than i have but i've
[1:10:42] listened to a lot of tapes and if you go
[1:10:44] to the prayer lines you know it makes a
[1:10:46] difference who's on the piano
[1:10:49] how the prayer line goes
[1:10:52] how quickly brother branham can get in
[1:10:53] the atmosphere of the service
[1:10:56] and they would use certain people
[1:10:58] to do that it was quite a job to do it
[1:11:01] because you it took somebody
[1:11:04] who knew how to play in such a way
[1:11:08] that it was playing in the holy ghost
[1:11:10] and it would bring the right kind of an
[1:11:11] atmosphere you watch some of sometimes
[1:11:13] the pianist would be off-key or they'd
[1:11:15] be playing something that wasn't
[1:11:17] appropriate or something it takes
[1:11:18] brother branham a lot longer to get in
[1:11:20] that atmosphere
[1:11:21] than if they come up playing softly and
[1:11:24] playing what he had asked him to play
[1:11:26] it's true go look it up i'm not gonna
[1:11:28] make that up
[1:11:29] you'll have to listen to a lot of tapes
[1:11:30] but you'll find out that's true
[1:11:34] now
[1:11:35] brother branham said this he said i
[1:11:36] remember he was talking about going to
[1:11:38] phoenix he said i remember the first
[1:11:41] time
[1:11:42] in phoenix he said i have a record that
[1:11:43] was made during that meeting he said i
[1:11:46] don't think i finished that verse before
[1:11:47] but it's all right if i go back i'll
[1:11:48] take too long he said when i get kind of
[1:11:51] get feeling a little down how many of
[1:11:53] you kind of get feeling a little down
[1:11:54] sometimes
[1:11:56] you say well i believe i'll go listen to
[1:11:58] brother ben preach well that may make
[1:12:00] you feel worse
[1:12:04] he might
[1:12:06] depend on the sermon right
[1:12:09] you go listen to me preach and i preach
[1:12:11] a real convicting sermon then you just
[1:12:12] oh whoa it's me you know
[1:12:15] you get feeling real down you turn on
[1:12:17] straight as the gate
[1:12:18] and we've heard that certain brother
[1:12:20] branham preached
[1:12:21] straight as the gate
[1:12:23] oh
[1:12:24] get the feeling down turn that on it's
[1:12:25] like man
[1:12:27] lord deliver me yeah
[1:12:29] right you know turn on
[1:12:32] you know there's some they're just so
[1:12:33] somber
[1:12:34] the unwelcome christ
[1:12:36] we preached on pride he preached on the
[1:12:38] meanest man and you talk about the woman
[1:12:40] watching jesus feed wonderful wonderful
[1:12:43] worship but it's not gonna make you feel
[1:12:44] happy
[1:12:46] right it makes you weep
[1:12:48] so there's things that that you would do
[1:12:51] maybe then to if you're getting a little
[1:12:52] down by the wrestler when he got a
[1:12:54] little down he said i go play this
[1:12:56] record
[1:12:58] i go play this record and if you listen
[1:12:59] to the music they've cut a lot of it off
[1:13:01] the tapes but if you can go in here
[1:13:03] brother outlaws choir it was an upbeat
[1:13:06] kind of music it was pentecostal music
[1:13:09] and so he said when we heard these fine
[1:13:11] songs he said i said to brother outlaw
[1:13:13] i'm glad they're being taped he said
[1:13:14] because i like to study that
[1:13:18] as brother branham says i'm in the
[1:13:19] office studying
[1:13:22] he's sitting back there listening to
[1:13:23] brother outlaw's choir yeah
[1:13:26] right well that's something you need to
[1:13:28] study sometimes
[1:13:30] some of us are too spiritual
[1:13:34] well i'm going to get myself in trouble
[1:13:35] tonight
[1:13:37] we're too spiritual sometimes
[1:13:39] sometimes you'd be better off going
[1:13:41] fishing
[1:13:42] than sitting at home worrying about
[1:13:44] everything
[1:13:45] you call it spiritual but if you if you
[1:13:47] read your bible in a worried state of
[1:13:48] mind all you oh you're sitting there
[1:13:50] reading it but your your thoughts are
[1:13:52] are worried and you're you're sinning
[1:13:54] while you're reading it
[1:13:56] you'll be better off going fishing
[1:14:00] now that's just good practical advice
[1:14:02] but you could listen to some music and
[1:14:04] some people music doesn't have the same
[1:14:05] effect on some people as it does on
[1:14:07] others but for most people it has a
[1:14:09] profound effect to listen to music some
[1:14:12] people i know there's times myself when
[1:14:14] i just want quiet
[1:14:15] i just want to think but if you don't
[1:14:17] want to think listen to music if you
[1:14:19] really don't want to think listen to it
[1:14:20] loud
[1:14:24] that's true science has proved that loud
[1:14:26] music makes you not think
[1:14:28] if you want to think that's why if
[1:14:30] you're studying don't turn on loud music
[1:14:32] turn on soft music
[1:14:34] you'll be able to study or maybe even
[1:14:36] sleep
[1:14:37] if you want to do that but he said i'd
[1:14:38] like to study that i like to hear those
[1:14:40] songs and play the tape here in the
[1:14:41] songs when you can sit down he said
[1:14:42] there's nothing like music
[1:14:45] he said you know god heals by music yes
[1:14:48] do you know that god heals by music
[1:14:51] so it's not just me but the job here
[1:14:53] casting out devils
[1:14:55] which is what we do by preaching the
[1:14:56] word
[1:14:58] not just me up here brother joel or
[1:15:00] brother stewart or brother allen casting
[1:15:02] out devils it's not just it's not just
[1:15:04] us up here or whoever's leading the
[1:15:05] singing but it's brother joe on the
[1:15:06] organ or sister carlo on the piano or
[1:15:09] sister mary on the piano or the organ or
[1:15:11] one of the brothers on the drums
[1:15:12] they're casting out devils
[1:15:17] are you with me now that's an important
[1:15:19] job devil casting out
[1:15:21] right
[1:15:22] so before you go cast out devils say a
[1:15:24] word of prayer
[1:15:26] talk to god for a minute get in a spirit
[1:15:29] in the atmosphere of worship because if
[1:15:31] you just walk up here and you've been
[1:15:32] working all day and you just walk up
[1:15:33] here and you just do it you know give
[1:15:35] god a few
[1:15:36] minutes because it's important what you
[1:15:39] do
[1:15:40] are you with me now
[1:15:41] and i'm glad we've got good musicians
[1:15:43] that i believe that do that
[1:15:45] but there's nothing like music god heals
[1:15:48] by music
[1:15:49] god heals by music god heals my love
[1:15:52] yeah
[1:15:54] oh god
[1:15:56] god heals by medicine
[1:15:58] yes sir praise the lord
[1:16:00] i told you i had a lot of troubles with
[1:16:03] my stomach and the doctor gave me
[1:16:05] something and god healed me in two ways
[1:16:06] i believe god healed me
[1:16:08] i've had less trouble talking but i'm
[1:16:10] wearing this thing in my ear so you see
[1:16:12] that that's molded to fit my ear so i
[1:16:14] can hear myself preach and i don't cut
[1:16:15] out as often because i'm not putting
[1:16:17] exerting myself my voice as much because
[1:16:19] my voice is terrible
[1:16:21] and it just i was blessed with that i
[1:16:22] guess
[1:16:23] so i'm wearing like a hearing aid in my
[1:16:25] ear basically so i can hear myself
[1:16:27] preach and then a doctor
[1:16:29] gave me a pill that i take every day and
[1:16:31] i believe there will come a day when i
[1:16:32] won't need it they give me a pill to
[1:16:34] block the acid in my stomach and that
[1:16:36] helps
[1:16:37] it really helps when i eat right too
[1:16:40] praise god
[1:16:41] but sometimes god heals that way
[1:16:44] god heals by prayer
[1:16:46] god has many ways of healing depends on
[1:16:49] what type that you need
[1:16:52] right but we believe we have that we
[1:16:53] serve a god who when the when the
[1:16:55] medicine won't work
[1:16:57] and when the music won't work when
[1:16:59] nothing else will work but we serve a
[1:17:00] god who can still heal cancer who can
[1:17:03] still heal diabetes who can still heal
[1:17:05] the things that the doctor can't do
[1:17:06] nothing with
[1:17:08] we serve a god who still races to death
[1:17:10] you believe that tonight church
[1:17:12] god still does that but some of these
[1:17:13] little things he wants to heal by love
[1:17:15] that's right
[1:17:17] you realize you could heal somebody by
[1:17:19] showing love to him
[1:17:20] you could heal us he said sometimes a
[1:17:22] little love stretched out will just cure
[1:17:24] an old sword
[1:17:26] oh my a little love stretched out will
[1:17:28] just cure an old sore an old place
[1:17:30] that's been a grudge or something it'll
[1:17:32] heal it right over just a little love
[1:17:35] a little care
[1:17:37] sometimes when you feel down
[1:17:39] he said as we call it a street
[1:17:41] expression down in the dumps see just
[1:17:43] put on one of those tapes
[1:17:45] oh praise god he said well he's wanting
[1:17:47] me to listen to his tapes that's not
[1:17:48] what he's saying
[1:17:50] that music
[1:17:53] he's not talking about his own tapes
[1:17:56] he said put on one of those tapes that
[1:17:58] music or a record
[1:18:01] and go to play in it
[1:18:03] the first thing you know you're patting
[1:18:04] your foot or your hand it's all over
[1:18:06] then you're right up and ready to go
[1:18:08] again
[1:18:09] aren't you glad god wants to heal you he
[1:18:11] wants you god don't want you to be
[1:18:12] frowning all the time god don't want you
[1:18:14] brother bran we put that quote up on the
[1:18:16] board god wants you to be happy he wants
[1:18:18] you to live like little children before
[1:18:19] the father
[1:18:20] god didn't intend for us to come all
[1:18:22] depressed to the house of god all the
[1:18:23] time worried about everything that's
[1:18:25] going on i know some of you have been
[1:18:27] through
[1:18:28] been to hell and back in your lives i
[1:18:30] know you've had struggles i know you've
[1:18:32] been through things but i tell you what
[1:18:34] this is a place where you can find joy
[1:18:36] because there's joy in our salvation we
[1:18:38] don't find joy in our life many times
[1:18:40] but there is joy in our salvation we
[1:18:42] don't have to come depressed and down
[1:18:44] and weary all the time we may come that
[1:18:46] way but we can come with we can come to
[1:18:48] a place where we say lord i know you've
[1:18:50] got this i know you'll take care of me i
[1:18:53] know when i heard the music and i i saw
[1:18:55] the smiles on my brother and sister's
[1:18:57] faces and i saw i began to hear the
[1:18:59] preaching of the word something happened
[1:19:01] inside of me and i began to know i'm
[1:19:02] gonna make it
[1:19:04] god heals that way
[1:19:06] the first thing you know you're patting
[1:19:07] your foot in your hand it's all over
[1:19:09] then you're right up and ready to go
[1:19:10] again
[1:19:12] see one of the marks of depression
[1:19:15] is that you lose the desire to sing
[1:19:18] well there's a lot of depressed people
[1:19:19] in church isn't there
[1:19:25] am i right brother allen
[1:19:27] these brothers that lead singing
[1:19:31] a lot of depressed people in church
[1:19:33] but you do you lose the desire if you've
[1:19:35] ever had clinical depression like what
[1:19:37] they serious depression in your life you
[1:19:39] just couldn't shake it very good you
[1:19:41] lose the desire many times to hear
[1:19:42] singing
[1:19:44] you lose the desire to sing
[1:19:46] and to hear singing
[1:19:48] yeah
[1:19:50] brother branham talked about getting so
[1:19:52] old he said i wouldn't enjoy the music
[1:19:53] no more
[1:19:55] get cranky and indifferent
[1:19:57] god help us today
[1:19:59] yes we don't want to end our lives like
[1:20:01] that
[1:20:02] when we get to where we don't want to
[1:20:03] sing we don't want to hear singing
[1:20:04] everything bothers us because we're
[1:20:06] depressed
[1:20:08] david talked about that in psalm 137 and
[1:20:10] 1.
[1:20:11] and
[1:20:12] i believe actually this was
[1:20:14] some of the writers later on because
[1:20:15] it's talking about the the babylon when
[1:20:18] they went down into babylon were taken
[1:20:19] captive
[1:20:21] it says by the rivers of babylon there
[1:20:23] we set down
[1:20:25] a we wept
[1:20:26] when we remembered zion
[1:20:29] we hanged our harps upon the willows
[1:20:32] that's a country song right there
[1:20:36] we hanged our hearts upon the willows
[1:20:39] in the midst thereof
[1:20:41] for they they they that carried us away
[1:20:43] captive
[1:20:44] required of us a song
[1:20:47] and they that wasted us required of us
[1:20:49] mirth
[1:20:50] saying sing us one of the songs of zion
[1:20:52] because the jews were known for their
[1:20:54] singing and their dancing and so they
[1:20:56] said we want you to sing
[1:20:58] he said how shall we sing
[1:21:00] the lord's song
[1:21:02] in a strange land
[1:21:04] oh my god but isaiah speaks of the
[1:21:07] millennium for the jews that'll be a
[1:21:09] great time for them
[1:21:10] when they come back into their land once
[1:21:12] again
[1:21:13] in isaiah 35 10 it says and the ransom
[1:21:15] to the lord shall return
[1:21:17] and come to zion oh my that place where
[1:21:20] when they left there they couldn't sing
[1:21:22] anymore but they'll come to zion with
[1:21:24] songs
[1:21:26] and everlasting joy upon their heads
[1:21:29] they shall obtain joy and gladness and
[1:21:32] sorrow and sign shall flee away why
[1:21:36] they're going to reach a place where
[1:21:37] they're back in the land again
[1:21:39] they know they're in god's perfect will
[1:21:41] again oh god if we only knew listen as
[1:21:44] christians we today we're in the land
[1:21:46] we're not waiting to go into a land
[1:21:48] we're in that spiritual land do you
[1:21:50] believe that tonight church we're in our
[1:21:52] land now the bible says he has raised us
[1:21:54] up together and made us sit together in
[1:21:56] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:21:58] ephesians parallels joshua and that's
[1:22:00] where he placed him in the land paul
[1:22:02] places us in the land
[1:22:04] he said you're there
[1:22:05] so how do we come to zion how do we come
[1:22:07] to the church how do we come to the
[1:22:09] house of god we come with singing
[1:22:11] with everlasting joy upon our heads yes
[1:22:14] he said come into his presence with
[1:22:16] singing come with joy why because that's
[1:22:20] we know we're in the land yes we may be
[1:22:22] hurting yes there may be things going on
[1:22:24] around us but there's joy in the house
[1:22:26] of god because we're in the land
[1:22:28] they can't take us out of the land you
[1:22:31] listen as long as the children of israel
[1:22:32] were there they were blessed they might
[1:22:34] have had a famine they might have had
[1:22:35] trouble they might have had people come
[1:22:37] up against them they might have been
[1:22:38] fighting wars but as long as they were
[1:22:40] in the land they were blessed listen to
[1:22:42] me tonight church as long as you're in
[1:22:44] the land you're in the land not by your
[1:22:45] own will but by the predestination of
[1:22:48] god god put a seed down inside your
[1:22:50] heart and as long as you know that
[1:22:52] you're in the land as long as you have
[1:22:54] that revelation i'm a child of god then
[1:22:56] nothing can take you out of the land
[1:22:58] you may get hurt at work you may get
[1:23:00] hurt at school you may get hurt in the
[1:23:02] church you may get your feelings hurt
[1:23:04] you may get depressed you may get down
[1:23:06] but when you realize you're in the land
[1:23:08] you can sing
[1:23:10] are you with me in our church
[1:23:12] he hath raised us up together listen in
[1:23:14] the new testament when the book was
[1:23:16] opened the saints sung a new song
[1:23:19] worthy of the lamb
[1:23:21] oh my
[1:23:23] but saul lost that
[1:23:26] due to his backslidden condition
[1:23:31] elisha
[1:23:33] the prophet you remember elijah followed
[1:23:35] elijah
[1:23:37] elisha lost
[1:23:40] his ability
[1:23:42] to see visions
[1:23:44] he was a prophet
[1:23:46] but he needed to get in the presence of
[1:23:48] god
[1:23:49] to see visions
[1:23:51] now think about it
[1:23:52] he was still a prophet
[1:23:54] but he couldn't see a vision
[1:23:56] until the atmosphere was right
[1:23:59] i'm a preacher
[1:24:01] but i can't really preach
[1:24:03] until the atmosphere is right
[1:24:08] you're a christian
[1:24:10] but you can't really receive from god
[1:24:13] in the way that you ought to
[1:24:15] until the atmosphere is right
[1:24:17] how many know that today
[1:24:20] the atmosphere has to be right so we're
[1:24:22] talking about music and atmosphere now
[1:24:24] so saul needed a different atmosphere
[1:24:26] elisha needed a different atmosphere so
[1:24:28] what did he do in second kings 3 15. he
[1:24:31] didn't say now okay so now come and read
[1:24:33] me the word read me the torah read me
[1:24:35] the bible he didn't say that
[1:24:37] he said bring me a minstrel
[1:24:40] a music a musician
[1:24:42] a music player
[1:24:44] and it come to pass when the minstrel
[1:24:46] played
[1:24:48] brother branham
[1:24:49] adds a detail in there i really love he
[1:24:51] said he played a long time
[1:24:55] because elijah was in such a bad mood
[1:25:00] sometimes i don't think we give god
[1:25:02] enough time
[1:25:04] to get us out of our bad moods
[1:25:08] he played a long time
[1:25:11] and said he he become and the minstrel
[1:25:14] played and then the hand of the lord
[1:25:16] came upon him brother branham you said
[1:25:18] it's a text maybe a dozen times down
[1:25:20] through his ministry that that verse of
[1:25:22] scripture he said so they got to play in
[1:25:24] the music the tambourine
[1:25:26] he said now listen if you can't be the
[1:25:28] prophet now notice what type of
[1:25:30] music that he's listening to now brother
[1:25:32] branham gives different different songs
[1:25:34] that he may have been listening to and
[1:25:36] we know that it was just some type of
[1:25:38] worshipful music that would be pleasing
[1:25:39] to god we don't know what the minstrel
[1:25:41] played but brother branham gave
[1:25:43] different songs he said meeting in the
[1:25:44] air one place he said near my god to
[1:25:46] thee so he used different songs but look
[1:25:48] how he says it here he said the
[1:25:50] tambourine he said now listen if you
[1:25:52] can't be the prophet you can be one of
[1:25:54] the instruments
[1:25:56] you say well i'm not preaching today so
[1:25:58] i hope the preacher is in the right
[1:25:59] atmosphere so that he can be blessed
[1:26:01] you're the atmosphere creator
[1:26:05] right
[1:26:06] yes you know why it's so hard to keep
[1:26:08] this building cool in the summer
[1:26:11] because of you
[1:26:13] and me
[1:26:15] body heat
[1:26:16] right a bunch of us get together it's
[1:26:18] hard to keep the building cool
[1:26:20] right especially as the units get older
[1:26:23] it's harder it's harder to keep the
[1:26:25] building cool because when we come in
[1:26:27] that's why when we have a meeting we
[1:26:29] have a bunch of people need these these
[1:26:31] chairs will be full and when these
[1:26:32] chairs get full it gets really hot
[1:26:35] because of the people yeah right you're
[1:26:38] creating an atmosphere
[1:26:40] you realize you do that in a spiritual
[1:26:42] realm as well
[1:26:44] whenever you're there it creates an
[1:26:46] atmosphere i'd go as far as to say when
[1:26:48] you're not there it creates an
[1:26:49] atmosphere
[1:26:52] now that's something you can't do you
[1:26:54] see they feel they say well we can just
[1:26:55] do all this at home we'll do our
[1:26:56] religion at home you can't create an
[1:26:58] atmosphere for the preacher at home
[1:27:02] you can receive of the word
[1:27:05] and i'm glad that many of you are
[1:27:06] watching tonight and i'm happy to be
[1:27:08] able to do that but you can't give
[1:27:11] in the way that you would give when you
[1:27:12] were here
[1:27:14] because you're creating an atmosphere
[1:27:16] for me
[1:27:17] while i'm preaching
[1:27:20] right you're creating an atmosphere not
[1:27:22] just for me but for the word
[1:27:24] you're heating things up
[1:27:26] or cooling them down
[1:27:29] i love the way brother ron spencer put
[1:27:30] that not long ago he said we've got ice
[1:27:33] machine preachers
[1:27:34] producing ice cubes all over the
[1:27:36] audience
[1:27:40] because the atmosphere
[1:27:42] the atmosphere up here affects the
[1:27:44] atmosphere out there but it works the
[1:27:45] other way too
[1:27:47] the atmosphere out there affects the
[1:27:49] atmosphere up here
[1:27:51] so we don't want it to be cold in one
[1:27:52] part of the church and hot in another
[1:27:54] part but we want the whole thing to be
[1:27:56] on fire for god amen
[1:27:58] so he said you can't you may not be the
[1:28:00] prophet but you can be one of the
[1:28:02] instruments yes you know that plays the
[1:28:04] music to bring the spirit down on the
[1:28:06] prophet
[1:28:07] he said so they begin to play the
[1:28:08] tambourine and so forth and beat the
[1:28:10] drums
[1:28:12] how would that get him you see
[1:28:15] the the music is a tool
[1:28:17] yeah
[1:28:18] right it's a tool
[1:28:20] and the tool here
[1:28:22] he's gonna the minstrel is gonna use the
[1:28:24] tool to get elisha out of his bad mood
[1:28:28] right
[1:28:29] so he may have to beat some drums
[1:28:32] might have to play a tambourine we don't
[1:28:33] know what he did but whatever he did it
[1:28:35] worked
[1:28:37] right whether it was soft whether it was
[1:28:39] hard but brother branham in this place
[1:28:40] he said he beat the drums
[1:28:42] and played the instruments and all of
[1:28:44] them began to beat and play and had a
[1:28:47] great big old song
[1:28:49] maybe playing up and he goes meeting in
[1:28:52] the air
[1:28:54] meeting in the air oh there's going to
[1:28:57] be a meeting in the air oh i believe
[1:28:58] that don't you does that song make you
[1:29:00] happy
[1:29:01] yeah unless you have a hard time playing
[1:29:03] it i always had a hard time playing it
[1:29:04] right
[1:29:06] that song makes you happy
[1:29:09] now look
[1:29:10] now
[1:29:12] he said a great big old song now if you
[1:29:14] had a if you had a musical number or if
[1:29:16] you've ever been to a play
[1:29:18] a musical you forgive me for getting
[1:29:20] carnal tonight but again i think
[1:29:21] sometimes we think too much up here and
[1:29:24] we don't realize our lives would be
[1:29:26] could be simply affected by little
[1:29:29] simple things that go on could really
[1:29:30] make a major change in our lives
[1:29:33] so now here
[1:29:35] if you've ever been to a musical you
[1:29:36] know that at the end there's a big
[1:29:38] number
[1:29:40] right they get everybody up
[1:29:42] they don't end usually on a sad note
[1:29:46] you end with a big number and the reason
[1:29:48] for that is because you want people to
[1:29:50] leave happy
[1:29:52] right that's why they end the way that
[1:29:54] they do because they want people to
[1:29:56] leave in the right atmosphere
[1:29:58] because if they leave unhappy they'll
[1:30:00] girls say what did i spend my money
[1:30:05] and you want them to go tell somebody
[1:30:06] else
[1:30:07] you want to walk down the street and say
[1:30:09] hey you wouldn't believe how that was
[1:30:10] well you slept through most of it but i
[1:30:12] left happy
[1:30:15] all right so brother brown said that's
[1:30:17] what they did for the prophet they had a
[1:30:18] great big old song
[1:30:21] playing meeting in the air or some song
[1:30:23] like that the prophet began to get in
[1:30:25] the spirit of the first thing you know
[1:30:26] when he got in the spirit things began
[1:30:28] to happen
[1:30:32] you forgive me but if i want to get in
[1:30:35] the spirit and i want my wife to get in
[1:30:37] the spirit i don't play near my god to
[1:30:39] thee
[1:30:40] nothing wrong with that song by the way
[1:30:41] i love that song but i keep mentioning
[1:30:43] it because it's really slow
[1:30:46] if i if i want to get my wife in the
[1:30:48] mood
[1:30:49] to love me
[1:30:52] excuse me for being too carnal tonight
[1:30:53] but it's just the fact i do want my wife
[1:30:55] sometimes to show me affection she wants
[1:30:57] her to me to show her affection we don't
[1:30:58] do this very often but you know what you
[1:31:00] do you you do have a nice candlelight
[1:31:02] dinner and you cook the steak you get
[1:31:03] everything just right and get rid of the
[1:31:05] kids and everything just right what do
[1:31:07] you do you set an atmosphere
[1:31:08] and you play music
[1:31:11] you play music and you don't play church
[1:31:13] music usual well maybe some of you do i
[1:31:15] don't know
[1:31:18] as the deer during weddings that's kinda
[1:31:24] some of you may do that but usually i
[1:31:26] play a love song not some
[1:31:28] crazy song but just something good
[1:31:31] you understand and that gets me in the
[1:31:33] atmosphere
[1:31:36] sometimes i need it more than she does
[1:31:38] it gets us in the atmosphere
[1:31:40] right that's what we're doing in church
[1:31:43] it's not the holy ghost
[1:31:45] that's not the holy ghost
[1:31:47] maybe in some some types of churches
[1:31:50] i almost said something there i'll tell
[1:31:51] you later
[1:31:53] maybe in some types of churches that
[1:31:54] organs the holy ghost maybe in some
[1:31:57] other types of churches the pianos the
[1:31:58] holy ghost or the drums i've known some
[1:32:00] pentecostal churches like that that's
[1:32:01] not the holy ghost
[1:32:02] but it's a tool
[1:32:05] not to bring the holy ghost
[1:32:07] but to get us in the right
[1:32:11] yeah atmosphere the holy ghost is here
[1:32:15] the prophet was already a prophet
[1:32:17] he didn't have to make himself a prophet
[1:32:19] the music wasn't making him a prophet
[1:32:22] it was getting him in the right
[1:32:23] atmosphere to see a vision yes amen he
[1:32:26] said the spirit got on the prophet he
[1:32:28] said they begin to the prophet get begin
[1:32:30] to get in the spirit and the first thing
[1:32:31] you know things begin to happen they
[1:32:32] begin to get to clap in their hands and
[1:32:34] maybe they're having a good time
[1:32:37] in
[1:32:38] church surely not
[1:32:44] i can't stand for people not to have a
[1:32:46] good time in church i have a hard time
[1:32:47] with it and i know some people their
[1:32:49] resting face is
[1:32:51] not good
[1:32:53] have a hard time
[1:32:54] man
[1:32:57] it's like
[1:32:58] how did he he woke up that way but i
[1:33:01] know some people are happy and they just
[1:33:02] don't show it like other people do
[1:33:04] sometimes i look like i'm happy and i'm
[1:33:06] not so that's
[1:33:07] just fair warning
[1:33:09] but they uh you know
[1:33:11] you want people to be in the right
[1:33:13] atmosphere you want people to be happy
[1:33:15] but the random says they begin to have a
[1:33:16] good time there's no reason why we can't
[1:33:18] have a good time in church i won't be
[1:33:19] just a frolic because there's times
[1:33:22] right there's a time in a season when we
[1:33:25] want it to be solid there's a time when
[1:33:27] that sweet presence of the holy spirit
[1:33:29] comes in and we just want to bask in
[1:33:31] that you don't want to break that up
[1:33:33] i used to have a piano player not here
[1:33:35] i'm not getting after any of our piano
[1:33:36] players but i used to have a piano
[1:33:38] player a long time ago many moons to go
[1:33:40] on a galaxy far away
[1:33:42] i had i had a piano player who would
[1:33:45] always break into the prayer at the end
[1:33:47] we'd get real solid and you'd be having
[1:33:48] an altar call and she'd just start
[1:33:49] playing
[1:33:51] go down the thing and just play loud and
[1:33:53] hard and
[1:33:54] man
[1:33:57] i just i got to where i dreaded it
[1:34:00] because i said sister now play softly
[1:34:03] you know because what will happen is
[1:34:05] what will happen is it will it will make
[1:34:08] it'll set the wrong atmosphere
[1:34:11] a wrong atmosphere for the service and
[1:34:13] people start being happy but you want
[1:34:15] them to think
[1:34:16] you want them to be introspective but
[1:34:18] you don't want to stay that way godly
[1:34:19] sorrow works repentance not to be
[1:34:21] repented of go look it up it's in the
[1:34:23] bible
[1:34:24] god at least sorrow works for penis not
[1:34:26] to be repented of you don't stay there
[1:34:27] the sorrow of this world works death
[1:34:30] you don't stay in that condition but you
[1:34:32] want to get up to where you're able to
[1:34:34] be happy in christ that's the position
[1:34:35] you want to stay in
[1:34:38] right now
[1:34:39] but there's a time and a place for
[1:34:40] everything now he said they began to
[1:34:42] have a good time and the spirit of god
[1:34:43] began to fall in the prophet the spirit
[1:34:45] god on the prophet he began to see
[1:34:46] things he said you'll go to seeing
[1:34:48] things when you get in the spirit
[1:34:50] he said i was talking to a man not home
[1:34:51] ago that didn't believe in music in the
[1:34:52] church he was holding a fuss with me
[1:34:53] about it he said oh the music belongs to
[1:34:55] the world i said the spirit of god
[1:34:57] didn't come on that stood up prophet
[1:34:59] until he got the minstrel out began to
[1:35:01] play a good old-fashioned holy ghost
[1:35:02] song and the spirit of god come down on
[1:35:04] the prophet that's right god doesn't
[1:35:06] change if god liked music in that day
[1:35:08] god likes music today
[1:35:10] he said i tell you brother when we get
[1:35:11] all the formal shackles shook down and
[1:35:14] the spirit of god in the songs again get
[1:35:16] back to an old place where we can have
[1:35:17] the spirit of god moving in the place
[1:35:19] then the prophet can see a vision then
[1:35:21] the powers of god comes in the church
[1:35:24] he said then they can see divine healing
[1:35:26] then they can see the resurrection of
[1:35:27] christ how many want to see that
[1:35:29] well we can do that by getting in the
[1:35:31] right atmosphere for it
[1:35:33] preparing our hearts for the word amen
[1:35:35] he said then the prophet can see a
[1:35:36] vision the powers of god comes on the
[1:35:38] church you can see divine healing you
[1:35:39] see the resurrection of christ they can
[1:35:41] see us the same yesterday today and
[1:35:42] forever well you say brother branham i'm
[1:35:44] not the prophet well if you ain't the
[1:35:45] prophet you can be one of the
[1:35:46] instruments anyhow just keep playing yes
[1:35:49] that's right you ain't got no more than
[1:35:51] them ten just give vent to them just as
[1:35:53] hard as you can if it's a clapping song
[1:35:56] clap
[1:36:00] i'm not yelling at you but it's if it's
[1:36:02] a clapping song it won't hurt you well
[1:36:04] maybe it will if you've got some
[1:36:05] condition where it does i'll excuse you
[1:36:07] you are excused but if you don't have
[1:36:09] some condition that would hurt you to
[1:36:10] clap clap
[1:36:13] what are you doing you're not sitting
[1:36:15] there saying make me happy preacher make
[1:36:16] me a happy singer no you're getting in
[1:36:18] the spirit of it yourself
[1:36:20] you're adding something to the service
[1:36:22] yes you ain't got no more than them 10
[1:36:24] just give it to them as hard as you can
[1:36:26] if you can't be the prophet be part and
[1:36:28] by the way that works the other way too
[1:36:29] if it's not a clapping song don't clap
[1:36:33] if you can't be the prophet be part of
[1:36:35] the minstrels
[1:36:36] do something to bring the spirit of the
[1:36:38] lord down how we can commit to that i'm
[1:36:41] gonna bring do something we got serious
[1:36:43] cases we got people that need god we got
[1:36:45] kids that need god we've got people
[1:36:47] around here need god we need to fill up
[1:36:49] this church with sinners that need to be
[1:36:51] seeking god how are we going to do that
[1:36:53] by getting the atmosphere right
[1:36:55] not just the atmosphere in the church
[1:36:57] but the atmosphere in our homes the
[1:36:59] atmosphere in our vehicles the
[1:37:00] atmosphere on the job
[1:37:03] amen and when the problem he said the
[1:37:05] prophet couldn't do it himself
[1:37:07] he couldn't do it himself he had to have
[1:37:09] the minstrel to help him
[1:37:11] amen he said when the prophet and the
[1:37:14] people got in harmony with god that's
[1:37:16] what we talked about sunday night when
[1:37:17] the prophet and the people got in
[1:37:19] harmony with god the prophet began to
[1:37:20] see things
[1:37:22] and they went out he said they got all
[1:37:24] the music i'm reading from different
[1:37:25] places where brother branham talked
[1:37:27] about this just pulling a few quotes
[1:37:29] many many quotes he said they got to
[1:37:31] play in the music some real good hymn
[1:37:32] the first thing you know when they when
[1:37:34] they songs return to zion when the music
[1:37:37] and the children begin to sing from
[1:37:38] their heart
[1:37:40] something takes place
[1:37:42] it's not a concert you're singing from
[1:37:44] your heart
[1:37:45] the spirit of the lord came on the
[1:37:47] prophet
[1:37:48] and if a real old-fashioned godly
[1:37:50] singing and repenting would bring the
[1:37:52] spirit of god on the prophet then
[1:37:55] it'll do the same thing today
[1:37:57] oh hallelujah he said and notice he
[1:38:00] wanted to see the way out
[1:38:02] and the only way out that they could do
[1:38:04] would be to have a revival
[1:38:05] maybe you're caught up in something
[1:38:07] tonight you won't you can't see the way
[1:38:08] out maybe
[1:38:09] this generational thing has come down on
[1:38:12] you this family curse and you can't seem
[1:38:14] to get over it you keep making the same
[1:38:15] mistakes over and over again maybe the
[1:38:17] way to get out of it you can't see a way
[1:38:20] out have a revival
[1:38:21] you say well you're not having a revival
[1:38:23] you don't have anything scheduled well
[1:38:24] we do have a meeting scheduled but don't
[1:38:26] wait for the meeting you have a revival
[1:38:28] brother said when they bring a a special
[1:38:31] speaker and he said that's not the
[1:38:32] revival for you the revival for you is
[1:38:34] when you're washing the dishes and and
[1:38:36] you're standing there weeping because of
[1:38:37] the the blessings of god and you're
[1:38:39] rejoicing and worshiping god that's the
[1:38:41] revival for you and you bring that kind
[1:38:43] of revival to the house of god we'll
[1:38:45] have church
[1:38:47] yes
[1:38:48] sir he had a revival so he had some
[1:38:50] repentant sinners come in and the music
[1:38:51] played and the prophet saw a vision the
[1:38:53] only way you're ever going to see your
[1:38:55] way out
[1:38:56] is an old-fashioned spiritual revival oh
[1:38:58] lord give me a revival yes where the
[1:39:01] hallelujahs of god is ringing from the
[1:39:02] bottom of your heart in an old-fashioned
[1:39:05] holy ghost scent revival hits the place
[1:39:07] then you begin to see things then god
[1:39:09] will begin to reveal things yes
[1:39:13] now what is music again it's a tool
[1:39:16] and it affects your emotions that's what
[1:39:18] it's supposed to do
[1:39:20] all right i remember years ago brother
[1:39:22] ron spencer again i'm on why i'm
[1:39:23] thinking of him tonight but
[1:39:25] ron i heard him say years ago he said he
[1:39:27] said brother ron i'm afraid i'll get in
[1:39:28] the flesh he said what else are you
[1:39:29] going to get in
[1:39:32] you're not raptured yet
[1:39:40] see it's emotions god uses that yeah
[1:39:42] that's not where we put our faith
[1:39:45] we don't put our faith in how we feel
[1:39:47] right or how loud the service was
[1:39:50] or how well the people played the piano
[1:39:52] or the organ or the how well the
[1:39:54] preacher preached thank god
[1:39:57] we don't put our faith in the in the
[1:39:58] goodness of the preacher or the
[1:40:00] eloquence of the preacher we put our
[1:40:02] faith in god
[1:40:04] our faith is in an unchanging god and
[1:40:06] god is his word we put our faith in the
[1:40:09] word emotions don't last
[1:40:12] neither does a bath but you like to take
[1:40:13] one now and then
[1:40:17] right
[1:40:19] i don't last but i like to feel it now
[1:40:21] and then
[1:40:22] i'll tell you what if you could ever get
[1:40:23] inside the holy of holies you know the
[1:40:25] difference in the outside of the holy of
[1:40:26] holies is on the inside and the holy
[1:40:28] holy they had that all the time
[1:40:30] right and i do believe a christian has
[1:40:31] it all the time in here sometimes we
[1:40:33] just have to let it out and part of
[1:40:36] getting in revival is just getting out
[1:40:39] of the way and letting the holy spirit
[1:40:41] sometimes we need music to do that yeah
[1:40:43] just to get us out of the way sometimes
[1:40:45] we need to we need love to do that just
[1:40:47] to get ourselves out we need to we need
[1:40:49] some positivity to do that because you
[1:40:51] say well i'm a christian i can take it
[1:40:53] no sometimes you need some positivity
[1:40:57] to get out of that to where you can get
[1:40:58] past your flesh brother branham said if
[1:41:00] you could see listen to me i'm talking
[1:41:02] about a real god tonight
[1:41:04] if you could see he said pass the veil
[1:41:07] of your flesh
[1:41:08] he said you'd see angels at their
[1:41:10] position on every pew yes
[1:41:14] they're there
[1:41:17] they are there they are not
[1:41:19] waiting on something to happen they're
[1:41:21] there if you could get past what passed
[1:41:23] the veil of flesh you'd see like hazel
[1:41:26] they said lord open his eyes and he saw
[1:41:28] there were chariots of fire
[1:41:30] a horseman of fire right
[1:41:33] amen
[1:41:34] but emotions don't last
[1:41:36] and that's why saul david would have to
[1:41:37] come back yeah
[1:41:39] and play
[1:41:41] come back and play appreciate those
[1:41:43] amens back there
[1:41:46] david come back and play
[1:41:48] he kept having to come back
[1:41:50] and it came to pass first samuel 18 6.
[1:41:53] now watch he got to feeling pretty good
[1:41:55] david was helping him david become like
[1:41:57] the associate pastor he was his armor
[1:41:59] bearer that's a warrior that's a king's
[1:42:01] associate pastor it says armor bearer
[1:42:04] and it came to pass to say came when
[1:42:06] david was returned from the slaughter of
[1:42:08] the philistine
[1:42:09] that the women now watch he's gone out
[1:42:11] there and killed goliath
[1:42:14] what a wonderful time what a joy the
[1:42:17] women came out of all the cities of
[1:42:18] israel singing and dancing to meet king
[1:42:22] saul
[1:42:23] with tabarets with joy
[1:42:25] and with instruments of music
[1:42:29] what a wonderful service you'd have
[1:42:30] thought this would have put saul in a
[1:42:32] good mood
[1:42:34] but his problem was deeper yes sir
[1:42:38] and the women answered one another now
[1:42:41] he may have been in a good mood at first
[1:42:42] till he got to hearing what they were
[1:42:43] saying
[1:42:46] and the women answered one another as
[1:42:48] they played and said
[1:42:50] saul preaches some pretty good sermons
[1:42:53] oh saul he's pretty good
[1:42:56] but that little david
[1:43:03] every once in a while have somebody tell
[1:43:04] me i know you don't mean it wrong he
[1:43:06] said man brother joel did a good job man
[1:43:07] brother allen did a good job and i
[1:43:09] preached that morning and i'm like well
[1:43:12] [Laughter]
[1:43:16] i know you don't mean bad these brothers
[1:43:19] can wait out preach me i just we can't
[1:43:21] really let that on okay don't tell
[1:43:22] nobody
[1:43:26] but they come out and they begin to say
[1:43:29] it's all saints thousands
[1:43:31] he's a good preacher
[1:43:33] but david is ten thousands
[1:43:35] it's a
[1:43:36] masterpiece and saul got angry bible
[1:43:39] said he was very rough
[1:43:41] and the saying displeased him
[1:43:44] and he said they have ascribed unto
[1:43:45] david ten thousands media described by
[1:43:47] thousands and here comes that
[1:43:49] generational curse
[1:43:51] here comes that family curse
[1:43:55] he was little in his own side he never
[1:43:56] got over the insecurity
[1:44:00] he says
[1:44:01] what can he have more but the kingdom
[1:44:04] david would have never done it
[1:44:07] he proved that because he could have
[1:44:09] killed him and taken the kingdom and he
[1:44:10] wouldn't do it
[1:44:12] proved on multiple occasions he would
[1:44:14] have never done it but saul got it in
[1:44:15] his mind yeah sure because it's just the
[1:44:17] way he was raised and the way he was
[1:44:19] born you understand he was a man of god
[1:44:22] but he just couldn't get past that
[1:44:26] and verse 9 says in saul i'd david from
[1:44:28] that day forward
[1:44:33] verse 10 it came to pass on tomorrow
[1:44:34] that the evil spirit
[1:44:36] from god came upon saul here it comes
[1:44:38] again
[1:44:39] no this is strange
[1:44:42] the evil spirit came down and he
[1:44:44] prophesied
[1:44:46] he preached
[1:44:51] remember i told you there's a couple
[1:44:52] things you never want to do angry one of
[1:44:53] them was preach
[1:44:55] i think the other one i said was never
[1:44:56] don't spank your kids
[1:44:58] or talk to your wife
[1:45:00] when you're angry
[1:45:04] don't correct your wife make your kids
[1:45:07] or preach a sermon
[1:45:09] in anger
[1:45:12] he prophesied
[1:45:14] in the midst of the house he was
[1:45:15] preaching he come out to preach his
[1:45:17] sermon there was a javelin in his hand
[1:45:23] he gets to the point
[1:45:25] he gets so stirred up in his preaching
[1:45:27] he thinks it's the lord
[1:45:31] think about it
[1:45:33] he prophesied
[1:45:34] he thought it was god
[1:45:36] it was an evil spirit from god
[1:45:39] god allowed to come on him he thought it
[1:45:41] was god and it was the complex speaking
[1:45:43] he thought it was god and it was the
[1:45:45] depression speech
[1:45:48] we better be careful
[1:45:49] what we ascribe to god oh but i got this
[1:45:51] revelation but you put it on god and
[1:45:54] what did it make you do
[1:45:56] how did it make you
[1:45:59] he took the javelin
[1:46:01] he said i will smite david even to the
[1:46:03] wall with it i'll pin him down he'll
[1:46:05] never get out
[1:46:07] yeah and david avoided out of his
[1:46:09] presence
[1:46:10] twice
[1:46:12] two different services david had to run
[1:46:14] for his life
[1:46:16] because saul took up the javelin and
[1:46:18] threw it at him
[1:46:20] oh my why didn't the music work this
[1:46:22] time
[1:46:23] see he wasn't you know what time it is
[1:46:25] i'm sorry i'm it's time to close
[1:46:28] he's he wasn't just depressed this time
[1:46:31] but he was also jealous
[1:46:34] right that needed there was a different
[1:46:36] cure yeah
[1:46:37] he needed to do some repenting
[1:46:40] i wasn't able to do it
[1:46:41] the spirit that had troubled him now
[1:46:43] possessed him
[1:46:45] listen to me as we close
[1:46:47] musicians can go ahead and come
[1:46:49] i'm going to skip over some of this
[1:46:52] you can use music or counseling if i
[1:46:54] read that clock right it's time to close
[1:46:57] you can use music or counseling or
[1:46:59] anything else to help
[1:47:00] if you struggle with depression if you
[1:47:02] struggle with anxiety but if you don't
[1:47:04] ever deal with your backslidden heart if
[1:47:06] it's an evil spirit from the lord it may
[1:47:08] not be
[1:47:09] but if it is
[1:47:11] it won't last
[1:47:14] see god wants to use music to get you in
[1:47:16] a condition to believe the word brother
[1:47:19] said it's the attitude of the people
[1:47:20] that brings the results he said that's
[1:47:21] the reason that pentecost they had to go
[1:47:23] to an upper room and pray until the holy
[1:47:24] ghost came because they got in one place
[1:47:26] and one accord
[1:47:27] he said it's the atmosphere that brings
[1:47:29] the results do you believe that you
[1:47:31] believe that tonight
[1:47:32] he said let every man and woman in this
[1:47:34] building this morning boy or girl get
[1:47:36] everything from their minds but the lord
[1:47:38] jesus and believe that he's standing
[1:47:40] present right now and you'll see
[1:47:42] something happening that'll cause
[1:47:44] headlines in the newspaper in the
[1:47:45] morning he said that's right it's
[1:47:47] atmosphere
[1:47:48] right and it's the atmosphere that
[1:47:50] brings the miraculous yes and wonders
[1:47:52] and powers of god among the people it's
[1:47:54] the atmosphere of what of the people
[1:47:59] and when people get to a place they're
[1:48:01] reasoning and wandering and stewing and
[1:48:04] thinking
[1:48:06] realize what sometimes god uses a
[1:48:07] preacher to get loud and get in your
[1:48:09] face
[1:48:10] he wants you to stop thinking
[1:48:13] start receiving
[1:48:16] i hope you hear me today you're thinking
[1:48:18] about what's going on you're thinking
[1:48:19] about something i said you're thinking
[1:48:21] about something that i said earlier
[1:48:23] maybe then and it bothered you and
[1:48:24] you're still thinking about that but
[1:48:26] sometimes you've got to
[1:48:28] the spirit will move me to change my
[1:48:30] voice and and speak directly to you
[1:48:33] because when you're reasoning and
[1:48:34] wondering and stewing and thinking and
[1:48:36] all tore up and don't know where you
[1:48:38] stand he said half of them not even
[1:48:39] scripturally taught how can you expect
[1:48:41] the atmosphere to be right you can't do
[1:48:43] it it won't be right it's got to be in
[1:48:45] one accord one place and settle down
[1:48:47] with one motive one thing then you're
[1:48:48] going to see something happen he said
[1:48:50] put the right kind of a music on the
[1:48:51] piano the organ
[1:48:54] and everybody in the atmosphere that
[1:48:55] jesus christ is there that's the
[1:48:57] atmosphere we want it's an atmosphere of
[1:48:59] faith
[1:49:01] he said i'm going to meet everything
[1:49:02] that happened though something will go
[1:49:03] to taking place
[1:49:05] he said but that's the hardest thing
[1:49:06] there is to do that is to get people in
[1:49:08] the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere
[1:49:11] of believing
[1:49:12] he said any person that ever come into
[1:49:14] that atmosphere one time will never be
[1:49:16] satisfied nowhere else yes sir can you
[1:49:19] say amen to that tonight any person that
[1:49:21] ever come oh i appreciate good services
[1:49:23] and i'm glad we have a good atmosphere
[1:49:26] here but oh i long for the time when we
[1:49:28] just get lost in the spirit we've had a
[1:49:30] few services like that and i don't mean
[1:49:32] just get dancing and running but just a
[1:49:34] time when it feels like the spirit of
[1:49:36] god is so strong that you're just lost
[1:49:38] in it the preacher can't preach too long
[1:49:40] it don't matter what's going on around
[1:49:42] you because you're lost in that
[1:49:43] atmosphere there's something just going
[1:49:45] on it's happening all around you he said
[1:49:48] that's why i believe that we should have
[1:49:49] our churches under control by the holy
[1:49:52] ghost not by some denomination somewhere
[1:49:54] not by some message preacher somewhere
[1:49:56] trying to control another church but
[1:49:58] that's why i believe we should have our
[1:49:59] churches under control by the holy ghost
[1:50:01] that men and women in their work and
[1:50:03] wherever they should be should
[1:50:04] continually desire
[1:50:07] and they will if they've ever once come
[1:50:10] into that atmosphere
[1:50:13] hallelujah
[1:50:14] amen would you bow your heads with me
[1:50:17] amen
[1:50:18] if you play something
[1:50:20] do you believe
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] if you believe
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:30] what do you believe
[1:50:32] do you believe he's here
[1:50:35] what'd i tell you sunday he didn't say i
[1:50:37] will be in their midst he said i am
[1:50:39] in the midst thereof
[1:50:42] there i am
[1:50:44] oh god
[1:50:46] that means he's here tonight
[1:50:49] if the atmosphere is right and i believe
[1:50:51] it is
[1:50:52] all things
[1:50:54] are possible
[1:50:57] but it's wednesday night i don't limit
[1:50:59] god
[1:51:01] oh it's just another service just be our
[1:51:03] pastor don't limit god unless you let it
[1:51:07] have a need tonight
[1:51:10] if you struggle maybe with a
[1:51:12] spirit of depression maybe it don't come
[1:51:13] from the lord but he does allow all
[1:51:15] these things to come on us but maybe
[1:51:17] it's not something that we've done maybe
[1:51:19] it's just we struggle with that maybe
[1:51:20] it's in our friends and our family
[1:51:23] we just struggle with that
[1:51:24] why don't you get in the atmosphere of
[1:51:26] worship one time
[1:51:28] that thing will begin to fall
[1:51:30] that worry will begin to fall when you
[1:51:32] begin to worship an omnipotent god how
[1:51:34] could you worry about what you wear what
[1:51:36] you'll eat
[1:51:37] when you begin to get in an atmosphere
[1:51:40] that that you begin to believe
[1:51:44] they say that when brother branham was
[1:51:45] on the field when you walked under the
[1:51:47] tent i remember a pentecostal man
[1:51:49] assembly of god man it was in those
[1:51:50] meetings found out we believed in a
[1:51:52] prophet and he come and he told us he
[1:51:53] said i was there he said and i remember
[1:51:56] he said when people it was different
[1:51:57] under brother browner's tent all the
[1:51:59] other pentecostals had their their show
[1:52:01] and their things that they would do he
[1:52:02] said but when you walked under brother
[1:52:04] branham's tent you would just begin to
[1:52:05] weep he said and people were healed just
[1:52:08] by walking under the tent
[1:52:10] because the atmosphere was right
[1:52:12] oh god
[1:52:14] oh god that didn't that atmosphere
[1:52:16] didn't leave the earth when brother
[1:52:17] branham died it's still here he's still
[1:52:20] brooding the holy ghost the holy spirit
[1:52:22] is still brooding over the church
[1:52:25] wanting to bring things right wanting to
[1:52:27] to bring out the flowers wanting to
[1:52:30] bring the seeds that have been planted
[1:52:31] the word has been planted in your life
[1:52:33] to fruition let him do it tonight let
[1:52:35] him brood over you not just tonight but
[1:52:37] as we leave here tomorrow the next day
[1:52:39] at work he said anybody who's ever been
[1:52:41] in that atmosphere always wants to get
[1:52:43] back in it may that be us this week
[1:52:46] we'll come sunday morning and say i'm
[1:52:48] ready i'm ready to come and be in an
