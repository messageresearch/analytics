[45:07] after the meetings we got sick just
[45:09] like like some of y'all did with with
[45:11] covet and and then we went into vacation
[45:14] and it just seems like it's been a while
[45:15] since we've been here but we're happy to
[45:17] be back in the house of the lord amen
[45:20] amen we weren't just laying out we
[45:24] amen
[45:25] amen
[45:26] certainly the the meetings still have an
[45:29] effect on us you know and just certainly
[45:31] feeling the effect of that still and and
[45:33] when we just love the lord amen
[45:36] amen we'll turn into scripture
[45:38] i just want to speak speak on a subject
[45:40] from that time
[45:42] in matthew 4 and 12 we'll start reading
[45:45] there
[45:47] it says now when jesus had heard that
[45:49] john was cast into prison he departed
[45:52] into galilee
[45:54] and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt
[45:56] in capernaum which is upon the seacoast
[45:59] and the borders of zebulun and nephilim
[46:02] that it might be fulfilled which was
[46:03] spoken by isaiah the prophet saying
[46:06] the land of zebulun in the land of
[46:08] nephilim by the way of the sea
[46:11] beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles
[46:14] the people which sat in darkness saw a
[46:17] great light and to them which sat in the
[46:19] region and shadow of death light
[46:22] is sprung up and from that time
[46:26] began jesus began to preach and to say
[46:28] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[46:31] hand you can be seated and made the lord
[46:33] bless his word
[46:36] amen
[46:38] and just uh
[46:39] just a thought that we had just a few
[46:41] weeks ago even while we were ministering
[46:43] about having an experience and how
[46:46] important it is to to have an experience
[46:49] with god
[46:50] and we must have a
[46:52] we must have an experience but we must
[46:55] have a a word experience a true word
[46:58] experience and to be able to go from
[47:01] that experience and to say from that
[47:03] from that time
[47:05] i was changed
[47:07] i was made different i mean i've been
[47:09] made whole something happened to me
[47:12] right and to be able to go forth and and
[47:15] have the life of christ and and live
[47:17] that life
[47:18] and do the works of christ because jesus
[47:21] said the works that i do shall you do
[47:23] also right so the church has got to
[47:25] continue on it if that life is in us
[47:28] amen we're going to live that life we're
[47:29] going to live a life of the word and his
[47:31] works his that same ministry is going to
[47:34] continue on
[47:35] through his body through the church
[47:39] and we'll just pick up something that
[47:40] brother branham said here and from a
[47:42] sermon and from that time and this is
[47:44] where i got
[47:45] some of the inspiration for this but he
[47:47] says here
[47:49] he says
[47:52] hang on one second here
[47:57] one second here
[48:00] i think i hit a copy and paste there
[48:04] and so we're good now we're good to go
[48:06] okay
[48:09] he said you know as a human being
[48:11] we all think of things from a certain
[48:13] time such and such a thing taking place
[48:16] and from that time and now many times
[48:18] you you meet an old man or an old woman
[48:20] and they like to refer back to a time
[48:22] that something taken place
[48:25] and that they can distinctively mark it
[48:27] out and say it was at that time
[48:29] and he said now i suppose there's
[48:31] practically all of us here tonight could
[48:32] call to remember remembrance of certain
[48:36] things has taken place at a certain time
[48:39] and from that time something changed
[48:42] such and such thing it happened at that
[48:43] time and from that time on it was
[48:45] different and he said it's a good thing
[48:47] that we can and he said and some of
[48:49] those memories and things we can think
[48:51] of as worthy things that changed and
[48:54] then there's some things that's not so
[48:56] worthy of thinking of and i i truly
[48:58] believe that everything happens for a
[49:01] reason i mean good or bad everything
[49:03] happens for a reason and i think if we
[49:05] can just look if we if we just look at
[49:08] the negative amen you're not going to
[49:10] see the positive if you just look at the
[49:13] bad amen you're not going to see you
[49:15] can't see what god's trying to do
[49:17] and so we we must see the good
[49:20] and look for god in everything that
[49:22] happens in our lives the good or the bad
[49:25] god can reveal himself in those things
[49:28] and i believe as the scripture says that
[49:30] he's working all things for our good
[49:32] he's working amen all things for the
[49:34] good to them that love god those that
[49:36] are called those that are chosen i mean
[49:38] and things things take place
[49:41] to bring the world or god's people to
[49:44] the condition that it or they
[49:47] need to be god allows things to happen
[49:51] amen he will allow things to happen and
[49:53] that brings the change that he's wanting
[49:55] to see
[49:57] right
[49:58] amen good good or bad negative or
[50:01] positive
[50:02] you know there's things that happen
[50:03] there's just things that happen and god
[50:05] allows these things that he's trying to
[50:06] bring us to a condition he's trying to
[50:08] he'll bring a ministry with a certain
[50:10] spirit with a with a certain anointing
[50:12] amen at a certain time amen for for a
[50:16] specific reason and god does everything
[50:18] for a purpose
[50:21] amen
[50:22] he will allow things to happen he'll
[50:24] send a portion of his word for each age
[50:28] he will send a certain type of ministry
[50:30] to help the people of that age
[50:32] and then he'll send us a specific
[50:35] anointing to do and to accomplish what
[50:37] his word requires he'll bring that he'll
[50:40] bring that unction he will send his word
[50:43] amen an anointing upon a people amen to
[50:45] defeat the enemy of that time
[50:48] amen and i believe we're we're a
[50:50] predestinated people tonight amen if i
[50:53] preach a sermon without saying
[50:55] predestinated i i don't know if i ever
[50:57] have or not but i certainly believe in
[50:59] it tonight i believe that we're a
[51:01] predestinated people and no matter what
[51:03] comes or goes i believe that god is on
[51:05] our side and i believe that we're living
[51:08] right now in the most glorious moment in
[51:11] time
[51:14] amen
[51:17] you think of
[51:19] of the negative and we can think here
[51:21] recently the effect that that covet
[51:24] has had and how things are so different
[51:27] amen some some have lost loved ones and
[51:29] friends
[51:31] some some of you have even gotten very
[51:33] sick you got very sick from it and we're
[51:35] able to recover from that by god's grace
[51:39] amen but in just a short amount of time
[51:42] the entire world has changed
[51:46] i mean if you could if we could really
[51:47] go back we could see things that were
[51:49] worse
[51:50] you know and more people died
[51:53] but
[51:54] just the global effect that this has had
[51:57] is it affect it's affected everyone
[52:01] and we can look back and say you know as
[52:04] time would go on we could look back and
[52:05] say if time would terry we could say it
[52:07] from that time
[52:09] you know things changed things were
[52:11] different
[52:12] you know
[52:13] people that went to church you know they
[52:16] quit coming to church you know it didn't
[52:18] mean that much to them anymore and you
[52:21] know
[52:22] you know it it's just coming to a time
[52:24] amen where people are rejecting god's
[52:26] mercy and we see these conditions and
[52:29] these things that god allows to come on
[52:31] the earth
[52:32] and no doubt
[52:34] you know no doubt there's worse things
[52:36] that are going to come on the earth
[52:39] there's things laying back man has
[52:40] devised a man has created within himself
[52:43] that coveted would not even touch that
[52:46] it would wipe out over over half the
[52:48] population why why are you saying these
[52:50] things because they're real because
[52:52] that's the time that we live in that
[52:54] that's what we're facing now
[52:56] and brother brown said man has always
[52:58] destroyed himself
[53:02] right
[53:04] but it's got to come to that point and
[53:06] i'm not trying to scare anybody tonight
[53:07] but it's got to come to that point and
[53:09] it's come to a point where god where
[53:11] people have rejected god's word they
[53:14] have rejected god's mercy and when you
[53:15] do that you take on his judgment
[53:19] right and the process we see the process
[53:21] of corruption of this world has become
[53:23] so rapid
[53:25] you see things that have esca it has
[53:27] escalated so quickly
[53:29] remember we know this earth is going to
[53:30] pass away
[53:32] right the heavens are going to pass away
[53:34] amen they're going to melt with a
[53:36] fervent heat amen and there's a fire
[53:38] that's going to come and cleanse this
[53:40] earth from sin that's going to come and
[53:42] cleanse this earth from the filth and
[53:44] disease that is here amen there's coming
[53:47] a change this earth is going to receive
[53:49] an experience it's going to receive an
[53:52] experience of baptism of fire amen just
[53:55] like you and i received amen that come
[53:58] down that holy ghost as brother ben was
[54:00] talking about and then it come down and
[54:02] it cleansed it changes it burned that
[54:04] away in this whole world that we're
[54:06] living in our past amen all these things
[54:09] are going to pass away they will be no
[54:11] more amen and we will remember we will
[54:14] remember no more the former things of
[54:16] this life because they're going to
[54:18] completely dissolve
[54:20] that fire is so fervent it's going to
[54:23] dissolve these things
[54:25] but this earth is corrupt
[54:27] and that but that's the condition that
[54:29] we're in
[54:32] that's where we're at
[54:34] amen
[54:37] but what a glorious time it is for the
[54:39] predestination for the believer
[54:41] brother branham says here he said lord
[54:43] jesus the hours are growing late it may
[54:45] be even later than we're thinking and
[54:47] and we're happy to see this hour
[54:49] approaching he said it's the most
[54:51] glorious hour that the world has ever
[54:53] known for the believer but for the
[54:55] rejecter it's the most saddest time
[54:58] there could ever be
[54:59] there could you there couldn't find they
[55:01] couldn't find words in the alphabet
[55:03] letters amen to make words he said that
[55:05] could express the trouble and the
[55:08] sorrows that lay ahead and he said
[55:10] neither is there words
[55:12] neither is there words that can be
[55:13] formed from our alphabet amen we as
[55:16] preachers we can try our best but he
[55:17] said there's there's not words from our
[55:19] alphabet that can be formed to express
[55:22] the blessings that lay ahead for the
[55:24] believer and then i say tonight amen
[55:26] amen stand your ground amen in your time
[55:29] take the word take the anointing for the
[55:32] hour and press the battle amen press the
[55:34] battle tonight
[55:36] there's things laying ahead for us if we
[55:38] could just press through
[55:40] we can't even think of
[55:41] amen
[55:44] the judgment the negative is so bad but
[55:46] the blessing is so great that's coming
[55:49] amen
[55:52] peter said seeing that all these things
[55:54] shall be dissolved what manner of
[55:55] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[55:57] conversation and godliness looking amen
[56:01] and hasting under the coming of the day
[56:03] of god
[56:04] amen we're living under an expectation
[56:07] and then we're looking for that for that
[56:09] day to come right
[56:11] amen and if you're looking for something
[56:13] you're expecting something and then we
[56:15] can see it the world can feel it and
[56:19] when there's something that has to take
[56:20] place amen amen the atmosphere is being
[56:24] charged amen amen for many it's the
[56:26] feeling of judgment they don't know
[56:28] where to go they don't know where to
[56:29] turn amen but for you and i hey man
[56:32] that's it it's a charge it's an
[56:34] anointing it's a feeling that we're
[56:35] gonna leave this place that we're gonna
[56:37] be raptured up out of this place amen
[56:40] that's the atmosphere that we're living
[56:41] in the expectation that we're under
[56:43] that's what we're looking for
[56:46] yes sir amen we're under a raptor
[56:49] rapture expectation amen and we're being
[56:52] charged amen by the anointed word
[56:55] of the hour
[56:59] let's look at some things that
[57:01] when they happen the world
[57:03] could never be the same
[57:05] and as we read in the scripture
[57:07] jesus hearing that john was cast into
[57:10] prison departed into galilee and we look
[57:13] at john here
[57:14] john the baptist they would ask john are
[57:17] you the messiah that is to come and he
[57:19] told him i'm not
[57:21] but john's ministry was to identify who
[57:24] the messiah was and that he was here
[57:28] and isaiah said that he was the voice of
[57:30] one crying in the wilderness
[57:33] to prepare the way of the lord making
[57:36] straight his past
[57:37] and to turn him in his ministry was to
[57:40] turn the hearts of the people back to
[57:42] god
[57:43] and then turn their attention and make
[57:46] known to them amen what was happening
[57:48] and about to take place
[57:52] amen there hadn't been a true prophet in
[57:55] the land for hundreds of years but out
[57:58] of the wilderness he came
[58:00] amen amen he came amen with a ministry
[58:04] from the word and then he came out
[58:06] dressed in camel's skin
[58:09] eating eating locusts and wild honey
[58:12] amen with a big old straggly beard amen
[58:14] dressed in and camel skin
[58:17] and man he wasn't much to look at but he
[58:19] was god's prophet and many he was god's
[58:22] man
[58:23] he was god's man and god was bringing
[58:25] about a change he was bringing about a
[58:28] change in the earth a change for the
[58:30] people of that day
[58:32] and he would use
[58:34] an old scraggly prophet like that
[58:38] amen and he would preach
[58:40] amen repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[58:43] at hand
[58:44] amen he would preach there's something
[58:46] coming
[58:47] there's someone and a change is coming
[58:49] so you better change your ways you
[58:51] better repent the kingdom is coming and
[58:54] then you better line up with the word
[58:56] and then there's a kingdom there's a
[58:57] power coming there's a dominion coming
[59:00] upon this circle someone coming
[59:02] and he was preparing the way he was
[59:04] making the way
[59:06] he was pointing the people to that
[59:08] because there was a change coming the
[59:10] earth the world would never be the same
[59:12] after this man's ministry
[59:16] amen there's someone coming
[59:18] that will produce this dominion
[59:20] that will produce this kingdom amen one
[59:23] that's going to have all power in heaven
[59:25] and in earth amen he won't just have a
[59:28] word he is the word
[59:30] amen he's he's not just a prophet he is
[59:32] the word and he's going to give this
[59:34] kingdom he's going to give this dominion
[59:36] to the people
[59:38] amen and he will reign in their hearts
[59:40] he will reign in their hearts and give
[59:42] them power over sin he'll give them the
[59:44] power over the over flesh the devil
[59:46] he'll give him power and dominion in
[59:48] this life
[59:49] he's going to reign in your heart
[59:52] there's a kingdom coming
[59:54] and that's what he pointed the people to
[59:57] yes oh my
[59:59] what a great prophet john was
[1:00:02] and there in the jordan river he
[1:00:04] baptized them that came amen and they
[1:00:06] came and they confessed their sins
[1:00:09] but in matthew 3 7
[1:00:11] he says but when he saw many of the
[1:00:13] pharisees and sadducees come to his
[1:00:15] baptism he said unto them o generation
[1:00:18] of vipers who hath warned you to flee
[1:00:21] from the wrath that is to come
[1:00:23] and there was coming a wrath
[1:00:25] if you rejected him was to take on
[1:00:27] judgment
[1:00:29] amen he said bring forth therefore
[1:00:32] fruits meet for repentance see they came
[1:00:35] to see what was going on amen they came
[1:00:37] to john's baptism but they did not
[1:00:39] partake in john's baptism amen they were
[1:00:42] not able to understand they were not
[1:00:45] able to understand that he was god's
[1:00:46] messenger for their day because he did
[1:00:49] not come in the way they thought he
[1:00:50] would
[1:00:53] they weren't able to understand he
[1:00:54] didn't come with the way they had in
[1:00:56] their mind that he should come just as
[1:00:58] jesus he didn't come the way they
[1:00:59] thought he would
[1:01:01] but that's how god does it he comes in
[1:01:03] simplicity it comes in the ways that
[1:01:06] that we as men and and in our minds we
[1:01:08] can't understand it but god does it
[1:01:10] anyway and he brings forth his word he
[1:01:13] brings forth an anointing and then he
[1:01:14] brings forth amen amen amen a word amen
[1:01:17] and someone that will bring the
[1:01:19] attention upon what god is doing
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:26] and by rejecting him as their messenger
[1:01:28] they would miss the identification of
[1:01:31] the messiah that was his ministry was to
[1:01:33] identify that jesus who jesus was that
[1:01:36] he was here
[1:01:37] that the lamb of god was here that was
[1:01:39] his ministry
[1:01:43] amen he would go on to say
[1:01:45] in matthew 3 90 said and think not to
[1:01:47] say within yourselves we have abraham to
[1:01:50] our father for i say unto you that god
[1:01:53] is able of these stones to raise up
[1:01:55] children unto abraham so they're the
[1:01:57] holy spirit on the prophet discerning
[1:02:00] their thoughts
[1:02:02] that they had abraham to their father
[1:02:04] amen think not to say within yourselves
[1:02:06] we have abraham to our father amen they
[1:02:08] were thinking we don't need to partake
[1:02:10] in this baptism we don't need a man we
[1:02:13] don't need to be preached to we've got
[1:02:14] it all figured out amen they were trying
[1:02:17] to tie themselves to what abraham done
[1:02:19] and his experience but they failed to
[1:02:21] see what god was doing in their day that
[1:02:24] they had to have their own experience
[1:02:26] that they had to come to the word right
[1:02:29] and then they missed their day
[1:02:31] they missed their day they missed what
[1:02:32] god was trying to offer to them
[1:02:36] amen and he laid the ax to the root of
[1:02:38] the tree he said if a tree doesn't bring
[1:02:41] forth fruit it is cut down and it is
[1:02:43] cast into fire amen and they cut
[1:02:45] themselves off to what was coming amen
[1:02:48] when god's crying out in his word to
[1:02:50] repent amen come and lay your life down
[1:02:52] amen come amen and lay your heart before
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:57] amen don't cut yourselves off
[1:03:00] amen but how blessed we are as a people
[1:03:02] amen to be able to have your eyes open
[1:03:04] to what god is doing amen we ought to be
[1:03:07] thankful amen that that god would show
[1:03:09] that god would reveal himself to us amen
[1:03:12] that we could
[1:03:13] we could be able to come to it
[1:03:15] and man that we could be able to accept
[1:03:16] it and receive it and let it change our
[1:03:18] lives
[1:03:20] amen he said he told him i baptized with
[1:03:23] water unto repentance but there is one
[1:03:25] coming mightier than i whose shoes i'm
[1:03:28] not worthy to unloose amen he will
[1:03:30] baptize you with the holy ghost and fire
[1:03:32] he's going to bring a renewing something
[1:03:35] that will burn out that old nature that
[1:03:37] that old nature out of you will set your
[1:03:39] hearts of fire
[1:03:41] he said his pain is in his hand and he
[1:03:44] will thoroughly purge his floor and man
[1:03:46] he's going to come and clean he's going
[1:03:48] to come and separate the seed amen we're
[1:03:50] not to try to separate ourselves we let
[1:03:52] god do the separating amen and his fan
[1:03:55] is in his hand and that fan is a is a
[1:03:57] shovel if you look that word up it's a
[1:03:59] winnowing shovel and you've got to get
[1:04:01] in that that bend and you've got to
[1:04:03] violently hey man get down there and
[1:04:05] work that seed and work that chat to
[1:04:07] separate it amen and he will thoroughly
[1:04:10] purge you an eye man amen we won't be
[1:04:12] purged by judgment amen but we'll be
[1:04:14] purged by the word amen god will come
[1:04:16] and do the work he'll come and do the
[1:04:18] separating he'll show who's his amen he
[1:04:21] will bring his wheat up into the garner
[1:04:24] and the chaff will be burned with an
[1:04:26] unquenchable fire
[1:04:29] amen keep life within you
[1:04:32] amen because that's what god's coming
[1:04:33] back for he's bringing the seed up amen
[1:04:36] and that's that's what the that's what
[1:04:37] john the baptist was pointing the people
[1:04:39] too he was pointing the people to that
[1:04:42] one he he wasn't trying to build his own
[1:04:44] kingdom amen but he was pointing them to
[1:04:46] the one amen that was going to have an
[1:04:48] everlasting effect and then god amen he
[1:04:51] he had six months of ministry that's all
[1:04:53] he had amen but this ministry was going
[1:04:55] to be from everlasting to everlasting it
[1:04:58] was going to be jesus christ the same
[1:05:00] yesterday today and forever see a
[1:05:02] prophet can come and a prophet can go
[1:05:04] amen but the god prophet the son of man
[1:05:07] amen he has no beginning he has no end
[1:05:10] he is the word from the beginning he is
[1:05:12] melchizedek
[1:05:17] hey man
[1:05:19] i got to get a drink of water
[1:05:23] i think that was a record for me
[1:05:26] without drinking any water
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:36] sorry about that
[1:05:40] amen that's who he pointed the people to
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:47] matthew 3 and 13.
[1:05:49] will go on here
[1:05:50] then jesus cometh jesus cometh from
[1:05:52] galilee to jordan
[1:05:54] unto john
[1:05:55] to be baptized of him yes
[1:05:58] but john forbad him
[1:05:59] saying i need to be baptized to thee why
[1:06:03] and cometh out of me
[1:06:06] amen but jesus answered and said unto
[1:06:08] him suffer to be so now
[1:06:10] for thus to become with us to fulfill
[1:06:12] all righteousness
[1:06:14] then he suffered him
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:17] brother brown said here he said in your
[1:06:19] life is is
[1:06:20] is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:06:23] said john said lord i have need to be
[1:06:25] baptized of thee why cometh out of me
[1:06:28] both them eyes met one another
[1:06:30] a prophet and his god amen could you see
[1:06:33] wouldn't i love to stand there and watch
[1:06:34] that see them stern deep set of eyes and
[1:06:36] john peel down and find them stern deep
[1:06:39] set of eyes of jesus second cousins to
[1:06:41] one another in the flesh but jesus said
[1:06:43] john suffered to be so now for it be who
[1:06:46] with us amen with a message of this hour
[1:06:49] it behooveth us to fulfill all
[1:06:51] righteousness and john thought yes he's
[1:06:54] the sacrifice and the sacrifice must be
[1:06:56] washed but voice presented
[1:06:58] and he said come on and be baptized amen
[1:07:01] amen in other words it behooves us to
[1:07:03] fulfill all righteousness amen the word
[1:07:05] came to the prophet and then he
[1:07:07] understood amen in the word of the lord
[1:07:09] comes to the prophet amen and the word
[1:07:12] came to the prophet in the water
[1:07:14] amen and and just as the sacrificial
[1:07:16] lamb had to be washed so the lamb of god
[1:07:19] had to be washed and he had to go to
[1:07:21] calvary he had to die that his kingdom
[1:07:24] that this kingdom of heaven his life
[1:07:26] amen will be able to come back and you
[1:07:28] and i
[1:07:32] he had to come to the water he didn't
[1:07:34] come to be washed from his sins
[1:07:36] but because he was the sacrifice that's
[1:07:38] how you and i come we're coming to be
[1:07:40] cleansed we're coming to be washed but
[1:07:42] him the sacrifice he had to be clean
[1:07:44] according to the scriptures amen to
[1:07:46] fulfill who he was
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:52] this is just what was on my heart
[1:07:57] so it was becoming to him to fulfill all
[1:08:00] righteousness
[1:08:01] amen and to become something or someone
[1:08:04] there has to be a change
[1:08:06] amen you have to come to that
[1:08:09] you're a change and you and you grow to
[1:08:11] be that
[1:08:12] and then it's becoming to us
[1:08:14] and then
[1:08:15] when jesus said it's becoming to us to
[1:08:17] fulfill the word he had to become that
[1:08:19] he had to step into that amen to further
[1:08:21] into what god
[1:08:23] wanted him to be to for who he was to be
[1:08:26] as god
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:29] he had to become that he had to be
[1:08:31] changed he had to grow into that he had
[1:08:33] you had you got to come into being and
[1:08:35] then we have to develop
[1:08:37] into what god has called us to be
[1:08:39] and it's a progression
[1:08:41] it's not a one-time deal
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] you got to go on from the baptism of the
[1:08:47] holy ghost you got to go on it's a
[1:08:50] progression it's behooving to us as is
[1:08:53] people to fulfill everything that god
[1:08:55] has said about us everything that a
[1:08:57] prophet spoke of what abroad should be
[1:08:59] it's behooving to us to move into that
[1:09:02] amen to what the church is supposed to
[1:09:04] be amen before the return of the coming
[1:09:06] of the lord jesus amen as as we have
[1:09:09] returned amen by the pure lot to the
[1:09:11] pure word amen we as a church have been
[1:09:14] prophesied that we would welcome back
[1:09:16] the lord jesus and in the power of
[1:09:18] pentecost and man we wouldn't welcome
[1:09:20] him back with an old dead church spirit
[1:09:22] amen but there would be life in the
[1:09:24] church amen there would be an atmosphere
[1:09:26] and we would be charged amen with that
[1:09:29] atmosphere of faith that we're ready to
[1:09:31] go we're looking for that day
[1:09:36] it's becoming to us to fulfill
[1:09:38] everything
[1:09:47] so just as
[1:09:50] jesus became the lamb of god that would
[1:09:51] take away the sin of the world as he
[1:09:53] obeyed
[1:09:54] the word he became that word
[1:09:57] amen and then the heavens were opened
[1:10:00] and as the scripture goes on and
[1:10:02] john saw the spirit of god descending
[1:10:04] upon him like a dove there identifying
[1:10:07] the messiah
[1:10:08] and there is a part of john's ministry
[1:10:10] he identified him as the lamb
[1:10:13] and a voice from heaven identified him
[1:10:15] and said this is my son in whom i am
[1:10:17] well pleased amen god met his son in the
[1:10:20] water and brother branham said that
[1:10:22] heaven and the earth embrace
[1:10:24] if you'll meet god in the water
[1:10:29] if you'll meet him in the water
[1:10:32] no matter how silly it seems
[1:10:34] if you meet him in the water god will
[1:10:36] come and give you that experience
[1:10:39] he will come and meet you in the water
[1:10:41] he will give you he will speak from
[1:10:43] heaven he will identify use it you as
[1:10:45] his son you as his daughter
[1:10:48] if you obey his word god will come down
[1:10:50] and identify himself with you
[1:10:56] amen heaven and earth embraced
[1:10:59] and from that time the world would never
[1:11:01] be the same
[1:11:03] never be the same right
[1:11:06] that ministry had began
[1:11:09] the devil couldn't do nothing to stop it
[1:11:11] the world couldn't do nothing to stop it
[1:11:14] and the things that were done
[1:11:15] if they be written the world could not
[1:11:17] contain the scrolls
[1:11:20] and the things that were written that
[1:11:21] were done
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:24] somebody give me some of their voice
[1:11:28] i'll take some of it
[1:11:29] come on
[1:11:31] thank you lord
[1:11:38] well john hear jesus coming into his
[1:11:41] ministry
[1:11:42] john would say i i must decrease that he
[1:11:44] can increase
[1:11:46] amen what a what a true prophet that was
[1:11:50] sitting there baptizing all those people
[1:11:52] he he had a great ministry
[1:11:55] but he laid it aside because he
[1:11:57] recognized he was on the scene that the
[1:11:59] word was here
[1:12:01] right he said i must decrease that he
[1:12:03] must increase john would be trained his
[1:12:05] whole life for only six months of
[1:12:07] preaching
[1:12:08] and jesus would say there's no greater
[1:12:10] prophet than john amen john never tried
[1:12:12] to build nothing but he prepared the way
[1:12:14] he simply done what he was supposed to
[1:12:16] do amen amen so that god's work could be
[1:12:19] done amen it's not about us church it's
[1:12:22] not about our ministry or what we want
[1:12:24] to try to do or what we want to try to
[1:12:25] portray it's about him
[1:12:28] that he could come that he could that i
[1:12:29] could decrease
[1:12:31] that i could decrease that he could
[1:12:32] increase that he that he could beat the
[1:12:35] more amen that we can make everything
[1:12:37] about him that he could have the
[1:12:38] preeminence amen and we've had a
[1:12:40] messenger in this age we've had a
[1:12:43] messenger in this age just pointing us
[1:12:44] back to the word
[1:12:46] he didn't bring us something different
[1:12:48] but he pointed us back to the word he
[1:12:50] pointed us back to the bleeding word he
[1:12:52] told us that we had to have an
[1:12:54] experience like they had on the day of
[1:12:56] pentecost he tried to point us back to
[1:12:58] what they were in the book of acts he
[1:13:00] tried to point us back to a true
[1:13:02] experience to bring us something that
[1:13:04] would hold us amen it wasn't man's idea
[1:13:07] if it was man's ideas we'd have left
[1:13:09] long ago amen but there's something
[1:13:11] holding us we've been pointed to the
[1:13:13] lamb of god that would take away to the
[1:13:15] the sin of the world
[1:13:17] we've been pointed back to the word it
[1:13:19] wasn't nothing new
[1:13:20] but he just come and restored restored
[1:13:23] us back
[1:13:25] brought us back to what was already
[1:13:26] there
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:30] amen he pointed us his ministry
[1:13:33] that messenger he pointed us to a god
[1:13:35] to a jesus this is the same yesterday
[1:13:38] today and forever the theme of his
[1:13:40] campaign
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:44] where was all those critics back then
[1:13:47] the prophets left the scene and they
[1:13:49] want to criticize
[1:13:50] they want to try to run it down and no
[1:13:52] doubt there's been there's been
[1:13:53] criticism all along
[1:13:55] there's been criticism from the
[1:13:57] beginning but they couldn't say nothing
[1:13:58] while he was here amen because he was
[1:14:00] god's vindicated prophet amen it wasn't
[1:14:03] him trying to be domineering over but
[1:14:05] that was god's chosen vessel amen but i
[1:14:07] say in this hour i say in this hour amen
[1:14:11] the prophets passed off the scene john
[1:14:13] that elijah ministries passed off the
[1:14:15] scene amen that christ could come and
[1:14:17] increase in the bride amen the weaker
[1:14:19] sin in this hour amen and be the bride
[1:14:22] of jesus christ and the age of laodicea
[1:14:25] that we could take the message that we
[1:14:26] could take the anointed word of the hour
[1:14:28] and defeat the enemy to shine forth a
[1:14:31] lot
[1:14:32] and just as jesus shined forth that
[1:14:34] light in his day when he would begin his
[1:14:36] ministry there's a lot in the bride in
[1:14:37] this hour and when she outshines
[1:14:40] everyone she's not trying to be nothing
[1:14:42] other than just what god's called her to
[1:14:44] be but i tell you amen you shine
[1:14:47] wherever you go
[1:14:49] oh yeah amen
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:54] i want that same god among us i want the
[1:14:57] god of elijah in our midst
[1:14:59] i want that god here
[1:15:02] amen elijah's passed off the scene
[1:15:04] he's done his part he said what he's had
[1:15:07] to say amen but the god of elijah is
[1:15:09] still here the god amen of abraham isaac
[1:15:12] and jacob is still here amen jehovah
[1:15:15] jesus christ the same yesterday it's
[1:15:17] still here
[1:15:22] and we as a church amen we must prepare
[1:15:26] and make a way for the move of god in
[1:15:28] this place
[1:15:29] in our homes
[1:15:31] in our lives amen and then watch your
[1:15:33] world be changed amen let that
[1:15:35] atmosphere come in amen make it a make
[1:15:38] this a place where god's welcome make
[1:15:40] your home your life a place where god's
[1:15:42] welcome amen and watch that change watch
[1:15:44] the blessing amen go forth in a time of
[1:15:46] darkness and in a time of corruption
[1:15:49] watch the blessings flow forth
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] the world can never be the same from
[1:15:57] that time
[1:15:58] it could never be the same
[1:16:00] it would have an effect for thousands of
[1:16:02] years
[1:16:04] until our day into our day
[1:16:11] so we look at the life and ministry of
[1:16:13] christ
[1:16:15] jesus said i come to do the will of my
[1:16:17] father
[1:16:18] and he only did that which the father
[1:16:20] showed him to do
[1:16:22] amen he had he had all power and all all
[1:16:25] heaven and earth in him
[1:16:27] but he obeyed the father he only did
[1:16:29] what the father showed him to he only
[1:16:31] did what the word showed him to do he
[1:16:34] only did that which pleased the father
[1:16:36] and the life of christ isn't doing what
[1:16:38] you and i want to do but it's eternal
[1:16:40] life it's living for others it's about
[1:16:42] fulfilling all the righteousness of the
[1:16:44] word amen amen amen we've got to lay
[1:16:47] aside amen we got to lay aside our
[1:16:49] feelings we've got to lay aside a man of
[1:16:52] any aspirations to become the word
[1:16:55] you've got to lay everything aside
[1:16:58] and that's what that lamb nature does
[1:16:59] that's why the that's why the dove could
[1:17:01] descend upon that land because he had
[1:17:03] given up his rights
[1:17:05] he'd given up his life
[1:17:06] because it was becoming to him to do
[1:17:08] whatever the father wanted him to do
[1:17:13] matthew 4 16.
[1:17:18] the people which sat in darkness saw a
[1:17:20] great light
[1:17:21] we read this earlier and to them which
[1:17:23] sat in the region in the shadow of death
[1:17:26] lot has sprung up
[1:17:27] when jesus went forth amen he brought
[1:17:30] light with him
[1:17:31] he was the light
[1:17:33] and he would bring those he would pass
[1:17:34] by those
[1:17:36] certain ones way
[1:17:37] and he would lift them up
[1:17:39] he would come by and he would call their
[1:17:41] name
[1:17:42] he would bring them out of darkness
[1:17:44] they were many times condemned people
[1:17:47] looked it down looked upon people amen
[1:17:50] but jesus come by and brought them forth
[1:17:52] out of the shadows of darkness out of
[1:17:54] the shadows of death many times amen
[1:17:56] that's what the ministry of jesus should
[1:17:58] be in the bride amen what should be
[1:18:00] bringers of light
[1:18:01] bringers of the word bringers of that
[1:18:03] life amen to help a people a dying
[1:18:06] generation
[1:18:09] amen he called the lost
[1:18:11] he healed the sick
[1:18:13] and then he healed the brokenhearted
[1:18:14] he's the god of redemption in this hour
[1:18:17] and then he's the god of second chances
[1:18:19] do you believe that
[1:18:21] he gave me more than one or two chances
[1:18:24] he gave me many chances
[1:18:27] but he only got to give you one
[1:18:29] to be to be to be just but he gives us
[1:18:33] chance after chance opportunity after
[1:18:35] opportunity because he's the god of of
[1:18:37] second chances
[1:18:39] god is is not willing that any should
[1:18:41] perish
[1:18:42] but that all should come to the
[1:18:43] knowledge
[1:18:44] right amen his patience is
[1:18:47] amen is long-suffering
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:52] he can make a son or daughter of god out
[1:18:54] of someone no matter the darkness
[1:18:55] they're in amen and if you're his you'll
[1:18:57] come to this light amen he will pass by
[1:19:00] your way and you'll have to come to it
[1:19:02] if you're not part of his then you'll
[1:19:04] you'll just let it go on
[1:19:06] you'll just let it go on but when the
[1:19:08] light comes by the sheep when it comes
[1:19:10] by a predestinated seed brother said
[1:19:12] they'll catch it
[1:19:14] some of us it takes years for it to
[1:19:15] really get down in there and shine where
[1:19:17] it needs to be amen but if you're his
[1:19:20] you'll accept it you'll come to that lie
[1:19:24] brother branham says here he says but
[1:19:25] there's a place where a man can come to
[1:19:27] a time that will change him forever for
[1:19:29] eternal
[1:19:30] he said and he that will come to me i
[1:19:32] will in no wise cast out said jesus and
[1:19:35] a man can come to god and his whole
[1:19:36] eternal destination has changed a man
[1:19:39] can come can meet god and it can never
[1:19:41] be the same anymore and man you can't
[1:19:43] meet god and and ever remain the same
[1:19:46] person you was if you turn away from him
[1:19:48] you'll be the worst person that you ever
[1:19:50] were but if you receive them you've got
[1:19:52] eternal life and it'll raise you up at
[1:19:54] the last day i can remember as a young
[1:19:57] man experiencing his presence
[1:20:00] i was about 12 years old
[1:20:02] i was at church camp and i think it was
[1:20:04] probably saturday night or something
[1:20:06] like that you know they had that the
[1:20:08] prayer line many times and but i can
[1:20:10] remember
[1:20:11] just coming under such a conviction
[1:20:14] and such a repentance
[1:20:16] and just there sobbing and weeping i had
[1:20:18] never never felt his presence like that
[1:20:20] before
[1:20:22] and it was something that that
[1:20:25] i don't even think when i did get saved
[1:20:27] genuinely that i even felt that
[1:20:30] but it was such an experience that it
[1:20:32] and it held with me my entire life
[1:20:35] and i i would leave there and man i felt
[1:20:37] good
[1:20:38] man i i had what i needed
[1:20:41] and you know when i
[1:20:42] i i love that church camp down there i
[1:20:45] ain't got nothing bad to say about it so
[1:20:46] i'm not even trying to go that direction
[1:20:48] you understand there's an atmosphere
[1:20:50] that's created many times in those
[1:20:52] places that that we just sometimes don't
[1:20:54] have here and that's just the way it is
[1:20:57] amen but it's designed for young people
[1:21:00] it's designed amen to to bring them into
[1:21:02] that atmosphere right
[1:21:05] and so i can remember that and i can
[1:21:06] appreciate that experience as something
[1:21:08] that stuck with me my entire life but i
[1:21:11] would go from there and you know i was
[1:21:14] going to try to serve the lord but i
[1:21:15] began to get around influences i began
[1:21:17] to get around friends
[1:21:19] and they would try to they would they
[1:21:21] would try to influence me to do certain
[1:21:23] things and it all started where it all
[1:21:24] started was music
[1:21:27] it caught my attention
[1:21:29] and it began there and from music i
[1:21:31] began if and if you ever let let the
[1:21:34] world influence you on one little thing
[1:21:37] amen if you ever let that creep in amen
[1:21:39] amen you'll be that much more easily
[1:21:41] influenced to do the next thing and the
[1:21:43] next thing and the next thing and that's
[1:21:44] what happened in my life hey man it was
[1:21:46] one thing after another something i said
[1:21:48] i would never do and then you find
[1:21:49] yourself doing it because you're hanging
[1:21:51] around those spirits you're hanging
[1:21:53] around those influences hey man but
[1:21:55] there come a time
[1:21:56] i was so hardened in my heart i was so
[1:21:59] hard and i was in such a dark place in
[1:22:01] my life amen but god had to bring me to
[1:22:04] that he had to bring me to that spot
[1:22:06] amen but there was a predestinated
[1:22:08] moment in my life there was a
[1:22:10] predestinated time that will come in
[1:22:12] each and every son and daughter of god
[1:22:14] amen and when that time comes god will
[1:22:17] come down and you'll just surrender to
[1:22:18] him and he'll come down and he'll bring
[1:22:20] the change and it'll be something
[1:22:22] that'll hold you it'll be something
[1:22:24] that'll anchor deep down inside you and
[1:22:26] there ain't nobody that can talk you out
[1:22:28] of it because nobody talked you into it
[1:22:30] brother allen it's something that god
[1:22:32] done it's something that he done and
[1:22:34] nobody can take it away and you may want
[1:22:36] to quit you may want to give up but
[1:22:38] there's something anchored down within
[1:22:39] you and then your spirit may be
[1:22:41] backslidden you may be backslidden but
[1:22:43] amen but that spirit of god has sealed
[1:22:46] you to the day of your redemption and he
[1:22:48] will bring you back amen from that
[1:22:50] condition
[1:22:53] there's a holding power within the holy
[1:22:55] ghost amen and that's what we point the
[1:22:58] people back to john pointed them to what
[1:23:00] was coming there's a holy ghost there's
[1:23:02] one that can come and baptize with the
[1:23:04] holy ghost and fire and that's what
[1:23:06] we're pointing back to tonight if you
[1:23:08] got that experience that's what we're
[1:23:10] pointing our young people to that's what
[1:23:12] we're pointing the world to there's
[1:23:13] somebody that can change
[1:23:20] right when that when that happens
[1:23:23] you can say from that time
[1:23:25] from that time
[1:23:28] you can begin to preach the kingdom
[1:23:31] everybody's a preacher
[1:23:33] everybody's a preacher
[1:23:36] enoch preached
[1:23:37] of a rapture
[1:23:39] his life testified of a rapture
[1:23:43] joel said in the last days
[1:23:45] amen i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:23:47] flesh
[1:23:49] your sons and your daughters will
[1:23:50] prophesy
[1:23:52] old men shall dream dreams young men
[1:23:54] shall see visions
[1:23:56] amen it's here for us in this last days
[1:23:58] he's here he's the same yesterday today
[1:24:00] and forever do you believe that
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:08] hey man here's something that changed
[1:24:10] we'll bring it down to
[1:24:14] a halt here
[1:24:16] we'll shut her down
[1:24:20] here's something that was changed
[1:24:22] abraham
[1:24:23] brother broom said there was a time
[1:24:24] there was a man called abraham who come
[1:24:26] down to the chaldeans he dwelt in the
[1:24:28] city where he was just a good man
[1:24:30] amen he was just an ordinary man he was
[1:24:32] getting old in 75 and his wife was 65
[1:24:36] and abraham one day when perhaps he was
[1:24:38] out in the field hunting or whatever he
[1:24:40] was doing picking berries or whatever
[1:24:42] his jaw might have been he met god and
[1:24:44] from that time he was changed and man he
[1:24:46] could call things that was not as though
[1:24:48] they were because he had met god and
[1:24:50] then he knew the very hour and the
[1:24:52] minute that he had met god something
[1:24:54] changed him a minute god told him you'll
[1:24:56] be the father of many nations
[1:24:59] and then there would become no there
[1:25:00] would be those that would refute and
[1:25:02] dispute and and try to discuss them
[1:25:05] brother branham said he said you're
[1:25:06] believing something wrong amen but every
[1:25:08] time every he said he got stronger all
[1:25:10] the time giving praise to god any time
[1:25:12] anything negative came about the promise
[1:25:15] he just got strong or giving praise to
[1:25:16] god because he knowed that god would
[1:25:18] keep the promise
[1:25:20] and he says when a man meets god it
[1:25:22] changes his makeup it gives him a super
[1:25:24] sense the natural man only has five
[1:25:26] senses but the believer when he meets
[1:25:28] god he gets something different and then
[1:25:31] it's a super sense that'll lift him up
[1:25:32] above the shadows it'll make him believe
[1:25:34] things that's impossible to come to pass
[1:25:36] and then he still believes that they'll
[1:25:38] come to pass because god said so when a
[1:25:40] man meets god something takes place
[1:25:44] moses
[1:25:45] he had been trained in all the wisdom of
[1:25:47] egypt learned how to fight he had all
[1:25:49] the degrees
[1:25:50] amen he knowed every letter he knowed
[1:25:52] everything amen he was so smart till he
[1:25:54] could teach the egyptian scholars he
[1:25:56] could teach them what they had taught
[1:25:58] him amen but a coward there he was
[1:26:00] running on the back of the desert amen
[1:26:02] there's
[1:26:03] herding sheep for a stranger
[1:26:06] hurting a sheep for a stranger but there
[1:26:07] come a time when god met him there in
[1:26:09] the burning bush and from that time on
[1:26:11] from that time moses was changed because
[1:26:14] he met god in a burning bush he met him
[1:26:16] face to face and he couldn't be the same
[1:26:18] anymore and brother brown says when a
[1:26:20] man or a woman i don't care how how many
[1:26:22] vows you make or how many pages you turn
[1:26:24] until you meet god
[1:26:26] you can't be changed but once you meet
[1:26:28] god you're changed forever and he said
[1:26:30] not only did it not only change moses it
[1:26:32] changed israel it changed egypt it
[1:26:35] changed the world at that time because
[1:26:36] one man
[1:26:38] because one man met god and he took him
[1:26:40] at his word
[1:26:42] amen that's how important an experience
[1:26:44] is
[1:26:45] that's how important it is to have an
[1:26:46] experience with god it'll change it
[1:26:48] it'll change the ones around you amen
[1:26:50] you won't get changed by them but you'll
[1:26:52] change them
[1:26:56] amen
[1:26:58] mary
[1:26:59] he said there was a little girl one time
[1:27:01] not over 18 years or maybe not that old
[1:27:03] amen she was on a road to a well that
[1:27:05] morning to get a bucket of water down to
[1:27:07] nazareth she was a nice little girl she
[1:27:09] believed she had faith but that morning
[1:27:12] she met god and god told her something
[1:27:14] and she believed it and god and it
[1:27:16] changed the whole course of her life for
[1:27:18] that woman and it makes her immortal her
[1:27:20] name was mary the mother of our lord
[1:27:22] jesus the little lady was just an
[1:27:24] ordinary girl but she met god and from
[1:27:26] that time on something happened
[1:27:28] certainly him and the world was never
[1:27:30] the same it could never be the same from
[1:27:32] that time
[1:27:34] when god met mary when mary met god
[1:27:38] saul changed to paul
[1:27:41] just a few more here okay
[1:27:43] you can run out if you need to
[1:27:46] saul of taurus is a murderer who held
[1:27:48] the code of murders
[1:27:50] that and witnessed and give witness to
[1:27:52] the death of stephen the martyr he had
[1:27:55] letters in his pockets to go down to the
[1:27:57] head councils of the churches and
[1:27:59] arrests the people that were making too
[1:28:00] much noise shouting praising god he was
[1:28:02] a man a great man on the side of the
[1:28:04] pharisees who was a pharisee of the
[1:28:06] pharisees but one day he was on his road
[1:28:08] to damascus and he met god a light
[1:28:10] shined around him and from that time on
[1:28:13] he was no longer saul of tarsus but he
[1:28:15] was paul the humble one that meek one
[1:28:17] because he met god and it changed him
[1:28:20] and then he met that lot he met that
[1:28:22] pillar of fire aiming the same pillar of
[1:28:24] fire that moses met struck down paul
[1:28:27] and the same pillar of fire that that
[1:28:29] that come in our day was the same pillar
[1:28:31] of fire that's been all the way through
[1:28:33] the same pillar fire that met a prophet
[1:28:35] that identified with him that's the same
[1:28:37] god that was in this hour
[1:28:42] and i'll throw this in there
[1:28:44] this message has changed the world
[1:28:47] it is the last message
[1:28:49] to ever go forth
[1:28:51] we will be held responsible for it
[1:28:53] the world
[1:28:55] if they've heard it if they come in
[1:28:56] contact with it they'll be held
[1:28:58] responsible in some way
[1:29:00] i'm not trying to condemn everybody or
[1:29:01] put somebody in hell or whatever
[1:29:04] but everybody
[1:29:06] will be held responsible for this day
[1:29:07] they live in
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:11] really us more so
[1:29:13] than anybody else
[1:29:15] we will be held responsible for what god
[1:29:17] has sent in this hour
[1:29:21] the leper at the gate all the remedies
[1:29:23] in the medicine could not heal him
[1:29:25] petrified sores had gotten so great till
[1:29:27] his hands was beyond raising up anymore
[1:29:29] in his feet he could hardly dragged him
[1:29:31] his case was hopeless but he met god one
[1:29:33] day coming out of the gate he fell down
[1:29:35] and worshipped him he said if thou will
[1:29:38] thou can make me clean
[1:29:40] and he said i will be thou clean
[1:29:43] just a simple word from the master
[1:29:45] this is a simple word to bring light to
[1:29:48] bring those out of the shadows of death
[1:29:49] and corruption and to bring him into
[1:29:51] life
[1:29:52] i mean he he didn't have no more leprosy
[1:29:54] because he met god
[1:29:56] oh my
[1:30:00] there was a blind man sitting by the
[1:30:01] side of the road and he could not see
[1:30:03] the daylight from the dark there was
[1:30:05] nothing could help him one day someone
[1:30:06] come walking out of the city of jericho
[1:30:08] and when he met god and from that time
[1:30:10] he could see his sight come to him amen
[1:30:13] the sight of light broke into his eyes
[1:30:15] and he could see again because from that
[1:30:17] time when he met jesus he was a
[1:30:19] different man
[1:30:21] he had his side and when a person meets
[1:30:23] god something happens definitely
[1:30:26] i mean you stand this evening
[1:30:29] you love the lord
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:33] i certainly enjoyed preaching the word
[1:30:34] tonight

[1:33:29] these needs we pray you do it now as we
[1:33:31] go into the communion service me there
[1:33:34] be a blessing in it for each and every
[1:33:35] one of these people we pray in jesus
[1:33:38] name
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:40] amen god bless you tonight amen we're
[1:33:43] going to turn to first corinthians
[1:33:45] chapter 11.
[1:33:48] first corinthians chapter 11
[1:33:51] and verse 23.
[1:33:54] we'll read the communion of scripture
[1:33:55] and go right into it
[1:33:58] isn't god good to us
[1:34:04] i think
[1:34:05] my voice left with brother stewart so i
[1:34:07] gave him mine i'm not sure
[1:34:09] it said for i have received of the lord
[1:34:11] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:34:14] the lord jesus the same night in which
[1:34:16] he was betrayed took bread
[1:34:18] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:34:20] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:34:23] is broken for you
[1:34:25] this due in remembrance of me
[1:34:27] after the same manner also he took the
[1:34:29] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:34:31] is the new testament in my blood that is
[1:34:33] you as often as you drink in remembrance
[1:34:35] of me
[1:34:37] after and
[1:34:38] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:34:40] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:34:42] death till he come
[1:34:44] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:34:46] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:34:47] unworthily
[1:34:48] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:34:50] the lord
[1:34:51] had a man examined himself and so let
[1:34:53] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:34:56] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:34:58] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:35:00] to himself
[1:35:01] not discerning the lord's body for this
[1:35:03] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:35:05] in many sleep for if we would judge
[1:35:07] ourselves we would not be judged but
[1:35:09] when we are judged we are chastened to
[1:35:11] the lord we should not be condemned with
[1:35:13] the world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:35:15] come together to eat tarry one for
[1:35:17] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:35:19] eat at home that you come not together
[1:35:21] into condemnation and the rest will i
[1:35:24] set in order
[1:35:25] when i come amen god bless you i'm going
[1:35:27] to switch
[1:35:28] microphones here if the brothers would
[1:35:29] come
[1:35:46] lord jesus i
[1:35:48] hold in my hands the bread lord which is
[1:35:50] a type of your broken body
[1:35:53] lord that was broken for us on calvary
[1:35:56] we're so thankful lord of that lord you
[1:35:58] broke your body so that ours
[1:36:01] could be whole we're thankful lord or
[1:36:04] those that have needs in their body
[1:36:05] would you just heal them
[1:36:06] or just as they eat of the bread in
[1:36:09] remembrance of you
[1:36:10] lord may they be healed not not by the
[1:36:12] bread lord but by their faith in your in
[1:36:14] your body that was broken and your blood
[1:36:17] that was spilt we pray in jesus name
[1:36:20] amen
[1:36:22] lord jesus for the wine
[1:36:25] oh god we know that the fruit of the
[1:36:27] vine gives joy gives stimulation of
[1:36:29] revelation
[1:36:30] or maybe there'd be someone here tonight
[1:36:32] that would be
[1:36:33] nor not have the joy of the lord in
[1:36:35] their life and
[1:36:36] maybe they're going through a hard time
[1:36:38] tonight i pray god that you'd help them
[1:36:41] or that you'd help them to be lifted up
[1:36:43] in joy and strength in their life oh god
[1:36:46] lord may you just as they partake of
[1:36:48] this lord and doing what what you called
[1:36:51] them to do by the word may they
[1:36:52] feel that joy not from the wine lord but
[1:36:55] from your spirit that brings joy in
[1:36:57] their life lord as they obey your word
[1:37:00] we pray in jesus name
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:05] god bless you if you could sing
[1:37:06] something while they come

[1:46:01] word as what we can amen brings humility
[1:46:04] to us love one for the other

[1:47:24] he should depart out of this world unto
[1:47:26] the father having loved his own which in
[1:47:28] the world he loved them into the end
[1:47:30] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:47:32] now put into the heart of judas iscariot
[1:47:35] simon's son to betray him
[1:47:37] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:47:39] all things into his hands that he was
[1:47:41] come from god and went to god he rises
[1:47:44] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:47:46] took a towel and girded
[1:47:48] himself after that he poured water into
[1:47:51] a base and began to wash the disciples
[1:47:53] feet and wipe them with the tower with
[1:47:55] he was girded then cometh he to simon
[1:47:57] peter and peter saith unto him lord
[1:47:59] does thou wash my feet

[1:48:03] do thou knowest not now but thou shalt
[1:48:06] know hereafter
[1:48:07] peter sayeth unto him thou shalt never
[1:48:09] wash my feet jesus answered him if i
[1:48:11] wash thee not
[1:48:12] no part with me
[1:48:14] simon peter saith in him lord not my
[1:48:15] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:48:18] jesus saith to him he that is washed
[1:48:20] needeth not saved to wash his feet it's
[1:48:23] clean every wet and you're clean but not
[1:48:25] all for he knew who should betray him
[1:48:27] therefore said he you're not all clean
[1:48:30] so after he had washed her feet and had
[1:48:31] taken his garments was set down again he
[1:48:33] said unto them
