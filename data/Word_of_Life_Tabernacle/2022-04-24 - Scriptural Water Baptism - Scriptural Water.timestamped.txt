[35:52] hand
[35:53] amen
[35:55] heavenly father we're so thankful to be
[35:57] in your presence this morning to know
[35:59] that you are here
[36:01] your lord not only because we can
[36:04] feel your presence but also because of
[36:06] the promise of your word
[36:09] two or three are gathered together in my
[36:10] name lord we're here in your name today
[36:14] your name has been revealed to us by the
[36:16] scriptures
[36:18] here in your name gathered and you
[36:20] promised you would be here too so we're
[36:22] thankful for that
[36:23] lord i pray that you would move in a
[36:26] miraculous way this morning
[36:29] pray lord that you would use the vacancy
[36:31] created by the weakness of my body
[36:34] or didn't speak directly to the people
[36:37] lord maybe there'd be someone here and
[36:39] they lifted their hands with different
[36:40] needs lord i don't know what they are
[36:43] you know lord and may you meet those
[36:45] needs all the preaching of the word is
[36:47] going forth lord while we worship at the
[36:49] end at the baptismal service lord
[36:51] whatever we do today
[36:53] lord while we're doing it may there just
[36:55] be a miraculous meeting of those needs
[36:57] lord we pray
[36:58] we thank you and we'll give you the
[37:00] glory and the honor
[37:02] for it in jesus name
[37:05] amen amen
[37:08] love the lord this morning
[37:10] matthew chapter 3 and verse 1.
[37:13] i want to speak to you this morning on
[37:15] scriptural water baptism i've had it on
[37:17] my heart for a while and i thought i'd
[37:19] take the opportunity this morning since
[37:22] uh madison madeleine he's going to be
[37:25] baptized maddie's going to be baptized
[37:28] oh where's she at she's going to get me
[37:30] in trouble again
[37:32] but we're so we're so happy to for that
[37:34] today and if there's anyone else that
[37:36] would like to be baptized there's water
[37:38] in the tank to do that but i'd like to
[37:40] talk to you about that this morning and
[37:43] like i said it's been on my heart for a
[37:44] while
[37:45] because it's an important step and maybe
[37:47] some of you that have been baptized for
[37:49] many years and you're christians you say
[37:51] well there's nothing there for me
[37:53] but i want you to listen closely because
[37:54] i believe there is something here
[37:56] because baptism begins our walk with
[37:59] christ
[38:00] and we continue that walk and the
[38:02] yielding that we do in baptism the fact
[38:04] that we we surrender ourselves to the
[38:07] water
[38:08] we also have to continue to surrender
[38:10] ourselves to christ to the word of god
[38:13] the rest of our lives
[38:15] one day
[38:16] we'll surrender ourselves in such a way
[38:19] that we'll change from these vile bodies
[38:23] into a body like his glorious body isn't
[38:25] that wonderful
[38:26] amen and so it's just the christian life
[38:29] is a surrendered life that's what we do
[38:31] we don't live our own that's a and
[38:33] that's a in this world that we live in i
[38:35] don't want to start preaching before i
[38:37] read but in the world that we live in
[38:39] what a a difference between the
[38:42] christian and the world because the
[38:43] world says be yourself do what you want
[38:46] to do live for yourself live for your
[38:48] own pleasure and christ says take up
[38:50] your cross yes
[38:53] and follow me
[38:54] but i promise you if you take up your
[38:56] cross you'll find out who you really are
[38:59] amen amen matthew chapter three and
[39:02] verse one in those days came john the
[39:03] baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[39:05] judea
[39:07] and saying repent for the kingdom of
[39:10] heaven is at hand
[39:12] this is e that was spoken of by the
[39:13] prophet isaiah saying the voice of one
[39:16] crying in the wilderness
[39:18] prepare ye the way of the lord make his
[39:20] paths straight
[39:22] and the same john had his ramen of
[39:24] camel's hair and a leather and girdle
[39:25] about his loins and his meat was locust
[39:28] and wild honey
[39:29] and went out to him jerusalem and all
[39:31] judea and all the region round about
[39:33] jordan were baptized of him
[39:35] in jordan confessing their sins
[39:38] but when he saw many of the pharisees
[39:40] and sadducees come to his baptism he
[39:42] said unto them oh
[39:43] generation of vipers who hath warned you
[39:46] to flee from the wrath to come notice he
[39:48] pointed out the self-righteous among
[39:51] them
[39:52] he said bring forth therefore fruits
[39:54] meet for repentance
[39:55] and think not to say within yourselves
[39:57] we have abraham to our father
[39:59] i say unto you that god is able of these
[40:01] stones to raise up children unto abraham
[40:04] and now also the axe is laid into the
[40:06] root of the trees therefore every tree
[40:09] which bringeth not forth good fruit is
[40:11] hewn down and cast into the fire
[40:14] he said i indeed baptize you with water
[40:17] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[40:19] me is mightier than i whose shoes i am
[40:22] not worthy to bear he shall baptize you
[40:25] with the holy ghost
[40:27] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[40:30] and will thoroughly purge his floor and
[40:33] gather his wheat into the garner but he
[40:35] will burn up the chaff
[40:37] unquenchable fire don't you want to be
[40:39] found among the wheat amen god bless you
[40:42] you could be seated
[40:48] i think one of the most memorable things
[40:49] that we can do as parents is to see our
[40:51] children baptized it's a longing in the
[40:54] heart of every parent no matter how old
[40:56] your children are
[40:57] brother stewart's going to be baptizing
[40:59] matty today after the service this
[41:01] morning and we'll just go directly into
[41:03] that service at the end of this one
[41:05] and just go directly over there so
[41:07] there'll be no
[41:08] you'll be able to come and then if you
[41:09] don't want to stay for dinner or
[41:10] whatever you can you can leave after
[41:12] that
[41:13] but uh i've baptized many folks and i've
[41:17] baptized some are still christians today
[41:20] i baptized some who are in glory
[41:23] i baptized some
[41:25] and i remember their baptism as a
[41:26] turning point in their life i'm always
[41:28] thankful for that
[41:30] that someone i remember
[41:32] sister bowers passed away this week i
[41:33] remember i baptized her son when he was
[41:35] probably in his 40s
[41:37] and suddenly he turned to god or started
[41:40] coming to church and and he was baptized
[41:43] and just a few months later he uh his
[41:45] life ended and
[41:47] and we don't know what what tomorrow
[41:49] holds and so i was thankful to be able
[41:51] to do that others
[41:53] some are born again and you see their
[41:55] life changed before or before being
[41:58] baptized and then they're baptized and
[42:00] others
[42:01] are born again at the baptism and have
[42:04] an experience with that and some
[42:07] are baptized and many years later
[42:08] they're born again and some feel the
[42:10] need to be re-baptized because they felt
[42:12] that they should have been more serious
[42:15] the first time and it is a serious
[42:17] time
[42:20] it's an important step regardless of
[42:22] when you're baptized or what age you are
[42:24] it's an important step but it's one
[42:26] which we are commanded to do it's not an
[42:29] optional thing
[42:31] and and so if you know to do good and
[42:33] don't do it that's iniquity and and so
[42:36] it's the step it's a sign it doesn't
[42:38] save you but it's a sign that you're
[42:40] surrendering your life to christ i want
[42:42] to look at the scriptures today and see
[42:44] what scriptural water baptism is and we
[42:47] know that the scripture is the bible
[42:49] nothing else
[42:52] can we say amen to that this morning are
[42:54] you awake yet this morning
[42:56] i know it's cloudy outside and it's been
[42:57] rainy but scriptural is bible
[43:00] and it's not bible plus my opinion yeah
[43:04] right
[43:04] right it's not bible plus tradition yeah
[43:08] right it's not bible plus whatever i
[43:10] think about it
[43:11] it's bible
[43:12] this is our only book brother branham
[43:14] put it this way he said there's been
[43:15] many books written philosophers has
[43:18] raised and felt he said but there's only
[43:20] one book that shall tell you who you are
[43:22] you want to know who you are this
[43:23] morning you want to really know who you
[43:25] are he said there's one book that'll
[43:27] tell you who you are where you come from
[43:29] where you're going and that's the bible
[43:32] yes he said that's the only book of all
[43:33] the fine books you we have you could
[43:36] trash them every one
[43:38] that's pretty strong isn't it he said
[43:39] you could trash him everyone this is the
[43:42] truth
[43:43] anything contrary to this
[43:45] is not right
[43:47] and we've got to stand on that because
[43:49] if we don't stand on that we have
[43:50] nothing yeah right if the bible may or
[43:53] may not be true then i may or may not be
[43:55] saved that's right yes sir that's right
[43:58] right
[43:59] if it may or may not be true then i may
[44:01] or may not be a christian
[44:03] i may or may not be going to heaven
[44:05] but because i believe the bible is true
[44:07] and i don't rest in emotion i don't rest
[44:09] in sensation i don't rest in what what
[44:12] happened my particular experience you
[44:15] understand my experience may be
[44:16] different from someone else's but that's
[44:18] not where my rest is that's not what i
[44:20] put my my my uh my my faith in but it's
[44:24] because the bible says yes that if i
[44:27] would believe on the lord jesus christ
[44:29] and repent and be baptized i would be
[44:31] filled with the holy ghost i'm resting
[44:33] on that
[44:35] amen and then that happened to me and it
[44:37] and it was just a sign to me that the
[44:39] word was true yeah
[44:41] right right but it doesn't
[44:43] regardless of my own experience the
[44:45] bible is true and i i hope we get that
[44:47] this morning
[44:48] the bible is true about baptism that's
[44:50] right the bible is true about the
[44:52] oneness of the godhead the bible is true
[44:54] about whether or not we should have
[44:55] church
[44:56] whether or not we should worship god the
[44:58] bible is true
[45:00] all others be alive something has to be
[45:02] true if you've ever had a job you know
[45:05] that somebody's got to have the final
[45:06] word
[45:08] and that's the word of god
[45:11] and the message of the hour and we
[45:12] believe the message of the hour the
[45:14] message of the hour is the light on the
[45:15] scripture
[45:17] we were in a dark room of
[45:18] denominationalism
[45:20] but there was a man christ jesus who can
[45:22] come and turn on the light
[45:24] and when he did the light of the hour
[45:26] illuminated the bible
[45:27] we would know what it said
[45:30] and it brought us back to restore us
[45:32] back to
[45:33] the scriptures now
[45:35] john the baptist was the first one to
[45:38] baptize to repentance and the word
[45:40] baptized means
[45:41] it's literally to immerse the greek word
[45:43] is baptizo which is to immerse it's if
[45:47] someone says well i was sprinkled and
[45:49] they sprinkled me with water and they
[45:51] baptized me they didn't baptize you it's
[45:52] literally impossible
[45:54] because you have to be immersed to be
[45:57] baptized it's to dip
[45:59] in the water or to immerse in the water
[46:01] to cover
[46:02] uh with the water and
[46:04] john the baptist was the first one to do
[46:06] that you notice he does it in the river
[46:07] jordan the bible tells us he baptized
[46:09] where there was much water because he
[46:11] had to go down he went down into the
[46:13] water and and the water had to cover the
[46:16] person that was being baptized and so
[46:18] scriptural baptism is
[46:21] is immersing now
[46:24] it is an outward act that's done
[46:27] in commemoration of the death burial and
[46:29] resurrection of the lord jesus i want us
[46:31] to look at this this morning
[46:33] because it identifies us as an
[46:35] individual
[46:37] with the resurrection of christ
[46:40] we must be identified that way
[46:43] now if you go to romans chapter 6 if you
[46:45] want to turn there romans chapter 6 and
[46:47] we'll read verses 1
[46:49] through 13
[46:50] you'll find that romans chapter 6 and in
[46:52] chapter 5 paul is telling them about
[46:55] grace and he's telling them that
[46:57] he indicts in the book of romans he
[46:59] indicts the world for the condition that
[47:01] they're in he makes the argument that
[47:03] even if you're not a christian even if
[47:05] you're not a jew just by being born
[47:07] nature itself ought to uh to show you
[47:10] that there's a god he makes that
[47:12] argument and he tells about all the
[47:13] horrible things and he goes through he
[47:15] talks about faith and about grace and he
[47:18] makes the point that where sin abounds
[47:20] grace super abounds
[47:23] he said grace much more abounds and so
[47:25] we believe that today but then he goes
[47:27] on to say
[47:29] that it doesn't stop there
[47:31] because there's something that has
[47:33] happened to us that grace when it picks
[47:36] us up it doesn't leave us as we are and
[47:38] i would say you know many churches today
[47:40] say come as you are i would say that's
[47:42] true but don't stay as you are because
[47:44] the bible says that you can be changed
[47:46] you can be a new creature in christ
[47:48] jesus if we don't teach that if we don't
[47:50] believe that we don't believe anything
[47:52] else
[47:52] and so we do we accept all people and
[47:54] they come as they are but i believe that
[47:56] if a person no matter what they were
[47:59] listen to me no matter what the depths
[48:01] of sin have been that they've sunk to
[48:03] that person can be raised in newness of
[48:05] life listen the body of jesus in the
[48:08] tomb was completely dead
[48:11] think about that for a minute completely
[48:13] dead and you were buried with him
[48:16] by baptism into his death that was
[48:18] completely dead and so when the body was
[48:21] completely dead that body could not
[48:23] raise itself up that's right
[48:25] i hope you hear me today but the spirit
[48:28] that was in it
[48:30] hallelujah come and raise that body up
[48:32] in newness of life and if you have the
[48:33] spirit of christ if you receive the holy
[48:35] ghost the body of sin is dead what that
[48:38] means is you don't have to pay any more
[48:40] the penalty was death
[48:42] he paid you he paid the price of death
[48:45] you don't have to pay for your sin
[48:47] but you do have to be buried with him
[48:50] right so instead of paying for your own
[48:52] sin you identify with his payment
[48:55] you're buried with him in baptism and
[48:57] you are raised in newness of life yes
[49:01] so you're not the same person that you
[49:03] were right
[49:04] so the christianity that we teach and we
[49:07] believe in makes you different it
[49:08] doesn't make you odd or weird
[49:10] it it makes you forgiven
[49:15] it doesn't make you walk around with a
[49:17] long face all the time criticizing
[49:19] people no it gives you the joy of the
[49:21] lord
[49:22] come on that's right
[49:23] right it doesn't make you
[49:25] different and your facial features are
[49:27] different in your
[49:28] in your height or your weight but it
[49:30] makes you different where it matters
[49:33] in your soul
[49:34] and then that expresses itself in your
[49:36] body so paul says what shall we say then
[49:38] if grace super abounds what shall we say
[49:41] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[49:43] abound he said god forbid
[49:46] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[49:48] any longer there and notice his argument
[49:50] he said knowing not that so many of us
[49:52] that were baptized
[49:54] into jesus christ were baptized into his
[49:58] death right
[49:59] right baptism identifies us with the
[50:02] death of christ
[50:04] you say i don't want to be identified
[50:05] with death but unless you're identified
[50:07] with death to the old life that's right
[50:10] you can never be identified with life in
[50:12] christ
[50:14] right so he says if the baptism that you
[50:17] were baptized into his death
[50:19] therefore we are buried with him
[50:22] oh i love that we are buried with him by
[50:25] baptism into death
[50:27] like as christ was raised up from the
[50:29] dead but the glory of the father even so
[50:31] we also should walk in newness of life
[50:34] for if we have been planted together
[50:38] in the likeness of his death we shall be
[50:40] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[50:44] now notice paul's line of thinking he
[50:46] says now if you went down with him if
[50:49] you were buried with him and like i said
[50:51] there's many that are baptized that have
[50:52] turned away there are some that are good
[50:54] christians today but what happened they
[50:56] did not the symbol was there but not the
[50:58] reality yes
[51:00] right but if you ever get the reality of
[51:02] being dead with him
[51:04] when you're baptized you're baptized
[51:06] into his death then you're dead with him
[51:09] and if you're dead with him
[51:11] amen
[51:12] listen now if you're dead with him you
[51:13] can't by your own works be raised that's
[51:16] right
[51:17] the body is dead
[51:19] right you're dead you can't even your
[51:22] children i think can understand this
[51:24] this morning and i hope that you do
[51:25] because several of our children are old
[51:27] enough are getting to that age to be
[51:28] baptized and some of them have already
[51:30] been baptized but when you're baptized
[51:32] you're baptized into the death of christ
[51:35] you're identifying yourself oh my you're
[51:37] right you're a death to your own
[51:39] thinking death to your own ways death to
[51:41] the old man death to you of the old sin
[51:44] death to the things you used to do death
[51:46] to the rebellion that indwells the human
[51:48] being yes are you hearing me today
[51:51] you're saying i'm i'm dying to the
[51:53] adamic nature that rebellion against god
[51:56] i'm dying to that rebellion and i'm
[51:58] being raised in newness of life
[52:02] hallelujah so now
[52:06] he said we should walk in newness of
[52:08] life for if we've been planted together
[52:09] in the likeness of his death we shall be
[52:11] also yes in the likeness of his
[52:13] resurrection
[52:15] knowing this that our old man
[52:17] is crucified with him
[52:20] i tell you what that old man deserved it
[52:25] wasn't nothing good in him
[52:27] paul said it this way he said he said
[52:29] who should deliver me from the body of
[52:31] this death it's a it's a canker it's
[52:34] there's nothing good in my old man right
[52:36] i'm not talking about my father i'm
[52:38] talking about this
[52:40] the old man is the flesh
[52:43] nothing good in the flesh
[52:45] but our old man is crucified with him
[52:48] hey man put to a cruel death that the
[52:50] body of sin
[52:52] might be destroyed
[52:55] that henceforth we should not serve
[52:58] sin
[52:59] now is it possible to it's possible to
[53:03] make a mistake sure we don't serve sin
[53:07] when we make a mistake we make it right
[53:09] that's right
[53:10] because we still and you understand
[53:12] you're being redeemed there will come a
[53:13] day when you'll never make another
[53:14] mistake because you'll be in a perfect
[53:16] body that day is not today
[53:20] right so just go ahead and give up on
[53:22] that idea
[53:23] well i'm going to be perfect somehow
[53:25] before the rapture no the moment the
[53:26] rapture happens that's when you're going
[53:28] to be perfect
[53:30] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[53:31] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[53:33] an eye
[53:34] but i like what brother stewart preached
[53:35] about wednesday night because we are we
[53:37] do need to come to a maturity as the
[53:39] bride of christ beyond just being
[53:41] perfected by the blood but yet there has
[53:43] to come a maturity in us that we reckon
[53:46] ourselves dead and we walk in newness of
[53:48] life and that's what paul is saying as
[53:49] well he said don't stop at baptism
[53:53] but identify yourself with the death
[53:54] burial and resurrection of christ yes
[53:57] now
[54:01] it says we his force should not serve
[54:02] sin for he that is dead is freed from
[54:04] sin so sin is presented as the task
[54:06] master as the slave driver
[54:09] and we were the slave but now we're
[54:12] freed from sin he said now if we be dead
[54:14] with christ we believe that we should we
[54:16] shall also live with him now what does
[54:18] that mean
[54:19] it means i can walk away without that
[54:22] sin being able
[54:24] to force me to do what i didn't want to
[54:26] do
[54:28] right i think there's very few people
[54:30] that want to smoke
[54:32] that's right
[54:33] but it's it's a it's a desire
[54:35] and it becomes even a physical thing a
[54:37] desire but sin has no more dominion over
[54:40] you
[54:41] paul says because you're not under the
[54:43] law you're under grace that's right law
[54:45] and your body tells you you don't you
[54:47] have to have that but but christ says
[54:49] you
[54:50] don't right
[54:52] you don't have to do and so
[54:54] you're not bound to do the things that
[54:56] you that you don't want to do yes
[54:59] amen i don't think any christian wants
[55:01] to sin wants to do wrong there's lots of
[55:04] people who aren't christians that don't
[55:05] want to do wrong but they can't help it
[55:08] many of them are caught up in in drugs
[55:10] and alcohol and all kinds of different
[55:12] things and they want to do what's right
[55:14] but they just can't help they just can't
[55:16] help but do what they do but i'm here to
[55:18] tell you this morning there is a blood
[55:21] there is a christ there is a resurrected
[55:23] christ
[55:24] a life that you can walk in where you
[55:26] can be completely free
[55:29] are you hearing me this morning
[55:31] completely free not partially free
[55:34] not free during certain times of the
[55:36] week
[55:37] not free during church time but free all
[55:39] of the time
[55:40] yes sir
[55:42] so he says you reckon yourself to be
[55:44] dead to sin
[55:45] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[55:48] our lord
[55:49] i think i skipped a couple verses but he
[55:51] said let not sin therefore reign in your
[55:53] mortal body that you should obey it in
[55:55] the lust or the desires thereof
[55:58] either yield ye your members as
[55:59] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[56:02] but yield yourselves unto god there's
[56:04] the christian life
[56:08] i hope the kids hear me and the young
[56:09] people and the adults
[56:12] the christian life is yielding
[56:15] yes
[56:18] and when we protect our self-interest
[56:20] above all else we're not yielding yes
[56:24] when we make ourselves bigger than the
[56:26] word we're not yielding
[56:29] when we when we think that well
[56:32] you know today it's like anything that
[56:35] you say that you disagree with me on is
[56:36] a personal attack against me that's the
[56:39] way the world feels
[56:41] and you can't you can't disagree with me
[56:42] because then you do violence to me
[56:45] that's wrong
[56:48] because i'm not right
[56:50] just because i think yeah yeah there you
[56:53] go right
[56:54] just because i am doesn't mean i'm right
[56:56] that's right
[56:58] just because i was born the bible
[56:59] teaches the very opposite you were born
[57:01] in sin shaping and iniquity
[57:03] so no one here was born right
[57:06] we were born wrong
[57:08] and we're made right by the blood of
[57:10] jesus christ but there's such a freedom
[57:12] in that because what that means is you
[57:14] know if you just have to be what you are
[57:16] and they say today that well if you're
[57:18] if you're a homosexual if that's if you
[57:20] you're attracted to men that that's got
[57:22] to be what you are that's just you were
[57:25] born that way and you just gotta you
[57:27] gotta present that way and you'll change
[57:28] into a woman or do something like that
[57:30] but the bible tells us differently
[57:32] you were that way because of a fallen
[57:34] nature you were that way that doesn't
[57:36] mean that you'll be lost but you gotta
[57:38] change that
[57:39] you can't do it on your own you've got
[57:41] to come to christ
[57:43] and if you come to christ let him take
[57:45] that out of you
[57:47] be buried with it
[57:48] by baptism into his death and be raised
[57:51] in newness of life
[57:53] so we don't just express what we are yes
[57:56] and that's why we let
[57:58] this is why we let the bible dictate
[58:00] what we do
[58:02] and where the bible tells us how we
[58:03] should dress and what we should do and
[58:05] how we should act we do that
[58:07] right and that's not a law that's not
[58:08] someone standing up here and me checking
[58:10] everybody to go out and say well you
[58:12] can't come in unless you dress a certain
[58:13] way it's not that at all
[58:15] but we believe the bible
[58:17] and we're yielded to the bible
[58:19] we want others to yield to the bible but
[58:20] i can't do that for you
[58:23] right i'm not going to treat you wrong
[58:25] because you don't yield but you need to
[58:26] yield if you want to if you want to be
[58:29] identified in his resurrection yes you
[58:31] need to yield to his death yes
[58:35] so now he said yield your members as
[58:37] instruments of righteousness unto god so
[58:40] in other words we're following christ
[58:42] we're following you hear that a lot
[58:44] anymore disciples christ followers yes
[58:48] and you we hear that a lot anymore and
[58:50] we are following christ yeah right
[58:53] right
[58:54] but we're following him not just to
[58:56] church
[58:57] not just to where we can hang a cross up
[58:59] in our window
[59:01] not just where we can say god sent a
[59:02] prophet but we're following christ in
[59:05] the walk that he walked yes
[59:08] follow him to the cross
[59:10] follow him to the grave yes
[59:12] are you with me now yes and follow him
[59:14] to the sky yes
[59:16] baptism is the beginning of that journey
[59:19] brother branham says this he said notice
[59:20] when elisha following elijah and you'll
[59:22] find that in in first kings chapter two
[59:25] i believe when elisha when elijah is
[59:27] about to be taken up and elisha is
[59:29] following elijah he said for a reason
[59:32] right he said where did he take him to
[59:34] jordan to ramos gilead up to the school
[59:37] of prophets and down to jordan so he
[59:38] made steps along the way he said that's
[59:41] the way he takes you through
[59:42] justification sanctification and dying
[59:44] out to receive life he said not to a
[59:47] denomination or some cream but to death
[59:50] to your spirit so you can be born again
[59:53] and so elisha in in spite of the fact
[59:55] that elijah told him to stay here elisha
[59:58] followed him in spite of that and he
[1:00:01] followed his he followed him because he
[1:00:03] wanted to go through the same path to
[1:00:05] take the same journey because if he took
[1:00:08] the same journey then the tower that was
[1:00:10] on elijah could come on him oh i'm here
[1:00:13] to tell you church that we cannot listen
[1:00:15] we cannot live as christians in the day
[1:00:18] that we live in but unless the power the
[1:00:20] spirit that was on jesus christ comes
[1:00:23] back on us yes you can't do it on your
[1:00:25] own so what do we have to do we got to
[1:00:27] go with with him to bethel go with him
[1:00:30] to ramos gilead go with him to
[1:00:31] justification follow him to
[1:00:33] sanctification following to the grave
[1:00:36] following the baptism and following
[1:00:38] across the river and when you get to the
[1:00:40] other side you can say where is the god
[1:00:42] of elijah yeah
[1:00:45] he's right here
[1:00:48] are you with me now yes
[1:00:55] i've had a hard week joel leave me alone
[1:01:00] joel sits over there and judges the way
[1:01:02] my caller turns up and
[1:01:04] bless his heart
[1:01:06] i'm gonna do that to you tonight i'm
[1:01:07] gonna sit right there
[1:01:11] aren't you glad
[1:01:13] aren't you glad that though we're not
[1:01:14] perfect
[1:01:16] we can still follow christ
[1:01:20] brother brown said we follow jesus to
[1:01:22] his death burial and baptism
[1:01:24] death burial and resurrection rather he
[1:01:26] said through baptism
[1:01:28] isn't that a powerful thought yes he
[1:01:30] said we believe him we're to die out to
[1:01:32] the things of the world confess that
[1:01:34] we're nothing baptized in his name
[1:01:36] buried with him in baptism raised with
[1:01:38] him in resurrection our spirits live up
[1:01:41] above the things of the world he said
[1:01:43] then we're in christ
[1:01:46] i pick on joel and these kids up here
[1:01:48] because i can't see the rest of you with
[1:01:49] my glasses off
[1:01:53] scriptural baptism what is it it's in
[1:01:54] the name of jesus of the lord jesus
[1:01:56] christ yes that's right right matthew 28
[1:01:59] 19 let's look at that it says go you
[1:02:01] therefore and teach all nations
[1:02:03] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:02:05] and of the son
[1:02:07] of the holy ghost now if you're baptized
[1:02:09] in trinitarian circles today they'll
[1:02:10] baptize you in the name of the father
[1:02:12] and in the name of the son
[1:02:14] and in the name of the holy ghost but
[1:02:15] that's not what it says
[1:02:18] right it says baptize them in the name
[1:02:20] of the father
[1:02:22] of the son
[1:02:23] of the holy ghost now that's into the
[1:02:25] name if you go back in the original into
[1:02:27] the name we're baptized into the name
[1:02:30] we've been baptized into christ
[1:02:32] baptized into the name not names
[1:02:35] now brother random says this he said in
[1:02:37] the name of the father son and holy
[1:02:38] ghost he said there's no such thing as
[1:02:39] the name of the father because father is
[1:02:41] not a name it's a title that's right no
[1:02:43] such thing as the name of son because
[1:02:45] son is a title no such thing as name of
[1:02:46] the holy ghost that's what he is yes
[1:02:49] sure all right so if i told you to
[1:02:50] baptize in the name
[1:02:52] of the pastor the dad and the husband
[1:02:56] all right there's lots of dads and
[1:02:57] husbands here but one pastor
[1:03:00] right
[1:03:02] you would baptize in my name
[1:03:05] i would hope
[1:03:06] i didn't get my thought across very well
[1:03:10] say now i baptize you in the name of the
[1:03:12] pastor and the name of the dad and the
[1:03:13] name of the husband but you could say
[1:03:15] all of that by just saying ben pruitt
[1:03:18] that's right right that's my name
[1:03:21] now
[1:03:22] ephesians
[1:03:23] 3 14 tells us for this cause i bow my
[1:03:26] knees unto the father of our lord jesus
[1:03:28] christ of whom
[1:03:31] now watch the whole family
[1:03:36] yes
[1:03:37] if you're not if you don't believe in
[1:03:39] his name and you're not baptized in his
[1:03:41] name you can't be in the family
[1:03:45] what are you saying
[1:03:46] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:03:48] earth
[1:03:49] is named
[1:03:51] yes
[1:03:52] right is named
[1:03:53] who who are they named the lord jesus
[1:03:55] christ he actually says in the father of
[1:03:57] our lord jesus christ now watch jesus
[1:03:59] said in john 5 43 i am come in my
[1:04:02] father's name
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:06] he said you receive me not if another
[1:04:08] shall come in his own name him will you
[1:04:10] will receive
[1:04:12] and so there's no other name the
[1:04:14] scripture tells us for salvation or
[1:04:15] healing look at acts chapter 4 and verse
[1:04:17] 10 he said be it known unto you all and
[1:04:19] all the people of israel but that by the
[1:04:21] name of jesus christ of nazareth whom
[1:04:24] you crucified whom god raised from the
[1:04:26] dead even by him that this man stand
[1:04:28] here before you whole you want healing
[1:04:30] you have to be healed in his name
[1:04:33] you're healed in his name you're saved
[1:04:34] in his name there is no other name
[1:04:38] right
[1:04:39] now he says
[1:04:41] he says even by him does this man stand
[1:04:43] before you hold this is the stone which
[1:04:45] was said it not of you builders which
[1:04:46] has become the head of the corner
[1:04:48] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:04:51] for there is none other name under
[1:04:53] heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:04:56] be saved what name the name of jesus
[1:04:58] christ of nazareth yes
[1:05:02] that's what he says
[1:05:04] now colossians 3 17
[1:05:07] whatsoever you do
[1:05:09] so i'm preaching in his name
[1:05:11] yeah right you're going to church in his
[1:05:12] name
[1:05:14] we're going to eat in his name a little
[1:05:15] while later
[1:05:17] yeah right everything we do
[1:05:19] we in word or deed
[1:05:21] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:05:23] giving thanks to god and the father
[1:05:26] by him all
[1:05:28] new testament baptisms
[1:05:30] were in the name of jesus christ yes
[1:05:34] all without exception there was no other
[1:05:36] name
[1:05:37] used by the apostles
[1:05:39] other than the name of jesus christ yes
[1:05:41] the jews in acts 2 38 peter said unto
[1:05:43] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:05:45] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:05:47] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:05:48] the gift of the holy ghost the promise
[1:05:50] is unto you and to your children to all
[1:05:52] that are far off even as many as the
[1:05:54] lord our god shall call so he says be
[1:05:56] baptized in the name the samaritans in
[1:05:58] acts 8 16 the bible says that they had
[1:06:01] not yet had the spirit fallen upon them
[1:06:03] but they were baptized in the name of
[1:06:05] the lord jesus that was samaritans
[1:06:08] gentiles in acts chapter 10 and verse 48
[1:06:10] he commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:06:12] name of the lord
[1:06:14] and pray they him to terry certain days
[1:06:16] so they were baptized in the name and
[1:06:18] peter said the name is the name of the
[1:06:20] lord jesus
[1:06:21] christ of jesus christ now
[1:06:23] and brother branham said you could use
[1:06:25] jesus christ or the lord jesus christ he
[1:06:27] uses the lord jesus christ because it
[1:06:29] tells us who he is
[1:06:32] our lord yes
[1:06:33] right because there there might be
[1:06:35] someone else named jesus or even jesus
[1:06:37] christ but he is the lord jesus christ
[1:06:40] now
[1:06:41] paul in first corinthians 1 he goes into
[1:06:43] that we don't have time to go into that
[1:06:44] today but he said you weren't baptized
[1:06:46] in my name
[1:06:48] i know there's there's
[1:06:50] elements today that would baptize the
[1:06:51] name of william branham it's it's
[1:06:53] antichrist yes right right you weren't
[1:06:56] baptizing william branham's name
[1:06:58] because you weren't saved in william
[1:06:59] branham's name
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:03] you're not baptizing the name of a
[1:07:04] pastor
[1:07:06] you're baptized in the name of jesus
[1:07:07] christ
[1:07:09] and it's more than just the words that
[1:07:11] we say but you're baptized under the
[1:07:13] authority of christ
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:17] now so they were baptized those who were
[1:07:19] baptized differently had to be
[1:07:21] re-baptized because you remember john we
[1:07:23] started with john john went and baptized
[1:07:25] but he baptized them to repentance he
[1:07:27] couldn't baptize in the name of jesus
[1:07:29] christ because christ had not yet come
[1:07:31] and the death burial and resurrection
[1:07:32] had not yet taken place and so there
[1:07:35] were some disciples of john who remained
[1:07:37] disciples of john and had not yet heard
[1:07:40] of this baptism in the name of jesus
[1:07:42] christ in acts chapter 19 verse 1 it
[1:07:44] says it came to pass that while apollos
[1:07:46] was that corinth paul passed through the
[1:07:47] upper coast and came to ephesus and find
[1:07:50] certain disciples and he said unto them
[1:07:51] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:07:53] you believed and they said unto him we
[1:07:55] have not so much as heard whether there
[1:07:57] be any holy ghost and he said unto them
[1:07:59] unto what then were you baptized and
[1:08:01] they said unto john's baptism so they
[1:08:03] would not have been baptized in the name
[1:08:05] of jesus christ he said then said paul
[1:08:08] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[1:08:10] repentance saying unto the people that
[1:08:12] they should believe on him which should
[1:08:14] come after him that is on christ jesus
[1:08:16] when they heard this they were baptized
[1:08:19] in the name
[1:08:20] of the lord jesus yes
[1:08:22] you would think that if every time in
[1:08:24] the scripture that it was done
[1:08:26] that it would be done in that name that
[1:08:28] that's the way people would do it today
[1:08:29] yet most denominational christians do
[1:08:31] not do that today
[1:08:35] well what happened well it's the word
[1:08:36] plus somebody's idea yeah that's right
[1:08:40] and again this isn't difficult
[1:08:42] you don't have to take brother brandon's
[1:08:44] word on this yes
[1:08:46] you don't have to take my word on it you
[1:08:47] just look at the scripture
[1:08:49] right because they were baptized in the
[1:08:51] name of the lord jesus so if we want to
[1:08:53] if baptism is so important to us it
[1:08:55] begins our our walk with christ
[1:08:58] our newness of life it puts us
[1:09:00] identifies us with the death burial and
[1:09:01] resurrection of christ then we want to
[1:09:03] be baptized correctly yes
[1:09:05] right and want to stay as close to the
[1:09:07] scripture as we can and so that's why we
[1:09:09] do it the way that we do immersed in
[1:09:10] water and baptized in the name of the
[1:09:12] lord jesus christ
[1:09:14] now when paul laid his hands upon them
[1:09:16] the holy ghost came on them and they
[1:09:18] spake with tongues and prophesied so
[1:09:19] baptism is not the end but baptism is a
[1:09:22] start and if you're baptized correctly
[1:09:24] you are a candidate then for the holy
[1:09:26] ghost
[1:09:28] and galatians 1 and 8 tells us that
[1:09:30] though we are an angel from heaven
[1:09:32] preaching the other gospel unto you and
[1:09:33] that which we have preached unto you let
[1:09:35] him be accursed i've had many people
[1:09:36] come to me and try to tell me that it's
[1:09:38] some other name or some other way or
[1:09:40] some other we were wrong about this if
[1:09:42] you're not an angel from heaven or paul
[1:09:44] you don't even fit in this scripture but
[1:09:46] he said even if an angel came you ain't
[1:09:48] no angel
[1:09:52] said let him be accursed yes
[1:09:55] scriptural baptism and put it in the
[1:09:57] common vernacular there scriptural
[1:09:59] baptism is essential
[1:10:01] i want to get to this because i know
[1:10:03] there's some things that we have to do
[1:10:05] in the church are you still with me this
[1:10:07] morning i know it's a little bit
[1:10:08] different and uh for me i i've been a
[1:10:11] little bit under the weather and i
[1:10:12] thought well maybe we'll just teach out
[1:10:13] of the scripture today and i'll try not
[1:10:15] to get too excited maybe i'll be okay
[1:10:17] i'm not sick where i can hurt you it's
[1:10:19] just the allergies really get me down
[1:10:21] every year about this time and
[1:10:23] and so i'm just kind of pushing my way
[1:10:25] through it you all just
[1:10:26] the faster you amen the faster i'll get
[1:10:28] through it so now
[1:10:31] baptism is essential now we were left
[1:10:33] with three outward ordinances as a
[1:10:35] church that we had to do
[1:10:37] baptism communion and foot washing
[1:10:40] look it was so essential to them look at
[1:10:42] the story we just read paul come to them
[1:10:44] and he said you've got to be baptized
[1:10:46] not just baptized but baptized correctly
[1:10:48] that's right right if you want to
[1:10:50] receive the holy ghost you've got to
[1:10:52] follow him in baptism
[1:10:53] so it's an essential thing
[1:10:55] baptism communion and foot washing
[1:10:58] that's the only outward ordinances
[1:11:00] now i i may hurt your feelings a little
[1:11:02] bit he didn't leave us so many tapes to
[1:11:03] listen to
[1:11:06] that would be an outward ordinance to
[1:11:07] the church he didn't even say read so
[1:11:09] many scriptures right
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:13] he didn't say get on your app and
[1:11:16] and and and have this little time with
[1:11:18] god every day and that's a good thing i
[1:11:19] want you to do that yeah right if you've
[1:11:21] got an app that helps you or some way of
[1:11:23] meditation or something but that wasn't
[1:11:24] the ordinance he left us yes
[1:11:27] say well i get on the internet and i
[1:11:29] watch my favorite preacher and i get on
[1:11:31] there and i watch them and and i'm
[1:11:32] overjoyed by the service and i listen to
[1:11:34] the sermon i must be a christian
[1:11:36] but have you done the things that god
[1:11:38] told you to do
[1:11:40] right because that's what makes us a
[1:11:42] christian is our yielding to christ
[1:11:44] is our yielding to the word
[1:11:46] so
[1:11:47] these things have to be done yeah
[1:11:49] there's no alternatives to it
[1:11:51] brother branham tells us there's a
[1:11:52] baptismal service following this one he
[1:11:54] said if anyone here that has not been
[1:11:56] baptized in the name of our lord jesus
[1:11:57] christ let me say to you as god's
[1:11:58] servant baptism is essential to
[1:12:00] salvation
[1:12:02] no it's not salvation but it's essential
[1:12:04] to salvation
[1:12:06] he said he that believeth and is
[1:12:07] baptized shall be saved now if you
[1:12:10] haven't been baptized in the name of our
[1:12:11] lord jesus christ you believed on him
[1:12:13] and confessed your sins come now forward
[1:12:15] after this service and you can be
[1:12:16] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:12:18] the remission of your sins
[1:12:20] now he also taught us communion and foot
[1:12:23] washing our essentials i want to talk to
[1:12:24] some of you have been in church for a
[1:12:26] while yeah
[1:12:28] you realize that's not optional right
[1:12:31] communion and foot washing
[1:12:33] it's not optional now he didn't tell us
[1:12:34] how many times to do it right yeah early
[1:12:37] church he did it every week
[1:12:39] he met every week but we don't do that
[1:12:41] we do it every every other month i
[1:12:43] believe it's a schedule that we're on
[1:12:44] now because there's no scripture for how
[1:12:45] often right yeah right but you've got to
[1:12:48] do it
[1:12:49] and i know christians who have never
[1:12:51] washed saints feet
[1:12:54] message believers who have never taken
[1:12:55] communion and i have to tell you
[1:12:59] you are not with the word of god
[1:13:02] not following christ right you can't be
[1:13:06] right you're actually actively denying
[1:13:09] the word
[1:13:11] by not doing what god told you to do
[1:13:13] yeah and it's a very simple thing
[1:13:15] right it's not difficult
[1:13:17] but we make it difficult because we
[1:13:18] build up things in our mind
[1:13:20] well i'm not worthy well if you're not
[1:13:21] worthy are you a christian
[1:13:24] if you're a christian you'll say well
[1:13:26] i've made a mistake since i've been a
[1:13:27] christian repent of it
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:30] that's all it takes
[1:13:31] but it is essential to your christian
[1:13:33] walk
[1:13:34] you can't be as good a christian
[1:13:37] i will say this
[1:13:38] i don't believe a christian will if
[1:13:40] you're a real christian i don't believe
[1:13:41] that you will
[1:13:43] remain in a condition where you have
[1:13:45] where you never wash feet you never take
[1:13:48] communion and you never were baptized
[1:13:53] that's getting kind of
[1:13:55] there you said well well we do that and
[1:13:57] again it doesn't save you
[1:13:58] but if we want to obey the simple
[1:14:00] command of the word how are we ever
[1:14:01] going to receive the holy ghost
[1:14:04] right yes
[1:14:06] and so
[1:14:07] brother branham said i might explain he
[1:14:09] said as i said a few moments ago he said
[1:14:11] the thing that god left for us to do
[1:14:13] water baptism one article communion
[1:14:15] that's two and if you want to find that
[1:14:17] well we read the communion scripture the
[1:14:18] communion scripture is first corinthians
[1:14:20] chapter 11. the scripture for foot
[1:14:22] washing is saint john 13. and if you
[1:14:25] want to find that you go back and read
[1:14:26] that he says happier you if you do it he
[1:14:28] leaves that with us to do
[1:14:31] and so he said that's true god is
[1:14:32] perfected and three feet washing is the
[1:14:34] third he said we remember that years
[1:14:36] later even in the bible some people try
[1:14:38] to say it's not necessary yeah
[1:14:41] he said certainly i don't mean to say
[1:14:42] that people's feet need washing that
[1:14:44] isn't it maybe theirs did not either but
[1:14:46] it was an act of humility it's an act of
[1:14:48] doing just as essential as water baptism
[1:14:51] because he said here that i've given you
[1:14:53] an example that you should do to each
[1:14:55] other as i've done to you i know there
[1:14:57] are some people that get feeble in their
[1:14:58] body where they can't come to church or
[1:15:00] maybe they get to the point where they
[1:15:02] can't physically wash feet and i believe
[1:15:04] god the blood of jesus christ is what
[1:15:05] saves us
[1:15:07] right god understands that but if you
[1:15:09] can and don't god knows that too
[1:15:13] right and we find ourselves in rebellion
[1:15:15] against god
[1:15:17] so we don't want to do that do we
[1:15:20] rebellion against god doesn't go well
[1:15:22] ask the sodomites
[1:15:25] a rebellion against god goes ask israel
[1:15:28] how rebellion against god goes
[1:15:31] when they wouldn't receive him
[1:15:33] when he come to them and he wept over
[1:15:34] jerusalem they wouldn't receive him and
[1:15:36] he said
[1:15:37] he said i would have hovered over you
[1:15:39] like a hen over a chicken he said but
[1:15:40] you would not ask them how that went
[1:15:43] yes
[1:15:44] when a few years later titus destroyed
[1:15:46] jerusalem we don't want to be found in
[1:15:49] rebellion
[1:15:50] against god
[1:15:52] now
[1:15:53] and again i don't say that to scare you
[1:15:55] you've got to do it because you have the
[1:15:56] love of jesus christ in your hearts all
[1:15:58] right if you love the word then you'll
[1:16:00] you'll come to christ right he'll do
[1:16:02] these things but people will tell me
[1:16:03] today and satan gets in the middle of
[1:16:06] that and and today we have streaming and
[1:16:08] i just want to address that quickly
[1:16:09] because
[1:16:10] we have people that stream the services
[1:16:12] i know there's some that do that
[1:16:13] exclusively and we have people that do
[1:16:15] that are watching right now
[1:16:17] that are our streamers of our services
[1:16:19] that don't live too far to come to
[1:16:21] church and i'm glad that they do that
[1:16:23] ideally
[1:16:24] you would have a church in your
[1:16:25] neighborhood that you could go to church
[1:16:27] at
[1:16:28] right the idea is not to build this one
[1:16:30] into a mega church
[1:16:32] the idea is if we get too many people to
[1:16:34] start another one
[1:16:36] right where i'm not the pastor but god
[1:16:38] raises up a pastor
[1:16:40] you understand that's the idea of that's
[1:16:42] the new testament idea
[1:16:44] it's not to just build this together but
[1:16:46] people stream and i know people do it
[1:16:47] overseas we've got people overseas that
[1:16:49] watch our services i want our services
[1:16:50] to be open but that is not a replacement
[1:16:53] for the things that you can only do in
[1:16:55] the church
[1:16:56] that's right
[1:16:58] right now i could wash my my wife's feet
[1:17:01] at home and there's a doctrine going
[1:17:02] around now that you can do communion
[1:17:04] foot washing by yourselves at home well
[1:17:06] for single people that's difficult
[1:17:13] and even if you could there's no
[1:17:14] humility in it
[1:17:17] right i mean i can wash my own feet
[1:17:19] don't take no humility for that you see
[1:17:21] how by our traditions we destroy the the
[1:17:23] word of god yes sir
[1:17:25] right the whole purpose of it the bible
[1:17:27] said the purpose of it was humility how
[1:17:30] can we do that by ourselves okay well
[1:17:31] i'll just serve myself communion
[1:17:33] listen i believe again that if there was
[1:17:35] somebody who could not get to a church
[1:17:37] that was stuck in alaska somewhere in
[1:17:39] the jungles of africa could not get to
[1:17:41] church and they took the communion and
[1:17:43] broke the bread if they did it correctly
[1:17:45] i believe god would honor that
[1:17:47] but if there is any way that you could
[1:17:49] have went to church
[1:17:51] and you didn't go to church
[1:17:53] and you served yourself communion you
[1:17:55] went against god
[1:17:56] go look at the communion scripture first
[1:17:58] corinthians 11 see how many times paul
[1:17:59] says when you come together
[1:18:03] right four or five times in that
[1:18:04] scripture he says when you come together
[1:18:07] right now when you do it at home
[1:18:09] and and listen to a tape
[1:18:12] man i got to get off of this
[1:18:15] now look
[1:18:17] he said i've given you an example that
[1:18:18] you should do to others i've done to you
[1:18:20] he said we find out in the scripture a
[1:18:21] widow could not be brought in amongst
[1:18:22] the people unless she had lodged
[1:18:24] strangers had washed the feet of the
[1:18:25] saints showing ourselves humble he said
[1:18:28] that if anything we want to be is humble
[1:18:30] isn't that what we want to be today
[1:18:31] because that's the secret to power is
[1:18:33] through humility and you're always happy
[1:18:36] when you come out of these things of
[1:18:37] doing them he said it's a blessed order
[1:18:39] of fellowship we observe here at the
[1:18:40] church
[1:18:42] and so we do that with someone other
[1:18:44] than our family right because that's the
[1:18:46] purpose of it
[1:18:47] humility and to follow the word of god
[1:18:50] to come together and take break the
[1:18:52] bread together because we're the body of
[1:18:53] christ together
[1:18:55] right we're just apart by ourself
[1:18:58] baptism though was never an end in
[1:19:00] itself
[1:19:01] but it points to a spiritual happening
[1:19:03] first peter chapter 3 and verse 18
[1:19:05] for christ also hath once suffered for
[1:19:07] sins
[1:19:08] just for the unjust that he might bring
[1:19:10] us to god being put to death in the
[1:19:12] flesh but quickened by the spirit by
[1:19:14] which also he went and preached unto the
[1:19:16] spirits in prison which sometimes were
[1:19:18] disobedient look look at how god does he
[1:19:21] doesn't leave him he goes and preaches
[1:19:23] to him even after they've turned it down
[1:19:25] they have to hear it yes and so he said
[1:19:28] we're disobedient when once the
[1:19:29] long-suffering of god waited in the days
[1:19:31] of noah well the ark was preparing we're
[1:19:33] in few that his eight souls were saved
[1:19:35] by water he said the like figure wherein
[1:19:37] to even baptism does also now save us
[1:19:41] he said not to putting away the filth of
[1:19:42] the flesh because in the old testament
[1:19:45] realm
[1:19:46] ceremonial washings was to wash yourself
[1:19:49] from filth of the flesh from literal
[1:19:51] dirt
[1:19:53] right that's what it was to wash
[1:19:54] yourself from to make yourself clean you
[1:19:56] watched before you come and offer the
[1:19:58] sacrifice the priest had to wash but he
[1:20:00] said that's not what this is
[1:20:03] not the putting away of literal dirt but
[1:20:05] the answer of a good conscience toward
[1:20:07] god
[1:20:08] right by the resurrection i love that by
[1:20:11] the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:20:14] amen so we're speaking of his
[1:20:16] resurrection we're saying lord i'm going
[1:20:17] to be buried with you so i can be raised
[1:20:20] with you
[1:20:21] and i realize that the water itself
[1:20:22] doesn't save me but i can be raised yes
[1:20:25] aren't you glad you can be raised today
[1:20:28] in the newness of life listen he said
[1:20:30] who has gone into heaven is on the right
[1:20:31] hand of god angels and authorities and
[1:20:33] powers being made subject unto him
[1:20:36] amen then the powers and angels and
[1:20:37] authorities are subject to unto him let
[1:20:39] me be subject unto him
[1:20:41] is that your desire today church i don't
[1:20:43] want to be a law to myself i don't want
[1:20:45] to be the one that makes all the rules i
[1:20:47] want to be subject to christ and who is
[1:20:49] he he is the word he said in the
[1:20:50] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:20:52] christ
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:57] jesus baptism was essential and he was
[1:21:00] baptized by john
[1:21:02] and john's baptism was even essential
[1:21:05] because if they did not receive it they
[1:21:06] would not receive christ luke chapter 7
[1:21:09] speaks of that and i'm going to have to
[1:21:10] skip past some of this to save time this
[1:21:12] morning
[1:21:13] but he talks about how that john came
[1:21:16] and if you go on down he said for i say
[1:21:17] unto you among those that are born of
[1:21:19] women there's not a greater prophet than
[1:21:21] john the baptist
[1:21:22] he that is least in the kingdom of god
[1:21:24] is greater than he
[1:21:25] and all the people that heard him and
[1:21:27] the publicans justified god being
[1:21:29] baptized with the baptism of john so
[1:21:31] those that were baptized who yielded
[1:21:33] themselves to john's message could hear
[1:21:35] the message of christ
[1:21:38] right but the pharisees and the lawyers
[1:21:39] rejected the counsel of god against
[1:21:42] themselves why yes they were not
[1:21:44] baptized
[1:21:47] think about it just the act the fact
[1:21:49] that they had the baptism itself didn't
[1:21:51] do it but the fact that they've yielded
[1:21:53] themselves to john's message
[1:21:55] meant that they would believe jesus
[1:21:56] message
[1:21:57] all of them there were some that
[1:21:58] believed john didn't believe in christ
[1:22:00] but if they had yielded themselves if
[1:22:02] they were a seed of god that would yield
[1:22:04] themselves
[1:22:05] again
[1:22:06] oh my that's the christian life now
[1:22:09] peter tells us to repent and be baptized
[1:22:11] we read that in preparation for the
[1:22:12] coming the holy ghost
[1:22:15] and if you receive the holy ghost you
[1:22:16] can receive the holy ghost without being
[1:22:18] baptized by the way because they did
[1:22:20] in cornelius house they received the
[1:22:22] holy ghost but they were quickly
[1:22:24] baptized
[1:22:25] and and when the eunuch stood there or
[1:22:28] was there with philip riding in the
[1:22:29] chariot and philip joined himself to the
[1:22:31] chariot and the eunuch he's explaining
[1:22:33] to him isaiah 53 who is this man he's
[1:22:35] talking about and as soon as he gets the
[1:22:37] revelation of who jesus is oh that's
[1:22:39] what we need today we need a revelation
[1:22:41] of who he is he's not just another man
[1:22:44] but he was god in flesh who was
[1:22:46] crucified for us
[1:22:48] and he died for my sins and when he got
[1:22:50] that revelation he said here is water
[1:22:52] what does hinder me from being baptized
[1:22:56] when should a person be baptized
[1:22:59] now
[1:23:00] again there's many denominations groups
[1:23:02] that do it as children or as babies
[1:23:05] the bible tells us that we should be
[1:23:06] baptized when we were convicted of sin
[1:23:10] acts chapter 2 and verse 37 when they
[1:23:12] had heard this they were pricked in
[1:23:13] their heart
[1:23:14] they were convicted
[1:23:16] they heard the word and they said
[1:23:17] they said i i feel like that's what i
[1:23:20] need to do
[1:23:21] i realize that i'm a sinner yes and they
[1:23:23] said what shall we do
[1:23:25] and peter said repent and be baptized
[1:23:27] our responsibility is to preach the word
[1:23:30] the bible said as many as believe was
[1:23:32] baptized repent be baptized in the name
[1:23:33] of jesus christ for the remission
[1:23:35] forgiveness of sins
[1:23:36] he said in that you shall then receive
[1:23:37] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:23:40] now but we're not to persuade and pull
[1:23:41] and scare people and talk people into it
[1:23:44] he said people must come sanely soberly
[1:23:46] under conviction and receive christ he
[1:23:49] said then the first thing they do as
[1:23:50] soon as they receive christ sitting in
[1:23:52] their seats he said the next thing is to
[1:23:54] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:23:56] for the remission of those sins that
[1:23:57] they have been convinced that they are
[1:23:59] wrong
[1:24:00] he said that's how they were a minute of
[1:24:01] their sins see because they have
[1:24:02] repented
[1:24:04] so when should we be baptized when you
[1:24:05] feel that conviction
[1:24:07] to repent
[1:24:08] he said because they have repented been
[1:24:10] baptized as a memorial to the people
[1:24:12] that i have received christ as my
[1:24:13] personal savior
[1:24:15] then that makes you a candidate for the
[1:24:16] holy ghost so when you have repented
[1:24:18] when you should be baptized you felt
[1:24:20] conviction you have repented baptism is
[1:24:22] not repentance but it's a sign of
[1:24:25] repentance luke chapter 24 and verse
[1:24:29] he 46
[1:24:29] it said unto them thus it is written
[1:24:31] thus it behooves christ to suffer and to
[1:24:33] rise from the dead the third day that
[1:24:34] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:24:36] be preached
[1:24:38] in acts 3 and 19 it says repent ye
[1:24:40] therefore and be converted that your
[1:24:42] sins may be blotted out what a wonderful
[1:24:44] scripture he said when the times of
[1:24:46] refreshing shall come from the presence
[1:24:48] of the lord that when you feel that
[1:24:50] presence of god that there'll be
[1:24:51] something in your heart that you say
[1:24:53] lord i'm sorry and that's what all it
[1:24:55] takes yes sir that's right
[1:24:57] you're trying to work yourself back up
[1:24:59] into favor with god no you have favor
[1:25:01] with god you yield yourself to god he
[1:25:04] said but i don't know everything yet it
[1:25:06] doesn't matter yield to what you do know
[1:25:08] yes
[1:25:09] walk with christ walketh him into death
[1:25:11] walk with him into the burial walk with
[1:25:13] him into baptism walk with him to go
[1:25:15] into church walk with him when you go to
[1:25:17] school walk with him whatever you do
[1:25:19] when you find something you're not doing
[1:25:21] that's the word says to do you do it
[1:25:22] when you find something you're doing
[1:25:23] that the word says don't do you don't do
[1:25:25] it anymore
[1:25:27] why you're walking with him
[1:25:29] you're following him you're yielding
[1:25:30] yourself to him you've repented of your
[1:25:32] sins repent and be converted that your
[1:25:34] sins may be blotted out oh i need this
[1:25:37] my sins blotted out don't you
[1:25:40] then repent and be converted
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:45] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:25:46] from the presence of the lord
[1:25:48] when should you be baptized when you
[1:25:50] understand what you're doing
[1:25:53] and this is where it gets with with
[1:25:55] children infants don't understand what
[1:25:56] they're doing
[1:25:58] a person
[1:25:59] no they may not have a great
[1:26:00] understanding
[1:26:02] but they need to have an understanding
[1:26:03] and your parents know i would be careful
[1:26:06] about rejecting baptism because you
[1:26:08] don't know if that'll ever move on their
[1:26:09] heart again that's right
[1:26:11] and a person can be re-baptized like i
[1:26:12] said if they realize they weren't as
[1:26:14] serious as they should have been
[1:26:16] and yet we need to make sure they
[1:26:18] understand what baptism is
[1:26:21] they need to understand that jesus died
[1:26:23] for their sins
[1:26:25] they need to understand that they are a
[1:26:26] sinner
[1:26:27] when they're old enough to understand
[1:26:29] that they're old enough to be baptized
[1:26:31] yes
[1:26:32] a person who does not understand is not
[1:26:33] accountable for sin you understand that
[1:26:36] if a person was mentally incapable of
[1:26:39] understanding
[1:26:40] a person is not accountable for sin
[1:26:43] at all
[1:26:46] every
[1:26:48] you think the blood of jesus was just
[1:26:50] for us
[1:26:54] you think about the grace of god
[1:26:56] you take somebody who's
[1:26:58] who's never maybe reached
[1:27:00] an age of accountability because their
[1:27:02] mind's been limited because they were
[1:27:04] born maybe in a certain way and the
[1:27:05] healing never comes and they they remain
[1:27:07] in that state they never sinned
[1:27:11] but they were born in sin yes they were
[1:27:12] but the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:22] babies don't go to hell
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:26] you think heaven is going to be under
[1:27:27] populated
[1:27:32] think about it for a minute you said
[1:27:33] well there won't be room i bet you he's
[1:27:34] got room
[1:27:40] you know i've always as a father i
[1:27:41] always wanted to have room for my kids
[1:27:42] but jeremy i always wanted to have a big
[1:27:43] enough house i always like to have room
[1:27:46] and there were times it was a little
[1:27:47] cramped
[1:27:48] but i always wanted to have a room of
[1:27:49] their home i could stay in because i
[1:27:51] always had to stay with joel or somebody
[1:27:52] else growing up
[1:27:56] i always wanted to have a room of their
[1:27:57] own
[1:27:59] jesus has room
[1:28:03] if i if just in my natural i would work
[1:28:05] and do everything i can to make sure my
[1:28:06] kids have enough room
[1:28:08] what about him
[1:28:10] there will be room
[1:28:13] but there'll be thousands millions
[1:28:16] that have died that that never knew and
[1:28:19] even those who died without any
[1:28:21] knowledge maybe you say well there's
[1:28:22] hedonists that die i have no knowledge
[1:28:24] but even they can be convicted of sin
[1:28:27] and they'll be raised in the in the
[1:28:28] general resurrection and be dealt with
[1:28:30] in that way there will be people yes sir
[1:28:33] who saw you on the side of the road
[1:28:38] all right and stop to see if you're okay
[1:28:44] and they'll get there on that day
[1:28:45] they'll raise up in their whole vile
[1:28:47] body with their sins on them
[1:28:49] and they'll stand there on that that's
[1:28:50] what the scripture said he when he
[1:28:52] separated the sheep from the ghosts
[1:28:54] and the grace and the mercy of god will
[1:28:55] be so great at that time
[1:29:00] because they give a cup of water
[1:29:03] and they didn't know any better
[1:29:07] he said come enter into the joys of the
[1:29:09] lord yes sir
[1:29:10] yes sir lord when did we know that you
[1:29:12] were hungry and thirsty
[1:29:14] yeah he said as you've done it to the
[1:29:16] least of my disciples
[1:29:17] you've done it unto me
[1:29:19] god's got room
[1:29:21] the blood of jesus christ atones first
[1:29:23] time but listen to me this morning if
[1:29:24] you're here this morning you're able to
[1:29:26] hear the gospel message
[1:29:28] if you're able to hear that grace wants
[1:29:30] to do more for you
[1:29:32] than just where you make it into heaven
[1:29:35] but that grace wants to reach down into
[1:29:37] the condition where you're at into the
[1:29:39] place where you are and it wants to pull
[1:29:41] you up out of sin it wants to reach down
[1:29:43] and grab a hold of who you are grab
[1:29:45] ahold of everything that's gone wrong
[1:29:47] and all the all the doubts and the fears
[1:29:49] of life and pull you up in the newness
[1:29:51] of life that same grace that atones for
[1:29:54] the baby wants to make you a new
[1:29:56] creature in christ
[1:29:58] because you've heard yes
[1:30:00] the gospel
[1:30:02] now what what do we do we just follow
[1:30:04] that
[1:30:05] you know i don't follow christ because
[1:30:07] i'm afraid i'll go to hell
[1:30:09] i follow christ because of his
[1:30:11] overwhelming
[1:30:12] love
[1:30:15] yes i'm just standing there brother gabe
[1:30:17] and it just
[1:30:18] it just
[1:30:19] overwhelms me yeah
[1:30:21] i can't do anything else but follow
[1:30:23] christ
[1:30:24] and the scriptures make me wise to that
[1:30:26] as the scripture said it makes me wise
[1:30:28] to salvation the scripture show me he
[1:30:29] said well the scriptures aren't right
[1:30:31] but the scriptures show me the love of
[1:30:32] god yes amen
[1:30:36] that's right
[1:30:37] i might have to get past some things but
[1:30:38] we'll close in a moment
[1:30:40] notice
[1:30:42] we don't find a scripture where they do
[1:30:44] infant baptism
[1:30:45] baptism is a confession that an inward
[1:30:47] work of grace has been done
[1:30:49] little infants has no knowledge of sin
[1:30:51] and when jesus died at the cross he took
[1:30:53] away the sin of the world so when the
[1:30:54] baby becomes a human being and born into
[1:30:56] the world they have no sin of their own
[1:30:58] therefore they have no repentance to be
[1:30:59] done
[1:31:00] the blood of jesus christ takes away
[1:31:03] sin but when he i'm skipping through i'm
[1:31:05] sorry to those that are following me in
[1:31:06] the back he said but there
[1:31:08] he said you come into the world speaking
[1:31:10] lives sinners by nature but the blood of
[1:31:11] jesus christ atones for that but when
[1:31:13] the baby comes to the age of
[1:31:14] accountability it knows what's right and
[1:31:16] wrong then it has to repent for what it
[1:31:18] is done
[1:31:19] it's sin now it's just a sin just like
[1:31:21] it's born in sin it's a human sin the
[1:31:23] sin now is the sin that adam and eve did
[1:31:25] that was omitted by god by the blood of
[1:31:27] jesus christ he said now the baby has no
[1:31:29] sins to repent from until he sins
[1:31:31] then he's got to repent and when he
[1:31:33] repents then is the time to be baptized
[1:31:38] hallelujah yes sir he's baptized by
[1:31:40] immersing
[1:31:41] what follows baptism sanctification
[1:31:43] follows baptism
[1:31:46] the scripture said he gave himself he
[1:31:47] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:31:49] that he might sanctify it
[1:31:51] he doesn't want to leave us in our
[1:31:53] filthy garments in our old ways he wants
[1:31:55] to sanctify us
[1:31:57] preaching to the church now that's an
[1:31:58] ongoing process yes
[1:32:01] right
[1:32:02] an ongoing process you continue to walk
[1:32:04] in sanctification if your mouth is not
[1:32:06] as sanctified as it should be you need
[1:32:08] to be washed by the waters of the word
[1:32:11] if your walk is not as sanctified as it
[1:32:13] should be maybe you should find a place
[1:32:14] of repentance a place of sanctification
[1:32:17] let the word wash you
[1:32:20] he wants to present it to himself a
[1:32:22] glorious church that's an ongoing
[1:32:24] process you've got to stand in the water
[1:32:26] and be washed by the word notice brother
[1:32:28] branham taught us that your first
[1:32:29] wedding was annulled he said you've
[1:32:31] never done it in the first place because
[1:32:33] there's only one thing to do it that
[1:32:34] would be god come down himself and took
[1:32:36] your place in the form of the son of god
[1:32:38] jesus christ and wash you by the water
[1:32:41] by the washing of the water by the word
[1:32:43] the word not the denomination the word
[1:32:45] washed you but if you won't stand in the
[1:32:47] water of the word how you're going to be
[1:32:48] washed follow him into repentance and
[1:32:50] then follow him into sanctification
[1:32:54] stand and be washed in the word and that
[1:32:56] continues all through your christian
[1:32:58] walk yes
[1:32:59] that alone isn't enough you've got to be
[1:33:01] filled with the holy ghost
[1:33:03] brother branham taught us that full
[1:33:04] obedience to the full word of god
[1:33:05] entitles us to the token you see how it
[1:33:07] begins with baptism
[1:33:09] you're obedient to baptism you're
[1:33:11] obedient to the things you know to do
[1:33:13] that's all you can do you can't save
[1:33:14] yourself
[1:33:15] but you can be identified with the death
[1:33:17] burial and resurrection of christ and
[1:33:19] when you're identified in baptism then
[1:33:20] you can be raised with him in newness of
[1:33:22] life
[1:33:23] but that's obedience to the word it's
[1:33:25] better to obey than to sacrifice
[1:33:28] how it's better to obey than to beat
[1:33:30] yourself up
[1:33:34] i'm just being honest with you today you
[1:33:36] can beat yourself up all the rest of
[1:33:37] your life won't do you any good
[1:33:39] better to obey god
[1:33:41] come under come under headship of christ
[1:33:43] the word
[1:33:44] just obey god do what god says
[1:33:47] god says i should be in church better to
[1:33:48] obey than to beat myself up
[1:33:51] god says i should wash i should be
[1:33:53] baptized then i should be baptized god
[1:33:55] says i should pay my tithes i'll pay my
[1:33:57] eyes god says i should do these things
[1:33:59] i'll do it
[1:34:01] not because somebody needs it
[1:34:03] not because we have a building program
[1:34:04] and we pull money out of you but because
[1:34:06] god said so
[1:34:08] whatever god says that's what we do
[1:34:11] right yes and he said you must be born
[1:34:13] again that don't mean jump up and down
[1:34:14] at the altar don't mean walk back there
[1:34:16] and shake hands with the pastor i don't
[1:34:17] mean all this foolishness we've seen
[1:34:19] done it means it don't mean putting your
[1:34:20] name on a church book it means death to
[1:34:22] your first being life to the second man
[1:34:25] means the blood has been applied you're
[1:34:27] identified by the life of jesus christ
[1:34:29] and if he is the vine we are the
[1:34:30] branches the life that's in the branch
[1:34:32] he said also from the vine it'll bear
[1:34:33] the fruit
[1:34:35] listen he will not leave you
[1:34:37] yes
[1:34:39] that's such a powerful scripture where
[1:34:40] david says he will not leave my soul in
[1:34:43] hell i will not suffer my holy one to
[1:34:45] see corruption
[1:34:46] he will not leave you in dead trespasses
[1:34:48] and sins if you are faithful and come to
[1:34:50] him in baptism and surrender yourself
[1:34:52] completely to him the promise is to you
[1:34:55] and your children and to them that are
[1:34:56] far off he will fill you with the holy
[1:34:58] ghost if you have died for your first
[1:35:01] being he is faithful to do that that
[1:35:03] will never stop yeah that will never
[1:35:06] stop don't you see why the satan wants
[1:35:08] to take away baptism from us don't you
[1:35:10] see why he wants to take away communion
[1:35:12] from us he wants to take away foot
[1:35:13] washing he wants to take away get to
[1:35:15] gathering together and the hour that we
[1:35:17] live in he wants to take that away from
[1:35:19] us because that's what when we do that
[1:35:21] we're being obedient to god and when we
[1:35:23] come together listen they were obedient
[1:35:25] to god to come into the upper room he
[1:35:27] said tear you in jerusalem and when they
[1:35:29] did the holy ghost fell on them and when
[1:35:31] you come in obedience to god listen if
[1:35:33] you're here this morning and you're
[1:35:34] suffering with something and there's
[1:35:36] some kind of sickness in your body
[1:35:37] you've come in obedience to god then you
[1:35:39] can receive your healing today this is
[1:35:42] the time when it comes when you're being
[1:35:43] obedient to the word
[1:35:46] amen
[1:35:47] i wish i had more
[1:35:48] a voice to preach this morning
[1:35:51] are you hearing me today yes are you
[1:35:53] hearing the word today
[1:35:57] he will not leave you in the grave of
[1:35:58] dead trespasses and sins i'm so glad for
[1:36:00] that
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:03] he did not leave me where he found me
[1:36:06] he raised me up
[1:36:09] listen young people children some of you
[1:36:11] been baptized some of you are about to
[1:36:13] be baptized
[1:36:15] he will not leave you where you are
[1:36:17] he will raise you up all through your
[1:36:18] life yes you promised to do that he
[1:36:20] promised he would be there to help you
[1:36:22] now what do you do you follow him that's
[1:36:25] called discipleship you become his
[1:36:27] disciple
[1:36:28] you follow him as a disciple acts
[1:36:30] chapter 2 and verse 41 they that gladly
[1:36:33] received his word were baptized
[1:36:35] in the same day they were added unto
[1:36:36] them about 3 000 souls they continued
[1:36:39] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[1:36:41] fellowship and breaking a bread and in
[1:36:43] prayers and fear come upon every soul in
[1:36:45] many wonders and signs were done by the
[1:36:47] apostles why because they believed the
[1:36:49] word yes
[1:36:50] listen if we believe the word today
[1:36:52] we're going to go to church
[1:36:54] if we believe the word we're going to
[1:36:55] follow him to church yes if we believe
[1:36:57] the word we're going to follow him to
[1:36:58] baptism if we believe the word we're
[1:37:00] going to follow him through these
[1:37:01] ordinances that have been laid out and
[1:37:03] to fellowship with him beyond just the
[1:37:05] ordinances to a communion with him
[1:37:08] brother branham said if god is in your
[1:37:09] heart that's what we need today god in
[1:37:11] our heart you can't hardly wait for them
[1:37:13] doors to open out yonder to get in here
[1:37:15] to fellowship with your brothers
[1:37:16] if you don't feel that way i tell you he
[1:37:18] said it's time you got to pray
[1:37:23] you said brother ben this has been so
[1:37:24] simple this morning i understood all of
[1:37:26] this
[1:37:28] i think it's something mark twain said
[1:37:29] one time he said it ain't those parts of
[1:37:30] the bible that i can't understand that
[1:37:32] bothers me it's the parts i do
[1:37:34] understand
[1:37:39] i don't know what stage you are in the
[1:37:40] journey today
[1:37:43] but if you follow him to baptism
[1:37:46] it gives me hope that you'll follow him
[1:37:49] to the holy ghost yes
[1:37:51] follow him to the holy ghost and i see
[1:37:52] you taking communion
[1:37:54] with the saints and washing feet it
[1:37:55] gives me hope
[1:37:57] then that why we feel so good when our
[1:37:59] kids get baptized
[1:38:00] it gives us hope they're following
[1:38:01] christ
[1:38:03] and if they follow me they might mess up
[1:38:05] if they follow me they could find an
[1:38:07] example that would be imperfect although
[1:38:09] i strive to walk with god
[1:38:10] but if they follow me it would be an
[1:38:12] example that would be imperfect but if
[1:38:13] they could follow christ yes if i could
[1:38:16] ever point them to that one that they
[1:38:17] could be led by they could be led all
[1:38:19] through their life and then it wouldn't
[1:38:20] matter what happened it wouldn't matter
[1:38:23] if they were disappointed it wouldn't
[1:38:25] matter if church turned against them if
[1:38:27] people turned against them if if people
[1:38:29] were unfaithful if people didn't do what
[1:38:31] they were supposed to do see all that
[1:38:33] will matter unless they're following
[1:38:34] christ but if they follow christ
[1:38:37] they'll make it good
[1:38:40] why don't you follow into death burial
[1:38:42] and resurrection walk with him
[1:38:45] in newness of life
[1:38:48] let's power heads together
[1:38:50] i wonder if we could
[1:38:52] just make this a statement where he
[1:38:53] leads me
[1:38:55] i will follow
[1:38:57] i don't know if we even know
[1:38:59] the words or the
[1:39:01] tune to that
[1:39:03] where he leads me i will follow
[1:39:05] follow all the way
[1:39:07] where he leaves me
[1:39:11] [Music]
[1:39:23] just while you're talking to him from
[1:39:25] where he leads
[1:39:28] me
[1:39:29] i
[1:39:31] will
[1:39:32] fall
[1:39:35] i'll go with him
[1:39:38] with
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:45] and she plays that
[1:39:48] heavenly father
[1:39:51] lord i believe that people have listened
[1:39:52] today and it's been broken up and i know
[1:39:55] i haven't done
[1:39:56] as good a job as i could have
[1:39:59] i'm sorry for that lord
[1:40:02] but lord i i believe your word is true
[1:40:04] and it's powerful
[1:40:06] sharper quicker than any two-edged sword
[1:40:10] as i stand here
[1:40:12] lord even annoyed at myself because
[1:40:14] there's it could be said in so much a
[1:40:16] better way
[1:40:18] and yet overwhelmed by the grace and the
[1:40:20] truth of it
[1:40:22] lord to know that your blood atones for
[1:40:24] all my sin
[1:40:27] all of my children
[1:40:29] all of these young people that are
[1:40:31] gathered here for all of these older
[1:40:33] people maybe
[1:40:34] someone who's been lord in rebellion
[1:40:37] against god for many years
[1:40:40] but yet
[1:40:41] you're bidding to them today and
[1:40:44] beckoning to them to come and follow
[1:40:47] follow all the way
[1:40:49] the old man is dead it doesn't matter
[1:40:51] what was done in the old life
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:53] what matters is the one that walks and
[1:40:55] how we walk in newness of life
[1:40:58] i pray lord that you'd help us to follow
[1:41:00] you
[1:41:01] lord as a pastor may i follow you and
[1:41:04] into lord whatever you would have me to
[1:41:05] say
[1:41:07] lord as the people may they follow you
[1:41:10] into
[1:41:11] new life
[1:41:12] and they follow you into loving one
[1:41:14] another
[1:41:15] follow you into fellowship with the
[1:41:16] church follow you into forgiveness lord
[1:41:20] follow you into the newness of life
[1:41:23] only your spirit can give us
[1:41:26] i pray that that would be so today
[1:41:28] lord if there's people maybe perhaps
[1:41:30] here that have not been baptized that i
[1:41:33] pray you'd convict them of sin today
[1:41:35] lord that maybe maybe you've done a work
[1:41:37] in their life repentance but
[1:41:39] realize that next step is to be
[1:41:41] baptizing christian baptism i pray that
[1:41:43] they would go quickly to the water lord
[1:41:46] i know it won't be by my own efforts but
[1:41:48] according to your word
[1:41:49] or maybe convicted today by the work of
[1:41:51] the holy spirit
[1:41:53] or if there's one maybe that's refused
[1:41:55] to take communion or
[1:41:57] or to wash feet i pray you can victim of
[1:41:59] that lord order that they'd come
[1:42:01] together with the people of god
[1:42:03] lord though we're all sinners
[1:42:06] lord we need to walk together
[1:42:08] and do the things you promised and you
[1:42:10] told us to do
[1:42:11] we'll be happy if we do those things we
[1:42:13] thank you for that lord
[1:42:14] i pray you to help us as a church to do
[1:42:16] the simple things right
[1:42:18] do what we can do lord
[1:42:21] knowing that you'll pick up the slack
[1:42:22] you'll do
[1:42:23] art if we yield our members to you you
[1:42:26] will do exceedingly and abundantly above
[1:42:28] what we can ask our thing i pray you
[1:42:30] granted today
[1:42:32] lord as we go
[1:42:33] worship just for a moment and go into
[1:42:34] the baptismal service lord i
[1:42:37] pray that your spirit would continue to
