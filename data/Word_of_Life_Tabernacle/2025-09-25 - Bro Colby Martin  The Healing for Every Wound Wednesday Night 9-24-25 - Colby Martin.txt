For the martyr's bench will have no place at all. There will never be a servant preached to sinners. For the sinner had refused to heed the call. There will be no mourning over wayward love ones.

So, just continue to remember those we have been praying for and the WhatsApp prayer request. Amen. Sure. Good to have brother Colby and Sister Mary Martin and the family with us here tonight. Amen. Looking forward to what the Lord has for us, aren't we, this evening? Amen. If you haven't eat on your heart, would you just make it known by an uplifted hand? We're going to have Brother David take these needs to the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just come before you this evening, Lord. Just thanking you for your blessings, Lord, and your love unto us. Thank you for another time to gather together, Lord, out of the rain, Lord, and under the roof, Lord, to speak, hear you speak to us, Lord. Just looking forward to the service tonight, Lord.

Oh, so count the years as months. Oh, and count the months as weeks. Oh, just count the weeks as days. Any day now we'll be going home. If you believe that, can you give the Lord a big hand clap of praise here tonight? [Applause] [Music] In the beginning of time, he was the creator. [Music] In into existence he spoke the heavenly blue. And with one mighty swoop of his hand, he threw out the stars. He knew where they'd land. So if you think you're just drifting along, then I have good news. If he on the moon, I know he will help you. And if he holds a spare and flight, he'll hold you, too. Consider the liies of the field. how much more he loves you. [Music] In the beginning of time, you were on his mind when he hung the moon. [Music] And now you may feel like the world lays hard on your shoulders. And even your closest friend in life is pulling away. And though you have tried so hard and lost, there is still hope. Just look to the cross. There you will see just how much the Savior really loves you today. And if he [Music] know he will help you. [Music] And if he holds a spare in flight, then he'll hold you, too. Just consider the liies of the field. How much more he loves you. [Music] In the beginning of time, you were on his mind. When he hung the moon in the beginning of time, you were on his mind when he hung the moon. [Music] [Applause] Hey man, how many enjoyed that special here tonight? If he hung the moon, tell you what, if he if he knows every little sparrow and every hair on your head, it's easier on some than others, but some of us it takes a long time to count the hairs on your head. And uh Amen. And aren't you glad he knows everything about us and he cares about it? Cares about every little thing and every big thing. Let's stand together. I've kind of want to change these last couple songs up and wake everybody up for a minute if we can. Well, some glad morning. When this life is over, I I'll fly away to home on God's celestial shore. I'm going to fly away. We're singing. Fly away. Fly away. Oh, I rise. Hallelujah. By and by. Oh yes. I I'll fly away. Oh, and when the shadows of this life grow out, I'll fly away. Oh, like a bird from prison. Mars is flat. Oh, I rise. Hallelujah. Bye-bye. Oh, I fly away. Oh, and just a few more weary days of me. I go fly away. Oh, to a land where joy shall never end. I going to fly. Clap your hands and sing it now. Sing it away. I'll fly away. Oh, I fly away. Well, there can't nobody to be like Jesus. Oh, nobody to be like the Lord. Well, there can't nobody be like Jesus. Cuz he's mine. Can't nobody love me like Jesus. Can't. Nobody love me like Jesus. Nobody love me like the Lord. Well, there nobody love me like Jesus cuz he's mine. Did he hear your body? Well, he healed my body. Told me to run on. He healed my body. Told me to run on. When he healed my body, told me to run on peace. Singing like this. Can't nobody love me. Well, there can't nobody love me like Jesus. Love me like the Lord. Well, there nobody love me like Jesus. He's my friend. Well, there can't nobody clap your hands and sing it now. Do me like Jesus. Can't nobody do me like the Lord. Well, they can't. Oh, do me like Jesus. He's my friend. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise tonight. Amen. as we turn to our pastor. Well, I sing because I'm happy. Oh yes, I sing because I am free. Yes, I'm free. Well, his eye is on the sparrow and I know I know he watches over me. Oh yes, I sing because I'm happy. Oh, I see [Applause] [Music] me. Sing it again. Laugh while you sing it. Oh, I sing because I'm so happy. Oh, I sing because Oh, I'm free. Yes, I'm free. Oh, his eyes is on the sparrow. Yes, I know. I know he watches me. Aren't you glad he watches you today? Aren't you glad his eyes on the sparrow? Jesus said, "Are you not worth many sparrows?" Amen. Amen. Much more than the sparrow. You're a son and a daughter of God or a daughter of God. So thankful for that tonight. Uh it's our privilege tonight to have brother Kobe Martin with us and his family, Sister Mary and the family. God bless you. most of the families here tonight and good to have you. And uh brother Kobe's going to preach for us. They might sing or whatever that they feel on their heart. So we're just going to let the Lord lead tonight and just not get in a hurry. Uh brother Kobe hasn't been here in probably almost 5 years and uh man, I didn't realize it had been that long to speak for us. He's been here in the meetings, been such a wonderful help to us in that. But we uh we sure appreciate having him this Sunday morning. Uh, I'm going to go to the meetings in Galina on th tomorrow tomorrow and we'll be up there Friday and Saturday. I know some of y'all are going too. Um, they're going to have service on Sunday, but I'm going to come back here. Brother Stewart's going to be preaching. We've got a baptism Sunday morning. So, if you know anybody that needs to be baptized, we'll have water in the tank. And so, we that happened last year, too. This same weekend, if you remember, Brother Paul was baptized last year. So, we just thank the Lord for that. and but we're looking forward to that. But I I'm going to come and then probably head back up towards uh Branson for a couple days and then be back on Wednesday night. But we sure uh love each and every one of you and uh and we just want to see the Lord do whatever needs to be done tonight. Whatever need that you might have, he's able to meet it. Do you believe that tonight? He said, "Well, it's a Wednesday night, but he's still God. He's just as much God on Wednesday night as he ever was any other day of the week. Amen. God bless you. Amen. As brother Kobe comes, let's sing. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my cup, Lord. Could you just close your eyes and raise your hands to him? Did I Lord? Won't you come and quench this thirsting of my soul? Granny Lord on bread of heaven. Won't you feed me till I want know? I appreciate you coming. Amen. Fill it up. Make me whole. Sing it once again now. Oh, here's my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. [Music] Oh bread of heaven. Feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Heavenly Father, that's our desire tonight. Lord, I believe everyone from the youngest to the oldest, Lord, can say, "Father, here's our cup." And Lord, we need filled and refilled every day, Lord. And I pray tonight, Father, we may be weary in body and mind, Lord, and we we may have come through a battle, Lord, just getting here. And God, I pray that you touch every heart tonight, Lord. Lift up the feeble hands, Lord. Anyone that's maybe fighting discouragement tonight, Father, I pray that you uplift their hands, Lord. Encourage each one, Father. The all the faithful that has come out tonight. I pray that you just you bless them abundantly, Lord, is our prayer. We love you, Lord, and we're thanking you for all that you've done and you're going to do for us. In your precious name, we pray. Amen. And amen. Do you love the Lord here tonight? Amen. I'd like to say it's it is an honor to to be here. Um it has been about I guess about five years. Brother Joel did remind me. He's like, "When you came last time, you were wearing the same suit." And I was, it is the same suit, but this is a bigger size. I was smaller back then. So, but yeah, it it it definitely is an honor to be here. We we love every one of y'all and consider this our our second family. So, we're honored honored to be here and like to say it is good to have my family with me. I we were at brother Jason Jackson's uh Sunday and they weren't able to be there. And I tell you, it's a big difference when your family's not there. She's my my number one uh amen corner. And honestly, I I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for my wife. And and I say that everywhere I go, but I I truly mean that. She's a uh she's a a blessing to me and and a help. And she's she's made me into the man I am today. And I I I wouldn't have anything I got today if it wasn't for her. So, I I'm very grateful to have them with us. and I am going to have them sing, but it's going to be after the service. So, I hope that's okay here tonight. And but if I appreciate your musicians, your song leader. Um, but if we can turn to Psalms 103 and verse one and Psalms 103 and verse one, Brother Brandham says here, he says, "When I see the angel take his chair and maybe and and lean back toward his tent and Sarah listening through the tent, you know, kindly easedropping, you know, and listening through the tent, she was kind of in an awful mood that morning. You don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood. you just you there's no need of trying. He says you just might as well stay home. You won't get nothing anyway. But when you come to church, come prayed up. Come in the atmosphere and come expecting. And I pray that you've come expecting here tonight. And um but Psalms 103 and verse verse one. It says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all of his benefits. Who forgiveth all of thy iniquities, and who healeth all of thy diseases. We can also stay in the same book of Psalms and turn to verse or chapter 147 and verse three. When you're there, say amen. says, "He he health health the broken in heart and he bindeth up their wounds." Two more passages of scripture and then I'll let you have your seats. If we can turn to Proverbs 17 and verse 22. 17 and verse 22. It says, "A merry heart doth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dryth the bones." One more passage. Jeremiah 30 and verse 17. Jeremiah 30 and verse 17. And we're just going to read half of this verse here. It says, "For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, sayaith the Lord." &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now you may be seated. and wanting to speak on a a topic that's that's very personal to me and it's it's things that I've dealt with in my life and and and in my past and back home we deal with the youth. So we're more of a of a simple preacher. So tonight you're all youth. I don't care how old you are, you're all youth tonight. I hope that's okay. in but of things I've dealt with in my life and in my past. And if I had a title, it would be the healing for every wound. And if we could take the time and go through this room, I bet everybody here has had some kind of wound on their natural body. Uh a and that wound has led to some kind of scar. I I know I've I've fallen out of trees as a kid and I've I've gotten scars along my side and uh you know maybe some of us have broken bones and maybe had stitches or um god forbid a knife wound uh maybe even a a gunshot wound. I was at brother Dave Morris's preaching over there and I and I was going along this topic. It was on my heart and and I mentioned you know maybe someone here has maybe had a gunshot wound and a lady raised her hand and said my husband twice. So, I'm like, "Wow, I that that's that's crazy." But the wounds and the healing that I want to speak on tonight, it goes beyond the physical. It it goes beyond the body down to the senses of the soul. And we know that our body has five senses. Ain't that right? See, taste, smell, hear, and touch. And brother Brandham says our soul has five senses or attributes as well. It's your imagination, your your conscience, your your memory, your your reason, and and your affection. And in these five senses, we can let things keep us from letting go or forgiving. &gt;&gt; And in the natural body, you can see the scars where someone's had an accident or or or had surgery. But for the soul and the spirit, they are not physically seen. And and these are called hidden wounds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And these wounds that they that can't be stitched or or or stapled or or or bandaged. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; These are wounds that you can't see. Ain't that right? And you know, we we like as men, we like talking about our our physical wounds and like to describe the heroic act that took place to get this broken bone or or the wound that we got, you know, for it makes us I tell my my my boys, you know, the scars, it makes you look tough. Well, my you know, I'm missing Simeon. I just realized that. Anyways, my one of my boys, he went hunting for the first time last year and he got scoped scoped right here. So, he got a scar right here. And I told him that scars, they they make you look tough. And ain't that right? Ain't that right, man? Makes you look tough. But these hidden wounds, it may it may take a split second recollection of a hidden a wound can cause pain and memories of abuse or or or ridicule or or criticism, maybe neglect, uh emotional abuse or even spiritual abuse can take place. And you say, "Brother Colby, where do you get your hidden wounds?" You can get them anywhere. &gt;&gt; You can get it from society. You can get it from family and parents a and children and brothers, your your sister, your aunt and uncle, your your your wife, your husband, your your friends, your acquaintances, church members, even a pastor &gt;&gt; can can give you hidden wounds. And one thing is for certain, everybody has had a hidden wound. And if you haven't, let me know your secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've all had at least one. You may be masking it here this tonight by by wearing a fake facade. But most of us have has had an emotional scar from somebody in the past. And there are things that you can apply to a natural scar that can give it a a a temporary covering. And people will apply makeup to cover a natural scar. And if they're looking for a more permanent situation or a solution, they'll they'll go have surgery on that imperfection that's on their body. that no matter how much you try to cover it up, there's always going to be a scar there. And people try to cover up their scars and their hurts with religion. And we can go try going to church and we can sit on a pew and and sing in the choir or help around the around the church. But the only thing that will truly take away the hurts is not how much works you can do &gt;&gt; and how busy you can be and how much you pay in tithing every day or every every service, but it's surrendering your hurts and your wounds to Jesus Christ. Man can try in their own ability to to cover it up and to mask it with a smile, but only God can take the pain. &gt;&gt; Only God can take that wound. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right, Dad? &gt;&gt; Another thing is for certain emotional wounds take longer to heal than physical wounds do. Hey, &gt;&gt; a soldier comes back from war and he has shrapnel in his body. He's he's limping and he's he's got bandages on his right arm and around his head. And they say you give him 6 to9 months. Physically he'll be okay, but emotionally the wounds from the war will be with him for a long long time. I I came across this story and it's told by the grandson's perspective. He says, "My grandfather on my mother's side fought in World War II in the South Pacific." And he says, "I remember growing up and I would stay at their house quite often and on a few occasions I remember him having nightmares of killing Japanese soldiers." That was in the 70s and the war was in the 40s. Just recently he's had one of his legs amputated. And during this time from the surgery, someone walked into his hospital room and he was hiding behind his bed, hiding from Japanese soldiers. He was in his 80s and the war was 60 years ago. So we understand that emotional scars can last a long long time. But no matter where you've got that wound and that scar and that pain, no matter the source, there is a healing here tonight for every wound. Psalms 119:81 says, "My soul faintth for thy salvation, but I hope in thy word. My my eyes failed for thy word, saying, when will thou comfort me? Psalms 34:18 says, "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, &gt;&gt; and saveest such as be of a contrite spirit." The ESV version says, "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; And he saves the crushed in spirit. So there's healing for every hurt. And he is the hope for every need tonight. He is Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide. He is Jehovah Nissi. The Lord gives victory or deliverance. He is Jehovah Shalom. The Lord is our peace. He is Jehovah Shamba, the everpresent one. And my favorite is Exodus 15. He says, "I am Jehovah Rafa," which means, "I am the God that healeth thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 147 and3 says, "He heals the broken in heart." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and he binds up every wound. So, I don't care how long you've been facing this pain in your life, God can take it away in an instant. &gt;&gt; But we got to get past our pride. And we got to be willing to let go of the pain. &gt;&gt; Let go of the hurts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, our sin situation requires a savior. But our emotional situation that we're dealing with requires a healer. &gt;&gt; It requires a healer. When we repent and are born again of water and spirit, that takes care of our sin situation. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. But what we're in need of tonight is a healing of our mind, our our will, our emotions. &gt;&gt; We need God to come down and cleanse us from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Oh my, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We can't live a fulfilling life if we can't get our healing. &gt;&gt; We can't live a true victorious life in Christ if we're still holding on to things. &gt;&gt; If we're not willing to let go and let God, you'll never have a complete breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God says, "Okay, I I forgive you in an instant, and and I've washed away your sins in a moment, and I've given you the Holy Ghost, but there's so much more that I want to give you tonight. I want to heal your hurts. I want to I want to heal those hidden wounds. I I want to give you a life that's filled with joy and peace and happiness. And too many times we let God deal with the sin part of our life, but we never let him deal with the hurts in our life. And that only leads to frustrations because we still have wounds. Yeah. All right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. These wounds, these deep scars, these hurts will rob you of a complete breakthrough if it's not dealt with. You say, "Brother Kobe, this can't happen." Brother Brandham deals with cases like this. He He begins to desert a lady in the message, the second miracle. I hope this is okay tonight. &gt;&gt; I know it's a Wednesday night, so I won't stay on this too long. &gt;&gt; But she is dealing with a nervous condition, and because of this, she's gotten cancer. And he continues to deal with her. And he tells her she's had a dog scare as a child. He says here, "But you've had some good teachings, and you've had many sorrows, too, haven't you, lady? You've had a great scare once in your life. Something seemed like when you were a school girl, and I I believe it was a dog or something like that, man. I see something bark and go or go on and you jump, you scream. You were just a child," he says. And down comes life coming down recently. He said, "You've been real nervous." Oh, yes. Here's something else moving up, sister. He's I'm sorry. Yes. I believe you know it. It's cancer. He says, "Come here for just a moment." And he begins to pray. He says, "Thou demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, come out of that woman." Do you realize once the problem was exposed, she was able to be healed. She's been dealing with this nervous condition since a child. And Satan has been hiding behind those emotions since a child. &gt;&gt; And Satan or brother Brandham pinpointed the problem saying, "You have a nervous condition because of a scare that you had as a child and she received a complete healing once that devil was exposed." &gt;&gt; He begins to tell a story about a certain lady married to a man by the name of Brother Huff. And this couple had a set of twins. And brother Brandham says, "These twins were staunch Christians." And this story is in the message and uncertain sound. He says, "One little girl going to school. She got a complex." He says, "The girls were telling her, "Hey, well, why don't you smoke like we do?" And and you think you're better than we are, and why don't you go to the dances? Now, they didn't go to do the dances, nor neither did they smoke or drink. And they made fun of, well, the healthier girl. She said, "Huh, well, let them jump in the river. I'm the one serving Christ. They don't want to just let them go." But the other one, this is where she got in trouble. She began to think, "Oh, maybe I can do something." And she built a complex and got nervous and she went insane. They had her in an institution for two years. And if I can stop here for a minute, complexes will destroy you. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Complexes will destroy you. &gt;&gt; I don't care how old you are or how young you are. &gt;&gt; We can deal with complexes in our life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll continue on with this story in just a moment here, but emotional scars of of of abuse and criticism and our past mistakes &gt;&gt; will keep us from fully experiencing who God is and what he can do. &gt;&gt; I built a complex being a a pastor's son, you you get to see the good and and the bad. &gt;&gt; You get to see a lot of the the behind the scenes that the the church members don't see. and and I built complexes in my life and I I struggled for the longest time with certain family members because of of stuff that I had had done years ago. And every time I was around them, I I wondered, do they love me? And h have they forgiven me? And I built complexes and it it affected my marriage. It affected my ministry. It affected my my Christian walk because every time I was around these individuals, I didn't know Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know what fixed it? It was me going to God and telling him my fears. &gt;&gt; And you know what's crazy? I This happened when I was 12 years old. And I struggled with this complex until I was 30 years old. &gt;&gt; And on the way back from the Ohio youth camp, the person that I wronged back when I was 12 gave me a call and he says, "Brother Kobe, I just wanted to let you know that I forgive you." Oh my. &gt;&gt; After 20 something years of wandering in my mind, let me tell you something. Complexes and pain, it's a burden. It's a weight. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm the only one that's that's dealt with this in my life. It's amazing when you expose that problem and you truly accept forgiveness for yourself, how much of a load comes off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we go so far and things are going well and then suddenly our adversary reminds us of what somebody did to us and and how that affected us. And since we're humans, how many human tonight? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not aliens, we're not robots, we're human. So we got emotions, we got feelings. Ain't that right? And and since we're human beings, we can forgive. But sometimes it's hard to forget. And because of this, things can resurface &gt;&gt; and immediately we're disappointed again and and we can't trust anybody. And we begin to question everybody's Christianity. But God is saying tonight that I can heal those hurts. &gt;&gt; I I I can bind up those wounds. I I can help you get over it. First, we must surrender our pride and say, "God, I need help. &gt;&gt; I can't do this on my own. I I I need something that's beyond my abilities &gt;&gt; and my capabilities. Oh my. You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We can come to church and I hope this is okay tonight. I know it's a little slower for a Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Good. Very good. But we can come to church and we can bask in the presence of the Lord and sometimes we can feel his presence and mistake that for healing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We allow our victory to to fall on the flesh and the spirit, man, but never down to the soul. And that's why many of us are are on roller coasters. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're good one moment and we're down the next. And we're here. We're great. We're on top of the mountain, but by Wednesday, we're back down in the valley again. It's because we're we've never allowed God to really have his perfect work in our life. Because if we truly had an experience with God and we truly have victory, then no matter the obstacle or the circumstance that we're dealing with, he gets praised in in the valley and on the mountain top. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that goes beyond the flesh and and the spirit down to the soul. It's that inner man that governs the emotions. &gt;&gt; That no matter how you're feeling, you're praising the Lord anyway. No matter if you're sick, you're still praising him for his healing. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. It's It's the roller coaster syndrome that we can get sometimes. &gt;&gt; The preachers know that's right. Preaching on a Sunday, you feel like you're sitting on cloud nine and then Monday comes around and you're down in the dumps again. &gt;&gt; Amen. I Amen. But brother Brandham continues on with this story and he's talking to this this this that twin girl in the in the insane asylum and he says, "I keep talking to her. Oh, but the grace of God, oh my." He said, "Just in a few moments, the Holy Spirit began to move in." And I said, "Margaret, you don't know me." But I said, "All your life since you've been big enough to know about boys, you've always had in your mind you're going to marry a preacher." He says, "You wanted to marry a preacher." And she smiled. He said, "That caught." C. And I said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it is over." &gt;&gt; identifying the problem. It's amazing how quick you can get your victory when that problem's identified. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Psalms 100 or Psalms 39 verse1. I found this out. You'll never get over something until you bring it to God. God knows your problems, &gt;&gt; but we have to step out and give it to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalms 39:1 says, "I said I will take heed in my to my ways that I sin not with my tongue and I will keep my mouth with a bridal while the wicked is before me. I was dumb with silence. I held my peace even from good and my soul stirth. My heart was hot within me. While I was mused and the fire burned and then I spake with my tongue." And I believe what he's saying here is is is holding on to hurt. It's like carrying coals in your heart. You're the one that's going to get burned. Is that right? And and a hidden wound when you try to stuff them down, they don't heal. They fester. &gt;&gt; And and pushing hurt aside doesn't get rid of it. It it makes it feel worse. &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; People deal with things or hurts in different ways. And some people try to forget it. And some people turn to to drinking and drugs and relationships. Some turn their back on God and question what they believe. And people do things differently, but none of them work. &gt;&gt; And somewhere it's going to have to be dealt with. If I can say this, hurt people hurt people. &gt;&gt; Hurt people hurt people. When a person is hurt so deeply, they they built that emotional raw around that area because they don't want to be hurt like that again &gt;&gt; and they put defenses around that hurt. It's called the defense mechanism. And you watch an individual and that's been hurt in the past. And you watch them, they're happy, they're sociable, they're they're lifting their hands in church and all of a sudden something triggers what they've been through in the past and all of a sudden that that person changes. Come on. &gt;&gt; Someone that was once happy is now depressed. Someone that was once a social butterfly is now a recluse. They're the pulling away from church gettogethers. If I can say this, if Satan can get you isolated, &gt;&gt; that is the worst thing for somebody that's dealing with problems in their life is to isolate yourself from the flock, from the herd. &gt;&gt; Isolation is the enemy's number one tool. [Music] Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They don't visit family anymore. When they come to church, they're no longer allowing themselves to be free in worship. &gt;&gt; And when a person is going through this, they they they something triggers in their mind. I've been there. I've done it. They run to a place that makes them feel safe for the moment. And you may run to addictions. I know I did. &gt;&gt; Run to addictions that that gives you temporary peace. Ain't that what addictions are? They they make you feel good for the moment, but they don't show you the aftermath of what these addictions can do to you. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. They don't show you what drugs can do to an individual. They don't they they make you feel good for the moment. &gt;&gt; Alcohol makes you forget the pain for a moment, but you don't see the after effect of it. If I can say this, pornography makes you feel good for the moment. &gt;&gt; But it destroys your families. It destroys your life. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; And we live in a society that wants a a temporary fix for the moment. They they want to feel good for the moment. They don't care about the consequences. &gt;&gt; They want to make themselves feel good for the moment. &gt;&gt; So, they run to a place that makes them feel safe. Drugs helps you forget your problem. Alcohol drowns it out. You run to habits. They they make you feel safe no matter the outcome. They they run to the shell but when they feel pain if I can say this. &gt;&gt; This is called a split condition. &gt;&gt; It's when you haven't fully given it to God yet. You want to move on with God and and you want to do things with God, but you still have this over here &gt;&gt; and you think, "Well, if it doesn't work out with God, well, I can go back to this." &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Having a relationship with the Lord requires us to fully trust in God. &gt;&gt; And if you don't fully trust in God, you will go back to the conditions that you do trust. &gt;&gt; Peter dealt with this split condition. He he he dealt with a rejection complex. How many people here tonight love being rejected? Wow. We all want to be accepted. We all we all want to feel good around people. And we can see how Peter he was zealous for the Lord &gt;&gt; and and Peter he loved the Lord. &gt;&gt; He makes the statement that wherever you go I will go Lord if you die I will die. &gt;&gt; But in the moment of weakness still understand that Peter is dealing with a rejection complex. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to feel rejected. He wanted to be accepted. So in a moment of weakness, &gt;&gt; come on. standing by that fire, what happens? &gt;&gt; He denies the Lord. Peter went to a condition that made him feel safe. &gt;&gt; He ran to this split condition, this other identity called Peter the fisherman that didn't know Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to be accepted. But get this. On the day of Pentecost, what happened? No longer is Peter hiding from Christ and denying Christ, but he comes out with the boldness saying this is that &gt;&gt; and courage took over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; But did that take away all of Peter's insecurities? &gt;&gt; Just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are free from hurts. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You could be saved and still have wounds and hurts that God has to deal with from your past. Amen. There's a process that a computer goes through when it crashes. It's called the rebooting process. And what it does, it refreshes all of the system memory, making it uh uh uh ready for them to start over again. It makes everything look good. It makes it look clean. But if you have a piece that's in the motherboard that's toxic, no matter how many times you reset that computer, until you change the piece in that motherboard, it will always continue to go back to its faulty settings again. &gt;&gt; So what they got to do is they got to take this computer and and and they unplug it and they get to the motherboard and you will find things in there called discs. They are called cache memories. I hope this is making sense. Once you replace the faulty piece, the computer will start working the way it's supposed to. &gt;&gt; They say the mind is like a computer. &gt;&gt; They say the average human brain has the ability to store the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes of digital memory. &gt;&gt; That's a lot. That's a lot of good. That's a lot of bad. And why is it that the bad always outweighs the good? Why is it that Satan wants to come in there? He don't come when you're strong. &gt;&gt; He comes when you're vulnerable and weak and he attacks you in your weakest moment because he ain't stupid. &gt;&gt; He knows that he can't attack you at full strength. &gt;&gt; But he waits when you when you're having a moment dealing with the kids or or or dealing with the husband. And and if I can say this, I have a lot of respect for you mothers. &gt;&gt; That's good. I know my wife seen what she deals with with four kids plus me, so five kids and a house and and everything that she has to go through. You know, I'm a I'm a person that hates redoing things twice. I hate getting a job done and having to go back and and move something. My wife says, she tells me, "At least you get a break from your job." She has to deal with the same thing over &gt;&gt; and over and over. And I I can only imagine how heavy a weight must be. &gt;&gt; I I honestly am surprised. It has to be God's grace that she hasn't broken down yet. I'm a handful. I am a handful. &gt;&gt; But it's in those moments of weakness that Satan will try to bring up something from the past and and try to trigger a pain. Even for the husbands that that has the the burdens of dealing with family and you're you have to deal with the finances and you got to be the provider and it's in those moments when nothing's working right and the bills are due and and it feels like you're all alone. &gt;&gt; Why is it it's in those moments when we have to deal with suicidal thoughts? &gt;&gt; Why is it in those moments? Hello somebody. Am I the only one in here that's had to deal with this in my life? Come on. &gt;&gt; So, we can store &gt;&gt; a lot of bad and good in our in our in our in our memories. And it's in this moment of pain, Satan, he comes in and he changed out a a good piece with a faulty. &gt;&gt; So, when you come to church and you're in the presence of the Lord, you you get the reboot that you so desperately need and you feel good and you feel clean and you're like, "Yes, I feel awesome. I I feel great." But then something triggers an emotion or a feeling or or a pain and then you're going back to that faulty setting again. And then you come back and you get rebooted only to fall back to that faulty setting again. &gt;&gt; We all need a good rebooting and a a daily a refreshing daily. Paul says, "I die daily, &gt;&gt; but we need the great physician &gt;&gt; to come perform surgery on our heart and take away that toxic piece and give us a brand new heart again." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He can take the hurts. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Do you love him tonight? But only God can refresh your heart. I know this is simple. My &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; just from my heart tonight. &gt;&gt; But if God doesn't replace that toxic peace, there will always be a signal that tells you you ain't loved. &gt;&gt; You ain't accepted. &gt;&gt; You're not wanted. &gt;&gt; You'll never be enough. You'll never be the husband that you need to be. You'll never be the father that you need to be. You'll you'll never be the mother that you need to be. You you'll never be a you're not you'll never be a a young person like you need to be. And let me tell you something. If Satan is battling you, telling you you're not good enough, that is a lie from the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; You are good enough. You are loved. I'm telling this to the young people and maybe you adults as well. But God cared so much about you that he left the splenders of heaven. Came down and died so he could redeem you back to himself again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; That ought to tell you something. That you are loved, that you are wanted, and that you have been accepted again. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to that filth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My But you must come to God with complete honesty. Say, God, I &gt;&gt; I need your help. I need your help, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I'm almost done. If not, &gt;&gt; bitterness, resentment will take over your life. Bitterness is poison. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bitterness doesn't just affect you, but it affects everyone else around you. &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, if you have a family, it will poison your spouse. It will poison your children. &gt;&gt; It will poison a church. Bitterness will destroy your life. It will choke the very joy that you have in your life. You must release bitterness. I fought bitterness. &gt;&gt; I fought bitterness being a a pastor's son and seeing the things that were said and the actions that were taken against my father. I was never involved. But somehow &gt;&gt; it caused resentment. And I always look to that individual differently. &gt;&gt; I always look through eyes of hate. I always look through eyes of bitterness. I I always look through eyes of of contentment against that person. Every time you see them, you just you want to walk the other way. You you just have such hatred toward them. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan does. He can take something so small, &gt;&gt; so insignificant that the other person might not even know they've done anything to you &gt;&gt; and it can cause it to become a major blow up. Come on now. &gt;&gt; You got to be careful. Romans says here in 12 and 2 says, "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and what is acceptable and perfect will." Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; of God. You say, "Brother Kobe, how?" First, you have to start by asking God to heal your memories. &gt;&gt; I wish I can have all the bad taken out. &gt;&gt; I wish I can go to my wife and take all the bad out that I've ever done. &gt;&gt; A lot of times, Brother Ben, I wish I wasn't an idiot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was an idiot. But you got to ask God to heal those &gt;&gt; those memories. Say, Lord, &gt;&gt; take out the bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you do it? You got to you got to start getting your mind off Fox News. And you got to start getting your mind off sports. And you got to start you got to get your mind off the things of this world and begin to read God's word a little bit more. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. and and play the message of the hour a little bit more and take those negative thoughts that you've been dealing with and replace it with more positivity. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Take those thoughts and those feelings because if it's left up to the human ability, we would never forgive. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We would never let go. We would hold it on. But God being at the center of the hill, it's him. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It's God betraying his love through you. It's not me able to forgive my neighbor or or my wife able to forgive me of of my hurts and the pain that I caused. It's God through my wife. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; If it was left up to her, she would have already left me. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. We've been married for almost 15 years. Thank God for that. But it was God that kept us together. &gt;&gt; Not my own abilities. But if I can ask this, how's your prayer life? Oh my. &gt;&gt; How's your Bible reading? &gt;&gt; If I can ask this, brother Ben, I may have to step down here a little bit, but how's your attendance to the house of God? &gt;&gt; How's your attendance to the house of God? What are you allowing in your life? Because what you allow in your life, if it's negative, it will fuel that hatred. &gt;&gt; It will fuel that pain. &gt;&gt; That's true. When you're wanting to put out a fire, you don't throw gasoline on it. &gt;&gt; You use water to get the fire out. Ain't that right? And when you're wanting to deal with things in your life, you use the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to skip through some of this here. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter who you are or or where you've been. It doesn't matter the scar. It it doesn't matter the sin. It doesn't matter how you fell. Somewhere along the way, there's healing for your life. you you can be healed of your broken heart and your bitterness and your memory and your damaged self-esteem. It can be erased here tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live a defeated life. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; My father was a good man, but he was a hard man. You know, all know my dad. &gt;&gt; Great guy. But as a a kid, he came out of Pentecost and he believed in the belt and because of it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I dealt with a lot of pain complexes. Being a pastor's kid, I had to always share my father. And you know, you pastor's kids know &gt;&gt; seemed like he was always with somebody else or always had somebody else's kid. And being a young man, always in trouble, I got hurt at a young age. And if I can just tell my testimony, I hope that's okay tonight. I got addicted to pornography at 9 years old, trying to find a a place to to run away from the hurt and the pain. And because I I didn't feel loved and I I I I didn't feel even though I was I had great parents, but when I got married, I didn't know how to love. So I I would &gt;&gt; and because of it, I couldn't love her and the pain I caused, the agony that I caused. And because I wasn't delivered from my addiction, every time I I I felt hurt, I ran back to the place I felt safe. &gt;&gt; Dealt complexes with my father. Never fell in love with him. and even get delivered from c certain things and still it the complexes affected my my ministry. It affected everything around me. And brother Ben, I I never understood why I couldn't get over it. I never understood why I couldn't find a a a a a freedom with my father. And I realized that it was something that I kept a hold of in my childhood &gt;&gt; from 9 years old being hurt. Maybe your parents were perfect. Maybe maybe you guys are perfect here tonight. But for me as a a young child, it affected me. And because of this complex, it affected every decision that I ever made &gt;&gt; through life. And it took something really major to get my attention. And making up with my father, my father didn't even realize that I was still hurt from that. didn't even realize. And when we came together and we fixed and resolved that issue, you know what happened? It took that burden off. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; It took the complexes that I was fighting in my own life with my ministry and my worship leading and different things that I've dealt with. It took the the barrier off of that. Oh my. I I wish I could get you to understand that you don't have to deal with those complexes. You don't have to be bound down with that. The addictions that you may have faced year after year after year, there's a healing for every wound here tonight. You can have those chains broken here tonight. &gt;&gt; God can take the hurt, but are you willing to give it to him? Are are you willing to say, "Lord, I release it." Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we get too content or too comfortable in the condition that we're in. We're okay with the problems that we had year after year. I don't know about you, but I got tired of carrying that weight year after year after year after year. And I had to realize that Kobe Martin needed help &gt;&gt; or I'm going to lose my family. got to the point in my life to where I was going to end my life. I was done like Laura, I can't do this. It's amazing when you let go what God can do. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. It's amazing what &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. My as my my family comes to get ready to sing. Brother Brandham says this here. Oh Christ of God, many things have happened since those days. Many have seared the conscience of people and it's caused disappointments and everything. But father, he says, I pray that you'll brush back every scar tonight &gt;&gt; and you heal every broken heart. He also says here, may it be that this place will always have miracles and signs and wonders. May the anointing of the high priest with oil, may you come to soothe every broken heart. But when our Lord puts his chains of love around your heart and he pulls you from the ditch of sin, he heals every broken heart and he takes away the sin. Oh my. No matter how bad you're cut up and how bad you're bruised, how your family has done or what you've done, there's no bill to it. He heals the heartaches and he takes away all the sorrows. [Music] &gt;&gt; I came across this story here. And it's a little lengthy, so bear with me as we're getting ready to turn it to them here tonight. Says, "Rico balanced the bowl in her tiny hand as she carried it to the kitchen. It was her mother's favorite, a a white bowl with tiny blue blossoms painstakingly painted up the sides. Her mother only brought it out on the most special occasions. Alongside the gold platter her father had created, Rico loved to run her fingers over the slightly worn edges as she listened to the stories about their family in Japan, dreaming of all the hands through which this bull had passed. Her favorite story was where God restored her family after they had been separated during the war and their joy of being reunited after being so brokenhearted it was tangible even to her. Today was her mother's birthday which Rico thought qualified as a special occasion. This 5-year-old girl I climbed the cabinets and brought out the dish all on her own. She couldn't wait to fill it with her mother's favorite treats and present it to her. Rico's foot caught on the edge of the kitchen rug and she stumbled. And the floral bowl slipped from her fingers. I crashed against the tile floor. The bowl laid in shards at her feet and wrinkles sank down to her knees. Gingerly picking up a brokenhearted piece, she began to cry. A warm hand rested upon her shoulder. Blurry through the tears, Rico saw her grandfather's wrinkled face and kind eyes staring down at her. She said, "I tried to be so careful. I just wanted to do something special for my mama's birthday. Now it's broken and I can't seem to fix it." "No." Her grandfather's voice sued her. But I know someone who can. Here, help me pick up the pieces. Oh my. Rico and her grandfather set each piece on a tray and carried them out to the gar garage where her father worked on a project. Her face palled with fear, worrying that her father would be upset that she had broken her mother's favorite bowl. Instead, he smiled at her and wrapped his daughter in a hug. Then he picked up the broken pieces and examined them, saying, "What do we have here?" She says, "I broke mama's bowl." Well then, her father spoke, rolling up his sleeve. We will fix it, but it won't be the same as it was before. It will be even better. And Rico watched and wonder as her father, a talented artist, mixed a golden lacquer with a few scoops of rice flour to make an adhesive. He placed the broken shards of the bowl together with the glue. And she watched in amazement as the bowl took shape. gold gleaming from the cracks. Her father had been right. Somehow it was more beautiful than it had ever been in the first place. This technique is called kinugai in Japan. Her father explained as he worked. It's believed that when broken items are repaired with gold or silver like this, that the flaw becomes a unique piece of the object's history and the uniqueness adds to its beauty. But papa, there's a missing piece. Her fingers traced an empty hole where a a harpshaped shard was missing. Can Sue got to fix that? He said, "That's all right. I I make a new one." And he crafted a golden heart from the dust and filled the space where it glowed. "I've never seen anything so beautiful," Rico exclaimed as her fingers collapsed over her heart. "But won't mama be mad?" Her grandfather who had been watching from a nearby stool shook his head. There will be things in our life that will break no matter how careful we are. And just like this bull, but that doesn't mean that they cannot be fixed. What was once broken can now become something beautiful. Listen to these words. You are the healer, the healer of my heart. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; you are the maker and the God of all we are. I was the broken vessel in your hand. You looked beyond the hurt and made me whole again. A healer of the broken pieces. You touched my heart and made it new. And now my whole life I surrender. Lay it down before the mener. Lord, I give my life to you. The love that sought before I knew you has brought me near to where you are. And now my whole life I surrender. Now I live to praise you, the healer of my heart. [Music] Nothing compares Lord &gt;&gt; to knowing you &gt;&gt; and seen just what the grace of God it can do. Faithfully you sought me. You called me your own. You made a way to bring this wondering heart back home. [Music] the healer of the broken pieces. [Music] You touched my heart and made it new. &gt;&gt; And now my whole life I surrender. I lay it down before the mener. Lord, I give my life to you. The love that sought before I knew you. It's brought me near to where you are. &gt;&gt; And now I live to praise you ever. May I praise you, the healer of my heart. heart. The healer of the broken pieces. You touched my heart and made it new. And now my whole life I surrender. I lay it down before the mener. Lord, I give my life to you. Love that saw before I knew you. &gt;&gt; It's brought me near to where you are. &gt;&gt; And now I live to praise you. Ever may I praise you, a healer of my heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Colby, I have been hurting. &gt;&gt; I have been broken. I've been carrying this around for so long. Well, he's here tonight. I know it was a chopped up message, but I pray you got the point that he can heal every hurt tonight. No matter how big it may feel or how small, God can heal every broken heart here tonight. And not only does he take the broken pieces, but he makes it better than it was before. Say, how many can say, "I I need that healer tonight. I know my hands raised. I need that healer." Heavenly Father, you see the hands that were raised around this building. Lord, while your presence is here, God, you know every hurt and every pain that's in every individual. Lord, I wish we lived in a world where we were never hurt, never broken. But Lord, we don't. We live in this world, Father, that we deal with the hurts, the words that have been said, actions that have taken place. But Lord, there's a a whole building full of honest people tonight that have raised their hands and they're saying, "I need that healer. I need that healer to come by my way." And I pray tonight, Lord, while you're here, &gt;&gt; to stop at every aisle, stop at every heart, Lord, from the back to the front here, Lord, from the youngest to the oldest. And I pray tonight that you take the burden, Lord, take the pain, take the anxiety, Lord, whatever it may be tonight. [Music] Pick up the broken pieces, Lord. It may be a marriage. I'm asking that you'll restore it. It may be father against son or mother against daughter. Whatever it may be, Lord, restore it. Pick up the broken pieces like only you can. Lord, you've done it in my life. I was broken and shattered. But Lord, I know if you can do it for me, you can do it for these people tonight. We love you, Lord. We thank you for it. Oh, something [Music] beautiful, [Music] something good. All my confusions [Music] Jesus unerstood. All I had to offer him was brokenness [Music] and strife. But he made something.

Excuse [Music] [Music] me just a minute. [Music] I know where brother Col's coming from. I struggle with some of those things myself. And I guess as a pastor's son and been raised in the message and I know many of you have been involved in ministry and been around that and you don't know the brokenness that can come sometimes when we're trying to do what's right and trying to do what's good and yet we don't take enough time for our families or we don't realize some things that have happened and [Music] I just, you know, always wanted to put God's people first, but God's people are my family, too, and I'm one of his people, and we we just But he's the only one that can heal that.

We believe this is the age of adoption, but we're on a journey to the fullness. These bodies haven't been saved yet, but they can be healed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. These spirits can be healed. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful. And the more brokenness it seems like that you go through with a Kobe and the more things you have to deal with, it seems like it gives you a heart for the people. And you just there's something precious that comes out of that. the ability to It's one thing to have an ability to sing or an ability to preach or an ability to to pastor even or something. It's another thing to to be able to feel what people are going through. And I'm so glad the Bible says we have a high priest &gt;&gt; that was touched &gt;&gt; by the feeling of our infirmities &gt;&gt; that no matter what you're going through, Jesus knows about it and &gt;&gt; he's able to take it. And &gt;&gt; aren't you glad for that tonight? forgive me for being a baby. Just really touched my heart tonight. I I don't remember when I've felt that just as real as I did tonight. That just that openness and we're human beings as ministers. We're human beings. We people need to know that. And we we needed a savior. I'm so glad I found one. Needed a healer. I'm so glad I know one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God good to us tonight? Amen. Just as a way. Hallelujah. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, so thankful to be in your presence tonight on a Wednesday night. And Lord, every once in a while, we just need to break through. And we need a service where we just lay ourselves bare before you and say, "Lord, we need you." Lord God, I pray that this tonight would be that night, Lord, for each one of us, Lord, that we'd go from here. And Lord, I want to worship you like never before. I I want to love you like never before. I want to I want these chains that have held me for so long to be broken from my life. I pray that would be so in every heart.

I know I've received something myself and thank you for that, Lord. Thank you for your Holy Spirit that's come down and spoken to us. Pray you bless Brother Colby and Sister Mary and their family. Strengthen them, Lord, and help them on the highways and things. I pray you bless their ministry in the church there, our sister church there in Pony. I pray you'd bless them abundantly in Jesus name. Amen. You're welcome to go. You're free to stay in worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already done. Praise the Lord. The battle is over. The victory is won. It's all ready.
