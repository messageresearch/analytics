to that person lord to that situation i pray that you would do that tonight be free lord to move and to move me out of the way to speak to your people we pray in jesus name amen amen do you love him tonight amen it's good to see you in the house of the lord turn with me to ephesians chapter 1 verses 13 and 14. i um while you're turning there it's good to see brother john's sister gail with us tonight and it's always a privilege i was thinking about that they were at our wedding 15 years in a few days water goes under the bridge fast doesn't it i mean that's that's a lot of time at least it is for me some of y'all have been married for 50 60 years that's not a long time but for us it's a long time and and brother john and and sister gail were there for my wife before i met her so we appreciate them and their testimony here over the years and every one of you it's good to see you in the house of the lord tonight on a wednesday night i know there's some that are still sick with colds and things like that and i pray the lord would bless them as they watch this evening i want you to be especially in prayer for india the covet situation there is is awful and the believers are being impacted by it and i i've got to preach a service over zoom uh on tuesday morning about 8 30. so you'd be in prayer for me that will be able to do that and and preach something that would be real to those people because they're suffering so much right now it's just out of control it's kind of predictable that it would be in that environment but be praying for them especially for the believers there and maybe we could say something that would be a help in some way to them and then next week is our meetings keep that in your prayers starting thursday night thursday night friday night saturday night and sunday morning so be in prayer for the meetings coming up and i know there'll be some folks from out of town but i know it'll be a blessing to you that are here as well amen from the local church and so there'll be no service next wednesday night we'll start having church on thursday night no service next wednesday night let's read ephesians chapter 1 and verse 13. in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption the purchased possession and to the praise of his glory i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated i want to continue on our study on the breach and that may seem like a strange scripture but it's one that branham uses while he's preaching the breach and we've covered brother branham's introduction to that sermon where he talks about he begins to set up how that the opening of the seals could only be done by the lamb that it was only christ who could do that and then only the seventh angel messenger it would be his job to open the seals or to receive them from the lamb and and preach those and to reveal the thunders and that would be the the job of the seventh angel messenger and we found out that that is the seven thunders were those mysteries that were contained in the seals and now but the random switches gears in the next few paragraphs and begins to speak about what a seal is and i'm so glad he does because he answers some questions that that frankly i've had even early on in the message and he deals with some things about the holy ghost that i think is very important so we're going to get into that tonight when brother branham preached is this the sign of the answer he talks about several mysteries and we went over that list of those mysteries that were revealed by the seventh angel messenger and one of those mysteries was the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation brother branham puts it this way he said the mystery of the baptism the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did isn't that what you want tonight the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did and so in the breach brother branham begins to talk about that he said many of them i see are writing they got their books and writing the scriptures down marking them in their bible for a chain he said so that's fine i like for you to do that and then go home and study it he says and if you study it yourself then you'll understand it better you'll understand it better now some people will tell you this is not for you to understand but brother branham says if you'll study it you'll understand it better amen so he says if you study it yourself you'll understand it better just study it and ask god to help you to understand so even after a prophet preached it and in it was revealed to us we still have to ask god for help to be able to understand it amen isn't that the truth tonight amen you know why it's not because it's difficult it's not because it was given in a difficult way but it's hard for us to get out of the way enough to be able to see it because we bring our our preconceived ideas our notions our our flesh with john into the message of the hour and and we want it to be a certain way but that's not the way god called it to be and so it has to come by revelation it can't just be head knowledge and so brother branham says now he says we got the scriptures open let's see the holy spirit here itself he said the holy spirit here itself is a seal the holy spirit is a seal now this is important why did brother branham call the holy spirit a seal because the bible says that right and him being a word prophet he would say what the scriptures say so we find that even in the bible that christ was sealed do you know that the bible says that john chapter 6 verse 27 labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth and everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed he sealed him he identified he said this is my beloved son right he sealed him at the river jordan the father sealed him christ was sealed and so in second corinthians 1 21 he says now he which establishes us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god so in other words the person who who backs up my ministry paul's ministry hath anointed us is god who has also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts he's sealed us he's put his approval on us and once god approves something it doesn't have to go through another reviewing line it doesn't have to go as they do in the factory you know it goes through the line and then it goes down they see so many of them they reject and goes through quality control the christian doesn't go through quality control once he's been sealed right we don't get to we don't get to throw this one out and leave this one in but once he's sealed he's sealed god sealed him he said this is my beloved son aren't you glad you serve a god like that tonight this is my beloved son now he says he sealed us and that seal is permanent ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption and brother branham constantly will take that and say not to the next revival right and so you weren't sealed at one revival and we had that wonderful service a couple of wednesday nights ago but that you don't lose that if you receive the seal of the holy spirit now you can shout and lose that because you're not always going to feel like shouting you can speak in tongues and lose that because you're not always going to feel like that that that god's not always going to work that way in your life but if you ever get sealed you can't be unsealed amen hey man you see you can't you know once you have a revelation you can't undo that you can't unsee it right and once you're sealed you can't be unsealed you see because the seal is god's revelation about you right god's saying this is my beloved son he's saying this is my child and no one else gets to change that and gets to take it off that ought to give us a security brother random would put it this way he said that ought to take the scare and fear away from you right because it means that once i'm sealed i'm in amen that don't make me want to go out and live a life of sin it'll make me want to go out and do what i want to do what but what i want to do is serve god it makes me love him so much more it makes me makes me cling to him and and it makes me despise this old flesh and want to crucify it on every hand why because i'm sealed amen now it feels permanent to the day of redemption philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it amen until the day of jesus christ god does the ceiling right who who okays the law the king does right he stamps it he seals it that's his work not the pastors right not the congregations not anybody else's job to tell you that you're field or you're not sealed that's his job god testifies of his gifts god seals you amen now look and this is important as brother branham is telling us what a seal is so we can see the opening of the seals now a seal brother branham said signifies what a finished work the holy spirit being a sealed to the individual and to that individual when he receives the holy spirit then his time of groaning is over i love that his time of groaning is over see because it is a finished work now we know in the flesh you've still grown because you're groaning for a new body right you want a new body there's something about the flesh that you're always going to have trouble because that's just the kind of person kind of way that you're made the flesh is is cursed it's going back to the dust but there's something inside of you that's quit groaning right it's not looking for nothing more it's not looking for something better it's not looking for another message somewhere why it's sealed it's a finished work and that individual his time of groaning is over because it's the finished work you don't have to look here and there and try to find something on youtube or try to find something on on the internet and find out what's brother random really a prophet and all these things so he's sealed you don't have to look and find some other teaching from somewhere else he's sealed he don't need a man to take him through he don't need a man to teach him every little thing and tell him this is what kind of car you need to buy and it's what kind of house you need to buy you don't need a man to do that why he's sealed he's not looking for something more not looking for some new doctrine he's sealed are you whipping out he's not gonna he'd say well brother if i don't go to this church up by the ben if i don't go to this church i'll miss it how could you miss the rapture if you're sealed how could you miss the rapture when you're already on you know it's like it's like saying you're missing the train but you're already on it right how can you miss a rapture it's all to be good now watch so brother brother said it's the finish work that individual's time of groaning is over and now he uses an analogy here and i want to kind of dig deep into this he said like i used to work for the railroad company and we'd load boxcars with cans and different things from the canning factory he said but then before that car could be sealed the inspector come around to see if that car was properly loaded he said if not the first time it rammed together with something it'd scatter the stuff and break it and the railroad company was responsible see if the inspector said it was okay and then it failed the ins the railroad company was responsible right and so if god sealed something and then lost it he'd be responsible for losing it right now but he says that inspector won't he won't put his seal on it until he sees it's properly loaded right and and that means it's not going to break when it's tested it's not going to fall apart when it's tested and it will be tested because every son of god has to be tested and some of y'all been tested in ways that i can't even imagine but you passed that test why because you were sealed hey man he knew you would pass it so he put his seal on you knowing you would pass the test there's going to be a rough road it's going to there's going to be a a jamming together of the cars there's going to be a shaking in fact the scripture says everything by the same that can be shaken will be shaken but during this shaking time if you're sealed you've already been inspected you've already been sealed god said you're not you're going to make it god said you're not going to fall apart god said you're not going to stay close you're not going to lose your belief in a prophet you're not going to lose your belief in the message everything else may fall around you but you can't shake loose because you're sealed hallelujah oh this is good stuff now look he said if that inspector would test and that inspector would test everything to see if it was properly in place now he said if it wasn't he condemned the car and then we had to do it all over again until the inspector was satisfied and then when the inspector is satisfied he shuts the door now what does the inspector look for when he inspects the car what's he looking for well he's looking for loose items loosely packed items now i might go a different direction with this than you think so just hang hang with me for a minute because i remember when i first started preaching preaching this as he's looking for loosely packed items so he's looking for loose life in the sense that he's looking to see if you cut your hair and wear pants and looking to see if you if you live like the world looking for worldliness that's the way i understood that and maybe some of you have as well but the problem is i couldn't find where brother branham said that when he's or where the bible teaches that frankly because it creates a paradox because it creates a situation where you can't live it without the holy ghost and we know that's true you can't live it without the holy ghost you need the life of christ to be able to live the life of christ right and then on the other hand you can't have the holy ghost until you live it if he's inspecting to make sure your life is lined up in that way are you with me now so if you can't have the holy ghost until you live it and you can't live without the holy ghost and there's no hope and i remember the old holiness church that i grew up in there was a man i remember in the independent hole in his church that had been seeking the holy ghost for 40 years and every time he thought he had it he'd lose his temper or something would happen and and he'd have to go back and seek the holy ghost again they called it entire sanctification and they would go back and and be entirely he thought well i've never been entirely sanctified he was at the altar every service for 40 years and never could get it because every time he'd make a mistake right and and if we're not careful we get that way where well with the holy ghost has to inspect our lives so if we go to the altar tonight we believe we receive the holy ghost we get up we feel better we go home and then we fail tomorrow well he must not if if he was inspecting us he'd say well that that car's gonna fail but there's no evidence in the new testament of people who had to wait until their lives were perfect to receive the holy ghost there's no evidence that they ever had to wait until the statue of a perfect man was perfect to receive the holy ghost because to have that statue of a perfect man you've got to be partakers of the divine nature right so it's not waiting until our lives are perfect but brother branham uses the analogy of a boxcar and he uses this in more than one place but he uses it up until up until this time when he preaches to breach and i can't find where he ever uses it again he does continue to use the analogy of the holy ghost being a seal but he types it instead to circumcision and takes it to abraham now just follow me for just a moment abraham is given the covenant of circumcision in genesis 17. and paul talks about it in romans 4 11 he said he received a sign of circumcision a seal of what of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also now what was god looking for before he gives him the seal this covenant he was looking for his faith right and then that faith would produce obedience so there were steps of faith that abraham would walk through would go through and god sees that and he gives him the seal of circumcision in response to that you say where do you get that from well from the scripture watch what he says romans 4 12 the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised and so what is the inspector looking for he's looking for those steps of faith now brother branham talks about it in just a little bit different way but what's he looking for acts chapter 2 and verse 38 peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what's he looking for someone who will obey that someone who will believe that someone will take it for themself right someone will grab hold of that word and and say that's for me amen that's me amen and then do that right because judas could be justified and sanctified but he couldn't make it to the upper room but he's walking watching for somebody who has the steps of faith that is willing to do what god said and it's not because you're perfect but it's because you have the faith to believe it where did that faith come from come from god it come from the fact that you are a seed of god and that's why those in cornelius's house can even be received the holy ghost while the word was being preached before they'd ever been baptized why because god knew that those steps of faith would be evident in their lives and they could be sealed but we make it well you know if that person they must not have been sealed because they made a mistake well that's not it but let's let's just go into that like i said dig into it a little bit brother branham in the force field he said yes you can accept it by faith you have to accept christ by faith now he's talking about random uses this a lot how a baptist man come and said i can't believe you're teaching an apostolic doctrine he said you receive the holy ghost when you believe but the brahmana said that wasn't true because paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed right he said you can accept it by faith you have to accept christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the holy spirit by faith but then let the holy spirit come and give the circumcision amen as a witness that he has accepted your faith what's he inspecting for those steps of faith he's accepted your faith he looks at the boxcar and it's in order it's right it's good and and you can find where brother branham talks about this now he says he's accepted your face he didn't see abraham believed god and it was imputed him for righteousness but god gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he had accepted his faith so that's the same thing we must do listen to this he said we must wait on the holy spirit until it's done something right not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we danced or we got emotional or we shouted and i know i i'll probably get grief for this but i know there's people who believe that they can tell if someone receives the holy ghost because of the way they cried or they shouted or they come to an altar i've i can't tell let's just put it like that based on that right but look at somebody's life what happens when they leave right and you might have two people that go through the same emotions have the same and i believe in the emotions like i said i'll stack my pentecostal credentials up with anybody i believe in the emotions but but let that go through the life and see it's that person living uh every day is there's something about it and and again you can't put the seal on it but god puts the seal on that life we must wait on the holy spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we danced or we got emotional or we shouted until we were changed amen until something actually happened he said i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing again in the token brother branham deals with this he said real genuine gospel as clean as i know it he said i know it's true do you believe we still need the gospel today we still need to hear the gospel as revelated as we are we need to hear it he said as clean as i know it i know it's true i've tried it there's no other ism no work up no schemes no gimmicks no nothing it's just pure unadulterated faith in the word of god and the finished works that god required at calvary knowing that there is nothing we could do to save ourselves we just accept what he did for us amen he said abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness then god gave him the seal of circumcision as a token that he had received his faith he said there is the gospel amen he gave him that as a token now again in investments he said why abraham believed god it was imputed to him he said how much more can the man do and again this is this baptist man that's saying that abraham received the holy ghost when he believed he said i said truly he believed god but god vindicated it by giving the seal of circumcision he said now when you say you're a believer god has never recognized your faith until he sealed it with the baptism of the holy ghost notice what he's looking for he recognized it as a predestinated seed you realize what it means when you say you got the holy ghost you have the seal of the holy ghost that's not something to take it lightly you're saying i am a predestinated seed because god doesn't seal the book and then go back and have to rewrite it right he doesn't seal the book of redemption and go back and have to add names or take them away but he has never recognized your faith until he's sealed with the baptism of the holy ghost and he's recognized it as a predestinated seed that's what he did with jesus he said this is my beloved son hallelujah now let's go back to the breach and continue on that thought brother branham says the inspector shuts the door and go listen to the tape but the brandon puts the emphasis on the word inspector he said the inspector shuts the door the inspector places a seal upon him and then no one amen i'm so glad i don't think that tonight what sin no one can break the seal until it reaches its destination why it's predestinated seed it's identified as such not by emotion or sensation but god put his seal on it amen and the very idea of a seal again remember what i told you the seal is the mystery right the very idea of a seal you're not going to be able to prove to anybody else that you're a seed but it's a revelation to you right because the very idea of a seal denotes a mystery but there comes a day when we'll know who the seed are because only the seed go in the rapture are you with me now and that seal breaks and it's revealed but let me tell you something we're living in the age and i'm kind of getting ahead of myself now but i just feel to say this we're living in the age when the book that you are the life that you live is being revealed to you so that not only as the opening of the word and the opening of the seals come it was not only a book about the the bible and things that happened in the bible and not only a book about things that happened in church history but it's talking about you and you begin to see yourself there and it's like you're being your seal is being broken the seal that god put on you and then god says this you're you're my child you're recognizing as he has recognized you'd be predestinated seed now you're recognizing and i think if we would realize if we could really come to terms with the fact that we're the seed of god it would change everything in our lives because then how how could god do something unfairly with us how could he deal unfairly with his own children you say but but but my child my my situation i was born with this i had this problem i've had this struggle you don't understand what my family's been through but how would he deal with the seed unfairly he can't do it he won't do it amen he always deals with the seed fairly he always chastises his children fairly he always corrects them fairly amen so if i realize if i have that revelation that i am the seed if i can see my name in the book then i know that whatever he does is good now so he says that's what the holy spirit has been doing see he goes and inspects he goes and he inspects he said that's the reason you can't have these things and you say i spoke in tongues and i shouted i danced in the spirit he said that i don't have nothing to do with it see the holy spirit inspects that person until he's thoroughly satisfied and knows that they are he said then they are sealed unto their eternal destination there is not nothing can ever break that seal hallelujah there is not nothing can ever break that seal in quotes ephesians 4 30. you're still to the day of your redemption he said hold that word redemption you're sealed until the day after redemption hold that word redemption he said see until amen until the day that the book of redemption is the next quote has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim his possession hallelujah he's sealed until the day what's been going on that's that's what's happening church like i said how can you miss a rapture you're already a part of how can you how can you leave a message that is you right how could you ever do that how could you ever miss that so now he says until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it see don't grieve it he said stay he said do things that pleases god. for the book is sealed the book is sealed now and you are sealed amen he said the holy spirit itself is to steal so you do things that's pleasing to god because you're you have been sealed by god now he says seal signifies he said now this is words i got from the dictionary he said seal signifies the finished work are you still with me tonight still hanging with me still soon finds that finished work what's he doing he's he's inspecting to see if you've done what you were told to do i've got told something the other day monday that really really blessed me it's because a man called and he was very encouraging hear from the church and he called me and told me he said brother ben he said you told me to do something he said and i took it to heart and i did it and it worked and it wasn't anything major it was just something that i had been through something and i said i think it'll help if you do this he said i did it and it worked and the situation just broke open and somebody who was hard against the gospel started accepting things about the gospel and and and being becoming friendly with their family again and things like that but see that's just me as a pastor but can you imagine how much more if we would just do what god says if we could just take god's word for it it just blessed me he said i took it to heart and i did it and it worked what if we could do that with every word of god i took it to heart and i did it and it worked amen hallelujah amen and he says seal signifies he said a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken and i underline that because it has to be broken for the seals to be open right when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of god that's sealed in these mysterious seals it's finished until the day that seal is broke and then it's revealed what's on the inside of it he said if the man is wondering what's in that boxcar said there's supposed to be such and such they're supposed to be he's presuming amen he's presuming but when the seal is broken and the door is open we see into it then and see exactly what's in there hallelujah when the seal is broken the door is open we see into it there to see exactly what's in there he said you see it he said and that will only be done at the end time what a marvelous day to live in he said another thing and i'll just continue for just a few more minutes and we'll close but he said another thing a seal signifies this ownership see the seal has a mark on it shows ownership when you are bought by the blood of jesus christ and sealed by the holy ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by god hallelujah amen and he says he says another thing is a seal this is security seal means you're secured he said now you that don't believe in eternal security i don't know he said but now a seal signifies security to its destination woe unto that guy he said they would try to break that seal and the holy spirit still cannot be broken he said you have all heard me say and then brother iran was going to deal with this and i want to again dig into this statement because i think it's important he said you've all heard me say that people said the devil made me do this he said no the devil didn't do it he just wasn't sealed in because when you're sealed in he's sealed out he said see he said no you went out to him he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you is to come to the same process you have you'd have to be saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost then he'd be your brother so you see so he didn't do it no he said you just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over into canaan you see across jordan the death to self and so this brought another question another thing that i've dealt with and i guess i've had to broaden my understanding over the years myself about this is can you backslide after you have the seal of the holy ghost i had somebody from a local church when i was pastoring at bransville not not here in hardy but nearby that had come and talked to me someone from my church would come and talk to me they said well i talked to this brother and he said that if i was sealed with the holy ghost that i could go up to the swimming pool and stare at the look at the at the ladies in the swimming pool and it wouldn't bother me i said well i guess he's more sealed than i am and the truth is he's more sealed than brother branham was can you backslide after you have to seal the holy ghost this is what brother branham says in the token he said here friends he said if you ever was healed if you live long enough you're going to get sick again but if you one time take that token you've had it forever he said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed to the day of your redemption not to the next revival he said he wasn't sealed you got emotionally worked up but you are dead and your life is hidden in god through christ you're sealed by the holy ghost he said if you are once baptized into that holy spirit he said now you can backslide that is true but you can't get away from that seal you're sealed into it now watching again i'm not going to deal with much more in the breach so just hang with me just a moment he said see temporarily minor every one of us backside many times a day then who ought to be at the altar right is it just the person who oh you say well i don't have to repent i'm a christian i'm sealed well you still live in the flesh and the prophet of god say you each one of us backside many times a day he said we're all guilty every one of us there's none of us perfected and as long as we're in this body he said we are still no matter how much the people try to tell i've got sanctified i can kiss this woman or do that he's lying he cannot i can't put that any more forcefully to you than what we have but you can't do it right you will but she's a good christian i'm a good christian we'll just write we'll just do these things together and we'll be okay no you won't you can't do it so the prophet of god said he said he said i don't try to say lord let me see how close i can go this lord keep me as far away as i can get see just stay as far away said remember you're still human being he said but now if you make a mistake and do something wrong he said you don't willfully if you're a christian if you're a born-again christian you don't mean to do wrong your intentions and everything is right he said but if you do and he's answering a question here he said if you do as she said he said make a mistake and do something wrong he said well let god will god just let you just go on and on and die like that and be lost or will he bring you back to reconciliation he said he will bring you back i want you glad for the tender hand of jehovah he will bring you back hallelujah that's right he will bring you back he said and then if you do anything wrong he said if it don't condemn you and you go on like that on out remember he wasn't saved at the beginning he wasn't saved you just had to make believe he wasn't saved but when you when you're saved you have a different spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in christ and the old things has passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness he said and but being you're living here in this world here there's traps set for you everywhere i've learned not to be surprised by anything because there's traps set for you everywhere you think satan gave up on trying to get me to do something wrong you think he's given up on you you might be 70 80 90. it doesn't matter how many years you've been a christian he's not giving up on laying traps for you he's got traps everywhere we live in an age when everything's a trap even the device that you carry the phone everything that you've got is a trap everything is a trap he's got them all over but you're a new creature in christ amen hallelujah he's got traps for you everywhere but you're a new creature in christ he said you're walking with your eyes on christ see because if you put your eyes on a preacher the preacher might fall you put your eyes on a church the church might might fail you you put your eyes on mom and dad they might fail you you put your eyes on somebody else they might fail you but if you could ever get your eyes on christ if you could ever get them off the preacher and off of mom and dad and off the church in real life they're just human but i serve a perfect god i've served the one who was sealed by his father he said he said this is my beloved son he said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world i served the one who walked out that day and grabbed hold of the book when no man was found worthy i serve that man i can keep my eyes on him and i can be a new creature in christ i'm walking with my eyes on christ he said and remember that when you make a mistake a real christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation quickly you can't live that way it's an impossibility you understand he just can't he's not built for it he'd go crazy like that i got a picture of noah's dove returning to the ark because that's where brother branham takes this and i won't read it all my brother brown takes this to noah's dove and he's there and he sends out a crow and the crow can just go wherever he wants he's perfectly happy sitting on an old rotten carcass sitting in a you name the kind of church and ever nobody changes he's happy with that everybody just remains in their deadness and their and their uh petrifying flesh the sense of it it's fine with him he's perfectly happy living like that living a double life living one way and saying he's something else he's perfectly happy but the dove flew out and couldn't find a place that she was comfortable with she still flew out and sometimes you'll fly out sometimes you'll go you'll fall into a trap you'll do something you shouldn't do but you're just not you can't live there and no matter if it's embarrassing no matter what it is you say lord i've got to come back i've got to get back in the ark i know i lost my temper i messed up i i did wrong with my children i had i did something i shouldn't have done i i messed up lord i didn't follow your leading but i want to come back lord and i don't care how embarrassing it is who i have to apologize to what i have to do to come back i want to come back to the ark it's the only place that i find safety amen you will come back and brother branham says again in the breach he said now notice this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption we're here and we're beginning to find out what was written on the inside very bad i think that's why this means so much to us sometimes i just take some of the message like this and read maybe 15 or 20 paragraphs of a sermon of brother branham's and you just take that and and it just opens up to you it opens up to you why it's the hour we live in it's not the preacher that's the hour that we live in we live in that hour when these things are being opened we live in that time when we can fly like eagles this is the claiming time and the same message that opened the book and revealed the thunders the same message that revealed telled us about serpent seed and marriage and divorce and all the mysteries that brother branham talked about that were revealed the same the same one who told us about a white horse and a black horse and a red horse is telling us today who we are not by coming up with some other message but by looking at that same message and brother branham later on and we'll get to it maybe if the lord permits in the some coming time john began to rejoice because he could look but the brother said he looked past the curtain of time and saw john do you know what it meant to be able to look past the curtain of time and see john john been through some things he'd been thrown on the isle of patmos he didn't know if god was for him or against him some of the time because here he'd been through they tried to boil him in oil and couldn't get couldn't kill him so they threw him out with the serpents and the scorpions and everything else but john saw john beyond the curtain of time hallelujah and if john saw himself beyond the curtain of time once he saw it he couldn't unsee it no matter what happened to john from then on john could say i saw it amen i was there no wonder he rejoiced no wonder he cried out why this is the hour when the book is over the seal is open he made it john could leave there and say i've already made it hallelujah amen i've already made it amen the battle is over amen the victory's been won it's already done very bad you believe it tonight i've already made it he said i saw myself past the curtain of time would you bow your heads with me tonight can you see yourself beyond the curtain of time have you looked at the word can you see he saw john can you see the book's been open can you see that's me once you see yourself there no trial will ever throw you off of it no tribulation of life though it may you may be tested because that's what the inspector does he tests you he tries you he lets you go through some things but you can't be thrown off what you've seen once john saw john beyond the curtain of time that shielded that was it he could rejoice he could he could come into that what brother adam called king lamb worship time he could worship like never before because he knew that sin wasn't there anymore all that he was had been washed away the lamb had taken the book and john had seen john can you see your name there today i trust that you can heavenly father lord jesus as we just take a moment lord we're washed by the water of your word maybe we've let little ideas that we have or something maybe we thought well i have to be perfect before i can receive the holy ghost oh god help us to realize that it's those steps of faith that you're looking for it's that one that'll come by faith say i know i haven't done it all right but i know according to your word you said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ you shall receive the holy ghost i i believe it it's a gift lord i believe i can receive it you never told me to go get it you said receive it i pray god if there's one like that here they would receive it tonight lord maybe there's somebody that's just kind of gotten that vision of scared just life has done it they've been walking through life and it's been hard and they realize that they're just human they've made mistakes back said maybe many times today they made many mistakes then they go to you and they begin to cry and say lord would you forgive me you say what sin help them to realize lord help them to realize who they are help them to know they don't have to wait on a sin to be forgiven but you've already forgiven all they have to do is come back to the ark i pray you granted god lord we can't clean ourselves up we can't make ourselves live right by your word we can live right i believe the holy ghost can keep us from every sin lord and we pray that you would or there's nothing that that would this lord that would hurt me more than to hurt you i don't want to do it lord lord i'd ask you if i bring a shame on this message just take me off the earth i don't want to do that yet i realized lord i realized father tonight that [Music] you've already interceded you've already sealed me as yours i don't have to walk on pins and needles because if i would make a mistake god forbid it's been already forgiven it's already taken care of all i have to do is receive it accept it believe that it's mine i pray you'd grant it tonight help us to realize that father our worship would be so much more if we weren't worshiping through the veil of our own mistakes but if we could ever give us push that veil aside realize that we can worship you here as if we were already there because we're not worshiping you through a veil of mistakes we're not worshiping you based on how good we are but we're worshiping based on what you did you took the book when we see ourselves beyond the curtain of time lord we can begin to see that you have done that we couldn't do it ourselves we thank you for it i pray you'd move in every life lord each one that's watching those that will be here on sunday lord those that will be in the meeting coming up i pray god that you just moved lord as you've been moving my heart towards prayer today i pray god that each one of our hearts would just be stirred in that direction lord that we could just begin to pray or not because we're far from you but the closer we get to you as we said sunday the more the closest one to you christ himself he was on earth never did anything wrong the most perfect man yet he prayed more than any man had ever done we find him praying more than any other oh god would you stir us to that lord help us to pray lord not because we think that our effort will produce something but because we know that you're a real god and that you honor and you hear the prayers of your children i pray you'd bring back every backside or touch every heart lord in your presence tonight would you help us just to worship beyond our flesh lord according to the way you see us in jesus name amen amen thank you for being patient with me tonight let's sing it it's already time i'm just worshiping my moment hallelujah it's already done you want to stand with me tonight we'll just worship and praise the
