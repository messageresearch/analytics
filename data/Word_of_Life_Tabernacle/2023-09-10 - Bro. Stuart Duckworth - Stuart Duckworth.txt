love the Lord this morning amen certainly enjoying his presence here this morning and man we're just want to kind of continue the thought that we've had a little bit of worship under Redemption The Book of Ruth the second chapter just I titled this um Ruth moving out in faith amen Ruth 2 and one and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family of IMC and his name was Boaz and Ruth and moabit has said unto Naomi and this was something that stuck out to me here let me go now to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field of the Reapers and her hat was to light on the part of the field belonging in unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of a lemon leg you can be seated this morning let's pray the Lord bless his word amen do you love him this morning aren't you thankful that we can gather together here and just certainly miss our brother Ben here I know y'all will this morning but I pray him and brother Joel are just enjoying themselves and just having a good time I know they are just kind of got to watch a little bit of the the meeting out there and this looks like they're having a wonderful time I pray they they got filled up and they can they can come back and preach for a while and maybe y'all won't have to hear me for a few few weeks anyways man we love him this morning this kind of set the scene here just a little bit of what we had preached before and Naomi and Ruth have come back to the land of promise and they have returned during the time of harvest they had left a land that was in famine and and in drought the land of Moab but they they come to a land they return to the land and the land is is plentiful they have come Amen to the Land of Plenty they've returned to the land of bread and a place of worship we see that by predestination God always brings his children back to their ordained Place Naomi and her family they had got out of the land they they had got out of their place and and just horrible things had happened to them but we know that God always brings back his seed he always brings back his children to their ordained place and in that place he doesn't just bring them back to something empty or something that that won't hold them but he brings them to a place that has sustaining life it has sustaining Grace amen for the journey he's not just bringing them back to nothing but he's bringing them back to himself no matter the situation or the circumstance the bad decisions no matter no matter how bad or what the situation would be what what what a a real seed of God what their past would be God will bring forth his predestinated seed and he will he will sustain it and bring it forth just think about our worship here this morning and and where we came from and the songs that have been sung this morning and and what God has done for us and and in Psalms 40 And1 David said I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit and out of the myy clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he had put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God Amen many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the Lord can you say Amen he's brought us out this morning we were in a mess we were in a horrible way we were in the pit but he was a able to bring us out why because we we weren't just just nobody but the son of man came by our way amen and the son of man comes to seek and save that which was lost amen we were we were in a horrible place but he brought us out and he sets us up he didn't just just bring us out to to bring us to nothing but he has brought us to the revelation of the word of the hour amen that we know that we can know where we stand that we can know what we believe that we can know who we are right and he didn't bring you out he didn't bring you out to lose you he didn't bring you that you could come in and that you could go out but he brought you in that he could keep you unto himself amen and mean he has brought us to himself amen but we have we have a purpose here this morning we have a purpose in this hour we have come Amen to hear the word of the lord we have come Amen to to to believe a message amen to receive a message to believe a message amen and we come to sit under that not just sit under a preacher amen But Me Myself amen I God delivered me out of the world he delivered me from all sorts of horrible things and and come and fill me with his life and now we're sitting here amen and we're under the message of the hour and God is bringing us somewhere we're not just here amen just moping along and just sitting around amen but we're here for a purpose we're here for a reason this morning is to believe his word is to worship him in the way that he wants to be worshiped Psalms 107 said let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy amen amen God took me from from what I what I couldn't deliver myself from he was able to deliver me from the hand of the enemy and then it said let the redeemed of the Lord say so let them testify of his goodness let them worship him let let them come into the house of God and and let everybody know where they stand and what God done for him he delivered us from the hand of the enemy Satan Satan's plot for our lives is destruction his purpose is to steal kill and destroy steal your joy your worship to kill your faith with doubt and unbelief and his plot has always been to destroy the seed of God from the very beginning we see that spirit in Cain where he tried to come and where he where he killed Abel and all the way down through God's servants and His prophets and his people have been persecuted and murdered and when Jesus when when he died on the cross and he went to hell there even Satan said brother Ram depicts the story of how I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I had you when I killed this one and Moses and this one I I thought I had you when I killed John the Baptist but now I've got you but he didn't really realize what he had on his hands he had the Redeemer he had the one whose corruption could not set forth in his body but Jesus come to hell with a purpose he come to Hell amen so you and I didn't have to go he came to hell to defeat hell and he took the keys from Satan he took the keys from his own house but it's always been Satan's purpose it's been his desire to destroy the seed of God Amen but the seed of God will always Prevail because it is a predestinated seed you're predestinated this morning not to fall you're predestinated this morning to stand Amen in this hour excuse me so Satan Satan's plot is destruction to steal kill destroy take away your faith take away your joy but God's plan this morning God's plan in this hour is greater than Satan's plot and God's plan is not a a system of man it's not an idea or a certain Doctrine but his plan is redemption his plan is to bring us back from what to what we were in his mind to bring us back amen as Sons and Daughters of God from what we fell from to bring us back to what we were in his thinking Amen to be the bride of Christ in this hour not just to be a a church not just because there's been churches churches there's been Brides brides amen but there's got to come one that's both mechanics and Dynamics one that worships in spirit and in truth there's got to be that kind of people on the Earth amen you're it was predestinated to be here that type of people amen amen a people that will let the life of Jesus be manifest and we're we're thinking about the seed can't be destroyed the seed must go on the the predestinated seed of God will Thrive it will go forth it will be who God called them to be it will manifest what God Amen for the portion and the word of their hour they will manifest that portion and we're here to let that life and his purpose come forth in us to be a people that worship Him in spirit and truth that we wouldn't be a dead church that we would be a church full of life because God hates a powerless church amen just the people that would just come and go and just sit amen and not not be able to be moved and that's the title of our sermon Ruth Ruth amen she come to a spot she had come out amen and she there was something that moved on Ruth she she was a predestinated seed and we've got as a seed of God we've got to be able to let God move Upon Us amen not just stay in the same spot but move amen with the spirit of God Amen when when God moves upon us to say Amen worship amen not be bound down creatures but to be able to move with the spirit to be able to move into his presence and in his presence that that's where things take place that's where the change happens well that's Satan's purpose is to bring spiritual death but God wants to bring life the word has been restored in this hour to restore people the fullness of the word being here the word of the word of Life Jesus Christ the very the very bread of life we have come we have come amen not to something empty this morning but we have come in this hour we have come to the Land of Plenty we have come Amen to a place of bread to the living bread where you can Feast this morning not Upon A man you can Feast every day amen on the unfailing body word of the son of man the revealed word of the hour where you don't have to go to a man you don't have to come to me or your favorite preacher but you can go for yourself there's been food stored up amen and I've got to be feeding upon that you've got to be feeding upon that we've got to be in the message of the hour that is what is going to bring forth the very bread of life that's what is going to bring forth the Bride of Jesus Christ in this [Music] hour God has brought us not to something empty but the fullness of the word and the full of the word will bring fullness of redemption the very living bread in a time of famine in a time of famine they prophesied they would run to and fro searching for bread they would search for for for the word of God not for bread or for water so much but it would be a dry time but they they would search for for the word of God but they wouldn't find it but it has come to the predestinated people amen so if we can move out in faith if you can move out if you can take a step this morning God will meet you there and that's what that's what many times God God's there sir the word is here but we've got to step forward in faith this morning you got to be willing to move I don't want you to run around in your seat or run around in here but but you've got to be able to move within yourself we got to be we got to be flexible we've got to be amen where where we can be into the moving of the spirit is what I'm trying to say you understand I don't just want to sit here service after service the same way but we want to be changed amen amen we got to be able to move out in faith and God will meet us there he will provide what we as his predestinated SE need to come forth and Ruth and Naomi they didn't just need some food or drink excuse me they didn't just need food or drink though though they did need that though they did need that that had come from a famine but they needed a Kinsman they needed someone that was willing someone that was able to pay the price of redemption and bring them back to what they had Lo lost to look upon them with Grace look upon them in their and their poor condition their poorness of spirit and and their and their hunger and look upon them with Grace and it's the same thing for you and I we didn't just need a man or a man's idea or some new doctrine or some emotion or just to be able to be part of a good church somewhere though though those things are good but there was something in us that predestinated seed amen brought us to a person amen it brought us to someone amen we came in contact with someone that could redeem us not just make us better church people amen and that's what this message of the hour is to you and I it's the very person the very person come on preach with me it's the person of the Holy Ghost the very person of redemption that can bring you from what you were to what you're supposed to be amen the Holy Ghost amen this hour amen the spirit of God upon the fullness of the word bringing us back as predestinated Sons and Daughters of God that's what we need in this hour it wasn't another system of man that didn't that that could only bring you so far amen but we needed to come back Amen to the bread of life amen that we could bring forth Jesus Christ because he is the bread of life he is the word he is the message he is the person of the message amen it's not brother Brown it's not just a prophet the prophet himself had had to partake of that he was part of the Bride amen but a a redeemer amen the one that was worthy would come down because there was a prophet because there was someone there that could catch the mind of God amen amen the the star of our age the the messenger for our day to to relay this back to us this Revelation amen but I say this morning you've got to go yourself that's right you've got to go yourself and eat the book you've got to go and partake you've got to come this morning you've got to partake nobody can do it for you the preacher can't sit up here and do it for you brother Ben can't do it for you you've got to come and partake yourself you've got to be able to be move moved by the spirit of God and and the things that are said and brother bam said when the prophets would speak something in the Old Testament the people would tremble and they would Quake but we sit here and and we we feed upon the greatest and we hear the greatest message that's ever struck the face of the Earth Amen to the greatest people that's ever been upon the face of the Earth and we sit here sometimes and nothing moves us but what is is we've got to shake ourselves we've got to come amen and realize that I'm a predestinated seed amen and I've got to I've got to grow I've got to I've got to come to Perfection I've got to move move beyond what I've been amen come on now brother real says here he said what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell that's right he redeemed and brought back everything that Adam lost when he puts you in the pawn shot and brother brandom says that also that the devil puts you in the pawn shot but he's saying here that that Adam Adam put us in the pawn shot he forfeited his rights he's the one that fell right you know they're they're in the garden they would play the the blame game you know the serpent told me to do this and the woman told me to do this and they play the blame Bame blame game but they all made their decision to do what they done that's right and I want to get to this later but we also have a decision to make whether we're going to reject the LIE of the devil yes amen or accept the LIE if we're going to continue to listen to his voice because his voice will be there till we're gone his voice will be you'll deal with that voice that voice of doubt and reasoning till you're gone you have to make a decision but he redeemed us back to that Jesus Christ on Calvary was your Kinsman that redeemed you from Every curse of the devil that's what Redemption does for us it redeems your soul it redeems your sick body redeems your weary and your dreary Spirit brought he brought you happiness he brought you Joy amen he brought you peace and long-suffering goodness gentleness meekness power the Holy Spirit brought you Divine Healing all these things Jesus Christ brought to you because he was our kinsman redeemer he done that brother R says here he says and in him lays the fullness of redemption in him lays every Redemptive name of Jehovah lays right in him all salvation rest in him all Deliverance rest in him all peace all satisfaction you can never be satisfied with the world's Goods you can never be satisfied belonging to church you'll never be satisfied until you found the satis satisfication in Jesus Christ the son of God only way you can ever be satisfied amen sir amen he brings that satisfacation why can't I say that word I can't say it for some reason somebody say it satisfaction there I could not say it I could not say it sitting here right in front of me only he brings that satisfaction amen and so he in him was every Redemptive name every Redemptive blessing that Jehovah was of the Old Testament amen Jesus is of the new the same God that met and provided for Abraham Isaac and Jacob that God of the Bible is here this morning to meet you if you'll move out of your place if you'll step out just a little bit in faith he is here to meet your need this morning the same Jesus say where where's he at he's here in the form of the Holy Ghost and if your faith can just reach out this morning he's here this morning amen the pillar of fire has returned to the church amen if our spiritual Minds could be open this morning amen God God is here this morning he's here to meet you amen but the devil's

have need of amen amen he's the God of all Grace this morning we've come to his field amen we've come and searched for his grace this morning there's nothing you can do you can't you can't earn it in any way you just got to come because his grace is Sovereign this morning it's sovereignly given you can't you can't work your way into you just got to come you got to show up right just as Ruth did she come to the field he's the God of all Grace this morning Ruth said let me go now to glean ears of corn and who whose side I shall find Grace and no Naomi said unto her go my daughter that's that's Faith pushing you to go pushing you to go go to church this morning sir amen and get before me in prayer this morning listen listen to the message of the hour feed upon the word for your hour amen so she she begins to move out in faith here she was a stranger in a foreign land but there was something in her to in her calling her to go and glean in this field and amen to partake of the Harvest the plent of F Harvest Amen to take part of the worship to take part of the worship and the and the and the in the plentifulness to go to the field amen of the man that could redeem to go find Grace in his eyes amen we don't come here this morning to be seen or be heard I just want to find his grace amen I need his grace in my life I need a sustaining Grace in my life to bring me through to bring me through Amen to the rapture that's where I'm trying to get to that's where we're trying to get to and I'm not just going myself but I've got a family I've got children I can't just think about myself but there's a Grace this morning for everyone there's a Grace for your loved ones this morning there's a faith amen that that you can have that that you can have for them it's a Land of Plenty this morning amen and we have come to his field amen the one that can show us Grace and so as we said before to overcome you can't stay in the same spot you got to be willing to move you got to be able to to be able to bend you can't be slothful or complacent so Ruth she left the land of bad decisions she left amen a a family of all kinds of failures and bad decisions but she didn't look back at what she was amen she was going to the field she was going to the field she didn't turn back to that she had made her decision to leave all of that and come Amen to a land amen a foreign land to come and put her trust in the god of Israel she left her God she left her old way of worship to come to a god that could provide to come under the wings and the protection of the one true and living God Amen she said I'll not turn back I'll not go back she told Naomi I'll not go back but I'll go with you let your God be my God and I say tell this morning we've made a decision haven't we we've made a decision there's no turning back for us we've got nothing to go back to that's right amen if there was something greater than this message we we'd find it we'd move on just like just like brother R said of of Luther or Luther if if Wesley's message would have came for his day he would have taken to it because he was the seed of God Amen but because we've come to the final age amen we've received the final the final message amen there's nothing for us Amen to go back to and there's nothing more we have found amen we have found what we have need of amen and there's nothing amen that can make me leave it there's nothing that can make me denounce him and when I first started preaching and it wasn't much of a preacher and I'm not much of a Preacher now but I had this thought what would you do if everyone in your church everyone in your in your church left a message and this was before all of this had come come about and Satan had done the destruction and the way that he has what would you do do you have enough Revelation do you have enough within you to hold you though everyone leaves though everyone forsakes amen you got to have that something in you that won't turn back oh none go with me I'll follow Jesus it's not about following a man we're following Jesus in this hour he's Our Redeemer no man could do it nobody could do it it took him in this hour that brother R says that's when a person has caught a vision it don't it don't make any difference what her people said you're going over there to become a Holy Roller or something that didn't make any difference to Ruth there was a purpose of God to be fulfilled if we could just say it again there's a seed in you if you're a predestinated believer in this hour there's a seed in you and that's what that's what drawed you to this word that's what Drew you to him and that's what is manifesting itself amen it's not you becoming you but it's that real you inside you right that real that something inside you with you and God Amen that's manifesting itself amen we're and we're not even all the same amen we've got our own lives the the characters in the Bibles they had their own story to live out and you've got your story to live out this morning my story isn't your story and and so forth amen but that manifestation will come forth in this hour to its fullness I believe that sir we got a purpose here this morning amen we're not just floating along there's a purpose brother R says here just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the Holy Spirit there something in you pulling you that's a purpose of God in your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was for Ruth and he said that's what God wants not that borderline halfway but an absolute a full surrender to the kingdom of God that's what God wants this in this hour to bring Amen to to bring that predestinated seed forth that's what he's looking for amen you're willing to be called a fanatic amen oh you're going over there to to to become a Holy Roller you're going over there to a church that's too emotional oh you you believe in a prophet oh he he's got to be false he's got to be false no matter what even though the Bible said there' be a prophet in this hour amen well we can see those things we can understand those things because God has showed it to you but aren't you glad you've recognized your day in its message aren't you thankful amen aren't you thankful to him that he showed you that you left this world you left the systems and the denominations that you were in through the one that could satisfy The Thirst Amen in your heart the longing in your heart amen you tried to fulfill it he tried to you tried to feel that thirst some way many different ways and and different ideas and different different churches and and different things of the world but only he could come and satisfy that thirst sir nobody else can heal your body but God no doctor no nothing any knowledge they would have God would give them that knowledge you understand God Only God can heal this morning can heal your mind your spirit your soul amen any scars that's in your life from your past God Amen can redeem you from those things he can deliver you from those things amen so God wants a full surrender God wants someone that is willing to move out in faith someone that will respond to his word respond to the moving of the spirit right amen not just stay where they are but be willing to allow your life be transformed by his word be transformed amen by the renewing of your mind because that you have to first accept anything that happens in here whether you're healed you're saved you're you go into Rapture whatever it is you first have to accept it here in your intellect and from there brother BR s the greatest power fought he said it goes from there and then it goes down into your soul right so you you've got to your your mind's got to be renewed it's got to be changed you've got to allow yourself to be changed in this hour for your for our thinking to to be changed right no doubt we we believed and we understood things years ago maybe F when you first got saved or you first heard the message but as time went on you begin to see things more clearly and you became amen renewed amen but you became renewed by the things that you heard right and it and it and it changed your life it made you more mature it made you Amen to be able to deal with things in a better way it made you be able to respond to things in a different way it made you to be able to have more faith because you understand you begin to understand who you are and where you came from and where you're going what your purpose is amen so you got to be you got to be willing Amen to be able to be flexible just like just like Ruth when she she went to the field she couldn't just stand there and walk around she had to bend down she had to be able to bend she had to be able to to get on her hands and knees that's right right she couldn't just stand there and just walk up but she was coming to a position she was coming to a position where she didn't have to go to glean and that's what the grace of God is bringing us to but you've got to be willing amen we've got to come find Grace in his sight we've got to Humble ourselves in his presence amen and from that from that humility brings an exaltation where you come amen and we're we're talking about the seed you got to be willing to be able to to be movable amen you got to be willing to to accept this morning that you're the Queen of Heaven preach with me this morning help me you've got to be willing to accept in your mind that you're not just an Earthbound creature but you are the very bride of Jesus Christ amen You' got to let say you've got to kick out that old thinking amen that we're an Earthbound we're just some old church and we're just Gathering here today just for just for another normal service amen but the king is here this morning Amen to meet his Queen if you'll come forth this morning if you'll be willing to to move and be able to accept who you are amen amen you're the very Queen of Heaven in the Millennium you'll sit and you'll Rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years and there will be those that are that'll come that are outside the city you ask me to explain all this and I can't you just got to go to the message and and glean for it for yourself but there will be those that Redemption and Grace and God's mercy allowed in but you won't be on the outside of the city you'll be inside with the King amen you've got a different position in this hour thank you Lord and what we're coming from and what we're going to amen you got to be willing to be changed you got to be you know if you're you're not serving God you got to be willing to die to yourself you got to be willing to be born again to receive the Holy Ghost and and then and that is the only thing that's going to hold you amen because that that's the beginning and from that you begin to grow and you begin to change and you begin to mature amen but You' got to allow yourself to die to yourself amen yes sir to not be bound by the things of this life not to be bound by Earthly thinking but free to serve in this hour free to worship free to to respond to the call of God to come up higher to come up where all things are possible to them that believe Amen to the God Amen that can make me different that can change my situation that can come upon the scene if I call and amen he'll answer amen that I can become what God has called me to be right amen we look here Ruth and in the battle of the mind you got to think that so she come from this land hope I'm not boring you this morning we got I'm not going to be the 35 minute preacher this morning we got a few more pages but you got to think where she came from and where she was where she she was going she didn't even probably realize where she was going but she was just there to find Grace so where she had came from now she's beginning to glean in the field she begin to to glean and and to go and and glean in this field to find Grace and no doubt she had mind battles they gleaning with the peasants brother BR describes her barefooted and poor no doubt she could hear different ones maybe talking bad about her or where she came from but she was there to find Grace it didn't matter what everybody else thought and you've got to come to a place where it doesn't matter what the different voices say she she could hear the different voices in the back of her mind amen but Ruth didn't let anything hold her back amen there was something in her that changed when she made her decision that there was no turning back she had came to the point of no return so I believe at this point it didn't matter what anybody said she wasn't turning back but she was going to find Grace amen anden she wasn't going to let anything amen hinder that right she was going to stay right there she was going to stay right there until she got what she needed till she found Grace amen and we've got to stay here this morning amen stay here this morning until you get the blessing of God don't leave his presence amen there's Redemptive blessings amen the blood was spilled on Calvary for your healing this morning don't go away sick this morning amen you can go away a different person this morning if you need a change in your life amen if you're if you're serving the devil if you're serving the world I don't know how other to preach this amen but there's someone this morning amen we have come in contact with there's a field that we have come to this morning a power of God Amen the power of the Redeemer amen amen if you'll just stay right there if you'll be determined that you won't go back but you'll stay there until you get what you have need of that's the kind of Faith amen that God's looking for going to stay right there 2 Corinthians 10 10 and three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God Amen and bringing into captivity every thought Through The Obedience of Christ and we live in a time where Satan has so exalted himself exalted himself Amen to to be worship he said I I will Ascend Amen to the to this place I will Ascend and be like the most high that that's his ambition that's his purpose is to take the place of your God that he would become your God that he would in his Satan zeden in this in this perfect place that he has created for himself to sin in that he would infiltrate that he would exalt himself in your thinking and and not just the world he's already got them Church he's already got them but he wants to come in here and he wants to exalt himself amen but there's got to be a people that recognize the devil in every one of his tricks amen there's got to be a people that overcome but his purpose is to get into your thinking his purpose is to battle you in your mind from day to day amen from hour to hour every minute that he can Amen to battle your mind and your intellect well the Bible says we cast down reasonings you don't reason with faith faith has no reasoning Faith knows where it's at Faith acts Faith holds on it can't move nothing can move it I don't care what this says or that or the other it doesn't move a bit it stays right there wait wait wait wait don't make any difference Faith stays right there we've got to come to a place where we don't care no more what the devil says you don't care what anybody else says amen you know where you're at amen you put your faith in action amen you don't care what Satan says amen the word amen this morning says I'm free the word says this morning that I'm Healed the word says this morning amen that I'm going in a Rapture and there's nothing that can change that we've got to come to a place we've got to put him in his place you've got to say this morning that God's promised word for this hour I didn't just come in contact with it for no reason but God showed me this truth and I will let the promised word of this hour have preeminence in my life amen Jesus Christ is here to manifest himself in my life Satan you you're kicked out you have no place in my home you have no place in my life you have no place got to say this morning that you got got to believe this morning that you are predestinated to this message that you're predestinated to this truth to manifest the word for this hour you've got to believe that for yourself that every Redemptive blessing is mine amen you go let's take that attitude it's mine there you go it's mine amen Jesus didn't die for the devil he didn't die for him and I'll say this we we'll give him a little black eye there is no Redemption for him there is no place of redemption for him he ascended away he fell from his position and there is no restoration there is no Redemption for him he has got it coming he's got it coming he's going to he he's going to have his day of Destruction where he will be no more where he will exist no more but the battle's Raging now the battle's still raging and it's raging in your mind it went from heaven and it's come to your mind it's come to Earth for you and I to deal with but we've got to take a stand in this hour brother ROM says here God perfecting his church oh you great Living Church of the Living God you who have claimed to have kissed the blessings off the rim of the cup sometimes I wonder if God can ever take his gospel and Shake you to a place till you realize who you are and and the rights that you have the God give given Privileges and he goes on to say here and I love this he says Satan don't have one right of nothing nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had at Calvary when Jesus Christ taken the sinner's place and died at calving Satan has no legal rights over nothing no more Hallelujah but everything lays in the hand of the church and the believer that's it Satan's lost and he's nothing but a BL oh if we could just take that quote if we could just take what the prophet of God said about you and I if we can just shake ourselves this morning if we could just by the Gospel of Jesus Christ just shake ourselves out of our seat this morning a little bit come on get out of our comfort zone a little bit in the day-to-day life amen amen begin to testify of what God's done for you testify of his word worship Him amen and I don't know nothing better than that to drive away the enemy from your life amen when we begin to talk about Jesus and his love and His blessings and his mercy and the grace that he showed Upon Us amen there's an anointing that comes upon me amen when I begin to testify when I begin to tell somebody there's something amen God loves to hear you tell people what he's done what he's done for you he loves to hear it come from your voice from your mouth God loves to hear that and Satan hates to hear it because once he had control but now he doesn't amen he's nothing but a bluff this morning he's nothing but a bluff yes sir he's a real devil he's a real adversary but he's nothing but a bluff that word Bluff means to deceive someone by making them think that you're going to do something that you have knowledge or that you're some someone else oh he's always trying to trick you always trying to step you up trying to make you think that that he's somebody else but he's nothing but a bluff this morning he's nothing but a bluff every time Satan's in your ear is a lie you got to cast that thing out amen replace it with the word replace it with praise amen recognize the devil recognize that he's real recognize that you've got an adversary every day every minute every hour he's not going to let up he's not going to he's not going to back down unless you do something about it amen recognize that amen the devil that is against you brother Brown said to overcome you must recognize that but the god in you is greater and mightier than he is he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him he said that's real overcoming when you recognize and the greatest battle ever fought see it's your mind that opens up the door and closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes it down itself down of these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out he said every doubt is gone every fear is gone amen and we're not to be controlled by the spirit of fear amen but of a of a power and of love and of a sound mind every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan can't battle against that he cannot battle against it amen we know that's true he says these battles has raised since the the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it but I want to say this morning Satan started it with the bride of Jesus Christ in this hour she's going to finish it we're going to finish this F we're going to finish this race amen we're going to finish amen amen what the word said about us amen we're going to come back amen Redemption is bringing us back Amen to what Adam and Eve lost and what they fell from was a position am man they fell from the position and that position was a fortification behind the word of God and when they stepped out of that amen when they begin to reason in their mind whether it's this way or that way that's when the trouble set in amen but there's a bride amen that Eve that bride was predestinated to fall amen but this bride she's predestinated to stand in this hour amen she's going to reject you're going to reject the LIE of the devil amen that's your faith amen that's how you end the battle that's how we come back that's how we come back to what God has for us amen when we reject when we take the fullness of the word and these bodies are changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen we have rejected that final lie amen that Satan said we couldn't do it that we couldn't go in a Rapture amen but we're going to prove him wrong in this hour there's going to be a people amen that will not taste death I'm preaching to him this morning cast him down this morning reject a lie reject him imaginations and the reasonings of Satan let God's word have preeminence in your mind and in your life amen cast him down this morning amen The Plan of Redemption in this hour restored to us the word it restore to us the power of the name of Jesus Christ and the power that there's power in that name Amen to be baptized in that name because in that name there is life in that name amen is Deliverance and that name is redemption that's part of the Plan of Redemption of this hour to show us the Mysteries to bring back the word brother said it couldn't it it had to be left off in the other ages but in this age that word amen those truths had to come back to back to to restore us to bring back the godhead and we could actually know who God is that he's not some Trinity but he's one God amen there's one God and that God Des deserves My Worship that God deserves my praise amen amen amen Satan wants to be the god of your life he's the god of the evil age amen but there's one God and his name is Jesus [Music] Christ say that's simple we've heard that and heard that there's power this morning in the name of Jesus Christ there's power in his word when when a Believer amen can put the word amen in faith when they can put the their word the word word on their lips that has defeated Satan yes in every place amen amen Ruth finding Grace Naomi told Ruth said if you can find Grace with him you'll find rest if you find Grace you'll find rest Boaz represented Christ the rich man the heir of all things the lord of the Harvest how when Boaz come riding out there in that Carriage looking around over the fields and his eyes fell on Ruth his eyes fell upon Ruth he was the master he was the lord of the Harvest and she found Grace in his sight and we're here this morning to find Grace in his sight Ruth there green gleaning bending down flexible they're poor looking amen oh there's Grace there this this morning if you're willing to come amen and glean willing to move out by faith to come and enter in and move with the spirit willing to bend down lay your life down and partake of the field of the Redeemer partake of the word of the hour and me the one that can bring you out the one that can heal and restore every part of your life amen amen under Redemption there's Grace and there's rest Redemption is is not something partial but Redemption is to the elect and God isn't going to just bring us part of the way and not finish it but he's the author and he's the finisher of my faith and he that hath started a good work he will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen he has taken the responsibility upon himself for you and I amen those that have found Grace in his side there's a Grace this morning amen there's a Saving Grace if you need saved if you need filled with the Holy Ghost amen there's a keeping Grace this morning Amen in the field of Boaz amen there's a place of fullness of Grace that we have come to amen there's a Rapture in grace to bring you through through amen I believe that this morning Redemption redeems you from everything that's wrong redeems you from the wrong thinking Ruth Ruth had to overcome that that which was in her to turn back because her great great great grandmother Lot's wife turned back so that was in her amen and she had to overcome that and so here we are in Satan's Eden and we've got to overcome the LIE we've got to overcome the lie and and how Eve our mother our great great great great great whatever What She Done Adam forfeited Adam put us in the pawn shop but we we've got that within us we've got to overcome those battles as humans as humanity and that's why I took a Kinsman it couldn't be an angel it couldn't be an angel an angel amen wasn't l lost humans were lost so God had to come down in the form of a man amen and pay that price I love him so much for it this morning amen I'll try to finish up here okay redeems you redeems you from the curse everything that is wrong Ruth had a predestinated moment man she had a predestinated moment and the Bible says that it was her hap to light on the field belonging to Boaz and that word ha there it means an unforeseen meeting an accident like it was an accident but it really wasn't an accident it was just it was just chance it just chance that I I come across the message you know I'll just you know I'll just float along here no it wasn't chance it was a predestinated meeting that God showed you these things it was your fortune that word fortune it means Fortune it means fate it was your fate God predestinated you to this truth amen so she had come to her place of Grace and rest she had a meeting with the Kinsman her future husband only only this man only this man could Elevate her to her position her God called place and only the word in this hour will restore you back to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour God will bring forth his seed amen and and from that lineage from that Union God would bring forth Kings he would bring forth Warriors he would bring forth a David right bring forth a Shepherd boy bring forth a Shepherd void that would that would slay a lion that would slay a bear and this is what comes forth from a predestinated line from a predestinated child of God that Warrior comes from comes forth from us amen that that anointed king that anointed priest amen amen that will slay a giant amen that predestinated seed has to come forth in this hour to defeat the enemy that's
