And we are not following blindly but we're following [music] thorough vindication. And I'm so thankful for it this morning. Let's just enter in and pull on the gift of God. How many's ready to receive this [music] morning? As our pastor comes at night, I lay in there and I begin to cry.

Heavenly Father, we're so thankful that we can feel that this [music] morning. Thankful that you are a God who responds, Lord, and calls. Lord, I pray that there would be one here this morning that's feeling that pull that they would respond to that and [music] they would just, Lord, pull up closer to you, God, as we can only do that by agreeing with your word, by believing your word and accepting it in our hearts. And pray that you put that together. pray that you'd just move in a mighty way in this service. I pray that there'd be no hindrance to your word being preached or to the spirit of the Lord moving. I thank you for these people that have gathered together. Lord, we we know that you're with us because you promised you would be. Lord, I pray you'd heal every sick person. So many out today sick.

Amen. God bless you this morning. If you'll turn with me to Philippians chapter 2. Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. Is this cutting out? Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. [crying] If you could turn it off back there. Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. &gt;&gt; Might. There you go. Philippians 2 and verse 5. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. How many want that today? &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. Brother David, good to see you back there. You and your family with us this morning. God bless you. I know they're still mourning the loss of a pastor there at the church, little church they were going to. Just pray the Lord would give direction to each one. Amen. When when brother Brandham preached the spoken word as the original seed in 1962, he made the statement that there had been many seeds sown into the earth. If you've listened to that, you remember him talking about that. He talked about how denominational seeds had been sown and there had been uh seeds sown of uh of Pentecostalism and seeds sown of revivalism and Baptist and different ones. But he said there was also a word seed that was sown. And he said that there couldn't have been a uh a a harvest of the seed uh or a harvest. He said it couldn't be the latter rain because the seed hadn't been sown yet. So we know that the Pentecostal revival of 1906 wasn't the latter rain because the seed hadn't been sown and the latter rain could only come in the harvest time. So he he he brings that out and and he brings the people to a place where they understand what's happened. And then he makes this statement. He said, 'Lord, he said, 'I got the people standing here now. He said, and I've got them on a limb. He said, and I can't predict a future. You know, Brother Brandham wasn't God. He was a prophet. He could only tell us what the Lord told him. And I'm glad that he was faithful to do that. But he he said, "I can't predict the future. I can't tell them what to do. What will I do?" He said, "I'll leave them standing on a limb." And I said, "God, I think I'm doing this by your will." He said, "I've never done this before cuz the seed hasn't been sown yet." He said, "But I believe it's time for me to say something." And the Holy Spirit spoke to his heart because he said, "What am I going to say to the people about the future?" And he said, "Pick up your pen and write." A and within that I I want to focus on a part of that. Brother Brandham wrote several things by inspiration of the spirit and pick up your pen and write and and he said notice the harmony of the father and the son. He said Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father. That's in John 5:19. He said this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. I want us to think about that. Ponder that for just a moment. He said this harmony, the kind of harmony that existed between the father and the son was now to exist between the groom and his bride. He said he shows her his word of life. She receives it. How many have received it this morning? She receives it. She never doubts it. Now there's a challenge to us. But he said this is what the bride would be and how she would act. He said therefore nothing can harm her, not even death. This is your future. This is what God spoke to brother Brandham. He said, 'What am I going to tell him about the future? He said there will be such a harmony between them and God. He said that nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. He said, here is the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. I want you to understand that Mary didn't have anything to do with the word being in her. Is that right? She she was just receptive to it. She said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Oh, if we could only be that way this morning. Be it unto me according to thy word. But she couldn't make the word come to pass. She just had to receive it and let it grow. And it grew to become the full word of God. And so we receive the word as a seed. He said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. I don't think we should worry. I don't think we should spend our lives spreading and and worried about what's going to happen. Say, "Well, the bride's not in very good shape. The message people are not in very good shape, and I see failure. I see all of these things." I don't think we should worry about those things because we we know that if God plants a seed, he's going to harvest a crop, &gt;&gt; right? He never he never had a a crop failure. He He's a He's a good farmer, if we could say it like that. He always harvests a crop from the seed that he plants. In fact, he says that he not one word would go out void. &gt;&gt; Not one word, if he ever spoke a word, that word will come to pass. If he ever planted the word in your heart, that word will become something. So, I want to encourage you today that the word that he's planted in your heart is going to become the fruit of God in your life. Oh, I'm so glad for that. Listen, if he gave you a word of healing, I know we've got some serious sickness around the church right now and we've got some people struggling with cancer and heart disease and different things and but listen to me. If he ever said, "I'm the God that health thee and he plants that word in your heart," then it's going to come to pass. It's got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world that could ever stop the program of God. I'm so thankful for that today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, he said she receives it and she doesn't doubt it. And the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the mind of Christ. I want us to focus on this now. For she knows what he wants done with the word. She has the mind of Christ. For she knows what he wants done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name. For she has thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. &gt;&gt; This is what he said. This is what your future is, &gt;&gt; right? This is what the bride's going to be after the seeds have been sown. This is harvest time. It's time for the rapture. Are you Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He said, "This is what the bride's going to have and does have." Now he said she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord. Then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. Now he he says we have the mind of Christ. Paul says that in 1 Corinthians 2:16, he said, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ. We have the mind of of Christ. Now, to have his mind, we have come to a new birth to get rid of the mind that we had and to accept the mind of Christ. Now, we know that the mind of the people today, like it was in Noah's day, is to do evil. and and and we just know that that's the way it is out in the world today. I don't have to tell you that. You know how it is. Brandon makes this statement. He said, "Oh, God, let me go, Lord." He said, "Don't leave me behind, Jesus. Let me go with you, Father." He He said, "I don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on." He said, "I don't want to stay here in this insanity." Now, watch that for just a moment. I don't want to stay here in this insanity. I don't want to stand here when hideous sightes people losing their mind. I I think we can stand here in 2025 and say the people have completely lost their minds. &gt;&gt; Right? He said, and I don't want to stand here in in that place. He said that we look at men, he said, trying to act like beasts and look like beasts &gt;&gt; and women trying to look like animals with pain on their face. &gt;&gt; We could stop there for a while, but there's a reason why Brother Brandham a prophet. And you say, "Why did brother Brandon preach against certain things as hard as he did, like makeup on women and and like men acting a certain way and acting feminine and women acting like men?" Why did he preach it so hard? Well, we're seeing the fruit of of a seed, a a a seed of discrepancy that was planted in that time. But the brand looks at the seed and said, "It's going to become a crop." &gt;&gt; Right? And we're living in the time when it's become a crop. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm thankful if there was a seed sown of discrepancy. There was also an original word seed that was sown at the same time and we're seeing the fruit of that seed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Said men and women trying to act look like that like animals. And that's just recent, isn't it? We've seen that in the schools and everywhere. Men and women trying to act like animals. &gt;&gt; Who'd have thought? &gt;&gt; In little towns, we see it. And and in small schools, we see it. And and you think how what? But it's an it's an influence. The devil has more influence over people's lives than he ever has because of modern technology and things. And he's got an influence over people's lives. Now, he said, knowing these things are predicted to happen that the thing will, he said, they'll go so insane till locust will raise up with hair like women to haunt the women, teeth like lions. That comes from the book of Revelation where it talks about those things. And he said, things that you said, the mental condition of the people will be completely gone. That's right. &gt;&gt; Completely gone. &gt;&gt; I want to say with brother Brandham this morning, "Oh God, don't let me stay here. I don't want to be here during the tri if it's this bad now. I don't want to be here during the tribulation period. I want to go home." &gt;&gt; He said, "We see it in the making right now. Lord, help us. Restore us to the sane mind of Christ Jesus our Lord." The sane mind. So the the mind that we have, the the sane mind, the mind that is not insane, the mind of the bride is the mind of Christ. And Paul says, "Let this mind be in you." Again, just to kind of show you what this is, Brother Brandham says, "Heavenly Father, search our hearts in this minute." He said, "It only takes a moment of time, a change." Oh my. Oh, church, if you've had another mind, now think about this for a minute. What causes sin in somebody's life? What causes a person to go into sin or to do something that would be against the word is because they have a mind of the world, &gt;&gt; a a mind of Satan. But if you could ever have the mind of Christ, &gt;&gt; right? And he said it only takes a moment of time, a change, &gt;&gt; he said, let the mind of Christ come into us. He said the Bible said, "Let the mind that was in Christ be in you." He said that changes our character. &gt;&gt; That changes our character. He said, "God, let the mind that was in Christ be in me. And if anywhere that I have failed to punctuate your word with an amen and then follow it out, then Lord, change me. Make me over." How many can have that same prayer this morning? Lord, I want that change to take place in my life where I'm no longer thinking like the world thinks, but I'm thinking like God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your mind is your character. Again, I know I'm laying a lot of things in here, but there's somewhere we want to go this morning. So, you just bear with me. I I hope you love the word today. That's that's all I can do. I heard brother Brandham say in a in a tape called Humble Thyself. And he said that he said what you need is a pastor who said that'll just feed the flock and won't try to just fix everything, change everything, but just feed the flock the word of God. I pray we can do that this morning. He said we've got to take the entire full gospel. We must. And now being that we have identified ourselves as full gospel people, he said let's mold our character. We're in. So, so we want all of the word. How many believe all of the word? &gt;&gt; If you're the bride, you can take all of the word. And so he said, we want to mold our character. Let's mold our character. He said, we're invited to be molded in his image. That's what he's saying. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. We're invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence. &gt;&gt; And the works that I do shall you do also. The life that I live, so shall you. We're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then when we let his character be in us, then we have become sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character. Your mind makes your character. Now I want now think about that deeply for a moment. So what you think about things is what you do about things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. It comes from your thought, &gt;&gt; right? And so if if your mind and this is why sin begins in the mind, &gt;&gt; right? It begins in the heart. It comes it come the desire of the heart becomes the thought of the mind and that begins that begins to take over your life. It becomes your character. &gt;&gt; But if you could ever let that mind get that mind right, then everything begins to work correctly. So your thoughts matter. So we don't want just our outside to look good. We want the inside to be right. And what what legalism does, this was the problem with the Pharisees. What legalism does is it makes the outside good, but it doesn't deal with the heart and it doesn't deal with the mind. It doesn't deal with the character of a person. It only deals with the outside part of a person. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham said it molds the character of a son of God. That word mind in the in the biblical Greek in the original is to think to form an opinion. Now you young people listen to me this morning because it's important because you're going to form opinions, &gt;&gt; right? And and we're going to say, "Well, I have an opinion about the word &gt;&gt; and maybe it's different from the opinion the pastor has, right? Or different from the opinion the church has." And that's okay. &gt;&gt; But it don't need to be different from the opinion of the word. &gt;&gt; All right? Right there you go. &gt;&gt; Right. The the opinion of the word matters. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So he said the bride would to have the mind of Christ is to have the opinion of Christ. The same opinion that he has about anything. It's to judge. This word mind is to judge. It's to describes the faculty of thinking, assessing and processing information. It it's holding an opinion. You'll find that in Acts 28:22 and Fleman 17. in uh certain context it can adopt a more intentional sense of setting one's mind on something. Paul warns his audience against setting their mind on earthly things. He encourages believers to think the same to be of the same mind. 2 Corinthians 13:11 he he warns people to think the same way. And that's what he's saying when he said, "Let this mind, I want you to think like Jesus thought." And the only way you can do that is by having the spirit of God in you &gt;&gt; to be able to do that. Otherwise, you won't think like Jesus thought. But he said, "I want you to think." He said, "I want you to think this way." &gt;&gt; So when Paul's saying, "Let this mind be in you." He's saying, "Have this opinion." &gt;&gt; So have this opinion. Think like this. &gt;&gt; Right? Are you following me so far? &gt;&gt; Think like this. Let this mind be in you. Now see, we could go to a lot of places and I don't want to apply it just yet, but there just to drop something in. Say, so the word says I should go to church. What's my opinion about that? I could have a lot of opinions, &gt;&gt; but he wants me to think like him &gt;&gt; about that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. The word says that I a woman shouldn't cut her hair. We could have a lot of opinions about what that means, but he wants us to think like he does. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Why why did he send a prophet in this age to show us what was in the back part of his mind? To show us how he thought about the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we can all have a different opinion and say, "Well, this is the way I think. This is what I think it ought to be. This is the way I think things ought to be done." But what does [screaming] the word say? It's not so much my opinion, but my opinion's got to be formed like his opinion was formed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Think about the word like he thinks about the word. &gt;&gt; Right? So let let's go to our text again. Philippians 2:5. He said, "Think like this. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." Look at the first thing he says. Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. Robbery is the word robbery is grasping something. So he wasn't grabbing something that wasn't his. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. He thought it not robbery to be equal with God. So it was not grasping for him to say that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said Jesus standing on earth. He knew where he stood. He knew who he was. &gt;&gt; He said, "I have power to lay my life down. I have power to take it up again. No uncertainty about that. I have Hallelujah. I now have the power to lay it down. I have the power to take it up. No one holdeth me. So what what's he saying? He he knew that he could come down from the cross. He could he could have called 10,000 angels. He could do those things. He had the power to do it. And yet he laid his life down because that was the opinion. That was his mind about the word was to do the will of the father. So he submitted himself. He knew who he was and he submitted himself. This is very important. As Christians, we've got to know who we are &gt;&gt; or we can't properly submit ourselves to the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. There's things I might tell you to ask you to do or or tell you to do or or say you should do this. My opinion would only mean so much. But to my wife, it means something else. &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz she's my wife. &gt;&gt; So my opinion has a different impact. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? My opinion has a different impact on my wife because of relationship. She knows who she is. She's Mrs. Benjamin Puit. When the bride recognizes who she is, &gt;&gt; brother Bram said the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; When the bride recognizes what what is it? There's got to be something in us that we recognize. I am the wife of Jesus Christ. I belong to him. He He brought me out of darkness. He brought me out of a deep mit. How many could say amen to that this morning? He's given me a new mind, a new way of thinking about the word. And so what do I need to do? If I belong to him, then I need to listen to him. His word means more to me. Well, I know there's a lot of people the word don't mean nothing to them. But to us as the bride, the word ought to mean everything to us. &gt;&gt; Look, he said, I have power. He said there was no uncertainty about that. I have Hallelujah. I now have power to lay it down. He said, "Any man or woman that's born of the spirit of God knows where they stand." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what takes place or how many says yes or no, they know where they stand. I've told you before, but a preacher didn't put me in the message. A preacher can't take me out. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Your pastor might not might disagree with you on something that don't put you out of the message. Why? If you're in the message and the message is in you, you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the earth. You belong to God. No matter how far you might run, no matter how how far you might go into sin, he's going to get you. He's going to get a hold of you cuz you were predestined for ordained from the beginning. I'm so grateful for that today. &gt;&gt; You are. You need to know who you are. &gt;&gt; If you're going to have the mind of Christ, you've got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There can't be this idea. So, well, I believe the message is right about most things, and yet I've got this other side. Well, I think the world has a point, too. Right. That can't be the way it is. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, he said he said he knew who he was, therefore he had faith. And if you have time, go listen to perfect faith. Brother Brandham dwells on that how Jesus knew who he was. He said he knew who he was, therefore he had faith. Faith could produce. He said when he knowed who what he was, he said, "If you abide in me and my word in you, then you know who you are. or ask what you will, it will be given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus told him, he said, "Destroy this temple in three days, I'll raise it up." Why was he able to have that confidence in the word? See, that's what we need is confidence in the word. &gt;&gt; Our young people need confidence in the word. &gt;&gt; When you go to school, when you go to work, you Why do you dress the way you do? Why do you act the way you do? Because I believe the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And there needs to be a confidence in that word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. I'm I'm going to go in a rapture one day. &gt;&gt; The devil can't discourage me. He can't put a spirit of suicide on me or a spirit of making me think I'm unworthy all the time. I know I'm unworthy, but he called me. I know who I am. I know where I belong. I know what I know what the what place I hold in the position of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up." &gt;&gt; What kind of confidence could we have in the word if we knew that we were Mrs. Jesus Christ. If he knew he was Mr. Jesus Christ, he was the one that would raise from the dead, then we know if we are in him, we'll raise with him. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also." Someone say, "Also, it'll also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you." What's he saying? If he raised him up, he'll raise you up. You don't have to give up on the word to have a good life. You don't have to have to compromise with the world to have a victorious life. You can have the mind of Christ and know what he wants done with the word. &gt;&gt; I believe the bride has that today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a lot of people need healing right now. Listen, the Bible says we're already healed. &gt;&gt; He said by his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; But can you know who you are today? Can you get a revelation of that? Say by his stripes I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am healed. I belong in that scripture. That's having the mind of Christ. He knew who he was. He thought in not robbery. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He wasn't taking something that didn't belong to him. &gt;&gt; Oh church, if we could only recognize who we are, it's not robbery for you to be the bride. It's not it's not a boasting for you to say that you're the wife of Jesus Christ, that you belong to him. That's just who you are. &gt;&gt; It's just who you are. You didn't make yourself that. He made you that. &gt;&gt; You didn't put yourself in the word. It wasn't by study and theological books and everything else to put you in it. No, you you understand the word the way you do because he called you from the foundation of the world to understand it. &gt;&gt; Right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Then our confidence doesn't lay in a preacher or a church or a situation, but it lays in Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, what does he say? He tells us that if we have the mind of Christ, [snorts] we've got to condescend to others. See, he recognized who he was. He thought it not robbery, equal [snorts] with God, but we condescend. That word condescend is interesting. Paul uses it in Romans 12:16. He said, "Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. condescend. Now, when we think of someone that's condescending, that's a negative thing, right? &gt;&gt; Right. He's condescending means you're up here and they're down here and you're talking down to somebody. &gt;&gt; But that's not what he's [snorts] talking about. It's not talking down. It's coming down. &gt;&gt; Right? Coming down. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you can hear me today. &gt;&gt; So, it's not that you're up here saying, "Well, I'm the bride. I belong to a message church and these people are struggling and so I I'm going to stand up here and talk down to them and have a little pity on them, you know? No, it's coming down, &gt;&gt; right? Because the thing is we're human beings. And I think God leaves us this way. There's a certain element of humanity in everything that we do, even in our preaching. Even, you know, how I feel affects how I preach. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, people don't want to believe that people are human, but it's true. How you feel affects how you preach. How you feel affects how you sing. You know that's right. When you come to church, how you feel. Your attitude before you get to church affects the service. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And how you feel. If you're sick, if you're worried, if you're tired, it affects the service. You got to fight through that. &gt;&gt; And but there's a certain amount of that. Our humanity reminds us, listen, that's why Jesus was made a man. He was a great high priest who could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. &gt;&gt; We're human beings. We're not we're not a bunch of super men. We're not some great and listen, we read the message of what he says about what the bride will be. And many times we look at that and say, "Well, we're going to be some kind of superman that's able to just speak everything and and we won't have any trouble with money and we won't have any trouble with our kids and we won't have any trouble with sickness." But that's not what he said at all. &gt;&gt; That's not who Jesus was. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he healed he raised a sick baby from the dead and went back and sat on a rock and groaned with a headache. &gt;&gt; Why? He was human being just like you and I are. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And so many times we're reminded of our humanity because it allows us to condescend. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Not to talk down to somebody, but to come down to somebody &gt;&gt; to find that person that's weak or weary or been or made horrible choices and done horrible things and not to look down on them. Not to say, "Well, they could never be a Christian." But to say, "The same God that brought me up out of the pit can bring you up out of the pit. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Have this mind. He says, have the mind that allows you to come down &gt;&gt; where people are. &gt;&gt; It's to willingly lower oneself out of love and compassion to help someone in an inferior condition. Oh my. Philippians 2:7 says, "He made himself." It's one of the most touching things you can read in the scripture. He made himself of no reputation. &gt;&gt; Made himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Think about that. He created himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No reputation. &gt;&gt; Yes. took upon him the form the the mask the morphe of a servant was made in the likeness of men. See he he was in the form of God with the attributes of God but he chose to take on the form of a servant with the attributes of a servant. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Right? When he came down, he didn't come down as a baby knowit-all, &gt;&gt; right? He didn't come down as a baby who could talk. &gt;&gt; He come down as a baby who cried. &gt;&gt; He didn't come down into our world into a rich palace somewhere. He didn't arrange the details so that he would enter our world in a strong way but in a weak way. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And he made himself in the form of a servant. He became weak to save the weak. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And when he was on earth, the Bible said, he made himself no reputation. Yet he was the creator. &gt;&gt; Look at Colossians 1:16. For by him were all things. Someone say all things &gt;&gt; created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him. So he created God did the situation. I hope you're hearing me today that he would be born into the earth in he created the details of life that he would come down and dwell among us in. He created that situation &gt;&gt; to be a certain way. &gt;&gt; Now, all of us do that to some extent. We're we're miniature creators. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And we create our situation of life. &gt;&gt; We do that. How how do we do it? Well, we do it with our words. We know that the spoken word, but we do it in other ways as well. You men work. Many of you, some of you ladies have to, you work and you're out and you try to do things and and you try to create an environment around you that would be fitting that you'd want to live in, &gt;&gt; right? So, you get yourself a chair. My wife's been trying to get me to buy another lazy boy because we only have one. You know, why would we do that? Why spend the money on a on a good chair? Because it's comfortable. There's nothing better than a lazy boy. I can vouch for it. But you know, if you if you what are we doing? We're creating an environment that's comfortable, &gt;&gt; right? We could live with less. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. All of us could, &gt;&gt; but we want the best for ourselves &gt;&gt; now. Come on. We're human, right? &gt;&gt; We want the best for ourselves. We want an air conditioned car. We want an upgraded truck, &gt;&gt; right? With all the bells and whistles. I got my truck and I'm I'm sitting there looking at my truck one day and I realized that the back of the new truck split in two and mine didn't have that option and I've been wanting that ever since. And Trip's got a truck with a handle on it and a step like an old grandpa, you know, and I need that handle in that step. [laughter] What am I doing? Creating myself a world to live in &gt;&gt; on a human level. You understand? &gt;&gt; Right. But what what is what are we what did Jesus do? He who had all the power to create any situation &gt;&gt; to control every situation and make it come to pass &gt;&gt; chose to be born. &gt;&gt; Chose to be born in poverty. Chose to come into the world and have to learn things. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He chose to learn obedience by the things that he suffered. When he took on flesh, he chose not to be like a god &gt;&gt; but to be like a man. &gt;&gt; Just think brother Brandham said who he was. He was the logos that come from God in the beginning. He was the word of God. He was the angel of God that was with the children of Israel in the wilderness. He was the great supernatural of heaven. None other than Jehovah himself had come down here on the earth and become a man. Not only a man, but he become the servant of man. took upon himself a make of no reputation, &gt;&gt; but become a footwasher. &gt;&gt; And he went to the lowest city in the world, Jericho. I love this. He said he was so low till the smallest man of the city had to climb a tree to look at him. To look down at him. &gt;&gt; Jesus looked up at the tree and said, "Zakius." Oh, he had to get in a position beneath Zakius to save Zakius. He had to come in the form of a man. He had to come as the lowest of men. He had to come in the form of a footwash flunk. He had to come in the form of a servant to save me and save you. Oh, we ought to worship him like never before. &gt;&gt; We ought to worship him every day of the week, not just at Christmas time or on the uh some holiday or even on Sundays. We ought to worship him because our life should be worshiped to him &gt;&gt; because of what he did for us. God raised him up, put him so high above every heaven until he has to stoop over to look to heaven. Oh my. That's what God did for him. He said, "So if you want to be exalted, &gt;&gt; humble yourself. If you exalt yourself, you'll be brought down low." &gt;&gt; Right? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Again, he said Jesus went along doing good, going to the poor and needy. He never made of himself any reputation. Do you ever think of that? He made himself of no reputation. Listen to this is astounding. The man that made an artificial tooth &gt;&gt; made a reputation for himself. &gt;&gt; He did. Now, you may not know his name, but you can go on the internet and find it, &gt;&gt; right? There's a man who first made the artificial tooth, and he still has a Wikipedia page, &gt;&gt; but Jesus didn't Oh, God. He didn't have anybody sitting there writing, recording every moment. We don't even know very few things about his first 12 years of life. And then there's another several years before he turned 30. We don't know hardly anything about what he was doing. He didn't have somebody there recording every moment of his life. &gt;&gt; Why? He come with no reputation. &gt;&gt; He made himself, oh God, of no reputation. Listen, I know this is the age of making yourself a reputation. I know this is the age of a social media account and putting yourself out there. and our young people, we want to have the most likes and and be out there and have a tick tock thing that works or something. And God bless you if you can make that work for you. But that should not be the goal of our life. It should not control our emotions. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Jesus made himself of no reputation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; His what do they call that? The Q factor. Right. That's what that the the ability to be known. What's your Q factor? Jesus come with a zero. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Known by nobody. &gt;&gt; There were only brother Brandham, I think he said six. There were six or eight believers in that time. &gt;&gt; Just a very few that he could come to and tell him who he was. &gt;&gt; And then the shepherds and the magi and different ones come. But there was a very few who believed. &gt;&gt; Even when he died, by the time he died, even his disciples forsook him. &gt;&gt; They left him there. Even Peter who said, "I'll never leave you." &gt;&gt; Oh my. And Jesus said, "You'll deny me three times." Then he does. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He died alone on the cross. &gt;&gt; The man who made an artificial tooth made a reputation. But the one who made the real tooth made of himself no reputation. &gt;&gt; The man that made an artificial arm made a reputation for himself. &gt;&gt; But the man who made the real arm made of himself no reputation. &gt;&gt; He said, "The way up is down." Always remember that. Be humble. Be sweet and kind. Amen. That's part of the word, too, right? &gt;&gt; Listen now. He said, "Be creative." &gt;&gt; You're creating something. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you wallow in self-pity, you create an atmosphere of self-pity. &gt;&gt; If you wallow in sin, you create an atmosphere of sin. Right? &gt;&gt; If you're if you spend your mind and your time on those things, but if you let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, you create an atmosphere of creation. He said, "Be creative. Let Christ be in you. Be sweet. Be kind." He wasn't telling you to to take up photography or start to draw or do an artist. That's fine. If you do, that's creative the way we think about it. But he's saying be a creator. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Be creative. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let Christ be in you. Let this mind, &gt;&gt; the creative mind. So I he said, I want you to create, but I want you to create what he created. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want you to create a reputation. Church, as a church, we ought to have a reputation. &gt;&gt; What reputation should we have? The reputation that he had. &gt;&gt; He made himself of no reputation. He made himself not seem like a a big thing. Oh, I hope we hold on to that. I know we're we're not a huge church and we're not for a message church. We're not a really small church, but I'll say this. We've created no reputation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; There there's no reputation in going to Word of Life Tabernacle. But I'll say this. I believe that in doing that, we can help somebody. If we can just keep oursel with no reputation, if we keep oursel with nothing to lose, then we're not afraid to reach out to the vilest sinner and bring them back up. [snorts] &gt;&gt; If you create yourself a reputation, let it be the reputation he created. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, Christ created the conditions, &gt;&gt; think about this, &gt;&gt; that made him the story go out that he was an illegitimate child. He created that. &gt;&gt; And we get mad if people call us a cult or something like that. &gt;&gt; That's what they called him, too. &gt;&gt; Far worse. &gt;&gt; Right. They called him an illegitimate child &gt;&gt; cuz they thought that there was no way that what that that he was born of the Holy Ghost. They thought &gt;&gt; that he was a an illegitimate child. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that now. Think honestly with me. If you could create yourself a reputation, &gt;&gt; what would it be? We all have a reputation of some kind, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But brother Paul, if you could create one, &gt;&gt; what would it be? &gt;&gt; I think we're learning that on social media. &gt;&gt; It's like an experiment in sociology or psychology where people are creating reputations for themselves. Right? And even some of them creating reputations of of illegitimacy and reputations of of adultery and reputations of of evil, &gt;&gt; right? And they do it on purpose, &gt;&gt; like a rapper. I'm not talking about something you wrap gifts in. I'm talking about the guys who get up and say things and call it music, &gt;&gt; right? A rapper has to have a reputation. Boy, I've gone way a field in this sermon. A a rapper has to have a reputation. He He's got So they'll get in trouble with the law almost on purpose &gt;&gt; to have a reputation of being a bad guy &gt;&gt; cuz that's how they sell CDs or whatever it is they sell now, right? That's how they sell records is is to they're creating themselves a reputation. What kind of reputation ought we to have? Well, I think we ought to have the same reputation he did. The same he made himself of no reputation. to be able to reach us. &gt;&gt; So he tells us to be creative. But what would we create if we had the opportunity? If you had unlimited power, &gt;&gt; how powerful would you be? &gt;&gt; Some of y'all would be the pastor. &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you ladies, if you had unlimited power in the kitchen, what kind of a cook would you be? Move aside, Bobby Fle. You know, Huh? Now, come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to use an older reference for some of y'all, but but what kind of a create what kind of a reputation would you create? You realize that's why we in our sticky natures, we we get mad at each other. Most of the time, it's a it's a fight for reputation. &gt;&gt; It's one person fussing with another about reputation. I want to be known as the best cook &gt;&gt; or the one in charge or or the best preacher. &gt;&gt; Preachers can be the worst. &gt;&gt; Right? Creating ourselves reputations. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we we're afraid to even listen to somebody preach because that would hurt our reputation to go and listen to a man preach. &gt;&gt; We're afraid to go preach somewhere. I'm just preaching my heart this morning &gt;&gt; because it would hurt our reputation. But Jesus went down to Simon's house even though he knew they were there to make fun of him. But he went down because there was a woman there with no reputation &gt;&gt; who would wash his feet &gt;&gt; who could be saved who had representation in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could create yourself a reputation as a fisherman, &gt;&gt; what kind of a reputation would you create? I I feel this like deeply &gt;&gt; because I love to fish. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to let you in on something. I'm not very good at it. &gt;&gt; But I love to fish. You didn't have to agree with me. I love to fish and I'd love, you know, and I don't post all the little ones. And you know that's right, Trip. You know, I went with trip fishing one time and when I went fishing, he didn't care much about the fish, but I went fishing and and and and we don't we catch all them little bitty trout. We don't post none of them, but let me catch one of them trout that get released from the hatchery, you know? That's the one I post. &gt;&gt; If I could create myself, I want you to think about this this morning. If I could create myself a reputation as a fisherman, what would my reputation be? Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. It'd be Bill Dance or, you know, whoever is the fisherman now that people look up to. &gt;&gt; See, if you could create a reputation as a hunter, &gt;&gt; I used fishing first so I wouldn't make you so mad, you know. But if you could create a reputation, what would it be? Oh my. Well, that's why you buy all the stuff, right? That's why I have so many fishing poles. I want to create a reputation. Most of them I've never used, &gt;&gt; but I want to create a reputation as a fisherman. &gt;&gt; You want to create a reputation as a hunter. But when he came down, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; oh God, he was he was it was the almighty God who poured himself. The B said, "All that was in God, he poured into Christ." &gt;&gt; God poured himself out in the earth. It was a man with no reputation. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. See, the reputation that you would create for yourself speaks of your character and maybe how long you've lived because some people live long enough to realize that reputation ain't everything. &gt;&gt; And maybe you don't want to be known by everybody and fame has its consequences, right? &gt;&gt; So maybe you've lived long enough to understand that, but a lot of people haven't. But the reputation you would create for yourself speaks of your character. You create what you are. I'm going to go real deep here for a minute, but I hope you I hope you get a hold of a little bit of it. Look, in the third pull, when it come to when it come to the earth in the spoken word in that form to show us the power of what the word could do, &gt;&gt; right? Brother Brandham said the first time it was ever on a gentile woman was on a hady right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It couldn't have been on a preacher. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because a preacher would have created a reputation with it. I hope you're hearing me, church. &gt;&gt; Now, God brought brother Brandham's through some things so that he would be at a place where he could he could do that and he could work in that realm, but he's wanted to bring us all to that place. Not to brother Brandham's gift, but to that level of faith, &gt;&gt; right? But when he come to a woman, what did he come to? He come, brother Brandham says he did it on purpose. He said he had to come to somebody who would say the right thing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Her reputation was so little. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that she didn't care what people thought &gt;&gt; about her following a divine healer. Yet, her sister was sick &gt;&gt; and sat in church for years unable to be healed. And that may have created a bad reputation. Her her lack of money, her lack of resources might have created no reputation for her. She might have not been able to do anything, but she's famous around the world today, not for having money, not even for having her healing, but she's famous around the world because she created of herself no reputation. And when the word spoke to her, she said, "It's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; So, what is humility? It's humbling yourself to the word &gt;&gt; until when the word speaks, you can say, "I know you're right, Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She said, "It's nothing but the truth." And what happened? She was able to speak because God knew that what she would create &gt;&gt; wouldn't be money. Come on. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I've often told you &gt;&gt; if I could heal everybody in our church and we could all just be well all the time, I would do it. &gt;&gt; I hate to see people suffer. I don't want to see people hurt. &gt;&gt; I want to see you well. I want to see you doing good. If I could create money in your bank accounts, I'd do it. &gt;&gt; But there's a reason why God doesn't give me that power. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Money wouldn't do us all the good we might think it would do. Now, even healing, sometimes it wouldn't do us the good that we think it would do. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get in a little better situation and we forget about God. &gt;&gt; We get a little bit of money and we begin to forget about God. But oh, if we could only humble ourselves to the word, Lord, no matter what kind of a reputation I have, no matter how much money I've got or don't have, let me be willing to bow myself to your word. Let me be willing to worship you. Let me be willing to come to church and condescend myself, lower myself to help a sinner somewhere, to help the family member that's been lost. Let me be willing to do that. [snorts] &gt;&gt; We will just close when it gets time. I don't have time to get through everything, but [snorts] the mind of Christ was to condescend to come down. &gt;&gt; The mind of Lucifer was to lift himself up. Right? Isaiah 14:13. For thou hast said in thine heart. Notice this is his mindset. I will ascend into heaven. I [snorts] will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit. What is it? One mind condescends and is lifted up. Another is to is to be lifted up. That's his mind is to be lifted up. And he's brought low. &gt;&gt; But the mind of Christ is to lower yourself for the sake of someone else. Look at Ezekiel chapter 21. Ezekiel 21:25. It says, "Thou profane, wicked prince of Israel." He's talking about a king of Israel. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're a profane, wicked prince whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end." &gt;&gt; Now, I believe he's speaking of more than just a natural king, but the god of this evil age. Right. He said, "Thus sayith the Lord God, remove the diadem. Take off the crown. This shall not be the same. Exalt him that is low. Abase him that is high." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He said, "You're going to lose your crown because of your attitude. You're going to lose your crown because of the mindset that you have." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. Paul said, "Take heed. He that standeth, take heed lest he fall." You can't fall unless you're standing up, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be careful not to be lifted up in our minds, but to condescend, to bring ourselves down low, and to recognize, yeah, we know who we are. We know we're the bride. We've got confidence in the word, but we have no confidence in the flesh. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The mind of Christ to lower yourself for the sake of someone else. Look, he said, "Take off the crown. Exalt him that is low. Obase him that is high. I will overturn overturn overturn [snorts] I don't know I don't I didn't find brother brother Brandham said anything about it I know the commentaries say that that speaking of the three overturns of the of the house of Israel there was three different times that the that the kingdom was taken away be restored and taken away again restored and finally taken away for the final time he said and it shall be no more but I love this until he come &gt;&gt; whose right it is &gt;&gt; I'll give it to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, you made yourself a reputation. You put a crown on your head. You wanted to be lifted up above the people, but he said, I'm not going to give you the crown. I'm going to take the crown away from you. I'll overturn it. I'll overturn it. Listen, you might have thought a lot of things about yourself. You might have thought, well, I'm going to do this in life or I'm going to do that in life. But there's coming a time he's going to overturn that thinking. But he said, I'll give it to one whose right it is, and I'll give it to him. Listen, Jesus, it was his right to be the son of David. It was his right to be king. But how did he obtain the kingship? By coming down in our world, by lowering himself, coming as a servant, putting on a servant's mask. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, what is humility? What [snorts] is the mind of Christ? It's not taking your rights. [snorts] It's having rights and not taking your rights, but taking what he gives you. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Philippians 2:9, wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name. We're supposed to be like him. How many want to be like him this morning? &gt;&gt; He said in 1 Peter 5:5, "Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves under the elder. Hey, all of you be subject one to another." All of you be subject one to another. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you do that? You recognize that a pastor is an authority in the church. Deacons are in authority in the church, but the way that you exercise that authority is not by exercising lordship, but by exercising servantthood, &gt;&gt; right? It's the proper posture of the pastor to be a servant to the people. It's the proper posture of the deacons, to be a servant of the people or the trustees or whoever else. You're not there to tell people what to do. You're there to be a servant to people. &gt;&gt; Even though you have a right. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But you're there to help. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:5, "You're younger, submit yourself to the elder. All you be subjects one to another, and be clothed with humility. For God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to [snorts] the humble." Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon him, &gt;&gt; for he carth for you. Yes. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, in not claiming our rights, we're not just talking about so, well, I have a right to this, to to dress this way or to act this way. You do, but you give up your rights to be a sheep, right? To be shorn. You give up your rights to be taken into the to the church and all that shorn off of you, right? and and and brother Brandham talks about that many times, but it's not just that, but it's it's actually your right to think a certain way, your right to think about yourself a certain way. Lord, let me think about myself the way you think about me. &gt;&gt; So, it's your right to pity yourself. Your right to have a a pity party. Your right to to stand there and say, "Well, nobody loves me and everybody hates me." No, I'm going to think like the word thinks. I'm going to talk like the word talks. I'm going to be what the word says I can be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You're you're giving away your rights for the rights of another, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For his rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Listen, brother said, "So just love him with all your heart and forget all you ever know about all other things but Jesus Christ." How many could do that this morning? Forget all you ever know about all other things but Jesus Christ. Just go ahead and love him and work for him. serve him. If he wants you to be the doormat, well, you just be the doormat. It's whatever he wants you to do, you do it. How many can say amen to that today? &gt;&gt; He said, you know, people want power really. They don't know what power is. See, they don't really know what goes with it. The way up is down always. If you want power, see how humble you can get. &gt;&gt; Get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God, and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building, makes a big lot of noise. See, because you've been able to conquer yourself. commit yourself to Christ, you see, to humble yourself before him. That's really power. &gt;&gt; You show me a church. &gt;&gt; We all want to be a church, don't we? That's that that's strong. We want to be a strong church. We want to be a church that's that's known for our strength. But look what he says. You show me a church that's humble. Show me a church that's real humble, not an arrogancy, a church, just a sweet, humble church. I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it. Listen, everybody wants to testify. We've had many healings. We've testified of our healing. We've had many people come to the come to church and be saved and be baptized. We're glad of that. But I'll say this that we don't want that to be our reputation, but let our reputation be a humble church, a sweet church, somebody that could love somebody. He said, "I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it. I want his favor today. I want his mind to be in me. &gt;&gt; [snorts and sighs] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. That's the thing. It takes [snorts] humility, humbling ourselves before God, letting God just work through us. Don't have to make a lot of noise. I believe in noise. I believe in revival. But be humble at first. &gt;&gt; Be sweet first." What are some real examples of a creator [snorts] condescending? Can I have I got three more minutes. Can I have that three minutes? &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Can we? Maybe four. Somebody give me five. [snorts] [laughter] She gave me five. I'll be all right. Brother Brandham illustrated that for us, right? You talked about being a creator and then it the famous story that all of our sisters love so much about. But brother Brandon putting on an apron, but what was that? See, he had two things he could do about that situation. See, he can change it in two ways. &gt;&gt; One of two ways. He can be a lord, right? Sarah called Abraham Lord. He can be a lord in his house and tell her what to do. &gt;&gt; Or [snorts] he can humble himself. A lot of marriages break up because somebody's not willing to humble themselves, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe even if you have a right to be offended &gt;&gt; or a right to be mad, you just choose not to &gt;&gt; because you love that person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no doubt that brother Brandham's work at that time was was so important, right? He was a prophet of God. People were laying sick and unable to come in and the house was in a chaos, &gt;&gt; right, because of his work. &gt;&gt; But he willingly, right, took on the mind of Christ, the nature of Christ, condescended to put an apron on and help her with the dishes, &gt;&gt; pat her on the back, tell her he'd buy her a new dress. &gt;&gt; It's like, but brother Ben, that's putting on. No, it's not. It's lowering yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To think like a woman would think. Are you with me now? He had to think like she would think. Listen, when brother Brandham and and and me were having trouble with Rebecca, Brother Brandham told her, "We've got to think teenage thoughts." &gt;&gt; Right? For a lot of us old people, we got young people here in the church. We're We got a bunch of them. &gt;&gt; A lot of them aren't here today. We got a bunch of them. All these young people, we're going to have to think young thoughts. To be able to reach those young people, you got to think like a young person. &gt;&gt; You can't always think like a old person. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But maybe you've been in a place, maybe you were raised in a better time when the world wasn't like it is today and social media wasn't crazy and people actually were sane. You remember those times, but can you condescend yourself down to be able to help somebody today? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He had a right to be served, &gt;&gt; but he chose to serve. Brother Brandon said it was projecting love. He said they were mine, my children, my wife, and I was God's. And then God giving his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family, sovereign grace came in and quietened the family. Part of our job as ministers is to quieten the church. I don't mean to [snorts] make it people not shout or something like that. That's not what I'm talking about. To quieten the nerves, &gt;&gt; right? Like cuz sheep get nervous when they can't see the shepherd. &gt;&gt; So part of the job as a minister, especially as a pastor, is to just be there. Some of y'all going to come back at me say, "Brother Ben, you're gone sometimes." s and sometimes we do have to go but but my job mainly is to be present &gt;&gt; right and and why because that quietens the church a husband's job is to be present in the home because it quiet but listen to me there's a greater presence &gt;&gt; and he comes down brother Joe in our midst &gt;&gt; brother said that that feeling that we have is him he said you can't see see the pillar of fire all the time but you can feel its effects You can feel the presence of it. And that presence that you feel is him. He comes down on our level. &gt;&gt; Comes down to fellowship. Oh, I don't think we ought to take it for granted, church. I think we ought to worship him when he comes. &gt;&gt; I think we ought to give him all the glory and all the praise and all the things that because he's given us so many things and he's come down among us to just stay with us and his presence quietens me. Listen, I can be going through a hard time. I can be at my wit's end, not know what to do as a pastor, but when his presence comes down, what does it do? It quietens my nerves. And the great shepherd, don't you want him to be present? &gt;&gt; Don't you want him to be in the home? Oh, let's invite him in our home. Let's invite him in the church. &gt;&gt; Think like him. &gt;&gt; Who had a right to be served [snorts] but chose to serve. As I've preached to you recently, we're often within our rights to be offended. But what if we just chose not to take offense? &gt;&gt; We're condescending. [snorts] We may have a right to a bad attitude. What if we changed our attitude for the sake of others? &gt;&gt; It's the greatest sign of maturity in a young person, especially one that's getting a little bit older, looking for a spouse. The greatest sign of maturity is you you get somebody who willingly does things for others. at no benefit to themselves. &gt;&gt; Find somebody who is a cheerful giver of their time, their abilities. Find somebody who's doing working in the church, doing everything they can for the kingdom of God. And you'll find somebody who's worth marrying. Why? Because it's a sign of maturity. It's a sign that the mind of Christ has become in them, begin to work its way out in character. 1 Corinthians 13 tells us that and I'll just read one of these verses, but it tells us that uh love or charity seeketh not her own. Verse 5, seeketh not her own. It means love does not insist on having its own way. And brother Brandham said he was that great attribute of God called love. Oh my. Listen, we have a right to look after our own affairs. But Paul says, "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others." We got a [snorts] right to look after our own affairs. But he said, "Look on others affairs." Galatians 5:13, "For," brethren, you've been called unto liberty. Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another. To bite and devour is the nature of a wolf, but a lamb gives up it right to bite. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, wolves fight for who's going to be the leader. That's how they choose their next leader is they fight it out. That shouldn't be the way Christians operate. &gt;&gt; We don't fight it out about who gets to be this or that in the church. What do we do? We lay ourselves down. &gt;&gt; Lord, whatever you want me to do, that's what I want to do. &gt;&gt; What did he do with the word? That's what he wants done with the word. You realize that &gt;&gt; what he once done with the word is what he did with the word. &gt;&gt; He was the word and he laid himself down. Brother Brandham talks about it in in uh that [snorts] day on Calvary and I won't read it to save time but you can go back and look at it. He said eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; He said how can you let people call you such bad names? How can you do those things? He said eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus did. That's his mind. And that's what he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; We don't just think about ourselves. &gt;&gt; You realize the point if we carry it so far, all we think about our is ourselves. Eventually, we're just going to be sitting at home in our lazy boy all the time. &gt;&gt; That's just all we'll ever do. &gt;&gt; Because we're just thinking about ourselves. Selfishness destroys relationships. It destroys churches. And it'll destroy your walk with God. if we could only give ourselves up to him. &gt;&gt; He said, "You sacrifice your own things. Give them up like the sheep gives its wool and look on towards Calvary." He said, "We must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ." And he made the way. Musicians, go ahead and come. He made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him. If we follow him, we lead the life that he lived. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let this mind be in you. [snorts] Let let this mind, this mind, this way of thinking, &gt;&gt; who thought it not robbery, right, to be equal with God, who knew who he was, [snorts] knew he was the bride or knew he was the groom, rather. He knew that he was the one who would die for our sins. He knew who he was. He knew he'd be raised again on the third day. He knew that. Oh my." He knew that he wouldn't suffer. He wouldn't suffer his holy one to see corruption. He knew what the word said about himself and he believed that word. &gt;&gt; We know he's our healer. How many know that today? We know he's our healer. We know he's our savior. We know he's our God. &gt;&gt; We know we belong to him. Let this mind be in you who having that knowledge will not elevate themselves above others, but will reach out to the people at work and the people in your town and the people around you. Be a help to your community. God didn't call us to be a bunch of a cult that pulls off in the woods somewhere. He called us to live in a place in a place where there's people. He called us to be around people and to be in a place where we'd have to work and we'd have to do things. Why? Because he wants us to be a light. You are the light of the world. Let this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who humbled himself to the word written about him. [snorts] And by that came the resurrection of the dead. I hope it made sense this morning. I I'm not much of a preacher, but I try to hope it made sense. I know some people think, "Well, Brother Ben, if you'd hammer this or you'd hammer that, the church would be better off." I think if we'd each one just take the mind of Christ, we'd be better off. Let this mind be in you who chose not to answer back. That's a hard one, isn't it? when they lied about him, they said, "He's a he's done this [music] and he's done that and he said not a word. He didn't defend himself. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who humbled himself in such a way that he said,"Lord, if they're saying it, there must be a reason for it. If they're persecuting me, there must be a reason for it. If things are the way they are, there must be a reason for it. Oh, how wonderful it is when a person has godliness with contentment. Paul said it's great gain. Why? Because we can actually reach a place where Lord, if I'm in this condition or in this place, maybe I don't have much money, but Lord, you called me to be here and I believe I'm going to do everything I can for the kingdom of God. Lord, I believe you won't let the meal run out. You won't let the oil run dry. You're going to prepare a way. Let me humble myself to the word. Listen to me. So many times we're waiting on God to do something for us so we can make a move towards him. Well, why don't we make the move? Let let let God let God provide in such a way. I believe he's a provider today. He's a supernatural God. Make a move towards him. I don't mean naturally. I mean spiritually. Make a move in your life. Say, "Lord, I'm going to commit myself to you. Surrender myself to you and let you work in my life." How many can say amen to that today? Hallelujah. Let's power our [music] heads together. Oh Jesus. Maybe there's someone here like to slip up your hand and say, "Brother Ben, I I want this mind to be in me that was in Christ. I want to have that humility, that godliness. I want to have that love. All those seven virtues that we've spoken of. God bless those hands. That's my desire. I want that. I want that to be manifested in my life. I'm a preacher, but let me be a Christian first. These people are you people are are Christians, but you're message people, but first be a Christian before you're a deacon or a trustee. You're an officer in the church. Be a real Christian. Be loving, caring, kind. Lord, help us today. Oh God, I pray that you'd move today. We thank you for your word. Thank you for your goodness to us. I pray that you'd move in a mighty way, Lord. If there's one here that's Lord that needs to be saved, I pray you'd reach down. You reach down for me, Lord. I pray you'd reach way down, Lord. Condescend to that soul today and knock on their heart's door. Lord, if there's one here that needs, Lord, a further revelation of your word, I pray you'd give it to them. there's one or that needs a true baptism of the Holy Ghost. I pray, oh God, you'd fill them with the Holy Ghost today. Lord, I pray you'd you'd bring your mind on us, oh God, by your word. How do we know your mind by the message of the hour? I pray you'd help us to receive it, to accept it. I thank you for it today. Not to fight with it or to think we know better, but Lord, just to receive it. I pray that you'd grant it now. We thank you for all that you do. I pray that you'd heal the sick. I think especially of Sister Lana's mother this morning, Lord, and they're in the hospital and Lord, them not being able to be in church for a while now. And I know it can get discouraging, but Lord, I pray you'd reach down, oh God. Lord, no one wants to get that diagnosis at at a young age, but Lord, we're believing that you're a God.
