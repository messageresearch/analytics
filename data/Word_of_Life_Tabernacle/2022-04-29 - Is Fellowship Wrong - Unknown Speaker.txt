========================================

now saul identified himself with samuel he says i'm with the prophet and he took a yoke of oxen and hewd him in pieces and and said whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel and the fear of the lord fell on the people on brother branham as we read said the people came out of fear of samuel many men have went out preaching using brother branham's name to get the people to follow them yes sir right because of some association they had with him when he was alive they did it when he was alive sure right brother branham tells how difficult the ministry was because others wanted to use his name to draw crowds and he said this way he said many times they fixed an auditorium advertising the paper i'm the bee said i don't even know nothing about it and then the people begin to call me and say well brother branham you're advertising the paper he said oh that hurts me oh that hurts me he tells a story about a lady in pennsylvania that went off and she decided that she was going to hold a meeting and so what she did she advertised brother branham would be there the first night the people showed up and he wasn't there and she preached and the second night and uh he he said she called everybody the second day said well i know whether brandon wasn't here last night but he's on his way and the people all got there and she preached and brother branham you imagine how that would hurt him and he hears about it he never agreed to go but she was just using his name but today we do that with quotes taken out of context to associate ourselves with a prophet and that's the only semblance of what what he was saying when he said it that even exists anymore it's just that it got brother branham's name attached to it because we've used it completely opposite any way brother branham would have ever used it yeah right that's right are you with me i know it's a little bit different but the lord's been moving but i believe these things we grounded and settled you know and then the lord that's when the lord moves you put things in order and things are right and and i just sunday just thrilled my heart and the last sunday as well god's moving let's let's make sure that that we're right where we need to be at the time that god moves now now people use quotes and then disfellowship people who disagree with their version of what the prophet said me and samuel yeah personal vendettas against them call them balaam motivating the people to a spiritual battle by fear and the people many times and i i i don't know whether to be amused or to be saddened and mostly saddened but i see young preachers especially under these systems that and they'll come out and say well uh well you know uh they'll preach this about bel pior about going up and fellowship with other message churches yeah and i just this is just an example of what's done but it's done in many places and in many ways but well if you're if you fellowship with insert name of the person you hate you're going to the feast of bel pior i can't stand that because i've been told that so many times as i said i've been around right well if you fellowship with this this certain group whatever it is you're going to the feast of bell people or you're like balaam brother branham said we used quotes to say i'm with brother branham but i challenge you because i looked at almost every one of them this week every time brother brandon i believe he talks about bail 306 times if i'm not mistaken and i looked at every one of them this week to look and see i can't find a place where brother branham says used that in relation to fellowship with local churches or between pastors who believe in the opening of the word you remember and again it's just an example but we don't we don't need to follow this we don't need to follow it and you say well brother ben what should we do should we separate no he said somebody's calling me a balaam because i got preachers that do that with me and he called me a balaam because i fellowship with different people you know what you can call me that i'll go fellowship with you amen am i balaam for coming to your meeting and i actually would encourage that because the people don't understand they sit there and think well it's the first time i've ever heard it i've heard every preacher every backslidden preacher that lost confidence in the word to hold the people uses the same argument everybody else is wrong that's right i don't know there's a lot of wrong out there i know what's right and whether you get it from me or from somebody else this is right yes sir that's right that's right and there are people who literally are afraid to come to meetings at our church because the pastor somewhere and i don't say it's a local pastor but there's pastors out there who will say that it's the feast of el pio you're going up to fellowship with balaam and his bunch and brother branham never uses it in that context go look it up now moab didn't have a brass serpent they had no atonement we believe the message we're preaching from the same scripture believing the message now if you go up and fellowship with someone who has no atonement and brother branham said the foolish virgin you remember had rejected the atonement of the hour the fullness of the atonement and that's why they had to go through the tribulation period now you can go be a light i'll go sometimes these southern gospel concerts and baptist people and you feel the spirit of the lord sometimes in those places you raise your hand and worship with them and and all be there together but you don't have much in common that's right right there's just not much there but but with message people and i'm not talking about about strange ideas and nonsense i've separated from things like that before and i'm not afraid to do it again but i'm talking about people who believe the opening of the word people who believe like we do but they're a little bit different in the manner of worship or different but random had i think four churches in his own hometown who disagreed with him on church order and brother branham put it this way he said if every one of the people in this church went to those churches he said we'd just fill it up again praise god sure i don't have i honestly i don't have an itch to preach a huge crowd and we may we might have a huge condo i'm nothing against it either it is easier to preach to a bunch of people i know these people were hoping i'd get well these preachers on a wednesday night but didn't brother stewart do a good job last wednesday night preaching to us amen brother joel on sunday night as well i feel like i could go take a month's vacation i'd be all right but uh but what what is it what did moah have or what did they not have that israel had here's what brother branham said was the difference he said what was the difference fundamentally both right he said but moab did not have the vindication of god with them they were only a nation a group of celebrities but israel had a prophet with them i would put it this way they had the prophet right which is the messenger of the age balaam was a prophet israel had a prophet listen they had a smitten rock they had a pillar of fire they had a brass serpent for healing they had the blessings of god moving right along with them and they was the called out children of god now just imagine with me for a moment because brother branham never identifies going to the feast of bel pior as being uh the difference between moab and and israel as being totally moral morality they were the same yes they both had a mixed multitude some that lived in some didn't right right and you got to be careful about separating from people because we said well they've had things happen and and there's been there's been problems in their church and and so we're holy you know nothing ever happens to us well nothing that you hear about right and if you can imagine a moabite going down into the camp of israel and being there on the day that aaron builds a golden calf they happen to go to church on the day that aaron decides to build a golden calf because because moses is gone half the people end up getting swallowed up that day the music was terrible playing a bunch of rock and roll music around a golden calf you would you could be excused if you were a moabite going out there and looking at all that and saying these people aren't god's people but the random said they saw men that married other men's wives they saw all the immorality of israel because they looked at the hundred parts of israel and balaam said surely god will curse them and god wouldn't even let him yeah so he invited him up to a feast and said we're all the same and we're not all the same because we have a prophet we have a smitten rock we have a brass serpent he said they had a brass serpent for healing they had the blessings of god moving right along with them they were the called out children of god but remember it was not moses that wasn't brotherly to moab it was moab who said don't you can't pass all right moab is denomination every time brother branham types it to that yeah and the feast of belle fiore he said it's the ecumenical move and they called him up and he said you pentecostals are going right along with it the people that used to laugh at you and make fun of you right like balaam did but they but now they become the economical move and brother brandon standing there preaching right to the group we explained it a few weeks ago a few months ago that become that ecumenical move that become the charismatic movement ended up wedded with the catholics today where there's no difference right that was the balaam move that's what he called it i don't say there couldn't be some people anointed with the same spirit today even around the message but the call to not fellowship was to call to come out of denominationalism come out of her my people be not partaker of her plagues not because somebody uses different music than you do yeah somebody has drums and you don't or somebody preaches a little bit longer than you like that's called sovereignty local church sovereignty yeah that's right we used to laugh at people who wouldn't come to our churches because we had a fellowship hall or christmas trees but now i see people doing the same thing about music or about how many emotions are in the service or some minor doctrine yeah amen but you say it's a good cause the people did you see the people they were dancing in front of a golden camp but they were god's people some of them were anyway be careful talking about god's people it's a good cause so assaults but a prophet said he was deceitful and it showed he never broke that denominational curse yes because his methods were still denominational i've been told that if we fellowship with others other churches locally that we're as guilty as they are whatever they do we're guilty of it well i know guilt by association but i think you carried it a little bit too far that was balaam's argument by the way again did you hear the music down at the golden calf their high priest made a golden calf what if a moabite saw that surely god will curse them i tell you what people need to repent of the critical spirit if guilt by association was the rule brother randall was as guilty as the modern charismatic movement because of the full gospel businessmen who were funding him and also funding the modern charismatic movement at the same time you could point out i won't name names tonight but you can point out people around brother branham's inner circle that we would look at today and say you need to disassociate yourself with them and brother branham let them be used by god to get the message out that's right guilt by association that's nonsense preach the word i'm not going to tell you where you can can't go to church i'll encourage you to go to meetings there's some meetings i may not encourage you to go to but you know what you're you're the bride of christ you can't be deceived you can't fall i hate to believe that or i don't god told moses you got angry you didn't believe me when i said speak to the rock you you hollered at the people yeah you didn't believe me oh god help us to believe that we believe him today see we'll never get this thing done by human effort that's right we're never by the efforts of a pastor guarding the people telling them where they can and can't go to a meeting where they can and can't go to church what car to buy that human effort is never going to get people in a rapture it's never going to get people where they need to be with god i've watched it over the years and the more human effort the pastor puts into it it seems like the farther the people get away from god because they learn to hide things and keep it away but if the preacher will just preach the word and let it fall where it may if the preacher will preach the gospel what happens is the people that are gods begin to live by and the mixed multitude goes on and does their thing but there's got to be somebody that's going to live it somebody that's going to go in the rapture might as well be us tonight there's got to be somebody that'll worship god there may be many who do it wrong there may be many to get the music wrong and and the dancing wrong and the and the shouting wrong and everything else but it don't stop me from shouting when it's time to shout when it's appropriate it don't stop me from worshiping god when it's appropriate it don't stop me from fellowshipping with my brothers i believe i'm supposed to believe in an open book the opening of the word and i can't even fellowship with people who believe literally the same thing god doesn't put his his church in the hands of men who manhandle it the virgin bride oh i wish you could hear my heart tonight the word have such a respect for the word i hope you see that the word is so great i wish i could preach it like i want to but the benefit nikkei nikkeil means to conquer leo means the laity nicolette means to conquer the laity he said now why is this such a terrible thing it's terrible because god has never someone say never he has never placed his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mindedness we're going to schedule something on the same day so the people can't go yeah sure he's placed his church in the care of god ordained spirit-filled god help me today word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word that's right saul drove cattle but david fed sheep yes you know why she follow the shepherd brother joe it's because he leads him to green pastures right he leads him beside the still waters so they learn to trust him yeah and yes sometimes he's got to go after one sometimes he's got to break a leg but it's his love for them he's not behind them driving them he's in front of them oh that the ministers of the message of the hour could be in front of the people not behind them but doing it first yes let us be the ones who do it if somebody's going to live it let me live it if somebody's going to go to portray the love and joy and peace let me not just preach about it but let me do it lord let me manifest it
