[49:55] that actually is true in our lives and
[49:58] we can say yea and amen to the word of
[50:00] God amen amen Genesis chapter 15 and
[50:03] verse 18.
[50:06] Genesis 15 and 18 and then we'll read
[50:09] Joshua 21 43 and 44.
[50:14] you could have each and every one of you
[50:15] with us this morning it's always a
[50:18] blessing and uh to have all of you our
[50:21] visitors this morning and each one and I
[50:23] know there's many many that are out this
[50:25] morning traveling or uh or sick and be
[50:29] praying for them this morning and those
[50:31] that are watching or praying for you as
[50:33] well
[50:34] Genesis 15 18 in the same day the Lord
[50:36] made a covenant with Abram saying unto
[50:39] thy seed have I given this land from the
[50:41] river of Egypt to the Great River the
[50:44] river Euphrates and then Joshua 21 43
[50:50] and the lord gave unto Israel all the
[50:53] land someone say all the land
[50:56] the lord gave unto Israel all the land
[50:59] which he swear to give unto their
[51:00] fathers and they possessed it and dwelt
[51:03] therein and the lord gave them rest
[51:05] round about according to all that he
[51:08] swear unto their fathers and there stood
[51:11] not a man of all their enemies before
[51:13] them the Lord delivered all their
[51:16] enemies into their hand I pray the Lord
[51:19] without his Blessing to the word you may
[51:22] be seated this morning
[51:26] we don't often take time to reflect on
[51:29] what God has done in fact I think many
[51:32] times we tend to dwell on what Satan has
[51:34] done and what he can do and the power
[51:37] that he has and and he does have power
[51:39] but it's only power delegated to him by
[51:43] An Almighty all-sufficient Sovereign God
[51:45] and I think we need to recognize that
[51:48] more we don't need to be like the
[51:50] proverbial pig that was under the tree
[51:52] and and he was eating apples off the
[51:55] ground but he never did look up to see
[51:57] where the apples come from but I mean
[52:00] apples come from somewhere we need to
[52:02] look up and see that God is with us and
[52:05] and that he deserves the praise and the
[52:07] glory because he kept his word and I
[52:10] believe we can say that in the past
[52:12] tense this morning whatever you're going
[52:14] through whatever situation of life you
[52:17] find yourself in whether you're a young
[52:19] person whether you're an elder whether
[52:21] you're sick whether you're well but
[52:23] whatever situation of life that you find
[52:26] yourself in this morning I believe you
[52:28] can look back at your life and say he
[52:30] kept his word I wasn't always faithful
[52:33] but he was always faithful I wasn't
[52:36] always what I should be but he was
[52:38] always what he should be to me he was
[52:40] always my protector he was always my
[52:43] guide he was always my my the one who
[52:46] held me amen when I couldn't hold myself
[52:49] he held me aren't you glad for that
[52:51] today amen he was always there at every
[52:54] moment of my life in the down times in
[52:57] the up times David said wither shall I
[52:59] flee from thy presence where am I going
[53:01] to go to get away from him he said if I
[53:03] flee with the wings of the morning
[53:04] behold you're there if I make my bed in
[53:07] hell behold you're there you're always
[53:09] with me here you're omnipresent
[53:11] everywhere that I go you're there and
[53:13] your goodness follows after me aren't
[53:16] you glad for that today
[53:18] amen so God is all together positive yes
[53:23] yes you ever think about that and I read
[53:25] a a quote last week or the week before
[53:27] about that and it got me thinking on
[53:29] these lines we Trend toward the negative
[53:32] we're geared that way because in our
[53:34] minds we want to protect ourselves and
[53:37] so we're geared even as children too uh
[53:39] not touch the stove because it's hot we
[53:41] learn to be afraid of things but God
[53:45] isn't afraid of anything right
[53:47] you realize that he's not afraid of
[53:49] anything there's nothing he can't
[53:52] overcome nothing's going to take him out
[53:54] there's nothing he only allows the devil
[53:57] to do what he does for the purpose of
[54:00] redemption but he only allows things
[54:02] that make things better and that's hard
[54:04] for us to see looking at it from our
[54:06] level but he said my thoughts are not
[54:08] your thoughts and my waves are not your
[54:11] ways so God is always positive there is
[54:14] no negativity in God
[54:17] right now you know God keeps his word
[54:20] and and when uh Paul in the Corinthians
[54:23] when he was talking to the Corinthian
[54:25] Church about how that they uh he was
[54:28] going to come to them and you find in
[54:30] First Corinthians he's already been
[54:31] there once and then he writes him a
[54:33] letter and he writes a pretty sternly
[54:36] worded letter and then he says he's
[54:38] going to come back but before he comes
[54:40] back a second time he actually begins to
[54:44] talk to the people there in Corinth and
[54:46] and he begins to explain to them that uh
[54:50] he thought it would be better to write a
[54:51] letter and some of them interpreted that
[54:53] as Paul doesn't want to see us Paul
[54:56] doesn't care about us and also Paul
[54:58] doesn't keep his word and so Paul takes
[55:01] that and he turns it around and he says
[55:03] there he says in second Corinthians 1 17
[55:06] he said when I therefore was thus minded
[55:09] in other words I was intending to come
[55:11] to you he said did I use lightness or
[55:14] the things that I purpose do I purpose
[55:16] according to the flesh that with me
[55:18] there should be yay yay and Nae Nae in
[55:20] other words was it did I just say it to
[55:22] say it to make you feel better he said I
[55:24] really intend to come yes I really
[55:26] intend to come and and so they they say
[55:29] well Paul don't keep this word he said I
[55:31] do keep my word he said because I'm a
[55:33] servant of God
[55:35] right and as God is true our word toward
[55:38] you was not yay and nay it was not
[55:40] negative and positive positive and
[55:42] negative it was all yay in other words
[55:44] it was yes
[55:46] this is what we're going to do this was
[55:48] our intention he said for the Son of God
[55:50] Jesus Christ who was preached among you
[55:53] by us even by me and sylvanus and
[55:56] timotheus was not yay and name but in
[55:59] him was yay so in other words everything
[56:01] about Jesus was a promise was the
[56:04] Fulfillment of a promise there was no
[56:06] negativity he was going to a cross to be
[56:10] crucified he was going to be beaten and
[56:12] to be and to be spit on but there was no
[56:15] negativity in that yeah I hope you can
[56:18] hear me today there was no negativity in
[56:21] Gethsemane there was no negativity yes
[56:24] there was there was hardship yes there
[56:26] was trouble yes there was a struggle but
[56:28] no negativity and if we could just
[56:30] understand that in our life we may be
[56:32] going through some things but it's all
[56:34] yea in God there's no yay and nay but
[56:37] it's all amen it's all yes God intends
[56:40] for it to happen it may be hard right
[56:42] now but God allowed it to happen for my
[56:44] good because the Bible says all things
[56:47] yes all things someone say that this
[56:49] morning all things work together for the
[56:52] good to them that love God who are the
[56:54] called according to his purpose
[56:56] amen so he said our word was not yay and
[57:00] nay and in him was yay he said for all
[57:04] someone say all
[57:05] all the promises of God in him are yet
[57:10] and in him a man or so be it unto the
[57:14] glory of God
[57:16] by us yes yes all are yea
[57:20] everything about him
[57:22] was positive
[57:24] and so we look begin to look at that and
[57:26] I saw some things that brother Brandon
[57:27] said about that he said so what are we
[57:29] worried about
[57:30] what are we stewing about why do we go
[57:32] along with a great big long face
[57:35] said let's look up in grin look up not
[57:38] only grin but laugh
[57:40] not only laugh but raise up holy hands
[57:42] everywhere giving praise and glory to
[57:45] God for his promises is yea and amen not
[57:48] yes and no not yes and no but yes
[57:50] there's no no in it
[57:52] there is no negativity in election
[57:57] you think about that for just a moment
[57:59] God called you and elected you and chose
[58:02] you to be a child of God we know the
[58:05] scriptures bear that out Ephesians
[58:07] chapter 1 in Romans chapter 8 and many
[58:09] other scriptures bear that out John
[58:11] chapter 17. many scriptures bear out the
[58:14] election of the individual when it comes
[58:16] to the things of God and we know in the
[58:18] Old Testament that that was shown in
[58:20] Abraham Abraham was typed election it
[58:23] shows us God called him he wasn't
[58:25] looking for God he wasn't out there oh
[58:28] searching all the different
[58:29] denominations he was happy doing what he
[58:31] did being a pagan but God spoke to
[58:34] Abraham picked him out of all the people
[58:36] on the Earth at that time and said
[58:38] Abraham you're going to be my servant
[58:39] I'm going to bless you I'm going to make
[58:41] you in your name a blessing I'm gonna
[58:43] I'm gonna call through you make the
[58:45] Earth the families of the earth be
[58:46] blessed
[58:47] so and and that was positivity there's
[58:50] no negativity in that
[58:52] amen there's no negativity in election
[58:54] God calls Man by election for knowledge
[58:58] no man can come to me except my father
[59:00] draws him first and all that comes I'll
[59:03] give them eternal life and raise them up
[59:04] at the last day that settles it so I'm
[59:07] so happy this morning to know one thing
[59:09] that Christianity has no negative
[59:12] nothing to it it's everything absolutely
[59:15] positive yes
[59:17] again I know that's hard for some of us
[59:19] to hear because just by Nature we we
[59:22] tend to want to settle in and our woes
[59:25] and and our blues and and think about
[59:27] all the bad things that have happened
[59:29] but even the worst thing that ever
[59:31] happened in your life
[59:33] God allowed it to happen yes
[59:36] for your good
[59:39] right and that's difficult when you face
[59:41] big questions existential questions
[59:44] about life and think about things like
[59:47] the Holocaust how could that be the
[59:48] tender hand of Jehovah
[59:51] how could that be god let's ask a
[59:53] question when I was in the Philippines
[59:54] young people asked me a question said
[59:56] how could a loving God
[59:58] take the children of Jericho and put
[1:00:01] them to the sword
[1:00:02] how could that how could you get
[1:00:04] anything positive out of that
[1:00:06] but we go back to the nature of God and
[1:00:08] all the promises of God are yea
[1:00:11] right they're all amen and you look at
[1:00:13] those things you begin to wonder how
[1:00:15] could it possibly be but that's where
[1:00:16] you got to trust the mind of God
[1:00:19] and the intent of God in your life
[1:00:21] you've got to move past a common
[1:00:23] understanding of life's troubles and say
[1:00:26] well I must have not done something
[1:00:28] right or I must have must have been
[1:00:29] something that happened that may not be
[1:00:31] it at all Jesus told his disciples they
[1:00:33] said they said this man was born blind
[1:00:35] and they said was it his fault or his
[1:00:37] parents and Jesus said neither he said
[1:00:39] it was for the glory of God God allowed
[1:00:42] him to be blind from his birth so that
[1:00:44] he could show his glory in him so
[1:00:46] there's not yes and no not yes and no
[1:00:49] there's no no in it I know that's bad
[1:00:51] English but there's no no in it
[1:00:54] are you with me this morning
[1:00:56] now so
[1:00:59] now everything is absolutely positive if
[1:01:02] a man that becomes a child of God has a
[1:01:05] positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has
[1:01:08] a positive hold on him with the
[1:01:10] Assurance brother Peter if you can catch
[1:01:12] up with me there and I'm moving a little
[1:01:14] bit fast for him he's a positive hold on
[1:01:16] him with the Assurance by almighty God
[1:01:18] by an oath to himself
[1:01:20] that he will raise him up in the last
[1:01:22] day and take him to Glory there's not no
[1:01:25] if or or or and there's not no if or and
[1:01:29] or nothing it's something that's
[1:01:31] positive yes
[1:01:32] now there's a caveat to that in the
[1:01:35] sense that you have to be born again you
[1:01:38] have to become a you have to be a child
[1:01:39] of God so election by itself is not what
[1:01:44] uh what is not the new birth but it
[1:01:45] causes you to have the new birth does
[1:01:49] that make sense it it puts you in a
[1:01:51] place to be born again and if you are
[1:01:53] the elected of God you'll be born again
[1:01:55] but when the word comes across your path
[1:01:57] but you still have to be born again you
[1:01:59] have to accept Christ you have to
[1:02:01] believe you have to come to God you have
[1:02:03] to give up the world and the things of
[1:02:04] the world so that's when it becomes all
[1:02:07] when it's all positive is on his side on
[1:02:10] our side we've got to get some things up
[1:02:12] so your life has to compare with the
[1:02:14] Bible said now you can be mentally
[1:02:16] worked up or emotionally worked up and
[1:02:19] just imagine your faith but when your
[1:02:20] spirit Bears record with his spirit and
[1:02:22] your life Compares with God's Bible
[1:02:24] you've got a pretty good conception it's
[1:02:27] all at peace that's right but if it
[1:02:29] don't compare with that you better come
[1:02:31] back again
[1:02:32] listen if you don't love him with all
[1:02:34] your heart how many loves him this
[1:02:36] morning
[1:02:36] this is how we ought to love God we
[1:02:38] ought to love him with all our hearts
[1:02:40] with all our might with all our soul
[1:02:42] with all our minds that that's the
[1:02:44] Commandment of God if sin if sin doesn't
[1:02:47] make you tremble at the thoughts of it
[1:02:49] you better come back and be sure you
[1:02:52] need to be born again you might have
[1:02:53] danced in the spirits you might have
[1:02:54] spoke with tongues you might have put
[1:02:56] your name on every Church book in the
[1:02:57] city you might have been baptized three
[1:02:59] times forward backward sprinkled I won't
[1:03:01] have nothing to do with it not one thing
[1:03:03] you've got to be born again something
[1:03:05] that takes place a regeneration you
[1:03:07] become a new creation we still believe
[1:03:09] in the New Birth around here we still
[1:03:11] believe in an old-time religion we're a
[1:03:13] man or a woman or a boy or girl becomes
[1:03:15] saved by the power of God
[1:03:18] and becomes different aren't you glad he
[1:03:21] found you one day you weren't looking
[1:03:23] for him but he came looking for you and
[1:03:25] he found you and he changed you that's
[1:03:27] positive
[1:03:29] are you with me now yes
[1:03:31] all things just passed away All Things
[1:03:34] become new you're you got a new look on
[1:03:36] everything the birds sing different
[1:03:39] your enemies that you could once not
[1:03:41] stand you love them
[1:03:44] you really love them and Everything's
[1:03:46] changed then you know you've passed from
[1:03:48] death
[1:03:50] to life
[1:03:51] he said by this show you know all men
[1:03:53] know that you're my disciples that you
[1:03:55] love one another
[1:03:56] yeah that's right he didn't say how much
[1:03:58] word how much knowledge how much
[1:03:59] understanding but that you love one
[1:04:00] another
[1:04:01] notice Abraham was given the promise
[1:04:04] that's the first scripture that we read
[1:04:05] was the promise
[1:04:07] Joshua saw the Fulfillment of it
[1:04:10] now we know that everything wasn't
[1:04:12] perfect
[1:04:14] and sometimes this morning in the season
[1:04:16] of Thanksgiving we need to look Beyond
[1:04:19] uh the uh the little things and and the
[1:04:22] little problems and the minor issues
[1:04:24] that we see and look to the Unseen and
[1:04:28] be able to see a promise fulfilled in
[1:04:30] spite of the difficulty so here was a
[1:04:33] promise that was given to Joshua and yet
[1:04:35] they had not all taken every piece of
[1:04:37] the land fact Jerusalem wouldn't be
[1:04:39] taken for many many more years during
[1:04:41] the time of David so there was land yet
[1:04:43] to be taken brother Danny but yet he
[1:04:45] looked at it and said it's all done
[1:04:48] right it's all taken care of what was he
[1:04:51] doing he was saying God kept his word
[1:04:53] and if he kept his word to save me he'll
[1:04:55] keep his word to heal me if he keeps his
[1:04:58] word to heal me he'll keep his word to
[1:04:59] help my children if he keeps his word
[1:05:01] with that he'll keep his word in the
[1:05:03] church wherever he kept his word before
[1:05:05] I can look back and say he kept his work
[1:05:07] and because he kept his word I can
[1:05:09] rejoice in that and believe that we'll
[1:05:12] continue to possess the land we'll
[1:05:13] continue to make it ours we'll continue
[1:05:15] to take the promises of the Bible and
[1:05:18] make those our own or aren't you glad
[1:05:20] that you can do that this morning
[1:05:22] so now he kept his word in spite of all
[1:05:26] the difficulties he did what he promised
[1:05:28] he would do
[1:05:30] and this is what I want to say to you
[1:05:31] this morning as a church
[1:05:33] can we stand here it's Word of Life
[1:05:35] Tabernacle in 2022 and say the same
[1:05:39] thing
[1:05:41] can we not just say he will keep his
[1:05:43] word but he kept his word
[1:05:46] I believe we can yes
[1:05:48] if you're a Christian today I believe
[1:05:50] you can say that but we can also as a
[1:05:52] church I believe we can look back and
[1:05:54] say he kept his word we didn't always do
[1:05:57] what was right we didn't always make the
[1:05:59] right decisions we're human beings we're
[1:06:01] fallible but he kept his word he did
[1:06:05] what he promised he would do and that's
[1:06:07] why we have life this morning that's why
[1:06:09] we're here that's why we can come
[1:06:11] together he kept his word
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:16] now let's look at some specifics of how
[1:06:18] he kept his word to give them the land
[1:06:21] and kind of bring that to today
[1:06:25] I imagine when amram and and djokabed
[1:06:28] had a little baby boy
[1:06:31] that the promise never looked farther
[1:06:34] away
[1:06:35] than it did at that moment
[1:06:38] because things had gotten worse
[1:06:43] they had put not only the men but the
[1:06:45] women to work
[1:06:47] they had they had made them make bricks
[1:06:49] without straw
[1:06:51] they'd caused many difficulties to come
[1:06:53] into their life they were slaves in a
[1:06:55] Strange Land
[1:06:57] and so they were sitting there and the
[1:06:59] economy was so difficult and life was so
[1:07:01] difficult everything about what they
[1:07:03] were doing was so difficult
[1:07:05] and and yet they had this baby boy now
[1:07:08] what are we going to do with a baby boy
[1:07:10] in the midst of all this difficulty
[1:07:12] what are we going to do with a child
[1:07:15] even though they believed he was a
[1:07:17] goodly child they believed he was the
[1:07:18] promised son that was to come the one to
[1:07:21] deliver
[1:07:22] but yet they they couldn't understand
[1:07:24] how is God going to keep him safe
[1:07:27] and one of the ways that God kept his
[1:07:29] word is by protecting Moses
[1:07:32] during that time
[1:07:35] now watch here Moses is is going into a
[1:07:41] great situation that he should have died
[1:07:43] during that time you remember the Bible
[1:07:46] says that Moses was born into the lamb
[1:07:49] and when Pharaoh knew that the promise
[1:07:52] of the deliverer was coming what did he
[1:07:53] do he caused the the wicked old witches
[1:07:56] of that day the the women that have
[1:07:59] never had any children he made them come
[1:08:00] down there and and uh and it wasn't it
[1:08:02] was just women that were just awful and
[1:08:04] they didn't have any love for children
[1:08:05] and they come down there and and they uh
[1:08:08] they they killed the babies they threw
[1:08:10] them to the crocodiles
[1:08:12] you know the story the crocodiles got
[1:08:13] fat off of children developed a taste
[1:08:16] for them
[1:08:17] and so they walked down through that
[1:08:20] time and and hear that the firstborn
[1:08:22] baby was to be killed so the soldiers
[1:08:24] were going house to house knocking on
[1:08:26] the door listening for crying babies
[1:08:29] it was a despotic situation and we think
[1:08:32] about how awful it is today when we send
[1:08:34] our kids to school and we have to when
[1:08:36] we had we don't know whether to
[1:08:38] homeschool them or send them to public
[1:08:40] school if you send them there's all
[1:08:42] kinds of sharks in the water all kinds
[1:08:43] of alligators waiting on them but if you
[1:08:45] keep them at home they've got other
[1:08:46] issues that you have to deal with at
[1:08:48] home and really no place is safe because
[1:08:50] of the internet because of all these
[1:08:52] things that are around us it seems like
[1:08:53] every place is just full of crocodiles
[1:08:56] that are out there to eat them but you
[1:08:58] realize if God intended your children to
[1:09:00] be here and to overcome and label to see
[1:09:02] us that he will keep them safe even
[1:09:04] though the crocodiles are in the water
[1:09:06] even though everything looks like it's
[1:09:08] going against them
[1:09:10] and so what did they do during a time
[1:09:12] like that you've got to commit that baby
[1:09:14] to the water
[1:09:16] that's what they did to Moses that's
[1:09:18] what we've got to do to our children
[1:09:20] commit them to the water so they
[1:09:23] committed him to the water and they
[1:09:24] built a a a little Arc out of with tar
[1:09:28] and pitched it and and they put it in
[1:09:30] the water
[1:09:31] in the most dangerous place that there
[1:09:34] was
[1:09:35] and it was carried from them them not
[1:09:37] knowing where it would end up
[1:09:39] but by the Providence of God there were
[1:09:42] angels watching over that little baby
[1:09:45] and the angels held back the alligators
[1:09:48] and the crocodiles all along the Nile
[1:09:50] River where I've been there to that
[1:09:51] River and I've looked and I've seen that
[1:09:53] and I imagine what it must have been
[1:09:54] like at that time because now the the
[1:09:56] pollution has killed off all the
[1:09:57] crocodiles but back then the crocodiles
[1:10:00] were there and and they were in the
[1:10:02] river and they began to I can imagine
[1:10:03] what that River's not a small stream
[1:10:06] it's not like the Spring River even it's
[1:10:08] a great big wide long river they didn't
[1:10:11] know that he wouldn't have ended up out
[1:10:12] in the ocean somewhere
[1:10:14] but they put him in the water anyway
[1:10:16] because they trusted God if this is the
[1:10:20] one he's going to make it
[1:10:22] and we commit our children to the water
[1:10:24] and so here they come here he comes he's
[1:10:27] guarded by angels and he actually comes
[1:10:30] into the home of pharaoh which should
[1:10:31] have been a death sentence
[1:10:33] but God gave him favor favor with
[1:10:35] Pharaoh's daughter
[1:10:37] so that he could be he could be alive
[1:10:41] oh my God's able to do that for us do
[1:10:43] you believe that not only that I've seen
[1:10:45] him do it
[1:10:47] huh
[1:10:48] we see how good God's been to us
[1:10:51] I think of a story
[1:10:54] of that was told of an old man back in
[1:10:58] the South his name was Gabe
[1:11:00] and he never would go to church hardly
[1:11:02] go once in a while with his wife but
[1:11:05] he just he wasn't a Believer he'd never
[1:11:07] been baptized
[1:11:10] and he never given his heart to the Lord
[1:11:12] and he got to be an old man and one day
[1:11:15] but he was friends with the preacher one
[1:11:16] day he went hunting with him
[1:11:18] and they went hunting back then for for
[1:11:20] game actually to get something to eat
[1:11:21] unlike us most of us go hunting to spend
[1:11:24] money
[1:11:26] now some of y'all get something actually
[1:11:28] some deer I saw that deer by the chip I
[1:11:30] my goodness you need to talk to brother
[1:11:32] Stewart and see tell him how you did it
[1:11:37] y'all need to get together today
[1:11:41] but
[1:11:43] but in that day they would they would
[1:11:44] get game for actual food they needed it
[1:11:47] and so they went out and they began to
[1:11:49] shoot some squirrels and rabbits to some
[1:11:51] different game that was out there and
[1:11:52] they'd come back in the evening the
[1:11:54] sun's setting
[1:11:55] and old gabies he's walking along there
[1:11:57] and just loaded down and Gabe was a poor
[1:11:59] shot
[1:12:00] he just couldn't hit the broad side of a
[1:12:02] barn
[1:12:02] but that day the God had given him he
[1:12:05] blessed him with food and so he's
[1:12:07] walking along there and he realizes I've
[1:12:09] got enough for my family for quite a
[1:12:10] while some time and as he's walking
[1:12:12] along he begins to think here I don't
[1:12:14] attend church regularly I don't do like
[1:12:17] I should I don't I don't do the things
[1:12:20] that I should do that I know I should do
[1:12:22] I've never been baptized and yet God
[1:12:25] loves me so much that he put these
[1:12:27] squirrels in the trees and and these
[1:12:29] rabbits on the ground so that I could
[1:12:31] kill some
[1:12:32] are you with me this morning he loved me
[1:12:34] so much that he took care of me and he
[1:12:37] and and he told the pastor he said
[1:12:39] pastor he said tomorrow I want to be a
[1:12:40] baptized I'm going to give my heart to
[1:12:42] the Lord he said I want to be baptized
[1:12:44] in the church he said he said well Gabe
[1:12:46] he said what sermon was it that I
[1:12:48] preached that caused you to give your
[1:12:49] heart to the Lord he said it wasn't that
[1:12:51] he said I just began to think about the
[1:12:53] goodness of God to an old sinner like
[1:12:55] Gabe well I wonder if we could just look
[1:12:57] at that that ought to be enough for us
[1:12:59] to turn our attention towards God and
[1:13:01] just to give our heart to him today
[1:13:03] just the fact that he's done so so many
[1:13:06] good things for us even in the natural
[1:13:08] if we could just look behind our
[1:13:10] shoulder and see how good God's been to
[1:13:12] us just see his goodness to the center
[1:13:15] to see that he's brought you safe thus
[1:13:17] far
[1:13:19] he's sitting in your right mind at least
[1:13:21] some of us look back who's fed you who's
[1:13:24] clothed you when those breaks were
[1:13:25] streaking and the car almost rammed you
[1:13:27] who protected you then every one of you
[1:13:29] has a story like that when you've been
[1:13:31] almost at the point of an accident
[1:13:33] almost at the point of death and God
[1:13:35] brought you back who did that for you
[1:13:38] God did that
[1:13:41] who protected you then who was that hour
[1:13:43] of sickness when the doctor shook his
[1:13:45] head and said I don't know no more to do
[1:13:47] but you're here tonight
[1:13:49] look back a little piece and see what
[1:13:51] happened
[1:13:52] and to you Christian take a look around
[1:13:54] and see the sinful world
[1:13:58] look on the internet look in the papers
[1:14:00] look at the sinful world how it is and
[1:14:03] to know that God before the foundation
[1:14:05] of the world chose you by election
[1:14:09] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:14:11] knocked at your heart and you opened up
[1:14:13] and let him come in how good he is can
[1:14:16] you say Amen to that this morning how
[1:14:18] good he is he knocked on the door of my
[1:14:21] heart in that moment when I needed him
[1:14:23] the most
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:26] hey man we are kept by the power of God
[1:14:28] the Bible tells us that in First Peter
[1:14:30] chapter 1 and verse 3. he said blessed
[1:14:32] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:14:34] Christ which according to His abundant
[1:14:37] Mercy has begotten us again unto a
[1:14:39] lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:14:42] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[1:14:44] Incorruptible and undefiled that faith
[1:14:48] not away and served in heaven for you
[1:14:53] that ought to tell you he chose you
[1:14:55] because it was reserved in heaven for
[1:14:57] you
[1:14:59] that's what the Bible says who are kept
[1:15:01] by the power of God
[1:15:04] kept by the power of God through faith
[1:15:07] unto salvation ready to be revealed in
[1:15:09] the last time
[1:15:11] brother Branham went through a great
[1:15:12] time of trouble in his life loosen his
[1:15:14] baby and his wife and children and
[1:15:16] everything and somebody said to me he
[1:15:18] said did you keep your religion I said
[1:15:20] no it kept me
[1:15:21] see I had an absolute to know that
[1:15:23] someday I'll see them again I couldn't
[1:15:26] have made it if I hadn't had an absolute
[1:15:27] something to grab a hold of it means the
[1:15:30] difference it made the difference in me
[1:15:31] when I was tired where I was tied
[1:15:33] because I knew that I'd see them again
[1:15:35] oh that ought to be our absolute today I
[1:15:37] know I'll see them again even death
[1:15:39] itself can't separate me from the love
[1:15:42] of God
[1:15:43] Hallelujah
[1:15:45] how else did God
[1:15:47] lead his children how did he bring about
[1:15:51] the promise how did he keep his word
[1:15:53] he did it by protecting Moses he did it
[1:15:57] during the Wilderness after their
[1:15:58] Deliverance by providing a brass serpent
[1:16:02] a smitten Rock and the shout of the king
[1:16:06] I think it's really interesting what the
[1:16:08] Bible says about Balaam if you go and
[1:16:10] study Balaam Balaam was a real prophet
[1:16:13] but he was false in the sense that he
[1:16:15] gave away he gave into the pressure of
[1:16:18] influence and money and he gave in to
[1:16:21] the fact that balak and he taught him
[1:16:24] how to make Israel sin so he's false in
[1:16:26] that sense but he had a real prophetic
[1:16:28] gift
[1:16:29] and so balak hires Balaam to curse the
[1:16:32] children of Israel you all know the
[1:16:33] story how Balaam goes down there and the
[1:16:36] donkey talks to him you think God don't
[1:16:38] have a sense of humor
[1:16:40] he can make a donkey talk
[1:16:45] you may be hearing from one this morning
[1:16:48] I'll put it on myself and my brother
[1:16:51] Joel again
[1:16:52] but but he can use a donkey
[1:16:54] and to speak to the prophet
[1:16:57] he was the most hard-headed animal there
[1:16:59] is to speak to the prophet and tell the
[1:17:01] prophet hey you shouldn't be going down
[1:17:04] here
[1:17:04] these are God's people
[1:17:08] that's not mine anointed and so in
[1:17:11] numbers 23 and 18 you know the story you
[1:17:14] know the story how he goes anyway and
[1:17:16] God gives him permission and his
[1:17:17] permissive will allows him to go and so
[1:17:19] in numbers 23 and 18 Balaam being an
[1:17:21] actual prophet he begins to prophesy and
[1:17:25] he took up his Parable and said rise up
[1:17:27] balak and here hearken unto me thou son
[1:17:30] of support God is not a man that he
[1:17:33] should lie
[1:17:35] God kept his word
[1:17:36] neither the son of man that he should
[1:17:39] repent hath he said and shall he not do
[1:17:41] it hath he spoken shall he not make it
[1:17:43] good behold I have received commandment
[1:17:46] to bless and he hath blessed and I
[1:17:50] cannot reverse it
[1:17:53] amen oh my if we could just get a
[1:17:54] revelation of that what God is blessed
[1:17:56] man even a prophet cannot cannot reverse
[1:18:00] it
[1:18:00] and you'd quit caring so much what other
[1:18:03] people said about you if you knew that
[1:18:05] the blessing of God on your life cannot
[1:18:07] be reversed
[1:18:09] yes even by a prophet
[1:18:12] you understand that the South Phoenician
[1:18:14] woman had a revelation that we need
[1:18:16] she's sitting there and and Jesus
[1:18:18] himself spoke to her and said it's not
[1:18:20] meat for me to take the children's bread
[1:18:22] and give it to dogs and that didn't stop
[1:18:24] her she said but it's the dogs the
[1:18:27] little dogs even eat the crumbs that
[1:18:29] fall from the master's table
[1:18:31] oh my I can't reverse what God has
[1:18:33] blessed God intended for her daughter to
[1:18:35] be healed and she wouldn't even let
[1:18:37] Jesus stand in the way of that right
[1:18:39] understand when he said it but he said
[1:18:41] it testing her and he responded and he
[1:18:44] said I've not seen such great faith in
[1:18:46] Israel
[1:18:47] oh my what what kind of an attitude
[1:18:49] ought to we to have to the things of God
[1:18:51] listen he said what he is blessed I
[1:18:53] cannot reverse it he hath not beheld
[1:18:56] iniquity in Jacob
[1:18:59] and what that means is he refuses
[1:19:01] to look at it
[1:19:04] now if you understand imputation in the
[1:19:06] old and the New Testament when God
[1:19:08] chooses a people
[1:19:11] he does not choose them and then just
[1:19:14] allow them to do bad things
[1:19:17] but he imputes righteousness to them
[1:19:20] and Abraham he said his faith was
[1:19:22] counted for righteousness
[1:19:24] and what that means that word imputed it
[1:19:26] literally means not that not that uh
[1:19:30] not that he just covered it over
[1:19:32] or forgot about it but he actually
[1:19:34] filled up the account
[1:19:36] that's what that word means to fill up
[1:19:39] the account of righteousness
[1:19:41] so in Abraham when you go into the New
[1:19:43] Testament it says he staggered not at
[1:19:45] the promise of God
[1:19:46] but if you go in the Old Testament begin
[1:19:48] to look at his life you begin to realize
[1:19:49] it was a couple times he was out of the
[1:19:51] will of God
[1:19:53] but in the New Testament he said he
[1:19:54] staggered not why he hath not beheld
[1:19:57] iniquity in Jacob yes
[1:20:00] yes oh my oh God we ought to have the
[1:20:02] attitude that God has sometimes God has
[1:20:04] not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither
[1:20:07] hath he seen perverseness in Israel
[1:20:09] listen when God Saves you when he give
[1:20:11] you the Holy Ghost he does not go back
[1:20:14] then and make make and punish you for
[1:20:16] the things that have gone on in your
[1:20:18] past he does not look at that and begin
[1:20:19] to think well now he will correct you he
[1:20:22] will you things in life just in the
[1:20:24] natural will bear fruit if you sow bad
[1:20:26] things you'll get bad things but God
[1:20:28] himself doesn't even see yes sir
[1:20:31] right that's what the Bible says he puts
[1:20:33] it in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:20:36] and he put up a sign said no fishing
[1:20:38] yeah
[1:20:39] amen there's nobody that can go who who
[1:20:42] can lay anything that Paul said to the
[1:20:44] charge of God's elect right it's God
[1:20:46] that justifies
[1:20:50] and and we don't condone sin but if you
[1:20:52] really get a revelation of what God's
[1:20:54] done for you you'll quit it
[1:20:56] or you'll love him with all of your
[1:20:58] heart
[1:20:59] he hasn't seen perverseness in Israel
[1:21:02] people do people look at the church and
[1:21:04] say well
[1:21:05] you know
[1:21:07] a bunch of backslid layout of seeing
[1:21:09] people I know we're affected by that
[1:21:11] yeah
[1:21:12] I know we could walk up here I could
[1:21:13] find something to criticize I heard a
[1:21:16] preacher say that he said I want to
[1:21:18] preach good things and the promises of
[1:21:19] God but it just can't because there's
[1:21:21] just so much to criticize were you just
[1:21:22] looking at the wrong thing yeah
[1:21:24] or you're preaching to the wrong people
[1:21:26] yeah
[1:21:28] I'm preaching to the blood Sons and
[1:21:31] Daughters of God
[1:21:32] are you with me now I realize not
[1:21:35] everybody I preached to is going to make
[1:21:36] it but somebody is or God wouldn't have
[1:21:38] called me to preach there's got to be
[1:21:40] somebody out there brother John with
[1:21:42] Allen brother Stewart got to be somebody
[1:21:43] out there for us to reach out to or God
[1:21:45] wouldn't have called us he wouldn't have
[1:21:46] put a gift in our life if there wasn't
[1:21:48] somebody that we can reach out to
[1:21:50] somebody that can hear us so let me
[1:21:52] preach to them
[1:21:54] there's got to be something good to say
[1:21:56] the children of God there's got to be
[1:21:58] something good to say that sons of The
[1:21:59] King and I realize sometimes we need
[1:22:01] correction we need skinned up one side
[1:22:03] and down the other but sometimes we need
[1:22:05] to hear who we are and we need to hear
[1:22:07] the promises of God that the promises
[1:22:09] are true the devil's doing everything he
[1:22:11] can to tell you that the promises are
[1:22:13] not true but the promises of God are all
[1:22:15] true they're yea and amen
[1:22:18] not one of them will fall to the ground
[1:22:22] Hallelujah he's not beheld iniquity in
[1:22:25] Jacob
[1:22:26] the Lord his God is with him and the
[1:22:29] shout of the king is among them
[1:22:31] God brought them out of Egypt you have
[1:22:34] this it were the strength of a unicorn
[1:22:38] surely there is no enchantment against
[1:22:41] Jacob
[1:22:43] neither is there any divination against
[1:22:45] Israel
[1:22:46] according to this time it shall be said
[1:22:49] of Jacob and of Israel what hath God
[1:22:52] wrought
[1:22:53] you see when God gets hold of a man
[1:22:54] he'll make even his enemies testify
[1:22:59] but what was Balaam and balak missing
[1:23:02] now what could they not see in the
[1:23:04] natural when Balaam went up there in the
[1:23:06] first place and when he offered his
[1:23:07] advice to Balaam or to balak the king
[1:23:10] what what did they not see
[1:23:13] they couldn't see the providential
[1:23:15] supply that God had placed in the
[1:23:18] children of Israel and I believe all of
[1:23:20] us could look back at our own lives and
[1:23:22] say God has provided certain things
[1:23:24] atonements in our life he's provided
[1:23:26] food when we needed it he's provided
[1:23:29] pastors when we needed it he's provided
[1:23:30] he's provided deacons and Sunday school
[1:23:32] teachers and elders and people we could
[1:23:34] look up to in the moments when we needed
[1:23:36] it the most he provided it's a church
[1:23:38] family when we needed it what did he do
[1:23:40] he provided those things for us those
[1:23:42] provisions of Grace that were given to
[1:23:44] us
[1:23:45] right right and so Balaam and balak
[1:23:47] didn't understand that now they were
[1:23:49] fundamentally sound they offered the
[1:23:51] same kind of sacrifices that Moses did
[1:23:53] they had celebrity with him he had the
[1:23:55] king he had all the Great Men the
[1:23:56] princes and the eunuch standing with him
[1:23:58] but there was one standing with Moses
[1:24:00] that he didn't see
[1:24:02] that's who stood with Amos speaking of
[1:24:04] the Old Testament Prophet that too will
[1:24:05] stand with every person that's here
[1:24:07] tonight you believe that this morning
[1:24:09] that's who stands with you that same one
[1:24:11] he don't see the one standing with you
[1:24:14] who will stand with every person that's
[1:24:15] here tonight that'll stand for God in
[1:24:17] righteousness no matter how much
[1:24:19] potentates monarchs is there doesn't
[1:24:21] have one thing to do with it they'll
[1:24:23] never be able to curse
[1:24:25] what God is best
[1:24:27] oh I'm so thankful for that today so
[1:24:31] many people have tried to say that's the
[1:24:33] end of that church
[1:24:34] that's the end of that preacher there's
[1:24:37] the end of that person so many people we
[1:24:39] can look back have tried to stand there
[1:24:41] on the hill and say they've done too
[1:24:43] many bad things there's too much in the
[1:24:45] past there's too much that's went on but
[1:24:47] they don't see a smitten Rock they don't
[1:24:49] see a brass surfing they don't see
[1:24:51] healing in the water amen
[1:24:54] see that what God is blessed you cannot
[1:24:56] curse if you can kill it God didn't
[1:24:59] start it right
[1:25:03] are you with me now
[1:25:05] they'll never be able to curse what God
[1:25:07] has blessed why it's a living seed it's
[1:25:10] a word of God it'll grow to its
[1:25:13] perfection
[1:25:14] oh my oh signs of the Living God in the
[1:25:17] camp he said that looked like that
[1:25:19] Israel had done wrong down there but
[1:25:21] they failed to see that smitten Rock and
[1:25:22] that atonement being made for Israel I
[1:25:24] tell you church we got a lot to be
[1:25:26] thankful for yeah and there was a shout
[1:25:28] of the king in the camp God was with
[1:25:30] them why he was Healing The Sick and
[1:25:31] doing great Miracles and signs and
[1:25:33] wonders a pillar of fire hung over them
[1:25:35] Moses was following the pillar of fire
[1:25:38] the children of Israel was following
[1:25:40] Moses and they were on the road to the
[1:25:42] promised land and there's nothing going
[1:25:44] to stop them
[1:25:46] oh my we're in that same position today
[1:25:48] don't let the devil tell you
[1:25:51] oh he stopped us no he hasn't
[1:25:55] right they wandered in the wilderness
[1:25:57] for 40 years because their own unbelief
[1:25:58] but the devil didn't stop them
[1:26:00] unbelief does not hinder God
[1:26:04] brother says oh could it not be easily
[1:26:06] repeated today
[1:26:08] if God could get somebody in his hand in
[1:26:10] his control
[1:26:11] that Pillar of Fire is still alive
[1:26:14] I come from God
[1:26:15] it's eternal it's still alive that
[1:26:18] Pillar of Fire is still alive he's still
[1:26:19] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:26:22] word still is
[1:26:24] Hallelujah the word still is
[1:26:27] I'll use one last example here and then
[1:26:30] we'll close
[1:26:31] how did he keep
[1:26:35] them by the leadership of Joshua now
[1:26:37] think about it
[1:26:38] kept his word by the leadership of
[1:26:40] Joshua and so now Moses is dying is
[1:26:44] going away in Joshua 1 1 after the death
[1:26:46] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[1:26:48] to pass that the Lord speaking to Joshua
[1:26:50] the son of none Moses Minister the
[1:26:52] servant saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:26:55] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[1:26:57] thou and all these people unto the land
[1:27:00] which I do give to them
[1:27:02] even to the children of Israel
[1:27:04] every place
[1:27:05] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:27:07] upon that have I given unto you as I
[1:27:10] said unto Moses now he wasn't going to
[1:27:13] take away the fight
[1:27:15] they were still going to have to fight
[1:27:17] but he was going to make he was going to
[1:27:19] tilt the odds completely in their favor
[1:27:22] right so they would never be defeated as
[1:27:26] long as they were following the word
[1:27:28] I'm here to tell you you there's nothing
[1:27:30] negative in the word of God today as
[1:27:33] long as you follow that word you cannot
[1:27:35] be defeated
[1:27:37] right it's when we get away from the
[1:27:39] word that's when we get from behind our
[1:27:40] protection
[1:27:41] but now he said from the Wilderness in
[1:27:44] this Lebanon even into the Great River
[1:27:45] he's restating the promises of Genesis
[1:27:47] to Abraham he said the river Euphrates
[1:27:50] all the land of the Hittites unto the
[1:27:52] great sea toward the going down of the
[1:27:53] sun shall be your Coast what we have
[1:27:55] iron clad proof in the nation of Israel
[1:27:58] today that God keeps his word yes right
[1:28:01] God keeps his word
[1:28:04] I I may I don't know if I'll be able to
[1:28:06] get away but if I am I may have an
[1:28:08] opportunity to go to Israel this year
[1:28:09] and I'm thinking about going because I
[1:28:11] want to see that but it's proof it's
[1:28:12] living proof today
[1:28:14] that God keeps his word
[1:28:17] God does what he said he would do do you
[1:28:19] believe that today
[1:28:23] God does what he said he would do right
[1:28:25] he does not ever lie and the fact that
[1:28:29] there's a nation of Israel today they
[1:28:31] may be flawed in many different ways but
[1:28:33] the fact that there is a nation there is
[1:28:36] proof God said God keeps his word he
[1:28:39] said there will be Nations surrounding
[1:28:41] Israel and they'll all hate him but God
[1:28:43] keeps his word
[1:28:45] hey man that ought to be a proof to us
[1:28:47] as the spiritual Seed of Abraham God
[1:28:49] keeps his wife
[1:28:51] even over hundreds and thousands of
[1:28:53] years here Joshua stands 5 years
[1:28:57] after Abraham was given the promise 500
[1:29:00] years later Joshua stood there and God
[1:29:02] told him again he said here it is and
[1:29:04] Joshua when he got to the end of his
[1:29:06] life he said God kept his word
[1:29:09] amen
[1:29:10] amen
[1:29:12] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:29:15] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:29:17] I love this as I was with Moses so I
[1:29:20] will be with thee will not fail thee nor
[1:29:23] forsake thee
[1:29:25] strong and of a good courage
[1:29:27] under this people shalt thou divide for
[1:29:29] an inheritance to land which I swear
[1:29:30] unto their fathers to give them
[1:29:33] now there's something that people don't
[1:29:35] understand here because God does change
[1:29:37] he the method and the way that he works
[1:29:41] in different ages he but he doesn't
[1:29:43] change what he does
[1:29:45] and he doesn't change the fact that he
[1:29:48] is the one who does it
[1:29:49] right because there is times that God
[1:29:51] changes how he works through different
[1:29:54] dispensations and we know that from the
[1:29:57] story of Moses and Joshua Joshua he said
[1:29:59] as I was with Moses I will be with thee
[1:30:01] and so you would expect a pillar of fire
[1:30:02] and a pillar of cloud to lead them into
[1:30:04] the land but when they get to the land
[1:30:07] there's no Pillar of Fire
[1:30:09] now think about it there's no pillar of
[1:30:11] clout
[1:30:12] but something had happened notice what
[1:30:15] he says Joshua he said only be thou
[1:30:16] strong and very courageous the thumb is
[1:30:18] observe to do according to all the law
[1:30:20] which Moses and my servant commanded
[1:30:21] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[1:30:23] or to the left thumb is Prosper with
[1:30:25] orsoever thou goeth again the pillar of
[1:30:27] fire was no longer visible when they
[1:30:29] crossed over but Joshua now he's going
[1:30:31] to contemplate believing that God keeps
[1:30:33] his word he's going to contemplate what
[1:30:35] he's going to do and so he walks up to
[1:30:37] the walls of Jericho and begins to look
[1:30:39] at him and I'm sure he looked at him and
[1:30:40] he said well they're too strong maybe we
[1:30:42] could build ladders and go up over the
[1:30:44] top of them because he didn't know
[1:30:45] exactly what God was going to do but God
[1:30:48] was fixing to reveal that to him and the
[1:30:51] way he was going to reveal that to him
[1:30:52] was through the angel of the host the
[1:30:55] captain of The Host
[1:30:57] which was Christ in another form
[1:31:00] you remember the pillar of fire was
[1:31:01] Christ the logos that come from God
[1:31:04] build our fire is not the son of man
[1:31:05] it's the anointing but it's that part of
[1:31:07] Christ it indwelt Christ there was no
[1:31:10] Pillar of Fire when Christ was on the
[1:31:11] Earth
[1:31:12] because he was the pillar of fire it was
[1:31:14] inside of him but when he died the
[1:31:16] pillar of fire divided itself among
[1:31:17] those who received the Holy Ghost we
[1:31:19] have it today
[1:31:20] right that's the Holy Ghost but now
[1:31:22] Joshua is seeing the embodiment the
[1:31:25] pillar of fire becoming flesh
[1:31:27] right in front of him oh my so he it
[1:31:31] wasn't above him it wasn't he wasn't
[1:31:33] like the pillar of fire the pillar of
[1:31:34] cloud wasn't during the time in the
[1:31:36] Tabernacle but now he was a man of war
[1:31:38] he was going to go in with him
[1:31:40] and he was going to fight for him and
[1:31:43] Joshua pulled his sword and run to meet
[1:31:44] him and the man pulled his sword and
[1:31:45] come to meet Joshua and Joshua raised
[1:31:47] his hand and said are you for us or for
[1:31:49] our enemies
[1:31:50] and he said no I'm not for either I'm
[1:31:52] the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:31:54] he said oh my what had happened the
[1:31:56] pillar of fire had been made flesh
[1:31:58] standing here a pre-figure of the Lord
[1:32:00] Jesus Christ
[1:32:01] the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:32:04] Joshua 6 2. the Lord said it to Joshua
[1:32:08] see I have given into thine hand Jericho
[1:32:10] now this is the captain of the host
[1:32:11] speaking to Joshua
[1:32:13] he said I've given into thine hand
[1:32:15] Jericho and the King thereof and the
[1:32:16] Mighty Men of Valor
[1:32:18] who come past the city all you Men of
[1:32:20] War and go round about the city wants
[1:32:22] thus shalt thou do six days
[1:32:25] but in the seventh age I'm going to
[1:32:27] change my methods
[1:32:29] watch
[1:32:30] in the seventh day they're you're not
[1:32:32] going to go around once you're going to
[1:32:34] go around seven times
[1:32:36] seven priests shall bear the Ark of the
[1:32:37] seven trumpets of Ram's horns bear
[1:32:40] before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's
[1:32:41] horns and the seventh day you should
[1:32:43] come past the city seven times and the
[1:32:46] priests shall blow with the trumpets
[1:32:48] and it shall come to pass that when they
[1:32:49] make a long blast with the Ram's Horn
[1:32:51] when you hear the sound of the trumpet
[1:32:53] all the people shall Shout with a great
[1:32:56] shout notice that the shout was in the
[1:32:58] mouths of the people
[1:33:00] that's where the message is today
[1:33:03] and the wall of the city shall fall down
[1:33:05] flat and the people shall Ascend up
[1:33:07] every man straight before him now
[1:33:10] Jericho was the key to Canaan yeah
[1:33:14] Jericho was what unlocked or we could
[1:33:16] say opened up the land of Canaan we
[1:33:19] could say it this way Jericho was the
[1:33:21] open book
[1:33:22] right it was sealed it had walls around
[1:33:25] it but the walls were fixing to come
[1:33:28] down
[1:33:29] and so there was a there had to come the
[1:33:32] Moses Ministry had to change to a Joshua
[1:33:35] Ministry
[1:33:36] so that then they could come to Jericho
[1:33:38] I hope you're following me this morning
[1:33:40] they could come to Jericho Huma and the
[1:33:43] walls could come down
[1:33:45] now we know when they come around seven
[1:33:47] times that that was the seventh Church
[1:33:49] age and I believe that's what we're
[1:33:50] living in today it was the type of that
[1:33:52] so we're living now but watch where
[1:33:54] we're living
[1:33:55] we're living on the other side of
[1:33:57] Jericho
[1:33:58] we're living where I read in Joshua 21
[1:34:00] where he said God has kept his word yes
[1:34:04] yes there's still a few cities to take
[1:34:06] yes there's some work to be done but God
[1:34:08] has kept his word we heard a shout and
[1:34:11] the walls came down
[1:34:13] are you hearing me today the walls came
[1:34:16] down and the book came open and we
[1:34:18] walked into our land we say what came
[1:34:21] open this book the word become a new
[1:34:23] Bible to us we've been it was the same
[1:34:24] Bible but there was a light shown on it
[1:34:27] we could see what God was doing
[1:34:29] oh my
[1:34:31] God and so Joshua being a type of the
[1:34:34] Holy Ghost and the type of the messenger
[1:34:36] of this day our type is Caleb how many
[1:34:39] believe that today that's our type it's
[1:34:41] Caleb but the Holy Ghost is still eating
[1:34:44] hey man the pillar of fire never died
[1:34:46] but the Holy Ghost is still eating today
[1:34:48] Joshua could look back after going
[1:34:50] through all that trust struggle he could
[1:34:53] look back and say God kept his word
[1:34:56] and if we type that now to the opening
[1:34:59] of The Seven Seals we begin to look at
[1:35:02] it as I'm hurrying now to close and we
[1:35:04] begin to look at it in that light the
[1:35:06] god of Heaven promised evening time
[1:35:08] would have evening light
[1:35:10] in other words we had to have something
[1:35:11] we had to have an understanding to go in
[1:35:14] a Rapture because we had to have faith
[1:35:16] for a rapture
[1:35:17] and so brother Brandon would stand there
[1:35:19] with some point in his ministry he would
[1:35:21] stand there like Joshua he said three
[1:35:23] years ago this mystery was a prophecy
[1:35:26] what time is it sir but now it's history
[1:35:29] yes
[1:35:30] yes hallelujah it's past the walls that
[1:35:33] fell down
[1:35:35] the promise is fulfilled why can't
[1:35:38] people get through that the promise is
[1:35:40] fulfilled you won't be looking for
[1:35:42] something else if you know that the
[1:35:44] promise has been fulfilled God kept his
[1:35:47] word what time is it sir and what's this
[1:35:49] attraction God fulfilling his word he's
[1:35:52] the same yesterday today and forever how
[1:35:53] many believe it today
[1:35:55] God has promised his word how it would
[1:35:57] be fulfilled and how it would come to
[1:35:59] pass when he chose his bride how it
[1:36:01] would be done it's happening right
[1:36:02] before you in the name of the Lord he
[1:36:04] said and that's by the original word the
[1:36:07] evening time message is here the evening
[1:36:09] promise of the Seven Seals of Revelation
[1:36:11] 10 Malachi 4 Luke 30 and 10 read
[1:36:14] Deuteronomy 4 that's Luke 17 30
[1:36:17] Deuteronomy 4 1-4 and then the 25th and
[1:36:20] 26th first now I want to go and read
[1:36:22] that because he said see what he said
[1:36:24] about about it for this last day
[1:36:27] God kept his word do you believe it
[1:36:29] today
[1:36:30] Deuteronomy 4 and 1.
[1:36:32] now therefore hearken o Israel unto the
[1:36:34] statutes unto the judgments which I
[1:36:36] teach you to do them that you may live
[1:36:39] and go in and possess the land which the
[1:36:41] Lord God of your father has given to you
[1:36:43] you shall not add unto the word which I
[1:36:45] command you
[1:36:46] neither shall you diminish heart from it
[1:36:48] neither shall you diminish ought from it
[1:36:51] don't take stuff out and say it's past
[1:36:55] right I would say in the past you can't
[1:36:56] do it anymore
[1:36:58] like healing and miracles and things
[1:37:00] like that you can't do that you can't
[1:37:01] take it out can't take preachers out
[1:37:03] right God still does it today that you
[1:37:06] may keep the Commandments of the Lord
[1:37:07] your God which I command you your eyes
[1:37:09] have seen what the Lord did because of
[1:37:11] Bell peor
[1:37:12] all the men that followed belpure the
[1:37:14] Lord thy God hath destroyed them from
[1:37:16] among you
[1:37:17] now watch but ye that did cleave unto
[1:37:20] the Lord your God
[1:37:21] oh what a testimony this is this morning
[1:37:24] I know this is very personal but even
[1:37:26] for you watching this morning I remember
[1:37:28] the JT is probably watching this morning
[1:37:30] if he's able and sister cleteth in
[1:37:32] different ones that that have been here

[1:37:38] years and so you know you you know
[1:37:41] there's been battles you know there's
[1:37:43] been struggles
[1:37:44] but you can look back and see the
[1:37:46] scripture and this he said look at this
[1:37:48] and see what God promised in this day
[1:37:50] he said but you that did cleave unto the
[1:37:52] Lord your God
[1:37:55] you see that word cleave is the same
[1:37:57] word that's used for a marriage
[1:37:59] when a man leaves his mother and father
[1:38:01] and Cleaves to his wife
[1:38:03] you cleave to God in that way you went

[1:38:30] others there were many others that fell
[1:38:32] during the 40 Years of wilderness
[1:38:33] Journey they were wandering in the
[1:38:36] wilderness for 40 years because they
[1:38:37] would not go in and possess the land but
[1:38:39] there was two Joshua and Caleb who did
[1:38:42] go in
[1:38:43] who did possess the land right amen and
[1:38:46] those that cleave to the Lord their God
[1:38:48] were alive every one of you this day
[1:38:50] that's my testimony you can testify of
[1:38:52] death all you want to you can say the
[1:38:54] message has gone downhill you can say
[1:38:56] that there's nothing left but I'll say
[1:38:58] this we that cleave to the Lord Our God

[1:40:17] 17 years old and I come in this area and
[1:40:19] I've preach to some of you and I preach
[1:40:21] the word of God the same word I preached
[1:40:22] today well I've learned a lot I I found
[1:40:26] a lot of treasures in the in the
[1:40:28] scripture of God but I'm cleaving to the
[1:40:30] same word that I cleave to 25 years ago
[1:40:33] I'm cleaning to that same word and I
[1:40:35] believe that God has kept me I'm here to
[1:40:37] testify this morning I'm not just
[1:40:39] talking about myself you're here to
[1:40:41] testify today God keeps his word yes sir
[1:40:44] yes sir or some young couples that can
[1:40:46] testify God keeps his word in a marriage
[1:40:48] there's some there's some older couples
[1:40:50] that can testify God keeps his word with
[1:40:52] children
[1:40:55] don't you add one thing he said
[1:40:57] this was Moses saying to Israel keep
[1:40:59] every word don't add one thing that
[1:41:01] Prophet had been up there and seen that
[1:41:03] word of God it was wrote out to him and
[1:41:04] Vindicated by God's own handwriting it
[1:41:06] he said you keep every word
[1:41:08] don't you add one thing to it or take
[1:41:09] one thing from it
[1:41:11] he said if you take if you do God will
[1:41:12] take you apart from the book of life it
[1:41:13] shows you wasn't his seed but remember
[1:41:16] everything someone say everything
[1:41:18] everything that God has promised us
[1:41:21] oh that ought to make us excited today
[1:41:23] that ought to Thrill our hearts the
[1:41:25] message ought to be the thrill of our
[1:41:27] hearts today everything that God has
[1:41:29] promised us everything that God spoke to
[1:41:31] us everything that's been told to you in
[1:41:33] the name of the Lord has happened
[1:41:35] God has never made one promise no but
[1:41:38] he's kept every promise that he said he
[1:41:40] has told us has been the truth and he
[1:41:42] goes on to talk about how for 20 years
[1:41:44] he preached in Shreveport he said I'd
[1:41:46] take you to record today women past
[1:41:48] bearing men children afflictions healing
[1:41:50] prophecy things that would happen not
[1:41:51] one of them has ever failed
[1:41:53] stay away from those denominations
[1:41:55] they're leading you to death why not not
[1:41:57] because the people are bad but because
[1:41:59] denominationalism takes the word the way
[1:42:01] they their Creed says to take it if you
[1:42:04] don't agree with it you have to leave
[1:42:05] but we believe the whole scripture yes
[1:42:08] we believe the fullness of the word if
[1:42:10] it's God in God's word we believe it
[1:42:13] huh it don't matter what I say if you
[1:42:15] take what I say over the word you're no
[1:42:17] better than Catholicism right
[1:42:20] if you take what any other man says over
[1:42:21] the word it's no better than Catholicism
[1:42:23] take the word
[1:42:25] he kept his word
[1:42:27] let's look at one example of this and
[1:42:28] we'll close
[1:42:30] and Joshua gets done with Jericho
[1:42:33] it's pretty shook up
[1:42:37] the only ones that survived was Rahab
[1:42:39] they put everything to the sword and
[1:42:42] they ports the city put fire put it to
[1:42:44] fire tore it down the rubble you
[1:42:45] couldn't even find the rubble
[1:42:47] they're going back and digging in
[1:42:49] Jericho today and they find just just
[1:42:50] little pieces of rock God shook it to
[1:42:53] pieces
[1:42:54] tell you what that's coming for this
[1:42:55] nation
[1:42:56] it's coming for our world
[1:43:00] but Joshua told the people he said don't
[1:43:01] you build them walls yeah
[1:43:04] cursed be the man before the Lord that
[1:43:06] rises up and buildeth the City Jericho
[1:43:08] he shall lay the foundation in his
[1:43:10] firstborn in his youngest son it's
[1:43:11] really set up the gates of it so in
[1:43:13] other words while he's building it his
[1:43:15] children will die
[1:43:17] and so he'll name a wall after his one
[1:43:20] oldest son and a gate
[1:43:22] at the end after his youngest son
[1:43:24] oh God

[1:43:28] we've got freedom
[1:43:31] to worship god let's not rebuild those
[1:43:32] walls
[1:43:34] you finally did that in the days of Ahab
[1:43:35] in First Kings 16 33 Ahab made a Grove
[1:43:38] and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord
[1:43:40] God of Israel to anger than all the
[1:43:41] kings of Israel that were before him
[1:43:43] in his days did Heil the bethelite build
[1:43:46] Jericho he laid the foundation thereof
[1:43:48] and I Byram is firstborn set up the
[1:43:51] gates thereof and his youngest son see
[1:43:52] God in other words he named him after
[1:43:53] him because they died
[1:43:56] according to the word of the Lord would
[1:43:59] you speak by Joshua the son of none this
[1:44:00] was hundreds of years later but God
