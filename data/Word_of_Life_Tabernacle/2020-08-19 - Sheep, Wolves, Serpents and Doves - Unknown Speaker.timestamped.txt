[30:20] regardless of the
[30:22] temptations that we face the trials

[30:30] to know that you'll speak to us through
[30:32] your word we're so grateful god
[30:35] i pray that you would just move in this
[30:37] service and
[30:38] [Music]

[30:53] just come and
[30:55] take over lord my lips i don't want to
[30:57] say one thing that you didn't have me to
[30:59] say
[31:00] [Music]
[31:01] speak to your people tonight lord we we
[31:03] need you to speak now
[31:04] more than at any other time we're
[31:08] desperate lord in this lao to see an age
[31:11] there's deception everywhere we're just
[31:13] we're desperate to know truth lord and
[31:16] to know where it is and we we want to
[31:18] hear your voice we're your sheep lord we
[31:20] want to hear
[31:22] the shepherd's voice i pray you'd grant
[31:24] it to us now
[31:26] keep us in your perfect will heal every
[31:28] sick person lord every
[31:30] every person that would have a need here
[31:32] tonight may you meet that need we pray
[31:35] in jesus name amen
[31:38] amen turn with me if you would to
[31:41] matthew chapter 10
[31:44] and verse 16 i want to speak to you
[31:47] tonight
[31:48] on a subject of sheep wolves serpents
[31:52] and doves
[31:56] sheep wolves serpents and doves and you
[31:59] pray for me tonight
[32:02] i really need the help of the lord
[32:05] matthew chapter 10 and verse 16. i do
[32:07] believe this is important
[32:09] so if you don't get a chance maybe some
[32:11] don't even get a chance to stream
[32:12] tonight that they would go
[32:14] back and maybe watch this for our local
[32:17] church i believe it's important matthew
[32:19] chapter 10 and verse 16
[32:22] behold i send you forth as sheep in the
[32:24] midst of wolves
[32:27] be therefore wise as serpents and
[32:30] harmless
[32:32] as doves seems almost an impossibility
[32:35] doesn't it
[32:36] but he commanded us to do it pray the
[32:39] lord would add his blessing to the word
[32:40] and you may be seated
[32:47] jesus used four animals in one paragraph
[32:51] to identify the characteristics of his
[32:54] disciples
[32:56] as well as the world and to teach them
[32:59] how to handle themselves as believers in
[33:01] a world where
[33:03] we can't help most of the people we'll
[33:05] meet
[33:07] and that's hard because
[33:10] you know we want to help all the people
[33:12] that we meet
[33:14] but the truth is most people will never
[33:16] be helped
[33:18] and so jesus tells them he said i send
[33:20] you forth as sheep among the wolves the
[33:24] wolves
[33:24] are not going to want anything good for
[33:26] you and
[33:28] they're going to be out to get you and
[33:29] yet sometimes
[33:31] in this world that we live in especially
[33:33] in this age
[33:36] not only can we not help most of the
[33:37] people but we don't even know who we can
[33:40] help many times
[33:43] and he sends us forth as sheep among
[33:45] wolves but the wolves wear sheep's
[33:47] clothing and
[33:48] we aren't always sure who is who
[33:53] he tells us to be wise as serpents
[33:56] and harmless as doves
[33:59] i know that just by nature some folks
[34:01] tend to be more wise and
[34:03] and that is to be cautious and we'll get
[34:06] to the meaning of the word
[34:07] in a moment but some folks are more
[34:09] prone to be careful
[34:12] and others are more prone to be harmless
[34:14] and or innocent
[34:16] and and welcoming and
[34:19] the difficult thing is to be both
[34:22] especially if you've been hurt a few
[34:24] times
[34:25] to be harmless after you've been hurt is
[34:27] hard
[34:29] it's hard not to be cynical and it's
[34:32] also
[34:33] hard to be wise
[34:37] when you want the best for people
[34:40] and and you want the right things you
[34:42] want people to be saved
[34:44] and if we didn't have that kind of an
[34:46] attitude we might as well back up and go
[34:47] home
[34:50] if we didn't want people to be saved but
[34:52] people have to want to be saved
[34:56] but we take that and i take that
[34:57] personally i i don't want to see a
[34:59] person that i've ever preached to in my
[35:01] life
[35:02] be lost but i realize that we're sheep
[35:04] among wolves
[35:06] and not everybody's going to be saved
[35:08] and the majority of the people that we
[35:10] meet in the world are not going to be
[35:11] but oh how i would want them to be
[35:15] i wouldn't want one to be lost
[35:19] i don't want to be cynical i don't want
[35:22] to get hurt to the point where i can't
[35:23] believe in people
[35:28] god help me to be harmless but yet he
[35:31] said to be wise
[35:35] and you know just in the natural men
[35:37] tend to be
[35:38] more wise in that sense to be more
[35:40] cautious and
[35:42] when it comes to and more discerning in
[35:44] in the ability
[35:46] to see whether someone is sincere or not
[35:49] but
[35:49] women tend to be more open and and
[35:51] welcoming and
[35:52] god made them that way there's nothing
[35:54] wrong with a woman being that way it's
[35:55] the way a woman is
[35:58] and god made him when he separated eve
[36:00] from adam he
[36:01] separated out the feminist spirit and so
[36:03] he separated out that part that
[36:05] the good part we could say the part
[36:07] that's likable and
[36:08] and loving and all of this and and left
[36:11] us with the burly part and the ugly part
[36:13] and
[36:14] and you know and and there's part of a
[36:17] man
[36:18] that you and god set it up that way and
[36:21] then
[36:21] when the woman fell in the garden then
[36:24] and adam fell
[36:25] as well adam fell his sin was greater in
[36:27] one way because he knew what he was
[36:28] doing
[36:30] but eve fell by being deceived and so
[36:35] because she was deceived paul tells us
[36:37] that she can't lead the church
[36:39] you can't take authority over a man
[36:40] because a woman can be
[36:42] gullible and yet i've known men who were
[36:45] gullible
[36:46] and women who were cynical based on what
[36:50] they've been through
[36:54] and we're sheep we're not made for
[36:56] combat
[36:59] or aggression that's not what we do
[37:04] and yet we're soldiers in the army of
[37:05] the lord i realize that but
[37:07] but sheep are innocent animals they're
[37:10] harmless that's what
[37:12] their sheep are harmless and and they'll
[37:15] be at a disadvantage in any
[37:16] confrontation with a wolf
[37:19] and you have to remember that in any
[37:22] confrontation with a wolf a sheep will
[37:23] be at a disadvantage because
[37:25] they will not think that the wolf is
[37:28] going to be what the wolf is or do what
[37:30] the wolf does
[37:32] they won't presume that about somebody
[37:36] and so the only way for a sheep to have
[37:38] the advantage over a wolf is to stay in
[37:40] the fold
[37:42] and have complete trust in the shepherd
[37:46] sheep are also helpless they're helpless
[37:48] without a shepherd and they have
[37:50] to learn to listen to his voice brother
[37:51] bruce and learn to hear
[37:53] that still small voice and recognize and
[37:56] discern between
[37:57] the shepherd and a hireling they have to
[37:59] learn to do that and it's hard
[38:01] because there's so many voices in the
[38:03] world today
[38:05] sheep social creatures they want to be
[38:07] together
[38:08] when it's hot they huddle together for
[38:10] shade and guess what they do when it
[38:12] gets cold
[38:14] they huddle together for warmth
[38:19] and so sheep want to be together
[38:22] they want to be in the house of god they
[38:24] want to be with other christians
[38:26] and they're content as long as they can
[38:27] see the shepherd and know that he's
[38:29] there and
[38:30] well joe and i talked today about how
[38:32] you want to feel that presence of god
[38:33] you want
[38:34] you just want to know that he's there
[38:36] you know that's not what you base your
[38:37] faith on but
[38:38] but you still want to feel that you
[38:41] still want to know that and
[38:43] and so we're sheep we're content we want
[38:46] to see the shepherd
[38:47] we want to see one another we want to be
[38:49] able to look one another in the eye and
[38:51] and fellowship one with another
[38:56] and so he identifies the world he said
[38:59] it sends you out as
[39:00] sheep among wolves and he identifies the
[39:01] wolves as being
[39:03] uh and the characteristics of a wolf
[39:06] would be someone who's self-led
[39:09] and so woes run together in a pack like
[39:12] sheep or in a bunch or group
[39:14] or a flock but one of their own is their
[39:17] leader
[39:19] and i read a quote to you not long ago
[39:21] or brother branham said that sheep can't
[39:23] lead sheep
[39:26] but goat can lead them to the slaughter
[39:29] the sheep don't lead sheep and
[39:31] and so sheep submit themselves to an
[39:34] appointed shepherd but wolves fight it
[39:36] out among themselves
[39:38] to see who the most dominant wolf will
[39:40] be
[39:42] and it's the characteristics of a wolf
[39:46] and we see it with competition among
[39:48] ministries and things it's not right
[39:49] because
[39:51] it becomes a wolf mentality who can get
[39:53] to the top we're not
[39:56] interested in getting to the top we're
[39:57] interested in getting to the truth
[40:00] and getting to heaven
[40:04] wolves are very deceptive woes are not
[40:06] above using deceptive means to
[40:08] accomplish their goal
[40:09] they even try to appear as sheep and
[40:12] sheep's clothing and patiently waiting
[40:13] for a moment
[40:14] when the sheep are alone to make their
[40:17] move they'll wait for
[40:18] a long time to take out a sheep
[40:23] those are ultimately takers all they do
[40:26] is take
[40:28] they take from the flock they take from
[40:30] the herd they constantly
[40:31] take for their own good but sheep are
[40:35] givers
[40:37] sheep bare wool sheep lay down allow
[40:40] themselves to be sheared
[40:42] how could a wolf and a sheep ever come
[40:44] together in a confrontation
[40:45] the wolf would just tear him to pieces
[40:49] and so don't be discouraged if you find
[40:52] yourself at times deceived by wolves
[40:55] and at times in trouble because of woes
[40:59] don't be discouraged by that because
[41:01] it's just the world we live in
[41:04] but also we can be wise he says because
[41:08] you're sheep going among wolves this is
[41:10] how you need to act be wise as a serpent
[41:13] harmless as a dove but you know it's
[41:16] important to know
[41:17] as we go through this that you are among
[41:19] wolves
[41:21] when ronald reagan began dealing with
[41:22] the soviets on nuclear weapons he
[41:24] used an old russian proverb that says
[41:27] trust but verify
[41:30] trust but verify it's hard to do both
[41:34] in fact in modern diplomacy they've kind
[41:35] of rejected that because they said it's
[41:37] impossible to do both
[41:39] when it comes to dealing with iran they
[41:40] said verify and verify
[41:42] because how do you trust them but
[41:46] trust verifies what he did he said okay
[41:47] i trust you
[41:49] i'm just going to make sure that you
[41:51] really are stopping making those weapons
[41:54] because he knew he was among wolves he
[41:56] knew if they could they would lie to him
[41:59] right and that's the kind of wisdom and
[42:02] again you have to be careful that it
[42:03] doesn't go over into cynicism
[42:05] but you have to realize that people
[42:08] human beings
[42:09] tell lies and human beings often
[42:13] don't tell the truth and you've got to
[42:14] verify
[42:17] your own flesh will lie to you
[42:22] it will it tells you you can't go to
[42:24] church when you could
[42:27] your flesh lies to you it tells you how
[42:29] sick you are and how
[42:31] you're not a child of god and your own
[42:32] mind will lie to you
[42:35] and you have to you have to be able to
[42:37] overcome that verify
[42:38] check it with the word see if it's true
[42:43] and so paul gets this to us in first
[42:45] corinthians 14 and 20 said brethren
[42:47] be not children and understanding albeit
[42:50] in malice be
[42:52] children but an understanding be men
[42:56] know what you're dealing with you're
[42:58] going to be eating the life
[43:00] we've got to understand what age we live
[43:01] in in romans 16 and 17 he said now i
[43:04] beseech you brethren
[43:05] mark them which cause divisions and
[43:07] offenses
[43:08] contrary to the doctrine which you have
[43:10] learned and avoid them
[43:12] for they that are such serve not our
[43:14] lord jesus christ but their own belly or
[43:16] their own
[43:17] appetites by good words and fair
[43:20] speeches deceive the hearts of the
[43:22] simple
[43:23] for your obedience has come abroad unto
[43:25] all men he said i'm glad therefore on
[43:27] your behalf
[43:28] but yet i would have you wise unto that
[43:30] which is good
[43:32] and simple concerning evil he's saying
[43:35] the same thing be wise as serpents
[43:38] harmless as doves
[43:42] and jesus tells us to be like serpents
[43:44] in only one very specific way because a
[43:46] serpent
[43:47] is a very bad animal it's a type of evil
[43:52] but he says be like them in one way now
[43:54] you'll never be as good a serpent as the
[43:56] serpent
[43:59] you can't out serpent the serpent and
[44:01] jesus puts it this way he says
[44:03] the children of of this world and their
[44:05] generation are wiser than the children
[44:07] of light
[44:09] and so they're always going to be better
[44:10] at it
[44:12] but yet we do have to use our brains
[44:16] right and understand that we can't just
[44:19] deal in an emotional realm where we're
[44:23] going on what emotion is but we have to
[44:26] be able to look at the word and just see
[44:28] what what the fruits of something are
[44:31] and so and there's a this
[44:35] word wise when he says to be wise as a
[44:36] serpent is to be thoughtful
[44:39] discreet cautious and it indicates
[44:43] intelligence in a bad sense it means
[44:45] conceited
[44:47] let's turn to matthew chapter 7 and
[44:49] verse 15 and i'm just going to take a
[44:51] lot of scripture tonight and i hope
[44:53] you can bear with me but we should be
[44:54] able to read the scripture and
[44:56] believe it shouldn't we if we can read
[44:59] the scripture and see exactly what he
[45:01] says
[45:01] and so he says beware of false prophets
[45:05] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[45:07] but inwardly
[45:09] are ravening wolves they're not just
[45:11] wolves they're hungry wolves
[45:14] huh so he said beware of false prophets
[45:17] they're they're hungry wolves
[45:19] he said you shall know them by their
[45:20] fruits and brother branham and one place
[45:23] says that's their teaching
[45:24] he also identifies it as as their manner
[45:26] of life if you think about it as a
[45:28] preacher
[45:29] it would be your teaching it would also
[45:31] be your life as
[45:32] an individual more often than not it
[45:33] would be your life your fruits how you
[45:36] live according
[45:37] to your life line with the word brother
[45:38] branham says that in relation to this
[45:41] he said do men gather graves of thorns
[45:44] or figs of thistles
[45:47] he said even so every good tree bringeth
[45:49] forth good fruit but a corrupt tree
[45:50] bringeth forth evil fruit
[45:52] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[45:54] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[45:56] forth good fruit
[45:58] he said every tree that bringeth forth
[46:00] not forth good fruit is hewn down
[46:02] and cast into the fire wherefore by
[46:05] their fruits
[46:07] you shall know them and this
[46:10] is the manifesting time this is the time
[46:12] for the fruits to come out
[46:15] what people really are is coming out now
[46:18] because the influence of laodicea is so
[46:21] strong on the world
[46:22] that it's going to push those fruits out
[46:24] they're getting
[46:25] if you could say it this way they're
[46:26] getting worldly vitamins
[46:30] if you have a tendency to sin before
[46:33] you're really going to do it now
[46:35] because it's easier than it's ever been
[46:38] those vitamins are pushing out in the
[46:40] world it's causing them to prepare them
[46:42] for
[46:43] the satan's eating that's that's easy to
[46:46] sin
[46:47] in but i'm so thankful at the same time
[46:50] we have a word
[46:51] it was sent to in our hour that we can
[46:54] we can overcome those things
[46:57] and so in the hour that they're
[46:58] manifesting the false we can manifest
[47:00] the true
[47:02] if we feed on the truth if we believe
[47:06] the truth if
[47:07] if there's something there that can be
[47:09] bear fruit now
[47:11] i'll stop here and we'll come back to
[47:13] matthew chapter 7
[47:15] because there's much more in this
[47:16] chapter that we want to put with that
[47:20] but brother branham says this and things
[47:21] that are to be said remember the bible
[47:23] said in the last days there shall come
[47:24] false christs not false jesus
[47:26] they wouldn't stand still for that but
[47:28] false christs false anointed ones
[47:30] they're absolutely anointed with the
[47:33] holy spirit
[47:34] and still false he said there's three
[47:37] people of you
[47:39] the outside is the body you've got five
[47:41] senses that you contact your earthly
[47:43] home with that the inside is a spirit
[47:45] there's five senses there love and
[47:47] conscience and so forth you contact
[47:49] but the inside of that is the soul he
[47:52] said and remember the rain falls on the
[47:54] just and the unjust
[47:56] the same rain that will make a grain of
[47:57] wheat grow makes the cuckleberg grow too
[48:00] what is it that the inside of that seed
[48:02] is in nature
[48:03] and listen and that nature displays
[48:06] itself
[48:10] and and you know i believe it was james
[48:12] put it this way if a man says he loves
[48:14] god and hates his brother
[48:16] how do you believe him right because his
[48:19] nature displays himself
[48:22] man says i love god won't go to church
[48:25] won't live for god won't do what's right
[48:26] just refuses to do it
[48:28] what are you supposed to believe
[48:31] right you're supposed to believe the
[48:32] fruits of it
[48:35] and so and if you just bear with me
[48:38] tonight i'm trying to to say this in a
[48:40] way that we'll understand but
[48:42] the same rain that'll make a grain of
[48:43] wheat grow makes the cuckerborg grow too
[48:45] he said at the inside of that scene as
[48:46] the nature and the nature displays
[48:48] itself
[48:48] it can stand in the same field right
[48:51] there with the weed
[48:52] the weed and the wheat stand together
[48:55] rejoice just as much
[48:57] its head is down it's starving for a
[48:59] drink
[49:00] when rain comes the cockleberry can
[49:02] shout just as loud as the weekend
[49:04] but by their fruits you shall know them
[49:07] so you don't judge anything before the
[49:08] time good or bad
[49:11] right when the rain comes don't judge
[49:13] that based on the rain
[49:15] but judge it based on what happens after
[49:17] the service
[49:22] let's go back to matthew chapter 7 and
[49:24] verse 21
[49:26] he says not everyone that saith unto me
[49:28] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[49:29] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[49:31] my father which is in heaven
[49:33] and this is that same chapter just
[49:35] continuing he said
[49:36] many will say to me in that day lord
[49:38] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[49:40] and in thy name have cast out devils in
[49:42] thy name done many wonderful works
[49:45] then while i profess unto them i never
[49:46] knew you
[49:48] depart from me that work iniquity
[49:51] notice what he says you that work
[49:52] iniquity therefore whosoever heareth
[49:55] these sayings of mine
[49:56] now watch it just continues on down he
[49:59] said whosoever heareth these sayings of
[50:00] mine and doeth them i will liken
[50:02] him unto a wise man and that word for
[50:04] wise is the same word that's used
[50:07] when he says be wise as serpents
[50:10] so he said i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you
[50:12] a parable about
[50:14] a man who's cautious and prepares
[50:17] himself for the storm
[50:20] and the man that hears the things i'm
[50:22] saying
[50:23] about there being wheat and tares
[50:26] about there being false prophets on the
[50:28] earth and many that will say have not
[50:30] done these things the man that hears
[50:33] these sayings of mine and doeth them
[50:35] he said i will liken him unto a wise man
[50:39] which built his house upon a rock is not
[50:41] where you want your house to be built
[50:42] tonight
[50:44] he built his house upon a rock and the
[50:46] rain descended
[50:48] and the floods came and the winds blew
[50:51] and beat upon that house and it fell not
[50:53] for it was founded yeah it's got this
[50:56] foundation
[50:57] on a rock
[51:01] he said and everyone that heareth these
[51:02] things they'll notice they both hear
[51:06] but one doesn't do anything about it
[51:09] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[51:10] mine who doeth them not should be
[51:12] likened unto a foolish man
[51:14] which built his house upon the sand and
[51:16] said oh it'll be okay
[51:18] and notice what happens to him the exact
[51:20] same thing that happened to the wise man
[51:23] happens to the foolish man life happens
[51:27] he's the sheep among wolves
[51:31] and the rain descended and the floods
[51:34] came
[51:34] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[51:36] house and it fell
[51:39] and great was the fall of it it didn't
[51:41] just fall it disintegrated
[51:46] well it was built wrong to start with
[51:49] and the man who built it wasn't wise
[51:51] that's the same word the same word is
[51:52] also used
[51:53] in matthew 25 we won't go there to save
[51:55] time but you can look it up later it's
[51:58] the wise and foolish virgins the wise
[52:01] had oil
[52:02] in their vessels with their lamps
[52:05] they were cautious they took care to
[52:07] make sure
[52:08] that they were they were wise they knew
[52:11] they needed the holy ghost
[52:12] in order to overcome this deception in
[52:14] this age
[52:16] look they carried oil and i would say to
[52:17] us we need to be wise like that
[52:21] we'll talk some more about that but does
[52:24] who tells us be like serpents and doves
[52:28] those are interesting because he says be
[52:32] harmless that word is innocent or simple
[52:35] it literally means
[52:36] unmixed don't have any guile
[52:41] that's hard because every time you come
[52:45] across a situation you mix it with
[52:47] things you've been through in the past
[52:49] and this is difficult for us and i know
[52:51] especially in this area if there ever
[52:53] was
[52:53] people that had a right to be have a
[52:56] little guile when it comes to ministry
[52:57] it would be us
[52:59] or people in this area anyway
[53:02] and some of us have been around the
[53:03] message long enough that we've seen
[53:04] everything
[53:06] and so you tend to have a little bit of
[53:07] a guile you can have a little bit of
[53:11] of you you step back and that's good to
[53:13] a point
[53:14] but you also have to be simple innocent
[53:18] harmless and that's what's hard for me
[53:21] you know
[53:22] if you can't tell i'm preaching at
[53:23] myself tonight
[53:27] really hard i'm trying to keep my spirit
[53:31] right too so you all pray with me
[53:34] see when you're when you're dealing with
[53:36] people
[53:38] as opposed to dealing with god because
[53:40] we know who god is
[53:43] and what god will do you don't have to
[53:45] have any
[53:46] guile no you don't have to have any uh
[53:49] wise
[53:49] with god you don't deal with god wise as
[53:51] a serpent
[53:53] he didn't tell you to be wise as a
[53:54] serpent dealing with god
[53:56] or dealing in the scriptures he said be
[53:58] wise as a serpent because
[54:00] among the wolves right because the
[54:04] worlds are out to get you
[54:06] so when dealing with people
[54:09] you always assume the best but be
[54:12] prepared for the worst
[54:16] you must be cautious
[54:19] always have a house that would withstand
[54:21] the storm
[54:23] but on the other hand don't assume that
[54:24] every wind is that kind of storm
[54:27] or you'll live your life in your storm
[54:29] shelter
[54:31] i remember my dad he uh
[54:34] he didn't like storms and so every time
[54:36] a little storm went up we went to the
[54:38] cellar and our cellar was
[54:39] 50 feet from the house and it was it had
[54:41] no elect had one light bulb in it and
[54:43] it leaked when it rained and it was
[54:45] scary and it had spiders in it and
[54:48] it was an old root cellar and so we
[54:50] would all run down
[54:52] there whenever it would storm and
[54:54] frankly i got sick
[54:55] of it and so when i got married and now
[54:58] my wife can hardly get me out of bed
[54:59] when there's a storm
[55:02] i don't remember we had a basement in
[55:03] pigott i don't think maybe one time i
[55:05] can remember
[55:06] in the entire time that we lived there i
[55:07] ever went in that basement because of a
[55:09] storm
[55:10] because i just it just don't bother me
[55:12] like it did my dad but my dad was afraid
[55:14] in every little kind of wind maybe he
[55:17] had been through that i think he had
[55:18] been through a tornado when he was
[55:19] younger and so every little wind was
[55:21] that kind of storm
[55:23] and you've got to remember that it's not
[55:25] that way
[55:26] it won't always be this hard
[55:30] and you can't treat future relationships
[55:33] like that you can't
[55:34] go into them with that kind because you
[55:35] get what you expect
[55:39] and so you just because every other
[55:41] thing that's happened around you has
[55:42] fallen you've got to move on and still
[55:44] believe in somebody
[55:47] you can't get any help from anybody you
[55:49] can't help anybody
[55:51] so that's being harmless as a doe always
[55:54] assume the best be prepared for the
[55:55] worst
[55:57] we have to be cautious but don't let
[55:58] your caution cause you to be cold and
[56:00] indifferent
[56:02] i lack love i'm preaching it myself
[56:07] because i i've been down the road a few
[56:09] times and i've dealt with people and
[56:11] i've dealt
[56:11] and i'm dealing now with people even in
[56:13] my family and he may be listening
[56:15] tonight
[56:16] but you know i've dealt with people who
[56:19] always always tell you the best
[56:22] but after a while you get really jaded
[56:24] because you watch their life and you
[56:26] think
[56:27] is are they ever going to is it ever
[56:30] going to be any different and yet i have
[56:31] to keep that
[56:33] ability to reach out
[56:37] and understand at the same time that i
[56:39] can't let it come in
[56:41] and and be a harm to my family or to my
[56:44] church
[56:45] so that there's a line that you've got
[56:47] to walk and it's hard
[56:49] you've got to be cautious and it may
[56:52] seem impossible to be
[56:53] cautious and not be cold but
[56:56] wisdom and prudence actually enables us
[57:00] to be innocent and harmless
[57:03] that if we'll set the right boundaries
[57:06] and do things in the right way and
[57:09] require
[57:10] something of people
[57:14] if we do that then we actually
[57:18] set up a place where we can be secure
[57:22] you know you have locks on your doors at
[57:25] home most of you do
[57:26] we didn't have a lot growing up our old
[57:30] farmhouse we never had a key to it
[57:33] but now we have locks on our doors we
[57:34] wouldn't think of leaving our house
[57:36] unlocked
[57:38] and so it's always locked up what's the
[57:40] lock for well you know if a thief really
[57:41] wants to get in
[57:43] he's going to get in i went to a cyber
[57:46] security conference one time and
[57:48] and the instructor was telling us locks
[57:50] are to keep honest people honest
[57:54] they're not really for thieves and they
[57:56] were telling us in cyber security that
[57:58] they're always the criminals are always
[57:59] a step ahead they're always the ones
[58:02] that are winning the
[58:03] the battle as far as technology and the
[58:05] law's always trying to catch up
[58:06] but they make these locks and all these
[58:08] codes and everything
[58:10] to keep the people that are honest
[58:11] honest to make sure that you don't just
[58:14] give an opportunity for somebody to be
[58:15] tempted
[58:16] to steal some money right and so
[58:21] wisdom and prudence actually enables you
[58:23] to be
[58:24] at ease in your home because you've
[58:27] taken the proper steps to make sure
[58:29] that the boogeyman can't get in so you
[58:32] can sit there and
[58:34] in a little bit more caution you know
[58:35] you you sit at home maybe in your easy
[58:37] chair and you hear something outside
[58:39] but you've got your security lights
[58:40] you've got your cameras or you've got
[58:42] your
[58:42] locks you know you lock the house and
[58:44] you know that everything's done you can
[58:46] be at
[58:46] ease i watched a documentary here not
[58:49] long ago on the london
[58:50] tower and the tower of london and every
[58:53] night for the last
[58:54] 800 years there's been a ceremony that's
[58:57] called the keep ceremony of the keys
[59:00] and they take these keys and and a man
[59:03] walks up a guard walks up and takes the
[59:05] keys to the tower of london and presents
[59:06] them
[59:07] to uh the head guard and he says
[59:10] everything's locked up and whatever that
[59:12] they do and they go through this
[59:13] ceremony it's been happening for 800
[59:15] years
[59:16] the reason is because 800 years ago a
[59:18] king came home
[59:20] that was a palace then and found his
[59:23] castle unlocked
[59:27] and of course after some people lost
[59:28] their heads
[59:30] he mandated and nothing bad happened but
[59:34] he said hey
[59:35] if the castle's unlocked look what could
[59:37] take place
[59:39] i want to be able to sit there and be my
[59:41] be a king in my lazy boy
[59:43] because i know the house is locked right
[59:46] and so being wise as a serpent
[59:48] actually causes you to be harmless as a
[59:50] dove if you do it in the right way
[59:55] the principle works in relationships as
[59:58] well i worked some
[1:00:03] a few years ago with a young lady who
[1:00:04] was an attorney
[1:00:07] almost my age but she had done a lot
[1:00:09] better in life obviously and
[1:00:11] had her law degree actually she worked
[1:00:14] in the next office from me i worked in
[1:00:16] one office she worked across the parking
[1:00:17] lot
[1:00:18] one year both of us had to get
[1:00:20] continuing education credits and
[1:00:22] we had to go to columbia missouri to do
[1:00:24] it and of course our bosses just assumed
[1:00:26] we would ride together
[1:00:29] locks keep honest people honest
[1:00:34] they were leaving on a sunday about six
[1:00:36] o'clock and i
[1:00:37] for some reason my boss he's a good man
[1:00:39] he was a good man but
[1:00:41] and church going man he just didn't
[1:00:43] understand why he had to pay two people
[1:00:45] to drive up there
[1:00:48] and i had to come up with something well
[1:00:49] i preach on sunday nights they were
[1:00:50] leaving about six o'clock and our
[1:00:52] service started at four
[1:00:53] i called made sure that i was preaching
[1:00:55] that night
[1:00:58] and then you know i'm not a long-winded
[1:00:59] preacher not usually maybe tonight but
[1:01:01] not usually
[1:01:02] no i won't hold you along tonight but
[1:01:04] you know i'm not usually but that night
[1:01:06] i was a little bit
[1:01:09] because i wanted to be able to honestly
[1:01:10] say that i left after six o'clock
[1:01:14] and i probably she probably beat me to
[1:01:16] the class or wherever we were going by
[1:01:19] five minutes but i didn't ride with her
[1:01:24] not because i'm scared of what i might
[1:01:25] do
[1:01:27] but because i want my marriage built on
[1:01:30] a rock
[1:01:32] where my family understands and knows
[1:01:35] that they can have the confidence that
[1:01:37] that these things are these things are
[1:01:39] everything is proper
[1:01:44] i want to be clear about this
[1:01:47] we have no business running around the
[1:01:49] country with and spending hours alone
[1:01:50] with someone of the opposite sex that
[1:01:51] we're not married to
[1:01:53] no business at all
[1:01:56] if we're not married to them we need to
[1:01:58] observe the same thing that we would
[1:02:00] want our kids to observe
[1:02:03] no matter how old we are
[1:02:06] you know billy graham had a rule and
[1:02:11] president pence was made fun of for
[1:02:13] following it but this is the billy
[1:02:15] graham rule
[1:02:16] and again locks keep honest people
[1:02:18] honest not that we would do anything
[1:02:20] wrong but we want to do everything right
[1:02:23] and i'm telling you a hundred times out
[1:02:25] of a hundred it'll lead to trouble
[1:02:29] and you may be the the one
[1:02:32] person in a million that wouldn't but a
[1:02:34] hundred times out of a hundred
[1:02:35] it's still going to lead to trouble and
[1:02:38] you set a wrong example
[1:02:40] and so the billy graham rule is we
[1:02:42] pledged among ourselves to avoid any
[1:02:43] situation that would have even the
[1:02:45] appearance of compromise or suspicion
[1:02:48] and they did this in 1948 he said from
[1:02:50] that day on i did not travel meet or eat
[1:02:53] alone with a woman other than my wife
[1:02:55] we determined that the apostle paul's
[1:02:57] mandate to the young pastor timothy
[1:02:59] would be ours as well flee
[1:03:00] youthful lust
[1:03:04] and nobody has to wonder brother branham
[1:03:07] talked about a
[1:03:08] a minister and you just forgive me i
[1:03:10] know most of you this is not a problem
[1:03:12] but
[1:03:13] but i have to deal with it a minister
[1:03:15] come here from a
[1:03:16] foreign country and he saw him riding
[1:03:18] around in a car with the lady and he
[1:03:19] went and inquired and they said he'd
[1:03:20] been several days
[1:03:22] and this woman brother branham knew that
[1:03:24] she'd been married three or four times
[1:03:26] brother adam asked if he could speak
[1:03:28] with him and took him to the room and he
[1:03:29] said to the minister he said you're a
[1:03:30] stranger in this land but
[1:03:32] this lady has quite a name and this man
[1:03:35] was going to straighten brother branham
[1:03:36] out on his doctrine
[1:03:38] he said you know this woman is different
[1:03:42] she's a saint but brother brown said
[1:03:44] everybody that looks at her
[1:03:45] is not a saint
[1:03:48] and he said i believe you better be
[1:03:51] careful and
[1:03:52] he said i know but he said you know i'm
[1:03:54] going to straighten you out a little bit
[1:03:55] he said i had this
[1:03:56] this dream he called it a vision and he
[1:03:59] saw in this dream his wife
[1:04:01] living with another man running around
[1:04:03] coming back and saying i'm sorry
[1:04:04] he said then he realized the
[1:04:06] interpretation of it was that woman and
[1:04:08] she could marry all the time she wanted
[1:04:10] to because the lord loved her so much
[1:04:13] and brother branham says this and i just
[1:04:15] got this part of the quote
[1:04:17] just so we could hurry along tonight but
[1:04:19] he said your vision was mighty sweet
[1:04:22] but it was way off the beaten path
[1:04:25] i said that's wrong you shouldn't do
[1:04:28] that
[1:04:29] and i think brother branham was being
[1:04:31] harmless when he said that by the way
[1:04:33] he didn't accuse him of anything he just
[1:04:36] said it's wrong to look like that
[1:04:40] galatians 5 13 says for brethren you've
[1:04:42] been called unto liberty
[1:04:45] use not liberty for an occasion to the
[1:04:47] flesh
[1:04:49] what's an occasion it's uh and it said
[1:04:51] but by love serve one another
[1:04:53] an occasion is a place from which a
[1:04:55] movement or attack is made
[1:04:57] don't give the devil a beach to land on
[1:05:03] that's what they realized in in
[1:05:06] different places around the world in
[1:05:07] world war ii when they did amphibious
[1:05:09] landings that you had to protect the
[1:05:10] beach because if they ever got a beach
[1:05:12] hold
[1:05:13] then they would keep driving they
[1:05:15] wouldn't stop
[1:05:16] and if the devil ever gets a hold on
[1:05:18] something in your life he's going to
[1:05:19] keep increasing it
[1:05:20] he's not going to just stop there don't
[1:05:24] let
[1:05:24] liberty be an occasion to the flesh but
[1:05:27] serve one another by love
[1:05:29] and so it's actually the standard that
[1:05:31] we keep that allows us not to be cynical
[1:05:33] with one another
[1:05:35] huh where we could actually have the
[1:05:38] freedom that we should have in our
[1:05:40] services
[1:05:41] because we know we're not partaking in
[1:05:43] these things
[1:05:45] and we should trust people who we don't
[1:05:47] know there's no reason
[1:05:49] to go around spreading stories on people
[1:05:51] or listening to gossip
[1:05:54] that's wrong but that's part of being
[1:05:57] harmless so
[1:05:58] first thessalonians 5 19-20 i told you i
[1:06:00] had a lot of scripture
[1:06:03] paul says quench not the spirit that's
[1:06:04] being harmless
[1:06:06] and so if someone if the spirit of god
[1:06:08] is moving don't quench it don't assume
[1:06:10] that it's wrong
[1:06:13] god's doing something assume that it's
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:17] but he says despise not prophesying so
[1:06:19] someone prophesies
[1:06:21] don't assume it's wrong but prove all
[1:06:24] things
[1:06:26] and don't hold to that that's wrong but
[1:06:29] hold fast to that which is good
[1:06:34] so something supernatural happens you
[1:06:36] you accept it
[1:06:38] but you don't just you don't just give
[1:06:41] up all of your
[1:06:42] wisdom in that but you prove it
[1:06:46] and you hold fast to the part that's
[1:06:47] good so he says abstain from all
[1:06:50] appearance
[1:06:51] of evil brother branham uses the term
[1:06:53] shun the appearance of evil
[1:06:55] and he uses the illustration you can go
[1:06:57] find it in the message of a car
[1:06:58] coming at you he said if you see it
[1:07:01] coming you you go this way and that way
[1:07:02] and you swerve around
[1:07:04] because you do anything you can to get
[1:07:05] out of the way
[1:07:07] because you see it coming and so he says
[1:07:10] when you see up evil coming you see the
[1:07:12] appearance of evil
[1:07:13] shine it abstain from it
[1:07:16] let's look at jude 1 20. see we want to
[1:07:19] be able to help people and i'm sorry i
[1:07:21] know
[1:07:22] i i feel terrible
[1:07:27] even myself because i don't always
[1:07:30] i don't always keep this line just like
[1:07:33] i should
[1:07:35] and i feel bad because i feel like you
[1:07:37] know those of you that are here
[1:07:39] the faithful few i don't want to beat
[1:07:41] you over the head i never do that
[1:07:44] we need to be right with god
[1:07:48] jude the book of jude chapter one
[1:07:51] there's only one
[1:07:52] one chapter verse 20.
[1:07:56] it says but you beloved i believe that's
[1:07:58] us tonight
[1:08:00] we're the beloved of god building up
[1:08:03] yourselves on your most holy faith
[1:08:05] praying in the holy ghost keep
[1:08:07] yourselves in the love of god
[1:08:10] what is that that's that that
[1:08:12] harmlessness
[1:08:14] keep yourselves in the love of god don't
[1:08:15] get cynical
[1:08:18] don't let the things that happen in your
[1:08:20] life get you to a place where you can't
[1:08:22] love people
[1:08:24] looking for mercy
[1:08:28] looking for the mercy this should be our
[1:08:30] outlook looking for the mercy of our
[1:08:32] lord jesus christ unto eternal life
[1:08:34] we should look for mercy in ourselves we
[1:08:36] should look for mercy in others
[1:08:40] we we should always do that why would i
[1:08:43] ever
[1:08:44] want to make someone's road harder and
[1:08:46] let me tell you something every time you
[1:08:47] repeat gossip you make someone's road
[1:08:50] harder
[1:08:53] even if it's true
[1:08:59] if you want to know about something talk
[1:09:01] to somebody who knows not to somebody
[1:09:02] who just heard
[1:09:08] he said then some have compassion making
[1:09:11] a difference
[1:09:12] that's what i want to be able to do i
[1:09:14] want to have compassion on
[1:09:15] those that i can have compassion on
[1:09:18] those who will accept compassion
[1:09:21] but he said others save with fear and
[1:09:24] he's not saying use
[1:09:25] fear to save them it's never right to
[1:09:27] beat the people over the head with fear
[1:09:30] it's not what he's saying but he says
[1:09:32] save with fear
[1:09:33] not fear for not give them fear
[1:09:36] but fear yourself save with fear
[1:09:40] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[1:09:42] the garments spotted by the flesh he
[1:09:43] uses the illusion
[1:09:44] of leprosy treat it like you would a
[1:09:48] leprosy a case of leprosy that you don't
[1:09:50] want to be spotted by it
[1:09:52] so you pull them from the fire
[1:09:55] but you have to be sure that you're not
[1:09:57] contaminated
[1:09:59] by the garment i knew a man
[1:10:03] a wesleyan preacher and i've always
[1:10:04] wondered what happened to him
[1:10:06] because he thought it was his job every
[1:10:08] day at three o'clock to go up to the bar
[1:10:09] and sit there and drink a coke
[1:10:12] and witness to people he was a young man
[1:10:15] unmarried there's no way that ended well
[1:10:19] i don't say that to be harsh but there's
[1:10:20] just no way
[1:10:22] because some you have compassion but you
[1:10:25] don't go to the bar
[1:10:27] some have compassion making a difference
[1:10:29] but but others save with fear if you've
[1:10:31] got a problem with that don't
[1:10:34] don't hang out around it
[1:10:37] pull them out of the fire demand
[1:10:39] something of them
[1:10:42] make them show some fruits of repentance
[1:10:45] many people come to
[1:10:46] to john and there at the river and
[1:10:48] wanted to be baptized and he just
[1:10:49] baptized him but here comes some
[1:10:50] pharisees he said hey
[1:10:51] bring me some fruits
[1:10:58] brother branham says in adoption he says
[1:11:00] what does it do
[1:11:02] he said he abounds the sunlight upon his
[1:11:04] children walking in the spirit led of
[1:11:05] the spirit of god
[1:11:06] abounding in his grace with all prudence
[1:11:09] and wisdom
[1:11:10] understanding he says and shrewdness to
[1:11:13] know how to walk
[1:11:15] god give us that tonight he said you see
[1:11:18] it's
[1:11:18] it's wrong he said if you see us wrong
[1:11:21] then be careful what you do
[1:11:25] that includes going around telling
[1:11:27] everybody about it
[1:11:29] be careful what you do
[1:11:32] how you if it's wrong be careful even
[1:11:35] how you approach it
[1:11:38] be careful you'll be caught in the same
[1:11:39] thing
[1:11:42] prudent be real close real sure that you
[1:11:45] know how to approach it
[1:11:47] he said like the indian that looks 10
[1:11:49] times and walks takes one step
[1:11:52] he wants to make sure he knows where
[1:11:54] he's at what ground he stands on he said
[1:11:55] if it's wrong be careful even how you
[1:11:57] approach it
[1:11:58] prudent be real close real sure that you
[1:12:01] know how to approach it
[1:12:03] if you don't know leave it up to
[1:12:05] somebody who does
[1:12:07] wise as a serpent harmless as a dove
[1:12:10] that's what jesus said
[1:12:13] paul sums it up better than i could in
[1:12:16] ephesians 5. let's just go there i want
[1:12:18] to read the first 17 verses and i won't
[1:12:20] comment much we'll we'll
[1:12:22] get done with this
[1:12:29] ephesians 5 and 1 be therefore followers
[1:12:31] of god as dear children
[1:12:34] that's harmless be harmless as does be
[1:12:37] children
[1:12:39] walk in love that's where we have to
[1:12:42] walk
[1:12:43] whether we're hurt or not we have to
[1:12:45] walk in love
[1:12:47] it's hard we have to walk in love
[1:12:51] as christ also hath loved us remember
[1:12:54] that we were loved
[1:12:56] so we walk in love have given himself
[1:12:59] for us an offering and a sacrifice to
[1:13:01] god
[1:13:02] for a sweet smelling savor
[1:13:05] he says but fornication and all
[1:13:07] uncleanness or covetousness
[1:13:10] let it not be once named among you
[1:13:14] if i could i would do it by pleading i
[1:13:16] would do it by begging if i could i'd do
[1:13:18] it by
[1:13:19] by scolding and by warning that it would
[1:13:22] not be named once among us
[1:13:27] let it not be once once named among you
[1:13:29] as become a saints
[1:13:32] neither filthiness nor foolish talking
[1:13:35] or jesting and
[1:13:36] i've always had a little problem with
[1:13:37] this because i like to joke but that's
[1:13:39] not what
[1:13:40] paul's talking about if you go look at
[1:13:41] that it's not just joking but it's your
[1:13:43] subject matter
[1:13:45] dirty jokes no foolish talking that's
[1:13:49] gossip talking about things you don't
[1:13:51] know about
[1:13:53] foolish talking no jesting dirty jokes
[1:13:56] filthiness
[1:13:57] which are not convenient but rather
[1:13:58] giving of things
[1:14:00] that that word gesting is actually a
[1:14:02] double entendre it's something that
[1:14:04] maybe is innocent in itself but it
[1:14:06] sounds bad you know in a lot of these
[1:14:08] comedies these
[1:14:09] these uh romantic comedies today these
[1:14:11] pg-13 comedies have
[1:14:13] are full of that paul says don't do that
[1:14:16] he said but rather giving of thanks for
[1:14:18] this you know that no whoremonger
[1:14:21] nor unclean person nor covetous man who
[1:14:23] is an idolater
[1:14:24] have any inheritance in the kingdom of
[1:14:27] christ and of god
[1:14:29] now there will be people who were that
[1:14:32] but they have to change
[1:14:36] he said let no man deceive you with vain
[1:14:38] words because they can tell you it's
[1:14:40] okay it's not okay
[1:14:42] and the world can tell you they can
[1:14:43] preach in hollywood and they can preach
[1:14:45] in the movie he said it's all right
[1:14:47] but it's never all right
[1:14:50] if it was ever wrong it's still wrong
[1:14:54] that no man deceives you with vain words
[1:14:56] for because of these things cometh the
[1:14:58] wrath of god
[1:14:59] upon the children of disobedience
[1:15:02] he said be nazi therefore partakers with
[1:15:05] them
[1:15:07] you were sometimes darkness you were
[1:15:09] like that
[1:15:10] but now are you light in the lord walk
[1:15:13] as children of light
[1:15:14] there is a responsibility and i
[1:15:16] recognize the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:18] cleanses us from all sin that's the only
[1:15:20] thing we have to stand on is not on our
[1:15:21] merits but we have to walk as children
[1:15:24] of light if you take out the part that
[1:15:27] tells you how to live
[1:15:28] you take out most of the new testament
[1:15:31] even though the new covenant is the
[1:15:32] blood covenant
[1:15:34] the covenant of justification but he
[1:15:36] tells us how to walk as children of
[1:15:38] light
[1:15:40] verse nine for the fruit of the spirit
[1:15:41] is in all goodness
[1:15:43] and righteousness and truth that's what
[1:15:44] i want in my life isn't that what you
[1:15:46] want
[1:15:47] proving what is acceptable proving how
[1:15:50] by your life what is acceptable unto the
[1:15:53] lord
[1:15:55] and have no fellowship with the
[1:15:57] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:15:59] reprove them
[1:16:03] it ought to be that they wouldn't be
[1:16:04] comfortable
[1:16:08] it ought to be that way and if you've
[1:16:11] repented and you've been forgiven
[1:16:12] you should be comfortable knowing that
[1:16:14] god forgive you
[1:16:15] but if you're a sinner and you continue
[1:16:17] in sin you ought to be so uncomfortable
[1:16:19] in the house of god you can't sit there
[1:16:22] you ought to be so uncomfortable in my
[1:16:23] home you couldn't sit there
[1:16:25] or in your home because it's a place
[1:16:27] that's been dedicated to god
[1:16:31] and i've had people and i've got i know
[1:16:33] people who are uncomfortable even coming
[1:16:34] in my house
[1:16:36] but because they know how we live
[1:16:39] and they know when church time comes
[1:16:41] we're going to go to church and and
[1:16:42] there's certain things that we're going
[1:16:43] to do and
[1:16:44] and so they know that and they're just
[1:16:45] uncomfortable don't feel bad about that
[1:16:47] if you've got maybe family members that
[1:16:48] are like that but
[1:16:49] there's a place remember if they ever
[1:16:51] want god there's a place they can come
[1:16:53] back to
[1:16:54] where god is it's been consecrated to
[1:16:58] god
[1:16:58] let's keep our homes that way let's keep
[1:17:00] this church that way
[1:17:02] he says for it is a shame even to speak
[1:17:04] of those things which are done of them
[1:17:05] in secret
[1:17:06] if it's a shame to speak of it why why
[1:17:08] do we gossip about it
[1:17:11] you forgive me i'm not preaching just at
[1:17:14] you
[1:17:17] if i ever had a with a razor's edge from
[1:17:19] getting in the flesh it's tonight but i
[1:17:21] apologize
[1:17:22] to you i not for what i've preached i
[1:17:24] believe it's the word but
[1:17:25] i want my attitude to be right
[1:17:29] and that's all i can do i'm human i want
[1:17:32] my attitude to be right
[1:17:35] and whatever everybody else does they
[1:17:37] can do but it's not right
[1:17:40] it's not right to talk about those
[1:17:41] things that are done of them in secret
[1:17:43] but all things that are reproved are
[1:17:44] made manifest by the light
[1:17:46] that's the word for whatsoever doth make
[1:17:48] manifest his light wherefore he saith
[1:17:50] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:17:52] the dead and christ
[1:17:53] shall give thee light see then that you
[1:17:56] walk circumspectly that's somebody who
[1:17:58] walks and knows where he's going
[1:18:01] and knows how he walks be careful how
[1:18:03] you walk
[1:18:05] because it matters
[1:18:08] it matters to people it matters to
[1:18:10] families not as fools but as wise
[1:18:15] wise be cautious know what you're
[1:18:18] getting into
[1:18:20] redeeming the time because the days are
[1:18:23] evil
[1:18:25] wherefore being not unwise but
[1:18:27] understanding
[1:18:29] what the will of the lord is that's what
[1:18:32] i want i want to know what his will is
[1:18:34] i trust that you do as well you see when
[1:18:37] you when you live in sin you
[1:18:38] the will of god is obscured you think
[1:18:40] god blesses you in that sin he does not
[1:18:42] bless you
[1:18:45] it's you walk as a fool
[1:18:48] he may let you continue you may have
[1:18:50] more worldly things but you
[1:18:52] you're walking like a fool because the
[1:18:55] days are evil
[1:18:56] don't be unwise understand what the will
[1:18:58] of the lord is
[1:19:02] i read in 2019 in political magazine
[1:19:08] a strange headline that said i went back
[1:19:11] and copied the headline said israel
[1:19:12] accused of planting mysterious spy
[1:19:14] devices
[1:19:16] near the white house
[1:19:20] and my first thought was we're their
[1:19:22] biggest ally
[1:19:24] why are they spying on us
[1:19:28] because locks keep honest people honest
[1:19:34] and see the jews know something and i
[1:19:35] watched today they
[1:19:37] they went to germany today and and did a
[1:19:39] flyover of the
[1:19:40] of the concentration camp one of the
[1:19:42] concentration camps there and
[1:19:44] with the german air force who was once
[1:19:45] their enemy they did a flyover and they
[1:19:48] got up and they
[1:19:49] they told all these great words about
[1:19:51] how they're going to work together and
[1:19:53] cooperate
[1:19:54] but you can guarantee there's israeli
[1:19:56] spies in germany
[1:20:01] why because they've been through enough
[1:20:04] and i remember reading that when
[1:20:06] auschwitz was liberated
[1:20:08] before they were liberated that there
[1:20:10] become a cry among the survivors who
[1:20:12] knew
[1:20:12] that the end was coming and the cry was
[1:20:15] this
[1:20:16] never again
[1:20:20] at some point if we've been through
[1:20:21] something in our lives and i know
[1:20:23] something many of you have
[1:20:24] and this church has that i have but
[1:20:26] you've been through something in your
[1:20:27] family whatever that it is
[1:20:30] and you realize you don't want to do
[1:20:32] that yourself you you don't want to
[1:20:34] you don't want that to happen in your
[1:20:35] church again you and so what what they
[1:20:37] did is they
[1:20:38] they built themselves a nation and an
[1:20:40] army and even got nuclear weapons and
[1:20:42] put spies all over the world why
[1:20:43] because never again they said we won't
[1:20:46] be slaughtered unsuspecting
[1:20:50] if we're killed we'll be killed in war
[1:20:54] fighting the enemy
[1:20:57] the truth is we can never be wolves
[1:21:02] we'll never be that good at it we'll
[1:21:05] never be snakes
[1:21:08] we're sheep does
[1:21:12] sheep who have a dove nature within us
[1:21:14] but we can be wise
[1:21:16] and harmless at the same time
[1:21:19] with a will and this is my desired
[1:21:22] church if i haven't heard anything else
[1:21:23] that i've said tonight and i know
[1:21:25] it's just a few of us but we we need so
[1:21:27] much
[1:21:28] to know god and to know what he wants us
[1:21:30] to do
[1:21:32] i need his leadership in in my life
[1:21:34] right now and you need his leadership as
[1:21:35] well
[1:21:36] that you can be wise and harmless at the
[1:21:39] same time
[1:21:40] and and i have this this desire in me i
[1:21:42] want to keep open the doors of mercy
[1:21:46] so much so that if i have to stand there
[1:21:49] in that door
[1:21:52] and and keep it from closing if i could
[1:21:54] i would
[1:21:56] and noah was like that if he could stand
[1:21:58] there in the door but god shut the door
[1:22:03] we want mercy
[1:22:07] but the same time we've got to protect
[1:22:09] our homes we've got to lock the doors
[1:22:14] never again we need to put up
[1:22:18] with what we've been through what satan
[1:22:20] has if satan has deceived you or
[1:22:22] or caused trouble maybe it wasn't you
[1:22:23] but caused you trouble like that
[1:22:26] you don't have to happen again be wise
[1:22:27] as a serpent
[1:22:30] harmless is a dove but you know what
[1:22:33] i'm going to a place with no wolves
[1:22:39] i got thinking about this brother david
[1:22:40] today and i spent i spent the last eight
[1:22:43] hours back here in my office
[1:22:45] and just sitting there and and thinking
[1:22:48] about these things and
[1:22:50] i thought you know we're going to a
[1:22:53] place
[1:22:54] where everyone we meet is genuine
[1:22:58] and there'll be no tears we can take
[1:23:00] everything at face value
[1:23:04] but until we get there we we've got to
[1:23:06] lock some doors
[1:23:10] make sure that if it's just three of us
[1:23:13] if it's just five of just 10 of us
[1:23:14] whatever it is
[1:23:15] we want to make sure we're doing what
[1:23:16] god wants us to do
[1:23:18] because number one we want to make it
[1:23:20] there and we want to bring as many as we
[1:23:22] can with us but
[1:23:23] but you you can't make somebody the holy
[1:23:26] spirit will never force someone to be
[1:23:28] right
[1:23:29] you want them to be right but you've got
[1:23:31] to lock the doors
[1:23:35] i'm glad that that place
[1:23:38] will be a place with the woods because
[1:23:40] i'm tired
[1:23:42] of trying to act like a serpent
[1:23:45] don't come naturally and it shouldn't
[1:23:49] doesn't come naturally to keep your
[1:23:51] guard up
[1:23:53] and it shouldn't but we have to do it
[1:23:57] be wise as serpents harmless this does
[1:24:00] you bow your heads with me musicians
[1:24:02] come
[1:24:04] i know it was an odd service but you
[1:24:06] just
[1:24:07] pray for me and pray with me maybe if
[1:24:10] you watch this later those of you that
[1:24:11] aren't here tonight i
[1:24:14] i'd say that we need to get the message
[1:24:16] i know it wasn't delivered maybe in the
[1:24:18] best way but
[1:24:20] we need to hear this we need to know
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:24] there is a way that we have to act
[1:24:28] brother branham you go listen to the end
[1:24:30] of when brother branham is preaching
[1:24:33] about a life worthy of the gospel go
[1:24:35] listen to the end of that brother
[1:24:36] brahman talks about how we should live
[1:24:37] in such a way
[1:24:38] that someone who didn't even agree with
[1:24:40] us or anything else could say there's a
[1:24:41] christian
[1:24:43] there's a christian or let me live like
[1:24:45] that
[1:24:47] let me live like that
[1:24:50] in church we need a revival
[1:24:53] in our own hearts we need god to move
[1:24:57] and i don't want to affect you by my
[1:24:58] emotion tonight but i want you to know
[1:25:01] we need god to move but you know what he
[1:25:03] promised he would move when it gets the
[1:25:04] darkest
[1:25:05] and it's the hardest he said that's the
[1:25:08] hour and i found
[1:25:10] in my own ministry limited as as it has
[1:25:12] been up to this point but in the last
[1:25:13] few years when it's the hardest
[1:25:15] that's when god moves
[1:25:18] and i believe he's moving tonight i
[1:25:20] believe he's still here with us and
[1:25:21] he's still going to keep moving he's
[1:25:23] moving for your families he's
[1:25:24] he's working in your families but would
[1:25:26] you just would you just let him in
[1:25:28] and lock the doors to every with
[1:25:30] everything else tonight
[1:25:32] i'm going to make sure that my what i do
[1:25:35] and
[1:25:35] the way i act around people and when i'm
[1:25:38] around the world
[1:25:39] i want to make sure my doors are locked
[1:25:41] i don't want to be deceived
[1:25:44] i don't want to be right and i want
[1:25:45] others to be right i don't want to be
[1:25:47] cynical
[1:25:48] i don't want to be in a place where
[1:25:51] nobody could do anything right in my
[1:25:52] eyes and end up by myself without a
[1:25:54] church to go to because nobody can
[1:25:56] preach and nobody can
[1:25:57] anything i don't want to live like that
[1:26:00] somewhere god's got a preacher
[1:26:03] who can live the truth live what he
[1:26:07] preaches sometimes god's got a young man
[1:26:09] an old man
[1:26:10] somewhere god's got a young woman an old
[1:26:12] woman a married couple
[1:26:14] that can preach the truth or live the
[1:26:16] truth preach it with their lives
[1:26:19] i want that to be me i want that to be

[1:26:42] lord jesus i don't want to be cynical
[1:26:45] i want to be honest lord we live in an
[1:26:48] age of production when everything's
[1:26:50] produced for a video everything's
