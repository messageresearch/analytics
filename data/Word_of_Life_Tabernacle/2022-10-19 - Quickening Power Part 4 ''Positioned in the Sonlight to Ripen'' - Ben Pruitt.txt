Lord give them a special blessing for coming Lord tonight and and help them oh God lord to see your word Lord to get a revelation of it myself as well Lord move me out of the way and may you speak directly to your people we pray in Jesus name amen and God bless you tonight let's turn to Romans 8 11. I'll just read that one scripture and then you can have your seeds I got several other scriptures that we'll read as we go along tonight it's good to be here tonight on a Wednesday night and see this nice crowd brother Phil sister Corrine good to have you here tonight it's always good to see you guys and I know they probably had quite a time putting all that stuff back in the church didn't they back home so it's good to have you tonight we really enjoyed the meetings in fact tonight as you're turning to Romans 8 11 I'm going to begin with the scripture and and quote the same one brother Wayne Lawson preached from last Friday night at the tent meetings if you haven't heard that sermon I recommend that you go and listen to it I had already had this planned for the Wednesday we we let go so the Lord knows what he's doing doesn't he he really does and so we're grateful to to be a part of the body of Christ all around the world and we believe the same holy spirit is preaching in the preachers wherever they're at amen Romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead also quickened your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this evening after his introduction and it is the rising of the Sun as we've been going through that sermon and I recommend that you listen to it if you haven't done that already uh brother Branham goes to Leviticus and begins to show a type in the Old Testament and he shows that the Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament it's a type of the New Testament in Leviticus 23 and 10 Moses says speak or God speaking to Moses speaking to the children of Israel and saying to them when you become into the land which I give unto you and brother Branham stops there and he says unto the place the position that I have given unto you unto the place the position that I have given unto you he said now you speak to the children of Israel that when you get to this certain place that I promised you I'd take you when you get there in this land now you might say well brother Ben where is that land is that land in in Indiana is that land in in Missouri it's hot land in Arkansas it's that land in Hardy it's that land in Louisiana no that land is in Christ and he's our spiritual land it's a spiritual land that we're talking about today so when you get to that land he said now speaking natural here typing the spiritual now we realize that this message that we have is a Deliverance message how many know that tonight it's a message of Deliverance of calling out a message of Exodus to come out from her my people and be not partaker of her plagues and I'm so glad that it is it brings us out of the world out of the church world out of denominationalism out of all of those things but we realize it is also a message of going in it's a message of placing it's a message of positioning and what I'm talking about tonight is not just positioning in a church but it's positioned in Christ because if you can ever get positioned in Christ you'll find yourself positioned in church body right but you you'll first got to find what your position is in Christ and so brother Branham dwells on that and I'm not going to get very much further and it is the rising of the sun tonight because I want us to dwell on this for a moment and see what this positioning message is and brother Branham taught us that Ephesians parallel Joshua how many know that in fact he preached a sermon I believe on that titled that Ephesians parallels Joshua Joshua placed Israel in the land he was the one who had the opportunity or was given the responsibility of taking the people and placing them giving them their land what belong to them not just corporately but individually that there was something that belonged to them and I would tell you tonight there's something that belongs to you and I as the Believers there's a very particular promise that we have that we can grab a hold of for our day and it's to us individually it's not just for the preacher it's not just for the Sunday school teacher not just for the deacons but for every one of us there's a promise given to us in the word of what we should be and how we should act and and what the blessing things that God's going to give us and those promises are found in the book of Ephesians and Ephesians 1 3 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now Branham taught that we were in Christ when he walked the Earth how many know that tonight I'm not going to bring all of these quotes tonight but just to remind you of things that you know and then we'll move to where we want to go but the word was made flesh and that means that you walked with him you suffered with him right you you died with him on the cross and he was buried with him and now you're risen with him right you can't have one without the other if you walked with him if you died with him then you're buried you buried with him then you're raised with him and that's what we're talking about the quickening power the same quickening power that he had at The Same Spirit brother Branham deals with that he said if that same spirit and that's the question if he dwells in you it will also Quicken your Immortal body so now he said you were buried with him you're risen with him you're the manifested attributes of God sitting in Heavenly places now how many believe that tonight that's nothing new for us is it we understand that we're already raised resurrected to New Life and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now when we are in Heavenly places where are we placed we are placed together I want you to watch this tonight Ephesians 2 and 4 says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us aren't you glad that he loves you tonight even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us notice hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you're saved and hath raised us up together now he's quickened us together with Christ but he's raised us all of us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are seated together no not just not out anywhere brother Brandon says but in Heavenly places we are assembled in Heavenly it means the position of the believer he said that if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up he said or the church is prayed up he's now this is the land that we have today this is the rights that we have as a church if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up the church is prayed up and we're ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places now he said we are heavenlies in our souls now you may not feel very Heavenly tonight you might have ate too much for dinner or not enough you might not feel very Heavenly you might have had some problems during your day you the boss and the boss didn't agree maybe the boss is you and you couldn't agree with yourself but you couldn't get along with yourself and then sometimes that's the case isn't it maybe you don't feel very Heavenly but we're not talking about the flesh but we're talking about the inner man when you're called when you're elected when you're prayed up what are you doing you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ yes yes oh aren't you glad to have that position you have that position whether you're struggling with the kids whether you're worried about work or finances no matter what's going on in your life that position is yours but you've got to claim it right you've got to walk on it you've got to you've got to be there and so that's what that's what you want to do now he said it's called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessing heavenlies in our souls our Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere he said oh brother there you are a Heavenly atmosphere he said oh what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here see it sitting here Church where are we at the Word of Life Tabernacle sitting in a building but where we seated in Heavenly places if you're the called the elected I believe that you are tonight I believe that's why you're here on a Wednesday night he said then when you're sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit is moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins under the blood someone say all sin all sins under the blood in perfect worship perfect worship now it may not feel like perfect worship all the time the song leader may come out and sing the song Twice and sometimes brother Joel We may come out and sing off key or or seeing the wrong thing or it may not feel like perfect worship but that's not what he's talking about when you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ if you make a Joyful Noise come on church are you with me tonight being hard on David tonight but he would point it out on me too if I did that but you know what you know what happens is we're seated in Heavenly places and so our work our worship is perfect yeah right and that ought to take all the stress off of it and all the performance off of it it's not a performance it's perfect worship when when a a woman who's lost everything and can still bow at the feet of Jesus and say Lord I worship you not because of what I have because I don't have anything but because of who you are not because of what I'm well with all my blessings but in spite of everything that's going on I'm still worshiping worshiping you that's perfect worship perfect work so don't don't you want to worship that way hey man he said worshiping together and he said all sins under the blood worshiping with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in the Heavenly places he said did you ever sat in one oh I have set till I would Weep For Joy and say God never let me leave here just Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's what church ought to be like not just church but that's what our worship at home ought to be like Lord don't let it ever let me leave your presence and seated together in Heavenly places he said brother man why then or some Churches dead and cold even those some who have the word that we believe and believe the same thing why are some Churches dead and cold it's because they don't realize that they're in Heavenly places they never come into that atmosphere because the promises are never preached they don't know who they are or what they own but I'm so glad tonight we know who we are and we know what we have and so we can sit together and worship God in spirit and a truth not because of what happens to us not because of what's going on on the outside but it's perfect worship because we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ and we recognize that oh it's so important to recognize that our souls are lifted up together by the word now brother random says after the church takes its position I'm going somewhere tonight so just hang with me he said we're called to the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit and when each man takes his position what God has called him to do and stand to the end of the road going after the Lost Now watch how he ties that in there now he's talking about Abraham and lot there's a lot of people who say they're Abraham and say well I'm separated from all unbelief I'm Abraham but when lot Falls when lot goes gets taken captive do you have a heart to go after it because if not you're not fitting that type right in order to fit the type of Abraham of being separated from all unbelief you also have to fit the type of the Brother who goes after his brother who goes out and Homa goes out and gets his brother amen now brother Branham says that first and is continue with this quote now he said first Paul takes all the scare out of it all the scare out of it so now if you're called if you're not just worked up in your mind but some kind of theology if you're really born of the spirit then God predestinated you before the foundation of the world puts your name on the Lamb's Book of Life praise God he said and now we come together to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus holy people a holy nation A peculiar people a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices unto God he said that is the fruit of our lips giving praises to his name people come in and say them people are crazy sure they are the wisdom of God is foolish to man and the wisdom of man is foolish to God they're contrary one to the other he said but a real Spirit-filled church full of power of God sitting together in Heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices Praises of God now watch we've kind of taken the idea that a Spirit-filled church that knew their position and another place could kind of set back and wouldn't be a church that would necessarily be Pentecostal in its worship but that's not what he's telling us that this church that reaches its position would actually when they were sitting together in Heavenly places they would actually offer spiritual sacrifices why it's Kings and Priests they know who they are yes amen if you don't know who you are you'll be waiting on somebody else to offer your sacrifice yes right many people are waiting on a preacher to offer a sacrifice of praise they're waiting on him on an evangelist to offer a sacrifice they're waiting on some person but that's not who you are you're a king you're a priest it's your job to go in and offer the sacrifice the fruit of your lips offering him praise he don't want to just hear my praise he don't want to just hear my voice he wants to hear yours are you with me tonight the Holy Spirit he said moving among them Discerning sin so that's part of it too calling out the things that's among them that's wrong so straightened out and making it flat and level he said because why always in the presence of God is that Bloody sacrifice so he brings it right back around we could not be in our position only in Christ now let's watch this again Leviticus 23 10 speaking of the children of Israel I'm saying to them when you be coming to the land which I give unto you now watch and shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest but the brown said and shall reap the harvesterof he said you have received what I told you thereof oh I love this what did he tell them he said it's a land flowing with milk and honey it's vivid language isn't it in other words it's a land that's got food in it it's got lots of food plenty of food that you're going to be able to eat of that food and gonna be full and so when they come into the land he said I want you to take the first fruits the very first seeds were planted in the land the very first crop that comes up he said I want you to take that and make it a wave Sheaf he said because he said you're going to reap the Harvest of the land when you come into the land it's going to be Harvest time you're going to reap the Harvest of the land and the very first ones that come up that come to full maturity he said I want you to take that and wave it before the Lord now he said when you come in that means you've received what I told you so God said it's a good land he said there's a crop there he said there'll be something to eat right they get over there they find there's something to eat there's crops in the fields they come in at Harvest Time crossed over when they get to the place where he told them to go glory to God when you recognize who you are you're a son or daughter of God see that's not the end of it right just recognizing it's not an end in itself right but there's something that we have to do when we get there what are we going to do we're going to manifest the word we're going to see and we're going to reap the Harvest of the land so the word that was spoken to them now they see the manifestation of that word Joshua 5 and 11 tells us that when they come into the land they did eat of the old corn of the Lamb that word old corn just means the uh the produce they did eat what the land produced of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the South same day and the man of cease on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year so they come in now they're seeing the fruit or the manifestation of what God told them don't miss this tonight Church I don't know whether I need to slow it down or speed it up but we don't need to miss this the manifestation of the promise comes to its maturity and right there is what the devil wants to steal away from you take away the increase take away the manifestation take away because you are a child of God you are a son or daughter of God but the devil's trying to take away that manifestation out of your life he's trying to get you to not believe it but if God kept his word and we see the fruit of the Lamb we might as well eat of it and and plant some more right right good so the manifestation of the promise comes to its maturity now hang with me for just a moment we're we're the bride how many know we're the Bride of Jesus Christ but the bride you know at one time was a child a baby there was a there was a bride who was a baby my wife was not always uh Mrs Benjamin Pruitt she was a baby she had to grow up before I could marry her most of the way anyway so don't laugh Gabe you had to grow up most of the way too so so now we come to a she comes to a maturity in order to begin to manifest what was always in her right oh God now brother Branham said that when Christ was born he talks about how there's three stars that went together and he calls that the Trinity of God in one person becoming one God three and three becoming one the three offices of God becoming one office he said when the little baby Christ was born three stars went together and made one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one so now he was not the fullness in the sense that he was not mature at that time and yet all that he ever would be he was Jehovah crying in the manger all that would ever heal the sick all that would ever speak the word he couldn't even talk yeah right if you'd have went up to Jesus at that time and said Jesus heal me Jesus saved me Jesus lay your hands on me he never healed any sick he cried he nursed from his mother right he grew up like anybody else did and so but there's a word that spoke about him but now he had not reached the maturity of that word now we come through that in the message of the hour that actually there's a word that spoke of a mature bride that was speaking to a bride that was not mature that had just been born but it was speaking of something in the future and I believe that's the time we're living in right now so brother Branham talks about that and he talks about how the on the news at that time there was five stars he said that we're in line with the Earth and he said what's five he said a number of Grace he said every time those stars come then something happens on Earth what taken place five stars fell in what was it an introducing of what and he talks about earthquakes and floods and things that have taken place during that time he said what's happened an infant Church he said Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begun to fall on her now now again she's still the bride but it's in infancy she's taking form a bride for this bridegroom he said what happened now he said it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach he said friends the church is coming forth God is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she is predestinated God said so he would have it he said that makes it right who is a member I don't know I'm trusting to be myself I'm trusting you're a member but he's going to have a body without spot a wrinkle he said as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is God and His word coming again I love this making himself manifested in a bride not will do like Eve did hybrid it to something else in other words she's not going to change it because she is the the bride for this perfect groom right but eve took it and took a part of the word but didn't take all of it it was hybrid you understanding what she produced was a cane and an Abel but this bride won't produce a cane she'll produce the full word of God so he said but the unadulterated word of God will be born into that church and she will stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word he said amen I believe it's the announcement now the announcement God was it was like he was sending out cards said it's a girl think about it's a girl and she's already in the mind of God the Bride of Jesus Christ but she's in her infancy now how is the Bride of that time in her infancy well she hadn't grown fully into the word because you'll find that what brother random was preaching and what they understood and what they could manifest was very far apart right but it's getting closer yeah yeah I hope you see this tonight it's not getting farther apart there are people who will tell you that the bride was at its best then and it's getting closer or farther and farther away but how could that be whoever the bride is I believe I'm one of them do you believe that tonight whoever the bride is it's not getting worse it's getting better it's growing up yeah oh my now watch he said that won't do like he did but she will stand like Jesus Christ did he said I believe it's the announcement now he said in the same son that rises in the East is the same son that sets from the West the same sun and the same Son of God that comes to the Earth to take a bride on the Eastern people that bride polluted herself like Eve did like Jehovah's bride did the same Sun that shines there listen that shine there with his same power upon Pentecost to ripen the seed that he had planted that same Sun is shining now in the Western Hemisphere oh God to what ripen the seed that has been planted to bring forth a bride oh God the evening light of the Gospel will bring forth the bride you say what what what kind of what kind of evening light Zechariah 14 7 in the evening time it'll be light a light that day it'll be neither day or night but in the evening time he said now when truth comes forth he said what's happened now watch how he takes this he says not to shuck but the life goes right out from the shut right into the grain the real true life I want you to watch because brother Branham is seeing something now if you go back to 1963 brother Brandon preaches the token and you'll find when he preaches in 1965 it is the rising of the son he's preaching the same thing now think about it for a minute he's preaching the same thing you need the mechanics or you have the mechanics but you need the Dynamics you need the spirit to anoint the word that you have in order to come to that maturity he saw they were not in that mature place they were not in that ripened condition yeah and so he said you need something and what did he think they needed even at that time they knew far more than what the Pentecostals do they had far more Revelation than what the Pentecostal Church of the Baptist Church and yet they didn't know I don't think what we do today because there's been so much light not new light but the same thing that brother Brandon preached has been priests and we see it now in a way maybe that they didn't thin but even then they weren't walking even in all that they knew and I'm not condemning that generation but some of you lived back then and you know it was very simple it was very Elementary and brother Brown was telling him he's seeing a need among those people that have become the message people today yeah right you're seeing a need among those people he's saying you need to mature yeah yeah you need to grow up oh my you need to ripen so now he says the life goes right out from the truck right into the grain the real true life he said the organization stands there and dies just like it is done in every age it does the same he said you come out of that 50 years ago and went right back into it again now what I'm doing tonight is I'm laying a groundwork for this teaching on the wave Chief because brother Brandon's going to talk about it there's got to be a bride there's got to be a bride who comes back as wave loaves had Bread on his table and who's going to do that I I pray it's my generation somebody's got to do it but we've been maturing from that time till now right to come back in that in that form now watch he said the organization stands there and dies he said come out 50 years ago went right back into it again but real life follows the grain we're at the end time Brethren he says what did it pull away for so that it would bring the Grain in the presence of the Sun oh my see when they're shut on the corn it can't ripen to its fullest extent yeah yeah it can't come to its full maturity so what has to happen is the shot gets dry and it gets so dry it begins to crack and pull away and when it gets so dry and begins to crack and pull away the sun can reach the grain yeah yeah and once this oh my when everything's green the sun is protected from the Sun but now that it's now that everything's dry it the sun can finally reach the grain to bring it to its full maturity he said what did it pull away for so that it would bring the Grain in the presence of the sun to ripen the grain to a golden ripen for the master why has it pulled away now watch you think back some of you have been around for a while I've been around for a while but not nearly as long as some of you some of you have seen a lot happen you've seen the older generation come and go and maybe you are the older generation but many that you walk with don't walk no more with the word many fell off many fell away many if you come out of Pentecost perhaps there'll be a few here that would have most of us come right out of the message or out of the world but if you come out of Pentecost you you come out through that and you saw they didn't see what you saw right and so they they pulled back they pulled away they can't take the heat of it and that's why they say well it's a cult it's some kind of a and they try to point to everything that's going on but really it's just a shut pulling away right they can't reach the place that you've reached it wasn't meant for them big brother Brown said they were a good Chuck but it wasn't meant for them to reach that place of maturity it was meant for us amen he said so why is it pulled away he said so it causes heartaches tears the wheat never pulls away from the shuck are you hearing me the wheat the corn the grain never pulls away from the shuck or the husk it's the husk that pulls away right so if anybody's pulling away you got to watch that right because the wheat don't pull away the husk pulls away he said so it causes heartaches tears that they don't lay before the sun he said they don't lay before they s-u-n but the s-o-n to be ripened to the Full Gospel now watch to manifest everything that Jesus Christ promised in the Bible so watch brother branham's definition because this is one of those things that we've talked about before I think we misunderstood what does it mean to be ripe and I say we maybe some of you understood it perfectly but I'll say me I could preach a whole series of sermon things I've misunderstood maybe we all could yeah what does it mean to be ripe because a lot of people took that to mean well all the greenness or the Pentecostalism was baked out of us and so now we just sit in church with our arms folded bless God I'm ripe huh but look at brother Brown's definition and I'm going to read a couple of quotes here before I close in just a moment several to just show you what brother random's definition of ripening was he said it's to manifest if everything if you're writing it down write that down manifest everything that Jesus Christ promised in the Bible he said there's raising up a body today among the people and there will be no more organizations it goes right down into rich laodicea again he says that was in 1964 in December again he says I believe we have truth I'm satisfied of that and again brother random is watching this church in 1963 begins to preach the token he begins to preach in the rising of the sun it begins to reaches your life worthy of the Gospel it begins to preach sermons like that because he's trying to pull these message people yeah yeah right he's not just preaching to denominational people anymore but he's preaching to people who say they believe in a prophet they believe a message and he's saying you you need to ripen you need to come up higher now watch what he's saying he said I believe we have truth I'm satisfied of that I believe the wheat is absolutely the shark is pulling away from it you know he said but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen and that's what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the sun now watch his definition again till our little group of people here till it becomes so right to Christ it becomes Bread on his table oh it's so beautiful it comes red oh Lord I want to be bred on your table yes now again people are saying well if we're laying in the presence of the sun it just means we'll be dead well that's not what it means at all the only life there is is in the grain right that everything else is dead the only life that's left is in the grain what what what's happening is actually that if you lay in the presence of the Sun and you're dead completely it means you died before you had a mature crop you didn't come fully into the manifestation of what the seed ought to be now the seed doesn't look if the seed doesn't look like what went into the ground it's not a met fully manifested seed it's got to manifest itself and be proved by being waived over the people now watch the Pentecost will only but remember said Pentecost will only shelter the message give it an open door until it gets scattered he said and then the shuck will pull away and the wheat will lay in the presence of the sun see to ripen he said there won't be any denomination just remember there's never been a Revival but about three years after the Revival started they started a denomination on it and this last great miracle move of God in this last days he said this went 20 years it's a million miles from a denomination going further away all the time huh now watch he's talking about somebody getting better not getting worse farther away from denomination not going into it that bride has to be on the Earth it's got to be why don't we want to strive to be that right right so we're not preaching Doom and Gloom and saying well you know we're just surprised it's just hanging on by the skin of our teeth somebody is growing up somebody's becoming the weed again amen he said a million miles from a denomination going further all the way all the time the Shucks pulling away no cooperation nothing with it again the shuck is the one with no cooperation always it pulls away from it there can't be no more it's a wheat now but we're plenty green look he's looking out the people he's preaching to we're plenty green yeah I think that's why there was so many splits so much division we were plenty green it's time to be mature yeah we were plenty green so we misunderstood a lot but we've been given a whole message that we can look at now we can see every we can see it we can search it we can preach it we can know what he said it's time to be mature foreign fighting anymore it's time to be my church time to raise Godly families it's time to have Christ in our homes it's time to have Christ in the church it's time to give him the preeminence amen he said we're plenty green he said we have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up now here here's his definition of it he said that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness oh God now remember before brother Branham could reach a maturity in his own life remember what the angel told him you must be more sincere what about us Church yes I know sometimes I push and I push and I but it and I don't mean to push you over I want you to know who you are you're children of God I I can't make you not a Christian I can't do that but I want to see a maturity I want to see it in my own life I want to see in my own family I want to see a maturity I want to see a sacredness yes I want to see a worship right I want to see something a life and also a worship not not the shouting without the ability to live but but having both and and the ability to worship but also the ability to live a sincerity of sacredness he said the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God this is how brother random defined ripeness to know that the spirit of the Living God moving in his word and showing us the things yet again that was in 1965 and trying to do God of service without it being God's will brother random doesn't talk about this before 1964. by the way he said again he said think how long this has been going on 20 something years and no organization why it's the seed coming forming under the husk like this he said laying out he said now it's got to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen into the Glorious grain glorious crane I love that like the one again this is Brother Brandon's definition of ripeness to come like the one that went down yeah like the one that went into the first the real church that went down first is coming right back up through the stalk to come out another church when the combine comes to pick it up yeah he didn't say it come out a bunch of people pulled off to themselves and sitting and listened to a tape that's not what he said he said come out another church I can only say what the Bible says what the prophet said he said when the combine comes to pick it up he said the life that went down in Luther are you still with me tonight I hope I'm not boring you but this is what we want we want the truth we want the life we want the sincerity we want the sacredness we want something that'll change us something that will change our families something that'll that'll change our homes something that's real not just something we say we have but something we possess amen he says the life that went down and Luther the life that went down in meth in Methodist the life that went down in the Pentecostal will come into the grain he said it'll all go right into the Grain and go out forming the perfect body of Jesus Christ oh my again I'm just reading because I'm trying to stay with my notes so I can finish on time tonight I'm almost done he said the thing that's the matter with the message today yeah now look the prophet can see right he's looking at the people and he said the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened he said you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured Christians he said see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe again he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message yeah and beginning to understand begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened now watch is definition of right our faith isn't right yeah oh my our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message oh God that God has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence again you want to hear Brother Brown's definition of a ripe church till it tenders up oh God oh God don't let me have a hard heart don't let me have a hard Spirit don't let me become a thorn in the desert Let Me Tender up that's a prophet's definition of being ripened is not to become harder not to become drier but to get tendered up yeah [Applause] get tendered up oh God they get tendered up he said he said we're he said we're going to lay in the presence of the sun until it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down oh my God oh my he said sometimes I love this now you remember the way it was some of you remember when you first come in I remember when I first started preaching well you saw something that happened you know some little thing in the church some little dress code violation or something boy you hammered it huh because you wanted to be like a prophet but watch what brother Brandon says sometimes in speaking the message you get harsh have to break it in like that now there's times we still have to do that you understand because everybody's in their own Journey but watch how the tenor of it changes as a whole look he said you have to break it in like that because you've got to clench a nail to make it hold but when the church once gets it yeah Glory he said the elected is called out and separated I've been in the presence of God he said I know it'll be something now here's brother branham's definition of ripeness again of ripening under the sun he said I know it'll be something when it gets it he said I know it'll be something like the people was there when it takes the Rapture Now where's he talking about he's talking about those he saw beyond the curtain of time he said only perfect love could enter there yes oh God it'll be something like the people was there when it takes its rapture and he said all that was there was perfect love all the virtues all the spiritual gifts now watch they were all there in the message of the hour but they had to come to maturity all of the Seven Virtues all the nine spiritual gifts all the fruits of the spirit everything that was promised all the promises of God they were laying in the message of the hour they were laying in the scriptures the light Shone on them by the message of the hour are you hearing me tonight but they had to come to maturity and each and every one of us has got to reach that place of maturity and somehow God speeds up the process in this end time so that we can reach it because we're very close to the end and then we go home it's got to serve Us full purpose because they without us cannot be made perfect so there's got to be a bride at the end time that comes to that full maturity oh God and it doesn't mean again it doesn't mean a Perfection because we're already Perfect by the blood we never did it in the first place we they were perfect then brother random spoke to them and said you are The Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ but it was an infant but now she's I believe we've grown up we need to grow up if we haven't grown up we need to grow up but what's the purpose of it now watch I'm closing with this musicians go ahead and come right on 45 minutes praise God I think I had that set on 45 minutes what's going to happen 23-11. he says here you when you come in he said there'll be a harvest you come into the place come into the position there's going to be a harvest there's going to be fruit there it's going to be wheat there he said I want you to cut it down I want you to harvest it I want you to take advantage of it I want you to listen to it and he said he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now brother Branham taught us that that happened and I'll just get barely into this and then we'll we'll close but brother Branham taught us that that happened with Christ when he raised from the dead how many believe that he said it happened again on the day of Pentecost which Pentecost actually would be the way of loath but brother Brown said that sheep was waived again and he said in the Holy Spirit he said and It produced a a mature Church right he said he'd come to its maturity so now it happened he said then he said but it has to happen again through the revealing of the son of man and it happened oh God hope we recognize you say brother Ben I won't ever come to this maturity don't say that because the crop has already been accepted oh god well he said it would be accepted for you Christ was accepted for you and in this day not a man right not a man but Christ in working in a Ministry working in the message of the hour Christ working in William Branham if we could say it that way but it was not the man it was the message but the brother said the message was the wave chief and the message oh God was accepted for you now when we used to run crops we used to go and run combines across the field and uh sorry I'm making you stand up there with Alan but I got to tell this we were we we used to haul our produce our grain to the market in an old 1970s for or 1980s Ford truck in the bed of a truck we'd line it with feed sacks that's how poor we were as Farmers we didn't have all these fancy trucks we just used the pickup truck and I remember we'd haul it up there and Grandpa's crops always had a problem he had he was lit he farmed in the wetlands and it was always the problem that they had moisture in them and so he was always going up there and what they would do is they would take a sample now they didn't test every grain in the truck but when Grandpa went up to the to the feed place where he sold the the seed the grain he would go up to the Silo and they would they would take a sample of it and they would take it in and test it for moisture and then he would be docked from the price however moist the grain was if it wasn't ready so he tried to wait until the perfect time to take it up so the sample could be accepted for the entire truck oh God you and I live in a day when the sample has already been accepted and it come to a full maturity I hope you hear me today it was not a man it was Christ revealing the son of man the revealing but it had to come to maturity in a body not to come to maturity so we could look at it and say oh that's wonderful but to come to maturity to tell us don't give up hope you will reach maturity if the first fruit of the crop reached maturity then the very last one that's planning will reach the same maturity well I hope you're hearing tonight he had to reach the maturity of a major prophet but you and I have to reach the maturity of whatever God's called us to do and we will and we will why because the wave sheath has been accepted yes he said how do you know God honored the message you've indicated it don't have to be Vindicated again Christ in this age the word has been accepted for you now it's time for the rest of the field to ripen become Bread on this table tender up become the loaves do you believe it tonight amen let's bow our heads together if you'd play something it's time to become red on the table that's when you don't the purpose of the of the sheath the purpose of the grain is not for itself but it's to be mixed up and a rising agent put in it and the ability and and pressed together and ground up oh God so that it becomes a loaf and then the loaf is on Christ's table oh my that's what I want to be it's not about me it's about becoming what God wants for me to be I want to be everything don't you in this hour of all hours and whatever that is I I don't want to push you into something that you're not but if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and I believe that you are today then you can become you can become the manifestation of whatever gifts God has put in your life you can become the manifestation of a spiritual gift you can become the manifestation of what a preacher ought to be what a deacon ought to be you can become the manifestation of Love of joy peace this is the age for that I think we ought to just ask God tonight Lord help me as an individual I want to be bred on your table tender me up Lord let me lay in the presence of your word until I become all that you want me to be Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you tonight we thank you for your word lord it's so good I'm always surprised Lord by when I begin to look and begin to see things that I've never seen though I've read it many many times but Lord every time I look I begin to see things that and even some things tonight Lord I'll look at it again and I'll think well there was more to that and I'm so grateful for that Lord lord it's just that that word that you've given us in our hour was a mature word it wasn't a Pentecostal word or a Methodist word or or a Baptist word but it was a mature word an open book we're so grateful for that Lord help us to manifest that Lord as you as John took the book from the Angel's hand and ate it oh God may we do that today and he said you must prophesy again to many people in Nations and tongues Lord may we recognize our position Lord and stand right there in the field and be ready to be bred on your table I pray you granted tonight I pray once again Lord if there's one that's sick or in need that you'd
