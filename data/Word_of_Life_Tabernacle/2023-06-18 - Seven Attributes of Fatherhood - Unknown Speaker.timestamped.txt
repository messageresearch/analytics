[49:28] I'll say that while he's not here so you
[49:30] don't get too
[49:31] too excited but the Joel just means a
[49:34] lot to me and um and so our our father
[49:37] passed away some years ago so I'm the
[49:41] um
[49:41] I'm not the oldest left in the family
[49:43] but maybe the one that sometimes the
[49:46] people they look to you know as a dad
[49:48] and I think well you know I couldn't
[49:50] fill that role but I thank the Lord for
[49:52] for what he's done in our lives and he
[49:55] gives us fathers that that we uh we
[49:58] didn't know we didn't know what to do
[50:00] without one but he gave us fathers to
[50:02] our lives he'll do that for us
[50:04] uh I wanted to say about sister Jewel I
[50:07] I knew her for some time and what a
[50:10] blessing she was in our lives and here
[50:12] recently she had been sending us little
[50:14] little uh coloring drawings that she had
[50:17] done she wanted to make sure she stayed
[50:18] in touch and she'd send us and that
[50:20] meant a lot to us that she had done that
[50:22] and I know she was a part of the church
[50:24] here for a while and we're just so
[50:26] grateful that she's gone on to meet her
[50:28] reward and no more suffering no more
[50:31] pain we're thankful for that and praying
[50:33] for the family as well
[50:35] amen John chapter 1 and verse 18.
[50:38] says no man has seen God at any time
[50:41] and I would say it like this this
[50:43] morning if you were looking for God as a
[50:45] Heavenly Father
[50:47] how would you you were looking for a
[50:49] father figure it says no man has seen
[50:52] God at any time
[50:54] how would you know what that Father
[50:56] Figure would be
[50:57] he said the only begotten son which is
[51:01] in the bosom of the father he hath
[51:04] declared him so we know what a father is
[51:07] because of the son amen God bless you
[51:10] can be seated
[51:13] I want to speak to you on seven
[51:15] attributes of fatherhood
[51:17] seven attributes
[51:19] of fatherhood
[51:21] there's some attributes of God that only
[51:23] a father reflects
[51:26] and there's certain parts of the life of
[51:29] a dad or father that are are a
[51:32] representation of God to his children
[51:36] and that God I remember when I was very
[51:39] young my father was God to us in the
[51:44] sense that he represented the strength
[51:46] in the family and he represented uh what
[51:50] we believed and he represented his word
[51:53] was the final Authority and so it meant
[51:56] something to have a father in my home
[51:59] and yet sometimes you know as as we get
[52:02] older I told you my dad passed away some
[52:06] years ago and and but God's given me
[52:09] other father figures that have filled
[52:12] that place and my brother JT is here
[52:14] this morning but the JT's been like a
[52:16] dad to me and I'm not afraid to tell you
[52:19] that brother JT because he's been that
[52:22] that figure for me for many years now
[52:24] and since I was a young man and and God
[52:27] gave me that God gave me a pastor
[52:29] brother Ivy I was there for 10 years and
[52:31] brother Ivey now we've at times
[52:33] disagreed like a father and son would
[52:35] but but God gave me brother Ivey for
[52:38] that time as a father figure and God
[52:41] will do that for you maybe your your
[52:43] father has gone on but we always need
[52:45] somebody to look up to and and people
[52:47] men in our lives I encourage you young
[52:49] people find a man in your life that you
[52:52] can look up to that you can emulate and
[52:55] yet many times we don't meet our dad's
[52:57] expectations
[52:59] I don't want to take a show of hands
[53:01] here today but I think if I did that
[53:03] well I didn't meet my dad's expectations
[53:06] in my life or I didn't always meet his
[53:09] expectations it it might be pretty close
[53:11] to a hundred percent and sometimes
[53:13] because of our failing as as children
[53:15] and sometimes because of the
[53:17] expectations of the dad maybe we're just
[53:20] a little bit too broad and and and we
[53:23] kind of do that don't we as dads we tend
[53:25] to expect a lot of our children I heard
[53:28] a story about the baseball player Keith
[53:30] Hernandez that uh he he was an All-Star
[53:33] he won numerous Gold Glove Awards and he
[53:36] was a he was a lifetime 300 hitter if
[53:39] that means anything to you as a if
[53:40] you're a baseball uh fan uh he was he
[53:43] was a really good guide one of the most
[53:45] valuable player award really good player
[53:47] and he talked about one day he called
[53:50] his father and and he says Dad he said I
[53:53] have a lifetime 300 batting average he
[53:55] said what more do you want and his
[53:58] father replied he said but someday
[53:59] you're going to look back and say I
[54:01] could have done more
[54:04] and we want to push our children a
[54:06] little bit don't we and and yet if you
[54:09] look at that in the reverse sometimes we
[54:10] don't always see the best reflection of
[54:14] a heavenly father in our own fathers
[54:16] and let's just be honest about it today
[54:18] it's Father's Day a day to honored
[54:20] fathers sometimes we don't see the best
[54:22] reflection and it's important that we
[54:25] recognize that Although our fathers are
[54:28] a reflection of God they are not God
[54:33] and they will make mistakes they're
[54:35] humans and the thing is as we grow up
[54:38] and we get older we make mistakes too
[54:41] and so we don't see the best reflection
[54:43] and I know many children especially Sons
[54:46] they become so discouraged because they
[54:49] don't see that reflection in their dad
[54:52] and so they begin to get discouraged and
[54:55] and they begin to they begin to turn
[54:57] away from the things of God because Dad
[54:59] was a Believer but this is what he did
[55:01] and I want to encourage you today don't
[55:03] do that but look to God who who your
[55:06] heavenly father who's perfect who does
[55:08] everything the way it ought to be done
[55:10] and and look at him don't look so much
[55:12] at us or even at me or or another father
[55:15] that would be here this morning look to
[55:17] God because he is our heavenly father
[55:22] sometimes we need to remind ourselves
[55:24] that God is different
[55:26] from our father
[55:28] in Hebrews 12 and 9 it says furthermore
[55:31] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[55:33] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[55:36] shall we not much rather be in
[55:38] subjection unto the father of spirits
[55:41] and live
[55:43] said for they verily for a few days
[55:45] chastened us after their own pleasure
[55:47] and we don't like to admit that but so
[55:50] much of the discipline that we do as
[55:52] dads we try to be just right in doing
[55:55] that but so much of it is based on how
[55:57] we feel and what mood we're in God never
[56:00] does that
[56:02] but but here he said they verily for a
[56:04] few days chastened us after their own
[56:06] pleasure but he for our prophet that we
[56:10] might be partakers of his holiness
[56:13] and so you might look at that and you
[56:15] might say well as we said to begin with
[56:18] I I don't see how I could ever know God
[56:20] I I don't see how I could ever see what
[56:22] kind of father that he is and and though
[56:25] I feel his spirit and I know I know him
[56:27] in the word but how would I see him well
[56:29] he was revealed by the son no man has
[56:32] seen God at any time but the only
[56:34] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[56:36] the father he hath declared him he was
[56:38] in the bosom of the father there's a
[56:40] revelation of the godhead in that very
[56:42] statement that he was in the bosom of
[56:46] the father he hath declared him brother
[56:48] said he first was god Jehovah and out of
[56:51] him he said let's just picture now it's
[56:52] a little drama so you can get it let's
[56:54] see coming out of space where there's
[56:56] nothing let's make it a little white
[56:58] light like a Mystic light like a Halo
[57:00] and that was the logos that went out of
[57:02] God in the beginning that was the son of
[57:04] God that come out of the bosom of the
[57:06] father he said that was what was in the
[57:08] beginning was the word and the Word was
[57:10] with God and the Word was God and the
[57:13] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[57:15] in the beginning was God and then out of
[57:17] God came to logos a part of God that
[57:20] went out of God
[57:21] and God being the only Creature if we
[57:24] could say it that way the only being
[57:25] that can divide himself without making
[57:28] less of himself
[57:30] right and so God he he his son the son
[57:35] come from the bosom of God
[57:37] Oh my he declared God because he was God
[57:43] Hallelujah and so that word he declared
[57:46] God that's I interpret I I expound I
[57:49] explain I make a declaration he declared
[57:52] him how did he declare him by his life
[57:54] and by his words and so he he even came
[57:57] in his father's name you'll find that in
[57:59] John 5 43. he declared that he was one
[58:01] with the father in John 10 and 30. he
[58:04] said I and the father are one
[58:07] in Isaiah 9 6 it was promised that he
[58:09] would actually be called the father he
[58:12] said For unto us a child is born unto us
[58:14] a son is given and the government shall
[58:16] be upon his shoulder his name Shall be
[58:18] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[58:20] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[58:23] Peace try to get a trinitarian to
[58:25] explain that to you today
[58:28] it's difficult because he is the
[58:29] Everlasting father yet he is the son
[58:35] now brother random says I used to think
[58:38] years ago
[58:39] that maybe God was angry with me but
[58:42] Christ loved me
[58:44] he said but come to find out it's the
[58:46] same person
[58:48] and Christ is the very heart of God
[58:52] he said I come from the bosom of the
[58:55] father come from his innermost being
[58:56] Christ is the very Heart Of God all that
[59:00] God was he poured into Christ
[59:05] so if we see what he revealed the father
[59:07] asks if he can we can see what he was we
[59:11] can see what he intends us to be and it
[59:14] would help us I think as fathers because
[59:16] we begin to realize that this is what
[59:18] we're supposed to be these are the
[59:20] attributes God once displayed in
[59:22] fatherhood but it would also help us as
[59:24] sons and as daughters we'd begin to see
[59:27] what kind of a god what kind of a father
[59:28] that we have
[59:30] because he is our father
[59:33] and I want to say first this morning as
[59:35] an attribute of God that your heavenly
[59:37] father is patient
[59:40] your heavenly father is patient
[59:44] now this is my worst flaw
[59:49] somebody said amen loudly
[59:52] this is my word all that Dad said amen
[59:55] this is my worst flaw a lack of patience
[1:00:00] and so many times I I find myself
[1:00:04] because to me to be on time is one of
[1:00:07] the the fruits of the spirit
[1:00:10] it's right up there with joy peace and
[1:00:13] and if you're not on time you won't have
[1:00:15] joy or peace you know
[1:00:17] and yet one of those other fruits is
[1:00:19] long-suffering or patience
[1:00:22] but to be on time of the day to me I I
[1:00:25] I've been late for maybe a handful of
[1:00:27] things in my life and I remember all of
[1:00:29] them
[1:00:30] they were traumatic experiences
[1:00:33] right and it doesn't matter what it's
[1:00:35] for I I don't like to be late
[1:00:38] I show up by the Daryl Ward laughed at
[1:00:40] me when he was here one time because he
[1:00:41] said I've never uh I've never seen the
[1:00:43] pastor for regular service two hours
[1:00:45] early when he didn't have to preach and
[1:00:48] but it's just the way I am I'm geared
[1:00:49] that way
[1:00:50] I got to be early my grandpa was that
[1:00:53] way Grandpa Pruitt he he said if you if
[1:00:55] tell me you're going to be there at 10
[1:00:56] o'clock you show up at 10 05 you lied to
[1:00:58] me
[1:00:59] that's that's just the way that he was
[1:01:02] but God is patient
[1:01:04] aren't you glad that he is
[1:01:06] she got he's not like us sometimes I I
[1:01:09] get so impatient with my family but
[1:01:11] God's not like that
[1:01:12] Matthew 5 43 you have heard that hath
[1:01:15] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:01:17] and hate that enemy but I say unto you
[1:01:19] love your enemies
[1:01:21] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:01:23] them that hate you pray for them which
[1:01:25] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:01:29] now he's telling us to act in a certain
[1:01:32] way
[1:01:33] because our father in Heaven acts that
[1:01:35] way he's declaring the attribute of the
[1:01:38] father to us and really this attribute
[1:01:41] is patience with people because God
[1:01:44] could wipe them all off the earth now if
[1:01:47] you had the power to wipe everyone off
[1:01:49] the Earth you might have already done it
[1:01:52] if I had the power I might have already
[1:01:55] done it if I could speak things in and
[1:01:57] out of existence just on a whim I might
[1:01:59] have already used that Authority
[1:02:02] but God does not
[1:02:05] oh my God suffers long oh my and so what
[1:02:09] he does he says if you're this way if
[1:02:11] you love your enemies if you do good to
[1:02:13] those who will never change
[1:02:16] you think about that for a minute it's
[1:02:18] not that you're doing good to people
[1:02:19] hoping that they'll change but Jesus was
[1:02:22] doing good to those who he knew would
[1:02:24] never change
[1:02:26] it was not in an effort to change them
[1:02:28] it was an attribute of who he was
[1:02:32] oh my and because he was the son of the
[1:02:36] father
[1:02:36] are you with me now Matthew 5 45 that
[1:02:39] you may be the children of your father
[1:02:42] which is in heaven for me he maketh the
[1:02:45] son to rise on the evil and on the good
[1:02:49] and sendeth Reign on the just and on the
[1:02:52] unjust I think people who leave church
[1:02:55] or who backside of her who are not sure
[1:02:57] of their Christian faith they they tend
[1:02:59] to question this the most why does God
[1:03:02] allow bad things to happen to good
[1:03:05] people and conversely why does he allow
[1:03:08] good things to happen to bad people
[1:03:11] why do people that are bad win sometimes
[1:03:15] and people that are good lose many times
[1:03:19] and we don't comprehend the extreme
[1:03:22] patience of God
[1:03:25] of an immortal being who who has no time
[1:03:29] limits
[1:03:30] who can be wherever he wants to be at
[1:03:33] any moment in history
[1:03:35] who does not live in time we we cannot
[1:03:38] wrap our minds around that
[1:03:40] and so we think well well and that's
[1:03:42] where David stood one day and he said
[1:03:44] Lord why do you allow these things to
[1:03:46] continue why do you allow bad things to
[1:03:48] continue to happen to people and David
[1:03:49] stood there and he and he's wandering
[1:03:52] he's wrestling with that but then he
[1:03:53] said I saw their end
[1:03:55] and you realize there is coming a day
[1:03:58] that L wrongs will be made right there's
[1:04:00] coming a judgment day there's coming a
[1:04:02] time when things shall be said in order
[1:04:04] they'll be right
[1:04:06] but it's the patience of God that allows
[1:04:08] us to live right now and allows the
[1:04:10] flowers to bloom and the sun to come on
[1:04:12] the earth and the things to happen the
[1:04:14] way they do the the thing is not you
[1:04:16] know when you look at when you look at
[1:04:19] the world really the question we should
[1:04:21] be asking is not why is there so much
[1:04:23] suffering in the world but why is there
[1:04:24] so much good
[1:04:27] because we've done everything we can to
[1:04:29] mess it up
[1:04:30] we've done everything as a human race
[1:04:32] we've done everything wrong and yet the
[1:04:34] heavenly father he suffers with us
[1:04:39] now he doesn't just suffer with the good
[1:04:41] he doesn't just suffer with the elect
[1:04:44] he suffers with those who knowledge
[1:04:50] so many young people grow up in church
[1:04:52] and become hurt
[1:04:54] because they get hurt by church people
[1:04:56] and they don't understand why God
[1:04:58] suffers with those people
[1:05:00] why does why why do they get anointed
[1:05:03] why can they sing why can they come to
[1:05:05] church why can they act like that in
[1:05:06] church and then they hurt me
[1:05:08] why are they able to do that and I've
[1:05:10] watched so many pastors kids so many
[1:05:12] young people and I say to my own
[1:05:13] children you just have to you just have
[1:05:15] to recognize the sovereignty of God and
[1:05:18] realize there is a day coming there is a
[1:05:21] Time coming when things will change
[1:05:23] there is a day coming when things will
[1:05:25] be perfect but it's not today
[1:05:29] and it won't it maybe not won't be in
[1:05:31] our lifetime but it's coming
[1:05:34] and so what do we do we love those that
[1:05:36] hate us
[1:05:38] and do good to those who don't do good
[1:05:40] to us
[1:05:42] he said for if you love them which love
[1:05:44] you what reward have you you do not even
[1:05:46] the public is the same if you salute
[1:05:48] your brethren only
[1:05:51] that's nonsense well I can only be good
[1:05:53] to people in my church where did that
[1:05:55] come from
[1:05:57] oh that's against the scripture if you
[1:06:00] salute your brethren only what do you
[1:06:02] more than others
[1:06:04] if you're only kind to those who who are
[1:06:07] good people or go to church with you
[1:06:09] what the Sinners do that
[1:06:12] what do you more than others do not even
[1:06:14] the public and so be therefore perfect
[1:06:17] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:06:19] is perfect in other words be be mature
[1:06:22] be be complete be be a son of your
[1:06:25] father
[1:06:28] as Earthly fathers
[1:06:30] it's easy to get impatient
[1:06:32] but God blesses even those who are not
[1:06:34] his for a Time
[1:06:37] God has a family how many believe that
[1:06:39] today he has a right to have a family he
[1:06:43] has elect that are his
[1:06:45] their children I believe you're his
[1:06:48] children this morning you're his
[1:06:50] children his elect his elector is he has
[1:06:53] a right just like I have a right to have
[1:06:54] a family
[1:06:55] right he has a right he's a father he
[1:06:58] has a family and he has children but now
[1:07:01] those children there's others that are
[1:07:03] not his children
[1:07:06] huh is that right
[1:07:08] there's some that are not his children
[1:07:10] there's some there's some that are on
[1:07:12] the Atlanta The Book of Life that are
[1:07:14] there because they've repent and give
[1:07:16] their hearts to God but they're not his
[1:07:17] elect
[1:07:19] there's others who are uh just against
[1:07:22] God they're uh they're they're just uh
[1:07:24] they're they're just have a wrong seed
[1:07:27] and they're just never going to serve
[1:07:29] God
[1:07:30] and yet The Sun Shines on all
[1:07:34] the rain falls on all
[1:07:38] and hardship even comes to the believer
[1:07:42] and to the elect
[1:07:44] and it's difficult for us to understand
[1:07:46] but God is patient
[1:07:49] he's patient the Bible says the Lord is
[1:07:51] not slack concerning his promise some
[1:07:54] men count slackness but it's
[1:07:56] long-suffering to us word aren't you
[1:07:58] glad that he is not willing that any
[1:08:01] should perish but that all should come
[1:08:03] to repentance
[1:08:05] he was patient with Cain who had a
[1:08:07] different father but he gave him a
[1:08:09] second chance
[1:08:10] he was patient with Esau could have
[1:08:12] received the birthright but he sold it
[1:08:16] he blessed Ishmael
[1:08:19] made him a great nation even though
[1:08:22] Ishmael would always persecute Isaac
[1:08:25] this is what he says about himself the
[1:08:27] Lord passed by before Moses and
[1:08:29] proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[1:08:31] merciful and gracious long-suffering
[1:08:33] abundant in goodness and Truth keeping
[1:08:36] Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity
[1:08:38] and transgression and sin aren't you
[1:08:41] glad that he does and that will by no
[1:08:43] means clear the guilty visiting the
[1:08:45] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:08:46] children upon the children's children
[1:08:48] unto the third and to the fourth
[1:08:49] generation he is patient
[1:08:52] but I'm glad he's also patient with the
[1:08:54] elect
[1:08:57] I'm glad he's patient with the elect
[1:09:00] because many times we don't get it
[1:09:03] we don't understand we're just like
[1:09:05] children we just don't understand
[1:09:08] and our perfect Heavenly Father you know
[1:09:11] you look at our own fathers I remember
[1:09:13] one time my dad got all upset dad would
[1:09:16] get upset if you couldn't do things
[1:09:17] right or wouldn't do things right and
[1:09:18] and he wanted things done a certain way
[1:09:20] and we were stretching barbed wire one
[1:09:23] time down in the farm and and you take a
[1:09:25] barbed wire if you buy cheap barbed wire
[1:09:27] it tends to snap when you stretch it to
[1:09:29] its full extent and we had uh we had a
[1:09:33] one of those things that would would
[1:09:34] make it stretch and and as we were going
[1:09:37] down there we'd string it out and then
[1:09:39] we'd stretch it and it'd snap and my
[1:09:41] older brother was doing that and he did
[1:09:43] that twice and snapped both times and
[1:09:45] dad got so mad you know and uh don't
[1:09:48] don't get a Halo above your head you
[1:09:50] probably have two at some point and it
[1:09:52] wasn't Sam's fault it was the Jeep
[1:09:54] barbed wire
[1:09:55] and that was proved later because Sam
[1:09:58] got Sam got upset and he walked back up
[1:09:59] to the house and wasn't very long here
[1:10:01] come dad walking back up it snapped on
[1:10:03] him too
[1:10:05] yeah
[1:10:06] because our fathers aren't perfect
[1:10:09] but when Jesus look how he dealt with
[1:10:11] Peter Peter he was so long suffering and
[1:10:13] patient with Peter see Jesus always did
[1:10:15] things right
[1:10:17] he always did things right he was never
[1:10:19] wrong in in his criticism or in his in
[1:10:22] his encouragement he was never wrong in
[1:10:23] those things and yet Peter over and over
[1:10:25] again stuck his foot in his mouth and
[1:10:27] said the wrong thing at the wrong time
[1:10:29] and and over and over again Peter he
[1:10:32] even denies Jesus three times
[1:10:35] and Jesus knowing that he would
[1:10:38] oh he knew that you would backside he
[1:10:40] knew that you would fall but he loves
[1:10:42] you anyway and he's Before Peter ever
[1:10:45] backslid he looked at him and he said he
[1:10:47] said when you get converted strengthen
[1:10:49] your brethren he said I prayed for you
[1:10:51] oh aren't you glad that he prayed for
[1:10:53] you too he said not only them but also
[1:10:56] those who come under their word
[1:10:58] amen he prayed for you and he said when
[1:11:01] you're converted go strengthen your
[1:11:03] brethren
[1:11:05] what was he doing display the attribute
[1:11:07] of the father showing us who the father
[1:11:09] was if he can be that patient with us
[1:11:12] shouldn't we be patient with our
[1:11:14] children
[1:11:18] your heavenly father
[1:11:20] it's not only patient he's observant
[1:11:23] sees
[1:11:26] he sees
[1:11:28] I can't count the times that I failed to
[1:11:30] see or failed to observe until it was a
[1:11:34] little bit late and then it caused a
[1:11:37] hurt
[1:11:38] sometimes we do that we just don't see
[1:11:40] the big picture
[1:11:42] so many people are not self-aware
[1:11:45] they just can't look at themselves and
[1:11:47] see you know my family would be better
[1:11:50] if I didn't do that
[1:11:52] and yet they think it's a good quality
[1:11:55] or the church would be better if I
[1:11:57] didn't do that but but they can't see
[1:11:59] that because we're not observing many
[1:12:01] times
[1:12:02] but God sees everything
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:05] he sees you in fact he says when you
[1:12:07] when you do alms in other words when you
[1:12:09] give money away when you give money away
[1:12:11] to charity or give somebody something
[1:12:13] let not thy left hand know what thy
[1:12:15] right hand doeth
[1:12:17] that thing almost may be in secret
[1:12:19] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:12:22] himself
[1:12:24] shall reward thee openly
[1:12:26] he sees what you do not just in church
[1:12:29] but at home and he knows everything you
[1:12:32] do he said in Matthew 10 29 are not Two
[1:12:34] Sparrows sold for a farthing and one of
[1:12:37] them shall not fall on the ground
[1:12:38] without your father
[1:12:40] but the very hairs of your head are all
[1:12:43] numbered I'm glad for that today
[1:12:46] see you not there for you're more value
[1:12:49] than many sparrows he sees you he sees
[1:12:53] everything again in Isaiah 40 21 1 he
[1:12:56] said have you not known have you not
[1:12:58] heard hath it not been told you from the
[1:13:00] beginning have you not understood from
[1:13:02] the foundations of the earth it is he
[1:13:05] that sitteth upon the circle of the
[1:13:07] earth now this was before even that they
[1:13:10] knew that the Earth was round science
[1:13:13] thought probably that the Earth was flat
[1:13:15] or at least it wasn't it wasn't a ball
[1:13:18] But Here Comes God speaking of the
[1:13:21] prophet Isaiah and it says he it is he
[1:13:23] that sent us on the circle of the Earth
[1:13:26] because if he sits on the circle of the
[1:13:27] earth he can see it all
[1:13:30] and the inhabitants thereof or as
[1:13:33] grasshoppers that stretches out the
[1:13:35] heavens as a curtain spreaded them out
[1:13:37] as a tent to dwell in
[1:13:40] he sees every thing
[1:13:44] again in Psalms 11 4 says the Lord is in
[1:13:46] his holy Temple the Lord stone is in
[1:13:48] heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try
[1:13:51] the children of men he sees you he sees
[1:13:54] you even before you can see him before
[1:13:56] you can recognize him well I'm so glad
[1:13:58] for that today even before you make a
[1:14:00] mistake he sees it even before you came
[1:14:02] to him he saw you
[1:14:04] and he showed that he expressed that
[1:14:06] through Jesus ministry when Nathanael
[1:14:08] come to him and he began to speak to
[1:14:10] nathaniels to behold an Israelite and
[1:14:12] whom there's no God and Nathanael said
[1:14:14] unto him when SnoWest thou me and Jesus
[1:14:16] answered and said unto him before Philip
[1:14:18] called thee when thou was under the Fig
[1:14:20] Tree I saw thee
[1:14:23] I saw thee Oh do you believe he sees you
[1:14:27] today
[1:14:27] do you believe that he sees you today
[1:14:29] that ought to that ought to stir us up a
[1:14:31] little bit I don't make us because when
[1:14:33] many times we look at this and think oh
[1:14:35] it's a bad thing that he sees the snow
[1:14:36] he knows anyway he knows what's going on
[1:14:38] he knows the depths of our of our sin
[1:14:41] and our depravity and everything else
[1:14:42] but he also sees us he knows us he knows
[1:14:46] that what we need he knows our needs he
[1:14:48] knows our our down sittings our Uprising
[1:14:50] everything that we have need up through
[1:14:52] the day he knows when we're in trouble
[1:14:53] he knows when we're afraid he knows
[1:14:55] everything about us
[1:14:58] that ought to stir us up a little bit we
[1:15:00] have a father who never misses
[1:15:03] one thing
[1:15:06] oh God oh I want to be that kind of a
[1:15:09] father
[1:15:10] but being human
[1:15:12] it'd be impossible for me to see
[1:15:14] everything
[1:15:16] but he sees everything
[1:15:20] and he sees
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:25] he also sees even the non-elect and they
[1:15:27] keep going back to that but it just
[1:15:29] shows us the bigness of God
[1:15:35] when they come to him
[1:15:37] he responds
[1:15:40] right and that's why it's so hard for
[1:15:42] some people to understand and say well
[1:15:43] only the elect filled the presence of
[1:15:45] God that's just not true
[1:15:48] I've been in many places worshiping in
[1:15:51] denominational churches where I felt the
[1:15:53] presence of God
[1:15:54] and it's the same presence that we feel
[1:15:56] because he honors it when people sing
[1:15:59] when they worship when they come to him
[1:16:01] he honors that
[1:16:03] it's the same rain that falls on the
[1:16:05] just and the unjust
[1:16:07] but the brown is making an altar call
[1:16:09] and he says this many many times in the
[1:16:11] message
[1:16:12] but here he said God bless you Sister
[1:16:14] back there he sees you
[1:16:16] he said if you believe me to be his
[1:16:18] servant
[1:16:19] when you raised your hands with a
[1:16:21] sincere heart
[1:16:23] oh my God when you raised your hands
[1:16:25] with a sincere heart the recording angel
[1:16:29] sticks your name right on the book
[1:16:33] now actually the elect child of God he
[1:16:36] my name was on the book before the
[1:16:37] foundation of the Earth
[1:16:39] right but if this is a person whose name
[1:16:42] wasn't there but he says that when he
[1:16:44] sees you
[1:16:45] oh don't be afraid to come to him today
[1:16:47] you may say well I'm not the elect I've
[1:16:49] done too much wrong I've done this out
[1:16:51] of the other but you come to him let him
[1:16:53] do the dividing let him do that part
[1:16:56] come to him all that will come to me he
[1:16:59] said let him that comes to me I give up
[1:17:01] his heavy burdens I'll give him rest
[1:17:04] me all you that are weak all you that
[1:17:06] are weary and heavy laden and I will
[1:17:07] give you rest all that are weary and
[1:17:09] heavy laden
[1:17:11] amen even those who are not attacked he
[1:17:14] sees
[1:17:15] and puts her name down
[1:17:19] oh my
[1:17:20] well I don't believe we should ever quit
[1:17:22] calling for sinners
[1:17:24] and witnessing the sinners
[1:17:26] we should never we should never neglect
[1:17:28] baptizing people and and witnessing the
[1:17:31] people and being the church because we
[1:17:33] don't just impact the elect
[1:17:37] but he sees even the not elect
[1:17:39] he sees how we treat them
[1:17:42] we're going back to Ishmael I said that
[1:17:45] he saw or Ishmael he treated Ishmael
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:49] he was the son of Abraham he told
[1:17:50] Abraham he said because he's your seed
[1:17:53] but he wasn't the elect seed
[1:17:56] right but because he was your seed he
[1:17:58] said I'll make a great nation out of him
[1:18:00] and he is a great nation he became a
[1:18:02] great nation a great people
[1:18:04] and and Islam Today it still is a thorn
[1:18:07] in the sight of Israel but God made them
[1:18:10] that
[1:18:12] and and there was a time when when Hagar
[1:18:15] was there and she began to get she began
[1:18:18] to get uh worried because Sarah began to
[1:18:21] persecute her you remember the story
[1:18:22] and she had gotten pregnant and Sarah
[1:18:24] realized she'd made a mistake
[1:18:26] and she gets upset at hagorn blames
[1:18:28] Hagar for her mistake and she sends
[1:18:32] Hagar out in the wilderness
[1:18:34] Hagar is the Egyptian Hagar is is not
[1:18:36] God's perfect will
[1:18:38] it's not that was through Sarah the seed
[1:18:41] would come through Sarah and yet God saw
[1:18:43] the Affliction of Hagar
[1:18:45] and he saw her out there in the desert
[1:18:48] and here she was out in the desert and
[1:18:50] as she's out in the desert and she's and
[1:18:53] she's she's getting to a place where
[1:18:55] she's not going to live anymore
[1:18:57] she's just not going to make it she can
[1:18:58] only make it so long the angel of the
[1:19:00] Lord appeared to her it was God speaking
[1:19:03] to her and called out to her and began
[1:19:05] to tell her go back to Sarah you're
[1:19:07] going to be okay the child that's born
[1:19:09] of you is going to live
[1:19:11] you know the story and at that time she
[1:19:15] she began to call on God she may have
[1:19:17] never known God before she may have
[1:19:19] never accepted him but in that time she
[1:19:21] began to call on God and she called the
[1:19:24] name of the Lord that's spoken to her
[1:19:26] thou God sees me
[1:19:29] thou God seized me for she said have I
[1:19:32] also here looked after him that seeth me
[1:19:36] she was also seen by God don't let the
[1:19:39] devil put in your mind say well maybe
[1:19:40] you're not feel like maybe God don't
[1:19:42] care about you he cares about those who
[1:19:44] care he cares for those if you care
[1:19:46] enough to raise your hand if that's all
[1:19:48] you can get out this morning it just
[1:19:50] erased your hand he cares about that if
[1:19:53] you come to the Altar and your heart is
[1:19:54] broken and you're worried about things
[1:19:56] in life he cares about that if you're
[1:19:58] worried about your family he cares about
[1:20:00] that if you've got something going on in
[1:20:02] your life he cares for you
[1:20:07] oh my
[1:20:11] your heavenly father
[1:20:13] is also forgiving
[1:20:16] he said if you forgive men their
[1:20:18] trespasses of your heavenly father
[1:20:20] will also forgive
[1:20:22] you
[1:20:26] mean so much to me
[1:20:28] God help me to be a forgiving father
[1:20:34] Jesus displays this over and over again
[1:20:36] in his ministry in his life never more
[1:20:39] than on the cross
[1:20:41] we stood there and we've preached on it
[1:20:42] but he stood there
[1:20:44] said father forgive them
[1:20:47] for they know not what they do
[1:20:50] and he's not speaking because they would
[1:20:52] ask for forgiveness they would go ahead
[1:20:54] and crucify him they wouldn't recognize
[1:20:56] his benevolence they they were not the
[1:20:59] seed of God they in fact he said you're
[1:21:01] of your father the devil he had already
[1:21:03] identified who they were and yet he
[1:21:05] prayed for those same people not because
[1:21:06] of who they were but because it was an
[1:21:09] attribute of God
[1:21:10] forgiveness is it was part of him
[1:21:13] father forgive them and then you see
[1:21:16] when the Holy Ghost came on on the
[1:21:18] people and it began to come on on the
[1:21:20] people of God they became forgiving and
[1:21:23] you see you see the uh you see the one
[1:21:26] that was down there and he began to pray
[1:21:28] to God and he was being stoned Stephen
[1:21:30] as he was being stoned you see him being
[1:21:33] stoned and Paul is standing there and
[1:21:35] this attribute of God that was on the
[1:21:37] cross was also in Stephen and he said
[1:21:39] father they don't know what they're
[1:21:40] doing
[1:21:42] he wasn't doing it because it saved to
[1:21:44] him it didn't maybe make no difference
[1:21:45] to them but there was an election of God
[1:21:47] standing there holding the coach at that
[1:21:49] time and he saw something in Stephen
[1:21:51] that maybe he didn't recognize for many
[1:21:53] years but he could go back to that
[1:21:55] moment and say at that moment I realized
[1:21:57] God cared he forgives
[1:22:02] if he could forgive why can't we
[1:22:07] Branham talked about the lady in the
[1:22:08] cafe you've all heard the story I don't
[1:22:10] mean to belabor the point this morning
[1:22:12] we talked about the lady that that was
[1:22:15] standing there and or was sitting in the
[1:22:17] seat he said he went in this Cafe
[1:22:18] because everything else was closed and
[1:22:20] here was people drinking and people a
[1:22:23] policeman playing a slot machine and it
[1:22:25] grieved his heart
[1:22:26] the kind of music that was being played
[1:22:29] he grieved his heart he didn't
[1:22:31] understand what was going on and he
[1:22:33] walked in there and he began to forget
[1:22:34] judgmental and critical so many of us do
[1:22:36] that today we get judgmental we get
[1:22:38] critical we don't realize we're hurting
[1:22:40] people not helping them
[1:22:43] but standing there was a judgmental
[1:22:45] attitude a critical attitude why is this
[1:22:46] music being played why are these people
[1:22:48] doing like they're doing here's the law
[1:22:49] standing there breaking the law here's a
[1:22:52] woman sitting there with several men and
[1:22:53] probably got pain all over her face and
[1:22:55] everything else
[1:22:56] I know he's sitting there thinking like
[1:22:58] that he has a vision and he sees he sees
[1:23:00] the Earth and he sees it rotating and he
[1:23:02] sees the uh he sees Jesus standing there
[1:23:05] and he sees in the type of division he
[1:23:08] sees the father and here he said Jesus
[1:23:10] was standing there and he had a book and
[1:23:12] had his name he said then it was
[1:23:13] everything he'd ever done that was wrong
[1:23:15] and he said here he was on the earth he
[1:23:17] said I saw myself doing things that were
[1:23:19] wrong
[1:23:20] he said and as I did it he said it would
[1:23:22] come up he would fly up to the father he
[1:23:24] said but through it's like a bumper he
[1:23:25] said like a bumper on a car there was a
[1:23:27] mist of blood that covered the Earth
[1:23:29] and that blood covered over all the
[1:23:31] Earth and and he said every time he
[1:23:33] would hit that blood it would it would
[1:23:34] come back on Jesus
[1:23:37] he said he'd Flinch and hit him and he
[1:23:39] flinched and he'd write down on it
[1:23:41] pardoned
[1:23:44] and he asked he said is that the sins of
[1:23:47] the world he said no that's your sin
[1:23:50] that's your sin he said I come out of
[1:23:52] the vision I realized I couldn't be
[1:23:53] critical of her
[1:23:55] and he went and led her to the Lord in
[1:23:56] that place told her about the vision
[1:23:58] letter to the Lord don't you realize
[1:24:00] that he's today he was what was he doing
[1:24:02] displaying the attribute of the father
[1:24:04] he forgives and brothers said every time
[1:24:07] when Jesus was standing there he'd take
[1:24:09] that page you wrapped pardon on in his
[1:24:10] own blood and he'd throw it in the sea
[1:24:12] of forgetfulness
[1:24:14] that's where my sin is today that's
[1:24:16] where your sin is why couldn't we
[1:24:17] forgive somebody else
[1:24:22] especially our children
[1:24:26] your heavenly father
[1:24:28] caring
[1:24:30] don't seem like it's about attributes of
[1:24:33] fatherhood you expect Manliness
[1:24:36] but these are manly attributes
[1:24:38] attributes of your heavenly father
[1:24:45] your heavenly father is caring he said
[1:24:46] behold the fowls of the air because if
[1:24:48] so not neither do they reap nor gather
[1:24:50] into barns
[1:24:51] get your heavenly father feedeth them
[1:24:54] are you not much better than they
[1:24:57] which of You by taking thought can add
[1:24:59] one cubit to a stature in other words
[1:25:00] you you can't make yourself taller even
[1:25:03] though you'd want to
[1:25:06] well I think you thought for Raymond
[1:25:08] consider the lilies of the field how
[1:25:10] they grow they they don't they told not
[1:25:12] neither do they spin
[1:25:14] yet I say unto you that even Solomon and
[1:25:16] All His glory was not arrayed like one
[1:25:18] of these
[1:25:19] wherefore if God's so clothed the grass
[1:25:22] of the field if he's that good of a
[1:25:24] provider
[1:25:25] that he provided water for a fish to
[1:25:28] swim in and a fish to swim there and he
[1:25:31] provided have you ever noticed the way
[1:25:32] the ecosystem works and different
[1:25:34] animals feed off one another you ever
[1:25:36] thought about that he provides the he
[1:25:39] provides the grass for the deer and he
[1:25:40] provides us a deer for me
[1:25:43] right
[1:25:44] at least if somebody else kills it
[1:25:48] I had a dream last night that I killed a
[1:25:50] deer I just remembering that I woke up I
[1:25:53] had a dream I killed deer out of season
[1:25:54] and brother Harvey was helping me cover
[1:25:55] it up
[1:25:57] we'll just let that pass it may not be a
[1:25:59] spiritual dream
[1:26:06] foreign
[1:26:09] brother Bill you're gonna have to get
[1:26:11] after me
[1:26:13] but he cares
[1:26:16] if he's that good of a provider he can
[1:26:18] provide the fish for me to fish
[1:26:20] he can provide the he can provide
[1:26:22] clothes for the lily
[1:26:26] that's what he said he can provide
[1:26:27] things for The Sparrows to eat if he can
[1:26:30] provide bugs and all the different
[1:26:31] things that work together and if you
[1:26:33] take any one of them out the ecosystem
[1:26:35] would come crashing down but it all
[1:26:37] works together
[1:26:38] why because of the provision of a of an
[1:26:41] all-knowing God an all-caring God if he
[1:26:45] closed the grass to the field how much
[1:26:46] more shall he clothe ye over ye of
[1:26:48] little faith
[1:26:51] the Bible says that he cast out Devils
[1:26:53] with his finger how many know that today
[1:26:55] he cast out Devils at his finger Luke 11
[1:26:58] 20 if I with the Finger of God cast out
[1:27:00] devils
[1:27:01] no doubt the kingdom of God has come
[1:27:03] upon you
[1:27:04] but brother Randall said notice when he
[1:27:06] went after the lost sheep that's you and
[1:27:07] I it wasn't his finger he took the lost
[1:27:10] sheep and put it over his shoulders he
[1:27:12] said how he cares for a lost sheep one
[1:27:14] that's straight out of some of them
[1:27:15] formal ungodly places in the desert and
[1:27:18] Wilderness out there he goes and gets
[1:27:20] him puts him over his shoulder seals him
[1:27:22] full of the Holy Ghost and sends him
[1:27:23] back to the fold
[1:27:25] he said the devil's just no more to
[1:27:26] Jesus he just kicks him out with his
[1:27:28] finger and goes on but the lost sheep he
[1:27:30] goes and hunts him up and lays him over
[1:27:32] his shoulder holds his legs like this
[1:27:34] and the most powerful part about a man
[1:27:35] is across his shoulders you know that
[1:27:37] lays it around his neck and cross his
[1:27:39] shoulders and here he comes packing him
[1:27:40] through the Wilderness what is it he
[1:27:42] cares
[1:27:44] shouldn't we care
[1:27:46] for our children
[1:27:49] number five your heavenly father
[1:27:52] giving
[1:27:55] he's giving
[1:27:57] boy got quiet
[1:28:00] but he's giving
[1:28:02] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[1:28:05] that is a father
[1:28:06] will he give him a stone
[1:28:08] if you ask a fish will he for a fish
[1:28:10] give him a serpent
[1:28:12] think about it
[1:28:14] if you shall ask an egg will he offer
[1:28:16] him a scorpion
[1:28:17] a little boy comes up to you and oh this
[1:28:19] is going to be great fun I'm going to
[1:28:21] give him a I'm gonna give him a stone
[1:28:23] instead of bread
[1:28:25] you don't think like that
[1:28:27] you give
[1:28:28] your son
[1:28:31] said if you've been being evil know how
[1:28:33] to get give good gifts into your
[1:28:35] children see you give and you might
[1:28:37] gripe about it
[1:28:39] you might complain about it
[1:28:42] you might worry about them
[1:28:44] but if you being evil know how to give
[1:28:46] good gifts into your children how much
[1:28:48] more shall your heavenly father give the
[1:28:51] Holy Spirit to them that ask him
[1:28:55] oh Hallelujah he said look how your
[1:28:57] Earthly parent before you came here
[1:28:59] before they knew you was coming made
[1:29:01] ready for your coming just think of that
[1:29:02] now your Earthly parents which an
[1:29:04] Earthly parent is only a type of a
[1:29:06] Heavenly parent if we know how to give
[1:29:08] good gifts to our children how much more
[1:29:10] does your heavenly father know how to
[1:29:12] give good gifts to his children
[1:29:15] they prepared you're coming but listen
[1:29:17] he is preparing you're coming there
[1:29:20] yeah he said let not your heart be
[1:29:21] troubled you believe in God believe also
[1:29:24] in me in my father's house I love that I
[1:29:28] love that in my father's house are many
[1:29:30] mansions many mentions brother Brown
[1:29:33] said many types of Tabernacles
[1:29:36] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:29:38] I'd go to prepare a place for you
[1:29:41] but the father he said knew that you
[1:29:43] would be here prepared everything for
[1:29:45] you before you got here your first
[1:29:47] coming here he had it ready for you when
[1:29:48] you got here isn't that marvelous to
[1:29:50] think of what he done he said but
[1:29:52] remember these are only temporal gifts
[1:29:54] and type we know that Moses and building
[1:29:56] the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:29:57] preparing it he said he made all things
[1:29:59] after the order of what he saw in heaven
[1:30:00] so the Earthly things only expressed
[1:30:02] what the Eternal things are and if this
[1:30:05] Earth that we live in today being so
[1:30:07] great as we love it and love to live and
[1:30:08] breathe the air and feed the flowers and
[1:30:10] things he said if that this here is the
[1:30:12] expression one that's dying is only
[1:30:14] expressing one that's Eternal when you
[1:30:16] see a tree struggling pulling trying to
[1:30:18] live that means there's a tree somewhere
[1:30:20] that doesn't have to do that
[1:30:22] when you see a man struggling to live
[1:30:24] somebody in the hospital or in a sick
[1:30:26] bed or in an accident struggling and the
[1:30:28] death rattles in their throat pulling
[1:30:29] and crying and screaming for Life what
[1:30:31] does that mean there's a place somewhere
[1:30:33] there's a body that doesn't struggle and
[1:30:35] scream for that it just doesn't do it
[1:30:38] he said now they're only temporal gifts
[1:30:40] to us these things that we have here in
[1:30:42] the Earth are temporal gifts God gave
[1:30:44] them to us he said only expressing that
[1:30:46] there is one where it's the Eternal one
[1:30:48] that's what Jesus has gone away to
[1:30:50] prepare the Eternal one for us he said I
[1:30:53] go to prepare a place
[1:30:55] for you
[1:30:57] shouldn't you want to give good gifts
[1:31:00] to your children
[1:31:02] I'd say as a father
[1:31:04] the greatest gift we could give our
[1:31:05] children is our time
[1:31:10] your heavenly father
[1:31:12] is merciful
[1:31:15] he's merciful
[1:31:18] Luke 6 36 be you therefore
[1:31:21] merciful as your father also
[1:31:24] is merciful
[1:31:26] judge not and you shall not be judged
[1:31:28] condemn not you
[1:31:30] give
[1:31:32] forgiven
[1:31:34] give and it shall be given unto you I
[1:31:37] love this good measure in other words
[1:31:40] give you a little extra like you are
[1:31:42] going to a store that you frequented and
[1:31:45] the person wants to treat you right
[1:31:47] and back when they had to take it out of
[1:31:49] a flower sack and they they put the
[1:31:51] flour in your own vessel or or something
[1:31:53] that you brought they'd put in there but
[1:31:54] they didn't just give you flour they
[1:31:56] didn't just give you sugar but they gave
[1:31:57] it to you with a good measure they
[1:31:59] didn't try to cheat you press down
[1:32:02] compacted together shaken together so it
[1:32:05] would settle so they could put more in
[1:32:07] and running over
[1:32:09] amen he said shall men give unto your
[1:32:12] bosom if you give people give like that
[1:32:14] to you for with the same measure that
[1:32:16] you meet with all that shall be measured
[1:32:18] to you again
[1:32:20] the merciful obtained Mercy he said
[1:32:22] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:32:24] obtain Mercy
[1:32:27] he had mercy on The Sinner in Matthew 9
[1:32:29] and 10. he says it came to pass as Jesus
[1:32:31] said it meet in the house behold many
[1:32:33] Republicans and sinners came and sat
[1:32:34] down with him and his disciples and when
[1:32:36] the Pharisees saw it they said it to his
[1:32:38] disciples why eateth your master with
[1:32:40] publicans and sinners but when Jesus
[1:32:42] heard that he said unto them they that
[1:32:43] be whole need not a physician but they
[1:32:45] that are sick
[1:32:47] but go you and learn what that meaneth I
[1:32:49] will have mercy and not sacrifice I have
[1:32:52] not come to cause the righteous but
[1:32:53] Sinners to repent repentance
[1:32:56] but the brand them again at an altar
[1:32:58] call he said little children many of
[1:32:59] them put their little hands up God be
[1:33:01] merciful to them
[1:33:02] many of the old in the middle age they
[1:33:04] put their hands up the teenagers put
[1:33:06] their hands up they're wanting mercy God
[1:33:08] I'm so glad to know that the first
[1:33:10] revelation of Christ is Mercy
[1:33:13] the second Revelation is judgment
[1:33:16] listen to me as fathers we need to
[1:33:18] approach our children that way
[1:33:20] our first revelation ought to be Mercy
[1:33:23] we shouldn't be looking for reasons to
[1:33:25] condemn we shouldn't be looking even
[1:33:27] with our brothers and sisters we
[1:33:28] shouldn't be looking for reasons to find
[1:33:30] fall our first revelation has to be
[1:33:32] Mercy his first revelation was Mercy his
[1:33:35] second was judgment
[1:33:37] he said oh God thank you for those who
[1:33:39] have taken Mercy tonight Mercy's Road
[1:33:41] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:33:43] obtain Mercy blessed are they do hunger
[1:33:45] and thirst for righteousness they shall
[1:33:47] be filled
[1:33:49] and finally your heavenly father
[1:33:53] is great
[1:33:55] great
[1:33:57] oh my
[1:33:58] I think we sing that sometimes without
[1:34:00] really
[1:34:01] thinking about it
[1:34:03] he's great
[1:34:05] John 10 29 Listen to How Great he is
[1:34:09] My Father which gave them to me
[1:34:12] is greater than all
[1:34:14] Hallelujah he's so great but Brother
[1:34:18] David I can't even remove myself from
[1:34:20] his Mercy
[1:34:23] amen that's great
[1:34:26] I think of that song often prone to
[1:34:28] wonder how how I feel it prone to leave
[1:34:30] the Lord I love here's my heart now take
[1:34:32] conceal it seal it for thy courts above
[1:34:34] the lyric runs through my mind
[1:34:36] constantly because I think Lord I'm
[1:34:38] prone to wander seal my heart
[1:34:41] feel me and I don't say that because I
[1:34:43] don't have the Holy Spirit but I realize
[1:34:44] this is a body of Flesh and every day I
[1:34:47] need to be refilled by the Holy Spirit
[1:34:49] I need to be refilled me but he is
[1:34:51] greater than all no man is able to pluck
[1:34:54] them out of my father's hand no man is
[1:34:56] able quit looking at what people think
[1:34:58] about you your God is great your father
[1:35:01] is great
[1:35:02] what was he doing he was revealing the
[1:35:04] greatness of the father
[1:35:07] he was bigger than the storm how many
[1:35:09] believe that today bigger than the
[1:35:11] hunger of the five thousand bigger than
[1:35:13] death itself at the grave of Lazarus big
[1:35:15] enough to take care of you and me
[1:35:18] glory to God
[1:35:20] he's a big God
[1:35:22] but the brand called him a big father
[1:35:23] eagle
[1:35:25] we've talked about that recently but I
[1:35:27] come back to it today it just seems like
[1:35:29] it fits in he said I can see the big
[1:35:31] father Eagle as he's walking around over
[1:35:34] the nest he loves to look at his
[1:35:37] children
[1:35:39] I love that I do that
[1:35:42] I like to look at my children even
[1:35:44] during church I see what they're doing
[1:35:46] and I put my glasses on to see it but
[1:35:49] I love to look at my children
[1:35:51] I like to see how they grow I like to
[1:35:54] know that they're around
[1:35:56] I don't like them to be too far away
[1:35:59] why because they're they're a reflection
[1:36:02] of being
[1:36:03] and no matter you know there's something
[1:36:05] about being a father that there's Mercy
[1:36:07] in that because no matter how bad you
[1:36:08] mess up if you've got good kids you can
[1:36:10] always look at that and say I got good
[1:36:12] kids
[1:36:15] hey man somebody

[1:41:04] can talk to
[1:41:05] a big God but one that's merciful a big
[1:41:09] God but one that's patient musicians go
[1:41:10] ahead and come I'm done a big God but
