morning amen god bless you i i wanted to announce to you just before brother darrell comes and we've had a a a positive week as a church and not everybody's here this morning some more i'll be here this afternoon and been on vacation and things but but i wanted to tell you some of you already know uh as of today we are completely debt free as a church so we thank the lord for that i i talked to to you last week about how we were trying to pay off the rest of the fellowship paul and and some things worked supernaturally and and to where uh we were provided and some of the folks that had come from bransville from the church where i used to pastor i'll embarrass him this morning but that church was sold because there was no way they could continue to have services so they've been congregating with us and we're glad to have them and uh that church was sold the building sold in one week from the date they put it up to sell until the date that they sold it and uh they used some of the proceeds of that to pay off the fellowship all and so we are we are so happy for that and god has done some marvelous things for us as a church i've seen the hand of the lord just move supernaturally in so many ways and and we are grateful and and so we want to worship him that's what we're here for this morning and and we have our brother daryl ward with us but let's sing that of course in moments like these if you know that in moments like these and we want to take this moment to worship him for what he's done and thank him for it it's his goodness that we're even able to be here i know brother daryl could say amen to that this morning as well he's recovered from covet and i have as well but he had it really bad and but the lord seemed fit to bring him by our way this morning and to restore him back to health and so we're grateful for that today let's sing this together raise your hands to him as you sing it oh in moments like this i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus in moments like this oh i lift up my hands oh i lift up my hands too you lord let him know about it this morning i love you lord you sing it again in moments like these or in moments like this i sing out a song oh i sing out a love song to jesus oh in moments like these oh i lift up my hands yes i lift up my hands [Music] i love you lord [Music] is [Music] amen we're gonna have another word of prayer this morning before i asked brother darrell to come brother adam perez had come in earlier and and someone noticed that his truck was smoking and uh maybe the engine compartment had actually uh gone on got on fire this morning and so he was driving it back home and one of the deacons was going to follow him let's pray for that situation that everything will be okay and then you know the devil fights when you try to do something right and it's right to be in the house of the lord and so the devil always fights you hardest on sunday mornings and so i pray that they'd be able to come back and and but right now uh we're praying that everything will be okay there and then if you have a special need by way of uplifted hand would you just raise that to the lord and let's all pray together heavenly father i pray for this situation brother adam lord we know that you're a god who can do all things and so i pray that everything would be okay and lord whatever was smoking on fire we know that you're able to to make that right lord and i pray for safety and protection for all those involved i pray god that you would help us every one of us had to fight to get here on a sunday morning but we pray god that you would just give us a special blessing today lord we're not on a picnic we're in a battlefield or a warriors lord fighting the lord to be and to do the things that you want us to do the flesh fights against us the devil fights against us the world fights against us but we have our a champion on our side that is bigger than all of those things so we thank you for that today lord i pray you bless brother daryl as he comes to preach lord and that each and every thing that's said or done would be for your glory and your honor in jesus name amen let's sing that only believe as brother daryl comes this morning oh lee believe all things are possible if you only believe oh [Music] jesus here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible amen praise the lord you say how do you know that because i brought him with me isn't that wonderful he's with us that's the purpose of the gospel that the god above us and the god with us his desire was to be the god in us amen making you the super sign for today in jesus day he was the super sign it was god in flesh the prophet said that was a super sign but now that god wants to dwell on his people so you are the super sign to this generation god dwelling in his people making him the same yesterday today and forever what a privilege it is to be a part of the economy of god amen aren't you glad to know the good news this morning there's so much fake news and this news and that news you don't know what to believe but i'm so glad we know what to believe this morning amen amen we serve a god who cannot fail his word cannot fail and him and his word is the same amen and what a privilege it is to be a part of the economy of god and we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and coming over here yesterday got to thinking how young i was the first time i came into to arkansas to preach the gospel just a young fellow in my 20s and here we are i'll be 61 year old this month and you think where does time go you know just but here we have no continuing city but notice what paul said he didn't say there was a city that didn't continue that's not what he said paul just said that city's not here i'm so glad i've changed citizenships aren't you that we're citizens of the city that has no end praise god i was thinking as you were singing that song in moments like these it reminded me of when many years ago when my daughter was hurt so bad and been struck by the train and the two of my family was dead and was in the hospital with her and she had all these tubes running out of her everywhere they was in her neck they was in her stomach and i used to get her had a little rocking chair there in the room and i'd get her up out of the bed and get all those tubes where i could put her up in my arms and i would sit there and i would sing that song in moments like these i sing out a song then the day that the lord touched her was able to bring her home from the hospital and got home and 67 days of being in the hospital and all the people that come to welcome jessica home and after everybody left and it got quiet that evening i sat down and put her in my arms sang that same song in moments like these and i'm so glad that in the good moments and in the bad moments it does not change who he is amen he's the same yesterday today and forever may the lord richly bless you if you have your bibles this morning turn with it to the book of proverbs we want to read from proverbs chapter 3 starting at verse 23 and certainly good to see each one out may the lord richly bless you proverbs 3 23 certainly grateful to be over the coved virus i seen the other day i'm still the brother being there someone that said that cobit was nothing but a myth and i thought man if it's that bad as a myth i certainly don't want it to be a reality it's certainly not a myth it's real but we serve a real god i told the church i don't know who started the kova but i certainly know who's able to stop it amen so praise the lord to know him is life proverbs 3 23 do you love him this morning praise the lord proverbs 3 23 then shall thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble and when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shall lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of the sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh notice when it cometh it will come it's going to come amen they said don't be afraid do not be afraid of the sudden fear neither of the desolation of the lick of the wicked when it cometh amen for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you the little message the lord gave us here just the other day on when thou liest down to sleep heavenly father lord we are so grateful this morning to be able to gather here with your people lord and father we are so happy in our hearts lord to know you the giver of life the author and finisher of our faith and lord it's with a gratitude heart that we bow our heads before you this morning just to thank you lord for your goodness and your mercy to know lord that situations change and governments change and people change but you never change lord you're the unchanging god lord we can have confidence that that which you said no matter how many years ago it was when you spoke it it's just as true today as it was then and lord you said in your word where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their midst lord we are so glad in our hearts to know that you've not left us nor forsook us lord but you're right here with us now and lord i pray that this message would touch someone's heart lord for god we know that you're such a caring god that it may be only one person lord you would cause an anointed man to deliver a message to speak to that one heart because that's just the way you are bless your people today lord bless brother ben and the officers of the church use them dear god in a great way lord did this area may know dear god that you're the same yesterday today and forever heal our sick lord you see these needs dear god of that caleb caps lord the boy that was in the accident lord his best friend was killed god he has to live with that lord i pray that not only physically will you restore him but mentally may you touch him also lord be with the beret family today of the loss of their son god may you discomfort their hearts lord oh god when the service is said and done today may our hearts rejoice because you have spoken to us through your word we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says may god bless you saints you may be seated hallelujah amen you know it always amazes me that we serve a god that's so great we serve a god that's so awesome that he created not only a universe but he created universes and he created billions upon billions of stars and our god who created billions upon billions of stars i can't count that far i don't even have enough toes to count that far but billions of billions of stars and the bible says that the god we serve knows every star by name he knows all things he even knows the prophet said that every time that a gnat backs its eye i'm 60 year old i can't even see in that and yet god is so great that he knows every time that a gnat bats its eye the prophet of god says he knows every b think about this for a minute he knows every bee and where that bee goes in the comb to get its honey he knows every b and where every bee goes what part of the honeycomb that that bee goes to get the honey god knows that this morning lord that ought to make you shout he knows every sparrow that's in the tree he knows every sparrow that falls to the ground and he's mindful of it this morning he knows every thought that's in your mind today a god so great a god so knowing a god so awesome as i stood the other morning out in the field and was watching that comet that was passing through the area the first time and they said six thousand years santa said the last people on the earth to see this comet was adam and eve and to stand there and watch that in the sky as i took my camera and caught a picture of it about 4 50 in the morning and i stood there and i raised my hands and i said how great thou art god a god so great a god so knowing a god so awesome and yet he's a god who cares a god so great a god so awesome and yet a god so caring that he cares about the littlest aspects of our lives brother branham said that the god raised up that little bluegill on dale hollow lake to show us that god cares for the little things god's so great and yet he cares about something so little that he even cares about the aspects the littlest aspects of our life he even cares about our sleep think about this this morning for he said in his word when thou liest down to sleep be not afraid when thou liest down to sleep god said thy sleep shall be sweet you see god has given us a promise in his word that we can have a good night's sleep come on he wants you he wants your sleep to be restful he wants your sleep to be peaceful he wants your sleep to be sweet pleasant a god so great that he even cares about your sleep now listen to this in discernment the prophet in discernment he said a little lady sitting back there with a little white jacket or thing on you can't sleep at night do you believe the lord jesus is going to give you sleep from now on that you might know i was this prophet or a servant that's your husband sitting by you you believe god can heal him if god would reveal to me what his trouble is will you believe it then the arthritis will go from you sir you can go home now and be well and be a happy family because the man is healed of arthritis and his wife's going to get a good night's sleep he didn't call out cancer he didn't call out tuberculosis he called out a woman who was having trouble sleeping why you can go home and be a happy family because he cares you see brother branham mentioned can't sleep he put those two words together as i searched it through the message 38 times did brother brandon mention those two words together can't sleep and out of those 38 times 15 different times was in discernment and while in discernment he mentioned that sleeplessness the inability to sleep 15 different times he mentioned it was caused by nervousness let me show you what i mean all right you believe now i see you're having some you you keep sitting up in bed you just keep sitting oh it's you you can't sleep it's your nerves isn't that right a nervous condition you just can't sleep at night here's another one this man is going from me years ago your trouble started you probably look 15 years or more younger than you are right now it's a nervous condition it has bothered you with nerve trouble i see you can't sleep you're patient around restless it's a nerve it's caused it's a nerve cause you don't know what it is the doctors can't locate what it is they don't know what it is but i'm telling you under discernment it's your nerves it's a nervous condition you had a you had a feeling move over you that's the angel of the lord oh i wonder sometimes you ever been in service and just that real sweet warm feeling come over you and you just want to raise your hands and you just want to praise the lord and a tear just runs down your face i wonder could it be the angel of the lord you had a feeling move over you that's the angel of the lord it is right here between us right now see see here now the lady's moving away from me she's very much distressed i see her in a bedroom she can't sleep she's walking up and down the floor she goes into another room she comes back she goes into another room she goes into a little place and gets some kind of something it's a little powder to take to go to sleep she's trying her condition her condition is a nervous condition and she's taking powders to keep asleep sleeping pills sleeping powders she's taking them to get some sleep and she's taking so many of the powders till they've just about got the best of her she's just about ready to go into a nervous breakdown and be finished that's thus saith the lord woman suffering with nervous condition taken so many powders to try to get some rest that the prophet said it's broken down to the point she's just about finished but the root of the whole thing it wasn't the mattress it wasn't the pillar it wasn't the air conditioning the problem was it was nerves it's to bind people with sickness and with fear and a lot of times people end up sick because in their spiritual realm they have this nervous problem or something is happening and it reflects over into the physical realm and many times because of nerves people get sick with their stomach they get ulcers they get headaches and it's nothing more than their nerves because satan uses that avenue you'll notice sometimes if you've ever been in a meeting when a demon manifests itself many times if it's a woman they'll speak as a man why because satan's trying to bring fear he feeds off fear amen one of his tactics is to bind us with fear to the place it makes us physically sick i'm just too nervous to go to church and now father you're moving showing signs and wonders the great atomic age is here nation against nation kingdom against kingdom the people are nervous you said it would be fear upon the people perplexity of time the stress between nations men's hearts failing for fear oh what a day we are living in this is not something that's going to be this is something that's here now we are in the atomic age the age of destruction amen men's hearts failing for fear perplex of time there's distress between nations the earth is getting so nervous until it's bursting forth earthquakes everywhere everywhere i was telling brother ben and him i was coming out of tennessee into missouri headed over to kenneth there the other day and there's a big billboard about shakeout what to do in the event of an earthquake i thought what a funny place for an earthquake sign and then i remembered the madrid fault line and i was sitting in my house about about three or four weeks ago on a sunday morning and i couldn't sleep so i got up and came downstairs and i i was sitting there so i wouldn't disturb the wife and all of a sudden the house began to shake and behind the the things on the wall by began to slap against the wall and i looked up onto the patio and we had these metal chairs and they were rocking by their self i thought my lord what in the world's happening and i jumped up and about that time i heard my wife she jumped up and she began to run and my daughter began to run and jess was going what is it daddy what is it i said it's an earthquake in east tennessee a 5.9 earthquake struck part sparta north carolina three hours or four from where we live and four hours away it shook my house so hard that the furniture was moving by itself the bible said it would be that way i bet you don't even know where sparta is do you many different places earthquakes will strike in diverse places many different places why why are there so many earthquakes i have an earthquake quail earthquake covey cometh let me try that again i have an earthquake app thank you on my phone and it tells you how many earthquakes are happening you ought to look at it sometimes it is astounding how many earthquakes are happening around the world and the prophet said what is it it's the earth she's so nervous she's bursting forth earthquakes everywhere jesus said it would be that way there'll be earthquakes in divers places what's the matter the earth knows she's doomed and she's nervous the world's nervous the world is nervous but the church is rising in the gospel amen hallelujah as the world is going down guess what the church we're fixing to go up we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger the word is getting real the power of god is getting real the third pull is no longer a quote it's becoming a reality because as the world goes down he promised us i will take you up amen oh hallelujah amen amen the gospel as this rising amen the church is rising in the gospel tucked away with security he that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out oh i'm so glad this morning brother joe that he covers me with his feathers i am so glad this morning to know that god has got his arms his wings great jehovah the eagle he has stretched his wings over us and we are under his protection amen well if we're under his protection that means we're on a picnic not not no no well if we're under his protection nobody will get sick and nobody will have this and there'll be no trial he never said that he never said we wouldn't have trials he never said we wouldn't hurt he never said we wouldn't suffer come on somebody he never said we wouldn't have to bury loved ones he never said we wouldn't cry but he did say hallelujah i will never leave you nor will i forsake you then it doesn't matter hallelujah brother david it doesn't matter what i'm going through with as long as he's with me amen when you can trust in god to the point that you simply give your life to him the other night when my fever was so high i was shaking so hard i could not even control my body my wife got me in the shower and packed me an ice trying to get the fever down and i was staring laying there on the floor and i began to cry out to god and i said god live or die my life is in your hands lord whoa what a place what a place when your fever is running high when you don't know whether you'll be able to get another breath or not and when you go to breathe and it's just not there and your lungs are so tight i'm so glad that when i'm in that condition that my god is still with me hallelujah he's still in control he's still on the throne let me tell you nothing happens to you but what god knows it amen would somebody help me preach this morning whoa hallelujah he that cometh to me i will know was cast out the bride is secured in a time of trouble in the hour of gross darkness when gross darkness covers the earth and gross darkness covers the people is that where we're at absolutely the children of the world walk in darkness they walk at night time huh you ever seen them burning cities or burning buildings down in the daytime no way they wait tonight the riders come out at night wearing come on somebody they come out at night wearing black in the night time in the nighttime that's when the cockroaches come out that's when all those creatures come out why the darkness hallelujah they love the darkness more than they love light the bible said me and the people love darkness more than they do light because the light would manifest their deeds and when spiritual darkness gets upon the earth when the darkness is that dark when it's so gross upon the people and upon the earth it's that time that the enemy attacks we're at that hour of gross darkness my wife showed me a video clip the other day of a river that was out of its banks a raging river and there was a house there beside the river and as the water came out of its banks it began to come upon this house and the house began to move a little bit and right there before our eyes the house collapsed and was washed away in a moment of time it was standing there at the next moment you could never tell it had ever been there because the flood had carried it away amen it destroyed the house it broke it up it washed it away and the spiritual darkness upon the earth has opened up the floodgates of hell hallelujah to allow the god of this evil age to unleash his destruction to unleash it upon our communities upon our government upon our homes upon our families satan is like a flood the bible said he's like a roaring lion he's not a lion but he acts like a lion a raging river of water destroying anything in its path the world around us today is under a spirit of destruction and the prophet of god said before they can ever be destroyed they must first come under the spirit of destruction is that where they're at you can't hardly find anybody anymore that's not tattooed all up one side and down the other destroying their bodies putting all this they can't even go out in a lightning storm they got so much metal in their mouth and their ears and their nose destroying their bodies huh i saw the other day up there in kinslow wisconsin where they just had the right in two days 50 million dollars worth of destruction please tell me please tell me what burning a car dealership to the ground has to do with equal rights it's a spirit that's on the people to destroy what they don't agree with the council culture if you don't agree with them they will cancel you out priest brother thank you believe it will it's the hour that we're living in jesus said in saint john 10 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy they are under an anointing of destruction satan wants to steal your joy he wants to steal your peace he wants to rob you of every redemptive blessing that jesus secured for you at calvary these blessings these promises in this bible belongs to you it's not something you're going to get it's something that you have now and people will let satan rob them of what jesus already paid for oh god help us this morning lord brother branham said satan amen satan following you along a great big kingly priestly goliath follows you along trying to scare the liver out of you what a way to put it i'm glad i can understand that kind of talk the devil follows you around trying to scare you we're living in an hour that everything now is a phobia homophobia islamophobia they've got phobias i can't even pronounce come on you ever heard of that before 10 years ago when i first came here to arkansas in the uh in the middle 80s i never heard of the word but now everything is a phobia men's hearts failing with phobia fear fear think about it friends fear of missing the rapture fear of dying fear of losing loved ones a fear of colvin people are scared to death of it you see people walking around with hazmat uniforms on that's the god's truth i saw a guy had a hoodie on and a glass lid off of a cooking pot had it in front of the hoodie pulled down with that over his face walking in walmart that's the truth scared scared people scared to death listen to me i do not fear coving i respect it but i don't fear it come on friends don't be foolish well i guess i'll bless god i'll go out there no don't be foolish if you know somebody's got it get away from them but i'm not going to fear it that i can't come to church because of it come on somebody we trust the lord we wash our hands come on i saw a sign coming up here yesterday at a baptist church said jesus cleanses the heart from sin and we disinfect the pews that's pretty good fear fear of dying fear people are so scared they're afraid to go out to the store they're afraid to go get groceries afraid of being attacked fear things not happening the way people thought it would happen seems like everything's going sideways well i thought we're the bride this is third pull time i didn't think we'd be like i never either i never in my mind dreamed that in january 2020 we would be here like we are in september who ever thought that a virus would shut down churches around the world but you see things may not happen the way we think they'll happen but god is still in control look god didn't say ah i didn't know that was going to happen i tell you boy satan pulled one over on me that time i got to figure out how to no sir he knew it was going to happen amen what does it do it reminds me of the time that god was bringing israel to the promised land had a prophet they had a pillar of fire they were coming out of bondage they had a message they were in an exodus sound familiar a prophet with a pillar of fire with a message coming out of exodus in an exodus sound familiar and they come to cadence barnea a junction point a junction of time and god told them send spies into the land that i've already given you and they go in and search out the land and coming back was two of them it's packing grapes and they're just sweating and grunting and groaning they said my god did you bring the whole vineyard i said van you're nothing that's just one bunch and they said before the people it's just the way god said it god don't lie his promise is true it is a land filled with milk and honey but oh my you see goat's butt sheep say amen but they are giants in the land they are walled cities and we in their eyes look like glasshoppers and we just can't do it we've come this far first pool second pool we've come this far but we've reached the point we just can't do it we didn't know about these giants we didn't know about these walled cities oh it's a good land but think about it ten against two there was two there you know the story caleb and joshua an 80 year old man steered up he calmed the people down said everybody calm down give me my mountain but ten against two and they said we saw josh the son of enoch which come of the giants and we were in our own side as grasshoppers and so we were in versailles but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land for which we have gone to search out is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and all the bible says in numbers 14 1 oh the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night there was no sleep in the camp because of their fear fear had gripped him to the point that they took the report of the spies over the report of the god who gave the promise think about that and here they were ain't it something that 10 people in one night's time spread that negative report through almost 2 million people had to be facebook two million people the bible said the whole congregate they lifted up their voice and cried to the lord [Music] and every time they went to get a deep breath to let out another cry they heard what in the world is that we're trying to cry we're trying to be in distress we're trying to be nervous we're trying to what in the world is that and they peeped over into the next ten you know who it was it was caleb he was just having him a good night's sleep because the bible said when thou liest down be not afraid do not be afraid and your sleep shall be sweet they were wailing and crying and caleb got him a good eight hour sleep oh amen there was no sleep in the camp because the report caused them to lose confidence in the god who gave the promise but that don't take away from the real thing that'll take away from the word i don't care if everybody quits and walks away i don't care if this preacher quits and walks away i don't care what i shall not be moved like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved it does not change the promise plagues pandemics riots it does not change the promise of god's word in the evening time it shall be light amen what made caleb so sure of it when the opposition was so great it's according to what you're looking at caleb was looking at the promise of god his confidence was in god the other 10 was looking at the circumstances you see if you look at the circumstances or you look at what's around you you will surely fail you must never look at what's around you you must never look with the eyes of your head we must look with the eyes of our heart eve made her mistake when satan come along with this theology his theology and she mixed it and gave it to adam and it caused the hybrid faith and the prophet said that's what the church has got today the so-called church has a hybrid faith you believe oh i believe believe god heals i believe but you see when faith the prophet said is mixed with fear doubts frustrations then it becomes a hybrid faith well i believe but i'm scared to death brother they say this cancer is the worst one they've ever seen that's a hybrid faith well yeah god heals cancer but i don't know if he can heal me or not that's a hybrid faith i believe god delivers but i can't just get over this habit that's a hybrid faith you're mixing your faith with fear and doubt and frustration and you're sure to fail but genuine faith does not move god says anything it'll be that way i don't care what happens i don't care how bad it looks if god said there'll be a bride and god said there'll be a rapture they will be a bride and they will be a rapture but satan he turned it together and mixed it up and gave it to eve and what did it produce death you see satan wants you to see the problem but not the answer he wants you to see the symptom but not the healing the chaos but not the calm he wants you to see the storm but not the rainbow he wants you to see the darkness but not the light it's a nervous age the prophet said what is it the church is in a neurotic state every church is proselyting and pulling and fussing and stewing it's a neurotic age the world is in chaos but the prophet said the world is in chaos but i say stand still that's the message god is calling his church to a halt stand still don't be jumping and running not knowing what you're doing not knowing where you're going come back to the word come back to christ come back to the promise amen and stand upon the word for faith must have something to anchor on let it anchor it will not anchor all sensation it will not anchor on emotion but the word of god faith in the word of god that's the faith's anchor point is the word of god be confident in the one who gave the promise brother baby said i give a solemn warning to the church stand still god always commands to stand still before he does anything well brother i don't think it's going to be this way i guess this message is wrong it don't change the message honey come on it'll be exactly the way god said it would be i don't care how it looks well so and so left the message they went out from us because they were not a part of us amen preached thank you believe a will come on stand still and see the promises of god you see god doesn't make a promise that he can't keep the prophet said god will bankrupt heaven before he will let one promise he made fail we have a word from the lord he told us these things would come he told us these times would come did he not but he said when these things begin to come to pass he didn't say quit church have less church he said when these things come to pass then lift up your head your redemption draweth now assemble yourselves together even more so not less as you see the day approaching let's do what he said amen he told us what to look for he said when we see these things come to pass that's my message to the church the prophet said stand still and look to his promise that's my message to you church stand still and look to this listen think about this a minute we serve a god who turns water to wine that's pretty good well brother daryl he only did that one time well how many times do you have to do it before you believe it he showed us he could and the guy at the wedding whatever they call the guy he got up and said hey everybody be still i got something i want to say usually you go to weddings they serve the good wine first and then when everybody gets drunk they bring out the cheap one but this man here he has saved the best wine for last i have never tasted wine like this i'll tell you why because they never been wine made like that oh we served a god who turned just thinking oh my that just makes my heart swell i'm talking about my daddy he turned water into wine rain into sunshine fear into peace death into life sickness into health darkness into light sorrow into joy sinners in the saints that's my god then when we lay down at night to sleep our sleep can be sweet because our confidence is not an appeal it's not in a pillow it's not in that soft music that you turn on beside the bed but our sleep can be sweet because our confidence is in the god who promised to keep us he has given us his word and that word will not fail because god can't fail and god is his word i saw a video the other day and then i saw another news article just the other day of a church up in west virginia that burnt to the ground it was so hot the firemen couldn't even get near it to put it out they had to pull back and let it burn and when the church burnt to the ground and it cooled down they went in everything in the church was destroyed but the bible's i saw a video of a man he went off the road hit a telephone pole his car bursted into flames and burned to the point the tires blew out and when they finally got the car out on the dash of the car was the bible and the man picked it up it was just singed on the outside and he opened it up and that was the pages feeling religious right now that word that word can not fail he give us the confidence in his word amen and that word cannot fail when you go through the water it shall overtake thee i believe the bible said when you pass through the fire it shall the smoke won't even come upon you what is he saying why because that word that word that can withstand a car car fire that word that can withstand the church fire that word is in me he gives us this confidence in his word peace peace i leave with you my peace give unto you my peace give i unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your hearts be troubled neither let it be afraid isaiah 41 13 for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not for i will help thee thank you i will help thee you remember talking about billy paul he wanted some water and he said son i'm so tired just get up and go get you some water and he said the angel said go with your son and he said i got up out of bed and went over to where billy paul was and took him by the hand said we had took a few steps but he stepped on that rug going into the kitchen and his feet slid up from under him and he said if i hadn't been there he would have failed but the angel of the lord told me to go to my son and he was holding the little boy in his right hand oh hallelujah i'm so glad i'm so glad that daddy has got a hold of my right hand and he said i will be your help in a slippery time in a slippery slopely time don't worry son i've got a hold of you running without passes through the water i will be with thee and through the rivers i shall not overflow thee and when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flames kindle upon thee isaiah 41 10 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness [Music] oh i remember a few years ago jessica she's about six-year-olds about three years after the accident was going through the church parking lot one night i might have totally heard before i've told it many places was coming through the lower parking lot brother david you know how the church is you got that upper parking lot and you come around that circle to the lord we was walking in the lower parking lot she was beside me there's a car come down out of the flip when it made the curve i saw the headlights i said jessica there's a car coming honey you know what she done a little six-year-old girl she took her finger stuck it right in my pocket how that made my heart melt yeah so she took her little finger stuck it right in my pocket and she drawn up real close to me you know why cause i was her protection she knew i would keep her from that car she wasn't afraid because she was right beside her daddy and when she done that you know what i did when she done that my i don't i i'm soft-hearted i cry i'm sorry but i always believed god squeezed the man's heart and the juice comes out of his eyes but when she pulled up next to me like what i did next i immediately put my arm around her thank you oh if you're scared this morning if you're nervous this morning you're not sure what you're going to do this morning why don't you do what jessica did why don't you just take your finger and slip it in the pocket of jehovah and let him hallelujah let him cover you with his wings isaiah 47 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee and judgment shall be condemned this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and the righteousness is of me saith the lord matthew 11 28 come unto me all of you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep live little bright don't you worry don't you fear right here by your side hallelujah when you're elias down to sleep be not afraid do not fear for thy sleep shall be sweet not because of a sleeping pill but because god is our confidence that he will not fail us david said the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he restoreth my soul yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil thyroid and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemy spiritual food and due season thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over you see i'm drinking for my saucer because my cup is overflowing surely mercy and goodness mercy and goodness mercy and goodness shall follow me how long not just to the pandemic kids come on how long mercy and goodness shall follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever don't worry about all these things friend well brother now what do you reckon is going to happen i don't know i don't know what tomorrow holds i don't know about the election i'm not worried about the election i just know who holds tomorrow when i was looking at these scriptures what's more that come to my mind about jesus on the boat think about this for a minute i got to thinking about it again and i was jotting these notes down about the great storm you know jesus i think i preached it the last time i was here he's in the ship and he come down there just think about this he knew the storm was coming he knew it would be a category five whatever a great storm we say category five just to try to understand it a major storm a major hurricane he knew the sails would be tore he knew the boat would fill with water he knew the oars would break he knew peter would not be able to handle the storm he knew the disciples will be frantic and running around he knew every bit of that and the bible says he found a place on the boat to go to sleep [Music] i wonder how many of you if the spring river was to come out of its banks this afternoon and a major flood comes striking through this how many of you would go home and take a nap come on think about it he laid down oh but brother daryl he was the word well who are you that was god in flesh well if you've got the holy ghost who are you don't live beneath your privileged friends it's time we realize who we are it's time we recognize not just who's with us but who's in us he lays down and he goes to sleep because he knew the word of god will not fail when thou liest down to sleep be not afraid and your sleep shall be sweet for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken there's a lot of people being washed away right now a lot of people have been caught up in this madness right now a lot of people walking away from the message people we never thought would have ever left come on somebody but just remember he promised you thy foot shall not be taken you will not lose your foothold because we're not standing on sink and saying hallelujah we're standing we're feasting we're eating upon the unfailing word body of the son of man and you are what you eat we're taking in the vitamins of the word vitamin a for alpha vitamin b for believe vitamin c for christ vitamin d for deity vitamin e for eternity we are taking in the vitamins of his word that'll change our very bodies the lord shall be thy confidence though a host and camp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire of his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ he never brought us this far to leave us he never built a home in us to move away he never lifted us up to let us down he never taught us to swim to let us drowned he has started this work in me nothing will stop him from finishing his masterpiece because you see my brother my sister god don't make no junk all right come on like ruth resting i'm closing like roof resting we're waiting on our lord he finished the work in calvary when he said it is finished now we can have confidence that the work has been done our redemption has been secured but like ruth we're resting we're resting we're waiting on our lord we're waiting on our lord before he comes to take us home what did he do he went to prepare a place for us and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am shall you be also let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it wasn't so i would have told you but i'll go and prepare a place for you where i am how should you be also listen just just let me look at this and we'll close there's no peace to a troubled heart there's no peace to a sinful heart there cannot be peace if a man longs to drink he calls that life he thinks he's having a big time but it actually shows he's empty he's empty like the women that was coming down there in canada coming down the hotel room brother madam said they was in there underneath garments and they were drinking and one of them kicked up their leg and said whoopee this is life and he said i stepped out and said no that's death they work to get a million it doesn't satisfy they try to get two million they might have a million dollars in his hand dead million in his hand and he lays down at night with a drunken stew on him and he wakes up the next morning haunted with nightmares and a troubled mind and you call that peace because they think their peace comes from wealth and fame and a nice home if you've got a nice home thank god for it you got a nice car thank god for it but my peace my security does not come from my house nor my car people strive so hard they work so hard to have that people women will defile their bodies and everything else to get a position in hollywood to be in movies trying to be rich trying to be famous come on somebody you know it's the truth trying to be rich trying to be famous they think that brings peace they think that brings security if it does why do they hang their self in hotel rooms because it doesn't bring anything but emptiness amen you don't have to worry about losing a million dollars in the stock market if you ain't got a million dollars in it i don't have to check the stock market come they on it peace that's not peace it isn't empty but a man may not even have a pillar to press his head to he may not even own a decent pair of shoes or be able to have a decent meal in this house but if god raised in his heart he goes to bed happy and wakes up happy it's a lasting peace it's something that god does because our confidence is in the lord think about it the bible said jesus didn't have a place to lay his head all right the foxes have burrows the birds have nests but i the son of man have no place to lay my head and yet he was had such peace confidence in knowing he was the word such confidence he said destroy this temple in three days i raised it up because his confidence was in the god who made the promise the clock is ticking away now about two minutes till midnight the omnipotence is speaking angels are appearing prophets are coming prophets are prophesying visions are being poured out upon you the gospels being preached the six being raised up the blind sees the deaf hears devils are raging impersonators jabbas and jamborees devils are raging impersonators james and jeffries are here but omnipotent speaks hallelujah we are in the last day we are at a junction of time these things are happening just to show us where we're at they're happening to let you see this message is right that when we lay down the sleep we can have this confidence that everything god said through that prophet he will perform in his bride and the final voice to the final age will be god speaking through his bread listen to this you believe with all your heart lady you believe you believe god sent me here to help you you got heart trouble for one thing you're real nervous i see you trying to get up at night you can't sleep just roll around in the bed sleepless isn't that right that's exactly right go home now you're going to sleep tonight jesus christ makes you well have faith believe with all your heart you there with insomnia that can't sleep you believe god makes you well then you can have the same thing all that believes jesus christ is here and has healed you regardless of what's wrong with you stand on your feet and raise your hands and praise him in jesus name amen maybe all these things that's happening for him has got you upset maybe you're fearful you maybe got your eyes on the problem instead of the promise but i want you to know this morning he is our peace in him is rest in him there's security just give him those fears you're his child he'll take care of you he'll take care of the bible say cast all of your cares upon him for he cares for you he even cares for your sleep think of it this morning think of it brother joe come sister come think of it this morning as long as you hold that fear as long as you hold that anxiety in your hand it'll always be yours a fear of missing the rapture a fear of getting cancer a fear of your husband dying and leaving you alone the fear of your wife dying and leaving you to raise the kids a fear of covet a fear of cancer a fear of whatever but as long as you hold those things in your hands they're yours you'll always have it all right but you remember the little boy problem said he played hooky from school and he's down on the riverbank playing play and while jesus was was preaching the gospel and the disciples went to the lord he said lord people are hungry they've been out here for several days send them into the village that they can eat and jesus said go amongst them and find something to feed them with yeah they go among all the people looking for some food and they come up on this little boy and he's got a bag is it what you got in the bag little boy is this my lunch it's five pieces of bread and two fish just enough for a little boy it's my lunch don't tell my mom i played hooky and i heard the noise come here see what was going on you know just and peter might have said to him son will you give it to the lord what's jesus want with my lunch he wants to feed this multitude jesus wants to feed this multitude with my lunch yeah well it ain't much but if jesus can use it i'll give it to him and when he gave the lord his little lunch jesus blessed it and fed 5 000 people as my memory serves me right one place i think it says 12 another says 10 10 or 12 basketfuls of leftover i'll tell you right now that's a pot lick like brother ruby used to call that's a pot licker right there come on they fed 5 000 people and have 12 baskets left over the boy goes home sets his lunch up on the counter his mama said honey didn't you eat your lunch oh mama did i eat i had wonder bread i had wonder bread today mama but he gave it to the lord just look what he was able to do with him that fear that nervousness that anxiety that depression whatever it would be i was looking the other day they talked about an all-time high of suicides and depression divorced at an all-time high because of the pandemic in people that's under such pressure under such burden under such fear because of uncertainty don't know if you're going to go to walmart and get to colbit or not you know you get milk then covered you know you just don't know so people are nervous and they're maybe not so much in this area but up to where we was at it was up to a thousand cases a day a thousand new cases a day people were afraid to go anywhere people wearing masks people wearing gloves still getting the virus with masking gloves on people scared fear anxiety but as long as that's in your hand friend you'll take it right out of this service this morning with you but if i was you you know what i do i do like that little boy i just simply give it to jesus this morning hallelujah [Music] when my daughter was hurt she was on life support [Music] i went to a window i said lord my daughter's hurt real bad there's nothing i can do to help her lord i can't help her she displays her [Music] i said lord i give her to you if you take her life i love you as much as i ever loved you i'll preach as hard as i ever preach i said the lord if you'll let my baby live i'll do my best to tell the world what you did for her a few years later i was at walmart running to brother louis he's a song leader up at home there he used to have a little debbie cake route and so he picked up the ones out of date he would give them to us you know the people in the church to eat they were still good they just couldn't sell them they were out of date she said come out to the truck i got some little debbie that's why we all look like we do up here it's louie's fault he said come out to the truck i got some some cakes for the kids and i'll go out there and brother branham's preaching on the tape and he said to joseph yosemite and abraham said when they when joseph gave moses to god then god gave moses back to yosemite and the voice spoke to me and said because you gave me jessica i gave jessica back to you [Music] oh just give him you see i gave him a broken girl i gave him a girl on life support i gave him a girl with three quarters of her brain damaged from an accident a broken leg torn lungs shocked kidneys that's what i gave him but he gave me back a girl who could see a girl who could walk a girl who can talk give him that fear give him that anxiety give him that thing that troubles you and let him give you peace let him give you peace tonight do you love him let's bow our heads this morning amen amen heavenly father lord god i believe thy word is true thank you dear god that you care so much about us lord that even when we lay down to sleep lord over and over here in the message we sow where you spoke out under discernment through your prophet told the people go home have a good night's sleep because you care god and oh father not today lord maybe there's some here that's nervous maybe they're depressed god maybe things hadn't went the way they wanted them to and it's got them down they come to church but they sat under this burden they said under this cloud lord they seem like they just can't raise their hands it seems like they just can't get into the service but oh god may they give that to you this morning lord lord when i had jessica all i had was a broken child but when i gave her to you lord i just standed amazed at what she was able to do the lord made these people this morning just a simple broke up thought lord but

myself my confidence is not in my my work my my business but it's in you lord my confidence is in your word that you will bring me safely through if you're here this morning i just wonder if you just stand to your feet and say lord i just give it to you this morning i just simply give it to you like that little boy oh the prophet said just give it to him one time just give it to him and just see what he's able to do oh lord you see those that are standing almost almost half the church standing this morning god oh father just raise your hand to him now will you say lord i give this to you
