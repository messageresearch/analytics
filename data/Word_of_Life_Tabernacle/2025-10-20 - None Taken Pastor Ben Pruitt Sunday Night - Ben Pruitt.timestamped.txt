[39:33] our fall festival and he was going
[39:35] overseas, but it didn't work out. And
[39:37] so, he's going to be here. So, maybe the
[39:39] Lord set that up. I know some of the
[39:40] brothers are going to be hunting, and
[39:41] that's okay. I uh I just pray the Lord
[39:45] blesses them with uh good time. I'm
[39:47] going to go down to Hot Springs for a
[39:49] couple days, but I'll be back by
[39:50] Wednesday night. And if you need
[39:52] anything, we'll sure be here for you. Do
[39:55] you love the Lord this afternoon?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mark chapter 7 verse 24.
[40:01] Maybe a little bit of an odd title
[40:02] tonight and subject, but I just pray
[40:04] it'll be a blessing to you. I want to
[40:06] speak to you tonight on none taken.
[40:09] Mark 7:24.
[40:11] From then he arose and went into the
[40:13] borders of Ty and Sidon and entered into
[40:15] a house. and would have no man know it,
[40:18] but he could not be hid. I I've always
[40:21] loved that scripture. He could not be
[40:23] hid. For a certain woman whose young
[40:26] daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of
[40:28] him and came and fell at his feet. The
[40:32] woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by
[40:34] nation, and she besought him that he
[40:36] would cast forth the devil out of her
[40:38] daughter. It' be like somebody coming up
[40:41] for prayer. But Jesus said unto her,
[40:44] "Let the children first be filled, for
[40:47] it is not meat to take the children's
[40:49] bread." In other words, he said, "It's
[40:50] not appropriate to take the children's
[40:52] bread to cast it to the dogs."
[40:55] And she answered and said unto him,
[40:57] "Yes, Lord.
[41:00] Yes, Lord." What a response.
[41:02] "Yet the dogs under the table eat of the
[41:06] children's crumbs." Yeah,
[41:11] &gt;&gt; what an attitude. He said unto her, for
[41:13] this saying, go thy way, the devil has
[41:17] gone out of thy daughter. When she was
[41:19] come to her house, she found the devil
[41:21] gone out, and her daughter laid upon the
[41:24] bed. I pray the Lord about his blessing
[41:25] to the word. You may be seated.
[41:29] Uh,
[41:31] I was reminded as well, Katherine and
[41:33] Isaac are in the hospital with baby
[41:36] Aurora was born a little bit early. So,
[41:38] let's be praying for them as well for
[41:40] that little family and that's a new
[41:42] member of the church. So,
[41:44] congratulations to them and let's be
[41:45] praying for them that they'll uh quickly
[41:48] recover, be able to be back in the house
[41:51] of the Lord.
[41:54] It used to be common, and I guess it
[41:55] still is, to say if someone said
[41:58] something hurtful to someone that you'd
[42:00] say, "No offense."
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Right? No offense, but,
[42:05] right? And then you'd finish whatever
[42:08] your thought was. No offense, but. And
[42:11] that used to be a common thing to say.
[42:13] And you know, the response to that, if
[42:16] you weren't going to be offended, is to
[42:19] say, "None, none taken.
[42:22] No offense, none taken. And and we live
[42:25] in a generation of people who who live
[42:27] in a constant state of being offended.
[42:30] It's just it's just my my generation. I
[42:32] could say maybe younger than me. We all
[42:34] like to think the younger people are
[42:35] worse, but but but it's the generation
[42:39] of people who just live in that. It's
[42:41] called today being woke, right? Being
[42:44] woke. You've heard that term. It's being
[42:45] awoke is you're you're woke to political
[42:49] uh leftism really, but it's a you know
[42:51] and and a lot of those people in that
[42:53] condition there are or have been
[42:54] afflicted by that condition. They uh
[42:58] they they they use words like
[42:59] microaggressions or subconscious
[43:02] discrimination and and which we didn't
[43:05] even know what that was when I was a
[43:07] kid. We had real aggression and real
[43:10] discrimination. But
[43:12] &gt;&gt; but but now it's it's become a thing and
[43:14] and it's treated as real things and and
[43:18] it really means something to people and
[43:20] words are seen as a form of violence.
[43:22] And so there's people who believe, we
[43:24] saw that with the assassination of
[43:25] Charlie Kirk, that they believe that you
[43:27] can respond to words with real violence,
[43:30] that they believe it's appropriate to
[43:32] kill somebody for what they say.
[43:35] And you know, it's not always been that
[43:38] way. Children in the late 1800s were
[43:40] taught a schoolyard rhyme, "Sticks and
[43:42] stones may break my bones, but words
[43:44] will never hurt me." And yet, we know
[43:48] that's not entirely true. It's probably
[43:50] a good thing to teach your children. And
[43:52] yet, it's not entirely true because
[43:54] words do hurt sometimes.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; That's just the reality of it. It does
[43:59] hurt. And the Bible says the words of a
[44:02] tail bearer are as wounds. So in other
[44:05] words, somebody who would go and gossip
[44:06] to people and and and even if it's true,
[44:11] right? Do you re people realize that
[44:13] that by saying things to people that
[44:16] something they don't have any business
[44:18] saying and and and they say it anyway
[44:21] and it's like a wound and it goes down
[44:23] in the innermost parts of the belly.
[44:27] Again, in Proverbs 18:14, in that same
[44:30] chapter, Solomon says, "The spirit of a
[44:32] man will sustain his infirmity." In
[44:35] other words, if you're sick, brother
[44:37] Walt, if you if you don't feel well or
[44:38] maybe you've gone through something like
[44:39] what you've went through, your spirit
[44:41] sustains you. It'll keep you going. But
[44:43] he said, "A wounded spirit, who can
[44:45] bear?" So, if your spirit gets wounded,
[44:48] the thing that would sustain you through
[44:50] sickness, you have a difficult time
[44:53] making it through it, right? So it's
[44:55] harder to deal with a wounded spirit
[44:56] than a wounded body. In Proverbs 18 and
[44:59] 19, it says, "A brother offended is
[45:02] harder to be one than a strong city."
[45:05] And their contentions are like the bars
[45:08] of a castle. But that same chapter says
[45:11] this, and I love it. Proverbs 18:10,
[45:13] "The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[45:16] The righteous runth into it and is
[45:18] safe." I would say to you that if you do
[45:21] I if you are wounded by words that you
[45:23] can run to the Lord and he'll always be
[45:26] there for you. There will always be
[45:28] comfort in the word of God in the spirit
[45:30] of God for you.
[45:33] I've heard this all of my life but I
[45:34] didn't realize where it come from. There
[45:35] was a poem written or pros I believe
[45:38] that it was written by Carl Sandberg
[45:41] back maybe many years ago and it was
[45:44] about a little girl who saw our first
[45:46] troop parade and she asked what are
[45:48] those and and and and the one that was
[45:50] standing there with her said soldiers
[45:52] and she said what are soldiers they're
[45:54] for war they fight and each tries to
[45:57] kill as many the other side as he can
[45:58] and the girl held still and thought
[46:00] about it and said do you know I know
[46:03] something he said what is it that you
[46:05] know sometime they'll give a war and
[46:07] nobody will come.
[46:10] Wouldn't that be something if they had a
[46:12] war and just nobody would come? And I
[46:15] want us to think about that tonight. And
[46:16] and I want to stir your imagination
[46:18] tonight and stir your thinking or those
[46:20] of you that are here, those of you that
[46:22] are watching. I want to stir this up in
[46:24] you that what if we refuse to be
[46:26] offended?
[46:31] You realize how much freedom there would
[46:32] be in that
[46:34] &gt;&gt; if we refuse to be offended. Now, we
[46:36] know as Christians, we should not give
[46:38] offense,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; right? We we should not be we should not
[46:42] purposely offend people. Romans 12:18
[46:45] says, "If it's possible, as much as lith
[46:47] in you, live peaceibly with all men."
[46:49] So, we should do everything we can not
[46:52] to offend.
[46:54] and and and so that should be our our
[46:55] manner of life, our lifestyle and in
[46:57] love for others and consideration of one
[47:00] another. Paul says to the weak became I
[47:02] as weak that I might gain the weak. So
[47:04] in other words, I don't I don't just go
[47:05] out saying whatever I want to say. I I
[47:08] season my words with salt so that people
[47:10] will know and and yet at times we
[47:12] inadvertently offend people, but we
[47:14] don't mean to. And and and so he said,
[47:16] "I made all things to all men that I
[47:18] might by all means save some." So we
[47:21] don't want to offend people when we
[47:23] think of offense. Many times we think of
[47:25] Jesus when he makes a statement about
[47:28] the children and he said it's better to
[47:29] have a millstone tied around your neck.
[47:31] You know the story and cast into the sea
[47:34] than to offend one of the little ones.
[47:36] But that word offend in the New
[47:37] Testament is doesn't mean to to to hurt
[47:40] your feelings. Did you know that? It
[47:42] doesn't mean to hurt your feelings. What
[47:44] that means is to cause to stumble or
[47:46] fall. And I pray that Lord help me never
[47:49] to cause a little one to stumble or to
[47:51] fall because he said it'd be better and
[47:53] it could be with your words. It could be
[47:55] with your actions. It could be some
[47:56] other way. It would be better to it'd be
[47:59] better to have a millstone put around
[48:01] your neck and thrown in the depths of
[48:03] the sea than to offend one of the little
[48:05] ones. Brandon made this prayer and it's
[48:08] very interesting where he's praying
[48:10] this. He's speaking and the message
[48:12] leadership which is the last real sermon
[48:13] that he preached while he was alive and
[48:16] he's preaching leadership and and and as
[48:18] he's preaching that he's preaching it in
[48:21] a uh in a trailer park and and some of
[48:24] you all that know message history, you
[48:26] know that that trailer park turned into
[48:29] a horrible thing. It actually turned
[48:31] into a I don't think we're bismerching
[48:34] anybody's character. It's been a long
[48:35] time ago now. But but there there was
[48:37] the leadership in that trailer park went
[48:39] haywire after brother Brandham died and
[48:41] it did some horrible things to those
[48:43] children
[48:44] &gt;&gt; that were there. There are survivors of
[48:46] that today that made it through that
[48:48] time and some that didn't make it and
[48:50] and left the message over it. But
[48:53] brother Brandon prayed during that time.
[48:55] He said, "Oh dear God," he he's sitting
[48:57] there and one of the questions I always
[48:59] had is, "Brother Brandon, why didn't you
[49:00] stop it? You're a prophet." But see, God
[49:02] don't show his prophets everything. But
[49:05] I do believe the Holy Spirit spoke to
[49:07] those men that were there that caused
[49:09] the offense. He said, "Oh dear God,
[49:11] creator of heavens and earth, guide our
[49:12] feet, Lord, that we'll not do nothing
[49:15] before these little ones that would put
[49:17] a stumbling block in their way. For it
[49:20] said, it would be better we have a
[49:21] millstone tied at our neck and be cast
[49:23] into the sea than to offend one of these
[49:26] little ones. You said their angels
[49:28] always behold my father's face which is
[49:30] in heaven. The great angel, guardian
[49:32] angel over each of these little souls. I
[49:35] believe God was speaking to those men,
[49:37] warning them. And yet the men sitting
[49:39] there in leadership caused great offense
[49:41] to the little ones in their care. I
[49:43] don't want to ever do that. I want to
[49:44] help somebody down the road. Don't you
[49:46] don't you want to help somebody instead
[49:48] of hurting somebody in our in our
[49:49] thoughts, in our speech, in in our
[49:52] actions, everything that we do, we want
[49:54] to be aware of what we're doing and help
[49:56] somebody on down the road.
[49:59] And so the Bible says, "As we have
[50:01] opportunity, let us do good unto all
[50:03] men, especially to them of the household
[50:06] of faith. But what if we chose not to be
[50:10] offended?"
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this for a minute. But
[50:14] what if we chose not to be offended in
[50:16] marriage?
[50:19] What if we just chose not to be
[50:20] offended? In 1 Peter chapter 4 and verse
[50:24] 8, it says, "Above all things, have
[50:27] fervent charity among yourselves."
[50:30] That's love. For charity, love shall
[50:33] cover the multitude of sins.
[50:37] Love covers a multitude of sins. What if
[50:40] we just decided that we weren't going to
[50:43] be offended by our spouse?
[50:47] I told you this morning, somebody told
[50:49] me and said, "Well, you don't understand
[50:51] cuz you've always had a good marriage."
[50:52] And that's, you know, I have always had
[50:54] a good marriage, but it's because of the
[50:56] work we put into it,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; right? Those opportunities are there
[51:02] because I have bad breath, too,
[51:05] &gt;&gt; right? And I don't always pick up after
[51:07] myself. Come on, guys. You You know what
[51:10] I'm talking about, right? I don't always
[51:12] do what I should do. I'm grouchy on
[51:16] Mondays. Sometimes on Thursdays,
[51:19] a little bit the rest of the week.
[51:24] I sometimes don't give my family the
[51:26] thought or the time that I should. I'm
[51:28] not saying I'm a bad person. I'm just
[51:30] like you. I'm human being.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; I try to live the word, but I I I mess
[51:34] up sometimes. And and yet, you know,
[51:37] we've reached a place after 20 years,
[51:39] it'll be 20 years in May of marriage
[51:40] that, you know, it's just it's like
[51:42] we're just not going to be offended at
[51:44] each other cuz we don't have the energy
[51:46] anymore
[51:48] &gt;&gt; to fight.
[51:51] Does that make sense? Yeah.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Like I just choose not to be offended
[51:55] and she chooses not to be offended and
[51:57] and we get along pretty good that way
[52:00] &gt;&gt; even though sometimes but what that does
[52:02] is it frees us to allow us to say true
[52:05] things to each other
[52:07] &gt;&gt; knowing the other person's not going to
[52:08] take it wrong
[52:10] &gt;&gt; because some things need to be said.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Right? And yet I know she trusts me. In
[52:17] the scripture it talks in Proverbs 31
[52:19] about a virtuous woman. You've all read
[52:21] it. We preach from it and it talks about
[52:23] the virtuous woman. It says the heart of
[52:25] her husband does safely trust her.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; The heart of her husband does safely
[52:32] trust her. What's he saying? He's saying
[52:34] that they built this unspoken uh bond
[52:38] between them that they know that if they
[52:41] didn't always have tabs on each other or
[52:43] life 360 went down or they weren't able,
[52:46] they still wouldn't worry because they
[52:48] would know that that that person's going
[52:50] to be okay. They're not going to do
[52:52] anything to hurt them. And if they did
[52:53] anything that would be wrong, it would
[52:55] be a mistake. It would be they wouldn't
[52:57] mean to do it because they trust the
[52:58] person the heart of her husband safely.
[53:01] Trust her with finances. trust her with
[53:03] all the other parts of a marriage. And
[53:05] that's the place that we've got to get
[53:06] to. If you want to get to a marriage
[53:08] that you don't fight, you if you're
[53:11] never going to get to a place where you
[53:12] don't offend people, but you got to get
[53:14] to a place where you don't you're you
[53:16] cannot be offended.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And we or rather I should say it this
[53:20] way where you don't where you refuse to
[53:22] be offended.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; That's hard, isn't it? It's a tough
[53:29] place to get to.
[53:31] Yeah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Right now, before
[53:33] you're married, now I'm going to talk to
[53:34] those of you, there's only like four of
[53:35] them in here, but the people that are
[53:38] old enough to be married or just about
[53:42] and yet you're not married yet." He
[53:44] said, "Now, right now, before you're
[53:45] married, everything's just fine and
[53:46] dandy. Ryan, if you ever if you get
[53:48] married, when you get married, you know,
[53:50] when you meet somebody, everything's
[53:51] fine and dandy for a while,
[53:54] right? And boy, it's just wonderful and
[53:56] you just love one another and
[53:58] everything's going good. But after you
[53:59] get married, I sent this to my kids on
[54:01] Thursday when I was studying this. He
[54:03] said, "After you get married, then the
[54:05] toils and trials of life come in,
[54:08] right? The the day you get married,
[54:10] things change and then you got a little
[54:12] honeymoon period lasts for a little
[54:14] while and then you wake up and realize
[54:16] that love's not a feeling anymore. It's
[54:19] a commitment."
[54:21] Brother Brandham said that's when you've
[54:22] got to be so in love that you understand
[54:25] one another. When you're disappointed in
[54:28] her and she's disappointed in you, you
[54:31] still understand one another.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I
[54:36] have some things in my house that are
[54:38] breakable and valuable.
[54:41] And they're not like worth a lot of
[54:43] money,
[54:45] but my wife's having a heart attack
[54:47] right now
[54:51] because I'm holding this.
[54:54] I thought I'd give it to Jonah, but I
[54:55] don't know if he's awake. But he's
[54:58] asleep. They didn't carry it around.
[55:00] Then you all would have a heart attack.
[55:01] This is a hundred-year-old bowl.
[55:05] It's a hundred years old. It's lasted a
[55:07] hundred years. Not because it's not
[55:09] breakable, because if I dropped it right
[55:11] now,
[55:15] it would it would break,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; right? It would break. This floor's
[55:21] concrete under that little thin carpet
[55:24] and it would break.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; It's valuable. How's it lasted a hundred
[55:27] years?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Because people took care of it.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; It's It's in a place in our house where
[55:35] the kids can't get to it. And it's up in
[55:36] the, you know, and yet we've had pieces
[55:39] get broken, but it's up there in a place
[55:42] where, you know, I'm not doing this on a
[55:44] regular basis or I would break a piece,
[55:48] right?
[55:50] See the difference in adults and
[55:52] children is that adults treat valuable
[55:55] things as valuable
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and children teach valuable breakable
[56:01] things as if they're not and just kind
[56:03] of
[56:07] is this stupid? I I don't know how
[56:14] somebody said yes it is.
[56:18] But think about it. It's a hundred years
[56:20] old. Like it is valuable. And I can, you
[56:23] know,
[56:24] but I'm doing that on purpose.
[56:27] That's the way we treat our marriages.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; We just get offended and and pull apart,
[56:36] get mad, you know, walk away and just
[56:44] and it's a valuable thing.
[56:46] You realize how precious my wife's dying
[56:48] back there. You realize how precious
[56:51] that is, huh? Your marriage is much more
[56:54] precious than that is. I wouldn't take
[56:56] that chance with my marriage.
[56:59] I
[56:59] &gt;&gt; wouldn't take that chance with something
[57:00] I really cared about.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:05] &gt;&gt; And yet, we just say things and do
[57:06] things and just throw it up in the air
[57:08] and use it like it like we're ski
[57:10] shooting.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Just throw it up there and shoot at it.
[57:14] see if there's any holes in it. And then
[57:16] when it breaks,
[57:18] we come to the pastor and say, "Put it
[57:20] together."
[57:23] &gt;&gt; But how you going to put it together?
[57:26] I'll say this. If it is broken, I know
[57:28] somebody who can fix it.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; See, Brother Brandham taught us that I
[57:33] don't know why I'm spending so much time
[57:34] on this tonight, but Brother Brandham
[57:35] taught us that there was a a bowl of
[57:37] oil. He said, "Love is like a bowl of
[57:39] golden a golden bowl full of oil in your
[57:41] heart." and and he said that if it ever
[57:45] gets broken, it's very difficult to
[57:47] repair,
[57:49] right? It's very difficult to put that
[57:51] trust put that oil back in the bowl. But
[57:53] I heard of and you've heard of it. I I
[57:55] think we've had ministers that have used
[57:56] it as an illustration, but I heard of a
[57:59] of a Japanese process that they use
[58:00] where they actually pour gold in the
[58:02] cracks and they make the bowl more
[58:04] valuable than what it was before. I
[58:06] believe God can do that tonight. I
[58:08] believe we serve that kind of a God that
[58:10] if you've treated things that way when
[58:12] you grow up and learn how to treat
[58:14] things like they ought to be treated,
[58:16] then you God can put you back together.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; He can do that for you. I believe he can
[58:21] make it more valuable than it ever was,
[58:22] more precious than it ever was. But if
[58:24] we're going to grow up, and I mean this
[58:26] in a spiritual sense as well, if we're
[58:28] going to be what God has called us to
[58:30] be, let's treat the word of God
[58:32] valuable. Let's handle it in the way
[58:34] that it ought to be handled. Let's treat
[58:36] our marriages valuable. Let's treat our
[58:37] families valuable.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Children don't understand the value of
[58:44] breakable things, but adults ought to.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; What did the angel tell brother
[58:49] Brandham? See, he told they told him, he
[58:52] said, "Get the people to believe you and
[58:54] they'll be healed." You realize what you
[58:55] have to do? How do you heal your home?
[58:57] You got to get your wife to believe you.
[58:59] You got to get your husband to believe
[59:01] you. It's how you heal that. And faith
[59:04] in that person will cause you to
[59:06] interpret things differently, cause you
[59:08] to say, "No offense." None take it.
[59:12] Are you with me? Are you following me
[59:14] now?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Right? If you treat that as precious,
[59:17] see the Senician woman, she treated her
[59:19] the healing of her daughter as more
[59:21] important than whatever Jesus might say
[59:23] to her, how he might offend her, how it
[59:25] might be hard and might be difficult,
[59:27] but the healing of her daughter
[59:28] mattered.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; So what did she do? She overlooked the
[59:31] offense because her daughter's healing
[59:33] was important to her
[59:37] and she got what she asked for.
[59:40] I I think what what if we parents let's
[59:42] let's get off of marriage for a while.
[59:44] What if we parents chose not to be
[59:46] offended or what if we what if we as
[59:49] children of parents let's put it like
[59:51] this. What if we chose not to be
[59:52] offended in our parents?
[59:56] Boy, it got quiet.
[59:58] There are evil parents,
[1:00:01] evil spouses, but most aren't. Most are
[1:00:03] just humans.
[1:00:05] Most are just humans. The Bible says we
[1:00:07] had fathers of our flesh which corrected
[1:00:09] us. So, we gave them reverence.
[1:00:12] We gave them reverence. That word
[1:00:13] reverence is we honored them.
[1:00:17] I have a newspaper clipping where can
[1:00:20] can you hang with me for just a little
[1:00:22] while tonight? I promise I'm not going
[1:00:23] to bore you to death and keep you all
[1:00:25] day. I'll let you go.
[1:00:27] But thank you for being here this
[1:00:28] afternoon. I I have a newspaper clipping
[1:00:31] where brother Brandham's mother applies
[1:00:32] to the county for food
[1:00:35] because her husband Charles had been
[1:00:37] arrested for operating a steel.
[1:00:41] Like that's old timey stuff right there.
[1:00:45] But he had been arrested for operating a
[1:00:47] steel. He's in jail. Brother Brandham's
[1:00:50] laying in the hospital with a gunshot
[1:00:51] wound.
[1:00:53] And he was the oldest boy and he was
[1:00:55] unable to work.
[1:00:57] So, the kids were starving.
[1:01:00] And it's the man's fault. It's Charles's
[1:01:03] fault. It's Brother Brandham's dad's
[1:01:04] fault for doing that.
[1:01:07] He He's done everything wrong. He's
[1:01:11] sitting in jail. His his mother has
[1:01:13] nothing to eat. And And this is the same
[1:01:16] man, you remember brother Brandham's
[1:01:17] life story where we talked about this
[1:01:19] man, how he called him a He said,
[1:01:21] "I only raised one sissy." Only knew one
[1:01:23] Brandham that was a that was his
[1:01:26] own son. He was trying to get him to
[1:01:27] drink. That that still happens today.
[1:01:30] Some of y'all I I know I I've had people
[1:01:32] tell me it's heartbreaking. My mama
[1:01:34] taught me to do drugs. My daddy taught
[1:01:36] me to drink. It's a heartbreaking thing.
[1:01:38] Aren't you glad you can raised your kids
[1:01:40] in the house of the Lord and bring them
[1:01:42] to God and and and and have the
[1:01:44] availability of that? Listen, if you got
[1:01:46] a parent that took you to church, they
[1:01:48] might have been an awful parent in every
[1:01:50] other way, but if they took you to
[1:01:51] church, you ought to be thankful for
[1:01:52] that because it may be why you're in the
[1:01:54] house of God today.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Well, the parents, Brother Brandham's
[1:01:58] parents never took him to church.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:02:04] they had him dedicated when he was a
[1:02:06] baby, and as far as I know, he never
[1:02:07] went back to church until he got old
[1:02:09] enough himself to go.
[1:02:11] Brother Brandham said, "Dad, he drank."
[1:02:14] He said, ' Not only drank, but he made
[1:02:15] the whiskey. When he would come in at
[1:02:17] home and drink right after he'd get his
[1:02:18] groceries all paid, he'd drink up what
[1:02:20] he had left.
[1:02:22] But I love this. Brother Brandon was
[1:02:24] standing there. You know what he said?
[1:02:25] He was an adult. He was old enough to
[1:02:27] understand. It's hard when you're
[1:02:28] younger. I've been through similar
[1:02:30] things. My dad didn't drink. He was a
[1:02:32] moral man, but we had a great difficulty
[1:02:34] with him. And and I've been through
[1:02:37] that. I know what that heartbreak's
[1:02:38] like. I I I I have experienced it. So,
[1:02:41] I'm not talking about something I don't
[1:02:42] know about. But he said, 'I don't care
[1:02:44] what he ever done. I love him today in
[1:02:45] his grave. He was my daddy. He said,
[1:02:49] 'Look, young children, young folks, I
[1:02:50] don't care what it is. You always have a
[1:02:52] respect to your father and mother. He
[1:02:54] said, I think one of the awful things I
[1:02:55] can hear little children say is the old
[1:02:57] man or old woman. Listen, that's not the
[1:02:58] old man and old woman. That's your daddy
[1:03:00] and mother. Someday when you see them
[1:03:02] going out of the room head first and the
[1:03:03] wheels beneath the casket squeaking,
[1:03:05] you'll know it is an old man or old
[1:03:07] woman then. That's right. He said, "You
[1:03:08] hear the preacher say ashes to ashes and
[1:03:10] dust to dust, you realize the best
[1:03:12] friend you ever had on earth is going
[1:03:14] down."
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Talking about, he's talking about his
[1:03:17] drunk daddy.
[1:03:20] When I was a boy, he said, "My daddy was
[1:03:22] a different from what some of the modern
[1:03:24] fathers are today. My daddy believed in
[1:03:26] giving whoopins, and he really give
[1:03:28] them." He said, "We remembered them."
[1:03:31] And I yet today of 47 years, I remember
[1:03:33] them. But it done me good. Some of us
[1:03:36] could say amen to that.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; It trained me. If I could go to the
[1:03:40] grave today and raise him up, the first
[1:03:42] thing I'd do would shake his hand and
[1:03:43] hug him for what he done.
[1:03:46] If I feel that way about my earthly
[1:03:48] father, what will it be that day when we
[1:03:51] stand in his presence?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; When we see the things happen to us for
[1:03:55] our good, he had to cut us a little bit
[1:03:57] here and child train us and take off the
[1:03:59] things of the world. Let us walk as
[1:04:01] humble children before him. May seem
[1:04:03] hard for the Gabe at the beginning, but
[1:04:05] God knows what he's doing.
[1:04:08] He knows what he's doing. How many can
[1:04:09] say amen to that tonight? He knows what
[1:04:12] he's doing.
[1:04:14] Brother Bram said, "My dear old mother,
[1:04:15] half Indian, sitting there, her hair
[1:04:16] slick back, not a gray hair in it, her
[1:04:18] little teeny deep set eyes looking at
[1:04:20] me. Looked at daddy's picture hanging on
[1:04:22] the wall." I said, "Mama," she'd come
[1:04:24] over and put her hands in mine, her poor
[1:04:26] old shaky wrinkled hand. I said, "Mama,
[1:04:28] I want to ask you a question." I said,
[1:04:30] 'What is value? What should we place
[1:04:33] value on?'
[1:04:37] She said, 'What do you mean, son?' I
[1:04:38] said, 'If I had a hund00 million laying
[1:04:40] here on this table and there was a
[1:04:42] little button here and I'd press that
[1:04:43] button and I'd lose that $100 million,
[1:04:45] but I get to talk to dad again for an
[1:04:47] hour. I said, I'd press that button
[1:04:49] right quick.
[1:04:51] What could I do with a $100 million? How
[1:04:53] could I could evangelize the world
[1:04:54] nearly myself? But I never was too sure
[1:04:56] about my daddy. He died in my arms
[1:04:59] praying, but I want a little more
[1:05:01] insurance.
[1:05:03] And how a hund00 million I'd give
[1:05:06] tonight. Easy. Never think a thing about
[1:05:08] it. Be glad to do it. Oh, he didn't say,
[1:05:10] "Oh, if I could just give him a piece of
[1:05:12] my mind." If I could just say, "Why
[1:05:13] weren't you there?" If I could just say,
[1:05:15] "Why did you have to get arrested when I
[1:05:16] was laying in the hospital? Why did you
[1:05:18] have to do that?" He He refused to take
[1:05:20] offense. What did he say? If I could
[1:05:22] just talk to him, I believe I could
[1:05:24] persuade him.
[1:05:27] Oh, God.
[1:05:30] Believe I could persuade him to follow
[1:05:31] Christ.
[1:05:34] I've often thought the same thing.
[1:05:37] If I could just have a moment, maybe I
[1:05:38] could be a help. Because I wasn't much
[1:05:41] help as a teenager. Maybe I could be a
[1:05:43] help now. Yet, those times are gone. And
[1:05:46] yet, we cut people off and lose time
[1:05:48] that we can never regain.
[1:05:55] We do not preach a gospel of cutting off
[1:05:57] your family.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; That's cult stuff.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; If you have to separate from something,
[1:06:03] separate from a spirit.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? But love your family.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; If that person, if there's a family
[1:06:10] member that's causing trouble in your
[1:06:11] home or doing something, there's steps
[1:06:12] that you have to take. But you always
[1:06:14] remember to watch for a window of
[1:06:16] reconciliation
[1:06:18] and be ready if they're ready to come
[1:06:21] back together because we don't want to
[1:06:23] cut people off
[1:06:25] because you can't get that time back.
[1:06:29] Let me move on. What if we refuse to be
[1:06:31] offended at church? Well, praise the
[1:06:33] Lord.
[1:06:35] Colossians 3:12 says, "Put on therefore
[1:06:37] as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
[1:06:39] bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness
[1:06:41] of mind, meekness, longsuffering,
[1:06:43] forbearing one another, forgiving one
[1:06:46] another. If any man have a quarrel
[1:06:48] against any, even as Christ forgave you,
[1:06:51] so also do ye."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And above all these things, put on
[1:06:55] charity, which is the bond of
[1:06:58] perfectness. What is that? The bond of
[1:07:00] maturity is love. This is what holds us
[1:07:03] together is love for one another as
[1:07:07] mature Christian sons and daughters,
[1:07:09] manifested sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:11] And let the peace of God rule in your
[1:07:13] hearts to the which also you are called
[1:07:16] in one body and be ye thankful. What if
[1:07:19] we suffered long and were kind like
[1:07:22] David leaving Jerusalem when he had
[1:07:24] rocks picked up and thrown at him and he
[1:07:26] said maybe the Lord told him to do it.
[1:07:28] What if that was our our kind of
[1:07:30] attitude that we would have when people
[1:07:32] would say something about us or do
[1:07:33] something to us that we thought was
[1:07:35] wrong? I I know we don't want to hear
[1:07:36] that. I know it's not in our human
[1:07:38] nature to do it. But what if we did?
[1:07:43] What kind of freedom might come? What
[1:07:45] kind of release might come? What kind of
[1:07:47] spirit of God might move in our services
[1:07:49] if we just say, "I will not be offended
[1:07:53] at my brother because he's my brother."
[1:07:57] Brother Brandham said, "How will the
[1:07:58] world know that you love Jesus when we
[1:08:00] love one another?" See, God sees your
[1:08:02] faith. The world sees your action.
[1:08:04] Love one another now. Be kind to one
[1:08:06] another. Talk with one another.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Does that say that?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Talk with one another. Be patient with
[1:08:15] one another.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:08:19] And you find yourself again, he said,
[1:08:21] you find yourself in love with your
[1:08:22] enemies. Somebody say, "Well, he's
[1:08:24] nothing but a holy roller." and you
[1:08:26] start to get, oh, he said, be careful.
[1:08:30] Huh? I'm not preaching something that's
[1:08:32] outside the message, church.
[1:08:34] He said, but when you really find
[1:08:36] yourself that you love him, regardless
[1:08:38] of what they do, you still love them.
[1:08:42] What are you doing? None taken.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not taking any offense.
[1:08:46] Then you beginning to find and your
[1:08:49] patience gets from about that long till
[1:08:51] it just don't have no end. Anybody just
[1:08:54] keeps saying things about you, I don't
[1:08:55] care what you say. He said, ' Don't get
[1:08:58] stirred up. If you get stirred up, you
[1:09:01] better go pray first before you talk to
[1:09:03] them again.
[1:09:05] Don't get in fusses.
[1:09:08] This is good right here. Don't like to
[1:09:11] get in fuss because brother Brandham
[1:09:13] recognizes some people just enjoy it.
[1:09:18] And brother Brand said, don't like to
[1:09:20] get in fuss.
[1:09:22] the, you know, it's a qualification for
[1:09:24] a preacher not to get in fusses. Man of
[1:09:27] God shall not strive,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; right? Don't like to get in fuss. If you
[1:09:32] like to see somebody raise up in a
[1:09:33] church, say, "You know what? I'll tell
[1:09:35] you so and so did so and so." You say,
[1:09:38] "Now, brother, shame on you."
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Well, if it's true, you
[1:09:43] can tell it."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Shame on you. If you say, "Oh, is that
[1:09:51] so?" Listen to that scandal. Watch out.
[1:09:54] The Holy Spirit is not a cesspool. No,
[1:09:56] no, no, no. The heart is occupied by the
[1:09:58] Holy Spirit. Is full of holiness,
[1:10:00] purity, thinkketh no evil, doth no evil,
[1:10:02] believeth all things, endureth
[1:10:04] longsuffering. Don't fuss. When the
[1:10:06] family gets in a fuss, don't fuss with
[1:10:08] them. Your mother said, "I ain't having
[1:10:09] you go up there to that old church
[1:10:11] anymore." Well, all you think about now
[1:10:13] letting your hair grow out. You look
[1:10:14] like some old grandma. Don't fuss with
[1:10:16] her.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "Okay, mother. It's all right. I
[1:10:20] love you just the same. And I'll be
[1:10:22] praying for you as long as I live. Don't
[1:10:26] fuss. See, temper breeds temper.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; First thing you know, you grieve the
[1:10:31] Holy Spirit away from you. You'll be
[1:10:32] fussing back. Then the Holy Spirit takes
[1:10:35] his flight. Temper breeds temper. And
[1:10:37] love breeds love. Be full of love. Amen.
[1:10:40] Jesus said, "This will all men know
[1:10:42] you're my disciples when you have love
[1:10:43] one for another." That's the fruit of
[1:10:45] the Holy Spirit is love. What if we
[1:10:48] refused to be offended by one another?
[1:10:50] Can we take it a step further? What if
[1:10:52] we refused to be offended by the word?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; I'm challenging us today. I'm
[1:11:00] challenging myself because I'm human
[1:11:03] just like you are. But what if we
[1:11:04] refused
[1:11:06] to be offended by the word? See, Jesus
[1:11:07] said, "Blessed is he whosoever shall not
[1:11:09] be offended in me. Whoever will not
[1:11:11] stumble at me, God in flesh." See, John
[1:11:15] stumbled the prophet when he was in
[1:11:17] prison and and he sent the disciples to
[1:11:20] Jesus and the same one who he said,
[1:11:21] "Behold the lamb of God who takes away
[1:11:23] the sins of the world." He sends
[1:11:25] messages to him and says, "Is it really
[1:11:26] you?
[1:11:28] Is the message really true?" Right? And
[1:11:32] Jesus never answered his question.
[1:11:33] Brother say he didn't rebuke John.
[1:11:36] He didn't say, "Oh, you're nothing. You
[1:11:37] don't you you know." And and it was a
[1:11:39] great insult to Jesus for John to say
[1:11:41] this, but Jesus didn't rebuke him. But
[1:11:44] Jesus, he didn't even answer his
[1:11:45] question. He said, "Tell John."
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. He said, "Come to the
[1:11:50] meeting and then tell John what you
[1:11:52] see." Telling the sick are being healed
[1:11:54] and the blind eyes are being opened and
[1:11:56] the lame are be are walking again. The
[1:11:58] gospel is being preached to the poor. He
[1:12:00] said, "Tell John what you see me do."
[1:12:02] See, when we are offended by the word,
[1:12:04] we are offended in Christ. We should not
[1:12:07] be offended by the word or by the word
[1:12:09] made flesh.
[1:12:11] See, because the Holy Spirit won't be
[1:12:12] offended by the word. When we get
[1:12:14] offended by the word, we're offended.
[1:12:16] We're offended by uh it's our flesh
[1:12:18] that's offended, not the Holy Spirit.
[1:12:21] Because the Holy Spirit won't be
[1:12:22] offended by the word. Brother Brand say
[1:12:23] when you ministers are correcting
[1:12:24] someone about a gift when you're
[1:12:26] correcting them, scripturally correcting
[1:12:28] them, and they get offended, remember it
[1:12:30] wasn't the spirit of God because the
[1:12:32] spirit of God cannot be, someone say it
[1:12:34] with me, cannot be offended by his word.
[1:12:38] He comes to his word. See, he's always
[1:12:41] willing. A real saint of God wants to
[1:12:43] tow the mark. How many want to know? I
[1:12:45] know that's why you're here on a Sunday
[1:12:46] night cuz you want to tow the mark. We
[1:12:48] will not be offended by the preaching of
[1:12:50] the word.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What would it do? What if we
[1:12:56] didn't get offended anymore? No matter
[1:12:58] what a prophet said, we just say, "Well,
[1:13:00] I believe he was a prophet to the age. I
[1:13:02] may not understand it, but I believe it.
[1:13:04] Whatever the Bible says, I believe that
[1:13:06] it's true." Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; What if we refuse to be offended or
[1:13:11] stumble over the word?
[1:13:15] The sour phoenician woman came to Jesus
[1:13:16] with a real need. Brother Brandham talks
[1:13:19] about her. He said, "A real Christian
[1:13:22] fights for his position." We talked
[1:13:25] about that just earlier, Brother Caleb.
[1:13:26] I had forgotten I had this quote. But a
[1:13:28] real Christian fights for his position.
[1:13:31] He has to stand alone, him and God. And
[1:13:33] he fights every inch of ground. So you
[1:13:35] don't have to baby them around. He said,
[1:13:37] "That's what's the matter with the
[1:13:38] Pentecostal church today. We got
[1:13:39] Pentecostal babies just been sprinkled
[1:13:41] and sprayed with this and that and the
[1:13:43] other till it's run out to a bunch of
[1:13:44] hybrids. What we need today is a house
[1:13:47] cleaning from the pulpit all the way to
[1:13:48] the janitor and starting over again." He
[1:13:50] said, "Get some genuine faith born into
[1:13:52] people." He said, "No." He said, talking
[1:13:54] about this sourcian woman, she wasn't a
[1:13:56] hybrid as a so-called crop of believers
[1:13:58] is today. What did she do? She admitted
[1:14:00] he was right. How many can admit he's
[1:14:02] right this afternoon? He's right. the
[1:14:05] word and faith always admits the word is
[1:14:07] right. If your faith don't punctuate
[1:14:09] every word of God's word with an amen,
[1:14:11] there is something wrong with your
[1:14:13] experience. The Bible said he's the same
[1:14:15] yesterday, today, and forever. If it
[1:14:17] don't say amen to that, then there's
[1:14:18] something wrong. Jesus said, "The works
[1:14:20] that I do, shall you do also. If it
[1:14:22] don't say amen to that, there's
[1:14:23] something wrong. If it don't punctuate
[1:14:25] every word of God's promise with an
[1:14:27] amen, there is something wrong." But she
[1:14:29] admitted that he was right. Oh, can we
[1:14:31] admit the word is right today? He said,
[1:14:33] "I'm the God that heals all your
[1:14:35] diseases." I admit that the word is
[1:14:37] right. He said, "I'll save you and your
[1:14:39] house. I admit that the word is right."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And if he said, "Clean up your life." If
[1:14:43] he said whatever it is he said, I admit
[1:14:46] the word is right. Lord, help me to live
[1:14:48] your word.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. She admitted he was right. She
[1:14:53] admitted she wasn't nothing but a dog.
[1:14:56] That's a hard thing to admit.
[1:14:59] Jesus comes to her, the word made flesh,
[1:15:03] and puts
[1:15:05] the response that he gave her was the
[1:15:07] worst possible way of saying it.
[1:15:11] It was absolutely the worst possible way
[1:15:13] you could say it. And Jesus never made a
[1:15:16] mistake.
[1:15:20] God was testing her.
[1:15:23] He was showing something. I'm glad for
[1:15:24] this story because it shows us
[1:15:26] something.
[1:15:28] She was persevering. Brother Brandham
[1:15:30] said she admitted she wasn't nothing but
[1:15:31] a dog, but she was after crumbs. He
[1:15:34] said, "It wouldn't be us. Oh no, we have
[1:15:35] to be set up on a seat and if they don't
[1:15:37] minister to me the first night, I'll not
[1:15:39] I'll go back the next night." Oh, what a
[1:15:42] difference she was. Put back, shoved
[1:15:45] back, shoved out, put outside, whatever
[1:15:48] it was, she was determined. She was
[1:15:52] persistent, perseverant. You know,
[1:15:54] sometimes we get that way with God. you
[1:15:56] know, we come and we approach him with
[1:15:57] something and it seemed like nothing
[1:15:58] moves for days and then weeks and then
[1:16:01] months and we we get discouraged and we
[1:16:03] say, "Well, you know, I just won't bring
[1:16:04] it to him anymore." No, that's not the
[1:16:06] way she was.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; She didn't become offended by the
[1:16:09] response that she got or the lack
[1:16:11] thereof. She she was not going to do
[1:16:13] that. She was going to get to Jesus and
[1:16:16] she was going to explain her need and
[1:16:18] she was going to believe he was going to
[1:16:19] meet her need. She held that the healing
[1:16:21] of her daughter is so valuable. She
[1:16:23] said, "I don't care what he says."
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; See, my wife hurting my feelings is not
[1:16:30] going to break up our marriage
[1:16:33] because our marriage is bigger than
[1:16:35] that. It's more valuable. Are you with
[1:16:36] me, church?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody hurting my feelings in the
[1:16:39] church is not going to quit me, make me
[1:16:41] quit going to church because it's bigger
[1:16:43] than that. It's not about them.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; It's about God. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Now listen, he said, "Put back, shove
[1:16:52] back, shoved out, put aside, put outside
[1:16:54] whatever it was, she was determined. She
[1:16:56] was persistent, perseverant. Something
[1:16:58] on the inside of her told her that she
[1:17:00] was going to get it regardless of how
[1:17:01] long she had to wait. What she had to go
[1:17:03] through, she'd get it anyhow. She was
[1:17:05] after the crumbs. She didn't want a full
[1:17:07] course dinner. She said, "The dogs eat
[1:17:09] the crumbs under the master's table."
[1:17:12] Hallelujah. The dogs eat the crumb.
[1:17:15] Matthew 15:27. truth, Lord. Yet the dogs
[1:17:18] eat of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:17:20] master's table. He said, "No offense,
[1:17:22] but you're a dog."
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; She said, "None taken."
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Why? She believed in him.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; See, it's about I've had people,
[1:17:38] friends, you forgive me. I'll be done
[1:17:40] here in a minute. But I've had friends
[1:17:42] that assumed that I wouldn't be their
[1:17:44] friend anymore because we disagreed
[1:17:46] about something. Preachers and sometimes
[1:17:47] and people and they just assume you
[1:17:49] won't be their friend because you
[1:17:50] disagree. Where did that come from?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I disagree with myself sometimes.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Right? That don't mean you can't be
[1:18:03] friends and it don't shouldn't even
[1:18:05] change the friendship. Brother Brandon
[1:18:07] said, "If you can't bitterly disagree
[1:18:09] from one side to the other and not feel
[1:18:11] the same way about that person as you
[1:18:13] did before," he said, "you don't even
[1:18:14] have the spirit of Christ."
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; But they don't have any bearing on my
[1:18:20] friendship because I value the
[1:18:21] friendship, the person. I don't love
[1:18:24] some of the brothers that I love very
[1:18:25] much. And and and in the in the message,
[1:18:28] my my friends in the message, I I don't
[1:18:30] value them for their ministries. I don't
[1:18:31] value them because of their proximity to
[1:18:33] greatness. I don't value them whether
[1:18:35] they can preach or can't preach. I value
[1:18:37] that person for that person. They're the
[1:18:39] same person even if they didn't preach
[1:18:40] no more. They're the same person even if
[1:18:42] they never sung another song. They're
[1:18:44] still the same person.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And I value the person and not the gift.
[1:18:51] It's the gift. God might quit using the
[1:18:54] gift, but he the person is still the
[1:18:56] same person.
[1:18:58] We don't Somebody leaves this church, we
[1:19:00] don't quit loving them. Yeah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:19:07] Somebody
[1:19:09] Somebody acts in a way that shouldn't
[1:19:10] and maybe falls or No, that's the time
[1:19:12] we ought to love more than we ever have.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; You know, we we hate. The Bible says
[1:19:18] save with fear. It doesn't mean cause
[1:19:20] the person to fear. It means be fearful
[1:19:23] yourself. Don't respect the fact that
[1:19:25] there's sin and you don't want to touch
[1:19:26] the sin. You you hate the garment
[1:19:28] spotted by the flesh, but you don't you
[1:19:30] don't make the person fear. You love the
[1:19:32] person,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; make a difference, but you just handle
[1:19:35] it carefully because you don't want to
[1:19:37] be involved in the sin.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; How do you do that? Well, you got to get
[1:19:42] the people to believe you. As we said
[1:19:44] earlier, look at Jesus and Lazarus's
[1:19:45] family.
[1:19:48] She she believed
[1:19:50] or or they believed. Martha and Mary,
[1:19:54] they believed. And Jesus went down to
[1:19:55] Lazarus and you remember what happened?
[1:19:58] He they asked him to come. He didn't
[1:20:00] even send word back. He's four days
[1:20:02] late. They've already buried
[1:20:05] Jesus best friend
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and he didn't even go to the funeral.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And again, I'm not advocating that,
[1:20:17] right? We should treat one another
[1:20:19] right.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; It's wrong to treat one another wrong
[1:20:22] purposely. But Jesus had a purpose. He
[1:20:25] was going to show us something about the
[1:20:26] resurrection.
[1:20:29] Listen, brother Brandon said, "If you
[1:20:31] send to your pastor and he didn't come
[1:20:32] pray for you when you were sick, well,
[1:20:33] you say the old hypocrite,
[1:20:35] I'll go over and join Jones's church or
[1:20:37] something, that's the reason your pastor
[1:20:38] can't do nothing for you." You got to
[1:20:40] have faith in him and confidence. I want
[1:20:41] us to think about more than a pastor.
[1:20:42] Now, I You understand? I'm a little
[1:20:44] self-conscious even reading these quotes
[1:20:46] because I don't want you to think about
[1:20:47] me. I want you to think about just in
[1:20:49] general if we were if we refused to be
[1:20:51] offended what that would be like
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; if we had confidence in one another. He
[1:20:56] said, 'You got to know, you have
[1:20:58] confidence in him as a man of God. Know
[1:21:00] that all things work together for good
[1:21:01] to them that love God. That's right.
[1:21:02] Now, your pastor didn't tell me to say
[1:21:03] that either. Praise God. But I know
[1:21:05] this. You got to have confidence in the
[1:21:06] man you're dealing with, or it won't do
[1:21:08] you any good to do any dealing. That's
[1:21:10] true. You got to believe your pastor.
[1:21:11] He's a good God-save man preaching the
[1:21:13] gospel. Stand behind him with everything
[1:21:14] you got. And then, Brother Brandon
[1:21:15] balances that out. He said, "If he
[1:21:17] isn't, go somewhere where they do do
[1:21:19] it."
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Right? So, he didn't say you're wedded
[1:21:22] to a church. You're not married to your
[1:21:24] pastor. That's false doctrine.
[1:21:26] But he said, "That's right." Now, that
[1:21:28] clears it up for both sides. Now,
[1:21:29] remember this. If he preaches the
[1:21:30] gospel, stay with him. Help him because
[1:21:32] he's a man sent from God, ordained of
[1:21:34] God to feed your soul. I want to widen
[1:21:36] that lens from a pastor and say, "What
[1:21:38] if we believe one another?" What if we
[1:21:41] really believe that one day we're going
[1:21:43] to sit down at this table and every tear
[1:21:44] will be wiped away? What if we really
[1:21:46] believe, brother Walt, that you and me
[1:21:48] are going to sit there, we'll be the
[1:21:49] same age?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; What if I really believe that?
[1:21:54] And I do. But what if it really got real
[1:21:56] to us?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; What could change that? If I knew,
[1:22:00] brother Joe, you were going to be there.
[1:22:02] If I believed in election in you, like
[1:22:03] like I believe in election for myself,
[1:22:07] then how could I get too out of source?
[1:22:09] Like I might disapprove of something you
[1:22:10] do, but how could I get offended to the
[1:22:13] point of cutting off my fellowship with
[1:22:15] my brother? Come on, church. I'm not
[1:22:18] saying you can't get your feelings hurt.
[1:22:20] I'm saying, what if we didn't take
[1:22:21] offense?
[1:22:24] If
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; we just walked away,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; left it to God, let God be God, and love
[1:22:30] one another.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; What if we really believe that someday
[1:22:34] we're going to sit at a table thousands
[1:22:35] of miles long and say, "Brother Ben, how
[1:22:36] does that work?" I have no clue. I don't
[1:22:39] know how the dinner service is going to
[1:22:40] work. I don't know what kind of plates
[1:22:41] they're going to use. All I know is they
[1:22:42] got fried chicken. All I know
[1:22:46] I don't even know how the chickens get
[1:22:47] there.
[1:22:52] Maybe all them chickens we've eaten.
[1:22:54] Maybe eat more chicken. There'll be more
[1:22:55] chicken already over there. You know,
[1:22:59] we said all the day you ever loved and
[1:23:00] all that ever loved you. Maybe I'm
[1:23:02] taking that too far.
[1:23:06] Come on, guys. It's all right.
[1:23:10] Now, look. What if we believed in one
[1:23:12] another like that? I'm going to be there
[1:23:14] eating that chicken. You're going to be
[1:23:16] there. Every tear is going to be wiped
[1:23:19] away. Everything's going to be
[1:23:20] explained. Then how could I ever get to
[1:23:22] the point where I'm just going to cut
[1:23:23] off fellowship with you? I don't like
[1:23:24] you anymore. I don't love you anymore.
[1:23:26] What if we just treated one another
[1:23:27] right and said, "You know what? I don't
[1:23:29] understand what they do, but I
[1:23:30] understand this. God's a big God and
[1:23:32] he's able to get them there just like
[1:23:34] he's able to get me there. Grace will
[1:23:35] work for them just like it works for
[1:23:37] me." What if I quit worrying about
[1:23:39] everybody else and and said, "I'm not
[1:23:41] going to take offense
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; to anything
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; because it's a trick. It's a trap of the
[1:23:48] enemy
[1:23:50] to get me to a place where I don't act
[1:23:52] like him,
[1:23:53] where I don't have confidence in
[1:23:55] anybody. G Peter or Paul said rather
[1:23:56] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:23:58] which hath great recompense of reward.
[1:24:00] You got to have confidence in Christ,
[1:24:02] confidence in one another. Musicians, go
[1:24:03] ahead and come.
[1:24:06] He was not offended.
[1:24:09] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:24:13] soldier said, "No offense," but slapped
[1:24:16] him across the face.
[1:24:20] "No offense, but we're going to nail you
[1:24:22] to a cross."
[1:24:27] They accused him. They falsely. They
[1:24:28] spit in his face. Soldiers buffeted him.
[1:24:30] That means they struck him with their
[1:24:32] open hand. Put a crown of thorns on the
[1:24:34] king. On my king.
[1:24:40] I started writing that down, Brother
[1:24:42] Caleb. And as I was writing that down,
[1:24:43] it hit me. They didn't do it.
[1:24:46] I did it.
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:55] I know we're not a large number this
[1:24:56] afternoon, but can you hear me for just
[1:24:58] a moment? They didn't do it. My sins
[1:25:02] put him on the cross.
[1:25:05] He paid for my sins, my transgressions.
[1:25:08] He was wounded. Isaiah 53. He was
[1:25:10] wounded for my transgressions.
[1:25:14] Hallelujah. The chastisement of our
[1:25:16] peace was upon him. He was done that way
[1:25:20] by me.
[1:25:24] You realize that I I was a human being.
[1:25:26] I was one who didn't recognize him. I
[1:25:29] was one who walked over his grace. I was
[1:25:31] one who did all kinds of things I
[1:25:33] shouldn't have done. But he loved me
[1:25:35] anyway. He refused to take offense. Not
[1:25:37] because of what I did, but because of
[1:25:39] who I was.
[1:25:42] He said, "There's something valuable."
[1:25:44] Glory to God.
[1:25:47] So, he picked up something breakable and
[1:25:49] he would not handle it loosely,
[1:25:54] but he refused to speak.
[1:25:58] Said, "I won't handle it like a regular
[1:26:01] man." He's like a lamb before the
[1:26:03] slaughter. Said, "I'll handle it
[1:26:05] carefully." Brother Brandon many times
[1:26:07] got up to preach to people and he said
[1:26:08] he said if I had a vial of the blood
[1:26:10] which would be much more precious than
[1:26:12] this dish. If I had a vial of the blood
[1:26:15] that come from the veins of Christ.
[1:26:18] Oh God said if I had a if I had that he
[1:26:22] said I would I would I would handle it
[1:26:25] so carefully. He said well there's
[1:26:27] nothing in that. You would handle it
[1:26:28] carefully if you had it. It would be so
[1:26:33] precious.
[1:26:36] I just heard today that someone
[1:26:40] I can't pronounce the name of it, but
[1:26:41] the great the Lou or whatever it is, the
[1:26:42] great museum there in in Paris, someone
[1:26:45] robbed it yesterday or today. First time
[1:26:48] in like a century that it's been done.
[1:26:51] And they dropped a priceless jewel out
[1:26:55] of the collection of the kings of France
[1:26:57] that was on display. They robbed the
[1:27:00] place and on their way out it was so
[1:27:03] casual, so meaningless to them. They
[1:27:05] dropped one of those priceless jewels on
[1:27:08] the ground
[1:27:10] because they were thieves and robbers.
[1:27:12] That's the way the devil treated us one
[1:27:14] day. But God didn't treat us like that.
[1:27:16] Jesus didn't treat us that way. But what
[1:27:18] did he do? He cared for you.
[1:27:21] He held you carefully. That's the way we
[1:27:23] ought to hold our marriages. That's the
[1:27:24] way we ought to hold one another. That's
[1:27:26] the way we ought to treat one another as
[1:27:27] something breakable. That's so valuable.
[1:27:30] We couldn't imagine breaking it.
[1:27:35] Trust the person.
[1:27:38] He trusted that we were the bride. He He
[1:27:40] believed in us, knew us before we knew
[1:27:44] ourselves.
[1:27:47] And what if we turned around, took no
[1:27:49] offense at him,
[1:27:52] because he did it for us.
[1:27:55] Hallelujah.
[1:27:56] Let's just think on those things.
[1:28:02] I just feel like worshiping him tonight.
[1:28:03] Isn't he good to us?
[1:28:06] What if we refused
[1:28:08] to take offense? No offense.
[1:28:11] None taken.
[1:28:14] Just not going to play the game. We
[1:28:16] don't play games with our families.
[1:28:18] Don't play games with our marriages.
[1:28:20] Don't play games with the church.
[1:28:22] Just not going to play that game. We're
[1:28:24] just going to love God, love people.
[1:28:29] Hallelujah. Would you bow your heads
[1:28:31] with me?
[1:28:42] What if we just refuse to be offended?
[1:28:44] You know what it is? Most of the time we
[1:28:47] we work so hard ourselves. We see other
[1:28:49] people maybe not doing what we're doing
[1:28:50] and we get offended in that. we get.
[1:28:54] Well, if I have to do all this and these
[1:28:55] other people aren't even trying.
[1:28:59] What if I told you there was a thief on
[1:29:01] the cross who never did one good thing
[1:29:02] in his life?
[1:29:06] And Jesus didn't send him back to the
[1:29:08] earth and say, "Well, now you got to go
[1:29:09] live a good life.
[1:29:13] Just just just go and prove yourself
[1:29:16] worthy."
[1:29:18] He had never, Brother Brandon said, he
[1:29:19] never even thought about God
[1:29:22] till that moment.
[1:29:24] Well, they're not doing their part. He
[1:29:25] didn't do his part.
[1:29:28] But when he got to heaven, you've heard
[1:29:29] it before, someone said that when he got
[1:29:31] to heaven, they all asked him, "What did
[1:29:33] you do? What did you understand
[1:29:35] election? Did you understand
[1:29:36] predestination? Did you understand
[1:29:37] justification?" He said, "I didn't
[1:29:39] understand any of it. I don't even know
[1:29:42] why I'm here.
[1:29:44] But the man on the middle cross said I
[1:29:46] could come.
[1:29:49] That's enough.
[1:29:51] Don't get offended in people because
[1:29:52] they don't know God called you maybe to
[1:29:54] something else, but you just do what God
[1:29:56] calls you to do and do what God calls me
[1:29:58] to do. And let's just love the Lord and
[1:30:00] love each other and treat valuable
[1:30:02] things as value as valuable as having
[1:30:06] value. Heavenly Father, so glad that you
[1:30:10] paid a debt I could not pay.
[1:30:17] Lord, I'm aware that you didn't speak up
[1:30:19] when they falsely accused you. You
[1:30:22] didn't answer when you were beaten.
[1:30:25] Lord, when you were hanging on a cross,
[1:30:27] could have called 10,000 angels. You
[1:30:28] didn't. The only thing you said was,
[1:30:30] "Father, forgive them." You refuse to
[1:30:34] take offense at the sins of the world.
[1:30:38] I'm so grateful, Lord.
[1:30:41] Lord, I pray that you would help us.
[1:30:44] Lord, we are offended many times even in
[1:30:46] righteous indignation when it comes to
[1:30:48] the world and the way people live.
[1:30:52] But Lord, help us to love people anyway.
[1:30:55] You did,
[1:30:57] God. You were very offended at the way I
[1:31:00] lived, but you came anyway and saved me.
[1:31:04] And I'm so grateful that you refused to
[1:31:06] take offense and turn it into a weapon.
[1:31:09] I pray God you'd help us to learn from
[1:31:12] you, take on your character today and do
[1:31:15] what you do. Pray that you'd grant it,
[1:31:18] Lord. Lord, as you've scoured us out
[1:31:19] now, I don't know how to preach any
[1:31:21] other way. I wish I could preach like
[1:31:22] everybody else, but Lord, you put things
[1:31:24] on my heart and I pray it'd do some
[1:31:27] good.
[1:31:29] What if we just refused to be offended?
[1:31:32] What a difference it would make. I thank
[1:31:35] you, Lord. Thank you for these people
[1:31:36] who've been so patient, Lord, and
[1:31:38] refused to be offended with me so many
[1:31:40] times. I appreciate them, Lord. And pray
[1:31:42] you bless them, each one. I pray you
[1:31:44] bless every marriage, every home, every
[1:31:46] every child, Lord, every elder, Lord,
[1:31:49] until we see your face. We sit down
[1:31:51] together at that table,
[1:31:54] Lord. We love you. We thank you in Jesus
[1:31:56] name.
[1:31:58] Hallelujah. If you need prayer, I'd be
[1:32:00] glad to pray with you tonight. Let's
[1:32:01] just worship the Lord. Let's stand
[1:32:03] together.
[1:32:04] Oh, I needed
[1:32:07] someone.
[1:32:09] Oh, to wash my sins away. Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] Did you need somebody? And now I sing a
[1:32:22] brand new song. Oh, amazing
[1:32:26] grace.
[1:32:28] Oh, all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[1:32:34] debt all that I could never pay.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah. Let's sing it now. He paid a
[1:32:42] debt at Calvary. He paid a debt at
[1:32:47] Calary.
[1:32:49] Could you lift your hands to him and
[1:32:50] thank you for doing it in my soul. Oh,
[1:32:54] set me free. I'm glad that Jesus Oh, he
[1:33:01] did all. Aren't you glad? He erased all
[1:33:04] your sins. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:33:08] Oh, I now can sing a brand new song. It
[1:33:15] was amazing
[1:33:17] grace.
[1:33:19] All day long, Christ Jesus
[1:33:24] paid a debt. Oh, that I could live
[1:33:30] for days or another verse to that. One
[1:33:32] day he's coming. Oh, one day he's come.
[1:33:37] Oh, I'm glad Lord that you're coming.
[1:33:39] Glad you're coming for me and my
[1:33:41] brothers and my sister to live with him.
[1:33:43] Why don't you just worship him in the
[1:33:45] church before we go? Oh, in be glory.
[1:33:50] Oh, to see him on that day.
[1:33:57] Hallelujah. I then will sing a brand new
[1:34:03] song. It's amazing
[1:34:06] grace
[1:34:08] all day long. Christ Jesus paid the
[1:34:14] dead. Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] I could never pay. Hallelujah. Again, he
[1:34:22] paid a debt. He paid the debt. He did
[1:34:26] not owe not.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I owe the debt.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could not pay. I needed
[1:34:37] someone.
[1:34:39] Oh, to wash my sins away.
[1:34:45] Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] Oh, and now I sing a brand new song. It
[1:34:53] was amazing
[1:34:55] grace.
[1:34:57] All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt
[1:35:04] that I could never pay. Could you give
[1:35:09] him a hands of hand of praise?
[1:35:11] Hallelujah. We sing. Thank you Jesus for
[1:35:14] the grace that you've given me.
[1:35:16] Hallelujah.
[1:35:18] I want to say thank
[1:35:21] you
[1:35:23] Jesus
[1:35:25] for the grace that you have given me.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; For the grace that you have given us.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can. Oh, from my heart, I'd like
[1:35:40] to say that I
[1:35:44] thank you.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time. I want to say
[1:35:49] thank
[1:35:51] you. Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, we love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you
[1:35:55] for your grace and your goodness. For
[1:35:58] the grace that you have given us.
[1:36:04] Oh, though I can't repay from my heart,
[1:36:09] I'd like to say that I
[1:36:14] Oh, I thank you one more time with all
[1:36:17] your heart. Oh, I want to say thank
[1:36:21] you.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus,
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; for the grace that you have given us.
[1:36:35] Oh, I can't repay from my heart. I would
[1:36:40] like to say that I
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we love you today and
[1:36:52] thank you for your goodness on us. Lord,
[1:36:54] as we leave this place, may we never
[1:36:56] leave your presence.
[1:36:59] I pray again for those that are sick and
[1:37:00] in need, Lord.
[1:37:03] I pray Lord that you would change us,
[1:37:08] oh God.
[1:37:10] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:37:13] Make it ever true. Move me, Lord, closer
[1:37:17] to what I ought to be.
[1:37:19] Manifest yourself in my life, Lord, in
[1:37:22] the lives of these people.
[1:37:25] We thank you for all that you've done.
[1:37:26] And I pray you'd put joy in the hearts
[1:37:28] of the saints. Lord, as they leave this
[1:37:31] place, they would know that you refused
[1:37:34] to be offended, took no offense at our
[1:37:37] sin, and wiped it away, never to be
[1:37:42] remembered again. Lord, it ought to
[1:37:43] bring joy to our hearts. And we thank
[1:37:45] you for it. Jesus name. Hallelujah. I
[1:37:50] thank
[1:37:52] you. One more time. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:55] Open
[1:38:00] Jesus.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, for the grace that you have
[1:38:10] given us.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't repay from my heart. I'd
[1:38:18] like to say that I
[1:38:23] thank
[1:38:25] you.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. Let's
[1:38:29] sing this before we go.
[1:38:32] I'm no longer a slave
[1:38:37] to fear. How many can say amen to this
[1:38:40] today? I am a child
[1:38:45] of God.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:38:47] Oh, I'm no longer
[1:38:51] a slave
[1:38:53] to fear. Aren't you glad? Oh, I am a
[1:38:59] child
[1:39:00] of God. Sing it one more time. Oh, I'm
[1:39:04] no longer
[1:39:06] a slave
[1:39:08] to fear. Let it be your anthem as you
[1:39:11] go. God bless you today. You're
[1:39:13] dismissed a child
[1:39:16] of God. Oh yes, I'm no longer Oh, thank
[1:39:21] you, Lord. A slave to fear.
[1:39:26] Oh, I am a child
[1:39:31] of God.
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:35] You unravel me
[1:39:38] with a melody.
[1:39:42] You surround me with a
