in need I I pray for those that are watching tonight that you'd bless them Lord I know that you're a an ontime God so I pray that there would be something timely that would be said Lord that would help your people Lord move me out of the way and speak directly to some need we pray in Jesus name amen amen Ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 26 I I want to uh take a little bit of a a different thought I haven't preached on this in a while I guess Ezekiel 3626 but it just come to my heart this week and Trust it'll be a blessing to you brother Brandon preached a series of uh of sermons in the late 50s he titled them uh what does it take to make a Christian Life or the impersonation of Christianity also why is it so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian Life and then he finally he titled one why some people can't keep the Victory and all of those sermons were uh off of Ezekiel 36:26 and 27 so Ezekiel 36 26 says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them amen I pray Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated thank you for being here on a Wednesday night brother brandom when he preaches these sermons he he begins by let letting us know that God intended his church to be governed by the Holy Ghost he said God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectual or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ and so he never intended his church to be a self-help program we're not we're not uh uh the AA or some kind of uh uh place that those things are good but that's not what we are what we are is a body governed by the Holy Spirit God uses men to govern he does do that but those men are to be led by the spirit in fact in Romans 8:14 Paul says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so I trust that's all of us tonight that we are led by the spirit of God and you say well I don't feel like I I'm LED I don't feel like that God is working in my life but you're here tonight I believe you were led to this church by the spirit of God because you are the sons and daughters of God and so brother brandham tells us that he he's not placed his church in the hands of just an elected leadership that moves with political mindedness but he's placed his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word and and so that's the way that we can lead now but it's not just the leadership but the people as well brand said God's Eternal Plan of Salvation for his people is the holy spirit in the church he said Born Again men and women operated by the Holy Spirit not them trying to operate the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit operating them so our job is to get out of the way and let the Holy Spirit operate within us in the way that he wants to do yes sir so the spirit reveals the word of the hour how many believe that he said he would lead us and guide us into all truth if you need to know something in your life then the spirit has to reveal that to you and and if I tell you that'll you can just take my word for it but if I speak it and then the Holy Spirit reveals it and then it becomes a revelation to you and when we receive Revelation we're stimulated by that revelation we we have the wine of stimulation in our lives and and brother brandom again he would take this to Mark 2:22 or he also says this in Matthew and in Luke as well Jesus said no man putteth new wine into Old bottles or the new wine will burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles so this Holy Ghost leadership has got to be put into something that is flexible right that is flexible enough to move when the stimulation of Revelation comes in right so the new wine is flexible new wine bottles are made of of cide or they were in that age and you can kind of see what they were they were actually not bottles like glass bottles what we would think of but they were made out of skin and so if they were new that means they meant they would move and when you got new wine it's still fermenting it's still expanding and so you got to have new skins to put the new wine in or it'll ruin both the wine and the skin so the new wine bottles are flexible and the new wine has life in it brother brand said the new bottles has still the animal oil in the skins and it's flexible so there's got to be oil in the skins and and they've got to be flexible that's the way God's Church must be for Revival flexible I'm glad I got somebody Amen in me tonight so the new bottle reacts positively to the word that's actually what I'm talking about now brother Jonah is is the new bottle will actually amen the word listen to this next quote brother BR said every time the word of God is preached in its power the new skin will holler amen it'll give away why because it's it's a new skin it it's not held in by Dogma it's not held in by Creed it'll respond to the word it's got to because it's a new new skin and the new wine the stimulation of Revelation makes it holler amen oh I want to be able to positively respond to the word said brother Ben I'm not able to well maybe it's because that that you got some old skin working there it needs to be oiled by the Holy Spirit needs to have some new skin so you'll have a way uh of receiving the stimulation of Revelation so brother brandom then tells the story and he does this tells us many many times in the message but he talked about going out and if you pull up that picture I think I put a picture on there he talks about going out in the woods and he's on a hunting trip and he goes out and what he calls a burnd down a burnd down or a burnover and he said that when he went through this place he said he he he stopped his horse and he's looking around and he said as he's looking there he sees these great big old spooky trees he said it was nighttime and he said you could see the sky the moon lit the sky and you could see down and he said it was spooky he said anybody riding through there would get scared because of the spookiness of the trees because the trees and and they had once been strong trees but it was just a spooky place and he said they were moaning In The Wind that they were they were actually making a noise in the wind and and so he he got in there he said Lord what are you trying to tell me he could feel there was something that God was trying to tell him and he said he began to think about the scripture that said what the Palmer word ate the the cankerworm what the P worm left the cankerworm ate and the caterpillar ate and all of those things and he said that's these trees they've been eaten back but he said I will restore sayith the Lord but these trees had had a uh there was something about them he said they were established they had the truth they had they were once what God was doing but when the the fire came through and the Holy Spirit then be to move they could no longer because of their condition they can no longer respond in a positive way instead they were responding with this moaning they were responding with this this groaning and and making a mournful noise and and brother BR said they could prove by their history that that they had great things at one time but now the life was gone and now they were dead attempting he said to scare their members into not attending meetings right so we we've all experienced that I'm sure that and he he typed that to the mainline churches of that day that said well you don't need to go to the healing meetings God don't do that no more but he said God does do that so brother Brandon he he gets in there and he says well there's no hope yeah he said that you get in the middle of all these burnover trees and maybe we feel like that some well there's just no hope but it's actually true that a fire when it gets into the woods like that there's certain trees that can only be re born by fire that they actually uh the the pods will come open and the only way that seed could ever drop into the ground is it's released by being burned off oh I just love that and so when the fire came through it didn't just stop with the old spooky trees he said but he noticed some undergrowth some some young trees sitting there where the fire had come through and he said these were not big old strong trees that that making a spooky noise but these were flexible moving in the wind and growing we always want to be growing don't we we don't want to ever stop we don't want to ever get to a place where we can't grow and so he said the wind loosened the roots and he said every time the wind come through he said why does God send a Revival because the wind loosens The Roots so it could grow deeper he talked about the disciples at Pentecost that they were flexible and they rejoiced in the rushing Mighty Wind of the spirit when it come through and we want to be like that Lord give us a flexible heart so so we can rejoice when the spirit of God is moving among us so we can we can we can respond to God's word when it's being preached give us a flexible heart to be led by the spirit of God and so that's what Ezekiel is trying to say he said a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh so he's given you a new heart in place of the Stony heart and a new spirit in place of your old Spirit he said I will give you a heart of flesh but he doesn't stop there he said I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them notice the order a new heart a new spirit but then he says I'll put my spirit within you and brother BR said many people get mixed up there and and this is Brother brandom's solution to why people are so tossed about why people so hard for them to live a Christian Life why they're up today and down tomorrow why you know and I say as Christians all of us go through valleys but we all have hard times but but what keeps us going to church what keeps us if you look at an elder that's been around for a while and so I just admire their life well it's not because they didn't have any hard times it's not because they didn't struggle what kept them at the altar what kept them coming back to the house of God it wasn't because they never did anything wrong but it's because there was something inside of them that held them and so they didn't just have a new spirit but they had the his spirit and and this is Brother brandom's uh if you will it it was his remedy and and and if you find yourself and I'm not just preaching to you because just a small group tonight but but if you find yourself and in any of us and those that watch it or whatever if you find yourself in a place where you're up and down and in and out and always wondering whether you're a Christian or not and not knowing if you're going to make it or not you need to not just have a new spirit but you need to have his Spirit on the inside so that you could you could remain steady in that moment now he said that now the new spirit he said God had to give you a new spirit but that's the new spirit God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost see with that old Spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor you couldn't get along with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with God so God gives you a a new spirit right but he said that's not the Holy Ghost and that's where many Pentecostals failed because they they had the new spirit the new heart but they didn't have the they didn't have his spirit so but once you have his Spirit he taught us you don't have to pretend to be a Christian you just do the works of Christ you don't have to force yourself or talk yourself into being a Christ because I'm supposed to but it's something that you want to do though you might fail though you might backside at times or get cold on God but yet there's some there's a desire in your heart that's not the way you want to be and so you don't have to have anybody come talk you in to being a Christian again you just you you you go right back where you come from because that's where you belong all right is in the house of God so uh you know brother random said it's like a main spring and that's not something we really think about today a mainspring but it would be in a mechanical watch so brother Bram said it's like a mainspring in a famous watch he said and it's self- winding that's important he said all right it sits right in the middle of that new spirit and the main spring so the main spring would be his Spirit it sits right in the middle of the new spirit the mainspring of a famous watch sits in the middle of the watch and makes every organ of that watch every little instrument tick just perfectly to time right so that the main Springs there Sunday morning it ticks to the house of God every time the doors are open it ticks right to the house of God that's not saying you'd never miss for vacation I'm not talking about that but when you have opportun it ticks you want to be in the house of God right cuz the main spring is there right and and and and and the it's the main spring it's something that keeps that controls you that keeps you moving and you might have a trial today but the main spring keeps ticking you might get dropped today and get thrown around today and get put in the bottom of a shelf somewhere but the mainstream is the main spring is still ticking and if you pick up that famous watch that well wellmade watch that you might pick it up years later if it's a self-winding watch you all you have to do is get a little bit of a shaking and and it'll come back again and that main Spring's still there and it'll just keep ticking right it keeps time now look brother brand said it's all done by a main spring and the little works out on the side move with this main spring it's the wheel in the middle of the wheel as Ezekiel said we'll come back to that in a moment so he said the mainspring is a famous watch what's a main spring I I got a picture of one I may have shown this to you before I don't know but I'm getting old so I can repeat myself and not worry about it because I can't remember that that's you could laugh at that it's all right but a mainspring this is an actual watch mainspring and it's just a piece of Steel and it's made by an artisan for many many years it was a great even great watch makers would not make their own main Springs only a few people in the world were qualified to make them because they were had to be made by with a certain mixture they would actually mix the iron and the alloy and all the different things together to make a flexible steel that then could be wound up really tight and put inside the watch and that looks like it's great big it's actually very long but if you maybe two feet long or something like that but when it's done it's put in just a little bitty spot in the watch if You' you got a mechanical watch you'll see inside of that there's a main spring so H the main spring is what keeps the watch ticking I think I've got yet that shows how it's coiled it's foot inside that little cylinder and it's coiled up real tight and that main spring will keep the watch ticking year after year after year and if you go to the next picture I think I that may be it I think I had a picture of a watch with the main spring in it but I don't think you could have seen it anyway because it's so small when it gets there to the end so Bram ties this to ezekiel's four living creatures so how many remember in the Book of Ezekiel there was four living creatures Ezekiel chapter 1:1 15 as I beheld the living creatures he said behold one wheel upon the Earth this is a strange Vision he said there was a wheel upon the Earth by the living creatures that had four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like in the color of a barrel a a barrel Stone and they had they four had one likeness their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel so brother brandom says that's that's what this mainspring was he said it was Christ which was the Hub of the wheel the G the oh my the inside gear the main spring the wheel in the middle so he even goes out and gives a very colorful explanation he said it's like a wagon wheel going down the road he said the justification was the outer rim or the Tire he said the sanctification was that inner Rim he said and uh he said the Pentecostals got speaking in tongues he said they had one spoke yeah he said but there's nine spokes to the wheel right nine spiritual gifts but they they cabbage down on one he said and say that was that one spoke he said that's why it clunk down the road yeah right cuz it only had one spoke he said but he said but if they had all nine spokes in there he said then Christ would be the main SP or the center of that wheel what makes everything turn without the Hub nothing else works so he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel other words the wheel that moves all the other Wheels he said brother Ben what keeps you going what what keeps you moving if you'd ask one of these Elders what keeps you going when the times are tough and and and it seems like there's no reason to go on what keeps you moving the wheel in the middle of the wheel so that's what Ezekiel Saw when he saw Christ and the a when Christ emptied out paradise he said there's the wheel in the middle of the wheel there's the one who keeps us going so brother brand said we're in the last days and the last hours of the days he said do you see him now in his word all of his word someone say all all of his word made manifest right here before us oh Church of the Living God he said get to your feet believe him with all that's in you hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move and every motion that you make so if the wheel is in control the wheel in the middle of the wheel wherever it moves the outside wheel moves right so whatever wherever the wheel in the middle of the wheel moves is where the spirit moves and the flesh moves why it's in control it's in it's it's stabilizes that's what keeps a person coming back and this one might fail and that one might fail and this one might fall and even the person themselves might make a mistake or fall or do something wrong but but they you know in spite of themselves something inside keeps them moving I'll say this that that that's got to be the place that we come to and say Lord I I know I need you I I I may struggle understanding this and I may not I may not completely get all of this but I know I need you Lord You're the wheel in the middle of my wheel you're what you're what keeps me moving you're what gives me a reason yeah got to be something there yes got to hold to that every thought that you have may it be controlled by this tower on the inside of you because God is setting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth the light what is he saying he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel the message of the hour was Christ and the message is the wheel that drives everything we do right are you with me now he said the holy spirit will make every movement like Christ it'll make you Christlike yes the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions I know this is teaching tonight but it's Wednesday night so you just bear with me he said our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that brother random had a colorful way of doing this he said a shinig will bring that to you right you could jump in the spirit or jump out a shindig whatever that is but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace and in love and in Joy with a long suffer suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience you see it isn't something that you do it's something the Holy Spirit does in you right right you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's so important church we can't think it through and plan it through well enough right to make it work it'll never happen you'll never be able to to set your life up in such a way and so govern your own life by by even by taking the word you can take the scripture and say well I'm going to just live the scripture and I'm going to do all this but you don't know what's going to happen but the mainspring does the one on the inside does and he's able to take the surprises and turn them to your benefit turn them to your good he's able to do that but you can't do that on your own sir you can't think that through intellectually it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit he said oh I wish I could shout the Praises of God around the world to that so he wasn't against shouting or jumping but it was it was that mainspring controls more than that right so he said a Christian with the spirit of Christ in his heart now look it goes through the same things everyone else does right the Temptation that's taking you Paul says is common to men right it it it's something that every one of us I I guess that all of our lives are different here tonight and yet you can find somebody in the world going through what you go through there's somebody else going through what you go through if you get a big enough group together it's just that's what the Bible says but a Christian goes through the same things but you remains a Christian and I know some of you have been through some things but you're here tonight and you love the Lord with all of your heart and you're still worship and you still thank God even though you've been through all of that yet you're still in the house of God what does that mean There's Something There Brother Bruce it's not just you there's something inside of you and that's what our young people need that's what our elders that's what we all need we need that main spring on the inside that can that can just click every time with the clock and be right on time with the word of God see remember what he said it's a self- winding watch right a self-winding mainspring so he don't have to wind the main I don't have to whine the main spring the main spring whines itself amen Matthew 11 and 20 and brother brandom would go here and in the in that sermon he in Matthew 11:29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest to your souls for my yoke is easy my burden is light brother brand said when you get this spirit in you this mainspring he said then the burdens of Life become light you don't notice them anymore the Yol is lined with feathers they become so easy they say you say well brother Ben you have not lived my life lately but I the word applies to all of us right it just depends on how we're looking at it and then he says this he said then the people that pile things on you all right we could just stop there for a minute couldn't we right right sometimes people pile things on you right they don't make it right they shouldn't do that they shouldn't do that but look what you do with it that'll determine your outcome people are going to pile things on you sometimes it's your wife sometimes it's your husband sometimes it's people in the church sometimes it's somebody on the outside sometimes it's a person at the bank sometimes someone at the grocery store sometimes someone at work it may be a wife it may be a husband it may be a child it may be somebody else but people because they're people tend to love to add to your burden right and and the thing is like you can't just stay away from people it don't work right you got to have people in your life because it's a blessing that they can bring as well and you can't help nobody if you're not around people but brother BR said you know what to do he said you're like Samson at the gates of Gaza I love this who picked up the big grass gate and packed it up on the hill now you say brother Ben this isn't very deep but there's a great Revelation here we need to we need to get to a place where we can pick up those burdens that people pile on us and just carry them to the hill you say well I can't do it Samson couldn't do it either he couldn't by his natural strength pick up big old brass Gates and that were probably 20 foot tall and carry them up to the up the mountain he couldn't do that they thought thought they had him boxed in he couldn't carry that that the people had piled on him but he oh my but he still picked them up why because he had the spirit in him to do it with something inside of him that gave him strength and I believe there's a strength Giver here tonight yes amen you say I got the Holy Ghost brother Brandon said I don't think that should be said you must say the Holy Ghost got me and then when the Holy Ghost gets you the burdens the yoke is easy and you pick Pi up the big Gates of Gaza and pack them straight to Calvary and there on Mount Calvary you lay them at the feet of Jesus and pray for your enemies not with a grudge Lord if you'd bust him open no but with something from your heart dear God that man is a man like I am that's when you know the main Spring's working when people pile everything they can pile on you and you pick up that burden take it to Calvary and pray for the people who piled it on you see the mainspring controls our emotions brother Brown said when the Holy Spirit comes in there's something that moves you you can't understand what it is it's a supernatural being inside you moving controlling your emotions making you scream when actually you feel like running so in other words it's not worship should not be premeditated like in this service man I tell you what I'm going to find the right time and if they if they sing the right song I'm going to run well we love to see people run but that's not what it's about right we're not that's that's forethought that's just having a good time like you plan to dance at the dance right but that's not what the mainspring does he said sometimes you'll scream when you think about when you feel like running he said you'll shout when you don't know what you're doing yeah he said you'll praise God just automatically all right something happens and what what it what he's trying to tell us if you go and listen to those sermons it's not something that's premeditated just because there's music but you might be in the worst trial of your life and going through the hardest moment and waiting through the mud and all of a sudden you lift up your hands and you're sitting in the church and maybe a quiet night with just a few people but you lift up your hands anyway and you say I bless you oh Lord I BL I something in you responds you hear the word being preaching something in you I know that's right and you step up and you begin to worship God anyway oh that we'd have more mainspring worshippers that worship when God told them to worship not just when everybody else is but when they feel the presence of God they don't think about doing it they just do it every once in a while you hear an Old Saint cry out and see tears going down their face and you'll see people be why what is it there's a mainspring there Hallelujah you don't have to work that up it's a main spring he said it's that main spring the spring of God's Grace I love the way he put that in the middle of your heart controlling you making you shunn from evil accept life get away from doubt have faith that mainspring will make you cast down reasoning and accept God's word oh all of us need that it's a moving ticking going round and round making your whole emotion come right in control with God right now brother BR said when the holy spirit's in the middle of your spirit now remember you got to have a new new spirit the Holy Ghost won't ever come in you got to have a new heart which is a new desire to serve God the Holy Ghost won't ever come in but when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is in the middle of your spirit makes every action of the Holy Spirit In You tick off just exactly according to God's time piece the Bible it's the main spring that does it it's the Holy Spirit that does it it isn't your church that does it it isn't your pastor that does it it isn't your shouting that does it it isn't your speaking with tongues that does it it isn't a healing service that does it it's the holy spirit that does it God's holy spirit in the middle of your new spirit it makes the whole church operate just exactly one big bundle of love you say what do we need to love one another more the mainspring right and that's what the Capstone was the the the the stone that was rejected by the builders was love it was actually it was actually Christ and he is love God is love was actually the most important Stone in the building he said the builders thought they could build the temple and this little old funny main spring didn't seem to fit in anywhere they kicked it out over in a weed pile where they kicked the Holy Ghost governing the church out in a weed pile but they come to find out it was the Chief Cornerstone he said my brother sister we've had all kinds of Sensations all kinds of evidences all kinds of everything else but until we come back to the main spring our church is only just as dry as the rest of them we've got to come back where there's something in the member it don't stop up here something in each one of the individual members that gives him peace and joy and and he's always on the Mountaintop shouting the Praises of God again that don't mean he doesn't go through anything but he's not dependent on the weather right he's not dependent s with a jol quote today brother Brandon said he said well I could go to church today but but it's just so hot and it was hot today but it's just so hot he said it's going to be a whole lot hotter where you going church I just you know we don't want to be like that do we we want to be rugged Christians what do we need the main spring something in the member that makes him on the mountain top not because he's always feels good or has money right CU if I was only on the mountain top when I had money I sure wouldn't spend much time there and we have to grow have valleys because in the valley brother brand said where the fruits grow right right the fruit don't grow on the mountain he said they get frostbit I love the way the prophet put things but he said in The Valleys where the fruit grows that's the area of your life when you're going through some things that's when God that's when your faith shows that's when your perseverance shows that's when you show whose side you're on but the way you're always on the mountain top shouting the Praises of God is you're going to shout the Praises of God whether you're going through the valley or wherever you're at you still love God anyway oh my well the B said I wish I could get you to see it he said then the Yoke becomes easy it doesn't shave around the collar have any of you ever ever uh drove horses or mules uh nobody's old enough to have done that we have they're of course you have if you've driven and and you know this when you put that that thing around the collar around their neck or you put it's got a collar you know if it was it wasn't just right it would shave the neck and you'd get a raw spot on the neck or on the shoulder where that where that was pulling and so you had to it had to have a padding on the inside and and I think that was the problem with some of them horses we had is that the there was no padding there on the old equipment we were using so it got to shaen them a little bit and it would actually bring draw blood and so you'd have to take care of it so you'd have to line that with something to keep it to where it doesn't shave the the the neck of the horse or the or the donkey or whatever it is that you're pulling with the mule I guess you wouldn't pull very far with a donkey but he said Oh my he said I wish you could get to see it he said then the Yol becomes easy it doesn't shave around the collar it's lined with With Love Oh my he said if it's only lined with emotion it'll soon shave around the collar so emotions are only temporary you're only going to feel you say I feel good tonight brother Ben you're only going to feel that good for a little while right when you get married some of you young people not very many of Youth here tonight but you listen to me when you get married or before you get married oh we just you know that feeling of Love better enjoy it while it lasts yeah yes and and and I believe you can be in love and be old but it becomes a choice becomes something you choose to do because sometimes you don't feel like it right so you get up and I made the statement before you get up and you choose to stay married every day it's just a choice right and and and because sometimes it shapes if I'm saying that correctly it will chafe around the collar now brother Brandon says now you can shout a little bit at church you go out on the street and somebody says you know you're a Holy Roller oh it chafes real bad somebody said well look why I seen you down the other night shouting till your hair fell down think we've had that problem lately but well John I suppose if that's the way you're going to do it we might as well get away from that group oh see that's not what we say it's chaing see but when the main spring is in there it lines it with love you Yol is easy you can bear anything they call you a Holy Roller call you a fanatic anything they want to the yolk is so easy you can lay it up on your shoulders when you're yolked up with the main spring and it's not you anymore it's him that's ticking it off right the clock keeps ticking no matter what happens whatever else is going on in your life the clock keeps ticking why the mainspring you might be driven to your last Wits End somebody might have stepped on your very last nerve that you walk in the house of God say well it's going to be a quiet service but the main Spring's still there right so you so you it's not you controlling your emotions well I you might sit there with every intention of being miserable but but but there's the mainspring something in your heart Springs up yes and and won't let you stay that way it's a mainspring brother BR said it's so easy just like Samson with the braz gates of Gaza he just packed them away when somebody calls you a Holy Roller and makes fun of you you just pack the old burden right up to a certain mountain called Calvary and pray for them again he said when the Yol is line with joy and peace and sweetness of Christ in your heart so what's it aligned with the fruits of the spirit it's aligned with love and joy and peace and sweetness he said then you just pick up all the burdens the World cast on you oh we get burdens don't we yeah we don't we we're not free from burdens but he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light so we just pick up all the burdens the World cast on us and bear them to a certain Hill called Calvary and there you kneel down and pray for that one that was persecuting you not rain fire out of heaven and tear up the church but bring peace to them God be merciful to them God help us to be like that see the main spring keeps you on course and in God's time now do can I have just a few more minutes you're all doing good tonight haven't put anybody to sleep yet so we're all right now Paul the Apostle Paul faced an uncertain Journey at towards the end of his life he had to go to Rome he knew he had to go to Rome and he chose to go he didn't have to go but he had to go he had to go up to Jerusalem and then they were going to arrest him and they were going to go to Rome and he was told by prophecy that he was going to be arrested and that he was going to be imprisoned and he said I I don't know what is ahead of me he said only I've heard these prophecies but none of these things move me all right I love that not even the prophecy that come forth that said don't go up right cuz the prophesied were telling him the the prophets of that day were telling him don't go up and they were real prophets but he had a will of God in his life something that had to happen yeah he knew he would probably end up in Chains he knew he was going to get arrested but he had to go because he knew that God had called him to stand before Caesar all right and so he had to go he had an uncertain Journey but he had the main spring he said none of these things move me neither count I my life dear un myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God listen Paul wrote Philippians from a prison cell right the whole I I can't even imagine preaching a sermon from prison right because so many times we preach what we feel that's just true you you preach you know out of your own Spirit you preach and and you try not to do that every time you try to get in the spirit of Christ but many times we preach someone said don't get in the flesh well we're in the flesh but hopefully the main spring is what's controlling us controlling that flesh but Paul's in prison think about his his environment think about the the atmosphere of the prison that'll bring you down look it brought John the Baptist so far down that he didn't know if Christ was real or not if he was the one or not he was the one who told him who he was he was the one the Revelation came to and he said still still said are you the one or should we look for another why because he he his Eagle Eye got filmed over in the prison but Paul had something John didn't have John was the greatest of the Old Testament prophets but Paul had something John didn't have what did he have the mainspring he had the Holy Ghost and he writes Philippians from prison and in that book he acknowledges the difficulty he acknowledges the circumstances but the circumstances did not control who he was and look what he says towards the end of that letter Philippians 4:4 he said rejoice in the lord always yeah his feet are Shackled yeah his hands are are are bound he just maybe barely able to write or dictate to someone else to write his eyes had a problem with his eyes historians saying in his eyes it was hard to read he said you see how large a letter I'm writing to you words I write with big he wrote with big letters because all those words that he wrote that we have in the Bible I'm thankful he wrote it aren't you I'm thankful that he wrote this but he wrote it through great difficulty great physical difficulty and yet he wrote he said rejoice rejoice in the lord always amen we get to preach a whole sermon on that he said again I say rejoice see Paul knew what it was like to worship when he was physically bound but his Spirit was free he was physically in an atmosphere of torture an atmosphere of cold an atmosphere where they didn't take care of his physical needs but in in his Spirit he was still warm even though it might have been cold in the prison but it was warm on the inside and he said I'm telling you rejoice if I can write this from a prison you can sit on your on on a comfortable seat on a Wednesday night and rejoice rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice he knew what it was like to worship when he had no reason to worship but God was still worthy hey man why he had the main spring Philippians 4:6 again written from prison be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God that word careful means anxious concerned don't worry people are so worried they're going to get deceived or somebody's going to misuse them or something's going to happen don't worry but God will take care of you be careful for nothing but in everything someone say everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus what was Paul doing he knew what he was writing about how did he know that there was peace that pass his understanding because he couldn't understand why he had the peace that he did in the prison but he had it anyway sometimes I don't understand why the peace of God floods my soul in a moment of trial but I know it has to be the main spring and I'm sure all of you have experienced the same thing why do we keep going to that House of God why do we keep pressing on because of the mainspring Hallelujah see people who don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't know what they're missing people who haven't been sealed by God by the spirit of God they don't know what they're missing they don't realize and sometimes I think we who have it we don't appreciate it enough because we know that that without it we would be just like everybody else we would we would be in and out and up and down not know who we were but the Holy Spirit revealed to us who we are sir amen and I don't mean the body can't question the flesh can't question the mind doesn't question sure it does but there's a mainspring now that keeps you Philippians 4:8 finally Brethren oh my after you've made your requests known and the peace of God will keep your hearts keep your minds finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatever things are on honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely soever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things oh again how's he writing that well because he's sitting in prison casting down thoughts imaginations right actively casting down the fear of that rat that wanted to nibble on his toes right think about it he's sitting there actively having to put that out of his mind that rat was going to be back that that that the cold was still going to be there the dark the loneliness he's actively putting that out Roman prisons were no fun you can go to Rome and see and I think I may have showed it to you before but there's like a hole in the ground and that's where they say Paul was kept it's it's it's hard to even imagine it's hard to even imagine what he went through and it's during those times when he's writing to you see God put you through things for a reason he let you go through things for a reason why so you can help other people and so Paul's sitting there thinking I'm going to think the things that are true I'm going to think the things that are honest I'm going to trust God even though he knew he was probably going to get his head chopped off that was the best case scenario that could happen to Paul because Christians during that that time listen to me he could smell Christians burning right that's history Nero put took Christians alive covered them in oil and lit them on fire and used them as torches in his garden and Paul's sitting in the prison smelling the burning flesh of Christians he says Rejoice always whatever's true whatever's honest whatever's just whatever is pure you realize he wrote Romans 13 I believe it is from there 12 or 13 where he says he says the the the the powers that be are only put there by God right and you should be subject to the higher power let every soul be subject to the higher power he wrote that when Nero was the higher power that takes a mainspring church right see brother BR said may you thoroughly understand that it isn't Church it isn't intellectuals it isn't knowing the Bible it isn't any of these things it's God's love the holy spirit in the middle of that spirit that you quit drinking and quit smoking and quit lying then God's holy spirit in that Spirit begins to make it work just exactly right he said then love then you're on the mountain top all the time whether things are coming right or going right you still got the victory he said live or die why when they was going to cut Paul's head off he said I fought a good fight finished the course kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness or he said the the righteous judge will give me it that day not only me but all those that love his appearing and the grave looked back at him and death looked back at him and said Paul we're going to have you in a few minutes but that main spring was still ticking he's oh I feel like running and shouting tonight that main spring was still ticking he said death where is your sting grave where is your Victory show me where you can scare me yeah show me where you can make me listen to this important make me take the cross off because he wanted to get Paul if Paul all you'd have to do is say well I don't believe that no more I'm not part of that group and he could have walked away from all of his troubles how many people have done that how many people used to sit Among Us have done that just announce the message and you could walk away just say it it wasn't real or you just don't believe it no more and walk away come on and all the persecution leaves and suddenly you're just able to live and do Paul could have done that but he said death you can't scare me all right yeah show me where you can make me take the cross off why because I got the spirit of Christ in me and they beat him and they they tortured him and they they he dragged across he was so weak that someone else had to carry his cross but it's still he still made it to Calvary show me where you can make me take the cross off devil can do a lot of things but he can't make you give up yes only you can do that he can't make you give up I'm so glad of that he said show me where you can make me take the cross off but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to address this and we'll close the gifts in our lives will not operate correctly without the mainspring Romans 11:29 tells us the gifts and callings of God are without repentance in other words we had them before we were even saved right if it's a gift a predestined gift and there's other gifts that fall among the audience among people but a predestined gift or calling of God is without repentance but brand said your gift of tongues wonderful justification by faith wonderful sanctification fine speaking in tongues wonderful interpretation fine messages from God wonderful prophecy fine he said brother if it hasn't got no Hub in it what's it going to amount to your spokes will get across one another they'll cross up all those gifts right fuss fight isolate Chaw tear on up each one one another you said brother Ben but I'm spiritual God speaks to me but your maybe your spokes got crossed up are you with me now I I I I believe God speaks to me too but but but I I got to be careful to make sure there's love there or that gift can actually be a hindrance to me even the gift of a Preacher because I can use it in the wrong way right right it's just I have to stay humble to his will I've got to let the mainspring control it and so he said they'll cross up and fuss and fight and isolate and Chaw and tear on up each one another that's what's the matter he said we need the main spring what good does it do to have the little bitty Springs the little bitty gadgets in there and the winding Springs and the alarms and the faces and the big hands all this thing if there isn't something in there to make it operate listen to me love will make the video room operate right love will make the piano operate right love makes the organ operate right love makes the pews operate right love will make the Sunday School operate right what is it it takes love the mainspring The Hub on the inside takes the love of God to make things operate takes the love of God to make your home operate what good are all the little bitty gadgets what good as our our high dollar drum said if it's not for love if there's not somebody who loves God playing it are you with me now what good are any of the instruments what good is it if if we don't have the love of God what good are deacons and trustees in church order if we don't have a self-winding watch with love at the center of it that's good now watch he said the love of God God is love unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of love it'll become selfish and indifferent and pull itself off listen brother BR said elect does not persecute elect John Wesley uh Martin Luther none of them they never pulled themselves off from the church they were kicked out they never pulled themselves off why because that's not the nature of Christ the nature of Christ is reconciliation but the brandom kept going back to the Pentecostal people but they closed the doors he said when it's anchored right in the middle of Love it'll Fellowship everywhere yes oh that's the way I want to be yes this watch is self-winding brother brand in one place calls it God winding he said you don't have to wind it every day God wound it once for all and it set right in the middle of your new life as a mainspring as it relieves and ticks away the watch it controls every little organism of that watch to perfect time when the Holy Spirit he said not the new degree not the new church not the new thought not the new emotion not the new oil not the new dance not the new lips not the new tongue not the new this not the new that hat he says but when God places his spirit in the middle of your new spirit you don't have to act Meek you don't have to act like a Christian it controls everything that's within you it puts you decent makes the church act orderly makes the gifts work perfect and if you have to be taken from a place oh this gets sticky now he said from where you think you should be and put down somewhere else it controls you huh that's when you see people when you have to to move people around positions in the church you begin to find out who has the main spring and I thank God I found many of people here have the mainspring because we've changed a lot of things but the mainspring still holds aren't you glad for that I'm so thankful for that I can't imagine pastoring a church full of a bunch of people with no love no Holy Ghost no seal it'd be awful I'm glad we got a main spring not flopping so in other words you take the main spring out there I watch just loose you know just go those all those gears go any direction he said not flopping I'll never come back again no sir that shows that main Spring's not in there he said when you blow up at every little thing that happens watch what he says poisons that disposition see you you have a disposition a new spirit but it's got to have his Spirit on the inside or you'll get poisoned by things that happen he said when the pastor happens to hit something that's in the word you I can't do it like brother brandom I don't believe that he said ' look out old cowhide he said that not me said see watch out the new main spring hasn't been set in there right yet oh my I'm closing musicians go ahead and come but the brand said the main Springs what kept Him when his wife and daughter died that's tough when you're a a preacher especially one who believes in Divine Healing and you lose your closest loved ones to sickness right but the main spring held you look at the tragedy in brother bram's family with his mother and father and with his siblings with with his wife and his daughter and finally in his own life and Pentecostals looked at that and said he was cursed I say the main spring [Music] help the devil might be trying to tell you you're cursed might be trying to tell you that if you were a real see to God if you were really a Christian things wouldn't go the way they they've gone listen all that are in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution some of you have been through some things you've lost some loved ones you know what that's like but the main spring holds The Anchor Holds spite of every storm that come through he said he stood there and as his daughter died and he said it's like a black sheep come in between him and the devil come to him he said it was too late to tell me God wasn't real but he tried to tell me he said God don't love you don't you realize that devil trying to tell you the same thing he's trying to tell you God don't love you he's trying to tell you the people don't love you and it's the devil yeah it's the devil and and here here he's standing in that place and he says he he said I I had to agree with him intellectually he said but there was something on the inside that said though he slay me yet I'll TR trust him and he give his daughter to God his wife to God he said a a state senator asked him he talk by the side of the road as he was there in the cemetery and asked him he said Bill he said what held you he said did your religion hold he said he said uh did you hold your religion he said no I didn't hold my religion My Religion held me what was it the mainspring that was still tightly wound on the inside that steel that you can't put there he has to put it there yes Paul asked the question what can separate us from mainspring the love of God he said nothing nothing we are we ought to hear it tonight nothing yeah nothing can separate what do he say things past things present things future nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us mainspring keeps the clock ticking right would you bow your head with me for just a moment those of you that are watching I know many are watching tonight and you're doing the best you can to have church there in your home if you just quiet down for just a moment just think about it does the main spring still hold is there still something there that keeps you you ticking I believe there is why don't you just let him have full control of your life tonight if you've never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of the Holy Ghost is time yes well we're living in too late of an hour to play Church you need the Bane spring to come in and and make it where you don't want to do those things anymore it's not a fight anymore to come to the house of God but you got that flesh under control sure it still gets tired sure there's something that that that that that'll make it make it try to pull you away but you won't let it there'll be something on the inside of you that won't let it CU it's the main spring controls every emotion I say God help me to have that in my life I want it I want to surrender more to it if that's your prayer would you raise your hands to him and wherever you're at raise your hands to him and and just say Lord I want I want you more in my life increase yourself in my life let this self- winding watch brother brand said in one place that the watch was wound he said by our response to the word oh let me have the right response Lord let me be someone who who Lord that that can be wound tight that self- winding watch on the inside of my life Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I love you thank you for being here with me Lord thank you Lord for I thank you for saving me I thank you for keeping me Lord I Thank you for keeping these people through the years lord it's only the mainspring that holds I pray God that you would just move in a mighty way tonight I pray Lord that every house and every situation Lord you'd bring peace Lord I know I don't Pastor a bunch of angels but Lord I believe I Pastor some people that are filled with the Holy Ghost I pray you'd bless them Lord pray you'd help them to surrender to the will of the main spring Lord you are the whe in the middle of the wheel Lord may may you guide every one of our actions every one of our thoughts Lord until that day you call us home we love you today we thank you I thank you Lord every service Lord I

your feet I pray you granted today we love you we thank you for doing it for us we thank you for the Holy Ghost thank you for leadership Lord in our lives we love you in Jesus name amen hallelujah
