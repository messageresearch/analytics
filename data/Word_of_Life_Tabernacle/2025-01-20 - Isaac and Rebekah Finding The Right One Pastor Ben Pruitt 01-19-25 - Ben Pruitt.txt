that I offended by calling you old earlier y'all if you feel young just ENT right and uh this might all be for you tonight man if you're young at heart we appreciate our elders but we sure appreciate our young people in this wonderful youth group we've got coming up and I guess I'll go ahead and remind you that if you're not signed up for uh the Oklahoma Youth Camp and you want want us to help you with that we're more than more than happy to do it for you amen looking forward to that I think last we checked we had about 14 saying they were going so it's going to be a nice little youth group over there pray for me if I'm one of the drivers and we love our young people don't we would you give them a big hand we love our young people and we want to do all we can to see our young people filled with the Holy Ghost and running with this message and there's going to be young men man when believe it or not I might get old and then one of these days you know your pastor he's talking about death this morning he going to get old and then one of these young men might be the the minister to take this message to the last seed just imagine that and you say well is it possible yes because brother brandom said there would be young men that would take this message on until the coming of the Lord amen so let's encourage our young people tonight show them how to pull on a preacher if you can amen as the minister comes let's just sing it like this we walk in the light it's such a beautful life and it comes where the D Drops of mercies are bright won't you shine all around us by Day end

like to make known by wave uplifted hand God knows every heart aren't you glad he knows your heart and knows what you're dealing with Heavenly Father we see these hands tonight Lord people I don't know what the situations are but you do I pray God that you'd move for those situations every every one of them Lord Lord whether it's Financial or spiritual or maybe a need Lord a question they need to answered I Lord you could you could move me out of the way and speak to that person today and I pray that you would do it Lord maybe you'd speak in some other way in their life I pray God that you'd do that today we thank you for your word thank you for the the the word that washes us from the filth of Babylon Lord to be that bride that you called out to live in that city thank you for it today I pray you'd help me today give me strength and ability to to speak to these young people and old alike I pray you to help us today we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn with me to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 22 I'm going to speak to you tonight on Isaac and Rebecca finding the right one Genesis chapter 2 and verse 22 and this won't just apply to to young people apply to our elders as well especially those who uh sometimes uh are about to get married it's not just young people they get married it's sometimes Elders as well and then if you are married and have children it'll apply to you as well because you know how to deal with that with your children we're going to do with that as well and there's biblical things about that that we can do to help our children because we sure want them to find the right one amen so I got all your attention tonight all the young people's attention and everybody's awake and ready to hear the word you ready hear the word tonight Genesis chapter 2 verse 22 appreciate you sitting up front guys it means a lot to me Genesis 2:22 the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so she was part of him and he separated her from him and then brought her back to him and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife they shall be one flesh I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated a man named John Wesley had a famously unhappy marriage he uh met his wife Mary when he was taken to her house after spraining his ankle and uh somebody knews that she was a Believer and she lived nearby and so they they took uh him to her house and she cared for him nursed him back to health and he was so pleased with the way that she took care of him that he just thought it was the Lord he said this just Lord just put us together and and we're going to be happy and he was an older man at that time he wasn't real young should have known better he didn't ask nobody he just married her and his brother actually knew her and if he'd have asked it Charles would have told him that this woman had a temper problem and uh uh so he he was so uh pleased with the way she took care of him that she he just married her and he really thought it was the Lord and it may have been God God sure allowed it but if God wants us to be happy surely John Wesley did that to himself you know CU he was not happy in that marriage in fact that famously she drugg him around the house by by his head by his hair and he had a little bit longer hair and she took him and Drug him around the house so you don't want a marriage like that at all but it just proves that good men Godly men can make mistakes in that and and women as well and and we need to make sure we find the right one and we talked last time we talked about this I talked to young people about about uh how we date and court or whatever you want to call it and everything that we do like that but I don't want to deal with that so much this time I want to deal with who who who we find mind because that's much more important than how and brother brand deals with that a whole lot more and the Bible deals with that a lot more than than how deals with who because you might be able to overcome a mistake when it comes to dating or courting but you will not overcome a mistake when it comes to marrying the wrong one it's a knot that can only be untied in another world or in the Millennium it can't be untied here once it's done it's done so it's a very important thing we don't believe in divorce we we just don't believe in it and so we we believe that if God puts you together you stay together you work that out and that doesn't mean it's the unpardonable sin but we just don't even present that as an option right right we don't present that as an option we want you to stay married so in Matthew chapter 19 and verse3 uh Jesus talks about that he said the Pharisees came to him tempting him and said to him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and uh cuz they had made it where it was lawful if she burned your dinner you could put her away and Jesus said no he said he answered have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh you can't put away your flesh your own bones you can't do that if you were one you can't put that away he said wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put us under so what God puts together don't let any man separate that so what does God join together I believe if you're married you should believe like Wesley that God has put you with your current spouse right and I mean that's you say well you know I can't believe God put me with my current spouse because she's hard on me but the BR said don't turn down your spouse because she's got a temper it's actually a direct quote he said maybe God put you together God put Moses and his wife together and you know and excuse me for the plain language but we're not dealing with The Village Idiot we're talking about God right sometimes you got to be playing with the the young people so you understand it but we're not we're talking about God God knows what he's doing right he's able to put you at the right one so I've always told married people say well am I married to the right one absolutely why would you believe anything else right work on what you got try to look at somebody else work on the marriage that you have but if you're if you're unmarried if you've made no vows your spouse could be anyone anywhere of the opposite sex when I put that in there I thought I don't have to say that yeah we do it's a stupid world it really is but you're not going to marry if you're a man you don't get to marry a man that's not marriage they they they'll give you a license today because people are insane but that's not marriage yeah right and and so it could be anyone anywhere and and we find Isaac and Rebecca like they didn't know each other but they were meant for one another there aren't many low stories in the Bible as far as how they met and things like that but Isaac and Rebecca is the exception to that it tells us all about it so we have characters in the story we have Abraham Isaac the servant The Trusted servant who elaser you know who he is but he's not named in the story Rebecca uh bethu who was Rebecca's father uh because if you get married you marry the whole family so we know uh Rebecca's mother was there it talks about her mother but she's unnamed and and then her brother nahor her brother and the story opens with Abraham's concern for his son to find a proper wife and we know that Isaac at this point you know he it's about time for him to get out of the house he's 40 years old so some of y'all got time yet you know to get married most of our our young people are young real young so you're not even at this point but I want you to be thinking about it and and preparing for it when's the time to start preparing now get ready and because one day he will come and he'll come before you know it so uh here Abraham's ready for Isaac to get out of the house and uh he's ready for him to get out of his basement you know and and move on with his life so he says Isaac needs a wife so he's interested in that and I'll say to us parents we didn't take an interest in our children right and and their lives to make sure that we're promoting the best interest of our children so and we know that Isaac in in that Society Isaac wouldn't have taken part in decisions affecting the household until he got married so in order for him to inherit he had to get married that's why elaser is still in charge of of everything Abraham has even though Isaac is 40 years old because he had to get married in order to take on the the headship in the home and so and Abraham knows he's fixing to pass away he's getting old and so he said it's time for some grandkids you know and we got to keep this line going so and he sends him out now the first point I want to make to you if you're making notes or want to write it down you can write this down the right one is a believer I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this cuz we've talked about it before poor but the right one is a Believer look what Abraham tells elzer the servant he he said I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife un my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go into my country to my Kindred and take a wife into my son Isaac but the brandom tells us that no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances you should always marry Believers now you might say well I met this girl and and oh my uh you know like John Wesley boy she she's just so nice and so wonderful and she just uh you know her eyes are so pretty and her hair is so pretty and and maybe she's not a Believer you say well how you know I just fell in love with her that's fine it's wonderful you say Stars shot off and fireworks and love it first sight and it's just wonderful okay invite her to church invite him to church don't date him don't go out with him or her until they're a Believer until you know that they come and they didn't just come for you yeah right because that could happen because if they don't have a habit of going to church and don't know anything about what you believe and and you get married then all of a sudden things uh everything's a problem so do that you say well sometimes it works out absolutely it does thank God for Grace thank God for grace that it does work out sometimes but the rule is marry a Believer yes right that's what we're supposed to do because Paul says be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion light with Darkness not everybody that goes to church is a Believer right marry somebody like you and I want to get a little bit into that because a church is a good spot to find a spouse so he tells he tells uh uh he tells elther you're going to have to take a trip right to go and find this this woman who who will be like Isaac who will think like him who'll be a part of my family but just because they go to church doesn't make them a Believer right what what what are their goals what do they want out of life what are they filled with the Holy Ghost do they love the Lord or are they just in church are they in church because they have a drug problem and their parents drug them to church or are they in church because they want to be in the house of God what what what do they want out of life Isaac wasn't just anybody he he was a sourer with Abraham looking for a city right he wasn't just another guy he was special I want to tell you young people well you're special and that's why it matters who you marry because you're special you're going to bring on that next Generation if there is one and so you didn't come up in just any household you come up in a Abraham Faith household you come you come up as a Seed of Abraham and so you you don't want to just marry any kind of person you want to look at what does this person share my vision for life right do they are they somebody who uh who wants to go to church and wants to live for God and so you want to deal with that you don't find that out after you get married or after you get engaged find that out before find out what kind of person that is so and you know if you're a person that goes to church every time the doors open and you marry somebody who's comes to church when they feel like it there's going to be a conflict there yes right if you take the message seriously you marry somebody who also takes it seriously it's not the time a marriage is not the place you want to fix people and help people marriage is not the place to do that right find somebody who's stronger than you and or or at least as strong as you are in those things because you're going to find out there's going to be times you're going to have to drag them to church and they're going to have to drag you to church and there's going to be times you have to do that so so do that yeah marry somebody like that it's not the time to try to fix somebody say well they got a problem and if I married them they'd be better off don't do that because you find out most of the time what'll happen is they'll drag you down you won't help them they just makes you weaker instead of you coming together and making each other stronger we'll get off of that what else can we learn from Isaac and Rebecca that we learn that the right one is approved by Godly Parents I'm gonna get in a sticky situation here but just bear with me I put Godly as a modifier there on purpose because parents aren't always Godly and as parents and we need to be careful who we disapprove and who we approve we need to our kids do have to make their own decision right but we do need to be careful that we uh if we're Godly Parents we're going to we're going to approve somebody because of the word we're going to give advice based on the word not just based on whether this person is going to be a millionaire or not you know and uh CU we don't know that many times anyway we don't find our children's spouses just not the way it's done to day boy I wish it was you know you just go out there and you know send my servant out and we're going to go find a spouse when they're 40 years old you know I wish don't you wish it work like that but Logan just just figured to send them out and do that but we don't do that anymore they have to make a decision but we should give counsel and listen to me young people if you're smart how many smart young people do we have here boy I saw you raise your hand look at that all right yeah it's all right got some smart young people smart dress Young young people up here in the front row hey if you're smart you will listen to your parents right it's true if you're smart come on some of you Elders help me out if you're smart you'll listen to your parents and all of us sitting there saying wish we' to listen to our parents you know but that's part of you know as as you got to realize if you're smart that your parents could know something you don't know and they can't make a decision for you but they can help you they can help you and they want to help you they're not in it listen they didn't you're not just another something they own you you're their life and and they don't just pay the bills for you for no reason there's a reason why they haven't kicked you out of the house yet cuz they love you and they care about you and so listen to them and again there will be times where you there will be times in your life where you feel like they're they're wrong boy if I had a dollar for every time I thought my dad was wrong you know and sometimes he was yeah many times he was but I still had to listen yeah you still need to listen because chances are he's going to find something going to have something that he knows and and there were things that he said that were true that happened and and I and I wish I had have listen to some things not many but some things but if you got Godly Parents listen to your parents now as a parent if if your kid won't listen to you just will not listen to you we need to examine ourselves sometimes right and say is there a reason for that right because as Abraham as Abraham's seed we got to lead our children right we want to do that how many parents want to lead their children right and and so we want to do like Abraham has sent and and and find help them find the right spouse and help them in their schoolwork and help them in their life and help them guide them towards the right kind of a job or something like that but you've got to got them towards the right kind of a church and the right kind of belief and all of those things but if they just will not listen to us they just won't listen to nothing we say it could be a rebellious Spirit but it could be that we just we're maybe we're not living exactly what we're talking about and nobody knows that better than kids all right right so if the kids won't listen to you way is there a reason and it may not be but always examine yourself H we need somebody who will do that lead your children right brother brand says this about he said keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with a boy see that she keeps with the right kind of a boy discourage her to any boy otherwise look at the language he uses discourage her so many times we want to stand up here and be a dictator but what you got is a budding adult they're not adults yet their brain's not even fully developed right but you're not going to be able to just dictate to them especially when they get to be 16 17 years old you're just not going to be able to stand there and say thus saith the parent they're just not going to listen to you all the time right and so what do you do at that point you have to have built enough influence that they want to listen to you that if there's a Christian in the world my parents a Christian my dad's a Christian now they have an obligation to Listen by the word let me say this the worst way to get respect is to command it D I'm just going to give you respect just cuz you said so that's what we want to do cuz I said so all right right but there needs to be something backing that up a life remember demons I know we don't think of our children as demons but demons don't even leave just cuz you said so do you know that remember the seven sons of ska they went down there and and they said we're we cast you out in the name of Paul you know and in the name of the Jesus Paul preaches they said we don't even know who you are huh they tore them all up and sent them back crying but and you remember the disciples when went on to heal the the case of epilepsy they couldn't heal the boy and here uh here comes uh uh here come or the dog the the girl and here comes Jesus but man said he he said that demon knew the life right that Jesus lived and because he saw that life he said he when he saw that he said that's what caused him to leave when he commanded it and so how do we expect if a demon won't even leave based on just you telling them to without they being a life to back it up what about our children yeah they're not going to just listen to you because because of who you are you got to have something to back that up maybe that's not the best analogy but brother B said discourage her look at that language discourage her to any boy otherwise her boy to a girl she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa make your home nice make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house and make homes so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there that's a challenge to us parents you want your kids to listen to you let them have a home some place they can go to because it's not enough just to say go beat your head against the wall and sit in your room and stay on your phone no there's got to be some place that they enjoy being and I think that ought to be our house and and if they're under 18 and under our roof we have veto power over who they choose to hang out with we do but we use wisdom with that right guide them the right direction uh you find that in the story of Rebecca brandham nearing 18 years old as she gets close to 18 brother Brandon realizes he got to take his hands off and pray and deal with this in a spiritual way now because she's getting old enough that she's going to leave anyway right so so and listen to me listen to me I've seen this over the years I've watched churches where people and I'm not putting that off on any of our churches here but watch churches where people every kid as soon as they turn 18 they go out in the world every one of them there's a reason for that yeah there's a reason for that homes aren't nice Church isn't nice brother Ivy told us years ago he said you know he said they make it where the kids are uh they said uh go get out of sight and out of mind he said and as soon as they got old enough to leave they left if you don't care about them show you show them you care about them they will leave so you got to use wisdom with that but listen young people listen to your parents look what proverb says about a son listening to his father and mother said my son keep thy father's commandment forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thine heart tie them about thy neck s of a neck tie you put on your Commandments you know what your mother and father have taught you yes when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee listen parents don't get discouraged all the things that you said and the things you stood for over the years one day it's going to come around and they're going to remember what you taught them they may leave for a while but the Bible said if you train them up in the way they should go when they are old they will not depart from it that's a promise he said when it go when th goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee when thou wakest it shall talk with thee you always have that voice in your head you think well when I leave home I'll get away from that no it'll always be there why because your parents were teaching you the truth the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light proofer instruction of the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman there's evil people out there evil men and women are everywhere get all the advice you can yeah in Proverbs 625 he goes on to say lust not after her beauty in thine art in thy heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids that's why they color their eyelid you know B their eyes at you huh try they put that stuff brother man called it Gang Green put that over their eyelids and bat their eyes you know what's the reason we don't do that yeah right the Bible says a bad woman will do that an evil woman yes right and you you get your eyes you know Woman Like That B their eyes at you and think oh my that's my future what spouse what that is is the devil maybe not her but but the what the spirit that's behind her right and it says the adulterous will hunt for the precious life oh my uh so you need to take Godly Parents advice I know it's slow tonight but I just got to do this I got to get through it so just hang with me take a pastor's advice and this is sticky because I have no control over who anyone in this church courts or marries and I don't want that kind of obligation or responsibility but I will tell you what I think if you ask yeah yeah and it'd be good if we'd ask you say why do you do that I've been told I don't have a right to do that why do you do that well brother brandom did it set that example yeah the Bible sets that example for ministers do you know that brother brandom said not long ago there was a little girl back there at the Tabernacle my church she was a sweet little old girl little Christian girl she was running around with some little old boy who packed a flask in his pocket and smoked cigarettes he said I couldn't see nothing in the boy myself tried for two or three years to get him to be a Christian but he wouldn't do it and I asked her I said sis what do you see in that boy you know what kind of answer she give me said like some of these Bobby sock kids today she said brother brandom said he just got such cute little [Laughter] [Music] feet and he smells so good he's so cute I hear that my girls all the time they're so cute well that's not a reason to get married young people say amen just cuz he smells good well he smells good cuz he went down and bought out the the cologne the cheap cologne aisle on at Walmart he won't smell good for long except for trip trip where's really good cologne I wish I could afford it now he said brother I thought what a to pick a husband and I said you say well Pastor you out of line when you say anything about who we're going to marry brother BR said it I said I'd rather marry a man that was a Christian had feet like a box car smelled like a pole cat if he was a Christian yes you want the right one the right one's a Christian yes by the blood of he said by the blood of Christ we're saved I love this he said hallelujah what a what a what a something drop in right here at the end he will make a living for you and be a gentleman if he's saved come on young people you girls going to look for somebody and say well you know so and so's got cute feet huh if he's saved huh he may not have cute feet but if he's saved he'll make a living for you yes yeah if you don't have a job you got no business looking for a wife until he looks for a job I'm telling you the truth speaking to my kids my kids are some of the oldest young people so y'all hear me you don't have any business getting engaged to a girl unless you got a job it doesn't have to be a great job well when we we got engaged my wife and I got engaged I worked at Burger King but I worked huh you don't have to be a great job might be a lot of money but I worked my wife's never never worked in the workplace and I say that not to brag but God's always provided for us now by the time I got married I had to get serious and I had a had three jobs I was preaching full time and and we end up pastoring a church at branville so I preach full-time and I the bill remembers those days and also worked at a title company during the week and I worked at Burger King on Saturdays so I was working I was working three jobs because I knew I had to provide for my wife I just I never questioned that yeah and you young people did excuse me for being on a tantrum but young men question that like well you know if we split everything up and we all go down to bills come on young man be a man come on right you you got to you you have to be a man I'm turning into by the window up here but be a man and pay the bills and it's nothing wrong with a wife helping if she needs to help brother brandom taught us that there's nothing wrong with a wife helping if she needs to help but it the right the way it ought to be is our wives wouldn't have to to work right because the man provides so well marry a provider brother says if he's a Christian brother made a link between that why because the word says if you won't provide for your own you're worse than an Infidel and I've come down kind of hard on that but some of our and I'm proud of our young men I get tithes from our young men that work 16 17 years old you I salute you for that young men doing all you can to find a job and right now it's really difficult to find a job but make sure you're stable in that before you get married or propose to somebody so now you're going to take care of if you're saved and you'll be a gentleman again brother Brown said some little old girl he's telling the same story tells it a little bit different way he said started going with some little old shrimp I've met some of them shrimps I met them shrimps haven't I yesterday I met them little shrimps some little shrimp downtown here smoke cig ett had a flask in his pocket he drove a little Roadster around town he said I couldn't see what she seen in that boy he wouldn't come to church he'd sit out here put her in the church out here and he'd sit out there on the outside in his car and wait wouldn't come in church I said to her one day she lived in New Albany I said I want to ask you something girly what in the world do you see in that boy I said in the first place he hates the very religion you have he despises your Christ but the Brandon was blunt about this he would never make you a husband he'd make you miserable all your life I said well there's a final little Christian boys here you could go with there's your daddy and mother despises the thoughts you going out but you go anyhow you think I'm sweet 16 he said she started wearing makeup and running out first thing she was in roadh houses listen girls you don't have to wear makeup to be pretty come on we have the prettiest girls in the world and maybe I need to tell that to the guys too you know we're the most handsome men in the world you know but you don't have to you don't have to look like a a one of guys you know that all muscled up and everything I you look like that if you want to but you don't have to my wife thinks I'm a real man not because of my muscles it is true not because of my muscles not because I go to the gym and there nothing wrong with that if you want to work out and make good big old muscle that's fine but that's not you know bodily exercise profits a little it profits a little right but she thinks I'm a real man because I take care of her but she thinks I'm a real man don't beat on her right if you if you if you got a problem with temper don't get married like that get past that if you beat on your wife you don't deserve to be married you deserve to be in jail since we're just being being blunt about things we'll do that today man that would raise his hand to a woman doesn't deserve a wife absolutely you need to repent yes we don't we're not do that you don't you don't do that you don't even beat on your kids yeah right if you whip your kids you do that right spank your kids right we believe in spanking but we don't believe in beating on kids it's abuse yeah and boy I got down a rabbit hole there be a real man he said but you know what excuse he said she give for that little boy he said she was in Roadhouse she's gone to Eternity now said but you know what excuse she gave me he's got such cute little feet he smells so good said could you imagine that perfuming himself up he said that's a not a man the bar was pretty blunt I said sister I'd rather go with the Christian boy had feet like gravel cars and smelled like a p cat he was absolutely a Christian he said it's excuse such cute little feet smell so good the little Roadhouse Runner he said finally ruined the life of the girl it's a shame disgraceful how many young people have I talked to and tried to tell them it's not going to work that's that's bad situation and and they go right into it anyway and can't say I didn't warn you yeah and then they come back to church years later and they can't get remarried yeah or have a difficult time getting remarried whatever that it is I'm not judging you if if you if you're caught in marriage and divorce it's not what this is about we want to tell our children the truth says in that sermon he said teach your children the truth right so you know you may been different for you but teach your children the truth and and you'll find them all broke up and everything else because they didn't listen to Somebody God help us to listen help us to have a a a repentant heart listen to Young People I love it when you come to the Altar and and and seek for the Lord because it tells me there's softness there and as as older people we don't need to ever discourage that we don't need to ever discourage that some of us need to be in the altar sometimes well we don't need that anymore you needed it when you were young and you probably need it today we need to be soft we need to we need to be we need to something needs to prick our hearts once in a while don't ever get away from that good you keep on doing it and brother brand says marriage is Honorable it should be entered prayerfully and reverently in genuine love for that woman he said we'll bind you together forever when you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven when you walk down the street Yonder she may get old and gray and wrinkled but that same love you had for her when she was a young beautiful woman you'll still have it you may get stoop shouldered baldheaded my wife didn't think it happen so fast but stoop shouldered baldheaded wrinkled faed and everything else but she she'll love you just like you did when you stood with wide shoulders and curly hair if it's really God you're looking to the time when you've crossed the river Yonder when you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever he said that's God's Eternal promise listen to me I I got to hit this because you'll hear it out there say well a pastor has no business giving advice to a young couple if a pastor can advise you on the most important decision ever make what is his job exactly yeah right second Timothy 4:2 says preach the word be instant in season not all the preaching we do is in the Pulpit right out of season but but trip and brother sister Esther and brother Peter and all of you young people know that if you've been in my house much you know I'll preach to them sometimes and why because I'm trying to lead them in the right direction I want to see them I want to see them grow up and be be strong young men and women and people that serve God and love God I don't want to see one of them lost I got a a conviction in my heart that we're not going to lose another generation of young people come on Church let's let's not just let it go let's let's let them see God in us and do what it takes to see them make it we don't have time it's too late to be losing another generation let's see them Reach that age and and continue on with the Lord put some take some interest in their life amen again he told tells the pastor that we exort you Brethren warn them that are unruly that's not a pastor's job what is yeah Comfort the feeble minded support the weak be patient toward all men that's part of it being patient as well this is our job brother BR said so many people were asking me questions about marriage and divorce and so forth he said which is a tangle in the church he said always refer them back say ask your pastor people wrote me letters here and say what about this what about that refer the letter back you'll get it see your pastor on little things because after all he's your Shepherd he's the one God God sent to watch over you again not a dictator right you don't have to take the advice but at least ask you might know something you don't about that person and it don't mean you won't disagree with him you couldn't be wrong he's human he don't have any Authority in those things that no legal Authority tell you what to do but he's equipped to tell you the truth right brother B said so I'd rather your pastor tell about marriage and divorce and these things and things let him do it he said he's God's servant too and he's equipped to do that right he said well my pastor's not equipped to do that well i' find somebody else right I'm saying that about me and to my to those that go to church here right if your pastor's not equipped to help you in those those things then he's not equipped at all number three we won't may not have time to get through all these tonight but we'll just we'll just are you doing okay young people still breathing they tell me when you get all excited and stressed out you should do that you know breathe in it's all right you can breathe Esther the right one will be found through prayer yes how many of you that are married know that that's the truth find the right one through prayer you remember El eer got down he got desperate with God he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray you send me good speed this day show kindness unto my master Abraham the BR says you better pray hard before you marry that girl I don't care how pretty she is same thing to to a man again he said there was many women in that City speaking of the city where Rebecca was young girls for him to choose from but he didn't take his own choice he trusted God's choice he took the one that had a supernatural sign a answer to prayer submitted to the Lord Genesis 24:15 the Bible says that when he prayed I love how God works it came to pass before he had done speaking behold Rebecca came out who was born Beth son of milka the wife of nahor Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder God answered his prayer while he was still praying it what do I what does that tell us keep praying until the prayer is answered yes we should pray about that if we pray about anything we ought to pray about this he said if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married when we choose our wife our husband if we'd study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life right and then not just cuz she a bad cook H right if she can't cook you can fix that you could do some of the cooking yourself but if you marry somebody who's rotten in their spirit and their heart you can't fix that only God can fix that a man should pray earnestly he could ruin his entire life Remember The Vow I've heard people say well we can choose a pastor you know I heard somebody say that well we chose a pastor and I when I heard the name I said well we don't even have to pray about that that'll get you in trouble yeah if something ever happens to me you have to choose a pastor better pray it's important yes and he said if he knows what he's making the wrong choice he's Maring a woman isn't fit to be his wife he does it anyhow he said then it's his fault if the woman takes a husband knows he's not fit to be a husband to you and that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly someone say thoroughly thoroughly pray through yes again the right one is a servant to others yeah the right one is a servant to others elaser devises the oddest test he says Lord he said if you know if I found the right one he said let it be the one who gives me water which about anybody would do if you see a thirsty guy you know coming stranger coming off the just Hospitality but then I wanted to be the one who Waters my camels now how how many of you young people before I show you how many how many of you young people know how many camels elar had with him do you know how many camels he had with him she's trying to remember kenedy's heard this he's trying to remember how many camels you have with him 10 10 camels so if you had 10 camels think about this a camel drinks around 35 gallons of water and they've been going through the desert right so they've got 10 camels going through the desert 35 gallons of water and they get up there and he said let the one who's willing to draw 350 gallons of water in a little jug out of a well and pour it out for that's an all day job people it's messy it's hot it's sweaty let let it be the one who volunteers to do that yeah said let that be the one what is it she had a heart for service to a servant you don't want a beauty queen uh you want a servant you don't want a pretty boy you want a servant somebody who's willing to help when you need help huh and the best way if you go to church the best way to do that is to go to the church the church has more function than just we don't just exist I get irritated when people think we just exist for false Doctrine to be preached come on they don't understand what a church is come on huh in a church you find out who people are yeah cuz you're around each other right right and so a lot of times you find out who's willing to help in the kitchen oh it's getting sticky you know who's willing to who's willing to give and give and give and and and has that servant's heart who's willing to help when someone needs help which of them boys is willing to carry more chairs you know that's the test of manhood in in churches is how many chairs you can carry but but but who's who's willing don't have to be told to do that stuff just willing to do it yeah yeah huh who's willing to help out you see them they're always involved they don't have time to talk to you because they're always involved in stuff in the church that's the one that's the right one maybe not the right one for you but the right one for somebody so we got the right kind of attitude and again and the damel he said was very fair to look upon that don't hurt I believe God can give you somebody pretty I thank God he did for me now I'm not sure why that didn't work for my wife but you know God can give you something that's good to look at the damel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray the drink a little water with that picture and she said drink my Lord and she hasted and let down her picture upon her hand give him drink when she'd done giving him drink she said oh by the way I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking at least 320 gallons of water pulled up from a well poured out by hand the person who would do that she's isn't some prissy little girl who's afraid to break a fingernail she's a worker yeah the Bible says that the Elder women in the church ought to teach the younger women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home you know what that word Keepers means it means workers workers at home young man marry a worker young woman marry a worker somebody who's willing to do what needs to be done good obedient to their own husbands at the word of God be not blasphemed listen if she lays let me just get real with you guys if she lays around on her phone all day now and she's always available to talk oh it got quiet huh he's probably not the right one you want somebody who's doing something yeah right if he's always got time to talk chuckle how much people can talk now you know which I guess we did it too you know we we just use landlines you know but I worked I couldn't talk to my wife 24/7 I preached I had to study when we were I stud for sermons while we were going together and courting and and while we were engaged and before we get married I remember at our wedding reception arranging things for the service that weekend at our church finding a preacher and making sure that people somebody was going to be there right that you still do those things you don't just get to sit say well now we're now we're recording someone and we're and now we're not going to do anything else no it's not how it works find somebody if they lay around the house now won't get up in the morning go to work what are they going to do when they get married the same thing yeah now I'm done with that the right one's a servant the right one's under headship yes good the Bible says Rebecca was a virgin brother B said a young man tried to find a wife that's even a virgin that's moral you'd have to go around some good little old Holy Ghost Church I like to think of us as a good little old Holy Ghost Church that's all right you want to call me that I that's all right good little old Holy Ghost Church almost to find one he said that's exactly right where man just kept her in things like that got a little decency about her why because the husband I don't have time to go into this afternoon but the husband is his name is houseband that's what the word husband means he's the he's the protector of the house yes right he's the protector of the house even though uh she was fully grown it's true of boys as well but it's more true of girls because the boys sometimes they go out and find a wife a man he'll do that but but a a wife or girl the the father is a protector if she has one as a protector of that home the mother is protecting as well and here Rebecca was fully grown and and she had to make the decision herself but yet she was still under the headship of her father listening to the counsel of her mother and brother and Isaac on the other hand was completely trusting you talk about head being under headship he was letting his father pick for him I'm not saying that's I don't I don't want that responsibility but I will give advice it but now what do we learn from this it's appropriate for a young man to go out and seek a wife it's appropriate that that's why you go to youth camp that's all right I'll get hammered for saying that but that's okay is appropriate for young man to go out and seek a wife leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife what it means it don't mean he has to live where his wife lives but it just means that sometimes he'll go looking right because there aren't many trusted servants around we can send out so it's appropriate for a young man to go out and seek a wife his decision is who her decision is yes or no she has a decision every much as right to make a decision as he does girls you don't have to you don't have to always answer yes just cuz he asked I had somebody tell me said I would answer the first person that asked me I'd say yes I'm ready to get married that's a dangerous place to be in so you don't have to say yes but a young it's a young man's job to ask the question we I know we got that twisted around today but why do we have what we have the the the tradition of the man asking you know why that is Isaac and Rebecca the biblical example yeah yeah right that's the way that was done well that's been happening for thousands of years and now we got the girls asking the boys for their hand in marriage don't do that and if y all did that don't don't just don't worry don't tell me that story I don't now my wife had a revelation before I did that she was my wife she did but she didn't ask me I ask her she prayed and waited a little while but she didn't come after me right and it's not appropriate for a girl to be aggressive pursuing a guy it's not appropriate and you guys especially there's girl you know us dads we'll keep you from being too aggressive right we got our ways don't we brother Joe you know we we can stop you from being too aggressive but it is appropriate for a guy to pursue a girl it's not appropriate for the girl to you think well it's all going to be 50/50 it's not going to be that's where we get this example woman's not supposed to be aggressive you know and that's turned around I don't have time to go through this I wanted to get through this but uh the Bible talks about 1 Timothy about shamefacedness how many you heard that that word how many you young people heard that word shamefacedness you know what that is is it's the ability to blush yeah right the ability to blush so brother BR talked about how women can't blush anymore there's no modesty he said I wouldn't even know what it was if some woman blush he they haven't got that dignity anymore he said they wear clothes like a man cut their hair like a man smoke like a man drink like a man cuss like a man vote like a man work like a man so become rough Burly shows where you got to that's exactly he said a little lady like you don't see her much more she's a hard person to find I thank God for Godly sisters don't you thank God for your wives and these young ladies that are sitting here we thank God for Godly sisters who aren't like this who can still blush he told brother argb he said it's hard to find a girl with enough modesty to blush they've heard so many dirty jokes and filth and you couldn't say anything to make them blush but brother Brandon said that was a god-given quality to safeguard our morals yeah right watch be careful how much you watch you young people don't need to have your head in romance novels all the time and and then romance TV shows all this stuff because you get to where nothing bothers you right you don't blush anymore brother brandom taught us that a woman a married woman shouldn't even wink at another man right you shouldn't do that you don't well how am I going to get a man if I don't paint above my eyes and I don't wink at them how am I going to get a man water some camels be a keeper at home learn to cook do the dishes I'm telling the truth now my wife before we got married you know what I noticed about her we don't do this today but what I noticed about my wife I'm sorry she's blushing now but what I what I noticed about my wife you know she's beautiful right but she was real young I was real young what I noticed about her she cleaned her bathroom with a toothbrush I'd never seen that done before and her grandma who kind of raised her great-grandmother who's gone now to be with the Lord she ironed her sheets you know that's the way she raised Britney in that way and and I thought you know in our lives we have three kids now so our house is always Helter Skelter but but but she was that way and I thought that there's something about that and and my wife when we got married she was a teenager we got married a young teenager and I've never had to tell my wife that never had to never had to uh never had to teach her how to clean house yeah or teach her how to and I've helped a few times but when we I worked and she had a baby and and I couldn't stay up all night with the baby I was going to work I work seven days a week and so she she took complete care of the babies Complete Care of our three children but I also didn't make her have 12 for another sermon God help me but Isaiah said you know in the Bible it says they walk with stretched forth necks and wanting eyes you know what that is a want and wanting eyes that that's a woman who who has no shamefacedness won't blush if you want one that'll do right watch how they work watch what they do for people watch how they work around the church boy that ought to get some of our sisters up and washing dishes over here at the fellowship H you know our young ones see God orchestrates these things the right one is God provided I got seven minutes I'm on finish the right one is God provided how many believe that did God provide your spouse those of you that are married eler recounts his story and the miraculous nature of it he begins to negotiate with her father and brother cuz you marry the whole family you know in verse 49 he said now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me if not tell me I may return to the rightand or to the left and then laan and bethu answered and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good so in other words we can see the hand of God in it we ought to be able to see the hand of God in these things that's why Jesus said what God has joined together you don't have to push and shove and lie and pretend try to be somebody that you're not let God put it together let God do it and I've told you this story before but I am married today because I went and heard Daryl Ward preach so it's a good thing to come and hear a preacher come to church because you might meet your wife and I know uh uh brother Gabe sister Milly aren't here she was feeling bad this afternoon about to have a child but I know that uh they met the same way I I remember that night and I kind of me and Brother David kind of putting a little unction unction giving him a little anointing there push him in that direction you know and it it worked out they end up loving one another and don't always work out like that but it did and why they weren't expecting that it was something God did God put them together God let it be that way don't push and shove and and and lie to your parents and sneak around on the phone and get on that app that your parents don't know about out because your parents are kind of tech stupid and they don't realize you could talk to Boys on it oh yeah now some of you are blessing he's gaming apps and the parents think oh they're learning a foreign language and y'all know what I'm talking about talking to boys or talking to girls don't do that you get your parents permission you want a guy that'll ask your parent your do your father and your mother hey can I talk to your daughter get that guy I'm GL I wantan to I want to say something about our young men here we got some some young men that have that have held themselves right and done the right thing and I'm so proud you know why I don't preach on dress very much with our young people because I don't have to these young people I've noticed that our young people I think dress better than our elders sometimes not to put our elders down but they do they dress well and I'm proud of him for that yeah let's set that expectation yes let's keep them doing that right I want to encourage you in that and our young men have been for the most part appropriate with our young ladies let's keep doing that let's keep doing that and don't get upset you know it's hard to be the odd the odd person out you know it's always I was always the odd person out I was always you know it seemed like every girl that I like they was just waiting on another guy to come along and then they they leave me and go to them but you don't want that one in anyway you want somebody that loves you let God orchestrate it and don't overlook what God has provided and be content with what you are Paul said art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife sounds like he's talking about jail there he said but if thou marry thou not sined if a virgin Mar she has not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh marriage is hard work he said but I spare you let God provide let lastly the right one is willing listen to me you won't have to chase them too hard and by the way you young girls don't be chasing these boys literally or figuratively if you catch them you wouldn't know what to do with them the right one is willing God works on both ends of the line aren't you glad that he does you won't have to talk the right one into an engagement oh oh I'm going to die if you don't marry me you know and and you got to finally make them feel sorry for them you know enough to to Mar no if they want to say yes they'll say yes don't hide things in your life all right try to get their sympathy they're going to find out be honest yes and if they are the right one they won't show interest just to make you jealous but Caleb and I talked about that I think we talked about that how that it seemed like girls that they have a problem with that and got guys do it too but they just show interest to make somebody else jealous don't do that girls don't play with somebody's emotions if you find somebody that's right you'll know yeah it'll be how will you know you'll just know and it'll be somebody that'll fit the word it'll fit all of this right and I promise you your parents won't be too mad if you find the right one dads always get mad that's their job but anyway Genesis 24:58 they called Rebecca and said to her wil thou go with this man she said I'll go clear-cut decision he didn't have to pretend to be something he didn't have to sell her a story but she'd been told how Isaac was aired all that Abraham had she knew she'd be taken care of yeah listen Isaac wasn't some person we said some random person Isaac had a job he wasn't abusive he wasn't on his second or third wife he wasn't a Manchild playing video games while she worked but Isaac was was ready to be married and she was ready to go marry him so they were there was willingness on both ends of the line yeah let me tell you young people your Isaac is out there your Rebecca is out there don't settle for less right because once you say yes you're committed yeah right and in fact in those days once you were betrothed you were legally married you couldn't come together yet but you were legally married now that wasn't some 12-year-old kid saying I'm going to marry you someday you know like we get but it's it was a legally binding agreement between two families betral the promise matters brother Brandon says when you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her be careful about who you ask you don't get to do that again and I realize every situation is different I don't think we ought to look at people and say well you know that one got engaged and they broke up and they did this they don't look at that you just stay right with the word yourself no put down on other people like that you don't know the situation right but know this it's a it's a serious thing when you make a vow yes engagement is not the time to give you getting to know someone right know them before you get engaged pray before you get engaged he said well I can't get as close to them as I'd like to so I get to know them better pray talk to their parents yeah and you talk to them you need to talk to them right but make sure the parents are involved consult your pastor consult her pastor if it's a different Pastor or his Pastor finding the right and if they're the right one they'll have one or get one yes finding the right one doesn't mean everything will go smoothly your entire marriage the right one might be poor he'll work but he might be poor right one might have a difficult background come from the world or a different kind of church but there'll be a believer whose sins are forgiven aren't you glad for forgiveness of sins and and and and the right one we should never look bad at young people who come out of the world you know sometimes we feel like the only ones eligible to get married are ones no we we want our young people to we want young people to come in and and feel like they can find a wife in the world I I'm glad but let them get saved filled with the Holy Ghost first right but we want them we want them to get saved and let sins washed away if they've been married before it's a different thing you need to you need to talk to your pastor and make sure those things are right but we're we're not looking for temporary pleasure don't settled for that the world's full of that that's not an option yeah huh that's why we don't use dating apps got real quiet we don't use dating apps we don't get on the internet to look for a wife because everything on there's a lie don't do that if you found your wife online that's bless the Lord you know wonderful that God gave you Grace but make sure you get to know her even if you connected online make sure you get to know her before you ask her to marry or him or accept a marriage proposal we're not looking for temporary pleasure love is eternal I'll say this I'll read this quote musicians go ahead and come brother brand said love is eternal listen to me young people love is eternal it's not fleeting it's not a feeling it's Eternal he said When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's pretty there will be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her that's why I said you'll know wait till you know you'll know people try to talk you out of it but you you just know she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like praise God he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they're from eternity because love is eternal love is not a temporary thing a fling an affair that's not what love is love is eternal I want you to remember these things as we close to begin to play something the right one is a Believer the right one is approved by Godly Parents the right one will be found through prayer the right one is a servant to others the right one is under headship the right one is God provided you won't have to push and shove for it the right one's willing you know I want so badly for all of you I realize that not everything's going to work out in the world half of all marriages end in divorce did you know that half 50% and the ones that anymore a lot of them don't even bother to get married you realize there are more unmarried people living together than there are married people today we're taught not to do that we don't believe in that we want marriages that last let me say this it's a it's the best thing the Bible says it's the best thing he can give you next to Salvation is a Godly wife marriage is a wonderful thing I don't let people scare you too much I say these things and kids get scared I don't want you to be scared and most of our young people are not old enough to be married anyway but I want you to I want you to look down down the road someday Melody not too long you be that bride that blessing bride walking down the aisle let the Lord just let you stay with me and I'd be okay with that too she shook her head no on both things someday you might be that girls you you might be that voice and you younger ones you say well this doesn't affect me but keep it in mind going forward don't play with these things let let God lead you it's a serious thing I I know you get little boyfriends and girlfriends and things but let it you don't need that in your life right now just be friends love love one another in in a Godly Christian way when you get older there's going to come a time you get a choice that you have to make and when it comes time for that choice remember what we said I may not be here when you get old enough to make a choice but listen to what's been said cuz we want to it's it's the word that washes us from our own ideas to let us follow the word and and be right we want to be right listen I don't say these things to be mean it's not because of culture it's not because of that we the what we've been taught we've been taught for a reason is to make have make you have a happy marriage one that you'll get along with somebody listen you don't have to fight all the time you couples if you do that every day you're fighting and fighting and fussing you need to repent you need to you need to work on that fall in love with each other again brother B told a story about a couple who about to get divorced just comes to my mind he said that they were fighting over everything people do that I they fight fuss over the cat and the dog everything else he said they were fighting fussing and dividing all the stuff up and they divided all the clothes and furniture they finally make it to the attic and they're fussing and fighting and they get to a trunk that they some stuff they put away and she said this is mine this is mine finally they found something they both grabbed a hold of at the same time and was a little baby shoe and they'd had a baby that they' lost they' bought the little shoes for it never got to wear it and when they both grabbed that shoe they looked at each other's eyes but the man said that they realized they had something in common listen to me Mary you got something in common fight for what you have it's worth fighting for make make it right the worst thing I've counts people I've told them the worst thing in a marriage is apathy it's the absolute worst thing it's worse than fighting is people don't care anymore eventually it just goes away way cuz nobody cared fight for it if you got something worth you got something in common fight for that I think as Believers we ought to fight for one another as young people do the best you can do we don't want you just to get along we want you to be The Shining Light an example to other young people as you are already you're an example to other young people in other places continue to be that you young men you stand strong do the right thing that you say well I don't have a girlfriend right now it'll come I don't have a boyfriend right now it'll come just wait on God wait till you're old enough wait on God let God take care of those things he'll handle it for you he did for Rebecca if he did it for Rebecca he did it for Isaac he can do it for you I believe he will hey man let's bow our heads together I maybe there's some young people here you know the first thing you want to be a [Music] Christian if you're not a Christian you need to you need take that plunge say how can I be one he that heareth my words understandeth my words believeth he has everlasting life you believe on him right now where you're at you can do that where you're seated you can come to the altar believe on Jesus get your heart right before you ever start thinking about marriage or anything like that do that now you young people you really young ones do it now now make your heart right make sure everything's right let your heart be tender seek the Lord every day say well been seeking the Holy Ghost I don't have it yet seek him again don't stop maybe some of you with every head bowed and every eye closed maybe some of you parents you look at this and say well I've not really been paying enough attention to my children I just can't wait to get them out of the house and I just get them all gone well they'll go what influence will you have then you not been spending the time that you need to spend with them and caring for them steering them in the right direction Now's the Time to start just talk to God about that say Lord I want to do right my grandchildren maybe if you're older you're grandchildren some of you Elders you know I've seen people 80 90 years old get married sometimes it happens make sure you marry the right one even at that age sure you do it right set an example for our young people to follow live for the Lord marriage is a wonderful thing just make sure it's right make sure he's in it if you're married and you find yourself fussing and fighting or God forbid beating on your wife or your husband or your kids repent of that let it go let God work in your life change you you don't have the Holy Ghost if you beat on your wife you don't have it I can tell you that right now you not the Holy Ghost don't do that need to seek him with all your heart Heavenly Father Lord I say these things just I sometimes I don't even know why I say what I say but I pray God that you would just you would just move and these young people's hearts for the elders Lord I you moved in my heart oh God help me I want to set a better example where I've been too critical Lord help me maybe where I've not been involved enough and get too involved in church and sometimes my own kids I I lose sight of what they're doing I pray God you'd help me if I don't have my kids and my house in order what do I have as a minister I pray God you'd help me today I thank you for my children Lord though they be teenagers we joke about that but Lord I love them and I I see Lord that they're becoming fine examples of young Christians I though they make mistakes but Lord I know that you're with them I pray you'd help them Lord pray you'd help these other young men and women Lord I I love like my own children Lord and some of them I've taken an interest in their lives and I pray You' Tod help them oh God lord we want to see a right kind of a husband the right kind of wife we say these things for a reason I realize they may not agree with what I've said maybe some of the parents don't even agree but but give the time maybe to see what maybe see if it come from the word if it didn't come from your word Lord they can spit it out but Lord if it did to to to change us toward the word to be Lord I have a tender heart that would allow us to change be molded by the word I pray you grant it Lord help our young people God we've seen a little Revival working among them may you continue to work Lord every moment of every day God may it not be just a Revival in church may go to their H how they treat their parents and how they act around the house oh God may you may you fill them refill with the Holy Ghost Lord Lord let them be not just on fire at Youth Camp Lord or somewhere else on fire every day Lord that they would listen to the message they would read their Bibles they they'd want to hear more from you to know more about you I pray they'd Fall in Love with You Lord let them fall in love with you first and then they'll find the right one I pray you grant it Lord I pray you'd bless each one of these parents that come and listen patiently these Elders bless each one father these young people I pray in Jesus name amen God
