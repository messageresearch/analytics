the children's bread Lord may you heal heart each one of these situations oh God we know that you're Jehovah Jireh Lord and for each one of these needs that were represented by way of uplifted and I pray that you'd meet those needs tonight Lord by the preaching of your word by the anointing of your spirit we pray you'd Grant it now in Jesus name amen thank you Lord turn to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 23 we're going to continue on The Exodus family Hebrews 11 23 reads like this by faith Moses when he was born was he was a hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated it's a hard age to be born into it's definitely a hard age to raise children in I I heard a story or saw a video of a young woman who decided she wanted to sue her parents for having her because she had to get a job she'd reach the age she had to get a job and had to make it in the world and that's kind of a difficult situation so she said I'll just sue them and and they might have wanted to sue her back if they could for for being who she was but just the age that we live in It's A Hard age and yet we we've been called to this age and God wouldn't have put us here if we couldn't handle it and that's that's a revelation in itself is whatever we've been given whatever problems that we Face we have the ability to handle those problems or he wouldn't have allowed us to go through it and there's a great comfort in that and understanding and and receiving from from God in that way that Lord I know uh that I must be able to take it Lord give me strength to be able to Bear it and so we know that Egypt at the time of The Exodus was a a difficult place to raise children the government made it difficult the culture made it different difficult in fact the government and the culture of that time were insane and I think we could say the same thing about this government and and this culture that we live in today it's just it's just grouping in Insanity it's it's nonsense everywhere and yet we want to raise children that are that are Godly in in the world and that's the situation that they face during that time the Bible says in Exodus 1 13 that the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor in other words they they made them slaves that's what that word means they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar and brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service were and they made them serve was with rigor they they become slaves and they served with rigor and a pharaoh knew that the the more that they grew the more of a threat that they were so he tried to disrupt the home life as much as he could and he did that as we saw last week he tried to make it impossible for a man to fulfill his Covenant of work of providing for his own and now we're going to see that he's going to attack the woman he's going to attack the mothers he's going to attack the wives in their Covenant trying to make it as difficult as possible for them to do what God called them to do yet God's going to have some mothers at the time of The Exodus that were able to produce a Moses out of their home and God's going to have some people today it may not be exactly the way people see it happening but somehow God made it work so he's going to attack the woman in the Covenant that she has now that Covenant is in Genesis 3 16. you remember the dual covenant brother said in marriage and divorce he taught us a man and the woman had a dual covenant and he said unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children thy desire shall be to husband and he shall rule over thee so her Covenant was one of childbearing and submission to her husband and yet there's more to being a woman than having babies and serving your husband I thought I'd get a big amen out of that just like there's more to being a man than work right you got to be a Christian too you've got to live in the world and yet but but you do have to do that you have to be a man and work but that's only part of what you are the same thing is true of a woman it's their primary role given by God and yet there's some some women that never even get married and yet they serve God in in that capacity and some women that can never have children they yet they serve God in that capacity and they become very strong women and and a woman uh maybe that never has a house to keep and yet and yet they could be a woman of God but yet their primary role is still that there's something something about them that wants to fulfill that Covenant I think a woman in this age must be strong but not dominating it it takes a strong woman in this hour to submit to her husband when the world is in an exodus condition when it when it teaches the other way and and and begin to be dominating now Paul taught that one way a woman honors or submits to her husband is by wearing long hair do you know that that's what that actually is First Corinthians 11 3 I'm not going to preach on hair tonight but I'm just building a background for where we want to go first Corinthians 11 3 said I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ the head of the woman is the man in the head of Christ is God so he's building up the the headship in the home he said every man praying or prophesying having his head covered this this on Earth his head and about every and you know people wear a hat while they preach or whatever while they sing we see that today that's why we don't because the Bible teaches a mansion cover his head but every woman that prayeth her prophesies with her head uncovered dishonor through her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven he ties it to the hair and and Paul so it then he goes on and explains that but he's careful to let the people know the woman is not a second class citizen in the Lord and I think that's important for us as well verse 11. he said nevertheless neither it's The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord in other words we need one another he said for as the woman is of the man even so the man also by the woman in other words there wasn't a man alive that didn't come from a woman right even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God so in Christ and that's why you get some situations you know you begin to think Branham is against women voting how many know that he was against he was against the the women getting the vote I should say it that way he was against the women getting the vote he said great evil had been done and it was because it brought in abortion and everything else same-sex marriage and women's vote and yet he women vote in church and have a say in the church as much as say as any man does when it comes to that they're a voting member of the church how does that work well because in Christ in Christ all things are of God and so you your position in Christ is not lessened because you're a woman or because you're a man but brother Brandon put it this way he said he said God Made Men a help mate not a doormat he said remember she was your sweetheart she should always be that aren't you glad that if you're a real man of God your wife will always be your sweetheart amen now he goes on to say that her hairs are covering so it's not just a hat that she would wear or a scarf but in First Corinthians 11 13 judging yourselves as a commonly that a woman praying to God uncovered that's not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering so a woman's Covenant then is also to be a keeper or worker at home that's what the word keeper means in Titus Paul tells the older women to teach the younger women he said the age of women likewise they'd be in behaviorist becometh Holiness not not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands the word of God be not blasphemed now Satan again is working against this biblical order in the home in the time of The Exodus and so where the Branham dramatizes that in in teaching on Moses he talks about how that Pharaoh's counselors came around and they began to tell him uh Pharaoh how can we get these people uh to become more like the world and and they said this they said look you've got the man working you you make them have Attila bricks so many each day make them out of stubble you've killed the little children things but they're still increasing he said the thing you ought to do is put the women to work too he said if you put the women to work and he said no that's not a woman's place he said so they said but you put the woman into work put them out there let them make brick too and they'll be so tired when they come in they can't cook their husbands supper they can't be a good Mama see him and so if they're going to work and go on like that so they won't be able to do it so you put them to work too is everybody with me so far yeah again it's it's a conspiracy in our day there's been a conspiracy to make the economic situation so bad that you can't hardly make it without two incomes now and that's the reality of the time that we live in it's happened in our time I want to say this I I am so proud of many of our young couples that have have chosen for the the wife to stay at home and I know how hard that is because we made that choice for my wife to stay home and then if you have several children the choice kind of gets made for you but but that's hard that's difficult because it's difficult to make a living by yourself but I'm proud of you you young men that do that and and this has happened in our time that women have been put to work and and yet I want to be careful with this because brother Branham didn't act like some of us do sometimes and and shame women who had to work brother Branham didn't do that he when he was talking about Margie Cox I I knew the the Cox family and uh new sister Nelly and brother Charlie well this would be sister Nellie's or brother Charlie's brother I believe and and yeah his brother and her sister-in-law Margie and he talked about her and how she'd been healed of diabetes and told that testimony and I've heard the testimony from the Cox's and he talked about how that those ladies Margie and Nelly worked in the factory and and he said the little lady Works day and night almost up there a loyal little mother to help her husband to pay for their home that they're trying to build and her and her little sister Nelly and Charlie he said that's the brother of Rodney his wife all them working together at them factories there just as hard as they can go and standing the reproach they let their hair grow out taking the makeup off things like that when they become Christians he said I believe in giving credit where credit is deserved he said and I certainly have a warm place in my heart for those two young women they were working in a factory and I'll be honest with you I wouldn't want my wife working in a factory I don't think it'd be a good place for my wife to be I'd do everything I could to keep her out of there and yet brother Brandon said he had a warm place in his heart for these ladies he never told them they had to quit or or that they were doing he said they were doing something to help see the motive matters and we've read that to you recently but brother Brown was asked the question are women allowed to work in public affairs when they have a healthy husband and children and the person said I'm asking this question for someone else and and I'd just like to talk to the person who asks the question and and find out who they were throwing that off on but brother Brandon was very cautious with that he's very careful with it he said well I don't know about that I can't say he he was a lot more humble than a lot of us were he said I don't know about that I can't say he said but I just have this feeling he said let me say this I believe if I was a woman I mean my husband was healthy had a good job working I believe it would be a great pleasure to me to stay home take care of my children raise them up to love the Lord he said if I had any time for my washing and things that I was going to do I think I'd teach my children how to serve the Lord he said now if you've got a debt or something you're trying to help your husband pay for something that you have to do he said I think that's fine if you'll try to help him and you live a ladies yeah that's the important thing sometimes we miss the big things you can stay home and not live like a lady you can stay home stay on the internet all the time that's no no better than being at the office all right and so brother Brandon talks about being in the office where they men told dirty jokes and some of us have been in those environments it's no place for a lady it's no place for a man for that matter many places that I've been but but brother Brown said now if a woman can hold herself as a real lady and trying to help her husband do something to meet some clothes for the kids to go to school or Alpha bill or something like that and she wants to work till that's over he said no this is not the Lord because I don't have no scripture for this he said I don't know one way or another he said I'm just saying that'd be my opinion but otherwise I wouldn't think just because she wants to work just to run around and have more money to spend run around run to bar rooms or drink smoke and carry on I don't think she should do it I think she should stay home try to be a lady and take care of her house and I'll see if there's any women in this church that are working in order to buy cigarettes or in order to buy alcohol in order to run around in bar rooms you ought to quit working and stay home it's the devil that that done it though made it to where it's so hard so difficult because as I've said many times if if a woman has a job and outside of the home she has two jobs because she still has her primary responsibility at home and it's difficult now so they they were trying to destroy the image that God had for the home and it's the same thing that's going on today and then we find that Pharaoh he called out he was trying to work this where he could get rid of these people in Exodus chapter one and he talked to the Hebrew midwives and and he told him he said you know he said when there's a girl baby born he said you can let them be born but whenever there's a boy baby you need to kill it and was a direct order from the King but the midwives feared God and they refused to deal with that abortion program that was there but infanticide that was there and I believe God's got some people today that are still good people that won't do that and won't partake in that and that's what was happening then these people would not partake in that and so brother or the Bible says therefore God dealt well with the midwives I think God will deal well with anybody who is who is for life and who doesn't want to kill babies so God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very Mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared God he made them houses in other words he blessed them financially because of what they did this nation listened to me this nation when it protects children God will bless it and when it doesn't protect children he'll curse it just like if this nation stands for Israel God will bless it when they don't stand for Israel he'll curse it there are certain things that God does and even if I was not a Christian I'd want to be on God God's good side amen but now they feared God rather than man and they were blessed financially and and Pharaoh in Exodus 1 22 charged all his people then he said every son that is born you shall cast into the river every daughter you shall save a life and brother Branham dramatizes that and he says these these women he said that had never had children and never wanted children he said and they were women with no feelings for children like what you would normally have he said they they went out he said it was witches like with with long fingernails and pain on their face and and we got some of those running around today I think they have no uh they had no I saw the other day where a woman killed her own son over a dispute over a lawnmower or something like that and you look at that and think what what kind of a world do we live in it's women who have no no natural affection no ability to feel he said he made them the police but the brown said it'd become women police and and a woman doesn't have any business in that kind of an office but but here they become a woman police and they went out and they began to begin to go around looking for these babies and you can imagine what kind of fear that must have caused to the children of Israel and and how some of them thought well maybe we should just do what Pharaoh says and kill our children and others there would be a natural desire to want to see your baby live but the Bible attributed it to Faith Paul did when he said Moses parents by faith they hid Moses it was faith that caused him to provide a caring home for him it was faith that provided that caused him to shelter him keep him quiet every time these these witches come around and knocked on the door and said it's time to it's time to give up your child by faith they kept him away from them and the same things going on today by faith we keep our children out of the out of the out of the Hollywood culture out of the world out of the things that are going on we've got to hold on to them especially when they're very little by faith we we build I would say this it's not physical walls because physical walls won't do it it's not even walls that where you can keep them away from people as much as it is a wall of prayer that you build around your children and you take them to the house of God and you pray over them and you and you work with them and you teach them and you're trying to build something in their lives what are you doing by faith you do that believing that there's going to be a fruit out of this the devil's not going to get them like he does all the other children who am I we have that promise today the devil can't have my children I might say Amen to that tonight not letting him have my children amen now and so in Exodus 2 1 now it says there when a man of the house of Levi and took to wife a daughter of Levi and the woman conceived embarrassed son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hit him three months this Faith being expressed but the brown taught us that works is Faith expressed the faith of the parents being expressed by the act of hiding Moses away from the king's commandment they saw something in it that others did not see he was a goodly child Exodus 2 3 and when she could not longer hide him now this is where it gets interesting because there come a time she couldn't hide him no longer and I think for all of us there Comes A Time with our children that we can't hide them no more it's very simple tonight but I I want us to understand this that in this time of Exodus we want to hide our children but there Comes A Time you can't and there comes a time you've got to commit your children to the Providence of God can no longer hide him she took for him an ark of bull rushes dobbed it with slime and with pitch and put the child there in and she laid it in the flags by the river's Brink and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him now there are two parts to raising a child just as there was with Moses parents the first part you hide them you protect them and then the second part letting them go and many times it's the second part that's so difficult I think some of some of you Elders could probably tell me this better than I could say myself but especially some of you mothers you worry more about your children now than what you did when they were little because now they they get to make their own decisions and you being a full-grown human being you know just how stupid human beings can be right and so you wonder about your children my kids growing up and I I think Lord I I don't want them to make some of the mistakes that I made and yet I want them to follow the path that I did because I followed a path that led to Mercy and repentance and Grace and and godliness and and the and the ability to be in the house of God and to worship God I want them to follow that path but yet not make the mistakes that I made but but I can't control that after a certain time you got to build the ark you got to pitch it with tar you got to prepare it but then you got to let them go so she could only hide Moses so long joke about just as Abraham and last Wednesday night we preached about how amram faced The Dilemma is it going to work or take care of his house is it going to work or is he going to pray it's a dilemma he did both and jokerman faced a dilemma in her Covenant to care for her children Satan always will force us to try to force us to to choose and try to get us to make the wrong choice and she faced The Dilemma in her Covenant to care for her child she could only hide him for so long because he was getting too big to hide and brother Brown taught us in teaching Moses he said teaching about Moses he said brother Branham our brother Brown said amram had a dream and he started building and God showed him what to build he started building a little boat made out of reeds and I'll say this I I didn't have a dream about what to do with my children I remember thinking I have no clue how to raise children but I did have the word of God and the word of God was God's revealed will to me of how to build an ark from my children how do I build an ark for my children well I build an ark out of prayer I build an ark out of out of Bible reading I built an ark out of teaching I built an ark out of going to church I built it out of faith are you with me now I build it out of love I'm building an ark for my family building an art putting it together and so he said Imran was down there building a shark at night so he switched over he was praying you remember he got an answer to his prayer though the situation had not changed so now he was believing and now he went to work and said past the bricks you remember but now he's got to build a boat for his child so he can send him away so he goes to the basement for a different reason he's been going upstairs to pray now he goes down to the basement and he begins to work there's a time to pray and there's a time to work so now he started building a little boat and here his wife she said have you been in the basement praying this time of night I am with him he said no I've been in the basement praising God Hallelujah he said what have you been doing he said I want to tell you he said now you know them old witches is coming back he said I want to tell you what we're going to do we've had the baby now for three months and we've got to get rid of it well there's a tough one you'd probably react like Joker bed did she said oh ram ram we got to do what we got to get rid of the baby get rid of the babysit yeah oh you're cruel no I'm not cruel I know what I'm doing what do you mean why well you'll be as bad as Pharaoh going to get rid of our baby yeah I'm gonna get rid of the baby oh oh we can't now listen if we keep it we're going to lose it or what a lesson this is to us what a lesson is this if we keep it we're going to lose it we got to commit it to God and if we give it to the one who gave it to us he'll find it Hallelujah at some point now I want you to watch this especially those of you who are getting who are older and maybe you've seen this and and some of us have younger children but they're going to be in this place at some point her efforts to help her child would only endanger it she had to let it go now that's very difficult for a real mother maybe some of these people out here today that shoot their children wouldn't have a hard time with it but for for those who are real mother you'd have a difficult time getting rid of your children putting them in a boat send them to school letting them go to work let them do what they have to learn to do I know my wife she she don't want to let them do anything that might hurt them but life is risk right and you can't work without taking a risk you can't you can't love without taking a risk can't have a family without taking a risk so at some point you trying to hold them and tell them every what to do actually we could endanger them because it'll make them rebellious now she had to let him go now this is this is difficult again for a real mother and the Bible says that if we train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he will not depart from it and and that that train is interesting in that way because it's to teach a child or to pull them back and and the way is is the the bit the bit of the child the child was bent a certain way and so you take a tree you know when a tree is Young what do you do to it you tie it to a post when it's a sapling you take a tree and you tie it to a post with a bit of fabric why do you do that you want to influence the way it's growing so you're not going to let it be around certain people right it's a sampling it can't handle it so it's got to grow up straight right and we make these choices are we going to send them to public school or home school and I'll say there's there's problems both ways right but you're making that choice you're tying that fabric around that sapling well who you let them fellowship with maybe even people in your own family you say well it's not good for them to be around them and and it's not good for them to spend time with them because what are you doing you're tying them up you want them to grow straight literally in this day and age you want them to grow straight you want you want them to be you want to be okay it's crazy out there I read the other day the school had a big Pride display in Massachusetts and the kids got upset they got tired of being indoctrinated and they kind of they took over the school and poured all the stuff down now they're in a lot of trouble I have to say I mean what are you gonna do what are you going to do I'm not advocating that but it's a hard age when they're young you got it's our responsibility to tie them up right they need boundaries they need to be told no we better tell them that while they're young or they'll never hear it while they're old when they get old is that right so it's our responsibility to tell them no but we tie them up we don't tie them up with something that'll hurt them but but we tie them up so that they grow to be a mature tree but have you ever noticed if you tried to take a mature tree brother Joe that's already bit a certain direction and you tie a rope around it now you're going to influence its growth you know what you'll do to it you'll wound it right because the Rope will actually grow into the tree I've seen it done or whatever it is if it comes up against a fence if it comes up against something that tree is so mature it won't it'll just it'll just go around that it'll become a wound on the tree and the tree won't live a song because of the fact that it's wounded huh and so many times when we get to a certain age and I don't know who I'm not preaching to any individuals tonight I I may be preaching to Future me so you just bear with me tonight but when our kids get to a certain place that uh you know we we want our children and mother especially once their children to be at home that never changes by the way my mother still wants all her children to live with her you know that's just the way it is that's just the way it is you don't ever get over that but the Branham talked about how there's nothing that mother wants more than to see all of her children gathered around the table and you have a promise that one day if you never have another Thanksgiving if you never have another Christmas if you never get them all together again maybe some of them have gone on to be with the Lord and I know some of you've lost several children they've gone on to be with the Lord but one day you have a promise that there's going to be a table and you're going to be gathered around it again you have that promise and you can hold on to that that's what mother wants but if a child is wasting their money on drugs and alcohol and living in that way and you're giving them a free place to stay sometimes you're hindering the child trying to hold them up more than you're helping sometimes you just have to let God be God and we don't always understand what God's doing all right we don't understand what God is doing that's why the way of God sometimes is hard it's a harder way he's told Brother Brown because you've chosen the harder way we don't understand what God's doing you look at Jeremiah and Israel Jeremiah is in is in the nation of Israel at a time when it seems like they need patriotism and they need somebody to stand up and say hey let's go fight this war with the Babylonians that's not the prophet that God called Jeremiah to be he was a weeping prophet because he constantly had to preach go with them go with them let them go let go with them make peace with the Babylonians and the people say what in the world are you doing because he already knew that God had told him that the end would be okay see God had already told him I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so he said all this war is going to do is cause more people to die so he got put in jail as a traitor for doing that but God showed him after 70 years they would come back again see the thoughts but it's not always revealed to us what the end will be right so it's many times we we try to control situations so much and not just with children but even in churches we we try to control everything that goes on and you can't do that you can't control you can't control your parents even what they want to do when they're doing things they shouldn't be doing you can't do that you've got to take your hands off sometimes but the Bible says we don't always know you know God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform if we commit anything to God and believe it like our children or whatever more how many have committed your children to God even when they're young you got to commit them to God he said like our children or whatever more let's believe that God will answer that prayer hey man he said today before I left to go away the phone constantly ringing the mothers with their children saying now pray for them and I say now just commit them to God that's all you have to do don't put your hands on it anymore that's good advice isn't it don't put your hands on it anymore let God have it if you're going to do something about it then God will stand back and let you go ahead till you get finished he said well why has God moved in this situation or maybe it's because we got our hands on it and if we take our hands off of it then God would stand back and let you he said let you go ahead till you're finished but when you committed to God let him have it he will do it amen he said you just believe him just stand back and don't work but believe don't work and that's hard for people to comprehend because people want to know especially people who who like to fix things they want to fix situations they they want to make it good they want to put a Band-Aid on that on that on that spot you know that where the child got hurt or or the situation they want to put a Band-Aid on it but sometimes you got to let God heal it you committed to God let him have it he'll do it you just believe him just stand back and don't work but believe that's where Grace they said is imputed for righteousness to believe that God will how many believe he will tonight he will take care of my children he will take care of my family he will take care of the church he will take home I he will he'll be okay you don't have to keep your hands on it all the time take it off once in a while brother said that's the way it is of anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself Just Let it Loose and let him do it just commit it to him that's why praise is such a powerful weapon what did Abraham say I'm in the basement I'm not praying anymore I'm praying I'm praising why am I praising praise is a powerful weapon because it's a sign of committal I've done everything I can do the doctors have done everything they can do now I'm going to praise God now I'm going to worship God now I'm going to believe God I'm going to worship Him in spite of the situation I'm going to worship him as if it's already done amen Hallelujah just committed to him but the Branham said that he said that's the way it is just just let loose let him do it just commit it to him he said the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is committal to God do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it hopefully we could just believe that tonight now most mothers have to do that at 18 or 21 or 40. Joker bed had to do it at three months that's faith that's faith but she had confidence in two things number one the ark that they had made now God could have made an ark you know we've got lightning come down hollow out a tree and put him in the tree and then put him that's not what he did he had amaran make the ark he built the ark that's what the Bible says they built the ark they built the ark they weaved it together and I'm sure every time every they did a good job too because that's Mom and Dad making the ark that's not made of some Factory in China they're building the ark they're doing the very best I think we ought to do the very best we can for our children financially spiritually every other way we ought to do the best we can and yet realize once that Ark is built there's nothing more you can do you got to let them go but she had confidence in the ark and the and also the Providence of God that if they did all that they could do that God would do his part so brother Brandon says they go down to the river amram goes down to the river he's carrying the ark and she's carrying the baby and they go about daylight just before it gets light out where the the opening my witches you know they stayed up late at night they couldn't get up early in the morning so they've been out killing babies all night partying here come Abraham yoga bed this joke about this this Christian families we would say it today this Godly family and they're slipping down to the river early in the morning before he had to go to work and she had to go to work they went all they've got down to the river they slipped down where the Reeds would kind of cover things up slip down into the water he puts down the he puts down the ark he looks around he sees what looks like logs floating on the river no one I was at the now ever here not long ago they told me there's no more crocodiles because the pollution is so bad but in that day they had crocodiles and brother Brown said they'd gotten fat off of babies big old fat crocodiles just waiting on another baby to get thrown into the river gathered in the Nile River and at the same place where they threw the babies in maybe here they put an ark in and joking about I just can't do it I I can't put my baby down there I just can't let go I can't do it and they remember standing there yes dear you've got to you've got to if you keep him it'll be dangerous to him you imagine must have been some discussion in that home you got to let him go so she places him down as gently as she can make sure he's not crying not alerting anything She lays him down in the in the basket closes the lid of it brother said I had a little window in the top just like the ark did they laid it down there let some sunlight in let him be able to breathe and they laid that in close the lid and then they pushed it off they told their daughter because they had to go to work after doing that she told her daughter wait Miriam wait there and watch it see what happens to it it starts to float away it's a helpless feeling isn't it starts to float away down the river fat crocodiles start to swim up towards it they only get so closing kind of jump back big old crocodile's just about to oh my big old crocodile just about to grab a hold of it as they jump back why something was going on in heaven while this was going on on Earth something was going on in heaven brother Brown said what do you think is going on in heaven about this time he said you know when things goes on down here there's something going on up there too Jehovah called Gabriel over to watch the scene and he said look down there see those people putting that baby in the water he said I still got some people that trust me I can still got some people who know how to build an ark I've still got some people that know how to how to trust me that believe the promise of God their kids are going to be there I still got some people that believe me here they are putting them in the water let him go committing him to the water oh my God and the Father the Bible says walking into the water starts to push a little boat out I can hear the Lord say Gabriel yes Lord call Ten Thousand Angels to the scene see you couldn't see what was going on in heaven all you saw was what you did here on the Earth all you saw was having to let go and that was hard but you couldn't see what was going on in heaven dimmer that child has a future that child has a future oh my our children have a future they have a purpose and here in heaven in heaven Ten Thousand Angels stand at attention give them marching orders right away called the host of Heaven out send them all up and down along the banisters of Heaven put them all up and down the Nile he said I command that no crocodile will touch that cargo Hallelujah nothing will touch it don't even let a chunk of wood come near it Gabriel said it shall be done my sound of the trumpet Ten Thousand Angels come in arm the pilot where are you going to be Lord he said I'll be at the other end oh God imagine they put that thing in the water if they had disclosed to anyone what they had done you imagine what the others might have thought I put my baby in the water it didn't survive God cared why didn't he take care of mine but our children are special hear me Church our children are special they belong to the elect of God there may have been a million others went out and they did the same things your kids did with the same way your kids did and you thought well they'll go the same way and end the same way but their end will not be the same because there's Ten Thousand Angels guarding the river and there's there's a Christ at the end of it waiting he's always on the receiving end he said I'll wait down at the other end I got a purpose when people will trust me I have something of purpose it'll be all right it'll be all right oh could we could we grab a hold of that promise today it'll be all right when people trust me with their finances when they trust me with their health when they trust me with the church when they trust me with their children when they trust me with their marriage it'll be all right look like there's some crocodiles in the water but it'll be okay it'll be all right with them committed to God he'll take care of it musicians go ahead and come the great dilemma what do I do commit them to God build the ark do the very best you can build it go to church as often as you can go live for God as much as you can but someday you're gonna have to let that child go when you do know that there will be Ten Thousand Angels watching over that baby we do our part God will do his part and when we fail in our part God still does his part well that's the grace of God oh isn't he wonderful but let him have your dilemma whatever that dilemma is we're we're Exodus families today we're we're living in a time of of Exodus the Third Exodus we're going home I was laying flown with milk and honey Egypt's not not our home we're going to another a better place a better land where it's not all about this world and how we feel here but it's about another land let him have your dilemma let him have your trouble let him have your children let him have your your wife your husband it'll be all right he's waiting at the other end to fulfill the promise first the baby may have to go through a little little winding the river turns a little bit crocodile's trying to come up and get it but he's waiting at the other end is waiting to fulfill his word I know the thoughts that I have towards you says Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end would you bow your heads with me I know it's been simple tonight but just on a Wednesday night I wanted to remind us when we Face a dilemma in Exodus give it to God commit it to God let God raise our children let him let him take care of them don't don't try to put your hands on it so much let let go let him do his work father the
