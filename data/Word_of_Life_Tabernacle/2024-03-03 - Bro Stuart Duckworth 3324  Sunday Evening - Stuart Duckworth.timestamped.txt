[56:44] with me like it it had when I was
[56:46] younger yeah and I remember going to
[56:49] church one day and my cousin's little
[56:52] daughter she come out and I was so

[57:52] few nights that I'd come in

[1:09:59] own and his own received him not
[1:10:01] speaking of Jesus but as many as
[1:10:03] received him to them gave he power to
[1:10:06] become the sons of God to them that

[1:10:55] question amen your experience with God
[1:10:58] he'll try to make you question amen that
[1:11:00] even if there is a God and you go back
[1:11:03] to the scripture you go back to when
[1:11:04] Jesus when he had to receive the Holy
[1:11:06] Ghost amen and he was led away in the
[1:11:08] wilderness to be tempted and one of the
[1:11:11] tactics that Satan used upon Him amen he
[1:11:13] would come and he would ask him if thou
[1:11:16] be the Son of God Amen turn these stones
[1:11:18] to bread amen there he said if thou be
[1:11:21] so he was trying to get him to question
[1:11:23] he was trying to get him to doubt amen
[1:11:25] even if you if you're the Son of God do
[1:11:28] this he was trying to get him to doubt
[1:11:30] he was trying to get him off the word
[1:11:32] amen and if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:11:34] that's a good sign amen that Satan when
[1:11:36] he comes at you with a doubt amen that
[1:11:39] that you're even a Son of God amen amen
[1:11:41] because as a Son of God that's your

[1:11:52] used his own power amen but he knew who
[1:11:54] he was anden the Holy Ghost amen when

[1:11:59] identification that I'm a Son of God
[1:12:01] that I'm a daughter of God and brother

[1:12:14] there's power and identification oh yes
[1:12:17] I'm giving you all I got tonight come on
[1:12:20] it's good amen but as many as rece
[1:12:23] received him gave he the power to become
[1:12:25] the offsprings of God I give unto them
[1:12:28] eternal life oh yes eternal life he said
[1:12:31] comes from the Greek word Zoe and Zoe is
[1:12:34] that life it's the life of God and if
[1:12:36] the life of God living in you produce
[1:12:38] produces a God it'll produce a Godly
[1:12:40] life just as certain as I'm standing in

[1:13:21] word and how can come unless they were
[1:13:24] all foreordained to come as many as
[1:13:27] received him to them gave he power to
[1:13:29] become the sons of God because their
[1:13:30] names were written on the book he come
[1:13:33] to redeem what was on that book Thank so
[1:13:39] I can't put your name on there and I

[1:17:24] later down the road you don't do that
[1:17:30] amen yeah it's good my I'll try to keep
[1:17:34] preaching here Hebrews
[1:17:36] 10:1 always love preaching this the law
[1:17:40] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:17:42] and not the very image of the things can
[1:17:45] never be with those sacrifices which
[1:17:48] they offered year by year continually to
[1:17:50] make the comers there un to perfect
[1:17:54] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:17:56] be offered because that the worshippers
[1:17:59] once purged should have no more
[1:18:01] conscience of sins Hebrews 10 10 and 1
[1:18:04] 10 and 3 now but in those sacrifices
[1:18:06] there's there is a remembrance again
[1:18:08] made of sins every year for it is not
[1:18:12] possible that the blood of bulls and
[1:18:13] goats should take away sin so the old
[1:18:17] Old Testament brother B talked about it
[1:18:19] amen Jesus fulfilled all the Old
[1:18:21] Testament he was all what the prophets
[1:18:23] and all what the law said amen and under
[1:18:26] those ordinances amen they had to bring
[1:18:28] a lamb to cover their sins right they
[1:18:31] had to bring it year after year right
[1:18:34] but they would go away am me because
[1:18:37] that the life of that could only cover
[1:18:39] it could not Purge it could not take
[1:18:41] away amen the sin that was in their
[1:18:44] heart amen and so they would come year
[1:18:46] after year and they would bring these s
[1:18:48] this sacrifice they would bring this
[1:18:49] lamb to the priest right and they would
[1:18:52] bring that and that's that's what God
[1:18:53] required because it was the image it was
[1:18:55] a shadow of what was to come amen but
[1:18:58] they would leave amen amen doing what
[1:19:00] God told them to do but they would leave
[1:19:02] with that same desire that they come
[1:19:04] with though they
[1:19:06] recovered but we're no longer living
[1:19:09] under Shadows come on we've got the real
[1:19:11] thing here tonight right amen we're no

[1:22:25] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:27] that the emotion of that never matched

[1:22:40] comes with it amen but he's want to give

[1:34:02] your generation young people is no
[1:34:03] different right amen you can think of
[1:34:06] your favorite Bible Luke said
[1:34:09] David who'd you
[1:34:12] say Samuel Samson Samson sorry can't

[1:34:24] you're no different than them God will
[1:34:26] give you an experience God will prove
[1:34:27] things through your life if you'll
[1:34:29] surrender to him and that's what that's
[1:34:31] where it that's where it's at it takes a
[1:34:34] surrender it takes a consecration to him
[1:34:37] amen and man I think of Enoch that's one
[1:34:40] of my favorite Bible characters Enoch
[1:34:42] that that word means cons his name means
[1:34:44] consecrated it means dedicated that's
[1:34:46] right and mean he took a Rapture he
[1:34:47] walked with God for 365 years yeah and
[1:34:51] mean and he and he went on up with God
[1:34:53] as though he was not amen that's the
[1:34:56] kind of life we want to live amen
[1:34:57] consecrated dedicated to him and when
[1:34:59] there's going to be a generation that
[1:35:01] takes a Rapture there's going to be a
[1:35:03] generation that will let the word have
[1:35:05] preeminence that will let the Holy Ghost
[1:35:07] have its way in their life they will
[1:35:08] become that generation that habitation
[1:35:12] of the Holy Ghost yes amen thank you
[1:35:15] Lord this is something after I I was
[1:35:18] saved in 2005 God changed my life
[1:35:22] and I went to Winter youth retreat went
[1:35:24] to a camp just like some of y'all are
[1:35:26] going amen and the the word being
[1:35:29] preached and there's things that will
[1:35:31] illuminate you and give you Faith amen
[1:35:34] don't go there just Amen to just to have
[1:35:37] a good time or to see your buddy or
[1:35:39] whoever amen go to to benefit from it
[1:35:41] yes that's good and that that's what I
[1:35:46] winner youth retreat in
[1:35:48] 2005 this quote was read it said Luther
[1:35:51] walked in one light and Wesley walked in
[1:35:54] another Wesley walked in one light
[1:35:57] Pentecost walked in another but we're
[1:35:59] walking on higher than that today and he
[1:36:02] said if if there's another generation
[1:36:04] it'll go beyond us am mean if you go
[1:36:08] back that was in 1959 if you go back
[1:36:10] brother Brown says there can't be
[1:36:12] another
[1:36:13] generation because of how sinful and how
[1:36:15] wicked things were how the parents were
[1:36:17] letting their children just do whatever
[1:36:19] they were encouraging to do this and he
[1:36:20] the was sing there there there just
[1:36:22] can't be another generation but here we
[1:36:25] go on and I think this was left for you
[1:36:27] and I I I I've always been encouraged by
[1:36:30] it he said if there is another
[1:36:32] generation it'll go beyond us amen amen
[1:36:35] we're going to take the word amen we're
[1:36:38] not going to put it on the Shelf amen
[1:36:40] we're not going to we're not going to
[1:36:42] try to exalt ourselves above the
[1:36:44] messenger or what was brought but we're
[1:36:45] going to take what was brought amen and
[1:36:47] we're going to go beyond amen we're
[1:36:49] going to we're going to let the word
[1:36:50] amen Luther amen he amen the people of
[1:36:53] those day those days they manifested
[1:36:55] what he said amen they were saved they
[1:36:57] were Justified amen and the people
[1:36:58] during the time of Wesley they lived
[1:37:00] Sanctified lives they lived the Holiness
[1:37:03] life amen amen but you and I amen we're
[1:37:05] here to to take amen the word got to
[1:37:07] take on flesh amen it's got to become
[1:37:09] flesh in this
[1:37:11] generation Hallelujah yes so the prophet
[1:37:14] passed off the scene in in
[1:37:17] 1965 and so in 2005 that was another
[1:37:20] generation that was the year here I God
[1:37:22] changed my
[1:37:23] life amen another generation had came

[1:38:06] Spirit justification is a work of the
[1:38:09] Holy Spirit sanctification but the
[1:38:11] baptism of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:38:13] that's the reason this was in ' 63 he
[1:38:14] said that's the reason it took a
[1:38:16] prophetic Prophet to come down no

[1:38:20] came and self oh yeah in this fullness
[1:38:23] of the baptism yeah amen wonderful amen

[2:01:41] reality amen amen I'm going to read just
[2:01:43] a little bit different scripture for
[2:01:46] foot washing you know Jesus said
[2:01:49] that you know people would know that we
[2:01:53] were disciples by our love for one
[2:01:55] another and I want to read this it come
[2:01:57] on my
[2:01:59] heart this is what Paul says love is he
[2:02:02] said though I speak with the tongues of
[2:02:04] men and of angels and have not charity
[2:02:06] and becometh sounding brass or a
[2:02:08] tinkling symbol I have the gift of
[2:02:10] Prophecy and understand all Mysteries
[2:02:12] and all knowledge I have all Faith so
[2:02:14] that I could remove mountains and have
[2:02:16] not charity I'm nothing charity is agape
[2:02:20] love though I bestow bestow all my goods
[2:02:23] to feed the poor and though I give my
[2:02:24] body to be burned have not charity at
[2:02:27] profiteth me nothing charity suffereth
[2:02:30] long and is kind charity envieth not
[2:02:34] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[2:02:37] puffed up does not behave itself
[2:02:40] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[2:02:42] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[2:02:45] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[2:02:48] in the truth beareth all things
[2:02:51] believeth all things hopeth all things
[2:02:54] endureth all things charity never fails
[2:02:59] whether there be prophecies they shall
[2:03:00] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[2:03:02] cease whether there be knowledge it
[2:03:05] shall vanish away for we know in part
[2:03:07] and we prophesy in part but when that
[2:03:09] which is perfect has come then that
[2:03:12] which is is in part should be done away
[2:03:14] and then the last verse he said and now
[2:03:16] abideth faith hope charity these three
[2:03:20] but the greatest of these is Charity we
[2:03:22] wash one another's feet because of the
[2:03:25] love that's been shed abroad in our
[2:03:26] hearts by the Holy Ghost and Jesus when
[2:03:30] he did that set an example he said you
[2:03:32] do what I've done to you he said and if
[2:03:34] you do these things happy are ye if you
[2:03:37] do them amen amen do you love one
[2:03:41] another amen that's that's how men will

[2:03:54] worship and and and praise and water the
[2:03:56] word with our praise I know it's been a
[2:03:59] lengthy service but I believe it's been
