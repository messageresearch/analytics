[33:28] see everyone and uh you know I just love
[33:30] and appreciate all you you know talking
[33:33] to Sister Carla and me many memories
[33:35] coming up here helping them build the
[33:36] house and stuff and just good to see all
[33:39] of y'all you know it's always kind of
[33:40] funny the the Lord's always given me a
[33:42] heart to travel and I love it but it's
[33:44] also kind of bittersweet because I hate
[33:46] saying goodbye to people and you know
[33:48] it's just uh I told somebody one time I
[33:50] don't like making friends but I like to
[33:52] make family and it's always so hard on
[33:53] me saying goodbye but it's so good to
[33:55] see y'all and even tell brother Ben is
[33:56] just always know it's great to have
[33:58] church with people who make you feel
[33:59] welcome and know they love you but I'm
[34:01] ready for the word tonight are you you
[34:03] know I'm ready for the word tonight I
[34:05] think it was uh you know brother Ben
[34:07] told me I could get up here I just can't
[34:08] preach he said but I can greet the
[34:09] people and uh anytime I can uh just lift
[34:12] the message up I like to do that it was
[34:13] uh you know I think about Jesus he with
[34:16] the crowd there he said uh he said you
[34:19] got to eat my flesh and drink my blood
[34:20] and many of them were falling him and
[34:22] they just they couldn't take that and
[34:23] they turned away they called him a
[34:24] vampire and they called him a devil a
[34:26] crazy man and you know he he looked up
[34:29] broken heart and he said will you go to
[34:30] talking to the disciples and you know it
[34:32] always resonated with me because Peter
[34:34] spoke up it was you know Peter the one
[34:36] who denied him and the one who had
[34:38] cutting the solders ear off he was
[34:39] sleeping in the garden when Jesus was
[34:41] praying but he said to whom would we go
[34:44] and you know I think where else will we
[34:45] go if it weren't for this message he
[34:46] said the prophet said Peter saw
[34:48] something in Jesus that he couldn't see
[34:50] in any other man he said it wasn't a
[34:52] place he didn't seem to you know to
[34:53] where would we go but he said to whom
[34:54] would we go and you know all my hope
[34:56] lies in this message message and you
[34:58] know it's a it's a hard World we're
[34:59] living in and I'm thankful you know for
[35:01] the message cuz it's this message that's
[35:03] going to carry us on you know to the
[35:04] coming of the Lord all right you know
[35:06] the Bible says here we have no
[35:07] continuing City but we look for one to
[35:09] come and it's this message I believe
[35:11] that's going to take us to that place
[35:12] and you know brother brandom you know
[35:14] Heaven it's always kind of you know it's
[35:16] just something special to think about
[35:17] brother brandom said his dog was there
[35:19] and he he had a horse there and you know
[35:21] even his favorite chair that they came
[35:23] and take cuz he couldn't make payments
[35:24] on it but most of all he wanted to see
[35:26] Jesus and that's my desire I want to see
[35:28] Jesus I believe it's this message I'm
[35:31] homesick go ahead
[35:34] and sing it with me if you know
[35:36] [Music]

[46:56] and you've done for us and our
[46:57] Ministries and tonight we want to go to
[46:59] the word of the Lord I know it's a
[47:00] Sunday afternoon and amen we want to uh
[47:04] be very uh conscious not to uh amen uh
[47:07] create a pharaoh situation here and not
[47:09] let God's people go amen amen amen amen
[47:13] I'm glad you you uh you said amen Joel
[47:16] amen amen we we sure love and appreciate
[47:19] brother Joel don't we amen he's such a
[47:21] wonderful brother and amen does such a
[47:23] wonderful job and we we sure sure
[47:25] appreciate him and amen is that how you
[47:27] wanted me to say
[47:31] that okay amen The Book of Revelation
[47:34] the e8th chapter amen we want to go to
[47:37] Revelation chapter 8 you love the Lord
[47:40] this afternoon amen Revelation chapter 8
[47:43] and verse number one I know this is a
[47:46] very familiar reading to us and amen I'm
[47:48] going to uh maybe speak a little bit
[47:50] here tonight on Thanksgiving if that's
[47:52] okay Revelation 8 and verse one the
[47:56] Bible says says and when he had opened
[47:58] the seventh seal there was silence in
[48:01] heaven about the space of half an hour
[48:05] when he had opened the seventh seal
[48:08] there was silence in heaven about the
[48:11] space of half an hour in Revelations
[48:13] chapter 10 I want to go back to
[48:16] Revelation chapter 10 and I want to look
[48:20] there in the eighth
[48:22] verse we were speaking this morning on
[48:25] the voice of the seventh angel
[48:27] not being the voice of a man but the
[48:30] voice of God veiled in the man in the
[48:32] eth verse and the voice which I heard
[48:34] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[48:37] go and take the little book which is
[48:40] open in the hand of the Angel which
[48:42] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[48:45] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[48:47] him give me the little book and he said
[48:51] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[48:53] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[48:56] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[49:00] took the little book out of the Angel's
[49:01] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[49:04] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[49:07] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[49:10] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[49:15] before many peoples and Nations and
[49:17] tongues and Kings now the Bible said
[49:20] when the seventh seal was open there was
[49:22] silence in heaven about the space of
[49:25] half an hour brother br tells us in
[49:27] Feast of trumpets he said Revelations 10
[49:29] is the seventh seal so when you look at
[49:32] Revelation 10 it begins to talk about
[49:35] open book and eating that open book I
[49:38] remember I heard a brother say it one
[49:40] time like this he said when the seventh
[49:41] seal was open there was a feast amen
[49:44] tonight I want to speak to you for a few
[49:46] moments on the bride's Thanksgiving
[49:48] feast let's just bu our hearts together
[49:50] Heavenly Father Lord we are indeed
[49:52] grateful to be your children Lord we're
[49:55] thankful for this special time that
[49:56] you've given us here together this
[49:58] weekend Lord the youth meeting Friday
[50:00] evening the time of Fellowship yesterday
[50:03] Lord the service is today around the
[50:05] spiritual and natural food alike now
[50:08] father as we stand here tonight to look
[50:10] into your word we are very well aware
[50:12] that we're not here by ourselves but
[50:14] Lord there's an unseen host of angels
[50:17] that have gathered in this building
[50:18] tonight to minister to the needs of your
[50:20] children for Lord these are The Heirs of
[50:22] Salvation so father I pray tonight for a
[50:25] few moments you would help help me to
[50:27] get myself out of the way Lord May the
[50:29] anointing come in for a few moments and
[50:31] just push back tiredness Lord father I
[50:34] pray that if there be specific needs up
[50:36] in lives and hearts oh God lord may your
[50:39] word speak directly to the situations oh
[50:41] God now father we commit this meeting
[50:44] tonight in thy faithful hands in the

[50:53] as you can have your seats amen as I
[50:55] said I want to talk talk to you for just
[50:57] a few moments here on this thought of
[50:59] the bride's Thanksgiving feast amen the
[51:02] brides Thanksgiving feast you know we
[51:04] are in uh right now a season of
[51:07] Thanksgiving and you know to many we
[51:09] find that Thanksgiving is a Time amen of
[51:12] just eating a turkey or getting together
[51:14] or you know sitting around and talking
[51:16] with one another uh to the world
[51:18] Thanksgiving has actually become just
[51:20] another day of the year or just another
[51:22] time I think of how that many many years
[51:25] ago you had Thanksgiving on Thursday and
[51:27] then you'd have what they called Black
[51:28] Friday on Friday to go get all the
[51:30] shopping and all the sales and you know
[51:32] that never would open till about 6 or 7
[51:35] a.m. the next morning but as you see how
[51:37] the world is so taking over today amen
[51:40] it's come right into the time of our
[51:41] Thanksgiving feast with our families and
[51:44] so the world has totally redefined amen
[51:47] what Thanksgiving is but I believe as
[51:49] Believers tonight that we celebrate
[51:51] Thanksgiving amen as those who are
[51:53] thankful amen and Gathering Together
[51:56] around on the table with our friends our
[51:58] family our loved ones amen and most of
[52:00] all giving thanks unto God now when you
[52:03] think of this giving thanks unto God we
[52:05] have been given a direct commission Amen
[52:08] to give thanks in 1st Chronicles 16:34
[52:11] he said oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[52:13] he is good and for his mercy endureth
[52:17] forever Psalms chapter 105 and verse one
[52:19] he says oh give thanks unto the Lord and
[52:22] call upon his name and make known his
[52:25] deeds among his people brother BR would
[52:28] say tomorrow is Thanksgiving it's a day
[52:30] that set aside where our Pilgrim
[52:32] forefathers set that day aside to give
[52:34] thanks to God for what he had done for
[52:36] us for blessing them and giving them
[52:38] crops and so forth he said it's one real
[52:41] American day he said all other days like
[52:44] St Patrick's and so forth come from
[52:46] across the seas this American holiday is
[52:49] Thanksgiving day he said now tonight I
[52:51] want to say there's so many things amen
[52:54] that I am thankful for I don't know how
[52:57] to give thanks to God for so many
[52:59] blessings he said But be sure to
[53:01] remember that tomorrow if your church
[53:02] has a service then attend it tomorrow
[53:04] night he said look if you don't have
[53:07] church service then at home get the
[53:09] family together and sit down and take
[53:11] God's word and read it amen tell your
[53:14] children about it tell them that this
[53:15] nation amen was built upon such as that
[53:18] our forefathers who fought Amen to bring
[53:21] this freedom to us amen that we would
[53:23] have the freedom of worship and the
[53:25] freedom of speech and the freedom of
[53:27] press he said and we're thankful yet for
[53:29] it we don't know how long we'll have it
[53:32] amen but I say this long may our lands
[53:34] be bright amen with freedoms Holy Light
[53:37] protect us by thy might great God Amen
[53:39] our King so we find then that the day
[53:41] we're living in amen that there's
[53:44] actually two kinds of conditions there
[53:45] is the condition amen of a famine and
[53:48] there is the condition of a feast now
[53:51] the prophet Amos prophesied he said
[53:53] behold the days come so this was in the
[53:55] future right amen behold the days come
[53:58] saith the Lord that I amen will send a
[54:00] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[54:03] nor a thirst for water but of hearing
[54:06] amen the words of the Lord when you look
[54:08] there amen at that word famine it means
[54:10] to hunger amen it means to hunger for
[54:13] Jehovah's word so there would be a
[54:15] famine Amen in the land where people
[54:18] would literally be hungering for the
[54:20] words of Jehovah now the prophet of God
[54:23] said it very beautiful he said there's
[54:25] more preaching being done than ever in
[54:28] the world Amen and less practiced than
[54:30] we ever did in all the world he said do
[54:32] you know the scripture says there will
[54:34] be a time in the last days when there
[54:36] will be a famine strike the land it'll
[54:39] not be for bread and water but for
[54:41] hearing amen of the word of God he said
[54:44] the people are seeking to hear the word
[54:46] of God Amen but they are failing to get
[54:49] it now when you think of this famine
[54:51] this famine we're speaking of Amen would
[54:53] not be a natural famine amen but it
[54:56] would be a spiritual famine not a famine
[54:59] now listen not a famine for word amen
[55:02] because we have plenty of word amen but
[55:04] there would be a famine for the hearing
[55:06] of the word now in 1962 brother Ram
[55:09] receives a vision he says now dreams are
[55:12] very funny he said but there I was he
[55:14] said and in this dream he said there was
[55:16] a Boatman come over he handed the little
[55:18] canoe about 2 and 1 half three feet long
[55:20] he said it was real white just plastic
[55:22] and white and he said here's your boat I
[55:24] said oh I couldn't cross for that and
[55:26] that he said we'll run about 5050 M an
[55:28] hour up and down the way I said it might
[55:30] up and down the shore but it won't out
[55:32] here he said now look in this dream he
[55:34] said now they're not even Boatman I said
[55:36] I know that I said I'm a Boatman and I
[55:38] know about a canoe to handle it but I
[55:40] said they'll never they couldn't make it
[55:42] I would like to go that anyhow he said
[55:44] well they love you and said why don't
[55:46] you go back up here and store up he said
[55:49] so I went back and the little place
[55:50] where we've been out there little place
[55:52] called kondak about 45 or 40 or about 40
[55:55] miles yeah he said little store out
[55:57] there he said look like it was a condac
[55:59] and it turned out to be this Tabernacle
[56:01] he said I was standing right there and I
[56:03] was calling in great barrels amen the
[56:06] prettiest food I ever seen he said there
[56:08] were radishes looked like three foot
[56:10] long turnips and greens and potatoes and
[56:13] everything he said now store in plenty
[56:16] of it see and I was standing there amen
[56:18] just storing it in he said and I woke up
[56:21] but I couldn't understand it now how
[56:23] many knows when a dream comes there has
[56:25] to be a prophet Amen in order to
[56:27] interpret that dream he said now here's
[56:29] the interpretation Lord you gave this
[56:32] Vision some two years ago Amen to store
[56:35] up the food fine healthy looking
[56:37] vegetables amen that I saw in the vision
[56:40] being stored here Amen in this
[56:42] Tabernacle may we today receive a whole
[56:45] barrel full amen or a tap Lo that it
[56:48] might reveal Jesus Christ to us Amen in
[56:51] the hour that we live to give us amen
[56:54] sustaining strength amen the spiritual
[56:57] strength for the task amen that lays
[57:00] ahead I'll say this what the Church of
[57:01] the Living God needed amen was more than
[57:04] just a good service amen what they
[57:06] needed was more than just a theologian
[57:08] or a doctor of divinity Amen to expand
[57:11] upon the scripture amen but they were
[57:13] starving to death spiritually amen they
[57:16] needed a feast he said if the children
[57:18] get the right kind of vitamins they
[57:20] always feel good he said and what we
[57:22] need is some spiritual vitamins Amen in
[57:25] the church today what we need is some
[57:28] spiritual vitamins in the church today
[57:30] now brother talking about vitamins he
[57:32] tells us amen how there were two farmers
[57:35] amen and they had raised two Cals y'all
[57:36] remember that story he said now here's
[57:38] what was happening he said the food they
[57:40] were eating amen was what separated them
[57:43] one from the other he said that puts me
[57:45] in the mind of some of these old
[57:47] churches see amen this great big tall
[57:49] aspiring place with a $1,000 pip organ
[57:52] plus seats and everything amen but is
[57:54] there anything to eat there he said
[57:57] that's the next thing you get some
[57:58] little Old Mission somewhere amen you
[58:00] know you might find a little a whole lot
[58:02] in there amen some spiritual vitamins
[58:04] God has got them amen to help your
[58:07] spirit pep it up a little amen that's
[58:09] the preaching of the Gospel he said if
[58:12] that won't pep up the church there's
[58:13] nothing that will amen for Faith Cometh
[58:16] From hearing the word of God listen we
[58:19] are not chickens amen who are trying to
[58:21] barely scratch around the Barnyard Amen
[58:23] in a famine and find something to eat
[58:26] amen but we are Eagles and Eagles
[58:28] require amen Eagle vitamins I say what a
[58:31] blessing it is Amen to be an eagle in
[58:33] this generation and what a blessing it
[58:36] is to be able to receive amen the broken
[58:39] bread of life amen as a feast in the
[58:41] hour of famine that has been sent down
[58:44] from our father you say what is the
[58:46] bread of life well the prophet of God
[58:48] said amen the bread of life is the
[58:51] revelation of Jesus Christ in those two
[58:54] notable messages brother BR preaches
[58:56] around the time of Thanksgiving the
[58:58] first one is amen the token 1963 and the
[59:01] second one was the invisible Union yeah
[59:05] on of the Bride of Jesus Christ he said
[59:08] in the token I'm looking for a Time To
[59:10] Break Forth amen of the spirit of God in
[59:12] these last days that we're now living in
[59:14] for another surge of the Holy Spirit
[59:18] into the church for a rapturing faith
[59:21] amen just before it comes he says I
[59:24] believe we're now at the time
[59:26] amen that the word should have the
[59:28] preeminence in another place he said see
[59:31] amen sometimes it means a lot sometimes
[59:33] it cost you something anything that
[59:35] doesn't cost you something it isn't
[59:38] worth having and all these great things
[59:40] amen has to be paid for that's the
[59:42] reason amen that we are worshiping today
[59:46] amen the freedom of religion in this
[59:47] Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of
[59:50] a many American millions of them he said
[59:52] but it's worth something and this
[59:54] religion that we have this Pentecostal

[1:00:24] place David said let sacrifice amen the
[1:00:28] sacrifices of Thanksgiving amen and
[1:00:30] declare amen his works with rejoicing
[1:00:34] many times people amen they want to
[1:00:36] thank God for the big things amen but
[1:00:39] they don't want to thank him for the
[1:00:40] Small Things amen but I love how I heard
[1:00:42] it said one time amen what if we woke

[1:00:48] thanked him for yesterday he said we
[1:00:50] should live amen with the spirit of

[1:01:03] Amen in the spirit of Thanksgiving unto
[1:01:05] God when I think of this this this
[1:01:07] season or this Feast of Thanksgiving
[1:01:10] amen the scripture prophesied amen that
[1:01:12] at the time there would come a feast
[1:01:15] Amen to bring an end to the famine amen
[1:01:17] it would come in an unthankful
[1:01:19] generation the Bible said this know also
[1:01:22] in the last days amen that perilous
[1:01:24] times shall come come listen there's a
[1:01:27] famine that shall come and perilous
[1:01:30] times shall come for men shall be lovers

[1:01:34] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:01:37] disobedient to parents amen unthankful
[1:01:40] and Unholy look at this word unthankful
[1:01:43] it means unpleasing now when you think
[1:01:46] of this Thanksgiving amen it is a time
[1:01:48] of gathering it is a Time amen gather
[1:01:51] around something it is a time of
[1:01:53] remembrance and reflection amen but it's
[1:01:56] also a Time amen that the spirit of
[1:01:59] thankfulness amen has set in Amen to
[1:02:01] where the more we have the less thankful
[1:02:04] we become listen an unth thankful
[1:02:06] generation for the natural blessings but
[1:02:08] look then that moves into the spiritual
[1:02:11] blessings and they begin to take the
[1:02:13] things of God for granted when is the
[1:02:16] last time amen that you just took time

[1:04:44] of in the hour that we're
[1:04:46] living this bride's Revival amen is a
[1:04:49] feast but it's not feasting on the day
[1:04:52] to carry on it is feasting on Fresh Mana
[1:04:55] when you look here at this word Feast it
[1:04:57] means a large meal amen which is
[1:05:00] typically one in celebration of
[1:05:02] something I'll just say this you all
[1:05:04] know these things amen but the fresh
[1:05:07] Mana of the hour amen is the hidden Mana
[1:05:11] that has come from almighty God now that
[1:05:13] hidden Mana amen it's not for
[1:05:16] everybody but the hidden Mana amen is
[1:05:19] only for the Overcomers amen of the age
[1:05:22] now you know where that come from don't
[1:05:24] you amen Moses in the Old Testament the
[1:05:27] Bible said he had a golden pot amen and
[1:05:29] they put their Mana in there brother
[1:05:32] picks that up and he said now remember
[1:05:34] only Believers only the elect amen comes
[1:05:36] into that amen God has chosen you he
[1:05:39] said now you said well amen no he that
[1:05:42] overcometh amen is the only ones that
[1:05:45] will receive of that hidden manner you
[1:05:47] say well praise God I overcome smoking
[1:05:50] that ain't what he's talking about amen
[1:05:52] there's a whole lot more goals to
[1:05:54] Christianity but besides not smoking
[1:05:56] cigarettes amen or drinking whiskey but
[1:05:59] he that overcometh amen shall inherit
[1:06:02] all things and he will be my son and I
[1:06:05] will be his God now listen I will give
[1:06:07] him of the Hidden Mana listen I will
[1:06:10] hide him away and I will give him the
[1:06:13] hidden things that the world on the
[1:06:15] outside of the curtain amen they don't
[1:06:17] know nothing about it amen though they
[1:06:20] eat Mana they don't know about this amen
[1:06:22] but I will give to him the hidden Mana I
[1:06:25] will give him a white stone with his
[1:06:27] name in it I love what the prophet says
[1:06:29] brother Joel he says do you get what I
[1:06:31] mean amen entering into the adoption or
[1:06:35] the hidden place with god listen this
[1:06:38] Feast of the Mana of hidden word is
[1:06:41] going to bring you into an adoption as a
[1:06:44] Son of God remember said Ministers of
[1:06:46] the Gospel amen don't care about your
[1:06:48] denomination or what the world thinks
[1:06:50] amen but seek Amen to enter into that
[1:06:53] hidden Mana where the fool revelation of
[1:06:56] God is amen make love perfect in your
[1:06:59] heart and you and God and everything
[1:07:01] else is at rest now Jesus in Revelation
[1:07:05] 2 and verse 17 he says now to him that
[1:07:08] overcometh will I grant to eat or will I
[1:07:12] give to eat of the Hidden manner R picks
[1:07:14] that up in the church age book he said
[1:07:16] now the spirit amen is promising the
[1:07:19] hidden manner he said a revelation of
[1:07:21] the word is given to the angel of that
[1:07:24] age amen for for it's hid from
[1:07:26] everywhere amen and revealed back the
[1:07:28] hidden manner it's addressed Amen to the
[1:07:31] angel of the church do you see do you
[1:07:34] get it are y'all ready for this he said
[1:07:36] it's a little bigger revelation of what
[1:07:39] Christ is and maybe a little higher call
[1:07:43] amen so this hidden Mana is a more
[1:07:45] Fuller Revelation that is calling you to
[1:07:48] a higher position oh church amen when
[1:07:52] the famine has struck the denominations
[1:07:54] and they're s satisfied just putting
[1:07:56] their name on a church rooll they're
[1:07:58] satisfied amen just going to church
[1:08:00] whenever it's convenient amen but God
[1:08:03] who is rich in Mercy amen predestinated
[1:08:06] you to receive this Mana in this age
[1:08:09] that it would give you a fuller
[1:08:11] Revelation and would bring you to a
[1:08:13] higher place in Jesus Christ therefore
[1:08:16] Jesus said amen I am the living bread
[1:08:19] somebody shout the living bread amen I
[1:08:22] am the living bread which came down from
[1:08:25] heaven
[1:08:26] and if any man eat of this bread he
[1:08:28] shall live forever and the bread that I
[1:08:31] will give is my flesh which I will give
[1:08:34] amen for the life of the world in the
[1:08:37] book of Peter it says ye also as Lively
[1:08:39] Stones amen are built up a spiritual
[1:08:42] house a holy priesthood Amen to offer
[1:08:45] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:08:49] by Jesus Christ in the end time
[1:08:51] evangelism feed us with that hidden
[1:08:53] manner that you said in the Bible was
[1:08:56] given that laid back just for the priest
[1:08:58] only but we are taught amen that we are
[1:09:01] priests of God and we are offering
[1:09:03] spiritual sacrifices that is the fruit
[1:09:06] of our lips amen giving praise unto his
[1:09:09] name so when you begin to feed on this
[1:09:12] food you can't help but praise God Amen
[1:09:15] because it is a reaction on the inside
[1:09:18] of your soul that you're feeding on
[1:09:20] something that the world has no idea
[1:09:22] about but you are thankful oh Hallelujah
[1:09:25] you are thankful to be feeding on this
[1:09:29] Mana said in the lay out of sin age he
[1:09:31] said there's going to be some Overcomers
[1:09:33] in there how many believes
[1:09:34] that how many believes you're one of
[1:09:37] them amen there's not just going to be
[1:09:39] some Overcomers amen there are some
[1:09:42] Overcomers he said remember each Church
[1:09:44] age the one preceding it inherits all
[1:09:48] the other ones were offered now watch up
[1:09:50] here everything written that he promised
[1:09:52] they will eat amen of that hidden manner
[1:09:55] do you know that hidden Mana was a type
[1:09:57] as we said of the Mana that fell in the
[1:09:59] wilderness for the children of Israel
[1:10:01] and the Bible said that it was a perfect
[1:10:03] food brother comes along he said it was
[1:10:05] a perfect food he said it was amazing
[1:10:08] how them little pellets of food amen
[1:10:10] kept them in perfect health he said now
[1:10:13] the bread from Heaven amen it symbolized
[1:10:15] by Mana one day amen came down from
[1:10:18] heaven and became life for all who
[1:10:22] believe on him said see what his word is
[1:10:25] his word is bread now if his word is
[1:10:29] bread amen then that tells me the bread
[1:10:31] is the carcass that the Eagles are
[1:10:33] feeding upon so there in Matthew 24
[1:10:36] wherever the carcass is amen there will
[1:10:39] the Eagles be gathered together but man
[1:10:42] said the church is so carnal it feeds
[1:10:44] itself on a worldly of carrying dead
[1:10:47] things of the world Amen just like the
[1:10:49] vultures do he said they've gotten lazy
[1:10:51] soft and compromising he said did you
[1:10:54] ever see an eagle comp compromise amen
[1:10:56] no sir because there is no compromising
[1:10:59] in him neither does a genuine Christian
[1:11:02] he ain't soft amen he will hunt till he
[1:11:05] finds
[1:11:07] it he will hunt until he finds it he
[1:11:11] said look he will find his meat amen he
[1:11:14] wants fresh Mana he said he'll get down
[1:11:17] there and dig till he finds it he'll fly
[1:11:19] higher and higher if there's n in this
[1:11:21] Valley he'll raise a little higher
[1:11:23] because the higher you go
[1:11:25] amen the more you can see listen the day
[1:11:28] you stop feeding on this heavenly Mana
[1:11:31] is the hour you quit seeing things amen
[1:11:34] above what the world is seen but this
[1:11:36] Mana is calling you Amen to a higher
[1:11:39] place in God with a fuller Revelation he
[1:11:42] said so what time is it it's time for
[1:11:44] the Eagles of this day amen to get to
[1:11:47] Flying higher amen dig into God's
[1:11:49] promises amen not live on vulture food
[1:11:52] that's been killed years ago amen get
[1:11:55] out of it listen he said politics voting
[1:11:58] in voting out saying this or the other
[1:12:01] amen and the Holy Spirit has no more
[1:12:03] right away in the church than nothing no
[1:12:05] more prayer meetings no more agonizing
[1:12:08] with God Amen to fulfill fulfill his
[1:12:10] word no more believing that the word is
[1:12:12] still the same yesterday today and
[1:12:16] forever he said just relies on half rot
[1:12:19] man May theology listen but neither will
[1:12:21] a Christian amen eat on that Dad carryon
[1:12:25] amen from old denominational doctrines
[1:12:27] and things he says they want the word of
[1:12:30] God they want the fresh word the promise
[1:12:33] of the hour amen God promised rabbits in
[1:12:35] the days of Luther but he promised other
[1:12:38] things in the days of others but now are
[1:12:40] you with me now amen but now he promised
[1:12:43] us a full Square meal the full seven
[1:12:47] course menu amen for all the Seven Seals
[1:12:49] are open and everything is ready for the
[1:12:52] word of God Amen to those who can
[1:12:55] receive and when he had opened the
[1:12:57] seventh seal there was a space of
[1:13:00] Silence in heaven amen but I want to say
[1:13:02] there was a feast amen that was being
[1:13:05] prepared for the Church of the Living

[1:13:33] go to a restaurant amen and sit down and
[1:13:36] look at the menu and what you pick out
[1:13:38] they say we don't serve that no more
[1:13:40] amen well why is it on the menu amen if
[1:13:42] it's on the menu it ought to be able to
[1:13:44] be served and I'll say this the pro God

[1:14:02] peelings or GW on some bones and tell
[1:14:04] you the chicken is all gone from years
[1:14:06] ago amen don't you believe that because

[1:14:16] God and believe it and will follow the
[1:14:19] instructions listen what the menu read

[1:14:25] come and the promises unto you and to
[1:14:28] your children and to them that are far
[1:14:30] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:14:33] shall call that's right Brethren amen
[1:14:35] the same holy spirit with the same signs
[1:14:38] same wonders same power yes sir it's
[1:14:41] God's holy spirit oh Church of the
[1:14:44] Living God the seventh seal amen was the
[1:14:47] opening of the word was the bringing of
[1:14:50] the revelation of Jesus Christ and was
[1:14:53] the restoring to the church of the
[1:14:55] reality that there is no two holy ghosts
[1:14:58] there's only one Holy Ghost and the same
[1:15:01] holy ghost that fell on the day of
[1:15:03] Pentecost is still available in the
[1:15:05] house of God listen you want to talk
[1:15:07] about Thanksgiving amen give thanks to
[1:15:10] God that's the same holy ghost that
[1:15:12] brother brandom had is what your
[1:15:14] children can get amen give thanks to God
[1:15:17] that the same Miracles and the same
[1:15:20] signs and the same wonders and the same
[1:15:22] blessings and the same nature and the
[1:15:25] same power of God can be accessed and
[1:15:28] can be experienced by this generation
[1:15:32] today amen it's not a famine to the
[1:15:34] bride it's a feast and the Bible said
[1:15:37] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:15:39] every word somebody say every word every
[1:15:43] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:15:47] God in St John chapter 7 in verse 37 the
[1:15:50] Bible says in that in the last day amen
[1:15:53] the great day of the feast somebody say
[1:15:55] of the
[1:15:57] feast the great day of the feast Jesus
[1:16:00] stood and cried saying if any man notice
[1:16:03] it didn't say the great day of the
[1:16:05] famine in the great day of the feast If
[1:16:08] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[1:16:10] drink for he that believeth on me as the
[1:16:14] scripture has said out of his belly amen
[1:16:17] shall flow somebody say flow shall flow
[1:16:20] rivers of Living Water but this spy of
[1:16:23] the spirit which they that believe on
[1:16:25] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[1:16:27] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[1:16:30] not yet glorified now look here at this
[1:16:33] great day of the feast it was the Feast
[1:16:35] of Tabernacles which here it is spoken
[1:16:38] Amen to be the last day amen or the e8th
[1:16:41] day of the feast now the feast is spoke
[1:16:43] of Amen in Leviticus 23 as well as John
[1:16:47] 7 so what you're reading in Leviticus 20
[1:16:50] or John 7 is actually coming from
[1:16:53] Leviticus 23 let's look at Leviticus 23
[1:16:55] and 35 it says on the first day amen
[1:16:59] there shall be an holy convocation I
[1:17:01] want you to look at this and ye shall do
[1:17:04] amen no servile work therein Amen on the
[1:17:08] first day of the Holy convocation ye
[1:17:11] shall do amen no servile work therein
[1:17:14] look at this word servile it means to
[1:17:17] labor it means to service it means to
[1:17:20] work of a servant or a slave it is of
[1:17:23] captives amen or of subjects amen so
[1:17:26] this great day of the feast was the
[1:17:28] announcing amen that the days of sural
[1:17:31] work and labor and subjection those days
[1:17:35] are now over because what was spoke of
[1:17:38] in a type has now come in a fulfillment
[1:17:41] he said to understand what I just said
[1:17:43] amen let me say it like this brother in
[1:17:46] the church agent book can I just take
[1:17:47] time and read this he said do understand
[1:17:50] what I've just said is to clear up my
[1:17:51] students have never ever found Paul
[1:17:54] saying at any time time be born again
[1:17:56] and then be spirit filled he said they
[1:17:58] have interfered it is there and fear
[1:18:01] there and they don't and they have put
[1:18:03] their own meanings to make it say it
[1:18:04] amen but the scripture does not say that
[1:18:07] and Jesus never said it either then he
[1:18:09] reads John 737 through 39 and he says
[1:18:13] now says it here distinctly and
[1:18:16] emphatically somebody say
[1:18:18] distinctly and emphatically that the
[1:18:21] believer upon drinking by coming unto
[1:18:23] Jesus in faith would have rivers of
[1:18:26] Living Water amen pouring out of him
[1:18:29] look here and it places this experience
[1:18:32] at Pentecost which in John 4 and: 10 it
[1:18:36] says if thou knowest the gift of God who
[1:18:38] it is that saith unto thee give me to
[1:18:40] drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[1:18:42] and he would have given thee Living
[1:18:44] Water skip down to verse 14 but what's
[1:18:47] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:18:49] I shall give him amen shall never thirst
[1:18:52] amen but the water that I shall give him
[1:18:54] shall be in him a well of water amen
[1:18:58] springing up into everlasting life

[1:19:03] mentioned amen but this time it is not
[1:19:06] called a river it is called an artisian
[1:19:09] well there is where the people make
[1:19:11] their mistake because it is called a
[1:19:14] whale and a river they think that in one
[1:19:16] place it is eternal life given by the
[1:19:18] spirit and then the next place where
[1:19:20] it's called a river implying a great
[1:19:22] dynm it is to be the spirit now given as
[1:19:25] an indument of power he said not so it
[1:19:28] is one and the same it is the spirit
[1:19:32] that gives life and power amen and that

[1:34:07] and gladness shall be found therein
[1:34:08] Thanksgiving and the voice of Melody re
[1:34:13] said what we need today is not a lot of
[1:34:14] material things we have that what we we
[1:34:16] don't need greater churches we don't
[1:34:18] need greater congregations we don't need
[1:34:20] more on Radio and on television we don't
[1:34:22] need so many more of these things but
[1:34:23] what we need today to be spiritual is a
[1:34:26] person that will humble themselves
[1:34:28] before God if they haven't got a penny
[1:34:31] and will pray till that Spirit within
[1:34:33] them is satisfied with the goodness of
[1:34:35] God and a Revival takes place on the
[1:34:38] inside of their heart and changes their
[1:34:40] attitudes and the atmosphere that they
[1:34:44] live
[1:34:45] in brother you may not have a pair of
[1:34:47] shoes on your feet you might be dressed
[1:34:49] in rags but there's something in your
[1:34:52] heart yeah that's singing The Melodies
[1:34:55] of God I'd rather have that than all the
[1:34:58] money in the world can I say this to you
[1:35:02] in Proverbs 15:15 all the days of The
[1:35:05] Afflicted are evil but he that is of a
[1:35:07] merry heart somebody say a merry heart
[1:35:10] he that is of a merry heart are you
[1:35:12] ready for this have a continual Feast oh
[1:35:17] my oh yeah B said there's two phases of
[1:35:20] this Christianity I spoke on it Friday
[1:35:22] night he said there's the int or mental
[1:35:24] conception he said but then there's the
[1:35:26] experimental experience he said that God
[1:35:28] has given the man in his heart he said
[1:35:30] the one intellectually is a hungry he's
[1:35:32] feasting on God but his Feast doesn't

[1:44:30] devour of consumption of the strength of
[1:44:34] body and mind by strong emotions I took
[1:44:38] the little book How The Angel's hand ate
[1:44:39] it up and it was in my mouth sweet as
[1:44:40] honey but as soon as I had eaten it my
[1:44:43] belly was bitter but he said unto me
[1:44:46] prophesy again before many prophets and
[1:44:48] Nations and tongues and Kings I love
[1:44:49] what the prophet of God says he said in
[1:44:51] this Sevenfold book of seven Redemption
[1:44:53] plans has been brought to us and that's
[1:44:57] what this book holds brother Jeff it's
[1:45:00] powerful he said now we're going to get
[1:45:02] over in the 10th chapter where this
[1:45:04] Mighty Angel proclaimed something and he
[1:45:06] had a little book that John had to eat
[1:45:08] and when he did he got it into his belly
[1:45:10] and it was bitter but it was but it in
[1:45:12] his lips it was sweet he said now when

[1:57:50] in fact I almost told you brother Andrew
[1:57:51] PR a Thanksgiving message and I didn't
[1:57:54] do that I don't tell preachers what to

[1:58:00] Andrew's heart and and we got so much to
[1:58:03] be thankful for

[1:58:07] read you know that if someone has a
[1:58:09] happy heart and it's thankful I'm
[1:58:11] paraphrasing but there're just a feast
[1:58:13] in front of them if you receive it in
[1:58:15] the right way you have the right
[1:58:17] attitude towards it and the right
[1:58:19] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:58:22] God will bring it to pass do we really
[1:58:24] believe that you grab a hold of the
[1:58:27] promises of God many of you will have
[1:58:29] dinner on Thursday and and another a
[1:58:32] wonderful time I know my mother loves
