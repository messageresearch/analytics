Uh, Sister Brittney, Brother Ben and Sister Britney sent this card into the church and it says, "Your kindness was so beautifully expressed through your thoughtfulness. Thank you everyone who helped out with the youth banquet last weekend. We really appreciate all of your help to make it possible. And I want to say we want to give every one of you a big hand. Give each other a big hand for helping. It was it was very nice. And uh we had good reports and and youth seem to enjoy it. So we're we're thankful for that. We want to do everything we can to help them on on this on life's journey. Amen. I love this song.

Oh, he gets sweeter as the moments fly. Oh, his love is richer, fuller, deeper, sweeter. He gets sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. That may be the wrong one, but we'll sing it like this.

And I'll be moving to a mansion just over in glory where I'm a rightful heir. Well, my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills, and I believe I own at least one. Well, I stand amazed when I see his face, knowing that I'm his son. Well, I'm rich in faith and hope and love. I got more than my share. And I'll be moving to a mansion just over in glory where I'm a rifle air. Well, I have a guardian angel. He's watching me. He's with me everywhere. But when I need my father in heaven up above, I say just a simple prayer. Last verse. Well, he's redeemed and forgiven me for all of my sins. He took me in and he's building me a mansion beyond compare. Oh, hallelujah. I'm a millionaire. Well, I'm rich in faith. All clap your hands and sing it now. And I'll be moving to a mansion just over in glory where I'm rightful. Well, I'm rich in faith and hope and love. I got more than my share. And I'll be moving to my mansion just over in glory where I'm a rightful heir. Give the Lord a big clap of praise tonight. Amen. How many's ready for the word of the Lord this evening? Amen. We'll sing this song here a couple times through as our pastor gets ready to come. Amen. And you are God alone. Aren't you thankful for who he is and what he means to us here tonight? Amen. Are you ready for the word of the Lord tonight? Somebody say, "Amen." Amen. You are not a God created by human hands. You are not a God dependent on any mortal man. And you are not a God in need of anything we can give by your plan. That's just the way it is. Oh, you are God alone from before time began. And you were on your throne. You are gone alone. And right now in the good times and bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. You're the only God whose power none can contend. And you're the only God whose name praise will never end. And you're the only God who's worthy &gt;&gt; of everything we can give. You are God and that's just the way it is. Oh yes, Lord. You are God alone. And before time began, you were on your throne. &gt;&gt; You are God alone. And right now in the good times and bad, you are on your throne. You are God alone and you are God alone. From before time begin you were on your throne. You are God alone. And right now in the good times and bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. You're unchangeable. Oh, you're unchangeable. You're unshakeable. Unstoppable. That's who you are. You're unchangeable. You're unshakeable. unstoppable and that's who you are. You are God alone from before time began. You were on your throne. You are God alone. Sing it now and right now in the good times and bad. You are not alone. You are gone alone from before time began. Oh, you were on your throne. Oh, you are God alone. Do we really believe that tonight and right now? Oh yes. In the good times and bad. Oh, you are on your throne. Oh, you are God alone. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads to him tonight. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, you are God alone. We're so thankful of that, Lord. No one could ever put us into your plan or take us out. You are God alone. There's no problem too big, no situation that you can't handle. You are God alone. Unmovable, unshakable without Lord taking. You don't have to take advice from anyone. Lord, we're so thankful for that tonight, Lord. So we submit ourselves to your will and to your way. And we thank you Lord for coming down the eternal unchangeable God. Coming down to our level Lord and walking among us oh God dying for our sins and then coming back to live within us. We're so thankful for that. I pray God that you'd just move in a mighty way tonight. Lord, if there's a need here, Lord, maybe uh something re that I wouldn't know about, but Lord, you know what it is. I pray you would meet that need tonight, Lord, that you would completely change the situation as only you can. I pray you'd grant it now in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Appreciate the presence of the Lord tonight in our service. We just uh love each one of you. Good to be here on a Wednesday night. Ephesians chapter 1:es 3-6. Tonight, Ephesians 1 3-6. U this Sunday, we'll have our regular service on Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon, we're going to have church at 3:00, but what we're going to do is a little bit different. We're going to lean into our youth a little bit. And uh we're going to have a youth service, but it won't be quite like what we've done in the past. We're going to have a youth service for the youth. So, what that means is you old people don't have to be here if you don't want to be. But, uh you if you do come, welcome to sit in the back and watch and partake in the service, but the uh young people, we're just going to lean into that for all of our young people Sunday school age and up. Uh we sure want you to be a part of that. And so, that'll be at 3 o'clock with the Joel's going to be preaching to them, something specific for them. And we're going to try to get feedback from them and and just have a a real youth service. They're going to be playing the instruments and and uh doing taking every part of the service. So have a youth song leader and everything. So we're looking forward to doing that. And how many love our young people? I I know that you do because you put so much effort and work into into them this last weekend. But that was our older youth especially got to benefit from that. But this we want to be for all of our young people, even our school age children. And so we're looking forward to that. But we'll have our regular service on Sunday morning as usual and our our dinner as well. Amen. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three. It says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings." Aren't you glad they're here tonight? All spiritual blessings are right here among us. Amen. Because we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now he said in in heavenly places in Christ in heavenly places in Christ that's where we are according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he made us accepted in the beloved. Aren't you glad to be accepted tonight? God bless you as you have your seats. Forgive me. My voice is not good at all tonight. I've been struggling with the same thing that many of you have been struggling with. So, y'all just pray for me tonight. When we think of heavenly places, we think of heavenly in the sense of experience. And I want to deal with heavenly places again tonight because I think it's important to us to understand that there is not just a place that we are that is heavenly place. It's a heavenly in the sense of experience, but it's a heavenly place in the sense that uh it's it's what God has called us to the position he's called us to be in. And in that heavenly place is actually where we fight our battles here on the earth. And that's what I want to title this tonight is the battle in heavenly places. So, a heavenly place. If I if you were to tell me uh that you went on a trip and it was heavenly, I wouldn't expect you to then tell me that you fought a battle while you were there. &gt;&gt; Because a battlefield would be what we would think of as the opposite of a heavenly place. &gt;&gt; But a heavenly place would be in in our vernacular would be something that would be a beautiful place, perfect weather, everybody treats you nice and everybody does what they're supposed to do. But that's not at all what Paul was referring to. The word heavenly simply means in heaven or of heavenly things relating to heaven or the sky. And and it's the place where God dwells. Heavenly places, spiritual places, a spiritual realm. Look how Paul uses that in chapter 3 of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 10. He says to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places. So he says there are principalities, there are rulers and there are powers in heavenly places. He might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. Uh in another version it says so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. So it God is going to use the church to show the plan of God and the wisdom of God to these authorities and rulers in heavenly places. Who are these authorities and rulers? Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 12, Paul says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities." There's that word again. Rulers against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high. And that word high is the same word used that Paul uses for heavenly in heavenly places. Spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. So it's actually a place of contest, a place of battle. It's a place. It's a position, but it's a position that we know we can win because remember, we have been raised with Christ into this battlefield, into this place. So, we know not only can we win, but we've already won the battle because he overcame for us. &gt;&gt; But we're not going to be able to just sit there and take it and say, "Well, you know, I've been I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. Everything's going to be good now." But it's actually a time of battle. Brother Brandham uses this scripture in a in a message called the contest. And he he likens the struggle that we're in to a great tug of war where the Indians would try to pull their opponent by brute strength across a fire. And it's kind of a brutal game, but that's what they would do. They would pull each other across the fire into the fire. And he said, "The devil's trying to pull us into the fire and and using his strength to do that." That's the battle that we're in. And he taught us that we must train for this battle by using the word. And he said we begin training. He said with John 3:16, &gt;&gt; right? That's where we begin training. God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. He said begin right there. Begin your training. He said, then you can go out and begin to fight the devil with the word. So, if you haven't ever entered into this contest, you begin with John 3:16 and you follow that with Acts 2:38 and you follow that with Ephesians 1. You you keep going with the word and you keep fighting your battle. And as you become trained, then you begin to use that in the battlefield that you're in in heavenly places in Christ. So the battlefield that we're fighting in in heavenly places, it actually takes form and the battle is joined in the mind. Brother Brandham said that was the no man's land that was given for the battle between good and evil. It's a battle between good and evil and and the mind is the no man's land. So it's a battle between faith and doubt, a contest of strength and it's a battle to control our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And whoever controls the thought life controls the battlefield, &gt;&gt; right? So that's the the land that's being fought over is the your thoughts. So it's it's for a person for who is sitting in heavenly places that you know you you sit there and think well if I'm in heavenly places if I'm the elected of God if I've been chosen by God if I am in Christ why is it that I I struggle in my thought life. Well, that's actually when you would struggle &gt;&gt; in your thought life, &gt;&gt; right? Because before you you maybe never even thought about those things, but now the devil's trying to get you to think the wrong things and then to act on those thoughts. And so and so that is actually when you would have it when you are in heavenly places. You've taken your position on the battlefield. You're now a warrior for the king. So, so that is the kind of person that actually would begin to fight in those ways. Now, if you just give into it, you don't fight. But as long as there's a battle, it means that means you haven't given in. It means you haven't been run over. It means that that it's possible. You know, somebody asked me said, "Well, have I blasphemed God?" If you had blasphemed God, there would be no battle. It would be over. You the devil would have won. But if you still fighting the battle, it means if those thoughts are still there, I want to be a Christian. and I want to be right. I want to do the right thing. It means that God still has a place for you. &gt;&gt; There's still a battle to be fought. &gt;&gt; So, it's possible, and I want you to listen to me. I want you young people to listen to me. And every one of us need to hear this. It's possible for a person sitting in heavenly places who is a born again Holy Ghostfilled believer who is that the person that we're preaching to tonight. It's possible for that person to be to say or do things that do not reflect the state of their soul. &gt;&gt; Right? Because that it would be just a moment of weakness in the battle. But it doesn't I'm so glad that doesn't mean that he got me right. If I make a mistake, I know I have an advocate with the father that he's able to forgive me in a moment of time &gt;&gt; and we just move on. And a lot of maturity is learning how to deal with our mistakes &gt;&gt; and not just wallowing in them. So, brother Brandham is asked the question. And he said, "Is it possible for a Holy Ghost filled person to be influenced to do minor things he doesn't want to do?" And he said, "Oh yes, yes, sir. Yeah, a Holy Ghost filled person, you're right in the place then to be drove by these things. You just put yourself up a target." I know that doesn't feel very heavenly, but it's it's the place where uh you you've been put into a position for a reason. you've been put in this and I mean position by position I don't mean this instance of a pastor or something like that I mean the pos your position in Christ &gt;&gt; right all of us have a position in Christ in heavenly places and we've been put there for a reason to fight now he said when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any way you want to right the devil don't care but once you take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side. Then he trains every gun right around on you right now and you put on the uniform right and now you become a target. He said every temptation, everything that could be throwed to you, then you got it. But what have you got? What do we have tonight, church? What do we have? We've got greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. So we know going in that our team, our captain, our king is stronger than Oh, hallelujah. When the devil's trying to pull you through the fire, remember the one on your side is stronger. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he every temptation now to be tempted is not to sin. &gt;&gt; We need to understand that. Brother Brandon in one place even said that Jesus endured sexual temptation. because he was tempted, the Bible says, in all manner like we are, &gt;&gt; right? He endured all kinds of temptation like we do, but he didn't never give into it, &gt;&gt; right? He was sinless. Now, we've given into it at times, &gt;&gt; right? In different ways and different kinds of temptation, but yet there is a victory that we can have, &gt;&gt; but to be tempted is not to sin. &gt;&gt; Now, he said every temptation will be thrown at you. He said, 'Now, you wasn't in no battle here. You was just slopping along. But now, you've cleaned up. You've dressed up. You've shaved. You've combed your hair. You put on a uniform. You got a gun in your hand. Let's go. See, you're in battle. Not to show off, but to fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Fight. Fight." Said that before Trump did. He said, "Sure. When the temptations arise with the spirit, the shield of faith," he said, "buck it off and move on." See, that's right. Put on the whole armor of God. Why do you put on an armor if you're not going to fight? All soldiers are dressed to fight, not to show off. Walk out and say, "I'm so and so. I'm a Christian. See who I am. I belong to so- and so. Hallelujah. I got the Holy Ghost the other night. Sure. Nothing bothers me anymore." He said, "Uhuh. Oh, brother. I believe you better go back and try again." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You're going to have plenty of trouble. But remember, can we remember tonight? You're I'm trying to bring it to your reme to your remembrance, to your memory. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to face opposition. Now, how do you deal with the opposition that you face? You say, "Well, I'm overwhelmed." Well, the only way you see because this is why Jesus said, "Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof." Because if you face opposition all at once, you're going to feel overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; But what do you do? What you have to do today, &gt;&gt; right? That's the only thing you can face is what you have to deal with today. &gt;&gt; What do you face? What's in front of you? &gt;&gt; Right? What's hindering you? What's stopping you? That's what you fight. &gt;&gt; You fight that. Well, I can't fight the whole army, right? And that's where so many battles are lost because individual soldiers look out at the the state of the entire battle and say, "Well, I might as well give in because we're losing." Right? Now, we know we can't lose, but it might appear that way sometimes. So, but if we could hone that down to just what we're facing, whatever you're facing, if the devil's trying to bring depression on you or anxiety or maybe there's some besetting sin or something that you're facing, fight there. Yeah, &gt;&gt; right. Overcome there. Take care of that situation. Don't try to solve everybody else's problems. You can't solve everybody's problems. You can't deal with everything going on in the message. You can't deal with everything going on in the church. Fight what's in front of you. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham talked about that. He illustrated that by giving us the illustration of Peter Cartrite and the drunkard. You've heard the story. Peter Cartwright goes to have a meeting and he's fixing up the the hall where he's going to have the meeting and painting it and doing fixing it up and he goes in there to uh to do that and a drunkard comes in. He swore he wouldn't let him have the meeting and he come in there and he said I've told everybody I'm not going to let you have this meeting. He said he said I I'm going he said uh he said I'm going to stand in the way. I'm not going to let it happen. And and and and Peter Cartwright said okay. He said well I guess I'm going to have to whoop you first, right? because the drunk wasn't going to let him have it. So what's he got to do? Whoop the drunk, &gt;&gt; right? That because that what was what was standing between him and having the meeting, doing what God called him to do. And so he said he rolled up his sleeves and he said if I he said if I if I should rain, I must fight if I should reign increase my courage, Lord. And said he went to pounding on him. And pretty soon the drunk said enough. And he come that night and got saved. But now, Brother Brandham tells us, he said, "Don't use your fists." It's an important caveat there. He said, "Don't use your fist." But he he says, "There you are. See, it's take the word of God. Cut your way through every doubt. &gt;&gt; See, sure. That's it." He said, "That's the next job." &gt;&gt; Let's get it done. &gt;&gt; Right? Instead of worrying about what everybody else is doing and what everybody else is facing and let's just get it done. Let's get this next job done. Lord, whatever I'm in need of tonight, whatever I'm facing, let me get that done. &gt;&gt; Then we'll move on to the next job. Maybe we can help somebody else. &gt;&gt; But take care of that demon in front of you first. Let's get rid of that doubt that you're dealing with first. He said, "That's the next job. Let's get it done. Next thing I'm going to do is get away from my doubts. Cut it down. That's my next job. Is get all my frustrations away." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Frustrations keep us from serving God like we ought to. So we who are in heavenly places ought to fight against frustration. &gt;&gt; Fight against that. If my senses tell me, "Well, you feel bad." The next thing to do is cut that thing away. What are we doing? We're fighting, church. I'm fighting tonight. I've got senses, too. I've got I got a body that's been sick, too. But I'm fighting that feeling. I feel bad. Say, "Lord, I can do it by the power." I believe we can all do that tonight. We can fight against that. Well, I'm tired. I feel bad. It's just a Wednesday night service. Let's fight through that thing. &gt;&gt; That's what's keeping you from what you need tonight. &gt;&gt; Cut that thing away. You say, "Well, they tell me that, you know, my conscience tell me, Brother Brandham, that's what gets a lot of people." See, they they would worship God, but their conscience gets in the way. You know, we're taught by Disney to always follow our conscience, &gt;&gt; right? Walt Disney said, "Let your conscience be your guide." But did you know that's not entirely true? You &gt;&gt; should only follow your conscience if your conscience lines up with the word. &gt;&gt; Right? So if that little cricket gets to Excuse me for using Walt Disney references. I know none of you have ever seen Pinocchio, but you know that little cricket gets to saying something that's not right with the word. What do you do? &gt;&gt; Smash the little thing. &gt;&gt; Get rid of him. He's just a bug. If you don't line up with the word, he's not right. &gt;&gt; See, a lot of times your conscience because you put something under the blood, but your conscience will tell you it's still there. &gt;&gt; You've been forgiven be because the word says you're forgiven and you know you experience the grace of God and and and and you ask him for forgiveness. He forgave you. And yet you stand there and you say, "Well, here I' I've done this awful thing and your conscience get in the way." Well, that's what's standing between you and the promise. He said, "You might as well cut that thing away. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get no further than that." &gt;&gt; He said, "Just get your next job done. Take off your coat and bear right into it. Just keep on going. One objective. I'm going to win." How many can say that tonight? I'm going to win. Amen. I can't lose. I'm going to win. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So, we know there's a battle that takes place in heavenly realms, in heavenly places, and other dimensions that has an effect on us. And it's illustrated perfectly by Daniel chapter 10. We'll just read through that really quickly as we go tonight. Daniel chapter 10, this is where the angel comes, the vision comes to Daniel and he's troubled by it and he prays and the angel comes to him. Daniel 10:1, in the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, the thing was revealed unto Daniel. The thing was true, but the time appointed was long. And he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision. In those days, I Daniel was mourning. Three full weeks. Now look, for 21 days, three weeks, Daniel is mourning like he had lost a loved one because he he doesn't know what God's going to do. He's not sure what the vision means and he's not sure what's going on and and and so there's a maybe he can't even fully explain why he's so upset, but it's because there's a battle going on in heavenly places. Now, he's not directly involved in this battle, but yet he is by by fact by the fact that he's waiting on an answer to prayer and it doesn't come immediately. And so he's waiting on the answer. And so he's praying and he didn't give up, but he was mourning three, four weeks. He said, "I ate no pleasant bread, neither confession nor wine in my mouth. Neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled." Other words, he didn't even he didn't even take a bath. He didn't he he couldn't even get up. He was just stricken by grief and by worry and by stress and and he's his his anxiety, we would say today, is through the roof. and he don't understand what's going on like he's having a mental breakdown. And then the four and 20 20th day of the first month as I was by the side of the great river and I lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of Ufaz. His body was also was like the barrel. His face is the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire. His arms and his feet in color like in color and polished brass. the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. And I, Daniel alone, saw the vision. But the men that were with me sown off the vision. If you go back and take the visions that Daniel saw and look at what brother Brandham's visions were like, they weren't different. They were very similar. &gt;&gt; The way Brother Brandham saw visions and the angels that he saw and things, if you compare that to modern charismatic circles, it's it's completely different. They're talking about things the Bible doesn't talk about. But brother Brandham talked about things in in a scriptural way because what he saw was the same things that Daniel was seeing, John was seeing in the book of Revelation. So he said, he said, "They fled to hide themselves. Therefore, was I left alone. Saw this great vision. There remained no strength in me for my clanliness was turning me to corruption. I retained no strength. Yet I heard out of the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, I was in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground. And behold, a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hand. He said unto me, "Oh, Daniel, man, greatly, beloved. Understand the words that I speak unto thee." Notice what the angel does. The angel understands the frame of mind that Daniel's in. In that frame of mind, in that upset condition, he can't even even accept the word of the Lord. He can't even hear the word of the Lord. And now his answers come. But first, the angel has to settle his spirit. Like the way we come to church a lot of times on Wednesday night or on Sunday morning. We're so upset by what's going on. We're so upset by what we've heard or what we've experienced or what our job was like that week or what what our kids or our grandkids or something else that it's hard for us to get. And so what does the angel first have to do? Settle our spirits. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Encourage us. &gt;&gt; Oh man. Amen. Greatly beloved. Understand the words that I speak unto thee. Stand upright for unto thee am I now sent. When he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. Then said he unto me, "Fear not, Daniel. For from the first day," oh, I love this. Daniel didn't know it. But from the first day that thou set thine heart to understand, and to chasen thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. &gt;&gt; But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one in 20 days. See, we don't even comprehend the battle that is going on. between angels, fallen angels, right? And God's angels. The fallen angels retain their authority, right? Although they've left their first estate, but they're not weakened, &gt;&gt; right? They still have power, but it's only under under permission under Satan. But now they but they still are able to battle. They're able to war. And so he said the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 days below Michael one of the chief princes came to help me. Hallelujah. I remained there with the kings of Persia. He said now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days. For yet the vision is for many days. So in other words, he's telling him if you got a long ways yet to wait. And when he spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb that he couldn't speak. Behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spake and said to him that stood before me, "Oh my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me. I have retained no strength. For how can the servant of this, my lord, talk with this, my lord? For as for me, straightway there remainth no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me." Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me and said, "Oh man, greatly beloved, fear not. Peace be unto thee." He said, "And be strong. Yay, be strong." And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my Lord speak, for thou hast strengthened me." Do you see how this spiritual battle is going on, but he needed to be strengthened so he could hear the word of the Lord. I think, man, that's what's going on in our day and age that we live in many times in Leodysia. We just all our strengths been sapped out of us. We find ourselves like Daniel unable to comprehend and understand the word of God. And we need to be encouraged by the angels of God. That's why we need to spend time with God. We need to spend time in prayer. Not just spend time with our news and things of the world, but to spend time with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Daniel was praying, that's when the angel came. Uh, brother uh uh Joshua Josh uh uh Bennett was speaking on that in the in the meetings that we were at at True Word Tabernacle and it just touched my heart. It's when they were praying while they were praying. It was the title of his sermon. He brought how Daniel was praying. Each one of these men of God were praying and that's when the angel came. I want to be found praying. I believe the answer to prayer. I believe he's already heard my prayer but let me pray till the answer gets here. Now he said when he had spoken to me I was strengthened. He said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me and said he knowest not knowest thou. Wherefore I come unto thee. Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I'm gone forth lo the prince of Grecia shall come. But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth. There is none that holdeth with me in these things but Michael your prince. We know Michael is Jesus. So we believe that's enough. &gt;&gt; That's enough. Brother Brandon always takes this Daniel praying for 21 days. And thank you for bearing with me as we read the whole chapter. But he he takes this to the two women you remember who got healed in his meeting. He said and and he said he there were words of blessing spoken over each one of them in the same meeting and they happened to live in the same neighborhood, right? And there was six weeks between the time of the meeting, he said, when the words were spoken and the time of their healing. And he always liked that. He said, "Remember Daniel prayed and it was 21 days before the angel could get to him." He said, "How many knows that when the angel of the Lord pronounced that blessing, he's talking about the women." He said, "What if she would have give up? Satan would have come right in, but she held right on." Remember the two women, one of them had a bad stomach and couldn't eat. And brother Brandham saw her going away eating. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And so he says, "You're healed." And she goes away. The first day, nothing. She's still sick every day. The second day, the third day, six weeks, she does that. &gt;&gt; Until her husband tells her, "You need to quit testifying of your healing. It's embarrassing because you still can't eat nothing." &gt;&gt; Right? And she said that she had gotten made the kids breakfast one day and she saw a piece of toast there and she thought, "Well, I'm going to get sick, but I'll try to eat it anyway." And she went to eat it. When she did, she didn't get sick. And pretty soon, she made herself some bacon and eggs and she didn't get sick and she got so excited and she said she run down the street and there was the other woman had been prayed for had an external uh not a cancer but had an external like a growth on her and and she had been told she was healed and she was waiting. He said she run down there. She heard her hollering and she was shaking the sheets. Remember, because she was looking for that growth cuz it had fallen off. He said, "What had happened is the angel of the Lord came through the neighborhood." &gt;&gt; Now, I can't even explain that. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how that works, but I know there's a spiritual battle going on in heavenly places. Lord, help me to be patient. Help me to wait. Help me to be ready at the moment. Help me to keep my testimony. Even when it seems like I don't understand what's going on, let me be strengthened by the words of the angel. I believe we have words spoken by the by the seventh angel on this day. We can be strengthened by those words. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said she held right on and he passed through the neighborhood that morning. He knows where you live &gt;&gt; all about you. If there's anything we should have learned from brother Brandham being able to stand up there and he would tell brother Paul he would tell them their names and their addresses. &gt;&gt; Why did he do that? They had to know he knew where they lived. &gt;&gt; Cuz the healing always wouldn't be immediately. Sometimes the angel had to visit their house. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look, brother Brandham says if he if he knows you here, he knows where you're at. So in other words, if he knew who they were in the prayer line, he knows where they're at. When he gives you the blessing, he will confirm it if you'll just stay with it. &gt;&gt; So our part of that battle. So it's not like we're out here fighting. You know, um I know the charismatics today, they they have um uh battle flags and they they wave flags back and forth and they're fighting demons and and some of them get actual swords and pass them out and and I guess I don't want to mock that because may maybe that helps their faith. I don't know. But a little plastic sword from Kmart or Walmart or wherever doesn't help my faith at all because I understand that spiritual battles can't be fought that way. &gt;&gt; Right? That's not how we fight battles. &gt;&gt; We don't fight them like that. We fight them on our knees. &gt;&gt; Right? Our job is to stay encouraged, to stay with it, to to hold on, to to to to surrender to his will and say, "Lord, I know there's a battle going on, but Lord, I'm going to be right here on my knees, ready and waiting when the promise comes." &gt;&gt; See, the battle is in between the promise and the fulfillment. And that's where we are in heavenly places &gt;&gt; in Christ because we're on our way to the fullness of our adoption, to the change of the body. So in the land of adoption, we're gaining the maturity to believe for the fullness of our adoption. Are are you with me now? So anyone can believe in an instant miracle, but Abraham's seed believed the promise, &gt;&gt; right? Even if it takes 25 years. &gt;&gt; We're in a journey. We're in a journey to our destination. Our destination is the millennium. That's where we're headed. It's the marriage supper before that. That's where we're headed. It's the rapture. But what Paul is trying to make us understand in Ephesians is that we're already there &gt;&gt; in the mind of God. And and not only has our birth been predestinated, but our adoption, our placing, our future home has been predestined. Amen. We've been predestined to the adoption of sons. We'll get into that. We've been predestined to heavenly places. We've been predestined to win the battle. I wonder if we can understand that tonight &gt;&gt; if we can by faith order our thoughts. Now listen, why write the book of Ephesians? Because if you think about it, well, if you're predestined, you know, what's the point of writing it because it's going to happen anyway. And if you take that view and you go off on extreme Calvinism, then there's no real point doing anything, right? But God predestines us to a place for a purpose. Hallelujah. So what happens is we've been placed in in a in in a in a battle and God says you're going to win, but you got to fight, &gt;&gt; right? For every inch of the ground. So what how do we fight? We by faith we order our thoughts to align to line up with what has already happened in our souls. And when our when our mind when we are renewed in our minds by what has already happened in our souls, we begin to win. We begin to be victorious in every battle against the devil and the flesh. &gt;&gt; Right? bec but we've got to that's where the battleground is and you have control over that even as predestined sons and daughters of God. You have control over that mind, right? The battleground. So, uh we we will be victorious in every battle if we line our thoughts up with the word of God. 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse three, it says, "Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." I love that. Casting down imaginations. Listen, Paul's not dealing with some kind of a foam sword. He's not dealing with some kind of flag. He said it's imaginations you're waring against. It's a high thing, a heavenly thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God &gt;&gt; and bringing into captivity. We preached on that before, how that you have control over your borders, &gt;&gt; right? you that that the the the mind. We should not give the province of the mind over to the to Satan. We we have a right to guard our minds &gt;&gt; and to protect it, not to just leave it open, but to protect it from the enemy and say, "I'm not going to let you in. I'm going to cast down imagination. If if he tries to sneak in in some way and tell me a certain thing about myself that's not in the word or a certain thing about somebody else that's not in the word, I'm going to cast that thing out. I'm going to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. See, when we enter into the land, Satan will do everything he can to give us thoughts like the giants are too many, right? That's what he did to them. He won the battle the first time they went in. Remember when the 10 spies went into 12 spies went into the land, 10 of them come back with a bad report? How did he win the battle in the mind? &gt;&gt; He didn't have to fire a shot physically &gt;&gt; for them to lose. They said, "We're grasshoppers in front of him." &gt;&gt; It felt like, "Brother David, you you missed out on brother Nathan Sunday. We were going to have you all stand together and take a picture." But but that's what it must have been like, right? Like looking up like this, right? And and it must have been like that when they went into the land like, "Well, there's just no way." and they were right &gt;&gt; humanly speaking. Joshua and Caleb said, "We have a promise." So, he's going to give us thoughts. He's He's gonna say, he's gonna tell you, "I'm not forgiven." &gt;&gt; Right? That that's a thought of the enemy. I'm not forgiven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We'll say, "Well, is it sometimes a thought from God?" &gt;&gt; What do you think? Would God ever tell you you're not forgiven? &gt;&gt; He would reach out in mercy and forgiveness. He wouldn't tell you you're not forgiven. &gt;&gt; See, that's something you're forgiven because we're looking at I know young people a lot of times will tell me, "So, I just hope God could forgive me. Forgive you 2,000 years ago." &gt;&gt; Your sins were judged in his body on the cross. How could you be more forgiven than that? &gt;&gt; You just have to accept that, &gt;&gt; right? So a thought could be I, you know, maybe I could never be a Christian like this other person. I I could never be a deacon like this other deacon. I could never be a preacher like this other preacher. I could never be a young person like this other young person. You don't know what that other young person has fought. &gt;&gt; But the devil bring those thoughts, right? I I'll never be healed. Huh? We're we're closing in just a few minutes, but I I know you all have fought this battle, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'll never have peace. &gt;&gt; I'll try to tell you young people, I I'll never be able to have a home. Never be able to have a wife or a husband. I I I'll never be able to do things right. I make so many mistakes. I I'll always act this way. I I made this mistake before and here I made it again. I'll always do it. &gt;&gt; I just make too many mistakes. &gt;&gt; I could never be. See, but but we limit I think brother Nathan talked about that maybe Sunday or Saturday night. We we tend to limit God by what we we we limit ourselves and what God can do with us. But these thoughts will always come to us. That's the thing. They will never quit. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Satan's got a punch at us. &gt;&gt; He does. Brother Brandon talked about a young minister and his wife. He said, I was talking to a young minister and his wife in the room. He said, both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world, rest of the human beings on earth. And I said, remember, Satan's got a punch coming at you. Don't care who you are. He's got a right for that one punch. He said, which would you rather be, that punch? Be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous? See, I know a lot of people would love to be wealthy, but if you were wealthy, there would be something &gt;&gt; that you have to deal with. &gt;&gt; I I knew a man, it comes to my mind because his son just got married, but I knew a man that that uh had retired wealthy and his dad had worked and his granddad in a farm and they by by their own labor they built up a huge farm and retired with a lot of money and he was going to go live it up. He was about 50 years old, able to retire at that age and moved to Tennessee and was going to going to just live the and and he had earned it. He deserved it. He'd worked hard all of his life and immediately got cancer and died. See, there's something there's something that is going to affect your life, &gt;&gt; whether you got money, whether you got health, whether you whatever it is. So, brother Brandon said there's a punch coming at you. He's got somewhere he can punch you. He's got a right to that open place. Now, that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time, &gt;&gt; right? So, there's something you're prone to. Whether it's sickness, whether it's disease, whether it's whether it's evil thoughts, whether it's carnal thinking, maybe maybe gossip, maybe maybe struggling in in in how you deal with people or or how you treat people or things like there's something. I know what my weaknesses are &gt;&gt; and so do you know what yours are. &gt;&gt; Right? But it's not that we have to give into that. He doesn't tell us we have to give into it. &gt;&gt; He said keep it covered. &gt;&gt; Keep it covered. Watch yourself in that area. Put an extra an extra uh brigade of soldiers in that area &gt;&gt; to keep that spot in the wall. &gt;&gt; See, Satan is a student of psychology. He started that with Eve. He knew where Eve's weaknesses were. He knows your weaknesses like a boxer. Knows where to where to punch, right? He he studies like a boxer. Brother Brandon said we should do that. Study our enemy, &gt;&gt; right? But he the Satan studies like a boxer or a pitcher who knows where to throw the ball, right? Like a Greg Maddox. And some of y'all know what I'm talking about. See, Greg Maddox couldn't throw very hard, but he knew exactly where to throw the ball, &gt;&gt; right? And if you get it in the right spot, even the best hitter can't hit it &gt;&gt; because every hitter has a weakness, &gt;&gt; right? And so he studied those weaknesses here recently, last year, excuse me for a minute, but they they banned the shift in baseball. And what the shift was is for you non- baseball people is the the shift was they would put all the infielders on one side of the infield because they knew this batter cannot hit to the left or to the right. They knew that he had a weakness. So what they did is they loaded up one side and left the other side open and no matter how hard he tried, he had a weakness. He couldn't do it. So what they do? They studied his weakness. &gt;&gt; Right? I think we ought to, if the devil's going to study our weakness, we ought to study the devil's weakness. &gt;&gt; What is his weakness? The blood of Jesus Christ. He's already been overcome by the word of your testimony. By the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony. That's his weakness. &gt;&gt; But see, he he studies your weakness. That's the spot. He knows exactly where to throw that pitch to get you to hit into the shift. &gt;&gt; Right. Hit it right to the person. And you think, well, I just do it every time. Well, that's where you got to train yourself. I knew a guy who he was a great big home run hitter. But what he learned to do was bunt. And he bunt it against the shift. And after a while, they quit doing that to him because he learned that it all he didn't have to hit a home run. All he had to do was bunt his way on because they left his way open the other direction. So, you're always going to have your strong places and your weak places. You're in a battle. Everyone's fighting a battle. Don't let condemnation ruin your effectiveness because that's what happens to a lot of a lot of times to to batter to hitters who they get a weakness and once pitchers start start exploiting that instead of covering that up and you seeking an area of strength they get so worried about it and so concerned about it that they end up not being able to do anything and they end up getting put out of the major leagues because they can't hit it all. But you're fighting a battle. Don't Don't let condemnation ruin your effectiveness because you're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Everyone fights a battle. The Bible said there's no temptation taking you but such as is common to man. &gt;&gt; But God is faithful. How many are glad he's faithful tonight? Who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able, but will with the temptation also. Someone say also. &gt;&gt; Also, hallelujah. Also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it. I've told you many times, but that way of escaped, if you look in the original Greek, is in other words, there will be a place that you can swim to. &gt;&gt; There will be land. You won't be shipwrecked without land in sight that you can swim to. If you're willing to swim, you're going to make it. It's close enough that you can make it. You've got the strength to do it. You just got to be willing to swim. &gt;&gt; You won't drown. There's land in sight. Swim with all your might. But the battlefield of the mind is populated with thoughts. And thoughts are created by what comes into the five senses primarily by hearing and seeing, but even sometimes by smelling or or or something like that, touch, but especially by hearing and seeing. And these senses then feed the five senses of the spirit. So you see something or you hear something, it feeds your memory and your imagination, right? And so what you see or hear might make you imagine a thing. There's a illustration. I'm real close to done. So just hang with me for a minute. Are y'all with me so far? &gt;&gt; There was a illust I illustration that I like that that talked about a preacher's car because I've actually done this that a preacher didn't have anywhere else to park. So he parked in front of a liquor store. And of course the church gossip figured it out and she's telling all about it. And so that night, the preacher parked in front of her house, left his car, but but I I had to I did that one time. I was uh I was trying to get some Cajun food and the Cajun food was in the in uh the liquor store parking lot and I didn't think about it. I just parked in the parking lot, went over and got the Cajun food. As I'm standing there waiting on my food, I thought, "Oh no, everybody knows my truck by now. everybody, you know, oh no, I'm in trouble. Nobody ever said anything. But what if you seen that &gt;&gt; right now? You might dismiss that. But what if you previously had a pastor who was a drunk, &gt;&gt; right? Or what if you'd struggled with that? See, there might that's a then memory start to come. &gt;&gt; Imagination feeds on memory, &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes that memory is so deep you don't even know it's there. until something triggers it. &gt;&gt; So, you would never remember it until something like that happens. You see something or you hear something, it triggers a memory and you think, "Oh, he's just like that." Right now, just we're just human beings here tonight, right? But now, the modern method of dealing with that, if you go to a college today, they try to avoid the triggers, right? So, you just avoid, it's kind of like allergies, you I know our young people get allergies today and I have allergies to things and but you know that what they found out recently there are no allergies in the Amish community and the reason is because they're exposed to dirt. &gt;&gt; That's what they found out. And I don't I don't we're not going to go back and live like the Amish, but they found there's no allergies in the Amish community. Almost almost immune from it. And but it's just the they're so exposed to dirt. Now they may get some other things but but they don't get allergies but but the modern method is just avoid the triggers but the gospel method is not to do that but to cast down the stronghold &gt;&gt; right take the if we find we have a weak place and that memory starts to come up fight that thing &gt;&gt; right stand against that thing &gt;&gt; you can't help but think things especially if you've been through some things &gt;&gt; but we don't have to act on those thoughts &gt;&gt; but the answer for anxious thoughts or thoughts contrary to the word. It's not to quit thinking, &gt;&gt; right? That tickled Peter for some reason, but we don't quit thinking. We think different thoughts, right? Fill the battlefield with soldiers. You remember the the the war in Iraq? You remember what happened in in Iraq? They had it was falling apart and they they were losing &gt;&gt; and General Petraeus went over there and he they called it the surge. What did they do? Just put bodies in there. They just didn't have enough soldiers to fill the place up to make it and they quelled the violence. And Iraq is a is a better country today. And we don't hear that much about it because there's not that much going on in Iraq now because of that surge that they did. What do you got to do? Surge thoughts, good thoughts into the battlefield. How do you do that? By hearing the word. Hallelujah. By reading the word. by taking in the word into those senses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And what do you do? You surge. What what kind of thoughts do you surge? He said, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. What are you doing?" Filling the battlefield of the mind that that the battle of heavenly places, you're winning it by surging the right kind of soldiers into it. Look at the next verse. Verse nine. He said, "These things which those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do." I love that he didn't just tell you to do it. He said, "I want you to do what I've done." &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you right then, Paul had to fight that battle. &gt;&gt; He knew how to tell us how to fight the battle of the mind because he had to fight the battle of the mind. He was in prison when he wrote that about to have his head chopped off. He was nearly blind, only had one coat. We know that because he asked for it cuz he was cold. In a letter to Timothy, he says, "All men have forsaken me." What a tragic thought. Brother said they thought he was washed up. The Christian churches wouldn't even receive his letters. Many of them all men had forsaken him. His head was about to be chopped off, nearly blind, only had one coat. And he sat there and wrote the book of Ephesians &gt;&gt; and said, "We are we have all spiritual blessings &gt;&gt; in Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have been blessed and all. What was he doing? He was fighting that battle. &gt;&gt; And he said, "When you think on these things," he said, "What you've seen me do," said do that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan fought him like no other because he was that first church age messenger. Satan fought him like he did our messenger in the se the seventh messenger. Those two prophets who bookended the church ages. Satan fought Paul. We know he had a thorn in the flesh. But this was his testimony. 2 Timothy 4:7. I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. He could have went back and said, "Well, I failed here and I failed there and I messed up here and I messed up there and I and I didn't do right here because there he was a human being. There was many things he could have looked at, but he come back and he said he won the battlefield to the mind." He said, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing." What was he doing? Calling the symptoms around him lying vanities. And he said, "I may be in a smelly prison. Rats might be running across my feet, but I fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; Ready to go home." Musicians go ahead and come. Reading Paul's prison epistles. It's like interviewing someone who fought on D-Day or Normandy or Ewima. Some of y'all old enough to have known people who fought in the Second World War or even in Vietnam, some of the great battles there. If you ever have you ever seen one, you go down the street and I hate it that they're passing on. They're getting older. Go down the street and you'll see a bumper sticker says EEOima survivor, hero of Eoima. And I I can't chills run up my back when I hear because I know what that battle I've heard what that battle was like. &gt;&gt; I've never been there. I'd like to go. I've been to the battlefield at Shiloh here in Tennessee. And just awful the killing fields. I stood there by the pond, the bloody pond. It was filled with blood and looked at it and by the church where they so many men died. I stood there and thought, "Oh, to talk to a man who had been there and been through that. What a I've been watching on on the internet, you can watch videos of survivors that they've done and they'll tell their story and you get to listen to them and it's like, how did you do that?" But they just did what had to be done. Right? It was either that or die, right? They just did what they were just men, but they did what had to be done, right? And they they run right in the face of gunfire and everything else and and and and and changed the b the course of the battle and the course of history. But I want you to know there's been a spiritual war going on. There are battlefields in that war. And you and I fought in the battlefield of &gt;&gt; Leodosa, &gt;&gt; right? in in this great war that's going on when it's saying when 200 million demons have been released from the river Euphrates &gt;&gt; in our day where brother said released on who? Released on the bride. We fought that battle. [Music] Paul fought his battles but we fought the battle of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Think about it church. We ought to have grace for one another. When you see those old men who fought those battles, some of them you can see a spot in their head where they got shot. I remember a man coming in a flea market I was in years ago and he'd come in there and half of his face was cut out, his skull, and he just had a sunken place right there. And he told me he was a foreign observer in Korea and he'd been that had been shot away. And he said the average lifespan was like five minutes or some ridiculous thing and he had lasted for years, but he had been wounded many times. He would show me his scars and things and I was stood there in such awe because of the battlefield he was on. Listen, he wasn't nothing great. He was just an insignificant man who was drafted in the military. But he happened he was his exploits were great because of the battlefield he was on. Listen to me. I want to say this to encourage you today. There will be exploits uh people who were in a battle of Leodysa. &gt;&gt; Now I want to go a little bit further than that tonight. We've been in a battle. We fought the battle of Hardy, Arkansas. Come on, church. Some of y'all know what I'm talking about. Brother Hardy, you fought that battle. I've been fighting in this battle. That's not nothing against our area, but this is a place where the message, for whatever reason, there's a lot of message people. And and God chose this area of the earth to be a battlefield. We fought the battle when there wasn't no money. and huh it's hard to get make a living yet you brought your kids to church when everything it seemed like there was no point in it but you did it anyway I'm taking a little bit of extra time but I want to encourage you tonight you there's been a battlefield right here you say how can you say that brother Ben is what brother Brandham says he says I pray on that day when the crowns are given out to the saints he said that I will be standing back. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "When I see the Jonesboro group, I I just want this to encourage you. When I see the Jonesboro group come up there," he said, "I will be awful noisy." Because brother Brandham had been in this area and knew what some of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers and people fought in this area, the battle that they had fought to even make it, but they believed. They were simple people, but they believed. Brother Nathan and I were talking about that. And then when I found this this quote, I thought, "Oh, God, Lord, let me be a good soldier on the battlefield on the Jonesboro battlefield, on the Hardy battlefield, on the battlefield of our area." Cuz brother Brandon said, "When I see that group," he said, "I'm going to be awful noisy. I can see Brother Brandon when when when maybe if we're I don't know if that's the way it'll be, but if we go up by geographic area and we come up before the place where the thrones where the where the crowns are going to be given out and we walk up there and I can just see brother Brandham when he sees the Jonesboro group, he said, "I'm going to be awful noisy." He sees some of those he ministered to. Brother Logan was in Jo Jonesboro near there in Truman a little while ago and I'll share the whole testimony with you later or have brother Logan do it. But he met a man who was prayed for whose aunt was prayed for by brother Brandham and during those meetings he volunteered that information to him and he become a preacher. I wonder I don't know why brother Logan met him. Maybe maybe it was to encourage brother Logan, but maybe that man is part of that Jonesboro group. Maybe even sealed into another age, but part of that Jonesboro group. Brother Brandon said, "When I see that Jonesboro group come up, I will be awful noisy." I can just see Brother Brandon back there going, "Hey, hallelujah. Thank the Lord." We know he was prone to to be noisy when he got excited. He talked about running around the tree and we know he jumped up on the on the pulpit at times and he said, "I'll be awful noisy, I'm afraid, when I see him place." He said, "I think of what it'll be when the Last Supper is set there in glory and we've all overcome set across the table from one another. I will look across the table and see old battlecar saints sitting there, tears of joy running down their cheeks. What is it? We've been in a battlefield, church, but we're overcoming. We've been in a battlefield, but we're on the winning side. Don't give up now. Let Let the Let there come a an assurance in your heart. I'm going to think on these things. I'm going to do what's right. I'm going to keep coming to the house of God. I'm going to keep working for the for the Lord. I'm going to keep spreading the message. I believe I'm part of that group. It's going to come up. Prophet will be so excited to see. I believe most of all I'd like to hear our Lord say, "Well done." A good and faithful servant. Brother Brandham talked about the the soldier that got put into Pharaoh's chariot or into Caesar's chariot rather. He said he didn't pull a shined up soldier that had never been in battle, but he grabbed a a soldier that was had battle scars on him. Been through some things, Brother Bill. He'd seen some things, maybe made some mistakes, but he was a battlecar veteran. Oh, I'm so glad to be standing with you battlecar veterans. Be part of that group. When we've gone the last mile of the way and we've reached the end of everything we're doing here, I pray that it can be said about us. I've fought a good fight. I've kept the faith. How many want that to be your testimony? Hallelujah. Do you love him tonight? Amen. Let's bow our heads. Sorry I was stirred tonight, but I just don't have the voice to do what I wanted to do. But let's pray the Lord will somehow bless it. And there's a battlefield in heavenly places, but we are equipped and predestinated to win that battle. Let's win victoriously with joy in our hearts with our hands raised to God. Oh Lord, today I'm going to win. I'm going to I'm going to take what's in front of me. I'm going to I'm going to fight that and I'm just going to believe for the rest. How many would say amen to that tonight? I'm going to do that. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I thank you for your love and your goodness to us. I pray God that you just move in a mighty way. Lord, I I think of that Lord when I saw that quote about your prophet, how he said I'd be noisy. I had no part as a prophet, but as a pastor and a preacher here in this area, Lord, though I've not had a great ministry, but Lord, I I I've stood in this area and watched these people as they've gotten older. Lord, some of them I've been fighting beside for many years. Lord, I pray you'd help us tonight. Lord, those that are watching, some of them are sick right now, but this is just another phase of the battle. Lord, may we be victorious today. We believe that we will. Lord, when we get to the end of the way, Lord, may we be able to stand there with the hearty group, Lord. and shout for joy. The battle scarred veterans as we look in at one another and recognize that we've been given a crown of righteousness that you're appearing. We thank you for that, Lord. We couldn't earn that, but Lord, you gave it to us because we were put in a battle of heavenly places and we we won because of you. We were raised with you and we thank you for that. I pray you'd help us now encourage us, Lord, through the week. I pray you'd help us to lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us and run the race with patience. I pray you grant it now. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's just worship him. If you need prayer, the altar is open tonight. Let's stand together. Oh, [Music] &gt;&gt; we will not be defeated. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; we've got the power. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me your hand. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's sing it now. Let's agree together. &gt;&gt; Let's agree together. Oh, that all of our enemies, oh that all of our enemies, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, will crumble at our feet. &gt;&gt; Let let it give you courage for the paddle church. &gt;&gt; For whatever we b on earth, oh shall be bound in heaven. Thank you, Lord. is at the name of Jesus. Oh, Satan has to flee. &gt;&gt; Sing it now. We've got the power. We've got the power. Thank you, Lord. Oh, in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, we've got [Music] In the name of the Lord. Oh, though Satan raes, we will not be defeated. We've got the power [Music] in the name of the Lord. Oh, for many years now, Satan's tried to stop us. Oh, but the bride of Jesus, Lord, were still alive. Oh, like a mighty army, we keep marching onward.

Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise tonight. Amen. Aren't you thankful you're in a battle? Amen. You say, "Well, why would you be happy to be in a battle?" Because if you're in the battle, the devil hadn't got you yet. Aren't you thankful for tonight? Give the Lord another big hand clap of praise. You love him. And victory is mine. As we go now, God bless you. We'll see you Sunday morning. Well, victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory today is mine. Well, I told Satan to get thee behind. Victory today is mine. When I woke up this morning, well, I didn't have a doubt. I knew that the Lord would bring me out. So, I got down on my knees. I said, "Lord, help me, please." Well, I got up singing and shouting, "The victory." [Music] We're singing, "Victory is mine." Oh, victory is mine. Victory today is mine. All mine. Well, I told Satan to get thee behind cuz victory today is mine. I know love is mine. Oh, love is mine. real love.
