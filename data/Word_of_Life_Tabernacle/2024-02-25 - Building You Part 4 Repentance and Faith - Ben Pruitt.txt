that you know that he's here because he said he would be uh I thought brother Jonathan Reagan here this morning that's my wife's cousin those of you that don't know uh boy it's been a while probably the last time uh I stood in the pulpit and preached when Jonathan was in church he was probably this age some of these kids up here so thank you for being here this morning and uh God's done a a wonderful work in brother Johnson's life and he attends church out brother at brother Donnie Reagan's church at Word of Life Church in Tennessee and and just so good to see you this morning did my heart good proof that God can change a life amen you believe he still Chang his lives today I believe he's still doing that God bless you brother Jonathan good to have you this morning brother Joel

night service this week but there then we'll be attending those meetings those of us that can um next weekend brother Steward is going to speak to the youth on Sunday night and so be prepared for that and then we're going to have our communion service at night as well I'm looking forward to that I asked brother Stewart to do that for our young people and as brother Allan said we're very proud of them what God's doing for them we want to keep working with them as much as we can and then of course the week after that's going to be Youth Camp a lot of the older ones are going so be praying for them the Lord will just really uh bless them on that trip to Oklahoma I uh let's go to Psalms chapter 51 it says have mercy upon me oh God according to th thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning my grandfather on my on the prit side was a good man he uh was a farmer he lived for uh most of his life in the same area there around Neda Missouri in Fort Scott Kansas he was a man who was a man of his word kept his word and in fact he told me that he said if you're five minutes late to an appointment he said you lied to me and he was that kind of a guy he a very moral God-fearing man uh he was he was also a difficult man in some ways because he had a difficult time saying I love you as many men of his generation did he fought in the second world war and and had seen some things and I believe God did something in his life he wasn't a a message believer he was a uh a Church of God Holiness man he was faithful to the church he was a Sunday school teacher and a few years before he died uh the Sunday school at the church there in Neda Missouri gave him this Bible I was recently given this Bible and I I uh be to look through it and I saw where he he'd read through it a couple of times there in the last couple years of his life but he had Psalms 51 written it's the only scripture that he wrote on the fly leaf of the Bible is Psalms 51 and the the difference in my grandfather and the situation David was in struck me because David was a middle eastern King with 500 wives who uh had been he was a great musician and a a writer and and had a prophetic gift and my grandpa had none of that and he David had committed a a terrible sin and adultery and murder and as far as I know my grandpa had never been involved in anything like that and yet somehow that verse though he'd read through the the Bible and did that I think every year that that spoke to him in a way that maybe no other chapter in in the Bible did I got thinking about that and I I thought what could possibly how could he possibly identify with King David in that but I think every one of us at some point in our lives have prayed have mercy upon me oh god I've actually at times in my life went back to that scripture and I didn't know how to say I'm sorry because i' met messed up in some way and I come back to that scripture and I pray have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness not because I deserve it but because you're good Lord because you love me according to thy loving according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions have you ever prayed like that and he just put it in such a wonderful way Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin he said for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me and my grandfather had that underlined in his Bible I I know that as we were talking about building you building the individual God is doing something in your life as an individual yes and we know that we were chosen for the purpose of redemption right and well that means Redemption means that he's buying back something that he already owned that was already his so in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 Paul tells us we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth Paul makes this very clear in Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1: 15 having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein Heath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace and so we know that there's nothing we could do to earn the favor of God but we must accept his favor in the same way that they did at the beginning of the Gentile age through the process of repentance and Faith right and that's what I want to speak to you about this morning repentance and Faith as we continue to dwell on how God deals with us as individuals now in Acts 237 we find a group of people who have just heard what is really the First Gospel message that was ever preached as uh after the Holy Ghost fell Peter gets up and he begins to preach the gospel to him and he says he says this is what you've done you're responsible for the death of Christ and and this is this is how guilty that you are and the people the Bible says when they heard this when they heard the preaching of the word they were pricked in their heart they were pricked in their heart and every one of us has to be pricked in our heart at some time or another in order to be a Christian right amen and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do yeah now I want you to understand this morning that you cannot prick your own heart right right they were pricked in their heart but you can't do that to yourself that takes election it takes predestination it takes favor there's something that in your life that has to be there's something that has to be prickle if I can say it that way to coin a term it's got to be something that that is able to be pricked there's got to be something there there's got to be a conscience there so and that what that word means pricked it means to be goated and what they would do is they'd have a uh they'd have an ox go which was an instrument a stick with a very sharp end or very sharp point and it would actually prick the ox and cause actually a draw it would draw blood because it would it would hurt them but just just for a minute because they wanted them to turn a certain direction and so God wanted these people on the day of Pentecost to turn a certain direction and so he Pricks them in their their heart yes sir they are pricked by the preaching of the word Jesus told Paul he said it's hard to kick against the Pricks in other words it's hard when you're being pricked to go a different direction than he wants you to go I I want to thank God this morning for the overwhelming convicting power of the holy spirit that still convicts men of sin that still brings people to the altar that still makes them call out to God and cry out to God yes it's hard to kick against the prick if you're kicking against the Pricks this morning it's time to give in it's time to surrender it's time to just let him do his work acts 238 Peter responds to them this is he says this is what you what you're supposed to do to be saved repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost repent and be baptized repentance and Faith baptism being the outward work expressing an inward Faith repentance and Faith Paul in Acts chap 20: 21 he's looking back over his ministry and saying this is the things that that's been done in my Ministry and the things that the way I treated the people and things and the way I treated the word how faithful I was and so he says this in verse 21 testifying both to the Jews also to the Greeks repentance toward God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ so it takes both of those things repentance and Faith this is the foundation of your walk with the Lord yes right repentance and Faith it always comes back to repentance and Faith so now he's saying we we we now Paul in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse one he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on under perfection now he's talking to people who have repented who have believed yeah but he tells us what the foundation of our faith is he said not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God so he's saying there is a point as Christians when we need to come up high there's a point at which we need to we need to begin to establish that adoption in our lives be We Begin need to begin to establish the message as the rule of our life and those things but yet the foundation of all of that is repentance and faith and if you don't have repentance and Faith you cannot build there there's no place to build there's no Foundation to build on so that's the very bottom of the pyramid if we could put it that way is repentance and Faith yeah brother pandom talked about a man who preached on repentance every week and he said he that he preach on Sunday about repentance Sunday night about repentance Wednesday night he preached repent right and finally he he preached repent over and over and over and the Deacon board met with him and says why do you keep preaching repentance said we got that he said uh he said they said we we understand and they said why do you keep preaching on it he said well he said let them repent he said then I'll preach on something else right because you got to have a foundation right there's got to be a foundation of faith and repentance in your life now not everyone can repent because the ability to repent is a gift from God that's right amen acts 11: 18 says when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God saying then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance he has granted repentance if you are able to repent this morning that don't make you something more than somebody else it just means god granted repentance to you God granted a repentance Oh my he pricked your heart Hallelujah on not everyone can repent Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so that's sanctification in your life looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repent repentance why was he rejected I want you to I want you to watch carefully was not rejected for not being seed we know that he was not seed right but he was not rejected for not being seed because he said whosoever will may come right he was rejected because he found no place of repentance though he sought repentance carefully he he he studied it yeah he tried to repent yes even did it with tears but he didn't find a place of repentance oh church if we'd realize what a gift it is to be able to find a place where you know your sins are forgiven when you know it's all under the blood when you realize the world as a whole can't can't be like that they can never experience that they don't know what it's like to lay their head on their pillow and know that everything is under the blood and you are The sinless Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ The World At Large doesn't know that but you know that brother the Justin how do you know it because there's something about you the word spoke back to the word in your DNA there was written repentance yes something in that seed that was inside of you caused you drove you caused you to seek a place of repentance and you found it good amen now look in that word repentance is literally a change of mind a change of mind it primarily refers refers to a comprehensive change of one's orientation toward following God it's a noun equivalent of the verb which means to change one's mind like the verb it originally referred to a change of mind but in the time of the New Testament taking on a meaning in Jewish thought of a return to God yeah so it's a change of Direction repentance is a change of Direction now we know that in the natural birth we have water blood and spirit brother Bren talks about that in future home he talks about how that the seed uh the seed uh the seed birth how the the seed has to rot in the natural that there has to be a stalk a tossel and a Shu he said that's the three stages that bring you to the grain right how how many understand that that teaching we we may go back over it so the children understand things but you all this morning just as we're kind of dwelling on just one part of this but the seed has got to rot first yeah and that happens during the first stage that's part repentance and Faith when you believe at that time you also the seed has to rot in other words the shell around it the I should say you got to Die the say you got to die to yourself you got to die to your old ideas you got to die to what you want you got to die to everything but the word come on and then the word of the Caleb Works inside of you to produce something in your life so you got to die everything but the word now brother Bram said God vindicates that he's talking about that process he said God vindicates that that's always been right he said God vindicates it to be true it shows plainly he said the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption now how does it show that because only what has been a seed of corn will become a grain of corn right only what has be been a germ of wheat will become a grain of wheat right it's com oh my oh tell you what you are and who you are this morning so the predestin he said did you get it he said let me say it again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption he said people might be making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestined because the very word redeem means to bring back yes sir to bring back to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place he said Hallelujah so it's only the predestinated would be brought back because the others didn't come from there you said but I fail but you were brought back why are you back why did you come back to God why are you trying to serve God today but Daniel there's something there there's a seed of life there in the beginning it was with God it's going back to God and no matter what the shell wants to do how how much you you may fight that but something Pricks your heart and drives you to repentance right see he said he said the others didn't come from there he said being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was he said he wanted you he said he wanted me to stand in the Pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight he said then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose he said and then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified State it's matured and brought back again no wonder Paul could say when they was building a block to chop his head off he said oh death where is your sting oh great where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory he said death tell me where you can make me holler oh I love the way he puts it here grave tell me where you're going to hold me for I am a possessor how many can say I am a possessor I am a possessor of eternal life that's enough to make a Baptist shout I I am a possessor of eternal life he recognized it death hell grave nothing could hold him and nothing can hurt us we got eternal life he realized he was blessed with eternal life and when he types that to a do drop I love how simple the prophet was in his explanation he said the DW drop oh my yes sir you you've seen it in the morning when you go out and everything kind of shimmering because the de has fallen during the night and brother when the night gets cold and dark it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground it fell from somewhere yeah but the next morning before the sun comes up it's laying there the little fellow shivering but just let the sun come up watch it go to shiny yes he said it's happy why the Sun is going to call it right back to where it came from yes and that's the way with a Christian he said Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back by that power that's ping us how many believe that this morning do you really believe it you came came from somewhere your beginning was not in Hardy Arkansas your beginning was not with your mistakes your beginning was not in your natural DNA but somewhere on the inside is something Eternal you come from God you're going back to God glory to God amen amen the Sun is going to call that's why you can't keep doing what you always did that's why something's calling you you may not even believe understand at all but your life begins to change and things begin to happen while you're being called right back where you came from righten and I'll encourage you today if there's a seed of God and that process begins it might be stunned at times it might go through some dark days but the sun is behind the clouds and it will shine again and that one that seed that's there has got to come back to what it was it will not be stopped right the parents said that's the way with the Christian and we know when we walk to the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere We're Going Back Again by that power that's pulling us Little D drop he glistens and shines and shouts Oh Glory to God because he knows he come from up there and that son is going to draw him right back up again and a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows Hallelujah when he come in contact with a son of God he is going to be draw up from here all right someday amen all right and we know that repentance is the first work of a new believer the first work it's the beginning of a new creature of redemption to The Sinner and restoration to the backslider repentance is where it starts look at the Ephesian Church age Revelation 2:4 he said nevertheless I have someone against thee because because he said thou has left thy first love your backslid yeah right that first age he's speaking to the age that acts 2 happened in right right they've been filled and refilled with the Holy Ghost but somehow over time they lost their first love he said remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come un thee quickly and will REM remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent I want us to understand today that repentance is not just for Sinners that's right repentance is for Christians right listen brother BR said God tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something when you begin to see somebody live in a way that's not like a Christian but you know that they've been a Christian they they they they they believe the message of the hour they've been baptized they they've been filled with the the Holy Spirit but now they begin to live a certain way things begin to drift in their life and things begin to come in and they begin to do things that they would have never done you think why would that person be that way but you begin to realize they've fallen from something and there's something that they need to remember you need to remember where you came from you need to remember what it was like when you got saved you need to remember oh my you need to know what it was like to be a Christian again to to feel the joy of God in your life again and life gets so busy and you get so worried about everything else you forget what how much joy you had in the presence of the Lord you forget what it was like to sit in church and know that your sins were forgiven and everything was under the blood and the joy that that brought nobody can stop you but now you're worried about what everybody else thinks and what everybody else is doing wh what is it you need to remember and you need to go back what do you need to do repent right come back Hallelujah he said he told them to turn back in their mind signs to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it now look don't don't you realize why Satan hates this message and he hates the preaching of it yeah and he hates the he hates it when you get into it he hates it when you listen to it he hates it when you read it he hates when it's preached right come on why does he hate it because it takes you back to your point of origin and if you could ever get back to your point of origin there's nothing that you couldn't overcome everything in your life is just a maybe a little bump but you can overcome it you can make it why because your point of origin I don't want you to get too discouraged cuz somebody you said well that person was doing good for a while now they're not don't get too discouraged the fact the devil's after them is proof that God already got a hold of them the devil don't fight those that are his he's fighting those that are God's so we ought to be able to Rejoice knowing God's going to get them all right now look look he said they'd fallen from it they' forgotten the glory and wonder of it oh they knew they were saved that's good they knew that they were they they were Christians but they forgot the glory of it they forgot the Wonder of it yeah he said it was time to go back oh church this morning it's time for us as Christians to go back in a place in our minds and in reality where we know the Wonder of it again all right come on where we know the uh take me back lord and I prayed this week Lord I Want To Know Your Wonder yes I Want To Know Your Glory yes was time to go back in mind and then in reality back to when they could say for me to live as Christ back to Purity when ananas and Safar were dealt with back to the gate beautiful yes what did they do there they said such as I have I give yes sir oh what a reproach it is he said to drift from God and countenance those acts that defile his name you see somebody putting up with and not only putting up with but promoting yeah sinful things all right they need to come back you can't you can't just promote things in that's go on here in the world it's wrong you say well I don't do it but I don't mind if everybody else does no it's wrong it's wrong and we shouldn't countenance those things when you begin to countenance those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God can we say Amen this morning look at what you once were in your heart and mind and in your life then go back to it what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more all right repent bring forth fruits meat for repentance prove it by your life yes he said if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give life to the world it's light is turned to Darkness and people don't understand when repentance happens something changes it's not just a repentance of saying I'm sorry but something actually changes it's a it's a it's a burning up and a doing away and a and a and a rotting and a changing and it's a transforming it's something changes it's different and you'll see it in somebody's life somebody can say well I I've repented and then they have the same old attitude that they always had they they they just haven't really found a place of repentance right they might have said I'm sorry but they haven't found a place yeah I said church we need to find a place of repentance and that place is in the word of God that's good now look he said repent bring forth fruits meat for repentance Pro by your life if you don't then I will remove your lampstand and certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world its light has turned to Darkness God will then take away his faithful messenger and faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves they will go on talking about Christianity but be bereth of it repent quickly yeah quickly now you children can understand that when you when you put the Log on the Fire and you kick it out in the woods and you know you're the one that did it repent quickly right repent quickly don't hesitate you start lying and then you have to tell another lie on top of that lie right and you kids are old enough to understand that when is the time to repent when you do something wrong when you do something wrong at that moment you're going to do wrong sir you're going to mess up you're a human being but in those moments you you girls understand that you're going to mess up there's going to be times in your life Jasper that you that you mess up that that's part of being human but you repent quickly come back to the word repent quickly don't just say well I did that I might as well do something else might as well go no repent quickly you don't want to know what it's like to not have the presence of God in your life you don't want to leave the presence of God repent quickly come back to where you were don't hesitate no matter how embarrassing it might be to repent repent because it'll only be worse repent quickly don't hesitate evidently Ephesus did hesitate for a lifespan was not very long the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly it was not long until the city was in Ruins his glorious Temple became a shapeless Mass the land became a marsh inhabited by waterf the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalet village there was not even one Christian left now think about it the book of Ephesians was written to a mature Church yeah it was the model Church in the New Testament yeah right and within a few years there was not even a church there right why because they did not repent right he said the lamp was rent from its place he said now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must quickly it must be a true heart cry to God and sorrow and then God will restore amen the glory shall come again why why repent why does god require repentance well it's because we have a choice I've talked to you a lot about the seed and and how that you can't do anything to earn the favor of God and we believe that but he did put you here with a choice that when you are overwhelmed by his love you get to say yes yeah does that make sense when he arranges everything in such a way that that it seems like everything it's just the perfect timing you get to say yes now think about it Rebecca when elaser come down to get Rebecca she didn't she didn't have to hire the camels y all she had to do was water them y that's good she didn't have to it wasn't her servant that went out looking for Isaac she didn't have to go looking for him he came looking for her yeah and the servant came down the model servant elzer we know was the type of the messenger of the hour in this age he come down looking for her yeah the message came to you yes you didn't have to come to it it came to you right and it came to her and it came to her and her where where she was just going on in everyday life it came to her she had nothing to do with it coming but when the time come and they said will you go she said yes and that's what the true seed of God will do that's what the bride will do that's the one God has called that's what they'll do yes Lord when I hear the word yes Lord I will repent yes I'll live the word yes I'll do what God requires that's good yes yes Lord we have a choice the BR said you have a choice God made it so you can choose if you put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose and then they made the wrong choice he can do no more to you than he did to them he's got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject yeah because there's times God shows his favor to people you know because not everybody even knows but there are times God will show his favor and it hardens a person we're going to get into that for just a moment and I want you to thank soberly this morning because it's important to us the the elect have a choice even the non-elect has a choice God knows their choice that's where forn knowledge comes in now Hebrews 11:24 now again looking at it from God's side he's not worried about you making the wrong choice that's right right but from down here where we look at it yeah our choices directly affect our life that's right does that make sense yes so we look at it from down here now the elect and the non-elect have a choice Hebrews 11:24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God and to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect to the recompense of the reward now watch he chose he is the elect he's the one God called but he had to choose now look at Paul as as he balances this out in Romans 9:14 he said what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he sayith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy he had mercy on Moses that's why Moses could choose yeah it's good and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy and Paul introduces the other character excuse me the other main character in the story of Moses is Pharaoh yeah Pharaoh had a choice as well all right yeah but he said to to Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up right that I might show my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth so there were many nations where the king never heard right Moses message yeah but Pharaoh heard heard it right you've heard it today now you get to make your choice right whether you accept it or reject it but many don't even hear they're not considered in that and they'll they they're part of the whosoever will many don't ever hear but but there are those who here who accept it and there are those who here who reject it who were meant to reject it yet God cannot make them reject it right oh my and even he has to wait until they reject it over and over and over again you say why why doesn't God punish the wicked because he's waiting until the cup is full the cup of iniquity has to be filled sir yes oh my but he's got a limit to his patience with the non-elect but the elect oh my his mercies are new every morning there's no limit to his patience with Jacob but with Esau there's a limit there's no oh God I hope you recognize it today if you can still come back to God you run to God yes say well I have have I crossed the line not if there's a desire in your heart there is a cup there is a limit to Esau but there's no limit to Jacob all right yes all right a limit to Pharaoh no limit to Moses that's right the scripture said to Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up I might show my power in thee my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore have the mercy on whom he will have mercy whom he will he hardeneth that word hardeneth is to render stubborn yeah I want to be real serious with you this morning and brother Joel can preach you happy tonight I want you to understand stubbornness is a terrible sin the Bible says it's like witchcraft right right we cannot be stubborn with the word of God yeah even if we you say well I can't live it don't get in the way of somebody that can right and and trust that God can keep his word right don't be stubborn about it look look Moses had a deposit of faith in his life yeah he didn't put it there it was there right he could choose to follow the people of God because he could believe yeah oh Church in spite of what they look like he could believe right I wonder how many of you today while the church is doing good you you you can believe but when everything's going wrong can you believe yeah all right are you with me now when life is going good you can believe but what about when everything goes bad yeah can you believe right can you see past the nonsense can you see past the cultish behavior can you see past all the things that all the problems that have been around the message can you see past all of that and see this is God's people can you see past what you've been through can you see past the heartache can you see past the fear and can you say I know this is where I belong yes the faith in Moses caused him to make different choices than Pharaoh even when faced with the same set of circumstances yeah brother BR said Pharaoh with no faith seen God's children as Fanatics no faith he made them Slavs because he wasn't scared of what he said listen somebody will just say anything about the message Wonder somebody just run people down I wonder on look God help us today he saw the people of God as Fanatics because he had no faith he wasn't scared to say something about it he thought he was a God he wasn't afraid of God he thought he was a God he thought his gods that he served that he was a bishop he was the head General overseer his Gods was the one that did it nothing to this thing here so he made them slaves he laughed at them made fun of them just as the people do today the same thing exactly he said Moses fa seen them in the promised land now look Pharaoh had no faith so he could not see the people of God as being God's people I'm so glad that God put a deposit of faith in my heart that I can see past the veil of the flesh I can see past the problems can you see past it this morning I can see past the bondage and I can see this is God's people amen Moses Faith seen him in the promised land a blessed people it might be a hard fight to get them to the promise but Moses chose to go with them right so it's Faith caused repentance Moses to turn and go with them now the same Supernatural made Moses repent Jews the people of God made Pharaoh more stubborn right so brother B talks about Judas he talks about Pharaoh he talks about Esau how they were raised up for a purpose God knowing that they could not repent now we know and I I won't read all these quotes because I'm kind of running short on time we know that Judas was chosen by Jesus but he was not CLE clean you know that you find that in John 13:18 John 1310 through1 Judas was also given to Jesus by the father yeah John 17:12 and brother Bram said the choosing and the giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau though Esau and Pharaoh were both forn they were predestinated to wrath or the end of Moses and Jacob was glorification right so we've stand in a great place today yeah on we get to choose all right sir whether we're seed of God or not I know that's that's a striking statement but if there is seed there there's a deposit of Faith to make that choice right does that make sense and so oh my so if you want to be saved I want I want you to hear this this morning if you want to be saved you can be saved right if there's a desire in your heart to cry out to God you can be saved yes now see God always warns somebody before judging them do you know that he always does he always does he he he never judges a man without warning him first but they man preach an entire sermon on that now look when Cain come it's a great example Eve got a man from the Lord right that's what she said that's why so many people stumble so well she how can he be serpent seed if he came from the Lord but brother bam explained that all babies are from the Lord yeah right all life is from the Lord yeah right so Eve got a man from the Lord but his choice showed there was no seed of Faith there because he was the seed of the serpent right right and God even tells him when he when he's all upset about it and he tells him if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so whether or not you're able to overcome that bitterness whether or not you're able to overcome that bondage whether or not you're able to overcome is all going to be dictated by choices you make and yet God put in you the deposit of Faith to make the right choice yeah so I want to encourage you this morning not to be a an unbeliever but to be a believer don't don't say well I just God made me this way I just can't do it I can't live it no you believe God oh yes and if you do well you'll be accepted that's good now another great example is is the country we live in America America had a chance to repent brother Brandon said he called him back off the mission field called Billy Grant back called Oral Roberts back and they they they crossed the country preaching repentance in 1956 they come preaching repentance but America turned it down God knew they would turn it down they were already written in the scripture to be that that that Beast that second beast that would rise up it's already there right start squeaking here in a minute it's already there oh my but yet they had a choice yeah oh God if I could just make you understand this morning you got a choice choose god listen America would not repent and so now their end is destruction brother BR said Ahab never repented at the rebuke of Elijah if Ahab would have repented walked softly before God the thing would never happen but David Ahab came down took ne's Vineyard had him murdered and all those evil things and I want to warn you here something else a Ahab did repent if you go read it for a while yeah but he didn't truly repent because he didn't completely change who he was right does that make sense he he he he he come back to church and we can say it that way walk softly before the Lord for a while but that's why Paul said judge nothing before the time we got to watch what our what the end result is for everybody that's me and you both now look Jezebel that Prophet walked out there he said with thus sayith the Lord but what did they do she only threatened to kill him what happened is prophecy was fulfilled the dogs eater looked ahab's blood just exactly according to his word he saw the cup full listen there the cup can get full yeah oh I tell you if I wasn't the elect of God I sure wouldn't want my cup to be full I'd want to do something good for those that are are you with me now but their cup can get full and God is patient with them look at the mercy of God he's patient with them until the cup is full that's why we're still here he's patient with them because the cup the cup has to get full but finally God saw that ahab's cup was full yeah Oh my he said Herod never repented when John said it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife he never repented what did he do his wife re required the head of the Prophet listen you might have been caught up in the same thing Herod was caught up in but you repented why could you repent yes come on God help us today I don't give give you courage today not to look back at your past say well I did it no but to go forward and say but look what happened in my life I was not a Herod I was not in Jezebel I was not in Ahab I followed Christ sir good he said if no repentance oh God now look he said his wife required the head of the prophets he sure he didn't repent when he was rebuked to the Lord John told him no matter what he was a procurator whatever he was Emperor whoever he might be he must repent when God called areass upon him if no repentance and judgment is sure to come Hezekiah repented Nineveh repented Nineveh was not God's chosen people yeah right but they repented and they got another chance they ended up going back but they still got another chance look he said Ahab never repent Nebuchadnezzar never repent the people know it's time never repented judgment swept right on in he said now but he first warns everybody everybody gets a warning he said now seeing the time is at hand but everyone that feels that there is a warning how many know there's a warning this morning repent quickly before the wrath of God strikes you said now let's bring it down to the brandom Tabernacle see we have seen these things and know them to be the truth we know that it's absolutely the truth he said the commission of the word is if you will repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises your children and them that's so far off you say well so many don't receive the Holy Ghost when they're baptized it's because they didn't do the first thing first repent yeah that's right and brother Brandon said if they're taught right he says that in one place he said we taught our people that that if they receive if they repented and he said and turned away from their sin and then were baptized that they would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost when they come up out of the water yeah why God promised to give it to you he said he want he want you to have it more than you want it you got to repent first right now look repent and believe brother brandom talks about brother da in the first part he does this in the the first part of Christ is the mystery of God revealed we've been studying on Wednesday night we started on Wednesday night studying that sermon and he he talks to brother da and and this is another place he mentions it he gives brother da a spiritual checkup I me want to have a spiritual checkup this morning he gives me the da a spiritual checkup and he says he says this he said the same God that the and the same prophets that predicted the word of God or the Wrath to be poured out also told of these coming blessings he said I'm so glad but he he gave brother da a spiritual checkup he told him he said now if you went to the heart doctor he said he' look at his book His science book he said and tell you whether or not what you're experiencing what's happened in your life is heart disease he said so I'm going to tell you what the book says about what's happened in your life and he said you believed on Jesus Christ you were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you received the gift of the Holy Ghost he said the doctor says you're going to heaven yeah right that's that's your condition oh my that's what you have that's your spiritual checkup yeah right but now he goes on he says God never does give a nation a destruction without warning it he never gives a man a destruction without warning it now if he does that we've got something that's happened to us the Vindication of the signs of the last days with us the great Holy Spirit moving Among Us charging the church with his presence vindicating his word he said then the church is getting ready for a climb into the skies one of these days by the power of God because it's a warning to lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might fly with patience I love that he says Paul says run with patience brother Brown said fly with patience this race oh my you're an eagle today you can fly with patience just race it oh my that's set before us to the author and finisher of our faith he said God bless you Church hold to God's unchanging hand he said if you feel his presence go to him or if I can just just make it that clear to you young people if I can make it that clear to all of us when we feel his presence go to him go to him if there's anything wrong in your heart make it right we ain't got much time left to coming of the Lord that hand this is the hour of repentance the Bible says there were times when of ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent yes how do we repent as we come now we're going to go back to Psalms 51 well that was kind of a foundation for just the next few minutes how do we repent first of all we acknowledge the nature of our sin and our sinful nature yeah now let me repeat that so you get it we acknowledge the nature of our sin and we also acknowledge our sinful nature look at Psalm 51:4 David says against thee the only have I sinned done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest be clear when thou judgest in other words David says I'm not going to make any excuses it's me I'm the guy oh how different the results would be in our life if we'd approach repentance like this yes yes I'm not qu qualifying it I'm not going to make any excuses oh my I want you to be clear God this is me so that's the nature of my sin and I want to be clear Lord that I understand verse five behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me this is not an excuse it's an acknowledgment yeah this is who I am and I need to be changed right I must be changed all right to live right to be a Christian yes David did not have the benefit that we have of the literal Life of Christ being able to come back on the believer he could only have him in a certain way in a measure but you and I can have the fullness of it aren't you glad for that and he said if you do these things you'll never fall amen oh what a promise that is but look here he said against the and the only I was shapen an iniquity inced my mother conceived me behold thou desirest truth in the inward Parts yeah in other words God you want me to be honest with myself yeah so whatever I'm doing I'm not going to try to excuse it I'm not going to try to qualify it I'm not going to try to say well this no you know I don't drink much yeah I don't smoke very often I don't do drugs but every now and then I I don't I don't lie all the time right sometimes I feel the presence of God that can be such a deceptive thing yeah because you realize you feel God in your outer realm right right you don't feel God from the inside you feel him in the outer realm yeah and we love to feel God but you can be backslid as all get out and still feel God right but you won't respond in the same way as if you were right look what he says you want truth you want me to be honest with myself that this isn't good yeah what I'm doing is not working I need help yes I've talked to people and tried to tell them the worst thing you can do is just try to try to defend yourself yeah yeah no just Lord I need help am I need I need a partner I need people I need I need to talk to somebody I I need I need help look he said you desire truth and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom I'm so glad he said he said you'll you'll make me understand the depth of my sin but you're also going to make me understand that I can be for for given that I can be clean that I can oh God I can come back I'm not stuck where I was come on good he says be honest with yourself and also acknowledge his ability to cleanse you so I think part of the reason that we're not always completely honest with ourselves is that we're afraid that maybe if we were really honest with God that he would somehow be unable to forgive us and it's a lie from hell all right there is no sin that cannot be forgiven right brother brandom talks about lady mcabe he talks about that woman who' done so many bad things and he said all the religions got together and they told about lady mcabe and how awful that she was all the blood she had on her hands and a man stood up and he said can any of your religion cleansed the hands of Lady makabe of her sins and they all sat in silence and he clapped his hands together and he said but the blood of Jesus Christ not only cleansed her hands it'll cleanse their heart all right she might have been the worst woman that ever was but God came for that kind of a person he might have been the worst man that ever was but God came for that kind of person but he wants you to recognize yourself want you to be honest he desires truth in the inward Parts yes knowledge he can do it Psalm 517 David this this is worship man you talk about worship this is worship Purge me with his come on Gooden and I'll be clean yes sir I'm not going to live a defeated life David said I know I'm not happy I was I know what it's like to be happy in the presence of God I know what it's like to have the joy of my salvation and I'm not going to be content until I know it again what he say Let me let me know it Purge me and I know I'll be clean that takes Faith yeah that's the that's the second part of it you got to repent but you got to believe if you don't believe you'll never repent fully because you don't believe he can take it but if you if you know he can handle it you'll give it to him amen Purge me and I will be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow I know what I did you desired truth in the inward Parts I know how bad I was but if you'll Wash Me Lord I wonder how many of us can say that this morning I know what I've been I know what my sinful nature is every one of us can say that as I said about my grandpa I couldn't understand why was he reading this something in him told him he was a sinner that needed a savior Wash Me Lord from my iniquity I know if you wash me I'll be clean if you purge me I'll be whiter than snow make me to hear Joy that's good he said Lord I've gotten in such a condition that I've become deaf to happiness y can hear Joy No matter how happy a situation might be how beautiful it is I can't hear Joy because of my sin and my Brokenness but I know you can make me here Joy yes you can wash me until the spiritual deafness is gone you can wash me until I can worship in church again you can wash me until I know that your presence is with me you can wash me whiter than snow make me to hear Joy yeah and gladness yes that the bones which thou Hast broken which thou Hast broken May Rejoice God had to break some bones in David's life to get him to this place he had CA some there were some terrible scars like the wandering sheep that wanders off the off away from the herd and the and the shepherd has to go with it and break the leg of the sheep yeah but he said the same oh God the same leg that you broke you can restore the oh God the same God that made me convicted the same God that pricked my heart can make me dance in the house of God again can make me shout God I wonder if we realize that this morning I wonder if we really understand the same God that broke my bones can bring them back together again the same God that brought brought brought brought correction to my life can also make me rejoice in the house of God again the same thing when I when I got to where I couldn't what were the people think but now I can Rejoice why because I realize my scars are only proof of healing my scars are only proof God's done something in my life Hallelujah I know I know people today it's a terrible thing you kids they mark their bodies it's a terrible thing have a tattoo on your body but I'll say this those of you have been out there and you've done that we know the scripture speaks against that we don't Mark our bodies it's pagan ISM but if you do it you come back said I can't undo it what am I supposed to do I'll say this it's proof that tattoos can't keep you out of the house of God it's oh God it's proof that Darkness cannot overtake light it's oh God it's proof that sin cannot stand wants it's washing to bleach of the blood of God I don't know how you're sitting there this morning not because I'm preaching but because the word is so clear wash me and I'll be whiter than snow I know your nature oh God I know who you are I know I can be washed hide thy face from my sins blot out all my iniquity now he comes down to the real the real Crux of it the real the real Dynamo that's going to change him creating me yes sir a clean heart remember this happens before the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have to have a new heart and a new spirit mother Brandon taught us that he said because you're with your old Spirit you couldn't even get along with yourself this where so many people miss it they've apologized for their sin but their attitude never changed right I'm not preaching to any one of you I'm preaching to myself to these kids to all of us see when we repent when we repent our attitude's got to change our attitude towards God's people our attitude towards the house of God our attitude towards our spouse it's got to change yeah or it's not real repentance right and so David said I want more than just forgiveness right sir create in me a clean heart all right I want my inward being my Reigns my we talked about the I want from the from my inward man I want it to be new I realized that what I don't want to just be forgiven of what I did but Lord take away what made me do what I did create in me a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit within me the the arrogance that made me do what I did take it away Lord the ungodliness that caused me to do it take take it away oh God create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit within me how many of you can pray that this morning you young people you can pray that Lord created me a clean heart yes I want to be clean I want to have a right Spirit if I keep my same Spirit my Same Heart my same desire I'll go do it again yeah create in me a clean heart yes renew a right Spirit within me and then fill me with your Holy Spirit cast me not away yes from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me now watch what he did he began to recognize Lord if you're able to forgive me if you're able to cleanse me change my attitude change my thoughts about life you're able to restore me into your presence restore to me the joy thy salvation David wanted the right thing he did just want his kingdom back oh God he wanted the joy of his salvation uphold me with thy free spirit my spirit's bound because of what I did but Lord I'm believing if you forgave me and you've and you've created in me a clean heart you can also restore uphold me with your free spirit then will I teach transgressors thy ways in other words my life will become a testimony of what God can do aren't you glad Jonathan your life can be a testimony of what God could do in a young man your life can be a testimony what God could do in a in a in a message person you kids your life could be a testimony that God can keep you in the house of God your life can be a testimony the grace of almighty God when I have repented let me teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee you can restore me so far back that I my life will be a testimony and people will come to Christ not not people will be driven away because of what I did but people will actually come because of my restoration and then he said I'm going to worship you God sorry I'm held you a little bit long this morning but can we just do this this morning with David can can we worship this with David as I imagine maybe my grandfather in all the limited knowledge that he had of the scripture but I remember his face lighting up in the house of God and he may have been a difficult man he might have had a lot of things going on in his life but he read the scripture he said Lord I Want To Worship You I want to go to the house of God I want to raise my hands again I want to praise you I want to feel what it's like to be in your presence I may have a I may be I may have a hard life I may have had a broken past but Lord he said deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God thou God of my salvation and my tongue shall sing where shall sing out loud my tongue will sing out loud out loud of thy righteousness oh Lord open thou my lips right we can get so caught up in what we've done and how we failed God that our lips gets closed that's David prays oh Lord open my lips open my lips my mouth shall show forth th praise I'm not going to sit and let everybody else do it my mouth yeah shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering but the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise let me be broken Lord in my spirit so I can worship again don't let me get hard don't let me be Harden that's the difference in pharaoh and Moses that's the difference in Esau and Jacob God Jacob was broken and he was broken so he could be remade when Esau got broken he tried to put the pieces back together but he never could yeah I say God help us to be Jacob today I believe we are I believe that you are let me be broke so I can worship again then he prays this way in verse 18 he he begins to pray for Revival in the church yeah every one of us needs that yes right how can the person who did the sin pray for Revival in the church because of the Resto restoring amen forgiving power of God even under the law David said do good in thy good pleasure to Zion build thou the walls of Jerusalem he said I want you Lord I want you to do something good for the people of God then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer Bullocks upon that altar then your services will begin to go different I want our services to be right I don't want to be the stick in the mud I don't want to be somebody with a bad attitude that cause the church to to fall back and Revival to begin to be quelled but let me be one who brings Revival no matter what's been in my past no matter what's happened can we say Amen to that today can we stand for that today let's stand together let's just lift our hands to him and and be like David I I believe you've repented of your your sins if you've repented of your sins let's believe God he can wash me from my sins he can change me let's believe him this morning Lord I'm going to worship you let my mouth open

down at his feet and said forgive me of your my sins Lord now look look brother BR said they see the scripture exactly identified but they're not conscience of who it is they'll see something see the flucky was not conscious of who it was he said oh that was wonderful that was fine but you're not conscious of what it is if it was there would be a repentance going on weeping and crying the city
