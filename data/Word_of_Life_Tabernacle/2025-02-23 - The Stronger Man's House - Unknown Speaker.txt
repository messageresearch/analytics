bless you amen I'm going to read from Luke 11: 21 and 22 this morning good to have all of us here this today there's uh I think it's it's pretty rare that we get most of us in church I know the birie family I think he's working today and and but Jeremy's working and different ones but it's still good to see the majority of the church out on a Sunday morning and it's been the weather's been so bad that uh it just seems like uh uh it it be hard to have church and then the Lord just made give us a beautiful day today to have church and we're thankful to be here today I'll if we have any visitors but Lucas I see you back there you're not really a visitor but God bless you I'm sure sister Ashley's here somewhere so taking care of one of those 11 children so it's good to have you with us it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it yes amen Luke 11:21 says when a strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning I want to speak to you this morning on the stronger man's house the stronger man's house when Jesus came the first time he uh came to a world where the established religions had become very denominational in their thinking very organized they had not had uh any Supernatural among them for many many years in fact it had been 400 years since they'd had a prophet and so they were very uh organized the way they thought about the Lord was very it was very much had to do with intellect and very little to do with the supernatural power of God and so when he came to that country place where they were uh they didn't even think think about God anymore uh so much as a miracle working God yeah he did things in the past but those days were long gone it it was many many years many decades many even centuries ago that God had done those things and so when things began to happen in Jesus Ministry they realized there was something going on and and and they interpreted it in different ways they had to account for it and so the people there some thought he was crazy in fact Jesus own family thought he was crazy now for all of you who maybe your family thinks you're crazy today and why do you believe the message why do you believe in miracles why do you believe that God still raises the dead and heals the sick and and does the things for us why do you believe that today well and they may think you're crazy they may say well you've gone off your rocker you're beside yourself well they thought the same thing of him in Mark 3:21 it says when his friends heard of it and that word friends is actually his family or those on his side of the family heard of it they went out to lay hold on him they actually went to Stage an intervention on Jesus right they they start talking about it around the dinner table you know you know Jesus has been doing some strange things he left the carpentry shop at 30 years old and he began to he began to preach and he began to teach and and and and people my goodness them people get wild down there there a bunch of holy rollers and and there saying things about people getting healed and people getting saved and and things happen and people getting baptized he's gone crazy just like his cousin you know old John the Baptist said we got to do something about it and so they actually go down to lay hold on him right they're going to physically try to take him and put him in an institution somewhere whatever the the the equivalent of that was at the time because they did not understand the supernatural they said he's crazy they still think that today any Christian is going to be seen as crazy by the world any real believer is going to be told that they're crazy by the world but I don't care what the world thinks today but I care what he thinks so they still think it's crazy they thought Paul was crazy they said Paul you're beside yourself in Acts 26 it said much learning has made you insane it thought brother Brandon was beside himself in uh brother brand says this about his own family he said I remember the time when the angel of the Lord came and told me go pray for sick people and a great friend of mine the denomination I belonged to said Billy you're going to be a Holy Roller as sure as the world and my mother said now listen it's not always going to be easy when it comes to family it's not always going to be easy to get them to understand I'm a Believer now mama I don't cut my hair no more I don't wear those pants no more I don't wear that makeup no more and it's hard to get them to understand why you don't do those things and why it's going well they'll think you're crazy but they thought he was crazy and and he said my mother said why Billy you've lost your mind my poor old dad that died on my arm said Billy you can't bring that stuff around this house here they thought I was crazy oh my I'm glad he didn't give into to that thought he said I was a single man he said my girlfriends that I've been going with they thought I was crazy but I knew something happened yeah I knew that I could trust him amen you know you can trust him today he said no matter what taking place I believed him and you have to believe him listen when you follow Christ you'll be called crazy what we have is the mind of Christ listen to me this morning if crazy is love and joy and peace and gentleness and and kindness and Assurance I'll take that over all the chemically induced things folks have today I'll take crazy over that whatever they got I don't want I don't want what the world's got where they have to medicate themselves with alcohol and everything else to have you and have a peace of mind but I want to see I want God to move I want to be in the presence of God they can call it crazy all they want to I know there's churches in the message that don't believe in a move of the Holy Ghost anymore but I I'd rather be there let my mind be soothed by that than by things of the world you know people tell you say well you don't need emotion anymore and that's true you don't need emotion at all you should just take God's word for it but we're human beings right we're human beings and and when you care about something it shows right when when something happens to you and you get a revelation of what God's done for you it'll show on your face it'll show as we preach about Judah with the lifting up of your hands and and the Cry of your voice it'll show somewhere you care about what you're saying it's going to come out in a passion in your voice in your heart right oh my yeah we don't need emotions that's not what we base our religion on WE base it on the word you're healed not because you feel like it but because God said so you're saved not because you feel like it but because God said so but I'd rather be called crazy and enjoy my religion than have to put up with whatever they put up with all right yes good now in Mark 3 the devil work on you man you'll either you'll either enjoy Christ or the devil will come in and try to get you to enjoy something else you're going to enjoy something you're going to find peace somewhere you're going to find somewhere to make to cause a care you know brother man preaches he carth for you he said you're going to find somebody to care but he's the one that really cares rather take him anything else in Mark chap 3 and: 22 that's just a background for where we want to go so they're saying that these things maybe he's crazy and so the scribes and the Pharisees they realize well he's not insane but maybe it's a devil right that's how they try to explain it and the scribes in Mark 3:22 which came down from Jerusalem said he hath be elub and by the prince of the Devils casteth he out devils and he called them unto him and said unto them in Parables how can Satan cast out Satan and if a kingdom be divided against itself that Kingdom cannot stand and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand there a great lesson here I don't have time to go into this morning but of a church if a church is divided against itself and can't stand right if a family is divided against itself it can't stand you got to be on the same page and if Satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end yeah I like that hath an end now he then presents Satan as a powerful man you'll find this in Matthew and Mark and in Luke he presents Satan as a powerful man in his home or or in his Palace and so if we had a a strong man one one of you kids which one of you is strong you young man strong real strong I got some raising their hands but they're doing it like is you know real strong I got strong men up here uh Wyatt you make come here he pointing to somebody else Jason come here [Music] I don't know buddy you're a preacher's kid all right uh this is a strong man are you a strong man very doubtful very doubtful he says I got one that don't cooperate right here so this is a strong man right he's a strong man and to some of these other boys maybe to Wyatt I don't know I think Whitey beats up on him but he he's a strong man some of these girls name m boy here's a strong man with muscle as you know he's a strong man where's trip at are you in the back trip come on buddy I need you this is a strong man right but he he's he's not he he's able to as long as the as long as his opponents are of equivalent size right I'm trying to make it where you'll understand it church where you it'll stick with you as long as his opponent is of equivalent size he will actually uh be able to keep the things in his house so he's he's armed himself he has he has he's protecting his Goods trip where did you go he's able to to do that and uh he he's able to keep his house he's able to protect what's his right so so you're the strong man now be strong there you go it's a strong man but when Jesus come on the scene what happened was a stronger man came right so if Jason is trying to keep what's his and trip wants it right now I don't know if you got anything he wants but you better be careful but if trip wants it he can take it that makes s now that's no but he's just a stronger man right he's another he's on another level that's right he's in another class now do you understand when Jesus come along it was like this man was there and he he was enjoying himself he could take whatever control he could put in disease he wanted to on the people he could fill their minds with hate and and fear and everything else it was a strong man that had control of the world but a stronger man come along and when the stronger man came in he said that's how the Devils were cast out thank you guys give him a hand oh my can you imagine you imagine him trying the strong man can't keep his Goods anymore and many times we give too much credit to the devil cuz what happened in the strong man yeah he's strong yeah he can do many things and cause great fears and anxieties and things but the stronger man has come down and come into our age and he's standing there casting out the strong man because he's the stronger man are you with me now so now where is how Satan had the house yeah he had control of the house he had control of my house and your house we were all born in sin shapen in iniquity com to the world speaking lies the strong man and he armed himself with with hate and fear and hypocrisy and drugs and alcohol and he armed himself on right he armed himself with evil thoughts and everything else that was the he was the strong man yeah but he said the stronger man come along one day what happened to you listen to me Church you don't have to be bound you don't have to live your life under a curse you don't have to live your life under depression you don't have to live under fear you don't have to live under a pornography devil you don't have to live under that thing you say well I can't just overcome it yes you can it's not you but it's the stronger man has come by what happened to you what happened to all of us that have lived for a while the stronger man came in the stronger man came in we were just like everybody else Bound by all the things that LE to is bound by I know some of you drank and smoked and and and and and carried on with women and everything else but yet you the stronger man come by one day and when he come by everything changed oh Hallelujah don't don't make excuses for it let the stronger man come by he say well if I could just feel him coming by yeah I believe that's that's possible but who is the strong man he was the word the strong man was the word in flesh yeah that come by your way when the word came all the other things have to leave amen said well I can never be different I can never cast out these things these thoughts these tormenting thoughts this depression this trouble let the stronger man come by you were the strong man's house but when the stronger one stronger than he comes he binds the strong man and spoils his Goods Hallelujah he spoiled cigarettes he spoiled alcohol he spoiled all of that made a show of it openly the Bible says and comes back the mighty conqueror yes aren't you glad he's still the strong stronger man today oh my now look he says he'll he'll bind the strong man and spoil his house again the strong man has possession he's armed he will not cast himself out right because the house divided against itself would not fall would fall but he he he's entrenched in there we know that demons do make war and fight but they don't cast one another out they simply wreak havoc in the Earthly realm right they actually that demon is still there that American demon fights with the British demon and the German demon and brandom explained that how that he was over all the kingdoms of the world and they fight with one another right they can't even get along with themselves but yet they cannot cast each other out out only God can do that because they're they're not the stronger man Hallelujah there's only one and church we can look at Psychology you can you say well I need to do this I need to go get counseling I need to do this and that I'm not against that but what wait and see if maybe the stronger man could come by maybe he could cast out the the strong man because there's no one greater than Jesus there's no one bigger than he is if he's cast out when so when you see Devils begin to be cast out you know the stronger man has come by so that's what Jesus said happen he said it was the strong man had his house but when the stronger one came by the reason the devils are cast out is because the stronger Man cast him out and that house became the house of the stronger man now in Luke 11: 18 he said if Satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because you say that I cast out Devils to beel above but if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you now brother Brandon points that out to us he said he cast out Devils with his finger but when he goes after his sheep listen to me he doesn't use his finger see a devil's a little thing to God yeah he can cast out demons with his finger but he but when he comes after his lost sheep he doesn't use his finger but he puts the Sheep across the strongest part of his body oh I'm so glad that when he come after me he didn't just use his finger but he used the strongest part of his body and he come and he bore me into his house he was a stronger man and he's not but he didn't just trust in his finger to deliver you but he came and he bore you across his shoulders B said see how he loves you so now now look what was happening you know what the major difference in the Pharisees and the Sadducees was the Pharisees believed in a resurrection and the Sadducees didn't believe there was a resurrection and while they were debating about it Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead come on Church what was it all their weapon was was argument but Jesus come by he was the stronger man the stronger man come by and there they had argument but he had reality he settled the question when Lazarus come out of the Grave how could you not believe in a resurrection when there's a dead man walking oh come on Church what is the evidence today that the stronger man is here it's because you and I have been raised from dead trespasses and sin and we're walking with him every day oh that ought to make us excited church that ought to turn us give us a little joy in our heart because we know that the stronger man has come by oh my Hallelujah well they were debating whether or not days of Miracles were passed a strong man come by stronger one and prove God's word was true see Paul tells us he said you being dead in your sins in Colossians 2:13 and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all someone say all all trespasses oh I'm so glad he forgives all your trespasses blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross I think I've told you before but the way that they canceled a mortgage in that day and age was to actually take the original mortgage and use a blotter and blot it out where you couldn't even read what church you couldn't even read what the terms were anymore you couldn't even read what the amount was anymore they blotted it out and he said he blotted out the law that was against us on Hallelujah blotted out that thou shallal not kill now show not and because we had done that we killed and we lied and we committed adultery all of those things but he blotted that out he blotted out what was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross yes and listen what he did the stronger man came by and having spoiled principalities yeah that means the spoiling back then they we don't understand what that is but used to an army when they went into a country they didn't just go in they had Wars they make up reasons for Wars because they wanted the spoil they were going in for the spoil so they would go in and take everything that belonged to that soldier that came because when you come to fight a war you got to bring stuff with you so they would actually fight the war to gain the spoil and Jesus Hallelujah fought the War took the devil's own stuff took it away from him took the keys of death in Hell Hallelujah he said he made a show of them openly when the Roman emperors would defeat a country when they when Titus defeated Jerusalem he sacked Jerusalem burn it to the ground and and there wasn't even a town there anymore just a Roman encampment would have been a city of thousands and thousands of people and he sailed back to Rome and there's an arch there called I believe it's titus's Arch and it has a it has a a relief you know drawn on it like a a sculpture on it and it shows the the the procession of how that they come back bearing the things oh my the things that they had stolen and taken out of the temple and famously on it there's a manora cuz they took that out of the temple and what were they doing they were saying we're stronger right they're saying our gods are stronger than their gods they're saying our nation is stronger than their Nation what did Christ do when he come back Paul says he spoiled principalities and powers and he had a Triumph when he come back he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it he didn't just he didn't just defeat the Devil he humiliated the devil took the teeth out of him made him where he couldn't even get took away the keys to his own house made him where he had no power and then you give in to him come on church say well we just got we just can't do it cuz the devil you know the devil so we got to just really be careful cuz we might be deceived come on Church he's a devil we got to understand who is yeah he has power but the stronger one has come by yes the the maniac of gadera think of him he was possessed by a legion of demons and everybody everywhere he' come against something he was the stronger man right they tried to bind him with chains but he was the stronger man they they tried to they tried to keep him in a house but he was the stronger man because he was possessed by Legions of devils brother brand we we talked about that here recently brother BR said that was some devils them Devils of hatred come on him he said they multiplied he said that devil of hatred is the same devil that come out of Legion that devil of temper when you lose your temper he said it's the same they lose it it's the same devil that come out of Legion he said but the one that was in Legion he said just it was multiplied there were just many of them made him so strong strong strong that he could break chains oh my but one day a little man who didn't look very strong sir who looked weak who looked like he couldn't oh come on church he looked like he wasn't much in the flesh but the BR said didn't look like a leader he wasn't very tall he didn't look very imposing didn't look like a military man but he had great Authority one day when he crossed over to the other side of the sea and Legion stood before for him Legion had never faced a stronger man but on this day that demon had to ask for permission of where to go when he cast him out listen he didn't have to jump and holler and and scream and and pray all night or nothing else to get Legion to come out all he had to say was come out of him come on Church why he was the stronger [Applause] man right Hallelujah he made a show of it Jesus is stronger than a legion of demons right stronger stronger than the the Bible says that you know Legion was mentally disabled or at least he had mental issues we would call a mental sickness because the Bible says when he come to himself so when Jesus cast him out he he was in clothed and in his right mind proving that before he had not been in his right mind but Jesus is stronger amen huh come on now come on church right I know we deal with these things it's The Age of Anxiety it's the age of mental depression is the age when uh we we're told we name these things and we're told that these things have a place in our lives but I'm here to I'm still preaching the gospel today we're not preaching self-help and we're not preaching a a 12-step program I'm still preaching to you the gospel that there's a stronger man that can come by and when the word comes by your direction he can speak to that devil and cast him out that's not to minimize what's going on I know the devil is strong he's armed yeah he he's strong man but the stronger man is here good good yes come on Hallelujah the anointed word is stronger than whatever Affliction you have which is caused by demonic power and and you say well what is a demon a demon is a fallen angel the the the King James version calls him a devil but if you go back into Greek it's demon which is demon demon a a demon is not the devil the devil is Satan but a demon is one of the angels that fell with the Devils also King James also calls him an evil spirit in Jude chapter 6 it says the a or Jude verse 6 the Angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in Everlasting chains you say well I wish he'd come by and bind this demon that's working he already has right yes Hallelujah he hath reserved that devil that bothers you that that devil of sickness that devil of cancer he hath Reser do we believe the word or not he hath reserved yes that devil in Everlasting chains under Darkness right unto the Judgment of the great day he's already got a slot you know how they give time slots if you've ever been involved in court I was just not because I was in court for myself but because I worked for an attorney and we always there's time slots for court you know and you're supposed to show up and maybe they'll say at months ahead and you got to remember you got to be there at 3:00 in the afternoon and make an appearance in court at a certain day and a certain time he's already reserved come on church that Old Devil that's been bugging you that that that old arthritis that's comes on you and that Old Demon of sickness that tries to oppress you you remember he's already been reserved for a place at the Judgment seat of God hallelujah you already got a time slot you tell your time's coming you got a little you got a little space a little season you can torment me now but your time's coming you're on the docket sir for Destruction Hallelujah these are the one-third of angels that fell with Lucifer if you go to Roman or Revelation 12 and I don't have time to to take it today but talked about the dragon how he drew a third part of the stars out of the heavens with him and Jesus actually when he came now the stronger man came but he didn't Reserve his strength for himself because a real strong man he lives for others he he gives to others and it's so in Luke chapter 10 even before the coming of the Holy Ghost we find that the 70 had the power Jesus had delegated to them the power to to overcome demons to overcome Devils it says the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name that's that the demons are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them he said I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you now we believe the word or we don't when are we going to take it seriously are you with B now you might even bring me down but you're not going to hurt me yeah yeah it might be painful but it's not going to hurt me right it can only be used as a tool by god listen to me when we go through things when we maybe get sick or something happens maybe our finances aren't exactly what we want them to be and we're thinking how what what's going on in my life remember it's for a purpose a reason there's a season that you're going through as brother George preach the other weekend there's something that you're going through that only lasts for a little while remember it's a season and God had to allow it because those devils are bound right reserved to judgment yes he's already been defeated yeah and he said I give you power that nothing someone say nothing this morning shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice Hallelujah because your names are written in heaven right oh he said that's the reason that you ought to Rejoice not because that you've overcome all these things but you have that power to overcome but yet he said Rejoice that your names are written in heaven what was it he was the stronger one what do they say they said we are even devils are subject unto us through thy name see the name because he's the stronger one in Revelation 12 and: 7 the Bible tells us that there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon the dragon fought and his angels prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan was deceiveth the whole world he was cast down to the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused him before our God day and night see he's been dethroned yesen right he's dethroned the difference in you now and you before is not that the devil can't bother you but he's been dethroned that dethronement has to take place in your life right that's that's that's got to there's got to be an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that takes him off the throne and put someone else on the throne young people listen to me it's not enough just to go to a message church it's not just enough just say I believe but you got to have an experience with God that you know that there someone else came and is living in your heart so it's not enough just to say I believe in a message or a prophet or anything else you got to have a dethronement of Satan and an enthronement of Christ in your heart and brother brand you say well how can I tell if that happen brother brandom tells us by your desire you can tell who's on the throne of your heart right by your desire you can tell what do you want many times we we find ourselves caught in bad situations but what is your the desire of your heart what do you really want oh I want to be in his presence I want to live for him I want to be clean and holy and live a Godly life then what is it there's the power to do that then you can tell he's on the throne now so the first battle was the battle between Michael and Lucifer brother BR said then was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was to destroy then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since now we know where that Battleground is the Battleground is the mind right I was chosen for the Battleground so what is the fight the battle of the Mind what's going on in your mind it's for possession yeah of a house right right it's the battle for possession of your house it's going on right now right now in your mind the devil you think he gives up when you receive the Holy Ghost no he's got access to your mind when you receive the Holy Ghost the devil don't just give up right right but but he has he has access to your mind so he's trying to get you to not pay attention yeah right the devil's trying to do that right the devil's trying to get it where you you know and maybe it's something that going on in your family or going on at home or going on in your work you sit in church and it get you a little hot uncomfortable and your mind starts to wonder yeah why because God's about to tell you something you need to know not cuz I'm saying it but because that's what he does for his children right and the battle's going on in the mind the devil's trying to take that thought away from you because he knows that the word is stronger than him so the only way he can overcome you is if you allow the word to to or you you do not allow the word to come in if you if you accept the word and reject Satan the word is always is stronger than the devil but if you're having if you're having a problem you say well I'm unable to overcome it's because you haven't fully accepted the word by Faith from the heart now look it it's not our effort that cast out demons it's the stronger man yeah yeah right Jesus said I do it with the Finger of God yeah right it's not effort I want you if you have a chance this week to go back and watch TL osbor his testimony about brother brandham specifically the one where he talks about how brother brandham dealt with a deaf and dumb spirit and he talks about being there in Portland I'll just give you a little bit of it he talks about brother brandom it's available on YouTube he talks about brother Brandon being in Portland in the great uh or in the early in the late 40s that in brother Brandon's early Ministry that great meeting they had in Portland Oregon and he said in the big this is tal Osburn talking about it he said in the Big City Auditorium it seats 8,000 people he said we sat in the third balcony this gentle little man came out on the platform he said he was like Christ to me he said he spoke very careful he preached tender but firm and when he got through preaching hundreds of people came and accepted Christ and T osbor looks at that and says I want to do that right and then he called for the sick marvelous Miracles took place as we watched and and till urn said he had had a vision of Jesus just before that and he went to that meeting he said I had a second Vision he said I saw Jesus Christ in that man oh that people would see Jesus in US yeah that wasn't limited to brother brandom listen the son of man wasn't only limited to brother brandom the son of man the the the evidence of the of the son of man of the Resurrection was only one man to one generation but the son of man is in the bride revealing himself not as a prophet but as men and women and boys and girls living everyday life but what he said I saw Jesus Christ in that man yeah he said pretty soon there was a girl that was born deaf and dumb and come on the platform and this is his words he said I was a noise making Pentecostal he said we were scared of devils and if we thought someone had a devil we were scared of them and the best we could do was yell at them and gang up on them and the more noise we made the greater possibility maybe they would go now we've all been there get a little bit weak in faith you know say I wish I had a whole gang of it you know there's nothing wrong with ganging up on the devil but what God showed us to a prophet's Ministry is you don't have to do that right you don't have to have 12 preachers around you reminds me of a little story I was at a meeting one time and there was a people that didn't believe in Preachers that showed up at the meeting and and uh they uh they were going to have their vows renewed and their headquarters told them they needed to have a preacher do that which I don't understand that completely but they need to have a preacher do that and so they show up at the meeting and the Pastor said well we'll do it we'll do it this morning you just being gracious I just kidding I said you know you ought to just have every preacher in that place come and and lay hands on them and pray over them and sure enough he did it every preacher in that place there must have been about 15 of us and we all come around you know and gather around you talk about being ganged up on they were as nervous as a longtailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs and get and prayed for them people they didn't believe in Preachers well that you know we ganged up on them but you don't have to gang up on the devil that's right because you and God's a majority you don't even have to yell at him are you with me Church speak to him yes speak to that devil tell him you don't belong here right right you you do not belong in my house you are not strong enough sir to take this house oh I don't care what Devil's bothering you today I'm here to tell you I'm here to tell you to remind you this morning he is not strong enough to take your house he's not strong enough to take your marriage he's not strong enough to take you until it's your time to go in sickness he is not strong enough the stronger man has come by he said the best we could do is yell at them and gang up on them and the more noise we made the greater possibility maybe they would go he said this man pulled this little girl to his side like a father and he spoke so kind to the people please bow your heads while we pray for the child he said this man I'll never forget his prayer just quiet but first he said thou deaf and dumb Spirit leave the child and enter her no more he said I was shocked he said audience you can lift your heads now the evil spirit has left the child and I said how do you know we haven't even made any noise yet he was looking for a moment of Deliverance but brother BR said the evil spirit was left the child because he knew the stronger one had commissioned him to cast out Devils so when he said Satan how many times have you heard him say it Satan I adure you to leave what was he saying he was under Authority that's what Jesus why he was different from all the rest they he come teaching as a one under Authority he said leave and they left he said be healed and they were healed sir are you with me now yes he said I saw Jesus in that man if we see Jesus now was one of his contemporaries teal Osborne never did embrace the message but he understood that there was something there right if we see Jesus casting out Devils with his finger right what do we know we know the kingdom of God is coming to us right we had denominational ages we had Pentecostals all over the place healing meetings and everything else but there come a time when God came down and what did he show us to the ministry of a prophet of a man of a mortal man not a God but he' come down and he showed himself through that man and he said what did we what could we say what could we deduce from that the kingdom of God has come to us we now know that the stronger one you don't read about demons being cast out in the Old Testament did you know that there's not a single example that I can think of of a demon being cast out people are healed and things but it never specifically say the devil's cast out but suddenly Jesus comeing along and he's cast them out left and right why the stronger men come by amen oh my denominations they had church and they had church and they had church but in the in the ministry you realize it was more than the ministry of a man but through the ministry of a prophet God came by and he showed us a stronger man was in the house and he hadn't left so the brother brand talked about the angel can you bear with me just for a few more minutes brother brand talked about the angel of the Lord that come to him and he said that was not Christ himself right he didn't have a beard that's one way he said he was clean shaven and he was of a different height than when he saw Christ in the field remember and he said but the angel that come in was not Christ himself he was an angel but he was a strong Angel the strength was not in William Brandon yeah but a strong Angel stood by his side now he he was sent from the presence of Christ but the say that many times he said I am sent from the presence of Christ the presence of God he said now he talk about the angel coming say I'm just trying to speak of this Angel the Lord I do not worship that angel he said in the first place I'd say this I believe if I'd even made the attempt that the angel himself would correct me for I truly believe he was sent from God see we don't brother brother Bram didn't worship the angel we don't worship brother brown right right but it's something that God was using him he was a messenger yes a strong Messenger right Hallelujah a strong Angel but he what we don't worship him come on now Hallelujah he said he was a man just as I am just as much human looking as I are you and he looks to be a man in his 30s I'd say a strongl looking man folding his hands yeah well go back to Revelation chap 5 and you can go and take anecdotal evidence and say well this was a strong Angel right he come for a purpose he come at a certain time and for a certain purpose to to get give a commission to a prophet to have a Ministry that the strength of that Ministry had not been seen many many years and yet in in Revelation 5:2 there was a a proclamation that went out you you you've heard it many times and the Bible says a strong angel I saw a strong Angel yeah proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy brother brandom tells us in the breach he was advertising for a redeemer who's Worthy is a strong Angel yes sir but even a strong Angel can't open the book it took a mighty Angel The Mighty Angel it was not just an angel but was Christ himself right a strong Angel could not take the book it took a stronger man that's oh Church the lamb had to open the book The Lamb had to die for sin now the angel brought it to brother brandham but the angel is a messenger from who from the lamb are you with me now hope I haven't lost you it took a stronger man yeah and you see it had to be a man because man lost it Adam lost the keys to his house Adam lost a title deed to heavens and earth when he lost it the book was sealed it's just a simp simp as I know how to put it the book was sealed and when it was sealed There's No Redemption listen if you cannot receive Revelation sir from this book There's No Redemption for you right are you hearing me there's got to be re you say well it's I don't understand the complexity it's not complexity you have to understand but you it's got to be revealed to you that Jesus died for your sins he can be revealed to you in that manner even as a child yeah but it's got to be revealed to you right it's not enough just to understand it here but it's got to be open to you yeah and all through the Old Testament they could not have it in their heart they could only have it in their head but he come to to turn the heart of the children back to the fathers he come what did he do through this ministry he opened the seals the lamb opened the seals brother Braham didn't open the seals the lamb did and he gave Hallelujah he gave the book to the opening of the word he gave it to a an angel gave it to a prophet Prophet gave gave it to us yes Hallelujah why because a stronger man yeah had come by and what did he say man had lost it it had to be Redeemed by the stronger man not the strong Angel but the stronger man yeah and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah we just went through this with the with the tribe of Judah teaching on that the root of David hath what prevailed sir he hath prevailed he has overcome to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof when he looked he didn't see a line what did he see he saw a lamb hallelujah hallelujah the devil has strong demons right just like God's Got Strong Angels there's weak demons and strong demons right and and demons gain power from Fear whatever you're afraid of demons can't grow more powerful because you're giving them more room it's just like a battlefield the more room that you have in the battlefield you're trying to take the ground right more room that you have Jaden and chess you're trying to push the other person across right you're trying to build space for yourself and put them on the defensive and the way the demon gains power and puts you on the defensive is fear well if I go to church this will happen yeah if I if I live for God people laugh at me yeah huh if I quit doing this thing I know is wrong to do people say I'm crazy on now it's fear brother BR said those demons of fear come over him you remember him talking about it I don't have the quote with me this morning but he said I would have received Christ at 8 years old he said but them demons come and said wait yeah wait a little longer the people laugh at you people make fun of you they do the same things today right that's right and what do you do you give speci way said don't give place to the devil don't give him room to maneuver right right cuz if you give him room in one area here he'll come around get in another area and get in another area pretty soon you find yourself with all kinds of devils wandering around take care of it when you have a problem that's the time to deal with it when you have a bad thought that's the time to deal with it when Satan tells you nobody loves you deal with it right there and say I know Jesus loves me and that's enough h good you got to stop him as we preached before stop him at the borders the devil has strong demons cause cancer strong demons that cause depression sickness anxiety evil thoughts but God has strong angels too and brother BR said Satan's Army brings diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out the devil arms himself remember the strong man is armed but when the stronger man takes possession he has weapons too he's got armor too brother BR said the greatest battle ever fought she's going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt between Liberty and bondage it's going on right here this morning can we see it church it's going on right here right the strong one is wanting to bring sickness on you and here's the word that says by his stripes I am healed he said the battle is on he said Shine Your spear soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready God anoints his army he talked about America's Army how they dressed their army for success and Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of God is or let me back up but the brand said God dresses his army hallelujah what kind of equipment do we use the spirit of the sword the word of God and we don't separate the word and the spirit right we're we're we are not word only in the sense that we're word only in the sense that we only want the word not anything that's not true right we only want the truth but we're not word only in the sense we don't believe in the power of God we believe in the power of God because if it is the word the god power of God anoints it this you kind of always dwelt over the word if it's the true word the power of God will be there you you can't separate the two and I preached that before you can't separate the lust feel like I'm just repeating myself this morning you can't you can't separate the logos from the word you can't separate the anointing from the word he's the same person when he come on the in flesh he's the same one yeah Hallelujah and the word of God is alive the word of God is Spirit he said my words are Spirit in life the word of God is quick that's alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of ther of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marl and a discerner of the thoughts and T the ARs he armed the church what's armed with his word his Spirit of the word to cast out Devils BR said the word of God to believe his word that's the way God armors yeah that's what he gave Eve to arm him herself with she broke her armor down how'd she do it by opening up her mind to reason he said you don't reason with God's word it has no reason it's just God's word right there's no doubt about it there's no reasonings to it it's God's word that settles it that's got it that settles it forever don't you let no devil come by and tell you you're not saved if you know you come God's provided way you can stand there and say I'm saved yeah I'm saved cuz God said so then don't start acting like it right it's got it settles it forever he said they told Abraham said go back where you come from you might as well just quit going to church you you go back to that old worldly pit that you come from from go back to ER the Cales why don't you go back home he said God gave me the promise amen he said God will give the baby right in the land where he sent me God will heal you right in this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost where he sent you God will give it to you just believe it amen he said open up them flu of the soul and body senses and conscience just let God's words penetrate first take that mind there is the Battleground not say well if I could feel it if I'd feel the glory of God falling oh that has nothing to do with it right not a thing reason you feel the glory of God many times because you've already the battle's already been won in the mind yeah and then the glory of God comes down yeah but the battle in the mind open up that mind that's the Battleground there's where the battle sits in Array right here in the front line your mind open up and say every doubt church can we say it this morning every doubt I doubt my doubts yes good so every time the Devil comes to you brother Paul and says well you this is going to happen or that's going to happen I doubt that I doubt that very much you tell me the bride's going down and they're oh you say Well everybody's it's all falling apart and nobody believes the truth anymore I doubt that come on why because he said he'd have a bride without spot wrinkle wash in the blood of the Lamb you think people don't get saved anymore I doubt that why because his word is true he's the same yesterday today and forever he says you can't be rid of that Spirit that's holding on to you for so long I doubt that because his word said we can be free and live happy before the father yes sir sir I doubt that Satan is right I doubt that he's telling you the truth he said nobody loves you I doubt that right good he he tries to tell you that things are only going to get worse I doubt that not for you you're going up going down your family's never going to be saved I doubt that God gave me my family something's going to take place and I'm doubting my doubts now believing God's words here I come Satan something's going to take place sure it will he said he anoints his servants with his Spirit he sends them angels angels are messengers now we don't understand what we're doing when we hear the preaching of the word when brother Joel comes by Brother Joel's going to preach tonight brother Andrew comes by or brother Stuart preaches or anybody that we have here at the church comes and preaches what happens when they come God uses him in a unique way but it's more than just a man preaching brother brandom taught us it was ministering spirits that anoint the man to say words that's what he said he said are they he he reads Hebrews 1:14 he said they say there's not Angels anymore read Hebrews 1:14 are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be hirs for salvation he said now here the Bible comes right back and tells us that God sends forth Angels Glory what are they ministering Spirits ministering Spirits sent where from the presence of God what to do Minister his word right they're not to minister some theology or some denominational group but to minister his word ministering Spirit sent forth how do we know they are listen we don't know about how loud they are right or how quiet they are right the Bible said the word of the Lord came to the prophets yes is that right these angels Minister his word through his Spirit Minister the word through the Holy Spirit and the spirit and the word come to the prophets and the prophets had the word of God that's the reason they could do the Miracles that they did it wasn't the man it was the spirit of God in the man the spirit of Christ in the man what was it the stronger one the stronger man oh church so how could they be what they were they just let the stronger man come in and take possession so what is the gift to get William brandom out of the way Hallelujah he said it wasn't the man it was the spirit of God in the man the spirit of Christ the man what did he done cleaned out every channel God had chose him he was anointed with the Holy Ghost it wasn't him he never did anything till he saw in a vision I just said on Mount Carmel all this I've done at your command now Lord let it be known that you are God oh glory to God said I've seen it too many so many times when you see the spirit of God strike a place and that place get under the anointing oh let us be that place this morning and follow the anointing of the word preach if this little group in here this morning just could take this mind here get every doubt out of the way how can you doubt anymore when you see the dead rais up the lame W the blind see the deaf hear he said the angel of the Lord even his picture hanging on the wall hanging hear on the walls got signs stumped everywhere what does he do stay right with the word glory to God stay right with the word Cuts every devil yes it does what is it the ministering spirits sent from the presence of God to anoint the speakers of the word that stays with the word oh brother steart I read that and I thought I want to always stay with the word yeah because I need that anointing yeah I don't want to preach my complexes right I don't want to preach cuz I got an ax to grind I don't want to preach what somebody tells me to preach let me preach the word let me preach the word let me say what he said because the Angels the ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God to anoint the speakers of the word that stays with the word and he confirms the word with signs following brings Jesus the same yesterday today and forever there he is hallelujah how does he cast out Devils the preaching of the word brother R teaches I don't have time to go into all of it this morning but how by getting you to believe in the stronger man we don't present him as a weak God of yesterday that's why it's so important what we present to the church we're not presenting a weakness but a strength amen right we don't present a god of depression a god of well you maybe if you hold on you might make it you could be lost any moment we don't present that kind of God but we present a god who's the stronger man and when he comes in and takes possession he cannot be cast out there's a revelation there church how could he cast him out how could Jason if if trip wanted to stay yeah in the house Trip's in that room back there helping us out if he wanted to stay there Jason can't cast him out right I mean maybe annoy him to where he goes but that's just what the devil tries to do to us sorry buddy but he can't cast him out he can't pick him up he can't move him why he's stronger than him when the stronger man comes in the devil cannot cast out God if you've ever gotten the baptism of the Holy Ghost the devil can't take that out of you if you've ever received the word of the hour the devil can't oh Church the devil can't make you say well I don't know if the message is right or not you know it's right because a stronger man takes possession of his house right good all right amen he say well I can't fulfill the word cuz finances the stronger man don't say that I can't do what the word says because just my family weakness the devil don't say that I mean the stronger man don't say that the devil does the stronger man says we are more than able yeah Hallelujah what was it when Caleb and Joshua they saw the Giants in the land it's all right I'm closing here pretty soon the the the the the Giants were in the land but Caleb and Joshua oh my the stronger man come by and he they said more than able to take the land right we've seen the evidence of we know what God can do yes I took a bunch out this morning but I'm going to close here in just a minute Revelation 10:1 now we come down we see him come down in our day you see this is what it is it's not some mysterious thing I know people say it was hard to understand the opening of the seals it's not hard if you just understand the stronger man came to take possession of his house good hallelujah what did he do the first time he came here come to take possession of his subjects Hallelujah now he's come down to claim his house that he is redeemed he's come down to claim this these bodies and the Earth which is a an attribute of God that's been redeemed by his blood right that's our future home is actually this Earth he's not come to do away with you he's come to renovate you and renew you bring you back to his thought that's what he does to the Earth he's come down on our day and I saw another Mighty Angel stronger one come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head and his face was the word the sun his feet is pillers of fire now we don't know he John doesn't even say he don't say it's Christ but he says it's Christ by what he says are around him right we know that Christ has comeing our day we know he's coming in a literal body we believe that right but we know he's coming word form why he came in a cloud right he came in a message yes we heard a shout so we we can identify this as Christ because of what's around him pillar feet were his pillars of fire right a rainbow Covenant brother B this Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger speaking of the seventh angel he said But Here Comes one down from heaven rainbow Covenant oh only Christ it could be right Hallelujah and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the Earth showing he had Dominion right over the sea and the and the Earth over the powers of Darkness amen over every political power every every Power of Hollywood he takes dominion over it he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders and UT their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders UT and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever created heaven and things that there in are the sea and things which other in that there shall be time no longer other words he said these things will not be delayed right but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets what did he come down he come down with a title deed to his house yeah Hallelujah oh we don't even church if we knew what this word meant to us we'd be running all over the building he couldn't keep us still you talk about a rejoicing and a come on he come down to take possession of his house hallelujah hallelujah comes down with a title seed in his hand to claim his attributes something Beyond Pentecost thank you right said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day right remember when the word fell on the day of Pentecost the spirit fell there at Pentecost the original that seed had to go into the ground right it was predestined to go into the ground he said that won't work in this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride going home in the bride we got something different the Pentecost has represented that again we're in the bride age yes sir he taught us that Mary was not the seed she was the shut she was not the seed Mary was not just a shut tassel and sto carriers are part of the word not all the word Luther had justification wesle had sanctification Pentecostals and the restoration of the gifts but when the word came glory to God he says when you come to say I am my father or one these other things that shut pulls away from it but the real genuine how many real genuine bride do we have here this morning the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God yes Hallelujah in what in its fullness right and in its strength good Hallelujah the stronger one has come that's why demons start acting up that's why they get cast out cuz the stronger one come by Hallelujah and he showed us in a prophet what he could do in a bride body that's right are you hearing me Church through the ministry of a prophet he showed us what he would do like a first fruit of the Resurrection he showed us as Jesus was the first fruit of the Resurrection he raised Jesus as the wave sheep that raised in our generation and the Word was waved over the people again and said he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah he said I come to do the will of him that sent me he said there was the seed he said which one of you can condemn me of unbelief I'm skipping down because I don't have time he said God has verified that through me he said who can tell now but the seed and Mary the shuck it was close to being that but it wasn't it was still in the womb in the Pentecostal age over the Lutheran age through the Lutheran age through the westan age it's been the same through this Pentecostal age but notice that the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word someone say that with me the full word is to be born into manifestation again when was it born the first time in Bethlehem right are you with me now the full word God in flesh was born in the manifestation now the full word is to be born into manifestation again and is Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth right so has the stronger one come come on Church according to the message of the hour who has com in our day the stronger man has come by there's nothing we should be afraid of the stronger one come by manifesting the same way doing the same things he did when it was here on Earth he Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever St Luke 17:30 in the last days it wasn't the days of Sodom when the son of man be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing the world in a Sodom condition the church has went into Sodom with it like lot and his wife and I say that there is an elected church somewhere in this world that's pulling out and set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention oh I'm preaching with everything I got this morning the stronger man has come down to claim his house hallelujah amen I'm going to skip past that I don't know what's got into me I always preached all my notes lately it's just not happening Brother Bron said where the carcass is the Bible says where the E where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together brother Brandon repeats that he said Pentecostal said there's going to be a great thing happening he said it's happening and they don't know it that's it yes sir for where the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered just as sure as the world what is the carcass the word he is the word the carcass Christ Christ in you the same yesterday today and forever Christ in you that's what we're preaching it's not some you say well you're trying to elevate a man I know people think that we're trying to elevate brother Brandon that's not the purpose of what we're doing we Elevate the ministry of Christ in our day because we believe Christ came in our day and had something to say when he come it wasn't just a sign but a voice follows a sign so we Elevate that because in elevating that it tells us there's something in US yeah right ye are of God Little Children John said and have overcome them because greater someone say greater greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world how can the strong man keep possession of his house this morning if greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh Church you don't have to be afraid of devils you don't have to be afraid of death itself oh death Paul said where is your sting oh grave where is your Victory the stronger man came by and took the sting out of death Hallelujah the brand said here is the secret the musicians go ahead and come the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord that don't sound like a weak powerless bunch of people can't even preach no more right come on Church sitting around can't even get together no more scared to have church hiding in their little H somewhere that's not what God called he called you to be a mighty Army he called you to be a people that performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord and the word is quickened by the spirit it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and water it comes to full Harvest serving his purpose those in the bride do only his will yeah no one can make them do otherwise why the stronger man has come by taking possession they have thus say the Lord they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word listen to this now as we close he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works Works in and through the bride Hallelujah she knows that it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do what are those things brother been speaking tongues run around the church that's part of it but what of the things that he has not have not yet been fulfilled that's we've seen that what has not yet been fulfilled the Rapture the change of the body right Hallelujah he will now there's some things certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time that song I thought of that old song There's No One greater than Jesus because Legion come by and and he'd never there' never been anyone greater and he had to say when when Jesus left that place he said there's no one greater than Jesus and and when the woman at the well oh church when she stood there and had many husbands and and he revealed The Secret of her heart and she'd come back forgiven and she went testified she lost all her shinness and everything else and she went and began to worship God I'm sure she cried out come see a man there's no one greater than Jesus listen to me Church there no one greater than Jesus this morning no one greater than the word made flesh flesh and he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world let the
