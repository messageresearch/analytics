[42:02] Lord Lord I I don't know I've been
[42:05] through a lot but I'm going to give the
[42:06] devil a black eye tonight
[42:08] talked about the old woman who was deaf
[42:11] and she just couldn't hear nothing and
[42:13] and she would go to church but she
[42:15] didn't get nothing out of it and they
[42:17] finally asked you said why do you keep
[42:18] going to church and she said well I just
[42:21] want to show the devil whose side I'm on
[42:23] so that's why you're here today so the
[42:25] devil whose side that you're on Amen
[42:27] y'all pray for me I gotta a test it's
[42:30] got to be run tomorrow so if you can't
[42:32] get a hold of me for a while I they got
[42:33] to put me under for a couple hours so
[42:36] just just keep me in your prayers I
[42:38] don't like to talk about those things
[42:40] there's nothing serious it's just
[42:41] something that I got to have done and
[42:43] and uh so if you can't get a hold of me
[42:46] that's why tomorrow Exodus 4 24
[42:50] because it came to pass by the way in
[42:52] the end that the Lord met him and sought
[42:55] to kill him
[42:56] this is a strange scripture
[42:59] this is God's prophet
[43:02] this is the man who's going down to
[43:04] Egypt to take over
[43:05] just met God saw him face to face
[43:09] had a burning bush experience
[43:12] he goes down to do what God called him
[43:14] to do and the Lord met him and sought to
[43:15] kill him
[43:17] then Sephora that's Moses wife took a
[43:20] sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin of
[43:22] her son and cast it at his feet
[43:24] that surely a bloody husband art thou to
[43:26] me
[43:27] so he let him go God let Moses go
[43:30] then she said a bloody husband Thou Art
[43:33] because of the circumcision
[43:35] the Lord of that is blessing to the word
[43:37] you may be seated I want to continue
[43:39] tonight talking about our
[43:42] The Exodus family that we're going to
[43:45] pick that back up maybe for tonight and
[43:48] maybe a few more services
[43:51] and we we left off with Moses in this
[43:55] miraculous condition he's he has met God
[43:59] in the burning bush he knows who he is
[44:01] he knows what he's called to do he's
[44:04] been given the authority to go and do
[44:06] and what he's been called to do and
[44:08] God's been working on him for 40 years
[44:10] down on the back side of the desert and
[44:13] yet when he come in the presence of God
[44:16] there were some things while he was in
[44:18] the wilderness that he had neglected to
[44:21] do
[44:22] and in any time that you find yourself
[44:25] in a Wilderness spiritually or in a
[44:28] backslidden condition and maybe we're in
[44:30] those conditions more than we would like
[44:32] to admit you'll find that you neglect to
[44:35] do some things and you leave some things
[44:37] off and and he had he neglected to do
[44:41] some things with his family
[44:44] and when he had neglected in that way uh
[44:47] here he was God had given him this
[44:49] ability he had helped him he'd been in
[44:52] the presence of God but being in the
[44:54] presence of God doesn't absolve you of
[44:57] the of the necessary thing that you have
[45:00] to do you still got to go back and do
[45:03] what you promised God you would do at
[45:05] the beginning and and so there were many
[45:07] things in Moses life that needed to be
[45:10] corrected just like there's many things
[45:11] in our life that needs to be corrected
[45:14] and God's going to be working on us
[45:15] until we leave here and I'm glad of that
[45:18] tonight it's not just the overnight
[45:20] thing but he's working on you and he's
[45:22] working on me and he's making us what he
[45:25] wants us to be I'm happy about that
[45:27] because I I don't want to be in the
[45:29] condition I'm in even though I'm a saved
[45:31] person I filled with the Holy Spirit but
[45:33] yet I want to be higher I want to be
[45:36] able to to love him more I want there to
[45:38] be more clarity and and more
[45:40] understanding and more peace and more
[45:43] love more of the fruits Spirit then then
[45:45] what I have now and so when I know that
[45:48] he's not done with me yet then I know
[45:50] there's more for me to have and I'm so
[45:52] grateful for that today I think that's
[45:54] true of all of us
[45:55] we notice that Moses's neglect
[45:58] in forgetting the Commandment of God
[46:02] that he had been he had been ordained to
[46:05] do
[46:05] and this is the thing that made the
[46:07] Hebrews unique among all the nations
[46:10] it was not a little thing
[46:13] it was a big deal in Genesis 17 and 10
[46:16] God says this is my Covenant which you
[46:18] shall keep between me and you and thy
[46:21] seed after thee he said every man child
[46:24] among you shall be circumcised
[46:27] it shall circumcise the Flesh of your
[46:29] foreskin and it shall be a token of the
[46:32] Covenant betwixt me and you and he that
[46:35] is eight days old shall be circumcised
[46:37] among you he said every man child in
[46:39] your Generations he that is born in the
[46:42] house or bought with money of any
[46:43] stranger which is not of thy seed God
[46:46] wasn't leaving any exemptions here
[46:48] if there's a male here in your house or
[46:51] even a stranger that you're caring for
[46:54] even a servant he said he's going to be
[46:55] circumcised on the eighth day
[46:58] every one of them and he said he even
[47:02] the one that's bought with money he was
[47:03] born in thy house and he just bought
[47:05] with that money must needs to be
[47:07] circumcised and my Covenant shall be in
[47:10] your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant
[47:12] and the uncircumcised Man Child whose
[47:16] flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised
[47:18] that Soul shall be cut off from his
[47:21] people he hath broken my Covenant so in
[47:24] the Old Testament you couldn't be saved
[47:27] if we could say it that way you couldn't
[47:28] be one of God's people you couldn't be
[47:31] identified as one of God's people
[47:33] without the sign of circumcision that
[47:36] that had to be done and it was important
[47:39] that parents did that because it wasn't
[47:41] up to the kids they couldn't do it they
[47:43] were too young and so and so the parents
[47:46] had to take care of that
[47:49] the child would not be counted as a
[47:52] child of God without it
[47:55] so brother random says there they are
[47:57] going down to Egypt
[47:59] he said and now watch how neglectful a
[48:01] man can get
[48:03] and we're talking about not just any man
[48:05] but a prophet
[48:07] a major prophet A God Called man a man
[48:11] who's seen the pillar of fire who knows
[48:13] who God is knows the power of God
[48:17] and yet he's neglectful
[48:19] he's neglectful and he says in the end
[48:22] God met him down there in the end and
[48:24] would have slayed him and Sapporo went
[48:26] and took a sharp Rock and circumcised
[48:29] her two children with a sharp prop and
[48:31] throwed the foreskin before Moses and
[48:33] said you're a bloody husband to me
[48:35] he said only save Moses life
[48:39] huh
[48:40] I want you to watch how God was dealing
[48:43] with this family because I and I think
[48:46] we're all uh we I've told you before we
[48:49] all have a Ministry but especially in
[48:51] Ministry families or in families and
[48:54] officers of the church or or you have a
[48:57] place in the church in that way that we
[48:59] have to be careful that we don't become
[49:01] so busy with the business of the church
[49:04] and with the business of what's going on
[49:07] at church that we don't that we neglect
[49:09] to do some things we need to do at home
[49:12] so what was Moses doing he said Moses
[49:16] gotten such a hustle and bustle of the
[49:18] day till he was in such a place to go
[49:21] down there he forgot the Seal of
[49:24] circumcision he forgot the main thing
[49:27] the main difference between him and
[49:31] everybody else
[49:33] the biggest thing that God told them to
[49:36] do to be make a a mark of demarcation of
[49:40] separation between him and the world was
[49:42] the circumcision and he forgot that seal
[49:45] he said and that's where we are doing
[49:47] today
[49:48] he said that's where the Holiness
[49:49] churches are failing we've got so much
[49:52] time the Lord has given us a lot of
[49:53] money we're building great big churches
[49:55] and big spiers and putting plush seats
[49:57] and pipe organs until we forgot the Seal
[50:00] of God which is the baptism of the Holy
[50:02] Ghost he said true God send us a
[50:05] zipporah
[50:07] oh
[50:09] my we're gonna get into this in a minute
[50:11] send us a support
[50:12] he said that's right circumcision
[50:15] he said every male in Egypt of Israel
[50:17] that wasn't circumcised was cut off and
[50:20] circumcision was the Seal of the promise
[50:22] circumcision the Old Testament it's the
[50:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the new and
[50:26] every man outside the patches of the
[50:28] Holy Ghost will be cut off
[50:30] so it's a serious thing that our hearts
[50:33] would be circumcised by the Holy Ghost
[50:37] I'm not going to hold you long tonight
[50:38] for your sake and for mine but our heart
[50:41] has to be circumcised by the Holy Ghost
[50:43] in Deuteronomy 36 you find where Moses
[50:47] spoke of it of something coming that
[50:49] there would be a people who'd be
[50:50] circumcised in heart in Romans 2 29 Paul
[50:53] explains that and explains that we are
[50:55] circumcised in heart and not in the
[50:57] flesh so God was it was so important to
[51:01] God that Moses obeyed
[51:05] that he was willing to take his
[51:07] prophet's life
[51:10] huh
[51:11] now think about it for a minute that's
[51:13] why he said obedience is better than
[51:15] sacrifice
[51:17] that's somebody that'll obey God God
[51:19] help me to be one that'll obey God
[51:21] that'll do the little things in the in
[51:23] the way that God wants me to do them
[51:27] but now
[51:28] what did Moses fail to do
[51:31] he had failed to give his children the
[51:34] same chance that he had
[51:38] because he was circumcised
[51:40] brother Bill his parents took care of
[51:42] him
[51:44] but now they didn't give his their
[51:46] children the same chance
[51:48] I know some of you come out of the world
[51:50] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[51:52] Ghost you you come out of you come out
[51:54] of sin you come out of denominations you
[51:56] come out and maybe bad backgrounds or
[51:58] whatever but your children have to have
[52:00] the same chance that you have
[52:02] and in order to do that there's got to
[52:04] be an atmosphere there is whether Joel
[52:05] was talking about Sunday night got to be
[52:07] an atmosphere where our children can
[52:09] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:10] and it's we're a responsible Church
[52:13] we're responsible to provide a home that
[52:15] there's an atmosphere that's there and
[52:17] whatever we have to kick out we need to
[52:19] kick out whatever we have to do away
[52:21] with we need to do away with whatever we
[52:23] have to do to get our kids in church we
[52:24] need to do that because God's going to
[52:26] be looking for us because we're the one
[52:28] responsible to make sure that atmosphere
[52:30] is there right
[52:32] so that they have the opportunity to be
[52:34] washed in the blood they have the
[52:36] opportunity to be saved just like we
[52:38] were saved
[52:40] people come in the message and give
[52:41] their heart to the Lord and come to an
[52:43] altar and then maybe 30 years later
[52:45] they're sitting there or 20 years later
[52:47] they're sitting there with children and
[52:48] they're sitting by themselves because
[52:50] they took a job that kept them out of
[52:51] church or or are they or they they went
[52:54] they got hurt at somebody and the pastor
[52:56] heard them or maybe they don't believe
[52:58] in Preachers no more so they're sitting
[52:59] out by themselves
[53:01] and they don't realize that they're not
[53:03] giving their children a chance come on
[53:06] and they die spiritually
[53:09] because they're not doing the thing for
[53:11] their children that's required
[53:17] now God gave this commandment brother
[53:20] Brandon says every male must be
[53:21] circumcised
[53:23] God when he called Moses to go down
[53:24] there and deliver the children of Israel
[53:26] Moses hadn't performed on his sons the
[53:30] very delivering sign
[53:32] he's going down to be delivered but he
[53:35] hadn't performed you know maybe he's
[53:36] thought like this he thought well maybe
[53:38] I'll I'll make things a little easier
[53:39] for my kids
[53:41] that's a hard surgery
[53:43] huh they just make things a little
[53:45] easier
[53:46] we just we just won't talk about that
[53:48] well you know they've been baptized they
[53:50] they come in the church and associate
[53:52] with the Believers we'll just make
[53:54] things a little bit easier we won't we
[53:56] won't have an altar call we won't have a
[53:57] we won't have a good old-fashioned Holy
[53:59] Ghost baptism well we'll just let them
[54:01] we'll just let them sit there and become
[54:03] Believers but you don't become a
[54:05] Believer by sitting in the church no
[54:07] more you become an automobile by sitting
[54:08] in the garage
[54:10] all right you become a Believer by the
[54:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:14] by the filo and that's not speaking in
[54:16] tongues that's not an emotion that's not
[54:18] a sensation but the baptism of the Holy
[54:20] Ghost is the literal Life of Christ
[54:22] manifested in you how do I know I
[54:24] haven't brother being because your life
[54:25] begins to act like his there begins to
[54:28] be a desire for the things of God rather
[54:30] than for the things of the world
[54:32] and our kids have to have that because
[54:34] if they keep their natural carnal
[54:36] desires every one of them will leave
[54:38] every one of them and you just have to
[54:40] pamper them but if you ever get them to
[54:42] the Holy Ghost you won't have to treat
[54:44] them like a hotbed plant but they'll be
[54:46] a rugged Christian
[54:50] now
[54:51] Moses said no he was a deliverer
[54:54] but he hadn't performed the delivering
[54:56] sign on his children
[54:58] he said would you he said it would be
[55:00] like me saying all you church now every
[55:01] one of you come in have been baptized
[55:03] here with water we put you on the church
[55:05] membership we're all going to Glory
[55:06] together he said well brother that's not
[55:08] scripture
[55:09] unless you're born again circumcised
[55:11] with the Holy Spirit he said you've got
[55:12] to be I don't care how good you are what
[55:14] church you belong to how good your
[55:16] parents was except you as an individual
[55:18] has been born again by the Holy Ghost
[55:21] you'll never go in the rapture
[55:24] I want my kids to be in the Rapture with
[55:26] me
[55:26] I want our young people to be in the
[55:28] Rapture with us I want the Next
[55:30] Generation have the same chance that we
[55:32] had
[55:33] how are they going to have that by the
[55:35] Deliverance sign we got to teach it we
[55:37] got to talk about it we got to have an
[55:39] atmosphere that presents that
[55:43] come on he said you can't go that's the
[55:45] very delivering sign the circumcision
[55:46] the circumcision is by the Holy Spirit
[55:49] and so they asked for the random
[55:51] questions send questions answers he said
[55:53] the questioner asked does this scripture
[55:54] mean that God aimed to kill Moses or his
[55:55] son and why
[55:57] he said God was after Moses
[56:00] and Sephora was was the only one that
[56:02] saved him
[56:04] all right amen thank God for a good
[56:06] spouse
[56:10] and watch he said for support got a
[56:12] sharp Rock
[56:13] and went and cut the foreskin off her
[56:16] baby and threw it before Moses said thou
[56:18] art a bloody husband to me
[56:20] what was she doing doing what needed to
[56:22] be done
[56:25] that wasn't her job
[56:28] right that wasn't her position
[56:32] but she was doing what needed to be done
[56:35] now I'm not talking about stepping into
[56:37] the pulpit or taking a stepping outside
[56:39] of what God called you to be as a lady
[56:40] or a wife or a mother but when it comes
[56:43] to your children and it comes to getting
[56:45] them in the house of God if Dad won't do
[56:48] it Mom you've got to do it
[56:51] huh somebody's got to step up
[56:56] and cause some dissension
[56:58] in a home where that where the things of
[57:00] God have been neglected
[57:03] are you with me so far I trust that's
[57:05] none of us tonight but I'll say this
[57:07] even as a pastor sometimes we neglect
[57:09] things at home
[57:11] and we need to be called to account for
[57:13] that and say Lord help me to do the
[57:16] right things in my house
[57:18] Church of priority help me to make the
[57:20] house of God a place where my my kids
[57:22] want to go and help me to help me to not
[57:24] talk bad about the church and or the
[57:26] pastor or the people in the church
[57:28] because I know my children will feed off
[57:30] of that
[57:31] help me not to be a griper and a
[57:34] complainer help me to be somebody
[57:35] that'll be on fire for God and have the
[57:38] right attitude
[57:39] I know it's hard to have a right
[57:40] attitude when you got everything going
[57:42] wrong everything's a mess
[57:45] it's hard to have the right attitude
[57:46] when everything's just uh everything's
[57:48] going down the hill it seems like it and
[57:50] you're hurting and everything's bad but
[57:52] there's there's a virtue in it that's
[57:54] when that's when you're overcoming
[57:56] is when you have a good attitude when
[57:58] you don't when you're not expected to
[58:04] God was after Moses
[58:06] the poor has saved him and God would
[58:09] took Moses life and perhaps the angel
[58:10] was standing there
[58:12] said Zapora catch it quickly
[58:16] the poor went and circumcised the baby
[58:18] said Moses you're so concerned about
[58:19] everything else and about your journey
[58:22] Strong Boy hasn't been circumcised
[58:25] oh I hope we hear it tonight Church
[58:28] you're so concerned about church things
[58:31] you're so concerned about being a
[58:32] deliverer so concerned about your profit
[58:35] work which was a great work
[58:38] but you're so concerned about what's
[58:39] going to happen what's Pharaoh gonna say
[58:41] what's going to happen down in Egypt are
[58:42] they going to believe me but you never
[58:44] ask about your family
[58:46] you never examined to see if they were
[58:49] in the faith
[58:51] see everybody wants to do something for
[58:53] God
[58:55] at church
[58:57] but what about our home life brother
[58:58] Brandon talks about he said everyone's
[59:00] going to India or go to go to Africa he
[59:03] said but I tell them if you talk to your
[59:04] neighbor
[59:06] have you witnessed to your neighbor do
[59:08] they know about salvation have they been
[59:09] born again
[59:11] everybody wants to do something for God
[59:13] but what about at home
[59:15] brother random talked about a preacher
[59:16] and a woman that we're doing missionary
[59:19] work and and they come and stayed in a
[59:21] motel together we know that's wrong
[59:24] amen
[59:26] I mean just say this for the children
[59:27] for the kids sake if not for ours if a
[59:30] man and a woman Stay Together overnight
[59:32] they need to be married
[59:35] that's just that's just the way it is
[59:38] I didn't make up that rule that's what a
[59:40] prophet of God taught us that's that's
[59:41] just decency at one time that was just
[59:44] the thing that you did that we live in a
[59:46] different world now
[59:48] and our time I remember as a kid I'm
[59:51] only 38 years old I say only
[59:53] but I'm only 38 years old but when I was
[59:56] a kid it was a terrible thing to see
[59:59] people shacking up
[1:00:01] and now it's the common thing
[1:00:03] there's more people now that are
[1:00:05] unmarried than what are married that are
[1:00:08] of marrying age because you're just not
[1:00:10] expected to get married anymore I thank
[1:00:12] God for some young people we've had some
[1:00:14] marriages lately I thank God for that
[1:00:16] thank God for you that have gotten
[1:00:18] married and instead of shacking up or
[1:00:20] living like the world living like the
[1:00:22] devil
[1:00:23] and that that part's free but but now
[1:00:26] what what happened brother man talked
[1:00:28] about that woman that preacher doing
[1:00:30] that he ought to known better
[1:00:31] but brother bear said the reason that
[1:00:33] they did he said what happened to that
[1:00:34] woman she just kept messing around
[1:00:36] without receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:00:38] he said just like that woman Over Yonder
[1:00:40] today that called me wanted to marry
[1:00:42] that man and leave her own husband and
[1:00:44] marry the man she'd come in such a place
[1:00:46] oh God you know people get so mixed up
[1:00:49] because they've not ever been they've
[1:00:52] never really really settled it with God
[1:00:55] she'd come in such a place maybe one
[1:00:57] time being in contact with God but had
[1:00:59] been lusting after the things of the
[1:01:00] world and I asked her I said have you
[1:01:02] received the Holy Ghost she said not yet
[1:01:04] but I'm seeking it I said you get the
[1:01:06] Holy Ghost first he'll tell you what
[1:01:07] husband to have
[1:01:11] you come to me as a married person tell
[1:01:13] me brother Ben I want to make sure I got
[1:01:14] the right one you know who the right one
[1:01:16] is if you're married
[1:01:22] yeah right it's the one God gave you
[1:01:26] now
[1:01:28] wow
[1:01:29] I could have prophet of God neglect the
[1:01:30] main thing
[1:01:31] in his own home it happens
[1:01:34] he was out of Fellowship
[1:01:36] he was out of Fellowship naturally
[1:01:39] there was no one there no peer pressure
[1:01:41] nobody else was circumcising their
[1:01:44] children
[1:01:45] you see the danger of that
[1:01:47] there's no there's no church pressure
[1:01:50] God uses that
[1:01:52] iron sharpens iron
[1:01:54] but that wasn't the only thing he was
[1:01:56] out of fellowship with God
[1:01:59] Moses was back there waiting and he said
[1:02:01] what did he do he went to work for his
[1:02:02] father-in-law Jethro and he was hurting
[1:02:03] his sheep out in the desert place a
[1:02:05] perfect picture before us tonight of a
[1:02:07] Believer out of fellowship with God
[1:02:09] there he was no Fellowship not one thing
[1:02:11] in that 40 years was spoke that God did
[1:02:14] for him or anyway any Supernatural he
[1:02:16] was out of fellowship and when the
[1:02:18] church gets out of fellowship with God
[1:02:20] Miracles cease signs and wonders cease
[1:02:23] Revival cease God just moves right out
[1:02:25] when you get out of Fellowship he said
[1:02:27] well what do we do what do we need to do
[1:02:28] brother Ben to have Miracles what do we
[1:02:31] need to do to have science and wonders
[1:02:32] do we need faster music do we need more
[1:02:34] people that's not what we need why do we
[1:02:36] need a good old house cleaning we need
[1:02:38] to get back in fellowship with God
[1:02:40] whatever stopped up the conduit between
[1:02:42] us and God get rid of that
[1:02:46] repentance is always the way to Revival
[1:02:50] are you with me now
[1:02:53] foreign
[1:02:55] I'm preaching it myself
[1:02:58] as well as you
[1:03:00] well the random said Miracle cease God
[1:03:01] just moves right out when you get out of
[1:03:03] Fellowship he said but the thing to do
[1:03:05] you want to know what to do keep the
[1:03:07] love of God in your heart
[1:03:09] keep fellowship with him and he will add
[1:03:12] these other things just as we mature
[1:03:15] I love that
[1:03:17] so support is temper
[1:03:20] I think about it
[1:03:22] saved a prophet's life
[1:03:26] laughs
[1:03:29] brother Branham said
[1:03:31] when and I'll keep down here because I
[1:03:33] don't want to take much time tonight but
[1:03:34] he said he was taking his own son to
[1:03:37] deliver the children of Israel
[1:03:38] uncircumcised
[1:03:40] he said you know did you ever study that
[1:03:42] right close
[1:03:43] Moses had a temper you know that finally
[1:03:45] kept him out of the promised land his
[1:03:46] temper
[1:03:47] and God had set him back out there and
[1:03:49] give him a little high tempered wife too
[1:03:51] he said I bet they had some trouble on
[1:03:53] the backside of that desert
[1:03:56] yeah
[1:03:58] God knows how to tame you down
[1:04:01] aren't you glad he does
[1:04:03] you said but brother Ben I thought when
[1:04:05] I got in contact with the burning bush
[1:04:07] when I well when I received the Holy
[1:04:09] Ghost everything would just be okay
[1:04:10] you're still a sticky nature you're
[1:04:14] still you God's still got some molding
[1:04:16] he's still got some working our place at
[1:04:18] the altar is not only when we're safe in
[1:04:20] fact you don't even have to come to the
[1:04:22] altar to be saved
[1:04:23] you just have to believe in the Lord
[1:04:25] Jesus Christ be baptized but our place
[1:04:28] many times is at the altar as Christians
[1:04:33] why because we need to we need to get
[1:04:36] back to some of them things we've
[1:04:38] neglected
[1:04:40] so God works on us and the way he works
[1:04:42] on Moses was to give him a high tempered
[1:04:43] wife
[1:04:44] I hope he hasn't worked on you in that
[1:04:46] way
[1:04:49] but God knows how to tame you down
[1:04:52] me down
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:57] she cut off that foreskin and
[1:05:00] throwed it before and said you're a
[1:05:02] bloody husband he said my he knew how to
[1:05:03] fix him up
[1:05:05] take that temper out of him
[1:05:08] God was doing something for Moses he
[1:05:10] married an Ethiopian girl and she had a
[1:05:11] lot of temper Moses had a lot of temper
[1:05:13] that was his trouble
[1:05:15] the Brandon one place called it his
[1:05:16] besetting sin
[1:05:18] I just imagine things wasn't so peaceful
[1:05:20] back there on the back of the desert at
[1:05:22] times but God gave it to him
[1:05:25] he said now if you think you married a
[1:05:26] woman has a little temper maybe God's
[1:05:28] trying to tame you down a little
[1:05:31] at least the wives should have said amen
[1:05:36] of course if you say Amen to that you're
[1:05:37] admitting you have a tempers
[1:05:42] he said you know Moses had a temper and
[1:05:44] God give him the wife my name is Zapora
[1:05:46] she had one too
[1:05:47] so I imagine everything wasn't so
[1:05:49] pleasing back on the back side of the
[1:05:51] desert for a while when both of their
[1:05:53] tempers got out of control at the same
[1:05:55] time
[1:05:57] that don't sound very pleasant does it
[1:06:00] imagine what it must have been like what
[1:06:03] it must have felt like for the people of
[1:06:05] God because this didn't end like this
[1:06:07] was something they worked on all through
[1:06:09] God was working on Moses and we know
[1:06:11] Moses still had a temper because he
[1:06:13] missed the promised land because of it
[1:06:15] all right so God's working he put him
[1:06:17] with his high tempered woman all of his
[1:06:19] life he works on him imagine what it
[1:06:21] must have been like in their tent
[1:06:23] here's Prophet Moses and all the people
[1:06:26] walking around saying Prophet Moses he
[1:06:27] don't do nothing wrong well he's got the
[1:06:30] spirit of Christ and he did
[1:06:33] the Bible says he did he had it what
[1:06:36] looked like a better idea than God but
[1:06:38] remember that was the spirit of Christ
[1:06:39] on him when he stepped in the gap for
[1:06:41] the people
[1:06:43] he still had a high tempered wife
[1:06:46] and a high temp for himself
[1:06:49] I imagine there were people who
[1:06:50] slandered him because of it in fact we
[1:06:52] know that there were people who made fun
[1:06:54] of her
[1:06:55] but I love the fact that she may have
[1:06:57] been high tempered but she was Moses
[1:06:58] wife
[1:06:59] and when Moses sister and his brother
[1:07:02] listen this improves to you too that the
[1:07:05] marriage relationship comes before the
[1:07:06] family relationship
[1:07:08] why because when when Miriam and Aaron
[1:07:11] made fun of sappora God said you made
[1:07:14] fun of Moses
[1:07:16] right because he didn't say that about
[1:07:19] the brother and the sister
[1:07:21] right but he said that about the wife
[1:07:22] because these two are one
[1:07:24] she was God's choice for him
[1:07:27] probably wouldn't have been our choice
[1:07:30] he said I suppose his intellectual
[1:07:31] conception of how psychology ought to
[1:07:34] control a person didn't do much good
[1:07:38] because when he was on his road down to
[1:07:40] Egypt I see sapora still had a temper
[1:07:44] I always wondered about folks that
[1:07:46] fought all the time why do that
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:49] why do that but there's something worse
[1:07:53] it's when you don't care
[1:07:56] it is worse
[1:07:59] and if you don't care whether it's your
[1:08:01] spiritual relationship or your natural
[1:08:02] relationship if you don't care you need
[1:08:04] to Shake Yourself
[1:08:06] that's a dangerous place to be
[1:08:10] notice he failed miserably failed and
[1:08:12] run into the desert for another 40 years
[1:08:14] while God had him back on the back side
[1:08:16] of the desert we're married this
[1:08:17] Ethiopian woman Zapora and she was high
[1:08:20] tempered Moses was to I guess there was
[1:08:22] some little trouble in the backside of
[1:08:23] the desert once in a while
[1:08:24] he said don't turn your wife down
[1:08:26] because she's got a little temper maybe
[1:08:28] that's your cross
[1:08:31] well it got quiet
[1:08:33] he said God might have give it to kind
[1:08:35] of keep you lined up
[1:08:37] same thing he said with you women to
[1:08:39] your husbands stick together you
[1:08:41] promised God you would so stay with it
[1:08:44] he said notice I'm a person don't
[1:08:46] believe in marriage and divorce you know
[1:08:48] that look my brother if you went at that
[1:08:50] more prayerfully there'd be less of it
[1:08:52] amen we're a church that don't believe
[1:08:54] in marriage and divorce
[1:08:56] right because brother Branham didn't I
[1:08:59] understand people get messed up it's not
[1:09:00] the unpardonable sin but we don't
[1:09:02] believe in marriage and divorce we want
[1:09:04] the marriages to last forever
[1:09:07] and I believe if we'll do our part and
[1:09:09] teach the people in the right way when
[1:09:10] they're old they won't depart from it
[1:09:13] somehow God will keep them
[1:09:15] now but again the poorest temp for what
[1:09:18] seemed to be a fault and it was a fault
[1:09:20] temper the wrath of man doesn't work the
[1:09:22] righteousness of God it was a fault
[1:09:25] but God put them two faults together to
[1:09:27] help both of them
[1:09:29] but that temper saved Moses life and and
[1:09:32] sometimes you know when marriage goes
[1:09:34] bad we tend to blame all of our problems
[1:09:36] on our spouse the same thing's true of a
[1:09:39] spiritual sense I've noticed that people
[1:09:40] who leave the message their life goes
[1:09:43] bad for something happens and they lose
[1:09:45] their confidence or they lose their
[1:09:47] faith and then they begin to blame
[1:09:48] everything on the message
[1:09:50] well the reason I'm bankrupt and living
[1:09:52] in the back of a school bus is the
[1:09:54] message
[1:09:55] and and it had very little to do with
[1:09:58] the message
[1:09:59] all right man it had to do with
[1:10:01] somebody's interpretation of the message
[1:10:03] you had very little to do with the
[1:10:05] message of the hour
[1:10:07] but now uh people people blame the
[1:10:10] message over that but the same thing
[1:10:11] happens in with a husband and wife many
[1:10:14] times when a marriage goes bad that you
[1:10:16] tend to blame everything on them
[1:10:18] let's say well if it wasn't for you I'd
[1:10:19] have went to school and got a real job
[1:10:23] if it wasn't for you I well I tell you
[1:10:25] what it wasn't for you I wouldn't have
[1:10:27] so many kids it wouldn't cost me so many
[1:10:29] problems
[1:10:31] two
[1:10:34] what if the person
[1:10:36] that God gave us
[1:10:39] literally saved our life
[1:10:44] by being all the things that we dislike
[1:10:48] about them
[1:10:51] let me say that again
[1:10:53] what if the person God gave us literally
[1:10:56] saves our life by being all the things
[1:10:59] we dislike about them you say it can't
[1:11:01] happen it did with Moses
[1:11:06] maybe God knew that you needed somebody
[1:11:08] who wouldn't put up with your nonsense
[1:11:13] praise God maybe God knew that you
[1:11:16] needed somebody who would be an
[1:11:17] encourager it would be a helper but
[1:11:19] maybe he knew you needed somebody who
[1:11:21] could be who could who could who could
[1:11:22] sin right toe-to-toe with you
[1:11:25] sometimes that's what you need
[1:11:27] now and so we look at Abraham and Sarah
[1:11:31] it's Abraham saved Sarah's life
[1:11:34] you remember what was it God couldn't
[1:11:37] kill Sarah because of Abraham oh there's
[1:11:39] a great spiritual truth here Church her
[1:11:42] marriage saved her life
[1:11:44] because she laughed at the promise of
[1:11:46] God she laughed at the at the word being
[1:11:49] open to her
[1:11:50] was the messenger of the hour here was
[1:11:53] god with skin on him sitting out there
[1:11:56] revealing the secrets of of of Abraham's
[1:11:59] heart and when he did she laughed
[1:12:02] made fun of it should have died for it
[1:12:06] laughed in the face of God but God
[1:12:08] couldn't kill her
[1:12:10] brother bear said that's Grace
[1:12:12] he said God would assume her right there
[1:12:14] but he couldn't he said oh he said see
[1:12:16] our stupidity he'd kill every one of us
[1:12:18] but he can't
[1:12:20] kill Sarah he had to take Abraham
[1:12:22] because Sarah was a part of Abraham they
[1:12:24] were one in Union and to take the church
[1:12:27] and destroy it he can't do it because
[1:12:28] it's part of himself Christ part of
[1:12:31] himself the word being made flesh well
[1:12:33] I'm so glad I'm a part of him
[1:12:36] that's good let's go back for a minute
[1:12:39] what again what caused the trouble at
[1:12:41] home
[1:12:41] for Moses and Sephora neglect
[1:12:45] how is it resolved by doing what had
[1:12:47] been neglected
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:51] go back where you left off I was to do
[1:12:54] your first works
[1:12:57] you you neglected something neglect is a
[1:13:00] it's a terrible thing
[1:13:02] brother Abraham says this he said you
[1:13:04] say I have a holy thirst but I'm not
[1:13:06] guilty brother I'm gonna just go and
[1:13:08] joining church and things like this
[1:13:10] he said but see to neglect a thirst
[1:13:12] if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of
[1:13:14] water or food you'll die if you neglect
[1:13:17] that thirst and you for God you will
[1:13:19] spiritually die
[1:13:20] he said you call for revivals you wait
[1:13:22] for your church to have a Revival well
[1:13:23] that ain't the Revival for you the
[1:13:25] Revival ought to begin right into you
[1:13:27] when you begin to thirst for God there
[1:13:30] might not be another member of the
[1:13:31] church wanting that Revival but if it
[1:13:33] breaks out on you it'll break out in
[1:13:34] other places but see you neglect that
[1:13:35] thirst he said you neglect to Milk The
[1:13:38] Cow when the udder is full of milk you
[1:13:39] let that cow stay like that she'll go
[1:13:41] dry
[1:13:42] that's exactly right if you neglect to
[1:13:44] take a drink of water say I just ain't
[1:13:45] going to drink anymore you'll die you
[1:13:48] neglect to eat food you'll die he said
[1:13:51] if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit
[1:13:52] the word of God you'll die something as
[1:13:55] simple as reading your Bible
[1:13:58] did you neglect to do that you'll die
[1:14:02] there's always an action and a reaction
[1:14:05] I heard a story about out in the desert
[1:14:08] in in the west they had a pump and it
[1:14:11] had to be primed before you get any
[1:14:13] water out of the well
[1:14:14] the pump had to be primed so they had a
[1:14:16] bucket of water sitting there there's
[1:14:17] two things that you could do and you saw
[1:14:19] it you could either obey the
[1:14:22] instructions had a little sign on it
[1:14:23] telling you what to do and pump the
[1:14:25] thing believing that there was going to
[1:14:28] be water come or you could drink the
[1:14:30] water but if someone ever drank the
[1:14:32] water the next person that came would
[1:14:34] die
[1:14:36] because they didn't prime the pump
[1:14:38] there had to be somebody pouring the
[1:14:40] water on to get anything out of it
[1:14:43] that's true of Christian Life that's
[1:14:44] true of marriage
[1:14:46] you can't neglect to prime the pump
[1:14:50] Moses knew to circumcised his sons he
[1:14:52] just didn't do it
[1:14:55] most husbands and wives know what it
[1:14:57] would take
[1:14:59] for their marriage to be right
[1:15:01] they just neglect doing it
[1:15:03] I realize there's some knots they're
[1:15:05] very hard to untie but most people
[1:15:07] know what to do
[1:15:10] and they just don't do it
[1:15:12] the early church knew what to do to get
[1:15:15] back in favor with God
[1:15:17] they didn't die from lack of knowledge
[1:15:20] they didn't slip into apostasy from a
[1:15:23] lack of Doctrine
[1:15:25] what did they slip from
[1:15:27] they lost their first love
[1:15:30] huh they lost it they lost that bucket
[1:15:33] of water
[1:15:34] and then one day they went to the water
[1:15:36] and it was it was wasn't wouldn't
[1:15:37] produce water anymore why because they
[1:15:39] drank the water and they formed a Creed
[1:15:41] or a denomination instead of priming the
[1:15:43] pump
[1:15:44] many times we come to the house of God
[1:15:46] we're looking for God to do something
[1:15:47] for us but have you prime the thumb have
[1:15:50] you poured the water on the handle have
[1:15:52] you primed the pump where it'll work
[1:15:53] have you given God your praise have you
[1:15:55] have you prayed have you read your Bible
[1:15:57] have you prayed have you talked to God
[1:15:58] he said brother man are you trying to
[1:15:59] condemn a snow I'm not trying to make
[1:16:01] you feel bad you don't feel any worse
[1:16:03] than I do when I preach on these Saints
[1:16:05] because many times we neglect God but
[1:16:06] I'll say this I'm not trying to do that
[1:16:08] I'm trying to get you to prime the pump
[1:16:10] because I know what the results will be
[1:16:12] but the game I know what the results
[1:16:13] will be of you coming to the house of
[1:16:16] God even though you didn't feel like it
[1:16:17] I know what the results will be of a
[1:16:19] church that gets down on their knees
[1:16:20] before God and begins to cry out for
[1:16:22] Revival I I know what the results will
[1:16:25] be but then we've seen it too many times
[1:16:27] if you've been around very long you've
[1:16:29] seen God move when somebody prime the
[1:16:31] pump somebody put their praise in
[1:16:33] somebody testified somebody worshiped
[1:16:35] God somebody got down to business with
[1:16:37] God you've seen what God could do and
[1:16:39] I'm ready to see God moving again I'm
[1:16:41] not going to go on yesterday's Revival I
[1:16:44] want to see him move tonight
[1:16:46] then I gotta put into work the necessary
[1:16:48] work that has to be done
[1:16:53] the early church knew what to do
[1:16:56] they lost their first love
[1:16:58] the poorer did what needed to be done
[1:17:01] even though it wasn't her job
[1:17:04] you know marriage has lasted many times
[1:17:06] because someone decided they would
[1:17:10] your spouse sometimes wants to lay out a
[1:17:12] church
[1:17:13] you go anyway
[1:17:16] and won't pray and read the Bible you do
[1:17:17] it anyway
[1:17:19] they're all human
[1:17:22] right you sit there and point fingers
[1:17:23] you can just do what needs to be done
[1:17:28] the Bible says it this way he said what
[1:17:30] Noah said oh wife
[1:17:31] whether Thou shalt save the husband
[1:17:34] sir how knows thou man whether Thou
[1:17:35] shalt save thy wife
[1:17:37] see people who see married to the 50 50
[1:17:39] splitter in a dangerous place
[1:17:41] because they're always going to feel
[1:17:42] like the other person isn't doing their
[1:17:44] part
[1:17:46] you know marriage is like sweet tea
[1:17:48] now forgive me I come up with this
[1:17:50] illustration all by myself
[1:17:55] to get good sweet tea there's a few
[1:17:57] tricks a few things you have to do
[1:18:00] first of all you've got to warm up the
[1:18:01] water
[1:18:03] yeah
[1:18:04] we used to make sun tea anybody do that
[1:18:08] that's a little different it don't taste
[1:18:10] like sweet tea to me there's a way that
[1:18:12] sweet tea has to be made
[1:18:15] right and it's not in a coffee maker
[1:18:17] sweet tea needs to be made a certain way
[1:18:20] you warm up the water and when the water
[1:18:22] is warm before it's diluted you don't
[1:18:25] let it sit on the stove for an hour or
[1:18:28] two hours or five hours
[1:18:30] but what do you do while it's hot
[1:18:32] you pour it in The Jug you all know what
[1:18:35] I'm talking about
[1:18:36] and then what do you do you pour sugar
[1:18:38] in it
[1:18:40] while it's hot
[1:18:41] now up north and when I was a kid you
[1:18:44] know when we were growing up we were we
[1:18:45] were underprivileged we didn't have
[1:18:46] sweet tea at least not at restaurants
[1:18:49] because I grew up in the far north
[1:18:50] region of Central Missouri West Central
[1:18:54] Missouri
[1:18:55] praise God we got some main manners
[1:18:57] I grew up in the far regions
[1:18:59] and and up there they didn't have sweet
[1:19:02] tea in restaurants until McDonald's came
[1:19:04] along with sweet tea we didn't know what
[1:19:06] that tasted like
[1:19:07] we had sweet tea at home but it wasn't
[1:19:09] as sweet as my wife's sweet tea because
[1:19:11] she'd come from Mississippi
[1:19:13] so I had to learn how it was done but we
[1:19:15] thought we had sweet tea you know what
[1:19:16] we did we I know I'm going way off the
[1:19:18] beaten path just hang with me for a
[1:19:20] minute you know what we did we took a
[1:19:22] cold glass of tea with ice in it
[1:19:24] and poured sugar in it
[1:19:27] all right and they Jason's about to die
[1:19:31] up here sounds awful doesn't it poor
[1:19:34] sugar and then you got the grains the
[1:19:36] sugar you know just floating around in
[1:19:37] the cup
[1:19:38] so you're drinking tea and sugar but
[1:19:41] you're not drinking sweet tea
[1:19:45] what happened it's not 50 50. it becomes
[1:19:48] one
[1:19:49] see in order
[1:19:51] oh God in order for the tea and the
[1:19:55] sugar and the ice
[1:19:58] to kind the water to come together it's
[1:20:01] got to be brewed it's got to be put
[1:20:02] together while it's hot
[1:20:06] and the sugar has to be poured in while
[1:20:09] it's hot
[1:20:10] and some people 20 years later don't
[1:20:12] realize that why why are these flowers
[1:20:15] not working anymore
[1:20:17] well you didn't do it while it was hot
[1:20:21] it's good anyway
[1:20:27] you didn't pour any sugar in while it
[1:20:28] was hot
[1:20:30] I'll tell you young couples keep it
[1:20:32] alive
[1:20:33] keep it alive pour the sugar in all the
[1:20:35] top put plenty in there Make It Sweet
[1:20:38] because you want it to be one unit
[1:20:40] you can't if you neglect to do that
[1:20:42] you're going to end up and what you have
[1:20:44] to do marriage is just reheating over
[1:20:46] and over and over and over again because
[1:20:48] as it sits there but you got to keep
[1:20:50] making it keep making it keep making it
[1:20:51] what are you doing first you warm it up
[1:20:53] and then you pour the sugar in and then
[1:20:55] you then you begin to be one unit again
[1:20:59] see Jesus when he comes and Woos us when
[1:21:01] he comes in and deals with us he doesn't
[1:21:03] neglect us but from the beginning he's
[1:21:06] wooing us to him even when we were
[1:21:08] children we didn't understand but he was
[1:21:10] calling us to him and at the right time
[1:21:12] when he when he got us heated up in the
[1:21:14] right atmosphere we came to him and then
[1:21:17] he poured the sugar in amen and he
[1:21:19] caused us to become one with him
[1:21:25] he did what needed to be done
[1:21:28] well I love that
[1:21:31] Through the Bible says husbands love
[1:21:32] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:21:34] church and gave himself for it what did
[1:21:36] Jesus do he did what needed to be done
[1:21:39] when we were Sinners alienated without
[1:21:41] God in the world in that buck of mud
[1:21:44] as soon as I talked about this morning
[1:21:46] God came to us God sought you you never
[1:21:49] sought God no man can come to me except
[1:21:51] the father draws him first and God came
[1:21:54] down in that muck what you were and
[1:21:56] sought you out and brought you out he
[1:21:59] said that ought to create a perfect love
[1:22:01] look what you was and look what you are
[1:22:03] what did that somebody that loves you
[1:22:05] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:22:07] promised you then real genuine love will
[1:22:10] create a confidence in his word
[1:22:14] oh my God
[1:22:17] musicians go ahead and come huh I want
[1:22:19] to show
[1:22:21] brother Branham
[1:22:23] told us tells a story over and over
[1:22:25] again on the message about a man named
[1:22:27] Sam Isler
[1:22:28] Sam user was the state senator
[1:22:31] from
[1:22:33] Indiana from the Jeffersonville area
[1:22:36] and one day brother Branham after his
[1:22:39] wife and his daughter die
[1:22:41] and at that time I believe if understand
[1:22:43] the story correctly Billy Paul was
[1:22:44] really sick
[1:22:46] and he goes up there to the to the place
[1:22:48] and
[1:22:49] add to the cemetery he's up there he
[1:22:52] talks about how he could just hear the
[1:22:53] the song you know there's a land beyond
[1:22:55] the river we call the sweet forever and
[1:22:57] he's he's real emotional about it he
[1:23:01] said he was standing there and and Sam
[1:23:03] Isler the state senator stops his car
[1:23:06] and he comes up to the he comes up to
[1:23:08] him and and he begins to talk to him he
[1:23:11] said Billy he said I know what you've
[1:23:12] been through
[1:23:14] he said I I seen your your wife die he
[1:23:17] said and I've seen you this Sam Isler
[1:23:19] that's a picture of him in the in the
[1:23:20] newspaper it tells about him running for
[1:23:22] state senator just so you could put a
[1:23:24] face with a name
[1:23:25] but Sam I sir was a a man who who had
[1:23:30] seen brother Branham and he said I've
[1:23:31] seen you pray all night he was a man who
[1:23:33] had him sings he played the guitar and
[1:23:35] brother Branham would go to those hymn
[1:23:36] sings and sing with him
[1:23:38] he said I've seen you sing all night and
[1:23:40] worship God I've seen he said I know
[1:23:42] that you get you you've done so much for
[1:23:44] God
[1:23:45] he said what's what keeps you
[1:23:48] he said have you kept your religion he
[1:23:50] said I haven't kept my religion he said
[1:23:52] this kept me
[1:23:54] and he said he said what's keeping you
[1:23:57] he said do you still love him
[1:23:59] oh my that's a good question isn't it
[1:24:02] do you still love him
[1:24:04] he said I can't help but love him
[1:24:07] but Joey said if he sent me to hell
[1:24:10] I'd still love him you've heard brother
[1:24:12] Brandon say that that's where it come
[1:24:14] from was that conversation he said if I
[1:24:15] if he sent me to hell today
[1:24:18] I'd still love him because I didn't seek
[1:24:20] Him He sought me
[1:24:23] he found me
[1:24:25] he called me
[1:24:27] don't you see the Redemptive power of
[1:24:30] overwhelming love I preached to you
[1:24:32] about it before but you take your love
[1:24:34] that's so strong that won't take no for
[1:24:36] an answer that'll stand there and do
[1:24:38] what needs to be done
[1:24:41] and Jesus did what needed to be done for
[1:24:43] for for brother Branham and so he said
[1:24:45] how could I not love him
[1:24:47] if he sends me to hell now it's a
[1:24:49] hypocrite I'd still love him he said
[1:24:52] there's no love in hell but he said he's
[1:24:54] so much in my heart I'd still love him
[1:24:56] anyway
[1:24:58] oh God I wonder if that's the way we are
[1:25:00] tonight
[1:25:02] you realize how many marriages would be
[1:25:04] saved
[1:25:05] if somebody was willing to do what needs
[1:25:08] to be done to save it
[1:25:10] whatever needed to be done
[1:25:13] you realize
[1:25:14] how many
[1:25:17] how many Christians would still be in
[1:25:19] church
[1:25:22] if they recognize that somebody did
[1:25:25] what needed to be done all I'm doing is
[1:25:28] returning that love that's an easy thing
[1:25:30] to do that's not hard
[1:25:33] listen brother Branham he goes through
[1:25:34] he excuse me he goes through hell and
[1:25:37] back
[1:25:38] he's lost everything
[1:25:39] he told his life story this has always
[1:25:42] struck my heart and he says this he's
[1:25:44] he's praying at the end of it he gets to
[1:25:45] where he can't he can't tell it no more
[1:25:48] he's not done but he just he's too
[1:25:50] emotional he can't tell it
[1:25:51] he said I've tried with all my heart
[1:25:53] dear Jesus to live for you
[1:25:56] to do the thing
[1:25:59] he said no matter what this cross is
[1:26:01] or how scornful it seems to be
[1:26:05] listen to these words
[1:26:07] I love you dear Jesus
[1:26:09] you've broken my heart
[1:26:11] over and over
[1:26:13] but I love you
[1:26:17] what was Jesus doing from what needed to
[1:26:18] be done why why do you go through what
[1:26:20] you go through him doing what needed to
[1:26:22] be done
[1:26:24] it's hard for us to understand that but
[1:26:26] the game we don't understand why God
[1:26:28] deals with us the way he does but he's
[1:26:29] doing what needs to be done
[1:26:32] take us home with him
[1:26:35] would you bow your heads with me
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:47] maybe we could just all of us
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:53] maybe we've neglected something in our
[1:26:55] prayer life Maybe
[1:26:56] maybe with our children
[1:26:59] we've
[1:27:00] taken every opportunity to skip church I
[1:27:03] don't know I I know people I'm not
[1:27:05] talking about people going on vacation
[1:27:06] and things that happens
[1:27:08] but just when the desire is not there
[1:27:09] anymore
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:16] you just don't feel like that Love's
[1:27:17] like it used to be
[1:27:19] turn up the stove
[1:27:23] you can't make good sweet tea
[1:27:26] without warm water
[1:27:31] you can't have a good relationship with
[1:27:33] Jesus Christ
[1:27:36] without doing what needs to be done he
[1:27:38] did everything he can do he's done
[1:27:40] to will you to him to bring him to you
[1:27:42] to him the only thing left is human will
[1:27:45] that's the one thing he can't do for you
[1:27:49] you realize that he gave you put you on
[1:27:51] free moral agency that's the one thing
[1:27:52] he can't do for you but he's wooing you
[1:27:54] he's calling to you and if you ever get
[1:27:56] a picture if you ever recognize what he
[1:27:58] did for you Lord you've loved me with
[1:27:59] overwhelming love
[1:28:01] Let Me Love You Like That God
[1:28:04] and if I've neglected something while I
[1:28:06] was in the wilderness of pain while I
[1:28:08] was in the wilderness of uncertainty
[1:28:10] while I was in the wilderness of a
[1:28:11] vaccinating condition and I find out
[1:28:13] later what it was oh God let me let me
[1:28:15] call out to you Lord let me be willing
[1:28:18] to do what needs to be done
[1:28:20] even if it's even if it's hard even if
[1:28:22] it's
[1:28:23] even if it's discouraging even if it's
[1:28:25] painful
[1:28:27] let me do what needs to be done to have
[1:28:30] a relationship to fix things at home

[1:28:40] neglected this or that you want your
[1:28:41] husband to love you but maybe there's
