[0:00] not be enough.
[0:04] Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[0:10] would not hear my prayer.
[0:15] But praise the Lord. The word is done
[0:20] and Christ Lord is
[0:25] I would not be.
[0:30] No
[0:33] deny
[0:36] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[0:42] would let's sing that first verse again.
[0:46] With pain of death seized on my soul
[0:52] to the Lord I cried
[0:57] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:03] would not be denied.
[1:07] No, I would not be enough.
[1:13] No, I would not be
[1:18] till Jesus name. He made me
[1:24] sing the course again.
[1:29] Oh, I would not be enough.
[1:34] I would not be
[1:39] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:45] would not be Jesus.
[1:52] if the ushers would come at this time.
[1:58] I don't have uh any written requests up

[3:37] Let's sing that song, Never Lose Its
[3:39] Power.
[3:47] The blood
[3:49] that Jesus
[3:52] shed
[3:54] for me.
[3:59] Oh, way back on Calary.
[4:07] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[4:11] From
[4:13] day
[4:15] to today,
[4:17] it will never
[4:20] lose
[4:23] its power.
[4:27] For it reaches
[4:30] to the highest
[4:34] mountain you can have your seats.
[4:38] And it flows
[4:41] to the lowest
[4:44] valley.
[4:48] It's the blood
[4:51] gives me strength.
[4:54] From day
[4:56] to day,
[4:59] it will never
[5:02] lose
[5:04] it.
[5:09] It soothes
[5:11] my doubts and calms
[5:16] all my fears
[5:22] and it dries all
[5:27] my tears.
[5:29] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[5:34] From day
[5:37] to day,
[5:39] it will never
[5:42] lose
[5:44] its power. Raise your hands and sing it.
[5:49] for it reaches
[5:52] to the highest
[5:55] mountain
[5:59] and it flows
[6:02] to the Lord
[6:05] with the valley.
[6:10] It's the blood
[6:12] that gives me strength
[6:15] from day
[6:18] to day.
[6:20] It will never
[6:23] lose
[6:25] its power. Sing that chorus again. A
[6:27] sister only comes for it reaches
[6:32] to the highest
[6:36] mountain.
[6:39] And it flows
[6:42] to the Lord
[6:45] with the valley
[6:48] for me.
[6:50] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[6:55] From day
[6:58] to day,
[7:00] it will never
[7:03] lose
[7:06] its power. Do you believe it tonight?
[7:08] Give him a hand clap of praise.
[7:40] Overcomer.
[8:04] I'm an overcomer
[8:08] by the blood of the lamb
[8:12] and by the word of my testimony.
[8:17] Overcomer.
[8:21] I'm an overcomer
[8:25] by the blood of the lamb
[8:29] and by the word of my testimony.
[8:35] He saved me.
[8:39] He rescued me.
[8:44] He delivered me.
[8:48] and he set me free.
[8:52] And ever since I've been changed,
[8:56] I've never been the same.
[9:00] And I can lift my hands and say,
[9:04] "Thank you for your grace."
[9:11] I'm an overcomer

[9:54] word and process.

[10:19] I'm being overcome
[10:23] by the blood of the lamb.
[10:27] And by the word of my testimony,
[10:32] overcome.
[10:34] More than a conqueror, I'm a winner. The
[10:38] joy of the Lord is my strength. I have
[10:42] dominion.
[10:44] And I walk in authority.
[10:47] And I've been washed in the blood. I'm
[10:51] kept by his love. Filled with his
[10:54] spirit. By his stripes I'm healed and
[10:59] I'm free.
[11:01] Yes, Jesus gave me the victory.
[11:06] Overcomer.
[11:07] More than a conqueror, I'm a winner. The
[11:11] joy of the Lord is my strength. I have
[11:15] dominion.
[11:17] I walk in authority.
[11:20] And I've been washed in the blood. I'm

[12:03] by the blood of the lamb
[12:07] and by the word of my testimony.
[12:14] My testimony.
[12:18] My testimony.
[12:22] My testimony
[12:24] is the word of my testimony.
[12:39] We're going to go ahead and have uh
[12:41] Jason and Elijah come up to sing.
[13:14] Homeless world I want to See
[13:19] things down here ain't got no chains on
[13:23] me.
[13:25] But I'm not worried about the future
[13:27] because I know
[13:30] he's ready to come
[13:33] and I'm ready to go.
[13:36] Well, it seems like everybody's talking
[13:40] about heaven.
[13:43] And if you want to go along, you better
[13:46] be believing.
[13:49] I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be
[13:52] leaving.
[13:55] And if you want to ride this train, you
[13:57] better not be slow.
[14:00] You ready to come?
[14:03] Are you ready to go?
[14:06] He's ready to come.
[14:09] Are you ready to go?
[14:13] Sometimes it seems that everything goes
[14:16] wrong.
[14:19] I just sit around and cry and sing old
[14:22] sad songs.
[14:25] But then he whispers in my ear and he
[14:28] lets me know.
[14:30] He's ready to come
[14:33] and I'm ready to go.
[14:36] Well, it seems like everybody's talking
[14:40] about heaven.
[14:42] And if you want to go along, you better
[14:45] be believing.
[14:48] I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be
[14:51] leaving.
[14:54] And if you want to ride this train, you
[14:56] better not be slow.
[14:59] He's ready to come.
[15:02] Are you ready to go?
[15:05] He's ready to come.
[15:08] Are you ready to go? Oh, he's ready to
[15:11] come.
[15:13] And I'm ready to go.
[15:24] Um, Sister McCen, if you would just go
[15:27] ahead and come up to sing and then uh
[15:29] after that, we'll invite our pastor to
[15:31] come.
[16:04] Where would I be
[16:08] you only know.
[16:12] I'm glad you see Lord
[16:16] through us alone.
[16:20] A hopeless case
[16:23] an empty place.
[16:27] If not for grace,
[16:31] where would I be?
[16:35] You will know.
[16:39] I'm glad you see Lord through eyes of
[16:44] love.
[16:47] I'm a hopeless case
[16:51] and empty place.
[16:54] Thank God for grace.
[16:59] Oh precious Lord,
[17:03] take my hand.
[17:06] Oh, lead me on
[17:10] and let me stand.
[17:14] I'm a hopeless
[17:16] place,
[17:18] an empty place.
[17:22] Thank God for grace.
[17:27] Amazing
[17:29] grace.
[17:31] How sweet
[17:33] the sound
[17:35] that saved
[17:37] a rich like me.
[17:42] I once
[17:44] was lost
[17:46] but now
[17:48] I'm found.
[17:50] was blind, but now
[17:54] I see.
[17:57] My chains are gone.
[18:01] I've been set free.
[18:05] My God, my Savior
[18:09] has ransomed me.
[18:13] And like a flood
[18:17] his mercy reigns.
[18:21] Unending love.
[18:24] It's amazing grace.
[18:29] Where would I be?
[18:32] You only know.
[18:36] I'm glad you see me
[18:40] through eyes of love.
[18:44] I'm a hopeless case,
[18:48] an empty place
[18:52] if not for grace.
[18:56] I'm a hopeless case
[19:00] and empty place.
[19:04] Thank God for grace.
[19:19] Thank you all.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again as we invite our
[19:22] pastor to come. Where would I be?
[19:28] You only know.
[19:32] I'm glad you see
[19:36] through eyes of love.
[19:48] If not for grace singing now, where
[19:52] would I be? Oh yes, you only know.
[20:00] Oh, you only see
[20:04] through eyes of love.
[20:08] I was a hopeless cave,
[20:12] an empty place,
[20:16] if not grace.
[20:20] Aren't you glad for grace tonight?
[20:22] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[20:27] When you find, if you make it over
[20:28] there, I believe that you will. You find
[20:30] me find me singing, "Amazing grace, how
[20:33] sweet the sound." What brother Brandham
[20:34] said, "Amazing grace." How sweet the
[20:37] sound. Paul says, "By the grace of God,
[20:40] I am what I am." Aren't you glad for his
[20:43] grace today? You're glad for his mercy.
[20:46] Amen. My goodness. I believe his spirit
[20:50] is here tonight. And I'm going to
[20:51] introduce brother Josh Kathy. Brother
[20:54] Josh, she just moved here and part of
[20:56] the church here with us now, part of our
[20:58] ministry team. And I just I just
[21:01] appreciate them having the confidence to
[21:04] come and I believe it's going they're
[21:05] going to be a big part of what we do
[21:06] here at the church. But brother Josh has
[21:08] got an amazing testimony. I believe he's
[21:10] going to share some of that with us
[21:11] today. And and um you know God has a way
[21:16] of getting you. He's got a way of doing
[21:18] what he does. And I I believe that I
[21:22] believe that there's hope for everyone.
[21:24] And we just love him for that. Thank him
[21:28] for what he's done for us. As brother
[21:29] Josh comes, let's just sing it one more
[21:32] time. Oh, I I was a hopeless case,
[21:34] church. An empty place without form and
[21:38] void, but God rich in mercy. Hallelujah.
[21:43] He found me. Aren't you glad for that?
[21:45] As brother Josh comes, you only know.
[21:49] I'm glad you see
[21:52] how to rise to love.
[21:57] I was a hopeless case. Thank you, Lord.
[22:01] An empty place
[22:05] if not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing
[22:11] grace.
[22:13] How sweet the sound of glory.
[22:21] Oh, but now I found
[22:25] I was a whole space
[22:29] and empty.
[22:33] If not for grace, where would I be? You
[22:36] only know where would I be.
[22:40] Oh yeah.
[23:07] God bless your
[23:16] the house or should I say mostly because
[23:20] when I put something somewhere it gets
[23:21] moved somewhere else
[23:23] just kind
[23:29] but brother Vinnie had asked me to speak
[23:31] this evening and um I'd preached here a
[23:35] few other times maybe a handful of times
[23:37] but thought it would just be a good
[23:39] &gt;&gt; opportunity to share my testimony.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; To share how that how the light got lit.
[23:44] Brother Brandham said, "If you can't do
[23:46] anything else, just tell somebody how
[23:48] your light got lit."
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; And so I believe I believe that and I
[23:52] believe this message with all my heart.
[23:53] I believe this Bible with all my heart.
[23:55] And I it's my absolute.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; And let's if we could let's turn to um
[24:01] Proverbs
[24:04] 13:15.
[24:09] And I didn't um I didn't grow up a
[24:12] Christian. I grew up in this area as
[24:14] many of you might know. Um but I didn't
[24:17] quite grow up a Christian going to
[24:19] church, anything like that. Didn't
[24:20] didn't know much about the message. Um
[24:23] so I have kind of a history in this area
[24:25] that I'm not exactly proud of, but I
[24:29] believe it's a part of our testimonies.
[24:30] I believe those those things are, you
[24:32] know, they're not ordained of God to
[24:34] happen in our lives. And we get that
[24:36] permissive will sometimes, but I believe
[24:38] it can all be put together in our
[24:40] testimonies as a as an evidence as a as
[24:43] something that we can be not well not
[24:46] proud of, but we can say this is where
[24:48] God came in my life and this is who I
[24:50] was and this is who I am now.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; And Proverbs
[24:56] 13:15, it says, "Good understanding
[24:59] giveth favor, but the way of
[25:02] transgressors is hard."
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that'd be the title tonight,
[25:06] the way of a transgressor, which just
[25:07] will be my testimony, but I thought that
[25:09] was a I thought about that scripture and
[25:11] how brother Brandon had mentioned it
[25:13] many times and it felt like it just fit
[25:15] my life. Um, we could just bow our heads
[25:18] for a moment. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[25:22] just thank you for another opportunity
[25:23] to come into your house, Lord, to
[25:25] worship your name. And Lord, we just ask
[25:28] that you would be with us in this
[25:29] service, Lord. that you would anoint
[25:31] ears to hear, Lord. That we could just
[25:32] be a help to somebody, Father. That's
[25:34] all we want to be. It's not we're not
[25:36] standing up here for a show. We're not
[25:38] here to here to please anybody else but
[25:41] you, Father. We just want to help one
[25:43] another. And Lord, I believe a testimony
[25:45] that can happen. I believe when you hear
[25:48] what someone's been through, maybe
[25:49] somebody else is going through it,
[25:51] Father. And you know these things. We
[25:53] don't know everything, but we just ask
[25:54] that you would take full control of the
[25:56] service and that you would just have
[25:58] your way in it. In Jesus Christ's name
[26:00] we ask. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[26:05] This Proverbs and I'm just going to try
[26:08] and talk as I didn't really want to try
[26:09] and preach a sermon tonight. Um, I just
[26:12] wanted to talk as open and as candid as
[26:14] I could about my testimony. I didn't
[26:17] want to get up here and preach to
[26:18] everybody. and you know, but not
[26:21] exactly, but I just wanted to be open
[26:23] about my life. And if I'm going to be a
[26:25] part of you here and I came up here and
[26:28] I have a history here, I would want the
[26:30] church, if I'm going to be a minister in
[26:31] this church, to know about that
[26:33] firsthand, not not hear it from anybody
[26:35] else, not hear it from because I have to
[26:37] say the other night, brother Ben and
[26:40] brother Joel, they had came over to my
[26:42] house that we moved into and um we were
[26:45] sitting there fellowship in the living
[26:46] room and and they were they were kind of
[26:48] poking fun at me, but they were saying,
[26:50] "We've heard a few things about you in
[26:52] this area. we we've heard a few things.
[26:53] And I said, "Well, what did you hear?"
[26:55] And I I don't really want to share
[26:56] exactly what they heard, matter of fact.
[26:59] But it it um it made me it made me real
[27:03] I had never realized how um ashamed I
[27:08] was of who I had been.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. But I never realized how ashamed I
[27:14] was of who I had been. And when when
[27:17] they told me that that night, I had
[27:18] trouble sleeping. I couldn't go to
[27:20] sleep. I thought about it all night. And
[27:22] I was thinking, there just two people in
[27:23] the church. There's a whole church of
[27:25] people here that can talk to anybody and
[27:27] everybody they want to. And so it it it
[27:30] just kind of um I was ashamed about it.
[27:33] But the Lord, he as I prayed, he laid
[27:36] some scriptures on my heart and some
[27:39] some thoughts in the scripture and he he
[27:42] kind of comforted me. He let me know
[27:43] that it wasn't for it wasn't without a
[27:45] purpose because that's exactly as
[27:47] brother Ben preached this morning. And
[27:49] if I get emotional talking about it,
[27:51] &gt;&gt; I apologize. But
[27:56] &gt;&gt; good.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; But when he preached this morning, the
[27:59] earth was without form and void. And I
[28:02] would say that's exactly who I was.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; I didn't know my maker. I didn't know
[28:09] I didn't know who I was,
[28:11] &gt;&gt; plainly put. And the enemy, he wants to
[28:13] keep you on that ground. He wants to
[28:15] keep you not knowing who you are. He
[28:17] wants to keep you as far away from Jesus
[28:20] Christ as he can keep you. He doesn't
[28:22] want you to know
[28:23] &gt;&gt; what what's out there per se.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; And something that uh something that had
[28:28] came to my mind, the scripture, the the
[28:30] first one that had came to mind when I
[28:31] was thinking about giving my testimony
[28:34] was it was actually just a few Bible
[28:35] characters or or people in the
[28:37] scripture. It was Mori and Hmon.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; And how and how Hmon when Mordei
[28:41] wouldn't bow to him, how how he was just
[28:44] after Mordei all the time. He he just
[28:46] wanted what was the scripture doesn't
[28:48] I'm sure tell us that whole story. I'm
[28:50] sure the day-to-day living for Mori was
[28:52] not comfortable
[28:53] &gt;&gt; because he he refused to bow but at that
[28:56] at the and God has a way of doing
[28:58] things.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; He has a way of when the enemy's had his
[29:01] hand on you for so long he has a way of
[29:03] turning it back around on him. Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; And so we get to a point in that story
[29:07] to where Hmon has to be the one I
[29:10] believe it goes that he had to he had to
[29:12] dress Mori
[29:13] &gt;&gt; and he had to will him around through
[29:15] the city. And then you get later on in
[29:16] the story and this would be my testimony
[29:19] right here. You get later on in that
[29:20] story and the the thing that happened
[29:23] was that Hmon had these gallows built
[29:26] &gt;&gt; and his his main thing that he wanted
[29:28] for these gallows right here
[29:30] &gt;&gt; was to hang Morai on them.
[29:33] And then at the end of that story, he
[29:35] flips the script. And God has a way of
[29:37] coming into our lives, coming on the
[29:39] scene, and flipping the script in our
[29:41] life.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; And what he did there
[29:47] was Hmon ended up hanging on the exact
[29:50] gallows that he had built to kill Morai.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what a testimony is.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right. It's you getting
[29:58] up and telling about those gallows that
[30:01] that had your name on them
[30:03] &gt;&gt; that were meant for you,
[30:06] &gt;&gt; but now
[30:07] &gt;&gt; they're meant for the enemy.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; That's what a testimony is.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; And I apologize for getting emotional.
[30:16] It's
[30:18] &gt;&gt; But I believe God respects that. You
[30:21] know, it shows
[30:22] &gt;&gt; when you get it's not there's nothing
[30:24] wrong with crying about your testimony
[30:26] or crying about what he's done for you.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; It's showing how important it was to
[30:29] you.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; And and that's exactly we we talk about
[30:32] revival a lot in the church. If we want
[30:34] revival, then get alone between you and
[30:37] God and think back to what he did for
[30:39] you.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Let your mind really go back to
[30:41] everything he's done for you.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; We We talk about power and knowing who
[30:45] we are and all these things. That's all
[30:47] great and I believe it and I believe
[30:48] that was preached.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. But get alone with God
[30:51] sometimes and think exactly what all
[30:53] you've been through
[30:56] &gt;&gt; because the enemy, you know, the me our
[30:57] memory will betray us so much of the
[30:59] time. That channel of memory, it'll
[31:01] betray you. It'll bring these things
[31:03] from the past rushing in. You did this,
[31:05] you did that. He'll try and bury you
[31:06] under a pile of guilt
[31:08] &gt;&gt; is exactly what he'll do.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; But that channel of memory can also
[31:13] bring to to remembrance all that God has
[31:15] brought you through.
[31:17] I may have been this before, but I'm
[31:19] this now.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not that anymore.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not him anymore.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that's
[31:27] exactly what the enemy wants to do. He
[31:28] wants to get you to doubt your position.
[31:30] And to get you to doubt your position,
[31:32] he's going to bring anything and
[31:34] everything he can against you. Like a
[31:36] court case,
[31:37] &gt;&gt; he's going to pull up all this so-called
[31:39] evidence that he has that I guess he I
[31:41] think he does realize it's under the
[31:43] blood, but he's still going to bring it
[31:45] up. He's going to try and bring it
[31:47] before the believer
[31:48] &gt;&gt; and say, "There's no way this person
[31:51] right here,
[31:52] &gt;&gt; cuz you know who you was. There's no way
[31:54] this person right here was redeemable.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Think about this. Think about when you
[31:58] did this. You did this. Do you think the
[32:00] other people sitting in the church have
[32:02] done that?
[32:03] &gt;&gt; He'll ask you questions like that.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Do you think they've ever struggled with
[32:07] that? Brother so and so, they've lived
[32:09] it their whole life.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; They never had a slip up. But see,
[32:12] that's that's that's presuming that's
[32:14] virtual without authority. We don't know
[32:17] anybody else's life. We've all been
[32:19] through stuff. We all have a testimony.
[32:21] We all have a journey.
[32:24] And it's not always a proudest thing.
[32:28] The definition of testimony in itself, I
[32:31] may not be very I may not go very long
[32:33] tonight. It's a testimony. I might have
[32:36] to go 4 hours if I want. So, I might do
[32:38] that or I might go 30 minutes. I don't
[32:40] know. They preach on this wire. I'm not
[32:43] I should keep going.
[32:45] You know, I'm just I'm just
[32:48] But the definition of testimony
[32:49] according to Webster is a firstand
[32:52] authentification of a fact or one in
[32:56] better terms, an evidence. And that's
[32:58] exactly what my testimony is to me. It's
[33:01] an evidence. It's an evidence that
[33:04] something happened. It's an evidence
[33:05] that God works today. It's an evidence
[33:08] that that the law still works. that you
[33:11] can still claim the blood of Jesus
[33:13] Christ and you can be saved from sin.
[33:16] That's what my testimony is. And your
[33:19] testimony never stops. It wasn't just
[33:22] from the point where when you didn't
[33:23] know the Lord till when you knew him.
[33:25] But I'd like to think that my testimony
[33:27] goes on every single day I live. Every
[33:30] step I take, I wanted to add to that
[33:33] testimony.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to say the Lord save
[33:36] me if I haven't felt his presence again.
[33:39] No. I want say he's walked with me every
[33:42] day since that day and he's never left
[33:45] me and he's never forsook me. He's never
[33:48] let the enemy have me but he's walked
[33:50] with me.
[33:52] He's held me when I couldn't stand up.
[33:55] He's a footprint in the sand.
[33:58] When I couldn't walk, he walked for me.
[34:04] But these testimonies are very I I
[34:06] believe we should have more testimony
[34:07] services. I believe they're important. I
[34:10] believe they're encouraging the
[34:11] prophecy. He was speaking in a message
[34:13] here at the wall apart
[34:16] and in the world fall apart. I think a
[34:19] week before that there had been a lot of
[34:21] testimony services and like he listened
[34:24] to these men tell their testimonies and
[34:26] this is what he had to say. But he said,
[34:28] "Sir, my privilege to be here to be
[34:30] these five testimonies from the brothers
[34:32] that's in love with our Lord Jesus." He
[34:35] said, "Now I still obey all that." He
[34:37] said, "Lord, I say the inspiration I
[34:39] received from your messages."
[34:41] He received the the prophet God received
[34:44] inspiration from these men's
[34:46] testimonies. You think just a little
[34:48] testimony or some deep theological
[34:51] sermon. It it wasn't something
[34:53] groundbreaking. It wasn't something on
[34:54] the seal some on whatever it may be. But
[34:58] when he received inspiration, what he
[35:00] received inspiration from was sincere
[35:03] hearts crying out, was sincere hearts
[35:05] telling a story about what they had been
[35:07] through. That's what he receive
[35:10] inspiration from. And that that's what
[35:12] God looks for so much of the time is a
[35:15] sincere heart that he can work with.
[35:17] That that's the point I believe that I
[35:19] had to get to. And my testimony is when
[35:22] I grew up not going to a whole lot of
[35:25] church. I've never been to church 10
[35:27] times in my whole life. I would say if I
[35:29] was missing up to the point where I
[35:31] where I heard the message and came back
[35:33] to church and as I was growing up,
[35:39] excuse me, as I was growing up, I didn't
[35:41] go to church and my my story is I I got
[35:45] to a point in my life where I was trying
[35:47] to work. I realized there was a vault
[35:50] and there was invitation to go to
[35:52] Wyoming and continue playing. and I go
[35:54] up to Wyoming and I get to collegiate
[35:56] baseball league there. And as I'm
[35:58] playing, you know, I'm I told this at
[36:00] the church in Arizona before I left, I
[36:02] talked about the power transformation.
[36:05] And again, I think you heard some quotes
[36:06] from it this morning. I told them, "I am
[36:09] a believer in the power of
[36:10] transformation." Because anybody that
[36:13] tells me that God still can't transform,
[36:15] I would have a problem with that because
[36:17] I believe I'm I'm a standing testimony
[36:19] of that that God still has that power to
[36:22] transform somebody in their lives. And
[36:25] when he was God started working on me
[36:27] when I was up there and well, I believe
[36:30] it was as he was done chasing me. I
[36:33] shared with somebody the other day, my
[36:35] whole life, everywhere I went, I worked
[36:38] I was surrounded by the message somehow.
[36:41] I worked there and all my life there and
[36:45] I admire my grandma my whole life
[36:48] picture in her home and I never asked
[36:50] any questions. I guess what I thought
[36:52] that was cuz I knew brother Paul was a
[36:55] big fan. I realized that about him and I
[36:58] went in his home one time. I saw the
[37:00] same color fire picture there that was
[37:02] in my grandma's house. And I remember
[37:04] thinking, well, this must just be an old
[37:05] church home. They must all have that
[37:08] picture. I didn't know anything about
[37:09] Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterian or
[37:11] Catholics or anything like that. When I
[37:13] saw the picture, in my mind that this
[37:16] represented somebody that was a pretty
[37:17] good person that they went to church
[37:19] with. That's what I thought it was in my
[37:21] mind at that point. But so I was in this
[37:25] collegiate wing in Wyoming and and God I
[37:27] believe can get to a point where he was
[37:29] done chasing and then he'll get to that
[37:31] point sometimes. Sometimes you'll only
[37:33] be left with two doors in your life that
[37:35] you can walk through that you can accept
[37:37] it or you can deny it. And he got tired
[37:39] of chasing me and I got to a point in in
[37:43] um in Wyoming there that that I kind of
[37:46] just had to come apart my my mind
[37:50] thought I was going crazy, you know. I
[37:53] lost lost my mind is what I would say. I
[37:55] remember being at a
[37:58] if we got time, I'm going to get open
[38:00] and get vulnerable with you for a
[38:02] minute, but I remember being at a gas
[38:04] station and we were pulled in the gas
[38:06] station and all and we were all in a
[38:08] single cab truck about four of us and I
[38:11] was driving and they ran in and I as a
[38:13] pack of cigarettes said, "Hey, will you
[38:15] guys give me some cigarettes out of
[38:16] there?" And I I was sitting in that
[38:18] truck and right when I said that a a
[38:21] physical feeling came over me of fear
[38:23] and dread and anxiety and and it rushed
[38:26] in my body and I didn't know anyone else
[38:28] in the truck. I got out the truck and I
[38:30] was standing there for and I had no idea
[38:32] what was happening to me and I I I I
[38:36] lost um
[38:39] I lost my consciousness of myself and
[38:42] the next thing I know I'm standing in a
[38:44] room. I'm standing on the road. There's
[38:47] cars moving. goes down and I found
[38:49] myself standing right there in the room
[38:52] and I remember I went back to the truck
[38:55] and I called my mom and I didn't know
[38:58] what was going on and I tried to
[38:59] describe it what I was feeling and I I
[39:01] did the best I could to talk about it
[39:03] and I didn't know what it was and that
[39:07] we were staying with I was staying at
[39:08] the coach's home of the team and we went
[39:12] back to the house and I tried to sleep
[39:13] and I've been sleeping all night and
[39:16] this this anxiety My name is hanging
[39:19] over the top of me and I kept calling my
[39:22] mom and this is 15 hours from Dber
[39:24] Tennessee where they were living and sto
[39:28] and we just decided the best thing to
[39:31] happen was come home
[39:33] make it to Dber that's a 15-hour drive
[39:36] and so I don't feel this way now I can't
[39:38] describe the feeling to you if anybody's
[39:40] ever felt anxiety anxiety is fear driven
[39:44] and what anxiety is is you're you're
[39:46] scared something that you don't even
[39:47] know what you're scared of. It's it's
[39:50] irrelevant. It's it's it doesn't make
[39:52] any sense type of fear. It's just a
[39:55] dread and a nervousness that comes over
[39:57] you for
[40:02] anxiety. And I've been told by all the
[40:05] folks that they used to not, you hear
[40:07] anxiety, all this problems with anxiety
[40:09] and things like that. But what anxiety
[40:11] is to me is a is a scare tactic of the
[40:14] enemy. It's something that he places on
[40:16] somebody. But I believe I got to a point
[40:19] where the Lord took a step back and took
[40:21] a I believe he kept me and protected me
[40:24] before I ever accepted him. I believe he
[40:28] kept his eye on me because he knew where
[40:30] he's the alpha. He knew where I was
[40:32] going to end up at. And I believe he
[40:34] kept me. I remember there were times
[40:36] when my friends would be doing things
[40:37] that I thought was a little bit too far.
[40:40] And he would keep me in certain moments
[40:41] like that. There's times where I believe
[40:44] that I was supposed to be dead. I flip
[40:46] here. I don't know what it's called, but
[40:48] the the road on Pocahontas in between
[40:51] where Pocahontas is. And when you get
[40:52] off the road taking in between there, I
[40:56] rolled a truck, a truck with 37in tires,
[40:58] big tall truck, and I rolled. There was
[41:01] a culprit like this and one did a little
[41:03] water and I hit that with my truck and
[41:06] went over it and landed on the other
[41:08] side. You can't explain things like
[41:10] that. You can't explain why you were
[41:13] kept, but he kept me. He He kept us when
[41:16] we were unreliable, when it seemed, when
[41:19] we were unlovable people. that she was
