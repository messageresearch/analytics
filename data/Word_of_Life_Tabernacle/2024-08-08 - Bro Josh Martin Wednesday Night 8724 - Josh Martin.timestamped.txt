[43:04] tonight um I I I've said it before it's
[43:08] it's always an honor whenever you're
[43:09] invited to minister somewhere but it's
[43:11] it's really a special privilege and
[43:13] honor whenever the pastor has confidence
[43:15] in you when he's gone and a way to have
[43:17] you come and minister so I don't take
[43:19] that lightly I pray something can be
[43:21] said tonight that can be a blessing it
[43:23] is good to have my wife with me sister
[43:25] Loretta and my two children Ethan and
[43:27] Brielle also good to have sister Haven
[43:30] with us as she's traveling up to the to
[43:32] the youth camp this weekend so we covet
[43:34] your prayers we'll be heading that
[43:36] direction after service tonight so we
[43:38] definitely covet y'all's prayers amen
[43:41] Matthew 26 and 26 the Bible would say
[43:44] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[43:47] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[43:49] to the disciples and said take eat this
[43:52] is my body and he took the cup and gave
[43:55] thanks he gave it to them saying drink
[43:57] ye all of it for this is my blood of the
[43:59] new testament which is shed for many for
[44:02] the remission of sins can we bow our
[44:04] heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[44:06] Father Lord how we love you and we thank
[44:09] you for your grace and your mercy that
[44:10] you've given us father you've been so
[44:13] good to us Lord as no doubt there's been
[44:15] many wrecks upon the roads father many's
[44:17] in the hospital many may be sick Lord
[44:20] but God we're hear in health in our body
[44:22] father you brought us safely Lord kept
[44:24] us throughout the day throughout the
[44:25] week Lord God many times we we Overlook
[44:28] the little things God but tonight we're
[44:30] stopping and saying Thank You Lord as we
[44:32] come into this portion of the service
[44:34] father I ask that you would anoint your
[44:36] word Lord anoint your servant tonight
[44:38] God this little thought you placed upon
[44:40] my heart I ask that you would anoint it
[44:42] Lord may it may it be received by a
[44:44] Heart Lord and may it be a blessing to
[44:46] somebody in need of it tonight we ask
[44:49] these things in your precious name amen
[44:51] you may be seated tonight and I I have a
[44:54] simple subject but if I had a title it
[44:56] would be the life of the blood and
[44:59] brother Brandon would tell us that we
[45:01] live off of dead substance and he would
[45:03] say when we eat something something had
[45:05] to die before you can partake of it and
[45:08] he would tell us if you eat a a
[45:09] hamburger the the the cow had to die if
[45:11] you eat bacon you know the the pig cats
[45:13] had die and then he would say if you're
[45:15] vegetarian he says the plant that you
[45:17] eat had to die or the vegetable had to
[45:19] Die the the milk the bacteria had to die
[45:23] so we live off of dead substance
[45:25] naturally to live and but the same thing
[45:28] spiritually we have to live off
[45:30] something that has died and we would see
[45:32] through the Old Testament they would
[45:34] come to the Tabernacle and would slay a
[45:36] lamb you know and each year they would
[45:38] slay this lamb the blood would pour upon
[45:40] them and it would cover their sin but
[45:43] there was only a forgiveness not a
[45:45] remission not a separation and so it
[45:47] would be a cycle year after year after
[45:50] year they would come and slay a lamb
[45:52] Lord forgive me for telling a lie and
[45:54] the Lord would forgive them push that
[45:56] sin off but then the next year they
[45:58] would come again Lord forgive me for
[46:00] telling a lie the blood would pour upon
[46:02] them God would forgive them but it was a
[46:04] continuous cycle there was a forgiveness
[46:07] under the blood of bulls and goats but
[46:09] not a remission there was no separation
[46:12] from the sin nature the Bible would tell
[46:14] us in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a
[46:17] shadow of good things to come not the
[46:20] very image of the things can never with
[46:23] those sacrifices which they offered year
[46:26] by year continually make the comers
[46:29] there unto perfect it was just the
[46:31] shadow of a good thing to come but
[46:34] whenever Christ come he didn't just
[46:36] forgive but he brought a remission and
[46:39] the word remission means separated
[46:42] released from prison or bondage and so
[46:44] the blood of Christ would separate the
[46:47] worshipper from their sin that the cycle
[46:50] could be broke that if you come here on
[46:52] a Wednesday night saying Lord forgive me
[46:54] for doing this thing next Wednesday the
[46:57] Cycles broke you're not coming back
[46:59] saying Lord forgive me a year from now
[47:01] Lord forgive me the next year 10 years
[47:03] from now Lord forgive me it was the
[47:05] cycle of blood of bulls and goats it was
[47:08] that it was just a shadow but whenever
[47:11] the perfect come the Perfection came
[47:13] whenever Christ's blood was shed the
[47:16] cycle was broke where that nature not
[47:19] just be forgiven of it but there was a
[47:21] remission of it and I like how the Bible
[47:23] would tell us under the blood of bulls
[47:25] and goats there's remembrance of sin
[47:29] made for each year A Remembrance each
[47:31] year but then the Bible would tell us
[47:34] because the worshippers once purged
[47:36] should have no more conscience of sins
[47:39] so under the bull blood of bulls and
[47:41] goats there's a rembrance of sin each
[47:44] year but under the blood of Christ once
[47:47] purged there's not a cycle but once you
[47:50] are purged there was no more conscience
[47:52] of it so the very thing that was pushing
[47:56] you to sin that is now gone the very
[47:59] thing that is pushing you to a cycle
[48:01] that is now gone the very thing that was
[48:04] pushing you away from God once purged
[48:07] under the blood of Christ there was now
[48:09] no more conscience of it but we would
[48:12] see that it wasn't the literal blood of
[48:15] Jesus Christ but it was the life of it
[48:18] that would bring the remission and I
[48:20] believe if you fail to see the life of
[48:22] it all you have is a form all you have
[48:24] is a chemical all you have is cycle but
[48:27] once you get the life of it you don't
[48:30] have a form but you have a reality and
[48:33] brother Brandon would tell us you he
[48:34] would talk about the literal blood of
[48:36] Christ he says what would I do if I had
[48:38] the literal blood of Christ he says I
[48:40] would be so careful with that little cup
[48:43] he said I wouldn't want to spill it
[48:45] because it's the literal blood of Jesus
[48:47] but then he would stop and say but in
[48:49] front of me is the purchase of the
[48:52] literal blood of Jesus so you might not
[48:55] have the literal blood here but we've
[48:57] got the life of it we've got the product
[48:59] that the life of the that the blood was
[49:02] spilled for oh my you're more important
[49:05] than what you really think we're
[49:06] thankful for the cross but the cross did
[49:09] something for you it brought us
[49:11] separation we got to realize that this
[49:13] message has brought us the realities of
[49:16] it and that's what I love about this
[49:18] message it brought us out of a form into
[49:21] a life you know cuz there's many people
[49:23] thankful for the cross but what did the
[49:25] cross do for you right where they go
[49:27] around say the blood was shed but what
[49:29] did it do for you this message let us
[49:32] know that the cross is more than a
[49:34] crucifix but the Brandon would tell us
[49:37] whenever Christ was being crucified it
[49:39] was the releasing of God so it's more
[49:42] than a crucifix it's more than a story
[49:45] but it was the Life coming inside of a
[49:48] body to bring a separation oh Hallelujah
[49:52] and so it was God releasing his life
[49:55] that is bringing a separation and the
[49:57] Bible Will Tell Us in Hebrews 10:1 17
[50:00] and their sins and iniquities will I
[50:02] remember no more not just forgiven you
[50:05] but when I look at you there's a
[50:07] separation when I look at you I don't
[50:10] see blashe when I look at you I don't
[50:13] see complexes when I look at you I don't
[50:16] see adultery when I look at you the
[50:19] Brandon would say when he looks at us he
[50:21] don't see us all he hears is a voice but
[50:24] he sees your representation oh
[50:27] Hallelujah so it don't matter what your
[50:29] past is it don't matter what you done
[50:32] how many mistakes you've committed when
[50:34] God looks at you he sees a separated
[50:37] group of people not being addicted by
[50:39] drugs or by pornography but he looks at
[50:42] somebody that is separated from the
[50:44] Fallen nature all he sees is the blood
[50:47] when he looks at you he sees the blood
[50:50] he sees Perfection no matter the
[50:52] mistakes no matter the fults he looks at
[50:54] you and he sees the blood oh and I like
[50:57] how brother brand put it consider this
[51:00] since it is the blood of God it is a
[51:02] perfect blood and if the perfect blood
[51:05] is loosening us from the power of
[51:07] bondage and defilement of sin then the
[51:10] loosening is perfect and complete there
[51:13] is now no condemnation who shall lay
[51:16] anything to the charge of God's elect is
[51:19] a God that justifieth declares us
[51:21] righteous who is he that condemneth
[51:24] there it is his death gave us the blood
[51:27] the blood has loosened us there is now
[51:29] no condemnation How can there be there
[51:32] was nothing to be condemned for because
[51:35] the blood has loosed us from the sin we
[51:38] are free Guiltless don't listen to man
[51:40] don't don't listen to man listen to the
[51:42] word you are loosed by the blood it was
[51:45] a perfect blood the blood of bulls and
[51:48] goats wasn't a perfect blood but the
[51:50] blood of Christ was a perfect blood that
[51:53] would bring a perfect loosening a
[51:55] perfect remission and I like up brother
[51:57] the brand I'm would put it don't listen
[51:59] to man listen to the word you were
[52:02] loosed by the blood and I say let's put
[52:05] that on a devil on a complex on fear on
[52:09] insecurities you're loose by the blood
[52:11] don't listen to condemnation that says
[52:13] you did this yesterday you did this 10
[52:15] years ago and you're going to be
[52:17] punished for it you were loosed by the
[52:19] blood it don't matter how far in sin he
[52:22] was it was the mighty hand of God coming
[52:25] and saying I loose you I I free you I
[52:27] separate you and now we stand today with
[52:30] no condemnation cuz there's nothing to
[52:33] be condemned for you know brother
[52:34] brandom would tell us you know if there
[52:36] was a man that would come up and start
[52:38] spreading rumors and would say you know
[52:40] brother brandom has a wife or he cheated
[52:42] he did this and he done that and he says
[52:44] you can come up to me and say brother
[52:46] Brandon I forgive you and he would say
[52:49] for what why are you forgiving me of I
[52:52] didn't do it in the first place and
[52:54] that's what the blood of Christ done oh
[52:56] once you're separated from it the devil
[52:59] can bring it up and say you know what
[53:01] you done you know you done this I did
[53:03] what there's a separation I'm not just
[53:06] Justified or Sanctified there's a
[53:09] separation there's a life on the inside
[53:12] that is keeping me upon the straight and
[53:14] on the narrow oh hallelujah it's a
[53:17] perfect blood bringing a perfect
[53:20] loosening oh Hallelujah so that's why
[53:22] we're no longer known by our own nature
[53:25] but we're separated
[53:26] from the old nature and brother Brandon
[53:29] would say you know we'll never be
[53:30] perfect in her own sight he says you'll
[53:33] never be perfect in my sight I'll never
[53:35] be perfect in your sight and then
[53:37] brother Brandon would say this but what
[53:38] about God's
[53:40] sight oh hallelujah what about God's
[53:43] sight I think if we ever get that
[53:44] Revelation there' be no more back biting
[53:47] oh I'm preaching now there'll be no more
[53:49] gossiping well this one done that this
[53:51] one did this you know what she said you
[53:54] may see that but what does God see oh
[53:56] come on now when God looks at you he
[53:59] sees Perfection oh Hallelujah we look at
[54:02] each other as human beings but when God
[54:05] looks at you he sees a Blood Washed
[54:07] spotless prde of Jesus you see now that
[54:10] don't give us a permission to sin come
[54:12] on now I'm not I'm not preaching that
[54:14] direction I am preaching there's a life
[54:16] there's a holy ghost that can come on
[54:18] the inside and totally Purge the
[54:21] conscience once purged there's no more
[54:24] desire conscience of say and brother
[54:27] Brandon would preach a message or many
[54:29] messages called the token and he would
[54:31] tell us that God showed us longsuffering
[54:34] and his kindness to Egypt and he and to
[54:36] pharaoh and all of the people brother
[54:38] Brandon would tell us he sent a prophet
[54:41] and showed them many signs and Many
[54:43] Wonders Many Wonders and he would show
[54:45] them the pillar of fire and behind those
[54:48] signs was a message and that message was
[54:51] let my people go but brother Brandon
[54:53] would tell us that they would not repent
[54:56] they ignored all of his signs they
[54:58] ignored his messenger they ignored the
[55:00] message and so now by the brand say God
[55:03] got tired of him I like the brand put
[55:05] that God got fed up with him and made a
[55:08] separation so now there's a separation
[55:11] from the make Believers and the real
[55:13] genuine Believers but what was going to
[55:15] make the separation was the life of the
[55:18] land you you would say that there they
[55:21] had to have a token that the purchase
[55:23] was paid for and brother Brandon would
[55:25] tell us that they couldn't put the lamb
[55:27] up there but they had to put the blood
[55:29] up there and the blood was symbolizing
[55:31] that something had died in their state
[55:34] cuz we know judgment was coming upon
[55:36] them through Egypt the firstborn were
[55:38] dying and you know and brother Brandon
[55:40] would say this that's what he was
[55:42] requiring that night to separate the
[55:44] Believers from the unbelievers the
[55:47] believer the worshipper was identified
[55:50] by his sacrifice he must apply the blood
[55:54] oh and he continues on to say it wasn't
[55:56] take and kill the lamb and set the blood
[55:58] out there somewhere else or keep it in a
[56:00] charger or take it down to the neighbors
[56:02] they had to apply the blood and all
[56:05] about that's where many of us make the
[56:07] mistake we fail to apply it come on now
[56:09] we can set in the church every day of
[56:11] our life but if we don't apply the life
[56:13] of it what's that mean brother Josh it's
[56:15] the Holy Ghost right come on brother
[56:17] brand I'm going preach the token and
[56:19] would say it's not the lital blood of
[56:21] Jesus but it's the life of the blood he
[56:23] would say in Egypt they had the literal
[56:25] blood that would upon the doorpost but
[56:27] today it's the life of the blood the
[56:30] holy ghost that we have to apply and we
[56:33] would see that the blood would bring a
[56:35] separation it was a time of judgment it
[56:38] was the time where where God's prophecy
[56:40] was coming to pass and we're living in a
[56:42] time where scripture is being fulfilled
[56:45] right the Bible would tell us there were
[56:48] 200 100,000 demons that has been lifted
[56:50] out of the river the Bible would tell us
[56:52] there signs and the Suns you know there
[56:55] there's a distress upon the nation men's
[56:57] hearts are failing them for fear it's a
[57:00] it's judgment coming upon the Earth it's
[57:03] Spirits going through the homes going
[57:05] through the streets going through the
[57:07] cities but you notice in Egypt the
[57:09] plagues wasn't for the Israelites it was
[57:12] for Egypt and the same thing today the
[57:15] plagues the spirits the complexes the
[57:18] insecurities that are coming upon the
[57:20] people today it's not for you it's for
[57:23] the world oh Hallelujah but what was to
[57:27] separate the Believers from Egypt was
[57:30] the blood oh and can you imagine being
[57:32] there whenever there were looking for
[57:34] something they were looking for
[57:36] something you know but but the Brandon
[57:38] would tell us that they would have to
[57:39] get the his up they would dip it in the
[57:42] blood and they would apply the blood
[57:44] over the doorpost of the of the house
[57:46] and brother Brandon would say hisp was
[57:48] just a common weed that was found all
[57:50] over Palestine and he says and that the
[57:53] hisp represents common faith
[57:56] he says you know and you and could you
[57:58] imagine being there in Egypt Pharaoh is
[58:01] looking for a doctor he's looking for
[58:03] something something special something
[58:05] big to bring the separation but all but
[58:09] right among them was the common weed
[58:12] yeah oh but there was an Insight that
[58:14] was given to the Believers that there's
[58:16] something common right among you that
[58:19] can separate you that can apply the
[58:21] token and oh my we're living in a world
[58:23] of chaos they're looking for a Superman
[58:26] that think a new president is going to
[58:28] help maybe more money is going to help
[58:30] but right among them there's a common
[58:33] faith that has been restored that we
[58:35] have picked up and are applying the
[58:37] token and it's bringing a separation
[58:40] from the Judgment that is coming upon
[58:43] the earth oh while the world is looking
[58:45] for certainty we have found certainty oh
[58:48] come on now right among them is a faith
[58:51] that is brought a certainty oh my well
[58:53] the world is fearing we're living in a
[58:55] peace well the world is in chaos we're
[58:57] living in a sound of mind you see it's
[59:00] faith that applies the token and brother
[59:02] Brandon would preach the token and would
[59:04] say the token is your ticket that the
[59:07] price has been paid
[59:08] for and you know if many if you've ever
[59:11] flown you have to show them the ticket
[59:13] right you first you have to make sure
[59:15] that your ticket is purchased but once
[59:17] you go to the airport you don't go to
[59:19] customs you don't go to the go to
[59:22] security you don't even check in your
[59:24] bag yet you got to go when you check
[59:26] back in then they give you a ticket then
[59:29] once you get that ticket you're eligible
[59:31] for all of the next steps oh come on now
[59:34] but before you check in you can't go to
[59:37] the other steps and brother Brandon
[59:39] would tell us we're not even off first
[59:41] base until we get the Holy Ghost but
[59:44] once we we check in and we are
[59:46] identified with the purchase then
[59:49] everything that was paid for is now
[59:52] given to us you know you know um I have
[59:55] a I have a Plex I'm just going to tell
[59:56] them myself you know H security always
[59:59] makes me nervous I don't know why I
[1:00:01] don't know if you've ever flown before
[1:00:03] you got your ticket your bag is checked
[1:00:05] in you're ready to you'd be nice you're
[1:00:08] ready to go and you get the security you
[1:00:10] know and I've even got that uh I've got
[1:00:12] that that that that pre-checking thing I
[1:00:15] don't even got to take my belt off I
[1:00:16] don't got to take my shoes off I don't
[1:00:18] got to take my laptop out or nothing all
[1:00:20] I got to do is just walk straight
[1:00:22] through and I still get nervous you know
[1:00:24] what what it is is to say my my my my my
[1:00:27] mind and my conscience is trying to get
[1:00:29] me to doubt my token trying to get me to
[1:00:32] doubt what my purchase has brought to me
[1:00:34] and that's exactly what the devil does
[1:00:37] is he comes and he gets you to doubt
[1:00:39] your token if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] brother the brand must say that
[1:00:43] identifies you with all the Redemptive
[1:00:45] blessings that the cross paid for you oh
[1:00:48] if you need healing in your body the
[1:00:50] blood is paid for it and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:53] identifies you with it oh what the devil
[1:00:55] does he comes with nervousness and
[1:00:57] complexes and says it's not for you and
[1:00:59] you step there and you say my goodness
[1:01:01] maybe he's right and you start to second
[1:01:03] guess your token you start to second
[1:01:05] guess what God has done for you but I
[1:01:08] say tonight if your payment is paid for
[1:01:10] you can March straight through the
[1:01:12] victory you can March straight through
[1:01:14] through every complex through every
[1:01:16] insecurity through everything the devil
[1:01:18] puts in front of us because the payment
[1:01:21] has been paid for but you would see that
[1:01:24] once you identify the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:27] you're identified with it that makes you
[1:01:29] eligible for the supernatural but the
[1:01:31] Brandon would say there you are the
[1:01:33] blood the blood excuse me the blood not
[1:01:36] the blood chemistry but the token the
[1:01:39] Holy Ghost the life of the blood that
[1:01:41] comes what does the life do it comes and
[1:01:43] confirms what the token has been
[1:01:46] purchased for the token confirms what
[1:01:49] the blood bought for you the blood
[1:01:51] purchased your Redemption the token is
[1:01:53] the evidence of it oh I love that the
[1:01:56] blood purchased the Redemption but the
[1:01:59] token is the evidence of it the blood he
[1:02:01] was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:02:03] was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:02:05] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:02:08] with the stripes we are healed see all
[1:02:10] blood blood blood then when the token
[1:02:13] comes it shows that you've been
[1:02:15] identified with that sacrifice hey man
[1:02:19] the devil can't keep you from it all
[1:02:21] right ain't that wonderful the devil
[1:02:23] cannot keep you from it so the token
[1:02:26] confirms what the blood bought for you
[1:02:29] it purchased your Redemption then the
[1:02:31] token lets you know it is all yours and
[1:02:34] I believe that should change the way we
[1:02:36] pray we shouldn't go to prayer as just a
[1:02:39] begging God Lord please help me here
[1:02:41] please he this please say my daughter it
[1:02:44] should change our prayers and we should
[1:02:46] come before the Throne of God with
[1:02:47] boldness I've got the token healing is
[1:02:50] mine I've got the token deliverance from
[1:02:53] my loved one is mine my love on my sons
[1:02:56] my daughters my mother my father
[1:02:58] whatever it is they are mine every
[1:03:01] Redemptive blessing that the blood paid
[1:03:03] for I am identified with it but brother
[1:03:07] Brandon would say that it ain't the
[1:03:09] chemical of the blood of Jesus ain't the
[1:03:11] token but it's the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:12] brother Brandon would say in this
[1:03:14] glorious Covenant there's a difference
[1:03:17] between the blood and the life he says
[1:03:20] there's a difference he would say this
[1:03:21] he says we don't have the natural blood
[1:03:23] of Christ but we have the literal life
[1:03:25] Life of Christ he would say that
[1:03:27] whenever there was a life that would
[1:03:29] come inside of Mary and would create a
[1:03:31] blood cell and that cell would create
[1:03:33] another cell and another cell until it
[1:03:36] until it formed the man Jesus it was God
[1:03:39] inside of that man but brother Brandon
[1:03:41] would say that when the blood was shed
[1:03:44] whenever Christ was upon the cross he
[1:03:46] says the blood the chemistry the
[1:03:48] chemical blood went back into the ground
[1:03:51] it would go back to its natural elements
[1:03:54] but he says the life of it would come
[1:03:56] inside of the Believers so we don't got
[1:03:59] the the literal blood of Jesus but we've
[1:04:01] got the literal life of Jesus and then
[1:04:04] brother Brandon would say we are wrapped
[1:04:06] in the life of the blood cell with Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ and so the very same life that
[1:04:12] created the the the deity upon the Earth
[1:04:16] is the same life that comes inside of
[1:04:18] another vessel and brings deity inside
[1:04:22] of this life oh Hallelujah and that's
[1:04:25] why we are more than conquerors through
[1:04:27] Christ Jesus that strengthens us but
[1:04:30] we're living in a day they're trying to
[1:04:32] do away with the Holy Ghost hope this is
[1:04:34] okay tonight they're trying to do away
[1:04:36] with it but we would see that it's the
[1:04:39] token excuse me the connect you to the
[1:04:42] purchase but the brand going say listen
[1:04:44] close while I make these this closing
[1:04:46] remarks if Satan hands you some of this
[1:04:49] stuff like sickness you know what to do
[1:04:51] just show him the token I'm a purchase
[1:04:54] product my healing has been paid for I'm
[1:04:56] a product of God because I have the
[1:04:59] token of the Holy Ghost you cannot keep
[1:05:02] me off of this highway you cannot keep
[1:05:04] me from the from my health I present the
[1:05:07] token and show that you by his stripes I
[1:05:10] am healed here is the resurrection of
[1:05:13] Jesus Christ right in me now to prove
[1:05:17] that to you oh there is a real thing
[1:05:20] there is the token oh there is a real
[1:05:23] thing there is the token I believe we're
[1:05:25] living in a day where where where we're
[1:05:28] we're they're trying to do away with the
[1:05:29] realities of the Holy Ghost trying to do
[1:05:32] away and say it's this it's emotion and
[1:05:33] Sensation that that you can go to the
[1:05:35] far left or you can go to the far right
[1:05:38] but there's a middle of the road where
[1:05:40] there is a real token there's a real
[1:05:42] Holy Ghost there's a real reality that
[1:05:44] can change Natures that can keep
[1:05:46] teenagers that can keep marriages
[1:05:48] together and brother Brandon would say
[1:05:50] you cannot keep me off of this highway
[1:05:53] and the Bible would tell us in Proverbs
[1:05:55] 16 and 17 the highway of the upright is
[1:05:59] to depart from Evil so the highway that
[1:06:03] this blood that the Holy Ghost has
[1:06:05] placed us upon is to depart from evil or
[1:06:08] to separate there's a remission so the
[1:06:11] very that the blood has brought us to is
[1:06:14] a separation on this highway that the
[1:06:17] devil cannot get us off of oh brother
[1:06:20] Brandon would say the healing is on this
[1:06:22] highway there's a real token brother
[1:06:25] Brandon would say in another place
[1:06:26] there's a real Christian it's a living
[1:06:29] experience Pentecost is not a
[1:06:31] denomination Pentecost is an experience
[1:06:34] that anybody can have if they wish to
[1:06:36] have it it's something you can
[1:06:38] experience the Holy Ghost and so it's a
[1:06:41] living experience that put you upon this
[1:06:44] highway that every promise in the book
[1:06:47] is yours and brother Brandon would tell
[1:06:49] us that Enoch walked upon this highway
[1:06:53] and what did he do we know what happened
[1:06:54] he was translating and was raptured out
[1:06:56] of there brother Brandon would say that
[1:06:58] he knew that he was a type brother
[1:07:01] Brandon would say this here in the days
[1:07:03] of Enoch just before the blood well just
[1:07:05] before the flood when Enoch looked out
[1:07:07] there and saw Noah building away on that
[1:07:10] Ark Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew that
[1:07:13] he was a type he knew that before the
[1:07:16] flood came that he had to give an
[1:07:18] example so one afternoon he was becoming
[1:07:22] to him to take a walk and brother
[1:07:24] Brandon would say that morning when he
[1:07:26] got up he says he didn't take his normal
[1:07:29] path he took the King's Highway and he
[1:07:32] walked into his body change he walked
[1:07:34] into the Rapture and that is the same
[1:07:37] Highway that the token has placed us
[1:07:40] upon that we are walking and if we just
[1:07:42] stay upon this highway there's nothing
[1:07:45] that can keep us from every Redemptive
[1:07:48] blessing the God has given us for the
[1:07:50] Brandon would in another place he broke
[1:07:53] the veil of weariness he broke the veil
[1:07:55] of sickness he broke the veil of
[1:07:57] depression he broke every Veil and made
[1:08:00] a highway for the way fearing Men
[1:08:02] Walking Up The King's Highway that's
[1:08:05] where we are walking upon you know the
[1:08:08] token where there in Egypt didn't keep
[1:08:10] judgment from coming it just separated
[1:08:13] them from what was coming upon the Earth
[1:08:16] the token don't keep the Mind battles
[1:08:18] from coming against you the token don't
[1:08:20] keep the heartaches and the pains and
[1:08:23] the discouragement from coming against
[1:08:26] but it does separated from you that you
[1:08:28] can go through it and it does not harm
[1:08:30] you oh Hallelujah you might been
[1:08:33] fighting depression today but there's a
[1:08:35] highway that we're walking upon glory to
[1:08:39] God it's the supernatural upon this
[1:08:42] highway and we can't beat our type come
[1:08:45] on now you can't beat your type the
[1:08:47] world can't help by just acting out who
[1:08:50] their type is they can't help it but you
[1:08:52] can't help it before the word that God
[1:08:55] has given you and we would see that the
[1:08:57] reason brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:08:59] reason the people don't believe this is
[1:09:01] because the token has not been applied
[1:09:04] right that's the reason they can't
[1:09:06] believe it is because the token hasn't
[1:09:08] been applied yet yes you see uh me and
[1:09:11] brother Andrew Glover went to England a
[1:09:13] few years back now to do some meetings
[1:09:16] and we went to our layover was in Paris
[1:09:18] and we had tickets that got us through
[1:09:20] the Customs through security it got it
[1:09:22] we checked in our bags we we were all
[1:09:24] we're good we got to our gate we found
[1:09:26] the gate we sat there I think our leg
[1:09:28] over was a couple maybe three hours or
[1:09:30] so we sat there all that time you know
[1:09:33] and then they got up I said okay then
[1:09:35] you know we're we're ready to start
[1:09:36] boarding so everybody we got in the line
[1:09:38] you know we're excited we're about to
[1:09:40] we're about to make it to our
[1:09:41] destination it's been a long day we get
[1:09:43] all the way up to the ticket booth you
[1:09:45] know the the the we're getting on the
[1:09:47] plane and they says you don't got a
[1:09:48] ticket I said we said yeah we got a
[1:09:50] ticket it's right here they said no you
[1:09:52] don't got a ticket we said yeah we do we
[1:09:54] got a ticket and she says no you don't
[1:09:56] go talk to them over there we're like
[1:09:58] what in the world we had a ticket that
[1:10:01] brought us that far but then they
[1:10:03] decided to cancel our ticket and now
[1:10:05] they're expecting us to make it to our
[1:10:08] destination without a ticket and that's
[1:10:11] exactly what the devil's doing in this
[1:10:13] generation it's the holy ghost that has
[1:10:15] brought the church this far but now the
[1:10:18] devil's trying to cancel the ticket come
[1:10:20] on now it's formalism trying to cancel
[1:10:23] the Holy Ghost and now it's expect let
[1:10:25] me just say this if you try to cancel
[1:10:27] the Holy Ghost and expect your teenagers
[1:10:30] to make a Rapture it's not going to
[1:10:32] happen you can't expect the supernatural
[1:10:35] to get a hold of somebody and you're
[1:10:37] trying to bind up the service or bind up
[1:10:39] the prayer meeting bind up the pastor
[1:10:42] bind up the Holy Ghost you're cancelling
[1:10:44] the Supernatural and are expecting your
[1:10:47] children to make it inter Rapture what I
[1:10:50] say we need to do is open the floodgates
[1:10:52] of Heaven open and let the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] loose that the Holy Ghost can walk the a
[1:10:57] set free the teenagers fill our young
[1:11:00] ones with the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:11:02] cancel it and expect it to work in their
[1:11:05] lives come on now you can't cancel it
[1:11:08] and expect it to work you know you they
[1:11:10] they only thrive in the environment that
[1:11:12] you put them in you know oh hope this is
[1:11:15] okay tonight you see this can happen in
[1:11:17] a church where we cancel it and say you
[1:11:19] know this ain't going to work and
[1:11:20] brother brand would say this how are you
[1:11:21] going to have a Revival of the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost in people quench it bound it and
[1:11:26] they're afraid of it that's where the
[1:11:28] trouble lies that's where the trouble
[1:11:31] Lies when they're afraid of it and they
[1:11:33] try to bind it up but I say Lord we're
[1:11:36] not going to bind the Holy Ghost there's
[1:11:37] a real Holy Ghost but the brand say
[1:11:39] there's been much mocker of every phase
[1:11:41] of religion but there's a real power of
[1:11:44] the Holy Ghost that delivers the human
[1:11:47] being from the bondage of sin there's a
[1:11:49] real power of the Holy Ghost that
[1:11:52] delivers the sufferer from his suffering
[1:11:55] yeah you know there's many mockeries out
[1:11:57] there but that don't take away from the
[1:11:59] genuine I may have given this example
[1:12:01] before you know but you've never seen a
[1:12:04] a 15 counterfeit dollar bill right
[1:12:06] you've never seen a 17 counterfeit
[1:12:08] dollar bill because there's not a
[1:12:10] genuine out there but they do make
[1:12:12] counterfeit off of the genuine there's a
[1:12:15] genuine $1 bill $5 bill $100 bill and so
[1:12:18] they're taking the genuine and they're
[1:12:20] counterfeiting it and that's what the
[1:12:22] devil is doing with the Holy Ghost he's
[1:12:25] taking the genuine and is counterfeiting
[1:12:28] again just giving an emotion just giving
[1:12:30] a sensation here if you just D Dance the
[1:12:32] a you got the Holy Ghost if you do this
[1:12:34] you've got the Holy Ghost but that don't
[1:12:36] take away from the real power that can
[1:12:39] deliver the sufferer from the suffering
[1:12:43] come on now there's there there's
[1:12:45] theology out there that don't take away
[1:12:47] the power of this message come on now
[1:12:49] there there's people out there that are
[1:12:51] hypocrites that are claiming to be
[1:12:53] message Believers but back don't take
[1:12:54] away the power that this message has
[1:12:57] brought us brother the brand would say
[1:12:59] the counterfeit just proves there's a
[1:13:01] genuine so if you see mockeries that
[1:13:04] just means there's a reality that we can
[1:13:07] have in our church oh not just at a
[1:13:09] Revival you know we just came through
[1:13:11] y's meetings and we seen the power of
[1:13:13] God move I was blessed by it but don't
[1:13:15] just stop there the same Holy Ghost can
[1:13:18] come in a Wednesday night meeting and a
[1:13:20] Sunday morning a Sunday night it don't
[1:13:23] matter who's preaching it's the power of
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost that can come inside of
[1:13:27] the life inside of a building inside of
[1:13:30] the temple inside of your bedroom your
[1:13:33] home it don't matter what's happening
[1:13:35] it's the life of the
[1:13:38] blood oh that's what we need today is
[1:13:41] the life it's an expectation God I'm
[1:13:44] expecting to see you I'm expecting to
[1:13:47] see you you know but the Bible would
[1:13:49] tell us that the the the Propet say
[1:13:51] start making ditches start digging
[1:13:53] ditches we don't know how it's going to
[1:13:54] happen they dig the ditches I don't know
[1:13:57] how my children's going to be saved I'm
[1:13:58] digging the ditches come on now you know
[1:14:01] brother Brandon was saying the token I
[1:14:02] was listening to it today and he would
[1:14:04] say apply the token to your brothers
[1:14:07] apply the token to your mother he says
[1:14:10] apply the token and then he you know
[1:14:12] what else he says then he says then kick
[1:14:14] out the shorts yeah he says kick out
[1:14:17] this kick out that and other words
[1:14:19] you've got to be separated before you
[1:14:22] expect them to be separated oh I'm
[1:14:25] preaching now oh you you know too many
[1:14:27] times we come up and say Lord please
[1:14:28] tell my or save my son save my mom save
[1:14:32] my wife but what about you come on now
[1:14:35] for the random says you can apply it but
[1:14:38] then you've got to kick some things out
[1:14:40] as well and I say Lord refill me with
[1:14:43] the Holy Ghost that when I go to
[1:14:45] intercede there's nothing that is
[1:14:48] keeping me from pushing through to the
[1:14:50] throne of God oh the Bible say come
[1:14:53] before the Throne of God with boldness
[1:14:55] if our heart condemn us not then we have
[1:14:58] boldness to enter in right you can't
[1:15:01] come and intercede for somebody if
[1:15:03] you're under condemnation come on now
[1:15:06] you can't come and intercede and say God
[1:15:08] please deliver them but you know
[1:15:10] yourself that you're bound but once you
[1:15:13] get set free from the complexes the
[1:15:15] insecurities then there's a real
[1:15:17] intercession the starts to take place
[1:15:20] God save my daughter save my mom what is
[1:15:23] it there's a separation
[1:15:25] yeah oh Hallelujah I'm digging the
[1:15:29] ditches we're digging the ditches I
[1:15:31] don't know how the water is going to
[1:15:32] come but we're going to wake up and see
[1:15:34] the miracle and I believe the Bible
[1:15:36] would tell us that the ditches filled
[1:15:38] themselves I think I think that when
[1:15:39] they started to dig down water started
[1:15:41] to come up and sometimes you got to dig
[1:15:44] through some things you've got to dig
[1:15:46] through some pride you got to dig
[1:15:47] through some Rebellion you got to dig
[1:15:49] through some heart feelings through some
[1:15:51] bitterness through some gossip but
[1:15:53] underneath all of that dirt here the
[1:15:55] Revival yeah right oh we make we're
[1:15:58] digging ditches yeah oh
[1:16:01] Hallelujah but we would see that how
[1:16:04] come it's this last day in the end time
[1:16:07] that the the the Holy Ghost has come
[1:16:09] under Fire so hard but the brandom would
[1:16:11] say the lamb was killed in the evening
[1:16:13] time after being kept up for 14 days
[1:16:16] then the lamb was killed and the blood
[1:16:18] was applied in the evening time so it's
[1:16:21] in the evening time that the the blood
[1:16:24] is coming to full effect because the
[1:16:26] Bible would tell us that the blood of
[1:16:28] Jesus speaks better things than that of
[1:16:31] Abel right the blood of Abel spoke
[1:16:33] condemnation yeah it was God coming and
[1:16:35] saying Cain where's your brother am I My
[1:16:37] Brother's Keeper well his blood cries
[1:16:39] out against you so it was the blood of
[1:16:41] Abel that cried out against against Cain
[1:16:44] but the blood of Christ don't cry out
[1:16:46] against you it cries out for you and
[1:16:49] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:16:51] blood the voice of the blood the blood
[1:16:53] has a voice and the voice of the blood
[1:16:56] is the word so it's the word that has
[1:16:59] been restored in this last generation
[1:17:01] that is speaking to you speaking for you
[1:17:04] but the token that is applied it
[1:17:07] connects you with what the blood is
[1:17:09] speaking oh Hallelujah you notice
[1:17:12] whenever you know I just love it
[1:17:13] whenever I'm sitting in a church service
[1:17:15] and the preacher gets up and he starts
[1:17:17] preaching or or I'm listening to a tape
[1:17:19] at work and something just connects and
[1:17:21] I say man that's for me has that ever
[1:17:23] happened to y'all before where you're
[1:17:25] listening or or you're reading a
[1:17:26] scripture and something just connects
[1:17:28] it's the life of the blood the Holy
[1:17:30] Ghost connecting with the voice of the
[1:17:33] blood and saying that is for me you see
[1:17:36] without the Holy Ghost brother Brandon
[1:17:37] will tell us he says without the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost you got a cow inside of the tree
[1:17:42] you remember on top of the tree eating
[1:17:43] apples he says you're going to get your
[1:17:45] picture all messed up he says the word
[1:17:48] is like a jigsaw puzzle he says without
[1:17:50] the Holy Ghost you can't get all the
[1:17:52] pieces lined up but with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:55] all the pieces start to come into place
[1:17:57] and you see brother Brandon would tell
[1:17:59] us this here that's the life that is in
[1:18:01] you speaks from the shed blood amen oh
[1:18:04] brother I wish everybody could see it if
[1:18:07] you can see what it is it's the life
[1:18:09] that's in you see the blood is
[1:18:11] identifying you with it it's the token
[1:18:15] the blood shed for you you've accepted
[1:18:17] it and the life is coming to you that is
[1:18:21] the token yes oh it's identifying you
[1:18:25] with him so whatever the blood speaks
[1:18:27] the token enforces whatever the word
[1:18:30] speaks them the token enforces brother
[1:18:32] Brandon would tell us and he says in
[1:18:34] court whenever the court excuse me
[1:18:38] whenever the whenever the court writes
[1:18:39] out a word and says the penalty is such
[1:18:42] and such or the verdict is such and such
[1:18:45] but the Brandon would say then the law
[1:18:47] of the Court enforces the word of the
[1:18:50] court so there's a power behind it that
[1:18:52] starts to en enforce the word of it and
[1:18:55] when God says something then the Holy
[1:18:58] Ghost enforces it it's not us just
[1:19:00] saying Lord I'm quoting the scripture
[1:19:01] you know I'm quoting the scripture
[1:19:03] nothing takes place it's God coming
[1:19:05] behind the scripture and enforcing it in
[1:19:08] every one of our Lives no matter the
[1:19:10] conditions no matter what the the the
[1:19:12] things around us if the token has been
[1:19:15] applied everything the blood speaks is
[1:19:17] now for us and brother Brandon would say
[1:19:20] this apply the token and claim your
[1:19:22] rights shake it before Satan I just love
[1:19:25] that claim your rights then shake it
[1:19:28] before Satan he would say go when you go
[1:19:30] to prayer Pray with your token up in
[1:19:32] other words that token is a
[1:19:34] representation that your prayers is
[1:19:37] going to the throne of God cuz the devil
[1:19:39] can't get through your token you know
[1:19:41] brother Brandon would say this that the
[1:19:43] devil don't the devil's not how did he
[1:19:45] put up he the devil don't make you do
[1:19:47] anything because if the devil can get
[1:19:49] into you he's got to be baptized he got
[1:19:51] to be he's got to repent be baptized
[1:19:54] then receive the Holy Ghost and then
[1:19:56] he's your brother right he can't get
[1:19:58] through that token he can't get through
[1:20:00] it so whenever you go when you pray when
[1:20:02] you intercede when you come to church
[1:20:05] you've got the token up the devil can't
[1:20:07] get through that token and that's what
[1:20:09] brother Brandon was saying take the
[1:20:11] token apply the token and shake it
[1:20:14] before Satan cuz he cannot get through
[1:20:17] that token oh brother brand I'm G say
[1:20:19] this heal every one of these Lord Heal
[1:20:21] everyone that is setting present that is
[1:20:24] sick who are you sickness who do you who
[1:20:27] do you think you are Satan who do you
[1:20:29] claim to be every claim that you have
[1:20:32] was canceled at Calvary you are a bluff
[1:20:35] you have no rights we defy you in the
[1:20:38] name of Jesus Christ as a holy ghost
[1:20:41] filled body I like how he he he named
[1:20:44] sickness but we can put anything there
[1:20:46] sickness who are you who do you think
[1:20:49] you are Satan who do you claim you see
[1:20:52] just he can only claim he he can only
[1:20:54] come important wishper the Bible will
[1:20:56] tell us he's roaming like a a Roman lion
[1:20:58] seeking whom he made you brother Brandon
[1:21:01] will tell us he's a lion with no teeth
[1:21:03] he can't even get to you who do you
[1:21:05] claim to be every claim that you have
[1:21:08] was cancelled at
[1:21:10] Calvary and we would see before the life
[1:21:12] of the blood the devil had claims on the
[1:21:14] marriages right we're living in a day
[1:21:16] we're living in America there's a high
[1:21:19] percentage of every marriage is eting up
[1:21:21] a divorce there's a high percentage
[1:21:23] whether the te teenagers are upon drugs
[1:21:26] there's a high percentage that that that
[1:21:28] teenagers are going to smoke cigarettes
[1:21:30] it's a claim that the devil has upon
[1:21:32] teenagers upon marriages but the token
[1:21:36] breaks that claim and says no you don't
[1:21:38] got a claim on it I got a claim on him
[1:21:41] and oh my that's a reality not just
[1:21:43] something we can preach about but it's a
[1:21:45] reality that every claim that the devil
[1:21:48] had Upon Our Lives has been broke by the
[1:21:50] brand would say this it speaks of
[1:21:53] resurrection and life it's speaks of
[1:21:55] healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of
[1:21:57] power it speaks of life it speaks of
[1:22:00] Heaven the same blood that was shed upon
[1:22:02] the ground the C out after his dead
[1:22:04] brother or C out after his brother that
[1:22:07] had killed him the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:09] covers all of our sins and speaks peace
[1:22:12] resurrection power life healing all of
[1:22:15] the Redemptive blessings that the blood
[1:22:18] was shed for it speaks for us certainly
[1:22:21] the blood speaks and could you imagine
[1:22:24] being there in Egypt you know judgments
[1:22:25] coming to the city and the Bible would
[1:22:27] tell us and in Exodus 12:23 for the Lord
[1:22:30] will pass through to Smite the Egyptians
[1:22:33] and when he seeth the blood upon the Len
[1:22:35] and on the two sides of the posts the
[1:22:38] Lord will pass over the door and will
[1:22:40] not suffer the Destroyer to come into
[1:22:43] your houses to Smite you the Destroyer
[1:22:46] was coming through the city but because
[1:22:48] of the blood he would not suffer the
[1:22:50] destroying we know the the the Bible
[1:22:52] would tell us that he created the
[1:22:54] blacksmith that he he that creates he
[1:22:57] creates he he created the the the waster
[1:22:59] to destroy so the devil's just a pond in
[1:23:02] his hand right it's that God has given
[1:23:05] the devil permission to come upon the
[1:23:07] Earth and he's going through the Earth
[1:23:08] but the Destroyer cannot come to your
[1:23:10] home when the token's there that's a
[1:23:13] promise we can hang upon you know could
[1:23:15] you imagine being there in Egypt and but
[1:23:16] the Brandon would dramatizing the the
[1:23:19] little boy would come up to Daddy and
[1:23:21] would say daddy my friend just died down
[1:23:22] the road or I hear the script Dre down
[1:23:25] in that house are you sure we're safe
[1:23:27] are you sure we're going to be okay and
[1:23:30] brother brandom you know he tell us they
[1:23:31] would daddy would get the boy would come
[1:23:33] out to the would look out the window and
[1:23:34] say you see the blood right there yes
[1:23:36] you see the blood the Destroyer can't
[1:23:39] come into our homes the Destroyer cannot
[1:23:42] come into our homes because we have the
[1:23:45] token and then that would give an
[1:23:47] assurance to the Next Generation that
[1:23:50] the tokens applied oh we've got
[1:23:52] something we can give to our children
[1:23:54] yeah right we've got say in a day of
[1:23:56] Chaos in a day of negativity there's a
[1:23:59] positive gospel but the brand would say
[1:24:01] it's a positive token it's a positive
[1:24:04] token in the day of negativity there's
[1:24:06] something positive that is going to take
[1:24:09] us through you know brother Brandon
[1:24:11] would preach a message called the
[1:24:12] teaching on Moses and he would talk
[1:24:14] about uh jocked and amram and he would
[1:24:16] say that whenever that whenever the the
[1:24:18] the soldiers were coming up and killing
[1:24:20] all the baby boys right y'all remember
[1:24:22] the story and brother Brandon was say
[1:24:24] that they would come and knock on knock
[1:24:26] on Moses's house and would say we know
[1:24:29] you got a baby in there and Moses
[1:24:31] brother Brandon would say amran would
[1:24:33] say no we don't got one they said oh
[1:24:35] yeah we hear it in there and brother

[1:24:43] a parent we don't have one that you can
[1:24:45] take go to the next house go to the
[1:24:48] neighbor's house but there's nothing I'm
[1:24:50] not going to give it to you brother
[1:24:52] Brandon would say then they would push
[1:24:53] thems and side of the door but there was
[1:24:56] a hiding place that they would put Moses
[1:24:58] that they could not find Moses and oh my
[1:25:01] there's a posi of token there's a hiding
[1:25:04] place there's a sure dwelling place but
[1:25:07] the Bible would tell us it's a Peaceable
[1:25:09] habitation that whenever they come
[1:25:11] against our homes comes against our
[1:25:13] families there's a positive token that
[1:25:16] would say no we've got children but you

[1:25:20] can't have him I've got a daddy but you

[1:25:52] going talk about the rainbow it would
[1:25:54] say God gave a rainbow as a token and he
[1:25:57] would say and God has remembered that
[1:25:59] rainow token and he says it's thousands
[1:26:01] of years later but that that rainbow God
[1:26:03] puts that rainbow there that we can look
[1:26:06] at it and know that God honors his token
[1:26:09] and I just love that because it's a
[1:26:10] natural rainbow a natural symbol but
[1:26:13] what about spiritually if he remembers
[1:26:15] the Earth if he remembers the rainbow
[1:26:17] he's going to remember you and yeah and
[1:26:19] what is so incredible about the rainbow
[1:26:21] when does the rainbow appear in the
[1:26:23] storm yeah just during the lightning or
[1:26:26] the or the the Thunder maybe an
[1:26:28] earthquake or you know whenever whenever

[1:27:27] up you know and then and brother Brandon
[1:27:29] will talk about we talk about Rahab
[1:27:32] would say then we pray we must have the
[1:27:34] token to present with our prayers as I
[1:27:36] said now believe for ourselves and apply
[1:27:39] the token to the whole family like in
[1:27:41] Egypt or Jericho or either in Acts 16-31
[1:27:44] we find out that the Apostle Paul told
[1:27:46] the Romans and Syrian say believe thou
[1:27:49] and On th and all thy house shall be
[1:27:52] saved apply it to your family if you've
[1:27:54] got an unsaved child lay the token right
[1:27:57] on top of him say Lord God I claim him
[1:28:00] stay right there if you got a mother or
[1:28:02] loved one that's lost lay the token on
[1:28:04] them and say God Lord God I lay claim
[1:28:07] upon them present the token with their
[1:28:10] prayers and lay claim upon them it was
[1:28:12] RAB that would say not just for me but
[1:28:15] for my mother not just for my mother but
[1:28:18] for my father and it's so powerful there
[1:28:20] in Joshua 2:12 the Bible would say now
[1:28:23] therefore I pray you swear unto me of
[1:28:25] the Lord since I have showed you
[1:28:27] kindness that you will also show me
[1:28:29] kindness unto my father's house and give
[1:28:32] me a true token a true token I don't
[1:28:36] want to knock off give me a true token
[1:28:39] and the the next verse Joshua 2:13 and
[1:28:42] that you will save aive my father my
[1:28:44] mother my brother my sisters and all
[1:28:48] that they have and deliver our lives
[1:28:50] from Death she did a want some watered
[1:28:53] down religion right come on now she
[1:28:55] didn't want some watered down Religion
[1:28:57] she didn't want just just a sensation or
[1:29:00] or just a or just a tape player she
[1:29:02] wanted a true token oh and I believe
[1:29:05] that's our desire Lord give me a true
[1:29:07] token not just for me but for my loved
[1:29:09] ones for my sons for my daughters for my
[1:29:13] sister and you know why she wanted this
[1:29:15] token because she had already seen the
[1:29:17] supernatural inaction the Bible would
[1:29:19] tell us whenever the spies would go into
[1:29:22] the into Jericho that she would tell
[1:29:25] them we have heard how you did this you
[1:29:27] split the Red Sea how you killed the
[1:29:29] sons of anoch we have heard these things
[1:29:32] and now the are the the the the the men
[1:29:34] of the city their heart is failing them
[1:29:36] now and then she would say give me a
[1:29:38] true token she knew that the same
[1:29:41] Supernatural God that brought him
[1:29:43] through the Red Sea with this true token
[1:29:46] would bring her through every Red Sea
[1:29:48] right oh Hallelujah not just me what
[1:29:50] going to bring my father through every
[1:29:52] Red Sea it was a the token that was
[1:29:55] going to bring her and brother Brandon
[1:29:57] would say in him is all sufficiency that
[1:29:59] we have need of so in this token is
[1:30:02] everything that is going to take us all
[1:30:04] the way through let the musicians come
[1:30:07] tonight it's speaking of it brother
[1:30:09] Brandon would say this the true token of
[1:30:11] the blood speaking out speaks of a
[1:30:14] living resurrected presence of Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ it speaks of a living resurrected
[1:30:20] presence not a presence of yesterday but
[1:30:23] a presence of
[1:30:24] today oh Hallelujah but it's a positive
[1:30:27] token brother Brandon would say there's
[1:30:29] no devil can stand before there's
[1:30:31] nothing can stand before it because God
[1:30:33] has accepted it and if you hold a token
[1:30:36] in your hand the price is paid oh it's a
[1:30:39] positive token it's a positive token you
[1:30:42] know and brother Brandon would talk
[1:30:43] about how Oswald he says could you
[1:30:45] imagine being Oswald sitting in his cell
[1:30:49] knowing you just killed the president
[1:30:51] and he says now there's no attorney that
[1:30:53] going to take your case so there's
[1:30:55] nobody you killed the president all the
[1:30:57] attorneys are mad at you all the the
[1:30:59] crowd is mad at you the the judge is mad
[1:31:02] at you he says nobody's going to take
[1:31:04] your case and then later on in that
[1:31:06] sermon he would say now you're at the C
[1:31:08] you're at the judge you're at the court
[1:31:10] he says you're guilty and you know
[1:31:12] you're guilty the judge knows you're
[1:31:14] guilty the the the the the everybody in
[1:31:17] that courtroom knows you're guilty and
[1:31:19] he says if you're sentenced he says
[1:31:21] you're going to die with a death penalty
[1:31:23] you're going to die be an electric chair
[1:31:25] or whatever it is he says but if you can
[1:31:27] just get an
[1:31:28] attorney he says but when you get that
[1:31:31] attorney he says then you can relax a
[1:31:33] little bit because now somebody's
[1:31:35] speaking for you but he says you can't
[1:31:37] relax all the way because now that
[1:31:39] attorney has to has to convince them
[1:31:42] that you're innocent you know brother
[1:31:44] Brandon would say this that he says now
[1:31:46] that attorney has to get up with all of
[1:31:48] his smarts all of his intellect all of
[1:31:51] his Brilliance and he's got to speak for
[1:31:53] you and that just really spoke to my
[1:31:55] heart he's got to get up and his speech
[1:31:58] his voice has got to outweigh the
[1:32:00] verdict and I thought oh my brother
[1:32:02] Brandon would sa the judge became your
[1:32:04] attorney so it didn't matter what was
[1:32:07] held against you the voice his voice was
[1:32:10] stronger than the condemnation oh
[1:32:13] Hallelujah it was something positive
[1:32:16] that in the midst of the negativity we
[1:32:19] can relax because there was something
[1:32:21] positive the Bible would say we have a a
[1:32:23] more sure word of Prophecy a sure word
[1:32:27] it's something positive it's something
[1:32:29] that when we're in the midst of trouble
[1:32:31] in the midst of negativity the Bible
[1:32:33] would tell us that that the king Bazar
[1:32:35] was troubled youall remember the story
[1:32:38] and his countenance has changed and I
[1:32:40] think my word the Bible would tell us
[1:32:41] we're troubled on every side but yet not
[1:32:44] distressed we're troubled but we're not
[1:32:46] distressed and the Bible says that the
[1:32:48] King was troubled and that troubless was
[1:32:51] changing his countenance and the Bible
[1:32:53] would say say that the king the queen
[1:32:55] his wife would say but husband there's a
[1:32:58] man here that has an excellent spirit
[1:33:00] that can dissolve the doubts and I
[1:33:03] thought my goodness it was a prophet
[1:33:05] brother Brandon must say what is the
[1:33:06] prophet today the Holy Ghost it's an
[1:33:09] excellent spirit that is here Among Us
[1:33:11] that can dissolve the doubts even in the
[1:33:14] troubless even in the troubled hearts
[1:33:16] that's where the devil wants to get us
[1:33:18] is trouble our hearts trouble our
[1:33:20] emotions then that starts to change our
[1:33:22] countenance it starts to change our
[1:33:24] belief system it starts to change you
[1:33:27] know if if you if you look at somebody a
[1:33:29] different way they didn't change but the
[1:33:32] way you see them changes right if I
[1:33:34] didn't know but the Joel too very well
[1:33:36] and somebody came up to me and says you
[1:33:37] know he's got two wives I would say what
[1:33:40] I don't think he does but since I don't
[1:33:42] know him the question's going to be
[1:33:44] there right and even though it's not
[1:33:46] true he didn't Chang but the way I look
[1:33:49] at him changed now I'm going to treat
[1:33:51] him different he's still getting up and
[1:33:53] working normally he's getting up and
[1:33:55] drinking us coffee reg his life didn't
[1:33:57] change but now I'm changing I'm looking
[1:34:00] at him different and if a troubled heart
[1:34:02] can come and get you to look up this
[1:34:04] word differently the word didn't change
[1:34:07] the way you see it has changed but
[1:34:09] there's a spirit Among Us there's a
[1:34:12] genuine holy ghost that can come and and
[1:34:15] heal the troubled heart that can come
[1:34:18] and dissolve the doubts oh brother
[1:34:20] Brandon mat tell us said that our faith
[1:34:22] in the word of God is like a chain and
[1:34:24] it's carrying you over the fires of hell
[1:34:27] and he says that chain is strongest out
[1:34:29] its weakest length and then he would go
[1:34:31] one and he would say if you've got if
[1:34:33] something's puzzling you in the word of
[1:34:35] God and it's qu there's a question there
[1:34:38] he says fortify it don't allow that to
[1:34:41] be a weakness oh my I love that don't
