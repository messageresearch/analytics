[0:00] didn't say go teach he said go preach in
[0:03] other words demonstrate the power and
[0:05] these signs shall follow them just
[0:08] teaching doesn't do it it takes an
[0:09] actual Spirit itself demonstrating these
[0:13] signs listen to this that's your facei
[0:16] should not stand in the wisdom of man
[0:18] but in the power of God oh my see to
[0:23] change the man not in what I can explain
[0:25] away and say he's not the same when he
[0:28] is the same if I do that it's shows to
[0:30] me it it surely a man tell me that would
[0:33] show to me he don't have the Revelation
[0:34] the three-fold revelation of God
[0:37] see now and how be it in weakness among
[0:39] you that are perfect yet we not with the
[0:42] wisdom of the world but of the princes
[0:46] of this world that come to not but we
[0:50] speak the wisdom of God in mystery see
[0:54] the three-fold mystery of God even the
[0:56] hidden wisdom which God ordained
[1:00] before the world unto our
[1:05] Glory which none of the princes of this
[1:09] world knew none of the priests rebi
[1:11] rabbis pardon me or anything knew
[1:13] anything about it for had they known it
[1:17] they would have not crucified the Lord
[1:18] Of Glory you said you're wrong about
[1:20] rabbis and preachers there who crucified
[1:23] him amen oh on and on and on we could go
[1:26] read it on save time cuz we got
[1:30] uh uh just not getting late yet but we
[1:34] just we got plenty here to say if the
[1:35] Lord will help us now lack of this now
[1:39] and Paul this great intellectual man
[1:41] never tried to express his great
[1:43] theological terms upon the people he
[1:46] humbly accepted the word of the Lord and
[1:49] he lived the word so it expressed to he
[1:52] lived so so Godly until they seen Jesus
[1:54] Christ didn't so much so they wanted his
[1:56] handkerchief to take and laid upon the
[1:58] sick
[2:00] there's the Life of Christ now watch
[2:03] some oh you see Elijah done that long
[2:05] time ago lady you stick but oh that was
[2:07] the Days of Elijah now the world thought
[2:10] that the intellectual priests and things
[2:12] in churches of that day thought that but
[2:13] the unbelievers they know different they
[2:16] seen the revelation of Christ that was
[2:17] in Elijah same thing was in Paul
[2:20] expressed the same kind of life because
[2:21] he was a
[2:22] prophet he foretold things that happened
[2:25] exactly the way it was and they know
[2:26] that was God's identification of a
[2:28] prophet and they know he was God's
[2:30] Prophet you couldn't shake him from it
[2:32] at all even when they seen Peter foret
[2:34] tell those things and come to pass they
[2:35] said this let his shadow pass over me
[2:38] amen that's the church that's the ones
[2:41] that believe it yes sir is revealed by
[2:44] why did Paul say because I I got a pH
[2:47] lld D so forth they believe me no he
[2:51] said I forgot all those things of wisdom
[2:53] of Mind said had to die now I know him
[2:55] in the power of his resurrection that's
[2:57] what I come to you at with a
[2:58] demonstration of God God's power what
[3:00] was it making Jesus Christ the same
[3:02] yesterday today and forever the same
[3:04] works that Jesus did Paul did the same
[3:05] and they seen God the great father that
[3:08] had demonstrated in the burning bush had
[3:10] demonstrated to Paul and here it was
[3:11] being demonstrated and he's the same in
[3:13] every age God threefold manner yesterday
[3:16] today and forever what Redeemer in his
[3:19] church pimus in the coming
[3:21] Kingdom amen you see it just as perfect
[3:25] as he can be oh notice the Holy Ghost is
[3:28] the all only revealer of the divine
[3:32] revelation of Christ
[3:35] Hallelujah there's no school can do it
[3:38] no scholar can do it no man how well
[3:41] educated how Godly or anything else is
[3:43] no man can do
[3:47] it I could sting hard here how many
[3:50] Christians Born Again raise up your
[3:52] hands filled the Holy Ghost all right
[3:54] here we go then all right notice and he
[3:57] will only do it to the predestination
[4:03] Hallelujah all the father has given me
[4:06] will come and no man can come except the
[4:08] father's giving him to me
[4:11] first look at that priest said this
[4:13] man's be El he's a fortune teller he's a
[4:15] devil that little old woman walking
[4:17] around there living with six husbands
[4:19] she living with five and had the six one
[4:21] then and Jesus said go get your husband
[4:23] come here she said I have no husband
[4:25] said yes you've got six you've had five
[4:27] and the one you're living with now is
[4:28] not your husband she said sir what that
[4:31] light struck that seed when it struck
[4:33] that priest they said this man is a
[4:35] fortune teller see no Li there hybrid
[4:38] you come up as far as organization but
[4:39] died from their own but This Woman's not
[4:41] a hybrid said sir I perceive I can see a
[4:45] big pretty eyes shine up like that tears
[4:48] running down her cheeks says sir I
[4:50] perceive that you're a prophet I'm
[4:52] looking for a messiah and when that
[4:54] Messiah comes he'll do this very same
[4:56] thing he'll tell us these things he said
[4:58] I'm he oh Lord she left her PO here he
[5:01] is come see a man who's told me the
[5:03] things what was it that light struck
[5:05] that seed that life was there come forth
[5:08] same thing today but the theologians say
[5:11] I wait just a minute I find out it so
[5:13] and so Pastor Moody said
[5:17] or what's Pastor Moody got to do with
[5:19] this this day Pastor Moody lived in his
[5:22] day but not
[5:24] now certainly Luther lived in his day
[5:27] but not in the day of Wesley Wes live in
[5:30] his day not the day of
[5:32] Pentecost Pentecost living their day but
[5:34] they're long way from
[5:36] this we're in the last hour sure there
[5:38] are organizations and Scruples that
[5:40] proves that it's not there the word has
[5:42] never been correctly Vindicated just
[5:44] only in his strength seeds denominations
[5:47] and make denomination put that old gson
[5:49] weed seeds in with that genuine wheat
[5:52] died right out crop went to gson right
[5:55] green brers and nettles Hallelujah see
[5:58] went on back to that it died right out
[6:00] then it broke the field up and started
[6:02] over again planted some real seeds and
[6:03] some of them come up and choked it out
[6:05] but then God said in this last days he'd
[6:08] bring out of people washing his blood
[6:11] and they were predestinated to be there
[6:13] they've got to be there God say and he
[6:16] would reveal and the Very sign I was
[6:19] Malachi 4 and what he would do restore
[6:22] back again Hallelujah bring back in the
[6:25] last days these great things that he
[6:27] promise said bring the Revelation what
[6:28] is what to do Malachi 4 was to bring
[6:31] back the faith of the fathers to the
[6:34] children see that's right bring that
[6:37] same thing the same Pillar of Fire in on
[6:39] the scene the same signs the same
[6:41] wonders the same Jesus making him the
[6:43] same preaching him the same indicating
[6:46] him the same yesterday today and forever
[6:48] I will restore sayth the Lord all the
[6:51] years that the Methodist worm and the
[6:52] caterpillar worm and the Baptist and
[6:54] Catholic and all them worms eat that
[6:56] that Faith down to become a
[6:57] denominational stump where there's no
[6:59] seeds left in there but I will restore
[7:01] again sayith the Lord all the years what
[7:04] all the signs and wonders that they
[7:06] forsaken I'll take it right back to that
[7:08] original tree again and I will restore
[7:10] it sayeth the Lord that Prophet was a
[7:12] Vindicated Prophet his words has to come
[7:15] to
[7:16] pass amen the Holy Ghost alone is a
[7:19] revealer of the divine revelation of
[7:21] Christ and has been in all ages remember
[7:25] all ages who did the word of the Lord
[7:27] come to Prophet alone
[7:30] that's right is that right and the
[7:32] prophet had to be Vindicated first not
[7:35] because he said he was a prophet because
[7:36] he was borned a prophet and proved to be
[7:39] a prophet and everything he said was
[7:41] exactly on the word and come to pass
[7:42] then everything else let go see it was
[7:45] the word of the Lord came only by the
[7:47] Holy Ghost the Bible said the man of old
[7:49] moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the word
[7:53] look John the Baptist would never had
[7:57] known Jesus if it hadn't been for the
[7:59] Holy Ghost pointing him
[8:01] out that
[8:03] right John the Baptist that great
[8:06] prophet that come forth and said this
[8:08] one standing among you right now there
[8:10] an ordinary man standing here somewhere
[8:13] that's the Lamb of
[8:14] God John said that I bore a record I
[8:17] bear a record I saw the spirit of God
[8:20] the Holy Ghost descending from heaven
[8:23] like a dove and it went upon me and a
[8:24] voicey said this is my beloved Son whom
[8:27] I pleas what was it the holy ghost that
[8:29] I'll Point him out that's the only way
[8:31] you know him today only way you'll get
[8:34] the three-fold revelation of God is for
[8:36] the Holy Ghost and the only way it can
[8:37] ever be is you're predestinated to see
[8:40] it if it don't you'll never see it
[8:43] Hallelujah if you're not predestinated
[8:45] to see it you'll never see it CU that
[8:46] light can Flash you'll go away and make
[8:48] fun of it and explain it away with some
[8:50] intellectual conception when the very
[8:52] God himself manifesting himself and
[8:54] proving it see but if it ain't up on you
[8:56] to see it you won't see it God never
[8:58] just said out choose this one choose
[9:00] that one but he knew by his re he could
[9:03] predestinate because he's infinite and
[9:05] he he knows every he's infinite so
[9:06] therefore he knowed everything he know
[9:08] the end he could tell the end from the
[9:09] beginning he's God if he can't do that
[9:11] he's not
[9:12] God yes he's the
[9:15] infinite all right John would have never
[9:18] known him no sir had the Holy Ghost not
[9:20] pourn out see how God hides his mystery
[9:25] to the high educated and everything look
[9:28] every one of them people say and
[9:29] Simplicity reveals it to whom he has
[9:32] predestinated to
[9:34] sit look there other understanding by
[9:37] never even seen the
[9:39] dove they never heard no
[9:42] voice for it was always sent to that
[9:45] predestinated seed predestinated
[9:47] certainly was
[9:49] predestinated Isaiah 712 years before he
[9:52] was born in the spirit raised up out
[9:55] these human senses and said there's a
[9:57] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[9:58] prepare the way the Lord and
[10:00] make isah could see couldn't Malachi see
[10:03] the same thing predated last prophet
[10:06] seing off all the prophets of the Old
[10:08] Testament that man that great prophet
[10:10] stand there at the end of the
[10:12] age he say is predestinated certainly he
[10:16] was Malachi saw him
[10:19] too Jesus said if you can receive it
[10:21] this is he who has spoken of I say My
[10:23] Messenger before my face Malachi 3 to
[10:25] prepare the way before me see sure he
[10:28] was predestinated to see that message no
[10:30] wonder he can look down and see that
[10:31] Dove coming down that light that was in
[10:33] the wilderness with Israel coming moving
[10:35] down the God himself saying this is my
[10:38] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[10:40] in God in man becoming
[10:43] one I bear witness John said I'll beeld
[10:46] him the only begotten of the father amen
[10:48] I'm witness of it amen there you are
[10:53] Hallelujah Simplicity with an old
[10:55] preacher his father his father was a
[10:58] great Theologian you know he come out of
[11:00] a school look like he'd went back to his
[11:01] father's denomination that wouldn't been
[11:03] the will of God when God touched him at
[11:06] his birth back there and he received the
[11:08] Holy Ghost three months before he born
[11:11] Hallelujah yes sir when Mary went up
[11:14] there and little John was six months old
[11:16] in his mother's womb and had never them
[11:17] little muscles had never moved yet and
[11:19] Mary was afraid the little muscles were
[11:21] growing but she couldn't feel no life
[11:23] Elizabeth his mother brother her and
[11:24] when Mary come up and grabbed her and
[11:26] hugged her put her arms laid hands on

[48:34] 1:1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ

[48:45] Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace
[48:49] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[48:51] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[48:53] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[48:56] all all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[48:58] places in
[49:01] Christ excuse me according as he has
[49:03] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[49:05] of the world we should be holy and
[49:07] Without Blame before him in love having
[49:10] predestinated us un the adoption of
[49:13] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[49:17] according to the good pleasure of his
[49:20] will amen God bless you you can be
[49:22] seated we're going to continue on Christ
[49:24] as the mystery of God revealed
[49:28] if you just bear with me tonight I'm
[49:29] just having a little trouble getting
[49:30] started it's like an old truck you know
[49:32] you got to you got to gear up for a
[49:34] while before you can get to running good
[49:37] uh one of the Mysteries that the seventh
[49:39] angel cleared up was
[49:41] predestination and what that is is is
[49:44] God's uh choosing God's election of his
[49:48] people and we know all down through
[49:50] history through church history anyway
[49:53] people have stumbled over that people
[49:55] have struggled with that it's a hard
[49:57] thing even the great scientist Einstein
[50:00] he uh could not understand how a God
[50:04] that was Almighty and created the
[50:06] heavens and the Earth would would also
[50:09] allow Free Will and allow people to do
[50:11] bad things and he couldn't understand
[50:13] that and so he he actually got to a
[50:15] point where he didn't believe in a
[50:17] personal God just a
[50:18] Creator and there have been many people
[50:21] like that but we believe that our
[50:23] God he is the creator he is the one who
[50:27] made the heavens and the Earth but he's
[50:28] also a personal God he's my God how many
[50:31] believe that tonight he's my God he he
[50:35] knows my life he knows all about me so
[50:39] we believe that tonight we believe we're
[50:41] predestined by God we believe there's a
[50:43] bride today that's predestined by God
[50:46] but you had one side that was calvinist
[50:48] and what the Calvinists believe is that
[50:52] everything is pre-ordained I heard a uh
[50:55] a saying they said there were Baptist
[50:57] churches that were so scared of of the
[51:00] non-elect being attracted to their
[51:02] church that they wouldn't even put out a
[51:04] sign because they felt like that uh they
[51:07] could only wanted the elect to come so
[51:10] if you were elect you'd find
[51:12] it I heard of uh of two groups of
[51:15] theologians that got together and they
[51:18] were kind of fussing with one another
[51:20] one group was calvinist the other one
[51:21] was was Armenian and Armenians believe
[51:25] in just free will to the point they
[51:27] don't they don't believe God chooses at
[51:29] all and the Calvinists believe
[51:30] everything's pre-ordained and and so
[51:33] they got to fuss amongst each other and
[51:36] one went off in this little group of
[51:38] Calvinists another went off in a group
[51:39] of Armenians and one guy couldn't decide
[51:43] which way he wanted to go and and so
[51:45] finally he he made up his mind he said
[51:47] I'm going to go over here with the
[51:49] calvinist and he went over with the
[51:51] calvinist and they said what brought you
[51:52] here he saidwell I chose to come here he
[51:54] said they said nope' and you don't
[51:57] belong here said you belong over with
[51:58] that other
[51:59] group so he goes over to the Armenians
[52:02] and he they said what brought you here
[52:04] and he said I was sent they said
[52:07] nope said you don't belong here and uh
[52:11] you know the truth is usually in the
[52:12] middle of the road isn't it and and
[52:15] that's what brother brandham brought us
[52:16] and brother Bram said he was a calvinist
[52:18] so far as Calvin stayed with the Bible
[52:21] so that's what we believe so uh people
[52:24] struggle with that I heard a story just
[52:26] try trying to kind of lighten you up and
[52:28] tonight and but it it illustrates what
[52:30] we're talking about heard a story of a a
[52:32] calvinist father who believed everything
[52:34] was pre-ordained his children would just
[52:36] be pre-ordained even to their job and
[52:39] everything which I believe God uh cares
[52:41] about those things and knows those
[52:42] things but and even ordains those things
[52:45] but he actually uh had it such a radical
[52:49] idea of it that what he did is he when
[52:51] his son got to a certain age he he laid
[52:53] out three things in his house he laid
[52:55] out a Bible
[52:57] because he said well if he chooses the
[52:58] Bible he'll become a preacher and he
[53:00] laid out a bottle of whiskey said if he
[53:03] chooses the bottle of whiskey he'll be a
[53:05] drunkard and uh he laid out uh he laid
[53:08] out uh money he said well if he chooses
[53:10] the money said he'll be a merchant or
[53:13] somebody that a capitalist and so he uh
[53:17] he laid them all out on the table and he
[53:18] went in the kitchen and watched and here
[53:20] come his son he walked out there and
[53:22] first he picks up the money and puts it
[53:23] in his pocket and he walks over and
[53:25] picks up the puts under his arm picks up
[53:27] the whiskey and heads out the
[53:29] door and the man said well he must be a
[53:32] lawyer
[53:37] then going to do all
[53:40] three but I'm so glad we got
[53:43] revelation we can raise our kids and
[53:45] bring them up right we've got a
[53:46] responsibility to do that and yet we
[53:49] believe in a in a God who cares and and
[53:51] has given us our children they're going
[53:53] to be there we believe though both those
[53:56] things are true now uh people struggle
[53:59] with that because they can't comprehend
[54:01] the sovereignty of God Romans 918 tells
[54:05] us therefore hath he Mercy on whom he
[54:07] will have mercy and whom he will he
[54:10] hardens Romans 9:19 th will then say
[54:12] unto me why does he yet find fault in
[54:15] other words if he made me the way I am
[54:17] why does he find fault he said for who
[54:19] has resisted his will he said nay but oh
[54:22] man who art thou that repliest against
[54:25] God other words God he's God for reason
[54:28] he's a sovereign being he he does his
[54:31] own thing as he chooses to do it he said
[54:34] shall the thing formed say to him that
[54:36] formed it why hast Thou made me this so
[54:39] Paul reaches an argument where he's
[54:41] saying he created me he can do with me
[54:44] what he wants because he made me the
[54:48] creator has power over his creation
[54:52] because it belongs to him now he said uh
[54:56] he said hath not the Potter power over
[54:59] the clay of the same lump to make one
[55:02] vessel to honor and another un to
[55:04] dishonor in other words to to make them
[55:06] for different uses uses one that would
[55:08] be put up in the in the house as a
[55:10] vessel of honor and another to be used
[55:13] for a dishonorable purpose now we we we
[55:16] don't like that because we like to
[55:18] maintain the illusion of control in our
[55:22] lives and if you don't think that's true
[55:25] uh you know I I think most every one of
[55:28] us is a backseat driver when somebody
[55:30] else is
[55:31] driving maybe some not as bad as others
[55:34] but my mother is I know and and my wife
[55:37] is too and and I've been driving for
[55:40] Years brother Mark I I've never had a
[55:43] wreck it was my fault I I feel like I'm
[55:46] a pretty good driver but either one of
[55:47] those ladies get in the car and and I
[55:50] don't know anything about driving I
[55:51] can't make it I don't know where the
[55:52] exit is I I don't know how to get back
[55:55] to the house and if it wasn't for them
[55:57] I'd just be driving around in a field
[55:58] with nothing nowhere to go uh but and
[56:03] yet I get along fine when I'm by myself
[56:05] you know but there's a reason that we're
[56:07] like that I'm that way too when someone
[56:09] else is driving you know you you could
[56:11] prove to me that you're a better driver
[56:13] than me have a better record and and
[56:15] just be better about everything that you
[56:17] do uh driving wise you could prove that
[56:20] to me and I'd still feel better if I had
[56:22] my hands on the
[56:24] wheel why is that because we have we
[56:26] like the illusion of control that's why
[56:28] people would rather most people are more
[56:30] scared of airplanes than they are of
[56:32] driving even though driving
[56:33] statistically is proven to kill more
[56:36] people you're more likely to get in an
[56:38] accident but uh of course if you do get
[56:41] an accident in Airplane you're less
[56:42] likely to get out of it
[56:45] but but but that's why we we we like to
[56:48] be we like to have control we like to
[56:50] have our hands on the wheel and you
[56:52] can't do that with God we don't get to
[56:55] control God right you can't control God
[56:58] you can't control the preacher you can't
[57:00] control the church you can't control
[57:02] anything you can't even control your own
[57:04] family right because if you hold them
[57:06] like that you try to make every every
[57:08] decision for them and and everything as
[57:10] they get older they're going to be in a
[57:11] pretty sorry shape eventually they're
[57:14] going to have to you're going to have to
[57:15] trust that God's going to be able to
[57:17] keep that child and to help that child
[57:20] and brother brandom said you got to
[57:21] commit them to
[57:23] God let them go and let God let God do
[57:26] what God does you came out all right and
[57:29] God God had his hand on your life and
[57:31] he's got his hand on their life
[57:34] too but we've got to be able to do that
[57:36] that's tough because we want to be able
[57:38] to control the outcome but we can't
[57:40] control any outcome we we can't even
[57:42] control I could drop dead of a heart
[57:44] attack right now you we can't control
[57:46] that we can't control the outcomes we
[57:49] don't know what tomorrow brings but we
[57:50] know who holds tomorrow and we know he's
[57:53] good isn't he good tonight God is good
[57:56] and if he's good and he loves us and he
[57:58] cares about us then he'll do the right
[58:01] thing no matter what it is that we we
[58:04] are going through now brother brandham
[58:06] says this about about predestination he
[58:09] said since this portion of the word is
[58:12] hard for the human mind to grasp it must
[58:15] be accepted and believed by faith right
[58:18] amen and brother BR makes this argument
[58:20] he says God can do with us what he wants
[58:23] because not only did he create us but he
[58:25] bought CAU Us by his blood we are not
[58:29] our own Romans 14:7 none of us liveth to
[58:32] himself and no man dieth to himself for
[58:36] whether we live we live unto the Lord
[58:38] whether we die we die unto the Lord
[58:40] whether we live therefore or die we are
[58:43] the Lords for to this end Christ both
[58:46] died and Rose and revived that he might
[58:48] be Lord both of the dead and living he
[58:51] bought us with a price we belong to him
[58:56] yes sir now we know that Christ had a
[58:59] right to choose his family and I'm just
[59:01] laying this background as we go into
[59:03] this next part of what brother Bram
[59:04] taught he had a right to choose his
[59:06] family if he's got it he had to choose
[59:09] his family and so he chose us I'm so
[59:11] thankful for that tonight and you ought
[59:13] to believe that's you I believe that's
[59:15] me we know that salvation itself is open
[59:18] to everyone but we were chosen to
[59:20] believe we're of those that Paul talked
[59:22] about in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 he said
[59:25] we're bound to give thanks always to God
[59:27] for you Brethren beloved of the Lord
[59:29] because God has from the beginning
[59:31] chosen you to Salvation through
[59:34] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[59:37] of the truth you've been chosen to do
[59:38] that you say well I just can't seem to
[59:40] make it he chose you to make
[59:43] it so you got to believe
[59:46] that brother bandam says this he said I
[59:48] would be a discouraged man this morning
[59:51] if I didn't believe in the election and
[59:52] calling of God if I thought that this
[59:55] world was left to the outcome of it by
[59:57] the power of man and by the wisdom of
[59:59] man by the big four and the UN who never
[1:00:02] even mentioned God's name I'd be a
[1:00:04] discouraged person but I'm not looking
[1:00:06] to that for the outcome he said I look
[1:00:08] down in the pages of this old book here
[1:00:10] where God wrote it out and everything
[1:00:12] someone say everything everything will
[1:00:14] come out just exactly the way he said it
[1:00:17] and that's all he said so the only thing
[1:00:20] for me to do is not line up with them
[1:00:22] but line up with Calvary line up with
[1:00:24] God line up with his word stay in his
[1:00:26] word he said no matter how much it looks
[1:00:29] like it's going to be that way it's
[1:00:30] going to be the way God intends it to be
[1:00:34] it can't be nothing else for him being
[1:00:36] infinite knew the end from the beginning
[1:00:38] and he makes everything come to his
[1:00:40] Praises right
[1:00:43] amen so we're going to go back to Christ
[1:00:47] is the mystery of God revealed now that
[1:00:49] we've laid that Foundation brother BR
[1:00:52] says
[1:00:53] predestinated there's the mystery
[1:00:56] he said he before Christ or anything
[1:00:59] else was ever on Earth you see his great
[1:01:02] mystery that he chose the
[1:01:06] bride what that means is not that he
[1:01:08] just chose a nameless faceless shapeless
[1:01:13] mass of people that's not what he did he
[1:01:15] chose you brother Joe he chose you
[1:01:18] individually sister Jackie he chose you
[1:01:22] Paul each person here he chose us he
[1:01:26] chose you before the foundation if you
[1:01:28] are the bride he didn't just choose a
[1:01:30] group of people he didn't just choose a
[1:01:33] church age messenger he didn't just
[1:01:35] choose a preacher but he chose you
[1:01:38] because God don't deal with the bride as
[1:01:40] a group he deals with you as
[1:01:43] individuals you believe that tonight and
[1:01:45] so if he deals with you as individuals
[1:01:47] then he chose you to be in that
[1:01:50] bride so you could say this you can take
[1:01:53] this personally he chose the bride
[1:01:57] knowing Eve would
[1:01:59] fall from disbelieving the word knowing
[1:02:03] that she would fall but he would choose
[1:02:05] a bride that would not
[1:02:09] fall now this is really important he he
[1:02:12] chose now we he has a right to choose
[1:02:15] and he chose a bride that would not fall
[1:02:19] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:02:22] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:02:25] say about it didn't matter what they
[1:02:27] said he said he chose the
[1:02:30] bride now and so you say well a bride
[1:02:34] that would not fall how can you do that
[1:02:36] no he's able to do that he's not only
[1:02:39] able but he promised we talked about
[1:02:40] that a couple weeks ago but he's able
[1:02:43] how do we know he's able Jude 24 now
[1:02:45] unto him that is able someone say he's
[1:02:47] able to keep you from falling you don't
[1:02:51] have to fall he's able to keep you from
[1:02:53] falling and to present you what
[1:02:57] faultless before the presence of his
[1:03:00] glory with exceeding Joy you'll find out
[1:03:02] that this this idea of the Bride not
[1:03:05] falling it's not that she's not going to
[1:03:07] fall because she just made up her mind
[1:03:09] not to fall but she's not going to fall
[1:03:11] because he won't let her fall right
[1:03:13] she's not going to fall because he has
[1:03:15] imputed Grace to her that there would
[1:03:17] not be any of it be her own works but it
[1:03:19] would be the grace of almighty God and
[1:03:21] he would not only sin the grace of God
[1:03:23] is Not Just forgiving you and letting
[1:03:25] you get with whatever you want to do but
[1:03:27] the grace of God brings you up into
[1:03:29] sanctification and the power of the
[1:03:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost he chose a
[1:03:33] bride that would be filled with the Holy
[1:03:35] Ghost at the end time he chose a bride
[1:03:38] that would not fall at the end time
[1:03:41] right they would hold to that word amen
[1:03:45] amen and he provided a message in our
[1:03:47] hour I wonder if we really understand
[1:03:50] what God did he provided the opening of
[1:03:52] the word the open book he he that there
[1:03:55] reason why it had to happen in our day
[1:03:58] because the bride that would not fall
[1:04:00] would have to become the full word so
[1:04:03] the full word had to be open before the
[1:04:05] end time and we're living in that day he
[1:04:09] said they would hold to that word they
[1:04:12] are predestinated to stand there so they
[1:04:16] will take a
[1:04:17] stand right it's not that they won't
[1:04:19] take a stand and they'll just make it in
[1:04:21] anyway but they will take a stand
[1:04:25] they're PR predestined to take a stand
[1:04:27] and they will take the right stand at
[1:04:30] the end time they are predestined to
[1:04:32] stand there the adoption of children by
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ that's what you're
[1:04:37] predestinated
[1:04:38] to is the adoption of children what's
[1:04:41] the adoption of children until we become
[1:04:43] Sons and Daughters of God full Sons and
[1:04:45] Daughters of God till we have power and
[1:04:48] authority with God the spoken word
[1:04:50] that's what God showed us was possible
[1:04:52] in our day we have been predestined in
[1:04:55] this day to be the full adopted Sons and
[1:04:59] Daughters of God we've been predestined
[1:05:02] to have the true baptism of the Holy
[1:05:04] Ghost we've been predestined to be to be
[1:05:07] sealed by the token to have be so sealed
[1:05:10] away in god Till the devil don't know
[1:05:12] what to do with
[1:05:14] us and I think I think here's the
[1:05:17] problem it's hard again for us to
[1:05:18] reconcile that and say if I'm a bride
[1:05:20] that won't fall why do I make mistakes
[1:05:22] well he never said you wouldn't make any
[1:05:24] mistakes he just said you wouldn't
[1:05:28] fall he never said you'd be perfect but
[1:05:30] you'd be perfect in his eyes 100%
[1:05:34] perfect in his eyes you may not be
[1:05:36] perfect in anybody else's eyes but
[1:05:38] you're 100% it gives me great hope it
[1:05:41] gives me great peace because I realize
[1:05:43] my shortcomings I I you don't have to
[1:05:45] tell them to me I know people think it's
[1:05:47] their job to tell preachers what the
[1:05:49] shortcomings are you don't have to tell
[1:05:51] me my shortcomings you don't have to
[1:05:52] tell me I'm a human I'm a human brother
[1:05:55] brand was human all of us are humans I I
[1:05:58] know I'm a human but I know that I'll
[1:06:00] make it by the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:06:02] know you're going to make it by the same
[1:06:04] thing I know he he he he's put something
[1:06:07] in me he's called me to stand in this
[1:06:10] hour so I'm going to stand all
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:15] now I got to stand for the word that's
[1:06:18] what he called me to do and so that's
[1:06:21] what we have to do all of us have to do
[1:06:23] that now there would hold to that word
[1:06:26] they're predestined to stand there
[1:06:28] predestined the church that great
[1:06:30] glorious stand I say we ought to stand
[1:06:33] tonight let's just stand on the word if
[1:06:37] God taught it let's just believe it
[1:06:40] let's just stand on it let's not give up
[1:06:42] our morals let's not give up our dress
[1:06:44] let's not give up our worship let's not
[1:06:46] give up our our services we shouldn't
[1:06:48] give one service back to the devil and
[1:06:50] say well just we'll just have a we'll
[1:06:52] just have a regular service tonight
[1:06:54] let's stand on the word of God if he
[1:06:55] said we can have healing let's stand on
[1:06:57] that if he said these signs shall follow
[1:07:00] them that believe let's stand on that
[1:07:02] word believe that word walk into that
[1:07:05] word become that
[1:07:07] word amen let me stand Lord on the
[1:07:12] message of the
[1:07:13] hour hey man listen if your idea today
[1:07:17] is that nobody's right but
[1:07:19] you and I don't I know there's no one
[1:07:22] here that believes that but there's
[1:07:23] people that
[1:07:24] do if you ideas there's no one right but
[1:07:27] you everybody's always always doing the
[1:07:30] wrong thing but you got it right listen
[1:07:32] to me you that's not the kind of bride
[1:07:34] God
[1:07:35] has if your idea is that we're failing
[1:07:38] as the bride that the bride is somehow
[1:07:41] going back to the uh to Pentecostalism
[1:07:44] where somehow we're going some other
[1:07:45] direction that's wrong and and we need
[1:07:48] some Prophet to come along or some
[1:07:50] teacher to come along or some Pastor to
[1:07:52] come along and save us listen if that's
[1:07:54] your idea you don't believe the message
[1:07:56] of the hour because the message of the
[1:07:58] hour taught us we've got everything we
[1:07:59] need to go in a Rapture all we got to do
[1:08:02] is all we got to do is feed on it if you
[1:08:05] believe the Revival is over we're just
[1:08:07] going to go in by the skin of our teeth
[1:08:09] you don't believe what a prophet taught
[1:08:11] because he said he's predestined the
[1:08:13] bride to that great glorious stand not
[1:08:16] just predestinated to be there but
[1:08:18] predestinated to stand yeah right oh I
[1:08:22] hope you're hearing me tonight yes amen
[1:08:28] now listen we're not going to get in by
[1:08:30] the skin of our teeth look at Revelation
[1:08:33] 19:7 said let us be glad and
[1:08:36] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:08:38] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:08:41] wife ha made
[1:08:44] herself
[1:08:47] ready she not waiting on somebody else
[1:08:50] to come along and provide she's already
[1:08:52] been provided what she has need of in
[1:08:55] this house to make herself ready brother
[1:08:57] Jeremy she's putting on her
[1:08:59] clothes she's going to do it she's going
[1:09:01] to do it when you said but every other
[1:09:03] age failed this one won't right right if
[1:09:06] it did we wouldn't be the the me it
[1:09:09] wouldn't be the message it wouldn't be
[1:09:10] the truth it wouldn't be the end times
[1:09:12] it wouldn't be the there'd have to be
[1:09:13] another age coming but there's not
[1:09:15] another age coming this is it so we've
[1:09:18] got to make it without us they can't be
[1:09:21] made perfect but I'm so glad he sent a
[1:09:23] power he sent an anointing he sent a
[1:09:25] word in our day that we can make
[1:09:29] it now now see we we've got to he said
[1:09:32] let's be glad and give honor to him for
[1:09:34] the marriage of the Lamb is coming his
[1:09:35] wife is ready she has made herself ready
[1:09:39] Welly that's a that's a miracle in
[1:09:41] itself you ever been to a wedding I'm
[1:09:43] sure most of us have the bride's never
[1:09:45] ready on
[1:09:46] time but this bride will
[1:09:50] be that's what he's announcing the
[1:09:53] marriage of the Lamb is come
[1:09:55] and the bride's
[1:09:57] ready glory to
[1:09:59] God you said well I don't know I I don't
[1:10:02] know if I'll be ready by The Rapture you
[1:10:04] if you're the bride you will
[1:10:06] be you can't help but be why because the
[1:10:10] she was ready at the time of the wedding
[1:10:13] that's amen the time of the marriage
[1:10:16] supper when when we go to meet him in
[1:10:18] the air we'll be ready don't you doubt
[1:10:20] it one minute now look R said now you
[1:10:24] see his secret
[1:11:25] made himself a
[1:11:27] wife amen he made Adam a wife oh my and
[1:11:31] so now watch what he says he said took
[1:11:33] the rib from under his side and made Eve
[1:11:36] out of it so God did the same thing
[1:11:39] taking out of the side of Christ the
[1:11:42] blood and the water now watch Christ the
[1:11:47] word was made up of three elements water
[1:11:50] blood and spirit he was made up of water
[1:11:52] blood and spirit which is the type of
[1:11:54] the new birth
[1:11:55] and he takes out of his side there on
[1:11:58] the cross on Calvary he takes out of his
[1:12:01] side the blood and the water and the
[1:12:03] spirit he gave up the ghost now he said
[1:12:06] Christ is the word taking the word and
[1:12:09] making up his church Eve he said back to
[1:12:13] himself again Redeemed by the blood that
[1:12:16] was come from his
[1:12:18] body now watch Eve was already taken out
[1:12:22] and then she fell but this bride
[1:12:26] remained in him until she was
[1:12:32] redeemed it's how to make us run all
[1:12:34] over the
[1:12:35] church think about this nobody else
[1:12:37] taught us this this was a prophet to the
[1:12:39] age taught us this this bride remained
[1:12:42] in
[1:12:43] him when he healed the sick when he
[1:12:45] raised the Dead when he did the Wonders
[1:12:47] she was in him good and then he pulled
[1:12:50] her out at Calvary after he
[1:12:53] died amen
[1:12:55] and what's the significance of that is
[1:12:57] because she was already
[1:13:00] redeemed you said how could she fall
[1:13:02] she's already been
[1:13:05] redeemed amen that's why God could wink
[1:13:08] at ignorance that's why even there will
[1:13:09] be bride from the church ages even
[1:13:12] believed in the Trinity and things like
[1:13:14] that how could God do that she was
[1:13:15] already redeemed in his body and as long
[1:13:18] as the body reaches its fullness in this
[1:13:20] hour it redeems all of
[1:13:23] it GL to God
[1:13:26] amen he he she was brought back to him
[1:13:30] Redeemed by the blood that come from his
[1:13:31] body sir Hallelujah let's read it John
[1:13:34] CH chapter 19 I just want us to get this
[1:13:37] get this down tonight we won't move very
[1:13:40] far in this sermon but it just means
[1:13:42] something to me John 19:30 when Jesus
[1:13:46] therefore had received the vinegar he
[1:13:48] said it is finished and he bowed his
[1:13:50] head and gave up the ghost there's a
[1:13:52] spirit the Jews therefore because of was
[1:13:55] the preparation the body should not
[1:13:57] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day
[1:13:59] for that Sabbath day was a high day
[1:14:02] besought pilot that their legs might be
[1:14:04] broken that they might be taken away
[1:14:07] remember the word says not one bone will
[1:14:09] be broken he said then come the soldiers
[1:14:12] and break the legs of the
[1:14:13] first and of the other which was
[1:14:15] crucified with him so they went from one
[1:14:18] side broke his legs went to the other
[1:14:20] broke his
[1:14:23] legs but when when they came to Jesus
[1:14:26] and saw that he was dead already they
[1:14:29] break not his legs but one of the
[1:14:31] soldiers with a spear pierced his side
[1:14:35] and forth with came there out blood and
[1:14:40] water brother BR said when they killed
[1:14:42] Jesus At The Cross the substance come
[1:14:44] from his body to make up the birth they
[1:14:48] struck his side blood and water you
[1:14:51] realize you've been predestined to a new
[1:14:53] birth because that's what come out of
[1:14:55] his side he said blood and water come
[1:14:57] out and into thy hands I commend my
[1:14:59] spirit what came from his body was water
[1:15:02] blood and spirit now you can type that
[1:15:05] in his body was Luther Wesley
[1:15:09] Pentecost and the fullness right so that
[1:15:12] was in his
[1:15:13] body oh my a and that was what his
[1:15:17] that's what come out of his body to make
[1:15:19] up the bride now watch Eve was born as
[1:15:23] we said from Adam's pierced
[1:15:26] side and brother said when Jesus died at
[1:15:29] Calvary remember the bride was not taken
[1:15:31] from the body until the body was dead he
[1:15:35] had already died and they was going to
[1:15:38] break his legs and the prophet said
[1:15:39] there will not be one bone broken so
[1:15:41] they done draw back the hammer to break
[1:15:42] a leg and a man went up with a spear and
[1:15:44] pushed it through his heart and water
[1:15:47] and blood came forth you realize where
[1:15:48] you came from if you're the bride you
[1:15:50] realize where you came from you come out
[1:15:52] of his heart how could could you be lost
[1:15:55] how could you you said well I'm worried
[1:15:57] I'll be lost I'm worried some man will
[1:15:58] deceive me I'm worried some man will
[1:16:00] mistreat me and and that'll make me
[1:16:02] that'll make me where I'm lost no no you
[1:16:04] can't be lost you come out of his
[1:16:08] heart oh church he come out we come out
[1:16:12] of his heart he said he said he pushed
[1:16:14] it through his heart water and Blood
[1:16:15] come forth he was already dead he said
[1:16:18] she that's us was already redeemed in
[1:16:22] the body by his death yeah that's why we
[1:16:26] there's no more suffering tribulation
[1:16:27] period for the bride all these people
[1:16:30] looking for a squeeze to come and
[1:16:31] everything's going to get shut down
[1:16:33] we're all going to suffer he said there
[1:16:34] will be no more suffering tribulation
[1:16:36] for the bride why because we come out of
[1:16:39] his heart we've oh my we suffered with
[1:16:43] him we before we were before we ever
[1:16:46] came on the earth we were already
[1:16:48] redeemed in him right
[1:16:52] Hallelujah he we were redeemed in his
[1:16:54] mind before the foundation of the Earth
[1:16:56] but we were physically
[1:16:57] redeemed in him on the cross
[1:17:02] sir that's why Adam couldn't redeem
[1:17:06] Eve are you with me now because he
[1:17:09] couldn't he couldn't go back she'd
[1:17:10] already sinned and he couldn't keep her
[1:17:14] before you ever
[1:17:16] sinned amen he already redeemed you and
[1:17:20] took you from his side right Hallelujah
[1:17:24] right
[1:17:25] I I think if we get a revelation of that
[1:17:28] we'd never worry
[1:17:30] anymore if I Come From The Heart Of God
[1:17:34] what could possibly come against me that
[1:17:38] could separate me from
[1:17:41] him it wasn't a drop of his blood that
[1:17:43] was
[1:17:44] wasted wasn't one bit of that water that
[1:17:47] was wasted wasn't one bit of that spirit
[1:17:49] that was wasted if you have the baptism
[1:17:51] of the Holy Ghost today in this hour you
[1:17:54] have a seal from God you're going to
[1:17:56] make it sir and you can't possibly not
[1:17:58] make it because you're part of
[1:18:01] him I just love that now now again so
[1:18:05] brother Brenham picks up in Christ's the
[1:18:07] mystery he said God's great mystery now
[1:18:09] being unfolded that's been hid since the
[1:18:11] foundation of the world it was hid in
[1:18:15] him amen but prefigured it all the way
[1:18:18] down through he said now down Through
[1:18:20] the Ages he's been slowly unfolding this
[1:18:23] mystery he said can you see now what
[1:18:26] happened in the prefigure he he opened
[1:18:28] Adam as side took part of his flesh
[1:18:30] which was Adam to make Eve he said the
[1:18:32] bride has to be the word for he is the
[1:18:35] word she cannot stand on Creeds she
[1:18:38] cannot stand on denomination now he said
[1:18:40] you're predestined to the stand but
[1:18:42] here's what you stand on she has to she
[1:18:45] cannot stand listen on good behavior
[1:18:49] right right right I I'm not going to
[1:18:52] make it because of my behavior
[1:18:55] right good behavior comes because I've
[1:18:58] been redeemed in him but it's I'm not
[1:19:01] going to make it based on my good
[1:19:02] behavior it's not what I stand on I
[1:19:04] don't stand on on visions and dreams I
[1:19:06] don't stand on what somebody said I
[1:19:08] don't stand on somebody else's word I
[1:19:10] stand on the word of God as the bride
[1:19:13] we've got to stand on the word of God
[1:19:15] and that
[1:19:16] alone we we're we're we're not healed
[1:19:19] because somebody said you're healed or
[1:19:21] some we went through some prayer line
[1:19:23] that's good to go through the prayer
[1:19:24] line increases our faith but we're not
[1:19:26] healed because somebody said we're
[1:19:27] healed in the prayer line or we got some
[1:19:29] word of knowledge or something else
[1:19:30] we're healed because the Bible says
[1:19:32] we're healed by his stripes we are
[1:19:36] healed we're saved because he said we
[1:19:38] were saved right not because anyone else
[1:19:41] told us we
[1:19:42] were we could we could mimic being
[1:19:46] saved assimilate with other believers
[1:19:48] and just act like everybody else and say
[1:19:50] well I'm saved but if he ever says we're
[1:19:52] saved if we can ever get a revelation
[1:19:55] what
[1:20:01] he preach my
[1:20:06] batteries hey man we'll just keep going
[1:20:08] through mics till we find one that
[1:20:11] works look she's part of it she was
[1:20:14] taken from
[1:20:16] Christ I love she
[1:20:23] has
[1:20:28] see if this one's got any battery in
[1:20:30] it
[1:20:32] see it tells me how much when I turn it
[1:20:35] on three hours is that
[1:20:37] enough all right that'll be good
[1:20:42] brother see we don't stand on good
[1:20:44] behavior do
[1:20:46] we she can't stand on good behavior she
[1:20:49] has to stand alone on the word because
[1:20:51] she's part of it sounds better anyway
[1:20:53] she was taken from Christ
[1:20:55] and and this is where legalists get so
[1:20:56] confused because they're looking at
[1:20:59] Behavior not looking at the promise
[1:21:02] right we're looking at the behavior of
[1:21:03] the church or the behavior of the
[1:21:05] preacher or our own behavior that's not
[1:21:08] what we look at we look at the promise
[1:21:10] because if you can ever look just
[1:21:11] squarely at the promise your behavior
[1:21:13] will change it'll follow that and so he
[1:21:17] said to be sure he said that the whole
[1:21:19] Rapture amen the whole Rapture now
[1:21:23] Luther was a part Wesley was apart the
[1:21:26] prophets was apart he said just in the
[1:21:29] Revelation that they was making up the
[1:21:31] body feet toes arms and so forth until
[1:21:34] the head he said which we get to that in
[1:21:35] a few minutes he said that makes the
[1:21:37] entire Rapture he said it's the body of
[1:21:41] the word which is Christ it's the body
[1:21:45] of the word which is Christ he said
[1:21:47] outside of that you're lost he said I
[1:21:50] don't care how good you are what your
[1:21:51] relationship is what your fellowship is
[1:21:54] what your organization is you're lost
[1:21:56] outside of that word being in you he
[1:21:59] said if you abide in me the word my word
[1:22:01] abides in you he said then you ask what
[1:22:03] you will because you and the word are
[1:22:05] the same he has the pinenes he's got the
[1:22:08] rulership you're a prisoner to him we
[1:22:10] talked about that last week the world is
[1:22:12] dead you have nothing more he said you
[1:22:14] see the rest of the people living the
[1:22:16] way they do but yet you do not do it why
[1:22:18] you're a prisoner you're Yol to him and
[1:22:21] he said my yoke is easy how many believe
[1:22:24] that tonight
[1:22:25] my yoke is easy yolked with Christ with
[1:22:27] his word he said I do only that which
[1:22:29] pleases the father and if you can't
[1:22:31] believe that I am he then believe the
[1:22:34] word amen so we are the word because we
[1:22:37] come out of the word right just like he
[1:22:42] divided we're not him because that
[1:22:44] masculine part that type was left in him
[1:22:48] we are if we could say it that way the
[1:22:50] feminist spirit of God the bride part of
[1:22:54] God
[1:22:55] but it's still part of
[1:22:56] God does that make sense to everybody so
[1:22:59] you can't be lost if you if you're one
[1:23:03] that was there now now
[1:23:06] look how do we know that how do we know
[1:23:08] that I'm going to stop in Christ's
[1:23:10] minster of God revealed now and just
[1:23:12] dwell in this for just a minute how how
[1:23:15] does that word live how do we know that
[1:23:16] we become the word well by the the token
[1:23:18] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost 1
[1:23:21] Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to
[1:23:23] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:23:25] spirit of God call it Jesus a cursed no
[1:23:28] man can say that Jesus is the Lord but
[1:23:30] by the Holy Ghost so we must have the
[1:23:32] token in order to say that we're part of
[1:23:36] that bride body brother R said the token
[1:23:39] for the believer today everybody want to
[1:23:41] hear what the token for the believer
[1:23:43] today is I know people say well it's a
[1:23:46] tape or or it's a certain Doctrine but
[1:23:48] that's not what a prophet said it was
[1:23:50] the token for the believer today is the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost
[1:23:55] not a blood you say well they got the
[1:23:58] Holy Ghost in Luther's time Wesley's
[1:23:59] time P yes they did but now that the
[1:24:02] fullness of the word has come the token
[1:24:05] for today is the Holy Ghost not a blood
[1:24:08] a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of
[1:24:10] God that is the token that God requires
[1:24:14] of the church today right that's what he
[1:24:17] requires that's that's how you know
[1:24:19] you're in that bride body is by the Holy
[1:24:21] Ghost he said God must see this token he
[1:24:24] must see it in every one of us and so
[1:24:28] we've been predestined to receive the
[1:24:30] token can we say it that way if we've
[1:24:32] been predestined to make it if we've
[1:24:34] been predestined to be part of that
[1:24:36] bride we've been predestined to receive
[1:24:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say
[1:24:39] well I'm I'm afraid he won't give it to
[1:24:41] me I'm afraid he'll hold it from me for
[1:24:43] some reason because of my pastor or
[1:24:44] something no you've been predestined to
[1:24:47] receive it you've been predestined to
[1:24:49] the adoption of children you've been
[1:24:50] predestined to the Token you've been
[1:24:52] predestined to believe the message of
[1:24:54] the hour you say what happens if I
[1:24:55] believe it for a long time and then I
[1:24:56] leave no you've been predestined not to
[1:24:58] fall right right and others may be able
[1:25:02] to maybe they weren't predestined but
[1:25:03] you've been predestined not to
[1:25:07] fall Hallelujah you you might fail even
[1:25:09] in your flesh but you can't leave that
[1:25:11] message why you were predestined to that
[1:25:13] stand you're
[1:25:15] taking amen
[1:25:19] now we find in Moses time there was a
[1:25:21] predestined group that come under the
[1:25:23] token pred destined Moses with a message
[1:25:25] to deliver the people and he
[1:25:26] predestinated the people to be delivered
[1:25:28] by that message and under that token
[1:25:31] they were seated in Heavenly places and
[1:25:33] we're coming around to where we started
[1:25:35] in Ephesians 1 nothing could harm them
[1:25:38] not even death itself why they were
[1:25:40] under the token they were under the
[1:25:41] token for the age which is the holy
[1:25:43] spirit Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God
[1:25:46] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:25:48] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:25:49] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:25:52] so this is where in our position in
[1:25:55] Heavenly places this is where we're
[1:25:57] seated today brother B said that's
[1:25:58] currently that's right now that's not a
[1:26:01] future State that's a current condition
[1:26:04] yes brother BR said the word was made
[1:26:06] flesh yeah therefore you walked with him
[1:26:10] yes when you were in him Hallelujah when
[1:26:13] he was on the
[1:26:15] earth what a wonderful what a wonderful
[1:26:17] Revelation the word was made flesh
[1:26:20] therefore you walked with him when you
[1:26:22] were in him when he he was on the earth
[1:26:26] I I think this time of year ought to
[1:26:27] mean something to us church right
[1:26:29] because listen what he says he said you
[1:26:32] suffered with him right you died with
[1:26:35] him you was buried with him and now you
[1:26:38] are risen with him and manifested
[1:26:42] attributes of God sitting in Heavenly
[1:26:44] places already raised resurrected to New
[1:26:47] Life and sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:26:49] Christ Jesus how could you fall you were
[1:26:52] in him then that's right you were in him
[1:26:55] when he raised the dead you were in him
[1:26:57] when he healed the sick you were in him
[1:26:58] when he died when he was buried when he
[1:27:01] raised again you were in him then then
[1:27:04] he sent back his Spirit on the day of
[1:27:06] Pentecost look he has blessed us in
[1:27:10] Christ you are
[1:27:12] blessed I know that's hard for us
[1:27:14] Brother wendle last year remember the
[1:27:15] sermon Friday night and brother wendle
[1:27:18] was struggling brother window Martin was
[1:27:19] struggling with his health and he's
[1:27:21] recovered since but but he was they
[1:27:23] didn't know whether it was heart trouble
[1:27:24] or something like that he was having
[1:27:25] heart uh chest pains and he was
[1:27:28] struggling when he was preaching that
[1:27:29] but he preached a sermon called I we are
[1:27:31] blessed you are blessed you just kept
[1:27:34] repeating that over and over we're
[1:27:36] blessed and I well well that's simple
[1:27:38] you go to a message meeting and hear
[1:27:40] we're blessed but do you realize that's
[1:27:42] what we actually are yeah every one of
[1:27:45] us are you say well I lost my dog today
[1:27:47] you're
[1:27:49] blessed right maybe something far worse
[1:27:52] than that but you're blessed you may
[1:27:54] lost some money you may you may not be
[1:27:56] able to make ends meat but you're
[1:27:58] blessed said but brother Ben I don't
[1:28:00] understand if I was blessed I'd have a
[1:28:01] better job if I was know you're blessed
[1:28:03] right now because you're not looking to
[1:28:06] material things you're looking beyond
[1:28:07] that you're looking to the Unseen you're
[1:28:09] blessed you're seated in Heavenly places
[1:28:12] you are so blessed that all things
[1:28:16] someone say all things work together for
[1:28:19] good to them that love God I believe
[1:28:21] that's me I know I love him brother Paul
[1:28:23] I may not perfect but I know I love him
[1:28:26] and those that love God are blessed all
[1:28:28] things work together for them for good
[1:28:30] to them that love God to them were the
[1:28:32] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:28:34] he did Forno he also did predestinate to
[1:28:37] be conformed to the image of his son
[1:28:39] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:28:41] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:28:43] predestinate them he also called whom he
[1:28:45] called are you seeing your own name
[1:28:47] there whom he called them he also
[1:28:49] Justified whom he justified them he also
[1:28:52] glorified what shall we then say to
[1:28:55] these things not to pick on brother wle
[1:28:58] again but he's always saying what can we
[1:28:59] say about the service tonight well what
[1:29:02] shall we say then to these
[1:29:05] things if God be for
[1:29:09] us oh I love that watch we we could end
[1:29:13] every sermon with
[1:29:15] that if it was on if it was correction
[1:29:17] if it was on the Holy Ghost if it was on
[1:29:19] whatever it was what shall we then say
[1:29:21] to these
[1:29:23] things we we can end every every tape we
[1:29:25] listen to every time we read our Bible
[1:29:27] what shall we then say to these things
[1:29:29] if God before us who can be against
[1:29:35] us verse 32 he that spared not his own
[1:29:38] son but delivered him up for us all how
[1:29:41] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:29:44] us someone say all things I know we've
[1:29:47] read this many times before but just
[1:29:49] think about it in the context we come
[1:29:51] out of his body we were sep separated
[1:29:54] from his side we were in him oh my who
[1:29:58] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:30:01] God's
[1:30:02] elect we were justified in
[1:30:05] him Amen to charge the bride would be to
[1:30:10] charge
[1:30:11] God would be to charge Christ himself
[1:30:16] because we come out of his side who is
[1:30:19] he that condemneth it's Christ that died
[1:30:23] yeah rather that is risen again who is
[1:30:25] even at the right hand of God who also
[1:30:28] maketh intercession for us you say well
[1:30:31] this this all means that if I'm Gods
[1:30:33] I'll never make any mistakes what who's
[1:30:34] he making intercession for
[1:30:41] then why why is he the advocate today
[1:30:45] why does that body and I know it's a
[1:30:47] very literal way of looking at it but
[1:30:48] why is that body laying on the altar in
[1:30:53] heaven
[1:30:54] if we don't need it
[1:30:57] sometimes amen oh we absolutely need it
[1:31:00] right we absolutely need it CU we make
[1:31:03] mistakes we make mistakes but he makes
[1:31:05] intercession for us who shall separate
[1:31:08] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:31:12] tribulation no distress no persecution
[1:31:16] no we we should answer these questions
[1:31:19] who shall separate us famine nakedness
[1:31:22] Peril sword yeah as it is written for
[1:31:26] thy sake we are killed all the day long
[1:31:28] we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:31:30] slaughter he said yes you're going to be
[1:31:31] picked out for
[1:31:33] persecution you're going to be picked on
[1:31:36] but the fix is already in you're going
[1:31:37] to win in the
[1:31:39] end you might get all the way down I
[1:31:41] play chess and sometimes what I hate the
[1:31:44] most is playing a really good player and
[1:31:46] getting an advantage over him but
[1:31:48] knowing he's going to find a way to get
[1:31:51] me in the
[1:31:52] end because I'm just not that good so if
[1:31:56] you're playing a highly rated player
[1:31:58] they just have a way and I've watched I
[1:32:01] don't know if you've ever heard of
[1:32:02] Magnus Carlson he's a great chess
[1:32:04] Grandmaster he's a young man still but
[1:32:06] he's a Grandmaster maybe the best chess
[1:32:08] player that ever lived and he don't even
[1:32:10] care if he has an advantage he don't
[1:32:14] even care if you get him down by three
[1:32:16] or four pieces or so many points he
[1:32:18] doesn't even care because he knows Oh my
[1:32:21] he has confidence in his skill that he
[1:32:23] knows what the end of that game is like
[1:32:25] he's already programmed it in his brain
[1:32:28] which is a higher programming ability
[1:32:30] than even a computer he's already
[1:32:32] programmed what it's going to be oh my
[1:32:34] if we can only understand it's already
[1:32:36] been programmed what it's going to be we
[1:32:38] already know what the end is it may look
[1:32:40] like we're down it may look like you're
[1:32:42] down a few pawns and and a couple Rooks
[1:32:44] and a few Bishops but you got to
[1:32:46] understand it may look like we're down a
[1:32:48] few churches and a few preachers and and
[1:32:50] and a few people but just remember the
[1:32:52] end the fix is in yes sir the great mind
[1:32:56] that that did all of this he already
[1:32:58] knows what the end's going to
[1:32:59] be we're counted as sheep for the slauer
[1:33:02] sure we're going to have
[1:33:03] persecution nay in all these things we
[1:33:06] are more than
[1:33:08] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:33:11] I am persuaded neither
[1:33:14] death nor life nor angels or
[1:33:20] principalities no devil no demon
[1:33:24] no
[1:33:25] government nor
[1:33:27] powers nor things present he said things
[1:33:30] that exist now or things that will exist
[1:33:33] in the
[1:33:34] future Hallelujah you say well Co God
[1:33:37] didn't know about co co was new and so
[1:33:40] he's been trying to catch up no he knew
[1:33:42] about
[1:33:43] Co that falls under those things to
[1:33:46] come right the internet that fell under
[1:33:48] those things to
[1:33:50] come right all the things we deal with
[1:33:52] today God already knew about it but none
[1:33:55] of these things amen like Paul said none
[1:33:57] of these things move me nor things
[1:34:00] present nor things to come nor height
[1:34:02] nor dep nor any other creature shall be
[1:34:05] able to separate us from the love of God
[1:34:07] which is in Christ Jesus our lord why
[1:34:09] because we come out of his body we were
[1:34:12] in him and he we were separated from him
[1:34:16] but we're going back his great purpose
[1:34:18] is to bring us back into fellowship with
[1:34:20] him
[1:34:22] again so
[1:34:24] you realize then
[1:34:26] that you
[1:34:28] know I'm closing in just a moment but we
[1:34:32] can't be
[1:34:33] judged right we don't go to the white
[1:34:35] Throne judgment right we go to we go to
[1:34:39] the marriage supper and then we sit in
[1:34:41] the white Throne
[1:34:43] judgment right now how how is that
[1:34:45] possible how is that possible because
[1:34:48] I'm part of his
[1:34:50] body and the token in my life is proof
[1:34:54] of
[1:34:55] that it's proof of that that's why Satan
[1:34:58] wants to fight you so hard on whether or
[1:35:00] not you're saved whether or not you have
[1:35:02] the Holy Ghost right you noticed how
[1:35:04] hard he fights you on that some of you
[1:35:06] mature Christians you've been around for
[1:35:07] a long time and the devil's fought you
[1:35:09] for years right whether or not you had
[1:35:12] the Holy Ghost right
[1:35:15] right why did he why does he fight you
[1:35:17] on that yet you can look back at your
[1:35:19] life and see my life changed things are
[1:35:21] different now than they used to be right
[1:35:23] why does he fight you on that because he
[1:35:26] knows if you ever recognize who you are
[1:35:29] but the B said when the bride realizes
[1:35:30] who she is the rapture will
[1:35:33] go amen oh oh listen to me Church you
[1:35:37] you cannot be judged your your sins were
[1:35:39] already judged in that
[1:35:42] body you were part of him and the token
[1:35:45] that you have today the holy spirit in
[1:35:46] your life is proof of
[1:35:48] that say God help us God help us and
[1:35:52] said Lord I I want you to reveal that to
[1:35:54] me I want to have that so deep in my
[1:35:55] heart I know that nothing can remove me
[1:35:59] from the love of God would you stand
[1:36:01] with me musics go ahead and come I want
[1:36:04] to I want to try to sing that song he
[1:36:07] knew me yet he loved me for the joke
[1:36:08] could help me tonight you believe he he
[1:36:11] knew
[1:36:12] you you believe you were in him yes do
[1:36:15] you do we really believe that that means
[1:36:18] I if I'm a part of that I cannot come
[1:36:22] into condemnation there is therefore now
[1:36:25] no condemnation to them who are in
[1:36:28] Christ amen who are in Christ we are not
[1:36:32] only fellowshipping with Christ we're
[1:36:34] not only feeling his presence but we're
[1:36:37] in Christ in in a spiritual sense we are
[1:36:41] his
[1:36:42] body and even though we made mistakes
[1:36:45] and even though we failed and even
[1:36:47] though everything seemed like it was had
[1:36:49] gone wrong but yet he knew me but he
[1:36:52] loved me anyway
[1:36:54] I was a part of him he knew every
[1:36:56] mistake that I would ever make but I'm
[1:36:58] part of him he knew that I would doubt
[1:37:01] he knew that at times I'd make stupid
[1:37:03] mistakes but he loved me anyway and I'm
