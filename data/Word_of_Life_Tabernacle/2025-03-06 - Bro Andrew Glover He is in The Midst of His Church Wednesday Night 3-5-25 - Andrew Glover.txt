do we have here tonight amen there's one thing we know that amen when a Believer touches him that's a different kind of touch amen I every time we hear that song sung We can't help but think of the uh woman there with the issue of blood the prophet of God said he said there were many touching her touching him that day he said but when she touched him he said it was a different touch he said because he felt virtue leave his body and amen tonight I believe we have him right here in our midst tonight and amen whatever the need may be amen he's able to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities

buy our hearts for a word of prayer how many just say Lord on this Wednesday evening would you just come by my way and a special away and speak to me amen I know he sees the desires of our heart Heavenly Father Lord as these Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday evening father lord I can't help but think on these evening Services Lord how that it was in the Garden of Eden when you would come down in the cool of the evening and Lord you would speak lip to ear to your children Lord your Prophet said how that you would come down and you would ask them maybe how they enjoyed their stay on Earth that day and Lord how things are going and father Lord there you would commun with them and they would commune with you now father as We Gather here tonight in a few moments we're going to open your word and we're going to Endeavor to say something of life and of truth that would be a help to these people Lord may it be more than just them hearing me speak but may you move me away Lord may you push me aside as it were Lord and may you come down and oh God may you take preeminence Among Us may it be you speaking Lord Through Me Lord may it be you hearing through them oh God and Lord you see the needs of your children may sicknesses Lord discouragements father Lord whatever the needs are we know you're still the way maker Lord You're Still The Miracle Worker so father we invite you come among us tonight in a special way and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings Lord and Lord our sins and unbelief oh God may you wash us tonight by your word that Lord when we would leave this place we' be transformed by Your Word in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen we want to go to the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter The Book of Matthew the 18th chapter and then we're going to go to the book of Hebrews chapter 2 amen I don't know if in this ear monitor you could take a little the Lowe's out and put some more the highs in it's real muffled in my ear but here in the Book of Matthew the 18th chapter and the 19th verse uh Jesus here speaking he says again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them I want you to notice this where two or three are gathered together in my name now not now watch what he says there am I in the midst of them amen so his name is actually bringing his presence into the mid of two or three who are gathered in his name now in the book of Hebrews the 2 chapter amen that's a lot better thank you buddy Hebrews chapter 2 and we want to read there in the ninth verse Hebrews 2 and verse 9 he says Paul here writing says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bring in many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren now watch verse 12 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church I love that I will declare my name unto the brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and and again behold I am the children which God hath given me we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seat here this afternoon if I uh were to take a title tonight I want to speak to you for just a few moments on this he is in the midst of his church amen he is in the midst of his church and you know amen it is a real uh special blessing to us to know tonight that we're not just gathered in his name amen but rather we are gathered under the authority of his name and we know that that Authority comes by Revelation yes and the first seal brother B will say Jesus his name on Earth was Redeemer Jesus when he was on Earth he was the Redeemer and that's true he said but when he conquered death and hell and overcome them he ascended on high and he said see he received a new name he said now that's the reason you holler the way they do amen and they don't get nothing see It'll be revealed in the Thunder SE amen notice the mystery so the world Amen is hollering the name Jesus but they're not getting anything amen because they're not in the place where God has provided amen for the believer to be in that's why he says and the name amen is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted amen is the manifestation of the name of God so the word interpreted amen is the manifestation of the name of God so I'll just say this as a Believer there are things amen that we must not forget and there's one thing amen that we must never forget is that this is God's church right amen it belongs to him and he alone see and by the revelation of himself he being the groom amen she the church has come into her true word identity amen of the Bride Jesus Christ see amen she's no longer Baptist she's no longer Methodist or Pentecostal amen but she is now miseries Jesus Christ but going say God being Sovereign he fornew by Divine decree exactly amen who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her and he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her and she belongs to him and to him alone see she is Holy committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head amen for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride amen is happy that he is her Lord amen he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight now amen I've just recently been listening there in the Hebrew series how many knows that Hebrew series brother been preached it there in 1957 and he takes amen the first several chapters of the book of Hebrews and we find amen that the book of Hebrews is a very powerful book Amen in that we believe that Paul amen though the world has has had a had a disagreement on this but we believe that Paul amen actually wrote the book of Hebrews now I love brother br's prayer in the in the Hebrews chapter one he says Heavenly Father tonight as we're so happy to know at the opening of this Hebrew letter how that Paul went right back into the gospels he just wasn't take it upon on a hearsay or upon an experience but he wanted us Amen to know what was truth Paul amen wanted us to know what was truth he went right back in the gospels in the Old Testament the gospel that was preached to them and he seen through the Old Testament the shadows and types that's why we got this great book of Hebrews tonight we see it Lord amen and we love it and through ages amen it's been burned it's been scattered it's been tried to be done away with amen but she just waves on the same amen because Lord you said that heavens and earth shall pass away amen but my word shall not now how many knows in the book of Hebrews what Paul is doing amen is he is separating the church amen from the law unto Grace right he is separating the church amen from the law and the Grace I love what brother says there in just a few places here in paragraph 50 of Hebrews chapter 1 he said our lesson tonight is not deep it's a shallow lesson but oh we'll get into the deep after a while amen this is a very shallow lesson it's just starting off he said but what it is it's one thing amen that is the exalting Jesus Christ that is exalting Jesus Christ another place he said now the whole first chapter amen is exalting Jesus and separating him from being a prophet the whole theme the first chapter is separating Jesus from any Prophet or any law or so forth and showing who Jesus is again he said the chapter amen was the exalting of Jesus so amen that he is the main one in another place Paul is exalting amen and placing positionally the Lord Jesus what what a task folks amen that the first church age messenger had amen he was given what he was given to do was he must separate Jesus from every Prophet from every law and he must exalt him amen and then he's going to positionally place him amen as the preeminent one see amen not only is he Our Savior not only is he our Healer not only is he Our Redeemer amen but Paul was placing him amen as the head of this church let me say this Paul amen did not just have a Healing Ministry amen but Paul also had a Teaching Ministry where the prophet of God said he took the old Hebrew word amen of the Hebrew church and he brought it to life amen and he placed it in Christ amen therefore they knew amen that God was in the man so when Paul separated him and showed you that Jesus was made a little lower than the Angels amen that he was a man amen but Paul showed you that he was not just a man amen but God was in that man oh folks can't you see tonight amen that a prophet did not just separate you amen and exalt you and positionally place you as the Bride of Jesus Christ but he announced unto you that God is in her amen by the baptism of the Holy ghost Paul amen was more than just a preacher yes Paul was an angel messenger amen and he was speaking things that should not be taken lightly come on now in the book of Hebrews the 2 chapter Paul says amen therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed Amen to these things which we have heard see lest at any time amen we should let them slip I love what he says here he said I pray the Holy Spirit Will sink that so deep in your heart we ought to give the most Earnest heed to these things which we've heard amen what type of a people ought we to be when we see the great Jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see them compared amen scripture by scripture that they're the truth he said we sit around sometimes like warts on a log just so unconcerned see he said we ought to be busy every minute trying to get the people to Christ he said we ought to be Lively Stones we should never be slothful like we are we'll go up to church and see the Lord Jesus do something or bless us and such away and we'll say oh very nice meeting he said now the preaching of the word we enjoy it amen but that's not the main thing see we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful see but we should worship him every hour of our life we should worship him every hour of our life when we're at work we should worship him every time the opportunity presents itself amen Worship the Lord by testifying of him now watch a prophet show us amen the different ways of worship he'll say Amen if a sister amen sitting there and you see her doing something wrong or dressing a certain way he said now just take her and say sister there's a better life than this what he's doing he showing you amen you're worshiping God he said you men at work when you hear a men using the name of the Lord in vain get a chance to one side and slip over and take him by the hand and say there's a better life life than this oh yes you shouldn't use those words and tell him in a Meek and gentle way amen all those things is a worship see he said we see someone sick and the doctor says there's no more can be done we ought to Worship the Lord amen by telling them there's a God in heaven that answers prayer now watch what Paul says in Hebrews amen chapter amen chapter 2 and verse number one he says this for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and disob obedience amen received a just recompense of reward said now watch there that word Angel actually means Messenger right come on that word angel means the messenger he said now do you know that you are a messenger this morning amen you are a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news he said isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors that we are angels The Messengers amen of the Resurrection we are God's Messengers to this sinful world that Christ Liv lives Amen in our hearts he lives in our Spirits he lives and he brings us amen from the low debauch life of sin and exalts us up and gives us a Hallelujah in our soul and makes us new creatures listen folks he had to be exalted above amen this world so that he could draw you unto himself what does the Bible say if I be lifted up amen I will draw all men unto myself see what a prophet is showing you is the Old Testament word amen was spoken by Angels but it wasn't any kind of word amen it was a steadfast word which means it was a stable it was a sure it was a firm it was a force listen it was a more sure word Peter says that we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where un we take heed do we do well amen as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn amen and the day star arise in our hearts listen what the prophet said the same Pillar of Fire amen that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today amen interpreting the Bible see amen and we are identified in that word come on right our identification is in the word see and we are identified in that word where the Shak glory in Revelation lays another place see every Parable in the Bible every type of the Bible is made manifest right here here before us the same God in the pit of fire that wrote the Bible both in the Old and New Testament is right here manifesting it showing it exactly interpreted right back Amen to make sure that it's the interpretation I love what he screams out we have got the interpretation listen we are not waiting for the interpretation we are not looking for the interpretation we have got the interpretation amen the word has been made manifest in our men that's why Paul says in Hebrews 2:12 amen saying I will declare amen thy name unto my brethren but where's he going to do this brother Harold in the midst of the church he said will I sing praise unto thee look at this word midst it is in the middle it is the midst it is in the midst of Amen it is amongst oh folks it is of a necessity tonight amen to identify who is in our midst amen is it just a preacher is it just a good feeling is it just an emotion or a sensation who is in the midst of us when you recognize who is in our midst amen that will birth a faith in your soul Amen to believe that he who is in our midst has the power to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or than my said may I your servant now be anointed amen for this service that's coming on May everyone here be anointed right come on and may we see the working of the hand of the Living God who is in our midst oh Church of the Living God we have just identified who is in our midst is the Living God now according to Hebrews 2 Paul says amen that God would visit man right in Hebrews 2:6 but one in a certain place testified saying amen what is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou would visitest him look at this word visitus it means to look up in order it means to look upon in order to help or to benefit amen it is to look after to have care for to provide for and it's speaking of God brother said he cares to you care when he was here on the earth as I say amen he cared for the people thank you Lord so much till he healed their sick he comforted their hearts he told them about a place where he would go and prepare for them and would come again to receive them unto himself see he cared for the people now I love what Paul says he says in a certain place he testified now if you want to find that certain place it's actually Psalms the 8th chapter and the fourth verse David which was a messenger of God Amen he testified that God would visit man now you all know that David had many visitations from the Lord right amen David had visitations in the good times amen as well as in the bad times you know that God actually visited Moses in the form amen of the pillar of at The Burning Bush Moses amen did not miss his visitation by by by taking those leaves Amen to the laboratory and analyzing it he knew that who was in the midst of that fire amen was almighty God I love what the prophet says Christ is visiting the Gentile church it's the evening lights that's just shining now amen the prophet said in the evening time it shall be light he said now this is the hour and this is the time if you'll just take that little some kind of little something and amen that wants to make you kind of halfway believe it and halfway doubt it brush that thing aside amen and come now it's Christ Jesus the son of God who is the same yesterday today and forever listen we are more than just a church here tonight we are a favored people amen we have found favor with the King he promised he would meet us here listen the message of the hour is not just a church it is not just a ritual amen but this message is an invitation listen You'll either accept it or you'll reject it it's an invitation to Salvation it's an invitation to Healing it's an invitation to a miracle it's an invitation to a Deliverance listen folks we're not just gathered here up on this Hillside tonight with about 30 or 40 Believers we are gathered here with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords has come down in our midst to visit the church all right come on God promised Israel he would be in their midst but they wanted to King an Earthly King so they go to Palestine they got settled down there then they begin to act like the Philistines in the Gentile world he said what happened it finally LED them to an Ahab Amen to a total backsliding and they fail to recognize the real King when he come he said that's the thing the churches has done today they have accepted all this other philosophy and Doctrine and psychology and different things instead of receiving the Holy Ghost and now the king is in the midst of the church and they don't know it amen they rejected it just exactly the way they rejected Jesus there amen so is the church rejecting him here today listen let me say what a prophet said he is not just coming he is here he is here in this church tonight by the promise of his word now if you go back in the Book of Genesis in the C chapter amen of the entire Bible you will find everything in the world today amen it started in the Book of Genesis how many knows that in that book of Genesis in the second chapter amen there were two trees right the Bible said the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and I want you to catch something where were these two trees amen they were in the midst of the garden amen the tree of life and the tree of knowledge amen stood side by side amen they were in the midst of the garden now brother tells us very plainly that the Tree of Life represented Jesus and the tree of knowledge repres presented the devil he said now the religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which have their roots in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen they stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other he said now listen God will speak to each one he will talk about each one he will call them the church the only the elect will really know which is the true spirit for only the elected will not be deceived amen so out of these two trees amen was the birthing of two Spirits which would birth two churches right yeah there would be a true church and there would be a false church now way back there in the early church a very short period after Pentecost the false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we find the deed to the nickel adans now the spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine until it is destroyed by God he said now we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was Jesus and the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of these trees had a relationship to man or they would have never been placed there they must have had a part in The Sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto God now brother makes it very plain he says the word word most definitely sets forth from that from before the foundation of the earth that the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man that's in Ephesians 1 you can read it but that life could not and would not be shared in any other way through the way God manifested In the Flesh now man could not directly come and partake I want to read this to you is that okay man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of Gard the eternal life of that tree had to become flesh first but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to save and to raise now man had to fall The Fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan had to come through the flesh also listen but Satan could not come through human flesh Amen to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the fall but there was an animal the serpent so close to a man that Satan could get to that beast and through that Beast he could get to human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like a Mis glorified one thus what God worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan and when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God then man could not get to the Tree of Life In The Garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal had caused the fall had it not he said let animal life be shed was taken and his blood shed then God had communion with man again listen then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by the means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple that Eve ate it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed listen in the Garden of Eden he was in the midst of the garden amen by the Tree of Life listen but then there was the fall in the garden which opened up the door Amen to death and suffering and it entered into the human race he said there death had entered how do we know amen look what he says do we not hear the voice of the spirit raised in that stage amen for all who will hear as he is calling to him that overcometh come on will I give to eat of the Tree of Life in The Paradise of God the church had already embedded too deeply of the tree of death or the denominational false Vine whose end is the Lake of Fire but there are no cherub and with the flaming swords Amen to guard the tree of life now listen folks the same tree of life that was there in the midst of the Garden of Eden amen has returned to the church in the last days he said now God Amen does not now depart from the midst of the church as he departed from Eden oh no he will ever be in the midst of his church until the final age until the time he caused all to come home listen the devil might have put him out back there but there's a church in the last days who has been sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen he's not on the outside of this church death will not put him out sin will not put him out unbelief will not put him out there is a predestinated seat of God on the earth tonight to receive him in all of his power and all of his glory I love what the Bible says Revelation 2:1 unto the angel the church at Ephesus write these things amen sayth he that holdeth the Seven Stars in the right hand somebody shout holdeth who holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand I love this next part and who walk in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks somebody shout holdeth and walketh amen he holdeth the seven golden candlesticks amen and he walketh in the midst of them look at this word holdeth it means to be powerful it means to be Chief to be master of it means to be ruler it means to keep carefully and Faithfully Amen to continue to hold look at this word walketh it means to make due use of opportunities listen there he is he of whom it is SA that this same Jesus is both Lord and Christ there he is the one and only Lord God Almighty and beside him there is no other what he was in the first age he is in all ages to every believer he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did once he is still doing and he will keep on doing now you will notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of his churches there is no one else with him Jesus alone is walking in the midst of his churches there is no one with him when he tried the fishness of the Wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung up on the cross and gave his blood he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the Alpha and the Omega of our Salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him and his word is law breeds dogmas bylaws Constitution have no effect on us yes it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is God in her amen willing and doing his good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you and that is Jesus and Jesus alone he said as he walks in the midst of his church he is aware of the suffering of his people and he cares listen folks as he's walking in the midst of his church that word walth means to seize do opportunities amen can I tell you this tonight he is not a million miles away he is right here in this building tonight the same Lord Jesus who held the seven golden candlesticks and walketh in the midst of the church is right here walking in this church tonight you know what he's doing he's looking for an opportunity Amen to heal a sick body he's looking for an opportunity Amen to touch a heart he's looking for an opportunity to give somebody Deliverance listen we're not gathered in a preacher's name we're not gathered in a Church's name we are gathered here in the revelation of the manifestation of the name of God hallelujah I say this as plain as I know how a grain of wheat planted in the end of single grain of wheat will produce exactly will reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during the certain period of time I love what he says that Single Seed will die but in dying that life that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or the carrier of that life which has to come back are y'all ready for this it has to come back to originality in a multiplied form oh yes the life that's in that seed Brother David has to come back but it's got to come back in an original ity in a multiplied form glory to God Jesus the great Royal seed died the matches one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church for all seven Church ages giving his life to the church this carrier or Bearer to the end that his very life will be reproduced in bodies amen like unto his in the resurrection so can I say it like he said it what was in Jesus in one member of the body is now manifested in a many membered body come on folks amen the same life that was there when they gathered in that little room and he broke the bread the same life that was in him when he went in Gus's house the same life that was in him when he raised the Widow of name son the same life that was in him when he walked on the water amen is right here in this building tonight by the revelation of his name oh if you can see who is in our midst it'll Hallelujah well Glory God if you can see who is in our midst it'll bring a blessing upon every heart upon every life Paul declares unto us that Jesus is amen the captain of our Salvation thank you Lord and the only way he could become the captain of our Salvation was he had to suffer Hebrews 2:11 for he that Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all one amen so the life that is in the head amen the preeminent one the main one the exalted one is now in his church listen watch a prophet bring the two together in St John 15:5 he says I am the vine and ye are the branches see he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing I love what he says oh don't you see the vine and the branch there the congregation says amen so they they actually still said amen back then the congregation says amen he says all one amen so here's the vine and the branch and they're all one in other words what the vine does the branches will do also amen if the vine suffered amen the branches will suffer also but listen they will come to the same destination listen there was a purpose in the suffering of the vine and there is a purpose in the suffering of the branch amen if you can turn these fours up and be good he may commit you to suffering as he did job his purpose is after that we have suffer for a while we would be made perfect we would be established and strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us so in very plain language the very character of Jesus Amen was perfected by the things which he suffered unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain see and this little temporary suffering that we go through amen now it's not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes brother bab said look the church that is not suffering is not being tried amen hasn't got it it is not of God now either we believe what a prophet said or we don't and he said a church that's not suffering and it's not being tried he said that church is not of God listen you say well I wish the Lord would just hold back the trials and he would hold back the sufferings well that's the only way you can and come Amen to a character that is fit to rule and Reign amen is by the things that you suffer come on folks the things you suffer is what puts a Christlike character in you and brings you to a place of perfection in order to rule and to Reign listen the prophet of God said as the seed of fruit is in the midst of the fruit so is he the Royal seed in the midst of the church as the seed alone has life in it so is he the author of life to the church his walking amen signifies his untiring care of it he is the chief shepherd He is watching over his own that is his right see for he bought that church with his own blood that blood is the blood of God Amen and the one who owns that church is God Amen the very god listen I'm talking about the captain of our Salvation I'm talking about our chief I'm talking about our general I'm talking about one who we're following listen folks he's not a God Amen that sits up high and looks down up on you low and says go do it and if you succeed then more power to you but he leads by example come on he taught us how to handle our sufferings he taught us how to handle disappointments he taught us how to handle sickness he taught us how to handle hard days he taught us how to handle trials because he is the chief Shepherd of the flock yes sir y'all remember B tells that story there he talks about the about the uh uh the the the fire that broke out there I think in the oil company somewhere he said there come the Louisville fire department here come the Jeffersonville fire department he said the Louisville fire department pulled up I think it was Louisville right you correct me if I'm wrong he said the Louisville fire department pulled up he said the captain jumped out he said now squirt a little water there boys squirt a little water there squirt a little water there squirt some over there he said the fire just kept burning he said then all of a sudden cross the bridge come the Jeff Ville fire department he said they pulled up jumped up said they threw the ladder up said the chief got out put on the gear and climbed up the ladder and he looked back at him and said come on boys and he said he led him into the fire and they put the fire out he said while one Captain was standing there telling them what to do there was another one that showed up and said here's how you do it listen folks he didn't stay outside of the midst of the firefighters but he was right there in the midst of the trial with him oh Church of the Living God let me say this he's not standing outside of your trial amen throwing words to You Inside he is in the midst of your church he is in the midst of your trials he is in the midst of your sufferings because he is the chief captain of the host of the Lord listen Christ is in our midst and by him being in our midst he has secured the victory for every believer thank you Lord yes ma in Hebrews 2:14 Paul says for as much than his children are partakers of Flesh and Blood yeah he also himself likewise took part of the same and that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage now watch for verely he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham right wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brother that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now watch for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted come on yeah I love this word secur it means to sympathize that the reason he became this that he might be sympathetic with you who have your ups and downs your little ins and outs and your Temptations and get so great you can hardly stand it he knows how to sympathize with you look what Paul says in Colossians 3:1 he said if you then been risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God I love this quote he sits there to make intercession he sits there to love you and though you go astray he won't forsake you he will still come after you and knock at your heart there's not a backslider in the building but what knows that God kn s at his heart daily and he will do it as long as you're a mortal on this Earth for he's loved you he redeemed you let me say this he is amen the chief Shepherd and we are his sheep in St John chap 10:1 I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep but he that is a hirling and not the shepherd who's own the sheep or not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catcheth him and Scatter the Sheep he said the hiring fleeth because he's an A hirling and careth not for the Sheep he says but I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and I laay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and there shall be one Shepherd there shall be one fold and there shall be one Shepherd listen the shepherd is in the midst of the sheep look at verse 27 he said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish and neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand remember comes along and the Good Shepherd of the sheep and he said a man owner of the sheep when he went to get a Shepherd he went and searched out till he got the best Shepherd he could be gotten because he loved his sheep and this man must must be a special trained in knowing how to take care of the sheep he must know what kind of food they eat he said now listen the Sheep of God Amen are fed by the word of God he said the holy spirit in you what makes you the Sheep feed solemnly on the word and solely he feeds on the word and anything you throw in the pen outside of the word he will root it out to one side and let it lay there he said see God selected the great Shepherd of the flock the Lord Jesus and gave him all the authority now before he can go to lead the Sheep he has to know the shepherd's voice he said the true Shepherd lays down his life for the Sheep the hireling shepherd won't listen he will run away and leave the Sheep amen but the true Shepherd will stay with the sheep and I'm so glad he said these words amen lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world see as long as God's got a sheep God's got a sheep to lead that sheep how happy we should be that God's sheep led by God's Shepherd how long was it to be a little while and the world will see me no more but yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you leading you feeding you guiding you amen shepherding you un the end of the world he said God Shepherd he don't have to take one down and put another one up because man cannot be God's Shepherd in that sense one dies another one takes his place but this one Shepherd I love this quote the great Shepherd over the flock laid down his life once yeah glory and it's become immortal and his Spirit now it can never be killed oh God Amen sin might have put him out of the midst of the garden amen unbelief might have put him out of the midst of the garden but he has reserved unto himself a second Eve a second womb a second bride he is Conant Perpetual leader and feeder of the sheep until his Corporal body comes from glory and he sits on the throne of David and all the Lambs will be around him listen you say well I wish I could have been there when he sat there with the disciples and he show him the scripture I wish I could have been there when he sat there in the midst of the synagogue and he opened up the word and he said this day is the scripture fulfilled I wish I could have been there brother Ben when he sat there and told him about the Miracles and he broke the fish and the Loaves and he fed him can I say this the same life that was there is right here tonight in the oh God it's here in the same way except the Corporal body but said well then if he's the same he's got to be the same in principle he's got to be the same in power he's got to be the same way in every way except a Corporal body you say well he's not here in a corporate body but can I say this he's still here the Bible said he's always always been here in some form brother BR picks it up he said now God has always been on the earth how many believes that God has always been on the earth he says God has never left the Earth if he'd ever leave the earth I don't know what would become of it but God has always been here in some form glory to God he's always been here in some form Oh Praise His Name well what form is he here in tonight Church is he here in a Corporal body is he here with nail prints in his hands is he here with a long robe on I'll tell you how he's here he's here in the form of his word he is here in the midst of his church in the form of his word say it very beautiful he said and you notice there the Bible speaking of the Lamb of redemption there it spoke of it as a singular amen killed the lamb but in other terms every family killed a lamb but all represented one L and in the spiritual meaning of it that each one of these families the father being the priest of the own house they was to kill the lamb for each house that they could eat the meat and but it all represented one lamb that means in reality that there's many missions or many churches there's bodies of Believers but they're all together representing one lamb we're all feeding off of the same lamb listen we're all feeding all of the same message listen what he said see what I mean here is one church over here and another one down there and one in Africa one in agypt but it's all from the same lamb the Redemption comes from the same lamb and we're fed oh my the body of the Lord Jesus which is the word thank you Lord say very powerful we receive him in the form of the word a correct Shepherd will feed his congregation on the word the lamb take it without water not sod just eat it raw roast it with bitter herbs sometimes it's kindly hard you have to maybe break up a few things but don't worry it's all right eat it anyhow you're getting ready for the journey other place you say then brother brandom if Christ is on Earth today a real servant would take him to him Christ well Christ is here in the form of the word and the word brings life because he is the word and Christ is the word see yes he is the word himself the true servant always takes you to the word somebody asked me one time they were I was counseling with somebody and they were asking me some questions and they said brander amen everything you say you always say well there's a quote where said or there's a scripture and then they said why don't you just speak on your own accord I said because I can't feed you as a lamb of God anything separate from what the word says listen folks either the word is our Compass or it's not either the word is our God or it's not he said now he is the word he is this Bible made living and when you die to yourself with Christ like a corn of wheat then the word lives in you and brings forth the same results as it did in that living corn of wheat that had to drop into the Earth you are a partaker in his resurrection you are a partaker with him and all of his blessings and all of his manifestations you're partakers with him in all that he did right I love this the trial TOA Kansas paragraph 143 now still they won't believe it but Jesus promised that that as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot it would be in this last day we've got it it's here it's already Vindicated just how many scriptures in the Sodom age what happened to Abraham would return back again to Abraham's Royal seed which is in Christ Christ returning oh God in the form of the word working in human beings oh yes my goodness Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings sir and showing the signs that he promised it would sign it would do he promised he would do it can I say this to you the word is in our midst wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst what is the name is the manifestation of the word of God listen folks that's why the prophet said I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst that's why in the first seal he said they're hollering Jesus but they're not getting anything because they made Jesus something separate from his word but if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word see Jesus is the word revelation 1:12 and I turned to see The Voice spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice oh I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same can we say it together Jesus is the word Jesus is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made are y'all ready for this are you ready for this if you can ever really get to see the word you will be seeing Jesus all right if you ever start really seeing the word you will be seeing Jesus if you ever see the word you'll be seeing Jesus when John turned he saw seven golden candlesticks actually they were lampstands and according to verse 20 there are the seven churches but seven candlesticks that thou sawest are the seven churches to represent the churches they could hardly be candles because a candle burns but a while and then it is burned out it dies there would be no more of it see but lampstands possess a lasting quality that is not found in candles now watch a prophet he goes from that right to Malachi 4 and reads Malachi 4: 1-3 can we just read it behold the day come that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day cometh shall burn them up said the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name there it is but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and you shall grow up as calves of the stall ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SES of your feet in that day shall I do this saith the Lord of host listen but unto you that fear my name come on folks that's not a scare amen that's not a fear as you're afraid amen of something of danger but unto them that reverence my name unto them that recognize my name unto them that respect my name unto them that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings there it is again he says the Su n is shining out all his strength oh the strength drink of the Son of God Amen shining in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there he stands the one the judge who suffered and died for us he said yes there he stands amidst the lamp stands with the Stars in his hand it is night for that is when we lamp that is when we use lamps for light that is when the stars are seen shining and reflecting the light of the sun and it is dark Sea and the church is walking by faith in the darkness her Lord dep of this Earth are you with me but the Holy Spirit still shines out through the churches thank Lord come on folks he's never left the Earth but here a prophet says our Lord her Lord has departed this Earth but the Holy Spirit still shines out to the church giving it light to his old sin cursed World those who reflect his light also the light only have is the only light they have is his light how dark it is how spiritually cold yet when he comes into the midst it

did I love this he said now you know right away that if they are held in his hand they're associated with his power that is what his hand signifies it signifies the power of God and the authority of God not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what Paul said no man would dare to see it takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of God and the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost they all stood up to the world they could do that they were full of God they were sent or authorized by God

abased and I know how to abound everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be fool and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need look at verse 13 but I can do all things woo Glory I can do

flesh 1954 what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be what kind of church would it be this morning if the brandom Tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God yeah you didn't even use your own thoughts you didn't have no alternative of your own but just to be led by the spirit they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God are y'all ready for this then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself he says hey man then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps and his power and his thoughts and his being and his moving then your thoughts will become words oh God and words will become material thank you Lord you ever been thinking about something all day long thinking about it thinking about it thinking about it and you come to church and brother Ben you start preaching that word and it goes out there and it strikes that thought and somebody shouts amen or Hallelujah you know what's happening words have come from Fault right to word to material said that's when the church in its power I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from their themselves they don't see themselves they don't have no thoughts but to serve God and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit they live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings yeah by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind another one that when God sends something to the church in every age if the people receive it it becomes a great thing and the church is empowered and great things take place but if the church rejects it that church just goes out into a Darkness another place I would ask you to be merciful unto them Lord and whatever there is the cancer of doubt now listen to this listen to The Prophet the cancer of Doubt yeah the cancer of temper the malignancy of unbelief yeah come on the cancer of doubt the cancer of temper the malignancy of unbelief take it out just now Lord and give them the Holy Ghost fill their soul with your goodness baptize them into the kingdom just now as they raised their hands in the confession of Faith they
