do and Minister and speak and bind up the Brokenhearted and deliver the captive and set free those that are bound and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord it can be in an afternoon service on a Sunday that

vessel that you can use we commit the service to you now in your name the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and then praise the Lord if you have your Bibles we'll be reading out of Psalms 23 and once again just happy to be in fellowship with each of you and um humbled by the invitation from brother Ben and uh we're thankful to be here thankful for the fellowship this afternoon and to see old friends and new faces it's just a joy and a privilege to be in the house of God we're reading out of uh Psalms chapter 23 and uh um very familiar but let's read this the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runthe goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you may be seated I just want to read a a quote uh quickly uh brother Brandon would say out of who do you say this is he'd saying look at the world today what a attention the whole world lives in in you go down the street it's not even safe to drive I don't know about here but come visit us it's not safe to be on a four-lane highway we got about a 16 Lane Highway everybody's at attention snapping what's the matter quen down where are you going that's what's making the insane institutions fill up that's what's got the church in such turmoil they're so headbound on a certain thing they won't stop and consider God's word and the hour that we're living all under a strain a tension now we know we are aware the Earth has just went through some great birth pains and the church is going through some birth pains it had to go through birth pains before it could have each of the prophets when they came into the world it was a birth pain to the church the world has went through the first world war second world war and now it's ready for a third world war and it's in birth pains again and there's only one thing that can bring peace and that is Christ all of our schemes and our ideas and our ecclesiastical buildups we're not free from them just because we say we we believe the message there's still a lot of schemes and ideas and ecclesiastical buildups and all of our politics and all of our science and everything it's been proved that it's nonsense and then we pray for God to help us to intervene come in and do something for us and then when he does I just want wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even would we consider it I want to by the help of God just preach to you a little bit maybe uh testify or like I told brother Ben maybe I'll just preach ify a little bit I want to talk to you about divine intervention and and with that title being said I I got to thinking we had such a lovely meal meal my what a spread wasn't that wonderful I mean I think there was every meat yet the turkey the ham and this stew and this mashed potato and that mashed potato and the sweet one and the white one and every kind of dessert I saw one brother I'm like man he He piled that plate so high of dessert and I thought my goodness I wouldn't be able to move after all that what I got to think in my this is such a wonderful spread and everybody's going to be eaten and so happy and I got to thinking we're going to need to divine intervention tonight I mean I'm like Lord maybe this is the right title cuz we're going to need divine intervention come in and and stir the people a little bit you know and and that's what we're here for and and you know intervention is the act of interfering with the outcome or course especially of a condition or process so as all those things are building in the body and your eyelids are getting uh uh heavier and heavier and you you feel like you're sinking in your chair and you're getting comfortable and you're about to go to sleep well we pray that there's an intervention of that outcome of you falling asleep while the word is going forth but I I I just looking at the the the definition of intervention that act of interfering with the outcome or as the prophet of God said to come in and do something for us and I believe that's why we're gathered here together tonight it's not is not just to fulfill an obligation but we we want to as we spoke this morning uh uh we to be ready and prepared for the rapture we want God to come in and do something for us in the Supernatural that our our gathering is not in vain that we're in his presence and God is here to do something special for us and and and I believe that by Divine promise God is here and he's here to do something for you something specific for you and as the prophet would say and when he does it I just wonder if we'd be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even if if we would consider it my I wonder if many times God's speaking but are we listening that's right God is trying to give you the answer he he he's trying to show you the way he he he's trying to get your attention but you know sometimes we're just not listening maybe we don't recognize his voice you know I think of that time the prophet was there uh I Believe on Hurricane Mountain you know and and and the storm had come in very quickly and you know he was a he was a Woodsman he was a a guide and he knew his way there in the mountains and and and really it probably uh if he did get lost uh for him you know he would just find a place to to hunker down and be able to climb into a bank somewhere or build something because he he he would be able to survive that but when this storm came in you know he had his wife and his baby was down there in that cabin and and so he knew that they wouldn't be able to weather the storm they would freeze and they would die so he didn't have the option of of just uh uh climbing into a cave or or getting to a place to to weather out the storm so he he knew he had to get down the mountain to that cabin because there everything that he loved and everything that he held dear it was down there in that mountain and so as as this this Hunter this guide kept uh making his way back for that cabin he kept coming back to that same place I believe there was a deer he'd come back and like now I'm I'm back to where I started and he he would get his bearings again and he would start to walk and he would go off and and I imagine it would be some time before and he' come right back to the same spot and he like now that came right and he did it again and it struck him he said I'm on the Death March the Indians would call it the death march where when you were lost you you would start to go in circles and keep coming back to the same place yeah and he thought you know I got to get it together here I got to get down there because there's my wife and and the baby are there and and and and I need to get there and he would he would start off again and he felt like there was some little something a voice that said I am an everpresent help in the time of trouble oh yeah and he and think of this now here's the prophet of God he'd say okay now I'm just losing my mind I'm starting to hear voices yeah and and he would start to go and say I am an everpresent help in the time of trouble he goes I I got to my goodness what is that I'm starting to hear voices now and I I got to get down there cuz my wife and baby are are are are going to die and he he's trying to find his way and he says I am the Lord thy God and everpresent help in the time of trouble oh yes and and it finally after two or three or four times the prophet of God finally recognized think of it in the trial in the storm you're you're you're going through everything and God is here speaking to you if a prophet could be in such a place of of where he's he's trying with his best just to hang on and to make it through and hear God is talking to him and how many times did he hear God speak in himself he he's wrestling be be with in his mind whether whether it's God speaking to him or not and as that voice got stronger he finally recognized oh God is that you and he fell down to his knees he started to cry he said oh God forgive your stupid servant I'm lost I need your help oh God Amen yes sir he said uh after crying out there to the Lord you know he finally recognized it was the voice of God that was talking to him and then he purposed in his heart and he said I'm just gonna I'm just gonna start heading this way I'm just going to try to make it back this is the best I can do and he starts to walk back trying to find his way towards that cabin and he said here he was gone you know the visibil there was no visibility he's just doing his best and he said all of a sudden there was something grabbed a hold of his shoulder and turned him around he said and I turned around and all a sudden the fog and and and the and the skies and everything parted and I could look over the mountains and through that little parting Gap and there I could see that that tower that held that line that ran down to the cabin and he said I was walking into certain death I was walking Plum into Canada I I would have lost everything that all deer and and possibly died trying to get there he said but what happened God intervened God grabbed a hold of his arm God turned him around it was divine intervention that God intervene Hallelujah and when he does it I just wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even would we consider it oh my I say God help us give us the wisdom give us the strength lead us guide us show us the way that when he does it we would consider it that we would be able to receive it I think many times God speaks to us and we don't want to receive it God gives us the answer but it's not the answer that we're looking for it's God intervening on the situation God giving you the answer God closing the door sure oh that's right I I remember one time I I was uh uh just a young Christian and you know you can sometimes you you you might find favor with people and maybe God give you that ability to find favor with people and and to to to be able to work things and and and I remember I I I had to get somewhere I had something planned I I'd get to the airport and you know and uh they were they're like I'm sorry things are it's too late you can't get on and and so I was like well can I talk to this can I talk to that and I finally get back and and and after this other says no and this and I finally push my way I get to somebody and they're like you know what well something just opened up and and we can get you on and and and I finally I got there and after it was all said and done I realized you know maybe I shouldn't have been here in the first place yeah God was trying to shut the door and I was trying to kick him open on I I never stopped for one moment said Lord is that you it do you want me to go Lord are you trying to talk to me are you speaking to me I I had something in my mind that I wanted to do in a direction that I wanted to go Lord and in my zealousness to carry out my plans am I leaving you out of the equation I should have said Lord I I'm up against an obstacle again and and I don't want to rely on on my ability of a man to to bring this to pass Lord if it be thy will speak to me Lord show me if if you're closing the door and I presume if I would have done that and listened maybe the reason I kind of had that little burden on my heart anyways is it wasn't the right time it wasn't the hour that maybe I should have waited and I say that when when God's closing doors or when situations are arising and things are happening I say it behooves us to stop and wait on the Lord and and look for the mind of God and say Lord what are you trying to show me in this trial what are you trying to show me in this situation Lord why have these things come to pass it could be something awful it could be something evil but God knows how to take those things and and apply his word that it would work out for your good if we would just wait upon the Lord the scripture says those that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall rise up with wings as an eagle they shall walk and not Faith they shall run and not be weary oh teach me Lord to wait upon thee let him intervene on your behalf let him speak to you and when he does oh consider it Lord what are you doing in my life we need something from God we all are are needy and maybe you have some type of need for your family and you need an answer I say maybe just to try to keep it a short service tonight but we want it to still be impactful we still want we want God to do something we want something that you're believing for that your faith would rise up and be able to claim it and you know you have to have that type of expectation something in your heart that you're believing for something I think of blind barus how he sat there he knew that Jesus was passing by and he wasn't satisfied there just to sit through the service and fulfill an obligation but he said you know what I'm going to participate I I got to get involved because I have a need and I'm going to cry out I'm going to scream out thou son of David have mercy upon me I have a need oh God I say if we can just all get together in one mind and one Accord and we can start to cry out oh God minister to my need speak to me speak to my brother and my sister we have need of thee and oh I believe God will come on the scene in a supernatural way cry out unto the Lord oh yes you know I don't know what your need is but I I I I think of those lepers there in Luke that were they started to cry out thou son of David they started to cry out Jesus Master have mercy on me oh yes there was 10 of them yeah and he's graciously stops to minister to their need he says go show your eles to the priest you know leprosy is a type of sin you know and here they had that need and Jesus ministered to them he says now go show yourself to priest and the scripture says as they went along their way it says one of them when he when he saw that he had been healed when he saw that he'd be changed he turned back to Worship the Lord he turned back to give him glory he turned back with a loud voice giving God glory and giving God praise oh could you imagine what he was going through could you imagine what he was what he was feeling this this burden in this weight that had been upon him he turned back and the scripture says it was with a loud voice he began to give God praise thank you Lord and Jesus said where are the others were there not 10 where's the other nine come on he said there are not found that returned to give God glory save this stranger this Samaritan not even a Jew but he has come back to give God glory I say oh God I want to give you glory I want to give you honor I want to give you praise for the wonderful things that you've done in my life the wonderful things that you're doing in this church I want to give you praise and glory for this message that you've given to me I I want to scream it out and say oh thank you God and what did Jesus say to him he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith has made thee whole I believe God can speak the same thing to you tonight amen go thy way thy faith has made thee whole oh yes he considered it he turned back to give God glory if I can say anything if anything becomes of this service yes sir why don't you [Music] consider how God has intervened in your life if we get anything out of this service tonight I want I want you to start thinking about how God intervened in your life oh come on maybe you need the joy of your salvation restored maybe you need to think back I don't it might be 30 years it might be 50 years it might be 60 years go ahead and think back to that time and that hour think back to when God you had a need and God by divine intervention came into your life and did something for you oh if you can just start to think about that divine intervention and who it really was that came on your back I wonder if we could start to give them a little praise I wonder if we can start to give them a little Glory I wonder if we can just let down a little bit tonight say you know what Lord you're worthy of the praise you're worthy of the Adoration I'm going to go ahead and lift my voice I'm going to go ahead and raise up my hands I'm going to go ahead and give you praise I'm going to give you glory I'm going to give you honor Lord you're worthy of oh you you are the mighty conqueror you are the lamb that was slain before the fountain of the world you are the lion of the tribe of Judah that has prevailed with an open book to loose the Seven Seals I'm going to go ahead and give you glory and honor I'm going to be like John where everybody in heaven and everybody in Earth heard I John saying blessings and honor and Glory forever and ever oh Hallelujah because my divine intervention God has intervened on your behalf hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus Oh Praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah well go ahead Hallelujah might be a little bit of a different service but come on has he done something for you come on has he opened your eyes did he bring you out of denomination did he bring you out of Egypt am I talking to somebody has somebody intervene for you was there something you needed done that you couldn't do come on were you stooped in sin was there no way out but God rich in Mercy wearing this great love that he has loved you yes sir yes sir Hallelujah well why you maybe you feel like you ain't got nothing to praise him for come on maybe that's what's what's the matter is some of us you feel like you ain't got nothing to praise him for come on maybe you've never experienced or maybe you've come to the place where you're just unsure oh my maybe I brother Matthew well I hear all of this and these people maybe they have something to say but you know really I I don't I don't feel like I have anything to shout about oh my come on well that's okay come on but guess what come on you're here come on and if you're here you're in his presence you're in his presence there ain't no other presence I would want to be in tell me what Bishop tell me what pope tell me what president tell me what superstar you what singer you got somebody else you want to be in the presence of but on a Sunday afternoon you are in the presence of the Shina glory and the prophet of God said in the

you Lord God intervening Hallelujah divine intervention Hallelujah things going One Direction thank you Lord looks like there's no hope yeah come on doctors have given up maybe you have given up oh my but then God comes on the scene my God Amen oh we could we could take time and go through the scriptures and and even speak Adam and Eve and how there they had fallen yeah come on oh my but God rich in Mercy intervene when they started to walk out of the garden there and there Adam was walking out there with his wife and there was the those bloody sheep skins patting across the back of his legs the prophet of God said God couldn't see them to go out that way he said wait but I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman what was he doing he was prophesying of a savior that would come and pay the penalty for you say it was God intervening on your behalf divine intervention is something that man can't do come on yes sir Hallelujah that only God something that you need that's Divine oh yes thank you Lord I say when God intervenes it changes Hallelujah everything changes the outcome yes thank you Lord how many times hallelujah how many times oh come on has he intervened yes how many times Lord has he come on the scene how many times that we didn't even know it sir how many times on the roads how many times down through the ages to protect that seed you're one in a million oh yeah naturally and spiritually well more than one a million in the natural I mean it's beyond calculations come on come on God knew what you'd be wearing he knew what you would look like he knew what seat you would be in and by his for knowledge God knew all of these things that he could predestinate and then he could look out through all generations all the way back to Adam and Eve to make sure you showed up here on a Sunday afternoon in that seat in those clothes that's the kind of God we serve that's the kind of elect he has is that your grandpa great great great could have died and this or that but God said I got to intervene because this is the process this is the way that I'm going to bring forth a bride they're going to be in that body look don't get upset about your body some of us are taller shorter some of us are shorter some of us are wider some of us are thinner it doesn't matter God had you fashion the way he wanted fashion and you showed up in this day and this generation exactly the way that God wanted you because he wanted to place that predestinated seed on the inside of that vessel and he wanted to send his word that would Quicken that seed to life and you would become the very manifested anointed word of the age Hallelujah God intervening on your behalf oh thank you Lord God rich in Mercy thank you Lord he's the Divine architect yes he is he's the one that holds it all in his hands yes you know you think of Abraham there here he finally gets the promise yeah now he's going up on a mountain yeah to sacrifice the promised son that's true he gets up there and Isaac being obedient son he's built the altar Isaac dad where's the sacrifice son God's able to provide takes his only begotten son lays him there on that altar I don't think any of us can begin to understand the agony oh my and the turmoil oh Jesus that Abraham was filling in that moment oh my but he had a problem promise Hallelujah Lord I received him as one from the dead Hallelujah Glory come on and so I must have a son to be a father of many nations that wouldn't be enough to take away the agony and the grief but he had to be obedient and there are Isaac a type of Christ laying on the altar willing to give his life Abraham was committed to do it he raised back that that hand with that knife that sharp knife he was about to cut his throat my and just in that moment God said Abraham stay your hand oh it was God intervening yes it was God Divine in Abraham stay your hand for I have provided you a sacrifice and there caught in the thicket was a ram and what did Abraham do he called that place of Jehovah Gyra God is able to provide himself God is able he's still the same yesterday today and what one what one of the seven Redemptive names do you have need of God's willing and ready and able and standing by to intervene on your behalf hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus prophet of God said and when he was ready to obey God to its fullness oh yeah there's the key he caught his hand and said stay your hand Abraham there was a ram hooked in the wilderness around the vines with Thorn with horns on top of that mountain where there was Lions wolves hyenas jackals and great ferocious beasts that eat sheep and then he was way up on top of the mountain where there was no water how did that Ram get there oh my Abraham had picked up Stones all around to build an altar but there was the ram anyhow it was a paradox oh yes and any man that believes God and takes him at his word sir no matter what the situation is God will perform another Paradox to keep his word for Abraham called that place Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for himself a sacrifice he still can cause a paradox to happen oh yes he can do it this afternoon oh yes if you'll just take him at his word oh thank you Lord thank you I just wanted to maybe share a little testimony uh maybe I should call it a big testimony for me in my life and the way that God dealt with my heart I had uh I want to tell a little story I I had a a surgery to remove a tumor and and I had some lingering symptoms that I was battling with and I got to talking to a brother and I I was fellowshipping about it and just wondering you know why why make why the prolonged you know God had moved miraculously on the scene and intervened on my behalf then but I having these kind of followup surgeries I'm having to do and some lingering symptoms and it just struck my heart you know I thought you know I need to take time and consider maybe God's allowed this to happen because I really haven't taken time oh my to consider really what God did for me yeah I didn't take the time to really appreciate it and testify about it oh my like I should and I realized that maybe some of this prolonged symptoms and surges was a reminder exactly what God had done because very good it we we should consider what God is doing we should consider what God has done but thank you Lord but you know it's so easy for us to just run off and not take time to consider yeah that's true we call upon God and we need answers and situations and and and maybe you know few months and few things go by and maybe even your own conversion you were calling about God and before you know it you just you're on your Merry Little way living back life normal just like those lepers oh my here they were in one spot yeah an outcast come on and they couldn't go into town they couldn't mingle with society and then they called out because they had a need and God met their need but they went on their way ungrateful oh my I say oh God I I I don't ever want to be ungrateful again I'm going to take the time and the consideration of what you've done for me not only in my personal life but what about the age what about the generation what about the church what about the family what about the hour that we're living in thank you Lord but sometimes we don't take time we we don't take time and consider it we just run off yeah that reminds me of a time I was on a little road trip and I was driving a little fast like sometimes I accidentally do often Lord forgive me you know and those semis get piled up out there and one wants to pass the other and they're five miles behind them so they get over and you thinking well I got enough time so you just just you get in the slow lane and you got enough time to get up and then get in front of them and keep going well sometimes it gets a little close and I was with a friend and it was getting a little close and I started to get over and he was like wait wait wait wait and I hesitated oh and and and and I I had to overreact and before you know we're starting to fish tail on the highway when I say fishtail I don't know now I'm at least going 70 miles per hour cuz I'd slowed down trying to but my my truck was fishtailing and it fishtailed over and hit the the you know cuz one semi got over here and then there was one in the slow lane and so I zoomed up to go in between them and as I went in between them I started fish tailing like this on the highway and swung all the way over and and that probably would have been the final swing if that truck wasn't there we'd have started rolling but I hit that semi and it shot me right across the median right across I20 through oncoming traffic hit the other side and then now there's a bridge with the big concrete pillars coming down you know that the concrete bank that goes up like that and now I'm shooting right through that Gap two feet higher would have tore off the top of the truck little bit lower we'd hit those pillars shoot right through that Gap and I tell you like Dukes a hazard we come off the other side of that thing through the air boom and we I mean we stick it like a gymnast right there in the mud brother Brandon preaching the whole time it was surreal it was the tape was still playing and it it was a miracle yeah yeah I'm like the truck's not even really damaged oh my I'm like but I'm stuck and I could see the father saying son come on I want you to consider yes your actions come on CU I was stuck in the mud because if I wouldn't have been stuck in the mud you know what I'd have done thrown on my blinker went down to the next exit and turned around cuz I was on the wrong side of the highway remember yeah come on I would have gotten back on the road and I said hey that was a close one maybe never even thought about it again come on maybe I would have said hey man did you see them maneuvering skills I kind of got us into a little something there but did you see that yeah you know cross the highway and through on and yeah you know coming woo you know I was I was I was like a race car driver man I really had it under control you know I didn't have nothing under control come on prise but there was two predestinated seeds Hallelujah two sons of God that God had a plan for their life and in my ignorance I could have snuffed it out come on but God intervened glory and I had to be stuck in the mud come on I had to call for a tow truck come on preach to pull me out and maybe you feel stuck in the mud tonight maybe you need to call on Jesus say God I need you to pull me out I I realized I got myself in a situ but I I know you've intervened in my life time and time again and here I am I feel like I'm stuck I'm calling on you pull me out of the muck in my I'm going to learn my lesson and I'm going to give you praise hallelujah oh yes yeah I had to I had to think about it a little bit yes I was stuck there in the mud you know and oh thank you we have to have understanding and consider when God does something like that for us yes just in reflecting in my testimony setting the stage for it you know and I remember 2019 was really one of the hardest years of my life my brother Aaron who is a best friend of mine you know he moved to Arizona and that was just a we're very close best friends and always looked up to him and cherished his ministry and you know he moved away and that same uh year uh we had performed the the wedding ceremony for my uh my cousin charity and it was just a month later uh that she went to be with the Lord and so uh 2019 was just uh for me was a very a difficult and hard year and and those are maybe just some of the the the bigger things there was other underlining things that were just piling on in in 2019 and and it was just very tough it was a big trial for for me you know it was a really I I was felt like I was in a really dark place and but you know God gave us a little bright spot you know I we found out we were with child and and and we were going to have a baby and I just felt you know in my heart that I said you know this is going to mean Victory oh my you know through all this turmoil and all this trial Lord You're giv me a child I I want this I want this name I want this meaning to to mean Victory and so as I I made that statement I thought about that you know the the uh my son would be born in the year 2020 I started to say you know what uh uh 2020 is going to be a year of Victory and I started to make this uh a profession and and I won't belabor uh much of the time but even even uh evans's birth was Supernatural as um we had complications in uh as we did a home birth we had complications and uh the the The Midwives had to call 911 we had lost his heart rate twice and it became a a great emergency and and we just we we we called on the name of the Lord but you know just just before that it was it pretty profound now as I I begin to tell you a little bit more about it but I I I knew I wanted his name to to mean Victory and here we're we're just hours maybe from having having our son I said Lord and I had thought about uh names you know uh uh certain ones and I I thought about Evan which meant grace of God and and would like my middle name Matthew and I just thought about those things but then as now the hours closing down I need hey I need to pick something you got to name that kid something can't call him kid your whole life hey kid I said I said Lord I I I was kind of settling on on Evan Matthew which means grace of God and I said Lord I I thought his name was supposed to mean Victory and I just felt that still Small Voice say what greater Victory is there than the grace of God and I thought that's that's it Lord yes his name's his name's his name's Evan uh the grace of God and it seemed like right as I told Gabriel that it seemed like the enemy uh all of a sudden we we lost the baby's heart rate and it seemed like fear came in the room and the devil was saying it's not this ain't a year of Victory because now it's actually on my dad's 70th birthday and he's like this ain't going to be a memorial for your dad's 70th this is going to be more heartache and more pain and all a sudden it seemed like all this fear was try starting to pour in the room as as we had lost the heart rate and now they're calling 911 and you could tell the midwives it was beyond their abilities now we we we didn't realize this until the the birth but the umbilical cord had been wrapped around his torso and around his neck and all of his auction Supply had been been cut off and I kept trying to encourage my wife honey you can do it you can do all things and I didn't realize when she was saying I can't it was physically it was impossible because the baby was hung up and it it was dying and all that fear pouring in the room and something a perfect love cast out fear I laid my hands on my wife and I cried I said God you're a God rich in Mercy you're an everpresent help in the time of trouble I need you to come on the scene and no more than I said that look the baby hadn't even dropped yet and as soon as I said that uh the Midwife goes the baby's here and those midwives would testify this that as you started to cry out to God I felt something sweep through my own body into your wife the other Midwife said the baby it was just it was it was a miracle all of a sudden the baby was just there why because that's the God we serve he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble and so God God brought us through that and we were so thankful and and then they asked me what his middle name was going to be and I thought well I want to give God a chance I was thinking about Matthew and sure enough right when I said that he the scripture came to my mind for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is a gift of God so I say my my son's name Evan Matthew he's an Ephesians 28 baby because uh Evan means the grace of God and Matthew means gift of God and and truly he he's been a gift and the grace of God to our lives and I say what a testimony I praise God that He gave me that Ephesians 28 baby and you know it was shortly after coming through that trial here this this year of Victory what strikes me while I'm in the Pulpit you want Victory you got to go through a trial yeah well I got what I asked for it's going to be a year of Victory and shortly after that I started having some symptoms and I decided to go to the doctor and I I hate to be so transparent but I I started to have some some blood and the urine and things and you know I'm pretty hard-headed I I uh you know I I kind of like to be like a bulldog by faith and just grab a hold of something and and you know a promise and not let it go you know that we we need to learn and we we need to grow and we need to have wisdom and we need to be able to teach others and instruct them properly and and so I didn't realize God was teaching me something I remember thinking about others maybe going through a trial or something and you know we always think we'll do something until it's your time to go through it yeah and so I just thought you know maybe I I better go to the doctor I better not ignore this and so I went to the doctor and I pulled up in front of that that office there and I said Lord by your stripes I'm already healed yeah I had this question why why do I got to go to the doctor do I even need to do this well the prophet actually said it's your duty to go to the doctor that's right but I I I said Lord by your stripes I'm Healed and just as soon as I said I felt that still Small Voice say yes but it wasn't until M was on the operating table that I intervened and so that was the way God dealt with my heart to know that I needed to go through the process that that God could use a doctor and and I I went in there and it happened to be uh February 20th it was 220 2020 Dr Graves isn't that a wonderful name for a doctor after I went to my family practitioner they referred me to a urologist and I went into the urologist and they did their analysis and then finally I said okay we need to bring you in we need to go go in there and look and see what's going on and what's causing this and so yeah it was 220 2020 Dr Graves go with in there and you know he's been practicing for about 40 years he takes one look at it he goes it's cancer Oh my he said that's bladder cancer he says do you do you smoke do you do this do you do that and he said well this is second to stomach cancer he kept asking me he was a little perplexed he said well you you haven't done I said well when I was a teenager you know before I started serving the lord and I said all this stuff he's like well no it's yeah it's it's possible low grade but I mean it's it's cancer we got to get in there so he scheduled the chemo he scheduled everything and based on his 40 years experience and four days later that's when I would go in to have the tumor removed and I appreciated Dr Graves because he came in he wanted to he was a Christian and he came in and laid hands on me before the surgery and said I want to lay hands on you and pray pray with you before um before the surgery and you know this is where I didn't realize how miraculous it was but now that I've had to go in for surgery another two or three times uh just to do some corrective things um I didn't realize it but when they put me under you know they started to give me the anesthesia but uh you know for for you to make it to the operating table is very rare if any of you have ever had to go into a major surgery or something typically those anesthesiologist I mean they're undefeated I just tell you that much you can fight it all you want but you're going under yeah but but it was just odd that I remember I was conscious and I made it all the way back to the surgery table and those things man they are not like some comfortable bed it is a flat metal sterile table and I remember them Lifting me up and put me on that thing and I started talking to the the doctor's assistants and everything they go whoa buddy you ain't supposed to be awake back here and they're like they said you know it's time for you to go to your happy place and I told them I'll never forget I said my happy place is the word of God and I said though I walk through the valley of this now here I am on the operating table I'm under anesthesia I'm not supposed to be awake but here I'm laying on that table and there I'm saying yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before the presence of my [Applause] ear next thing I wake up heart monitor heart rate I'm back like all right surgery's all over I'm like what what do you mean surgery's all over God prepares to oh yep I've been out for hours they had already performed the surgery I'm back in the recovery room and so this is where the journey would take place a little bit I woke up there in the recovery room and after coming home I ended up having some complications and having to go to the emergency room and and they had to to do some things there but um I remember uh the next day there in the hospital uh Dr Graves came in I said Doctor what's going on he goes it's just the devil I'm like now there's a doctor yeah that knows what he's talking about and all my life I've never gone to a doctor said Doctor what's wrong with me it's just the devil I'm like I can get with you there that's exactly right this is just the devil and so but it in in regards to those complications they were relatively minor to a degree and so but I I I know he was anxious to get lab results because they had they had Mo removed the tumor and that was the day we were going to go get the lab results back because like I said he gave that diagnosis just by his 40 years experience there hadn't been a a lab result come back but he said I'm going to go to the lab going to go see what they called in on the report and I'll never forget it wasn't but about 30 minutes later that it seemed like he came back to the room in a rush and in a hurry and and there was this look upon his face where he he came back to me said he goes hey I I just had to come back and tell you but he said I I I've been I've been doing this for 40 years I've never seen this and in all of my my years of practice but it come back there's no cancer it's you're you're you're cancer free praise the Lord I said praise the Lord I I I he he was perplexed I I he goes I said well so what about the cancer treatment he's like you don't have cancer he's like I I it came back with some he didn't he wasn't even familiar with the diagnosis the when it come back with the labu something he hadn't seen before but basically said you're cancer free and so I was there recovering in the hospital and you know it struck me that here I I it was now we on a Wednesday night I believe the surgery was on Monday I ended up back in the emergency room on Tuesday overnight in the hospital on Wednesday now they're keeping me overnight we're having service back home and I'm streaming back home and I've I've shared the testimony and the News results when my dad he's he's up behind the pulpit and he starts to give uh the testimony there on Wednesday night he says he goes you know when when when they were doing the operation on on Matthew he said you know God took the life out of the cancer and then all of a sudden everything came back forth Circle exactly what he said he said yes but it wasn't until ma was on the operating table that I intervened you see it was God's will that I I would make it that far I did all I could do the doctors did all that they could do but when it came time God by divine intervention he came in and he removed that life out of that tumor that would have been malignant that would have been cancer I I I could have battled that for years but God rich in Mercy sovereignly he divinely intervened and he took the life out of that cancer it wasn't the doctor's operating table it was the operating table of the great physician and I stand before you cancer free why because God intervened thank you Lord oh why don't you praise the Lord for his goodness thank you Lord praise him for his grace and his Mercy if the musicians would come why don't you use this as an opportunity if God's intervened in your life if God has divinely intervene and giving you Victory and maybe you need it let this be an encouragement to you that
