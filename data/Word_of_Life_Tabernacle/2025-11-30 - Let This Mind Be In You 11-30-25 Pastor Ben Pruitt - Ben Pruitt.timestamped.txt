[37:53] How many believers do we have this
[37:54] morning that we serve an awesome God?
[37:57] Amen. Are you ready for the word of the
[37:59] Lord this morning? I love this song. I
[38:01] feel the pull. Do you feel that pull
[38:02] this morning of the hour? Amen. I
[38:05] believe you know what's Think about it
[38:07] though. It's not just us that's feeling
[38:08] the pull of the hour. Everyone's feeling
[38:10] the pull of the hour. But aren't you
[38:12] thankful we know what we know.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; And we've got a vindicated prophet just
[38:16] like the children of Israel had. And we
[38:18] are not following blindly but we're
[38:20] following [music]
[38:21] thorough vindication. And I'm so
[38:23] thankful for it this morning. Let's just
[38:25] enter in and pull on the gift of God.
[38:26] How many's ready to receive this [music]
[38:28] morning? As our pastor comes at night, I
[38:33] lay in there
[38:36] and I
[38:38] begin
[38:40] to cry.
[38:45] And my life [singing]
[38:49] [music] just fails to know
[38:53] exactly [music]
[38:55] why.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't [singing] explain
[39:04] with tal
[39:10] [singing and music] growing
[39:12] deep
[39:13] within.
[39:15] Oh, it must [music]
[39:17] be God
[39:19] here [singing] in my soul.
[39:22] Cuz I feel the pull
[39:26] with all your hearts down. [music]
[39:29] I

[39:34] Yes, you do.
[39:36] Oh, I hear [music]
[39:39] God. [singing]
[39:44] Oh, and I [music] know his spirit
[39:48] is
[39:50] me
[39:52] to give [music and singing]
[39:54] my heart.
[39:59] He speaks [music and singing]
[40:01] to me.
[40:06] and by
[40:09] the [music] way.
[40:13] Oh Lord,
[40:16] please [music] come and take
[40:20] control.
[40:21] I feel
[40:23] the
[40:25] I like this one here.
[40:28] I went to hear the word
[40:34] and with each life [singing]
[40:37] [music]
[40:38] and praise.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, he was [singing] calling
[40:47] me [music]
[40:49] to
[40:51] a higher
[40:53] praise.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] and there's
[41:00] a deep
[41:02] call [singing]
[41:03] to [music] the deep
[41:06] like a great magn
[41:10] [music]
[41:11] [singing]
[41:18] [music and singing]
[41:23] with all your hearts now. [music] hear
[41:24] you sing it. I feel [singing]
[41:28] the Lord.
[41:36] [music]
[41:41] Oh, and I know [music] his spirit
[41:44] [singing]
[41:45] is
[41:47] me
[41:48] to give
[41:50] my heart. [singing]
[41:53] [music]
[41:55] Oh, he speaks
[41:58] to me. Is he speaking to you this
[42:01] [singing and music] morning?
[42:03] Oh, and now
[42:05] I reach.
[42:10] Oh [singing and music]
[42:11] Lord, please come and take [music]
[42:16] control.
[42:18] I fear
[42:20] the whole. If we could sing that, if we
[42:23] could play it quietly while [music] they
[42:24] sing. Let's sing with all our hearts. I
[42:26] fear
[42:27] the po. [singing]
[42:29] Oh yes, Lord.
[42:32] Oh, I hear
[42:35] [music] the call. [singing]
[42:38] Yes, Jesus.
[42:40] Oh, and I know your [singing] spirit's
[42:44] moving
[42:46] me to give [singing]
[42:50] my all.
[42:53] Oh, granite law. For he speaks [singing]
[42:57] to me.
[43:02] Oh, and I
[43:05] agree. [singing]
[43:10] Oh, Lord, [singing] please come [music]
[43:14] and take control.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; I feel
[43:20] the P.
[43:24] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[43:25] of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so
[43:28] thankful that we can feel that this
[43:30] [music] morning. Thankful that you are a
[43:32] God who responds, Lord, and calls. Lord,
[43:36] I pray that there would be one here this
[43:38] morning that's feeling that pull that
[43:40] they would respond to that and [music]
[43:42] they would just, Lord, pull up closer to
[43:44] you, God, as we can only do that by
[43:48] agreeing with your word, by believing
[43:50] your word and accepting it in our
[43:52] hearts. And pray that you put that
[43:54] together. pray that you'd just move in a
[43:56] mighty way in this service. I pray that
[43:59] there'd be no hindrance to your word
[44:00] being preached or to the spirit of the
[44:03] Lord moving. I thank you for these
[44:05] people that have gathered together.
[44:06] Lord, we we know that you're with us
[44:09] because you promised you would be. Lord,
[44:11] I pray you'd heal every sick person. So
[44:13] many out today sick. Lord, I pray that
[44:16] you'd bless them. God, I pray you reach
[44:18] down right where they're at and heal
[44:20] them. I pray you'd help us now, Lord.
[44:22] move me out of the way so I can make
[44:24] your people. We pray Jesus.
[44:29] Amen. God bless you this morning. If
[44:32] you'll turn with me to Philippians
[44:34] chapter 2. Philippians chapter 2 and
[44:36] verse 5. Is this cutting out?
[44:38] Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5.
[44:44] [crying]
[44:54] If you could turn it off back there.
[44:56] Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Might. There you go. Philippians 2 and
[45:13] verse 5. Let this mind be in you which
[45:15] was also in Christ Jesus. How many want
[45:18] that today?
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God thought it
[45:22] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[45:26] made himself of no reputation, and took
[45:30] upon him the form of a servant, and was
[45:34] made in the likeness of men. And being
[45:37] found in fashion as a man, he humbled
[45:40] himself, and became obedient unto death,
[45:43] even the death of the cross. Wherefore
[45:46] God also hath highly exalted him, and
[45:49] given him a name which is above every
[45:51] name. That at the name of Jesus, every
[45:54] knee should bow of things in heaven, and
[45:57] things in earth, and things under the
[45:59] earth, and that every tongue should
[46:00] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[46:04] glory of God the Father. Pray the Lord
[46:06] would add his blessing to the word. You
[46:07] may be seated this morning. Brother
[46:10] David, good to see you back there. You
[46:12] and your family with us this morning.
[46:14] God bless you. I know they're still
[46:17] mourning the loss of a pastor there at
[46:19] the church, little church they were
[46:20] going to. Just pray the Lord would give
[46:22] direction to each one. Amen. When when
[46:26] brother Brandham preached the spoken
[46:28] word as the original seed in 1962,
[46:31] he made the statement that there had
[46:34] been many seeds sown into the earth. If
[46:37] you've listened to that, you remember
[46:39] him talking about that. He talked about
[46:40] how denominational seeds had been sown
[46:43] and there had been uh seeds sown of uh
[46:47] of Pentecostalism and seeds sown of
[46:50] revivalism and Baptist and different
[46:52] ones. But he said there was also a word
[46:55] seed that was sown. And he said that
[46:58] there couldn't have been a uh a a
[47:01] harvest of the seed uh or a harvest. He
[47:05] said it couldn't be the latter rain
[47:06] because the seed hadn't been sown yet.
[47:09] So we know that the Pentecostal revival
[47:11] of 1906 wasn't the latter rain because
[47:13] the seed hadn't been sown and the latter
[47:15] rain could only come in the harvest
[47:17] time. So he he he brings that out and
[47:20] and he brings the people to a place
[47:22] where they understand what's happened.
[47:24] And then he makes this statement. He
[47:25] said, 'Lord, he said, 'I got the people
[47:28] standing here now. He said, and I've got
[47:29] them on a limb. He said, and I can't
[47:32] predict a future. You know, Brother
[47:33] Brandham wasn't God. He was a prophet.
[47:36] He could only tell us what the Lord told
[47:38] him. And I'm glad that he was faithful
[47:39] to do that. But he he said, "I can't
[47:42] predict the future. I can't tell them
[47:43] what to do. What will I do?" He said,
[47:46] "I'll leave them standing on a limb."
[47:48] And I said, "God, I think I'm doing this
[47:51] by your will." He said, "I've never done
[47:53] this before cuz the seed hasn't been
[47:55] sown yet." He said, "But I believe it's
[47:57] time for me to say something." And the
[47:59] Holy Spirit spoke to his heart because
[48:01] he said, "What am I going to say to the
[48:04] people about the future?" And he said,
[48:06] "Pick up your pen and write." A and
[48:09] within that I I want to focus on a part
[48:11] of that. Brother Brandham wrote several
[48:14] things by inspiration of the spirit and
[48:16] pick up your pen and write and and he
[48:19] said notice the harmony of the father
[48:21] and the son. He said Jesus never did
[48:23] anything until it was first showed him
[48:26] by the father. That's in John 5:19. He
[48:29] said this harmony is now to exist
[48:32] between the groom and his bride. I want
[48:35] us to think about that. Ponder that for
[48:37] just a moment. He said this harmony, the
[48:40] kind of harmony that existed between the
[48:42] father and the son was now to exist
[48:45] between the groom and his bride. He said
[48:48] he shows her his word of life. She
[48:51] receives it. How many have received it
[48:53] this morning? She receives it. She never
[48:57] doubts it. Now there's a challenge to
[48:59] us. But he said this is what the bride
[49:01] would be and how she would act. He said
[49:03] therefore nothing can harm her, not even
[49:07] death. This is your future. This is what
[49:09] God spoke to brother Brandham. He said,
[49:11] 'What am I going to tell him about the
[49:13] future? He said there will be such a
[49:14] harmony between them and God. He said
[49:17] that nothing can harm her, not even
[49:19] death. For if the seed be planted, the
[49:21] water will raise it up again. He said,
[49:24] here is the secret of this. The word is
[49:27] in the bride as it was in Mary. I want
[49:30] you to understand that Mary didn't have
[49:32] anything to do with the word being in
[49:35] her. Is that right? She she was just
[49:37] receptive to it. She said, "Be it unto
[49:40] me according to thy word." Oh, if we
[49:43] could only be that way this morning. Be
[49:45] it unto me according to thy word. But
[49:47] she couldn't make the word come to pass.
[49:50] She just had to receive it and let it
[49:52] grow. And it grew to become the full
[49:55] word of God. And so we receive the word
[49:58] as a seed. He said the word is in the
[50:00] bride as it was in Mary. I don't think
[50:02] we should worry. I don't think we should
[50:04] spend our lives spreading and and
[50:06] worried about what's going to happen.
[50:08] Say, "Well, the bride's not in very good
[50:09] shape. The message people are not in
[50:11] very good shape, and I see failure. I
[50:13] see all of these things." I don't think
[50:15] we should worry about those things
[50:16] because we we know that if God plants a
[50:20] seed, he's going to harvest a crop,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; right? He never he never had a a crop
[50:24] failure. He He's a He's a good farmer,
[50:26] if we could say it like that. He always
[50:29] harvests a crop from the seed that he
[50:31] plants. In fact, he says that he not one
[50:34] word would go out void.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Not one word, if he ever spoke a word,
[50:38] that word will come to pass. If he ever
[50:40] planted the word in your heart, that
[50:42] word will become something. So, I want
[50:44] to encourage you today that the word
[50:46] that he's planted in your heart is going
[50:48] to become the fruit of God in your life.
[50:51] Oh, I'm so glad for that. Listen, if he
[50:53] gave you a word of healing, I know we've
[50:55] got some serious sickness around the
[50:57] church right now and we've got some
[50:58] people struggling with cancer and heart
[51:00] disease and different things and but
[51:02] listen to me. If he ever said, "I'm the
[51:04] God that health thee and he plants that
[51:06] word in your heart," then it's going to
[51:08] come to pass. It's got to come to pass.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world that could
[51:13] ever stop the program of God. I'm so
[51:16] thankful for that today.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:18] He said, he said she receives it and she
[51:21] doesn't doubt it. And the word is in the
[51:23] bride as it was in Mary. The bride has
[51:25] the mind of Christ. I want us to focus
[51:29] on this now. For she knows what he wants
[51:32] done with the word. She has the mind of
[51:36] Christ. For she knows what he wants done
[51:39] with the word. She performs the command
[51:42] of the word in his name. For she has
[51:46] thus saith the Lord.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; This is what he said. This is what your
[51:54] future is,
[51:55] &gt;&gt; right? This is what the bride's going to
[51:57] be after the seeds have been sown. This
[51:59] is harvest time. It's time for the
[52:01] rapture. Are you Are you with me now?
[52:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is what the bride's going
[52:05] to have and does have."
[52:08] Now he said she performs the command of
[52:11] the word in his name for she has thus
[52:15] sayeth the Lord. Then the word is
[52:16] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[52:19] pass like a seed that is planted and
[52:22] watered it comes to full harvest serving
[52:25] its purpose. Now he he says we have the
[52:29] mind of Christ. Paul says that in 1
[52:32] Corinthians 2:16, he said, "Who hath
[52:34] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[52:36] instruct him?" But we have the mind of
[52:40] Christ. We have the mind of of Christ.
[52:43] Now, to have his mind, we have come to a
[52:46] new birth to get rid of the mind that we
[52:48] had and to accept the mind of Christ.
[52:51] Now, we know that the mind of the people
[52:52] today, like it was in Noah's day, is to
[52:55] do evil. and and and we just know that
[52:58] that's the way it is out in the world
[53:00] today. I don't have to tell you that.
[53:01] You know how it is. Brandon makes this
[53:03] statement. He said, "Oh, God, let me go,
[53:05] Lord." He said, "Don't leave me behind,
[53:07] Jesus. Let me go with you, Father." He
[53:09] He said, "I don't want to stay here on
[53:10] this earth to watch these tribulations
[53:13] coming on." He said, "I don't want to
[53:15] stay here in this insanity." Now, watch
[53:17] that for just a moment. I don't want to
[53:19] stay here in this insanity. I don't want
[53:22] to stand here when hideous sightes
[53:24] people losing their mind. I I think we
[53:27] can stand here in 2025 and say the
[53:29] people have completely lost their minds.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, and I don't want to
[53:34] stand here in in that place. He said
[53:36] that we look at men, he said, trying to
[53:38] act like beasts and look like beasts
[53:41] &gt;&gt; and women trying to look like animals
[53:43] with pain on their face.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; We could stop there for a while, but
[53:48] there's a reason why Brother Brandham a
[53:50] prophet. And you say, "Why did brother
[53:51] Brandon preach against certain things as
[53:53] hard as he did, like makeup on women and
[53:55] and like men acting a certain way and
[53:58] acting feminine and women acting like
[53:59] men?" Why did he preach it so hard?
[54:01] Well, we're seeing the fruit of of a
[54:03] seed, a a a seed of discrepancy that was
[54:07] planted in that time. But the brand
[54:09] looks at the seed and said, "It's going
[54:10] to become a crop."
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Right? And we're living in the time when
[54:13] it's become a crop.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm thankful if there was a seed
[54:17] sown of discrepancy. There was also an
[54:19] original word seed that was sown at the
[54:21] same time and we're seeing the fruit of
[54:23] that seed.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Said men and women trying to act look
[54:30] like that like animals. And that's just
[54:32] recent, isn't it? We've seen that in the
[54:34] schools and everywhere. Men and women
[54:36] trying to act like animals.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Who'd have thought?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; In little towns, we see it. And and in
[54:42] small schools, we see it. And and you
[54:45] think how what? But it's an it's an
[54:46] influence. The devil has more influence
[54:48] over people's lives than he ever has
[54:50] because of modern technology and things.
[54:53] And he's got an influence over people's
[54:55] lives. Now, he said, knowing these
[54:57] things are predicted to happen that the
[54:59] thing will, he said, they'll go so
[55:01] insane till locust will raise up with
[55:03] hair like women to haunt the women,
[55:05] teeth like lions. That comes from the
[55:07] book of Revelation where it talks about
[55:08] those things. And he said, things that
[55:10] you said, the mental condition of the
[55:12] people will be completely gone. That's
[55:16] right.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Completely gone.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I want to say with brother Brandham this
[55:20] morning, "Oh God, don't let me stay
[55:22] here. I don't want to be here during the
[55:23] tri if it's this bad now. I don't want
[55:26] to be here during the tribulation
[55:27] period. I want to go home."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "We see it in the making right
[55:32] now. Lord, help us. Restore us to the
[55:36] sane mind of Christ Jesus our Lord." The
[55:41] sane mind. So the the mind that we have,
[55:44] the the sane mind, the mind that is not
[55:47] insane, the mind of the bride is the
[55:50] mind of Christ. And Paul says, "Let this
[55:53] mind be in you." Again, just to kind of
[55:57] show you what this is, Brother Brandham
[55:59] says, "Heavenly Father, search our
[56:00] hearts in this minute." He said, "It
[56:02] only takes a moment of time, a change."
[56:05] Oh my. Oh, church, if you've had another
[56:07] mind, now think about this for a minute.
[56:10] What causes sin in somebody's life? What
[56:12] causes a person to go into sin or to do
[56:14] something that would be against the word
[56:16] is because they have a mind of the
[56:17] world,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; a a mind of Satan. But if you could ever
[56:21] have the mind of Christ,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; right? And he said it only takes a
[56:25] moment of time, a change,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; he said, let the mind of Christ come
[56:29] into us. He said the Bible said, "Let
[56:32] the mind that was in Christ be in you."
[56:34] He said that changes our character.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; That changes our character. He said,
[56:40] "God, let the mind that was in Christ be
[56:42] in me. And if anywhere that I have
[56:44] failed to punctuate your word with an
[56:46] amen and then follow it out, then Lord,
[56:48] change me. Make me over." How many can
[56:51] have that same prayer this morning?
[56:52] Lord, I want that change to take place
[56:54] in my life where I'm no longer thinking
[56:56] like the world thinks, but I'm thinking
[56:58] like God.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Your mind is your character. Again, I
[57:03] know I'm laying a lot of things in here,
[57:04] but there's somewhere we want to go this
[57:06] morning. So, you just bear with me. I I
[57:08] hope you love the word today. That's
[57:10] that's all I can do. I heard brother
[57:11] Brandham say in a in a tape called
[57:13] Humble Thyself. And he said that he said
[57:16] what you need is a pastor who said
[57:17] that'll just feed the flock and won't
[57:20] try to just fix everything, change
[57:21] everything, but just feed the flock the
[57:23] word of God. I pray we can do that this
[57:25] morning. He said we've got to take the
[57:27] entire full gospel. We must. And now
[57:29] being that we have identified ourselves
[57:31] as full gospel people, he said let's
[57:34] mold our character. We're in. So, so we
[57:36] want all of the word. How many believe
[57:38] all of the word?
[57:39] &gt;&gt; If you're the bride, you can take all of
[57:41] the word. And so he said, we want to
[57:43] mold our character. Let's mold our
[57:45] character. He said, we're invited to be
[57:48] molded in his image. That's what he's
[57:50] saying. Let this mind be in you which
[57:52] was also in Christ Jesus. We're invited
[57:55] to be molded in his image that we might
[57:57] reflect his presence.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; And the works that I do shall you do
[58:02] also. The life that I live, so shall
[58:04] you. We're invited by God to take him as
[58:08] an example and let our character be
[58:11] molded like his.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And then when we let his character be in
[58:16] us, then we have become sons by having
[58:20] the mind of Christ mind which is his
[58:23] character. Your mind makes your
[58:25] character. Now I want now think about
[58:27] that deeply for a moment. So what you
[58:29] think about things is what you do about
[58:33] things.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Right. It comes from your thought,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; right? And so if if your mind and this
[58:39] is why sin begins in the mind,
[58:43] &gt;&gt; right? It begins in the heart. It comes
[58:45] it come the desire of the heart becomes
[58:47] the thought of the mind and that begins
[58:49] that begins to take over your life. It
[58:51] becomes your character.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; But if you could ever let that mind get
[58:55] that mind right, then everything begins
[58:57] to work correctly. So your thoughts
[58:59] matter. So we don't want just our
[59:02] outside to look good. We want the inside
[59:04] to be right. And what what legalism
[59:07] does, this was the problem with the
[59:08] Pharisees. What legalism does is it
[59:10] makes the outside good, but it doesn't
[59:12] deal with the heart and it doesn't deal
[59:14] with the mind. It doesn't deal with the
[59:16] character of a person. It only deals
[59:18] with the outside part of a person.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham said it molds the
[59:23] character of a son of God. That word
[59:26] mind in the in the biblical Greek in the
[59:28] original is to think to form an opinion.
[59:33] Now you young people listen to me this
[59:35] morning because it's important because
[59:36] you're going to form opinions,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; right? And and we're going to say,
[59:40] "Well, I have an opinion about the word
[59:43] &gt;&gt; and maybe it's different from the
[59:45] opinion the pastor has, right? Or
[59:48] different from the opinion the church
[59:49] has." And that's okay.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; But it don't need to be different from
[59:53] the opinion of the word.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; All right? Right there you go.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Right. The the opinion of the word
[59:58] matters.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; So he said the bride would to have the
[1:00:01] mind of Christ is to have the opinion of
[1:00:04] Christ. The same opinion that he has
[1:00:07] about anything. It's to judge. This word
[1:00:10] mind is to judge. It's to describes the
[1:00:12] faculty of thinking, assessing and
[1:00:15] processing information. It it's holding
[1:00:17] an opinion. You'll find that in Acts
[1:00:19] 28:22 and Fleman 17. in uh certain
[1:00:24] context it can adopt a more intentional
[1:00:26] sense of setting one's mind on
[1:00:28] something. Paul warns his audience
[1:00:31] against setting their mind on earthly
[1:00:33] things. He encourages believers to think
[1:00:35] the same to be of the same mind. 2
[1:00:37] Corinthians 13:11
[1:00:39] he he warns people to think the same
[1:00:43] way. And that's what he's saying when he
[1:00:45] said, "Let this mind, I want you to
[1:00:46] think like Jesus thought." And the only
[1:00:49] way you can do that is by having the
[1:00:51] spirit of God in you
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; to be able to do that. Otherwise, you
[1:00:54] won't think like Jesus thought. But he
[1:00:57] said, "I want you to think." He said, "I
[1:00:59] want you to think this way."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So when Paul's saying, "Let this mind be
[1:01:02] in you." He's saying, "Have this
[1:01:03] opinion."
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; So have this opinion. Think like this.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Right? Are you following me so far?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Think like this. Let this mind be in
[1:01:13] you. Now see, we could go to a lot of
[1:01:16] places and I don't want to apply it just
[1:01:18] yet, but there just to drop something
[1:01:19] in. Say, so the word says I should go to
[1:01:22] church. What's my opinion about that? I
[1:01:25] could have a lot of opinions,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; but he wants me to think like him
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; about that.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Right. The word says that I a woman
[1:01:33] shouldn't cut her hair. We could have a
[1:01:35] lot of opinions about what that means,
[1:01:36] but he wants us to think like he does.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Why why did he send a prophet
[1:01:41] in this age to show us what was in the
[1:01:43] back part of his mind? To show us how he
[1:01:45] thought about the word.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; So, we can all have a different opinion
[1:01:50] and say, "Well, this is the way I think.
[1:01:52] This is what I think it ought to be.
[1:01:53] This is the way I think things ought to
[1:01:55] be done." But what does [screaming] the
[1:01:56] word say? It's not so much my opinion,
[1:01:59] but my opinion's got to be formed like
[1:02:01] his opinion was formed.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Think about the
[1:02:06] word like he thinks about the word.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:09] So let let's go to our text again.
[1:02:11] Philippians 2:5.
[1:02:14] He said, "Think like this.
[1:02:17] Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:02:20] in Christ Jesus." Look at the first
[1:02:23] thing he says. Who being in the form of
[1:02:27] God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:02:31] with God. Robbery is the word robbery is
[1:02:34] grasping something. So he wasn't
[1:02:37] grabbing something that wasn't his.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Right. He thought it not robbery to be
[1:02:43] equal with God. So it was not grasping
[1:02:47] for him to say that.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said Jesus standing on
[1:02:50] earth. He knew where he stood. He knew
[1:02:52] who he was.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have power to lay my life
[1:02:55] down. I have power to take it up again.
[1:02:58] No uncertainty about that. I have
[1:03:00] Hallelujah. I now have the power to lay
[1:03:02] it down. I have the power to take it up.
[1:03:04] No one holdeth me. So what what's he
[1:03:07] saying? He he knew that he could come
[1:03:10] down from the cross. He could he could
[1:03:12] have called 10,000 angels. He could do
[1:03:15] those things. He had the power to do it.
[1:03:17] And yet he laid his life down because
[1:03:19] that was the opinion. That was his mind
[1:03:21] about the word was to do the will of the
[1:03:24] father. So he submitted himself. He knew
[1:03:26] who he was and he submitted himself.
[1:03:28] This is very important. As Christians,
[1:03:30] we've got to know who we are
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; or we can't properly submit ourselves to
[1:03:35] the word.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Right. There's things I might tell you
[1:03:39] to ask you to do or or tell you to do or
[1:03:43] or say you should do this. My opinion
[1:03:45] would only mean so much. But to my wife,
[1:03:47] it means something else.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz she's my wife.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; So my opinion has a different impact.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? My opinion has a
[1:03:58] different impact on my wife because of
[1:03:59] relationship. She knows who she is.
[1:04:02] She's Mrs. Benjamin Puit. When the bride
[1:04:06] recognizes who she is,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; brother Bram said the rapture will go.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; When the bride recognizes what what is
[1:04:12] it? There's got to be something in us
[1:04:14] that we recognize. I am the wife of
[1:04:16] Jesus Christ. I belong to him. He He
[1:04:19] brought me out of darkness. He brought
[1:04:21] me out of a deep mit. How many could say
[1:04:23] amen to that this morning? He's given me
[1:04:25] a new mind, a new way of thinking about
[1:04:27] the word. And so what do I need to do?
[1:04:29] If I belong to him, then I need to
[1:04:32] listen to him. His word means more to
[1:04:34] me. Well, I know there's a lot of people
[1:04:36] the word don't mean nothing to them. But
[1:04:37] to us as the bride, the word ought to
[1:04:39] mean everything to us.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:04:48] he said, I have power. He said there was
[1:04:50] no uncertainty about that. I have
[1:04:52] Hallelujah. I now have power to lay it
[1:04:53] down. He said, "Any man or woman that's
[1:04:55] born of the spirit of God knows where
[1:04:56] they stand."
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what takes place or how
[1:04:59] many says yes or no, they know where
[1:05:02] they stand. I've told you before, but a
[1:05:03] preacher didn't put me in the message. A
[1:05:05] preacher can't take me out.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Your pastor might
[1:05:09] not might disagree with you on something
[1:05:11] that don't put you out of the message.
[1:05:12] Why? If you're in the message and the
[1:05:14] message is in you, you were in the mind
[1:05:15] of God before the foundation of the
[1:05:17] earth. You belong to God. No matter how
[1:05:19] far you might run, no matter how how far
[1:05:21] you might go into sin, he's going to get
[1:05:23] you. He's going to get a hold of you cuz
[1:05:25] you were predestined for ordained from
[1:05:27] the beginning. I'm so grateful for that
[1:05:29] today.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; You are. You need to know who you are.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; If you're going to have the mind of
[1:05:34] Christ, you've got to know who you are.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; There can't be this idea. So, well, I
[1:05:41] believe the message is right about most
[1:05:43] things, and yet I've got this other
[1:05:45] side. Well, I think the world has a
[1:05:47] point, too.
[1:05:49] Right. That can't be the way it is.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; now,
[1:05:56] he said he said he knew who he was,
[1:06:00] therefore he had faith. And if you have
[1:06:02] time, go listen to perfect faith.
[1:06:03] Brother Brandham dwells on that how
[1:06:04] Jesus knew who he was. He said he knew
[1:06:07] who he was, therefore he had faith.
[1:06:08] Faith could produce. He said when he
[1:06:11] knowed who what he was, he said, "If you
[1:06:13] abide in me and my word in you, then you
[1:06:15] know who you are. or ask what you will,
[1:06:18] it will be given to you.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus told him, he said,
[1:06:23] "Destroy this temple in three days, I'll
[1:06:25] raise it up." Why was he able to have
[1:06:26] that confidence in the word? See, that's
[1:06:28] what we need is confidence in the word.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Our young people need confidence in the
[1:06:32] word.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; When you go to school, when you go to
[1:06:34] work, you Why do you dress the way you
[1:06:36] do? Why do you act the way you do?
[1:06:38] Because I believe the word.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Right. And there needs to be a
[1:06:42] confidence in that word.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Right. I'm I'm going to go in a rapture
[1:06:46] one day.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; The devil can't discourage me. He can't
[1:06:49] put a spirit of suicide on me or a
[1:06:51] spirit of making me think I'm unworthy
[1:06:53] all the time. I know I'm unworthy, but
[1:06:56] he called me. I know who I am. I know
[1:06:58] where I belong. I know what I know what
[1:07:00] the what place I hold in the position of
[1:07:02] the body of Christ.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Destroy this
[1:07:06] temple and in three days I'll raise it
[1:07:08] up."
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; What kind of confidence could we have in
[1:07:11] the word if we knew that we were Mrs.
[1:07:13] Jesus Christ. If he knew he was Mr.
[1:07:16] Jesus Christ, he was the one that would
[1:07:18] raise from the dead, then we know if we
[1:07:20] are in him, we'll raise with him.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "But if the spirit of
[1:07:24] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:07:26] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[1:07:28] from the dead shall also." Someone say,
[1:07:30] "Also, it'll also quicken your mortal
[1:07:33] body by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:07:35] you." What's he saying? If he raised him
[1:07:38] up, he'll raise you up. You don't have
[1:07:40] to give up on the word to have a good
[1:07:41] life. You don't have to have to
[1:07:43] compromise with the world to have a
[1:07:45] victorious life. You can have the mind
[1:07:47] of Christ and know what he wants done
[1:07:49] with the word.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; I believe the bride has that today.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a lot of people need
[1:07:55] healing right now. Listen, the Bible
[1:07:58] says we're already healed.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; He said by his stripes we are healed.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; But can you know who you are today? Can
[1:08:05] you get a revelation of that? Say by his
[1:08:07] stripes I am healed.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; I am healed. I belong in that scripture.
[1:08:12] That's having the mind of Christ. He
[1:08:13] knew who he was. He thought in not
[1:08:15] robbery.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; He wasn't taking something that didn't
[1:08:18] belong to him.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Oh church, if we could only recognize
[1:08:21] who we are, it's not robbery for you to
[1:08:23] be the bride. It's not it's not a
[1:08:26] boasting for you to say that you're the
[1:08:28] wife of Jesus Christ, that you belong to
[1:08:30] him. That's just who you are.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; It's just who you are. You didn't make
[1:08:35] yourself that. He made you that.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You didn't put yourself in the word. It
[1:08:39] wasn't by study and theological books
[1:08:42] and everything else to put you in it.
[1:08:43] No, you you understand the word the way
[1:08:45] you do because he called you from the
[1:08:47] foundation of the world to understand
[1:08:49] it.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:53] [snorts]
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Then our confidence doesn't lay in a
[1:08:55] preacher or a church or a situation, but
[1:08:58] it lays in Christ.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:05] Now, what does he say?
[1:09:07] He tells us that if we have the mind of
[1:09:09] Christ,
[1:09:11] [snorts] we've got to condescend
[1:09:14] to others.
[1:09:16] See, he recognized who he was. He
[1:09:18] thought it not robbery, equal [snorts]
[1:09:20] with God,
[1:09:22] but we condescend. That word condescend
[1:09:23] is interesting. Paul uses it in Romans
[1:09:26] 12:16.
[1:09:28] He said, "Be of the same mind one toward
[1:09:30] another.
[1:09:32] Mind not high things, but condescend to
[1:09:35] men of low estate.
[1:09:37] condescend. Now, when we think of
[1:09:38] someone that's condescending, that's a
[1:09:40] negative thing, right?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Right. He's condescending means you're
[1:09:43] up here and they're down here and you're
[1:09:45] talking down to somebody.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; But that's not what he's [snorts]
[1:09:48] talking about. It's not talking down.
[1:09:50] It's coming down.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Coming down. [snorts]
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you can hear me today.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; So, it's not that you're up here saying,
[1:09:58] "Well, I'm the bride. I belong to a
[1:10:00] message church and these people are
[1:10:02] struggling and so I I'm going to stand
[1:10:04] up here and talk down to them and have a
[1:10:06] little pity on them, you know? No, it's
[1:10:08] coming down,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; right? Because the thing is we're human
[1:10:12] beings. And I think God leaves us this
[1:10:15] way. There's a certain element of
[1:10:17] humanity in everything that we do, even
[1:10:19] in our preaching. Even, you know, how I
[1:10:21] feel affects how I preach.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; You know, people don't want to believe
[1:10:26] that people are human, but it's true.
[1:10:28] How you feel affects how you preach. How
[1:10:30] you feel affects how you sing. You know
[1:10:32] that's right. When you come to church,
[1:10:33] how you feel. Your attitude before you
[1:10:35] get to church affects the service.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Right. And how you feel. If you're sick,
[1:10:39] if you're worried, if you're tired, it
[1:10:41] affects the service. You got to fight
[1:10:43] through that.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And but there's a certain amount of
[1:10:45] that. Our humanity reminds us, listen,
[1:10:48] that's why Jesus was made a man. He was
[1:10:51] a great high priest who could be touched
[1:10:53] by the feeling of our infirmities.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; We're human beings. We're not we're not
[1:10:57] a bunch of super men. We're not some
[1:10:59] great and listen, we read the message of
[1:11:01] what he says about what the bride will
[1:11:03] be. And many times we look at that and
[1:11:04] say, "Well, we're going to be some kind
[1:11:05] of superman that's able to just speak
[1:11:07] everything and and we won't have any
[1:11:09] trouble with money and we won't have any
[1:11:11] trouble with our kids and we won't have
[1:11:12] any trouble with sickness." But that's
[1:11:14] not what he said at all.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; That's not who Jesus was.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he healed he
[1:11:20] raised a sick baby from the dead and
[1:11:22] went back and sat on a rock and groaned
[1:11:23] with a headache.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Why? He was human being just like you
[1:11:27] and I are.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; And so many times we're reminded of our
[1:11:30] humanity because it allows us to
[1:11:33] condescend.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Right. Not to talk down to somebody, but
[1:11:37] to come down to somebody
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; to find that person that's weak or weary
[1:11:42] or been or made horrible choices and
[1:11:44] done horrible things and not to look
[1:11:46] down on them. Not to say, "Well, they
[1:11:48] could never be a Christian." But to say,
[1:11:49] "The same God that brought me up out of
[1:11:52] the pit can bring you up out of the pit.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Have this mind. He says, have the mind
[1:11:59] that allows you to come down
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; where people are.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; It's to willingly
[1:12:10] lower oneself
[1:12:12] out of love and compassion
[1:12:15] to help someone in an inferior
[1:12:17] condition.
[1:12:19] Oh my. Philippians 2:7
[1:12:23] says, "He made himself."
[1:12:28] It's one of the most touching things you
[1:12:29] can read in the scripture.
[1:12:31] He made himself
[1:12:34] of no reputation.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Made himself,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Think about that. He created himself,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; No reputation.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. took upon him the form
[1:12:49] the the mask the morphe of a servant was
[1:12:53] made in the likeness
[1:12:55] of men.
[1:12:57] See he he was in the form of God with
[1:13:00] the attributes of God but he chose to
[1:13:02] take on the form of a servant with the
[1:13:06] attributes of a servant.
[1:13:09] [clears throat]
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Right? When he came down, he didn't come
[1:13:12] down as a baby
[1:13:15] knowit-all,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; right? He didn't come down as a baby who
[1:13:19] could talk.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He come down as a baby who cried.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't come down into our world into
[1:13:29] a rich palace somewhere. He didn't
[1:13:31] arrange the details so that he would
[1:13:34] enter our world in a strong way but in a
[1:13:37] weak way. Right.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Right. And he made himself in the form
[1:13:44] of a servant. He became weak to save the
[1:13:47] weak. [snorts]
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And when he was on earth, the Bible
[1:13:50] said, he made himself no reputation.
[1:13:53] Yet he was the creator.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Look at Colossians 1:16. For by him were
[1:13:59] all things. Someone say all things
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; created that are in heaven that are in
[1:14:04] earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:14:06] be thrones or dominions or
[1:14:08] principalities or powers all things were
[1:14:11] created by him and for him. So he
[1:14:13] created God did the situation.
[1:14:17] I hope you're hearing me today that he
[1:14:19] would be born into the earth in he
[1:14:22] created the details of life that he
[1:14:26] would come down and dwell among us in.
[1:14:29] He created that situation
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; to be a certain way.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, all of us do that to some extent.
[1:14:36] We're we're miniature creators.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Right. And we create our situation of
[1:14:41] life.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; We do that. How how do we do it? Well,
[1:14:44] we do it with our words. We know that
[1:14:46] the spoken word, but we do it in other
[1:14:47] ways as well. You men work.
[1:14:50] Many of you, some of you ladies have to,
[1:14:51] you work and you're out and you try to
[1:14:53] do things and and you try to create an
[1:14:56] environment around you that would be
[1:14:59] fitting that you'd want to live in,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; right? So, you get yourself a chair.
[1:15:05] My wife's been trying to get me to buy
[1:15:06] another lazy boy because we only have
[1:15:08] one. You know,
[1:15:10] why would we do that? Why spend the
[1:15:11] money on a on a good chair? Because it's
[1:15:14] comfortable. There's nothing better than
[1:15:15] a lazy boy. I can vouch for it.
[1:15:18] But you know, if you
[1:15:21] if you what are we doing? We're creating
[1:15:23] an environment that's comfortable,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; right? We could live with less.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. All of us could,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; but we want the best for ourselves
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; now. Come on. We're human, right?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; We want the best for ourselves. We want
[1:15:36] an air conditioned car. We want an
[1:15:38] upgraded truck,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; right? With all the bells and whistles.
[1:15:41] I got my truck and I'm I'm sitting there
[1:15:43] looking at my truck one day and I
[1:15:44] realized that the back of the new truck
[1:15:46] split in two and mine didn't have that
[1:15:48] option and I've been wanting that ever
[1:15:49] since.
[1:15:52] And Trip's got a truck with a handle on
[1:15:54] it and a step like an old grandpa, you
[1:15:56] know, and I need that handle in that
[1:15:58] step. [laughter]
[1:16:01] What am I doing? Creating myself a world
[1:16:03] to live in
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; on a human level. You understand?
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Right. But what what is what are we what
[1:16:09] did Jesus do? He who had all the power
[1:16:13] to create any situation
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; to control every situation and make it
[1:16:18] come to pass
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; chose to be born.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Chose to be born in poverty. Chose to
[1:16:26] come into the world and have to learn
[1:16:28] things.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; He chose to learn obedience by the
[1:16:34] things that he suffered. When he took on
[1:16:37] flesh, he chose not to be like a god
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; but to be like a man.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Just think
[1:16:46] brother Brandham said who he was. He was
[1:16:48] the logos that come from God in the
[1:16:49] beginning. He was the word of God. He
[1:16:51] was the angel of God that was with the
[1:16:53] children of Israel in the wilderness. He
[1:16:55] was the great supernatural of heaven.
[1:16:57] None other than Jehovah himself had come
[1:16:58] down here on the earth and become a man.
[1:17:00] Not only a man, but he become the
[1:17:02] servant of man. took upon himself a make
[1:17:05] of no reputation,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; but become a footwasher.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; And he went to the lowest city in the
[1:17:11] world, Jericho. I love this. He said he
[1:17:14] was so low till the smallest man of the
[1:17:17] city had to climb a tree to look at him.
[1:17:21] To look down at him.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus looked up at the tree and said,
[1:17:24] "Zakius."
[1:17:27] Oh, he had to get in a position beneath
[1:17:29] Zakius to save Zakius. He had to come in
[1:17:33] the form of a man. He had to come as the
[1:17:35] lowest of men. He had to come in the
[1:17:37] form of a footwash flunk. He had to come
[1:17:39] in the form of a servant to save me and
[1:17:41] save you. Oh, we ought to worship him
[1:17:43] like never before.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; We ought to worship him every day of the
[1:17:46] week, not just at Christmas time or on
[1:17:48] the uh some holiday or even on Sundays.
[1:17:51] We ought to worship him because our life
[1:17:52] should be worshiped to him
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; because of what he did for us.
[1:17:58] God raised him up, put him so high above
[1:18:01] every heaven until he has to stoop over
[1:18:04] to look to heaven.
[1:18:07] Oh my. That's what God did for him. He
[1:18:09] said, "So if you want to be exalted,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; humble yourself. If you exalt yourself,
[1:18:15] you'll be brought down low."
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Right? [snorts]
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Again, he said Jesus went along doing
[1:18:19] good, going to the poor and needy. He
[1:18:21] never made of himself any reputation. Do
[1:18:23] you ever think of that? He made himself
[1:18:24] of no reputation. Listen to this is
[1:18:27] astounding. The man that made an
[1:18:29] artificial tooth
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; made a reputation for himself.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; He did. Now, you may not know his name,
[1:18:36] but you can go on the internet and find
[1:18:37] it,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; right? There's a man who first made the
[1:18:41] artificial tooth, and he still has a
[1:18:42] Wikipedia page,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; but Jesus didn't Oh, God. He didn't have
[1:18:50] anybody sitting there writing, recording
[1:18:52] every moment. We don't even know very
[1:18:54] few things about his first 12 years of
[1:18:55] life. And then there's another several
[1:18:57] years before he turned 30. We don't know
[1:18:59] hardly anything about what he was doing.
[1:19:02] He didn't have somebody there recording
[1:19:03] every moment of his life.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Why? He come with no reputation.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He made himself, oh God, of no
[1:19:10] reputation. Listen, I know this is the
[1:19:12] age of making yourself a reputation. I
[1:19:15] know this is the age of a social media
[1:19:16] account and putting yourself out there.
[1:19:18] and our young people, we want to have
[1:19:20] the most likes and and be out there and
[1:19:23] have a tick tock thing that works or
[1:19:25] something. And God bless you if you can
[1:19:26] make that work for you. But that should
[1:19:28] not be the goal of our life. It should
[1:19:30] not control our emotions.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Jesus made himself of no
[1:19:37] reputation.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; His what do they call that? The Q
[1:19:41] factor. Right. That's what that the the
[1:19:44] ability to be known. What's your Q
[1:19:47] factor? Jesus come with a zero. That's
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Known by nobody.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; There were only brother Brandham, I
[1:19:54] think he said six. There were six or
[1:19:55] eight believers in that time.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Just a very few that he could come to
[1:20:00] and tell him who he was.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And then the shepherds and the magi and
[1:20:03] different ones come. But there was a
[1:20:05] very few who believed.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Even when he died, by the time he died,
[1:20:10] even his disciples forsook him.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; They left him there. Even Peter who
[1:20:14] said, "I'll never leave you."
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And Jesus said, "You'll deny me
[1:20:18] three times." Then he does.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He died alone on the cross.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; The man who made an artificial tooth
[1:20:28] made a reputation. But the one who made
[1:20:29] the real tooth made of himself no
[1:20:32] reputation.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; The man that made an artificial arm made
[1:20:34] a reputation for himself.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; But the man who made the real arm made
[1:20:38] of himself no reputation.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "The way up is down." Always
[1:20:41] remember that. Be humble. Be sweet and
[1:20:45] kind. Amen. That's part of the word,
[1:20:48] too, right?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Listen now. He said, "Be creative."
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You're creating something.
[1:20:56] [clears throat]
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; If you wallow in self-pity, you create
[1:20:59] an atmosphere of self-pity.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; If you wallow in sin, you create an
[1:21:06] atmosphere of sin. Right?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; If you're if you spend your mind and
[1:21:09] your time on those things, but if you
[1:21:11] let this mind be in you, which was also
[1:21:13] in Christ Jesus, you create an
[1:21:15] atmosphere of creation. He said, "Be
[1:21:17] creative. Let Christ be in you. Be
[1:21:20] sweet. Be kind." He wasn't telling you
[1:21:21] to to take up photography or start to
[1:21:24] draw or do an artist. That's fine. If
[1:21:26] you do, that's creative the way we think
[1:21:28] about it. But he's saying be a creator.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Be creative.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Let Christ be in you.
[1:21:36] Let this mind,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; the creative mind. So I he said, I want
[1:21:42] you to create, but I want you to create
[1:21:45] what he created.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to create a reputation.
[1:21:50] Church, as a church, we ought to have a
[1:21:52] reputation.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; What reputation should we have? The
[1:21:56] reputation that he had.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He made himself of no reputation. He
[1:22:01] made himself not seem like a a big
[1:22:04] thing. Oh, I hope we hold on to that. I
[1:22:06] know we're we're not a huge church and
[1:22:09] we're not for a message church. We're
[1:22:10] not a really small church, but I'll say
[1:22:12] this. We've created no reputation.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; There there's no reputation in going to
[1:22:20] Word of Life Tabernacle. But I'll say
[1:22:22] this. I believe that in doing that, we
[1:22:24] can help somebody. If we can just keep
[1:22:26] oursel with no reputation, if we keep
[1:22:28] oursel with nothing to lose, then we're
[1:22:30] not afraid to reach out to the vilest
[1:22:32] sinner and bring them back up.
[1:22:37] [snorts]
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; If you create yourself a reputation,
[1:22:40] let it be the reputation he created.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; See, Christ created the conditions,
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; think about this,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; that made him
[1:22:51] the story go out that he was an
[1:22:53] illegitimate child.
[1:22:58] He created that.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And we get mad if people call us a cult
[1:23:02] or something like that.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That's what they called him, too.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Far worse.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Right. They called him an illegitimate
[1:23:11] child
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; cuz they thought that there was no way
[1:23:15] that what that that he was born of the
[1:23:17] Holy Ghost. They thought
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; that he was a an illegitimate child.
[1:23:21] That's right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about that now.
[1:23:25] Think honestly with me.
[1:23:27] If you could create yourself a
[1:23:29] reputation,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; what would it be? We all have a
[1:23:33] reputation of some kind,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; But brother Paul, if you could create
[1:23:36] one,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; what would it be?
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I think we're learning that on social
[1:23:43] media.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; It's like an experiment in sociology or
[1:23:47] psychology where people are creating
[1:23:49] reputations for themselves.
[1:23:52] Right? And even some of them creating
[1:23:53] reputations of of illegitimacy and
[1:23:56] reputations of of adultery and
[1:23:58] reputations of of evil,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; right? And they do it on purpose,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; like a rapper. I'm not talking about
[1:24:06] something you wrap gifts in. I'm talking
[1:24:08] about the guys who get up and say things
[1:24:09] and call it music,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; right? A rapper has to have a
[1:24:15] reputation. Boy, I've gone way a field
[1:24:17] in this sermon. A a rapper has to have a
[1:24:20] reputation. He He's got So they'll get
[1:24:22] in trouble with the law almost on
[1:24:24] purpose
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; to have a reputation of being a bad guy
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; cuz that's how they sell CDs or whatever
[1:24:32] it is they sell now, right? That's how
[1:24:35] they sell records is is to they're
[1:24:37] creating themselves a reputation. What
[1:24:40] kind of reputation ought we to have?
[1:24:42] Well, I think we ought to have the same
[1:24:43] reputation he did. The same he made
[1:24:45] himself of no reputation.
[1:24:48] to be able to reach us.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; So he tells us to be creative. But what
[1:24:52] would we create if we had the
[1:24:53] opportunity? If you had unlimited power,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; how powerful would you be?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all would be the pastor.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you ladies, if you had
[1:25:09] unlimited power in the kitchen,
[1:25:13] what kind of a cook would you be?
[1:25:18] Move aside, Bobby Fle. You know,
[1:25:22] Huh? Now, come on.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to use an older reference
[1:25:26] for some of y'all, but but what kind of
[1:25:29] a create what kind of a reputation would
[1:25:32] you create? You realize that's why we in
[1:25:34] our sticky natures, we we get mad at
[1:25:36] each other. Most of the time, it's a
[1:25:38] it's a fight for reputation.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; It's one person fussing with another
[1:25:43] about reputation. I want to be known as
[1:25:45] the best cook
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; or the one in charge or or the best
[1:25:50] preacher.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Preachers can be the worst.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Creating ourselves reputations.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we we're afraid to even listen
[1:26:00] to somebody preach because that would
[1:26:01] hurt our reputation to go and listen to
[1:26:03] a man preach.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; We're afraid to go preach somewhere. I'm
[1:26:08] just preaching my heart this morning
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; because it would hurt our reputation.
[1:26:12] But Jesus went down to Simon's house
[1:26:14] even though he knew they were there to
[1:26:15] make fun of him. But he went down
[1:26:17] because there was a woman there with no
[1:26:19] reputation
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; who would wash his feet
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; who could be saved who had
[1:26:24] representation in heaven.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could create yourself a
[1:26:30] reputation as a fisherman,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; what kind of a reputation would you
[1:26:37] create?
[1:26:39] I I feel this like deeply
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; because I love to fish.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to let you in on
[1:26:45] something. I'm not very good at it.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; But I love to fish. You didn't have to
[1:26:52] agree with me.
[1:26:55] I love to fish
[1:26:57] and I'd love, you know, and I don't post
[1:26:59] all the little ones.
[1:27:03] And you know that's right, Trip. You
[1:27:04] know, I went with trip fishing one time
[1:27:08] and when I went fishing, he didn't care
[1:27:09] much about the fish, but I went fishing
[1:27:12] and and and and we don't we catch all
[1:27:14] them little bitty trout. We don't post
[1:27:16] none of them, but let me catch one of
[1:27:17] them trout that get released from the
[1:27:19] hatchery, you know?
[1:27:22] That's the one I post.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; If I could create myself, I want you to
[1:27:27] think about this this morning. If I
[1:27:28] could create myself a reputation as a
[1:27:30] fisherman, what would my reputation be?
[1:27:33] Come on.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Right. It'd be Bill Dance or, you know,
[1:27:37] whoever is the fisherman now that people
[1:27:40] look up to.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; See, if you could create a reputation as
[1:27:45] a hunter,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; I used fishing first so I wouldn't make
[1:27:49] you so mad, you know.
[1:27:52] But if you could create a reputation,
[1:27:54] what would it be?
[1:27:56] Oh my. Well, that's why you buy all the
[1:27:58] stuff, right? That's why I have so many
[1:28:00] fishing poles. I want to create a
[1:28:02] reputation. Most of them I've never
[1:28:03] used,
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; but I want to create a reputation as a
[1:28:07] fisherman.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; You want to create a reputation as a
[1:28:10] hunter. But when he came down,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; oh God, he was he was it was the
[1:28:17] almighty God who poured himself. The B
[1:28:19] said, "All that was in God, he poured
[1:28:20] into Christ."
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; God poured himself out in the earth. It
[1:28:24] was a man with no reputation.
[1:28:28] [snorts]
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:30] Amen. See, the reputation that you would
[1:28:33] create for yourself speaks of your
[1:28:35] character and maybe how long you've
[1:28:37] lived because some people live long
[1:28:40] enough to realize that reputation ain't
[1:28:41] everything.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And maybe you don't want to be known by
[1:28:45] everybody and fame has its consequences,
[1:28:48] right?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; So maybe you've lived long enough to
[1:28:50] understand that, but a lot of people
[1:28:51] haven't. But the reputation you would
[1:28:54] create for yourself speaks of your
[1:28:55] character. You create what you are. I'm
[1:28:58] going to go real deep here for a minute,
[1:29:00] but I hope you I hope you get a hold of
[1:29:01] a little bit of it. Look, in the third
[1:29:03] pull, when it come to when it come to
[1:29:06] the earth in the spoken word in that
[1:29:07] form to show us the power of what the
[1:29:09] word could do,
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; right? Brother Brandham said the first
[1:29:12] time it was ever on a gentile woman was
[1:29:15] on a hady right.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; It couldn't have been on a preacher.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Because a preacher would have created a
[1:29:25] reputation with it.
[1:29:28] I hope you're hearing me, church.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Now, God brought brother Brandham's
[1:29:32] through some things so that he would be
[1:29:33] at a place where he could he could do
[1:29:35] that and he could work in that realm,
[1:29:37] but he's wanted to bring us all to that
[1:29:38] place. Not to brother Brandham's gift,
[1:29:40] but to that level of faith,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; right? But when he come to a woman, what
[1:29:44] did he come to? He come, brother
[1:29:46] Brandham says he did it on purpose. He
[1:29:48] said he had to come to somebody who
[1:29:49] would say the right thing.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Her reputation was so little.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that she didn't care what people
[1:29:57] thought
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; about her following a divine healer.
[1:30:00] Yet, her sister was sick
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and sat in church for years unable to be
[1:30:05] healed. And that may have created a bad
[1:30:07] reputation. Her her lack of money, her
[1:30:09] lack of resources might have created no
[1:30:11] reputation for her. She might have not
[1:30:13] been able to do anything, but she's
[1:30:14] famous around the world today, not for
[1:30:16] having money, not even for having her
[1:30:18] healing, but she's famous around the
[1:30:20] world because she created of herself no
[1:30:22] reputation. And when the word spoke to
[1:30:25] her, she said, "It's nothing but the
[1:30:27] truth."
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So, what is humility? It's humbling
[1:30:31] yourself to the word
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; until when the word speaks, you can say,
[1:30:35] "I know you're right, Lord."
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; She said, "It's nothing but the truth."
[1:30:43] And what happened? She was able to speak
[1:30:45] because God knew that what she would
[1:30:47] create
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; wouldn't be money.
[1:30:52] Come on. [snorts]
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; I've often told you
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; if I could heal everybody in our church
[1:30:59] and we could all just be well all the
[1:31:00] time, I would do it.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I hate to see people suffer. I don't
[1:31:05] want to see people hurt.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I want to see you well. I want to see
[1:31:08] you doing good. If I could create money
[1:31:10] in your bank accounts, I'd do it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; But there's a reason why God doesn't
[1:31:13] give me that power.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Money wouldn't do us all the good we
[1:31:18] might think it would do. Now, even
[1:31:19] healing, sometimes it wouldn't do us the
[1:31:21] good that we think it would do.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we get in a little better
[1:31:24] situation and we forget about God.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; We get a little bit of money and we
[1:31:28] begin to forget about God. But oh, if we
[1:31:30] could only humble ourselves to the word,
[1:31:32] Lord, no matter what kind of a
[1:31:34] reputation I have, no matter how much
[1:31:36] money I've got or don't have, let me be
[1:31:38] willing to bow myself to your word. Let
[1:31:40] me be willing to worship you. Let me be
[1:31:42] willing to come to church and condescend
[1:31:45] myself, lower myself to help a sinner
[1:31:47] somewhere, to help the family member
[1:31:49] that's been lost. Let me be willing to
[1:31:51] do that.
[1:31:55] [snorts]
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; We will just close when it gets time. I
[1:32:00] don't have time to get through
[1:32:01] everything, but [snorts]
[1:32:03] the mind of Christ was to condescend to
[1:32:06] come down.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; The mind of Lucifer was to lift himself
[1:32:10] up.
[1:32:12] Right?
[1:32:14] Isaiah 14:13. For thou hast said in
[1:32:16] thine heart.
[1:32:18] Notice this is his mindset. I will
[1:32:21] ascend into heaven.
[1:32:23] I [snorts] will exalt my throne above
[1:32:24] the stars of God. I will sit also upon
[1:32:26] the mount of the congregation and the
[1:32:28] sides of the north. I will ascend above
[1:32:30] the heights of the clouds. I will be
[1:32:32] like the most high. Yet thou shalt be
[1:32:35] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[1:32:37] pit. What is it? One mind condescends
[1:32:39] and is lifted up. Another is to is to be
[1:32:42] lifted up. That's his mind is to be
[1:32:43] lifted up. And he's brought low.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; But the mind of Christ is to lower
[1:32:48] yourself for the sake of someone else.
[1:32:49] Look at Ezekiel chapter 21. Ezekiel
[1:32:52] 21:25. It says, "Thou profane, wicked
[1:32:55] prince of Israel." He's talking about a
[1:32:56] king of Israel.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're a profane, wicked
[1:33:00] prince whose day is come when iniquity
[1:33:02] shall have an end."
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe he's speaking of more
[1:33:06] than just a natural king, but the god of
[1:33:08] this evil age.
[1:33:10] Right. He said, "Thus sayith the Lord
[1:33:12] God, remove the diadem. Take off the
[1:33:14] crown. This shall not be the same. Exalt
[1:33:17] him that is low. Abase him that is
[1:33:19] high."
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He said, "You're
[1:33:21] going to lose your crown because of your
[1:33:23] attitude. You're going to lose your
[1:33:24] crown because of the mindset that you
[1:33:26] have."
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. Paul said, "Take
[1:33:29] heed. He that standeth, take heed lest
[1:33:31] he fall." You can't fall unless you're
[1:33:33] standing up,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be careful not to be
[1:33:39] lifted up in our minds, but to
[1:33:41] condescend, to bring ourselves down low,
[1:33:43] and to recognize, yeah, we know who we
[1:33:45] are. We know we're the bride. We've got
[1:33:47] confidence in the word, but we have no
[1:33:49] confidence in the flesh.
[1:33:53] [snorts]
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; The mind of Christ to lower yourself for
[1:33:55] the sake of someone else. Look, he said,
[1:33:58] "Take off the crown. Exalt him that is
[1:34:00] low. Obase him that is high. I will
[1:34:01] overturn overturn overturn
[1:34:06] [snorts]
[1:34:06] I don't know I don't I didn't find
[1:34:08] brother brother Brandham said anything
[1:34:09] about it I know the commentaries say
[1:34:10] that that speaking of the three
[1:34:12] overturns of the of the house of Israel
[1:34:14] there was three different times that the
[1:34:16] that the kingdom was taken away be
[1:34:19] restored and taken away again restored
[1:34:20] and finally taken away for the final
[1:34:22] time he said and it shall be no more
[1:34:26] but I love this until he come
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; whose right it is
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; I'll give it to him.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, you made yourself a
[1:34:35] reputation. You put a crown on your
[1:34:37] head. You wanted to be lifted up above
[1:34:39] the people, but he said, I'm not going
[1:34:41] to give you the crown. I'm going to take
[1:34:42] the crown away from you. I'll overturn
[1:34:44] it. I'll overturn it. Listen, you might
[1:34:46] have thought a lot of things about
[1:34:47] yourself. You might have thought, well,
[1:34:48] I'm going to do this in life or I'm
[1:34:49] going to do that in life. But there's
[1:34:51] coming a time he's going to overturn
[1:34:53] that thinking. But he said, I'll give it
[1:34:54] to one whose right it is, and I'll give
[1:34:56] it to him. Listen, Jesus, it was his
[1:35:00] right to be the son of David. It was his
[1:35:02] right to be king. But how did he obtain
[1:35:04] the kingship? By coming down in our
[1:35:06] world, by lowering himself, coming as a
[1:35:08] servant, putting on a servant's mask.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; So, what is humility?
[1:35:14] What [snorts] is the mind of Christ?
[1:35:16] It's not taking
[1:35:18] your rights.
[1:35:20] [snorts] It's having rights and not
[1:35:23] taking your rights,
[1:35:25] but taking what he gives you. Are you
[1:35:27] with me now?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Philippians 2:9, wherefore God also hath
[1:35:32] highly exalted him and given him a name
[1:35:35] which is above every name. We're
[1:35:37] supposed to be like him. How many want
[1:35:38] to be like him this morning?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; He said in 1 Peter 5:5, "Likewise, you
[1:35:42] younger, submit yourselves under the
[1:35:44] elder. Hey, all of you be subject one to
[1:35:46] another." All of you be subject one to
[1:35:49] another.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; How do you do that? You recognize that a
[1:35:53] pastor is an authority in the church.
[1:35:55] Deacons are in authority in the church,
[1:35:57] but the way that you exercise that
[1:35:59] authority is not by exercising lordship,
[1:36:02] but by exercising servantthood,
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; right? It's the proper posture of the
[1:36:07] pastor to be a servant to the people.
[1:36:09] It's the proper posture of the deacons,
[1:36:11] to be a servant of the people or the
[1:36:12] trustees or whoever else. You're not
[1:36:14] there to tell people what to do. You're
[1:36:16] there to be a servant to people.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Even though you have a right. Are you
[1:36:21] with me now?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; But you're there to help.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:5, "You're younger, submit
[1:36:27] yourself to the elder. All you be
[1:36:28] subjects one to another, and be clothed
[1:36:31] with humility.
[1:36:33] For God resisteth the proud, and giveth
[1:36:35] grace to [snorts] the humble." Aren't
[1:36:37] you glad for that?
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves, therefore, under the
[1:36:40] mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
[1:36:43] you in due time, casting all your care
[1:36:47] upon him,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; for he carth
[1:36:51] for you. Yes. [snorts]
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; So, in not claiming our rights, we're
[1:36:54] not just talking about so, well, I have
[1:36:56] a right to this, to to dress this way or
[1:36:58] to act this way. You do, but you give up
[1:37:01] your rights to be a sheep, right? To be
[1:37:03] shorn. You give up your rights to be
[1:37:06] taken into the to the church and all
[1:37:09] that shorn off of you, right?
[1:37:11] and and and brother Brandham talks about
[1:37:13] that many times, but it's not just that,
[1:37:15] but it's it's actually your right to
[1:37:19] think a certain way, your right to think
[1:37:21] about yourself a certain way. Lord, let
[1:37:24] me think about myself the way you think
[1:37:26] about me.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; So, it's your right to pity yourself.
[1:37:30] Your right to have a a pity party. Your
[1:37:33] right to to stand there and say, "Well,
[1:37:35] nobody loves me and everybody hates me."
[1:37:36] No, I'm going to think like the word
[1:37:38] thinks. I'm going to talk like the word
[1:37:40] talks. I'm going to be what the word
[1:37:41] says I can be.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; You're you're giving away your rights
[1:37:46] for the rights of another,
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; For his rights.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Listen,
[1:37:54] brother said, "So just love him with all
[1:37:56] your heart and forget all you ever know
[1:37:58] about all other things but Jesus
[1:38:00] Christ." How many could do that this
[1:38:02] morning? Forget all you ever know about
[1:38:04] all other things but Jesus Christ. Just
[1:38:06] go ahead and love him and work for him.
[1:38:08] serve him. If he wants you to be the
[1:38:10] doormat, well, you just be the doormat.
[1:38:12] It's whatever he wants you to do, you do
[1:38:14] it. How many can say amen to that today?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, people want power
[1:38:17] really. They don't know what power is.
[1:38:19] See, they don't really know what goes
[1:38:20] with it. The way up is down always. If
[1:38:22] you want power, see how humble you can
[1:38:24] get.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Get away from all your worldly thinking
[1:38:26] and humble yourself before God, and then
[1:38:28] you've got more power than the man that
[1:38:30] runs all over the building, makes a big
[1:38:32] lot of noise. See, because you've been
[1:38:33] able to conquer yourself. commit
[1:38:36] yourself to Christ, you see, to humble
[1:38:37] yourself before him. That's really
[1:38:39] power.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; You show me a church.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; We all want to be a church, don't we?
[1:38:46] That's that that's strong. We want to be
[1:38:48] a strong church. We want to be a church
[1:38:50] that's that's known for our strength.
[1:38:52] But look what he says. You show me a
[1:38:53] church that's humble.
[1:38:56] Show me a church that's real humble, not
[1:38:59] an arrogancy, a church, just a sweet,
[1:39:01] humble church. I'll show you a church
[1:39:03] that has the favor and power of God in
[1:39:05] it. Listen, everybody wants to testify.
[1:39:08] We've had many healings. We've testified
[1:39:10] of our healing. We've had many people
[1:39:12] come to the come to church and be saved
[1:39:14] and be baptized. We're glad of that. But
[1:39:16] I'll say this that we don't want that to
[1:39:18] be our reputation, but let our
[1:39:19] reputation be a humble church, a sweet
[1:39:22] church, somebody that could love
[1:39:23] somebody. He said, "I'll show you a
[1:39:25] church that has the favor and power of
[1:39:27] God in it. I want his favor today. I
[1:39:29] want his mind to be in me.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; [snorts and sighs]
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. That's the
[1:39:40] thing. It takes [snorts] humility,
[1:39:43] humbling ourselves before God, letting
[1:39:46] God just work through us.
[1:39:49] Don't have to make a lot of noise. I
[1:39:52] believe in noise. I believe in revival.
[1:39:55] But be humble at first.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Be sweet first."
[1:40:00] What are some real examples of a creator
[1:40:03] [snorts]
[1:40:03] condescending? Can I have I got three
[1:40:05] more minutes. Can I have that three
[1:40:07] minutes?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Can we?
[1:40:11] Maybe four.
[1:40:14] Somebody give me five. [snorts]
[1:40:18] [laughter]
[1:40:19] She gave me five. I'll be all right.
[1:40:22] Brother Brandham
[1:40:24] illustrated that for us, right? You
[1:40:26] talked about being a creator and then it
[1:40:27] the famous story that all of our sisters
[1:40:29] love so much about. But brother Brandon
[1:40:32] putting on an apron,
[1:40:34] but what was that? See, he had two
[1:40:37] things he could do about that situation.
[1:40:39] See, he can change it in two ways.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; One of two ways. He can be a lord,
[1:40:45] right? Sarah called Abraham Lord. He can
[1:40:47] be a lord in his house and tell her what
[1:40:49] to do.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Or [snorts] he can humble himself.
[1:40:55] A lot of marriages break up because
[1:40:57] somebody's not willing to humble
[1:40:58] themselves,
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe even if you have a right to be
[1:41:03] offended
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; or a right to be mad, you just choose
[1:41:06] not to
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; because you love that person,
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no doubt that brother
[1:41:12] Brandham's work at that time was was so
[1:41:15] important,
[1:41:16] right? He was a prophet of God. People
[1:41:19] were laying sick and unable to come in
[1:41:21] and the house was in a chaos,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; right, because of his work.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; But he willingly, right, took on the
[1:41:28] mind of Christ, the nature of Christ,
[1:41:31] condescended to put an apron on and help
[1:41:34] her with the dishes,
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; pat her on the back, tell her he'd buy
[1:41:37] her a new dress.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; It's like, but brother Ben, that's
[1:41:41] putting on. No, it's not. It's lowering
[1:41:44] yourself.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; To think like a woman would think. Are
[1:41:48] you with me now? He had to think like
[1:41:50] she would think. Listen, when brother
[1:41:53] Brandham and and and me were having
[1:41:54] trouble with Rebecca, Brother Brandham
[1:41:56] told her, "We've got to think teenage
[1:41:57] thoughts."
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Right? For a lot of us old people, we
[1:42:02] got young people here in the church.
[1:42:03] We're We got a bunch of them.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; A lot of them aren't here today. We got
[1:42:07] a bunch of them. All these young people,
[1:42:09] we're going to have to think young
[1:42:10] thoughts.
[1:42:14] To be able to reach those young people,
[1:42:15] you got to think like a young person.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; You can't always think like a old
[1:42:20] person.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; But maybe you've been in a place, maybe
[1:42:25] you were raised in a better time when
[1:42:26] the world wasn't like it is today and
[1:42:28] social media wasn't crazy and people
[1:42:30] actually were sane. You remember those
[1:42:32] times, but can you condescend yourself
[1:42:34] down to be able to help somebody today?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; He had a right to be served,
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; but he chose to serve. Brother Brandon
[1:42:48] said it was projecting love. He said
[1:42:51] they were mine, my children, my wife,
[1:42:53] and I was God's. And then God giving his
[1:42:56] spirit and through that spirit with love
[1:42:58] to my family, sovereign grace came in
[1:43:02] and quietened the family.
[1:43:05] Part of our job as ministers
[1:43:08] is to quieten the church.
[1:43:11] I don't mean to [snorts] make it people
[1:43:14] not shout or something like that. That's
[1:43:15] not what I'm talking about. To quieten
[1:43:17] the nerves,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; right? Like cuz sheep get nervous when
[1:43:22] they can't see the shepherd.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; So part of the job as a minister,
[1:43:25] especially as a pastor, is to just be
[1:43:27] there.
[1:43:29] Some of y'all going to come back at me
[1:43:30] say, "Brother Ben, you're gone
[1:43:32] sometimes." s and sometimes we do have
[1:43:33] to go but but my job mainly is to be
[1:43:36] present
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; right and and why because that quietens
[1:43:41] the church a husband's job is to be
[1:43:44] present in the home because it quiet but
[1:43:47] listen to me there's a greater presence
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; and he comes down brother Joe in our
[1:43:53] midst
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; brother said that that feeling that we
[1:43:56] have is him he said you can't see see
[1:43:59] the pillar of fire all the time but you
[1:44:01] can feel its effects
[1:44:02] You can feel the presence of it. And
[1:44:04] that presence that you feel is him. He
[1:44:06] comes down on our level.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Comes down to fellowship. Oh, I don't
[1:44:10] think we ought to take it for granted,
[1:44:12] church. I think we ought to worship him
[1:44:13] when he comes.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to give him all the
[1:44:16] glory and all the praise and all the
[1:44:18] things that because he's given us so
[1:44:20] many things and he's come down among us
[1:44:23] to just stay with us and his presence
[1:44:25] quietens me. Listen, I can be going
[1:44:27] through a hard time. I can be at my
[1:44:29] wit's end, not know what to do as a
[1:44:31] pastor, but when his presence comes
[1:44:32] down, what does it do? It quietens my
[1:44:34] nerves. And the great shepherd, don't
[1:44:36] you want him to be present?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you want him to be in the home?
[1:44:40] Oh, let's invite him in our home. Let's
[1:44:42] invite him in the church.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Think like him.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Who had a right to be served [snorts]
[1:44:52] but chose to serve.
[1:44:55] As I've preached to you recently, we're
[1:44:56] often within our rights to be offended.
[1:44:59] But what if we just chose not to take
[1:45:01] offense?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; We're condescending.
[1:45:05] [snorts] We may have a right to a bad
[1:45:06] attitude.
[1:45:08] What if we changed our attitude for the
[1:45:10] sake of others?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It's the greatest sign of maturity in a
[1:45:14] young person, especially one that's
[1:45:16] getting a little bit older, looking for
[1:45:17] a spouse. The greatest sign of maturity
[1:45:20] is you you get somebody who willingly
[1:45:23] does things for others.
[1:45:25] at no benefit to themselves.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Find somebody who is a cheerful giver of
[1:45:32] their time, their abilities. Find
[1:45:35] somebody who's doing working in the
[1:45:37] church, doing everything they can for
[1:45:38] the kingdom of God. And you'll find
[1:45:41] somebody who's worth marrying.
[1:45:44] Why? Because it's a sign of maturity.
[1:45:46] It's a sign that the mind of Christ has
[1:45:48] become in them, begin to work its way
[1:45:51] out in character. 1 Corinthians 13 tells
[1:45:54] us that and I'll just read one of these
[1:45:56] verses, but it tells us that uh love or
[1:45:59] charity seeketh not her own. Verse 5,
[1:46:02] seeketh not her own. It means love does
[1:46:04] not insist on having its own way. And
[1:46:07] brother Brandham said he was that great
[1:46:08] attribute of God called love. Oh my.
[1:46:12] Listen, we have a right to look after
[1:46:13] our own affairs. But Paul says, "Look
[1:46:15] not every man on his own things, but
[1:46:17] every man also on the things of others."
[1:46:20] We got a [snorts] right to look after
[1:46:21] our own affairs. But he said, "Look on
[1:46:23] others affairs." Galatians 5:13, "For,"
[1:46:26] brethren, you've been called unto
[1:46:28] liberty. Only use not liberty for an
[1:46:30] occasion to the flesh, but by love serve
[1:46:32] one another. For all the law is
[1:46:34] fulfilled in one word, even in this,
[1:46:36] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:46:39] But if you bite and devour one another,
[1:46:41] take heed that you be not consumed one
[1:46:42] of another. To bite and devour is the
[1:46:45] nature of a wolf, but a lamb gives up it
[1:46:47] right to bite.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:51] You know, wolves fight for who's going
[1:46:52] to be the leader. That's how they choose
[1:46:54] their next leader is they fight it out.
[1:46:57] That shouldn't be the way Christians
[1:46:58] operate.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; We don't fight it out about who gets to
[1:47:01] be this or that in the church. What do
[1:47:03] we do? We lay ourselves down.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, whatever you want me to do, that's
[1:47:07] what I want to do.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; What did he do with the word?
[1:47:12] That's what he wants done with the word.
[1:47:14] You realize that
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; what he once done with the word is what
[1:47:18] he did with the word.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; He was the word and he laid himself
[1:47:23] down. Brother Brandham talks about it in
[1:47:25] in uh that [snorts] day on Calvary and I
[1:47:28] won't read it to save time but you can
[1:47:30] go back and look at it. He said eternal
[1:47:31] life is living for others.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; He said how can you let people call you
[1:47:35] such bad names? How can you do those
[1:47:36] things? He said eternal life is living
[1:47:38] for others.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus did. That's his mind.
[1:47:43] And that's what he wants us to do.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; We don't just think about ourselves.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; You realize the point if we carry it so
[1:47:52] far, all we think about our is
[1:47:54] ourselves. Eventually, we're just going
[1:47:56] to be sitting at home in our lazy boy
[1:47:58] all the time.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; That's just all we'll ever do.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Because we're just thinking about
[1:48:04] ourselves. Selfishness destroys
[1:48:06] relationships. It destroys churches. And
[1:48:08] it'll destroy your walk with God.
[1:48:12] if we could only give ourselves up to
[1:48:14] him.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "You sacrifice your own things.
[1:48:16] Give them up like the sheep gives its
[1:48:18] wool and look on towards Calvary."
[1:48:21] He said, "We must reckon ourselves dead
[1:48:23] and alive to Christ." And he made the
[1:48:25] way. Musicians, go ahead and come. He
[1:48:27] made the way that we could sacrifice
[1:48:29] ourselves to his service to follow him.
[1:48:34] If we follow him, we lead the life that
[1:48:38] he lived.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let this mind
[1:48:43] be in you.
[1:48:45] [snorts] Let let this mind, this mind,
[1:48:47] this way of thinking,
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; who thought it not robbery,
[1:48:52] right, to be equal with God, who knew
[1:48:54] who he was, [snorts]
[1:48:56] knew he was the bride or knew he was the
[1:48:58] groom, rather. He knew that he was the
[1:49:00] one who would die for our sins. He knew
[1:49:02] who he was. He knew he'd be raised again
[1:49:04] on the third day. He knew that.
[1:49:08] Oh my." He knew that he wouldn't suffer.
[1:49:11] He wouldn't suffer his holy one to see
[1:49:13] corruption. He knew what the word said
[1:49:14] about himself and he believed that word.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; We know he's our healer. How many know
[1:49:19] that today? We know he's our healer. We
[1:49:21] know he's our savior. We know he's our
[1:49:24] God.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; We know we belong to him.
[1:49:29] Let this mind be in you who having that
[1:49:31] knowledge
[1:49:33] will not elevate themselves above
[1:49:35] others, but will reach out to the people
[1:49:38] at work and the people in your town and
[1:49:43] the people around you. Be a help to your
[1:49:45] community. God didn't call us to be a
[1:49:47] bunch of a cult that pulls off in the
[1:49:49] woods somewhere. He called us to live in
[1:49:51] a place in a place where there's people.
[1:49:53] He called us to be around people and to
[1:49:55] be in a place where we'd have to work
[1:49:57] and we'd have to do things. Why? Because
[1:49:59] he wants us to be a light. You are the
[1:50:01] light of the world. Let this mind be in
[1:50:04] you.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who humbled himself
[1:50:08] to the word written about him. [snorts]
[1:50:11] And by that came the resurrection of the
[1:50:13] dead. I hope it made sense this morning.
[1:50:15] I I'm not much of a preacher, but I try
[1:50:17] to
[1:50:20] hope it made sense.
[1:50:24] I know some people think, "Well, Brother
[1:50:27] Ben, if you'd hammer this or you'd
[1:50:28] hammer that, the church would be better
[1:50:30] off." I think if we'd each one just take
[1:50:34] the mind of Christ,
[1:50:36] we'd be better off.
[1:50:40] Let this mind be in you
[1:50:44] who chose not to answer back.
[1:50:48] That's a hard one, isn't it? when they
[1:50:51] lied about him, they said, "He's a he's
[1:50:54] done this [music] and he's done that and
[1:50:56] he said not a word.
[1:50:58] He didn't defend himself. Let this mind
[1:51:02] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:51:06] who humbled himself in such a way that
[1:51:09] he said,"Lord, if they're saying it,
[1:51:11] there must be a reason for it. If
[1:51:14] they're persecuting me, there must be a
[1:51:16] reason for it. If things are the way
[1:51:19] they are, there must be a reason for it.
[1:51:21] Oh, how wonderful it is when a person
[1:51:23] has godliness with contentment. Paul
[1:51:25] said it's great gain. Why? Because we
[1:51:27] can actually reach a place where Lord,
[1:51:29] if I'm in this condition or in this
[1:51:31] place, maybe I don't have much money,
[1:51:33] but Lord, you called me to be here and I
[1:51:35] believe I'm going to do everything I can
[1:51:36] for the kingdom of God. Lord, I believe
[1:51:38] you won't let the meal run out. You
[1:51:40] won't let the oil run dry. You're going
[1:51:42] to prepare a way. Let me humble myself
[1:51:45] to the word.
[1:51:47] Listen to me. So many times we're
[1:51:48] waiting on God to do something for us so
[1:51:51] we can make a move towards him. Well,
[1:51:53] why don't we make the move? Let let let
[1:51:55] God let God provide in such a way. I
[1:51:58] believe he's a provider today. He's a
[1:52:00] supernatural God. Make a move towards
[1:52:03] him. I don't mean naturally. I mean
[1:52:05] spiritually. Make a move in your life.
[1:52:07] Say, "Lord, I'm going to commit myself
[1:52:09] to you. Surrender myself to you and let
[1:52:11] you work in my life." How many can say
[1:52:13] amen to that today?
[1:52:16] Hallelujah.
[1:52:17] Let's power our [music] heads together.
[1:52:24] Oh Jesus.
[1:52:26] Maybe there's someone here like to slip
[1:52:28] up your hand and say, "Brother Ben, I
[1:52:31] I want this mind to be in me that was in
[1:52:34] Christ.
[1:52:36] I want to have that humility, that
[1:52:38] godliness.
[1:52:39] I want to have that love. All those
[1:52:41] seven virtues that we've spoken of. God
[1:52:43] bless those hands. That's my desire. I
[1:52:45] want that. I want that to be manifested
[1:52:48] in my life.
[1:52:50] I'm a preacher, but let me be a
[1:52:52] Christian first.
[1:52:54] These people are you people are are
[1:52:57] Christians, but you're message people,
[1:52:59] but first be a Christian before you're a
[1:53:01] deacon or a trustee. You're an officer
[1:53:03] in the church. Be a real Christian. Be
[1:53:05] loving, caring, kind. Lord, help us
[1:53:08] today.
[1:53:10] Oh God, I pray that you'd move today. We
[1:53:12] thank you for your word. Thank you for
[1:53:14] your goodness to us. I pray that you'd
[1:53:17] move in a mighty way, Lord. If there's
[1:53:19] one here that's Lord that needs to be
[1:53:22] saved, I pray you'd reach down. You
[1:53:24] reach down for me, Lord. I pray you'd
[1:53:27] reach way down, Lord. Condescend to that
[1:53:30] soul today and knock on their heart's
[1:53:32] door. Lord, if there's one here that
[1:53:34] needs, Lord, a further revelation of
[1:53:37] your word, I pray you'd give it to them.
[1:53:38] there's one or that needs a true baptism
[1:53:41] of the Holy Ghost. I pray, oh God, you'd
[1:53:43] fill them with the Holy Ghost today.
[1:53:45] Lord, I pray you'd you'd bring your mind
[1:53:48] on us, oh God, by your word. How do we
[1:53:50] know your mind by the message of the
[1:53:52] hour? I pray you'd help us to receive
[1:53:53] it, to accept it. I thank you for it
[1:53:56] today. Not to fight with it or to think
[1:53:59] we know better, but Lord, just to
[1:54:01] receive it. I pray that you'd grant it
[1:54:03] now. We thank you for all that you do. I
[1:54:06] pray that you'd heal the sick. I think
[1:54:08] especially of Sister Lana's mother this
[1:54:10] morning, Lord, and they're in the
[1:54:12] hospital and Lord, them not being able
[1:54:15] to be in church for a while now. And I
[1:54:16] know it can get discouraging, but Lord,
[1:54:19] I pray you'd reach down, oh God. Lord,
[1:54:21] no one wants to get that diagnosis at at
[1:54:23] a young age, but Lord, we're believing
[1:54:25] that you're a God. We're not afraid of
[1:54:27] cancer. [music] We're believing you're a
[1:54:29] God that heals. Lord, I pray for each
[1:54:32] one that's not here right now. I pray
[1:54:34] that you'd bless them. I pray that you'd
[1:54:36] heal them, encourage them, [music] Lord.
[1:54:38] We thank you for them in Jesus name.
[1:54:42] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Just believe
[1:54:45] [music]
[1:54:47] when you call
[1:54:49] his name. [singing]

[1:54:59] that matters.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; If you need prayer, I'd [music] like to
[1:55:03] open up the altar for you today.
[1:55:05] We go and we'll pray with you if you
[1:55:07] just need to pray. We go ahead and let
[1:55:09] you pray.
