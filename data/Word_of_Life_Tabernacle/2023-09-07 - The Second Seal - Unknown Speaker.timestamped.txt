[42:50] brother Branham goes back on a lengthy
[42:52] review if you if you've listened to the
[42:54] second seal brother Brown goes back on a
[42:56] lengthy review of the first seal and
[42:59] just kind of hammers that home and I
[43:01] think it's appropriate because that is
[43:03] the he's revealing the Antichrist that I
[43:06] would say that he still has a white
[43:08] horse rider today uh he said that Ryder
[43:11] would ride on into eternity and and then
[43:14] he went on to be a red horse rider a
[43:17] black horse rider a pale horse rider he
[43:19] said it's the same one on different
[43:21] color horses but yet he's still a white
[43:24] horse rider today that that still
[43:26] represents today in fact The Pale Horse
[43:28] was the uh was the accumulation of all
[43:31] of those ways that he uh presented
[43:34] himself his character in the way that he
[43:37] presented himself and so we see him as a
[43:39] deceiver today isn't he I think that's
[43:42] that's what he does mostly today and yet
[43:45] we know that he'll be a a red horse
[43:48] rider again as he has been he'll take
[43:51] his sword again that's coming on the
[43:54] earth in the not too distant future so
[43:57] brother Branham ties the second seal to
[43:59] Matthew 24 where it says there'd be wars
[44:02] and rumors of war and and he said the
[44:05] end is not yet and it talks at about the
[44:08] Fig Tree and he ties it back to Luke
[44:10] where it talks about the Fig Tree and
[44:11] all the other trees and he says this he
[44:14] said now we find out that there would be
[44:16] wars and rumors of war and now we see
[44:19] the Fig Tree put forth its buds and the
[44:21] other trees put forth their buds the
[44:23] method is the Baptists the Presbyterians
[44:26] now this has already happened
[44:28] remember the Fig Tree was Israel and
[44:30] Israel become a nation they put forth
[44:32] their butt the method has put forth
[44:34] their butt the Baptist put forth there
[44:36] but they they've accumulated millions of
[44:39] followers and and and people Christians
[44:42] during that time but that Revival is
[44:45] over in fact today they're losing people
[44:48] and the mainline denominations are have
[44:51] a hard time keeping people in church but
[44:53] now's a different time this is the time
[44:56] for the bride he said that there's a
[44:59] great revival going on he said now I
[45:00] believe that God is gathering the bride
[45:03] for the last hour the elect aren't you
[45:07] glad for that you say brother Ben I I
[45:09] don't know I feel like I've been
[45:10] gathered to anything what do you
[45:11] gathered to you're gathered to the word
[45:14] wherever the carcass is that's where the
[45:17] Eagles will be gathered together and
[45:19] that's why we're here tonight now the
[45:21] the Fig Tree is God you know that's the
[45:24] that's God's showing us that that the
[45:27] end time is near and and now God's
[45:30] Gathering the elect now he said let us
[45:32] now consider what John saw he said a red
[45:36] horse and his writer Goes Forth power
[45:38] given to him to slay with a great sword
[45:41] he said now here is my revelation of it
[45:44] this is Satan again it's the devil in
[45:47] another form and so brother Branham told
[45:50] us that a trumpet he said was a
[45:52] political disturbance but he goes here
[45:55] and he said you find out this man has a
[45:57] sword he said so he pertains not to uh
[46:01] he's not to National War not to Civil
[46:03] War but to church political war right he
[46:07] said now you might not think that but
[46:09] just watch it a minute he said notice
[46:11] the change of color of these horses the
[46:14] same writer but the change of color of
[46:17] horses a horse is a beast that's the
[46:19] power a symbol of a power he said the
[46:22] same system riding on another color
[46:24] power from innocent white to a bloody
[46:27] red now you may not think this is
[46:29] important or impact your daily life but
[46:31] it really does more than we realize
[46:33] because he's still doing this today and
[46:36] I think we need to understand and you're
[46:38] going to see this it's all of it right
[46:40] what did he say last week he said all
[46:42] has come under that Antichrist Spirit he
[46:45] said he would deceive all
[46:47] right all of it
[46:49] conservatives and liberals
[46:51] Democrats and Republicans Baptists and
[46:55] methodists
[46:56] right aren't you glad for the message of
[46:58] the hour this is the only safety that we
[47:01] have is in the word of the hour there's
[47:03] no safety under any political movement
[47:05] there's no safety under anything else
[47:07] it's just under the word of the hour
[47:10] so he said the same system riding on
[47:12] another color a power from innocent
[47:14] white to a bloody red and not realizing
[47:18] they're all and you see these things
[47:19] writing today one will say peace and
[47:21] another says war and it's under the Same
[47:24] Spirit
[47:25] but they even fight with one another
[47:27] but now anointed by The Same Spirit he
[47:30] said when he first started he was just a
[47:33] little Doctrine in amongst called the
[47:35] nicolaitanism of course he said it
[47:37] wouldn't say anything he wouldn't say
[47:39] anything it's just a Doctrine just a
[47:41] spirit amongst the people so watch how
[47:43] Satan gets started before he can become
[47:45] incarnate before it can become real it
[47:48] has to start as a Doctrine now I know
[47:50] there's a lot of people say Doctrine
[47:51] doesn't matter Doctrine does matter
[47:54] I I will say that your Doctrine Matt
[47:56] what you believe is true matters
[47:59] because before it can ever become an
[48:01] action in your life you you believe
[48:03] something wrong
[48:05] before it can become an action that's
[48:07] wrong there's something about what you
[48:10] believe that is wrong and so if we
[48:13] believe that God is faithful we believe
[48:15] that God is true we believe that he's
[48:17] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:18] that manifests itself in our life
[48:21] and also if you believe that if you
[48:24] believe that nothing's happening right
[48:25] now and the bride doesn't have any
[48:27] Revival and and we're waiting on
[48:29] something else to happen later that'll
[48:31] manifest in your life
[48:33] so Doctrine does matter
[48:36] he said no he said he wouldn't say
[48:38] anything he was just a Doctrine just a
[48:39] spirit amongst the people he said oh he
[48:41] was so innocent riding on this White
[48:43] Horse well you know we can have a great
[48:45] worldwide church we could call this The
[48:47] Universal Church they still do oh it's
[48:50] perfectly innocent it's so innocent
[48:52] it'll just a group of men we'll all get
[48:54] together for Fellowship see it's very
[48:56] innocent he said it's white the white
[48:58] horse was well there's a profound
[49:00] thought isn't it but it's innocent and
[49:03] so brother Brandon begins to talk about
[49:05] this and again I'm condensing a
[49:07] three-hour sermon into about 30 minutes
[49:09] so you just bear with me tonight but the
[49:13] White Horse was come in as a Doctrine
[49:16] but even then before it was a Doctrine
[49:19] before it even become a stated thing it
[49:22] was a spirit
[49:23] and it begins as a spirit of of classism
[49:28] it begins as a spirit in the church it
[49:32] actually begins as a clique in the
[49:34] church
[49:35] and so those of you that are here and
[49:38] those of you that are listening I want
[49:40] you to listen carefully this is why we
[49:42] try so hard to put make to church and
[49:44] cause the church to do things together
[49:46] to encourage the church to do things as
[49:49] a body
[49:50] because false Doctrine starts as a click
[49:55] it starts as one part of the church
[49:59] saying we're better than another part of
[50:01] the church or or we're different than
[50:03] another part of the church and we're
[50:04] going to kind of get off to ourselves it
[50:06] starts as people do the same thing
[50:08] pastors do the same thing churches do
[50:10] the same thing well the rest of these
[50:12] message people they're all wrong and so
[50:14] we'll just pull off to ourselves and
[50:16] have our own little thing it becomes a
[50:18] dangerous thing because it actually
[50:20] leads to a deceptive Spirit well we're
[50:22] the only ones that are right well if
[50:23] we're the only ones that are right then
[50:25] something is wrong
[50:27] right there God's got people all over
[50:29] the Earth do you believe that tonight
[50:30] he's got people all over the U.S he got
[50:33] people all over the world that preach
[50:35] this message he has to it may not be a
[50:37] many but in every Church there's three
[50:39] kinds of Believers but somebody believes
[50:41] that somebody is standing for the
[50:43] message of the hour
[50:44] they've got to be but it's so it starts
[50:47] off as a click in the church
[50:49] and that's why we encourage you to go to
[50:52] come together and to worship together
[50:54] and to Fellowship together and to eat
[50:56] together even all those things I know we
[50:58] can't always do it but anytime that we
[51:00] can we try to get people together
[51:01] because we don't want those things to
[51:03] start
[51:04] now but when this awful deceiving Spirit
[51:08] he said oh man incarnated in incarnate
[51:11] spirit this doctrine of spirit become
[51:13] incarnated to take the place of Christ
[51:15] into a man
[51:17] it must be worshiped then turning to be
[51:21] a worship like Christ so they begin to
[51:25] worship a Doctrine and then the doctrine
[51:28] took the form of a person and it become
[51:32] a worship like Christ the doctrine
[51:34] instead of Christ
[51:37] now anything that takes the instead of
[51:39] Christ to the Bible says there's one
[51:41] median in between man and God the man
[51:43] Christ Jesus anything that comes in
[51:45] between you and Christ you and God you
[51:47] in the word is an antichrist
[51:50] the doctrine instead of Christ
[51:53] so brother random I illustrates Sam he
[51:55] uses the the Latin term one of the names
[51:58] for the pope historically although they
[52:01] try to deny it today was vicarious
[52:04] philia Dia which is the uh the viker of
[52:07] Christ or instead of Christ
[52:10] and he said he broke that down how that
[52:12] you could actually break down the
[52:14] numbers and it breaks down to 666. how
[52:17] many have heard that
[52:18] right and that's true you can go break
[52:20] down the numbers and it breaks down to
[52:22] that now the Catholic Church would
[52:23] respond and you'll see people with
[52:25] anti-message people take the same thing
[52:27] and respond that you can break down just
[52:29] about any name into numbers now brother
[52:31] Branham actually answers that criticism
[52:33] and he said he said that's true he said
[52:36] my name might break down into them an
[52:38] unflattering number
[52:40] right that's true any one of our names
[52:42] could do that he said but I don't meet
[52:43] the other qualifications
[52:45] right he said I don't sit on Seven Hills
[52:48] come on right I'm not drunk with the
[52:50] blood of the Saints
[52:51] so this the vicarious Philly idea is not
[52:56] the if that's not what proves he's the
[52:58] Antichrist it's just another another
[53:00] little bit of grain of sand on the
[53:03] mountain of evidence
[53:04] shows us who he is
[53:06] right because he's manifested himself as
[53:10] an antichrist which the Branham taught
[53:13] us that it's a demon spirit in the pope
[53:16] to make him do that but now one day he
[53:18] actually becomes the Devil Himself the
[53:21] head demon incarnate and that becomes
[53:24] the Beast now and so he wears a crown
[53:27] brother Brandon talked about the Triple
[53:28] Crown which is the papal Tiara or Tiara
[53:32] and so and that triple crown if you go
[53:35] back one uh to that Crown itself you can
[53:38] see that it actually it actually
[53:40] consists of three parts and
[53:43] and it's a Triune office that the pope
[53:46] holds and his crown is is actually three
[53:49] crowns in one and the the Triple Crown
[53:53] if you go to the vaticans visit
[53:54] vaticancity.com you can find this is the
[53:57] one brother Brandon would have looked at
[53:58] when he was there this is the one that
[54:00] they put on Saint Peter's head every
[54:02] year
[54:03] and during their festival and uh and so
[54:06] it it says this the Triple Crown is the
[54:08] papal Tiara comprising the three crowns
[54:11] which symbolize the Pope's threefolds
[54:13] power as father of Kings Rector of the
[54:16] world and vikra of Christ
[54:19] so that's where brother Brandon just
[54:21] said he said I saw it right written just
[54:23] above it and talks about how he calls
[54:24] him he literally it's as if the pope
[54:27] calls himself the Antichrist
[54:30] but today what's happened is that
[54:32] something interesting has happened in
[54:34] the last few years since brother Branham
[54:36] left the scene Pope's brother Stewart
[54:38] have quit wearing the tiara have you
[54:41] ever seen a pope with one on
[54:42] you haven't in our lifetime because the
[54:45] last one to wear one was back in the 50s
[54:48] I believe in it's actually a picture of
[54:50] in black and white you can see him still
[54:52] wearing it but it still exists and he
[54:54] still claims the same authorities but
[54:56] they don't wear it anymore because it
[54:58] looks bad
[54:59] so they wear the little beanie on their
[55:02] head but they're actually still still in
[55:04] their coat of arms and everything else
[55:06] and they actually deny that vicarious
[55:08] FIA Ophelia Dia was ever a title for the
[55:12] pope but if you go back in their own
[55:14] literature you can find where it was it
[55:17] states that it's a fact I just looked at
[55:18] it myself this week so this is the one
[55:21] we find in second Thessalonians 2 4 and
[55:25] people say whatever they want to about
[55:26] the Antichrist we know who he's going to
[55:28] be
[55:29] right when he becomes incarnate he'll
[55:32] present himself as the Pope
[55:34] right because that's been the Antichrist
[55:37] system all along
[55:39] now brother Branham says who opposed or
[55:41] the Bible says this is the one who
[55:43] opposeth and exalteth himself of all
[55:45] that is called God or that is worshiped
[55:47] so that he asked God sent us in the
[55:49] temple of God showing himself that he is
[55:52] God
[55:53] and yet again I would warn us that
[55:55] that's not the only Antichrist system in
[55:57] the world today it all belongs to Satan
[56:01] right but but one day it'll be the Beast
[56:03] and he'll actually become uh what is
[56:05] commonly known as the Antichrist now uh
[56:08] of course brother random taught us that
[56:10] Satan in the Bible teaches Satan is the
[56:12] head of all political power how many
[56:14] know that tonight
[56:15] of every nation
[56:18] brother Brahm in some places says every
[56:20] nation but Israel
[56:22] right but in Matthew 4 8 the devil took
[56:25] him up into an exceeding high mountain
[56:27] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[56:29] world and the glory of them all the
[56:31] kingdoms of the world
[56:33] he said he said which one do you want if
[56:36] you go bow down to me I'll give you all
[56:38] of them
[56:39] right and so brother said talk about a
[56:41] person he said I'll give them to you if
[56:43] you'll worship me and Jesus knew that he
[56:46] was going to fall heir to them
[56:48] so brother Branham talked about that and
[56:49] he said all these holy rollers people
[56:51] say and how poor they are and everything
[56:53] like that he said but the meek will
[56:55] inherit the earth so one day you're
[56:57] going to fall heir to all the kingdoms
[57:00] of the Earth
[57:01] but right now it's ruled by the
[57:03] Antichrist spirit
[57:05] see you see why you have so much trouble
[57:07] at work I had so much trouble at home
[57:09] why you have so much trouble on the job
[57:11] why you have so much trouble with your
[57:12] kids you realize the age the system that
[57:15] we're in
[57:16] we're in the best country on the earth
[57:18] I'll I'll say that as many places as
[57:21] I've been I Brother David I wouldn't
[57:23] want to give it up for any of them but
[57:25] yet it's still ruled by the devil
[57:27] you've got to believe that to believe
[57:29] the word of God
[57:31] and so our job is not to overthrow this
[57:34] Kingdom or or even to make life better
[57:37] in this Kingdom although I believe we
[57:38] should do that as Citizens but our job
[57:41] as Christians is not to do that but our
[57:43] job is to what is to get ready for
[57:45] another kingdom
[57:47] because there's coming another king
[57:48] there's coming the one who rides on a
[57:51] white horse and he's coming to execute
[57:53] judgment and righteousness on the Earth
[57:56] aren't you looking forward to that day
[57:58] I'm glad that this is not the end and so
[58:00] we should never get too caught up in
[58:02] successes or failures or numbers or
[58:04] things going on around and say well well
[58:06] I I just feel discouraged don't be
[58:09] discouraged there's coming today you'll
[58:11] inherit the earth
[58:13] amen now
[58:15] brother Brown said when he has his head
[58:17] demon incarnate in the super religious
[58:20] man as the Bible predicts then he unites
[58:24] his church and state both of his own
[58:26] powers unite together
[58:29] so there's two different powers that
[58:32] unite together and we see a prefigure
[58:34] that in the pope who was both church and
[58:36] state and we'll see it again at the end
[58:38] time so the Antichrist is against the
[58:41] teaching of Christ or or saying that an
[58:45] antichrist can be anything that says the
[58:47] the present truth is for another age
[58:50] but now that Antichrist Spirit it come
[58:53] in among the church it slipped in and
[58:56] said well we don't like these holy
[58:57] rollers and stuff like that
[58:59] but now it slips in and brother Brown
[59:01] said you can't Crown a spirit
[59:03] so he had to he had to take on he had to
[59:06] become a pope
[59:08] right and then the Antichrist become the
[59:10] false prophet
[59:11] no he brother said he gets into a place
[59:14] so he's going to make a universal church
[59:16] power taking religious power
[59:19] you know how this nation started it
[59:21] started with two powers that were
[59:23] separated
[59:25] right Church power
[59:27] and and religious power
[59:30] and it started with with uh with civil
[59:33] power
[59:33] and in this nation is represented in
[59:36] Revelation 13 11. Revelation 13 11 this
[59:39] is the second beast the first Beast
[59:41] Remember come out of the water come out
[59:43] of Europe where there were people this
[59:45] Beast comes up out of the Earth where
[59:46] there are no people in the new the the
[59:48] new Earth the new uh part of of the
[59:51] world
[59:52] and he had two horns two horns like a
[59:56] lamb
[59:57] right they they weren't much to them
[1:00:00] separation of church and state
[1:00:02] brother Brandon taught us
[1:00:04] so the two horns were civil and
[1:00:07] ecclesiastical power
[1:00:09] and brother Bible said it'll finally end
[1:00:11] up
[1:00:12] he goes on he talks about this he said
[1:00:14] it'll end up a woman will control her
[1:00:17] but remember he said that that won't be
[1:00:20] just under civil power
[1:00:22] right that's not going to be just under
[1:00:24] civil power it has to be under religious
[1:00:26] power as well
[1:00:27] so something's got to come to unite that
[1:00:30] so he said he'll end up a woman will
[1:00:32] control her he said remember that was 30
[1:00:34] years ago I said it and the seven things
[1:00:35] I predicted five of them has done come
[1:00:37] to pass he said they got the man right
[1:00:39] there now to bring her in that was
[1:00:40] Kennedy he said and you voted him
[1:00:42] through your politics there
[1:00:45] some of the man talks about the woman he
[1:00:47] said or perhaps the Catholic Church
[1:00:49] that would take over I don't doubt that
[1:00:51] it'll be both
[1:00:52] now again but even now before we have a
[1:00:56] woman president Satan holds every
[1:00:59] government of the Earth
[1:01:01] but no that was that civil power
[1:01:04] but brother random said he did not have
[1:01:05] ecclesiastical power yet
[1:01:07] but he started in with a demon of false
[1:01:10] teaching and that teaching become a
[1:01:12] doctrine that Doctrine becoming
[1:01:13] incarnate in a false prophet and just
[1:01:15] then he went to the right place he never
[1:01:17] went to Israel he went to nicaea Rome he
[1:01:20] said the council was held they elected
[1:01:21] ahead bishop and by doing this a United
[1:01:23] church and state together then he
[1:01:26] dropped his bow he got off his White
[1:01:28] Horse he got on his red horse for he can
[1:01:31] kill anybody that don't agree with him
[1:01:35] he said there's your seal
[1:01:37] same fellow watch him right on into
[1:01:39] eternity under with it he said see he
[1:01:41] unites both his powers together or are
[1:01:44] we blessed to know these things
[1:01:46] he unites both his powers together we
[1:01:49] find out he unites his power then when
[1:01:51] he becomes both state and church
[1:01:52] ecclesiastical then what are you going
[1:01:55] to do he said he forms his own religion
[1:01:58] we think about it being Catholic but he
[1:02:00] actually forms he formed his own
[1:02:02] religion as a Catholic church but
[1:02:03] brother Brown said in the end it'll be
[1:02:05] every religion
[1:02:07] can't we all get along
[1:02:08] right so it'll be a multicultural
[1:02:11] multi-religion it'll be it'll be a cage
[1:02:14] of every foul spirit is what it'll be
[1:02:16] but he said he forms his own religion
[1:02:19] now he can do whatever he wants to then
[1:02:21] he has the right to put to death
[1:02:22] whosoever will not agree with him that's
[1:02:24] exactly what he did he said he did that
[1:02:27] just exactly he did it to the true
[1:02:28] Saints of the Living God who kept the
[1:02:30] word and wouldn't agree with him on his
[1:02:32] dogmas he put them to death how many of
[1:02:34] you have ever heard of Saint Augustine
[1:02:37] Saint Augustine we quote Saint Augustine
[1:02:39] a lot of times and you see his name on a
[1:02:41] church
[1:02:42] the Browns that taught us that Saint
[1:02:44] Augustine rejected the Holy Ghost you go
[1:02:46] back in history in the pre-nician
[1:02:48] fathers and find that
[1:02:50] Saint Augustine rejected the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] and he said he went back down to hippo
[1:02:55] that's the word the region that he was
[1:02:57] Bishop of
[1:02:58] he said he was the very one that signed
[1:03:00] a paper that had the Revelation from God
[1:03:03] that it was all right and pleasing God
[1:03:05] to put every person to death didn't
[1:03:07] believe with the Roman Catholic Church
[1:03:10] watch how it turned oh we want to accept
[1:03:12] the Holy Ghost no we don't want to
[1:03:14] reject it when he rejected he come right
[1:03:16] up to the border and when he rejected it
[1:03:19] he comes back with that doctrine that
[1:03:21] it's okay to put everyone to death that
[1:03:23] didn't believe the Roman Catholic Church
[1:03:26] and so brother Brown said from that time
[1:03:28] he said I'm quoting from the martyrology
[1:03:30] and you find this I've actually got a
[1:03:33] digital copy of it you'll find this in
[1:03:35] schmucker's glorious Reformation where
[1:03:37] this number comes from he said from the
[1:03:40] time of Saint Augustine of Hippo until
[1:03:42] 1586
[1:03:44] Roman Catholic Church put 68 million
[1:03:47] Protestants to death
[1:03:49] I went just as an aside I went down
[1:03:52] here recently to a an antique store in
[1:03:55] this antique store they had all kinds of
[1:03:57] oil and gas memorabilia and they had
[1:03:59] Nazi memorabilia I've never seen so much
[1:04:01] Nazi memorabilia in my life real stuff
[1:04:03] from back there made me nervous
[1:04:05] honestly just to be around it you know
[1:04:08] you're like what kind of people are
[1:04:09] these you know but it was like real
[1:04:11] stuff from back in the second world war
[1:04:12] so it was interesting as we were looking
[1:04:14] at that I thought about this I thought
[1:04:16] what about the Catholic Church
[1:04:18] who put all these millions of people to
[1:04:21] death just like the Nazis did
[1:04:23] many many more than the Nazis did
[1:04:26] and and and you look at all the the
[1:04:29] World Systems today and people talk
[1:04:30] about communism people talk about uh
[1:04:33] Nazism and all those other things all
[1:04:34] the isms that have been but brother
[1:04:36] random talked about that purple curtain
[1:04:38] would be the worst one of all of them
[1:04:40] and it is it has been over the years
[1:04:43] I don't say we should hate Catholic
[1:04:45] people but that system you've got to
[1:04:48] understand what it is
[1:04:49] that system we don't mess with it right
[1:04:51] we we don't make it we don't want to be
[1:04:54] part of that we don't want to do
[1:04:55] anything like that whenever I see
[1:04:57] Catholicism creeping over into the
[1:04:59] message we we don't want nothing to do
[1:05:01] with that we don't want to start praying
[1:05:03] to a prophet we don't want to start we
[1:05:05] don't want to start having a
[1:05:06] headquarters that tells us when to pray
[1:05:08] and when to have church and we don't
[1:05:10] want nothing to do with that
[1:05:12] because that's that that's that
[1:05:13] Catholicism that crept in and it
[1:05:16] actually created death
[1:05:18] it was on a red horse he said was it
[1:05:21] sword red was he riding a red horse what
[1:05:23] was it the same power the same writer
[1:05:25] there's the seal they admit 68 million
[1:05:28] on the martyrology besides all those put
[1:05:30] to death outside of that he said oh
[1:05:33] mercy they're in the Dark Ages there
[1:05:35] were Millions fed to Lions slaughtered
[1:05:37] in every way because they wouldn't bow
[1:05:39] down to that Catholic dogma
[1:05:42] and so
[1:05:43] we find this and brother Brown says he
[1:05:45] said now I want you to think spiritually
[1:05:47] he said let the Holy Ghost teach you in
[1:05:50] Revelation 17 1 let's go to Revelation
[1:05:52] 17. I hope I'm not boring you tonight
[1:05:55] but let's look at Revelation 17. I know
[1:05:57] you know these things but I think it's
[1:05:59] important as we continue to kind of try
[1:06:02] to encapsulate these seals
[1:06:05] Revelation 17 1 there came one of the
[1:06:08] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[1:06:10] and talked with me saying saying unto me
[1:06:12] come hither I will show unto thee the
[1:06:14] Judgment of the great the sinneth
[1:06:16] upon many Waters he said that had to be
[1:06:18] a woman and a woman is a church
[1:06:22] he said now Waters what does that mean
[1:06:24] read the 15th verse Revelation 17 15. he
[1:06:28] says unto me the waters which I saw us
[1:06:30] where the horse sitteth our peoples
[1:06:32] multitudes Nations not just a single
[1:06:36] nation but Nations and tongues he said
[1:06:39] this church was ruling over the whole
[1:06:42] world
[1:06:43] see set upon many Waters
[1:06:46] many Waters I don't know if you noticed
[1:06:48] recently there was the pope that visited
[1:06:50] Mongolia how many saw that in the news I
[1:06:53] won't hold you much longer just hang
[1:06:55] with me for a minute
[1:06:56] Pope visited Mongolia now what was he
[1:06:59] doing in Mongolia right that's the end
[1:07:01] of the Earth right there
[1:07:03] if you've ever been to Mongolia you've
[1:07:04] been to just about every country in the
[1:07:06] world because it's just empty of people
[1:07:08] and and there's very few Catholics there
[1:07:10] but he was visiting there to make peace
[1:07:13] and to talk about peace between world
[1:07:16] religions the religions of Mongolia and
[1:07:19] the Catholic religion and I saw the
[1:07:21] headline was they gave the Pope the
[1:07:24] status of an emperor when he went in
[1:07:25] they gave him a welcome fit for an
[1:07:27] emperor and that's exactly what he wants
[1:07:30] when he goes in now so he was ruling
[1:07:33] over the whole world why would he be in
[1:07:34] Mongolia but it's the way the Catholic
[1:07:36] church is now brother Brandon talked
[1:07:39] about the iron and the clay it goes out
[1:07:40] into all the little toes it it goes into
[1:07:43] every nation
[1:07:44] it seeps its way into every nation now
[1:07:46] verse 2 with whom the kings of the Earth
[1:07:49] have committed fornication the
[1:07:51] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[1:07:52] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[1:07:54] so he carried me away in the spirit Into
[1:07:56] the Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a
[1:07:58] Scarlet colored Beast full of names of
[1:08:01] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[1:08:03] horns
[1:08:04] now I've read their Catholic Study Bible
[1:08:06] I used to own one
[1:08:08] and brother Branham references facts of
[1:08:10] our faith in the Catholic Study Bible if
[1:08:12] you go to Revelation 17 they'll tell you
[1:08:14] that's wrong
[1:08:17] they understand that that woman is wrong
[1:08:20] but they don't see it necessarily as
[1:08:22] their church but they understand that
[1:08:24] that's wrong and so he said he carried
[1:08:27] me away in the spirit Into the
[1:08:28] Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting
[1:08:30] upon a scar that clothed Beast full of
[1:08:32] names of blasphemy having seven heads
[1:08:35] and ten horns he said watch that symbol
[1:08:37] seven heads you see where it said the
[1:08:39] heads which I saw us are seven hills on
[1:08:42] which the woman said if Rome sits on
[1:08:44] Seven Hills and the woman was a Raiden
[1:08:46] purple and scarlet color decked with
[1:08:48] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[1:08:50] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:08:52] Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:08:55] fornication he said the Antichrist
[1:08:57] Spirit see teaching committing adultery
[1:08:59] with God now she's supposed to be a
[1:09:01] bride and committing an adultery just
[1:09:03] like Eve did just like the church does
[1:09:05] there and upon her forehead was a name
[1:09:07] written mystery Babylon the great the
[1:09:09] mother of harlots and Abominations of
[1:09:12] the earth Babylon Rome is the second
[1:09:14] Babylon verse 6 and I saw the woman
[1:09:17] drunken with the blood of the Saints
[1:09:19] with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus
[1:09:21] when I saw her I wondered with great
[1:09:23] admira admiration he said she was such a
[1:09:25] beautiful thing with crosses and
[1:09:27] everything on her how in the world could
[1:09:29] she be guilty of drinking the blood of
[1:09:31] the Saints it puzzled him it still
[1:09:33] puzzles people today
[1:09:35] honestly sometimes it puzzles us how's
[1:09:38] this all going to happen but yet it's
[1:09:40] going to happen
[1:09:41] he said now he's going to tell him and
[1:09:44] the angel said unto me wherefore which
[1:09:45] did thou Marvel I will tell thee The
[1:09:47] Mystery of the woman of the Beast that
[1:09:49] carryth her which had the seven heads
[1:09:50] and ten horns the Beast that thou
[1:09:52] thoughts was and it's not and shall
[1:09:54] Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[1:09:56] into Perdition and they that dwell in
[1:09:58] the Earth shall wonder whose names were
[1:10:00] not written in the Book of Life from the
[1:10:02] foundation of the world when they behold
[1:10:04] the Beast it was and it's not and yet it
[1:10:06] is they'll Wonder Oh my he said how he
[1:10:11] said when when was your name put on the
[1:10:12] book of life that Revival you attended
[1:10:15] no sir from the foundation of the world
[1:10:17] those will be the only ones that'll make
[1:10:20] it
[1:10:22] that's it
[1:10:23] I read something today just challenged
[1:10:26] me brother Stewart brother Brown says in
[1:10:28] a church age book he says you can see
[1:10:29] the thought if you can see that the
[1:10:31] thoughts of God are Eternal he said you
[1:10:33] can see many things
[1:10:35] and think about that for a minute if if
[1:10:38] you can see the thoughts of God are
[1:10:40] Eternal you can see many things you were
[1:10:43] his thoughts
[1:10:44] amen you were his thoughts you were the
[1:10:47] thoughts that he had of someone who
[1:10:48] would stand at the end time those names
[1:10:50] were written in the Book of Life
[1:10:52] and so you you can't you know look at
[1:10:55] somebody else say well they don't see it
[1:10:56] well maybe they weren't meant to see it
[1:10:58] but your eyes have been opened Jesus
[1:11:01] said blessed are your eyes
[1:11:03] because you can see
[1:11:05] oh aren't you glad you can see tonight
[1:11:08] amen when was it put on The Book of Life
[1:11:11] oh my brother Paul when was it put on
[1:11:13] The Book of Life when you when you heard
[1:11:14] about a message maybe when you were
[1:11:16] saved as a child or a young person when
[1:11:19] were you name put on the book of life
[1:11:20] before the foundation of the earth
[1:11:21] that's why you come to the message of
[1:11:24] the hour that's why you were saved
[1:11:26] that's why you received the baptism of
[1:11:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:11:30] you can see the thoughts of God are
[1:11:32] Eternal you can see many things
[1:11:34] Hallelujah aren't you glad to be one of
[1:11:36] those Eternal thoughts of God
[1:11:38] oh my just oh the thought of that just
[1:11:40] overwhelms me he said see the Beast one
[1:11:43] will die another one take his place he
[1:11:45] was he was not he was he was not and
[1:11:48] should go Plumb into Perdition that way
[1:11:50] it's the different popes that come
[1:11:52] he said here's the mind which hath
[1:11:54] wisdom the seven heads or seven
[1:11:55] mountains which the woman sitteth
[1:11:59] this is the wisdom the gift of wisdom we
[1:12:01] went through not long ago
[1:12:02] there are seven Kings five are Fallen
[1:12:05] one is the other has not yet come when
[1:12:07] he cometh he must continue a short space
[1:12:11] and so brother bear said the one that
[1:12:12] was the one that is was Nero
[1:12:15] he said in the Beast it was and it's not
[1:12:16] even he is the eighth and his other
[1:12:17] seven and goeth into Perdition so he had
[1:12:20] Emperors that come and win and then the
[1:12:22] popes that come and win an unbroken line
[1:12:24] but now
[1:12:26] he said Pagan Rome brought into papal
[1:12:28] Rome when the Incarnate Antichrist
[1:12:30] Spirit become incarnate was crowned it
[1:12:32] was made a Crown King of Rome both in
[1:12:35] state and church together
[1:12:37] the ten horns which I saw solicitor Ten
[1:12:39] Kings which haven't received no Kingdom
[1:12:41] as yet but received power as kings one
[1:12:44] hour with the Beast he said that's
[1:12:45] dictators
[1:12:46] dictators you said you because it says
[1:12:49] these have one mind
[1:12:51] he's have one mind and shall give their
[1:12:53] power strength to the Beast he shall
[1:12:55] make war with the lamb the lamb shall
[1:12:57] overcome them for he is Lord of lords
[1:12:59] and king of kings and they that are with
[1:13:01] him are called aren't you glad to be
[1:13:03] called and chosen and faithful
[1:13:06] and he saith unto me the waters which I
[1:13:08] saw us to the horse said to their
[1:13:09] peoples and multitudes and Nations and
[1:13:11] tongues and the ten horns that I saw
[1:13:13] they shall hate The Horde to make her
[1:13:15] Destin and naked shall eat her flesh and
[1:13:16] burn her with fire for God has put in
[1:13:19] their hearts to fulfill his will you say
[1:13:21] why does these countries like North
[1:13:22] Korea Iran all these why did they even
[1:13:24] exist
[1:13:26] they're here for a purpose
[1:13:28] to give their Kingdom unto the beasts
[1:13:30] until the words of God shall be
[1:13:32] fulfilled and the woman which I saw us
[1:13:34] is that great city which reigneth over
[1:13:36] the kings of the Earth but the brainer
[1:13:39] said that's wrong Rome don't do it as a
[1:13:41] nation it does it as a church and every
[1:13:43] nation under Heaven is to Rome so they
[1:13:46] wonder if the Miracles he can do he can
[1:13:47] stop War the only thing he has to do is
[1:13:49] just say stop
[1:13:51] now look but you think he'll do it
[1:13:53] certainly not
[1:13:54] so he has the power to stop War but he
[1:13:57] doesn't
[1:13:58] his bow had no arrows at first but his
[1:14:00] great sword did he done his killing
[1:14:02] later and changed from White Horse to
[1:14:04] Red Horse the same exactly Devil with
[1:14:06] his sword
[1:14:08] but I love this this word getting ready
[1:14:10] or come to the end of this and and
[1:14:12] getting close to the end of Brother by
[1:14:14] Adam's sermon on the second seal as he's
[1:14:16] opening up the seal the lamb is opening
[1:14:18] the seal oh I love the way God hides
[1:14:20] himself in simplicity
[1:14:22] and he says this he quotes Matthew 26
[1:14:25] 52. remember when Peter grabbed his
[1:14:27] sword and cut a man's ear off
[1:14:29] and brother random says this he said
[1:14:31] don't fight it
[1:14:34] now that's tough sometimes isn't it
[1:14:37] don't fight it
[1:14:38] but we're going home
[1:14:40] listen we could never fight this system
[1:14:43] with our with guns we'll never do it
[1:14:46] some of y'all got a pretty impressive
[1:14:47] collection but you're never going to
[1:14:49] fight this red horse rider with guns
[1:14:53] it's a spiritual battle
[1:14:55] you're never going to fight it with guns
[1:14:57] but yet what's going to happen Jesus he
[1:15:01] said when when he took the sword and cut
[1:15:03] his ear off Jesus said unto him put up
[1:15:05] again thy sword into his place for all
[1:15:07] they've been take to sword Shall Perish
[1:15:10] with the sword
[1:15:11] he said now remember he's got a sword
[1:15:13] he's going forth a sword in his hand
[1:15:16] writing red horse wading through the
[1:15:18] blood of everybody that disagrees with
[1:15:20] him now we shouldn't be that way should
[1:15:22] we
[1:15:23] that's not the spirit of a Christian
[1:15:26] to go out wading through the blood of
[1:15:27] those who disagree with you
[1:15:30] all right we don't want to slay the
[1:15:33] people we disagree with
[1:15:35] call them names hurt their character
[1:15:37] right that's not that's not our nature
[1:15:40] oh my oh that's not our nature at all
[1:15:43] but God will take care of it vengeance
[1:15:45] is mine saith the Lord I will repay he's
[1:15:49] got a great sword he Wades through the
[1:15:50] blood of everybody that disagrees with
[1:15:52] him this writer and all these Kingdom
[1:15:54] subjects that are slaying down to the
[1:15:56] age of strong all this Blood of the
[1:15:58] martyrs of the Saints will be slain By
[1:16:00] The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes
[1:16:03] you go back and read Fox's book of
[1:16:05] Martyrs I challenge you to do it Glory
[1:16:07] it's hard reading schmucker's glorious
[1:16:09] Revelation is a revolution or
[1:16:12] Reformation rather it's hard reading
[1:16:14] it's difficult but you find out what
[1:16:17] they did to the people especially during
[1:16:19] the Spanish Inquisition when they went
[1:16:21] in and and invented all kinds of
[1:16:23] instruments of torture killed over two
[1:16:25] million in Spain alone
[1:16:28] of Protestants killed them and for every
[1:16:31] every way that they could possibly kill
[1:16:33] him and torture them they did it and
[1:16:35] they got blood on their hands but I'm
[1:16:37] thankful that I don't have to make it up
[1:16:40] I don't have to fight but the sword of
[1:16:42] Jesus Christ will take care of it when
[1:16:45] he comes
[1:16:46] he said they took the sword now watch
[1:16:48] what the sword is
[1:16:50] they took the sword of Dogma
[1:16:53] look you see it don't matter what you
[1:16:55] believe what what's this sword made out
[1:16:57] of Dogma before it could become an
[1:17:00] action where they begin to actually
[1:17:01] crucify people it was a Dogma
[1:17:04] now you think about it every false
[1:17:06] Doctrine tries to separate you from your
[1:17:08] family
[1:17:10] I'm just being honest with you tonight
[1:17:12] and open I feel like coming down there
[1:17:14] and preaching where you are but I'd have
[1:17:15] to scatter myself
[1:17:17] all over the church but but every false
[1:17:20] Doctrine every cult has to make you
[1:17:22] separate from your family
[1:17:24] separate from everybody that disagrees
[1:17:26] with you only only come in with just a
[1:17:29] few and you know we're the only ones
[1:17:31] that's right well why did they do that
[1:17:33] why do they do that it's it's a sort of
[1:17:36] Dogma
[1:17:37] before it becomes something that
[1:17:39] actually kills
[1:17:41] it's a sort of dogmatic thinking we
[1:17:43] should not be that way
[1:17:45] we don't carry a sword of Dogma well
[1:17:48] this is what our church teaches you got
[1:17:50] to be like us or you're not going to
[1:17:51] make it it's a sort of Dogma a sort of
[1:17:54] dogma and Antichrist and cut down the
[1:17:56] real true worshipers all down Through
[1:17:57] the Ages he said to well the Millions
[1:18:00] when Christ comes with the sword he's
[1:18:03] got a sword too for it's his word that
[1:18:06] proceeds out of his mouth
[1:18:08] what do we fight with we don't fight
[1:18:10] with emotion we don't fight with
[1:18:12] sensation we don't but it's the sword
[1:18:15] the word is the sword or the sword as
[1:18:18] they call it in Oklahoma the the word is
[1:18:21] the sword
[1:18:23] and and what is it Christ comes with his
[1:18:26] word
[1:18:27] not with a literal sword but with this
[1:18:29] word
[1:18:30] think about it for a minute the word
[1:18:32] that proceeds out of his mouth he'll say
[1:18:34] every enemy there is before him go read
[1:18:37] Revelation 19. again he said you might
[1:18:39] have killed 68 million of them down to
[1:18:41] these ages send sin maybe more but Jesus
[1:18:44] said he that takes the sword will perish
[1:18:47] by it what was it a sword of Dogma they
[1:18:50] took a sword of Dogma which actually
[1:18:52] become a literal sword and he takes a
[1:18:55] sword of the word
[1:18:56] and saves him now do you realize the age
[1:18:59] we live in the Bible said the word of
[1:19:01] God is quick it's alive and powerful and
[1:19:04] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:19:06] what is it the word of God Satan placed
[1:19:08] United the political Powers which he
[1:19:10] held and the spiritual powers that he
[1:19:12] held together made a church that sweeps
[1:19:14] into every nation he's put Millions
[1:19:16] times Millions after he jumped off from
[1:19:18] his White Horse onto his red horse he
[1:19:20] took his sword and went forth but God
[1:19:22] said with the same thing that he
[1:19:24] perverted
[1:19:25] watch what does he kill him with
[1:19:28] think about it the same thing he
[1:19:30] perverted or tried to by false teaching
[1:19:33] that same word will rise in power coming
[1:19:38] forth from the lips of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:41] shall say him and everything before him
[1:19:46] he said there's the second seal
[1:19:49] Hallelujah he said that's
[1:19:52] thus saith the Lord
[1:19:54] that's powerful
[1:19:57] huh
[1:20:01] I was talking to a preacher on the phone
[1:20:02] today and I said if you left a sermon
[1:20:06] what would you want the effect of that
[1:20:07] sermon to be what would be the greatest
[1:20:09] effect
[1:20:10] that a sermon could have
[1:20:13] think about it for a minute I I've
[1:20:14] thought deeply about this
[1:20:16] what would be the greatest effect
[1:20:18] that someone was healed that would be
[1:20:20] wonderful wouldn't it someone you you
[1:20:22] could raise the faith of people by
[1:20:24] preaching the word of God to somebody
[1:20:25] got healed It's a Wonderful effect it's
[1:20:27] an effect of the word
[1:20:29] but yet that wouldn't be the greatest
[1:20:31] effect even someone that was saved that
[1:20:34] would be a great effect
[1:20:36] and I believe that we're saved by the
[1:20:38] preaching of the word but I got to
[1:20:40] thinking about what preaching to the
[1:20:41] church day after day and year after year
[1:20:43] what do I want to see
[1:20:45] I want to see I want to see people leave
[1:20:48] with confidence in the message of the
[1:20:50] hour
[1:20:52] that what we believe is thus saith the
[1:20:54] Lord
[1:20:56] I'm not talking about every word and and
[1:20:58] then the things that people have taught
[1:21:00] the doctrines of devils that people have
[1:21:02] taught I'm talking about the message
[1:21:04] the message of the hour we don't serve
[1:21:07] brother Abraham we don't worship brother
[1:21:08] brown but I want to I want you to leave
[1:21:10] and I want you to recognize that the
[1:21:12] message of the hour is right
[1:21:15] and if you recognize that the message if
[1:21:17] I could get into your minds that the
[1:21:19] message of the hour is real that it that
[1:21:22] it affects you in your everyday life
[1:21:23] that there's something about if I can
[1:21:25] get you to dig in it if I can get you to
[1:21:27] love it if I can get you to to press
[1:21:29] into it I believe that's the greatest
[1:21:31] effect that my preaching could have
[1:21:33] to highlight the word of the day
[1:21:36] to emphasize on the word of the day
[1:21:39] the Lord's been dealing with me about
[1:21:41] that what do we put emphasis on we ought
[1:21:43] to put emphasis on the word of the hour
[1:21:44] and if I could get the emphasis the
[1:21:47] light to shine on the word of the hour
[1:21:49] I've done my job
[1:21:50] believe the holy spirit's done his job
[1:21:52] oh I trust you leave here and you can
[1:21:54] say I heard the words of a prophet I
[1:21:56] didn't just hear the words of my pastor
[1:21:58] I heard the words of a prophet and he
[1:21:59] said that's the saith the Lord
[1:22:02] amen amen
[1:22:03] Hallelujah
[1:22:05] musicians go ahead and come
[1:22:09] brother Branham talks about the little
[1:22:11] animals at the end of the second seal
[1:22:14] talks about the little birds
[1:22:16] he said they all in in India they said
[1:22:18] they have rock walls he said they all go
[1:22:20] to those walls and they hide in the heat
[1:22:23] of the day they hide in the cool of
[1:22:25] those walls
[1:22:26] he said the sheep and the cattle will
[1:22:28] gather around the walls lay there in the
[1:22:31] shade
[1:22:33] he said but he saw a headline in the
[1:22:34] paper said the earthquake must be over
[1:22:36] said because the birds are coming back
[1:22:40] and they talked about how that during
[1:22:42] this time before an earthquake ever came
[1:22:45] that the Sheep all huddled together in
[1:22:47] the middle of the field oh isn't that
[1:22:48] where you want to be
[1:22:49] in the middle of the field
[1:22:52] huddled together he said the Sheep all
[1:22:54] huddled together the cattle all huddled
[1:22:56] together the birds flew away
[1:22:58] why because those rock walls were going
[1:23:01] to become dangerous pretty soon and they
[1:23:03] sensed that something was going to
[1:23:05] happen they were warned by Instinct
[1:23:08] there was an earthquake coming or if he
[1:23:11] could warn the birds that there's danger
[1:23:12] coming he talked about that at the end
[1:23:14] of the second seal he said get away from
[1:23:16] those denominational walls you don't
[1:23:18] know what this message has done for us
[1:23:20] it's brought us out into the open
[1:23:22] brought us into the middle of the field
[1:23:23] where we could come together
[1:23:26] we're not just another church
[1:23:28] we're Believers together get away from
[1:23:30] those walls and begin to see God move
[1:23:32] once you bow your heads with me can we
[1:23:34] can you play let me walk with you Jesus
[1:23:36] you know that one F I believe
[1:23:44] I wonder if we could just talk to him
[1:23:47] for a minute I know it's a Wednesday
[1:23:48] night but
[1:23:50] we'll have church again on Sunday
[1:23:55] but aren't you don't you want to just
[1:23:57] take a minute and say Lord I believe
[1:23:58] your word is true

[1:24:03] come to pass I believe that you're the
[1:24:05] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:24:08] believe in thus saith the Lord
[1:24:10] I believe it came in our day
[1:24:13] I believe that we have a message we can
[1:24:16] go forth we don't have to take our own
[1:24:18] swords and fight people
[1:24:20] but the sword is the word of the Lord
[1:24:25] Lord I want to thank you for that that's
[1:24:26] my prayer tonight Lord

[1:24:35] and everything Lord that said or done
[1:24:38] Lord and as we go we get busy in life
[1:24:41] but Lord as we're praying together now

[1:24:47] emphasis on the right things

[1:24:52] a bun or a bunch of people who believe
[1:24:54] like we do but Lord may we look to the
[1:24:56] message of the hour the light of the day
