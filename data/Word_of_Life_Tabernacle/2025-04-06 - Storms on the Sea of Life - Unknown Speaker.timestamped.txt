[42:11] And I I we were over at youth camp last
[42:13] week and you know I saw some of them
[42:15] young people. Brother Ryan was there and
[42:17] and how how the Lord just moved on them.
[42:19] And I tell you what, we want to thank
[42:20] the Lord for that. But right here this
[42:22] morning as little creators, we need to
[42:24] create an atmosphere that God would be
[42:26] pleased with. Don't you think so? Amen.
[42:28] I wonder if we could just invite him to
[42:30] fall upon us this morning and move
[42:32] however he chooses to move on us this
[42:34] morning. Amen. with all your hearts now.
[42:36] Holy
[42:38] Spirit, fall on this
[42:42] place. Oh, Father, fill
[42:46] us with your love and
[42:49] grace. Shine your
[42:53] anointing on every
[42:57] face. Oh, Holy
[43:00] Spirit, fall on. Oh, let me hear you
[43:03] sing with all your hearts. Oh, holy
[43:11] spir and
[43:13] father
[43:15] us with love and
[43:19] grace. Shine your
[43:22] anointing on every face.
[43:27] Oh, Holy
[43:30] Spirit, fall on one more time with all
[43:32] your hearts. Oh yes, Holy
[43:37] Spirit, fall on this
[43:41] place. And Father, fill us with your
[43:46] love and
[43:48] grace. Shine your
[43:52] anointing on every face.
[43:56] Oh, Holy
[43:59] Spirit. Oh, I wonder if you just put
[44:01] your hands up to me and sing it one more
[44:03] time. Oh, Holy
[44:05] [Applause]
[44:06] Spirit, fall on this
[44:10] place. Father, fill us with your love
[44:16] and
[44:17] grace. Shine your
[44:21] anointing on every face.
[44:26] Oh, Holy
[44:28] Spirit, fall on this
[44:32] place. Give the Lord one more hand if
[44:34] you
[44:35] would. Amen. You ready for the word of
[44:37] the Lord this morning? Amen. I I believe
[44:40] this morning we just open our hearts.
[44:41] The Lord will do whatever we have need
[44:43] of. Amen. and you come out, you know,
[44:45] it's storming on the outside and the
[44:47] rains are falling. But I'd say this
[44:49] morning, I want the rain to fall on the
[44:51] inside because, you know, in a time, I
[44:54] believe the pastor preached that I was
[44:55] gone, but he preached on how the desert
[44:57] got dry. And we don't want to be dry. We
[45:00] don't want to be sticking at one
[45:01] another. We want to be sweet and loving,
[45:03] and the only thing that can do that is
[45:04] the Holy Ghost inside of us. And so, I
[45:07] would say, Lord, I need more of you this
[45:08] morning. And if that's your prayer, I
[45:10] wonder if we could just sing this with
[45:12] all our hearts more than ever before.
[45:15] Lord, I love you. But I want him to come
[45:17] by my way this morning. If you do, could
[45:18] you just lift a hand up to
[45:20] him?
[45:22] Ever
[45:24] before. Let me hear you sing it now. Oh,
[45:28] more than
[45:31] ever
[45:33] before, Lord, I love you.
[45:39] more than
[45:42] ever
[45:43] before. Lord, I need
[45:49] you. And more than
[45:52] ever
[45:54] before, I've got to tell
[46:00] you, I love you
[46:03] now more than ever.
[46:07] before. If you love him, can you just
[46:09] put a hand up to him as you sing it now?
[46:12] Oh, more than
[46:15] ever
[46:16] before. Lord, I love
[46:20] you. Yes, we
[46:22] do. More than
[46:26] ever
[46:27] before, Lord, I need you. Do you need
[46:32] him this morning? Oh, more than
[46:37] ever
[46:38] before, I'd like to tell
[46:42] you, oh, I need you
[46:44] now. I need you
[46:47] now more than
[46:50] ever before. Can we raise our hands,
[46:53] James, one more time? Oh, more than
[46:59] ever before.
[47:02] Lord, I need you more.
[47:07] Lord, more than
[47:10] ever
[47:12] before. Oh Lord, I love
[47:15] you. Oh
[47:18] yes, more than
[47:21] ever
[47:23] before. I've got to tell
[47:28] you I need you now.
[47:33] more than
[47:36] ever
[47:38] before. We bow our heads together for a
[47:40] word of
[47:42] prayer. Heavenly Father, we need you now
[47:45] at this time more than we ever have. I
[47:48] pray God that you'd help us to not only
[47:51] know our need, but to acknowledge that
[47:53] you're the one that can fill it. Lord, I
[47:56] thank you for doing that today. I pray
[47:59] God that you'd just move in a mighty
[48:00] way, Lord, in our midst this morning. I
[48:03] don't know all the needs represented,
[48:05] but you do. And I pray, God, you'd meet
[48:07] those needs today. Pray you'd heal the
[48:10] sick. Touch those that are in need.
[48:12] Touch my body, Lord. Each one of these
[48:14] that are here, those that couldn't make
[48:16] it that are watching, Lord. I pray you'd
[48:18] bless them especially today. Keep them
[48:20] safe. We pray. We thank you for all that
[48:22] you've done. We love you this morning in
[48:25] Jesus' name.
[48:27] Amen. Thank the
[48:30] Lord. Amen. Psalm chapter 107, we're
[48:35] going to read verses 23 through 31.
[48:38] Psalms
[48:40] 107:23-31. Sister Clelet, so good to see
[48:43] you back there this morning. I I know
[48:45] you were here last week, but I wasn't.
[48:47] So, we sure good so good to see you. I
[48:50] know she's been sick for a while and not
[48:52] able to come. And uh we're glad the
[48:54] folks are able to come from West Plains
[48:57] and Pocahontas and different areas.
[48:59] Thank the Lord for that. And and we
[49:01] didn't think that'd be possible last
[49:03] night, but the Lord made a way. And so
[49:05] we're so grateful to see all of you all
[49:07] here this morning. Psalms
[49:11] 107:23 says, "They that go down to the
[49:14] sea in ships, that do business in great
[49:17] waters, these see the works of the Lord,
[49:21] and his his wonders in the deep. For he
[49:25] commandeth and raisth the stormy wind,
[49:28] which lifteth up the waves
[49:30] thereof. They mount up to the heaven.
[49:33] They go down again to the depths. Their
[49:35] soul is melted because of trouble. They
[49:39] reel to and fro and stagger like a
[49:41] drunken man and are at their wits end. I
[49:45] don't know about you, but I identify
[49:46] with this scripture sometimes.
[49:50] Then they cry unto the Lord in their
[49:52] trouble. I identify with this, too. And
[49:55] he bringeth them out of their
[49:57] distresses.
[49:59] He maketh the storm a calm, so that the
[50:03] waves thereof are still. Then are they
[50:07] glad because they be quiet. So he
[50:10] bringeth them unto their desired haven.
[50:13] Oh, that men would praise the Lord for
[50:16] his goodness, for his wonderful works to
[50:18] the children of men. I pray the Lord
[50:21] would add his blessing to the word. You
[50:22] may be
[50:25] seated. Well, Walt, good to see you back
[50:27] there this morning. And God bless you,
[50:29] each one of
[50:30] you. I don't guess there's a more
[50:32] helpless feeling than being in a boat.
[50:36] Even being on the edge of the ocean is a
[50:39] pretty helpless feeling when you see the
[50:41] waves. And and if you ever get out in
[50:44] it, I'm not I don't swim. And you know,
[50:47] they they say that some of the guys who
[50:50] go out in kayaks on the ocean, they'll
[50:52] cross the ocean in a kayak, which seems
[50:55] like an incredibly stupid idea, but they
[50:58] say that some of those folks, there have
[50:59] been folks do that that couldn't swim,
[51:02] that they actually crossed the ocean on
[51:03] a kayak and couldn't swim. And that
[51:05] doesn't make any sense to me at all
[51:07] because there's no more helpless feeling
[51:09] than standing at the edge of the ocean
[51:11] and recognizing that there's nothing you
[51:14] can do about it, right? like if it
[51:15] decides to act up, there's nothing you
[51:18] can do about it. And even if you're on a
[51:20] boat, even if you're on a big boat, the
[51:22] the wind, there's always the potential
[51:25] for a storm that can upset your ship,
[51:28] that can take you down. And so, uh, you
[51:31] you have that helpless feeling. And I
[51:33] think that's a a metaphor for life
[51:36] itself, that we actually, uh, get in
[51:39] such a place that we, uh, we feel like
[51:42] that we're it's helpless. And we feel
[51:44] like these men did in Psalms 107 that uh
[51:48] you you you're reeling from life. You
[51:50] you find yourself staggering uh as if
[51:54] like a drunken man and you're at your
[51:56] wit's end and and you just don't
[51:58] understand what way to go or what's
[52:00] happening in your life or as blow after
[52:03] blow after blow comes to you from the
[52:06] enemy and and you you felt like that.
[52:08] I've felt like that many times. And yet
[52:11] we recognize this morning that our
[52:13] journey is divinely orchestrated. That
[52:17] we did not set out on this journey by
[52:19] ourselves. If we could see ourselves as
[52:22] the boat, our life, these bodies as
[52:25] boats on the ocean and our lives as
[52:28] being a journey that we're taking. If we
[52:31] would see that and excuse me this
[52:33] morning, we would recognize that that we
[52:36] are not helpless because the person that
[52:39] chartered this ship is the all powerful
[52:42] God. The one who made the ocean, the one
[52:45] who created the heavens and the earth is
[52:48] actually the one who who divinely
[52:51] orchestrated this trip. And we know that
[52:53] the Bible says in Romans 8:14 that as
[52:56] many as are led by the spirit of God,
[52:58] they are the sons of God, but we can't
[53:02] always tell how he leads. I know many
[53:05] times with young people and young
[53:06] couples, I it seems like people expect
[53:09] to hear the voice of God in an audible
[53:12] way. And that could happen. I believe
[53:14] God could do that. Many times it seems
[53:16] like people are expecting uh maybe a
[53:19] direct word over the pulpit or or
[53:21] somebody to speak to them in in a prayer
[53:23] line situation and tell them just
[53:26] exactly what to do or or or how to uh
[53:30] react to certain things in their life.
[53:32] But many times that's not how he leads
[53:34] us at all. In fact, many times we're out
[53:36] there on the ocean and he's actually
[53:38] waiting on us to do something. He's
[53:40] waiting on a response. He's testing us
[53:42] to see what our response will be to the
[53:45] trial that we're in because he actually
[53:48] led us into this trial. But I'm here to
[53:50] tell you this morning, if he led you
[53:51] into it, he can lead you out of it.
[53:55] But we need him this morning. How many
[53:57] could acknowledge that we need him? And
[53:59] if you, you know, you don't think you
[54:00] need this message until you get out on
[54:02] the sto in the storms of life and you
[54:04] recognize I needed the message. I I
[54:06] needed the teaching that I've been
[54:08] taught. I needed I needed to know that
[54:10] God was real in the hour that I live in.
[54:12] I needed that. I I recognize I needed
[54:14] it. Many of our young people don't
[54:16] realize they need it till they get out
[54:17] on their own and they get to uh maybe
[54:20] doing some things they shouldn't be
[54:21] doing and they realize, "Oh, I needed
[54:23] that. I needed that. I I really needed
[54:26] the message of the hour." Right.
[54:33] Y'all forgive me this morning. I've been
[54:35] dealing with I'm not sick. I've been
[54:37] dealing with uh congestion for weeks and
[54:40] just can't seem to shake it. But it's
[54:41] just the time of year. And but I believe
[54:44] he's piloting the ship. How many believe
[54:45] that today?
[54:47] The
[54:48] healer is piloting the ship. He he he
[54:51] set you he chartered your ship and chose
[54:54] you. See, you weren't looking for him.
[54:57] That's right. He came looking for you. I
[54:59] was just sailing along doing my my own
[55:02] thing and had my own uh my own future in
[55:05] mind. But he chartered a ship so that he
[55:08] chartered my ship and chose me and
[55:11] revealed himself to me and showed me the
[55:13] message of the hour and revealed to me
[55:15] that was not just the son of John and
[55:17] Sharon Puit, but I'm the son of a son of
[55:19] God. And when he revealed that to me,
[55:21] what happened is he he was making
[55:23] himself known. He said, "I'm with you.
[55:25] I'll be with you. Even when you don't
[55:27] feel me, I'm there. Even when you can't
[55:29] see me, I'm there. Even when there's a
[55:31] lull in the revival, I'm still there.
[55:34] Yes. At every moment of your life, sir.
[55:37] So, we can't always tell how he's
[55:39] leading. Brother Brandham even says that
[55:41] God doesn't always tell his prophets
[55:42] everything,
[55:44] right? I think sometimes we think, well,
[55:45] if I could just get to a prophet, if I
[55:47] could just get to the to brother
[55:48] Brandham, if he was still alive, he'd
[55:50] tell me what to do. But God don't always
[55:52] tell his prophets everything. You don't
[55:54] always tell his men of God everything.
[55:56] Sometimes he'll tell me something about
[55:58] somebody else and there's things about
[56:00] my own life I wish I knew. Right. Right.
[56:03] And there's things decisions but he
[56:04] brother Brandon said he wants us to make
[56:06] decisions. Right. Oh yeah. Right. He
[56:08] wants us to he wants us to uh to see
[56:12] what decision that we'll make. And so
[56:15] brother Brandham even said that prophets
[56:16] could be deceived in that way. Not in
[56:18] the word but when it comes to their
[56:20] decisions that they have to make. they
[56:22] could make wrong choices and and so how
[56:24] much more could we make wrong choices
[56:26] and and even be deceived at times and
[56:29] yet we realize that he's always the one
[56:31] leading right so he leads us maybe in a
[56:34] different way than what we think look
[56:35] how Job describes the leading of the
[56:38] Lord in in a time when it seemed like in
[56:40] his life that he could not he could not
[56:43] feel God he he just couldn't grab a hold
[56:46] of what God was doing in his situation
[56:49] he he just couldn't understand it Right?
[56:51] And so Job in Job 23:8, he said,
[56:54] "Behold, I go forward, but he's not
[56:56] there and backward, but I cannot
[56:59] perceive him in my situation." Have you
[57:02] ever felt like that? I'm in a situation
[57:04] that I just can't tell where he's at at
[57:06] all in it. I don't feel him. I don't see
[57:09] him. I can't tell that he's there. I
[57:10] know he is because of the word, but I
[57:12] can't perceive him in my situation. I
[57:16] can't see how he's working. I don't know
[57:18] how this could be for my good, but we're
[57:20] resting in the promised church. He said
[57:22] it'll be for my good,
[57:27] but I can't perceive it. He said on the
[57:29] left hand where he does work. So, in
[57:32] other words, I can see his work. So, I'm
[57:33] like the the the sailor on the ocean
[57:36] that David described. I know he's
[57:38] working because I see his works. I I see
[57:41] his his movement. I see him working for
[57:43] other people. I see the wind. I see the
[57:46] waves. But I I know he's working in
[57:48] that. Yeah. But I cannot behold him. He
[57:52] hideth himself on the right hand that I
[57:56] cannot see him. So he says, "I go
[57:58] forward. I go backward. I go left. I go
[58:01] right. And I can't find God anywhere." I
[58:04] know some of y'all are real spiritual
[58:06] and every day you talk to God four or
[58:08] five times a day and angels come down,
[58:09] eat fried chicken with you on Wednesdays
[58:11] and and it's just a wonderful time. But
[58:13] I tell you what, there's times by the
[58:14] West I can't feel him. I can't perceive
[58:17] him. I don't know where he is, but I
[58:19] know he's good early. And uh Esther and
[58:22] and Britney don't do that.
[58:25] But but uh anyway, my grandpa told us he
[58:30] said if you were if you're 5 minutes
[58:31] late, he said, "You lied to me." So that
[58:33] that's just the way he was. So that's
[58:35] kind of the way we were raised. Well, my
[58:36] dad wasn't that way, but my grandpa was.
[58:39] But if you think about it, when Jesus
[58:41] promised you would be somewhere, he's
[58:44] not just there. He's there before you
[58:47] got there.
[58:49] Because he's not limited by the space
[58:50] and time that you are.
[58:53] Amen. So whatever situation you come
[58:56] into, whatever storm you come into, when
[58:59] when the when the furnace was heated up,
[59:01] he was already there waiting on them in
[59:04] the f in the furnace. So brother
[59:06] Brandham says he's he's here. He keeps
[59:08] his appointments always. He says this.
[59:11] He said he leaves glory maybe a little
[59:13] early.
[59:15] Hallelujah.
[59:16] So he can get there on get here on time.
[59:20] You thought he was late and he was
[59:22] actually early. Yes. Are are you with me
[59:25] now? They thought he was late at the
[59:27] tomb of Lazarus, but he was actually
[59:29] there all the time. He knew what was
[59:31] going on. He knew that Lazarus would
[59:33] die. He knew exactly what time to call
[59:35] Lazarus back from the dead.
[59:37] He may let you go through some pains.
[59:39] You may experience some fire. You may
[59:41] experience some some problems. You may
[59:43] have some trouble in life. But before
[59:45] you got there, he was already there. He
[59:48] had already investigated. You know, the
[59:49] secret service before the president
[59:51] comes to town, they investigate and they
[59:53] look through all the pitfalls and all
[59:54] the things that might happen. But
[59:56] because they're human beings, sometimes
[59:58] even they overlook some obvious things.
[1:00:00] But he's been there before you. The Holy
[1:00:02] Ghost has went before you before you
[1:00:04] ever went through a trial and
[1:00:06] investigated the trial. He knows all
[1:00:08] about the sickness. He knows all about
[1:00:09] it. And he he wouldn't lead you into it
[1:00:11] unless he'd already investigated. He was
[1:00:14] already there before you
[1:00:17] got was up early for
[1:00:58] as
[1:01:01] much. He said, "Lord, I don't know how
[1:01:03] to how handle all these people. I don't
[1:01:05] know how to feed them. I don't know what
[1:01:06] to do with them, Lord." He said, "I need
[1:01:08] your help." He said, "If you don't go
[1:01:09] with me, don't send me." And I feel like
[1:01:11] that many times as a pastor, Lord, I
[1:01:13] don't know what to do. I don't know
[1:01:14] what's next. I realize we live in a dark
[1:01:16] age. We live in a horrible time.
[1:01:58] ships even as he was. It's important.
[1:02:00] Brother Brandon said, "Take him the way
[1:02:02] he's presented to you." Yeah. Take him
[1:02:06] in the ship. He was tired.
[1:02:13] He was a man but they took him as he
[1:02:17] was. Yes, sir. Oh my. When you take him
[1:02:20] as he is, he will be what you take him
[1:02:23] to be. Now think about it for a minute.
[1:02:26] He can only be what you take him to be.
[1:02:29] If you take him I if you think you see
[1:02:32] the the Pharisees thought he should come
[1:02:34] down as a king. Yeah. So they could not
[1:02:37] take him as he was. Into their ship,
[1:02:40] right? They thought he had to come a
[1:02:42] certain way. And it's a dangerous thing
[1:02:44] to to begin to to make God try to put
[1:02:47] him in a place where he can only move
[1:02:49] this way. He brings you to a place and
[1:02:51] there's a lol in the revival because he
[1:02:52] wants to see what you're going to do
[1:02:55] with what you've seen done. Amen.
[1:03:00] Are you going to believe God's a healer?
[1:03:02] You going to believe he can deliver your
[1:03:04] children? You going to believe he can
[1:03:06] take care of you? Amen.
[1:03:08] see that their revival was in the boat
[1:03:12] the whole time. He was just waiting on
[1:03:14] them to call on him to call Jesus on the
[1:03:19] scene. We know that he was, as brother
[1:03:21] Brandon puts it, both
[1:03:22] mechanics and dynamics laying in the
[1:03:26] boat. He was not only the mechanics,
[1:03:27] God's word, he was the dynamics to prove
[1:03:30] it. Again, he said he died so he could
[1:03:32] come himself into that word. So when we
[1:03:35] see Christ and when we say the message
[1:03:37] is Christ, we're not talking about dead
[1:03:39] letter, we're talking about the message
[1:03:41] being not only the word, but the
[1:03:44] fulfillment of it. Not only the word,
[1:03:46] but the power to become sons and
[1:03:47] daughters of God, right? And and we have
[1:03:50] both of that. We're not waiting on that.
[1:03:52] We have that. He's in the boat. He died
[1:03:55] so he could come himself into that word.
[1:03:57] He is the quickening life that makes
[1:03:59] that word live again. That was his
[1:04:01] purpose of dying. he can still project
[1:04:03] himself through his church and make
[1:04:04] every word through every age act just
[1:04:07] exactly the way it's supposed to act.
[1:04:10] It's the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:04:11] together him in our boat right in our
[1:04:15] bodies that makes the word act like it's
[1:04:17] supposed to act in 2025. Yes, sir.
[1:04:21] Right. He We're not looking for another
[1:04:23] day. We're not trying to go back to
[1:04:24] another age, but we're actually make
[1:04:26] he's making the word act the way it's
[1:04:28] supposed to act today
[1:04:30] in
[1:04:31] us. He is the dynamics of the mechanics.
[1:04:36] He said the mechanics of the churches,
[1:04:38] apostles, prophets, teachers, so forth.
[1:04:39] And he is the dynamics that works that.
[1:04:42] He is the fire that's in the combustion
[1:04:43] chamber. When the gas, the word is
[1:04:45] poured over that combustion chamber. He
[1:04:47] is the one that sets through a fire.
[1:04:49] He's the one that confirms it. He's the
[1:04:50] power of the resurrection. He is God.
[1:04:53] Amen. He is the fire. That's what he is.
[1:04:56] Notice when this great moving power of
[1:04:58] God comes into a son of God, it quickens
[1:04:59] him. The spirit of life enters into him.
[1:05:02] You say, "Well, I got the mechanics, but
[1:05:04] I need the dynamics." No, you need to
[1:05:06] wake him up or you need to be born
[1:05:08] again.
[1:05:10] Because if you're born again today by
[1:05:11] the spirit of God, you have him in the
[1:05:13] boat. And if he's in the boat, he's able
[1:05:17] to quiet the storm. He's able to do it.
[1:05:19] But he's allowed you to get to the place
[1:05:21] where you're at right now because he
[1:05:22] wants to hear your voice. Right, sir.
[1:05:25] Hallelujah. He said now he said what
[1:05:28] does it do? He said it quickens him. It
[1:05:29] seats him in heavenly places right now.
[1:05:32] Not they will be. We are now. Now we've
[1:05:35] already resurrected. The dynamics and
[1:05:36] mechanics has gone to work. Quickened us
[1:05:38] and we're quickened up into the presence
[1:05:39] of God where his spirit is. Now someone
[1:05:42] say now we are seated together in
[1:05:44] heavenly places in we're not waiting on
[1:05:46] brother Brandham to come back. We're not
[1:05:48] waiting on some great preacher. We're
[1:05:49] not waiting on revival to come one day.
[1:05:51] He's right here now. Amen.
[1:05:55] Yes, sir. Now, if you've been born
[1:05:58] again, hallelujah, you got the token on
[1:06:00] your life now. Yes, sir. You've been
[1:06:02] raised up in heavenly places. He said,
[1:06:05] "Sitting there, that great seed is
[1:06:06] already fired up. You don't need to be
[1:06:08] fired up. You've already been fired up.
[1:06:10] You need to get back to that original
[1:06:12] fire."
[1:06:14] Hallelujah. He said, "Listen, he's
[1:06:16] already fired up. been raised from the
[1:06:17] dead. We're part of it. If you're a part
[1:06:18] of the bride, you are because the
[1:06:19] bride's part of the groom. So, we find
[1:06:21] out it's the same thing. And she'll do
[1:06:23] just exactly what's predicted for her to
[1:06:25] do in this day. She won't be a Leoa. Not
[1:06:28] by no means a lukewarm, but she'll be on
[1:06:31] fire for God. People use Leodysia as an
[1:06:33] excuse.
[1:06:35] It's not an excuse for the bride. She's
[1:06:37] the overcomer of Leodysia.
[1:06:40] But she'll be on fire for God. She'll be
[1:06:41] moving on in the spirit of God.
[1:06:44] The mechanics and the dynamics was in
[1:06:46] the boat. Everything we needed to bake
[1:06:49] the cake.
[1:06:51] Everything we needed to make the car go
[1:06:52] down the road sitting right there. But
[1:06:55] you got to call on him.
[1:06:57] You got to use the key of faith and turn
[1:06:59] it and believe that it'll start at the
[1:07:03] moment that you need it. Remember
[1:07:06] brother Brandham tells that story. I
[1:07:08] thought of it yesterday as the rescuers
[1:07:09] out here on the swift water rescuing the
[1:07:12] people. I thought of that story brother
[1:07:13] Brandham tells about being out on the
[1:07:15] water and how that he disobeyed God. He
[1:07:18] got in trouble. He gets out there on the
[1:07:20] on the water and he's he's out there and
[1:07:22] his boat won't start and he's going
[1:07:25] towards the falls. He's pulling that
[1:07:27] pulling that pulling that. God, I'm
[1:07:28] sorry. I'll preach wherever you want me
[1:07:30] to preach. You know how we get when we
[1:07:32] get in a storm.
[1:07:34] But God wasn't going to allow his
[1:07:36] prophet to die. He had a work for him to
[1:07:38] do. That's how I know God did. God saved
[1:07:41] him from death so many times. That's how
[1:07:42] I know when he when he did go, it wasn't
[1:07:44] an accident. He was done with it, right?
[1:07:47] With his earthly ministry. But I'm glad
[1:07:49] he left a message for us, right? But but
[1:07:52] but we don't he don't have to come back
[1:07:54] because he did everything he was
[1:07:55] supposed to do. But he was out there and
[1:07:58] pulling and pulling and pulling, but
[1:08:00] then it caught,
[1:08:02] right? Sometimes we feel like that with
[1:08:03] our faith. We're out there pulling and
[1:08:05] pulling and pulling. But just keep
[1:08:07] pulling. If you got confidence that the
[1:08:10] one that put you on this journey would
[1:08:11] not have given you a defective engine.
[1:08:13] He would not have put you without the
[1:08:15] mechanics and the dynamics to make it
[1:08:16] work. You just keep on pulling. Keep on
[1:08:18] believing for your healing. By your
[1:08:20] stripes, I'm healed. I know I'm healed.
[1:08:22] I know my children are going to be
[1:08:24] saved. Keep on pulling. Keep on pulling.
[1:08:27] Don't give up now. The falls are right
[1:08:29] ahead. But keep on pulling. You'll be
[1:08:31] there. You're going to make it. Amen.
[1:08:34] Why? Because he's in your boat.
[1:08:39] Brother Brandham said, "The mechanics is
[1:08:40] here and so is the dynamics. If you can
[1:08:43] just get
[1:08:45] started, Hallelujah. I don't like two
[1:08:48] cycle engines cuz they're so hard to
[1:08:50] start." That's a problem. I think a lot
[1:08:52] of us are running on two cycle engines.
[1:08:54] We're just It's just so hard to start.
[1:08:55] You know, we're out there pulling. God,
[1:08:58] help me to realize in this day you can
[1:09:00] give me a key of faith. I can just turn
[1:09:02] the key and it'll start up.
[1:09:04] Amen. But I got to have faith to do
[1:09:07] it. Look, you can just get started. God
[1:09:10] will do the rest. All they had to do was
[1:09:15] wake him
[1:09:17] up. Out there rowing, trying to make
[1:09:19] money, you know. If I get enough money,
[1:09:22] I'll be happy. It won't
[1:09:27] work. Trying to quiet your conscience,
[1:09:29] you know. Well, if I could just if I
[1:09:32] could just get respect from the people
[1:09:34] around me. I know I don't know why I'm
[1:09:37] going this direction, but I know there's
[1:09:38] kids in the message that live under
[1:09:40] that. That's right. How do you know
[1:09:42] where been? Cuz I
[1:09:43] did. You live under that. You want to be
[1:09:45] normal? Yeah. And you feel like, well,
[1:09:49] you know, if I could just get people to
[1:09:52] to love me,
[1:09:54] people in the world, normal people.
[1:09:57] But I got into ministry at a young age
[1:09:59] and I quickly figured out there ain't
[1:10:01] nobody that don't have trouble.
[1:10:04] In the message, out of the message,
[1:10:07] no home is as happy as you think it is.
[1:10:10] And some that look a bad situation,
[1:10:13] maybe not as bad as you think it is. Cuz
[1:10:16] you don't know what goes on in that
[1:10:17] home. And I learned that the world had
[1:10:20] nothing to offer me. Trying to get
[1:10:22] respect from the world. And I I get I
[1:10:24] want us to be a church that is a light
[1:10:26] to our community and and the people. I
[1:10:29] want them to love us, but they're not
[1:10:31] always going to love us. They're not
[1:10:33] always going to love you ladies the way
[1:10:34] that you dress. They're not always going
[1:10:35] to love our our young people the way
[1:10:37] that they act and things. They're not
[1:10:39] always going to do it. You're not always
[1:10:40] going to be rewarded for welloing. If
[1:10:43] everybody speaks good of you, you know,
[1:10:44] there's a
[1:10:45] problem. We can't live our lives looking
[1:10:48] for that. But we got to look at the
[1:10:49] master. Lord, what do you want? What do
[1:10:52] you want? I'm not going to live under
[1:10:53] that constant pressure to try to be as
[1:10:55] much like the world as I can be to fit
[1:10:57] in. But Lord, let me just live the word.
[1:11:00] Let me just believe you, Lord. I I'm
[1:11:02] going just let go of the ores and find
[1:11:04] Jesus. I know he's in the boat with me.
[1:11:07] I just need to wake him up in my life. I
[1:11:09] need to I need a stirring in my life.
[1:11:11] I'll make him say that this morning. I
[1:11:12] need a stirring in my life. Lord, I want
[1:11:15] you to wake up in my life. Yes, sir.
[1:11:20] He said, "The works that I do shall you
[1:11:23] do also." But he's now waiting to be
[1:11:25] called on the
[1:11:27] scene. He's waiting at this hour right
[1:11:29] now to prove exactly what I said about
[1:11:30] him to be so. He said, "If it isn't,
[1:11:33] then this is wrong and I'm a false
[1:11:34] witness. He's ready to be called on the
[1:11:36] scene right now to do the same things
[1:11:39] that he did." That's a powerful
[1:11:41] statement. He's ready to be called on
[1:11:44] the scene. He says, "Win the boat that
[1:11:46] we're sailing in." Let's wake Jesus
[1:11:50] in our lives.
[1:11:53] Hallelujah. You said, "Where is he?"
[1:11:55] He's right in you. I heard brother
[1:11:56] Brandham say yesterday, he said, "Where
[1:11:58] who did Jesus pray to?" He said, "He
[1:12:00] prayed to the spirit that was in him."
[1:12:02] The same Holy Ghost that you prayed to.
[1:12:06] Amen. He said, "But if the spirit of him
[1:12:08] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:12:09] on you, he that raised up Christ from
[1:12:11] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:12:13] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth on
[1:12:15] you." All that you have to do is call on
[1:12:17] him. When you face the storm on the sea
[1:12:20] of life, wake up the voice of the
[1:12:24] resurrection in
[1:12:27] you. The Bible says he was in the hinder
[1:12:30] part of the ship asleep on a pillow.
[1:12:34] He's not
[1:12:35] worried. He's not upset. I love the
[1:12:38] detail of that that he's asleep on a
[1:12:40] pillow. It It's It's like he's he's he's
[1:12:44] not just asleep, but he's
[1:12:47] comfortable. Hallelujah. Oh, he's not
[1:12:50] worried. He knows the end from the
[1:12:52] beginning. Just call him up. Wake him
[1:12:55] up. They forgot he was with them. Listen
[1:12:58] what they said. They awake him. I can
[1:13:01] just imagine.
[1:13:03] I just wish I had a sleeping kid here on
[1:13:05] the front today. Sorry, boys. I can just
[1:13:07] imagine him going to him, them going to
[1:13:09] him. Jesus, wake
[1:13:12] up. First of all, they forgot they had
[1:13:15] him. And then when they found him, they
[1:13:17] panicked. How can you be sleeping?
[1:13:21] First thing they do is actually blame
[1:13:23] him.
[1:13:28] Don't you care?
[1:13:32] Don't you care? How many times have we
[1:13:33] done that? Let's just be honest, church.
[1:13:35] Don't you care that we perish?
[1:13:39] Carest thou not that we perish? How many
[1:13:41] times have we prayed like that? Lord, do
[1:13:43] you even care about my situation? Why
[1:13:46] are you asleep? Right. He said, I was
[1:13:49] just waiting on you to ask.
[1:13:53] We're just waking on you. Waiting on you
[1:13:55] to wake me up.
[1:13:59] They accuse him of not
[1:14:01] caring. I'm glad I'm not the only one
[1:14:03] that's ever been accused of
[1:14:06] that. But sometimes if you've got a
[1:14:08] need, the best thing to do is just let
[1:14:10] it be known. The Bible says, "Confess
[1:14:12] your faults one to another." And and the
[1:14:15] prayer of faith shall save the sick,
[1:14:17] right? If he's done any sins, the Lord
[1:14:18] will forgive him. Confess your faults
[1:14:21] one another and pray one for another
[1:14:23] that you may be healed.
[1:14:25] They they accused him of not caring. He
[1:14:27] didn't answer them. I like that. He
[1:14:30] didn't answer his critics. But Joel, but
[1:14:32] what did he do? Amen. He rose up.
[1:14:38] I don't know how far, how long it took
[1:14:39] him to get from the back of the ship to
[1:14:41] the front of the ship. But we know he
[1:14:43] made the journey because he put his foot
[1:14:45] out on the front of the ship.
[1:14:48] He was in the back of the ship and he
[1:14:50] walked to the front of the ship. And the
[1:14:52] disciples are going,
[1:14:55] "Hurry, quick,
[1:14:57] please. Don't you?"
[1:14:59] He'll do it right on time.
[1:15:03] There's boards laying everywhere. The
[1:15:06] mast is broken into. The ship's taken on
[1:15:09] water. And Jesus is just taking a stroll
[1:15:12] from the front of the
[1:15:13] ship, back of the ship to the front of
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:17] ship. They said, "How could you be like
[1:15:20] this?
[1:15:22] Oh, if we could ever realize he's in
[1:15:24] control. If we could ever realize he's
[1:15:27] got it, maybe we'd recognize we don't
[1:15:30] have to be all in a hurry. Just let him
[1:15:32] take it. Let him do it. So, he's walking
[1:15:36] towards the front of the ship and he
[1:15:38] steps out and he rebuked the wind and
[1:15:42] said to the sea, "Peace be still."
[1:15:47] He didn't sit up there and say,
[1:15:50] "Now, wait, disciples, if you buy 40
[1:15:53] gallons of anointing
[1:15:55] oil, we'll get out there and you, Peter,
[1:15:58] I'll put you out on a stick and you can
[1:15:59] go out there and start anointing every
[1:16:01] wave and and then we'll we'll get a
[1:16:03] bunch of people together and we'll all
[1:16:04] pray and we'll all pray all night and
[1:16:06] night." There's a time for that. But
[1:16:08] listen to me, church. That's not him.
[1:16:10] That's just us trying to wake him up.
[1:16:12] Right.
[1:16:14] Right. Are you with me now? That they
[1:16:16] were desperate trying to wake him up as
[1:16:17] they should have been. But once he was
[1:16:21] awake, he didn't need a 7-day meeting or
[1:16:24] a 40-day fast.
[1:16:26] He just stood up. Yep. Said,
[1:16:30] "Peace." And every demon that swore to
[1:16:33] drowning said,
[1:17:18] looking forward and them 10,000 demons
[1:17:20] said it was going to be a bad day. Huh?
[1:17:23] We've been acting up, but we're fixing
[1:17:24] to have to be good like a bunch of
[1:17:26] toddlers in a
[1:17:28] daycare. I remember when I was in and
[1:17:31] I'm closing in just a moment. Forgive
[1:17:33] me. I remember when I just us here this
[1:17:36] morning, us local folks. So I feel like
[1:17:38] I can be myself. But I remember when I
[1:17:40] was in kindergarten and first grade,
[1:17:42] second grade and third grade, I used to
[1:17:43] go and we did tests at the school and
[1:17:46] there was a certain teacher at this
[1:17:47] Christian school, Mrs. Newman. And the
[1:17:49] other the other uh teachers would come
[1:17:51] in and the kids were just wild, just all
[1:17:55] over the place. My brother was the ring
[1:17:57] leader and they were all over the place.
[1:18:00] Of course, I was always good in the
[1:18:03] school, but Mrs.
[1:18:06] Newman. She was different from the other
[1:18:08] teachers
[1:18:10] cuz Mrs. Newman, I watched that woman
[1:18:12] one time. She called a deacon. There was
[1:18:15] a deacon in that Baptist church and she
[1:18:17] she called the deacon in and he had to
[1:18:18] whoop his kid in front of us. I'll never
[1:18:21] forget that. You couldn't have paid me
[1:18:23] to act
[1:18:25] up. Of course, he was embarrassed. So,
[1:18:27] he whooped him. I mean,
[1:18:30] he But everybody else walk in the room.
[1:18:32] all the other teachers could come in and
[1:18:34] it was kind of an open classroom where
[1:18:35] they had uh kindergarten and first grade
[1:18:36] in one room and then several other
[1:18:38] grades in the other room and and but
[1:18:40] when she walked in it was deathly quiet.
[1:18:43] She didn't have to say nothing. She
[1:18:45] didn't have to do nothing. She had
[1:18:47] complete control cuz they knew that when
[1:18:51] she said something she'd back it up.
[1:18:54] She wasn't going to say, "Well, when you
[1:18:56] you know if you act up, I'm going to get
[1:18:57] on to you. I'm going to get on." She
[1:18:58] didn't have to say it. They knew what
[1:19:00] would happen. And you know what? We
[1:19:03] loved her. I still to this day, I
[1:19:05] connected with her years later on
[1:19:06] Facebook and she's I don't know if she's
[1:19:08] passed away now, but she's very, very
[1:19:10] old and she's not. But she was a
[1:19:12] wonderful person. Eventually, the times
[1:19:14] got too much for her and they kicked her
[1:19:15] out of the school for being too
[1:19:18] disciplinarian. But she had she was the
[1:19:21] master of her environment. Listen to me,
[1:19:23] church. Jesus is the master of this
[1:19:25] environment.
[1:19:27] every devil, every little thing trying
[1:19:30] to make a mess out of the lives of these
[1:19:32] disciples and and try to kill him had to
[1:19:35] stop talking the minute that he spoke.
[1:19:40] You realize the power of the spoken word
[1:19:42] today when we speak the words that he
[1:19:44] already spoke. Listen, he rose and
[1:19:46] rebuked the wind, said to the sea,
[1:19:47] "Peace, be still." And the wind ceased.
[1:19:49] And there was a great
[1:19:52] calm, a noticeable calm, the same voice
[1:19:55] of the word that spoke through a
[1:19:58] prophet, excuse me, discern the thoughts
[1:20:01] and intents of the heart. Brother
[1:20:03] Brandham says this about it. Musicians,
[1:20:04] go ahead and come. He said, "Do you
[1:20:06] believe that that's the same thing?" He
[1:20:08] said that, "Do you believe that Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ's presence is here now? He's
[1:20:12] discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:20:14] the heart." What was that? Wasn't a man.
[1:20:16] That was that was God in a man. It was
[1:20:18] the voice of God the speaking. Now it
[1:20:21] wasn't brother Brandham said this it's
[1:20:22] my voice he said it's my vocal cords but
[1:20:24] it's him speaking. So the voice of God
[1:20:27] is not the literal voice of William
[1:20:28] Brandham but the voice of God did speak
[1:20:31] through William Brandham and he wants to
[1:20:32] speak through you. He wants to speak
[1:20:35] through me if we could surrender
[1:20:37] ourselves in that manner. But he
[1:20:39] surrendered himself in such a way he
[1:20:41] said the gift is to get William Brandham
[1:20:42] out of the way. And when he did, he
[1:20:44] discerned the thoughts of the heart. And
[1:20:46] he said, "Do you believe that that's the
[1:20:49] same thing?" He said, "Do you believe
[1:20:50] that Jesus Christ's presence is here
[1:20:52] now?" How many accepts that? I wonder if
[1:20:54] we can say that this morning. I wonder
[1:20:56] how many of us could enter in and say,
[1:20:57] "I believe that the same Jesus that was
[1:21:00] in that boat is right here with me
[1:21:02] today." Do you believe the word or not?
[1:21:04] The word says he's here with us. He's
[1:21:06] right in the boat with us. I believe
[1:21:08] he's right here with me. Do you believe
[1:21:11] that Jesus Christ presence is here? Now,
[1:21:13] how many accept? Oh, what a security. He
[1:21:16] said, see what what did you do? Oh, come
[1:21:19] on, church. We think, oh, oh, if we just
[1:21:21] could get in a meeting, if we could just
[1:21:22] get in this situation, what did you do?
[1:21:26] If you meant what you just said when you
[1:21:28] said, I believe that he's here today, he
[1:21:30] said you awakened him. You brought him
[1:21:34] on the scene.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah. Here he is on the scene. He
[1:21:40] said, "Now, don't make any difference
[1:21:41] what the boat is
[1:21:43] saying, what the
[1:21:45] boat, come on, church. What your mind is
[1:21:48] telling you, what the devil's telling
[1:21:49] you, what your own thoughts are telling
[1:21:51] you, he said don't make any difference
[1:21:52] what the boat is saying." Remember, he
[1:21:55] can say,
[1:21:56] "Peace, be
[1:21:58] still. Peace, be
[1:22:01] still." Are we facing storms? I know
[1:22:04] that we are. Many of us are on the Sea
[1:22:06] of Life. wake him
[1:22:08] up. He is the
[1:22:11] dynamics to the
[1:22:13] mechanics. Brother Brandham said the
[1:22:15] father was the dynamics. The son was the
[1:22:17] mechanics and the dynamics came the
[1:22:19] father and the son. He said I do
[1:22:21] nothing. Said my father moves and I'll
[1:22:24] move. Oh my. If we could just realize
[1:22:27] that the bride in this day is to do only
[1:22:28] his
[1:22:29] will. Oh church, that's what we're being
[1:22:32] called to. And I know we we think well
[1:22:34] that's going to be some great super
[1:22:35] thing. But maybe that's just living our
[1:22:37] everyday life and realizing he's in the
[1:22:39] boat. He's there. We don't have to
[1:22:42] panic.
[1:22:44] He's right there. Right. Right in the
[1:22:47] boat. If you believe that he's here,
[1:22:49] you've awakened
[1:22:50] him. Call him on the scene. May he may
[1:22:54] may take some time to get from the back
[1:22:56] of the boat to the front, but he'll
[1:22:57] arrive on time. You're going to be okay.
[1:23:00] Heavenly
[1:23:01] Father, Lord Jesus, I know there's many
[1:23:04] storms that we face and storms that
[1:23:07] we've seen in the natural this week.
[1:23:08] Lord, reminds us of the storms of life.
[1:23:11] I pray God that you'd you'd quiet every
[1:23:15] storm
[1:23:16] today, every storm of
[1:23:19] doubt. Lord, I I I myself I feel so
[1:23:25] helpless. Lord, I I see that ship and
[1:23:28] other little ships. You can imagine what
[1:23:29] the other little ships must have been
[1:23:32] going
[1:23:33] through. I think of myself, Lord, as a
[1:23:36] pastor and a
[1:23:37] preacher. And you think of trying to
[1:23:39] lead people in an age where the storms
[1:23:41] are
[1:23:41] everywhere. You don't want to lead
[1:23:43] people into a
[1:23:45] storm. Yet, we know that your ever
[1:23:47] present, your ever present help will
[1:23:50] always be with us. You'll never fail us.
[1:23:53] You said you'd be a very present help in
[1:23:55] time of trouble. Lord, I got to hold on
[1:23:58] to that today. I don't know what the
[1:24:00] future holds. I sometimes, Lord, you
[1:24:03] give us a little bit of insight and we
[1:24:06] see things coming and we wish we could
[1:24:09] stop it.
[1:24:10] Lord, see people, Lord, maybe just on
[1:24:14] the edge and
[1:24:17] unsettled, but Lord, I pray you'd help
[1:24:19] them today. Lord, I realize I can't
[1:24:22] change that, but you can. I pray God
[1:24:25] that you'd move in every life and every
[1:24:26] heart, every family. Help them to know
[1:24:29] that you're speaking.
[1:24:31] Lord, you you want to help. Lord, you're
[1:24:34] right there in the boat. But we got to
[1:24:37] have the faith to wake you up, Lord. I
[1:24:39] pray that we could call you on the scene
[1:24:41] this morning for whatever we have need
[1:24:43] of, Lord, to just reach out by faith.
[1:24:46] And by faith, we can say, "Lord, I
[1:24:48] believe that you're here. I'm going to
[1:24:50] worship you that way." Lord, it's why
[1:24:53] worship is so effective and let in in
[1:24:56] our bonds breaking and our our chains
[1:24:58] falling off, Lord, is because when we
[1:25:01] worship, we're acknowledging your
[1:25:03] presence, Lord. And by doing that, we
[1:25:05] wake you up, Lord, just by saying,
[1:25:08] "Master, he was awake and walking to
[1:25:12] take care of their situation." I pray
[1:25:14] you'd grant it, Lord. Help us, God. I
[1:25:16] pray that you'd move in a mighty way.
[1:25:18] Touch every heart. Touch every life. We
[1:25:20] pray as we worship you, Lord. May we
[1:25:22] worship you in spirit and in truth with
[1:25:24] everything that we have, Lord. I pray
[1:25:26] you'd protect those in our area. I I
[1:25:28] know there's still some, Lord, that are
[1:25:30] picking through piles of rubble and
[1:25:32] Lord, and trying to clean up after a
[1:25:35] mess. I pray, God, that you'd help them.
[1:25:37] Lord, if there's anything we can do, I
[1:25:39] pray we'd be willing to do it and to
[1:25:41] help. But Lord, I pray you'd be with our
[1:25:44] area. We know there's many of your
[1:25:45] people here, Lord. And I pray, God, that
[1:25:48] you'd bless them. you protect them. We
[1:25:50] thank you for your protection, Lord, for
[1:25:52] your hand on our lives has kept us this
[1:25:55] far. We thank you, Lord, these storms
[1:25:57] that come through and yet, Lord, we're
[1:25:59] here this morning. We're so thankful,
[1:26:02] God. We love you. We thank you, Lord.
[1:26:05] You'll protect us even in the storms of
[1:26:06] life, even in the storms of our mind,
[1:26:09] even in the storms of of trouble in the
[1:26:11] world. Lord, I know that you'll still
[1:26:14] protect us. We thank you for that in
[1:26:17] Jesus name.
[1:26:19] Amen. Thank you, Lord
[1:26:22] Jesus.
[1:26:24] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:26:26] Lord.
[1:26:28] Hallelujah. Oh, there is
[1:26:32] light where darkness used to
[1:26:36] be. Oh, now there is hope. Oh, I wonder
[1:26:40] if we can acknowledge his presence in
[1:26:42] the house. If you need prayer this
[1:26:44] morning, the altar is open. Praise his
[1:26:48] name. He's in the
[1:26:52] house. Oh, he's in the house in my boat.
[1:26:57] What the Thank you for being here with
[1:27:00] me, oh God. And now there is light. Oh,
[1:27:04] where the darkness used to
[1:27:08] be. Now there is hope.
[1:27:12] Oh, there's no more doubt. Oh, I want to
[1:27:16] say praise his name. Oh, he's in the
[1:27:21] house. Can we stand together and just
[1:27:23] worship him now? Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:27:26] The little girl was lying there. Oh,
[1:27:29] yes. People, hallelujah, were
[1:27:33] weeping. They just laughed at
[1:27:36] Jesus when he said, "He's only sleeping.
[1:27:41] Oh, as he took her by the
[1:27:45] hand, she began to live
[1:27:49] again. Oh, some begin to praise the
[1:27:53] Lord. Some begin to
[1:27:56] say, "Oh, thank you, Lord." Oh, yes, he
[1:28:02] is in the house. All dead. Death has to
[1:28:07] flee. You believe he's here this
[1:28:08] morning? Death has to flee. Doubt has to
[1:28:12] flee. Where the wor has to flee. Used to
[1:28:15] be. Oh, now there is hope. Oh, there's
[1:28:21] no more doubt. Oh,
[1:28:25] praise. His
[1:28:27] name. Oh, he's in the
[1:28:31] house. Oh,
[1:28:33] yes. I was like that little girl. Oh,
[1:28:37] thank you, Lord. in all my
[1:28:41] sins. And Jesus touched this heart of
[1:28:45] mine who gave me life
[1:28:49] again. I am just a house of clay. Oh
[1:28:53] yes. Ever since that blessed
[1:28:57] day. There's a light that shines in me
[1:29:02] for all the world to see. Oh, thank you
[1:29:05] for the miracle, Lord. Thank you for
[1:29:07] what you did in my life. Oh, Jesus in
[1:29:10] the house.
[1:29:13] Oh, I thank you for being with us, Lord.
[1:29:16] Thank you for loving us to come in our
[1:29:18] boat. Thank you for chartering our ship,
[1:29:20] Lord. Darkness used to be. Oh, now they
[1:29:28] all no more doubt or praise his name.
[1:29:36] Oh, he's in the house. Sing it again.

[1:29:42] house. Oh, death has to flee.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah. Oh, now there is light. Oh,

[1:30:37] one
[1:30:42] accord. Oh, sometimes hallelujah.
[1:30:51] Sometimes

[1:31:19] voicees up to the sky and start to

[1:32:20] Hallelujah. We want to
[1:32:22] praise the
[1:32:27] Lord and sometimes
[1:32:30] gently
[1:32:35] sing our hearts in
[1:32:38] one
[1:32:39] accord. Lord, can you give the Lord a
[1:32:42] hand clap of praise
[1:32:45] today? Amen. The winds of faith and give
[1:32:48] seal. Just sing this before we go. Amen.
[1:32:50] Aren't you glad he's in your boat today?
[1:32:53] Aren't you glad about it? Amen. If he's
[1:32:55] with us, then we don't have to fear
[1:32:57] anything. I mean, all fear is gone
[1:33:00] because we know who holds the future.
[1:33:02] Aren't you thankful? Can you give the
[1:33:03] Lord another hand of praise this
[1:33:04] morning?
[1:33:07] There are two
[1:33:11] roads you may
[1:33:15] take. One by
[1:33:19] sight and one by
[1:33:22] faith. Just take the word of God.
[1:33:28] For what you
[1:33:31] see, what you
[1:33:35] believe is what will
[1:33:38] be. So set your
[1:33:42] wings to the winds of
[1:33:47] faith and you can
[1:33:50] fly in a higher place.
[1:33:56] Oh, do not
[1:33:59] struggle. It's by
[1:34:03] grace. Set your
[1:34:06] wings to the winds of
[1:34:10] faith. Oh, watch your
[1:34:14] deeds and watch your cry.
[1:34:20] Watch your
[1:34:23] mountain to
[1:34:26] high. Just speak the word of
[1:34:30] God and by and
[1:34:33] by. Oh, it will
[1:34:38] move or you will
[1:34:42] fly. Just set your
[1:34:46] wings to the winds of
[1:34:50] faith and you can
[1:34:54] fly in a higher
[1:34:58] place. Oh, do not
[1:35:02] struggle. It's by
[1:35:06] grace. Set your
[1:35:09] wings to the wind. I like this last
[1:35:13] verse. Just watch the
[1:35:17] eagle up in the
[1:35:21] sky. He does not
[1:35:25] struggle. He does not
[1:35:29] strive. Oh, for the
[1:35:33] power that makes him rise.
[1:35:38] Oh, it's
[1:35:41] already in the
[1:35:45] skies. Just set your wings. Can we do
[1:35:49] that this morning? To the winds of
[1:35:53] faith and you can
[1:35:57] fly in a higher
[1:36:01] place. Oh, do not struggle.
[1:36:06] It's by
[1:36:09] grace set your
[1:36:13] wings to the winds of
[1:36:17] faith. Give him one more heck clap of
[1:36:19] praise if you
[1:36:21] would. Amen. Let's sing this just as we
[1:36:23] go. I would not be denied. Amen. God
[1:36:25] bless you for coming today. Did you
[1:36:27] enjoy the word of the Lord? And I
[1:36:29] believe it'll help
[1:36:32] you. When pains of death seized on my
[1:36:38] soul, unto the Lord I
[1:36:43] cried. Oh, till Jesus came and he made
[1:36:48] me whole. I would not be denied.
[1:36:55] Oh, I would not be
[1:36:59] denied. No, I would not be
[1:37:05] denied till Jesus came and he made me
[1:37:11] whole. I would not be denied.
[1:37:16] Well, as Jacob in the days of old, I
[1:37:23] wrestled with the
[1:37:27] Lord and said with a
[1:37:32] courageful I stood upon his holy
[1:37:37] word. Oh, I would not be denied.
[1:37:44] No, I would not be
[1:37:48] denied till Jesus came and he made me
[1:37:54] whole. I would not
[1:37:57] be. May you're free to go. God bless
[1:38:00] you. Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[1:38:06] would not hear my prayer.
[1:38:11] Oh, but praise the Lord. The work is
[1:38:16] done and Christ the Lord, he is
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:21] here. Well, I would not be
[1:38:26] denied. Oh, no. I would not be
[1:38:32] denied till Jesus came.
[1:38:39] I would not be denied.
[1:38:43] Well, oh Satan said my Lord was
