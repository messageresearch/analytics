pleasing to God Amen that he could come and and move Among Us and want to say just appreciate the church here the local assembly all the hospitality the the cooking and and uh the accommodations uh thank you so much uh uh you you just know how to make a guy uh uh feel welcome and uh not only that you know how to make a guy get a little bigger and uh that part ain't good but uh we we'll we always Monday morning we can go back on the diet right and so uh thank God for Mondays amen amen I like to say it's good to have my wife and my children thank you brother uh uh here with us and uh certainly love her and uh the children they've been just such a support amen throughout the years amen but if you'd like to stand to your feet and we will just uh uh Endeavor to read the word of the Lord and amen praise the Lord uh we'd like to go first of all to the Book of Joshua amen great praise the Lord praise the Lord the Book of Joshua and um we going to read the uh there at the 14th verse or chapter I should say and I forgot my reading glasses at home so you just bear with me and uh we'll try to you know getting older ain't fun and uh and uh you know my arms ain't that long I guess that's the bad part being short you know you got short arms and so uh anyways but uh uh Joshua the 14th chapter and we're going to start at the seventh verse uh says uh this is Caleb speaking here says 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me uh from Kadesh Baria to asy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I holy follow the Lord my God and Moses uh swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever okay because thou H has holy follow the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 4 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now uh uh lo I am this day uh Four score and five years old as yet I am strong this day as I was the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for both to war to go out and to come in Praise the Lord then the 12th verse here now therefore give me this mountain everyone say give me this mountain man give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the Anakin were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said then if you'll go with me uh 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter amen First Corinthians the 2 chapter amen so good to be a Christian in this age amen First Corinthians uh 2 and um 12 it says now we have receive not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know everybody say we might know know the things that are freely given to us of God Amen then one more scripture if you don't mind Romans the 10th chapter Romans chapter 10 and um the eth verse but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach amen could we just bow our hearts and heads to our Lord father it is certainly a good time to be in your presence Lord there's no other presence there's no other one that we would rather be with than you we thank you Lord for bringing us all together here today Father we know that you've got something in store you thank you for what you've done in the past two services and touching the hearts of your people now father I pray that you would help me just to get myself out of the way may you anoint the gift that you placed within me and may you now just speak through these mortal lips to your people and may the hearts and ears of your people be anointed to hear and receive of you we commit this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats if I uh would have a a uh title it would be uh possessing our inheritance by our words amen and um you know in in our scripture reading uh Caleb um is is ready to possess his inheritance been waiting a while now and now it's time and and he realizes that he knows it's time that uh to to take his inheritance and and uh uh to inherit something that's that's the an inheritance as you've inherited it and to inherit it uh something is to come into possession of or receive especially as a right or a Divine portion amen so the prophet would tell us that for you to have an inheritance then someone would have to leave you that inheritance you don't have to beg for it you don't have to work for it you don't it it was just someone uh left you an inheritance and so you are the beneficiary of of what has been given you and and so uh it's it's yours it it it's yours legally it's yours because they left it to you of Good Will and so if if I said this way if God has given you something then you can have it do you believe that amen if God has given it to you then then then you can have it it's yours and it's yours for an inheritance and so uh we we find that Caleb got this inheritance by the word of the Lord and this is what he's saying uh through to Joshua that that I Reed this inheritance by by the word of the Lord through the mouth of a prophet aren't you glad for a prophet amen uh uh a lot of folks it's it's it's I I think it it behooves us to understand why God would send us a prophet why the lamb would open the book and and what this was all about it's not just for us to to to be message people but it's an inheritance that was given to us amen and and and so uh this wasn't just a man uh that was saying Caleb you can have that Mountain no Caleb understood the position of a prophet he understood that it was the word of the Lord that was spoken through that prophet and he was staking his whole life upon that word give me my Mountain a ain't that right and and so now Caleb you know Caleb has been a the the subject uh uh uh for many years uh uh preached about maybe even sung about and and things like that and so I don't have any anything new to say today about Caleb but but I do want to talk about him and and uh uh and I guess the the the reason uh that that we talk about Caleb is is because uh any real True Believer of today and I and I say only today in this age can identify themselves with Caleb because Caleb is a type of the believer of this day that is following the end time message you believe that amen see so now you think of it and just come to me and and Caleb is not the type of any denomination he's not the type of a Pentecostal he's not the type of a Baptist Methodist 7th Day Adventist and and and and to be honest he did not type Luther's age he did not type Wesley's age and he did not type the Pentecostal age he is a type of you today amen that that's that's our type and so if you ever want to know what you are and who you are look at Caleb if you ever want to know what drives you to to want to get more of God and closer to God and and and can you really make it is it possible Amen to overcome things look at Caleb because Caleb represents the end time believer that is following the message of the hour do you believe that amen and so so no matter how old you are or how young you are Caleb is your type and and young people just to let you know that this message is for you just as well amen if it wasn't for you and then then Satan wouldn't be fighting you as hard as he's doing but because this message is for you then Satan is fighting you tooth and nail just as much as he's doing the preacher just as much as he's doing the parents and and and all of these things and and so then if he is our type then it lets us know where we are at as the bride of Christ it lets us truly understand our age in what we're living in now Caleb was a genuine believer and he shows it there at Kadesh Baria if if you remember uh when he resisted the LIE of the 10 spies and that's exactly what it was it was a lie they were not telling the truth to the people amen because God had said something different than what they were saying and so Caleb and Joshua with stood the lie and resisted that thing ain't that right you see remember before God would allow Israel to cross over into the the land of promise he brought them to Kadesh Bania and the prophet said he' done it to test them amen to test them and and he says well what kind of a test was it then he said it was a word test amen it wasn't a psychology test it it it wasn't a a a theology test it wasn't them sending them to a a school of Seminary and testing them based upon their IQ it was simply a word test God had given them a prophet God had showed them sign after sign after sign the pillar of fire was there among them God had proven he was with them and now it was time time to give them the word test can you say Amen yes sir see and so they they could not go over into the promised land until they were tested by the word now the prophet said God loves to put your faith to a test to see how you'll act upon it he'll let you be anointed and prayed for and then make you worse and say come on Satan give him to the test I know he believes me amen I know he believes me ain't that right and I want to just say this God ain't worried about you believing or not that that ain't the point he wants to let the devil know that no matter what comes your way no matter what Giant and what obstacle comes your way there's going to be a believer that will stand the test amen there's somebody that believes this message this message wasn't sent in vain this this message wasn't just given amen uh uh for for everybody to laugh at somebody and that's me amen how many calebs do we have tonight this morning amen there's a Caleb that's going to believe the message of the hour amen so he says see put him to the test now I know he took my word for it see he says God puts our test our faith to a test to see if we really believe that he is God can you say Amen so we we find that God as God brought Israel to a test well so has he brought the church amen to Kadesh Baria Amen in this time and and if you notice the prophet said now the test had to wait it could not come in Luther's age amen he says because they did not have the full gospel yet amen see it could not come in Wesley's time they didn't have the Full Gospel yet amen see so the test had to come in the age that that we're living in now this word Kadesh Baria is Judgment seat of the world and and uh uh Moses had had sent 12 Spies Amen to uh go across into the land of inheritance and when they came back then each one was required to give a report of what they saw what they heard amen what they thought about the land amen and they were to present it unto the people ain't that right amen and then the people had to make their choice amen as to what to believe see and so if you we remember that there's 10 spies that gave a negative report ain't that right they gave a negative report and they spoke contrary to the message of the hour and the negative is the only thing that they thought about amen they they could only see how small they were Amen in in in the land and they could only think about the negative they could only talk about the negative they they could only act upon the negative church we are not to be negative people and I understand it's we tend we can tend to be negative this is a negative age that we're living in amen there's more negative voices than they are positive that God would send us a prophit to get us away from the negative there's nothing negative in the in Christianity there's nothing negative in the message of the hour there's nothing negative can you say Amen see so we we find that that the negative was so overwhelming that they just couldn't get over it amen see they they they you well you know they saw the same things that Caleb and Joshua saw amen and And yet when they come back they they didn't even mention that they would just tell them we cannot make it amen they saw the Giants and they saw the wal cities and that's all they had in their report amen see and so their unbelief had blotted out all the promises of God to where they could only see the obstacles but if you notice Caleb and Joshua saw the same things amen that the 10 spies saw amen but their faith in God their faith in the word of God blotted out all the obstacles to where they could only see the promises of God can you say Amen yes sir well the 10 spies gave an evil report as as Paul would say and I'll say it this way any report that's negative is an evil report that's right see you see God said they could take the land but they said we couldn't take it ain't that right amen it's just the same way today amen see and then the people had to judge between man's word and God's word they had to judge between what a prophet was telling them and what man was telling them ain't that right I'll say this there ain't nothing wrong with this message we don't need another Messenger to rise up amen the message is not on trial it's our faith that is on trial Amen to where we will judge whether it's the message is right or whether man is right can you say amen that's right and that behooves all all of us now amen to that we have to make that decision amen now because the people were not really sold on the message of their day amen then they chose to listen to the 10 Spies of what they had to say amen and and uh uh uh the reason why the Paul said they had an evil heart of unbelief ain't that right and their hearts melted within the prophet said they refused to take take all of the word they refuse to take all of the word sure there might have been the evidence of the land but there was also this amen you see they should have blotted out every negative thought amen and just stayed with the word God knew that there were giants in the land he didn't have to tell them that there was Giants in the land he just told them you will overcome and I'm going to tell you this there there may be negative things in your life and and you say well God just doesn't know about them that's a lie God knows every ounce of you he knows every bit about you and yet he doesn't mention that to you he mentions the promises of the hour and he says you're more than able to take the land there's no weapon formed against you that is going to prosper it's amazing how we try to remind God of how unworthy we are and how bad we are and and what a skunk we are God already know knows all of that amen he knows that but he's not dwelling on that he's dwelling upon the promises your inheritance now Caleb you know you know they they Jesus said they're everyone dead they they disbelieved they made their choice and and they're everyone dead but Caleb had a different Spirit he stealed the people and he gave his report we are more than able to take the lamb God's word word is true everything that God said Is Right can you say amen and he had evidence to bring back he had the evidence ain't that right I I just a word to his preachers the prophet said we've got to minister the heat's on the day is hot let's Minister and fight the fight of Faith Can you say amen and stay in the battle for the people now you know I I just say this way you know uh every the ministers that uh brother Daryl and brother Andrew and and uh uh the the past few nights you know they they were standing laboring fighting for us for the people can you say Amen a lot of times we don't understand what ministers go through amen we we we don't understand that the trials that they they they have we don't understand the pastor and how he goes through so many things amen but yet he'll stand here amen not tell you about his problems not tell you about his defeats not tell you about his failures and he ain't trying to be a hypocrite about it he's standing here telling you the promises of God aren't you glad for men of God that'll stand and tell you the promises of God yes sir amen could be discouraged and everything else but it doesn't matter we staying with the promise of the hour sir now there will always be two reports that we will hear a report of Faith which comes from the word of God and a report of unbelief which comes from the devil ain't that right now Faith and unbelief amen they they they they uh are influences that come from an Unseen World amen and and so we a lot of times we think well it's just me that is is thinking them negative thoughts no it's coming from an Unseen World well it's just me getting all worked up no it's coming from an Unseen World amen see you know one time brother brandham drew a a line to make an example and so he drew this line and he says in that line in in that line are the Mortal beings all Mortal beings live within that line and he says and then outside that line is the Unseen and above that line is angels and they they they are from above and and angels of God and and then below that line are demonic spirits and and and uh these things and so he says within the line is a conglomeration of Blackness and gity and sin and divisiveness of the world and and all these things and and and so uh but he says then then every Mortal being uh uh in that line are influenced from the world above or the world underneath every one of us are influenced by one of these worlds ain't that right but we're influenced from above or from beneath see and and and so he says all those who live in darkness are influenced from beneath amen I want to say it this way don't let your life live in darkness don't let your mind live in darkness amen don't succumb to the darkness of the age that we're living in it's an in fluence that will overwhelm you ain't that right so he says but in every once in a while in this line of darkness and gy there and sin and filth and mck amen there's little lights amen little lights dots he said now that's the born again Christian that is influen from the world above oh my see now demons bring sickness upon people as we know they cause authoriz they cause heart disease they they cause uh cancer they they they cause uh oh well they just every disease you can name they cause it it's it's that comes from demons ain't that right they they cause people to become depressed and tormented in their mind and tormented in their body amen they cause up anxiety amen I've never seen so an age where there's so much anxiety that is in the world today can you say Amen it I I you know and even us preachers we get attacked with anxiety sometimes amen and young people getting attacked by anxiety well that ain't you that that ain't you that that's that's coming from something amen other than you that is trying to torment you ain't that right now so so they they also cause people to disbelieve the word of God brother brand said demon Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve God's word so these 10 spies they were anointed of demons of Satan to disbelieve God's word ain't that right amen see and and and so they they and and because the people listened to what them men had to say they themselves become Anointed with unbelief Amen to where they could not no longer see the the promises of God Amen see and so I I I say it this way be careful as to what you're listening to be careful as to what you're listening to there is no reason why we as message Believers should be confused as to what God Said can you say amen God has so Vindicated this message that every one of us should be at rest that this message is an absolute I know they say this message ain't the absolute this message is my absolute that's right you see the message of the hour was Caleb's absolute amen he was he you know he was 80 some years old and yet he took the mountain he possessed his inheritance by the word of a prophet because that word became his absolute he didn't care about his condition he didn't care how old he was he didn't care about the impossibility amen God had said I can possess list it this message is our absolute this ain't time to be confused this is time to be sold out this is the time to be convinced if God said it I can have it I ain't here to argue about it I ain't here to decide whether the prophet's right or you're right or this teacher right God said it I can have it you're going to find out that you can not possess your Mountain amen if you don't believe the word of a prophet how else are we going to do [Applause] it Church we're not Warriors we we're not equipped to meet the devil on our own in our flesh he whoops us all the time on our feelings he whips us all the time on our Sensations he whips us all the time on other things can you say the only way we can conquer this enemy is by thus sayth the Lord be careful that's what you're listening to now Faith cometh by hearing as we all know the word of God ain't that right and Paul would call it the word of faith amen the word of faith so Faith doesn't come that you can take that Bible and you get somebody that's Anointed with unbelief and take this very word and explain the promises of God to another age that ain't the word of faith that's an evil report the word of faith will take you right to the message of the age the word for this age and not leave one word out the word of faith will not consider your your problem the word of faith doesn't consider your situation the word of faith doesn't consider the impossibility the word of faith says you can go forward you can make it you can possess yes sir now if Faith come by the word of faith then we know that unbelief comes by words of unbelief the word of faith comes from one who is Anointed anointed can you say Amen their faith has been anointed amen think of it they could be facing the hardest times of their life and let their faith be anointed and it'll come forth the word of faith I can make it I will make make it I I I I can see the way out can you say Amen but when a man's begins to speak unbelief it shows that there's a he he has been anointed amen with unbelief can you say Amen you see there is an influence behind words that are spoken now the Bible says that Angels the angels are encamped around about those that fear the lord and amen they're there the prophet said they encourage us along the way aren't you glad for that they help us to believe they drive back demons from us do you believe that I believe the angels of God was here amen last night I believe they were here the the night before and they were they were driving Spirits away amen from our minds and encouraging our heart amen here was a man of God men of God preaching and I just believe just happened to believe that from the Unseen World there was an angel of God that was anointing their words to speak and the angels of God was Among Us and they were helping us to believe they were driving back amen everything to where we could receive the word there's there's angels that influence us they keep us from harm and from Evil do you believe that the b or the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always no guarantee about a Baptist message or Pentecostal message or any other message amen but the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always so stay with the message believe the message now brother Brown said that he goes a step further he said you got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointing is with you as it is with others can you say Amen yes sir now so Satan's job is to get you to disbelieve God's [Music] word that's right and if he succeeds then the word of God Becomes of no effect to you are you with me if he succeeds the word of God Becomes of no effect that was the point of the 10 spies amen they were anointed of the devil two and a half million of them amen was were people listen to the 10 spies instead of a Vindicated prop and when they chose to disbelieve God's word and believe a man the word become of no effect can you say amen that's right so brother Bram said we got to stop and separate don't don't be gullible don't just listen to anything that's been spoken don't just entertain any thought that just comes your way can you say Amen don't hang around just anybody as your friends if they're talking doubt stay away from them if they're speaking against this message stay away from them if they're trying to twist this message all up in your mind get away from it it's time for the word to have full effect in our [Applause] lives first John 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits try the spirits and see whether they're of God or not because many false prophets are gone out into the world can you say Amen well now Caleb are type he refused to listen to the rhetoric of them 10 spies he refused to listen to the unbelief Oh my he stayed with the prophet of the age he stayed with that Prophet amen he knew what was happening he knew what was all about can you say amen and guess what the word became effective to him the word was effective ain't that right now it was years later that he enters into the land of rest amen he enters under Joshua's Ministry into the land of promise now outside the land amen the the children of Israel were just pilgrims St uh strangers and sojourners they they they weren't possessing in anything outside the land because it wasn't theirs the land of Egypt wasn't theirs can you say Amen you know so it wasn't God's idea for them Moses to conquer Egypt amen and build hisself an Empire and call it the land of promise no God says I'm going to lead you out I'm going to lead you out this ain't your land let the Egyptians alone you come out now numbers 34 one God says unto Moses command the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land of Canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance not Egypt this land of Canaan is your inheritance even the land of Canaan with the coast thereof you see now on their Journey they left Egypt and they come into the land of Esau but you never did find them possessing that that was not their inheritance they were just passing through amen Deuteronomy 2 and4 and command thou the people saying you are to pass through the the coast of your brethren the children of Israel which dwell in SE and and they shall be afraid of you take ye good un yourselves therefore meddle not with them everybody say meddle not with him for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount seir unto Esau for a possession can I say it America's not your possession politics is not your possession Republican party is not your possession Democrat Party is not your possession there ain't no promises that they are offering us that they can give us that's not our possession we're not looking for America to prosper we're not looking for the world and and under under the government of man to prosper that's not our possession worldly things are not our possession materialistic things are not our possession sad to say people are getting so caught up in materialistic things they they they're they're they're leaving off the things that are important that's not your possession that's well they passed through the land of Moab but that wasn't their possession that wasn't their inheritance that God gave them so they could not settle down outside the land that God had given them Israel was not to fool around with Esau and Moab they were not to mess with him they were not to get entangled with him they were not to get involved with him can you say amen they were not to fuss with him they were just to pass through ain't that right now if you notice the church has passed through justification but they weren't to settle down in that land the church passed through sanctification that they weren't to settle down in that land ain't that right the church passed through the Pentecostal age baptism of the Holy Spirit but they were not to settle down in that land we had to keep moving now Luther thought he had arrived when he got to justification and when he failed to follow one he died Wesley thought he had arrived under justification Pentecostals thought they had arrived when they received the new birth can you say Amen but they did not receive the inheritance now this tells us that the new birth is not your adoption can you say that with me the new birth is not my adoption now people brother Brown said people think well praise the Lord I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that settles it that seals me into the kingdom I'm a son and a daughter of God that's true that that don't have nothing to do with your inheritance yet another place brother Bram says when the Pentecostal church and these people in the last days here that's beginning to find the new birth being born again they thought that settled it no sir you're ups and downs and ins and outs and things like that God can't place you as a son but when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay right there one of these days God will call you out set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that'll shake the nations with it amen see what I mean it's the adoption into the family brother brandom in his prayer said we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in not with a new birth for we receive that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then then she'll be clothed in the power of the resurrected Lord another place your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing ain't that right so then we find amen that the church had to pass through the land of justification they had to pass through the land of sanctification they had to pass through the land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to get where we are today hello if the Lutheran would have moved on they would have been westens if the westens would have moved on they would have been Pentecostals if the Pentecostals would have moved on they would have been us ain't that right so now where are we at then well you know we are fulfilling Ephesians 1: 15 having predestinated everybody say having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will you see this scripture was not speaking of Luther's day it wasn't speaking of of Methodist day it wasn't speaking of Pentecostal day of the age can you say Amen but it was speaking of sons of God in this last day that would come into their inheritance now notice brother Bram said in this age that we're now living this age it's beyond Pentecost see Pentecost has settled itself into organizations and started faking a whole lot about organizations can you say Amen so now I want to tell you where we're at we're not passing through the land again we're not just passing through a land we've arrived Caleb had come to the a place that he wasn't passing through people's land anymore he had crossed over into a land of inheritance and now he can say everything that the prophet gave me it's mine give me my Mountain we have entered the land a promise where the inheritance lays see because the inheritance lays in the land of promise and only everybody say only in the land of promise or in the land of inheritance did The Inheritance become a reality do you realize we are more closer than ever to a body [Music] change it's becoming such a reality to it Heaven is becoming more of a reality than this whole world right right our full Redemption is becoming more of a reality oh yeah than ever before can you say Amen Redemption everything that Christ had died for has become more of a reality to you and I in this age than it ever did in the days gone by thank you Lord now brother brandom said Israel shouted they danced sure they had a a great time but they found out they wandered for 40 years now and I wondering did you ever think what they did out there in the wilderness did you ever think of what Israel done God blessed them sure he did see they had Gardens their crops they married their wives and they raised their children God blessed them and he's blessed the Pentecostal move and sure but remember that wasn't what God send them out to to live in that Wilderness they was just to pass through the Wilderness they were on their road to the promised land can you say Amen so you never find Caleb trying to possess things what was not his to [Music] possess now when a man crosses over into that Promised Land his whole passion because we're looking at Caleb now his whole passion was to gain his inheritance that's right I want my inheritance on now I've kept quiet all this time I bore with everything but now I'm in the land and I want what God has promised me I want to ask you how many wants what God has promised I want what God has promised yes sir I'm not interested in what politics are doing I I ain't interested in what our government's doing I'm not interested in what Russia's doing I'm not interested in everything that's going on I just want my promise let them pick it Let them fight I just want a promise can you say Amen Let the churches do what they want to do I just want my promise that's where we're at in this age now if you look Matthew 6:19 Jesus says lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where and moth do the corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven your your inheritance is eternal things right Colossians 3:1 if you be R then be risen with Christ seek those thieves which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth ain't that right so a man that is in the land of inheritance seeks to possess his inheritance now we all we all know amen according to the message of the hour that the promised land is to adoption Sons adopted Sons adopted Sons become heir to the inheritance can you say Amen they so so this is a this is an adopted son what what what is it then what is that adopted son he's no longer a child right under tutors and governors but now he's raised up into a position of authority not not saying oh I just wished I could overcome I I I I I I got a desire to be this but I just don't know if I can no no no you've been given a position of power it's a position of authority no bargaining with the devil Satan give it up give me my land it's an inheritance hallelujah hallelujah did you know that Caleb he didn't go into that land wondering what belonged to him he didn't just go around the land and said man i' I'd like to have that piece of property and Ephraim says oh no you can't have that that's mine oh so he just wondering around no he knew exactly what belonged to him church I want to just ask you do you know what belongs to you well I'll just tell you it makes the the prophet made it easy everything that Christ died for belongs to you everything everything somebody say everything if you need Joy it's yours if you need peace it's yours if you need forgiveness it's yours if you need just a rapturing faith it's yours everything that Christ died for is yours yes sir it's yours see so now it was revealed to Caleb he knew what was given to him and notice he laid claim to [Music] it I don't know the simple but I hope it help you he laid claim he didn't sit there in the lawn chair drinking lemonade and Fanning himself or having somebody else to Fan him and said man I just don't know how I'm going to do this one maybe just maybe maybe we could deal with make a deal no he laid claim everybody say lay claim now now notice this word lay claim means to demand as being one's property to assert one's right or title to to say that you own it Church were in the age to lay claim it's mine what do you have need for doctor says you can't make it doctor says you'll always be sick do you have to accept that absolutely not you lay claim to what God has given you don't you let the devil talk you out of it can you say Amen now if you notice his his claim was a confession of faith on the prophet gave it to me God said I could have it so he had an authority behind his works it wasn't just something he thought of it wasn't just something he desired it was given to him under a Vindicated Prophet now he had the authority in his words to lay claim give me my mouth now we all know that it was a confession of faith and to confess is to say the same thing as say the same thing as I know it's been a attack you know or not attack but you know people think that we we we quote quotes too much I don't think you can quote them enough I don't think you can listen to the message enough hello it's your inheritance we let the devil talk to us we let him say things right here and we entertain it we let him talk and talk and talk and talk and talk why don't we let God have a voice let God have a say in the matter let God say about your situation don't let the devil say you're defeated what does God say about it you are an invincible Army how many believe you're Invincible you are an invincible Army we taken we're taking our inherit oh man could you imagine God bringing us into the promised land and then leaves us beggarly and weak No Authority behind our words no Authority behind our confession but every time every time you say I'm Healed every time you make a confession he's interceding for you the lamb is interceding for you every time you make that confession you got a you got all Heaven behind you that's what a prophet said all Heaven is behind you so Caleb was just confessing what the prophet said you said well that's getting a little absurd no the Bible says that the spirit and the bride say come the prophet said the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same [Applause] [Music] thing can you say amen I ain't saying what Trump says I ain't saying what Biden says I ain't saying what the evil thoughts that come into my mind I'm said exactly what a prophet said and nowhere did he say I'm defeated nowhere did he say that I have to give down to the devil but he did say I'm an overcomer he did say we are a super race a super [Applause] church and you say Amen see so the message of the hour is the absolute for every True Believer sir now if you allow me we can relate to Caleb desire to possess what was given to him because we've been given an inheritance as well God left us the prophet said our inheritance when was it left us God left it to us before the foundation of the world he left us an inheritance before the foundation of the world oh my amen so if you look at it and these are just what the Bible says and but Believers are ordained to eternal life amen so eternal life was given to you as an inheritance we have been predestinated called Justified glorified before the foundation of the world you know what that means well brother Bram goes into what justification means being justified as though you never did it in the first place walking in this life and never looked upon by God as a sinner again what an inheritance and he left this to you before the foundation of the world that you could have every right to lay claim to it lay claim to it young people lay claim to that hello according to the scriptures we are predestinated to the adoption of sons and our inheritance was predestinated to us and we were predestinated to obtain our inheritance now the Bible also says we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son It also says that an eternal city has been prepare for us hello it says that the changing of our body it's our inheritance from corruption to incorruption that belongs to us sons of God ruling and reigning is an inheritance you believe it than the Lord now the the promised land of the old test represented the holy spirit so now how do we know how do we know that we have this inheritance amen well Ephesians 1:13-14 just uh putting it together the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our inheritance in other words it's the down payment ain't that right how many's ever have made a down payment on something that you want you you want something and you say I'm going to come and get that but I to secure this I'm going to put a down payment on it right so the Holy Ghost becomes our a down payment of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession now I I looked up that word uh uh uh um this it's the down payment which means it's a pledge that the full amount will be paid so when God give you the Holy Ghost he put a down [Applause] payment he going to claim you and he secured your inheritance for [Applause] you can you say Amen yes sir so he confirmed to you that you have have an inheritance now brother Bram says the holy spirit is the assurance that we have been received into Christ or the land you know uh uh uh 2 Corinthians 1:20 it says all the promises of God in him are yay and amen in him are they yay and amen in other words they're sure they're established they're they're they're they're for certain and and so brother B said it is the best hope and insurance that we do have eternal life and are hires everybody say we're Heirs of everything that he purchased for us can you say Amen so now notice he says we have the earnest now of our complete inheritance aren't you glad for what Joy you got that's right aren't you glad for the experience that you have here yes that's only just a portion of what your inheritance is how many's ever been healed have you ever just been healed God healed you you you know what that is there's a body there there's something there's a place where you'll never have sickness that's to let you know that you've got an inheritance can you say Amen now notice we have the earnest now of our complete inheritance because God has already pulled loose the ground Roots uh from the things of the world and has planted us on Higher Ground lifted me uh out transcent me transformed me from the things of the world took out roots branches everything and lifted me up out of the my clay out of the old muck of sin and planted me up on top of Zion's Hill sitting in the orchard of the Beloved Saints of God and now we are citizens of that Kingdom Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus all filth and gum and and nastiness gone from our minds our bodies washed with pure water and our hearts are sprinkled by the blood of Jesus Christ the holy spirit is abiding with his Breeze blowing through our branches all day long shoving us and pushing us and making us take good roots and grow down deep that's that's the in Earnest of our inheritance and you say Amen now what is the Holy Ghost it's a down payment it's the earnest but it's a seal everybody say a Seal Seal it's also a finished work the guarantee is already there and he gave you the Holy Ghost as your guarantee that you can come into the land and rest no matter what's coming against you you can rest it's a security so you cannot be lost now we ought to be able to believe that I cannot be lost turn around tell someone I cannot be lost I've Got The Inheritance I've got the down payment can you say Amen cannot be lost God ain't going to save you today and lose you tomorrow he's not he's not going to wash your sins away today and then you're going to be blot have all this sin and gum and all that at the day of judgment he has so protected you that you'll never come to that judgment the Rapture well tribulation is coming the world is falling apart but you ain't falling apart you ain't in fear of of tribulation I've got a place I'm going there is an inheritance waiting on [Applause] me now the prophet said see a seal is a means that it is a finished thing with God it's finished it's settled and every believer was sealed with this promise from the very beginning because before the foundation of the world we were predestinated unto the adoption of sons you see God claimed you can can I ask a show of hands how many's got the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost you really believe that I got the Holy Ghost even if you don't feel like you got it and Satan telling you got it but you can you can say I know I've got to be on the sh it out I got it amen I got it aren't you glad you got it well what what what is that God secured you God claimed you can you say Amen now notice when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from Mortal to immortality God how how you know how how can people how could the giant how the 10 spies say there's just no way we're going to make it God already told him I'll send my angel before you I'll make the way he already told him that how can we as Holy Ghost filled Believers question whether we're going to make it God's already declared we're going to make it he's already made a way Satan can't touch you Satan can't defile you he can't put his Filthy Hands On You Anymore isn't that wonderful to know that we can we live with this assurance we're going in a Rapture world's going crazy but we're not and it does not depend on how we feel amen it doesn't matter how we feel it doesn't matter what the devil is saying to us we're secure we're claiming we're laying claim now Church you ain't going to go in the Rapture just being passive I hope you understand what I'm saying these preachers ain't just preaching the message being passive this is something we're Ling claim [Applause] to we're laying claim to this Rapture it's an inheritance we're laying claim to an eternal City I don't want nothing to do with this world I ain't got nothing I I ain't got no ties to this world if you can understand what I'm saying I ain't wrapping my soul up into this thing I'm laying claim to an inheritance that's the people we are in this age we are the rapturing people people Luther couldn't go in a Rapture none of the ages could go we're that rapturing people I believe there's people living in the Earth today that will never taste death yes sir that's how close we are to this thing and we ain't got time to dilly dally around with the things of the world Jesus said when you see these things come to pass lift up your head you come it's time for inheritance Glory yes so he says see this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential of the earnest of you being quickened from the Mortal to immortality let me say that again when this Spirit has found you the individual has and has come upon you it is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential can you say Amen Lord so what is the Holy Ghost for us today it's the quickening power come on it's not just a seal it's it's it's a quickening it's it's Dynamics the word everybody say the word word has been quickened yes sir the full word has been quickened we talk about the lamb opening the book it's no longer a closed book it's an open book sir and when John saw the book open he got excited and a prophet told us why he got excited he saw his name in the [Applause] book in this age in this time he saw everything that belonged to him ain't that right and it become a quickening quick the earnest of your inheritance now brother BR said we have the evidence that God Lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God has not forsaken us and that we are his and that he is ours and we have the Holy Spirit within us crying ABA father can you say amen and there's nothing that can ever take us away from that the trees don't have it nature doesn't have it the flowers doesn't have it can you say amen he said all nature doesn't have it but we have the earnest of our [Music] inheritance then he says we're groaning everybody say we're groaning we're groaning with them because we have not received the fullness of our adoption hello brother brah says this he says now when a man receives the spirit his time of groaning is over because it is a finished work and how true that is how many believes that time of groaning in other words you're not groaning to be a Christian you're you're you're you're you're not groaning to to to be reconciled with God that that you're you're a Believer you're a Christian that'll never change you're sealed somebody believes that EV going to whip us up and down up and down your feelings your your everything may go up and down but there's something concrete I know who I am but then we're groaning we're groaning for a city we're looking can you say amen I I ain't satisfied in this world in my body I'm groaning for a body that will never suffer again I'm groaning to be clothed with with immortality where I'll never have mind battles again to where I'll never have to deal with this enemy again to where I'll never never have to have depression again to where I'll never have to have anxiety again oh no sir I'm groaning how many's groaning why there is something within you that speaking of a new world there's something within you that's causing you to Gran for it can you say Amen see we're not wondering if we have an inheritance we know we have the inheritance we're not depending upon some politician to give it to us we're not depending upon some Pope to give it to us can you say amen God has given it to us by his word now we have that eternal security see we're in that land of adoption now notice brother brah says now we have the earnest our spirit's groaning for the full adoption that's right so now we have the earnest of it as we receive the spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation he said I just love that we're waiting for the fullness of adoption and this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body we'll have a body he said for we shall seek him him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more aren't you glad for that I thank God for salvation I think God that there's more to this [Applause] salvation church I'm glad for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but there's more to it he said this is the ending up of the time time will be no more one of these days we come up you know of out of Eternity stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time back into eternity we was before there was a world then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now and in year we have our we've had our savior come here to Earth God give himself made himself manifested to us give us the hope of everlasting life eternal life and also in there he promis promised us joy happiness contentment which is the earnest our of our Salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance now says the little touch that we have you said when I walk up there to that screen a while ago and they were screaming and praising God and the Holy Spirit falling and tears rolling down cheeks when he was seeing Oh hell the power of jesus' name when I stood this morning and heard that little duet this morning sing that beautiful hymn I suppose they sung it he says see and the Christians there them old veterans that was beating in war beating in war and the tears rolling down their cheeks what was it it was the earnest of their salvation aren't you glad we can enjoy it here but there's more to come can you say Amen oh do you love him as we get ready to close amen thinking of the Holy Ghost brother BR talked about it being the token life for this age which is the quickening power of God it is quickening us our mortal bodies to the word of God do you believe that amen no longer are we sitting back and say man I wish I could be that I wish I could have that no it is a quickening power to Quicken that word to us what is it it's the word of God which is Jesus Christ being impersonated in his church can you say Amen son of man revealed sir now the 10 spies they saw the evidence of the land can you say Amen but they didn't come into its fullness they partook of a little of it but they didn't come into its fullness can you say amen that's right now you know I I was thinking of this brother Bram said each ages had a dip of the Holy Spirit but they didn't go into it all the way they had a dip Luther had a dip Wesley had a dip Pentecost had a dip but they didn't go into it all the way ain't that right justification he said made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down into Perfection back to the word again being made manifest manifesting itself aren't you glad for that the word now taking on flesh we now becoming the promises we now whatever God promised we are now taking a hold of it oh yes yes yes yes oh do you love him amen amen amen so this is the day this is the day everybody say this is today that the word is to come into full effect when Jesus walked the Earth amen the word had come into full effect they were singing about Messiah they talked about Messiah he was Messiah everything that they' wrote about talked about sung about lived for there he was the word had come in full effect the word couldn't come in full effect in the church until this age can you say amen that's exactly right amen and when the word did come into full effect every scripture pertaining to the Messiah was fulfilled and I got good news for you today every scripture pertaining to this bride it's time for it to be fulfilled don't sit back and look at it and wish and hope and want step into it and lay claim lay claim Caleb can you say amen that's right see now you know Allelujah Jesus being the full word he said search the scriptures and in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me but yet the people turned it down ain't that right now notice the church the prophet said was to go on to the full promise see it should be in her Splendor of Glory she should be waiting for the coming of the Lord but Luther didn't go all the way Wesley didn't go all the way Pentecostal didn't go all the way can you say amen he said and instead of that she scattered everywhere wondering which is right is this right is this right well I'll go join this and I'll go join that that's what that's the confusion of all this but this little bride is not confused we're not wandering around no more we are believers in what a prophet said and we have moved on beyond all of that all the doubt all the skepticism all these things and unbelief and have moved on into the promise for this age how many believes that yes sir do you love him amen so by the message of the hour we have crossed over into our land of promise on how many believes we're in the land of our inheritance see we are experiencing the second part of redemption and Redemption what is it the first part is going out coming out and going into ain't that right the Lord showed brother brandham that his ministry was the Joshua Ministry it typed out the ministry of Joshua ain't that right yes sir in the message you know Paradox brother brandham spoke of the vision that he had of him standing on the mount on a map of Palestine said he was coming down to the Jordan River said as he was going you know got there he turned around to look where he come from he said I've come 2third of the way come that first and second pull there he was and he looked across Jordan and he says over there is where all the promises lay in that third pull the opening of the word is where all the promises lay that's where the power of God Lays can you say amen and he moved us in to that third pool first pull had nothing to do with us second pool had nothing to do with us that was for brother Brown's Ministry to call us but that third pull is for this bride it wasn't just for brother brandom it was for this bride we we ain't claiming our promises by by intellect we're not claiming our land through guns and weapons and through politicians we've been given thus sayth the Lord can you say Amen yes sir amen so we find that brother bram's Ministry was to take us over into that land and place Us in the land not bring us through another age another land but to place Us in that land can you say Amen this message revealed what belongs to us how many believes that it is positionally placing Us in the land now if you notice in the land is where the enemy becomes a real reality not only did the promises become a reality but the enemy become reality and it's in this age we are fighting the most hardest evil demonic age ever Prophet said demons are pouring in from everywhere why it's your time to possess it's your time to possess yes that's right young people are being attacked like never before we're experiencing things like never before mind battles and depression and and just one you get out of one trial you go to another sometimes you just seem like you're even fighting five trials at the same time that's the place we're in can you say amen and what's Satan trying to do keep you from your inheritance trying to keep you from your inheritance trying to get you to doubt trying to get you to walk back now notice brother brah said when you say you're going to do anything going to accept your healing or going to accept your baptism of the Holy Ghost that's when the devil flies on you with all four feet it doesn't mean that God is against you it means you're actually doing something right [Applause] can you say Amen you're near the promise you're near to the answer that you've been looking for and Satan is guarding that trying to get everything he can to keep you away from it but you keep laying caim Caleb it's time for it in this age he'll tell you you're not going to make it in a Rapture I don't I I I'll just say you know just me I don't think there's ever time in this in any other age that there's a people that's really had a hard time with wondering if they're going to make it there's probably never been another time except this age when people have really fought whether theyve crossed the line or not think about it yeah it's this is the age I don't think there's any other age that people have had to fight anxiety and despair and just want to give up in the age that we're living in because we're so close so close to everything that God has promised us you're the one that's got to take it you and I are the one that's got to lay claim to it give me my Mountain I don't have to beg for it it's my right it's the age I've been born for such a time as this I'm not passing through I'm not giving the torch to another generation it's my promise it's my inheritance I will make it in this Rapture the Millennium is mine Heaven is mine that Eternal City is mine and I'm laying claim to it and Heaven is behind your words can you say Amen yes sir see brother R said we're longing for somewhere where there's no death come on how many's longing for that no Sor no heartaches no old age the land is somewhere and we'll never be able to achieve it by gun and fighting and so forth of the natural carnal weapon but there is a land that we can go to and it's a battle to get there it's a battle to get [Applause] there that's where the Giants become real was in the land when Caleb got to that land to claim his Mountain there's no doubt there was Giants and he had to keep looking up at them oh and no doubt let's just put it in our terminology in our way today no doubt them the words of them 10 men kept ringing in his ears we can't make it we can't make it we're as grasshoppers don't you think that Caleb felt that too but he would not give in that he had a mountain to claim he had a we to act upon that word became his absolute oh church and the mountain may be there and and the Giants maybe just seem overwhelming but you can make it the prophet said you will God said you will do you love him can you lift your hands unto the Lord hallelujah hallelujah brother R said keep walking keep pressing on every time you make a step into the kingdom of God that's yours all things are possible that's given and all things are given that's possible but it's a battle we're laying claim to Healing we're laying claim to full Redemption full adoption we're laying claim to the Salvation of our loved ones how got children that need saved hallelujah we're laying claim to that Hallelujah I don't care how way where they are the prophet said no matter how way where they are you realize what he's saying to you no matter how bad it looks no matter how lost it seem they are you've got a right to lay claim that's your inheritance you're in the land you're in that land of inheritance hallelujah we're laying claim to Total Deliverance the devil may be telling you oh you've always had them habits you've always had that oh don't you listen to that that may be a giant that you're looking at but there is an inheritance that you can have they claim to it thank you Lord laying claim to these things and by faith everybody say by faith we lay claim to it if the musicians will come Hallelujah you see Israel Israel could not enter into the promised land because of their unbelief do you understand what that means if they would have went into that land with their unbelief they would have become slaves to the Giants there would have been nothing in them to overcome them you had been too overwhelming because that's what unbelief does it magnifies everything it magnifies the impossibilities it magnifies the negative it magnifies it all because it's coming from the devil can you say Amen so God wouldn't let them come into that land amen those that were listening to all of that and would disregard his word amen see God never required them to overcome the enemy on their own they were to overcome them by faith in the word can you say amen amen I want to say this there is absolutely no way to overcome with unbelief there's absolutely no way to overcome by unbelief right leave unbelief behind can you say Amen unbelief what does it do it empowers the devil in your life it opens the door opportunity for the devil to come in and the more you listen to unbelief the more the devil can talk and the more you allow him to talk the more he gains power and the more he gains power the more in bondage you become that God never called you to come into that land sure sure sure you're going to have obstacles sure you're going to have Giants sure you're going to have failures sure you're going to meet the enemy but you are more than conquerors greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world if you fall get back up again dust your Brites off and keep fighting young people keep fighting God's got an inheritance for you too can you say amen hallelujah I don't know what song done [Music] hallelujah it's already praise the Lord the Battle Victory is well do you believe that sing it again yes [Music] hallelujah it's [Music] [Applause] praise the Battle Is Over the victory is [Applause] it's I have over [Music] come oh I Hallelujah I am [Applause] [Music] pra the Battle Is Over the victory is I have overcome now notice what a prophet said he said the moment you say you're not saved that's when you're not saved when you say I'm not healed that's the moment you're not healed you see words mean things don't let the devil influence your words let it be the message of the hour that you speak I am here I am saved I know I'm going to make it do you feel like it no but I'm going to make it do you feel like you're Victorious no but I am victorious and you say Amen why the word says it and if God said it I just happen to believe it we're going to possess our Mountain can you say amen glory to God glory to God you know that song you you don't have to worry you don't you don't have to worry Don't You Be Afraid Joy the morning TR [Music]
