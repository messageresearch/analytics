Lord God bless you so good to be in the house of the Lord Lord to know that he is God Amen and if he he is then everything is possible go to Colossians chapter 1 verse 18 Colossians chapter 1 verse 18 numbers 13 and 30 read just both those verses I didn't hear if we had given a request for it but brother Joe sender's sister-in-law passed away when be praying for that family spoke with him today and and uh or texted with him today and he said that they' been married 53 years and that's a long time and she died suddenly so I think they'll be traveling or he'll be traveling up there so to Illinois to be with them and the funeral and we want to pray for that family that's uh you know all of us have a time we have to go but that's such a surprise to them we need to remember them especially and our prayers Colossians chap 1: 18 and he he is the head of the body the church is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and then numbers 13:30 numbers 13:30 excuse me tonight the devil fights me on Wednesday night must be because the Lord has something good for us us numbers 13:30 and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once look how different his testimony was from theirs all the the other spies said we can't take it at all and he said let's not even wait let's just go up let's go up at once and possess it we are well able to overcome it I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated tonight most of the founders of today's denominations didn't intend for their movements to become denominations at all uh John Wesley talked about a dream that he had and in the dream he was ushered to the gates of hell and and he asked them there he said are there any Presbyterians here and they said yes he said are there any Baptists any episcopalians any methodists yes every time he brought up a denomination they said yes and then he was distressed and and then he was ushered to the Gates of Heaven and he asked the same question the answer was no he said are there any Baptists here no are there any episcopalians no the answer came back there's only Christians here so Wesley didn't want his movement to become a denomination but it did Martin Luther didn't want his movement to become a denomination the move of God that happened under justification ation he he said this he said I pray you leave my name alone do not call yourself lutherans but Christians but they didn't do it John Wesley said I wish the name Methodist might never be mentioned again lost in Eternal Oblivion Charles Spurgeon said I I say of the Baptist name let it perish let Christ's own name last forever he said I look forward with pleasure to the day when there will not be a Baptist living that's pretty strong but they didn't want a denomination and yet we have thousands of denominations today we have independent churches that have a a denominational identity each one claiming to be true and to have the truth and and we know that having a true founder is not enough to make you a true religion or a true church because you could have a true founder the Catholics had a true founder they say they were founded by Peter and yet you look at them today and what they are and so having a true founder doesn't mean you're the true church what is the church the church is the one established by Christ on the rock of revelation of who he is when he told Peter Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church he said this is how you're going to be able to discern what the true church is is by the Revelation now I want to tell you this is important this revelation of who Christ is is important Christ is the mystery of God God revealed and then we could say the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed right because that's we are his uh the revelation of who he is and so this revelation of who he is is what identifies who the true church is and I'm glad to be identified in that number but we know that that Revelation doesn't come to a group right it come it don't come to a church it don't didn't come to Word of Life Tabernacle but it come to individuals he said he told Peter who do you say that I am who do you say not what does everybody say who do you say and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now and so we have a revelation that he is the word he is the word and he is the head of the church he has the preeminence in the church and therefore he has preeminence in our lives because we as individuals are the church and we are born again by revelation of who he is and and who he is in us and so any other thought outside of his word is a challenge to his authority right you can't go making your own laws right I I've seen videos of these people that claim to be Sovereign citizens I forgive me if any of you do this I I apologize right now but but I've seen these people come be Sovereign citizens you know and the cops will pull them over and and and they'll begin to argue with the policeman and said I don't have to have a driver's license I don't have to have this side of the other and and they all end up in jail I mean they every one of them end up having to do what they're what they do why because the authority is the American government for good or bad that's what it is and the authority in the true church is the word and no matter how much we think or what we think about something listen church we could have the best idea in the world but if it's not according to the word it's not true and so we've got to stay with the word that's who identifies it is not our emot that identifies us as the church it's not what we what we say about ourselves that identifies as the church but it's the word that we adhere to that what will identify the bride is she'll be a word bride and she won't just talk about the word but she'll manifest the word she'll produce the word in her life what the word says about her is what she'll be I'm so glad we can be that tonight amen and so the word is our Authority it's our protection it's our Fortress we can hide behind and we can always remember that you might get you you might feel like you you haven't felt God in a long time you might get to the place where you feel like that everything's gone against you and you feel like circumstances have brought you down but you can always trust the word the word is still going to be there no matter how you feel no matter what's happening in your life no matter what's going on around you or in your family God's word is still true he said I loved you before the foundation of the Earth that's his word you you grab a hold of that and believe it and so we don't want denomination because denomination takes away or adds to the word and the word is no longer pure and no longer effective right but and and I'll say this and I don't want to get into Sunday uh morning but we you know you can only manifest what you believe you got to believe in something you can only believe what you have a revelation of faith is a revelation right and so you got to have revelation of something you got to believe something is true and and in order to believe that it takes a revelation from God and so we believe that the message of the hour points us to the word which is Christ and that Christ being the word that we are we see the word revealed to us and we know that that word is true and it identifies who we are and what we're to be doing as a church in this hour is everybody clear on that tonight he is the word and he has the preeminence now brother Brandon says his church is himself revealed I love that he said do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is God oh my so we actually are God's proof on the Earth today that he's God is your life and you say well you know I'm not proven that very well brother Ben I can't even don't have a dollar to my name I I I don't I don't do very much for God but yet the very fact that you go through the trials that you go through and you come out on the other side is proof that he's God the fact that you well you get sick sure but you get healed as well and it's proof that he's God and even down on your deathbed you don't give up who you are and what you believe why it proves he's God one day it'll be the final proof will be the Rapture and the resurrection that's the final showdown you ever wanted to have the last word well you will one day we're going to have the last word brother Joe and we've been promised that it's a final showdown there will come a time the devil can talk all he wants to but there's coming a time we're going to have the last word and the last word will be the voice of the Bride As She raises from this world as her body has changed amen talk about the final voice to the final age we will have the last word now but it's Church is himself revealed brother brandham starts with the as we go into this again into Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandham he makes the statement he said how can you say father Son and Holy Ghost then and be baptized in it if his word is himself revealed he said how can you be baptized in titles right the very word is Christ revealed he said how can you say you know Jesus Christ he is the word when there's not a scripture in the Bible there's not a place where anybody was ever baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost we know that uh Paul in when he talks in Acts chapter 17 verse 29 he's he's uh given his address I believe it's on Mars Hill and when he gives this address he to the people he talks to the people there he tells them these idolatrous he says for as much then as we're The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the God has a godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone Graven by Art in man's device in other words the godhead is not a theory right right the Trinity is a theory right but the godhead is not a theory he said the godhead is not something you made up it's not it's not what you tried to figure out the godhead is a person God was manifested in Jesus Christ right but the godheads not a theory and he said at the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent bom talked about how through the denominational ages winked at that uh that baptism entitles but now he calls for every man to repent and and Paul says because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained what will be judged by by the word right that's who he is by that man by Christ by the word whom Heath ordained whereof Heath given Assurance unto all men and that Heath raised him from the dead brother B said he goes on he doesn't Reserve his criticism only for trinitarians but he said you Jesus only people just using the name Jesus for baptism he said I'm personally acquinted with four or five jesuses myself he said so you see what your denominations lead you into that's the darkness the expression of Cain who brought fruits in the state of blood and you know I would be tempted to say well it doesn't really matter right Jesus Jesus Christ but brother B said it did right because baptism is what gets you started that's your very found found ation of faith and it's got to be in the name of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus Christ why because uh it is what it's what baptized you into uh it's it's it's your public Testament that you're baptized into him you have become part of that word now uh when in Peter on the day of Pentecost of course he said baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul with the Philippian Jailer in Acts 16 he brought the Mountain said s what must I do to be saved and they said believe on what on the Lord Jesus Christ they told him who they were talking about not just Jesus but the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved in thy house Bram taught us that either Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus Christ was appropriate because he he said he used Lord because he is our Lord that's just saying who he is listen his blood was God's Blood Brother BR said the Revelation come through the blood see through Jesus Christ who is the blood of God created blood in the womb of Mary where does he get that from and I know there's people in the message who'll fight you on that because they believe that uh Jesus was not really God but yet we know we know that his blood was God's blood and he took that from the scripture where Paul is warning the the people the ministry there in Acts 20 he said take heed to yourselves to the flock over which the Holy Ghost have made you overseers to the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood listen what did he purchase it with his own blood who did God did right so it's the blood of God now brother Bon said Paul knew him by Revelation he said that's how we know him today it's only the only way we could know him not say I'm Methodist that means nothing I'm Baptist that means nothing I'm Catholic that means nothing I go to Word of Life Tabernacle doesn't mean anything it it'll identify where you go to church but that's about it right the Devil comes here too right and that that's just he's just a spirit but he comes he attends every message church right to try to try to disrupt and do those things but but that's not I go to brother so and so church that's not enough but by the Revelation that God has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses hisself through you oh that's good sir he said churches has long forgotten that great Revelation they've forgotten it now he said when Luther raised up he was a great man he had the Revelation that day what happened a bunch of Ricky got in flat top haircuts as we call it today Rett is all of them they got around there and the first thing you know it's there now we we don't think much about flat top haircuts today because that's kind of a thing of the past but brother random had a real problem with it and the reason he did is because it was the culture of that age the brandom had a huge problem with the names Ricky and Elvis a huge problem with it and and there's a reason why and you can find many more quotes like this but I'll I'll pull this one in the brand said that expression this is again from chrisis the mystery he said if you only knew the numerology of the Bible and know what Elvis or Ricky means to the scripture he said just like why did Jesus you say there's nothing to your name there isn't that name could only come in this last days for this last day's people brother B doesn't just say that in one place he says that over and over and over again and and I think it's important that we understand why because Ricky Nelson how many know who Ricky Nelson is all old people sorry I didn't mean to call you old my mom raised her hand sister Luella in different ones some of y'all knew who Ricky Nelson is and because y'all were young real young when Ricky Nelson was around but Ricky I had to look him up cuz I didn't know who Ricky Nelson was and brother random will use Ricky Nel Nelson and Elvis Presley together and then he'll use one other person you may know who it is Pat Boon that's right so Ricky Nelson Elvis Presley and Pat Boon I never knew why used Pat Boon brother I heard brother uh brother Bisal say one time he was listening to the uh to the radio when uh Elvis died and it was Pat Boon's voice on the radio come across the radio and said the king is dead and so he began to recognize that they were all together because he didn't understand cuz Pat Boon seemed like a cleancut kind of guy compared to them other guys but Ricky and Elvis were the trendsetters they were the very first of that rock and roll generation and brother brandom saw something in that he he saw something starting would corrupt The American Nation to what it is today brother Brandon in another place he said we find out that they set the pace that's right they set the pace he said did you ever notice our young boys has become Ricky and Elvis He said you got a child name that change it name that change it right quick call him number one or two or something you say what difference does the name mean he said well I sure it means something your name characterizes your life he said now brother BR you're on numerology no I'm not I'm on thus sayith the Lord because why he has scripture Abram was changed to Abraham Sarah to Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter Saul to Paul numerous numerous uh instances where God personally changes the name of an individual from something that was uh was not what they should be to what he wanted them to be and so brother brand says Ricky and Elvis and such names as that he said is the modern American name which throws a child automatically right into that what is it it's it's today we have different Heroes right we need to watch what we name our kids still we we wouldn't name our kids Ricky or Elvis but maybe some other hero that we have out there somewhere but it throws them under that influence right of that because those were the trends Setters of that day we need to be careful we need to make sure that our children are raised right now brother brandom identifies something in that they were saids they started something he said you say there's nothing to it he said why did Jesus Chang Abram's name to Abraham and then Sarah to Sarah why did he change Saul to Paul why did he change Simon to Peter and so forth you see certainly it means something he said that name could not be spoken till this day that's astounding isn't it he said that's the reason we got this hellish thing we got in the Earth today because of such things brother BR seeing something that we weren't seeing as a prophet now let me let me say this you got to believe something I'd rather believe the words of a prophet and I'll say this if brother bam sees something in that I don't see I'm I'm going to listen to it right but I do see that it was a trend setting and there was something that started there and that's what he was concerned with now he said that's the reason we got this hellish sh we got the Earth today because of such things he said the whole human race is corrupted it's gone he said and that's why it is he said notice now he was all right he was in his days Luther and he had the Revelation but as soon as he left look what they did as they had a message look what it did he said the old early Pentecostal had a message look what they did they got a bunch of men together just exactly the same thing and brother brand types begins to type the denomination to Israel and and this is where I want to go tonight he talked about him choosing law over Grace how many have heard brother Bram sermon the church choosing law for Grace many of you have heard that the church it's a good one to listen to the church choosing law for Grace he said they actually chose to have a denomination instead of relying upon the grace of God and following the pillar of fire they chose law in other words he was saying Israel didn't have to have the law that they did but they chose that so he said God by Grace sent Israel a pillar of fire a prophet a sacrifice and showed himself among them brought them out of Egypt across the red SE seas and they wanted a law so they could have great dignitaries now what was their motivation they wanted a hierarchy they could have something to do into it and what did they do they was left in the wilderness for 40 years to wander and not one of that organization ever went over he said Caleb and Joshua the only two that stood out and said we're able to take it I love the way he puts this to look at the word of God don't let anybody tell you that you can't look at the word of God we're able to take it to we're able to look at the word of God in fact the book's been open in our day we're able to there's nothing in this message we should be afraid of we shouldn't be afraid to preach it we shouldn't be afraid to believe it we shouldn't be afraid to manifest it right because it's the light of the hour so he said we're able to take it every one of them died in the wilderness and Jesus said they were eternally gone after he showed his blessings and Power in their ages like Luther Wesley and so forth did he he said our fathers eat man in the Wilderness he said and they're everyone dead he said that's eternally separated from God the carcasses perished in the wilderness they're dead he said but I'm the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven they couldn't see it they just couldn't see it he said the church has long forgotten it they accepted intellectual message intellectuals membership knowledge instead of the revelation of the truth of the word he said now look here now he's going to give an example of that they say today do you believe that God commissioned us to go into all the world and heal the sick and preached the gospel and cast out Devils oh yes I suppose that's right but he said you see he said a lady talking to me the other day she said well all the churches are in harmony I said there isn't one of them in harmony with the other there's Catholics standing there and said how about you you're a Methodist that's a Catholic are you are you in harmony with one another I said this Pope come to unite them together that's a good thing for all that kind of people but the Church of God has nothing to do with it not the thing it's out from the whole bunch he said you want to unite that together One Believes In something the other Methodist take sprinkling the Baptist take immersion and both of them denying the Holy Ghost in his fullness of the power they said we received the Holy Ghost when we believe the Bible said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed he said there's the difference now what is that what's he showing us whatever the word says is right why because the word has the preeminence and and we kind of lose sight of this stuff and we think well it really doesn't matter but isn't that the work of the enemy in our day to tell us that well it really doesn't matter it does matter so he said they said we're the Catholic church and we started early we did this the Methodist say we're based on the Bible Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe he said now where is it at see the works that I do shall you do also he said every creature every person that believes in him he said now where is it at that's his words heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never fail he said now where is that D he said oh it just shows you see it's not enough to just say it we've got to be the church we can't just talk about being the church we got to be the church we got to be the bride we've got to become that we we we're pressing into something where and that's why there sometimes there's you say well if I went down to the Baptist Church or some other church maybe I wouldn't have any stress and they'd just always tell me how broken I was and and I'd be okay no we're pushing into something yes we were broken but we've been made whole by the message of the hour we're becoming something we're not we don't we're not content with being left alone sir but we want to be changed we want to be different we want to be new because we want to go to a better world a better place we're not putting all our eggs in this basket right we're not planning on staying here but the greatest portion of our life is going to be somewhere else in a better place oh church you've only got so long to live all of us do I'm I I won't even say my age some of you Elders probably get mad at me cuz I'm not old but I'll say this I begin to think about the years and I think my goodness it just seemed went like that yeah and then you look you begin to year adds to year it adds to year and you look back at your life and you begin to think I better do something before it's too late but look this is the small part and none of us can avoid meeting our end we'll either go by a grave of the rapture so we might as well press into something better we might as well keep up the fight we might as well pick up our swords and and fight for every promise of the word of God not leave one stone unturned we we only got a certain amount of time to live why would we remain label to see why would we sit back and say well I'm just going to coast in I'm going to r no let's grab a hold of the promises of God let's do what God said we can do let's be what God said we can be oh if the church church can be on Fire Let's be on fire if we can if we can live for God with all of our we can love God with all of our heart soul and mind let's do that if God said we can forgive one another let's forgive one another let's go on let's move on into the promises of God are you with me tonight now these signs shall follow them to believe whatever he said that's what we want to do he said now where is it at that's his words heavens and earth will pass away my words will never fail he said now where is it that see oh it just shows what is it's a hybrid condition he said look here you take a big fine grain of corn that's hybrid you take that hybrid corn it's pretty corn but it only lasts one generation but you play it what do you get a little stalk comes up like this and turns yellow and wils down he said that's the way every denomination is when it's hybrid the man's words mixed with God's words it'll come up to the signs and wonders what Jesus said about believing the word and it turns yellow and so we can't accept accept it and goes back oh my oh I don't want to turn yellow do you that shows what we are it's it's how we how we respond when we're planted and what grows out of our life listen he said just like all them other spies did that went and looked at Cain and they come over there and said oh we look like grasshoppers aside of them we can't take them he said the amalekites will all these what what they're going to do and they went back and Caleb and Joshua being thoroughbreds amen by the word of God oh my thorough breads I like that sir I like that my have you ever watch you ever watch a good thorough bread run it was born to run right you ever watch you want to see something inspiring I don't say you should watch horse racing but if you've ever watched on YouTube Secretariat win the Belmont Stakes in in the 1970s Secretariat was a great horse and he was spread to do that all down through his bloodline he was the maybe the greatest horse that ever lived and he could run he could run and and why it was just in his jeans to run when all the other horses were just about done he just getting started he would stay in the back until the close to the end he' just pass everybody up and run right past them why he was bigger than everybody else he's faster than everybody he was a thorough bread he was bred to do that he was born to do oh Church don't you realize that's you and I today we were born to do what we're doing we were born to defeat Satan we were born to take the land we were born to be more than conqueror do you believe that tonight we were born to do that sir Caleb and Joshua were thoroughbreds by the word of God no God said I give you that land they said we're more than able to take it why they were born to do it amen and brother B said it depends on where you're born from if you're born of the word of God God's word has the he said let the word of God shine forth first no matter what anybody else look anything else looks like he said I don't care if the intellectual says this that or the other it has nothing to do with it God's word said so we are more than able to take it don't let the devil beat you up and say well I can't be what God said I could be you can be everything God said you could be if God said you can live right you can live right if God said you could you could be healed you can be healed God said you can you can worship Him you can worship him let God's word be a lie and every or every man's word be a lie and let God's word be true do you believe that tonight look he said has nothing to do with God's word said so we're more than able to take it if I preach that in my church a minister told me I'd be preaching to four posts in the church I said I'd preach to that we got more than four posts in here tonight right I said I'd preach you that yes sir God's word said so we can do it God said do it oh yeah he said they excuse themselves by this they excuse themselves by this see that's why they're blind to the message of the end time this last days when God is proving himself they try to class it as some kind of a spiritist or what I call it some mental illusion something on that order see they try to make it something that it isn't and Satan hasn't stopped they were doing that back in brother Brandon's time they're still doing it some some people you know just recently discovered all this nonsense on the internet and and it just blows their mind it's like that stuff's been there for a long time they just didn't have an internet to spread it but that stuff's been out there ever since I've been alive and and and evidently back in brother brandom's time they tried to say it was be's abub but they did that's Jesus too right they said he's a fortune teller he he got a devil right but they said some kind of mental telepathy when they know he can stand there and look upon the people and discern the very thoughts that's in their heart the Bible said so he said does not Hebrews the 4th chapter say the word of God is quicker and sharper than a two-edged sword can discern the very thoughts of the mind and he was that word I love this and when that word is preeminence in the man the same thing takes place again for the word what's he telling us Church the fact that he was standing there and God was using his body to do that meant the word and come back in preeminence again right but what does that mean it means that the word can be in preeminence in me it can be in preeminence in you now it won't make you discern what'll it make you do it'll make you become whatever part of the body you are are you with me now you won't be a prophet to the age we've already had the prophet to the age we don't need a prophet to the age but we do need a deacon we do need trustees we do need young people we do need Housewives we do need prayer warriors we do need we do need testimonies we do need people who live for God we do need people who who are firmly established on the word of God and what is that whatever part of the body you are you'll become that you have a potential because Christ has the preeminence again oh my let's not take that lightly Church the fact that that happened for the first time and at some point I want to go into that son of man ministry again but we we we don't want to take that lightly it's important when the same thing takes place again it shows the preeminence is in the man amen he said see how you can how can you stumble over this from now on he said there is so perfectly plain yes sir he said that's why they're blind same as it was in the days Christ was on earth oh my they stagger the same way they said he's be above they seen he could do it so they said he was born an illegitimate child kind of an Odd Fellow just possessed with some Devil he's Samaritan over there he's got a Devil in him that's how he does that and Jesus said I'll forgive you for that see calling the word of God the works of God an evil spirit he he said I'll forgive you for that but someday the Holy Ghost will come you believe he's here and one word against it will never be forgiven either in this world the world that is to come or that on or that great day he said it will not be forgiven so you see that's written plain in the scripture he said so when people come to that day no matter how intellectual how big a denomination they belong to it's condemned they have to be they blasphemed the Holy Ghost calling it Holy Roller something another had an untasty name or something like that he said God's church had to Bear it all the time I'll say this don't call don't mock The Works of God even if you don't understand something don't mock it even if it may have some somebody gets in the flesh don't mock it because if we mock it we get in trouble and we might be mocking God we need to be careful with that don't mock it let it become what it becomes because you'll see the fruit of it in the end right just follow the word follow the word but don't mock any manifestation of God because it might be might be God revealed revealing himself now look he and God's church has always been blasphemed and he said he said they blasphemed the Holy Ghost calling a holy roll or something another like that he said God's church had to Bear it all the time so we're still going to have to bear that it's just part of it we're going to have to bear it until we leave here there's going to be people that come against the message of the hour and I'll ask you why are they not persecuting the Catholics why are they not coming down on the Methodist they're coming down on the message why because it's true right and they're going to come against the truth it just ought to firm us up in our hearts that much more it's always going to be there we don't try to hide it it's there but it doesn't change what God Said now look he said God's church had to Bear it all the time even Paul before a grip said in the way is called heresy which means crazy that's the way I worship the god of our fathers a great intellectual scholar had to come to that place in the way that's called heresy why it was revealed to him that Pillar of Fire hanging before him said I am Jesus the great God was in the wilderness y with Moses I'm he and it's hard for you to kick against the bricks listen the reason why it's so hard for some people you know if you got a revelation of who Christ is the word and that it's right it won't be hard for you to not cut your hair if you're a woman right it's not going to be hard why not because you want to fit in but because you believe the word is right and if the pastor and everybody else started doing it right you wouldn't do it because you got a revelation it's not because somebody beats you over the head with it and and many times we we have these conflicts and things in our life because there's just a lack of Revelation what we need is to a revelation that the word is right and if we get a revelation of who he is in the word those things will begin to begin to come around right and so I don't condemn somebody for struggling with that that but you you need a revelation you need to know the message is true listen we're in an age where you you got you're going to have to know that it's right or you're not going to make it because the church will have ups and downs and if you depend on the ups and downs in the church to make it say well as long as things are going good I'm doing good you're going to be disappointed right and things are going to happen you're going to fall away we don't go by feelings we don't go by our own feelings we don't go by the pastor's feelings we don't go by the song leaders feelings what do we go by the word right the word is still true even if I'm the only one that believes it but I believe you won't be the only ones God's given us friends and and brothers and sisters in a church to that we love one another but but if we're the only ones that believe it it's still true but still I'm going to worship him in the way that's called heresy he said that's the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the God my fathers he said today people say it's a denomination he said it's Jesus Christ New Birth revealed in you I love that it's Jesus Christ the new birth I'm almost done listen to me now the new birth revealed in you that he has the pinenes that he might Express his words he didn't say he didn't say the new birth revealed in me that I might Express his words right he wasn't talking about himself he was talking about the bride right the bride is going to have something to say you got something to say to the world that you live in you young people you got something to say to the world you're living in you young married couples you got something to say something to prove sir you are his proof you young ladies you got something to prove you to the world that you're living in all of you you you widows that struggle and go through the time that you go through but yet you got something to prove you're going to make it God kept a widow before if he could do it back then he can do it today oh my if he's kept those that are poor if he's kept those that are that that are needy if he's kept those that are tired and given strength to the weak he can do it again and if that promis is in the Bible I am more than able to take it I am more than able you are more than able what is it he wants to reveal he wants to speak through you he wants to express his word in you now think about this you know the devil tells you you can't pay your ti but every time you do you're expressing the word of Christ not because I need your money or want your money but because that's what the Bible says are you with me now every time oh my every time you come to the house of God through opposition through struggle when it's hard when you got a long drive every time you make it to the house of God sometimes your body's hurting or the kids are all crying and you say why did we even come what are you doing you're expressing the word of God it said not forsaking the Assembly of yourself together you're speaking that from your life when you don't give up are you with me now when when you're pushed to the Limit but you don't give up when you when when you're so bound it seem like it's so tired and so weary but you worship Him Anyway amen oh when you do that you're expressing the word where he said praise him all every let everything that hath breath praise the Lord oh I want to be an expression of that word today that's an expression you're an expression of God's word I may not feel like it you may not feel like it but we're not here because we feel like it we're here because he wants to express himself through US whenever you show love to a member of the body of Christ that's right you're expressing the word in your life oh my that's what I want to do I want to express the word and my God helped me to do that as a Pastor look he might Express his word let's not take this slightly church it's important he said and anything someone say anything anything that he's promised in this last days he can bring it to pass but he doesn't stop there through his body as he's working I love that how does he do it through his body you see I don't need the body of Christ well it seems like we do right he's bringing his words to pass through his body as he's working he said it's just exactly the word of God made manifest what does that mean it means every promise in the book is mine it's all possible I'm always struck as musicians come to I'm always struck by the possibility of every service it's possible yes sir steart I don't know about you but I know as a minister I I look for that I look for that because might be a service where a child is born it's the kind of expectation that you have when a when a woman is is it's far along if your wife if you're married and you got you've had children you know right right when she was nine months you know and and you know that that baby could be born any day it it was a possibility every day you wake up today could be the day there's possibility I'm struck by that every time we come to the house of God there's a possibility cuz I know people are sick but there's a possibility of healing why because every promise is possible sir Hallelujah there's a possibility we play the goodness of God the possibility I think it's in C the possibility is that you could be delivered it's possible if we can just make ourselves believe that it's possible if it don't happen today I'm going to believe it tomorrow if it don't happen tomorrow I'm going to believe it the next day it's still possible you want to know what else is possible a body change sister Jackie one of these days we're going to walk out of this body into another body that's possible in this service hallelujah it's possible in the morning it's possible tomorrow it's possible the next day what is it he's here he's proved that he's here he's speaking through his bride in spite of Leal we're still here we're still speaking we're still working what is it it's a possibility what God can do I say let's take him at his word let's just take him at his word worship him in this place as if we were already in that place take him at his word believe what he said say Lord you've been good to me I believe that your promises are true I'm going to walk in them I believe like Caleb I am more than able we are well able to take this land we're not old we're not defeated we're not tired we're not weak we're able we're able amen oh I believe it tonight church do
