your blood and by your choosing Lord for the foundation of the world we thank you for that Lord we couldn't do that for ourselves there's nothing that we could we could do to make ourselves more loved in your sight more thankful that you love us anyway Lord and we thank you today for all the the the things that you've done to allow us to be in this service today now I pray God that you would meet every need I I I think of the different ones the hands that were raised Lord you know what's behind every hand Lord I don't have the ability of a prophet to look back and see in the people's lives what's went on what's happened what will happen Lord your word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I pray that you would discern today and speak to every heart Lord may you

we need each other and we need the word of the Lord even more than anything else amen Ecclesiastes 3 and one I I keep forgetting I also intended to say that brother Herold hilderbrandt passed away this week a giant in this message I didn't know him well but brother Herold was a giant in this message and deserves uh our our respect but he's in a better place today the things that he's preached for and and and worked for and everywhere I went everywhere I've gone in the world brother Harold was there 20 years before 30 years before and so I'm so thankful for that and and he did work behind the scenes that there will be a great reward for a love like that for this message and for spreading it around uh but we're here today and it's our job to to spread the message but I just want to say that about our brother God bless him and his family and the church there as they prepare to change some things from our brother passing away pray the Lord would bless them and help them and comfort them Ecclesiastes 3 and one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together in other words a time to build and a time to destroy a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to s a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace verse 11 he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning when you came into this world you had almost nothing to do with it it would have been impossible for you to plan your entrance just as impossible as it is to plan your exit and the truth is that when you came into the world you uh you could not even think you didn't have the capacity to think and then one day you were born and you took that first breath and many of us were there with our children when they took that first breath of life and and they were waiting uh for that and and they come out of the womb and and they're there they're alive they take that breath they they can't think to take it it's not something that they plan it's not something that was uh could be thought out and and figured out but it just happened come on now it just happened and yet during that time you have to realize that you're f first breath was actually planned by God that he actually knew when your first breath would be and he knew what what family you would be born into many of us if we could choose what family we would be born into we would be born into riches we would be born into wealth we would be born into good looks right if we could choose that we would we would be born just how we wanted to be born but yet we had no choice in that we we were born some of us into different ult situation some into money some into poverty some into situations where we had mothers or fathers that loved us some into situation sadly where there was no mother or father present and maybe giving up for adoption or or worse yet having an uncaring parent that was there in in many situations but yet you're here this morning you're here in the house of the Lord and you love the message of the hour and you love the God's word and there's something about it though you the your path of life and your birth path brought you up a certain way but yet you can look back and say what would I be unless God had made me what I am so you could say like Paul did by the grace of God I am what I am I had no choice in taking my first breath but yet here I am today believing God's word so there were and you go through life and I want to speak to you today because there's a there's a spirit on the age of depression and there's a spirit of of suicidal thoughts and things that come on people's minds and and it causes you to actually get despair so much of your own life that you begin to think well you begin to plan your last breath and you say well Christians don't do that well brother brandom did and we find actually that Elijah did in the juniper tree experience he said it' been better if I hadn't been born we find that job did that as well when he come to a time where every he lost everything and everything was had gone out from under him and he lost his children and his family and everything else and we find that job cried out to God and he said oh I wish I'd never been born right amen I wonder if we were honest this morning how many of us would maybe have said the same thing at some point in our life right amen some of you have hurt so bad at some point that you wish you'd never been born that's right some of you have hurt emotionally that's right so bad yeah right that you wish you'd never been born but you didn't have control yeah over your first breath yeah and the one that did all right yeah chose you to be here sir right all right I hope you're hear me today yes sir we have this illusion of control over our lives right and especially as new Christians and and we have some new Christians and and some young people that are coming up we need to remember that we don't have control yeah he does we don't get to control our lives in every little a yes we want to plan we want to do right we want to live right but yet we've got to lay on the mercies of God to trust in the strength of the arms of Jehovah that we can look at him and say Lord I realized when I take my when I took my first steps I I that wasn't a planned event it was just somehow I had the strength and the ability to take my first steps and when I take my last steps that won't be a planned event but it'll be somehow orchestrated by you to take me off of the earth and so I'm when I'm walking in between as I'm stepping my way walking my way through life I can't plan every event some of you look ahead so far down the road and you worry about things that are coming tomorrow but Jesus said take no thought for tomorrow sufficient to the day is the evil thereof so you don't know what's coming tomorrow there might be death in the future there might be pain but there might also be Rapture yeah there might all heyen I believe there's Rapture in our future I believe there's a there's a body change in our future I believe that there's joy in your future there's there's Health in your future and yet at the same time it might not be but the one who knows the one who plans your birth knows what you're going through and why yes that's good brother amen David in the Bible went through some difficult times oh come on look at Psalms chap 22 and you'll find in this scripture that David God had to bring David into such a place in his life for the Joel that he he actually felt yeah so badly as to say the words that Jesus would say on the cross yes so in order to get David to cry out in Prophecy yeah God didn't put him in a good service yeah and anoint him and make him run the aisles right that's right yes sir in order to get David in the place where he needed him to be he let him go through and David did dance he did run the house but he had to get him in such a place where he felt like everybody was against him yes sir and he felt like he was being persecuted and he felt so low that he cries out my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me and not knowing that's exactly what needed to be said because it would be a prophecy of the son of David who would come on the cross and say the same thing yeah amen yeah there's a reason sometimes for what we go through that's right and so David in this great Psalm 22 if you go and read the whole thing maybe later you'll find that it's a great Psalm of of the death of Christ on the cross and a prophecy of that event and it says in verse 7 all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but notice how David Comforts himself and this may be a simple thought this morning but I just want us to to ponder it to dwell on it for a moment as we're here in the house of the Lord he said Thou Art he that took me out of the womb yes had no control over that right there's nothing I could do to keep myself alive right I couldn't think yeah you understand when I'm talking about there's nothing I could do I couldn't prepare or plan or think I'm going to breathe right right my first breath I never thought I'm going to breathe yeah you realize living a Christian Life is much that same way yes right you're not sitting there saying well I'm going breathe I'm going to do right I'm going to walk I'm going to do right but it's it's a natural breath yes you walk in the spirit yes you walk with the Lord you go to church you you hang out around God's people you fellowship with God's people you work for God and you do the things that you you know to do but you can't you don't know but when that Breath of Life comes into your life all the sudden you just begin to do yes that's right right when my my kids were born when Peter was born he took a little bit of roughing up from the doctor but eventually he started to cry and when he started to cry he never quit it took a while for him to quit but what was it it was it was natural and when he had need of something oh hope we can he today see we're completely dependent on Jesus I don't care if you've been in the message for 40 years if you've been a Christian Hall of your life you are completely this morning dependent upon Christ yes sir and so when you're completely dependent on him what happens is that that you go through and you find yourself in a difficult situation what can you do about it well brother tells us there was found no better way than than to cry for it yeah you could he said you could ring a teach them to ring a bell you could teach him to speaking great words but God said when when a baby had a need that he would just cry for it yeah and that's what you and I he wants to us to learn to do is just cry when we have a need just ask for it yeah amen amen you took me out of the womb notice thou did make me hope I love this when I was upon my mother's breast in other words you gave me hope there was hope of a future yeah not by my own effort are you hearing me now not by my own effort but I had hope when I was a baby amen yes oh God if you could realize how good God had been through to you through your whole life we'd never have to tell you to raise your hands yes sir we never have to tell you to sing we never have to have to try to work people up to dance we never have to wor people up to worship God why because God was there when you were born he was there in the room when you were born and he was there when you took your first breath don't you believe he's there with you now if he was there with you before you ever made a move toward God before you ever said Lord I love you before you ever did anything for God he was already there if he was there for you then he'll be with you trust in that today Church yes sir trust in that don't get caught up well I can't do this I can't do that I can't live like they do I can't work like they do I can't preach like he does I can't sing like she does no you you stay focused on him he's with you this morning yes sir yes sir amen prise God yes sir he said thou just make me hope when I was upon my mother's breast I was cast upon thee yes I love this I I was cast upon thee from the womb yes what does that mean I I couldn't keep myself myself alive yeah right I couldn't make myself who I am then you I'm going to figure it all out when I get it all figured out then I'm going to trust God nonsense you don't even know how you were born you don't even know how you're alive you don't know why you were driving down the road one day and a semi truck come over in your lane and somehow you missed it and somehow you made it around and other folks were that would have been on that same road would not have made it you don't know how you would get Co end up in the hospital and everybody else ended up on a later brother David but you come out that same day and God begin to work in your life you don't understand why that happened the way it did but he said I was cast upon you from my mother's womb right yes you see our total dependence on God today I was cast upon you from my mother's womb Thou Art my God not from when I was baptized not from when I received the Holy come on are you with me this morning not from the moment that I that I said Lord I'm going I'm going to serve you I'm going to preach your gospel I'm going to live for you but from my mother's belly yes sir Hallelujah all right on Amen Hallelujah Psalm 71 verse 5 for thou art My Hope Oh Lord God yes look at the Hopeless day but JT that we live in today we've talked about it many times look how hopeless it looks but if he could take care of you when you were a helpless baby yes yeah how much more could he take care of you today and some some people you know as you get older you get more and more like that you become more and more helpless but if he would you were cast on him from your mother's womb yes why don't you cast your cares and burdens on him today your whole life is there you're there because he chose for you to be there you're in this service this morning because he chose you he said but I don't I don't understand the difficult difficulties of life but it's in those difficulties that's the moment you you reach up like David did and said I was born and when I was born you were there amen right you were there at my first breath psalm 71:5 for thou art My Hope Oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from my youth yes amen by thee have I been holding up from the womb he was propping me up in this world yes sir you don't realize when you were born it wasn't just the doctor that took hold of you or the Midwife it wasn't just the it wasn't just your mother that grabbed you and put you in her arms right but when you were born David said you took me yeah can you get a picture of that today when I was born David said you took me and you held me thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels literally from my mother's heart amen my praise shall be continually yes of thee Oh my he said I am as a Wonder unto many they don't understand David was a Wonder because of how God blessed him and because of what he went through right huh yeah he wasn't just a Wonder because God blessed him but he was a Wonder because of what he'd been through but look at the testimony listen David was God's thinking that was what God wanted as we've been preaching at Saul about Saul on Wednesday night Saul was what the people wanted yeah but David was what God wanted and there was nothing that could keep him out of the throne room yes he didn't have to take it into his own hands when he could have killed Saul and taken the kingdom for himself he refused to do it why because he didn't have to manhandle the people he didn't have to take it in his own hands but he trusted God yes I'm a Wonder to many how many can say Amen to that today I'm a Wonder to many my family don't all understand it the people around me don't all understand it the preachers and the other folk in the denomination they don't understand it I'm a wonder why are you still in the message of the hour why do you still believe in Malachi 4 why do you still come on church are you with me this morning why do you still believe what you believe I'm a Wonder unto many but thou are my strong Refuge yes Hallelujah Hallelujah let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honor at church what does it say a church all the day amen cast me not off now watch David fast forwards like the old BCR some of y'all don't know what that is these kids don't know what that is you put the VCR in makes you feel old don't it put the VCR in and and it wasn't wor it was never rewind so you had to rewind it and then if you wanted to skip forward you didn't just click a button you you push the button and it go go forward right so David what does he do he fast forwards he said I was a wonder I'm a wondering many from my birth you were from my first breath you were there with me you loved you took care of me you held me up yeah and here he is at the end of life brother Joe and he's saying cast me not off in the time of old age yeah forsake me not when my strength faileth amen but look at look at how he's what he's talking about Lord I can praise you because you were there with me when I was born every one of us sitting here this morning can thank God for being born yes yes that's right see brother Ben I'm not very happy this morning I I don't have very much in my favor I don't have a lot of things and I don't have a lot of money and everything's man you can thank God for being born yes amen you didn't have to be born but God allowed you to be born and he said that's enough for me to worship you just the fact that I'm born but he said when I get old yeah I know we've got some folks that are getting up there and you get to a place like I said where it gets more and more that you're dependent on on other people to help you through life you're dependent on others you think what am I going to do if I get old and I'm by myself what am I going to do but he said Lord cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth let me tell you this morning if he did not forsake you when you were helpless coming out of the womb then he will not forsake you when you're helpless in a nursing home if you're helpless at home if you're helpless in the hospital he will not forsake you in your old age if he did not forsake you with your first breath he will not forsake you with your last breath amen amen Hallelujah listen Psalm 139 And1 oh Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest oh we need to acknowledge the omniscience of God today all right th knowest my downsitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought far off yeah God knows not only what you do and what you think but also why you think it and why you do it thou compassest my path and my lying down art acquainted with all my ways there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together I love the way he puts this thou has beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me and the imagery there and I preached about that that before the imagery there is of someone walking up behind you and putting her hand on her shoulder where you can feel their presence you can't see that they're there but you know they're there because they got their hand on you yes he said you beset me behind and before and put your hand on me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it wheither shall I go from thy Spirit whe shall I flee from thy presence now if I Ascend up into heaven yes all right thou are there yes if I make my bed in hell yes sir I'll be honest with you brother George I by my own decisions many times I've made my bed sir in the wrong place yes sir yes sir are you with me huh I I've done things that uh that were had an attitude about me or or actions that I did and things that went to bed and I thought oh God how could you ever forgive someone like me because I'm in this place where I'm at but if I Ascend up into heaven you're there if I make my bed in hell yeah still there prise God we want to blame God for stuff but he didn't say if you make my bed in hell he said if I make my bed in hell behold amen even though I made the mistake even though though I'm the one to blame but you're there oh aren't you glad he was with you he wasn't just with you when you got saved he's been with you all of your life he's been with you from the very beginning and he'll be with you all the way to the end he will not leave you or forsake you can you grab a hold of that this morning church I don't care what else you understand listen if this knowledge is too high for you nothing else you understand will ever make sense right it will never help you if the knowledge of his presence and him being there and him being in control and taking care of you is not there then nothing else that you ever know will make any sense or be able to help you in any real way that's right you got to know that he is he that believeth he that cometh to God Must Believe believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him sir amen he said I I can't attain to it whether shall I go if i s In Heaven There are there if I make my bed in hell there are there if I take the wings of the morning dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me yes sir thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night should be light about me in other words nothing I do is secret yeah amen y the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou listen Hast possessed my Reigns and when you see something that says Reigns in the Bible that's actually what we would call today our DNA or our our nature our nature science could call it DNA we would call it nature scripturally it's nature because now you possess what makes makes me do what I do yeah there's a powerful Revelation there church you possessed my Reigns what's he telling you yes you were for ordained by God yeah you possessed my Reigns means you were not only there when I was born but when my daddy was born when my grandpa was born when my great-grandfather was born all the way back to the beginning you orchestrated it to be like it is I may not like what I am and the way I look but he said you possessed my DNA you know me you don't just know me but you were there and you you guided me through life yeah amen you say well it's just the way I am but God allowed you to be that way for a reason yes sir are you with me now amen and yet yet there's Brokenness in us God allows the Brokenness but he calls you to Healing yes he doesn't call you to remain broken thank you Lord he doesn't call you to stay in sin Paul says shall we continue in sin what shall we continue in sin God forbid amen walk in the spirit but now you have you are free to walk in the spirit Why by the grace of God who possessed your Reigns who knows your DNA in every little Quirk about your life yeah look my substance he said I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderful F made wonderfully made you want to kill that think for a moment you want to wake up in the morning and people use this many times of abortion but look at it in the sense of an adult now that's true I'm not worth living come on well you you're you're putting it on him I'm not worth nothing yeah I'm worthless I'm I'm unbelievably bad right you may be but there is a remedy there is a remedy and no he didn't cause you to be unbelievably bad but he allowed it yeah he was there when you became bad the first time you ever took a cookie from the cookie jar he was there that's right yeah you get under condemnation many times think about this some of you ladies maybe and you backside and you cut your hair off you knew better you knew better at least by head knowledge but he was there yes when you did it that's good brother he he was there on he knew about it maybe he had to show you that you were broken so that you could come back to Christ yeah are you with me he allowed you to do that to take that make that choice but he's also giving you a way back yeah amen called repent repentance yeah and when you repent and are Justified it's as though you never did it in the first place yes sir you never smoked you never drank you never committed adultery you never cut your hair you never wore makeup you never did any of those things yes sir oh I hope you can see it tonight I I'm fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and I am a work of God Amen yeah right you are too that my soul that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth yes oh my when that first when that the the first germ of life ever was awakened and The Germ and the the the egg come together he was there he was with you then as he is with you now he said and and Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in other words he knew what you would be he knew what every bit of your DNA how it would be manifested how it would be expressed but and to know that he would not only have to know who you were but what you would do yeah because your DNA actually is an expression who you are comes out as an expression but that expression can be changed by your environment right it's why some people can have the same DNA and act in completely different ways it changed by environment right you could have a twin and the two twins become almost completely different because they're almost exactly the same but they're just some little variance and so then you could have two people who were Twins and raised in the same house but yet had different experiences as adults they would be different yes right but God knew about that he wasn't unaware of that he said you saw my substance who I am yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written that's why brother brand could say for the bill that he said he said I haven't lost a hair where'd your hair go he said I haven't lost one of them yeah where were they before I got them well they were in the mind of God he knew how many hairs I had on my head right he's able to count them now look he said which in continues were fashioned and when is yet there was none of them so as this working was going on as this life come into my body and as I was growing in my mother's womb you already knew me what I would be everything that I would be so if you've had a stroke or or you've had a heart attack or you've had something that's changed you and yet you look at that and you're frustrated by it you think well I can't be what I was but God knew what you would be even the things that would go wrong you're still here this morning yeah amen that's right amen hallelujah how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them You' got to think about God like that yes you can't sit there and think Lord if you could have only made things go differently but each one of his thoughts are precious yes everything that you've been through is precious to God the Bible says even the death of the Saints is precious in the sight of God yes his thoughts are precious how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the Su of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee brother Brandon put it this way he said your birth here was pre-planned yeah you didn't plan it but somebody did did you know that your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here he said the infinite God know and to be infinite he had to know every flea I love this that would ever be in the earth and how many times it would bad its eye yeah he never reached the spot where the G where he said that's too much I don't need to know that have you ever been there somebody be telling you a bunch of stuff he said wait that happens in counseling a lot by the way because people's problems are a lot simpler than what they think they are the truth is the problem solver gave his word to us to live by and His holy spirit in us to guide us yes yes so many times that the complex things that we have and and sometimes I'll tell people I didn't need to know that yeahuh I just didn't need to know that but there's nothing that God don't need to know and nothing that he doesn't know that's right amen when Bo When you pray to him he already knew as you're struggling for the right words he already knew oh God what you would say and so much so that brother Bram typed to the faith of a young child who was sitting there praying his ABCs yeah and I said what are you doing he said I'm praying he said well he said well why are you just saying your ABCs he said well he said I don't know how to pray but I believe that God knows how to put it together yeah oh the important thing is not the words that are said but it's the action of prayer amen it's doing what God Said many times the important thing you say well I want to go to church when I feel like it no the important thing is not how you feel when you come to church but it's the fact that you're there yes sir and by being there you're honoring the word of God and God honors you with his presence yeah amen amen everything was pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here yes the infinite God knew it to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be in the Earth how many times it would bat its eye he said that's infinite he said our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite God he knew all things therefore there's nothing out of cater yes sir it's hard to wrap our minds around but it's absolutely the truth now the new birth is the same way God was there when you took your first breath yeah yeah as a christianen your first breath you have to acknowledge that well I got to figure it out for the been he was there and you couldn't make yourself yes sir take your first breath that's right as a Christian you could do everything he said you could pray you could come down to the altar I still believe in altar Clause I believe God moves that way don't you I still believe in the mov moving of the Holy Spirit yeah I believe if you have a pull in your heart whether you're saved or unsaved filled with the Holy Ghost you should come that's right if you feel in your heart that you should come you should come but yet God God already he was there yeah and and all of your effort could not make you a Christian you could not become a Christian by putting forth and exerting all of the oh I'm going to come to church I'm going to pay my tith if you were not in the mind of God you can't get blood out of etern it brother BR tells us in things that are to be you can't get blood out turn of you can't make something that God if it wasn't God he said if you were ever God you were always Gods you were in the mind of God before the foundation you cannot make yourself a Christian but you can follow when he said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you can trust him that he'll do what he said yes but you can't that you're not making yourself a Christian because that first breath is a Christian come from God yes amen just as much as your first breath as a human being yes all right come from God isn't that a wonderful moment if you remember when your children were born maybe you remember when you were born but I kind of doubt it maybe somebody does I I'm going to say no one remembers when they're born but you know maybe maybe someone does I hope not but but maybe you remember when you were born and but you you couldn't do that for yourself you couldn't think now I'm going to breathe right I'm GNA be a Christian I'm going to be born you can't make yourself that let me let me go a little bit further your first breath your final breath you also can't control your next breath one of these days I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here but I believe the spirit of the Lord is here this morning and we'll go on a little further but look one of these days you're going to take a step and the next breath you you're in a new body God Amen well what did I do to put myself there you made yourself ready but you can't put the Press of Life yeah you just breathe right you just breathe that's how you get through life you can't by your own effort put yourself in a Rapture if you weren't in the mind of God you'll never be there right right but you have to believe I am in the mind of God yeah I was there before the foundation of the earth and if I was there I'll always be there there's nothing out of cater and one day I'm going to step and I'm going to breathe I'm going to breathe out yes sir that's it come listen you can't even control how you become a Christian Paul couldn't control it Galatians 1:15 he said but when it pleased God when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb yeah right he already chose me to be a prophet to the Gentiles he already chose me to be who I am but one day it pleased God hallelujah and you think well that day I decided to go to church no there was something on the inside of you that was calling you to the house of God thought it was your own thoughts but there was something inside of you God chose a day amen so don't look back at your life and think oh I've wasted my life I've done no God chose the day you go when it pleased God you go who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace Hallelujah to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen he said I confer not with flesh or blood why because I couldn't make myself an apostle I can't give myself the Revelation yeah are you hearing me Paul said I didn't go learn it from the Ancients he'd already learned all that stuff yeah but I went down in to Damascus I went into Arabia returned to Damascus 1 Corinthians 15:9 for I am the least of the Apostles I'm not meat or fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God how many can say that this morning with honest heart you can say this morning by the grace of God I am what I am it pleased God one day that I would be saved it pleased him to give me the Holy Ghost it pleased him to call me into whatever service I'm in it pleased him yes that's why you'll never be able to do away with preachers that's right it pleased God separate them from his mother's womb their mother's womb amen you can't brother brandom said those five gifts were predestined look it up they're predestined by God to be in the church yes you can't separate that it's you don't make yourself a preacher all the study you could do all the you'll never have a supernatural element in your ministry unless God separated you sir and he called you and when he called you you may not be able to speak very well you may not have a lot up here I know I I know a doctor looked at my head the other day and said I've never seen so much fluid in a person's head there may not be much up here in the way of brains but I'll tell you this man I was separated from my mother's womb how do you know because when I preach God and God Honors that yes sir right and he he gives us the ministry we don't give ourselves the ministry but it gives us the ministry in our families and our churches and the people around us that's the fruit of it that's right the proof is in the pudding so to speak not because I say I'm a preacher anybody could say that yeah right or anybody else what's the fruit of brother rand's Ministry we'll get to that in a moment what was the fruit of his ministry he was separated from his mother's womb to be a prophet and you are the fruit yeah Glory the bride on the Earth today is the proof of brother Min he says he said by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labored more abundantly than they all that's what Grace will do for you yeah it'll make you work for God yeah it'll make you serve him with all of your heart yes he said yet not I but the grace of God which was with me look what job says about Last Breath see you can't control that either put them thoughts of suicide out of your mind thoughts of depression yeah well I'm just going to quit put that out of your mind he didn't call you to quit you were born to win not to quit quit thinking about quitting right well I'm just going to quit it's a long ways to church and it's hard and I'm just going to quit listen about the time you're about to give up there's going to be something come on the inside of you that's going to raise you up maybe it's maybe it's this morning maybe as you listen to the word being preached there going to be something I was going to quit after today I was going to give up listen I preached the last sermon for some people I know what that's like but you can't control that sir I've told you before I preached a sermon I'll never forget it to a lady who walked into the church that morning and she' come off and on to church she wasn't there every every service but but she was a a part of the church and a a member as far as I knew a Godly person and she come in and set I'll never forget it back on the back pew I was preaching at brother Ivy that Sunday morning on the back pew that woman come in and sit and she sat there all that morning tears coming down her face and she'd come up to be prayed for and I prayed for her and she left and she went home and she got in a spat with her husband and for some reason her husband picked up a gun and blew her away the next day yeah and I thought about that moment sir there's nothing could keep me out of the pulpit yeah because I had a job to do and then every time I preach I don't know I have no clue yes sir who I'm going to preach to for the last time yeah are you with me yeah that haunts me today think about that what what could I have said differently but it was a pre-ordained moment God called her to be there at that moment in that time God's called you to be here at this moment in this time that's right job says man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble yeah everybody get say amen yes he cometh like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not a man lasts just about as long as a flower out here in the churchyard with the kids running around they pierc for a while and they cut it down yeah right that's way my flowers are at the house for years said leave the flowers alone they'll only be there a little while you cut them down you bring them in you shorten their lifespan oh God that's what happens when we get our hands on our own life we want to control things yeah we can't control it yes sir he said th thou open Thine Eyes Upon such a one bringeth to him me into judgment he says with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one seeing his days are determined sir the number of his months are with thee thou Hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass yeah that's the word of God turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as a hirling his day David tells us just about what those boundaries are he said the days of our years are three score years and 10 I'm sorry for everybody over 80 over 70 and if by reason of strength they be four score Years sir yet is their strength or the best part of it is labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away we're told by the scripture that life passes quickly I'm sorry if I'm depressing you this morning just just hang with me he said behold thou has made my days as a hand breath yeah they measured things by hand breath it's the smallest unit of measurement my day is a hand breath my age is as nothing before thee rarely every man at his best fate is altogether vanity I thought about you sister Fritz when I when I uh when I uh wrote this or when I when I put it down when I was reading this I thought about sister Fritz cuz she told me one time that she heard the president I believe it was at Pearl Harbor over the radio announced or the people announced the newsman announced that Pearl Harbor had been hit think about that that a long time ago right some of y'all lived about that long huh you've lived your days right anything every day is a gift now every day is a gift but your day is just like a hand breath there's not been it's just like it passed like that and these people that are elderly could tell you that they could look back and say my days were just like that make them count Church yeah amen you'll you you'll never regret spending time with your family spending time with the family of God loving people but you will regret every moment that's true that you spent worrying hating yeah with bitterness yeah yes sir waste yes yeah the Bible says verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity Psalm 1444 man is like to vanity his days there as a shadow that passes away James 4:13 says go to now you that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain so you make a plans for for trade and to do things he said whereas you know not what we shall be on tomorrow what is your life it is even a vapor or a Mist appears for a little while while and like the fog that burns off in the morning it just goes away one day you look where did Brother Where did so and so go they're not there Jesus tells the story of the rich man who who brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits that's a rich man he said this will I do I'll pull down my Barns and build greater and I'll bestow all my fruits and my goods I will say to my soul soul thou has much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be married but God said unto him thou fool this night thy Soul shall be required of thee then who shall those things be which thou H has provided yes amen so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich sir toward God yes talking about brother hildbrand thinking about him this week that man was rich toward God what about you today what have you put over there right I plan on taking a trip this summer overseas and and brother Joel may go with me and I we haven't got it completely set yet so I don't want to tell you where just yet but and what it's going to be but but we uh planning on taking that trip and as I look forward to it and I think but you know what what why would we go I get thinking about that what what would be a successful trip if we're going to spend thousands of dollars and and fly overseas what what would be a success what would be a success if one Soul made a move move towards God that would be successful that's right that would be worth more than the thousands of dollars more than because the place where we're going it's very difficult to to preach and and to be in public as a minister it's like how what what would be worth it yeah it would be worth it if one person God sir what would be worth it I thought about that about my own Ministry what would make the years worth it I've spent I'm young but I've spent a quarter of a century in the pulpit that's right makes it sound longer if you say it that way I've spent 25 years preaching this year be 25 years what makes it worth it one Soul yeah one Soul if one person yeah what makes your life worth it have you got things here on the Earth but have you gathered up riches in heaven I don't want your money church I'm not talking to you about that but have you have you have you ever reach George the soul have you been a friend to somebody have you talked to somebody I thought about that the other night we saw your friend up there at there Mike chce I think was up there and and we saw him up there at the southern gospel singing and I was watching him and I thought he's been a friend to David David's been a friend to him and I thought well that's something that that's a a leading there's something there because there could be eternal life bestowed through that friendship there could be a there could be life given something could take place and and I thought about that and I thought Lord help me to be a friend yeah help me to be a a person what's what's it worth One Soul would be worth 10,000 worlds worth all of our time all of our effort oh my brother brand put this way he said but now until that time there will be a time when it'll be your last breath how many know that today yes whether you go by way of the Grave or go on a Rapture he said but until that time until he comes we want to live each day like he might come the next minute because it might the end of your life at that minute this may be some of our last breath we have it in us now what if the last breath was the breath that you're taking now yeah what if you reach a place in the next moment you lost your mind you'd never be able to think clearly about the things of the Lord anymore yeah you never be able to care for your family what if this was the last breath you'd ever take with purpose think about it yes sir as far as you could tell although God has a purpose yes sir as far as you could tell there'd be no purpose you'd never be no again well he'll be with you then y but what if this was the last breath what what kind of a breath would you take would you would you I hate you come on now reach think about it well those people are just evil I hate those people they're crazy what would you do with it would you would you breathe in and breathe out an argument I know I'm laboring on this this morning but it's just what the Lord put on my heart and I have to preach that what would you do with it yeah you don't know when you're going this may be our last breath in us now so you want to live like it is yeah the Bible says occupy till I come brother brandom talks about and I don't have time to go through all this this morning so you just bear with me as I kind of skip through it brother M talks about talking to a nurse he said I had a wonderful afternoon what he'd had happened he'd been to the doctor's office this is found in the rejected King if you've been following that on our Wednesday Services the one he preaches in Jeffersonville he preaches it twice but in the rejected King he said I had a wonderful afternoon talking to a famous doctor in Louisville he said they heard about the Glorious things of the Lord the nurse he said her father was a doctor and she'd come over and sit in my room most the afternoon come in dropped in a wonderful person he said a little hard some of those around the message he said kind of staunch real Presbyterian to start with met some of those too he said but left with tears running down her cheeks yes he said God's got them just everywhere in doctor's office officers and nurses he said I don't believe there's a nurse in Norton's infirmary Infirmary Hospital that I didn't testify to about having the Holy Ghost this convicted me man yeah I remember I got in the hospital one time for a week and I got put in the hospital I had a strep and I let it go too long refused to go to the doctor like some other people I know I refused to go to the doctor and I I let it go too long end up in the hospital almost died and and I finally got a little better and I was Gra man after that first or second day I wanted to go home I was tired I didn't realize they come in there and stuck you every day in your stomach you know with that stuff to keep your the blood clot from Foreman I hated that man I hated everything about it and at some point I I got in there and I got so frustrated and at some point I just began to pray Lord I can't do anything about it what am I going to do and I just and the Lord spoke to me he said make the best of it said okay what what can I do I can pray for these people sitting there feel sorry for for myself when nobody's coming to see me nobody I didn't tell nobody about it so it's a little bit difficult for people to come see you when you don't tell nobody it's been several years ago I sitting there feeling sorry for myself and Lord just said make the best of it I'm sitting there what can I do what can I possibly do and I've told you the story before my wife ended up going home and the alternator went out on my truck as she was driving home she was left on the side of the road her phone was dead she was on the side of the road dark on a four-lane road in Jonesboro Arkansas and a woman stopped by there who's she's friends with to this day a woman out of a nominal Church stopped by the recognizer to be a Christian took the kids there and I thought what if God put me in the hospital so that my wife an alternator could go bad in my truck so that my wife would be on the side of the road so that somebody would give her a fresh cup of cold water so they could be saved there you go [Applause] Amen brother Brandon was in the hospital for whatever reason that he was there and in the doctor's office and he said I asked her ask her if she was baptized in the name of Jesus not a doctor i' come in contact with anywhere he he said tell them about it we ain't got much time brother no matter how hard it seems here just wait till you cross that last breath Yonder and see you wish you had done it he said yester don't wait till that time let's do it right now this is the hour he said oh they might disagree and fume and fuss a little about it but they don't mean it they really don't mean it they're all right they go to fussing at you remember they don't really mean it they don't mean it they just maybe been taught something they just hang to that you can see their idea I wish we had this kind of patience with each other yeah with other message people with other people we go to church with they get to fuss with you they don't really mean it oh God just be patient God will lead them if they're God feel they'll he'll bring them to it amen and so they he said don't fuss with them don't fuss with no one don't fuss with no one but just love them right into it see the Bible says the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winth Souls is wise when the time comes you want that last breath to be real you want it to do something you want to be in a condition that you're ready to go but the brandom tells us that man-made theories will not stand when you're coming down to the last breath of this body I want you to think about it man-made theories will not stand when you come down to the last breath of this body this life he said it's good to live by those things but you can't die by them yeah he said I guess for my age in the ministry I probably stood by as many dying people as anyone of my age because I've been much called on to the dying and he talks about these two young ladies you've heard the story but he talked about the two young ladies and one of them was from his church and one of them was went to a liberal church that didn't teach the Holy Ghost and things like that and and the pastor told her she was going to heaven because she was a Sunday school teacher and he talked about this woman as she come to the hour of her death something had happened it was a a veneral disease it was it was because of the life that she lived and and the pastor was there and he stepped outside to smoke out of in the hall and when death struck the girls she began to get hysteric and she said listen she didn't call for a pastor she said where is that girl yes right they said what girl she said here's all of your class she said I'm not talking about them I'm talking about that girl called her name that's from up there at the Tabernacle that used to speak to me about my soul yeah said go get her y they went to the pastor and he'd come running in he said now honey listen said we'll call the doctor give you a shot you're getting a little Hyster she said I'm not hysterical she said you deceiver of men I'm lost and going to hell because you taught me that and the girl died and went out to meet God lost crying for the girl that had tried to tell her what was right oh God yeah see you can't do anything about when your last breath is but you can do something about where your next breath is Sir listen you can't do nothing about when you can do something about where yeah that's right if the next breath is your last breath and you are God's if I could say it that way you're filled you're sealed by the Holy Spirit Paul tells about you he says behold I show you a mystery go to that next that next scripture behold I I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed yes in a moment in the twinkling of an eye yes sir just gone yeah God you you you can figure out all the fancy theories you want to that's about when the Rapture happens what's going to happen that's right but I want to be ready amen yes so that so that if it happens that quickly I'm just ready to go yeah yeah he said up the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead should be I was waiting for something to happen yeah all you did was breathe that's right the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed yes for this corruptible must love that it's a fate accompl it's it has to happen yeah this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on him yes sir so when this corruptible shall be put on have put on incorruption Amen and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen oh death where is thy steam oh grave where is thy Victory Paul is sitting in Chains about to get me headed and he cries out and says death I'm going to challenge you I'm going to challenge you where is your Victory where is your sting brother brandom told us how that the bee buzzed there at Calvary and when it stung that body of the Son of God it couldn't sting anymore yeah the fear of death was gone and so Paul said oh death where you at death yeah you got no sting yeah we think we got to tiptoe around it well we got to be careful got to be careful we're afraid we're afraid that we might something might happen no don't be afraid don't live your life like that where's your sting death yeah grave where is your victory yeah now oh you may put me in the grave but I'm coming up yes amen yes sir oh my can can we take just a few more minutes brother Brandon was dreaming one time he was laying in his bed he was dreaming he had several dreams that he tells about there and he raised up and sat against the headboard this is from that same sermon where brother brother brandom talks about uh a rejected King the rejected King and he tells this story and he he'd been he'd been dreaming he raised up and he was thinking about half of his appointed time he said at least half was gone because he was 50 years old yeah and so he was sitting there and he said I looked and I heard something kept saying you're just starting praise God see the opening of the seals the opening of the word all those things be we're we're coming right right all those great things that we look at now as the as the capping Stone of his ministry the Pentecostals thought he was washed up that's right we look at that as the Capstone of his ministry he said he said you're just starting press the battle yes sir amen just keep pressing and there it come again said just keep pressing oh my if you only knew what was at the end of the road that's it and you'll see that I'm skipping some of these paragraphs as I'm going down to save time but you just hang with me today you go back and read it for yourself but he said I heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain well I'm so glad he showed a prophet behind the curtain now he was sitting there and he talks about how he that song beyond the curtain of time was in his mind he was thinking about it he said I could like I could hear him sing it but the gr snailing he said I could hear him sing it and here he's thinking about it and and they the voice said would you like to see just beyond the curtain yes sir I said it would help me so much amen and I looked in just a moment I don't know what this means to you church but I believe this amen I believe this if I didn't believe it I'd give up right now and quit preaching yeah but I believe this really happened yes sir yes and I looked in just a moment he said one breath had come in now notice it he said I in one breath one breath yeah he's thinking about these things and he breathe he breathed out yep he said and in one breath I'd come into a little place slanted he said I looked back and there I was laying on the bed yes sir and I said this is a strange thing oh God and he was showing him something that would be by the way yes and you realize when brother brandham died in a car wreck yeah you remember he at some point point he is in the car wreck and he was in the hospital and at some point after about a week or two weeks whatever that it was he at some point he's in there and he goes that's it no more breathing they said he's gone yes sir but when he took his next breath yeah he was back yeah yes sir hey like to feel sorry for people that pass away that's right just think about it and I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother amen I stopped and I looked and I was young I looked back at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and and you remember this is the place because Jesus and read in a minute Jesus wasn't there but there will come a time when when he'll come back with him and they'll meet us in the air and and and again I'm not going to explain all of that this morning it's not the purpose of this sermon even if I could explain it but you understand that that the Saints the dead in Christ rise first well this is where they come from that's right right is where he went yeah that's why I say he went back yeah right and when we go into rapture we go into that Dimension until the into of the marriage supper and and we come back here right yeah amen with them now look now he he said they said our precious brother here come young men in the Brilliance of Young Manhood and their eyes glistening and look like stars on a darken night their teeth as white as Pearl they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother you think they weren't emotional that's it oh you think it didn't mean something yeah just to see their Prophet standing there how much more when we see Jesus are you with me now it'll me so much to see our Prophet to see our loved ones yeah when when the loved ones begin to appear to us however that happens when we begin to see that that'll mean so much but what about when we see him yes glory to God brother BR said he knew that we'd want to see them first so we see them first but then we see him one of these days we're going to see him yeah oh after all this life is over and our burdens here are lifted We Stand upon a mountain top top so tall amen when it's all done and over and the battles are behind us we're going to see him who our soul loves yes but these people were so excited to see brother brandham there oh our precious brother I stopped and I looked and I was young I looked at my old body laying there with my hands behind my head I said I don't understand this these young women throwing their arms around me he said men cannot put your arm around women without a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday today nor tomorrow yeah talking brother George earlier and and he told me that that your son-in-law would be at church tomorrow I said well we have church on Sunday that was on Friday he said well I've been on vacation I've lost track of time yeah oh when we get there amen there'll be no yesterday nor tomorrow yeah aren't you looking forward to that day yes amen they they he said they didn't get tired I never seen such pretty women in all my life they had hair way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just to hug me listen you're not giving up your beauty by giving up worldly things that's right yes sir he said that was the prettiest women I ever saw yeah that's right yeah and you think well if I give up my makeup if I give up my my my short hair if I quit going to the petition I I lose my beauty no he said these were beautiful women God has a way to restore you to what you ought to be

women in all my life they had their hair way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet they were just a hug of me it wasn't a hug like even my own sister he said would hug me it was something I've not got the vocabulary he said I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something he said I never you just have to be there yes and he said I heard I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here amen without it yes he said I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness I know some of y'all are tired this morning but there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never in there mortality could never make you old they could not cry yeah oh God I'll be glad for that day cuz I cry a lot I I tend to cry I cry at people's funerals I don't even know it' make it difficult for me to work at a funeral home because it just it's difficult for me I I I tend to empathize in that way but there will come a day I'll never cry another tear yes Oh my he said it was one Joy said oh my precious brother and they took me up and set me on a great big high place I thought I am not dreaming I'm looking back on my body laying down there on the bed and they set me up there and I said oh I shouldn't sit up here Oh my he said and then that voice that was speaking from above me he said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said yes I remember that in the scriptures he said well this is when you will gather with your people I said then they'll be real and I can feel them he said oh yes yes yes Glory Glory I said but there's Millions amen there not that many brandom and that voice said they're not brandom there means your converts yes that's the ones you've led to the Lord yeah you know I I've been led to the Lord by this the message of the hour that's right amen by the message that William Brandon preached and I all of us could say that because he was the messenger to the age that's right I don't believe that we each Pastor will have our own individual group we may we'll know who each other are and I'll be judged for what I preached to you but I'm as long as I stay under that message of message of the age I go in under that promise so how important it is for me to say what he said amen right not what he said plus what somebody else said but say what he said because if I say what he said then that's and understand that what him being a word prophit that he was scriptural right and that takes me back to the Bible then I can preach the Bible like we did this morning and I'm preaching the message of the hour yes right now look he said then he said you know it's written that prophet gather with the people he said yes I remember that in the scripture he said well this is when you will gather with your people they'll be real I can feel them I said but there's Millions there's not that many brandom Bo said they're not brandom them is your converts they're the ones that you've led to the Lord I said some of them women there that you he said some of them women there that you think is so beautiful were better than 90 years old sister Fritz I don't mean to pick on you this morning but I don't remember what you look like I've seen a few pictures of when you were younger but I don't remember what you look like one day I'm going to know we were both the same message we're going to be gathered in the same group yes you understand and be gathered and and and and there's a lot to that I understand that but we I believe that I believe we'll know each other we're the Overcomers of the L ofan age yes sir that's right yes sir but the Brandon was an overcomer of the lat of c and age too he had come in be born by the same blood that we are yeah he was an overcomer of the lat of c and AG yeah but he went on he waved the flag dust said come on it can be done there's some sons of God on the Earth again he didn't die to promote his own Ministry he didn't live his life to promote his own Ministry but he said there's more coming yeah are you with me now there's more coming I he can say I was a sinner saved by grace and I come to a place amen where the Holy Spirit could speak through my life listen to me he wasn't the only one the third pole was not just for brother Brandon but it was for the ones that could speak the word and say it's nothing but the truth hallelujah come on now that's right yes you didn't know this was a Rapture sermon did you Oh my he said some of them women were better than 90 years old when they went into the Lord and sorry I can't read it back there I have to look down here I just want to preach it so bad but I want to I want to tell you what he said and he said they're better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious brother and they screamed all at once if you haven't went hadn't went we wouldn't be here and I looked around and I thought well I don't get it I said oh where is Jesus I want to see him so bad he said now he just a little higher right up that way he said someday he will come to you he said you were set for a leader and God will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not y we'll go in according to your teaching yes sir and look where brother Brandon plac I love this yeah he did not go back and say well the supernal come to me I saw an angel and I taught what the angel said teach come on come on come on think about it he did not come and say well well I I was anointed I saw Visions I was a prophet yeah yeah that's what he said right right he said I'm so glad what a relief I'll be judged on my teaching I'm so glad amen he said does Paul have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this yes oh my I said then I preached every word that they preach every word that they preach I never from it one side to the other where they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too where they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they taught I did too don't you realize the importance of staying with that word if a prophet didn't go back to his own Supernatural experience but he went back to the word and said I taught what Peter taught I taught what Paul taught yeah oh my what it ought to do to us today I can come under that same message today and say I taught what a prophet taught I taught what Paul taught I taught what Peter taught I taught what was in the scripture and I can't let nobody take me off of those grounds much as I might love somebody what their last name might be what their first name might be if they were in my own family or somebody like that I cannot move myself from what a prophet taught thank amen can't do it because if I do that I won't come in under that blessing I have to be judged separately yes yeah you be judged according to the word that you preached amen oh Hallelujah come on and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be yes yes amen he said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry yes sir I don't again I don't understand that I know I know he has presented us to him in the word in word form I know that will there be a literal time when he introduces us to Christ personally I don't know there may be but I do know we have been introduced to Christ by the word that's already taken place this message introduced us to Christ he said now he said you will guide us to him all together you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever I said do I have to return back now yes but keep pressing on yes oh my I looked and I could see the people just as far as I could see still coming wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother just in a voice said all that you ever love and all that ever loved you God has given you here and I looked in here come my old dog come walking up here come my horse laid his hand upon my shoulder and nickered now look I'm in the group that was under his teaching yes right but now here's something that he says well all that you ever loved and all that you ever loved you and he showed him his horse and his dog and laid up his head upon his shoulder and nickered said all that you ever Lov and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hand through your ministry and I felt myself moved from that beautiful place oh my yes and I thought oh god oh help me oh God never let me compromise with one word yes but it's not important it's not important how you do communion it's not important whether or not you have church a certain way not important if I deviate one word from what Paul taught from what brother brandom taught yes you realize that's good I can't compromise with that amen he couldn't compromise with that he said never let me compromise with one word let me stay right straight on that word and preach it and preach it he said I don't care what comes or goes what anybody does how many sa sons of Kish rise how many this that of the other let me Lord press to that place how many of you can say Amen to that today I've been born into the kingdom of God let me press to that place I don't want to lay down now I don't want to stop running now I don't want to stop preaching now I don't want to give half my breath now but if this is my final breath that I ever have in my body if what I have in me is in my lungs now if that's my last breath let me preach with all of my might let me witness to some soul let me love my neighbor let me love the people of God let me worship him with all of my heart if this is the last breath let it not be of recrimination and and hatred and dishonesty but let it be the truth of God whatever things are pure and honest and lovely let it be that amen amen he said I say this with my Bible before me this morning I got a little boy four years old to be raised I got a nine-year-old girl a teenager I'm thankful for let's turn the way of the Lord God let me live to bring them up in the admonition of God but see even brother brandom as a prophet couldn't extend his days he couldn't do it God took him off the earth when he wanted to said what was a car wreck he has app pointed bounds that I cannot pass he said above that the whole world seemed to scream to me 90-year-old women and men and all kinds if you hadn't have went we wouldn't have been here and God let me press the battle but if it comes to dying I'm not morose it would be a joy it would be a pleasure to enter from this corruption and disgrace yes if I he said if I could make up yonder 100 billion miles high a square block and that's perfect love each step this way it Narrows until we get down to where we are now it would be just merily a shadow of corruption listen can you feel the presence of God in church I trust that you can you feel the Pres here this morning and and in different times you'll feel the presence of God you sense it moving y look you you at home in your prayer life you feel that little flutter you're driving down the road listening to a tape or listening to music or or or hearing some preach whatever that it is you're you're driving down the road and you feel that little flutter you sense it brother brand said that little something that we can sense and feel that there is something somewhere we don't even know what it is he said oh my precious friends my beloved my friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your Pastor he said I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath Brother Sam just beyond it yes just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing there is no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside everything else do you get perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else right said that one visit there to me has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother brandom that I was whether the PLS are rocking whether the lightning is flashing whether the Spy has a gun on me whatever it is it doesn't matter I'm going to press the paddle by the grace of God I preach that gospel to every creature and every person that I can persuading them to that beautiful land Yonder it may seem hard it may take a lot of strength oh this gives you courage today you can get a glimpse you can stand on a prophet's shoulders this morning and get a little glimpse of What It's Like on on the other side and it makes you want to press the battle makes you want to preach the gospel don't quit now now's not the time to give up Now's the Time to press this is the last baton this is the last hour this is the final day this is the final voice to the final age yes he said she under her Messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's us yes the prophet stood there and said she is him yes oh Hallelujah heyen it may seem hard it may take a lot of strength I don't know how much longer I'm sorry I know I've held you way long this morning but I got to finish this and I'm almost done he said I don't know how much longer we don't know physically speaking we don't know he said but oh that wasn't it he talked about how that he he was reassured by the doctor he was in good shape he said but oh that wasn't it that isn't it it's something within here this corruption he quotes Paul got to put on incorruption yes this Mortal has got to put on immortality yes musicians go ahead and come I many of you have been there for someone's Last Breath yes but did you ever think about their next breath I've as as a minister you end up with George in two more death rooms than you want to be in I remember I had pastored that little church at branville and it one of the hardest things I ever did was go watch a man sit with a man who was struggling with cancer brother HL gay was struggling with cancer right after my dad my own father passed away and I sat there in the room with my dad and and you know you can't those emotions are going to get to you you can't help it I had cried and the day before he I think it was a day before two days before right before he slipped into unconsciousness he had told us that he was sorry for some things and dad was a hard man I spent the last few minutes of his life I'm just trying to be real this morning church just just bear with me thinking about the times and the breasts that we' used with one another we spent hundreds of hours arguing with each other hundreds and I at that moment I I sit there and thought what does it all matter I wish I'd have just given in sometimes not to not to believe anything wrong or do anything wrong but just let him have his say what did it matter was there in know in a moment that was real and I got thinking about that I wasted way too many days and hours and since that time I've thought about that a lot and I thought Lord I don't know but but sometime before that and I've told you before I had an experience with the Lord and He allowed me to really forgive my dad really let some things go and there at the end I forg forgave him before he ever apologized to me but he apologized it meant so much to me but I'll never forget laying there or or sitting there beside his bed kneeling beside his bed and he's struggling to breathe and at that moment I I felt guilty for thinking it but my only thought was just go just go you're hurting too bad there's too much pain and I thought I felt guilty for thinking that and I'm standing there and or or kneeling there and and I had a hold of his hand and my brother Samuel was there my brother Jonathan had not made it in yet and the younger kids were in the other room my sisters are here this morning were not very old and I'm sorry for bringing this up this morning but it just meant so much to me here we're not very old when dad passed away but he was was in the they were in the other room in the waiting room family waiting room mom was with them Sam went to tell them that he was he looked like he was about to pass and I put my hand on his and he he kind of catch his breath you know they do and prob goes was [Music] it never exhaled he never took another breath this world I thought about that a lot we wasted so much breath arguing but I believe that the next breath that he took was in that place and he didn't do much to get himself there he's a hard man contrary had a lot of things that but he was my dad and I believe that he made it I believe he made things right with God and he made it he was a preacher all of my life but I believe at the very end he made things right with God being a preacher don't mean you're right with God by the way you want to be right with God get right with your family get right with your church get right with people around you you can't treat them evil and be right with God but I'll never forget that he his hands the movement stopped the pulse stopped everything stopped but I saw this but his next breath was amen all the pain of spending a year with bladder cancer was gone just like that yeah listen I don't know if you'll go by way of the Grave or going to Rapture but one day you'll take your last breath that's that's it there's no more you can't buy anymore yeah you you couldn't purchase it on the market that'll be it what did you do with your time yeah what did you do with your time but if he was there at your first breath yes amen if you you were God you might have made a lot of mistakes but he was there when you took that first breath into life he was there when you took your last one yes he was there all the way down through all the breasts in between yes he'll be there for your next breath yes go into a better place into another body one day we'll be just walking brother Joe I believe it's my generation I believe me and brother Joe's going to see it it's our generation we're going to see it by the steward we're going to be walking one day we're going to be walking like like you know walked with God one day you're going to be maybe at the bank where they I don't know I don't know if it'll be in church I kind of think probably not because it said to will be in the field I I don't know where it'll be I don't know how early you get to the bank but sometime in the morning maybe you'll be there at the bank you'll be sitting there and and and just sitting there doing your work and going over the books and things like that and you take a breath yes that's it but don't you want to be ready when that time comes what do you want your next breath to be you wanted to just be well this person I can't stand here he did me wrong is there's something in your heart you can say Lord I want to go home with you would you bow your heads with me this morning maybe there have been some conviction in your heart as there has been in mine this morning as I think about these things that think about my own father my relationship with him and and different things that you've been through I know I use that quite a bit because that's my own story but you know you you've got different family situations and things and you live in different places and and and you've had to deal with different things and you're sitting there and you're thinking here's a breath that I could have used differently here's a moment that I could have used differently but God knew he had it all in his hands but why don't you just talk to him today and say Lord would you forgive me would you just let me would you let me take the breath that you want me to take and not what anybody else says or does don't let that affect me Lord help me to preach the gospel help me to help me to do those things that are right you you that are not called to the ministry you're called to something you're called to be a preacher to your children you're called to be a a a standard in the world that you live in don't you want your next breath whether it's here whether it's over there what don't you don't have any guarantee of which place it'll be in but you know that if your next breath is your last one you'll be over there would you just would you just talk to him like that and say Lord help me not to waste my breath help me to redeem my time I don't have only so many you've appointed bounds that I can't pass help me to redeem the time forgive me Lord forgive me where I've wasted One Moment In
