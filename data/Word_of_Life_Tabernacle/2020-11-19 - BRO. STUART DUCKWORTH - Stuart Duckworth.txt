coming up amen take advantage of every opportunity that we have because we don't know when those things could be taken from us is that right amen we're not trying to preach fear or nothing tonight I'm just trying to encourage you tonight amen the Bible says forsake not the assembling of ourselves amen but even the more so as we see the day approaching amen just thankful tonight that we can come that we can come to church and just get some encouragement amen from the word of God Amen if we could we'll just read in Ecclesiastes the third chapter in the first verse amen do you love the Lord tonight amen just a lot of need a lot of needs among usen a lot of people under the weather and we just pray that God will come by their way amen and touch them amen Ecclesiastes 3:1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen may the Lord bless the reading of the word and you can be seated this evening if you go on in that chapter it says there's a time to to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to harvest and so every to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose that God would have under heaven and we know that tonight he's in control of of everything you know there there's no there's no one greater than our God is that right amen he's got times he's got Seasons amen and he's in control of everything amen a time to be born a Time to die a time to plant a time to harvest and with just the understanding that it's time for this world to die and pass away it can't sustain itself forever but it's got to come to a time at just as it there was a time that it was come into existence and and God formed the Earth but it's got to die this this world as we know it this Cosmos has got to come to a point to where it's dead it's got to pass away amen a time to plant a time to harvest we we understand that we're not in a planning time but we're in the Harvest Time you know the planning time is behind us but we we've come to the Harvest Time and that that's the time that you and I live in the time in the day that we live in am mean it's it's time for a body change and a Rapture amen the the things have been spoken about it certain scriptures prophets different ones prophesied of it amen but now is the time for those things to be fulfilled you go on in that chapter in Ecclesiastes says he makes all things beautiful in his time amen do you believe that tonight that that God's got it all in control that that he knows a certain times amen for for something to be fulfilled and in his own time he'll manifest he'll make he'll make that beautiful he'll make you and I beautiful in his time in his time he'll bring to pass his desire for his people the scripture says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you expected and so God God knows the beginning and he knows the end and he the thoughts that he has towards you and I are are not of trouble and confusion but of peace to give us an expected end to to what his word has said amen he's going to bring us to that place amen aren't you thankful that that's your destination tonight amen that it's not in the in the destination of this whole world Amen and the evil that's come upon it but God's got an expected end for you and I hallelujah amen and just that thought that just the thought of seasons and the the unchanging God and we just went through a beautiful time of of fall and I certainly enjoy this time amen but it seemed like it just passed by so quick and the leaves just fell off the trees and and I noticed and Allison pointed it out to me just two or three weeks ago we we had a tree in our yard that had lost all of its leaves but just one and that tree just just to think of it just just to think of the seasons and how that everything nature reveals God and it reveals the things of life and everything testifies of Jesus Christ everything if if you begin to really look at at every scripture everything testifies of him but to but to look at that tree just struggling to hang on just for a little bit just just that little bit of life it was struggling just to hang on but now we see that this season the fall that we enjoy it's almost come and gone and now everything's in in a dead state or going to that place and the life is going back to the roots and everything everything testifying of God testifying of of the resurrection and I certainly love I love the fall time because I like a deer hunt I I just love being out in the woods and being able to enjoy those things but there's something about the springtime there's something about that new life that comes forth and how it testifies of the Resurrection am mean there there's just something amen about that and God just through everything is revealed in seasons in the seasons and the natural seasons and we would look at it that God even in the seasons of Our Lives that God has revealed amen through through the times of life through the times of growth amen through the times of of of of Amen going into the winter time and we all have seasons that we go through but just to think that God is revealed in the seasons of life and we know that changes will come throughout our time here upon Earth amen many changes will come nothing will ever just stay the same though we would like it to be that way and to stay that way and me changes constantly come changes constantly happen amen it'll be that way as long as we're here on Earth amen things will change but God I I I just take encouragement from this that God has said in his word that I am God and I change not so there will be Seasons there will be seasons where things change and things come and things go but God himself Remains the Same and he changes not aren't you thankful for that tonight his word remains true no matter how long time goes on or or what changes take place and in his own time he makes his own purpose come to pass Amen in his own time amen a amen and no l no no matter how long it would take God's word remains true amen God's word will never change it will never falter amen but it means what it says and it says what it means through all the changes his word Remains the Same his word remains true things change people come and go amen but no matter what comes and go our God Remains the Same through the ups and downs through the hills and Through The Valleys through the seasons and changes of life amen through the good times and the bad through the sickness and the trials and the discouragements of Life whatever present condition or or season of life you're in here tonight God remains God Amen through it all through it all God remains God he remains faithful and true aren't you thankful for that Lord help me to keep my voice so we see that that God remains God that there's seasons and things change but he Remains the Same so if that describes him and his character let me be like that may my character be just like his is that's good for the Bible says as he is so are we as he was in This World In His walks so are we Romans 12:2 says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that word conform means to Fashion oneself according to to conform oneself one's mind and character to to another's pattern fashion oneself to shape one thing like another describes what is transitory changeable and unstable so we don't want to conform as the scripture says to this world be not conformed to the fast to what someone else thinks to what this church does and if they decide to go off on a certain path away from the world don't conform yourself to that is that right Amen to another's pattern to what somebody else and we we sometimes a lot of times we we we worry so much about what other people think amen but we ought to worry about what God thinks about what God's word has said about us amen and fashion oursel towards that be not conformed to this world don't find yourself in a place where you're you're changeable where you're unstable be but be ye transformed not conformed but transformed by the renewing of your mind and we as the bride have a responsibility to stay with the word in a time when everyone else is conforming to this world Amen I believe we have a responsibility to stay with the spirit of God Amen to hold the standard of the word to hold the standard in the morals and our convictions of the word of God and the things that we've been taught amen amen to hold the standard as Sons and Daughters of God Amen because the spirit in the church brother says in the spirit and the prophet and the bride are all saying the same thing amen we've got to stay true to that we have a responsibility not to get away from the word but to stay with the word come on and then we've got a responsibility we've got a calling we've got to not only be like the word but we have to become the word many people will will reflect certain parts and they can fulfill certain parts and and they can can seem to seem to walk so far with it but the goal is not just to be like the word but to become the word for Jesus was the word he was the the word made flesh what what had been spoken amen what had been portrayed and it's it's okay to go along with that for a while and no doubt we're all going along with it but we've got to become the word just as Jesus was the word must become flesh and you and I amen not just to be like the word not to be like a Christian but to be a Christian to be like Christ to become the word to become him because the bride is just as he is amen I don't want to be conformed to this world or its ways or someone else's image or way of thinking amen because the time that we live in that which is right has become wrong and that which is wrong has become right you've got to be able to to think for yourself amen You' got to have something Amen to attain to amen or you you you'll just walk in this life and just just accept what somebody body else says but you got to get it for yourself you've got to catch a vision of what the word has said and and conform your life transform your life your life to be formed to that amen I don't want to be conformed to this hor but I want to be con I want to be formed to Christ the word word to be shaped into His Image Amen to be transformed into whatever the word says I can be because someone and and I want I want you to preach with me tonight amen someone is going to be the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen come on somebody amen someone is going to live in Victory amen someone's going to live above the things of this world Amen someone is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and me someone is going to be what the word says they can be amen and friends I believe tonight what God has shown us is the truth hallelujah amen what God has shown us is the truth of the hour amen God isn't going to take it back because things get difficult or because things get hard amen or someone talks bad about amen what we've received someone scoffs at it amen there's not another message to come amen what we have received is the truth and we've got to believe it we've got to accept it we've got to give our entire lives to it and rest in what he has said for our day amen hallelujah amen do you believe that tonight amen God Amen Jesus said will I find faith when I return amen he's looking for someone that will take him at his word amen someone that's willing to stay with the word regardless of how bad things get of how hard and difficult things get Amen in a time when things are changing constantly amen changing all the time it'll go this direction for a little bit and then it'll go back that direction for a little bit things are constantly changing everything but God Remains the Same God remains faithful and true tonight he's looking for someone that'll take a stand in the end time someone that'll take a stand of Faith am me someone that'll stand there and be unchangeable amen someone that'll stand there and be unmovable unshakeable amen with faith unwavering amen and you think of the of the three Hebrew children amen walking into that into that fire amen they were unchangeable amen they were unmovable they were unshakable they were certain of God that he would meet them in the fire amen and I'm certain tonight amen that no matter what we go through amen no matter what this next year faces or or or so on that God will be with us that God will meet us in the fire amen no matter what Le de see could throw our way that God will meet us every step of the way amen let us walk with a faith unwavering Amen brother random says here and God sets a time and has a purpose for everything that he does there is nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the Lord and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie and he said that was so that everything has its time its season and it has its way and God is behind every move and sometimes you think everything is going wrong it's up to us he said those things are put Upon Us trials and wonderings it's testings to see how we will react on an action don't you love that 1 Peter 1 16 and 7 wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of God told that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found under the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so everything that we go through all the unexpected things of life amen amen is for a reason amen it's for a reason the trial of your faith amen that God might get Glory from our lives and then that God might receive all the glory and all the praise and all the honor Wonder amen at is appearing we certainly live in a trying time a time when the whole earth is being tried amen it's like a trying time over the the entire Earth and it seems like when one trial ends there's another one not far down the road and you know whether you're a Christian or a sinner you'll have hardships in this life but I'd rather go through it the trials of life with God's help and believing his word amen I'd rather go through it that way than trying to navigate everything on my own amen trying to figure it out for myself amen amen but I want to live a life amen as a Christian amen a life of trusting and believing that God will see me through amen I say tonight that worry has no virtue your doubt has no virtue amen but there's virtue tonight and strength we can draw by having faith and being certain of God Amen being certain that he'll see us through amen amen if I had to depend upon myself amen I'd be in a bad spot if we all had to depend upon oursel we'd be in a bad way amen but we've got someone we can lean upon amen we've got someone greater than ourselves and Sons and Daughters of God brother BR said God we were designed to depend upon God Amen not to try to figure out ourselves or try to try to try to get ourselves through it but to depend upon Him amen for casting all your cares on him for he cares for you amen he wants to lead you he wants to guide you amen we all we all get overwhelmed and beat down from this life at some point and me we all get tired we all get tired of the journey you know our our feet get get dirty amen we go through things in life amen we all get beat down we get drugged through it amen it seems like why why am I having to go through this amen but it's for his glory it's for his praise and it's for his honor amen we all get overwhelmed and Psalm 61 and one says Hear My Cry God and attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is over overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been my shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy Wings say and I say tonight lead me to the Rock Amen when I'm overwhelmed amen when things are changing constantly amen when you go through a rough patch amen Lead Me amen Lead Me To The Rock when things seem so uncertain amen we've got to be certain amen that God is leading us to a place amen above our own thinking he's leading us to a Rock Amen that is higher than than ourselves Amen to a place of Shelter From The Storm amen hide me hide me oh Rock of Ages I say to our friends don't be consumed with this world the LI this life because it's troubles amen because it's all going to perish one day amen but under his his wings brother and under his wings will the church abide Amen to rise above the judgments and the things of this world drop my lid there you love the Lord tonight amen we all go through things we all get overwhelmed Peter said the trial is more precious than gold and God God wants to see our our reaction to every action God God wants to see what we will do he wants to see your reaction when you're pressed amen when you're squeezed anden he wants a man he wants someone that'll put him first someone that'll that'll put his trust in him that he'll lead you and that he'll guide you he wants someone amen that'll put God first amen amen for this world is going to pass away and the riches and the things of this life will perish everything that you could ever attain in this life won't mean nothing it won't mean nothing because one day it's going to be ashes one day it's going to be no more and in this life that we live the troubles that we have the things that we try to attain one day it's going to be no more and brother Brenham says here he says many times the troubles strike our home he says it's blessings and disguisable you're sick just because you're not right with God that doesn't mean that job was was right with God and he was sick but it's God testing you putting you to a test to see what you'll do maybe he let the doctor say that for a purpose to see what you do we're nearing the coming of the Lord God's coming for a church he never asked the question will I have a church will I have righteousness but here was the question Jesus asked will I find faith when I come God putting you to a test and try your faith 1 Peter 4:12 said beloved think it not Str strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing that happened to you amen and we all Wonder take a breath here we all wonder you know why am I going through this we all had those thoughts as humans why why am I going through this am mean and Peter said think it not strange concerning this fiery trial as some strange thing that happened to you we all as humans we question that amen though though we're filled with the Holy Ghost not that it's really a doubt but we question why why am I going through this why why why is it lingering this long why am I dealing with this for so long and it it seems to linger and linger but God God is trying to get a reaction from you and I because that fiery trial is for our good amen to everything there's a season a time and a purpose purpose you know what some it seems that some people deal with sickness a lot more than others and some some don't ever hardly get sick but they go they go through things they still go through things as much and they they deal with trouble and afflictions of this life but it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial Come Peter said thinking not strange When Trials come upon you fiery trials it's better to you than gold it's done to prove you all that Refiner's Fire that it'll come out 100% all the draw smelted out all the unbelief see God's got a purpose an experience then that you know what the Hebrew children could testify after they went through the fire that God is a savior from the fire and they knew it amen it's to bring you out amen as you go through the fiery trial is to bring you out for better on the other side it's to help you it's to bring you along that you can be more certain amen that you can look back and you can see what you've been through you can look back and you can testify what you've been through and know and you can be certain that God is a savior that God is an on time God amen amen they could look back and they knew it amen life isn't supposed to be easy we all have hardships but it's what you do with what life life has dealt you and it's completely up to you it's completely up to you and I of what is thrown our way and how we deal with it we don't choose I read this today we don't choose to be victims but we can choose not to be one so a lot of times you can't help things that come your way but you can choose you can make the choice to not be a victim even though you were a victim you can choose you can make the decision to not to continue to be that way to have that mindset we can't control what what Life deals us sometimes you can't but you can't let it control you you can let it control you or you can take that flaw or that weakness that we all have in some form because of humanity and let God get the glory from your life and when we' got to give it to God anden we've got to yield ourselves to him I thought this was good I heard this in a sermon a few weeks back speaking to Fanny Crosby Fanny Crosby was blind but she wrote some of the greatest Christian songs near The Cross Blessed Assurance I shall know him blind Fanny Crosby but she came to a point in her life when she said if I had a choice I would still choose to remain blind for when I die the first face I will ever see will be the face of my blessed savior so it's it's what you it's what you do with it it's what you do with the flaw or the weakness that you had no control over on Amen you can let it control you or you can control it amen you can let God get the glory from it or you can let it beat you down your entire life am mean you can give it to God and let God Amen what he's really trying to do amen is glorify himself and everything God wants the glory amen amen much Affliction many are the afflictions of the righteous the Bible says but the Lord deliver them out of them all Hallelujah you believe that tonight amen we all we all go through sickness we all go through Affliction amen but the Bible says that bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all iniquities and health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with goodness so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the Lord executeth righteous and send judgment for all that are pressed amen he's still the Healer tonight amen he's still the deliverer from Affliction amen he still Our Redeemer here tonight Lord amen amen do you love the Lord I don't know when I started preaching I try not to hold y'all too much longer my voice is fading fastly quickly I don't think fastly is a word is it quickly quickly is a word you love the Lord tonight I tried to get brother Allan to preach and ask brother Ben if he was preaching I couldn't trick none of them into thinking that they were preaching Romans 8:28 and we know that all things I love this this these verses here and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified they me also glorified I love that I love that and I read this quote I think maybe the last time I preached but it still just sticks out to me just bear with me as I read this because I think it's very very we can apply it very much to to where we are right now brother renom says here I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the big fours and the UN and whoever never even mention God's name I'd be a discouraged person but I'm not looking for that outcome I look down in the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it and that's all so the only thing for me to do is not line up with them but line up with Calvary line up with God line up with his word stay in his word and no matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way it's going to be the way God intends it to be it can't be nothing else for him being infinite know the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his Praises that's right Hallelujah all things have to work together everything will shape right up to its place M if that wouldn't make the courage in a Christian nothing can go wrong after all it's not our battle it's his it's not our wisdom it's his the only one thing that we had to do is put our faith and trust there and set still and see the glory of God and see how it moves around to its place every every will moving it may be scattered from side to side but it'll move right into its place when God speaks the word aren't you thankful tonight that you know what you know to see what you have what you've seen and the understanding that you have in the end time am me we know that this nation has rejected God we know that the politics of this world are corrupt amen that we know that it's controlled by Satan amen but I say tonight as brother B said our our outcome isn't controlled by that amen our outcome isn't controlled by by the politics of this nation amen but I know one tonight that's got it all in control I know one tonight amen in the dark times amen I know a man that can turn on the light amen and he can make the Rapture take place he said for in a time of trouble he'll hide in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle He Shall Set me upon a rock the only thing for us to do is to line up with Calvary amen die out to myself amen die out to my own thinking and let him come in and live in me let him come in amen not my wisdom but his not my understanding but his amen and line up with God and His word stay in his word amen stay so filled up with him am man get to a place where you ain't got to come to church get filled up you just stay filled up amen you're not tossed about amen with every wind and wave amen but you're filled with God Amen you stay so filled up with him amen he'll lead you he'll guide you amen that's what he's here for he's a God Amen when we get lost and when we can't figure it out he's our God amen amen we're not depending upon anyone but he is here amen he is in the midst of his people amen and no matter how bad things look it's going to be the way God intends it to be he fornew us he elected us take courage tonight take courage tonight in the election and calling of God and what God has shown you in this thing amen he's the author and the finish of your faith amen he's begun a good work in you and he'll perform it as the scripture says until the day of Jesus Christ amen he will perform it amen that means he's taking that responsibility upon himself he's left it to no man but he's taken it upon himself working all things for our good and me he has a purpose and everything will shape right up to its place amen amen when he speaks mountains move amen the waters apart amen the fire is quenched amen sickness has to flee amen I pray for our elderly people the ones that continually deal with sickness amen May the spirit of God go forth tonight amen and touch our brother and sisters amen touch our brothers and sisters raise them up amen through this time of sickness amen amen he's here tonight those that are bound to set them free amen amen because at Calvary he said it's finished amen lining ourselves up with Calvary amen we can have the testimony tonight that I am redeemed amen I can walk in this present world as a redeemed son or daughter of God God Amen no matter what I'm going through no matter what I'm facing no matter how tough it gets how sick it gets the redemption's price has been paid and I'm going to line myself up with Calvary amen I'm going to line myself up when he said it's finished amen and that work of redemption it's a finished work in you and I and mean we walk not as creatures as defeated creatures but as redeemed Sons and Daughters of God and I say tonight let the redeemed of the Lord say so amen what the word has said amen when God speaks amen Every Mountain will move every sickness has to flee that which is bound has to be set loose Lord amen amen do you love the Lord tonight amen we can we can confess not amen through Calvary that by his stripes I am healed amen brother brandham says here and I'll wind this down pretty pretty quickly here the people get scared what are you scared about those who he fornew he called and those who he is Justified called he
