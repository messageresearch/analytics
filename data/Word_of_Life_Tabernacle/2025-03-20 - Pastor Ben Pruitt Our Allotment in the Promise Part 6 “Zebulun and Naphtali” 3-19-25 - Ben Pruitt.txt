this service tonight with a need and a desire Lord you want to be worshiped and I pray God that we would do that tonight we would worship you in spirit and in truth we thank you for that we we love you we pray you take control of this service we ask now in Jesus name amen amen God bless you uh we're just glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight glad to be able to have church on a windy day day when there's fire in in the area but uh we're just believe in the fire of God will be here with us tonight good to see each and every one of our visitors Matthew chap 4: 12-16 we're going to continue on our series uh with uh continue on our series with the tribes of Israel uh tonight we going to take just a little bit different uh approach and and talk about zebulun and and and Nepal it says Matthew 4:12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and nepalm that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Sab and the land of nephelim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light I was identified with that scripture the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death amen they were in the shadow but the reality of the lights is sprung up amen God bless you you can have your seat tonight as we look at these tribes uh I I don't want you to get discouraged brother Wes it's so good to see you tonight God bless you thank you all for being here I don't want you to get discouraged by uh the things that we've read and the things that we've studied because many of the tribes didn't fulfill their purpose and and the prophecy that was was made over them of what they should do and what they should be many of them left things on the table they they didn't exactly do what God had told them to do and yet we realized that that was just a shadow of things to come that there would be a bride at the end time that would not leave anything any stone unturned would not leave any promise unfulfilled but there had to be you see Christ all of these things were fulfilled in Christ all of this was a shadow of Christ and he was the perfect one that come but as there was a perfect groom there would have to be a perfect bride it could not be perfect by our own Merit but we're perfected by the blood of the Lamb we've come through the doors we talked about Sunday morning and the welcome matter of the blood of Jesus Christ was was laid there for us and we went through the door into fellowship with God and and and since we are in fellowship with him we are going to fulfill all that he spoke about us I'm so glad for that and so we don't have to say well I wonder if I can do it no you can do it and we don't preach a gospel of Doom or Gloom or or maybe or ifs or questions we we preach a sure word of Prophecy random even told us he said that there's no negativity in the gospel at all he said it's all positive it's yay and amen Jesus said why is it that way because the bride is going to make it you're going to be there you're going to be there you say well brother brother man if you preach that people won't try we don't try because we're worried we might not make it we try because there's something in our heart we love him with all of our heart we're we're his wife we want to we want to do what he says to do good so these tribes maybe wouldn't fulfill all that they were called to do but somebody will and I believe that somebody is you and ien and so because he is the perfect fulfillment Paul says in Colossians 2:16 let no man someone say no man no man therefore judge you in meat right tell you well you know you shouldn't eat pork you shouldn't eat this shouldn't eat that he said let no man judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or the new moon or the Sabbath days which are a shadow a shadow someone say a shadow shadow a shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ brother brand says all the old things of the Old Testament was only a shadow of the new things that's a sermon right there someone could preach old things are a shadow of the new things to come those things happen back there to give us the for knowledge of what we might expect in this day so it happened to give us the forn knowledge of what we might expect if we serve the Lord and what we might expect if we do not serve the Lord yeah right he says and if if we serve him now look there is a way that we can serve him with our whole heart or half-heartedly so he said these things happen for a shadow to show us what we might expect if we do not serve the Lord and if we serve him half-heartedly or wholeheartedly I want to follow after him with my whole heart don't you I want to give him my all because if you serve him half-heartedly there there's actually you'll only fulfill so much of the promise but the bride will not be a leot to see and lukewarm powerless formal Church they will not be that but the bride will will give him their whole heart he will not have a wife at the end time that doesn't get I'm so glad for that I'm so glad for that promise today that we can f we can fulfill all the word of God up to up to the very fact of the change of our body we will there will be a bride standing on that day that said we not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye somebody's got to do it might as well be us he said these happens for a shadow to show us what would we might expect come on church I could preach there for a while but we don't have time on Wednesday night but we can expect certain things if we serve him wholeheartedly and other things if we serve him halfheartedly Paul said these things happen for an example now we know that that FY as we get into it tonight was the Second Son of BHA Rachel's servant and Genesis 30 and7 is where he was born in verse eight it says and Rachel said with great wrestling have I wrestled with my sister that's with Leah I have prevailed and she called his name neph remember there was a lot of tension in the home because Jacob had one too many wives and that'll always cause tension and nap means my wrestling now keep that in the back of your mind my wrestling this is the tribe that would be most closely associated with the Sea of Galilee if you look at a map I don't even think I brought a map tonight but if you look at a map of of Israel it's the one that's most closely associated with the Sea of Galilee listen to what Moses said about naal when he spoke about this tribe he said of Napal he said oh Napal satisfied with favor satisfied with favor and full with the blessing of the Lord and then he said possess thou the west and the South and if you go look at the original is possess the border of the lake of Galilee zebulun was Leah's youngest son or sixth son Leah in Genesis 30:19 conceived again and be Jacob the sick son and Leah said God hath endued me with a good dowy now will my husband dwell with me because I had born him six Sons she called his name zebulun which means habitation habitation or dwelling place so Jacob's blessing over zebulun had to do with their physical uh location in fact in Genesis 49:13 he said zebulun shall dwell at the Haven of the sea and he shall be for a Haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon and zebulun is actually landlocked by Ty and zidon on one side and Mediterranean Sea and by uh the tribe uh the other tribes on on on the other side towards the Sea of Galilee but they were a seafaring people they were fishermen and and so keep that in your mind as well now you'll find that all of the disciples come from the region of Galilee which would have been zebulun and NEP NEP except for one somebody know who the one is Judas Judas is the only one that doesn't isn't a Galilean so Jesus grew up in this region of the country and I I just I'm I I just think that's a simple explanation for why it's called the habitation of God cuz Jesus grew up there and lived there it was literally the habitation of God but now we look at Napal again and he said Napal is a hind let loose or deer dough let loose he giveth goodly words if you look at that it's a it's a deer released from bondage yeah to begin to produce goodly words or produce other translation actually says fawns and I'm building up to something tonight so don't go to sleep on me so in Luke chapter 4 and verse1 14 we find Jesus beginning uh his ministry and as he he starts in that region of the country it says Jesus returned in the power of the spirit this is after the Temptation the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all the region round about he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all he came to Nazareth which would have been in zebulun where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah when he'd opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your in your ears what was happening the shadow was becoming reality what the what the law could not do and that it was weak to the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh forcing condemned In the Flesh what was he doing he was bringing from a negative to a positive from a shadow to a reality and he was saying this is really I'm the Fulfillment of all the blessings given by Jacob to the 12 tribes I oh church I hope you're hearing me today he was the word he was all of it he said in the volume of the book it's written of me and so he stood up there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled the shadow become reality Galilee of the Gentiles which it was called that because it had so many cultural influences and different Gentiles people lived there Galilee of the Gentiles saw a great light and Jesus actually lives in that country we find he was born in Bethlehem but he grew up in Nazareth after leaving Egypt he went to Egypt for a while and come back to Nazareth leaving Nazareth he come and dwelt in capernium so he would go from zebulun to Napal which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of Zebulon and nepon you talk about blessed no wonder it said that the the favor of God was upon them yes why because Jesus when God come down in flesh he chose to live right there in their towns right there in their communities you realize how blessed we are in this hour and I've told you this before but it just right now it just comes to my heart how blessed we are to live in this area that we live in because when God came down in our age he come down and worked through a prophet's Ministry the man wasn't God but God came down and visited our day he said I he'll rise with healing in his wings and he did where did he come right into our area right right down in Jonesboro right where some of y'all live and he come right into our area and he preach the word of God and we're blessed by that church many of you are third and fourth generation fifth generation Believers because this area was visited by the power of God God's favor was upon them oh my but we find that though they had the Jesus as their next door neighbor yet they turned him down you imagine what that must have been like that Jesus actually lived down the street and when he went to the grocery store he would have rubbed shoulders with them they would have talked to him they would have but many of them didn't even recognize who he was they didn't even they couldn't even see pass the veil of the flesh they they knew that he was a local they knew he talked like them he acted like them and somehow that hid him from them they could not see who he was and they accepted his ministry for a while as long as he was in healing but when he begin to declare who he was and say this day this scripture is fulfilled they begin to reject him out of that area and in fact Jesus it gets so bad that Jesus in Matthew 11:23 says Thou caper capernium was maybe the greatest City in this area of zebulun and Napal which AR exalted unto Heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained to this day they have much to answer for I wonder church if we don't have much to answer for because of the favor that's been shown to us what have we done with it all right if we just turn it into squabbles and fighting and and fussing and and talking about people and running people down and and and fights between preachers and fights between churches and fights within churches that's not what he's wanting he didn't visit us so we could fight with one another he didn't visit us so we could remain in sin and and keep doing what we were doing he visited us so we would repent and come to him and spread this gospel that we've been given amen absolutely he visited us for a reason yes sir he always comes for a reason every time he comes in he comes for a reason oh I want to take advantage of it oh yeah I want in our services to take advantage of his visitation if he come he come for a reason if he's here tonight he's here for a reason I want to take advantage of that Lord if you're here there must be a reason if I don't have a need in my life maybe all I need to do is just worship you and lift my hands to you I don't want to P you to pass me by Lord in this situation I I don't want to just let you be the the guy at the market that I saw one day or the guy I know lives down the street I want you to know that you're here if you're here I want to be at your doorstep I want to I want to fellowship with you I want to entertain you yes as we heard the other night I I want to wash your feet yeah if he was in Simon's house he was there for a reason it was for that prostitute woman that was willing to see past all of the all of the things that was going on and had the time to make him welcome say let's make him welcome tonight what about you the fact that he came from Galilee was actually a stumbling block to the Jews it's like being from Hardy Walnut Ridge Roxy it was a stumbling block right because every time they said Jesus of Nazareth they like where where you remember the time that Jesus stood up at the feast in John chapter 7 he he stands there and say of any man thirst all right let him come to me and drink out of his belly will flow rivers of Living Water right and and many people when they heard that it says in John 7:40 of a truth this is the prophet yes others said this is the Christ but some said shall Christ come out of Galilee oh my well it's exactly the place he said his favor would be on it's exactly the place where he said it there will be a release from bondage and goodly words will come out yeah right exactly the place where he said that that that would happen and it happened exactly in the right place but they didn't see it because their Creeds kept them from it they were blinded to it it said ha not I wonder tonight church if there's things that our Creeds are our message creeds hav't kept us from recognizing his presence here in the end time that he's right here Among Us yes about it amen oh my many of the people said it was a prophet some said it was Christ they said shall Christ come out of Galilee hath not the scripture said look how they use the scripture yeah against Christ that Christ cometh of this of the seed of David they say he got to come out of Judah well he was of the seed of David right but he grew GRE up in a place that obscured his identity yeah Hallelujah it was God hiding himself in Simplicity listen Maybe you come from a background that was inauspicious maybe you come from a family that was broken maybe what did it do it obscured your identity it wasn't the real you really he was the lion of the tribe of Judah really was the lamb that would come but they didn't see it CU all they could see is the sin in Nazareth and many times all people can see is where you're from and your story and what you went through but that's not the whole story and I'm so glad for that tonight I'm glad brother the JT that there's more to the story than what my past was I'm glad there's more to the story than where I was from but I'm glad that I found out my real identity was in him amen hallelujah aren't you glad aren't you glad that brother Joe that your past is not who you really are yeah I'm glad of that some of them there was a division among the people because of him some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees they said unto them why have you not brought him the officers answered never man spake like this man and the Pharisees said are you also deceived are you a part of that cult we think this stuff is new it's not new all right huh everybody falls to Pieces cuz somebody writes an article or somebody puts something on the Internet that's what they did back then all right right they still defamed his name they still threw dirt on him but he was no less God he was still the same yesterday today he was still the the god of the universe wrapped in flesh true pH they said are you also in that cult are you also deceived if any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed on him so have any did this great preacher or that great preacher believe on him said but this people who knew not the law are cursed Nicodemus saith unto them he that come to Jesus by Night being one of them he said does our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth and they answered and said to him art thou also of Galilee that's all they could see yeah all right but if they can really see the scriptures this is what I want to get to you tonight if we could just see there was a meaning to that him being there he was supposed to be there that's supposed to be where he come from that's the region that was supposed to see a great light brother brandom tells us this he said there's nothing out of cater we get all confused and worried and and thinking all things are not happening the way they ought to they're happening exactly the way they're supposed to happen nothing out of cater there's a reason why the Rapture didn't take place in 1977 I wasn't even born yet all right brother Andrew wasn't even thought of yet there's a reason why it didn't take place in 1986 come on Church there's a reason why things didn't work out the way maybe we thought it would work out there's a reason why things happened the way they did and the way the reason why we're all here tonight even with the weather the way that it is there's got to be a reason for it God don't do nothing halfhazard he does what he does on purpose and he does it right on time then we might as well accept the fact that he is here he might have come out of Nazareth but he came he might have Come From Galilee but he came I'm so glad that he came and if he came here tonight let's look past all of the dirt and the dust and things and say Lord I accept the fact that you've come I accept your presence and I'm willing to worship you I'm willing to bow down before you hallelujah hallelujah amen John 752 said out of Galilee ariseth no prophet they said the prophet's supposed to come out of Judah he did but not the way they thought all right all of Jesus disciples were galileans as we said except Judas the galileans had a particular speech it's like a bur in their speech historians tell us it was it must have been something like a Scottish person would sound to us or maybe just the difference between hardy and West Plains you know do you know there's a language difference between hardy and West Plains there is just you cross into Arkansas and people get more Southern as soon as you crossed the line and uh some of y'all grew up in Colorado so you have a completely different way of speaking but it's just the area they were from and in having that different speech you know it must have sounded grading uh uneducated right right right remember it said these are galileans right they they're ignorant and unlearned I I looked that up one time and it's literally idiots they were calling them idiots they're just dumb right they're ignorant and unlearned they they don't they don't talk right but there was something about them that God that's who God chose now we find that in in Matthew 26 at Peter you remember the story of Peter and I'm moving fast through this you can go and study it later but you'll find that Peter one time was uh was there at a fire and Jesus had been taken into prison and he wanted to see what would happen with him but he didn't want him to know who he was cuz he was afraid he might get taken too and he was a bit of a coward yeah so the big Fisherman's warming his hands over the fire and and someone comes up to him and says aren't you a Galilean aren't you one of them and he said no man I'm not one of them whatever it is whatever their that failed miserably whatever their accent was I was trying I was riding one time with a translator in West Africa and we we're we're traveling in by car and the pastor didn't speak English at all and his son was trying to translate for me and and and he was have kept having to ask me and I said do you do you not understand English he said I do but not your kind he was taught The King's English but they come to Peter when he sat there and and in Matthew 2673 and after a while came unto him they that stood by when he denied him once twice three times and said to Peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech berth thee it betrays you but I love the fact that the Holy Ghost changes your speech amen all right now think about it for just a minute before Pentecost Peter had the same accent right he's from the same area but he's a coward and he's cussing come on I know no one here ever did that but he's he's cussed them out he's he's already a preacher but he don't have the Holy Ghost we've seen that before all right and he's and he's he he's in a terrible condition right I'm glad that there's still mercy and Grace for people who make big mistakes but he was in bondage to that old nature on now it hadn't been changed cu the Holy Ghost had not yet come but Jesus told him he said I prayed for you he said the devil would like to sift you like wheat but he said I prayed for you he said and when you're converted I love that he didn't say if but he said when you're converted strengthen your brethren so Peter's words were negative I'm going somewhere with this cuz I want to pick up a little bit on it Sunday morning Peter's words were negative to in that situation because that's what he was yeah right out of the Treasure of his heart he's speaking negativity saying I'm not one of them I don't know him he denied him right but after Pentecost at pentec C he was released sir to speak goodly words right to speak present truth come on Tre you can all fellowship with me on that thought one day you were in bondage one day I was in bondage and our speech gave us away as to who we were we were our old nature we were the old man but one day something happened and now we find ourselves fellowshipping around the message of the hour speaking a different language than what we used to speak in the world might look at us and say what in the world is that where does that come from well it's there it comes from the fact that that we have been changed we've been let loose what did he say na said you going to be like a a dough let loose that's where Peter was from yeah he was released to speak goodly words amen he was let loose to speak present truth the spirit of the one who spoke at Nazareth was now in Peter speaking goodly words I believe it'll change the way you speak around the house I believe it'll change the way you talk to each other I believe it'll change the way you speak to your children if you ever get the Holy Ghost really in your heart and he begins to speak through you you yield yourself to that acts chapter 2 and verse 6 the Bible says here here they come out of the upper room staggering out like drunk men and women too and they're just just staggering all around and and under the influence of the Holy Ghost and when they did that you know it probably be out of order today but it wasn't out of order then I don't believe it's still out of order today if we got a real good dose of the Holy Ghost yeah and they were just under the influence of it they're making a lot of noise and people come around to see it right and in Acts chapter 2 and verse 6 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together we're confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language oh my with a Galilean accent right think about it because it says they were all amazed and Marvel saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans so they could tell they were From Galilee yeah but they weren't speaking what they were speaking before but they were speaking goodly words true words and was actually being translated by the Holy Spirit into the ear of the people that were listening so the accent was still there yes right that's how they knew they were galileia the accent was still there but the words were different and brother brandom I don't want to get ahead of myself but we may talk about it on Sunday but brother brandham said that when you are converted he said first you think it he said and then because something happens inside of you then you think it he said and then you speak it and then you manifest it right if you think it then you speak it then you manifest it oh church that's exactly what they did they it come up but where did the thinking come from it was the Holy Ghost in them that caused them to have thoughts and then words and then manifestation yes so that's good now in Acts chapter 2 verse 8 says how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born these are Gans jump to verse 12 it says they were all amazed we in doubt saying one to another what meth this yeah yeah others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice sir what did he do he lifted up his voice begin to say goodly words why he had been released and it changed the way he talked about his situation he wasn't scared of the Romans no more he wasn't scare the Jews no more but he said actually you crucified him he actually indicted that generation because his words had been changed but he stood up and lifted up his voice said to them you men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words who is this guy the same guy that was always putting his foot in his mouth all right yeah right the same guy that could never say a right word could never say the right thing at the right time only one time and that was God speaking through him that was a revelation of the Holy Ghost yeah but but he could not other than that it seemed like he always said the wrong thing but here he's speaking goodly words why he he was let loose to speak the words of God to those who s in darkness light had come and he said this is that why was he saying the same thing Jesus said when he stood there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled Peter stood up on that day and said this is that which was spoken what was it he could speak goodly words because he had been released to do it yeah amen now are you with me so far to those who sit in darkness light had come but aren't we living in a day of light Oh my he said but brother Ben there's Darkness out there this is really a simple thought I know you kind of we went around the around the block to get here but if if this is a promise that was given to a tribe yet maybe unfulfilled but yet it was fulfilled in Christ right but in our day this was written of us arise shine Isaiah 61 for thy light is come and the and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee if our light has come shouldn't our speech amen be changed on in Luke 4:22 it says all bearing witness that's what we read a little bit ago wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son they just couldn't see it but they knew the words were good yeah brother Brandon one time was setting up a prayer line at the Tabernacle do I still have your attention I forgot to set my timer so but we're we're doing good some people he said this he was setting up a prayer line at the tabern because brother brandom actually had prayer lines yes yes he did right he did it's why we have them CU we had a good example yes but the B says some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is de said did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing he said the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read and said the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the blind he said now we would think if such anointing was on him had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing someone say the full blessing full bless an anointing of the Lord upon him we would want him to we would want to run all over the building scream and holler right and there' be nothing wrong with that but that's not the anointing that's the blessing of God but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down yes sir come on we need to bring back that kind of preaching I'm just kidding and precious words proceeded it was a joke precious words proceeded from his mouth yes all right oh my listen what he says that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how oh church that's where we're coming to that's what's got to be fulfilled in the bride we're bringing it from the Old Testament coming right into our day what's our position what are we supposed to do yeah right he said that's what's here yeah brother Andrew you can preach that sometime that's what's here that Supreme anointing that brother brandom talked about that Jesus had he turns right around said that's what's here all right he said now you might not be able to to understand it as you walk here you might not be able to get it but I challenge your faith to this sir yes sir I believe this is a challenge our faith tonight I know some of us are sick and have been going through some things I know we've had some trials lately all right but I want to challenge your faith all right you come and believe yeah what I told you amen that's why we can't change the way we have church cuz that's what he told us we don't change who we are as Christians cuz that's what he told us we don't change what we believe about the signs and gifts and miracles and we believe that's done in the church why because that's what he told us we don't change what we believe about the Holy Ghost cuz that's what he told us he said if you believe what I've told you watch what happens you just believe what's been told sir come on I may run all over the building that's not going to be the anointing that just be blessing to me and to you maybe if you saw me run you realize how simple it is church we don't need to work it up we don't need to we don't need to pull it down all but he said that's here that Supreme anointing is here and if you just believe what's been told oh Church see what happens the anointing of the Lord is in the the temple the Tabernacle this morning you say well it was there but it's not here Hebrews says Jesus Christ the same brother BR said he was the same except for one thing the physical body the same in every aspect he he come he said my message is to is to show that he's here to declare that he's here yes then can we believe that tonight church can we just believe what's been told am we don't have to make up something new can we just believe what's been told and see what happens amen yes glory to God see he said the anointing is on me yeah to speak goodly words I've been released the word goodly is beautiful all right qualities that give pleasure to the senses yeah the the the the word word they're goodly words words is a statement a statement it's a it but it's a it's more than a statement on it's a production of something yeah if you go back the word in some places it's translated twig twig it's a shoot from the ground and some translations in fact in the Amplified it says nap is a h Lo which yields lovely fonds so the words are are a production of the freedom right the word I tell you what I I I've had a Time studying this the word is a production of the freedom what was it there had to be Freedom yes and then words came yeah there had to be freedom in your life and then goodly words came now look it's a product of the releasing of the prisoner yes so we see Peter before Pentecost Peter after Pentecost Peter's no longer under bondage to negativity neither should we be come on he's no longer under bondage to fear neither should we be all why have we been let loose he doesn't have to be afraid of saying I'm a Believer he doesn't have to be afraid of saying I believe in Jesus I believe the message of the hour he doesn't have to be afraid when he prays over his lunch he don't have to be afraid to tell his friends who he is he don't have to be afraid why because he's no longer under bondage to to a thought that would produce a word of negativity but he's but he got something in him that produces a word yes that's good yes amen before pentecost's words condemned him look at this in Matthew 12:35 a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things right and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things right right but I say unto you that every Idol words that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou sh be justified by thy words thou sht be condemned listen to the way brother Brown explains it he said what is a convert a convert means to change something over and your thoughts your habits your being has been changed from a sinner to a Christian are you still with me tonight do we love the word do we still love the word i i church I just I just want to I want to fellowship with people who love the word I want to go to church with people who love to hear the word what is a convert it's your thoughts your habits your being has been changed from a sinner to a Christian first thing you know it in your heart first thing you know it in your heart then you express it with your lips and then it material realizes and that's what you are better watch what we say right a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart speaks good things he said now if you think that you think it what a word but you imagine you think it and you express it and it doesn't materialize then you're on the wrong road cuz if it it was come from the good Treasure of your heart it'll produce what it's saying yeah so it won't be just words but it'll be a life amen it's good he said look he said if you imagine you're a Christian you speak it out with your lips but you find out you're not you better get your thoughts changed and get your heart changed because it doesn't bear the record it doesn't bear fruit of it but the fruit of the spirit is gentleness Oh My Oh you mean the fruit of the spirit is not getting on the phone telling everybody everything everybody's doing wrong through the spirit's gentleness boy I could just stop and preach there for a while peace longsuffering goodness Mercy Faith he said if every little thing comes along sir and you fly up at it better be careful make excuses for your temper God don't allow it you say well I'm a human being I got temper absolutely but you need to repent if you lose control of it cuz that's Insanity try it go find out what brother Brandon said about that so there's something he said that was legion's problem said he just had a bunch of temper devils and it produces Insanity something hasn't happened you're expressing something here he said that's not here you're expressing something here that's not here Jesus said to the Pharisees you hyp hites how can you say good things that's what made them a hypocrite they thought one thing in their heart and expressed their lips with something else you can say whatever you want to I believe the message I believe brother brandom is right I believe he's 100% right I believe he's a prophet right but does your life materialize that right do we do what he says it's one thing to say it it's another thing to do it because he didn't say if you if you just repeat after me me Watch What Happens he said if you listen to my words if you do what I said are you with me now he said now he said that's what makes you a hypocrite foroud of the abundance of the heart speak the mouth you don't speak what you really think you must someone say must say what you think if you don't say it see speak your words let them come from the bottom of your heart he uses the uh expression or the the illustration of Jesus speaking to the tree he said then let that be pure let your thoughts run pure your Expressions pure live pure and be pure he said now out of your heart proceedeth evil thinking adultery all these different things if that comes out of your heart that's what's in your heart but if out of your heart comes righteous peace love joy oh my then it's coming from a resource here that's made up of that he said see what I mean it's made up of the spirit of God here that's expressed itself through the work and what you say then what you say will come to pass oh my goodly words from a heart that's been released to speak it Hallelujah why because the habitation of God is there sir remember it was it was Peter that was wrestling wrestling with God trying to wrestle with God didn't understand but one day receiv received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then what happened he's be to speak good goodly words he said then you just he said if you're trying to impersonate you're just making a hypocrite out of yourself cuz you can't do that Christianity has to come from the heart Jesus speaking to the Pharisees said you Hypocrites how can you say good things he said out of the abundance of the heart out of the abundance of the heart speak of the mouth then if the heart thought one thing and the mouth spoke something else it becomes hypocrisy we must from our heart Express exactly how we feel that's what worship is church we're not worshiping because of an external influence we're not worshiping we don't lift our hands just cuz somebody tells us to but we lift our hands even in the hard times we worship Paul and Silas worshiping even in the jail cell there there's something going on why because it's something from their heart it come out of their heart a song come out of their heart you may not feel much like worshiping tonight but there's something in your heart and it expresses through your mouth through the fruit of your lips he said we must express it from our heart if we can't express the right thing then keep still he said don't say nothing about it boy wouldn't that change things sir listen to this statement this is wonderful he said now if the church ever gets to practicing that they'll have they might have fewer members for a while but they'll have better members while they're having it God grant the day when every man or woman all right will be and express just what they are when Peter spoke and said I don't know him he was just expressing what he was Gile Darkness yeah but the people that sat in darkness right saw a great light yes amen and when his nature was changed out of his heart and to his thinking and out on his lips come goodly Words which were backed up by a manifestation of the Holy Ghost because acts 10:44 tells us while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word he was speaking there at cornelius's house and and as he preached to them and told them the promises of God the Holy Ghost actually fell during the preaching all right I believe that's what ought to happen every service I believe the Holy Ghost ought to be present in our preaching in everything that we say yes brother BR said therefore we should never speak anything but what we believe and understand Let It Be pure and undefiled and holy let our conversations be clean and pure I say help me Lord our thoughts thinking the best thing thinking God's thoughts staying upon God's program and away from the things of the world right again he said this he said it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you mustn't never say that don't never someone say never never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart could that be the fruit of our lips tonight I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always in your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts that don't entertain it oh my people have become so negative about a move of the spirit and that's why it it never works around them because they become so negative about it that they can't even experience it anymore I say let it be positive I believe I believe my kids are going to get some help when Camp comes along I believe that because I believe God is good enough that he can find a way to get the message to them and then goodly words will produce a reaction in their life and the presence of God will anoint that place I believe in every one of our church services that miraculous things can happen why not because of me but because I I have a positive testimony about the word good something inside of me says come on Church something inside of me says that our young people are not going to leave all right we're not going to lose another Generation by the Dell in this area we're not going to do it yeah sir how about let's just not do it say brother Ben that's off with bold words how about let's just let's just keep our words let's just let it come from the heart I don't want to lose another generation right I'm tired of the fighting in the fussel all right all right this come from my heart tonight I'm tired of it I don't want to see it no more and those you said well those thoughts come yeah they'll come he said you can't help the other thoughts from coming the thoughts from coming he said but that'll be like the farm that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he sure could stop them from roosting you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on see cuz that didn't come from your heart that thought that tells you you're not good enough that thought that tells you you're not saved that thought that tells you young people to commit suicide and and give up on the gospel and leave and go out here in the world that thought didn't come from God it come from the devil we need to take that and blast it out of the sky with the shotgun with the double barrel shotgun of the Old and New Testament find out what God Said you really are yes sir he said don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them amen oh I love that all things are mine but the second part of that is I'm going to keep them I'm not going to let the Philistines come in and take my territory I'm not going to fail to to make my bord secure I'm going to make sure because this is the age that he called for full fulfill fillment of the word this is the age of fullness this isn't the age of a halfway backslid church it's that in the natural it's that in the layo the sins but not in the bright we've not been called to serve God half-heartedly we've been called to serve him with all of our heart that's right excuse me for yelling at you on a Wednesday night but we're almost done all things someone say it with me all things are Mind by God and I'm going to keep them oh that change our lives if we just testify that way I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you sir as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession sir he can only do for us yes sir as we accept it and confess see that that that deer had to be released David talked about the deer thirsting for the water as the heart thirst after the water broke so thirst my my my soul after you oh God he's thirsting for water being chased by hounds of hell as brother Brandon put it so eloquently but once the water is found sir the deer is released from the fear to finally fulfill its purpose purp yeah and I believe that Jacob was speaking to his son NEP and he's saying there will be Darkness because they went through a if you look at the history of it we didn't get into it tonight but there's was much Darkness they the tribe basically got wiped out and in the wars and things like that and and actually they they were kind of lost and it it was a bad situation but he said I you know you you're going to go through some things there's going to be some Darkness but Isaiah would say the people who said in darkness all right would see a great light and once the water is found and Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest come and drink of the Water of Life yeah once the water is found the deer is released yes to fulfill its purpose and begin to produce goodly words the right kind of words that could bring about I don't want to scare you but could bring about a resurrection all Hallelujah the right words at the right time that we could be like caty Wright when she spoke he knew that she would say she would ask for the right thing all that he could trust us that much he would know we wouldn't ask for money but our words would be goodly words right we wouldn't even ask for physical healing although that's part of the Covenant but what did she ask for she said the salvation of my children what's the most important thing the salvation of our children what what are we going to someday that bride's got to get to a place of maturity until we ask for the right things I believe we're right there I believe this message has brought us into that place yes into that fullness of the word we can begin to rise up and say lord it's time for me to speak hallelujah it's time for me to be who I am musicians go ahead and come it's time for me to be like the deer that's found the water oh yes been released from the snare of the hunter oh yeah producing beautiful fonts beautiful words of life never let your testimony be negative could we do that today could we actually do that he said brother Ben you don't know what I've been through I don't but I know what God will do for you and I don't I wasn't tempted in every point to know what you're going through I didn't go through all of that but he did everything that you've been through he was he was touched by that in his Humanity he he he lived that he come and lived that he was a young person he was a he was middleaged he was he was sick he was weary he hurt he had pain everything he went through it so I don't know what you've been through but I know who can release you I don't know what Darkness hangs over your life I don't know what's been in your family past but I know he can release you so I say let that prophecy come true in the in the in the hearts of the minds of the Bride today let it come true Lord let me speak goodly words let the people that s in darkness see great light let me begin to speak my healing my salvation the salvation of my children let me never speak negative again can you imagine what the church would be like if no one ever talk negative about the church come on come on brother you imagine come on Church you imagine what kind of services you would have I'm thinking to our local folks now if no one ever complained come on church we got to reach a place of maturity I'm not here just to hear music I'm not here just to hear preaching or to see how long the service goes I'm here to receive from God I'm here to get a blessing I come here to drink from the water and I'm not going to give up till I reach it I'm going to speak goodly words I believe that my Pastor's going to have something to say I believe that the song leader is going to move in the right direction I believe things are going to be better I believe that the spirit of God is going to meet us tonight and people are going to be delivered and people are going to be healed if we'd begin to talk like that what kind of a words would begin to come from our lips what kind of manifestation would come from our heart if we speak nothing but negativity nothing but negativity listen to me church you can talk yourself right out of the church talk yourself right out of the message talk yourself right out of being a Christian brother brandom taught us that he said you always you say I am a Christian Lord help me to receive more of you I am the elect of God Lord let me have some more of you feel me Lord hallelujah that just be our prayer t let bow our heads together maybe maybe the words that you find yourself speaking every day or not goodly words maybe maybe that's why marriage is on the Rocks job's not going too well maybe it's because the way you're talking about it or the way I talk about things God helped me today not to be negative towards the message you realize why I've watched it over and over negative pastors produce negative churches God help me not to be that that negative people produce negative children you want your children to be saved don't go home and eat the the pastor for dinner or some other Pastor Let Them See goodly words come out of your mouth and then begin to manifest those words things will begin to be different maybe you've not had goodly words come out of your mouth maybe you'd like say Lord release me today release me so I can speak goodly words Lord help us I've got my hands up Lord I I if I come under the bondage of negativity let me be released tonight yes let let me wrestle with that until I'm released and and I and I become all that you want me to be I believe I can be all that you promis me I could be God bless you each one I'm praying for myself tonight and for each one of you oh God change our language Let us speak like they did on the day of Pentecost under the influence of the Holy Ghost till they can hear and say what must we do to be saved instead of negativity and and vitual and all kinds of anger and stuff like that let be speaking love and joy and peace and gentleness Under the Influence let it be the fruits of the Holy Ghost Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray that you'd move tonight Lord in our hearts Lord I I know it's not a very deep thought but God if we could just change our words and change what we say Let It Be goodly words may we be released tonight by the power of the Holy Spirit to speak
