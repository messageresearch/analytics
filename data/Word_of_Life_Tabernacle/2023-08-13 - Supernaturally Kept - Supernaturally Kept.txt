like to make known we've uplifted hand I know God sees each and every heart and knows what your need is today Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be in your presence this morning and no Lord that we're two or three are gathered together that you are here Lord we believe that promise of your word along with all the other promises that you've given us these precious promises Lord and we stand by faith on that today and believe that each one of these needs will be met or whether it's physical or financial or spiritual I pray you'd meet these needs today God and I Pray by the preaching of your word it would give us Faith Lord and encourage us to believe and to do what you've called for us to do in this hour to become the word of our day I pray you granted Lord we're not here to play church but Lord we we want to be your bride Lord we we want to be somebody that the Lord that you would account worthy to be in your bride though you've called us and chosen us before the foundation of the world we want to live up to our calling Lord we we want to be right we we want to express the word in our lives and so ask you to come and supernaturally meet all of our needs and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn with me to First Peter chapter one First Peter chapter one we'll read verses three through five foreign be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ it's according to His abundant Mercy aren't you glad for His abundant Mercy today have begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that faith not away reserved in heaven for you someone say for me who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time amen I pray Lord that is blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you this morning on a title of supernaturally kept supernaturally kept we live in what the Bible describes as perilous times don't we a time of trouble an hour of deception a a time when the 200 million demons out of the Euphrates River have been released not brother Brandon said not on the church world but on the bride that the the time when everywhere you look there's evil everywhere you look there's trouble everywhere that you look there's deception and and we find it's a time that when you uh you look at your children I know this is the last week in Arkansas before uh school starts this coming week and you look at your children you think how are they going to make it is there a possibility that they could make it and become Sons and Daughters of God they could be it's hard to even see how people could become normal citizens normal people in the world that we live in because everything's so dark and yet we don't need to look at things through the darkness or just the way that they are but Christians look by faith and she by Faith they see something else Moses did not see the the bondage of the people but he saw what God was going to do he saw Deliverance coming and we've got to by faith be able to see that there's Deliverance coming there there's something we've been given a message for a reason in the hour that we live in so now you find when Peter wrote these words that he said you're kept by the power of God the early church that Peter wrote to they also faced perilous times and it was a time of a physical persecution but it was also a time of that white horse rider in the first seal when he wrote out and he he deceived the people and there was an antichrist Spirit at work during that time that was working among the people to try to make them not believe the word and disbelieve the word or or begin to cool off as as it was put in the Ephesian Church age to lose their first love and so it was a perilous time it was a hard time to be a Christian just like it is today but Peter speaks to those people and speaks to us as well when he says we are kept by the power of God we are kept now that word kept actually in the original is to be a Watcher in advance to to mount guard as a sentinel to post spies at the gates Amen to him in to protect or to keep with the Garrison so if a if an army would come through and Conquer a city they would leave a Garrison or they would send to Garrison they would send enough soldiers to keep the city from Attack they would send they would send an army there to keep the city and their job will simply not to go out and Conquer more but to keep what was already there and so he said you are kept by the power of God you are garrisoned by the power of God you are garrisoned Supernatural and I hope we can see today beyond the beyond the limitations of Flesh beyond the limitations of how my kids are going to be able to survive how they're going to make it if you could go with your children to the public schools and you'd walk through the halls of the school sometimes when if you could see what they go through every day maybe it'd make you not even want to send them and I know we have something at home school and some that send their kids to public school we've done both with our kids and and as you begin to see that you begin to be reluctant even to let them go out in public because it's such a horrible thing that they have to go through but whether you're there or not they are supernaturally kept by the power of God we need to understand that today our children are not just giving up to the world we don't just let them go and do what they want to do but they're supernaturally kept by the same power that keeps you oh we need to believe that today so now we're we're garrisoned or shielded by the power of God through faith unto salvation Philippians 4 and 7 uses the same word kept or keep when it says the peace of God how many believe in the peace of God today that passeth all understanding shall keep Garrison protect your hearts and minds and Minds through Christ Jesus you may feel like you're going crazy you may feel like everything you may be I know moms sometimes at home you feel like you're going crazy you feel like nothing is working out like the way you want it to work out and you're standing there in your kids maybe maybe even if your kids are older and they begin to go their own way and you begin to look at them and say there's no way it'll ever work but he's going to keep your peace he's going to keep your heart he's going to keep your mind he promised to do that right he keeps our hearts and our minds through Christ Jesus and the Bible tells us that we are protected and it tells us what we are protected by we are protected by angels how many believe that today we are protected by Angels see these are real things it's not just something we say but we believe we're protected from an unseen Realm by Angels the Bible says in Psalms 34 7 the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him in other words they Garrison around the person that fears God and delivereth them so brother Brown says this about that scripture he said and God is always present if we could only remember that oh church if we could I would make our lives different it would make our church services different it would make our the way we talk to one another different if we recognize brother Joe that that God is always present if we could only remember that the angels of the Lord are encamped about those who fear Him that in this building tonight stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is hosts of angels oh God if you can only see we've preached about it before but he said if you can see beyond the veil of Flesh you see Angels standing at their positions not just in this church but wherever you go they go with you come on Sir host of angels thousands of them gathered around Hallelujah now what did that what did Elisha say to the to his servant when he was worried he said he said how are we going to make it here the Syrian Army has come up against us and Elijah said there's more with us and be with them and he said I I don't understand that statement and he said Lord open his eyes and he began to see the hills were full of Chariots of Fire and Horses of fire you don't realize what's working for you there's a supernatural realm out there host of angels surrounding you oh my God I would be a worried individual it wasn't for the protection of God be a scared man if it wasn't for the protection of God not only for my children but for myself for my wife for the church but I believe in God's Supernatural keeping so now brother Brian said you don't see them but you can feel I love this people say well it's not about feelings but I'm glad he lets us feel aren't you glad it's not about feelings your life is not about feelings you don't make you don't make a decision to be married Based On A Feeling but I'm glad there is a Feeling makes it a little more tolerable right aren't you glad there's a little brother tells a story about the man that left his home and and his wife had a little spat and she stood by the door and he kissed her and and she kissed him and they went he went out down the road and something was wrong he said he he didn't understand it and and so he stopped he went back and he said they apologized to one another for those fact that went on and he kissed her again she kissed him again same as they did before but he said this time it was feeling in it and so we need feeling in our services yeah that's part of it we're human beings that's not what we base our faith on but we can feel god brother Brown said you can feel these this Angelic presence we preached about it with the pillar of fire he said you you it's like a man that couldn't see he said couldn't see the sun if he was blind but he could still feel the warmth of it you can still feel the warmth of the presence of God you can feel the influence of angels if they're telling you that they're here yeah he said if that isn't so then the scripture isn't so if the scripture isn't right then God isn't right the Bible said the angels of God are in Camp they don't leave they stay near those that fear Him Jesus said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst and that makes him in a world that we cannot see that our five senses doesn't contact Jesus Christ is here present he said if we could be conscious of that he said remember not only here but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that profess to be Believers and fear the Lord amen he said Remember the angels of God are moving with you wherever you are they watch everything you do every thought that goes through your mind and they know all about you he said therefore we must be conscious of that he said if we're not conscious of it then you act anyway oh God so people mostly today too many people are not conscious of the presence of the Lord Jesus he said that's the reason they we have these things that we have going on now that's not right yeah but David said he said I'll set the lord always before me someone say always I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved everything I do he said it's in his presence he's always before me some of you drove a long ways to get to church but because you set the lord always before you God kept you safe getting here aren't you glad for that today he kept you safe just get that's something we ought to thank God for he kept you down through your life you can look back and see moments when supernaturally you were kept by the power of God in Psalm 91 10 he said there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come not thy dwelling you can say what you want to I'm gonna claim that promise for myself for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep you in all thy ways they shall bear the up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone now I want to dig in a little deeper this morning so we understand what our responsibilities are as we as our supernaturally kept by his presence now you remember if you were here last week you remember that I preached and I used this during my sermon as the part where they shall bear the up in their hands let's sell Dash thy foot against the stone it's where Satan comes and quotes this scripture to Jesus you remember yeah and he quotes it to him and we find that he wants him to uh to uh do something to show off and to actually let go and just uh and just give himself over to the elements so then that the Angels would bear him up and and you know if you look at this promise and you look at how being Supernatural he kept you might say well brother Ben that means that well I don't have to worry about my children well that is true because worry is sin all right so we don't need to worry about our children but say well you know really it doesn't matter who they go around it doesn't matter what church they go to it doesn't matter because I'm supernaturally captive but you realize that was Satan's view of that scripture that no matter what Jesus did he would still be kept right but Jesus being the word stood there and spoke the word and said you that's what I tempt the Lord thy God so you say well this makes it easy when it comes to my children I'll just let them chart their own path and then when they get older God's going to keep them anyway but now watch watch what the promises are now you might say well if angels are always surrounding them why should I worry about them let them just be like the other kids they've been baptized after all it's in church everything's okay and I'll say this if you have that attitude I hope you never have children let them do what they want to hell yeah I remember what I wanted to do as a kid I can't let myself just do what I want to none of us can't because we're human beings so so now we have a responsibility to be supernaturally kept and we're going to talk about it some more there's a responsibility that we have to remain behind the word of God now now we looked at this last week again let's just read it again Matthew 4 5 then the devil takes him up into the holy city said to them on a pinnacle of the temple and saith in him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down but the man who said he knew that the Son of God was coming but he couldn't see that flesh being the son of God so he could recognize the Son of God but not the son of man right and many people are having that same problem today that's why they can't see the message of the hour because the message is hidden brother Steward behind flesh Veil behind flesh so now he said he he said just let go he says if that'll be the Son of God he'll give his angels charge concerning in their hands they shall bear thee up Lester anytime thou Dash thy foot against the stone just let go do what you want regardless what the word says but Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and brother Brandon says that's where he calls himself God thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God now we want to be born of his Spirit brother Brandon says and recognize and watch for him so if he's always around us we want to be born of his Spirit recognize and watch for him he said he's so close to you he's not only close to you you born-again people he's already in you trying to will he said in the devil's standing there saying don't believe it don't believe it don't believe this it ain't for you it's not for another day he said oh say get thee behind me Satan it is written The Works that I do so you do also he said that's what Jesus defeated Satan he never used his power he was God manifested In the Flesh but he didn't use his power all the gifts I love this all the gifts he said brother Ben I have a gift but he had all the gifts all the gifts that there was in heaven he had them in him but he didn't use that he just took the father's word we have that same word the weakest Christian as an access to that same word today the least gifted person in the group has access to the word of God amen so now Jesus defeated Satan now you think they took the father's word he said it's written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God it is written it is written it's written it's written and he defeated Satan and the word of God will defeat Satan listen anywhere on any grounds at home or at school right at the church or on the job you believe it today oh God and God help you if your job is the school but Justin but he's even there isn't that right he's even there that when we think that we can't but again when we think that well there's nothing I can do to help these children it's everything's against me I'm surrounded by by a secular world but in that moment you can stand there and say I have a God who promised to be with me I am supernaturally kept and the word of God will defeat Satan on any ground under any conditions and laodicea in the darkest time that there's ever been the word of God still defeats the Enemy No matter how old you get no matter how bad your body gets I don't know whether JT wants to be here this morning but he's home probably watching but brother JC no matter how bad it gets see he's still with you the word of God still defeats Satan on any grounds under anything no matter what the doctor said no matter what the people said yes yes sir Hopper I just hope we can feed on that word this morning Hallelujah let's go back to what Peter said who watch who and that's important who somebody's kept by the power of God who is that that's the elect children of God has been born again by the spirit of God yes you can't make yourself a child of God you were always were all right if you weren't always a child of God you can't get blood out of a turnip yeah but you are a child of God because you always were a child of God that's what the Bible teaches now we are kept who who Who's kept the elect child of God who has been born again by the spirit of God now watch by one spirit this is where brother random always takes us back to the new birth but one Spirit we are baptized into one body so this is the body that's kept it's the body of Christ whether we be Bond or free have been all been made to drink into one spirit and and so we can say if you are filled with the Holy Ghost if you have the token the true Holy Ghost for the hour that you live in he said brother Ben how do I know that I have it that I'm eligible for this kind of protection all right well because the Holy Ghost brother Brown said it's the action in you the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a person I love that Jesus Christ the word of God establish oh I love it the word of God is established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age what a definition Hallelujah to Quicken everywhere they said watch the Holy Ghost In Action he said not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word so if you're born again you will not willfully cross over the word you can't do it you can't do it you may fall you may fail there may be all kinds of problems in your life but you will not see the word of God and to be plain before you and walk over that if you do that it don't mean you can't be saved it means you need to be saved now we are kept the spiritual power of God So This Promise is for us trusting that we've all come to Christ and we've been filled with the Holy Ghost if you haven't now's the time to do it and but trusting that we have brother bear said would you like to join he said the only way you can join is be born he said now the great thing is open here the altar of God there's room at the fountain any man in here would like to join these ranks this afternoon that listen that will lay aside every Creed that's contrary to the Bible every thought that's contrary to the Bible every Doctrine that's contrary to the Bible and with faith walk up here and say I accept Jesus Christ upon the basis of his shed blood and his word amen that's how you change that's how you're saved not because you say well this is right or that is right but I believe the word of God and I'm coming and claiming it for myself not because some emotion but because I walk by faith and I believe I accept Jesus Christ the basis of his shed blood in his word I tell you something will happen to you right here and you'll be fortified with the power of the Holy Ghost you might say brother Ben I thought we were fortified by the word we are the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ which is the word and it is the moving of the holy spirit that fortifies us behind the word and watch when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth right so it's all it's impossible to please God without faith it's impossible to please God without the Holy Ghost right so now he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak he will show you things to come mother Brown said it this way said come in and take a taste of the original Manna the kind that fell on the day of Pentecost that's the kind I wanted that's the kind you want the Manna for the church the Holy Ghost the armor what we're fortified not with intellectual education doctors degree but we are fortified with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove the word of God is the truth so it's got to be more than just dead letter let her kill it but the spirit giveth life but it's actually the holy ghost that fortifies us behind the word good yes sir amen can we see it this morning oh this is why a prophet told us he said you pray for Revelation more than anything else oh my now Revelation more than had knowledge yeah yeah right and you need head knowledge you need to understand the things of God but you need revelation of the things of God because then that applies to your life so you again now he said you're kept now look at that again if you've got your Bible still open first Peter look you're kept who that's us all right we've been born again we've been Hallelujah we've been brought into the kingdom of God we've we've changed kingdoms yeah yeah right and we've been translated into the kingdom of God now that's us now we are kept by the power of God that's the Holy Ghost through faith yes now watch this this is not only saying I believe take it to the kids because we're we've talked about them I know they're on your mind this morning because of school coming up you say well I believe my kids will be okay right that's a certain element of Faith to that to say that but that alone is not enough right we are kept by the power of God through faith but faith is not just a saying faith is an action now listen if you believe apply the token if you believe get in the ark right Hebrews 11 7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear oh my prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith brother Brown said one day one Noah was out in the field maybe fixing his crop God appeared to him and told him make ready for the saving of your household and build an ark it's gonna rain now he said scientists could prove there was no water up there but Noah could say God said that it would rain and that settles it God said so 120 years he was persistent in the face of the scientific world of his day still claiming his message was right because it comes from God brother man how long will you claim this message is Right till the day I die or go in a Rapture why because it's the truth it doesn't need to be Vindicated by Me by anybody else it's already been Vindicated sure it's the word of God and so Noah had a word from the Lord a message and told him build an ark and then when it was built to go into the ark he had a goal to make he had a message to take care of he was persistent in doing so no matter what the rest of the world said no I heard from God that's all that matters he had heard the voice he was sure it was God what's your attitude towards the message of the hour today I challenge you on it what is your attitude it'll determine what you do can you have the faith like Noah did to say this Ark is my art this message is my message I'm going to get into it I'm going to walk into it I'm going to be a part of it no matter what the rest of the world said no I heard from God it's all that mattered to him he'd heard the voice Hallelujah he was sure it was God and he was making ready something that very seemed very silly to the world yet Noah knew that God would keep his word should that not be a lesson for us today the hour if Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man a message that's silly to the world they don't understand it but yet those who contact with the Holy Spirit knows that he will return again he said I can see the people as they poor old Noah about how much fun he was missing yeah come on church I know I know you endure persecution I know because I do too I know that people laugh and make fun of the message I know what they say about our women I know what they say about our young people I know what they say about our church services yeah I know what they say about a bunch of Pentecostal a bunch of people that a bunch of people don't know anything ignorance I know what they say much occult followers but I know the message is true it may be stupid to the world but I've contacted the Holy Spirit I know he will return again to the people pitted portal know about how much fun he was missing of the world and the things that's going on but no one still persisted held right on one day God said to know all right you've done your part now now coming to the ark Lord of God don't you that's the hour that we're living in you've done your part and the message has been built the ark is there I don't have to add to it or take away from it I can walk into it that's the hour I'm living in now my action of faith is to walk into the ark Stewart you're gonna have to preach tonight buddy clean all this up we're gonna dig just a little bit more huh his family was kept you want your family to be kept I hope you're hearing me today we want our families to be kept sometimes it's just simple obedience to the word of God brother man said full obedience to the entire word of God entitles you to the Token yeah so now now I I've done the the ark's been built it's time to go in it's time to go in Paul or Paul continues on in Hebrews 11. he said by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment oh my now watch it's a little bit different scenario because he was so young that his parents Faith had to stand for his oh my some of us have little children it's our faith that keeps them until they're old enough to have their own faith someone said if you don't have any convictions borrow some of mine until you get some right if you don't have any Holy Ghost I'll let you borrow mine in fact I insist because in my house we have the token on display in my house the word of God it's it's preeminent in my house we go to church in my house we serve God we do what God Said why because it's not my house I'm not the ultimate head why can't I be a strong leader as a husband because I'm not the ultimate head the word of God is above me pulled that all the way up we're in this vessel you can't see that I've grown it was supernaturally kept through the faith of experience do you believe your children doesn't that give you hope and strength courage and be kept through the faith of their parents they put this little baby in the ark and pushed him out perhaps that I could hear God say Gabriel come here a minute all right call Ten Thousand Angels on marching orders line them all up and down the Nile you see that not any crocodile comes near that when it gets into a Whirlpool see that it gets out all right apples in this life my brother but if God has called angels on marching orders to take care of you don't worry he'll get you out of it you just stay in the program of God you believe for your children sometimes you got to let them go sometimes you gotta let them go to school sometimes you got to let them go to work sometimes you just got to let them go period commit them to God let God have his way but first you've done all you can do right so you're not standing there trying to take a shortcut like taking off for Jesus but you've trained them right the Bible said train up a child and the way he should go when he's old he will not depart from it but the random says oh your family is what you are you raised your child in a certain environment it's got a 98 better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way I'm just stupid enough I guess you'd call whatever you want to do believe what a prophet of God said he said if I raise my children right I got a 98 chance all right that it stays off of drugs a 98 better chance you recognize the devil can still get a hold of people but I got a 98 better chance instead of stays out of the bar I got a 98 better chance you show me somebody who makes the word preeminent show me a church that makes the word preeminent show me a family that makes the word preeminent their kids aren't running out somewhere running all over the place but their children are kept by the power of God he said brother Ben my kid's already raised and many of them are gone but you've got to promise if you did it right they'll come back and even in your mistakes and things if you do what you've follow the word that's what we have to do stay in the program of God you'll make mistakes it's part of being a parent but stay in the program of God said bring up a child the way you should go he said and when it's old he went out depart from be brought up right teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school don't teach your children to fall well kids what I did is when I got in a tight spot I just went against the word and stayed home for a while and and then everything turned out all right the mercy of God was great for you but don't teach your kids to fall don't put them up on the Pinnacle of the temple and shove them off and say well God said he'd keep charge of you you want to date that worldly kid God said he'd keep charge of you just push him off you wanna you wanna wear them clothes God said you keep trying to just push them off see but if we stay by the message I'm not asking you to adopt my sensibilities I'm asking you to go to the message of the hour find out what God said listen to what God Said read what God Said go to the Bible find out raise your family that way stay in the word yeah when you do they'll have a 98 better chance oh my God I love this now we're going to change gears just a little bit can we do that for just a few minutes see we don't teach our children to fall he said well David found Grace yes but his family was destroyed yeah it's good we aren't home yet aren't you glad for that he said well I wish I was home but that means he's still working on us yeah yeah we still got opportunity to be better yes yes we're still waiting now he said unto salvation he said brother Ben I'm already saved yes you are you're you are saved you're being saved and you will be saved you know what's not saved about us this and it never will be it's what has to be changed right right but it's called our Salvation so what Paul is speaking of is not the salvation of your soul but the salvation of your body that there is there is oh my that you are kept supernaturally kept by the power of God by faith through through faith unto salvation right now watch Paul talks about that in Romans chapter 8. he says I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US someday I'll know as I am known someday I won't make these mistakes someday things will be better someday the knots should have tied in life will be untied the longer I live but control the more grateful I am for the for the promise of God someday the glory revealed in me but now look where we live look at the time we live in we're so close to that and look for the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God not the Son of God but the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope or expectation because the creature the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God I love that for we know Paul calls our bodies bondage we spend so much time taking care of them don't we but you're in the bondage of corruption that's why the doctor does things to you makes you hurt that's why if you go through things that are hard that are tough and as you get older your body starts it's a bondage of corruption you can't undo it but one day in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it'll be reversed think about that for a minute now we know the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit in other words we have the token the Holy Ghost even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth what does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we've seen all this hope is expectation scripturally that we see not then do we with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for us according for the Saints according to the will of God and we know someone say we know we know so he's talking about the Deliverance of the body into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God and and looking at the big picture we know that all things someone say all things it's everything that's ever happened to you yeah work together now he doesn't say all things are good or that you didn't make any mistakes but all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of my many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called I love that who he predestinated he called who he predestinated he gave them something to do you ever think about it like that he called those who he predestinated whom he called him he also Justified let me Justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us he despair not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all thanks now stay with me for just a moment Satan tried really hard to keep me from preaching this this morning so I think I think it needs to be said now we are we're supernaturally kept under the mystery of the Rapture I want you to watch I want you to watch because we are kept unto salvation but what would he say next ready to be revealed in the last time so before we get our Salvation our Salvation is revealed right go back and read it unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time so we are supernaturally kept under the mystery of the rapture which is the revelation of our Salvation let me say this your attitude towards the message matters yes yes what it matters because this is God's word to us it's the present truth that gets us out of these bodies into another body into that glorious body now if you look at it begin to begin to think about it you realize that those who take a casual attitude towards the mysteries of God towards the things of God towards the truth of the word of God he said brother man why do you spend so much time on the message and the things of God and I believe we do need to spend time on the simple things as well but I recognize that people people will not live right unless they can get a revelation of what God's doing people are not gonna they're not gonna walk right unless they get a revelation of what God's doing they're not gonna you know if you have no revelation of the message me telling you not to cut your hair it's not going to do you hold on good if you don't have a revelation of the message me telling you not to do certain things women not to wear makeup and things like that that's not going to do you a whole lot of good because you don't I'm not condemning you for that you just don't have a revelation because a prophet spoke against it right but if you have a revelation of the importance of the message right then you begin to walk in it yeah so now our message if I can put it this way it's not a man our message is to rapture the Branham taught us that the shout is the message of the hour and each age was supernaturally kept losing my voice so you just have to bear with me for a minute each age is supernaturally kept up until a certain point and then the Bride of that age is called so each Luther Wesley Pentecost and now the bride age what we call the bride age which is that part of the laodicean age where the bride is called out so now we are we are in that age and that Revelation is given to us of the Holy Ghost for our age which is the shout the message which is the be as he descends he does all three brother Branham says the Rapture message he he descends with a shout which is a message to get the bride ready so as I said before we're already buckled in yeah oh my and watch Brothers to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's Amen it's revealed to her and again he says that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture brother says he's preaching the Rapture sermon he said now it is a revelation for the Revelation is faith you cannot see you're kept by the power of God through faith you see what I'm saying you're kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed at the last time so the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation he said faith is something's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now Faith he said that's what faith is it's revelation of God the church is built on a revelation the whole entire body so you could take that and say well the bride of Christ is waiting now on the revelation of the Rapture brother random says that at the beginning of the Rapture sermon look what he says at the end he said now we're ready waiting for the raptures the Rapture of the Saints it's been spoken so shall it be When God says anything all heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never fail again at the end he comes back and says it again God bless you it's the last thing that he says before he goes to he closes bless you it's been spoken it has to come to pass it will come to pass now brother random famously used an odd text for his Rapture message you all know where I'm going now Psalms 27. he talks about being kept in a time of trouble that's the Rapture message he said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh that's what it seems like doesn't it when everybody come against me when the whole world went crazy brother Justin when they came upon me you know my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't Camp against me my heart should not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing if I desire to the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble this was what brother Brandon preached in a Rapture message in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall behind me he shall set me upon a rock now for us it's not strange to us to have the Rapture preached from psalms 27 but if you had been sitting there you had no clue where he was going because you remember the old Holiness days Jonathan remembers it back in the day Saturday night there'd be a Rapture message or the coming of the Lord would be preacher Sunday night on some night and towards the end of the meeting in those in those camp meetings you'd have a Rapture message preach and it was always the way I preached many a Rapture message first Thessalonians 4. right First Corinthians 15. right or or one of The Parables of Jesus he says watch him be ready but never Psalms 27. Hallelujah but under the opening of the word a prophet of God under inspiration comes and brings us a Rapture sermon from psalms 27 in the time of trouble how are we living now he will hide me he will set me upon a rock listen to me Church oh I hope you're hearing me today our children are not kept under a Pentecostal message well if I could get them to go to enough meetings if I can get them to go to another that's good we want you to do that but that's not what you're kept by if I could just get them to an experience of some kind and that's wonderful we want them to have their own experience every generation has to have it but we are supernaturally kept those of us who are born again are supernaturally kept by the message of the hour that's what we feed on that's what we're kept by can you see it children are not kept under a Pentecostal message or a Lutheran message under a Rapture message we are set on a rock of Revelation that is our Shield faith first Peter one and five again listen who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time listen to me church I'm not trying to change the scripture but if you take what a prophet said and said it has been spoken so will it be we're living in the time when the Salvation has been revealed when we've been told what we had to do to go in when we've been given the key to the door God we're not waiting on being given the key to the door but we're but we we can finish the work you said we still have something to do yes we do the bride will be the final voice for the final age that's what the random said but we still have something to do but what is it it's like it's like brother Joel's building a house and I was helping him that's a scary thought isn't it but but I don't scare you to Joel but if I was helping you but Joe to build a house and and you at some point during the day you leave and you leave me there and you say now this house is not complete till this final piece is put in this final piece of siding or the final nail the final screw whatever it is this has got to be kept in and you need this certain tool to do it with but now now if you left me and you said brother Ben now when I get back I'll bring the tool and then what's been paused we'll unpause it and then you can you can finish well guess what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to Burger King get some sweet tea all right I'm gonna go to my mama's house eat some food all right that's what I'm gonna do y'all know me come on he says now watch when I get back well he'll call me you know surely let me know and he comes back but she won't be doing anything why because I'm waiting on him now brother Brandon being a master Carpenter in our age how many believe that if he had left us left us with a message but said now when I come back I'll give you the tools for it to finish it yeah what are you doing he's Gotta Wait but he didn't do that at the end of The Rapture message almost at the end of his life he tells us we're ready for the Rapture now he tells us we have a perfect River Revelation by Divine Vindication he tells us that all Seven Seals have been opened he tells us that why does he tell us that because he wants us to finish the work why why does Satan fight that brother said he fights Revelation more than he fights anything else that's right go look at it in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church of his book he said why does he fight it he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works what did Brother Graham tell us the Greater Works were go back to Shalom but the random teaches us that there was a greater word he said oh you always thought there was more more because there's more of us but then he goes into another teaching and he teaches us at the Greater Works the Greater Works was the spoken word yeah yeah oh God he said which was made something out of nothing right he said he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible army yes she will be supernaturally kept she will be the finals I'm gonna push this thing off the platform she will be the final boy to the final age under her messenger why brother Stewart because the revelation of the Rapture is in her yes she is the bride's Revival yeah come the word he has the mind of Christ or she can't steal he said brother Ben you're saying that about you what you say why can't I see that because you're looking at the flesh he's veiled again behind flesh and you're looking at it God's hiding himself in Simplicity once again stay with the word brother Brown at the end of that Rapture message about the about the ones that were marching remember the Onward Christian Soldiers the film about the end got out of stand he said stay in line with the word he was crying out to him get it back in line yeah yeah all little churches we could just say that this morning I know some of us are here and some of us are gone some are listening but if we could just if we could just in our hearts wherever we're at today to stay with the word to stay right there where God wants us to be isn't that what we should do we should always want to stay we should always want to stay right where God put us yeah I'm not preaching my microphone we should always want to stay right where did he put us in the message of the hour stay with the word stay with the token let your children stay with the word if God's Prophet said to do something do it stay with it your your safety is not dependent on your on your head knowledge your safety is not dependent on what you what you who you associate with or even what church you go to but it's dependent on you staying in line with the word stay behind the word let the Holy Ghost move you behind the word you will be supernaturally kept by the power of God musicians go ahead and come this morning oh my I've read that story while I was studying for these things I I read a story about the I'm Gonna Change mics about the Easter flower you've all heard brother brand until it was a time of great darkness of War and there was a flower a man was out there on the field in chaplain he was out there on the field and the mustard gas had just burned everything off just just nothing have you ever seen a battlefield from this from the first world war it's awful it's just scorched Earth mustard gas just killed all the plants and everything else he's looking around there and said is there any hope left for Humanity is there anything left he said it was on Easter he looked at you as a Little Rock he turned it over and underneath that rock kept by The Rock under the protection of the Rock was an Easter flower just as bright and blooming just as if there had never been any mustard gas just as oh my you realize where we're at church we don't have to bow down to the world he said well it's just the way it is we just got to do it no we don't have to do that we can live above that we can do what God promised us we could do I want to encourage you in that today your family can be what God intended for it to be he said but I've made mistakes in the past let it go and walk with God get in the ark today walk in the ark let it be gone yeah let him be God let the revelation of the Rapture let the revelation of and what is what is it it's the shout the whole message let it guide and you'll be like that Easter lily you're God's Easter lily come up to the muck and the mire and everything else comes up under the Rock under the Rockets but Lord what do you say when David say he set me upon a rock he kept me safe it's kept me safe from you kept me safe from gay rights get me safe from from politics get me settled my kept me safe from all the the nonsense on the internet listen don't he didn't promise to keep us safe under Dr Dobson's teaching he didn't promise to keep us safe under some other under some other person's teaching he promised to keep us safe under the revealed word of the hour that's a promise we've got to stay with it would you do that today let's bow our heads [Music] I'm just going to take a moment and then I want to have the kids come up in just a moment when I call you and have the kids that are in school and their parents any teachers that we have we have teachers and principal here with us and we want to pray with you as school is starting maybe even if your grandkids are in school and you're worried concerned about them you're welcome to come I I don't know but first let's let's examine ourselves I you look out in the world you don't see much hope but there's there's a rock and there's hope for a family under that rock of the revelation of the word of the hour to Hope but maybe you just want to examine yourself for a moment before we do that and say Lord if I'm not in the ark if I'm not under the rock if I'm not if I haven't put that Revelation first in my life I haven't prayed for Revelation more than anything else Lord I prayed for money I prayed for I prayed for all these other things I prayed for physical healing but Lord I need revelation I need you to reveal yourself to me Lord in a greater way than ever had before would you just raise your hand to him and just talk to him you're there in the quietness of the moment oh God give me Revelation let me put me under the rock of the revelation of the word maybe you've never given your heart to him now's the time to do it and I mean really I mean just where you you just would just refuse to cross the word again let it be settled let it be let it be done Heavenly Father oh

Revelation and then even if everything falls apart I won't fall apart because I'm kept under you oh I'm so grateful for that today Lord I pray for these families I pray you bless them now I pray that
