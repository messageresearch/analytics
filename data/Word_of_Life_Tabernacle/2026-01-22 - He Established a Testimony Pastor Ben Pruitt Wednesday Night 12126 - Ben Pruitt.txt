Just looking into forward to what we have he has in store for us tonight. Let's sing that song. We'll speed it up a little bit. I've been changed. Key of G. I've been to the water and I've been baptized. I've been washed in the blood of the lamb. I've been changed from the creature that I once was and redeemed is now my name. Oh, I've been changed and I've been reborn now. All my life has been rearranged. And what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. All my life. Praise God has been changed. Though my sins were as scarlet, they're white as snow. I was bound, but today I am free. I was lost in the darkness, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. Oh, I've been changed. And I've been reborn. Now all my life has been rearranged. And what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. all my life. When at last in his presence I stand above. He will wipe every tear from my eyes. And I'll thank him for giving a wretch like me a new home beyond the sky. Oh, I've been changed and I've been reborn. All my life has been rearranged. And what a difference it makes when the Lord has his way. All my life. Praise. God has been changed. Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. I've been trying to think of the name of it, but I want to add it in. I think it's I saw the light. Do you have that, Brother Robert? We got the backups back up tonight. So, we're just going to move around a little bit. I wonder so aimless life filled with sin. I wouldn't let my dear Savior in. Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night. Praise the Lord. I saw the light. I saw the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness. No more in night. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow in sight. Praise the Lord. I saw the light. Just like the blind man I wondered alone. Worries and fears I claimed for my own. Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight. Praise the Lord. I saw the light. Oh, I saw the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness. No more in night. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow in sight. Praise the Lord. I saw last verse. I was a fool to wander and stray. Straight is the gate and narrow the way. Now I have traded the wrong for the right. Praise the Lord. I saw the light. I saw the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness, no more in light. Now I'm so happy, no sorrow inside. Praise the Lord once again as the ushers come. Oh, I saw the light. I saw the light. No more in darkness. No more in light. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow inside. Praise the Lord. I saw the light. Are you thankful you saw the light? Amen. Everybody singing good this evening. Amen. Maybe if you just want to play something softly. We've only got um one written request tonight. Um, it says, "Please pray for Becky's foster baby, Maya. She's home and has the flu." So, just be praying for that. That's from Sister Britney. Um, I know there's a lot of sickness going around. So, just be praying for all those that are out and sick this evening. Amen. If you have an unspoken request, if you want to make it known by the lifting of your hand, ask our brother Caleb to take these needs for us tonight. Father, we thank you, Lord, for your mercy, your grace, Father, your presence in our lives. We're just so grateful for it. Lord, we just ask you to just feed your people tonight what they have need of. We just ask you to watch over the people this week, Lord, and next week. Lord, we just ask you to keep everyone safe. Lord, we ask you just to bless you tonight. We ask bless the tithes and offerings for you in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated as the ushers come by. Sister Anna, there's been a request for you and your daughters to sing. Would y'all be able to sing tonight? Singing praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. A little man made it possible that I could free. Oh, I love that man in the middle. Because I know that he first loved me. We're singing praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. But no man made it possible that I could Amen. Can we just lift our hands? We sing it to him once again. Oh, I love that man in the middle because I know that he first loved me. We sing in praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. The little man made it possible that I could go free. Are you thankful for what Jesus has done for you tonight? You must sing that song. There's nothing like the present. Yes. Thank you. There's nothing like the presence. Nothing like the presence. Nothing like the presence of the Lord. There's nothing like the presence. Nothing like the presence Nothing like the presence of the Lord. And I am free in his presence. And I am healed in his presence. I'm forgiven. I'm not the same. I'm changed forever in his presence. There's freedom. There's freedom in the presence. Freedom in the presence. Freedom in the presence of the Lord. There's freedom in the presence. Freedom in the presence of the Lord. And I am free in his presence. And I am healed in his presence. I'm forgien. I'm not the same. I'm changed forever. I'm free once again as the stranger comes. Oh, I am free in his presence and I am healed in his presence. I'm forgiven. I'm not the same. I'm changed forever in his presence. Lord, I thirst for you. There is no one else who satisfies my soul. He longs for you like the deer panting for the water. Now I'll wait for you. Take me to your courts of glory and fall upon me. Lord, give me strength to help me stand in this dry and weary land. How we need the river, how we need the rain. Living water flows to us again we pray. Shower down your glory. Shower down your grace. Let your holy presence fill this place. Let your holy presence fill this place. We call unto thee, Lord. We seek to know your glory. For they is only you. And our hearts cry out a father. Now Lord Jesus come. May your love and grace restore us. Oh, breathe upon us, Lord. Let your mercies be brand new. Let the whole earth worship you. How we need the river. How we need the rain.

How we need the rain. Living water flow to us again. We praise. Shower down your glory. Shower down your praise. Let your holy presence fill this place. Let your holy presence fill this place. How we need the river. How we need the rain. Living water flow to us again. We pray down your glory. Shower down your ways. Let your holy presence fill this place. Let your holy presence fill this place. Let your holy presence fill this place. Amen. Did you enjoy that special this evening? Amen. I know how hard it is to be called on and you don't have anything ready. So, we really appreciate that. It's a It's a service. Amen. Let's try this. We practiced this a few weeks ago or maybe more. Let's try to learn this little chorus. It's No weapon formed against you shall prosper. It's a real easy course. So, let's let's try to sing this. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. It don't want to work. Say, "No weapon formed against me shall prosper. It won't work." Say, "No weapon horned against me shall prosper. It won't work. Say, "No weapon formed against me shall prosper. It won't work once again. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. It don't want to work. Say, "No weapon formed against me shall prosper. It won't work." I think we did okay. I think there the tempo was off there. I couldn't hardly breathe. So, amen. Amen. Let's sing this song just before we ask for the bin to come out. We'll sing this one and then one more. I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Amen. Key of F. Amen. No matter what situation we're in in life, we always need him. Amen. Amen. I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need thee. Lord, bless me now, my savior. I come to thee. Oh, I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need thee. Oh, bless me now, my savior. I come to you. Maybe that sounds good. Let's sing it to him again. Oh, I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need thee. Oh, bless me now. My savior. I come to thee. Amen. Let's just all stand together as we prepare to change over the order of the service. Let's see. Can we sing that song? Where he leads me, I will follow QF. If we can as we invite our pastor to come and you're ready for the word this evening. Amen. Just pull on the gift of God and we know that he is more than able to meet our needs tonight. Amen. where he leads me. I'll go with him. with me all the way. He leads me. I will follow. He leads me. I will follow. He leads me. I will follow. I'll go with him. with him all the way where he leads me. Sing it now where he leads me. I will follow. Can you say that tonight? Tell him about it. Where you lead me out, I will follow. Where you lead me out, I will follow. Oh, I'll go with you. Oh, yes. Oh, with you. Oh, all the way. Can we sing that? He will give you grace and glory. He will give me grace and glory. Oh, he will give me grace. Do you believe he does that for you tonight? Oh yes, he will give me grace and glory. Oh, don't you love him tonight? For he will give me praise and glory. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, and go with me. He'll go with me. Oh, all the way. Would you bow your heads with me tonight? Heavenly Father, we're so privileged to be your people here tonight and to know, Lord, what we know that we are your children. We thank you for that, God. We thank you for grace and glory along the way. And Lord, we're undeserving of it, Father. But you reached down your hand for us and brought us out of the deep miry clay to be where we're where we are and to experience the blessing of being your children. And I thank you for that, Lord. I Lord, we surrender ourselves to your leadership, to your will, and to your way. I pray that you'd lead me by your word tonight. Lead these people, Lord. We'll give you all the praise and the glory and the honor. I pray if there's anyone sick tonight or that's watching or here, I pray that you'd heal them. I pray that you'd touch every heart. We pray tonight in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. It's good to be here on a Wednesday night and worshiping the Lord. I uh somebody told me it's Brother Herald's birthday. Is it your birthday today? 41. Is that right? Yeah. 41. God bless brother Harold. That's uh 41 the second time I think for brother Herald. But we sure appreciate Brother Herald. He you know he makes so much noise that we don't have to say much about him. But but we uh we sure appreciate Brother Herald and and that steady u steady faithfulness that he has in serving the Lord. And that says a lot. I appreciate all of you. I saw Sister Sander tonight and some of you elders are here on a on a cold Wednesday night. and I appreciate you being here. It means the world to me and and uh it'll inspire our young people and their faithfulness as well. We've got some bad weather coming in. You can go ahead and turn to Psalms chapter 78 and verse one. Psalms chapter 78:es 1 through um 1-8. We've got some bad weather coming in or so they say. I don't I'm not convinced that the weather people know entirely what they're talking about, but uh they say we've got some bad weather coming in. So, we're going to try to uh uh let you know Saturday morning probably if that comes in. Of course, we won't be able to have church like what they say, but there's a chance they could be wrong. So, they they are not infallible. So, we we'll let you know. We'll try to let you know Saturday morning. If there's snow on the ground, make sure you call before you come or if we're not having church, that would be on you. But, you can go ahead and worship by yourself if you can make it. But uh hopefully it'll all pass south of us or north of us or some way or another be able to have church. Psalms chapter 78 verse one. Give ear oh my people to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. He said I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children. showing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done. For he established a testimony in Jacob. And he appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children, that the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children. If you go through that, you find he's talking about five generations of children. He said that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers. A stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart a right, whose spirit was not steadfast with God. You may be seated. uh Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. As if you read on in Psalms chapter 78, David continues then to begin to testify of the wonderful things that God has done. I want to take for a text tonight that verse 5, for he established a testimony in Jacob. A testimony in Jacob. A testimony is a powerful thing. It's uh it's uh something that can make a difference in people's lives. We saw that Sunday night. I appreciated brother Josh uh giving his testimony and like he did because it meant a lot to us uh to see somebody that had gone through that and uh and was actually uh come out on the other side and it gives you a little bit of hope for yourself and for your children and and for the people that we're praying for and and we appreciate brother Josh doing that but it got me thinking about the power of a testimony and what that means and I got to reading about testimonies in the scripture And we find that a testimony. The people always went back to give a testimony. Jacob went back to Bethl. You find him going back there time after time because that was the place of his testimony. I'm a little loud, I think, on my mic. I feel like I'm I'm screaming at everybody here. Uh but uh Jacob kept going back to Bethl and and and it was there that God met him and he had a vision of a ladder that reached up into heaven and he knew that something real had happened to him. And so I I believe we can have places like that where we knew that something real happened to us that the hand of God touched us. I believe all of us need those times and those places in our lives. you will find Paul, brother Brandon said whenever he got in a tight spot, he uh began to testify about his Damascus experience and how that that God met with him there on the road and and and it was it was comforting to him. It was something he could go back to. He says, "I know that God called me. I know that God made me what I am." How many have ever had an experience like that? You say, "I know that God brought me out. I know that I I'm going to make it because I know what he did for me in the past, he can do for me again. And and if he supernaturally made me what I am today, he can supernaturally carry me forward. A testimony is simply a witness to what God has done. We've talked about that before, but I want to go a little bit different direction with it tonight. There's a difference in philosophy and revelation, right? There's a difference in having a a theory about something. Even in science there's a difference in theory and observation. We know that that the the theory of atomic the atomic bomb was just a theory until an atomic bomb was made and and once it was detonated that theory become a reality. In fact the one they dropped on Hiroshima they had never even tested that one. They had tested the other one but they didn't even test the one that they dropped. But as soon as that mushroom cloud came up, they realized that what they had predicted actually come to pass maybe even more than what they had predicted. So the testimony is the reality to the word of God. We know that faith in the written word of God actually activates the Holy Spirit to manifest that word and give us a testimony. So first of all, you got to have faith in the word. You got to believe the word even before the testimony is there. If you're ever going to have a testimony, you've got to have faith in the word. You got to believe that the word's going to going to do what it says it's going to do. And then once you believe that word, even simple faith in the word of God actually produces a testimony, which we then tell our children, we tell our grandchildren, we inspire them. And what what are they inspired to do? They're inspired to read that same word and then to achieve a testimony for themselves to activate the Holy Spirit in their lives. See, he we're not waiting on him. He's waiting on us. He's waiting on us to believe because he can only act on what we believe. &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So, our testimony then points to uh points to the fact that that there's something has happened and something happened. And if you had the faith to believe, that points to your election. That points to the fact that God chose you. If you have the faith to believe, it means that you were foreord ordained to faith from the foundation of the world. I'm so glad for that today. So the faith to believe points to election. And in 1 Thessalonians 1:4 says, "Knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you knew know what manner of men we were among you for your sake." Right? &gt;&gt; You become followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost, so that you are examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Akaya. For from you sounded out the word of the Lord. He said, not only in Macedonia and Aaya, but also in every place. Your faith to God word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything. I think that's the kind of church we want here at Word of Life Tabernacle. We want a people whose lives speak so loud, whose testimony is so great that the preachers don't even have to preach. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? In other words, we don't have to tell, well, these are the bride. This is the bride. This is the people of God. BUT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW this is Christians. These are these are Christians. There's something HAPPENED TO THEM EVEN BEFORE THEY hear the preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come." So he said, "Your your life is a testimony." Paul when he told his testimony, what what happened? He told it to them and they believed it and then they got a testimony. None of them could be Paul. And I want us to understand that as we talk about testimony, especially for our young people, we want you to understand that not everybody's testimony is going to be the same. &gt;&gt; But not everybody had to go through what Paul went through. &gt;&gt; Not in fact, I don't know that that ever happened again. &gt;&gt; Right? What happened to Paul only happened one time. I wasn't on a horse when I received the Holy Ghost. Right? I when he got my attention, it wasn't a physical light that shone down. I didn't get knocked off of a horse. I I wasn't on the road to Damascus to persecute Christians. But the same God THAT MET HIM THAT DAY IS THE SAME GOD THAT MET ME IN a basement room one day. The same God that met you IN WEST AFRICA. THE SAME GOD THAT MET YOU WHEREVER IT WAS THAT YOU WERE SAVED. THAT SAME GOD, HE'S STILL THE SAME GOD TONIGHT. HOW MANY believe that even on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT? AND YOUR TESTIMONY INSPIRES MY TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; SO, WE TELL OUR TESTIMONY SO THAT OTHERS MIGHT receive their own testimony. In the psalm that we read, Psalm 78, the the singer Asaf is the one who wrote that song. And he tells them, he says, "We're going to testify how God delivered us from our stubbornness. We talked about stubbornness here a while back, but we're going to testify about how God delivered us from our stubbornness. How he established our testimony so we can have our own so each generation can have their own testimony down to the fifth generation. So, we're going to tell about it. So, we're not going to hide from our children what God did for us. I wonder how many of us could say amen to that today. not going to hide from my children what I've been through because my life IS A TESTIMONY. THE FACT THAT I'M HERE today is A TESTIMONY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE. IT'S NOT A TESTIMONY for the devil to say that I've I've I've had done some things THAT WERE WRONG, BUT IT'S A TESTIMONY FOR GOD. I DON'T DO THOSE THINGS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You know, God will actually use things in your life, problems, afflictions, even the stubbornness of others, and the hardness of people's hearts &gt;&gt; to produce a testimony in your life. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; He He used the stubbornness of Pharaoh to establish a testimony in Israel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the Lord said to Moses, Exodus 4:21, the Lord said to Moses, "When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand, but I will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go." Now, that's interesting, isn't it? He didn't say, "I'll leave it up to Pharaoh." He said, "I'm going to I I created Pharaoh for a purpose. I'm going to harden his heart." And and you'll find in the scripture that 11 times Pharaoh's heart was hardened. EVERY TIME THAT GOD SENT A PLAGUE on the children of or on the Egyptians, Pharaoh nearly repented or nearly let him GO AND THEN GOD HARDENED HIS HEART. AND FINALLY HE DID LET HIM GO AND GOD HARDENED HIS HEART AGAIN. THEY FINALLY GET out of there and God hardened Pharaoh's heart again. Why? So a testimony could be established. So, I want us to understand this principle that sometimes God will harden the heart of somebody in YOUR LIFE TO ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY in you. I hope you're HEARING ME TONIGHT. SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A DIFFICULTY in your marriage, a difficulty IN YOUR HOME, A DIFFICULTY AT CHURCH, A DIFFICULTY ON THE JOB. YOU THERE MIGHT BE A HARDENING OF A HEART. And you say, "Why, Lord, did you go through that? Did you make me go through that? Why did I have to put UP WITH THAT?" WELL, IT'S JUST SO HE COULD GIVE YOU A TESTIMONY. HE WANTED TO ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY. SO, HE ALLOWED PEOPLE'S HEARTS TO BE HARDENED. AND MAYBE you were poor for a while. MAYBE YOU WERE SICK FOR A WHILE. MAYBE YOU STRUGGLED FOR A WHILE. BUT THE STRUGGLE WAS FOR THE TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; SEE, PHARAOH'S HEART HAD TO BE hardened &gt;&gt; so that he would pursue them &gt;&gt; out of Egypt. It wouldn't be enough. You ever think, "Why can't the devil just leave me alone?" You I felt like that a few times. Why don't the devil just leave me alone? It seems like I get a victory and I have a good service and I'm doing pretty good and ALL OF A SUDDEN, all of the SUDDEN I'M JUST SWEPT OFF MY FEET. HERE COMES THE ENEMY AGAIN. IT seemed like SOON AS WE WALK OUT THOSE DOORS, A LOT OF TIMES THE ENEMY COMES BACK. CAN ANYBODY TESTIFY WITH ME TONIGHT? IT SEEMS LIKE THE ENEMY COMES RIGHT BACK ON OUR TAIL AGAIN. WHY DOES HE DO THAT? GOD IS ESTABLISHING A TESTIMONY. You get sick and you get well and you seem like things are going good and then you get sick again. Or you GET A GOOD JOB SEEMS LIKE THINGS ARE GETTING GOOD AND YOU GET FIRED or or get laid off or something happens or you're not able to do it anymore. WH WHY? BECAUSE GOD IS ESTABLISHING A TESTIMONY. HE SAID THEY'LL SERVE ME NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON IN their life. So the testimony of the Egyptians drowning in the sea needed TO BE ESTABLISHED BY TWO OR three witnesses. &gt;&gt; So in order to do that, I'm going somewhere tonight. Just hang with me. In order to DO THAT, GOD HAD TO HARDEN PHARAOH'S HEART. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, we'll find Brother Random always tied Pharaoh to Hitler. HE SAID, "GOD HARDENED HITLER'S heart so HE COULD HAVE A testimony &gt;&gt; so that flag could fly over Israel again." &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that, church. I know there's a it's it's it's fashionable right now to bash Israel, but Israel as a nation is there because God hardened Hitler's heart &gt;&gt; and the tender hand of Jehovah drove them back into the homeland. Oh my. There's going TO BE 144,000 OF THEM THAT'LL be saved. IT WON'T BE ALL of them, BUT 144,000 THAT'LL be saved at the end time. Elected Jews that'll receive THE SAME HOLY GHOST THAT YOU have &gt;&gt; at Oh, come on, church. At the end time. Why? Because they'll be saved AS A NATION. THEY'LL BE SAVED IN A DAY. WHY? GOD'S GOING TO HAVE A TESTIMONY IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING HITLER TRIED TO DO. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING MUSSOLINI TRIED TO DO. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU GOT THE SAME TESTIMONY TODAY. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING, MAYBE THIS FAMILY MEMBER OR THAT family member or that church OR THAT PREACHER OR THAT PERSON IN YOUR LIFE, NO MATTER WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEIR HEART WAS HARDENED, GOD ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Why do we go through the things that we do? He's establishing a testimony. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He wants to establish a testimony in the hearts of our young people, &gt;&gt; right? Maybe maybe a different testimony than he established in our hearts, but it's still a testimony, &gt;&gt; right? You may not go through what I went through, but he's establishing a testimony, &gt;&gt; right? Your testimony might be, Lord, let me not be stubborn like my father. &gt;&gt; Now, that that's what he said, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He said that they wouldn't be stubborn like their fathers. And I think fathers who really understand would say, "Yes, Lord, I want that. I don't want my children to have to have as many hurdles as I went through." &gt;&gt; So, I want them to have a a a different testimony. Right? And they will because of your faithfulness to God. Because you were brought out of what you were brought out of. Your children have a different testimony, but they'll still have a testimony. So in Psalm 78:5, he says, "He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, they should make them known to their children, that the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children, that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, BUT KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, MIGHT NOT BE AS THEIR FATHERS." A stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart. So in other words, where we failed, we want our children to do better. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can we grasp that concept? We want our children TO DO BETTER, BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO HOW ARE WE GOING TO OUR children going to do better? Well, by our example, by our testimony, BY US TELLING THEM THIS IS WHAT I WAS, BUT THIS IS WHAT I AM TODAY. DON'T BE WHAT I WAS. BE what I am. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, so he said we he said they didn't set their heart right. The fathers didn't. But we want the children to do that. Look how Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 10:1. He said, "Moreover, brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all pass through the sea, and they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and they all drink the same spiritual drink. They drank of that spiritual rock that followed them. That rock was Christ." But with many of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. He said, "Now these things were our examples." This is these children's children's children's children. He's talking about he said to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. Neither be idolattors as were some of them as it is written that people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and 20,000. Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents. Be a murmur ye. Some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyers. SO WHAT'S PAUL SAYING? DON'T BE COMPLAINERS LIKE YOUR forefathers were. &gt;&gt; We could go somewhere with that, couldn't we? &gt;&gt; Right? DON'T DON'T DO THAT. GOD HELPED THEM AND GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRITUAL ROCK AND SPIRITUAL MANA AND YET they complained anyway. He said, "LET'S NOT BE LIKE THAT. LET'S LEARN FROM THEIR TESTIMONY AND HAVE A BETTER TESTIMONY." YEAH. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now all these things happened unto them for examples, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that thinkketh he standeth and take heed lest he fall. LET YOUR TESTIMONY BE ESTABLISHED in the word of God. Let your TESTIMONY BE ESTABLISHED THAT I'M going to make it." How many can have that testimony tonight? I'm going to make it. I don't have TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES of the past. I don't have to repeat my own mistakes. I don't have to repeat the MISTAKES OF MY FATHER. I DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF MY GRANDFATHER. BUT I AM AN OVERCOMER. I can live a VICTORIOUS LIFE. I BELONG IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I BELONG I BELONG WITH THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD PRAISING AND WORSHIPING GOD. I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DEAD COLD FORMAL RELIGION. I CAN BE ON FIRE FOR GOD. ARE YOU WITH ME TONIGHT? LET ME NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF the past. Listen, I I had I was talking to a preacher here not long ago and he said, "Well, I wish things were like they were in the 70s and the 80s." I said, "I don't want to go back TO THAT. I WANT TO I want to live for now. I WANT TO SEE GOD MOVE US IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY were back then. I DON'T WANT THINGS LIKE THEY USED to be. I want to SEE THE YOUNG ONES COME UP AND BE ABLE TO WORSHIP GOD WITHOUT ALL THE FEAR AND THE CRITICISM a and the legalism that they had back then. &gt;&gt; That's good. that they can know who they are, come into full adoption in the age WHEN ALL THAT WE'RE ALL IN THE LAND WHERE ALL THE PROMISES LAY. OH, I'M GLAD THAT MY FATHERS AND MY FOREFATHERS AND PEOPLE THAT WERE OLDER THAN ME FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH, BUT LET ME GO ON INTO PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; Establish a testimony. Hallelujah. God established a testimony in the life of brother Brandham. I think we're all familiar with it. But he had a supernatural birth. &gt;&gt; I like come and now you don't have that testimony. I don't. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham did, &gt;&gt; right? And and I don't need that testimony. I need to believe it &gt;&gt; and then have my own testimony. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon makes this statement as he had so many supernatural things happen in his life but also made many mistakes. You say, "Brother Ben, how can you say that he was a prophet of God?" I say that because he was a human being &gt;&gt; and because that's what he said. But we don't dwell on his mistakes. We look at what God did in those mistakes in spite of those mistakes and how God used him. And I say, "God, if you could use me even 100th as much as you did him in spite of my mistakes, I can have my own testimony." Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, so brother Brandon says this. He said, "You help me." He he's about to tell his life story, his testimony. He said, "You help me as I start back from the beginning. When you put your hand on your poor humble servant, may all my mistakes today, may others and young boys and girls who's coming on, may they be stepping stones to bring them to thee. MAY THEY PROFIT FROM MY ERRORS of suffering that they might know you in the power of your resurrection." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, it's just as simple as not understanding. I I didn't have the benefit of being taught the opening of the word like these children are being taught from a young age. &gt;&gt; I didn't have the benefit of being taught how we could have confidence in the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; That's a big deal. &gt;&gt; But now our children are being TAUGHT THAT FROM A YOUNG AGE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? So I want my children though I didn't have that benefit. I had to come to that myself. But I want my children to go a little bit further than I did. Are you with me now? And where I made blunders and errors maybe early on, not understanding, not knowing WHERE I STOOD, NOT HAVING THE kind of, you know, when I when we first got married and and started out, we were pastoring a church and we needed a pastor. We really did, brother JT, but we were pastoring a church and and God was with us in spite of our errors and our blunders. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? But I WANT MY MY CHILDREN AND MY grandchildren that if the Lord carries and THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, I WANT THEM TO PROFIT FROM OUR ERRORS of suffering THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW YOU IN THE POWER of your resurrection. Oh God, let that be the truth. So we don't WANT OUR KIDS TO ACT JUST LIKE US. We want them to go on a higher level. Somebody's got to go in. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE THAT FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. WE WHICH ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD SHALL NOT HINDER THEM WHICH ARE ASLEEP. I BELIEVE IT'LL BE ME. BUT IF IT DON'T COME IN MY GENERATION, DON'T LET ME GET IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER GENERATION. Brother Brham said, if I don't have the faith to bring it to pass, HE SAID, I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY OF SOMEONE who has. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Again, he said, I want you to make my blunder stepping stones for you to Christ that you'll bypass that and especially the young people that's coming on and got life yet before them until they become of the age. He said, now you just look at my mistakes and don't try to pattern after them. But you just say now what brother Brandham did now I'm going to get past that. That's a powerful statement. How could we ever even get to what brother Brandham did? BUT HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT BEING A PROPHET. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT HAVING A SUPERNATURAL BIRTH. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. BUT JUST IN LIFE choosing the right thing, &gt;&gt; right? There was a time when brother Brandham chose not to go to the Pentecostal people when he should have went and he said it was a terrible mistake and he lost a baby and BUT HE SAID LET MY CHILDREN THESE CHILDREN MAKE A STEPPING STONE out of THAT &gt;&gt; THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE VOICE of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Even in the mistakes God was establishing a testimony. &gt;&gt; Is that is that what you can say tonight? even in my mistakes. &gt;&gt; He said, "But brother Ben, I made a terrible mistake. Don't beat yourself up too much." Because Jonah ended up in the belly of a well because he directly disobeyed God. &gt;&gt; And it's exactly where God wanted him. &gt;&gt; Did you know that &gt;&gt; he was in the belly of a well because he directly disobeyed God? And it's exactly where God wanted and needed him to be. Right? &gt;&gt; And if he hadn't been in the belly of the well, Nineveh would have never believed him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And we followed that trail before. Remember where if he if Nineveh hadn't believed, then the Assyrians would have never taken over of parts of Israel and they would have never moved the people away and brought the Samaritans in, &gt;&gt; right? And the woman at the well wouldn't have been there &gt;&gt; because there would have been no Samaritans if Jonah hadn't disobeyed God. BUT GOD TURNED HIS DISOBEDIENCE into a testimony. That's hard for us to understand, but that's the providence of God that we should always do the right thing, &gt;&gt; right? We should always do the right thing. We should do the right thing for the right reasons. But even when we make a mistake, EVEN WHEN WE STUMBLE, GOD'S ABLE TO TURN THAT INTO a testimony. He said he'll even take, IT'S ASTOUNDING TO ME. HE SAID HE'LL TAKE THE PERMISSIVE WILL OF GOD TO GLORIFY THE PERFECT WILL AS IF the permissive will makes the perfect will more perfect. Think about it. It was the permissive will of God that man fell. It was a permissive WILL OF GOD THAT they did what they did in the garden AND THAT MAN FELL. THAT WAS NOT THE PERFECT WILL OF GOD FOR them to sin. But yet it was the permissive WILL OF GOD THAT GAVE US A SAVIOR. IT WAS THE PER COME ON CHURCH. It was THE PERMISSIVE WILL OF GOD. I SHOULD SAY IT LIKE THIS. That allowed the conditions where a savior was needed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We should always strive for the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Because there will be a people that will go with that with the perfect will of God. Brother Brandon said, he said, "Brother, sister, if I ever want to be sincerious, it's now after all my mistakes is showing." He said reason I brought these messages previously that God shows there that he's merciful. He said Moses made his mistakes a great man like him. Then when Joshua come up he was going to make his too. But God said as I was with Moses so will I be with you. &gt;&gt; Look at God two years ago he said pointing that scripture right to me. As I was with Moses so I'll be with you. He said I'll not look at your mistakes. Aren't you glad he can tell you that today? &gt;&gt; He said I'll not look at your mistakes. He knew that this hour was coming. Now it's here. He said see right back again. Because God never God could never get away from it. He said, "When I think of Abraham, all the mistakes he made in Moses and his mistake, but when Abraham's commentary was written, when the divine commentary was written, when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary, he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief." No, he said never was even accounted to him, he said, Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, BUT WAS STRONG GIVING PRAISE to God. He said, "My humble prayer is before the grace of God that's here this morning," he said, "I hope mine's wrote like that, that he won't see my mistakes. AND WHEN MY COMMENTARY IS WRITTEN, my obituary, it won't be read out that I made mistakes and done wrong." Oh, come on. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THE GRACE OF GOD? AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR A TESTIMONY, HE'S ESTABLISHING A TESTIMONY. HE SAID THAT WHEN I made mistakes and done wrong, but he'll only see the things I tried to do for him. He said, "May they just become?" HE SAID, "WHAT DOES THAT take the grace of God that I BELIEVE IN?" HE SAID, "AND that's where I'm SOLELY TRUSTING. FOR UPON MY OWN MERITS, I COULD NO MORE GO IN THAN NONE OF THE REST, BUT UPON THE GRACE OF GOD, I'M DEPENDING." Aren't you glad for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, this scripture is still true. 1 John 2:1, "My little children, these things write I unto you that you sin not." Right? It's not the it's it it's not the will of God for any man to sin. &gt;&gt; And it's any man's sin. That's the humanity clause, right? So, it's like he puts in the bold print, I write these things unto you that you sin not. And then the humanity clause. Now, if you sin willfully and you sin because you want to, you need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You need something to change that desire. But if you make a mistake, he said, "If any man sin, we have an advocate." In other words, an attorney, an attorney on retainer, if you would say it like that. We have an attorney with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Oh, aren't you glad for an advocate today? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now, Father God, we thank you for these hands that come up for to be Christians. I believe they meant it in their hearts. I pray for them that they will not any time fail. That's the way we want it for our children, isn't it? For our young people. I PRAY FOR THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT ANY time fail. I don't want you to ever fail. But listen, he's now here's the humanity clause. And if they do fail, make quickly they have that advocate with the father which I have learned to be such a great thing. Hallelujah. FATHER THAT WHEN I MAKE ALL my mistakes, THEN I FIND OUT I HAVE AN ADVOCATE RIGHT QUICK WITH THE father through Jesus CHRIST AND I'M BROUGHT BACK INTO GRACE AGAIN. The loving hand of the LORD WIPES AWAY. THERE'S A BLOODY SACRIFICE LAYING THERE that I confess to BE MY SAVIOR. LISTEN, DON'T WALLOW IN YOUR MISTAKES. THERE'S NO SHAME IN FALLING DOWN. IT'S WHEN YOU FALL DOWN AND STAY THERE AND YOU WALLOW IN UNBELIEF. BUT GET BACK UP AND SAY, "LORD, LORD, I MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE, BUT I HAVE AN ADVOCATE WITH THE FATHER." &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ben, YOU PREACHED THAT TOO MUCH. I'LL NEVER PREACH IT ENOUGH." BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES TILL THE DAY YOU DIE. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO PERFECTLY FOLLOW THE WILL OF GOD IN THIS BODY. THAT'S WHY HE'S GOT TO GIVE YOU A NEW BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you could perfectly follow the word, the letter of the law in this body, you wouldn't need a body change. &gt;&gt; So, a testimony has to be established. A testimony was established in Jacob. A testimony still stands today in Israel. A testimony was established in God's prophet. We know that he established a testimony in William Brandon. and and a testimony has been established in the bride. See, he come in the fullness of the word to us. Do you realize, and I don't want to, how can I put this and not sound like I'm I'm I'm demeaning because brother Brandham at any point in his life was a prophet, &gt;&gt; right? He was born a prophet. &gt;&gt; But there's things about the message that we understand today that brother Brandham didn't understand until late in his life. He didn't know what the seals were &gt;&gt; until he preached them, &gt;&gt; right? He said, "I was about to make an awful mistake &gt;&gt; and then he went and preached the truth because the angel of the Lord." But we have the benefit of hindsight, &gt;&gt; right? That that we can stand on his shoulders, &gt;&gt; right? And see farther &gt;&gt; even than he could at a younger age. &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? Not being prophets, &gt;&gt; not being ANYTHING SPECIAL, JUST SOMEBODY that can read. can understand more about the mysteries of God today than even a prophet understood at a certain time because it wasn't open yet. But God came in the fullness of the word in our day. This is so important, church. HE CAME TO ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY &gt;&gt; SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST. So we wouldn't be just another group or another denomination with another reformer, &gt;&gt; another Wesley or another Luther. HE CAME IN THIS HOUR WITH THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A FULL THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; We could do things the right way. WE COULD LIVE THE RIGHT WAY. WE COULD BELIEVE the right thing. WE COULD WE COULD TRUST HIM IN HIS FULLNESS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; So again, now watch. There was a written word and the people had faith in that written word and then so then they testified you know but you can testify even before it happens. You testify of what's written in the word pretty soon you'll be testifying of what God did &gt;&gt; how he manifested that in your own life. &gt;&gt; So first they testified what was written and then they that's why God TOLD MOSES WHY CRY SPEAK. &gt;&gt; He said speak AND GO FORWARD. WHAT WAS IT? A TESTIMONY. GOD SAID GO, SO WE'RE GOING TO GO. AND WHEN THEY WALKED IN, THE TESTIMONY BECOME A REALITY &gt;&gt; and they could rejoice on the other side of the Red Sea. So God spoke through a prophet and he revealed. Now we find Revelation 10 1-7. We're going to read that just a moment, but that's the written word, but it didn't mean a lot to a lot of people. Am I going over your head for a Wednesday night? I hope not. I think this would be simple to us. Revelation 10:1-7 was the written word revealed to a prophet hidden from the public but revealed to the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? Revelation 10:1 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven. Brother Brham said only Christ it could be &gt;&gt; right clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was upon his head. His face as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. There's a written word but it's been opened. He set his right foot upon the sea, his left foot on the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. When he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." I know you think I'm starting another sermon, but I'm almost done. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand. Am I doing okay, brother Josh? Are we still good on time? That's good. That's That's why he's here, Josh. It says, "THE ANGEL WHICH I SAW STAND UPON the sea and upon the earth." What did he do? Now, come on. We We know this. We've been taught this. He lifted up his hand to heaven. Why? &gt;&gt; He was swearing an oath. &gt;&gt; What was it? What is that? Giving a testimony. &gt;&gt; That's why when you raise your hands in church, you're not just doing what other people do, but when you raise YOUR HAND, YOU'RE DEFYING THE LAW OF GRAVITY, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Purposely giving a testimony. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WHEN YOU SING MY GOD IS AWESOME AND YOU RAISE YOUR HAND? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M HERE TO TESTIFY MY GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD. When you RAISE YOUR HAND DURING THE PREACHING, YOU'RE SAYING WHAT THE PREACHER'S SAYING, I SAY AMEN TO IT. SO BE IT. AND I RAISED MY HAND IN TESTIMONY THAT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT HOW WHAT GOD DID IN HIS LIFE, I CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE AND SEE THE VERY SAME GOD WORKING. I'M ADDING MY OWN SWORN TESTIMONY. THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO RAISE OUR HANDS high &gt;&gt; in the house OF GOD TO LIFT OUR HANDS IN THE HOUSE OF GOD IN WORSHIP. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S A SWORN TESTIMONY. THESE THINGS ARE TR THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's our testimony. The angel, hallelujah, made had a testimony AND HE LIFTED UP HIS hand to heaven AND SWEAR BY HIM that liveth forever and ever created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are there in that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. So that's the written word. &gt;&gt; Then God calls a prophet into the desert, right? &gt;&gt; To do what? &gt;&gt; To establish a testimony. He even told him, "Bypass your troubles." He said, "If you stay here, you'll have trouble." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. You remember the boy that in the vision, Brother Brandham saw himself kicking him down the hill? the young guy from the brother Brandon was still human, &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes in business deals, we get that like we want to act like that. But God told Brother Brandham, he said, "Byppass your trouble. Don't do that." Said, "Go west." So God put him out in the desert. Brother Brand said it was a spiritual desert. His family suffered, right? It was it was a hard place to be out in the desert, but he was there for a reason because Revelation 10 had to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So God had a testimony. He had a testimony of the written word. But now that written word was going to be manifested. There was going to be I hope you recognize what's happened in our day that that actually God came down in word form in our day and he caused himself to be seen even as the angels were there with brother Brandham. carried him away in that into the cloud and he was lifted up and when he come back to the ground again that that that cloud goes away either as it was going or as it was coming that cloud was his picture was taken &gt;&gt; right I know there's been a lot of controversy about that but look the picture was taken now the Bible says that he'll make even your enemies be at peace with you and in this case brother Brandham brother Brandham was uh he he he he talked a lot about science being the enemy of God. And then Science magazine, we we see the one in Life magazine a lot, but Science magazine carried a picture of of the cloud that if you turn it to the right is the face of Christ. Right? Now, again, you say, "Well, how did it get there?" I don't know how it got there. I know it was it looked like Jesus when it was there. And the significance of it to us is that to a believer, it caused us to have a testimony, right? It was something significant to us. Now, it wasn't meant for the unbeliever. It was meant for the believer. &gt;&gt; I believe it was God. I believe it was supernatural. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But no matter what what you might say, people have all kinds of But it's interesting to me, even the people who try to pick it apart and say it was just a rocket or anything else, what they don't realize is they're actually testifying that it was there. &gt;&gt; Right? We didn't make this up. in their attempt. Hallelujah. So, I run across this the other day, but they gave on the internet. So, I went looking and I just typed in cloud picture 1963. And this is what comes up. So, if you pull it, if you type it in, you'll see a couple of entries and one of the first entries you see is is a website dedicated to destroying Brother Random's ministry with a picture of the cloud on the website. I about did a jig. And I don't care what they say about it. God's making his enemies testify. JUST LIKE HE HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART. HALLELUJAH. AND HE MADE HIS ENEMIES TESTIFY THAT THE WORD WAS TRUE. HE'S GOING TO MAKE HIS ENEMIES TESTIFY THAT THE WORD IS TRUE. IT DID HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO IT IT SHOWED UP IN THE MAGAZINE, IN LIFE MAGAZINE, in Look magazine, in Science magazine. He made his enemies testify. Now, WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT AM I DOING TONIGHT? I'M TELLING MY CHILDREN &gt;&gt; SO THEY CAN TELL THEIR CHILDREN SO THAT IF THERE'S ANOTHER GENERATION, THEY CAN TELL THEIR CHILDREN DOWN TO THE FIFTH GENERATION. LISTEN, A LOT OF US, WE'RE ALMOST IN THAT FIFTH GENERATION NOW. WE'VE BEEN TELLING OUR CHILDREN, GOD DID SOMETHING IN OUR DAY. NOW, GO GET YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; GET YOUR TESTIMONY. GET FILLED WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. GOD HAS MADE A TESTIMONY IN our day. &gt;&gt; HE HAS ESTABLISHED A TESTIMONY IN OUR HEARTS THAT THE WORD HAS BEEN OPENED. What is it? What is it? It's our turn. Now, if you go Revelation 10:1-7, we know was fulfilled in Brother Brandham's time. But all you have to do is go to the next scripture, the next verse, Revelation 10:8. And something else happens. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again. Who's me? Was John. &gt;&gt; Me was John. To put it like some of the kids would. Me was John. And who was John? A type of the bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And said, "Go take the little book which is open. It's either open or closed. It's open." In the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel. And said to him, "Give me the testimony." Are you with me? The written testimony. &gt;&gt; Give me the written testimony. Give me the little book. And he said to me, "Take it and eat IT UP. IT SHALL make thy belly bitter, BUT IT SHALL BE IN thy mouth sweet as honey. &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, MY BELLY WAS BITTER. AND HE SAID UNTO ME, "THOU." COME ON, CHURCH. SOMEONE SAY IT WITH ME. THOU, &gt;&gt; WHO was that? You. Me. &gt;&gt; Right. Thou is you and me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Me going TO TESTIFY. &gt;&gt; THOU GOING TO TESTIFY. I'M GOING TO TESTIFY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S MY TIME TO SPEAK. OH, COME ON. IF THERE EVER WAS A TIME FOR A PREACHER TO PREACH, THIS IS THE TIME A PREACHER OUGHT TO PREACH. NO WONDER THE DEVIL WANTS TO SHUT DOWN PREACHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A TESTIMONY NOW. JUST LIKE THERE WAS BACK THEN WHEN GOD DROWNED THE EGYPTIANS IN THE RED SEA, THERE'S A TESTIMONY TODAY. GOD KEEPS HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; A prophet stood up. Listen, I got to finish this. I got about five more minutes. I'm done. The word testified of it. The prophet testified of it. &gt;&gt; But what does the scripture say? by the mouth of two or three &gt;&gt; witnesses. &gt;&gt; So God wasn't going to have a partial testimony, but the word AND THE ANGEL AND THE PROPHET testified of the same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So 2 Corinthians 13:1, Paul establishes that. He said, "This is the third time I'm coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established." Brother Brandham said, he said, "Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord God. We're at the end time. The word, the prophet, AND THE ANGEL. ALL three of them together, one great testimony. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; The word, the prophet, and the angel testify. Now, now you say, "But how can I have a three witnesses?" Well, the word, the written word, and the prophet, and the Holy Spirit RIGHT WITHIN YOU GOT TO TESTIFY THE SAME THING. And when YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY WITH THE WORD, WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY WITH THE PROPHET, WHAT HAPPENS? YOU ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY IN YOUR OWN LIFE THAT CAN GO ON TO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. I TELL YOU, DON'T EVER GIVE UP ON THIS MESSAGE. DON'T EVER SAY IT DON'T MATTER BECAUSE THERE'S A TESTIMONY IN IT. &gt;&gt; It'll do something for you. &gt;&gt; So he said, "A TRUE PROPHET WILL ALWAYS AGREE WITH THE WORD AND ANY ANGEL WILL TESTIFY TRUTH." HE SAID, "WE'RE ready for marching orders." Do you BELIEVE IT, CHURCH, BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES? And listen WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE STOOD THERE and and what is the attraction ON THE MOUNTAIN? HE SAID TWO OR three he SAID THREE YEARS AGO THIS WAS PROPHECY. HE SAID NOW IT'S BECOME HISTORY. WHAT WAS HE TELLING US? GOD TESTIFIED OF HIS TRUTH. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful of that church. I &gt;&gt; I'm done tonight. Let's just let's just rejoice in that fact AS THE MUSICIANS COME. I'M SO THANKFUL HE ESTABLISHED A TESTIMONY. I'M SO THANKFUL THAT THE WORD STILL WORKS. WHEN YOU SAY, "WELL, IT HASN'T WORKED FOR ME." IF YOU'LL BELIEVE IT, IF YOU'LL AGREE WITH THE PROPHET AND THE WRITTEN WORD, THE WORD will work in your life. THE ANGEL WILL COME DOWN AND ENFORCE THE WORD in your life. I'm so thankful he established a testimony in my life. I'm so thankful. I was listening to brother Josh's testimony. I said, Lord, THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE DOES. BROTHER JOSH DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT IT WAS THE SAME GOD THAT CALLED BROTHER BRANDHAM. THAT SAME GOD THAT SPOKE TO HIM IN THE IN THE TREE WAS THE SAME GOD PUT HIS HAND OVER BROTHER JOSH JUST OUT ON THAT DAY. WAS THE SAME GOD THAT SPOKE TO ME IN A BASEMENT. WAS THE SAME GOD, BROTHER JOE, THAT GOT YOU. THE SAME GOD THAT GAVE EVERY ONE OF US OUR TESTIMONIES. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD IS STILL THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. WE DON'T FOLLOW A NEW RELIGION. WE'VE GOT A WE GOT A NEW CASE OF THE OLD RELIGION. &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW? GOD KEEPS HIS WORD. HE HAS ESTABLISHED a testimony AND WE CAN TELL OUR CHILDREN, our grandchildren, all the way down to the fifth generation what God did for us. Hallelujah. Aren't you grateful? Why don't we just stand together? Why don't we just worship him a moment? If you need prayer, the altar's open, but aren't you glad he established a testimony? I believe we're Christians here tonight. Let's just worship him with all of our heart. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will praise the Lord. What are you doing? Swearing a testimony. I will praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord. Oh, no matter what. Oh, thank you, Lord. What it has in store? I I will praise the Lord. Have you heard testimony in your life? Let's sing it together now. I will praise the Lord. I'm so thankful. Oh, I I will praise you, Lord. Oh, no matter what tomorrow. Praise. Thank you, Lord. What it has in store. Oh, I will praise. Oh, thank you. Oh, I will praise the Lord. Yes, I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise. Can we worship him just before we go? Oh, I will praise the Lord. Yes, I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise. If that sounds good, let's sing it to him again. Oh, I will praise the Lord. Yes, I will praise the Lord. No matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise the Lord. Can we give the Lord a hand clap of praise? My God is awome. He can move mountains. Keep me in the valley. Hide me from the rain. My God is awome. Heals me when I'm broken. strength where I've been weakened forever he will reign. My God is awome. He's awome.
