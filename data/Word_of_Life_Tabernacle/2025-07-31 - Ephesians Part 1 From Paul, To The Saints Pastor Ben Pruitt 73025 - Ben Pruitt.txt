So looking forward to a good time on that. Also on Sunday on Sunday night will be communion service. So we're looking forward to that this week. Amen. How many's looking forward to a good time in the Lord tonight? Amen. And I believe the word's going to go forth and just just touch our hearts this evening. I mean, what if you get what you expect, we say that all the time, but you only are going to get what you expect out of the service tonight. If you expect to find fault, you're going to find fault. But if you expect to be blessed and fed tonight, you're going to be blessed and fed. So, we're looking forward to that. Let's sing this song with all of our hearts now. Sing the first verse. Oh, the blood that Jesus shed for me. Oh, way back on Calary. [Music] The blood that gives me strength. Oh, from day to day, it will never, never, never lose its power.

Thank you, Jesus, for the grace you've given us. Aren't you thankful for the grace tonight? Amen. I I tell you what, from my You can't repay the love that he's given you, but the least we can do is worship him here tonight and receive what he's given back to us in the way of his word with all of our hearts now. Oh, thank you. Thank you Jesus [Music] for the grace that you have given us. [Music] And though I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I I thank you. All your hearts now say thank you.

I want to say thank you Jesus. Oh I thank you Lord for the grace that you have given us. Oh thank you Lord. Oh, from my heart, I'd like to say I [Music] bow our heads together for a moment. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be in your house again tonight to thank you, Jesus, for the things that you've given us. Most of all, forgiving yourself, oh, Lord, as a propitiation for our sin. We thank you for that tonight, Lord. I pray that you'd move in a mighty way in this service tonight, Lord. Just move me aside so that you can speak what you would have to the people. Pray for revelation tonight. Lord, your prophet told us to pray for revelation more than anything else. I pray Lord that revelation would be in our lives tonight. That the word of God would be revealed as only your spirit can do it. We'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You love him tonight. Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to see everybody made it out on a Wednesday night. And I know there's several traveling right now, but we praying for them. Uh different ones that are out traveling, vacation, stuff before school starts, you kids ready for school? Boy, I didn't get a very enthusiastic response, did I? &gt;&gt; But it's getting close. So, but we sure uh sure appreciate our our young ones. And as brother Joel said, we have communion on Sunday night. So, remember that. Ephesians chapter 1. I want to go to the book of Ephesians. We've preached out of it before, but I've never taken the book and just did a study on it. We're going to do that, Lord willing, uh over the next weeks, a few weeks. And uh maybe that'll be something that we can uh pull together on and and just study the word of God and and so you'll have time to read it. It's not a long book. You'll have time to read it and study it. And also the adoption series if you go to that where brother Brandon preaches adoption number one through number four in 1960. If you want to go listen to that, it'll have a lot of what we're going to say in that as well. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one, Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Aren't you glad for that tonight? we should be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. The book of Ephesians teaches us about our placing, our election, predestination. Godhead, redemption, salvation, mercy, the Holy Ghost, God's eternal purpose, speaks about faith and love. Talks about the ministry gifts in the church, Christian living, kindness, morality, worship, husbands and wives, uh, children, even gets on children, the workplace, and spiritual warfare. in six chapters, &gt;&gt; 2422 Greek words, 3,022 words in the KJV, which is about the same number of words that I use in a single set of notes to preach from. And and yet Paul writes a masterpiece in that. I believe the Holy Spirit wrote it. &gt;&gt; I believe he inspired him to write it. &gt;&gt; Alexander Scorby, if you go online, you'll find he reads it in 19 minutes. So you could go home and read. In fact, I did that several times. I listened to it several times in the last few days. You can go home probably before most of you could get home, you could listen to it or read it. And then brother Brandham preaches those four sermons on adoption as well as several other sermons about the book of Ephesians. But in adoption, brother Brandham teaches us that the book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament book of Joshua. And he said that Moses, he said, was a type of Christ who brought the people uh out of Egypt. H but Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost bringing the people into the land and placing them in the land. So the book of Ephesians is our placing in Christ. So brother Brandham takes the adoption series and it's a verse by verse study of the first three chapters of the book of Ephesians. And I want to take that and also the rest of the book as well if the Lord allows us to do that. But Brandham said Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally. He said you notice Joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land. Then he divided the land. He from here Manasses here this one here, Gad here, Benjamin here. And you talked about how those Hebrew mothers identified their sons. Now we've just been through that as kind of a precursor to this study. we've been through that and how that God identified each one and how they fit just perfectly in the land. Do you believe God does that for us as well? He knows where we fit, you know, where we belong. He knows all about us and so we don't have to worry. I I know a lot of times things come up in the church and because people are concerned that maybe they're position, they think, well, maybe I don't do a good enough job or maybe nobody appreciates it. Maybe nobody nobody wants me around. Maybe I don't have any purpose in the church. But I believe every one of us have a purpose. We just have to find it. And you don't have to worry. God will place you where he wants you to be. You don't have to force it or try to make it happen. God will put it there and make it make you able to do it. And and so uh we he placed them in the land just as Joshua placed the people in the land. So Paul, uh by the by the leadership of the Holy Ghost, the inspiration of the Holy Ghost places the church in their proper place in Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Ephesians begins with Paul stating his name. He said, 'I, Paul. If you'll find a letter. You know, most of us when we write a letter, how do we write a letter? We write a letter. Uh, good to have sister Luella with us tonight. Thank you for being here with us. When you write a letter, you start uh you you don't start out I Benjamin, right? Most of us start a letter, we'll say, you know, tell what we want to tell and then at the end we write we sign it. But Paul didn't do it that way. He says I Paul because that's the way an important letter would be written something you want him to know who was writing right and so Paul is claiming his authority to write at the very beginning of this he doesn't he doesn't defend his calling in this book in the same way as he does to the Corinthians but he still reminds them who is writing so he says Paul and the Ephesians would know that Paul that meant something that somebody important was writing to them because Paul was their the founder. He was their former pastor. He had spent two years with them there in Ephesus and he had been uh he he had he he'd set the church and he'd put them in order. And so they they he didn't have to defend his calling in the same way he does in other places, but he still reminds them who is writing. But to understand any letter correctly, if somebody writes you a letter, you've got to know who it is from and who it is to. &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to deal with tonight. And we may not get past the first verse, but I want to what I want to deal with is I Paul, he says Paul to the believer, the faithful in Christ Jesus, to the church. So Paul writing to the saints. Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; Paul writing to the saints. You need to know who it's from and you need to know who it's to. And that helps you better understand the letter itself. So once you know the author and the intended recipient, you're able to determine the meaning or or what brother Random calls read between the lines, &gt;&gt; right? So this this was a prison epistle. This was a letter actually written from prison. So if you have a a letter that is written to you and and you get it and on the outside of it, it says uh uh you know the correctional facility, whatever Alcatraz or whatever that it might be. you get that letter, you might look at that and think, well, what in the world? Why is somebody writing to me from prison? And if you get a prison letter, it would depend on whether you wanted to open or not might depend on uh who it is that you your loved one or whoever it is that might be in prison. But they knew who it was that Paul had been put in prison not for the sake of being a murderer or a extortioner or a thief, but he'd been put in prison because of the gospel. And so he's sitting there in prison writing about the wonderful things of God. And it tells me that no matter what goes on in our lives, no matter what's happening right now, we can still think about the things of God, we can still dwell on the goodness of God and the predestination in our lives. And election because predestination is not subject election is not subject to what's going on in our life right now, but it's God's overarching plan in our life. He's he's got something for us to do. He's got something a plan for us, and we got to rest in that plan. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we read between the lines when we read the Bible. I mean, know Brandon taught us that we read between the lines. &gt;&gt; So, he said, "It's like a love letter from my wife." He said, "If she writes me a letter and she says, I'm just sitting here, the children are all asleep." He said, "I know what she means, &gt;&gt; right? I read between the lines, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and I find that it's a love letter, right, to me because of the one who's writing it." And brother Brenam says this. He said, "If you're in love with God and God's spirit is in you, the Holy Spirit himself is the interpreter of this word." So when we read the book of Ephesians, we ought to be able to look at it and say, "Lord, I know this is from the Apostle Paul. I know he was a man of God. I know he was the first church age messenger, but I know it's important. And then I know it wasn't just him, but it was a it was an inspiration from you. And I know if you wrote it, Lord, then it must be a love letter to me. Must be something in it that's going to help me when I'm down. Help me when I'm discouraged. Help me when I'm upset. Must be something in it that'll do good for me during life on earth. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So, this letter was written from prison and it was important as he took the time to write it to the Ephesian church. So he begins by saying, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God." An apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. Now, I want to ask you a question tonight as we're uh just studying these things. Why were Paul's letters preserved? Why Why do we Why do they matter? &gt;&gt; And I know you're looking at me like, "Brother Ben, we know why they matter. It's in the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; But why why is it why are they part of the Bible? Why do they matter? Why do we quote Paul? And I want to lead some into something on that because I know I get criticized sometimes because I quote brother Brandham a lot and and yet we and we use a lot of scripture as well. But why do we quote Paul? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; The Ephesian church would have understood why Paul was writing to them and what authority he was writing under that he was vindicated by God to be the messenger to the age. And all he has to tell them is Paul an apostle by the will of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, my denomination didn't make me an apostle. My association didn't make me an apostle. Brother Brandham said it this way. He said God made him an apostle. No elders laid hands on him. No bishop sent him anywhere. But God called him and made him an apostle. &gt;&gt; So you look at the authority that Paul takes and he takes that in Galatians chapter 1. Uh if you go back and read Galatians, someone told me they just listened to Galatians. It's a it's a good book to listen to prior to Ephesians. If you look at verse 8, it says, "Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be a cursed." So Paul's saying, "Even if I came back to you and preached something different from what I already said." Now that's taking authority right there. and saying what I already said was so correct that even if I come back and preach something else to you because the correctness wasn't about it just being Paul but it was because it was inspired by God. The message was from God. And so he said even if I came back and tried to preach something different it wouldn't be right. If an angel from heaven came and taught you anything that wasn't in the word it wouldn't be right. Oh church, I think we ought to we ought to stand firm on the foundation that God has called the the ones who wrote the Bible, the men who wrote the Bible and in our age of prophet to interpret the Bible. God called them. God made them. They're authority comes from God. It don't come from me. I didn't make Brother Brandham a prophet. I didn't make Paul a prophet and an apostle. God made them that. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. So of course if they wrote something to us or left something for us, we want to know what they said. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; So he said though we do that if we come back and that's no ordinary preacher, &gt;&gt; right? I couldn't say that. &gt;&gt; I could not stand up here and say if I come and preach anything different than I've ever preached, then let me be accursed. Right? Because the truth is I I'm fallible. I might see something different than what I saw before. But if a message comes from God, &gt;&gt; right? If a message comes from God, the message itself that came from God is always right. &gt;&gt; Right? Because God don't make no mistakes. &gt;&gt; The man might make a mistake. The preacher might make a mistake. Even a prophet might make a mistake in his flesh. But but a but the message is not a mistake. &gt;&gt; Because the message comes from God. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm an apostle by the will of God." In Galatians 1:9, he said, "As we said before, so say I." Now again, any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. A cursed is the word anathema, which means devoted to destruction, which is the word used of uh you remember the Old Testament of of uh the man who took the Achen who took the wedge of gold, right? He He took the oursed thing, something that had been devoted to destruction. God said, "Destroy all of it." And they didn't do it. Saul got in trouble for the same thing, for keeping alive things which were devoted to destruction. But he said, "If someone preaches something different, let him be devoted to destruction." He said, "Do I now persuade men or God? Do I seek to please men?" He said, "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. &gt;&gt; But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man. I neither received it a man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Listen how he's he's he's saying something when he says, "I'm an apostle by the will of God." He's saying, "My message didn't come just from my mind. It didn't come from being taught it by somebody." It didn't come from reading commentaries. It didn't come from those things, though they may have done. Paul did all of those things. He was a very learning man, but he said, "I've got to for I had to forget everything I knew in order to have Christ." And brother Random tells us the same thing. He says that I was about to make a horrible mistake. Go with what someone else taught. He said, "But the angel come down and corrected me." &gt;&gt; Right? You can trust a message like that. &gt;&gt; Are are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So in he said, "I didn't receive it of man. I wasn't taught it." He said, "You heard of my conversation in time past in Jews religion." He said, "How that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers." &gt;&gt; But when it pleased God, &gt;&gt; oh my, he wasn't called by man. &gt;&gt; When it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, &gt;&gt; right? and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me. But I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus. After 3 years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him 15 days. But he said other the apostles saw I none say James the Lord's brother. He said now the things which I write unto you, behold before God I lie not. Afterwards, I came into the regions of Syria and Cissia was unknown by faith under the churches of Judea which were in Christ. So he said, I I wasn't even my fellowship wasn't even with them. I they didn't even know who I was by faith. But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed. What a testimony. &gt;&gt; And they glorified God in me. So what did God do? He's saying when he's saying I'm an apostle by the will of God, he's saying God separated me from my mother's womb to bring the book of Ephesians. You believe it's important? &gt;&gt; God called him from his mother's womb to bring this book so that we could hear it. So that we could preach it, so that we can read it and study and understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now you bear with me for just a moment. Brother Brandham has the same authority &gt;&gt; as Paul. He's a major prophet, a messenger to the age, &gt;&gt; but a different purpose, &gt;&gt; right? The same authority, a different purpose. I want even our young ones to understand this because it's important. So, Brother Brandham did not come to write a new Bible. I got a new Bible. My kids got me one. I didn't think they got me anything for my birthday. And I'm so proud of this. I had to bring it out. They brought me They got me a new Bible. Just was delayed getting here. It just tells you sometimes you don't know everything, right? get down about stuff and you just don't know everything. God's got something special in the mail. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brandham had had the authority of Paul. I know that's that's hard for some people to take, but he was either a prophet or he was not. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Right. He was either a word prophet or he was not. And he was a word prophet. There was a theologian that asked brother Brandham. He said, "With your experience, the Lord has given you for his people." He said, "You would be eligible to write a Bible yourself, your word, if God has manifested." I said, "That might be true." See, he was trying to catch me. I said, "But you see, I couldn't do that." He said, "Why couldn't you? You have all the qualifications." But remember what Paul said. He said, "If I came back, &gt;&gt; though he was a vindicated prophet, but he said, "If I came preach something else other than what you've heard, let him be accursed." Right? So he said, he said, 'Look, one word cannot be taken or added or taken away. He said, 'Well, them seven thunders, see that them seven thunders blasting out, won't that be a revelation be given to some man? I said, no, sir. That ought to be enough to knock that doctrine out of the window, right? &gt;&gt; He said, it won't be a revelation given to some man. I said, no, sir. It' be adding something to it or taking something from it, right? &gt;&gt; He said, it's all revealed in there. And the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was. So it's written in the scripture, but the seven seals opened up the revelation of it what it was. He said that's what it was. See, it's still in the word. See, you can't get out of that word. It won't leave the word. Anything that's not in the Bible that you hear, you say, "Well, that may be true, may not be true." But if it's not, if it's foundation is not in the scripture, I don't care who said it, how qualified they are to say it. If the foundation is not in the scripture, it didn't come from the word of God. It comes from the bottomless pit. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. which is Catholic dogma has no foundation. So it was a bottomless pit. I don't want my doctrine I don't want what I hang my soul on to come out of a bottomless pit. I want what I hang my soul on to have a sure foundation, a firm foundation built by the apostles and prophets. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon said God's spirit will never leave the word. Someone say never. &gt;&gt; Never leave the word. You said well I got the spirit of God. If you got the spirit of God it'll never leave the word. Right? &gt;&gt; It'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others. It'll always do that. So the seventh angel messenger would not write another Bible, but he would finish the mystery. All the loose ends would be tied up by his message. So the message is not another Bible. It's the authoritative interpretation of the Bible. &gt;&gt; See, if I'd get up here and and I have before, and I'd see nothing wrong with quoting Adam Clark or John Calvin. Those men wrote things that help me. But if I quote them, when I quote them, I'm quoting a man's interpretation, &gt;&gt; right? It may be right, it may be wrong, but that's what I'm quoting. I'm quoting someone who chose to study and give their interpretation of it. The same as if I would look at it and study and try to give my interpretation of it. But when I quote a prophet, the prophet of the age, I quote a man chosen by God to be a prophet, a divine interpreter of the word. &gt;&gt; He was a man. He made mistakes. He was not writing scripture. And that's where so many people get mixed up. They think, "Well, it's scripture. It's not scripture." But his interpretation of scripture was authorized by God, vindicated by God. He was a prophet by the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad for that. So, when we look at the book of Ephesians, isn't it wonderful? We live in an age where our eyes have come open. So, we've got what Paul wrote in Ephesians, and we've got the authorized commentary, &gt;&gt; right? We've got the written word and the authorized commentary to the written word that lines up with the written word. And from that, we get things that no one else gets out of the book of Ephesians. &gt;&gt; If you want something fun, go look at the book of Ephesians sometime. Look at uh commentaries or look online on YouTube. They'll have a a quick uh sketch of the book of Ephesians. They'll talk about Ephesians. And after a while, you realize they don't know anything about the book of Ephesians. But a prophet of God was anointed by God and chosen by God from his mother's womb to go in the back part of God's mind and reveal something about the book of Ephesians that would help us in the age that we're living in. That would cause us to know where we stand and who we are. I'm so thankful for the message of the hour that would do that. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says this about his own message. He said, "I do believe what I've taught on the tapes." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think we can say that too. &gt;&gt; I believe every word of it. &gt;&gt; I would not feed the people the wrong thing. If I'm wrong, I pray that God will forgive me for it because it's the best of my understanding. It's not my job to correct the message. &gt;&gt; My job to believe it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And God God corrects his man. Keeps him right. &gt;&gt; Again, brother Bren said, "Oh word believers, give into my message." &gt;&gt; That's pretty strong, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Give into my message. Hear me. He said, "Not my message, but his message &gt;&gt; that he because the message didn't come, Paul's message didn't just come from him, but he said, "I'm an apostle by the will of God." &gt;&gt; Oh, church, if you could ever get that revelation even in your own self. You young people, get that revelation. I'm not a Christian by the will of man. I'm not I'm not a I'm not a a husband or a wife or whatever it is that you are. I'm not that by the will of man, but by the will of God. God made me what I am. God put me in the church. God placed me. What can shake me now? Because God has placed me and made me what I am. &gt;&gt; God made brother Brandham a prophet. God made Paul a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Give into my message. Not my message, but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth. You've got to choose from somewhere. You can't sit still after this. You got to make your choice." Again, he said, I know you you know all these things, but we're just laying it down here just so we get a real firm foundation for the book of Ephesians. He said it wasn't the angel his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. &gt;&gt; It's not a man, it's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was the messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He's the one that you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man. A man, his words will fail, but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad to be feeding today? Aren't you glad to have something to eat? I'm glad we've got emotion. I'm glad we've got sensation. And if it's a right sensation, I'm glad we've got gifts. I'm glad we got those things. But I'm so glad that we've got a word that we can feed on that when gifts fail and emotions fail and everything else fails. I can always go back to the word and know the word about me, what God thought about me and revealed through a prophet messenger will never change. &gt;&gt; No matter what a preacher says, no matter what Oh, come on, church. No matter what a church says, I'm not subject to that. But what God thought about me will never change from time and eternity. If God chose me, nobody can. Your school friends can't change that. The people out in the world, in the factory can't change that. People you work with, your family can't change that. Whatever God thought about you is imprinted in the mind of God forever. &gt;&gt; He can't be wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. See, brother Brandham's message was Paul's message &gt;&gt; because it was the message of Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Brother Brandham even stood there when he went beyond the curtain of time and the people there were were standing and and and brother Brandham said, well, he said, "You'll have to be judged." The man who was standing there, the one who was standing there with him said, "You'll have to be judged." Brother Brandham said, "Was Paul did Paul have to be judged with his crew?" &gt;&gt; Did he said, "There'll be rewards given out?" said, "Did Paul have to stand there with his group?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Well, if Paul's going goes in, I'll go in." He said, "Because because I preached the same thing Paul preached." &gt;&gt; He said, "Where Paul preached baptism by immersion in the name of Jesus Christ," he said, "I preach the same thing." And he said, "Millions beyond the curtain of time cried out, we're resting on that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we live in an era when modern theologians are denying the authority of Paul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Paul had to defend himself when he was here, but he would have to defend himself today. &gt;&gt; Most churches now teach that Paul's message is secondary to Jesus message &gt;&gt; when we know that it's Christ in Paul, &gt;&gt; right? Writing these things. But they teach that Paul's message was secondary because they don't want to have to deal &gt;&gt; with some of the scriptures Paul wrote. &gt;&gt; Paul talks about the mystery of the gentile age, the mystery of the rapture. Without Paul, we don't even know those things. &gt;&gt; The mystery of the church is the body of Christ. But the worldly church, they don't want to deal with 1 Corinthians 11, &gt;&gt; right? Where it talks about the women cutting their hair. They don't want to deal with Romans chapter 1. &gt;&gt; Yeah. where it talks about the debasement of man, the degradation of mankind until and womankind until they until they actually begin to lust after one another and things that begin to happen and what and it brought about a homosexual agenda and Paul lays it out and they say, "Well, that was Paul's opinion." &gt;&gt; You see that spirit that comes in that tries to tries to degrade the influence of Paul because they don't want you to believe the word because you can only be be saved by the whole word of God, right? by believing the word of God. But they they don't want you to believe that. And and the worldly church don't want you to believe that. But I think that's come down even in the message. I want to deal with one thing tonight just as an example. But I think that comes down even in the message at times that people today tend to deny the authority, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; of Paul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and by extension of a prophet &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; in our day but they're actually denying what Paul said right because we have a movement today that people you know they they don't want to go to church at all and and again if a person I'm not de Christianizing a person for doing that but the Bible said this is what Paul said he chapter 10 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together and people forsake it in different ways some forsake it out of doctrine right that they They just believe it's wrong to come together. They get that from a spirit, but it's not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They get it from a word, but not the word of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Right. But then there's others who forsake the assembling of ourselves together. I know I'm preaching to you on a Wednesday night, but y'all so y'all just you're faithful Christians here in the house of God, but some forsake the assembling of themselves together for personal reasons, &gt;&gt; right? Well, I don't like what's going on at the church, or I don't like what's happening over here. I I I'm I'm I'm struggling in my life or maybe maybe I got things going on. I'm too busy or it's just not important to me. &gt;&gt; But what does Paul say? &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another. That's what I'm doing tonight. Exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham says what Paul says, right? Because this is the commandment of the Lord. Well, the Brandon says the same thing Paul says. He said, "Now remember, go to church somewhere. Someplace, &gt;&gt; right?" Well, I think that's pretty good. That pretty much covers it all. Go to church. And brother Ben, where should I go to church? Somewhere. Someplace. You ought to go to church and count yourself among believers and raise your hands to God and worship God because he's a God worthy of worship. He's a God worthy of praise. &gt;&gt; Go to church somewhere, someplace. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Huh? &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 14:36 says, "What came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only?" So in other words, there were people that just kind of make made it up as they went along. And Paul said, "You Corinthians, are you just making this up? Did the word of God come out to you only? If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, 2 Thessalonians 3:14, "If any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, have no company with him that he may be ashamed." Paul says another place, "Mark them and avoid them." What is that? What What is that serious, church? &gt;&gt; We need to take it that serious. If God said it, if Paul said it, we need to say amen to it. I may not always be able to live up to it like I want to, but I've got to acknowledge the word of God is the absolute truth. Brother Bram said, "Our soul hangs by chain over hell." Do you realize that? He said that chain is the word of God. And a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. &gt;&gt; So we believe all the word. &gt;&gt; Listen, he had authority. Paul had authority, but it wasn't from man, from God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And he had authority, I'll just add this, that a pastor doesn't have. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. that that another preacher doesn't have. Paul had an authority beyond that &gt;&gt; because he had a certain job to do &gt;&gt; right at the beginning of the church age. And brother Brandham as well at the end of the church age, a different job but but similar in his authority. Ephesians chapter 1 verse one again going to keep going back to that first verse. But he said Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. So you found out who the letter's from. &gt;&gt; Let's find out who the letter's to. to the saints &gt;&gt; which are at Ephesus. When he said that, I said, "Praise God." That means he's writing to me. &gt;&gt; I think that's the way we ought to take the word of God. I'm reading the book of Ephesians and I'm going back into Ephesians and I'm looking and as I'm looking at Ephesians, he said, he said, "To the saints." Oh, he wrote that to me. Paul took the time in prison &gt;&gt; to write to me, &gt;&gt; right? Can we take it that personal? He took time to write to you. We ought to read it sometimes. &gt;&gt; Paul took the time to write to the saints which are at Ephesus. The saints which are at Ephesus. From Paul, the first church age messenger from Paul to the saints. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Saints is sanctified. One saints doesn't mean some Catholic saint, something that they pray to or kiss the ring of or the toe of or something like that. Somebody's got an image. Brother Brandon was not a saint because he was a prophet. He was a saint because he was sanctified. You are not a saint because of your position in the church. You're a saint because you've been sanctified. How are you sanctified? By being in Christ. By having the blood wash you from your sins, &gt;&gt; right? The same way I would be sanctified or anybody else. That's how you become a saint. You don't become a saint by being old. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or by being young &gt;&gt; by attending church. We've just talked about how important it is to come together. But that don't make you a saint. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. That don't make you a saint coming to church. You can go to church and not be a saint. But what makes you a saint is by being sanctified by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Again, look at that first verse again. Brother, well, let's go back. Brother Brandon says, "It means they've been called out, separated, and now been baptized by the Holy Spirit and are in Christ Jesus." That's what it takes to be a saint. And Ephesians 1:1 again, to the saints which are at Ephesus. So, it's Paul to the saints &gt;&gt; and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. There's something fascinating in this verse and that's that when brother Brandham picks this up I think every other commentator and myself when I read it I emphasize in my mind the word faithful &gt;&gt; right I picked that up and I emphasize the word faithful &gt;&gt; brother Brandham didn't do that you know that because I want to think of myself as faithful &gt;&gt; it got quiet I want to think of myself as faithful don't you want to think of yourself as faithful Right? I want to be one of the faithful in Christ. And there's faith. There's a faithfulness that we can have. &gt;&gt; But look, brother Brandham doesn't emphasize the word faithful. He emphasizes the word in &gt;&gt; in &gt;&gt; faithful in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you can only be faithful if you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? So the the these things are written from Paul, the messenger of the age of that first age and a messenger still to us by becoming a part of the of the scripture, the Bible. The messenger to the ones who are in Christ in Christ. That means that this message, this book wasn't written for everyone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was written for a particular audience. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because not everyone's going to be able to understand it. They're not going to be able to comprehend it. It's not going to mean anything to them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But the saints, it means something to the saints. It means something to those who are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I think there's a lesson there for us that and I've done it myself many times. We try to push the deep things of God on someone who's not in Christ &gt;&gt; and they read it and they don't understand it. But how could they? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. But Paul doesn't do that. &gt;&gt; Right. And I don't think we shouldn't mistreat people who don't understand. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or who don't believe what we believe. I think the way we treat them is a good indicator of who we are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. We ought to treat people right. No matter who they're God, help me to treat people right. No matter who they are, where they come from, or what background they're from. God, help me to do that. Every one of us, I know me all of us fail in some way or another in that area. But God, help us to to strive to treat people right. &gt;&gt; Not to look down on them because they don't understand what we understand. And that includes here in the church. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Because not everybody's going to understand what we understand. But we don't hate them because of that. We don't put them out, &gt;&gt; right? We'll still call them brother and sister and things like that. But but it's not for this book isn't written for everyone. &gt;&gt; They're not going to understand it. They're not even going to want to get into it. &gt;&gt; But for those who do, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It's the uncarchable riches of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Listen. How do we get in Christ? 1 Corinthians 12:13. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, but all made to drink into one spirit. Brother Brandham deals with that in adoption. He said, "How?" Baptized by what? The Holy Ghost. Not by water baptism, you Church of Christ people. Not by one capital SPI RIT. By uh but by one capital SPI RIT. By one spirit. Not by one handshake, by one letter, not by one sprinkle, but by one spirit. We are all baptized into one body, our possession, the land that God gave us to live in the Holy Ghost. So as Joshua goes in to place the people in the land, so the Holy Ghost comes in and places us in our possession, which is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So it is the leadership of the Holy Ghost placing us in the land of the Holy Ghost in Christ because we know he's one in the same person. &gt;&gt; Right? So he said just as he give Canaan to the Jews, he's give us the Holy Spirit. One spirit are we all baptized into one body. You get it? He said he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites, Israel, the spiritual Israel who's possessed the land. Aren't you glad you come out of Egypt's garlic? Aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness? And remember, he said they had to eat mana, angels food out of heaven until they crossed over into the land. And when they crossed over into the land, the mana ceased to fall. They were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land. He said, "Now, now that you're not babies anymore, now that you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel, you don't have to be babyed and petted and persuaded to come to church. We got anybody out there like that, fully mature Christians." He said, "You're ready to eat strong meats now. You're ready to come into something." He said, "You're ready to understand something that's deep and rich." He said, "We'll get into it directly. You know, it's been hidden since the foundation of the world." He said, "Now that you've come into this, I'm addressing this to you. Not to those who just left Egypt. Not to those who are still in the journey, but to those who are in the promised land, has received the promised land." What is the promised land again? The Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? That's how you get in Christ. It's the only way you can get in Christ. &gt;&gt; Church, if we'd ever understand that and grab a hold of that, nobody could take us out of that. Nobody could shake us from that. We're not so dependent on feeling. We're not so dependent on what somebody says about us. Why? Because we're in Christ. If I'm in him, if I've ever been in him, I can't be taken out of him. &gt;&gt; I I'm a part of him. I died with him on Calvary. How could I be judged for sin that I don't that he don't even see because it was judged in his body? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, so we have to understand we're in him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "How many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you're in the land? Yes. &gt;&gt; Over here now eating the old corn, &gt;&gt; eating the strong things of God. Got a clear understanding. &gt;&gt; Your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up, right? Because that's what happens when see when when you're when you don't have the Holy Ghost or I'll say this, when you get back &gt;&gt; your spiritual mind gets muddled up, &gt;&gt; right? You just can't think clearly about the word &gt;&gt; and what your responsibilities are to the word. &gt;&gt; But if you'll be in Christ and dwell abide in Christ, right? &gt;&gt; If you abide in the vine, your spiritual mind gets unmuddled up. &gt;&gt; You know exactly who he is. &gt;&gt; Oh, I could preach on that for a while. &gt;&gt; When your spiritual mind gets un Oh, church, if we could just ask you, Lord, get my mind unmuddled up. I know that's not good English, but if we could just kind of pray that way. Lord, get my mind. Allow my mind to be clear, my spiritual mind, so that I can know the things of God. &gt;&gt; So I can know who you are. Because if we know who he is, we know how big he is. We know our problems aren't bigger than he is. Our situations aren't more than he can handle. But he is able to overcome everything that we go through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that today? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know exactly what he is. You know exactly where where you're going. How many know where you're going? &gt;&gt; Well, if you don't know where you're going, then you need to find out. &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz you're going somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if you know where you're going, your spiritual mind's been unmuddled up. You know exactly all about it. You know in whom you have believed and persuaded he's able. Are you persuaded that he's able to keep that which you've committed against that day. He said, "Oh, that's the one. That's who Paul is talking to." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we say, are we are we in Christ? I believe that you are tonight. &gt;&gt; That's why we would preach this because we're preaching to people who are in Christ. &gt;&gt; How do we get into Christ? Brother Brandon says he just keeps going over this. He said, by joining church? No. By putting your name on a book? No. By being baptized by immersing? No. How do we get into Christ? By one Holy Spirit. Are we all baptized into one promise, the body, and are partakers of all? Someone say all &gt;&gt; that belongs into the land. &gt;&gt; He said my when I get in this land, it's mine. I'm home now. &gt;&gt; Oh church, that's why I couldn't leave the message for the Paul cuz I'm home now. I found a home in the land. I found a home in the teachings of a prophet. I found a home in the in what what it what Paul taught and what brother Brandon taught. I found a home. I found a place. I found my future home. I found a place for me now. I found my position in Christ. It's mine. I'm home. I'm in Canaan. I'm subject to anything God wants to use me for. I'm walking on holy ground. How many believe that tonight? I'm walking on a holy ground. Hallelujah. I've come out of Egypt. I'm walking on holy ground. A child of the king, all robed and ready. I've come out of Egypt, come up through the promised land, stood in the trials, passed over Jordan into this blessed promise. &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I get it? By one spirit. The same way Paul got it. acted on me the same way it did on him, same way it did on you. By one spirit, we are all baptized. &gt;&gt; Not sprinkled. Just a little sprinkle of it feel pretty good. But immersed under. Word baptism means immersion. We're not sprinkled by the spirit, right? We are immersed in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same life that was in him living in us doing the same works. He said, "That's the promise." Hallelujah. We believe his word because we have his life. The deep things of God are there for us. There for us when we need them. He'll reveal them to us as we need them. Amen. But they're there for us. Are you with me now? We may not understand everything, but we know it's there for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's there for us. It's a different atmosphere. We've come inside a different place, a different level of understanding. Not just natural understanding, but spiritual understanding. &gt;&gt; So, you come inside. Brother Random likened it to the countdown. You remember he said the countdown in the natural went 1 2 3 4 like that. He said but the countdown spiritual. He said in the natural it goes down to zero and in spiritual it counts up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And in the seventh age he said at the end of the seventh age that's when you get into the pressurized chamber. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember he said that's what the astronaut did. He said they went inside a pressurized chamber. It was pressurized to withstand the things that were going to take place. &gt;&gt; You realize what God's done for us by the message of the hour. He's put us inside a different atmosphere. He's taken us oh hallelujah. Out of leodyia. He's taken us out of rich and increased with goods and and have need of nothing. And he puts us inside a pressurized atmosphere, inside of here, inside of Christ. That's what it is. Inside of the word. We don't have to be shaken by the things that are happening around us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Inside of here, we know the countdown's already went down or we're just waiting on the blastoff. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "Get in, my brother or sister. Get pressurized. The pressure won't hurt you when you get on the inside and get pressurized." Oh, there's more pressure than there's ever been, but it's time to get inside and get pressurized tonight. Well, I know it's just a Wednesday night, but let's walk in. Let's let our atmosphere be changed. Let's close the door and walk inside because in here there's oxygen when we need it. In here there's power when we need it. In here the Holy Spirit works when we need him to work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In here there's healing. In here there's salvation. In here our children are safe. In here under the token inside the chamber. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that? In Christ. &gt;&gt; Who's Paul writing these things to the faithful? They're only they're not faithful because of their own works. They're faithful because they've gotten inside &gt;&gt; the pressurized chamber. &gt;&gt; They couldn't come out if they wanted to. &gt;&gt; I know people look that say, "Well, that gives me a license to live any way I want to." No, it don't. &gt;&gt; That means you're not inside the pressurized chamber. &gt;&gt; If you ever go inside, you want to live in that atmosphere all the time. You want to be You want to be in the Holy of Holies, in the presence of God all the time. You don't want to do anything to separate yourself &gt;&gt; from that presence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said they can't get in Christ. You won't care what the world says. They can't never hit you anyway. You're anyhow you're safe. You're tucked in. Jesus Christ is our great glorious astronaut tube that we'll be in that we'll be propelled by the Holy Ghost and power and fire when she begins to fly out one of these mornings. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to it. Aren't you? But inside, now look what Paul says. When you're in Christ, what what's the condition inside? There is therefore now, someone say it with me. There is therefore now no condemnation. Condemnation is judgment. To them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, after the spirit. Look, he said to them which are in Christ, &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit, there is no judgment. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandon says about that. You don't have to say, "Oh, if I could just quit drinking. If I could just just get in Christ &gt;&gt; and it's all gone." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know we've got people that are dealing with things and in a church of any size. You've got addiction and things that people deal with and things that people maybe you'd never think about that. But in your own life, you know what what it is and maybe you've dealt with that in your life. &gt;&gt; But he brother Brandham taught us he said not to say, "Oh, if I could just quit this, &gt;&gt; but to get in Christ, &gt;&gt; right? If you want to quit, get in Christ. &gt;&gt; If you want to live a better life, get in Christ. It's not a sevenstep program, but it's about getting inside the chamber. Well, you say, "How do I get in Christ?" Go to church, read your Bible, pray, become become closer to him. Surrender to him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the only way to get in Christ. &gt;&gt; Get in Christ and it's all gone. See, because your body is subject to the spirit, &gt;&gt; right? See, when you come inside, the astronaut's body becomes subject to the atmosphere. Hallelujah. inside of that rocket, &gt;&gt; right? It's a different atmosphere. His body is subject to the conditions inside. When you're in Christ, your body becomes subject to the conditions of the word. It's no more subject to the things of the world. They're dead. They're dead. Your sins are buried in baptism. You're a new creation in Christ. Your body becoming subject to the spirit trying to live a right kind of life. He said, "Like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost going out here wearing shorts and things. How could you do it? How could the spirit of God and you ever let you do a thing as that? See, you you haven't went in Christ. You haven't went inside or you'd read the Bible and know that wasn't right. &gt;&gt; Right. But he said, "Certainly, it just can't be." So certainly it can't be. He's not a filthy spirit. He's a Holy Spirit. He said, "Then when you become subject to that spirit, it throws your whole being subject to that spirit. And that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest, quickened, hallelujah, made alive." When the Bible said don't do this, that body quickly turns to it. There's no question. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So, we can look at and say, "Paul said it." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches it. A prophet teaches it. &gt;&gt; We just do it. &gt;&gt; We can't do anything else. Why? We're inside that pressurized chamber. &gt;&gt; He said that body quickly turns to there's no question. What is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. This body will be raised up again. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Listen to me. Some of you old folks be up running the aisles if you really if you really grabbed a hold of this revelation. &gt;&gt; This body will be raised up again because &gt;&gt; it's already started. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, will I have rapturing faith? Will I be able?" Are you saved? &gt;&gt; Did you have faith to come up out of what you were? &gt;&gt; You remember what you were. You remember what the devil did in your life and how he how he run you around one side and down the other. But one day you realize you were not the son of your natural parents. You were a son or daughter of God. And when you did, you become a Christian and you become baptized by the Holy Ghost and fire. And when you did, what happened? You've entered into another kingdom. &gt;&gt; And it raised up your body into, we'll talk about it as we continue in Ephesians, into what? Into heavenly places in Christ. When you are raised with him into heavenly places in Christ, what is that? If you have already been raised, if you are seated tonight in heavenly places, the the the resurrection has already begun. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then I don't have to worry about going into the grave, brother JT. I don't have to worry about getting old. Hallelujah. I don't have to worry about all the things that that the economy might fail or this one might fail or we know the government's going to fail. We know the economy is going to fail. We know all these things are going to happen. But I don't have to worry because inside of me a seed is already raised up to life. &gt;&gt; We know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul said the same thing, but he should tell us. He said there's a body already waiting. &gt;&gt; What is that body? Brother Brandon taught us it was a word body, a theophony body. You bypassed your theophony, but God already, it was already there in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. Then if you Hallelujah. If it was there, it meant that you never could have been lost in the first place. He always had you in his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I come to church on a Wednesday night. I don't know about you. &gt;&gt; This body will be raised up again because &gt;&gt; it's already started. &gt;&gt; It was once subject to sin and mire and corruption, but now it's got the earnest, the down payment. It's turned heavenly. &gt;&gt; Listen, we who are in Christ have heard the message given by the messenger with the authority to give it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we find Christ deity in the word. Listen, as we talked about Paul being an apostle by the will of God, brother Brandham likened himself to a prospector. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Paul's job is to lay it in there. Right. The gold was there. But brother Brandon said, "I'm a prospector." He was anointed and ordained to do that from his mother's womb. Right? What was his purpose? He said, "I like to go down and dig those nuggets up." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So So, Brother Brand, so Paul, he he he leaves some nuggets in the scripture that were hard to understand for years and years and years. People thought about it and criticized each other and one went this way and one went that way. And &gt;&gt; brother Brandham come along. He said, "I'm like a 49er." Not the football team, the the miners. I'm a prospector. Come on. That's all right. I I didn't sin by saying that. Some of y'all looked at me like I I committed a sin in the house of God. Talking about football. Brother said, "I'm a prospector. I go down and dig those nuggets up and shine them up, polish them up like this. Look at them. And every one of them will reflect Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Those who are in Christ as the musicians come tonight receive these golden nuggets and they are changed by the word to become the word &gt;&gt; made flesh. This book of Ephesians was written specifically to me, &gt;&gt; right? The faithful. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; In Christ. You said, "Well, brother Ben, I haven't always been faithful, but are you in Christ?" &gt;&gt; Because if you're in Christ, you're faithful in Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It was written to you, &gt;&gt; Melody. It was written to you, you girls. It was written to every one of you. &gt;&gt; This book was written to you to help you to understand, Jared. It was written to you, you boys. It was written to every one of you. &gt;&gt; That's older folks &gt;&gt; as I've identified myself with the elders. It was written to us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It was written to me from Paul. &gt;&gt; But it took a prophet to come along. grab a hold of them golden nuggets that Paul left us and just polish them up, &gt;&gt; show them to us in such a way that we could see Jesus in it. We could see his purpose and his plan that we could see our purpose by seeing that we are in him. Oh, could you just believe that tonight? It was written to me. If you could really believe that God is that much in control. I know we worry and we think, well, you know, the preacher, you know, he he said this or that or the other. But we got to believe that what God sends, he sends to us. What did he tell us in this hour? He said, "Behold, I send you Elijah. I send you Elijah." Every one of us could put our name there. &gt;&gt; I send you Elijah the prophet. One day, Elijah come by your way. Whether it was whether you were old enough to remember the meetings or whether somebody told you about it or you found a book or a tape or or or you were born in a message family, God sent you, Elijah, &gt;&gt; right? He was still sent to you personally. &gt;&gt; Why? Because hallelujah. You were one of those chosen by God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And now he wrote some things that were good uh you know to understand when you were a sinner. He wrote some things that you could grab a hold of when you were a young Christian, when you were justified, when you were sanctified. But now he's written some things and given us some things, some golden nuggets we can look at as believers filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We can look at and say, "I know where I stand. I know who I am. I know whose I am. I know where I belong." And we can say amen to that tonight. Nothing's going to shake me. What can separate us from the love of God? Nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Oh, I love him tonight. Don't you? Let's bow our heads together. If you're in Christ, the book of Ephesians will tell you who you are and where you're going. If you've never stepped into that pressurized chamber, would you do that today? What if you just step in? If you're watching tonight and maybe you weren't able to come tonight, you got sick or something and you just want to step in. Go ahead. You can take the pressure because that chamber was made for that. Step into the atmosphere of Christ. Step into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It was written. These things were written for you and for me. I say, "God, help me to be the faithful in Christ Jesus, the saint of God that can receive these things, not by my own merits, but by what Jesus did for me that day on Calvary." Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, so thankful, Lord. Thankful for these things. God, we could preach a lot of things and we could preach hard or we could preach happy. Lord, there's a lot of things we could preach, but Lord, I believe this is your word, God. And I pray that it would strengthen us and bring maturity to our lives until, Lord, we're not just subject to whatever the devil tries to tell us because we know he's talking to us all the time, trying to tell us we're no good, trying to tell us we're not believers, trying to tell us we don't belong in the house of God. I pray you would silence the voice of the enemy today by your word which is spoken. Say, "I am in him. I am a Christian by the will of God. I've heard a messenger who came. Elijah came to me and I believe, Lord, help my unbelief." I pray you'd grant that today. I pray you'd move in every way, Lord, that only as only you can. Pray you'd heal the sick tonight, Lord. I know there's several that are out sick. Pray God you'd reach down where they're at. Lord, right now, Lord, as your presence is here, and I believe it's there, even in their home, I pray you'd reach down where they are and heal them completely. I pray you'd touch those that are in need. Oh God, how we need you, Lord. Pro protect us, keep us, we pray, till we come together again in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah for pray. Oh where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their cares. This is your house. &gt;&gt; So do you believe you're in the house of God today? You are the house of God. Sing it together.
