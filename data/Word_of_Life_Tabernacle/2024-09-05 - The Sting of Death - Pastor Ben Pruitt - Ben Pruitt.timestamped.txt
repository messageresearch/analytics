[46:40] anymore he showed it to us we shall not
[46:43] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[46:48] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[46:50] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[46:53] sound and the dead shall be raised
[46:55] incorruptible
[46:57] and we shall be changed for this
[47:00] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[47:04] this Mortal must put on
[47:06] immortality so when this corruptible
[47:08] shall have put on incorruption and this
[47:10] Mortal shall have put on
[47:12] immortality then shall be brought to
[47:14] pass the saying that is written death is
[47:18] swallowed up in Victory oh oh death
[47:22] where is thy steem oh grave where is thy
[47:26] victory The Sting of death is sin and
[47:29] the strength of sin is the law but
[47:32] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[47:34] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:37] amen God bless you uh let's bow our
[47:40] heads together Heavenly Father we're so
[47:43] thankful to be here tonight and I know
[47:45] there's many needs represented here in
[47:47] this place I pray that you'd meet those
[47:49] needs tonight I pray that you just move
[47:51] in our midst and speak through your word
[47:54] speak to our hearts Lord may we be
[47:57] completely caught up in your word
[47:58] Heavenly Father until the things of
[48:00] Earth would have less value to us Lord
[48:03] until Heavenly things would grow clearer
[48:06] all the time pray you grant it now we
[48:08] ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you
[48:11] can be seated death is is not a
[48:14] comfortable subject for most folks I I
[48:17] know that for me it's not always a
[48:19] comfortable subject and it's one thing
[48:21] when you're dealing as a pastor with
[48:23] other people that that deal with that
[48:25] but then when you have to deal with
[48:26] yourself or with your family it's always
[48:29] different when it's close to home the
[48:31] Bible says we should weep with those who
[48:33] weep and I believe that's part of what
[48:35] we do as a church it's part of the
[48:38] function of a church I don't know how
[48:40] people who don't have a family a church
[48:42] family uh to help them in that way I
[48:44] don't know how they uh they handle it
[48:46] sometimes but I'm so glad that we do
[48:48] have one another and I think we should
[48:50] every do everything we can to help one
[48:53] another in that way to weep with those
[48:55] who weep to mourn with those who mourn
[48:58] yet we know that every one of us has to
[49:00] go some way or another uh either by
[49:03] death or by Rapture someone uh said it's
[49:06] not that I'm afraid to die I just don't
[49:08] want to be there when it
[49:10] happens and uh that's true most most of
[49:13] us that uh and in the world in general
[49:15] death is just something you don't talk
[49:17] about it's not something you uh you you
[49:19] mention it's not something you bring up
[49:22] yet we as Christians are not afraid of
[49:24] death we view death much differently
[49:27] than others do uh there was a man in in
[49:31] the early Christian world uh actually a
[49:33] Greek by the name of aides and he was
[49:36] trying to explain Christianity to a
[49:39] friend of his and and he said this about
[49:42] the Christians he said if any righteous
[49:44] man among the Christians passes from
[49:46] this world he said they rejoice and
[49:49] offer thanks to God and they accompany
[49:52] his body with songs and Thanksgiving as
[49:56] if he were setting out from one place to
[49:59] another nearby so it was very strange to
[50:02] the Pagan mind because they didn't
[50:05] comprehend that the Christians viewed
[50:08] death as a temporary state of the body a
[50:12] temporary state of the body and not the
[50:15] Eternal state of the soul in fact that's
[50:17] why he would always say uh that that the
[50:20] the body was sleeping now the Bible
[50:22] never teaches Soul sleeping it teaches
[50:24] that the body sleeps in the dust of the
[50:26] earth and the body will be raised up
[50:28] again and so Christians or the early
[50:31] Christians actually changed the language
[50:34] of burial that when they uh when they
[50:37] begin to place their dead in the
[50:38] catacombs in Rome they developed their
[50:41] own language in speaking about death and
[50:43] they referred to those catacombs as
[50:46] comeria which we would know as the word
[50:48] Cemetery today but if you saw the word
[50:51] comeria in in that time referring to a
[50:54] place where they would put the Dead it
[50:57] would actually mean a dormatory a
[51:00] dormatory and the the Greeks thought of
[51:02] the dormatory and the Romans thought of
[51:03] the dormatory is a temporary place that
[51:06] you stayed for one night a place where
[51:08] you slept and rose again in the morning
[51:11] and that's exactly what the Christians
[51:12] meant when they called it a comery a
[51:15] cemetery that it's a temporary place
[51:18] that the body is in amen for a short
[51:21] amount of we believe that today that the
[51:23] body is there for a temporary time and
[51:26] that body will be raised up again how
[51:28] God does that exactly we don't know we
[51:30] know he goes down a corruptible body but
[51:32] it's raised an Incorruptible body and we
[51:35] know then that we'll have a glorified
[51:37] body we know there's a theophany body
[51:39] waiting for us and we'll get to that but
[51:42] but yet we realize it's a temporary
[51:44] thing and so for a Christian uh they
[51:47] meant that you went to sleep so you
[51:48] might wake again and so a death you you
[51:51] just place they didn't put their dead
[51:53] they didn't burn their dead they put
[51:54] their dead in a in a
[51:57] dormatory because they believe they'd
[51:59] see them
[52:00] again uh another example is the word
[52:03] deposit or deposit us which was used if
[52:06] you see deposit us on a grave on a
[52:08] Christian grave meant that they had made
[52:10] a deposit in the earth and they believed
[52:13] that it was coming back again they made
[52:15] a deposit like a grain of wheat to be
[52:17] restored because Jesus said except a
[52:20] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[52:22] die how can it ever rise again and
[52:24] produce much fruit
[52:28] the truth is they just believe what God
[52:29] Said in his
[52:31] word right and that would do us a whole
[52:33] lot of good church if we could just
[52:35] believe what God says in the word if we
[52:37] could just say I'm hanging my soul that
[52:39] I don't always feel like it I I I you
[52:41] know when we mourn with those who mourn
[52:43] and we we feel the pain of that to a
[52:45] lesser extent than they do but but we
[52:47] feel a little bit of that and we mourn
[52:49] with them and if you've lost the love
[52:51] when it's a very it's a hard time and
[52:53] we're not taking away from that tonight
[52:54] but know that we believe that What God
[52:57] Says is right and and What God Says is
[52:59] eternal and whatever God said in the
[53:01] word about where we would be that's
[53:02] where we're going to be and we got to
[53:04] believe that we got to do more than just
[53:06] pay it lift service but if we believe it
[53:08] it changes even our language and the way
[53:10] we speak about
[53:12] death so they believe what God Said and
[53:16] and what God's thoughts are are written
[53:18] down for us it's good you know if you
[53:20] ever thought like that said well I
[53:22] wonder what God was thinking well we
[53:23] know what God was
[53:24] thinking we know God thoughts because he
[53:27] wrote them down right he wrote them down
[53:30] in the Bible and we know even what was
[53:32] in the back part of his mind because a
[53:35] prophet com in our day to tell us that
[53:38] so we know the thoughts of God we know
[53:40] what God thought about death we know
[53:44] that death is the penalty of sin in
[53:46] Genesis 21:17 he said the day that thou
[53:49] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die he
[53:52] also tells us the wages of sin is death
[53:55] we know that death was was postponed by
[53:58] an animal sacrifice it wasn't done away
[54:00] with but it was postponed that when Adam
[54:04] and his wife were leaving the garden God
[54:06] made coats of skins and and clothed them
[54:09] and so something had to die it was
[54:12] something that died in their place when
[54:15] he saw them leaving the garden there
[54:16] with those bloody skins slapping up
[54:18] against her leg brother B said the heart
[54:21] of God couldn't stand it and and so he
[54:24] he he made a promise that the woman's
[54:25] seed would crush the head of the serpent
[54:29] would oh my oh I believe that's still
[54:31] true I believe it took place on Calvary
[54:34] and so we know that that that was the
[54:36] sting of death was the law actually
[54:40] which made us guilty it told us and so
[54:43] the law to to Adam was don't eat that
[54:46] tree or that day you die he broke that
[54:48] law and that was the sting of death was
[54:51] the fact that that the law brought a
[54:54] guilt on the person that they would be
[54:57] then not just dead but they would be
[54:59] separated from God and so there was a
[55:02] guilt that was there and so in the our
[55:05] text Paul says the sting of death is sin
[55:08] and the strength of sin is the law again
[55:12] in Romans 3:19 he said we know that what
[55:14] things soever the law saith it sayith to
[55:16] them who are under the law that every
[55:19] mouth may be stopped and all the world
[55:21] may become guilty before God in other
[55:24] words there can't be nobody standing
[55:25] there and say well I was wasn't guilty
[55:26] but they were every one of us was
[55:29] guilty I know this is Elementary tonight
[55:32] but we're trying to get somewhere and we
[55:34] want our thoughts to match God's
[55:36] thoughts when it comes to these things
[55:39] so you know here was something that
[55:42] would make us guilty and that was the
[55:43] sting of death and we know that when
[55:46] Jesus died on the cross he removed the
[55:49] sting of death he REM oh Church the
[55:53] Bible says what the law could not do
[55:57] this is my favorite verse I had it made
[55:58] and it hung on the wall in my office for
[56:01] what the law could not do in that it was
[56:03] weak through the flesh God sending his
[56:07] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[56:10] for sin condemned sin in the flesh he
[56:15] said that the righteousness of the law
[56:17] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[56:20] after the flesh but after the spirit
[56:22] brother brandom said when the father
[56:23] said this is my beloved Son here you
[56:26] hear there's the Perfection everybody's
[56:29] looking for a perfect Church everybody's
[56:31] looking for a perfect person everybody's
[56:34] looking for a perfect Pastor a perfect
[56:35] song leader he said there's the
[56:37] Perfection when the father looked at his
[56:39] son and said this is my beloved Son hear
[56:42] ye him and that was Perfection brother
[56:45] Allen that's that was as perfect as you
[56:47] could
[56:48] get right it was the perfect man he said
[56:51] there's the Perfection he said that's
[56:53] what the law could not do the law could
[56:56] not produce Perfection Perfection was
[56:59] only through Christ he said when he come
[57:02] and was made flesh and anchored the
[57:04] Stinger of death and pulled it out where
[57:06] you and I can walk in the face of it
[57:08] death can't bother us hallelujah it
[57:11] hasn't got any Stinger he said it can
[57:13] buzz and hum and threaten make a bluff
[57:15] but that's all it can do death has no
[57:17] more Stinger for every believer that's
[57:19] in Christ Jesus someone say every
[57:21] believer that's in Christ Jesus is
[57:24] perfected forever yes
[57:26] we could go into that time don't have
[57:28] time but you perfected in that body
[57:30] because you were in him that's what
[57:32] brother bam was telling us in Christ is
[57:33] the mystery of God revealed he said you
[57:35] died with him you Rose with him and
[57:38] because you were in him you were
[57:39] perfected forever in him it doesn't mean
[57:42] that this body won't do things that are
[57:44] wrong and and many times this body is
[57:46] messed up and I'll say this as long as
[57:48] you're in this body you'll live with
[57:51] many of the choices you made yeah right
[57:54] and you can't get mad at people for for
[57:56] recognizing you made bad choices in your
[57:58] life but at the same time you got to
[58:01] realize that as far as God sees it if
[58:04] you're in Christ you did you never did
[58:06] it in the first place but that body
[58:08] still Bears the scars of it Bears the
[58:10] marks of it but yet in your soul you're
[58:13] completely completely redeemed as
[58:16] perfect as he's perfect that's the only
[58:18] way you can be
[58:19] saved right you you can't be half
[58:22] perfect and make it into heaven you
[58:25] can't be you can't be uh 3/4s perfect
[58:28] and make it into heaven you can only be
[58:31] saved in the body of Jesus Christ and by
[58:35] his death amen so that death that that
[58:38] bee brother said was the bee of death he
[58:41] said it was it was buzzing there at
[58:43] Calvary and when it sunk its stinger
[58:46] into Christ it it tried to pull it out
[58:49] when it did it left it in the body of
[58:51] Christ and so the sting of death or the
[58:54] guilt that comes from the law is gone in
[58:59] Christ death has no more Stinger for
[59:03] every believer that's in Christ Jesus is
[59:05] perfected forever someone say forever
[59:08] forever so we know then that his death
[59:11] took the sting out of out of death his
[59:14] death took the Sting from death and his
[59:17] resurrection defeated
[59:20] death right so death had a pretty bad
[59:24] week had a pretty bad weekend all right
[59:27] right because one day it Stinger was
[59:29] taken out and the next day death was
[59:31] completely defeated and we know that
[59:34] because John sees him as a conqueror on
[59:35] the aisle of patmas you remember when he
[59:37] looks around and he hears the voice and
[59:40] he turns to see who's talking to him and
[59:42] he sees one like the Son of God he's
[59:44] standing there with brass feet like
[59:46] brass eyes like fire Seven Stars in his
[59:49] hand and as he's standing there John
[59:51] fell down on his feet is dead he said
[59:53] when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[59:55] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[59:57] saying to me fear not I am the first and
[1:00:00] the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:00:04] dead you talk about a victory he said I
[1:00:06] was in the grave and I come out again
[1:00:09] never to die again and we could say well
[1:00:12] didn't Lazarus defeat death well only
[1:00:14] through Christ he defeated death but he
[1:00:17] had to go back death still had a hold on
[1:00:20] his body listen if you get healed today
[1:00:22] death will still have a hold on your
[1:00:24] body at some point you'll get sick again
[1:00:27] you might get delivered today of some
[1:00:28] disease and catch another one before you
[1:00:30] leave the door and we believe in healing
[1:00:33] we believe in Divine Healing but oh how
[1:00:34] much better is when Christ defeated
[1:00:37] death itself because he never had to die
[1:00:40] again and you and I if our soul has been
[1:00:42] sealed oh church that ought to make us
[1:00:44] happy tonight if your soul has been
[1:00:46] sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:48] you don't have to die again you can't
[1:00:50] die any more than God can die this body
[1:00:53] might sleep it might die but you can't
[1:00:55] die
[1:00:56] right right because death has been
[1:00:59] defeated and his resurrection is proof
[1:01:01] of that I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:01:04] behold I'm alive forever more and I have
[1:01:06] the keys of hell and of death brother BR
[1:01:11] said when Christ died for sin he knocked
[1:01:12] sickness in the
[1:01:14] head I like that while he was busy
[1:01:18] defeating
[1:01:19] death Hallelujah he knocked sickness in
[1:01:22] the head yes sir and everything that
[1:01:24] went with it even death
[1:01:26] itself what do you do with an old
[1:01:28] varment on the farm that you don't want
[1:01:29] no more you knock it in the head take
[1:01:32] that old snake and bruise his head crush
[1:01:34] his head amen oh I've done it many times
[1:01:37] where you put your heel on the snake's
[1:01:39] head and you crush its head you don't
[1:01:40] have to worry about it that old body
[1:01:41] might might jerk and move around for a
[1:01:44] while but he got no more ability to harm
[1:01:47] you amen Christ died for sin he not
[1:01:50] sickness in the head and everything that
[1:01:52] went with it even death itself we're not
[1:01:54] dead but we're alive he that heareth my
[1:01:57] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:01:58] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:02:00] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:02:02] shall never die he conquer death hell
[1:02:04] the grave Paul said when he come to the
[1:02:06] Grave oh death where's thy sting oh
[1:02:08] grave where is thy Victory but thanks be
[1:02:11] to God who gives us the victory through
[1:02:13] our Lord Jesus Christ he lives do you
[1:02:15] believe that today he lives and if he
[1:02:17] lives then everything is going to be
[1:02:20] okay it's going to be all right we may
[1:02:23] suffer for a while but he said after you
[1:02:25] suffered for a while he's going to
[1:02:26] glorify you yes sir he's going to make
[1:02:29] everything
[1:02:30] right see everything's going to be set
[1:02:32] right that's the hope of the Christian
[1:02:34] the hope of the Christian is not that
[1:02:35] everything gets right in this life come
[1:02:37] on Paul says if in this life only we we
[1:02:40] have hope we are of all men most
[1:02:44] miserable right because we don't we
[1:02:47] don't put any stock in this life and and
[1:02:49] how it goes we're looking to another
[1:02:52] life and and when our bodies are changed
[1:02:55] we know so death has been Sting's been
[1:02:58] taken out of it it's been defeated and
[1:03:01] when our bodies are changed death will
[1:03:03] be literally swallowed up word means
[1:03:07] drowned right in Victory right death
[1:03:10] will there'll be so much Victory you
[1:03:12] won't even be able to see death
[1:03:14] anymore Hallelujah death will be
[1:03:18] swallowed up drowned in Victory when
[1:03:21] this corruptible shall have put on
[1:03:23] incorruption this Mortal shall have put
[1:03:25] on immortal ity and shall be brought to
[1:03:27] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:03:28] swallowed up in Victory brother BR says
[1:03:30] don't you fear I'll fear no evil for
[1:03:32] thou art with me death is all swallowed
[1:03:35] up in Victory death can't do nothing one
[1:03:37] writer said the only thing that God had
[1:03:39] did to death he put it to a buggy and
[1:03:42] harnessed it and set it in the buggy
[1:03:44] shafts and the only thing death can do
[1:03:46] is pull a believer in the presence of
[1:03:49] his
[1:03:50] maker see that's how God thinks about it
[1:03:53] right and we think about it as Mortals
[1:03:55] when we lost friend we lost a loved one
[1:03:56] that's true but let's try to think about
[1:03:59] it the way God thinks about it and I
[1:04:01] think it would change even our our
[1:04:04] expectation and our language and
[1:04:05] everything else how should we view death
[1:04:08] as Christians we should know that
[1:04:10] there's hope in death and by hope I mean
[1:04:14] expectation there expectation because no
[1:04:17] matter how badly they hurt no matter how
[1:04:21] long it took no matter no matter how
[1:04:23] much they struggled which I think is
[1:04:24] maybe the worst part of of death is
[1:04:26] watching someone
[1:04:27] die I I do believe that no matter how
[1:04:30] much they struggled in this life look at
[1:04:33] Lazarus Lazarus never had nothing laid
[1:04:38] in the doorway and and ate the crumbs
[1:04:41] that fell from from the table of that
[1:04:44] they'd sweep off the roof they ate their
[1:04:47] meals Up on the Roof like we did in
[1:04:48] Egypt they ate their meals there and
[1:04:51] they swept it off and Lazarus lays in
[1:04:53] the doorway and and eats that and we
[1:04:56] would think that's not a very Victorious
[1:04:57] man but he went to the bosom of
[1:05:01] Abraham amen he defeated
[1:05:04] death and even though he'd never he'd
[1:05:06] never had anything in life it seemed
[1:05:08] like he was cursed and it seemed like he
[1:05:10] couldn't make any money in his body
[1:05:11] wouldn't allow him to uh to get anywhere
[1:05:13] in life but yet he had a house in heaven
[1:05:17] and and he had a body in heaven he had
[1:05:19] something waiting for him in Paradise at
[1:05:22] that time and the rich man had
[1:05:24] everything on this Earth but he turned
[1:05:26] down the offer of the leadership of
[1:05:29] Jesus Christ now say to you young people
[1:05:31] tonight you need to take up take him up
[1:05:33] on his offer take him up on it today
[1:05:35] don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till
[1:05:37] next week or next year or the next Youth
[1:05:40] Camp take him up on it today say Lord
[1:05:43] Jesus Lead Me Guide Me walk with me
[1:05:45] through life because you'll need a hand
[1:05:48] to hold you brother brandham taught us
[1:05:50] there was no one to hold the rich man
[1:05:51] when he went to hell he said but but the
[1:05:54] Lazarus was cradled in in the arms of
[1:05:57] angels when he went to
[1:06:00] heaven second Corinthians or or brother
[1:06:02] Psalms 26:15 says precious in the sight
[1:06:06] of the Lord is the death of his
[1:06:09] Saints how could that be well we'll find
[1:06:12] out 2 Corinthians 5:1 we know that if
[1:06:15] our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[1:06:17] were
[1:06:18] dissolved we have a building of God a
[1:06:21] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[1:06:24] heavens Paul says we know
[1:06:26] right we know we don't suppose we don't
[1:06:29] we don't uh we don't guess at it we know
[1:06:33] that it's true how could Paul know that
[1:06:34] he visited the heavens remember he
[1:06:37] visited the third we know that there's a
[1:06:39] body there we had somebody in this age a
[1:06:41] prophet who visited the sixth Dimension
[1:06:44] he he could come back and say I know
[1:06:46] there's a place beyond compare I know
[1:06:48] there's a place that is so beautiful I
[1:06:50] can't even describe it to you with words
[1:06:54] we know there's a if this Earthly house
[1:06:57] this this body is dissolved there's a
[1:07:00] building of God a body in the heavens
[1:07:02] for us that's what we call our theophany
[1:07:05] body 1 Thessalonians 4:13 he said but I
[1:07:08] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:07:10] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:07:11] asleep those who are in the dormatory
[1:07:14] the cemetery I would not oh my would not
[1:07:17] have you to be ignorant you know if you
[1:07:19] if you told somebody you know our
[1:07:21] language means something you tell
[1:07:23] somebody there in the cemetery it has a
[1:07:24] finality to it it doesn't it but that's
[1:07:26] not what the word even means it's not a
[1:07:29] permanent place it's a
[1:07:32] dormatory oh church that meant so much
[1:07:34] to me when I saw it I just thought God
[1:07:36] let me think about it like that it's
[1:07:38] just a dormatory we may place our loved
[1:07:40] ones there but they're coming out
[1:07:42] again and so he said there there's some
[1:07:45] that are asleep he said but that you
[1:07:47] sorrow not even as others which have no
[1:07:49] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[1:07:52] and rose again even so them also which
[1:07:55] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[1:07:59] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:08:01] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:08:03] remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:08:04] shall not prevent or hinder them which
[1:08:06] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:08:08] descend from heaven with a shout let me
[1:08:10] just stop there for a minute Rand taught
[1:08:12] us that shout was the message that's
[1:08:15] already happened how close are we to the
[1:08:18] end if that portion of it has already
[1:08:20] taken place where are we at church oh
[1:08:23] it's a dormatory we put our love R away
[1:08:25] but it's a dormatory it won't last for
[1:08:29] long amen he said the Lord himself shall
[1:08:32] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:08:33] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:08:34] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:08:36] shall rise first so before we receive
[1:08:39] our change the dead in Christ
[1:08:42] toise amen just like maybe your loved
[1:08:45] ones when they left many times our loved
[1:08:47] ones will see people they haven't seen
[1:08:49] in a long time what is that they're
[1:08:51] they're entering another dimension
[1:08:52] they're going into another dimension and
[1:08:55] I believe one day it'll happen in
[1:08:57] Reverse we won't be dying but suddenly
[1:08:59] we'll just begin to see right and when
[1:09:01] we begin to see him come in it'll be
[1:09:03] about that time where the r said all of
[1:09:05] a sudden a sweep will go over
[1:09:07] us amen what's this Sudden
[1:09:10] Change Hallelujah it'll be caught up he
[1:09:14] said in just a moment twinkling of an
[1:09:16] eye listen to what he says he said we
[1:09:18] which are alive and remain I want to be
[1:09:19] one That Remains Not Just alive but
[1:09:22] remains I want to remain in church I
[1:09:24] want to remain as a father as a husband
[1:09:26] as a pastor I want to remain in the
[1:09:28] truth I want to do what's right we which
[1:09:31] are alive and remain amen I trust that's
[1:09:33] all of us tonight shall be caught up
[1:09:35] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:09:37] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:09:39] be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one
[1:09:41] another with these words why am I
[1:09:43] preaching this tonight because we're
[1:09:45] taught to do this you say well it's
[1:09:48] simple it doesn't matter it does matter
[1:09:50] Comfort one another with the fact that
[1:09:52] it's just a dormatory comfort one
[1:09:54] another with the fact that we're going
[1:09:55] to see each other again Comfort one
[1:09:57] another with the fact that this is just
[1:09:59] a temporary condition that the sickness
[1:10:01] in your body is temporary everything
[1:10:03] you're going through is temporary yes
[1:10:05] sir Hallelujah you might be getting old
[1:10:07] you might be getting gray but remember
[1:10:09] that's a temporary condition your youth
[1:10:11] is coming back one of these
[1:10:14] days
[1:10:15] hallelujah amen makes me feel better and
[1:10:18] better the older I
[1:10:19] get Comfort one another with these
[1:10:23] words what about you begin to think
[1:10:26] about that and what comfort that does
[1:10:27] bring us to those who are
[1:10:29] Christians but what about those who are
[1:10:30] not serving the lord when they
[1:10:33] die I'm so glad we serve a merciful
[1:10:37] god you realize God removed lot from
[1:10:41] Sodom just because he was happened to be
[1:10:43] related to
[1:10:45] Abraham that's pretty much all he had
[1:10:47] going for
[1:10:50] him he had some measure of righteousness
[1:10:53] about him because it vexed his righteous
[1:10:54] soul but he didn't do anything about
[1:10:56] it he stayed right there in
[1:10:59] Sodom and even when he was called out
[1:11:02] the Bible says he
[1:11:04] lingered he lingered and so how many
[1:11:06] people today are lingering in Sodom he
[1:11:09] lingered and the men The Messengers that
[1:11:12] were sent to him laid upon his hand upon
[1:11:13] the hand of his wife and upon the hand
[1:11:15] of his two daughters listen what it says
[1:11:17] the Lord being merciful unto him I'm so
[1:11:21] glad for his Mercy tonight that even l a
[1:11:24] type of maybe the foolish virgin or the
[1:11:26] nominal church that God said If Abraham
[1:11:29] cares about him I'm going to get him out
[1:11:30] of
[1:11:31] Sodom glory to God so even those that we
[1:11:34] care about God said I'm going to make a
[1:11:36] way for them and so he said I'm going to
[1:11:38] be merciful to him because Abraham loves
[1:11:41] him because he's a kin to Abraham I'm
[1:11:44] going to be merciful oh Church you don't
[1:11:45] know what it means to be one of
[1:11:47] Abraham's
[1:11:48] seed he said all those that bless you I
[1:11:51] will bless all those that curse you I
[1:11:53] will curse
[1:11:55] he was one of Abraham's kin belonged to
[1:11:58] Abraham and so the Lord was merciful to
[1:12:00] him I've often wondered how did David
[1:12:04] obtain
[1:12:05] forgiveness after all he had
[1:12:07] done think about this what was the
[1:12:09] difference in David and Saul I I've
[1:12:11] never really encapsulated it this way
[1:12:13] but think about it like this what was
[1:12:15] the difference God did something
[1:12:17] different with David listen what he did
[1:12:19] second Samuel 7:14 he's telling Samuel
[1:12:21] what he's going to do with David he said
[1:12:23] he Saidi be his father and he shall be
[1:12:26] my son that's a different relationship
[1:12:29] than what he had with Saul he said if he
[1:12:31] commit iniquity I will chase him with
[1:12:32] the rod of men with the stripes of the
[1:12:35] children of men other words I'm going to
[1:12:36] correct him because God knew what he was
[1:12:39] going to
[1:12:40] do but my
[1:12:43] Mercy you think God's not merciful my
[1:12:47] Mercy shall not depart away from him as
[1:12:50] I took it from Saul whom I put away from
[1:12:53] the what's the difference that's the
[1:12:54] difference yeah it's the mercy of
[1:12:58] God the mercy of God you see what not
[1:13:00] fair God has Mercy on whom he has Mercy
[1:13:04] whom he will he hardens and yet even
[1:13:07] Saul made it to
[1:13:10] Heaven it's what brother brandham taught
[1:13:12] us what the Bible teaches because when
[1:13:14] Samuel was called up remember when Saul
[1:13:15] calls up Samuel by the witch of indor
[1:13:18] what happens Samuel comes up he said
[1:13:20] tomorrow you'll be with
[1:13:21] me right you'll be in the same place
[1:13:23] that I'm at he was saved in the end you
[1:13:26] say that's too much grace brother Ben I
[1:13:28] can't handle that kind of Grace I can't
[1:13:29] help it our God is a merciful god and
[1:13:33] that may be too too merciful for you but
[1:13:35] I'll say this I needed that kind of
[1:13:37] Mercy I needed that I want that kind of
[1:13:40] Mercy for my family I want that kind of
[1:13:42] Mercy for the
[1:13:45] church no wonder David would instruct
[1:13:47] his singers to sing brother Joel when
[1:13:49] they begin to sing he instructed all of
[1:13:51] he said sing this the the mercy of the
[1:13:53] Lord endures forever David understood
[1:13:56] Mercy because he'd received Mercy he
[1:13:58] said his Mercy endures forever he
[1:14:00] instructed all of them to play his Mercy
[1:14:02] endures forever because he knew God was
[1:14:04] a merciful god he said this he said he's
[1:14:07] the Tower of salvation for his King and
[1:14:09] showeth his Mercy to his anointed to
[1:14:12] David and to his seed forever more when
[1:14:16] David sinned by numbering the people he
[1:14:17] fell on the mercies of God remember
[1:14:20] remember the uh the Ang or the Prophet
[1:14:22] come to him he said he said there's one
[1:14:24] of three things is going going to happen
[1:14:26] he said either the enemy is going to
[1:14:27] come in he said or some or uh there's
[1:14:29] going to be another situation take place
[1:14:31] he said or else he said a plague will
[1:14:33] come in he said well let it be the
[1:14:35] plague he said because I know God is
[1:14:37] merciful God is merciful and the Bible
[1:14:40] says that he killed so many thousands of
[1:14:42] them but God stayed the hand of the
[1:14:44] Angel why because he's a merciful god
[1:14:47] the Bible says Psalms 103 and8 the Lord
[1:14:49] is merciful and gracious soow to anger
[1:14:52] sir oh how we could learn from that sir
[1:14:55] and plenteous in Mercy right he will not
[1:14:58] always chide neither will he keep his
[1:15:01] anger forever see his his grace may be
[1:15:05] temporary to some people I believe his
[1:15:08] grace with his his elect is eternal but
[1:15:10] his grace may be temporary for some
[1:15:12] people but so is his
[1:15:13] anger he won't keep his anger forever
[1:15:17] and I don't know what people who believe
[1:15:18] in an eternal hell do with that verse
[1:15:20] that's right Heath not dealt with us
[1:15:23] after our sins nor rewarded us according
[1:15:26] to our iniquities for as the heaven is
[1:15:29] high above the Earth so great is his
[1:15:31] Mercy toward them sir that fear him if
[1:15:33] you go down to verse 15 he said as for
[1:15:35] man his days are as grass as a flower of
[1:15:37] the field so he flourisheth for the wind
[1:15:40] passes over it and it's gone and the
[1:15:42] place thereof shall know it no more but
[1:15:44] the mercy of the Lord is from
[1:15:46] Everlasting to Everlasting upon them
[1:15:48] that fear him and his righteousness
[1:15:50] notice unto children's children to such
[1:15:53] as keep his Covenant to those that
[1:15:54] remember Commandments to do them the
[1:15:56] brandom taught us that Noah saved his
[1:15:58] house the Bible says that Hebrews 11:7
[1:16:00] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[1:16:02] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[1:16:05] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:16:07] house he said by the which he condemned
[1:16:09] the world and become heir of the
[1:16:11] righteousness which is by faith they
[1:16:13] asked brother brandham that question
[1:16:15] they said brother brandham you said on
[1:16:16] one of the tapes that Noah saved his
[1:16:17] household does this mean a mother how
[1:16:21] many mothers we have here
[1:16:22] tonight a mother can have the same faith
[1:16:25] for for her household yes sir I just I
[1:16:29] just love this question cuz this mother
[1:16:32] caught
[1:16:32] something right she said does this mean
[1:16:35] a mother can have the same faith for her
[1:16:36] household does it mean every one of the
[1:16:38] family will be saved if we believe it
[1:16:40] she GNA put brother brandom to the
[1:16:43] test brother random answers very
[1:16:45] carefully if you go back and listen to
[1:16:47] it he answers it very carefully he said
[1:16:50] he said you said one on your on one of
[1:16:52] your tapes that Noah saved his household
[1:16:53] he said why because they
[1:16:55] believed they do have to believe he said
[1:16:59] that's it because they believed his
[1:17:00] message but now he answers there's two
[1:17:03] questions he said now he answerers the
[1:17:04] second question does this mean that a
[1:17:06] mother can have the same faith for her
[1:17:08] household yes sister he said I can see a
[1:17:11] little mother's heart crying for her
[1:17:13] people does this mean every one of the
[1:17:15] family will be saved if we believe
[1:17:18] it yes if they will accept
[1:17:21] it that's right but now look it's faith
[1:17:25] right it's Faith he said Remember the
[1:17:27] Philippian Jailer believe for both of
[1:17:29] you if you've got enough faith for your
[1:17:30] own salvation can't you have that same
[1:17:32] Faith that'll work upon your people that
[1:17:34] that'll work on your people he said what
[1:17:36] is Faith it's an unseen
[1:17:39] Force now look he said what is it it's a
[1:17:42] spirit now I think sometimes we think
[1:17:44] about faith as something you think
[1:17:46] brother brand tells us faith is a
[1:17:49] spirit faith is a spirit he said if if
[1:17:52] you uh he said it it's a spirit the Holy
[1:17:55] Spirit brings Faith it's an unseen Force
[1:17:59] brother brandom talks about how God
[1:18:00] worked in his own Ministry and he begins
[1:18:02] to talk about something strange he talks
[1:18:04] about how he said What mo what motivates
[1:18:06] the muscle in your arm and the muscles
[1:18:08] in my arm aren't very motivated
[1:18:11] actually because but that's because of
[1:18:14] the spirit of laziness
[1:18:16] right I'm just trying to make you laugh
[1:18:18] but but the muscles in your arm he said
[1:18:20] what motivates the muscle of your arm to
[1:18:22] move it's your spirit
[1:18:25] right that does that faith is a spirit
[1:18:28] so it what motivates the muscle of your
[1:18:29] arm is the faith so if you want
[1:18:31] something to move if you want something
[1:18:33] to happen you got to have faith for it
[1:18:35] all right and then Faith actually does
[1:18:38] something faith is not uh faith is not
[1:18:41] something that just sits there Faith
[1:18:43] does something Faith causes things to
[1:18:46] move and that's what he said Samson what
[1:18:49] was motivating there was a spirit in
[1:18:51] Samson that he could pick up the gate
[1:18:53] and carry it out
[1:18:55] there was a spirit in Samson a faith
[1:18:57] that he could take the Jawbone of a mule
[1:18:59] and kill a thousand Philistines brother
[1:19:01] BR said he looked around and said
[1:19:02] where's some more of you
[1:19:05] at Faith held that Jawbone together
[1:19:08] because it ought to disintegrated the
[1:19:10] first time he hit one of those bronze
[1:19:12] helmets but he held it together what was
[1:19:14] that Faith the spirit that was in s or
[1:19:17] in in
[1:19:18] Samson not by might or by power but by
[1:19:21] his Spirit sayith the Lord Brother R
[1:19:23] said therefore it is the Spirit of the
[1:19:25] Lord and when you've got the spirit of
[1:19:27] the Lord in you to believe for your own
[1:19:29] salvation place that upon your
[1:19:32] family Hallelujah say I claim them in
[1:19:35] the name of Jesus Christ I claim it now
[1:19:38] listen to me Church you don't quit
[1:19:40] having faith for your children after
[1:19:41] they're gone it don't mean you can
[1:19:43] change anything after they're gone but
[1:19:45] you don't quit having faith for them
[1:19:47] because you believe that something
[1:19:49] happened yeah that they would be there
[1:19:52] right no matter what it looked like
[1:19:54] Faith don't look at circumstances Faith
[1:19:56] looks at the word of God God you
[1:19:58] promised me my children and I believe
[1:20:00] somehow they made
[1:20:02] it yeah are you with me
[1:20:04] now and that doesn't give us any you say
[1:20:07] well uh well you know I just quit taking
[1:20:10] my kids to church because it doesn't
[1:20:11] really matter I'll just have faith for
[1:20:12] them you'd have a lot more confidence in
[1:20:15] what your Bel you'd have a lot stronger
[1:20:17] faith if you brought them to church on
[1:20:19] Wednesday
[1:20:21] night because Faith requires confidence
[1:20:24] what does James he said if you he said
[1:20:26] if you don't live it basically I'm
[1:20:28] paraphrasing but if you don't live it
[1:20:30] and you don't go to church nowhere and
[1:20:31] you don't have a pastor and you don't
[1:20:32] pay your tie you don't I'm paraphrasing
[1:20:35] but if you don't do that stuff the just
[1:20:36] the basic stuff that you're supposed to
[1:20:38] do it's hard to have any faith because
[1:20:40] your heart condemns
[1:20:41] you right but you want to have faith for
[1:20:43] your kids live the life live like God
[1:20:47] called us to live and when you live like
[1:20:49] God called you to live it'll produce a
[1:20:50] confidence in your God I know you
[1:20:52] changed me you can change them Lord I
[1:20:54] know I brought them to the house of God
[1:20:56] and I believe you're going to keep them
[1:20:58] in the house of God said well I made
[1:21:00] mistakes in that well start doing
[1:21:02] different today he said don't make a
[1:21:03] difference it
[1:21:04] does it does it might be your example
[1:21:07] today that brings grandkids who've never
[1:21:10] been to church with you but they see
[1:21:11] you're still in church might bring them
[1:21:14] back to church I've seen it
[1:21:16] happen they they know you're still there
[1:21:19] who they going to come back to if you
[1:21:22] quit are you with me now
[1:21:25] how they going to come back sister
[1:21:26] Stephanie if we quit if we give up how
[1:21:29] our children how our grandchildren what
[1:21:31] are they going to come
[1:21:34] to but R says the spirit of the Lord
[1:21:36] place that on your family say I claim
[1:21:38] them in the name of Jesus Christ I claim
[1:21:41] it God I don't know how you're going to
[1:21:43] make her do it and how you're going to
[1:21:45] make him do it but I believe it I
[1:21:48] believe it Lord help my unbelief claim
[1:21:51] it and Watch What Happens it'll do it
[1:21:54] again he said what must I do for my
[1:21:56] family use the same Faith you're using
[1:21:58] for yourself for your family commit them
[1:22:01] to the Lord and believe with all your
[1:22:03] heart can you believe with all your
[1:22:04] heart tonight right if our heart
[1:22:07] condemns us he said God is greater than
[1:22:09] our heart even if you made mistakes God
[1:22:12] you just trust in the atonement of
[1:22:15] God it's a whole lot easier to have
[1:22:17] faith if you do what God
[1:22:18] says but then you have confidence in God
[1:22:21] now look he said commit them to the Lord
[1:22:23] and believe with all your heart that
[1:22:25] they're going to be that you're going to
[1:22:26] be saved don't let it just come down on
[1:22:28] your natural thinking here Let It Drop
[1:22:30] way down on the inside all right that
[1:22:33] subconscious it never occurred to Samson
[1:22:36] that he couldn't win that
[1:22:38] fight are you hearing me Church it never
[1:22:41] occurred to him that he couldn't pick up
[1:22:43] those Gates it wasn't like he was trying
[1:22:46] to do something big he wasn't sitting
[1:22:47] there and say oh I got to build my faith
[1:22:49] up better go to church better read my
[1:22:51] Bible no it was subconscious faith when
[1:22:54] it need it done he stepped out and did
[1:22:56] it that's the kind of Faith you got to
[1:22:58] have for your children it's easy to have
[1:23:00] faith when they're all in church it's
[1:23:02] harder to have faith when they get out
[1:23:03] on their own and they're doing things
[1:23:05] that you'd have never dreamed they'd
[1:23:06] have done but that's when Faith takes
[1:23:08] hold that's when Faith grabs hold and
[1:23:10] brother R said Faith's got hair on his
[1:23:11] chest it's got big brwy muscles and
[1:23:14] Faith begins to speak and say I claim my
[1:23:16] family all right it's When Faith really
[1:23:19] has to has to have its muscles
[1:23:23] activated he said said he said don't let
[1:23:25] just come on your natural thing let it
[1:23:27] drop down that subconscious he said then
[1:23:29] they're yours God's give them to you
[1:23:31] when you've got it down
[1:23:34] here shouldn't even occur to us you know
[1:23:38] we get the the feeling like well you
[1:23:39] know maybe someday they'll probably go
[1:23:42] out I've told you before I can't even
[1:23:44] imagine that why because I believe
[1:23:47] they're going to make it I believe this
[1:23:49] is the generation that's going to make
[1:23:50] and these young people that sett from
[1:23:51] the front usually there's a lot more of
[1:23:53] them but I believe they're going to make
[1:23:55] it in spite of some of
[1:23:59] us come on church I told Brother Joel
[1:24:02] this week I said what happens in this
[1:24:03] church and I'm just preaching to you but
[1:24:05] what happens in this church I said the
[1:24:06] success if you could call it that in a
[1:24:09] church I said in our church is not going
[1:24:11] to be what so and so down the road does
[1:24:14] it's not going to be what another
[1:24:15] preacher does or what a pastor does or
[1:24:16] what an evangelist does or what some
[1:24:18] other church does it's going to be this
[1:24:20] generation of young people right are
[1:24:22] they going to make it I believe they're
[1:24:23] going to make it
[1:24:25] I believe they're going to make it why
[1:24:26] because somebody's got faith to believe
[1:24:27] it I want to be the first one to set
[1:24:29] that example I'm claiming these young
[1:24:31] people in the name of the Lord we got to
[1:24:33] claim our children come
[1:24:35] on you say well you know we just got to
[1:24:38] let them go out and do their thing and
[1:24:42] well let's just keep them in how about
[1:24:48] that let's let them preach without the
[1:24:52] scars all right let's let them sing
[1:24:54] without the without the bondage come on
[1:24:57] that thing that you fight through all
[1:24:58] the time because of the scars in your
[1:25:00] life let's raise a group of young people
[1:25:02] don't have to have that we might as well
[1:25:05] I believe it's
[1:25:07] possible I stand on the shoulders of the
[1:25:09] previous generation my mother and father
[1:25:11] who prayed and and my children stand on
[1:25:12] my shoulders and we want something
[1:25:14] better for them because we're getting
[1:25:16] closer and closer to the end time I
[1:25:19] don't believe one of them have to be
[1:25:22] lost God forbid that one would stray I
[1:25:24] believe they'll be
[1:25:29] back brother BR said you believe for
[1:25:32] your safety oh if you ever need a safet
[1:25:34] is today I just heard about another
[1:25:36] school shooting today that's not to make
[1:25:38] us scared but I I just hate having them
[1:25:40] out there in public school and it's not
[1:25:42] because of the so much the pull of the
[1:25:44] world although that's there but it was
[1:25:45] just a safety issue it just it got to me
[1:25:48] you know I'm thinking how there's
[1:25:49] nothing I can do about it but there's
[1:25:50] nothing you can do about it once they
[1:25:51] get old enough to get a job either could
[1:25:53] be workplace violence or anything else
[1:25:55] so I don't blame the schools it's just
[1:25:57] the culture that we live in it's just
[1:26:00] where we are but we got to believe for
[1:26:02] safety it's not just going on in the
[1:26:04] natural it's going on in the spiritual
[1:26:05] there's death everywhere there's there's
[1:26:07] spiritual death we see people falling
[1:26:09] away we see churches dying we see we see
[1:26:12] people with no spirit of God about them
[1:26:13] and no no ability to pray anymore no
[1:26:16] ability to call out to God and I say I
[1:26:17] want safety in this day of spiritual
[1:26:20] death I want to believe for my safety he
[1:26:23] said you believe for your safety and
[1:26:25] then apply the token for the whole
[1:26:26] family how can I do that claim it he
[1:26:29] said if it worked on you then you and
[1:26:31] the word becomes one he said amen see it
[1:26:34] works for both of you you and the word
[1:26:35] are one then apply it to your children
[1:26:37] apply it to your loved ones like Rahab
[1:26:40] did she applied the token to her father
[1:26:42] she applied it to her mother she applied
[1:26:44] it to her brothers and sisters and got
[1:26:45] them all in you realize she had no
[1:26:47] control over what any of them did they
[1:26:50] were grown
[1:26:51] people they weren't her children they
[1:26:53] weren't somebody she cared for they were
[1:26:55] grown people but they come in why she
[1:26:57] applied the token in her home yeah
[1:27:00] because she applied the token in her
[1:27:01] home her whole household was saved I
[1:27:03] believe we could do the same thing
[1:27:05] today I don't think it's so much brother
[1:27:08] ROM says sometimes we try to beat the
[1:27:09] devil out of a child I don't think it's
[1:27:10] so much in beating them although I do
[1:27:12] believe if you spare the rod you spil of
[1:27:13] the child so I believe in biblical
[1:27:16] discipline but it's not so much in
[1:27:17] beating them and and trying to make them
[1:27:18] do what we want them to do no it's apply
[1:27:20] that token ourselves let's make sure
[1:27:23] we're right ourselves let's make sure
[1:27:25] we're standing in the right place as a
[1:27:27] parent claim that
[1:27:29] child he said you apply it say Lord I'm
[1:27:33] going after my son going after my
[1:27:35] daughter I claim her Satan you turn her
[1:27:38] loose I'm coming after
[1:27:41] her oh I believe the spirit of the Lord
[1:27:43] is here tonight I apply my token the
[1:27:46] Holy Spirit apply my token you got to
[1:27:49] you got to have a confidence that it's
[1:27:50] there first and then apply
[1:27:53] it apply my token the Holy Spirit oh
[1:27:55] holy spirit that lives within me catch
[1:27:58] my daughter there I'm going to her now
[1:28:00] with your anointing upon me he'll do
[1:28:04] it you may not see it move all of a
[1:28:07] sudden but it'll
[1:28:08] move said but brother Ben I've had some
[1:28:10] that have passed away some relatives and
[1:28:12] friends and loved ones without coming to
[1:28:15] the lord well how do you
[1:28:19] know you see they don't have to come to
[1:28:21] an altar to come to the Lord
[1:28:25] I'm I'm telling you the truth tonight as
[1:28:27] far as I know it I've been I've been
[1:28:30] told that I preached too much grace I
[1:28:31] don't believe I do I don't believe I
[1:28:34] preach
[1:28:37] enough we've held on to our own we we've
[1:28:39] looked at our own works for too long
[1:28:42] that's why we're so up and down because
[1:28:45] our works will fail us his grace will
[1:28:48] never
[1:28:50] fail how do you know they didn't come to
[1:28:52] God why would you leave any different it
[1:28:55] doesn't take an hour to come to God it
[1:28:58] doesn't take a day just a
[1:29:03] breath just a
[1:29:05] breath c c can we can we just St in this
[1:29:07] for just a minute God's
[1:29:09] merciful see God interprets the
[1:29:13] heart right he interprets the heart and
[1:29:17] there's people who look ever so good but
[1:29:19] God interprets the
[1:29:21] heart and brother Brom talked about that
[1:29:24] with the little boy praying the
[1:29:26] alphabet he had never been taught how to
[1:29:28] pray you say well you worry about that
[1:29:31] say well I I didn't when I was younger I
[1:29:33] wasn't serving the lord and my children
[1:29:34] I didn't do everything right with my
[1:29:36] children and I look at them today well
[1:29:38] if that little little heart that heart
[1:29:40] of that child or that grown child can
[1:29:43] can actually want or desire God that's a
[1:29:47] blessing if there's something in their
[1:29:49] heart that wants God that desires God
[1:29:52] and here's a little boy in an alley
[1:29:54] praying and he don't know what to pray
[1:29:56] so what does he do he prays the alphabet
[1:29:58] he just says a b c d he goes all the way
[1:30:01] down the alphabet and and the pastor
[1:30:03] asked him said what are you doing he
[1:30:04] said I'm praying he said I don't know
[1:30:06] how to pray he said but I know I need to
[1:30:08] pray he said so I'm just praying I'm
[1:30:10] asking God to make sense of the
[1:30:12] words I'm asking God to put the letters
[1:30:15] together and make words with it I
[1:30:17] believe God accepted that a prophet
[1:30:19] taught that he
[1:30:20] did the only thing the thief on the
[1:30:23] cross ever did
[1:30:24] will say you don't deserve this and Lord
[1:30:28] remember
[1:30:30] me and nobody Hur him but
[1:30:37] Jesus I wonder sometimes if some of the
[1:30:39] people he robbed weren't in
[1:30:41] heaven he said he was a
[1:30:44] thief think about that I don't know if
[1:30:46] we can remember and when he gets into he
[1:30:49] didn't spend long in Paradise because it
[1:30:51] just you know got emptied all that time
[1:30:53] but
[1:30:54] but if you think about it and and here
[1:30:57] he comes he's like think I know you he
[1:31:00] like not
[1:31:03] me but it's a great story and someone
[1:31:05] has said this recently it's not original
[1:31:07] from me but he said here he's going
[1:31:09] around people are asking said how did
[1:31:10] you get in he said don't know when were
[1:31:12] you Justified don't know when were you
[1:31:14] Sanctified don't know when were you
[1:31:16] filled with the Holy Ghost don't know so
[1:31:18] what do you know said I just know the
[1:31:19] man on the middle cross said I could
[1:31:21] come
[1:31:24] right and he's the
[1:31:27] boss that's God's
[1:31:30] mercy see there's going to be people
[1:31:32] that that are going to be saved you all
[1:31:35] know this but I I want to reinforce this
[1:31:38] to us there's going to be people that
[1:31:39] are saved that don't know what they did
[1:31:43] to be saved there's going to be people
[1:31:45] who are given life who don't know what
[1:31:48] they did to be given
[1:31:51] life Matthew 25:31 when the son of man
[1:31:53] shall come in his glory and all the Holy
[1:31:55] Angels with him then shall he sit upon
[1:31:57] the throne of his glory before him shall
[1:31:59] be gathered all nations and he shall
[1:32:01] separate them one from another as the
[1:32:03] shepherd divided the sheep from the
[1:32:05] goats he said as the sheep from the
[1:32:06] goats he shall set the sheep on his
[1:32:08] right hand or on his right hand with the
[1:32:10] goats on the left and then shall the
[1:32:11] king say unto them on his right hand
[1:32:13] Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the
[1:32:15] Kingdom prepared for you from the
[1:32:18] foundation of the world he said for I
[1:32:20] was a hungered and you gave me meat I
[1:32:22] was thirsty and you gave me drink drink
[1:32:24] I was a stranger and you took me in
[1:32:26] naked and you clothed me I was sick and
[1:32:28] you visited me I was in prison and you
[1:32:30] came unto me and and all of us you know
[1:32:32] that that makes us feel good when we do
[1:32:34] good things and we ought to do good
[1:32:35] things but this isn't even
[1:32:38] us right because you don't get in that
[1:32:41] way you don't get in that way not if you
[1:32:44] you know better you know you have to
[1:32:46] have the grace of God and you know the
[1:32:49] message of the hour you've been taught
[1:32:50] that and so you don't get in just by
[1:32:51] being nice right you go you go in
[1:32:54] because your sins have been
[1:32:56] forgiven right but these go come in and
[1:33:00] they protest they said then shall the
[1:33:02] righteous answer him saying Lord when
[1:33:04] saw we thee hunger fed thee or thirsty
[1:33:06] and gave thee drink they don't even
[1:33:08] remember doing it when saw we the a
[1:33:10] stranger and took thee in her naked and
[1:33:12] clothed thee when saw we thee sick or in
[1:33:14] prison and came unto thee and the King
[1:33:16] shall answer and say unto them verily I
[1:33:18] say unto you in as much as you have done
[1:33:20] it unto one of the least of these my
[1:33:22] brethren you have done it unto me did
[1:33:24] you know while Paul was in a prison in
[1:33:28] Rome somebody and I don't know who it
[1:33:30] was somebody in the Roman bureaucracy
[1:33:32] decided that Paul could be under house
[1:33:35] arrest and still write
[1:33:37] letters and I'm glad that they did
[1:33:39] because we wouldn't have these wonderful
[1:33:40] Epistles that we have today the prison
[1:33:42] Epistles unless somebody allowed that it
[1:33:45] may have been some government bureaucrat
[1:33:47] that drank wine all of his life and and
[1:33:50] and did everything wrong all of his life
[1:33:52] don't think about that but there may be
[1:33:54] a soldier there or a man there who just
[1:33:56] let Paul write some letters all right
[1:33:59] yeah he did it to the least of these my
[1:34:00] brethren he said you did it unto
[1:34:02] me see brother brand said these aren't
[1:34:04] the bride the bride sits with him in
[1:34:06] judgment you find that in 1 Corinthians
[1:34:07] 62 the Saints will judge the world 63
[1:34:10] that we will judge
[1:34:12] angels we sit with him Daniel 7:9 it
[1:34:15] says the Ancient of Days did sit and
[1:34:17] describes him 710 it says a fiery stream
[1:34:19] issued and came forth before him
[1:34:21] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[1:34:23] him that's us and 10,000 time 10,000
[1:34:27] stood before him the Judgment was set
[1:34:30] and the books were open now you're
[1:34:32] sitting here thinking
[1:34:33] well and I feel that sometimes you know
[1:34:36] we had a word prophit I know sometimes
[1:34:39] you sit there and think well you know
[1:34:40] brother Ben you're just taking brother
[1:34:41] Brown's word for that well that'd be
[1:34:43] good for me to do that but but you don't
[1:34:45] have to in this
[1:34:47] case think about it he was a word
[1:34:50] Prophet because he brought his Doctrine
[1:34:52] from the word from the Bible where in
[1:34:55] the Bible does it say you kids can write
[1:34:57] this down if you want to if you're if
[1:34:59] you're taking notes where in the Bible
[1:35:01] actually my daughter told me the other
[1:35:02] day she only takes notes when it's
[1:35:06] boring I don't know about
[1:35:08] that but where where in the Bible does
[1:35:11] it say that there's no
[1:35:14] judgment snap quiz no judgment for the
[1:35:17] for the believer there's a there's a
[1:35:19] scripture that says that it's John 5:24
[1:35:24] you know that John 5:24 verily verily I
[1:35:27] say unto you he that heareth my word
[1:35:31] that's understands in the original he
[1:35:33] that understands my word and believeth
[1:35:35] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[1:35:37] life and shall not come into
[1:35:40] condemnation underline that word
[1:35:41] condemnation or write it down but is
[1:35:44] passed from Death to life that word
[1:35:46] congregation or condemnation of the
[1:35:48] original is Crisis judgment legal case
[1:35:52] it refers to the process process event
[1:35:54] or the result of legal proceedings
[1:35:56] intended to evaluate
[1:35:59] punishment these are being
[1:36:02] evaluated whether they were good or bad
[1:36:04] whether they were good to people or not
[1:36:06] whether they but you will not be
[1:36:09] evaluated why you've passed from Death
[1:36:13] to life already brother B said that's
[1:36:15] past tense a word Prophet taught because
[1:36:18] of this verse we would not come into
[1:36:21] judgment
[1:36:24] go look it up if you want
[1:36:26] to I know there's people that believe
[1:36:28] that if you die while speeding you'll go
[1:36:29] to hell it's
[1:36:31] nonsense praise
[1:36:35] God I had a Pentecostal man tell me that
[1:36:37] one time if you died doing something
[1:36:39] wrong You' go to hell
[1:36:41] immediately what kind of God is
[1:36:44] that number one he's not strong enough
[1:36:46] to keep you and then and then he going
[1:36:48] to let you do wrong and then make you
[1:36:50] live in a flesh body and then the minute
[1:36:52] you do something wrong take you off the
[1:36:54] Earth that's not very not very
[1:36:58] good I've had that same attitude around
[1:37:00] the message had a lady tell us I've told
[1:37:02] you this before but she said what would
[1:37:03] you do if the Rapture happened while you
[1:37:05] were on that roller coaster
[1:37:07] well just a little
[1:37:10] closer be a missing
[1:37:14] Rider right I mean what do you mean what
[1:37:17] would we do we go because the case has
[1:37:20] been
[1:37:22] dismissed es still had a case they had a
[1:37:25] case to be adjudicated they had they
[1:37:27] they had to come before the Judgment
[1:37:30] those had a case but there there are
[1:37:32] those who have no case against him
[1:37:34] that's you and I he said who they I I
[1:37:37] trust you one of those today they were
[1:37:39] remembered these were remembered for
[1:37:41] their kindness to God's people brother
[1:37:43] upon what grounds to the enter into life
[1:37:44] eternal certainly not upon the fact
[1:37:46] they've already have his life as does
[1:37:47] the bride but they receive it because
[1:37:49] they were kind to his Brethren he tells
[1:37:51] us that their names must have been in
[1:37:53] the book of life and not
[1:37:55] removed he said now because of their so
[1:37:57] they weren't just just anybody but they
[1:37:59] were in The Book of Life he said because
[1:38:01] some are never never there but these
[1:38:03] were he said now because of their love
[1:38:05] of the people of God they are recognized
[1:38:07] and saved yes God's a merciful god and
[1:38:11] I'm saying this because when someone
[1:38:13] passes away many times and We Don't
[1:38:15] Preach them into Heaven We Don't Preach
[1:38:16] them into hell either because we don't
[1:38:19] know
[1:38:22] right he said because of their love of
[1:38:24] the people of God they're recognized and
[1:38:25] saved no doubt these served and helped
[1:38:27] the children of God perhaps like
[1:38:29] Nicodemus and gel they stood for the
[1:38:30] children in a time of trouble oh my you
[1:38:34] realize that's what the thief on the
[1:38:35] cross did he stood for Jesus in a time
[1:38:38] of trouble he said you don't deserve
[1:38:40] this and Jesus said tomorrow you'll be
[1:38:42] with
[1:38:43] me see the Bible says he that receiveth
[1:38:45] you receiveth me and he that receiveth
[1:38:47] me receiveth him that sent me if you
[1:38:49] receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:38:51] prophet you receive a prophet's reward
[1:38:53] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[1:38:54] a righteous man shall receive a
[1:38:56] righteous man's reward and whosoever
[1:38:58] shall give to drink unto one of these
[1:39:00] little ones a cup of cold water he said
[1:39:03] only in the name of a disciple verily I
[1:39:06] say unto you he shall in no wise lose
[1:39:09] his reward I'm closing with this if you
[1:39:11] musicians want to go ahead and
[1:39:14] come brother BR said what about a
[1:39:16] brother that's made a
[1:39:18] mistake now I'm going to say this if
[1:39:20] he's made a mistake he's a brother he'll
[1:39:22] quickly repent
[1:39:25] to quickly repent he won't try to
[1:39:27] justify it he won't try to moralize it
[1:39:32] or say it was somebody else's fault to
[1:39:35] repent the brand said though I say he's
[1:39:37] wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when
[1:39:39] he's not wrong but if he is wrong he
[1:39:43] said well if we will take him to the
[1:39:45] throne of
[1:39:47] God H how can we do that because we get
[1:39:51] access to the throne because we've
[1:39:52] already passed
[1:39:54] from Death to
[1:39:56] life it gives us access to the throne of
[1:40:01] God to stand there shoulder toosh
[1:40:05] shoulder with our
[1:40:07] brother knowing he's a
[1:40:11] mortal I like this you know and I don't
[1:40:14] want us to think say well that means I
[1:40:15] can never disagree with anybody no we
[1:40:17] need to stay with the word yes and to do
[1:40:19] that sometimes you'll have to disagree
[1:40:20] with people it's just the way it is you
[1:40:22] need to protect protect your family you
[1:40:24] need to you need to help those that need
[1:40:26] help and you need to correct those that
[1:40:27] need correction sometimes that's love
[1:40:30] said if you see somebody going over the
[1:40:31] cliff you don't just you don't just sit
[1:40:33] back and wait on them to go over you you
[1:40:35] scream at them stop doing what you're
[1:40:37] doing yes but yet we recognize our
[1:40:40] brother is Immortal we take him to the
[1:40:42] throne of God maybe his destination
[1:40:45] rests upon our attitude towards
[1:40:48] him not his attitude towards us but our
[1:40:51] attitude towards him because our
[1:40:53] attitude towards him many times will
[1:40:56] dictate his attitude towards
[1:40:58] us when we come back from the Throne of
[1:41:01] God he said we'll realize that we're
[1:41:02] everyone
[1:41:04] guilty see we are judged
[1:41:07] here right that's what we're doing right
[1:41:09] here tonight we're at the Judgment seat
[1:41:11] of God so we don't have to be judged
[1:41:14] we're there realize we're everyone
[1:41:16] guilty we all need help one from the
[1:41:18] other and the best way to
[1:41:20] do is
[1:41:22] pray amen amen I trust that that'll help
[1:41:25] in some way I I don't know I don't I
[1:41:28] don't you don't just pick things to
[1:41:29] preach you just try to follow the mind
[1:41:31] of the Lord and I trust it'll be a
