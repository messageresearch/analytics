the Lord isn't it amen amen First Kings chapter 22 verse 51 sister Heather I didn't see you over there God bless you this morning thank you for being with us and uh your daughter there as well and all of you today First Kings 22 51. it says ahaziah the son of Ahab began to Reign Over Israel in Samaria the 17th year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned two years over Israel and he did evil in the sight of the Lord he walked in the way of his father in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nibat who made Israel to sin for he served Baal and worshiped him and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel according to all that his father had done sobering words isn't it according to all that his father had done and then II kings 1 and 1 continues on says then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire of belzebub the god of ekron whether I shall recover of this disease for the Lord would add his Blessing to the word this morning you may be seated I want to continue to talk to you and those that are watching and listening many of the families that are out today I want to continue to talk to you about a home to go back to or a home to come back to last week we talked about the prodigal son and how that as when he came to himself and he was he was in a place that a son shouldn't have been in but he was still a son and he was doing something a son shouldn't have been doing but he was still a son aren't you glad that God didn't take you out of the family when you failed and when you were a sinner and when you were messed up and when you back said and he didn't kick you out of the family but he he you were still a son and and so he was still a son during that time in the pig pen in the mud and the Monk and the things that he was in he was still he was still the son and because of that he had a memory of what home was like he somehow he could look back and he could see that there was a home life that was different than the life that he lived and at the very best of what he could make his life now the the very worst of his home life was better than that yeah and and so we talked about how that we could make our homes a place that they could if they were like the prodigal son if our children God forbid would grow up and decide to leave and didn't want anything to do with the gospel that when they came to themselves because we're promised our children do you believe that tonight but when they come to themselves there's something that they can go back to there's a there's a place there's a home there's a reality of life and and so the prodigal son he's in the pig pen and he has a strange thought he says he come to himself and he said hey here I am feeding myself for wanting to feed myself with the with the hus with the with the rejects with the with the things that are given to the pigs with pig food and he said I would have even liked to have had that and they won't even let me have that he's sitting here starving and he said how much better my father treats his servant right so he could remember what his father's home was like and it made him want to go back even if he couldn't be a son anymore even if he couldn't live like he used to he still wanted to go back because because he knew that even the very worst of his father's home these servants were treated with fairness and we talked about having our home that way brother Branham called it a nice home and a happy home said you want a place that you're teenagers they get older would want to come back to a nice home and a happy home and we wouldn't necessarily think about that he said well we want to lay down the law and make sure everything's right and there's a place for that and we'll talk about some of those things this morning but the things that he pointed out especially as they get older is that we should have a place that they want to come back to so now we find as we use this example this morning why would ahaziah the king a king of Israel why would he choose to go to a different God then the god of Israel for healing when he was in desperate need of healing and Elijah was in the land so we could say it like this today the message was there the message was there and yet and we've seen it with with children before we've seen children that will leave the message and then even when they get in their life you see my kids as low as they can go they seek out other gods and sometimes now remember there's always an exception to the rule but sometimes that's because of their home life right because home was so awful that they don't want what Mom and Dad have so they would almost be willing to go anywhere else or on the other hand that they were taught so much by the actions of their mother and father that it wasn't important that the message didn't matter right right because we only did that when we went to church anyway I'm going to preach this morning and I hate it that I hated that some of the folks are going you can Pitchfork on them and they can sit at home and Pitchfork on you and that's fine but but I think we should all take it personally today I know I do you know this home life can be so bad yeah the kids don't want nothing the memories are so awful and you say well I don't I don't think our home is that way and and I trust that it's not I believe you're all Christians here today and and good people and you try to raise your kids in the right way but yet it has that possibility of being that way because we're human yeah and sometimes what we as adults do we don't realize how that affects our children right I heard a story of a man a preacher who had been arguing with his wife and and they said some pretty harsh things to one another and and he had a three-year-old son and they the son they thought was in the bedroom asleep and and a few days later he said he was walking uh down the hallway and he heard his son in his room and he reheard the argument the sun was inside the room actually he had heard all of it and was able to repeat it and was talking to his little toys and things in the same way that he had talked to his mother and he realized that the sun hurt a lot more than what he thought and a lot of times they hear the the harshness of it and the and the disagreement but they don't get to see what lays beneath that is maybe even a stable marriage but all the children see is to the outside and and so they see harshness and that's why we have to be careful how we deal publicly with things even in the church because we want our church home to be nice and to be happy but many times when we deal with certain things in a public way and we deal with them harshly that's all kids remember they remember the bad business meeting they remember the time so-and-so had to leave and they remember the splits and the and the times that that we spent fighting with one another listen that should not be the memory that we leave our children about church it shouldn't be a memory of some kind of church split or some kind of a struggle or a trouble that the church wins through but all that we can leave our children the memory of a place where the Holy Ghost was there where people could feel the presence of God where the preaching where the word was preaching where there was love one for the other and and to remember a place like that isn't that what you want that's what I want I told Brother Alan here a couple years ago when we first came and I think I told the church as well I said oh I I want so badly just to have a place where we can go where there's no agenda where there's nothing that somebody pushing something where we can hear the word preaching and whether I'm preaching it or somebody else is it doesn't matter where we can fellowship with our brothers and sisters and we're not only have an agenda against some other church somewhere and I believe I told you at one point I said I think we're almost there I say I think we're almost there today but the humanity would always try to come in and the devil is always going to try to come in and mess that up yes sir that's his job and we're human right so we need to fight for that to have a home that's not just about a bunch of fights a bunch of fusses who were against what we're against who we're for come on that's our Lord Jesus Christ do you love him today we can present and I'm spending way too long on the introduction here but y'all just forgive me I'll cut off some off the end you don't believe that do you we can present the message in such a way that the memory of it for our children is just the message people are bad I'll tell you what you can say what you want to about message people if there's anybody going to make a rapture it's going to be people who heard this message because the message was the shout right so I kind of get I get a little bit upset when you talk about message people you're talking about me yeah yes we have our problems so we have our circumstances yes we live in laodicea yes we 've culture and everything else pressing on us but there is a bride that will not fall yes sir yes there's a mixed multitude but there's got to be somebody who will be a real mom and dad in our day gotta be somebody who lived for the Lord got to be somebody who will walk the right kind of a walk yeah in our day so if we're not careful we present just a memory of negativity to our children that's all they ever hear that's all they ever remember God help us today and so now Elijah is in the land Ahab and Jezebel have died fulfilling prophecy and may Isaiah saw that he knew that but yet he turns to the God be elzibah brother Branham gives us an insight into why he did he said now we found find out that this ahaziah was the son of Ahab and Jezebel he would come out of a cursed family what that meant was that they had been cursed by Elijah you remember because of what they did he said when you take a family that's raising their children in the wrong atmosphere you can't hardly expect anything else let me brother Stuart Joel you're gonna have to stay with me this morning because we're gonna plow kind of Deep and watch you can't hardly expect anything else when the atmosphere we can't fix in five minutes what took you 25 years right to mess up right and then you finally come to the pastor Pastor fix it right that can't be done yeah right it may take 25 years yeah yeah unless God just does a miracle you understand he could do that aren't you glad he does that he doesn't some of us weren't raised in very good homes but we but that memory did not take us away from it but because we're a seed of God we cried out to God anyway we come to God that's the grace of God like the woman at the well because she had representation in heaven she was raised wrong she was led out into the world everything that could be done to her was wrong but she had representation in heaven and so he preached about that over the last couple weeks how did she God moved Jonah to go to Nineveh so that there would be Samaritans so the Samaritan woman could come because brother Brown said she fell from his thoughts and if she fell from the thoughts of God she had to go back to the thoughts of God she had a home to go back to and I don't care what your home life was like if there if you have a seed of God on the inside there's a home for you yeah there's a home to go back to but now if you raised your children in the wrong atmosphere he said you can't hardly expect anything else the atmosphere of your home is the conditions you create by your words and actions just like the atmosphere of a church is a condition that the pastor creates largely the pastor and and the people you understand what the pastor sets the tone it's like a man sets the tone in the home a pastor sets the tone in in a church in the atmosphere of the church is the condition we create by our words and actions God help us today I only want an atmosphere of love and joy and peace long-suffering now it's a strange thing brother Branham said that a man that's supposed to be an Israelite would consult such as that instead of going back to the very God that brought them over into that land and give it to them because he was trying to follow the trend of the day and after his father and mother he went after beelzebuck which was the worst of the Canaanite gods the Elsa Bob literally means Lord of the Flies Lord of the Flies and he was the god the Canaanite god of healing Lord of the Flies instead of going after the great physician instead of following instead of listening to a prophet that was in the land at that time instead of going back to the message when he had problems he went to the Lord of the Flies and this had tragic consequences for his life and again in second Kings chapter one let's go back there in verse three he said but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the piss by rise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria I just love the way God does this because here The Messengers are going down they think in privacy with a secret message from the King because publicly he has to still be an Israelite King he has to serve Jehovah but primarily he serves Baal right so now he's sending them down after Blvd to go inquire and be else about they think on a private mission on a secret mission from the King and God tells Elijah what the king said to The Messengers and said go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire a bills about the god of ekron and brother random preaches that in his sermon called why where he preaches from the words of Jeremiah he said is there no balm in Gilead is there no healing in the house of God and I see people today and I I don't I don't I don't want to hurt you this morning or blame you but many times people go after uh counseling that's not even Christian and they will leave and I and I I want to be careful there because sometimes counseling helps but counseling can only identify a problem is it because there's no balm in Gilead that you first seek other things that's right is it because there's no truth in the message of the hour that you look on the internet to see how to raise your children hope you hear me today and again those things can be good they can add to it but be careful brother said wisdom was fine as long as it agreed with the word but word don't agree with the word you need to run from is it because there's no counsel in the house of God is that why you run after other things is it because there's no physician in the house of God and I think sometimes that's why because the house of God has become so dead and cold and formal and starchy that there's no healing left and there's no power left and there's no God left there and so the people run after other things and you see the young people just as soon as they're old enough to go they run out why because they don't see any power of God but Lord help us today to have a church to have a home to have a place where there's still the power of God operating where God can still move well we still believe that God Is A Healer yes because if we don't present that to the people then they'll seek after other things especially our unconverted children now look and that's where we get mixed up so I'll go here it'll be okay I'll I'll run over here it'll be all right and what you don't understand is you're not affecting yourself you've been a Christian a long time you'll be okay what you're most affecting is the lives of your children that's right and you might tell me this morning I said brother Ben I don't have any children but you affect my children and these other children he said well how can that be well because of the life that you live you set an example as a Christian you come to church and claim to be a Christian yeah see that's a different thing then and I know that parents don't ask for show of hands most of the parents are watching this morning and not here but but I know that if you if you're watching even or if you're here if you're a parent you've heard this from your children well so-and-so's a Christian why do they why are they allowed to do that why did they get by with that and it's a hard one of the hardest things to explain to your children is why people can do things that aren't right and still be Christians and then you teach them about the grace of God and the power of God and how God can change people and those things but but but but still try to set a standard in front of them that's right because we want to be right he says is it because there's no God in Israel he said now therefore thus saith the Lord thou shall not come down from that bed on which Thou Art gone up but shall surely die and Elijah departed now I want to look more closely at what kind of atmosphere was in his eyes home first and I'm gonna have to hurry along here his home life was a result of a mixed marriage between a heathen and a backseat in Israelite King Ahab and Jezebel and if you want to know what kind of a home Jezebel had I challenged you to go listen to uh to Jezebel I think he calls it brother calls it painted face Jezebel there's a sermon where brother Brown takes Jezebel and talks about her home life and what it was like and what kind of a woman that she was and he talked about how that she would come in and it almost sounds funny when he says it but he said she would come in and he said she had them red long fingernails and and pain under her eyes and said she'd be sucking on a cigarette and she'd come in and then and then Ahab would come home at night and she'd slam the door and go sit in the corner and say uh wash the dishes and they have a wash the dishes because she couldn't do that with those hands and and so the home was all out of order right and you can't really blame Jezebel because that's the way she was raised that's just who she was right she that's just who she was she was a heathen but the the real problem and as we look at this many times the real problem is a man or a pastor if we take it to the church a man who won't stand for what's right yeah right there's got to be a man in the home yeah that'll stand for what's right in order for the home to be right and again God gives Grace for all kinds of different situations I'm not trying to condemn you today if there's a different situation in your home but I'm just speaking of the model home of of the family the way God meant for it to be there's got to be a man and a man's made the way he is for a reason right for Redemption just like a woman is made how she is for a reason it's not a lesser thing it's not a Lester thing people talk about the byproduct when brother Brown mentions that and it sounds bad sounds like oh it's just some byproduct some lesser things that's not what that word means at all it just means she's part of him brother random expressed it this way she is him yeah bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power we are a byproduct of Christ in other words we couldn't redeem ourselves Eve could not redeem herself right Adam had to go out with her in order to redeem her even though he was not deceived but he had to go out with her Jesus had to die for us so we could be redeemed we could not redeem ourselves no amount of legalistic living or or even like the things we're talking about this one he said well I I do all those things to the letter that don't save you right you're saved by Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ you could not save yourself but a man and woman are different for that reason a man a man redeems his family he's the strength of the family and woman a woman is the softness is he is the ability to of Rebirth of of Grace and you see the law and Grace there and you see you see works and Grace Works in faith right in the marriage of man and a woman so now in First Kings 16 and 31. it says it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk and speaking of Ahab in the sins of jeroboam the son of nibat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of f Bell King of the zydonians and went and served the Baal and worshiped him are we still okay this morning I I spent a long time on the introduction but we're now getting to the meat of it and then we'll get out of it and y'all can go home and lick your wounds and come back this afternoon brother Joel will be preaching and I'm sure it'll be wonderful you'll all enjoy it now Ahab was a borderline believer you know what that is a borderline believer go look that up in the message a borderline believer in other words he was a Believer when it was convenient to be a believer all right he was borderline as long as everything was going okay in the church praise God he was there as long as there was riches and wealth and coming his way praise he was an Israelite King he was a wonderful man but he was borderline and sometimes you'll even find that Ahab would repent and walk softly before God but it didn't last very long he was borderline hey Jose he wasn't all together bad he wasn't altogether good it was borderline but the Branham again picks this up he said hey Isaiah was the son of Ahab been brought up in the kind of a home that was a lukewarm home it wasn't altogether Christian now watch we talked last week about having a nice home and a happy home now we're going to talk about the difference between a lukewarm home and a home that's on fire for God right he said they brought up in a kind of a home that was a lukewarm home it wasn't altogether Christian his mother was a heathen and his father had married out of Fellowship married a woman that was not a Believer and that always makes a bad home for any kid to be raised in when unbelief in faith tries to mix together right now and and we'll get back to that in a moment he said now if the father would have been a real strong man in his faith why did they decide go look at looking after other gods he said if the father had been a real strong man in his faith the child might have had a better opportunity remember the son still got to choose on his own that's right he still has to receive the token by it for himself but if the father had been a real strong man in the faith the child might have had a better opportunity but he didn't he didn't well I thank God for the strong men even young men that I see raised it up around the message so you strong men in the faith you can talk him out of it he says the father had been a strong man in the faith the child might have had a better opportunity but he didn't he didn't have he knew that there was a God he knew that there was a Jehovah he said and then his mother's gods and so forth he was all confused then after the death of his father this boy in this condition kind of mixed up one way and another and if that ain't a picture of the lands today one in the family is this away one another one going this way one going that way he said no wonder we are producing so much juvenile delinquency all other kinds of stuff under the name of Christianity it's because there is no Unity now watch where he goes in the home there's no unity in the home there is no real call out and stand for God right there's no Unity oh don't you realize that the devil wants to do the same thing in your home he wants to do the same thing in the church he wants to produce disunity to where you begin to fight and fuss with one another and you begin to you begin to talk about one another I'm not just talking to parents this morning and I'm talking just talking to those with children I'm talking to all of us what kind of a home what kind of a church home do we want to have if you find that you've you've you've slipped out and you begin to be in disunity with the people of God now you know there's sometimes when there's things you just can't stand for and you shouldn't right yeah there's times the unity doesn't work if there's no truth in it yeah yeah but where the truth is being preached and people are trying to live right and do what's right and trying to preach what the the message says there should be Unity that's right that's right and there should be Unity even among from different churches and I'll stand for that and I've had to I've had to cut off a little bit of my own flesh if you could say it that way I had to I've had to uh I've had to sanctify myself in this way that people will come and go people will come and go and they have a right to you go where you want to go to church or where you feel like going to church I want people to want to be here are you with me the song I Want You to Want to be here I want you to want to be in the house of God I know many of you even that are sick this morning or if you're not able to be here all the time some of you drive a long ways to go to church I understand that you want to be here but that's what we want is that desire that's what we want to see when we begin to preach about you misunderstand we begin to preach about people missing Church we're not talking about somebody that wants to be there we're talking about those who don't want to be there right there's something they've lost that desire for the word they've lost that desire for the things of God tell me if you're in church are you just sitting there like a bump on a pickle and nothing means anything to you there's something wrong I know some people aren't emotional but if you get to a place where your heart can never amen the word where there's no response at all the word a tear never comes down your eye you just have no response at all I tell you what there's so you need to go checking up yeah oh because brother Adam said anything without emotion and he's not talking about just wild running around the aisles and we could do that too I praise God for that that's not just what he's talking about but if there's no emotion yeah it's dead right he said it ought to be buried and just check our own lives and I can say as a pastor brother Stewart and I've seen this over the years a hundred times out of a hundred we try to make exceptions of Washington Ministries and say well he's just tending more towards being a teacher that means a bad preacher I think and but I know so again people are different people different styles I mean I'm not condemning that but when you have a man it was once on fire and he's not anymore something happened that's right something happened that's not my fault or somebody else's fault he needs to get right back to God that's right that's right and he'd come out of his back sitting condition now that applies to all of us too yes we need to get back to God if the message doesn't affect us anymore if it doesn't bother us when when we do things so little things that are wrong if it does there's nothing there it just we just kind of can flip in or slip out and there's just no emotion at all we need to bury that come on come back to the house of God come back to God come back to the Altar and say Lord let me feel that newness again let me come back to what I was when I was a new Christian I read it just I may have it here in my notes I don't remember but I just read it this week brother Branham said that he said I want to feel like I did when I was born again I want that same feeling in the church sure that news he said that I feel like when when I was here when I'm here he said out in the desert and I have those experiences with God yes oh God help us today so brother said one is this way and one side when there's no real call out in the stand for God again he said Ahab was a borderline believer just a fellow that believed enough to make him miserable and we've all met people like that haven't we maybe we've been people like that at some point in our lives just believe enough to make us miserable and the answer to that is not to find something to do because then you'll be a miserable deacon or a miserable trustee or a miserable song leader Lord help us all right preach at you guys this morning but I mean if you're miserable anyway and we need to give you a job to help you feel better about yourself you're going to be more miserable yeah that's right all right so that's not what we're doing I'm gonna have to hide behind this desk before I get done but look he was a if you're a borderline believer that's what makes you miserable he said did you ever see people like that well they have conception that they would like to go to church and do right they feel like it'd make them a better social person in their social lives now watch your brother random takes this now he said maybe for the sake of their children they think they ought to maybe belong to church now it's interesting that brother Branham teaches us and we'll we'll get deeper into it today before I quit and but now he teaches us that to keep your children in church it's so essential yes right to to having a nice home and a happy home to having a to having children that raise are raised in the fear and admonition the lord it's essential to keep those children in the house of God but if you only come to church for that reason yeah he said you'd be better off enough to come he said maybe for the sake of their children they think they ought to maybe belong to church if that isn't the most miserable person I know of yes he said I tell you that's the best of Cut Loose he said that the best cut loose all shorelines and launch out of the deep or don't go at all yeah oh God help us today we might as well be free in the house of God yeah come on we're not slaves we're not working on a chain gang oh God go to church while I'm on the Chain Gang I got my hand Shackled you know I can't help nobody gotta sit in church today because I I well why do you go well the pastor will preach at me foreign it's his job all right well so and so you know I'm the Chain Gang I you know if I don't go to church I I I'll begin to you know they'll pull me this way and the peer pressure will get to me this way but I'm so unhappy if I could just be released into heaven into the glory you won't be happy there either you realize you wouldn't be happy in heaven if you're not happy in the house of God right I'm just preaching to you this morning that you would not be happy in heaven if you are miserable in the house of God you would be miserable in heaven because it's one great big meeting yes I don't that scares some of us oh I don't want to go to those wild meetings where they jump and shout and they scream you realize don't you that heaven is one big meeting right that's right yeah he said well brother Ben I did it they'd preach they preach more and not sing so much at the meeting they only won't even preach in heaven as far as I know just one big me boy that some of y'all don't even go anymore do you say man laughs I have four or five days of church my goodness I'm glad we won't count time like we do here and there will be no escaping it listen if you feel like you're in the Chain Gang down here and that's why you come to the house of God you're going to feel that way up there that's why people that feel that way probably won't go there there's got to be something in your heart there's got to be a desire to shake that that's not able to see it making you feel that way that's the culture of the age making you feel that way shake that thing off Church shouldn't be a miserable experience right now we talked about that what's the best way to keep your children home they said brother Randall was going to tell them now you set the rules be out at a certain time be out no he said encourage them he said to go with Believers yes yes discourage them from going with unbelievers that's right he said to make your home so nice and so happy that they'll want to stay the home shouldn't be a miserable experience excuse me Church shouldn't be a miserable experience it ought to be a place where we can worship God we can love one another we can raise our hands we can shout we can praise God and and we can hear the word we can be changed we can be better than when we came in but we say well I have to for the sake of my children you might as well just stay home huh he said just simply stay home or either go all the way for Christ God wants somebody who will really go all the way give all you got soul body and spirit to the service of the Lord he said now this borderline Believers I called him a few minutes ago oh he he kind of had a mental conception of his theology he thought well there is a God but maybe Balaam is God too and the others and so forth and his wife kind of got him mixed up in that he said you know boys I'm telling you tonight you young ladies be careful of who you marry you'll have a broken home the first thing you know he said it's not good Sinners and Christians to marry together don't be unequally yoked together because that's what God Ahab now if you watch the messages occurred to me the other day but if we watch the message now today we seem to be obsessed with how people Court and say this because we've had several young couples lately and and uh I'll talk about Gabe Milly because they just come through that but it just seemed like we were all obsessed with how people Court you know and you gotta do what the rules are not every home has their own I'm not preaching on you this morning you got your right to every home every father has the right to make his own rules and all of those things amen we still believe that but that's not what brother random was obsessed with go read the message she doesn't talk a lot about it he doesn't talk a lot about how he talks a lot about who right because even if you do everything right yeah and you make no mistakes but you just married somebody because that's just the only available person or or or because you're attracted to them just physically or marry someone out this that's never come to Christ whether they're on a church Peter or not you marry somebody like that you're going to end up with a broken home more likely than not unless God do some miraculously intervenes now he said brother Ben will my my wife or my husband they might be out there somewhere they might be but you don't go looking for them out there yeah let them come in and get saved and get born again before you start going with them could God change that situation absolutely but but let's stay with the word yes let's let's not focus on the exception let's focus on the rule I know brother random was concerned with who marry a believer hey man I'm so happy to see some of you young couples Noli and Levi getting married and so you young couples have just been married marry a Believer God bless you for that you'll have enough problems with a believer that right brother Gabe maybe no is that right sister Millie I asked the wrong person I saw sister Millie holding the baby today I I don't I think that's her niece but it looks good this looks right they're holding the baby now but but we want to be obsessed with how and we put so much pressure on people this is outside my notes but you just hang with me today but but brother Brown's focused on who yeah that's right he said pray I say pray like you've never prayed before because there's no other decision in life that can't be undone but this one pray ER understood because you want to get out of the house pray and we shouldn't be so obsessed with what or how but who the Bible says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband oh thank God in other words she she's the beautiful part if you watch the funeral for Queen Elizabeth that Crown how beautiful that was I thought it was silver but when they come up close to it it was diamonds over that Crown there's no telling what that thing's worth that's your wife Brothers if she's a virtuous woman she's a crowd she she is what he said well I have authority in the home she is what gives you that Authority amen that's right right she's what she allows you she's submissive to you and she's Godly and she loves you and so she allows you to have that Authority she's your crown a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones if rottenness gets in the bones it'll spread and it'll end up making the man so weak you can't stand oh God that was ahab's problem Jezebel with rottenness in his bones and he injected it by marrying her First Kings 18 17 it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah the Ahab said unto her said unto him art thou he the trouble of Israel now watch we're looking at how that home was that home was a place where the prophet got blamed for all of the problems right we've seen places like that haven't we yeah the prophet got blamed for all of the problems it happened saw Elijah he said are you he that troubles Israel Elijah followed up he said no you in your father's house what was it the problem was not the doctor or the medicine it was not the preacher yeah go listen to the sermon why that brother Brown preaches over and over again it's that you've never taken it God help us today brother random said so it is today men and women will sit in the church in the church few hear the unadulterated gospel the power of the Holy Ghost see the manifestations and demonstrations of his Spirit of a living resurrected Christ and die in sin standing in the church few not because there's no bomb but because not be not because there's no physician but it's because the people are too stubborn to take the medicine trying to find the least way of resistance going the way of the world perishing in the game saying of Korah oh God help us today you realize that'll only get worse and worse because to be a borderline believer you're going to have to move farther and farther over towards the world you can't just stay where you are you're going to have to keep getting closer and closer to the world because the world is getting farther and farther away from God so to be a borderline believer you're gonna have to move you're going to have to keep making concessions to the devil God help us not to do that today see many folks blame the message for their problems but they never listen to it or lived it they blame the message for it right right and it's not the message is fault it's not God's fault because the message is Christ you believe that now there's a reason why God's order is set up the way it is are you still with me this morning I hope I'm not boring you I I know some of you just come for the wedding shower and and uh well I didn't call it a baby shower praise God I told David if I mentioned I'm not going to mention that wedding shirt if I do call it a baby shower but I guess I kind of did didn't I by telling you all that but if you're just here for that and we're glad that you're here but I don't want to bore you this morning but let's try to focus on the word for a minute and you that are watching as well we we need to know these things oh look Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done now notice the dynamic in their home it says and with all how he had signed all the prophets with the sword so now AB goes up and you remember the story Elijah calls fire down out of heaven and so they come out and they kill the prophets of Baal and Ahab goes sleeking back into Samaria and complains to his wife because that's ahab's nature he's not going to stand against anything and so Ahab comes back in Jezebel beer you wouldn't believe what Elijah did in church today there's some wildfire in the church got in there and then got Elijah he he prayed that prayer and Fire come down from heaven and you know and people say well you know the the other people dance the prophets of Baal danced and all of that around the altar yes they did but there was no fire but when Elijah prayed there was fire may have says well I don't know what I'm gonna do okay you can't go in this guy's church and I'm his biggest highest pair I'm the king of the land uh he keeps bringing him evangelist in that this Wildfire Runners to the church and and they've done killed all the prophets of Baal we can't do nothing no more prophets told us it was okay to do all the things we're doing and sacrificing all the altars that were sacrificed that we can't do nothing no more without our backslidden preachers to help us what are we going to do you just his nature Jezebel says I'll take care of it because she was the man of the house that's how not how it's supposed to work Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life it's the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time she already had Ahab scared over you know what she did after Elijah come out of the anointing she scared the prophet this this woman was such a dominating woman and such a such a hard Heathen woman that she actually scared a prophet of God who's out from under the anointing yes and he'd be the Bible says he ran for his life now we shouldn't look to the culture for gender roles in the family right look to the word yeah we shouldn't even look at our parents necessarily because some of them misunderstood the message I hate to break that to you but some of us third and fourth generation message Believers fifth generation for some people some of us our parents and grandparents misunderstood and beat their wives around the house and stuff like that we don't need to look to them for how to treat our wives we need to look to the word yeah and the same thing for the wives to the husbands now but there's a reason why God's order is set up the way that it is now brother Branham preaches and I will just briefly touch on this but brother random preaches or he deals with thyatira at the church age and excuse me from Revelation 3 Revelation 2 and he deals with that and he talks about how thyatara means a dominating female and uh he talked about that being the Catholic Church the the church should not dominate over the word maybe I need to say that again the church should not dominate over the word just because I'm the pastor doesn't mean I get to dominate over the word I'm still part of the Bride yeah even the prophet himself was still part of the Bride he does not dominate over the word yet when he spoke the words of God it was the Oracles of God that's God speaking that's Authority right and so now but they this church they suffered also that woman Jezebel and brother Branham said that excuse me tie a Tyra he said that was a woman with an iron disposition he said a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition and and in first Timothy Paul picks that up he said first Timothy 2 12 he said I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp Authority usurp Authority and that means well I'm I'm on a run after this but that means usurp authority over the man but to be in silence that he doesn't qualify that just to church yeah you can you surf authority over a man on Facebook if you don't believe that you just throw it out but I think if you look at the scriptures and just look at it honestly he doesn't say just not in church that's right now again there's some there's some exceptions the woman can teach other women younger women but not the word right teaching them how to keep house how to love their husbands there's very specific things that a woman can teach other younger women and some of those things are derived from the word but you don't handle the word right now look but but to be in silence and so you don't you don't and I don't know of any instance where this is happening I'm not preaching it anybody but you can use serp authority over a man on the internet and you have to be careful with that you don't get to correct preachers on the internet I honestly don't think any of us should be doing that God help me at least I am a pastor God bless you this morning okay we're going to laugh or cry but where does Paul you say well that that's not fair Paul takes it back to God's design he said if Adam was first formed and then Eve he said Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression she was created to be a help meet to him or help his counterpart as we said last week the person in the mirror the mirror image of him that's what that word means so again though you can't feel sorry for Ahab because Jezebel was this way see he wanted to be told what to do because he was backslid he wouldn't have married her in the first place if he had been where he should be with God and we find also that their home I'm almost out of time and we'll have to finish the rest in some other time but it's almost full of self-pity and jealousy you ever been around a home like that a church can be like that that's right right yeah God help us today it's almost full of self-pity and jealousy look at the story of nabos Vineyard and I'm just gonna have to close here today we've got much more but there was a the story was that naboth had a Vineyard close to ahabs and they have not being where he should be he was back said he asked neighbor to do something that was against the word and what that was was to give his land to him but the word says that you're to possess that Land once you had land you weren't supposed to give it up it would go back to your family even if you lost it in your Jubilee it would come back and so naboth is out there doing what God told him to do that's all he's doing that's what God told him to do but because he had a beautiful garden yeah he had fruit he had everything that was gathered around there was wonderful we got to watch Envy we got to be careful of covetousness we've got to be careful of jealousy especially when it comes to the age of social media yeah because we look at other families and what they did and what they have but you don't go by that because you're not looking at the truth right right you're looking at a perception yeah you're looking at a doctored image see you don't see the trials you don't see uh you don't see the struggles all you see is the happy family I can post a picture of myself on vacation and we do sometimes I'm not preaching against sad but I can post a picture and we're all smiling we're all happy you you didn't see what it took to get that picture and the vehicle that broke down y'all have been there how much money you spent on it now you're worried about the about the bills when you get back and all those things I don't think we should borrow money to go on vacation but you've done it and I've done it some of you have anyway some of you have never borrowed money for anything I'm preaching to brother Harvey now and he's not here but you know if you if you're that type of a person that that you want to post everything that looks good and the other people look at that and say well well you know their family is not like mine yes they are they're human yeah yeah they're human they struggle with the same things that you struggle with and I'll tell you you young couples when as you're getting older you know you want better than what your parents had that's right you should want better but don't look too hard on your parents yeah because one day you're going to be your parents huh you look back and say man wish I'd done things more like my dad did maybe not but but you know you you look back and you realize someone said the older you get the wiser your father gets true because because you as you get older you realize that there were things they went through that made them the way that they were and you're going to go through things too and we get in this state of envy and jealousy and struggle yeah yeah we look around to other people's Gardens wish I had that car you realize it's broke down in mortgaged to the hilt looks nice though I'm talking about myself now you know I don't know about y'all but I wish I had what you had with Ben and we do that with churches too oh if my church only had this certain song leader my church only had this certain preacher we only had this certain thing be careful looking at other people's Vineyards there are other peoples for a reason yeah yeah and so naboth was given this Vineyard by God yeah and the king who was supposed to represent Godly judgment comes up to him and says sell it to me I want it because it looked good up next to mine it borders mine I'm not gonna make you raise your hand but you probably had neighbors like that you wish they'd just sell out and there's people around you that would I look good up next to mine well that that boat would look good hit stuff to my truck and and you can take it to anything like that but you begin to want it be careful what you want you might get it so I have come into his house after naboth refused to do this business deal he's heavy the Bible says and displeased and I love the descriptiveness of the scripture here he said because of the word which naboth the jezraelite had spoken to him for he had said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my father's oh God that we could be that way about the word notice what it happened us he laid him and would eat no bread what a baby this is a grown man some of y'all need to grow up I felt like doing this sometimes though I'm just being honest with you you go home after a hard service I'm gonna go home after this service Joel's done that I've seen brother Joe I'll call him on Monday how you doing not so good I know brother Stewart has you get home you think man so he he got home he turned his face to the wall nobody loves me the other preachers won't fellowship with me yeah I'll just take it to myself you know yeah yeah I went to the meeting and they did the same not any house well your king not enough but their Vineyard is so nice promise some of us don't lay down face to all some of us prepare sermons I want to prepare a sermon when you're in that state right you don't want to take your wife out for dinner when you're in that state but he laid down in your soul don't want to do anything and Jezebel immediately knows something's wrong and because she's the man of the house his wife come to him and said why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat is no bread yeah he explained it to him to her said here because I speak in the neighbor author and I said give I said to him give me that Vineyard for money or else if it pleased me I'll give thee another Vineyard for it I I'll do anything you want I just want that yeah and he answered I will not give thee my Vineyard and Jezebel his wife said unto him thus thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel here's some notes arise eat bread let thine heart be merry Jezebel take care of you now you realize if that had been a husband to a wife given a different situation you know how your wife gets sometimes she gets down and and you cheer her up you say I'm not going to tell her how I'm just going to take care of it right I'm not the only one who's ever done that I'm just going to take care of it let her rest but that's not her role he's a grown man he's supposed to be able to take bad days people are supposed to be able to say no oh God what kind of a home are we raising our children in yeah yeah and that's why you get a bunch of backsitting men unable to stand for the word unable to to stand for it I'll tell you this if I get off the word the deacons the trustees and the men of this church have a right and a responsibility to tell me I'm not talking about some little thing you disagree with I'm talking about if I get off the word if I begin to preach my prejudices and my my uh my uh just my my own thoughts to you and and begin to just bring the church down you've got to write in responsibility maybe I can explain it to you yeah but maybe I'm wrong yeah somebody's got to stand up in that situation somebody's got to be a man not just a Yes Man somebody's got to be a man a real friend will Proverbs says blessed are the wounds from a friend and they desire was raised in that gloomy Covetous jealous atmosphere no wonder he went seeking other gods because his father claimed to be a believer but his mother who claimed to be an unbeliever was the only strength in the home he had no home to go back to oh God can you give me five more minutes this morning I'll try to run through I don't want to have to come back to this Lord knows I tried all night to not have to preach this today I sat at my computer last night and tried to come up with another sermon to preach to you this morning because I thought a bunch of them going to be gone and they're gonna they're gonna come after me with pitchforks but I I don't believe you're that kind of a people this morning maybe the visitors who knows you know but hey Evan Jezebel have two sons become Kings and you you'll get confused in the weeds of names because there's two a his eyes two johorams in this in these scriptures one in Israel one in Judah the details are confusing but there's a king in Judah named johoram and I want to show you he said well my family life hasn't been perfect well sometimes God can step in and use you even with someone else's child now hear them hear me this morning you can be a strength in the life of someone else even when it's not your own child many times and actually keep them in the place your grandmothers should take courage today because another individual can step in sometimes and provide the atmosphere that a child needs because now there's a king in Judah remember as I was in Israel but there's a king in Judah named johoram he marries ahab's daughter whose name was a Thalia and she may be the most famous or the most infamous woman after Jezebel in the Bible because she was a very very Wicked Woman and the Bible tells us if you go look it up in Chronicles that her mother and father her or her mother said was her tutor taught her to be that way Jezebel taught her her mother the way the scripted King James puts it her mother was her counselor in Second Kings 8 18 it tells us that this johoram walked in the way of the Kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the Lord now he dies johoram dies and his son becomes king who happens also to be named Isaiah and a messiah dies and so now Italia the daughter of boy I got you confused a Thalia the daughter of Jezebel was now the Queen Mother and her son didn't have any children didn't last long enough so he dies and now she's the queen mother but there's other Royal seed but it says in Second Kings 11 1 when Nathalia the mother of a headaches saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed Royal but jehoshapha the daughter of King Jorah sister of Isaiah took joash the son of ahaziah the son of a vaccine King was the son of a vaccine King who married a daughter of Jezebel by right she should have he should have ended up just like they were like oh God he should have ended up just some of you should have ended up on a bad path because of how you were raised and who your parents were but there's hope look what happens in this situation he took joach now she's his aunt his aunt took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king's Sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bed Chamber from Italia so that he was not slain watch he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years and the value did reign over the land he turned out what kind of a King when he turned out to be second Kings 12 2. joash calls him jehosh did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days were in jail die of the priest instructed him I don't have time to get into the Revival that happened during that time and how when he was seven years old they took him out of the temple I don't have time to get into all that this morning but the point is he was raised in the house of God oh God help us today what can I do for new children what can I what can I'm around church people take every opportunity that you can for your children to be in the house of God because this young man being raised in the house of God made all the difference his mother was a wicked woman but he become a righteous King his grandmother was a Wicked Woman his dad his granddad Wicked people but he become a righteous King oh God why he had a seed of David in it Gloria and if you take a seat of David put him in the house of God raise him in the house of God they become a righteous ruler her own home and their own family God help us today that ties back to the Prodigal Son as well brother Branham told us the prodigal son was raised in church he said this young son's feeling the same way he said mother I don't want no more to do with this family all you do is go to church but he found out later that going to church meant something began to miss the house of God it's one of the very best things you can do for your children is to is to attend church Faithfully you want to destroy your children spiritually take them out of church oh God I'll just skip onto the clothes we'll get to the rest of that maybe some other week that's the great thing about being a pastor you don't have to do what I did this morning and preach too long I've got an hour's worth of notes left I heard something this this week Daryl Ward was the musicians go ahead and come but the Daryl Ward said that he was preaching that we went up to the meetings Friday night Saturday morning and come back up at Galena but Daryl was preaching he said preached a simple sermon to the young people but I grabbed hold of part of it giving his testimony he said I was saved in a in an antique store and he said the spirit of the Lord moved in that place he said and I felt it he said and I knew it was the spirit of the Lord because when I was little his my parents went to church he said and then they backslid and left church but the fact that he was in the house of the Lord and had felt the presence of the Lord when it come time that God began to reach down to him and begin to begin to bring something into his heart and into his mind and God began to begin to reach out and call to him when that time came he was on drugs and alcohol and everything else he said but when that time come he said I felt that presence that I felt when I was a child do you realize how important it is that we have our our children in church and not just in church but in the presence of God in an atmosphere that's nice in an atmosphere that's that's Happy in an atmosphere that's Godly in an atmosphere that's loving in an atmosphere where the presence of God can move you say brother we don't see much right now we've got I don't know 20 25 little children here in the church that little bitty ones I'm speaking by faith 25 there's probably four more it'll come along before long but anyway but but there's over 20. little there'll be children here in the church and I began to think about that what are we going to do how are we going to let's have a place that's Happy let's have a home for him to come back to they may not they may make their mistakes they will if the Lord carries and they get old enough this world is getting so vile how are we going to protect them from the death angel how are we going to keep them put the blood on the doorpost let there be a place where the gifts are still in operation they're oh god let's fight for that there be a place where the people of God still believe in Preachers church still speaking in tongues still believe in working for God still believe in fellowshipping with one another still believe in having Church those things matter children are raised like that hid in the house of God no matter where they get older I was so pleased they're going to have this wedding shower today I was pleased with Nolan and Levi I'll butter you up now so we can preach at you later but I was very pleased that they wanted to go to church when you get old enough Levi and you want to get out on your own you want to go to church that means something hide your children away in the house of God let them be around Christian people yeah how am I going to protect look at the school so look what it is hide them in the house of God every chance you get to put your children in church put them in church I'm gonna be a church let them be in the presence of God and when you're not when you're not in church let your home be a sanctuary you can't replace the church but it could be a place that they can go on to come back to you God help us today Ahab wasn't really a bad fellow he just couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to do in Joshua 24 15 Joshua speaks to the people there and he said it may seem evil and you to serve the Lord if it does choose you this day whom you will serve choose who you're going to serve whether the gods which your father served or on the other side of the flood go back to the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell go back to the denomination go out in the world but that's for me and my house we will serve the Lord oh God give us men like that today give us men that will stand up give us preachers that will stand up as for me in my house we will hide our children in the house of God if I have any influence over my nephews over my nieces over over my grandchildren if the Lord tarries let me hide them in the house of God every opportunity I get let me take them to church it's hard and they're little they're a little bit he was little he become King when he was seven it made a difference in his life but Branham tells us you can't be as good a Christian and not go to church let's hide them in the house of God you bow your heads with me I know it's hard some of you sitting at home sick hearing a sermon about going to church but I know you want to be here I know that's difficult but I believe the Lord he wouldn't let me get away from this for some reason maybe it's for you sitting here this morning you did come but why did you come because you felt like you're on the Chain Gang well we got to go to church today is there something in your heart oh God I I want I want to be in your presence oh Lord I just can't handle not being in the word I may not like the preacher that much I mean I like everybody else in the flesh maybe they have conflict there may be things going on but I just want to be in the word there's a desire inside of me I want to I want to feel your presence come I want you to brood over my life I I want there to be something there why didn't you come today you just well I want to keep my children in church well that's a good thing it's a noble thing but how much more would it be if you could just say oh God I want to be here because you're here I wanted to meet you here today I wanted this I want this to be a part of my life you young couples make it a commitment you young people my own children maybe the oldest of the young people and some of the others sitting here but but those young people Peter and Esther have thought about them Peter Esther keep keep saying the house of God I've hid you in the house of God but you're going to get to an age where I can't do that anymore stay in the house of God you'll make mistakes but go to church you'll you'll you'll fail but read your Bible go to church live for God sometimes the preaching will cut deep sometimes it'll hurt but go to church live for God walk in the house of God this is not my words today it's God God's trying to tell us go to church go to church live for God yeah I mean that's just simple I don't mean everybody I want to hear something I want to hear something deep it is steep hide yourself in the house of God you'll be free of the influence be able to stand against it when you get old when your children get older you get older it's going to get worse church it's not going to get better out there but the bride is getting better don't let Satan try to tell you the bride's getting worse she's not ride is getting better the world's getting worse let's hide ourselves in the presence of God David in the seventh seal he said one thing I belonged after one thing I've desired to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life I don't want to leave your presence oh God don't take me away from your presence why did he cry after he committed that great sin after he murdered and committed adultery but even that it was a man after God's Own Heart he cried out to God he said God don't cast me away from your presence Moses put us this way he said if your presence doesn't go don't let me go we have that kind of affinity today for the presence of the Lord is there something in our lives we can say Lord Lord I want you I desire you I want my children to have you I I want them to know what it's like yesterday they'll make mistakes but I want them to know what a redeemer is like I want them to know what a Christian is it really is [Music] let's bow heads together I you just pray in your own way if you're watching today some of your families that are watching and I know it's hard when you're sick and but this just reach out to God that we believe he's a Healer I believe he's healing you right now as the word Goes Forth but just just try to reach out to him for a moment and say Lord you be my helper today help me to hide in the house of the Lord help me to stay in your presence of God I want your presence I I desire something inside of me I don't want to be cold and vaccin I need you Lord oh God if we approach your throne Lord this morning the close of this service may we recognize Lord who we are Lord what it means to be in your presence yes the tares jump and shout and when the rain comes but so does the wheat if we don't have any rain then we can't ever respond to the word what an awful place to be and sometimes we get dry when we get dry we get thorny we get sticky this old sticky nature comes out in US but oh Lord would you help us to just unravel in your presence today unfold those Thorns oh God may your spirit wash over us Lord I pray the Revival would remain constant in us no matter who's here and who's not here oh God may we worship you in spirit and Truth we're not worshiping someone else we're worshiping you oh God I pray you granted today I pray you'd move Lord help me oh God I realize there's so much growth Lord that's needed in my own life or even myself preaching this morning I under conviction myself oh God would you help me Lord I want to always be in your presence I want to keep my children in your presence I want to make my home a place Lord where your presence can be Lord to be nice to be happy and to be a place where the spirit of God would dwell in that Temple though there was Strife on the outside though there was death on the outside though Italia Ruled the Land with all of her wickedness but inside that Temple there was a little baby growing a little boy that was hid in the house of the Lord oh God may we make our home in the house of the Lord more than just buildings and walls but Lord right in the middle of your word where your presence is where the Shekinah is because that boy was growing the Shekinah was always present he never left there was death outside but he was always there oh God help us today to always behead hid away in the secret of your coming in the house of the Lord and the secret of your Tabernacle I pray you granted today
