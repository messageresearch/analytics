[31:13] moment that that peace comes down on us
[31:15] and we know Lord according to your word
[31:18] Lord we've come in this hour when we've
[31:20] accepted your word and we believed it
[31:22] and our lives have been changed and Lord
[31:25] we are who who you say that we are and
[31:27] what your word says that we are we thank
[31:29] you for that Lord I pray that you bless
[31:31] the people today bless those that are
[31:33] sick and in need Lord those that are
[31:35] watching not pray a special blessing to
[31:37] them tonight and especially those who
[31:39] came let me ask it in Jesus name amen
[31:43] and God bless you turn with me to Joshua
[31:46] chapter 6.
[31:47] Joshua 6 26 and then First Kings 16 34.
[31:52] well you're turning there well brother
[31:54] Timothy you'll be here both services on
[31:56] Sunday so try to be here and bring a
[31:58] friend if you've got one that if you've
[32:00] got a friend that wants to come to
[32:02] church and you're welcome to bring them
[32:04] I'm sure it'll be a blessing we'll have
[32:06] church on Sunday we're going to have
[32:08] church tonight and it's good to have all
[32:10] of our sick folks back with us or most
[32:13] of them anyway it's good to have all of
[32:14] you all with us tonight and then the
[32:17] kids Christmas play at six o'clock on
[32:19] Sunday be a full day on Sunday but it's
[32:22] just the only time we could do it but
[32:23] we're just glad that we were able to do
[32:26] it and that the kids are here we're so
[32:27] glad to have uh young people in the
[32:29] church and children in the church and we
[32:32] want to help them all that we can and
[32:33] let them be a blessing to us as well
[32:35] Joshua 6 26
[32:38] I want to kind of continue uh from where
[32:41] we were on Sunday and just kind of maybe
[32:44] a little bit different subject but the
[32:46] same scriptures that we use on Sunday
[32:49] and Joshua adjured them at that time
[32:51] saying cursed be the man before the Lord
[32:54] that rises up and buildeth this city
[32:57] Jericho he shall lay the foundation
[33:00] thereof in his firstborn and his
[33:02] youngest son shall he set up the gates
[33:04] of it so in other words
[33:06] he'll lose his firstborn and name the
[33:09] foundation after him and in his youngest
[33:12] son shall he set up the gates of it
[33:13] he'll lose his youngest son and name the
[33:16] gates of it after him and then First
[33:19] Kings 16 and 34 we see the exact
[33:21] fulfillment of the word do you believe
[33:23] God keeps his word
[33:25] he said in his days that Heil the
[33:27] bethelite bill Jericho he laid the
[33:30] foundation thereof in a Byram his
[33:32] firstborn and set up the gates thereof
[33:34] in his youngest son Sega according to
[33:37] the word of the Lord which he spake by
[33:40] Joshua the son of none I pray the Lord
[33:43] would add his Blessing to the word he
[33:44] may be seated this this evening
[33:49] whenever you're coming out of something
[33:51] and going into something
[33:54] as walls are destroyed as they fall down
[33:57] we need to be careful and be sure that
[34:00] we don't try to rebuild the walls of the
[34:03] cities that we go through and I think
[34:04] that's true of us personally as well
[34:07] when you go through something in life
[34:09] there's a reason why God allowed certain
[34:12] things in your life to to pass away or
[34:15] to I will say it maybe to be destroyed
[34:18] in your life there's things you look at
[34:20] it and say I wish I could live through
[34:22] that time again I wish things hadn't
[34:24] happened like they did but it was it's
[34:26] gone for a reason
[34:28] there's a reason why you don't do the
[34:30] things that you used to do don't don't
[34:32] look at that time and think well I was
[34:34] happier back then or we were better off
[34:37] back then we don't need to live in the
[34:39] past do we we need to live in the
[34:41] present though right now but the Brandon
[34:43] said man is always ignoring what God is
[34:46] doing right now he's always looking to
[34:47] what God's going to do looking back to
[34:50] what God did but we need to look at what
[34:52] God's doing right now and so uh in
[34:55] looking at this as Joshua come into the
[34:57] land we find there was a parallel to
[34:59] that of the early church that there was
[35:01] a great controversy over the Gentiles
[35:03] and whether or not the Gentiles could
[35:06] come in and whether or not they could be
[35:08] a full-blown Believers without having
[35:11] the Jewish law without being circumcised
[35:14] and eating the right kind of meat and
[35:16] stuff like that and finally they agreed
[35:18] and they saw but because it was
[35:20] manifested before them that God gave
[35:23] them the Holy Ghost and that was the
[35:25] argument that Paul uses he said God give
[35:27] them the holy goes just like he did you
[35:30] and so in doing that then they begin to
[35:32] realize by the bill that they were also
[35:35] they were also Christians and so they
[35:37] said okay there's certain things that
[35:39] they don't need to do but uh but we'll
[35:42] we'll allow them to be who they are and
[35:44] so the gospel of grace began to be
[35:46] preached through the Apostle Paul but
[35:50] now there was this great controversy and
[35:52] there was some who again they can't ever
[35:55] come into the present they've always got
[35:57] to live in the past and try to build
[35:59] back those walls and so what they were
[36:02] doing is they were building back
[36:05] excuse me this this evening but they
[36:07] were building back those walls of the
[36:09] law and so we find that that even those
[36:12] ones who were pushing that they come
[36:14] down to Jerusalem or they come down to
[36:16] Antioch rather where Peter was and Peter
[36:19] uh saw them come from Jerusalem and and
[36:22] Paul says it this way he said when Peter
[36:24] was come to Antioch I would stood him to
[36:26] the faith because he was to be blamed
[36:29] right what was Peter doing he was going
[36:31] with those who were rebuilding those
[36:33] Jewish walls yeah and it's not time to
[36:36] rebuild the walls it's time to move on
[36:39] into the land
[36:40] how many believe that tonight
[36:42] so Peter was coming and he was he
[36:44] withstood him to the face he said
[36:46] because certain before certain came from
[36:48] James he did eat with the Gentiles but
[36:50] when they were come he withdrew and
[36:52] separated himself fearing them which
[36:54] were of the circumcision
[36:57] assembled likewise with him that word
[36:59] dissembled you need to remember that
[37:01] because anytime someone dissembles from
[37:03] the church or separates themselves from
[37:06] the from the Believers from the group of
[37:07] Believers you better make sure you have
[37:09] a valid reason to do that
[37:11] and that you're not just splitting hairs
[37:13] over some kind of little petty thing
[37:16] which is what they were doing and and so
[37:19] he said it's so much that Barnabas also
[37:21] was carried away with their
[37:22] dissimulation he said but when I saw
[37:25] that they walked not uprightly according
[37:27] to the truth of the Gospel I said unto
[37:29] Peter before them all if thou being a
[37:32] Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles
[37:34] and not as to the Jews why compel us
[37:36] thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews
[37:39] we who are Jews by nature and not
[37:42] Sinners of the Gentiles knowing that a
[37:44] man is not justified by The Works of the
[37:46] law aren't you glad of that today but by
[37:49] the faith of Jesus Christ even we have
[37:51] believed in Jesus Christ that we might
[37:53] be justified by the Faith of Christ and
[37:56] not by The Works of the law for by The
[37:57] Works of the law shall no flesh be
[38:00] justified but if while we seek to be
[38:02] justified by Christ we ourselves also
[38:05] are found Sinners is therefore Christ
[38:07] the minister of sin God forbid he said
[38:09] for if I build again the things which I
[38:13] destroyed I make myself a transgressor
[38:16] listen to me Church don't go back
[38:20] to yesterday don't go back to Jericho
[38:23] could you imagine Rahab as she was
[38:25] coming out of Jericho she's coming out
[38:28] of that City and the walls fell down
[38:30] around her
[38:31] she had no desire to go back because the
[38:34] only thing there was accusations the
[38:36] only thing there was her old life the
[38:39] only thing there was the men who could
[38:41] remember but they'd all been destroyed
[38:43] she had no desire to go back but what
[38:45] did she do she went with the with her
[38:48] husband oh but she went into the land
[38:50] and she actually built helped build a
[38:52] city Bethlehem yeah
[38:54] she went in and began digging ditches in
[38:57] Bethlehem and and helping set up a house
[38:59] and and made a permanent home there
[39:02] because that's where God wanted her to
[39:04] be listen God wants you to be where
[39:06] you're at tonight he if he wanted you to
[39:08] be where you were he'd have left you
[39:10] there come on
[39:11] come on are you with me now so we need
[39:13] to we need to go on into the land go on
[39:16] into the promise
[39:18] well I remember how things were back in
[39:20] the Pentecostal Church go on in
[39:22] are you with me now
[39:24] I remember how things were 50 years ago
[39:26] in the message it may have been
[39:28] wonderful but you need to go on in
[39:30] those things were destroyed for a reason
[39:35] and if I build again the things which I
[39:37] destroyed I make myself a transgressor
[39:40] so the principle is what God has
[39:43] destroyed was destroyed for a reason
[39:45] I know change is hard
[39:48] if you've ever moved you know change is
[39:49] hard
[39:50] if you've ever gotten married you know
[39:53] change is hard
[39:54] if you've ever had kids you know change
[39:56] is hard especially if you have three or
[39:59] four of them
[40:00] change is hard
[40:02] and and you know but it's absolutely
[40:04] necessary to survival
[40:07] right if people say well I'm not going
[40:09] to change you just wouldn't survive
[40:10] civilization would fall apart because we
[40:14] must have changed to have survival
[40:17] and brother Branham reads the story um
[40:20] in the newspaper about animals and birds
[40:23] he tells it many times in the message
[40:25] but he said that in India they had walls
[40:27] around the fields instead of fences like
[40:29] we do here and he tells this story about
[40:31] how that the animals and the birds at a
[40:34] certain day they begin to move into the
[40:35] middle of the field they left their
[40:37] their little nooks and crannies in the
[40:39] wall or where they were standing in the
[40:40] shade of the wall and they moved into
[40:42] the middle of the field and congregated
[40:43] together and he said the reason was
[40:46] because there was an earthquake coming
[40:47] but nobody forecasted it they couldn't
[40:50] read the paper and see that it was
[40:51] coming the human beings didn't know that
[40:53] it was coming but the animals had a
[40:55] sense about that there was a god-given
[40:58] sense about them but Brandon said it was
[41:00] the same thing that took them into the
[41:01] ark and so they begin to move into the
[41:04] middle away from those walls and brother
[41:07] Brown said this he said now let me say
[41:09] something brother he said there is
[41:11] something fixing to happen and all these
[41:14] big old ecclesiastical walls are going
[41:16] to collapse and go right back over
[41:19] Yonder and agree
[41:21] now notice the walls are going to fall
[41:23] down and again that's what when we come
[41:25] into the land the opening of the word
[41:26] the walls fall down but now what they're
[41:29] going to do is come back and agree
[41:30] together because they're going to do it
[41:33] as certain as I'm standing here remember
[41:34] what happened when Joshua come in the
[41:36] land all them Kings never could get
[41:38] along till Joshua came and when Joshua
[41:41] came into the land all the kings began
[41:43] to come against him they began to work
[41:45] together against Joshua and that's
[41:48] exactly what happened when we see the
[41:49] opening of the word we see and then
[41:51] immediately you begin to see an
[41:53] ecumenical move that begins to come
[41:55] together and let me tell you this today
[41:56] they're all the same
[41:59] right whether it's the Harlot in
[42:01] Revelation 17 or her daughters they're
[42:03] all the same
[42:05] and there's good people in there I may
[42:07] know that tonight but stay away from
[42:10] them walls
[42:12] right because they're all going back
[42:14] over Yonder and agree he said because
[42:15] they're going to do it as certain as I'm
[42:17] standing here
[42:18] he said there is an image to that Beast
[42:20] just as certain as I'm standing here and
[42:22] this nation took it according to the
[42:25] word of the Lord
[42:26] said listen
[42:27] oh I love this he said when you feel
[42:30] that little funny feeling
[42:32] you get away from them walls
[42:35] I don't know about you but I I grew up
[42:38] around denominational people and going
[42:41] to churches and and and I I we have a
[42:44] lot of experience going from church to
[42:46] church and my dad was always trying to
[42:48] reach somebody
[42:49] but they begin to preach on the Trinity
[42:51] and you get a little funny feeling
[42:54] they begin to talk about joining church
[42:56] and and putting your name on a book and
[42:58] and what it takes to be saved in any
[43:01] that without certain denomination you
[43:03] eat a little funny feeling
[43:05] while you you've been brought out into
[43:06] something else
[43:08] you've been brought out into something
[43:09] new something fresh a reality of the
[43:12] Gospel we don't want to go back
[43:14] we are not of those who go back into
[43:16] those things so he said when you get
[43:18] that little funny feeling you get away
[43:20] from them walls yeah
[43:23] get away he said you'll die in there
[43:27] don't do it
[43:31] and we know he's talking about
[43:33] denominationalism but we can apply that
[43:35] to anything God has destroyed
[43:37] right any walls that have come down
[43:40] he said for the will come down
[43:43] he said get away from all this stuff
[43:45] flee to safety as quick as you can ask
[43:49] God for mercy
[43:51] I love the way he takes this he said
[43:54] don't just take somewhere my mother
[43:55] mother was Methodist so I suppose I'll
[43:58] be my papa was Baptist I'll be don't you
[44:00] do that don't you take any chance
[44:03] yeah and I'll say to you A Word of Life
[44:06] Tabernacle if this would be the last
[44:07] sermon that I would ever preach to you
[44:09] don't take any chances stay away from
[44:12] them walls we have a message for a
[44:14] reason
[44:15] I don't say well my papa was Baptist so
[44:18] I go to Word of Life Tabernacle it's not
[44:19] enough
[44:21] he said don't take any chance
[44:23] he said I don't care how simple and
[44:24] humble it seems It's the word of the
[44:27] Lord you flee to Jesus Christ just as
[44:29] quick as you can and stay there until
[44:31] God fills you with this Holy Spirit for
[44:33] the hour is going to come when you're
[44:35] going to hunt for it and it won't be
[44:37] there
[44:38] she'll be sure to do it he said
[44:40] now look
[44:42] so those walls are going to fall you
[44:43] need to get away from them
[44:45] why would we go back to a dead system
[44:48] that's been defeated and proven to be
[44:51] dead
[44:52] I've noticed that in the message it
[44:54] seems to only be attractive to those who
[44:56] are not enslaved by it
[44:58] right that they they grew up in the
[44:59] message and they so they have this view
[45:01] of denominationalism that is some kind
[45:03] of freedom
[45:05] and it's actually a bondage
[45:08] and and you'll find it's a bondage
[45:10] because you watch even today even more
[45:13] than in brother random's time there's
[45:14] really no difference in the churches
[45:16] they're all the same you can go in a
[45:18] Baptist Church we were in a Baptist
[45:20] Church the other night at a at a Gaither
[45:22] concert you'd go in that Baptist Church
[45:24] or a charismatic church there's no
[45:26] difference in their worship right no
[45:28] difference in the preaching it's all
[45:30] modernized everything's the same
[45:33] right you're going to go and you're
[45:34] going to hear there may be little
[45:36] doctrinal things and things that but but
[45:37] for the most part they're all the same
[45:40] and they teach the same thing and and
[45:43] they preach the same thing and they
[45:44] hatch their preacher out of the cemetery
[45:47] right to come and preach to them
[45:49] why would we go back to that
[45:52] why would we take why would we take that
[45:54] when we have when we have a full open
[45:57] book a fullness of the word why do we
[46:00] take a partial word when we have a full
[46:02] word
[46:03] why would we take it why would we take a
[46:06] dead system when we have a living Christ
[46:09] right but it's only attracted to people
[46:11] that and I think sometimes as message
[46:13] I'm a have several generations of
[46:16] message believer but I've seen those
[46:17] things and I think sometimes we we just
[46:20] we look at it we begin to think well you
[46:22] know it's not too bad I I think we'd
[46:25] probably be better off out there no you
[46:27] wouldn't be
[46:28] if you're a real believer there's
[46:29] something in your heart that cries out
[46:31] for Freedom it cries out to be in the in
[46:34] the Church of the firstborn see Paul
[46:37] tells us so we're not we've not come to
[46:38] the law how many believe that tonight
[46:40] we've not come to a mouth that can't be
[46:43] touched or we've read it recently but
[46:45] I'll read it here again he said you were
[46:46] coming to Mount Zion unto the city of
[46:49] the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to
[46:51] an innumerable company of angels to to
[46:54] the general assembly and Church of the
[46:55] firstborn which are written in heaven
[46:57] and to God the judge of all to the
[46:59] spirits of just men made perfect to
[47:02] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[47:04] to the blood of sprinkling to speak of
[47:06] better things than that of Abel why go
[47:07] back to those walls when you've come to
[47:09] this
[47:10] so he's telling them he said don't go
[47:12] back to Mount Sinai there's nothing
[47:14] there but death
[47:16] don't rebuild those walls whether
[47:19] whether you're Peter or anybody else
[47:21] don't go back and build those walls stay
[47:23] away from it
[47:25] we don't want to go back to that old
[47:27] mountain
[47:28] now I just I'm laying the background
[47:31] here and then we'll get to what I want
[47:32] to say now we don't want to go back to
[47:34] that old mountain but random said this
[47:36] he said have you noticed every three
[47:38] years after a great meeting what takes
[47:39] place a denomination
[47:42] he said this is 20 years and no
[47:43] denomination
[47:45] dear dying lamb man never do that if I
[47:49] go in this generation May the people who
[47:50] believe this message never stand still
[47:52] for a denomination
[47:55] he said you'll die right in your track
[47:57] remember that the very hour that you
[48:01] mentioned denomination among you I don't
[48:03] care how sincere you are
[48:06] listen I don't care how sincere you are
[48:08] you take Man For Your Leader instead of
[48:11] the Holy Spirit to confirm this word
[48:13] that's the hour you die and it doesn't
[48:16] matter who the man is
[48:19] the hour you take me for your leader
[48:21] instead of the Holy Ghost that's the
[48:23] hour you die the hour you take brother
[48:25] Joel for your leader instead of the Holy
[48:27] Ghost that's the hour you die or any of
[48:29] these other brothers that's the very
[48:31] hour you die it's hour you take any man
[48:33] right
[48:35] are you with me now
[48:37] the genuine seed cannot
[48:40] oh I love that oh that gives me Comfort
[48:43] but the Stuart I know that I'm that's
[48:45] who I am
[48:46] genuine seed cannot now again not that
[48:49] they not only will not cannot
[48:52] because there's nothing left after the
[48:54] seed
[48:55] it's the same thing was back at the
[48:57] beginning it's the bride that fell into
[48:59] the ground to bring forth the corn of
[49:00] wheat again oh my so there's a group of
[49:03] people who can't fall
[49:04] are you with me now there's nothing in
[49:06] them to want to go back
[49:08] and rebuild those walls
[49:10] and yet
[49:12] in our flesh we we must guard against
[49:14] this because and this is where Peter we
[49:17] know Peter was a Godly Man
[49:20] and he was a man who had the Holy Ghost
[49:22] we know he had the Holy Ghost
[49:25] right he's the one who got up and
[49:26] preached the sermon
[49:28] and yet Paul had to withstand him to the
[49:30] to his face
[49:32] because he was trying to rebuild
[49:33] something that happened 40 years ago
[49:36] the way they worshiped when he was a kid
[49:39] huh
[49:40] and he said don't do that we've come
[49:42] into something else
[49:44] and so there's some things and I've
[49:46] talked about some of these things before
[49:47] but just bear with me tonight because
[49:49] there's some things we have to do to
[49:51] maintain our freedom and we have how
[49:54] many how many are glad for freedom
[49:56] you don't have any District presbyter
[49:58] telling the pastor what to preach you
[50:00] don't have any you don't have any uh any
[50:03] uh people out here that are a deacon
[50:05] board that's telling the pastor what to
[50:06] preach a pastor gets to hear from God
[50:08] and preach it directly to you
[50:10] and then not only that but you're not
[50:13] under bondage you don't have somebody
[50:14] sitting there constantly putting their
[50:16] thumb on you and telling you who you
[50:18] should marry and what you I hope you're
[50:20] not
[50:21] right and what you should do I give you
[50:23] advice but you're not under bondage
[50:25] you're only bound to the word
[50:28] right that's what you're bound to
[50:30] and if you find yourself back inside
[50:33] those walls again you need to get out of
[50:35] that
[50:38] so now
[50:40] we've got to maintain our freedom how do
[50:42] we do that well first as I begin to
[50:44] think about these things I I thought we
[50:46] must resist the temptation to protect
[50:48] what we have
[50:50] by human effort
[50:52] God gave it to us
[50:55] but we've got to resist the temptation
[50:57] to protect it by human effort
[51:00] and hael the one who built the wall of
[51:03] Jericho
[51:04] he probably thought that he was doing a
[51:07] great thing protecting the citizens of
[51:09] Jericho from foreign Invaders
[51:12] he probably assumed that he was doing
[51:14] the will of the Lord
[51:16] because he was an Israelite and the
[51:18] Israelites had taken Jericho he said all
[51:20] these years Jericho hadn't had walls we
[51:23] need to rebuild the walls
[51:25] but he paid the price with his children
[51:28] and brother Branham
[51:30] when he was speaking to the Pentecostals
[51:32] because they were looking back at what
[51:35] had happened in 1906
[51:38] and he's speaking to the Full Gospel
[51:39] businessman he tells him he preaches a
[51:42] message called turning northward and
[51:43] I've quoted from it extensively recently
[51:46] but he said just Divine Healing and
[51:48] speaking in tongues he said well that's
[51:50] just a few grapes that was brought back
[51:52] from across the land he said the land is
[51:55] ours It All Belongs To Us someone say it
[51:58] all belongs to us
[52:00] all of it belongs to us amen don't now
[52:03] watch where he takes this now he said
[52:05] don't be afraid that the other fellow is
[52:07] going to beat you over there
[52:10] and that's a lot of times why we start
[52:12] trying to protect what we have
[52:14] because we're afraid the other fellow is
[52:16] going to beat us over there
[52:18] he said just join up with him and go on
[52:21] over
[52:22] yeah
[52:24] yeah you know if you reject light just
[52:25] because another church brought it you
[52:28] become a denominational wall yeah
[52:30] you've walled yourself in if it's truth
[52:33] it's truth if it's not truth it's not
[52:34] truth if it's truth it's truth if the
[52:36] Catholic priest preaches it if it's not
[52:39] truth it's not true even if even if I
[52:41] preach it
[52:43] are you with me now
[52:44] if it's not if it's not truth it doesn't
[52:47] matter who who preaches it if it's wrong
[52:49] it's wrong
[52:50] that's right no matter how many years of
[52:52] experience they have or how much I love
[52:54] them if it's not true it's just not true
[52:58] are you with me now
[53:00] and he said he said don't be afraid the
[53:02] other fellow is going to beat you over
[53:03] there just join up with him and going
[53:05] over that's the way to do it and we've
[53:07] been on this mountain for 40 years let's
[53:09] get off of it and go towards the
[53:11] Promised Land
[53:13] and again now probably being a little
[53:16] introspective but it's a great
[53:17] temptation to pastors especially as you
[53:20] get some years on you because we built
[53:23] it we feel like with our Blood Sweat and
[53:25] Tears yeah
[53:27] right because it takes something out of
[53:28] you
[53:29] and I'm not trying to complain but every
[53:31] year that you Pastor take something out
[53:33] of you
[53:34] and you give yourself to the people it
[53:36] ought to be that way
[53:37] right we're serving you every year that
[53:39] you preach if you minister to the people
[53:42] who take something out of you
[53:44] right you're giving your life for the
[53:46] people
[53:47] so many times then we kind of feel like
[53:49] we have ownership of it yeah
[53:51] and if we don't watch it we'll get to
[53:53] where we don't want anybody to tear it
[53:55] down
[53:55] so but we don't realize we're not the
[53:58] Builder God is
[54:00] we plant the seed yeah we scatter the
[54:04] light but God has to protect it it
[54:07] doesn't do the seed one bit of good for
[54:09] us to plant it and then go back and dig
[54:10] it up every day in fact if we do that
[54:13] it'll never grow
[54:15] but we say well I built it with my my
[54:17] blood literally I built it with my sweat
[54:20] I built it by working in Pirates
[54:22] tirelessly working for the people and
[54:25] but but that's we're just stewards of
[54:28] God and listen he told the disciples he
[54:30] said when you've done all that you've
[54:32] been asked to do come on he said
[54:34] remember you're just unprofitable
[54:35] servants
[54:36] you did what you were asked to do
[54:39] what you were called to do
[54:41] so we are not the ultimate Builders
[54:43] First Corinthians 3 and 6 that I've
[54:45] planted Apollos watered but God gave the
[54:47] increase and remember this in your own
[54:49] lives as well because many times we want
[54:52] to protect our families like that we
[54:54] want to build up walls we're not going
[54:56] I'm not going to lie I'm not going to
[54:57] make the mistakes my father did and
[54:59] that's a good thing we want to break
[55:01] that cycle
[55:02] right but don't build up walls where you
[55:05] can't move on in the word
[55:07] because if we're not careful while my
[55:08] dad discipline me in a certain way I'm
[55:10] not going to discipline my kids at all
[55:12] you better be careful
[55:13] right my father did this this way and so
[55:16] I'm going to take the opposite side no
[55:18] you need to take what the word says
[55:21] right he said I've planted Apollos
[55:23] watered but God gave the increase
[55:26] so that neither is he that planteth
[55:28] anything neither he that wadereth but
[55:30] God that giveth the increase he said now
[55:33] he that planet that he that watereth her
[55:35] one
[55:36] are you with me now
[55:38] most of you have been in the message or
[55:40] were in the message before I come around
[55:43] I'm watering
[55:45] are you with me now
[55:47] some of you all a few I planted
[55:50] right but most I'm watering
[55:53] but whether I'm watering or planning
[55:55] we're one
[55:57] right I'm working for the same purpose
[55:59] as the one that planted the seed
[56:02] are you with me now maybe you got saved
[56:04] at Youth Camp maybe you got saved if
[56:05] maybe you got uh filled with the Holy
[56:07] Ghost in another church
[56:09] but that don't mean anything to me I'm
[56:11] just watering what somebody else planted
[56:13] it's not my plant it's not my it's not
[56:16] my acreage
[56:18] are you with me now our families are the
[56:20] same we're stewards of something that
[56:23] God gave us
[56:25] aren't you glad to be a steward don't
[56:27] you want to be a good Steward today I
[56:29] want to be a good Steward of what God
[56:30] gave me I want to love them I want to
[56:32] protect them but Lord help me not to
[56:33] wall it off and make it my own become a
[56:36] lord over God's heritage
[56:39] look because it belongs to God and job
[56:42] said it this way he said the Lord gives
[56:44] the Lord takes away blessed be the name
[56:46] of the Lord yes he allowed you to have
[56:49] him in the first place he he can take
[56:51] care of them
[56:52] yeah
[56:54] watch
[56:56] he said we are laborers together with
[56:58] God
[56:59] he said
[57:01] he said you were laborers we are
[57:03] laborers together with God ye are God's
[57:05] husbandry that means you're God's field
[57:07] the farm belongs to God
[57:10] and then he changes his metaphors he
[57:12] said you are God's Building
[57:15] you are God's husband or he's using the
[57:17] metaphor of a field and plants now he
[57:18] says you're God's Building he says
[57:20] according to the grace of God which is
[57:22] given unto me as a wise master builder
[57:25] he said I have laid the foundation and
[57:27] another bill that thereon but let every
[57:29] man take heed how he builds a therapon
[57:32] other Foundation can no man lay then
[57:34] that enslaved which is Jesus Christ
[57:37] he said now if any man build upon this
[57:39] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[57:41] would hey stubble Every Man's work shall
[57:44] be made manifest
[57:46] for the day shall declare it because it
[57:48] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[57:50] shall try every man's work of what sort
[57:52] it is
[57:53] I don't get to try every man's work
[57:56] I get to build yeah
[57:58] are you with me now and I got to be
[57:59] careful what I build with but it's not
[58:01] up to me to try every man's work
[58:04] are you with me now we don't get to try
[58:06] every other family's work we don't get
[58:09] to try every other Church's work
[58:11] right it's up to us to build let's make
[58:14] sure we're building with gold silver
[58:16] precious stones
[58:18] Others May build with wood hay and
[58:20] stubble but let's make sure what we're
[58:21] doing
[58:23] are you with me because every man's work
[58:25] will be made manifest one day yes the
[58:28] day shall declare it
[58:30] right if it don't last in the fire
[58:32] it'll be revealed by fire
[58:35] so I would say this don't waste your
[58:37] time trying to protect your legacy your
[58:39] family name your ministry
[58:42] right God planted it
[58:44] God's able to take care of it
[58:47] the Bible tells us promotion cometh
[58:49] neither from the East nor from the West
[58:51] nor from the south nor from the pastor
[58:55] nor from another pastor
[58:57] are you with me now nor from the people
[58:59] promotion doesn't come from that ah you
[59:02] you all voted me in as a pastor but you
[59:04] didn't call me to preach
[59:06] right you didn't make me a preacher we
[59:09] ordained brother Joel the other day but
[59:10] we didn't make him a preacher
[59:12] right are you with me now promotion
[59:15] don't come from the East to the west or
[59:16] the South but God is the judge he put us
[59:19] down one and set us up another
[59:22] so be careful be careful and to resist
[59:25] the temptation to protect what we have
[59:27] by human effort
[59:28] now let's let's move on I would say the
[59:32] second thing is say we have to say no or
[59:34] learn to say no
[59:36] to leaders and that's a dangerous thing
[59:38] for for a person in a leadership
[59:40] position to say by the way I get nervous
[59:43] even thinking about it
[59:44] because there are some people who only
[59:47] say no
[59:49] that class of person exists well you
[59:51] know in a church there's always going to
[59:52] be somebody votes no on everything
[59:55] and that's the truth don't worry I'm not
[59:56] talking about you unless you're that
[59:58] person
[1:00:00] right but there's always going to be
[1:00:01] that person
[1:00:03] just vote Stone no matter what you do
[1:00:04] and you just know they're just a it's
[1:00:06] just their they have a contrarian kind
[1:00:08] of attitude but I I don't think we
[1:00:10] should be troublemakers but if it's
[1:00:12] wrong it's wrong
[1:00:14] so we need to learn to say no to leaders
[1:00:16] who place themselves above the word
[1:00:20] it doesn't mean we should be
[1:00:21] troublemakers make sure it's the word
[1:00:23] we're standing for and not
[1:00:25] not some red herring
[1:00:28] not some not not some little thing that
[1:00:31] they run off on a tangent somewhere make
[1:00:32] sure it's the word but if it's the word
[1:00:34] stay with it above every leader
[1:00:37] are you with me now
[1:00:40] you know Heil probably thought that he
[1:00:43] was following the great king ahab's
[1:00:45] instructions so he would be okay Ahab
[1:00:49] was sitting there he was the king of
[1:00:52] Israel he was anointed king of Israel
[1:00:55] and so he said I'm following ahab's
[1:00:57] instructions
[1:00:58] I'll be okay but he should have said no
[1:01:01] he'd have saved his children
[1:01:04] that's why you know Paul withstood Peter
[1:01:07] to the face these things are serious
[1:01:08] even among Christians we we don't want
[1:01:11] to go back
[1:01:12] we want to go forward we want to move on
[1:01:14] to the opening of the word
[1:01:16] John wrote to the Ephesian church and
[1:01:18] and and he said this and to the Ephesian
[1:01:20] Church age he said I know that works and
[1:01:22] I labor my patience and how how can it's
[1:01:25] not better than what you're evil now has
[1:01:27] tried them which say they are Apostles
[1:01:29] and are not has found them Liars
[1:01:33] it's pretty strong language isn't it
[1:01:35] he said he found them to be Liars
[1:01:38] and brother Brandon says this he said
[1:01:39] how'd they know that how did they know
[1:01:41] they were Liars
[1:01:42] they wasn't quoting with the word now he
[1:01:46] doesn't say they wasn't quoting the word
[1:01:47] but they wasn't quoting with the word
[1:01:51] right so what they were saying didn't
[1:01:52] match the word
[1:01:54] you couldn't find it in the scripture
[1:01:56] you couldn't find it and what Paul said
[1:01:58] so he said that early church he said
[1:02:01] you've tried them who would call
[1:02:02] themselves Apostles in other words the
[1:02:04] Apostle is the one who lays the
[1:02:07] foundation these ones who say they're
[1:02:08] laying a foundation but it's not a
[1:02:10] foundation of the word
[1:02:12] he said you found them to be Liars
[1:02:15] and he said how did you know that they
[1:02:16] wasn't quoting with the word he said now
[1:02:18] if a man says that this Bible says that
[1:02:21] in Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:02:23] yesterday yesterday today and forever
[1:02:26] he said the man said oh the days of
[1:02:28] Miracles has passed then that man's a
[1:02:31] liar
[1:02:34] again that's pretty strong language
[1:02:35] isn't it
[1:02:36] but it's the truth
[1:02:38] sometimes we got to stand up for things
[1:02:41] I don't like controversy I'll be the
[1:02:44] last one to be dragged into a
[1:02:45] controversy but if a man says the days
[1:02:48] of Miracles are passed that man's a liar
[1:02:52] if the Bible said he gives another
[1:02:53] example if the Bible said repent be
[1:02:55] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:02:58] sins and every place now watch where he
[1:03:00] takes this every place in the Bible says
[1:03:02] the same thing
[1:03:04] so now here's a principle that we can
[1:03:05] use if there's a word Doctrine every
[1:03:08] place in the Bible is going to say the
[1:03:09] same thing
[1:03:10] right and that's why we know we can
[1:03:12] stand on it
[1:03:14] we've all through the Bible we can find
[1:03:16] Jesus name baptism baptism in the name
[1:03:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:21] right and so we look at that and someone
[1:03:23] comes baptizing differently we know he's
[1:03:25] not saying what a prophet said and he's
[1:03:28] not saying what the Bible says
[1:03:30] because once it exists in the scripture
[1:03:33] you don't get to just cut it out
[1:03:36] are you with me now
[1:03:38] and that's why we've got to be careful
[1:03:40] about what we try to
[1:03:42] reason in our minds about the message of
[1:03:45] the hour about the Scriptures it stands
[1:03:47] on its own right
[1:03:48] right if it's all through the scriptures
[1:03:50] I don't get to just ignore it
[1:03:52] I gotta come to it just like you do I
[1:03:55] got to conform to it
[1:03:57] so now he says that every place in the
[1:03:59] Bible says the same thing and everybody
[1:04:01] that was Earth are you still with me
[1:04:03] tonight I've got a few more minutes and
[1:04:05] you don't know how many a few is I don't
[1:04:07] either I'll just
[1:04:12] so everybody that was ever baptized in
[1:04:14] the Bible I've missed you brother Joel I
[1:04:17] tell you what
[1:04:18] every there was ever baptized in the
[1:04:20] Bible time was baptized in the name of
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ and he commissions them to
[1:04:24] be baptized sprinkled or something else
[1:04:26] like that he said that man is a liar
[1:04:29] he's found out to be a false prophet
[1:04:32] and it's not because you hate the man
[1:04:34] but he's not telling the truth right
[1:04:36] come
[1:04:37] are you with me now so the angel
[1:04:40] commends that that church age he tells
[1:04:43] them he said tell the Ephesian Church
[1:04:45] age you found them who called themselves
[1:04:47] Apostles and they were not and you said
[1:04:50] you're a liar
[1:04:52] now we could take that to anything uh
[1:04:54] one of the things that we're taking her
[1:04:56] to today and and again we've tried to uh
[1:05:00] tried to show people in a kind way but
[1:05:03] but these things there's some things
[1:05:04] when somebody goes in tries to take
[1:05:06] ministers out of the church
[1:05:08] deny Ephesians 4 11 and all the other
[1:05:11] scriptures that speak of pastors and
[1:05:13] apostles and Prophets and evangelists
[1:05:15] and teachers
[1:05:16] what are we supposed to tell them
[1:05:20] are you with me now
[1:05:22] if they're going to take out something
[1:05:23] that's all through the scriptures and
[1:05:25] all through the message
[1:05:29] well I won't say it but that's what he
[1:05:31] said
[1:05:33] are you with me now
[1:05:34] those who've called themselves Apostles
[1:05:37] yeah
[1:05:38] but you've tried them and they've found
[1:05:39] that they're not Apostles because they
[1:05:42] don't stay with the word
[1:05:44] I've got personal experience with this I
[1:05:47] remember
[1:05:48] when I was a teenager and my own father
[1:05:51] and and brother Brandon writes about
[1:05:53] this in the church age book and this
[1:05:54] helped me so much
[1:05:56] because my own father was saying things
[1:05:58] about the message it just weren't true
[1:06:00] and as I began to dig into the message
[1:06:02] for myself I realized he's not staying
[1:06:04] with the word and my first thought was
[1:06:06] being young and naive I thought well I'm
[1:06:08] going to go tell him and he's going to
[1:06:09] change what he's teaching because he
[1:06:12] just don't know
[1:06:13] so this 14 year old boy goes and tries
[1:06:16] to tell his dad
[1:06:18] and you know how that goes
[1:06:20] go knock your head against the wall you
[1:06:22] know
[1:06:23] you're a 14 year old boy and so I was
[1:06:25] naive in that way but I had to stay with
[1:06:28] the word
[1:06:30] it's not what brother Brandon said
[1:06:32] brother Brandon brother Brandon said
[1:06:34] certain things but he didn't say what
[1:06:36] you're saying and you you've all
[1:06:38] experienced times like that you had to
[1:06:39] make a stand
[1:06:41] huh and this this passage really helped
[1:06:44] me so I'm going to read it to you
[1:06:45] he said he reads the scripture that I
[1:06:48] found them that say they are Apostles
[1:06:49] and are not has found them Liars he said
[1:06:51] my that is a blunt statement the US
[1:06:54] tried them who called themselves
[1:06:55] Apostles isn't that presumptuous what
[1:06:58] right has the people to try those who
[1:06:59] call themselves apostles
[1:07:01] now look some people would say none
[1:07:04] well you're not a pastor but it wasn't
[1:07:06] the pastors
[1:07:08] going out and calling these Apostles
[1:07:10] Liars
[1:07:11] it was the church
[1:07:14] yeah right maybe including some pastors
[1:07:16] but it was the church he said how do
[1:07:18] they try them
[1:07:20] he said oh I love this here it is in
[1:07:21] Galatians 1 8 but though we or an angel
[1:07:24] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:07:27] you than that which we have already
[1:07:28] preached unto you let him be accursed he
[1:07:31] said it was the apostles who brought the
[1:07:33] original word to the people that
[1:07:36] original word could not change not even
[1:07:38] a DOT or a dash of it that's what our
[1:07:40] soul hangs on do you believe that
[1:07:42] tonight can you see that our soul hangs
[1:07:45] on that
[1:07:46] that's why our women I wear long hair
[1:07:49] they don't do it because a preacher said
[1:07:51] do it right
[1:07:52] not even because a prophet said do it
[1:07:54] but it was in the word and a word
[1:07:57] Prophet called us back to the word
[1:08:00] that's why our women don't cut their
[1:08:01] hair because we have a revelation that
[1:08:04] God's word is true and the Bible says
[1:08:07] that a woman's hair was given to her for
[1:08:09] her covering and so and for her not to
[1:08:11] even pray without her covering I don't
[1:08:14] know why I'm going into that but maybe
[1:08:15] you question that and sometimes you
[1:08:17] wonder why why do I have to deal with
[1:08:19] that why why am I having to wear my long
[1:08:21] hair like it is and and why why do I
[1:08:24] leave it alone when others can go and
[1:08:26] cut it off like they do and beautify it
[1:08:28] in whatever way that they want to
[1:08:29] because it was given to to the woman for
[1:08:32] a covenant and I don't have time to go
[1:08:33] into all of that but it was what the
[1:08:35] word says it's the way God wants it we
[1:08:39] don't get to just change it
[1:08:41] and if you can change one thing you can
[1:08:43] change another
[1:08:44] if you can change it that about hair you
[1:08:46] can change what he said about
[1:08:47] homosexuals yeah
[1:08:50] yeah right and that's what the modern
[1:08:51] church is fighting with today
[1:08:53] because they're standing for Romans 1
[1:08:55] but not for First Corinthians 11.
[1:08:58] right they can't they can't do it but we
[1:09:00] must stand for all the word
[1:09:03] we want to stand for everything that was
[1:09:05] written
[1:09:06] and so they fight that battle today but
[1:09:10] we if we're going to take one word out
[1:09:12] we might as well throw the whole thing
[1:09:13] away
[1:09:14] because it's only as good as its weakest
[1:09:18] link but the Brandon said it was a chain
[1:09:20] the word is a chain we're hanging over
[1:09:21] hell with it and I'm back to this quote
[1:09:24] he said even if I he said he said Paul
[1:09:27] knew it was God who had spoken to him so
[1:09:29] he said even if I come
[1:09:32] even if I come and try to give a second
[1:09:35] revelation
[1:09:36] try to make one little change in what I
[1:09:39] gave originally let me be accursed
[1:09:43] you see Paul knew that first revelation
[1:09:45] was correct
[1:09:47] God can't give a first revelation then
[1:09:49] in second Revelation if he did he would
[1:09:51] be changing his mind
[1:09:53] now he can give a revelation and then
[1:09:55] add to it as he did in the Garden of
[1:09:56] Eden when he promised the seed to the
[1:09:58] woman and later designated that seed had
[1:10:00] to come through Abraham then later said
[1:10:02] it would come by the same Bloodlines in
[1:10:03] David but it was the same Revelation yes
[1:10:06] it only gave the people more information
[1:10:08] to help them receive and understand it
[1:10:11] but God's word can't change the seed
[1:10:14] came exactly as revealed
[1:10:17] that's right hey man he said and see
[1:10:20] what those false apostles were doing
[1:10:22] they came with their own word
[1:10:25] those Ephesians knew that the word that
[1:10:27] word as Paul had taught it they knew
[1:10:29] that word as Paul had taught it they
[1:10:31] were full of the Holy Ghost by the
[1:10:32] laying on of Paul's hands they looked
[1:10:35] those false Apostles in the eye and said
[1:10:38] you are not saying what Paul said you
[1:10:40] are therefore false right I can't tell
[1:10:44] you the comfort that that provided to me
[1:10:46] as a Young Man
[1:10:47] because I I knew enough to be respectful
[1:10:50] I I can honestly say I don't think my
[1:10:53] kids can necessarily say this but I can
[1:10:55] honestly say I never talk back to my dad
[1:10:58] one time about anything but the word of
[1:11:00] God
[1:11:01] I can ever remember
[1:11:04] God help me if that's not true true
[1:11:05] statement but my dad too was not a man
[1:11:07] that you talked back to
[1:11:12] he just wasn't he uh dad was you you
[1:11:16] didn't get a second chance
[1:11:18] but but when it comes to the word what
[1:11:20] am I supposed to do
[1:11:22] yeah right the word is it's got to be
[1:11:24] true or we don't have anything right
[1:11:26] right we don't have anything without the
[1:11:28] word
[1:11:29] so he said you're they looked him right
[1:11:31] in the eye and said you're not saying
[1:11:32] what Paul said you are therefore false
[1:11:35] he said oh that sets my heart on fire
[1:11:37] get back to the word he said it is not
[1:11:40] you that really tries the Apostle and
[1:11:43] prophet and teacher it is the word that
[1:11:46] tries them right
[1:11:48] wait a minute you said well nobody can
[1:11:51] try a prophet that's not what he said
[1:11:52] yes
[1:11:53] yes said it's not you that tries the
[1:11:55] Apostle and Prophet yeah
[1:11:58] yeah right because there's not another
[1:11:59] Messenger to the age
[1:12:01] right if there's one who comes and says
[1:12:03] he's a prophet today we get to try them
[1:12:05] the same way they did see if they're
[1:12:07] speaking what Paul said
[1:12:09] what brother Branham said
[1:12:11] he said it is the word that tries them
[1:12:14] one of these days there's going to come
[1:12:16] a prophet to the Legacy and church age I
[1:12:18] love the way he puts this he's trying to
[1:12:20] let people know without saying it's him
[1:12:23] but he says one of these days but we
[1:12:25] believe he fulfilled that he said one of
[1:12:27] these days there's going to come a
[1:12:28] prophet to the laodicean church age and
[1:12:30] you will know if he is the real one sent
[1:12:31] from God or not yes you will for if he
[1:12:34] is of God he will be in that word
[1:12:36] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[1:12:38] deviate from that word for a moment not
[1:12:40] by one I owed
[1:12:42] he said in that last page when there
[1:12:43] will be many false prophets appearing
[1:12:45] many
[1:12:47] he said watch and see how they keep
[1:12:48] telling you that if you don't believe
[1:12:50] them and what they say you'll be lost
[1:12:53] he said but when that last day Prophet
[1:12:56] comes on the scene
[1:12:58] if he's truly that prophet he will be
[1:13:00] crying out get back to the word or
[1:13:03] you're lost
[1:13:04] he won't build on a private Revelation
[1:13:06] or interpretation but on the word
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:13] this last thing that I thought of we
[1:13:14] don't want to rebuild these walls how
[1:13:16] how do we stay away from that stay in
[1:13:18] Revival yes
[1:13:20] there's always
[1:13:22] there's always a correlation between
[1:13:24] denominationalism and a lack of Revival
[1:13:27] when the Revival dies down then they
[1:13:30] build walls
[1:13:32] now again I know there's not going to be
[1:13:34] a sweeping Revival so we have to be that
[1:13:36] much more on guard
[1:13:37] because there's not a Revival to be
[1:13:39] caught up in in the sense of a sleeping
[1:13:41] Revival but there is a bride Revival
[1:13:43] that's going on right now
[1:13:45] right and but but look at Ahab
[1:13:48] why could Heil do what he did because he
[1:13:52] had a back-sid king
[1:13:54] he had a backsid king and that's who
[1:13:57] didn't care about the word anymore and
[1:13:59] by the way
[1:14:01] that's how you know if Revival is struck
[1:14:04] yeah can I just talk to you for a minute
[1:14:06] yeah
[1:14:07] you don't know that you're in Revival
[1:14:09] because people are running all over the
[1:14:10] building yes
[1:14:12] you know that you're in Revival because
[1:14:14] people care about the word again
[1:14:17] yes that's right that's how you know if
[1:14:20] you're in Revival no they they will
[1:14:22] shout they will run they'll do whatever
[1:14:23] the people will I was listening to uh
[1:14:26] the other day when the World Cup team
[1:14:27] won
[1:14:28] they come in they come into the hotel
[1:14:30] and they put it on social media and I
[1:14:32] was I watched part of it when they come
[1:14:34] in that hotel that people screamed
[1:14:37] and shouted because America won
[1:14:39] America won against Iran you should have
[1:14:41] heard the people they were overwhelmed
[1:14:43] by Joy I thought then they get mad at us
[1:14:45] because we want to shout in church
[1:14:47] we got something to shout about
[1:14:51] hey man we just get overwhelmed with joy
[1:14:53] but that's not the mark of Revival
[1:14:55] that's the effects of Revival but how
[1:14:57] you know you're in Revival is when you
[1:15:00] start caring about the word again the
[1:15:02] word says something you just do it you
[1:15:04] just follow it you you just go right
[1:15:06] into it you don't have to make yourself
[1:15:07] come to church you go to church why
[1:15:09] you're in Revival yeah
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:13] and what did that first church as they
[1:15:15] begin to rebuild those walls in that
[1:15:17] early church that Antichrist Spirit came
[1:15:20] in yes
[1:15:21] yes and what did that what was the thing
[1:15:22] that they did they lost their first love
[1:15:25] he said now someone against me because I
[1:15:27] was left by first love
[1:15:29] the brothers said they lost their love
[1:15:30] for Holy Ghost meetings
[1:15:32] he said that fervent desire to please
[1:15:34] God the passion to know his word the cry
[1:15:37] for reaching out on the spirit all
[1:15:39] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:15:40] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:15:42] God it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:15:44] formal right he said that is what was
[1:15:46] happening back there to the Ephesians
[1:15:48] they were getting a bit formal oh God
[1:15:50] help us not to have that formality come
[1:15:52] in among us because that's when Walls
[1:15:55] Start to go up
[1:15:56] that's when Fellowship begins to die
[1:15:59] now notice he said the abandoned
[1:16:01] abandonment to God was dying out the
[1:16:03] people weren't too careful about what
[1:16:05] God thought of them because they began
[1:16:07] to be careful about what the world
[1:16:08] thought of them
[1:16:10] and he talks about that second
[1:16:11] generation I don't have time he said
[1:16:13] that second generation began to drift
[1:16:15] where are we at church we're way more
[1:16:17] than two generations down but remember
[1:16:19] he said there has to be somebody who
[1:16:21] does not die there's got to be a real
[1:16:23] grain that breaks the cycle of Revival
[1:16:25] and death
[1:16:27] but he says that cycle of Revival and
[1:16:29] death has never failed notice he said it
[1:16:31] has never failed he doesn't say it would
[1:16:32] never fail
[1:16:33] because there's got to be a bride that
[1:16:35] breaks that cycle
[1:16:37] but that cycle of Revival and death has
[1:16:39] never failed all you have to do is
[1:16:40] recall this last move of God in the
[1:16:42] spirit when men and women dress like
[1:16:44] Christians went to church and prayed all
[1:16:45] night took the street corners weren't
[1:16:47] ashamed of the manifestation of the
[1:16:49] spirit they left their old dead churches
[1:16:51] and worshiped in homes or old store
[1:16:52] buildings they had reality but it wasn't
[1:16:55] too long a time until they began to get
[1:16:56] enough money to build fine new churches
[1:16:58] they put in a choir instead of singing
[1:17:00] unto God for themselves they put gowns
[1:17:02] on the choir and there's nothing wrong
[1:17:03] with the choir but what's he saying they
[1:17:05] didn't want to be it participate anymore
[1:17:08] listen if you don't want to participate
[1:17:10] in church you're not in Revival
[1:17:13] if you ever get in Revival you don't
[1:17:15] care who's around you brother Brandon
[1:17:17] said a Revival he said it's not what you
[1:17:19] do in church he said if you're in
[1:17:20] Revival he said you could be standing
[1:17:22] there washing the dishes and the tears
[1:17:24] begin to come down your face and when
[1:17:25] you begin to Worship the Lord while
[1:17:27] you're in Revival
[1:17:30] yes sir it's too strong for a Wednesday
[1:17:31] night I
[1:17:33] I'm not going to preach to you Sunday
[1:17:35] brother Timothy is
[1:17:37] now look
[1:17:39] don't let somebody do your worship for
[1:17:41] you yeah
[1:17:42] he said they organized the movement ran
[1:17:44] up by man they soon began to read books
[1:17:46] that weren't fit to read they let down
[1:17:48] the bars and goats came in and took over
[1:17:50] Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the
[1:17:53] spirit was gone oh they kept on with a
[1:17:55] form but the fire had died down and the
[1:17:57] Blackness of Ashes is about all that is
[1:17:59] left
[1:18:00] he said a few moments ago I mentioned
[1:18:02] that John understood what it was to love
[1:18:04] God that great Apostle of Love would
[1:18:06] certainly see it when the church began
[1:18:08] to lose that first love of God in John 5
[1:18:11] first John 5 and 3 he said for this is
[1:18:12] the love of God that we keep his
[1:18:14] Commandments his word
[1:18:16] one little deviation from that word was
[1:18:18] a step away from Christ
[1:18:20] are you hear me today don't you want to
[1:18:22] stay close to him don't you need him in
[1:18:24] your hour of trouble don't you need him
[1:18:26] in every moment of your life one little
[1:18:28] deviation from the word is a step away
[1:18:30] from Christ
[1:18:31] oh I want to stay with that word don't
[1:18:33] you I want us to stay with that word
[1:18:35] because I want us to be close to him
[1:18:39] people say they love God they go to
[1:18:41] church they even shout and rejoice and
[1:18:42] sing have a great emotional time but
[1:18:45] when it's all over watch and see if
[1:18:46] they're in that word walking in and
[1:18:48] living in it if they go through all the
[1:18:51] other and then don't walk in that word
[1:18:52] they can say they love God but their
[1:18:54] lives tell another story
[1:18:55] he said I wonder if John didn't see a
[1:18:57] lot of that before he died people saying
[1:18:59] they love God but not obeying his word
[1:19:01] oh Ephesian Church something is
[1:19:04] happening to you
[1:19:05] someone is trying to either add to that
[1:19:07] word or take from it but they're doing
[1:19:09] it so subtly that you can't see it they
[1:19:11] haven't made a move so big that you can
[1:19:13] see it out there in the open it's
[1:19:14] undercover they're bringing it by way of
[1:19:16] reason and human understanding and it
[1:19:18] will take over unless you refuse it it
[1:19:21] will take over unless you refuse it
[1:19:23] unless you're willing to stand up and
[1:19:25] say these this is a liar
[1:19:27] are you with me now
[1:19:29] we will take over unless you refuse it
[1:19:32] go back to Pentecost
[1:19:33] before it's too late
[1:19:35] but as usual people don't hate God's
[1:19:37] warning a Revival fire built upon the
[1:19:40] sacred word is so wonderful listen as
[1:19:42] I'm closing the manifestation of the
[1:19:45] spirit so blessed
[1:19:47] that a little fear Creeps in
[1:19:52] they love it so much
[1:19:55] you realize you're if
[1:19:59] excuse me brother Stewart but I was
[1:20:01] concerned about your son when he was
[1:20:03] lost the other day in the laundry basket
[1:20:05] not as concerned as his mama was
[1:20:09] I can guarantee you that
[1:20:12] why because that's her baby
[1:20:15] she loves him with a different kind of
[1:20:16] love
[1:20:18] are you with me now
[1:20:20] you lose your kid and you can call me
[1:20:22] and tell me and I'll pray and I'll be
[1:20:23] concerned but not the way you will be
[1:20:25] are you hearing me now
[1:20:27] why because you have a different kind of
[1:20:30] love
[1:20:31] and and so it belongs to you and I
[1:20:35] understood this this love that's there
[1:20:36] and sometimes what we love we want to
[1:20:38] protect
[1:20:40] don't we yes we want to protect it but
[1:20:43] in doing that when it comes to the word
[1:20:44] we've got to be careful not to rebuild
[1:20:47] the walls and say well I'll protect it
[1:20:50] by not fellowshipping with anybody
[1:20:51] that's not going to protect you
[1:20:54] building walls doesn't protect you
[1:20:57] because everything that can be shaken
[1:20:59] will be shaken down and all those walls
[1:21:01] become is something that holds you in
[1:21:04] keeps you from moving on
[1:21:06] Christ
[1:21:08] he said the manifestation of the spirit
[1:21:10] is so blessed just look at what's
[1:21:12] happened in the message of the hour we
[1:21:13] had a wonderful prophet a wonderful
[1:21:16] message
[1:21:17] are you with me tonight but that little
[1:21:19] fear Creeps in
[1:21:21] a whisper in the heart says
[1:21:23] how can we protect this truth we have
[1:21:27] what can we do to see this revival goes
[1:21:30] on
[1:21:32] maybe we should form a group of men and
[1:21:34] start dictating what people preach
[1:21:37] maybe we should just quit listening to
[1:21:40] Ministry altogether
[1:21:42] just stay with the tapes
[1:21:45] fear creeping in
[1:21:48] a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in
[1:21:51] the heart says how can we protect the
[1:21:53] truth we have what can we do to see this
[1:21:55] revival goes on
[1:21:57] that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes
[1:21:59] in
[1:22:00] and Whispers look you have the truth now
[1:22:03] see that it doesn't get lost
[1:22:05] organize and set up your Creed of what
[1:22:07] you believe
[1:22:09] you see many people will separate with
[1:22:10] you not over the word but over their
[1:22:12] Creed
[1:22:13] a Creed is something you built walls you
[1:22:15] built to protect the word
[1:22:18] yeah
[1:22:19] they're not separating because of the
[1:22:22] word they're separating because of their
[1:22:23] idea of the word
[1:22:27] they set up a Creed around the word and
[1:22:29] they said well we're protecting it we're
[1:22:30] keeping ourselves pure no you're killing
[1:22:33] it
[1:22:35] yeah yeah
[1:22:36] organizing set up your creative what you
[1:22:38] believe put it all in a church manual
[1:22:40] and they do it
[1:22:42] they won't let their young people
[1:22:43] fellowship with anybody they won't let
[1:22:45] are you with me tonight we don't want to
[1:22:47] ever do that
[1:22:48] they won't hear nobody outside their own
[1:22:50] little group
[1:22:51] they organized they had to the word and
[1:22:54] they died just like Eve did for taking
[1:22:56] one wrong word
[1:22:58] it's God's word that brings life
[1:23:00] and it's not what we say about the word
[1:23:03] that counts
[1:23:04] but it's what God Said
[1:23:06] do we believe that tonight
[1:23:08] hey man musicians go ahead and come how
[1:23:10] many can say I want that Revival to burn
[1:23:12] in my heart I want that Revival to burn
[1:23:14] in My Heart Lord help me I don't want to
[1:23:16] build walls I don't want to protect Lord
[1:23:18] I know you can protect it you can
[1:23:21] protect if you tore it down there's a
[1:23:22] reason why you tore it down let me move
[1:23:25] on Lord let me go on into the land don't
[1:23:28] let me be like hail
[1:23:29] because I may have a beautiful wall but
[1:23:32] I've lost my children
[1:23:33] my Creed may be intact
[1:23:36] but my children are gone
[1:23:39] you imagine how he must have felt if he
[1:23:41] ever read that scripture brother Harvey
[1:23:42] If you ever went back to judges and read
[1:23:44] what Joshua said
[1:23:46] he told me it would happen
[1:23:49] and I'm sitting here my walls look good
[1:23:51] he let him build the walls he didn't
[1:23:53] shake them down again
[1:23:54] but he lost his children
[1:23:57] God help us today
[1:23:59] let's stay open
[1:24:01] yeah I know it's easy to get hurt when
[1:24:02] you're open
[1:24:03] You're vulnerable it's easy to get hurt
[1:24:06] when you love people
[1:24:08] but let's let's stay loving let's keep
[1:24:10] that brotherly love for one another
[1:24:11] let's not build walls around creeps
[1:24:16] let's let's say what a prophet said
[1:24:19] but if there's somebody that stands up
[1:24:21] and says something different and it's
[1:24:22] off the word not some little thing but
[1:24:24] something that's off the word
[1:24:26] and stand up and say that's a lying
[1:24:28] spirit
[1:24:31] and we need to identify it as such
[1:24:34] bow your heads with me if that that
[1:24:36] thing that tells you you can't make it
[1:24:38] you know that's a lie
[1:24:40] why don't you point your finger in that
[1:24:42] Devil's face tonight and say that's
[1:24:43] you're a lying spirit
[1:24:47] a thing that tells you that well I'm
[1:24:49] just going to quit Church nobody cares
[1:24:50] about me anyway it's a lie
[1:24:52] it's a lying Apostle that's not what the
