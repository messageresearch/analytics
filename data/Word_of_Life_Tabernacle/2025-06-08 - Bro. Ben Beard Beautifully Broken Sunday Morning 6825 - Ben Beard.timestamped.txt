[27:29] Saint
[27:31] for
[27:34] you. Amen. Do you love him this morning?
[27:37] Is that what you want to do? Want to be
[27:39] a sanctuary for him today? Amen. This
[27:42] morning's been a a wild coming. Uh
[27:44] brother Ben Beard, uh we had him in, if
[27:47] you'll remember, last winter and uh we
[27:51] had a snowstorm that day. I don't know,
[27:53] some of y'all remember that cuz you
[27:54] ended up in the ditch. But we had a
[27:56] snowstorm that day and he had to leave
[27:59] and we rushed through the service. So, I
[28:02] thought, well, we'll get him back. Well,
[28:03] we tried to get him back in April of
[28:05] this year and uh and the roads were
[28:08] closed because of flooding and uh so it
[28:12] didn't work again. And so it must have
[28:15] been meant for him to preach this
[28:17] morning to us because the sun's shining
[28:20] and there's no snow and no uh nothing
[28:23] like that. So we're glad to have you.
[28:25] Now this week, you know, I've been sick
[28:27] as you know and I appreciate your
[28:28] prayers. I feel a lot better this
[28:30] morning, but uh Brother Ben got sick,
[28:32] too. And so I thought this week that he
[28:35] wouldn't be able to come, but God helped
[28:37] him that he would be able to come. and
[28:39] and I so there must be something special
[28:41] for us today that the Lord wants to show
[28:44] us and he wants to preach to us. So, uh
[28:47] it'll be it'll be good. I'm sure. I know
[28:49] brother Ben is a wonderful pastor. I'm
[28:52] so proud of the job that he's done there
[28:54] at Galina. We get a chance to go visit
[28:56] them when they have meetings and things.
[28:58] I know it'd be a blessing. And uh when
[29:00] we have our meetings, boy, they just
[29:02] fill up the church here. And we're so
[29:04] grateful for their fellowship and their
[29:05] love. And Sister Tiffany's here
[29:07] somewhere this morning. and God bless
[29:09] you. Thank you for for coming and being
[29:11] with us. I know she's not feeling 100%
[29:13] today, but thank you for being with us
[29:15] today. And so, we're going to invite
[29:17] brother Ben to come and you just open up
[29:19] your heart and I believe the Lord will
[29:21] speak directly to you today. How many
[29:23] has a need this morning? Then God can
[29:26] meet that need. Do we really believe
[29:27] that? Brother Brandham, just over and
[29:29] over, I was listening to a tape
[29:31] yesterday. He's telling people if you
[29:32] believe he's here then he said then your
[29:36] faith can rise to that place where you
[29:38] know that he's here. He said then
[29:40] anything can happen. Then if he's here
[29:42] this morning then every need that we
[29:44] have can be met by the power of the Holy
[29:47] Ghost. We're believing for healing today
[29:49] and salvation and whatever it is that we
[29:51] have need of believe that he'll meet
[29:53] that need. Amen. Let's sing that again
[29:56] as brother Ben comes. Oh Lord,
[30:01] prepare me. Just lift your hands to him.
[30:04] Make it your prayer now.
[30:08] [Music]

[32:27] living sanctuary.
[32:31] [Music]
[32:36] for
[32:37] [Music]
[32:38] you. Is that your desire this morning?
[32:42] Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning.
[32:44] If you have a need on your heart, if
[32:46] you'd make it known by the uplifted hand
[32:47] this morning, not raising that hand to
[32:50] me, but raising it to him this morning.
[32:54] Dear heavenly
[32:56] father, Lord, we come to you this
[32:59] morning, Lord,
[33:01] and and God, it's with great
[33:04] expectation, Lord, that we
[33:07] come, Lord, knowing, Father,
[33:10] that Lord, we're taught through a
[33:12] prophetic ministry, Lord, that you keep
[33:14] every appointment,
[33:17] Lord. And Lord, you'll always go where
[33:19] you're invited.
[33:22] So Lord, this morning, Father, we we've
[33:25] sang the songs of Zion and and Lord,
[33:28] we've invited you into this place, Lord.
[33:31] And and God, we know you're here,
[33:34] Father, because Lord, you said where two
[33:36] or three' be gathered in your name,
[33:38] there in their midst, you'd be, Lord.
[33:40] And Lord, I look out across the building
[33:43] today, Lord. And Lord, there's many
[33:46] more, Father, than two or three here
[33:48] today. And so, Lord, I know, Father,
[33:51] that you're here. And so, Lord, I ask,
[33:54] Father, that Lord, you would just come.
[33:57] And you'd step out of the shadows as it
[33:59] were, Father. And and Lord, you'd begin
[34:02] to move up and down the corridors of
[34:04] every heart this morning. Lord, I I'm
[34:07] just a man, Father. I don't know the
[34:09] needs of the people, Lord. But but God,
[34:12] I'm so glad you do this morning, Lord.
[34:15] And so, Lord, I ask you, Father, that
[34:17] Lord, you'd just step down and Lord,
[34:20] you'd be free in the building today,
[34:22] dear God. And Lord, you'd minister to
[34:25] every heart this morning, Father. Lord,
[34:28] I ask, Father, that Lord, you'd take
[34:29] lives this morning. And and God, by the
[34:32] power of your word, Lord, would you
[34:33] just, Lord, turn them around this
[34:36] morning, Lord. Maybe they're maybe
[34:37] they're discouraged this morning, but
[34:39] may you come, Lord, and lift their head
[34:41] this morning, Father. Lord, maybe
[34:43] they're they're brokenhearted, but God,
[34:45] you are the God that can men the broken
[34:47] heart this morning, Lord. Lord, maybe
[34:50] they've grown cold on you, but Lord,
[34:51] would you pull them right up close to
[34:53] you this morning, Lord? And God, let
[34:55] them know, Father, that you still see
[34:57] them, Lord, and you still care for them
[34:58] this morning, Lord. God, maybe they're
[35:01] sick this morning, but God, you're the
[35:03] great physician this morning, Lord. I
[35:05] ask you, Father, to just come and Lord,
[35:07] make yourself known as a healer, Lord.
[35:10] Oh God, maybe Lord, there's some that
[35:12] don't know you, Father. Lord, may you
[35:14] make yourself known as a savior this
[35:16] morning, Lord. Oh God, we just Lord, we
[35:20] come, Lord, to give you great praise and
[35:22] all glory and honor this morning, Lord.
[35:24] God, we we don't want to lay down on you
[35:27] this morning, but God, we want to give
[35:28] you all that we have this morning, Lord.
[35:31] For truly, Lord, how many across the
[35:33] world, Father, would give anything,
[35:34] Lord, to be sitting in these pews we're
[35:36] sitting in, Lord. God, to hear this
[35:38] message that's going that's being
[35:40] preached, Lord, this that's going to be
[35:41] preached this morning, Lord. God, how
[35:44] many people, Father, Lord, would give
[35:45] anything, Lord. God, I ask, Father, that
[35:48] Lord, you would just come and Lord,
[35:50] anoint the speaker this morning, Father.
[35:52] Lord, not just anoint me, but anoint the
[35:54] hearer this morning, Father. And God, I
[35:57] ask, Father, that Lord, this
[35:58] supernatural, Father, would be on
[36:00] display this morning, Lord. Lord, we
[36:03] know, Father, that Lord, signs and
[36:05] wonders, Father, they'll be right at the
[36:06] hands of the believers, dear God. And
[36:08] Lord, in the last day, Father, Lord,
[36:10] that we know, we know that signs and
[36:12] wonders will follow the believer, Lord.
[36:15] Lord, the believer doesn't follow after
[36:16] them, but they follow after the
[36:18] believer, God. So, Lord, we just we
[36:20] know, Father, that that is, Lord, that's
[36:22] a part of this day. So Lord, we just we
[36:25] surrender oursel to you this morning,
[36:27] Lord. God, I ask, Father, for every
[36:29] need, Father. Every hand that went up
[36:31] across the building this morning, Lord.
[36:34] God, you see what's on each heart,
[36:36] Father. I ask you, Father, to meet that
[36:39] need this morning, Lord. Lord, would you
[36:41] come, Father, be their portion this
[36:43] morning, Lord, many needs across the
[36:46] building. No doubt some are serious,
[36:48] Lord. Oh, but God, you know each one,
[36:51] Father. So come Lord and minister to
[36:53] every heart this morning. Lord bless
[36:56] this church father. Bless the pastor
[36:58] Lord. Bless the ministry father. Bless
[37:01] the leoty dear God. And Lord may this
[37:03] always be father. Lord a great beacon of
[37:06] light father shining out lord. Guiding
[37:09] the lost souls unto thee father. Oh Lord
[37:12] would you just grant that this morning
[37:14] father. Lord we love you now. Father, I
[37:17] stand here this morning. And Lord, I
[37:20] just report for duty, Lord, and I
[37:22] surrender all that I am, Lord into thy
[37:25] hands for your glory and for your honor
[37:29] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[37:34] bless you, church. It's certainly good
[37:35] to see each one of you here this
[37:37] morning. Turn with us in in your Bibles
[37:38] this morning to to Job chapter 1, verse
[37:43] 6 this morning. Uh certainly a privilege
[37:46] to be here this morning. We we certainly
[37:49] uh love your pastor and sister Britney.
[37:51] Amen. And the family here and and the
[37:54] church here. It's just been a wonderful
[37:57] uh work that the Lord has done here in
[37:59] at Word of Life here in Hardy. And we
[38:01] just say God bless each one of you. And
[38:03] it's a it's a privilege to be here.
[38:05] Beautiful day to serve the Lord this
[38:07] morning. Amen. No storms, no snowtorrms,
[38:11] no rain. Amen. kind of starting to get a
[38:13] complex. But uh you know, we was coming
[38:16] up the road yesterday afternoon and we
[38:19] got about to West Plains and it just
[38:21] started pouring rain and I looked at my
[38:24] wife and I said, "The Lord has a sense
[38:25] of humor." Amen. But uh nonetheless,
[38:29] we're here today and we are certainly
[38:31] count it a great privilege to be here.
[38:33] God, we say God bless you from the
[38:34] little church there at home and uh send
[38:37] you greetings from all of them there and
[38:39] uh you all have just been a real
[38:41] blessing to us.
[38:43] Job chapter 1 verse 6 this morning. A
[38:46] very very simple thought this morning
[38:47] that I'd like to take here this morning.
[38:50] It says this. Now there was a day when
[38:54] the sons of God came to present
[38:56] themselves before the Lord. And Satan
[38:59] came also among them. And the Lord said
[39:03] unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" Then
[39:07] Satan answered the Lord and said,"From
[39:09] going to and fro in the earth, and from
[39:12] walking up and down in it." And the Lord
[39:15] said unto Satan, "Hast thou
[39:18] considered my servant
[39:20] Job? There is none like him in the
[39:23] earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
[39:27] that fearth God and a chewth evil."
[39:31] Then Satan answered the Lord, and said,
[39:33] Doth Job fear God for not? Hast not thou
[39:37] made a hedge about him, and about his
[39:40] house, and about all that he hath on
[39:43] every side? Thou hast blessed the work
[39:46] of his hands, and his substance is
[39:48] increased in the land. But put forth
[39:51] thine hand, and touch all that he hath,
[39:55] and he will curse thee to thy face."
[39:58] Quite a boast there, wasn't
[40:00] it? And the Lord said unto
[40:04] Satan, "Behold, all that he hath is in
[40:08] thy power, only upon himself put not
[40:11] forth thine hand." So Satan went forth
[40:14] from the presence of the Lord. And there
[40:17] was in the day, and we're just going to
[40:18] read this all the way through, so just
[40:20] bear with me just for a moment, and I'll
[40:22] have you be seated. And there was a day
[40:24] when his sons and his daughters were
[40:26] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[40:28] brother's
[40:29] house. And there came a messenger unto
[40:33] Job, saying, "The oxen were plowing, and
[40:35] the asses feeding beside them. And the
[40:38] Sabians fell upon them, and took them
[40:39] away. Yay, they slain the servants with
[40:43] the edge of the sword, and I only am
[40:46] escaped alone to tell thee." While he
[40:48] was yet speaking, there came another
[40:50] also another and said, "The fire of God
[40:52] has fallen from heaven and hath burned
[40:55] up the sheep and the servants and
[40:58] consumed them, and I
[41:00] only escaped alone to tell thee." While
[41:04] he was yet speaking, there came also
[41:06] another and said, "The Chaldans ca made
[41:09] out three bands and fell upon the the
[41:12] camels and have carried them away. Yay.
[41:15] And slain the servants with the edge of
[41:16] the sword. And I only am escaped alone
[41:19] to tell thee. While he was yet speaking,
[41:21] there came also another and said, "Thy
[41:24] sons and thy daughters were eating and
[41:25] drinking wine in their eldest brother's
[41:28] house. And behold, there came a great
[41:30] wind in the from the wilderness and
[41:32] smoked the four corners of the house.
[41:34] And it fell upon the young men, and they
[41:36] are dead. And I only am escaped alone to
[41:41] tell thee." Then Job arose and rent his
[41:45] mantel and shaved his head and fell down
[41:47] on the ground and worshiped and said,
[41:51] "Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
[41:54] and naked shall I return thither. The
[41:57] Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,
[42:01] but blessed be the name of our Lord."
[42:07] In all this, Job sinned not, nor charged
[42:12] God foolishly. God bless you. You can
[42:15] have your seats this
[42:26] morning. Like to take a thought this
[42:28] morning for just a few moments if it'd
[42:31] be pleasing to the Lord. and would like
[42:34] to title this this morning just a very
[42:37] simple thought on beautifully
[42:41] broken.
[42:43] Beautifully
[42:46] broken. Maybe just a bit of a an odd
[42:51] text or an odd subject this morning
[42:54] because typically when you think of
[42:56] brokenness, there's typically no beauty
[42:59] that would come to mind.
[43:02] But you know, when you think of
[43:03] brokenness, if you're like me and you
[43:06] you look at in the Bible or in the
[43:07] scripture, one of the first people that
[43:10] come to mind is is
[43:13] Job. Because there was nobody in the
[43:15] scripture, Amen. that would that would
[43:19] go through as much as what Job would go
[43:22] through.
[43:24] But, you know, I I was looking and and
[43:27] as you begin to read the account of Job
[43:30] and and you know, Job was a a man that
[43:34] prior to this time in his life, he was a
[43:37] man in wellstanding and a man that that
[43:40] everybody would look to and they would
[43:42] look at Job and they would say, "Well,
[43:44] Job, he he's got everything together and
[43:47] Job is a man that that he he had
[43:50] everything in that day or in that age."
[43:52] You would look at Job and Job had money.
[43:55] He had he had w his wife, his children,
[43:58] and all of those things. And if you were
[44:00] to look at Job, you'd say, "Well, he was
[44:02] a blessed man by all accounts." And but
[44:05] yet we find a time, amen, when when
[44:10] Satan would be wandering to and fro in
[44:13] all of the earth and he would be looking
[44:14] and he would be uh trying to find
[44:17] somewhere to to to to go. And and it
[44:21] said in the Bible that the sons of God
[44:23] came and they presented themselves
[44:26] before God. But I wanted you to notice
[44:28] that among the sons of God also, Satan
[44:31] was present. And you know, I believe
[44:34] that even in the church, Satan is
[44:36] present. You know, he's the most
[44:37] faithful member that we have in the
[44:39] church. Amen. He never misses a service.
[44:42] But but the Bible says that that as the
[44:45] sons of God were were presenting
[44:47] themselves, Amen. that that Satan that
[44:50] God looked to Satan and he began to talk
[44:52] to him. He said, "Whence comest thou
[44:55] Satan?" And Satan looked at him and
[44:57] said, "From roaming to and fro in all of
[44:59] the earth looking for somebody." And
[45:02] then God by design, he turned Satan
[45:05] toward
[45:06] Job. Amen. And he took him and he he
[45:09] turned his thoughts and his attention
[45:11] toward Job. And and Satan looked at God
[45:14] and he said, "Yeah, but God, you've got
[45:15] him so built around. You got him so
[45:17] hedged in that I I've already tried that
[45:20] avenue. I've already tried to get to
[45:22] Job, but I I can't reach Job because
[45:24] you've got him so sheltered. But God
[45:28] looked but but Satan made a boast. He
[45:30] said, "But if you'll remove that hedge,
[45:33] if you'll take that shelter from him, I
[45:35] promise you, he'll curse you to your
[45:37] face." But God had so much confidence.
[45:41] God had so much confidence in Job that
[45:44] he he looked at Satan and he said, "It
[45:46] doesn't really matter." Why? Because God
[45:49] had already placed something inside of
[45:51] Job that he knew would never be shaken
[45:53] and it would never be moved. Amen. He
[45:56] wasn't just standing there. Amen. Job
[45:59] many maybe he didn't even feel like he
[46:01] could he was he was anything. He didn't
[46:03] feel like he was special. But yet God
[46:05] saw something in Job that was special.
[46:10] I'm not going to preach anything strange
[46:12] today. I'm just going to preach this
[46:13] morning. I'm not a a a deep preacher.
[46:16] I'm just a preacher. Amen. And so, we're
[46:19] just going to do that this
[46:20] morning. But he looked and he he said he
[46:23] said, "But I guarantee you." Amen. He'll
[46:26] not curse me. He said he looked at at
[46:29] Job. Amen. And he said, "Brother Joe,"
[46:32] he said he said, "I you go have him." He
[46:35] said, "But you can do you can't take his
[46:37] life." Amen. So, we see how that how
[46:40] that Satan he went. And you talk about a
[46:42] bad day. Job had a bad day.
[46:46] Amen. I don't think anybody's had that
[46:47] kind of day here.
[46:50] Amen. But you know, you look and you
[46:53] watch how Job came from the top and all
[46:57] in a moment he went to the bottom.
[47:01] All in a moment something begin to
[47:03] happen. And and Job, God didn't consult
[47:06] Job and say, "Hey, Job, this is I I I
[47:08] I've done this. This is by my choosing.
[47:11] God didn't consult him. It just be to
[47:13] happen. Amen. But Job be to everything
[47:17] begin to fall apart. But God knew that
[47:19] Job would never move from what he would
[47:21] had what God had placed in him. And let
[47:24] me tell you something, brother, sister.
[47:26] Maybe you find yourself today in a spot,
[47:29] amen, where it feels like everything
[47:31] around you has went wrong and everything
[47:33] in your life has been broken and
[47:35] everything in your life it seems like is
[47:37] against you, brother, sister. But let me
[47:40] tell you, God has that much confidence
[47:42] in you that you'll stand the test of
[47:45] time. Amen. This thought was actually
[47:48] inspired. You you take and I I I was
[47:51] standing at my mother-in-law's house
[47:53] here a few years ago and I was in their
[47:56] in their home getting ready to preach
[47:58] there in in Salem when he was pastoring
[48:00] there. Brother Tim was pastoring and I I
[48:02] stood in their hallway and she had this
[48:04] picture hung up there and and this
[48:07] picture it was a it was a picture of of
[48:09] glass that was broken into many
[48:11] different pieces.
[48:12] And and that picture, it was it was all
[48:16] this glass that had different colors in
[48:18] it and it was just busted up beyond
[48:20] beyond repair. And and it was a bro a
[48:24] picture of brokenness and the
[48:25] inscription above it read beautifully
[48:28] broken. And what it was it just begin to
[48:31] strike my heart and I thought you know
[48:33] Lord. Amen. Somebody something had
[48:35] happened and at one point maybe it was a
[48:38] beautiful image. Maybe it was a
[48:40] beautiful picture, but yet something had
[48:42] happened to break that glass down into
[48:45] many different picture into many
[48:47] different pieces. But yet God, somebody
[48:50] looked and they saw the brokenness in
[48:52] that glass. They saw the brokenness in
[48:55] that glass and they they looked at it.
[48:57] Instead of seeing brokenness, they saw
[48:59] beauty. and laying there in the ground
[49:01] or or where wherever it was at, they
[49:04] begin to pick up the broken pieces and
[49:07] they begin to put that piece in there
[49:09] and that piece in there and they begin
[49:12] to make an image. Why? Because somebody
[49:15] with an image in their mind, they saw
[49:18] something that was not broken, but they
[49:20] saw something that was beautiful and
[49:23] they took them broken pieces and they
[49:26] begin to make something beautiful out of
[49:29] that image. Brother, sister, you may
[49:31] have a broken life. You may have lived a
[49:33] brokenness, but let me tell you
[49:35] something. God's able to take your
[49:38] broken heart and he's able to mend it
[49:40] and he's able to make something
[49:42] beautiful out of that broken image.
[49:46] Amen. But you understand that the devil,
[49:48] he'll tell you, "Well, you've went too
[49:50] far or you've done this or you've done
[49:52] that. There's no Holy Ghost for you."
[49:54] Let me tell you something. If there's a
[49:57] desire in your heart for more of God,
[50:00] there's more of God to be had. If
[50:03] there's a desire in your heart for your
[50:05] heart to be mended, there's a mener
[50:08] somewhere to mend that broken heart this
[50:11] morning. If there's a desire, church, oh
[50:15] my. But I looked at that and I thought I
[50:17] thought, you know, at one point maybe
[50:19] that was a that was a beautiful a pod or
[50:22] a beautiful vase or whatever, but
[50:25] something had happened to break it down.
[50:28] But yet somebody didn't give up on what
[50:30] it was. They looked at it and said, "It
[50:34] still has worth. It still has value. It
[50:37] still has something that can produce
[50:40] beauty." And a lot of time out of the
[50:42] brokenness of the heart, the most
[50:45] beautiful image come forth. Why? Because
[50:48] out of the testing and out of the trial,
[50:51] that is Christ building and shaping and
[50:54] forming the character of himself within
[50:58] us.
[51:00] Hallelujah.
[51:01] But we many times we look and we we lose
[51:05] hope.
[51:06] But I want to tell
[51:08] you just because you're in a a season of
[51:12] brokenness
[51:14] doesn't mean that your worth or your
[51:17] value has diminished.
[51:21] Many times our brokenness is by
[51:24] design by the design of the creator.
[51:28] Not because he he he chooses to uh to
[51:32] look at you and to just run you through
[51:34] the meal just because he wants to run
[51:36] you through the meal, brother Harvey.
[51:38] But he he takes and he he he'll he he
[51:40] he'll he he'll run you through that. But
[51:42] what's he doing that for? It's because
[51:44] he knows that he's placed something
[51:46] inside of you. Amen. That will keep you
[51:49] in the deepest of valleys, in the
[51:51] longest of nights, it'll keep you,
[51:53] church. Oh my. But in that brokenness,
[51:56] it's many time it's then when the devil,
[51:59] he comes and he begins to whisper in
[52:01] your ear and he begins to try to stop
[52:04] you from moving on in the things of God.
[52:06] I think of the prophet of God whenever
[52:08] he would lose his wife and his baby, he
[52:11] said as I was in that place, he said in
[52:13] that brokenness, he said there the devil
[52:15] was present. He said he be to talk to
[52:18] me. He began to tell me what good have
[52:20] you done? Hey, if if God would would if
[52:23] you do do you really think that God
[52:25] loves you? Do you think that if God
[52:27] loved you, he would put you through
[52:29] this? And let me tell you something.
[52:30] Whenever you're at your lowest, that's
[52:32] when the devil is the most present.
[52:34] Whenever you're at your most
[52:36] brokenheart, that's when the devil is
[52:38] ever present. And he begins to whisper
[52:40] and he begins to talk, but don't turn an
[52:43] ear to him, but to miss him and move on.
[52:47] But we realized that in that moment that
[52:49] that devil stood there and he said, "Why
[52:51] would God take your wife and baby and he
[52:53] said, "And I begin to agree.
[52:58] I begin to agree."
[53:02] Oh my. Don't tell me you've never been
[53:05] there before.
[53:10] I don't know why I'm preaching this this
[53:12] morning.
[53:17] Amen. But Job was a man that would that
[53:21] would be broken. But yet but yet after
[53:24] he had lost everything all in a moment
[53:26] all in just a few moments time for joy
[53:29] lost everything. And then it said then
[53:31] Job arose and he ripped his mantel and
[53:34] he shaved his head. Why? Because he was
[53:37] in deep despair.
[53:41] He shaved his head and he and he fell
[53:44] down on the ground and
[53:47] he worshiped.
[53:51] Oh my. Where's the worship gone in the
[53:53] churches today?
[53:55] Where's the praise and the praise
[53:57] offering went in the churches today?
[53:59] Have we not got nothing to worship
[54:01] about?
[54:04] Let me tell you something, church.
[54:07] Sometimes our churches are the quietest
[54:08] place and they ought to be the loudest
[54:10] place. Let me tell you, let me one day
[54:12] Jesus was riding into town and they
[54:14] begin to they begin to scream out,
[54:16] "Hosana, hosana, blessed be his name.
[54:19] Hosana, holy, holy, holy." And they
[54:21] looked at him and they said, "Can't you
[54:23] make them be still?" And he said, "If
[54:25] they don't worship, if they don't do it,
[54:28] them rocks will cry out." But you
[54:31] understand, we were designed and we were
[54:34] created to do that.
[54:36] Hallelujah. We were designed to and
[54:39] created to worship. Oh my. But we we you
[54:42] know the house of God is the one place
[54:44] that that the devil attacks the most.
[54:47] Come on, somebody. Amen. Because they
[54:50] call it emotionalism. They call it
[54:51] whatever. And let me tell you, there's a
[54:53] middle of the road to all those things.
[54:55] That's right. Amen. But but but you
[54:58] understand that that we were called and
[55:00] we were designed to do those things.
[55:03] Amen. But he said he worshiped and said
[55:07] naked came I out of my mother's womb and
[55:09] naked shall I return. Thither the Lord
[55:11] gave and the Lord taken away but blessed
[55:15] be the name of our Lord and in all that
[55:18] Job never sinned. He never lost his
[55:21] testimony. He never his testimony never
[55:24] changed. Amen. and and for him will I
[55:27] accept 1952 Job lived long a long time
[55:31] along the time of Nimrod back in there
[55:33] somewhere down from Seth to Abraham it
[55:36] was written the book of Job before
[55:37] Genesis was he said but but he was a
[55:40] priest and a prince and he loved the
[55:43] Lord and God blessed him and made him a
[55:45] great man and then Satan came up said
[55:48] now here's what what I want you to want
[55:50] you to watch he said Satan come up with
[55:52] the sons of God he was sitting right
[55:54] among them and God begin to speak about
[55:56] the earth and he said Satan have you
[55:59] considered my servant Job a perfect man
[56:02] none like him in the earth Satan said oh
[56:05] yes said oh yes said you got him hedged
[56:09] up you're you're blessing him and giving
[56:11] him everything you could give him said
[56:14] sure he will serve you like that let me
[56:16] tell you something it's easy to serve
[56:18] God in the good times
[56:20] it's easy to serve God when everything's
[56:22] going just fine but whenever a little
[56:24] trouble sets into your house, brother,
[56:27] sister. All of a sudden, you begin to
[56:29] get shaky in your in your confession.
[56:31] You begin to get shaky in your
[56:32] testimony. But that's not the time.
[56:35] That's not the time. The time is to
[56:37] stand there and say, "The Lord hath
[56:40] given, and the Lord taketh away, but
[56:43] blessed be the name of the Lord." Oh,
[56:46] it's easy to stand there and say, "Oh,
[56:48] praise God. Hallelujah." when
[56:50] something's going good in your life, but
[56:52] when the devil sets up camp in your
[56:54] door, amen, it it begins to he begins to
[56:58] take that testimony and the testimony
[57:00] goes from positive to negative. But
[57:02] brother, sister, never let that
[57:04] testimony be negative. But always say,
[57:07] "The Lord hath given, but the Lord hath
[57:10] taken away. Blessed be the name of the
[57:13] Lord, though you slay me, Lord, yet I
[57:16] still serve you, Lord.
[57:20] Though you slay me, I'm still going to
[57:22] serve you, Lord. I'm not going to back
[57:24] up. I'm not going to I'm not going to
[57:26] get weary and welloing. But I'm going to
[57:28] stand on this message. Come on, church.
[57:30] I'm going to stand on this message when
[57:32] nobody else will stand. If mama leaves
[57:35] it, if daddy leaves it, if my pastor
[57:37] leaves it, I'm going to stand in this
[57:40] message. Why? Because it is the truth in
[57:42] this hour. Oh God, let us stand in this
[57:45] hour. Let us be be bold in the things
[57:48] that we proclaim. Let us not be afraid
[57:50] to preach this message without fear and
[57:53] without favor. Let us not be afraid to
[57:55] declare it from the rooftops.
[57:59] Let us not be afraid to live it.
[58:11] Oh, it's easy to when you're on the
[58:13] mountaintop to serve the Lord. But I
[58:15] want to tell you something. The God on
[58:17] the mountain, he's still the same God in
[58:19] the
[58:20] valley. And let me tell you, a lot of
[58:22] times you find yourself in the valley,
[58:24] that's when the most good gets done is
[58:26] in that valley.
[58:32] Hallelujah.
[58:36] He's here now.
[58:39] Thank you, Lord. He said God blessed
[58:42] him. He said then Satan come up. He
[58:44] said, "Oh, yes." He said, "Sure, he will
[58:46] serve you like that. You got a hedge
[58:48] about him." "Sure, he's going to serve
[58:51] you." He said, "But you let me have him,
[58:54] and I'll make him curse you to your
[58:56] face. Let me tell you something." He
[58:58] said, "Now," he said, "He's in your
[59:00] hands now. I'll break that hedge, but
[59:04] you can't have his life.
[59:08] I'll take that hedge of from around him,
[59:10] but you can't have his life."
[59:13] And Satan did everything but take his
[59:15] life. He took his children. He broke him
[59:17] out with boils. He spoiled all of his
[59:19] goods. He made him a popper and set him
[59:22] on an ash heap scraping his
[59:25] boils in the backyard. I suppose with a
[59:29] piece of cockery or something scraping
[59:31] his boils that was on his body. His wife
[59:34] walked out of the door and his own wife
[59:37] looked at
[59:40] him. He said, "Why don't you curse
[59:44] God and
[59:47] die?" His own wife looked at him and
[59:49] said, "Job, you're
[59:53] pathetic. Job, you're you're
[59:56] pathetic." Oh my. All them people. That
[59:59] was that was his his brothers and his
[1:00:04] sisters. Brother Ben, be careful
[1:00:08] there. Amen. It's universal at my place,
[1:00:11] your place, every
[1:00:13] place. People is people.
[1:00:17] Amen. People is
[1:00:20] people. But sometimes your closest
[1:00:23] people are the ones that hurt you the
[1:00:25] most. That's right. But his wife looked
[1:00:29] at him and said, "You're pitiful. You're
[1:00:31] broken down. You've obviously done
[1:00:34] something.
[1:00:37] You've obviously done something to to to
[1:00:39] offend the
[1:00:41] Lord. Brother, sister, isn't it funny
[1:00:45] that how that how that when things start
[1:00:46] going wrong, all of a sudden that
[1:00:48] everybody looks at you and says, "You
[1:00:50] must be out of the will of the Lord."
[1:00:53] Well, let me tell you. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[1:00:55] You You're fighting. You're struggling.
[1:00:56] Oh, you you must be out of the will of
[1:00:58] the Lord. You You've done something. You
[1:01:02] messed up bad, Buster.
[1:01:05] you. What' you do? What are you doing
[1:01:07] behind closed door? You's messed up bad
[1:01:12] somewhere. Oh,
[1:01:14] really? Adversity doesn't always mean
[1:01:17] that you're out of the will of the Lord.
[1:01:18] Sometimes it means you're right where he
[1:01:19] wants you. You say, "Brother Ben, how
[1:01:22] can that be? Was the children of Israel
[1:01:23] out of the will of the Lord when they
[1:01:24] came out of Egypt?"
[1:01:27] Come on, somebody. No. No. They was
[1:01:29] delivered out of Egypt by the hand of
[1:01:31] the Lord. Amen. But the moment they
[1:01:33] crossed outside of the city limit sign,
[1:01:36] their trouble set in, Brother Allen.
[1:01:38] Amen. And everybody looked at Moses and
[1:01:40] said, "Oh my God, what'd you
[1:01:43] do? What' you do? Oh my, you you let us
[1:01:47] out here to to get us killed. What you
[1:01:49] done? What are you doing? Is that God
[1:01:51] talking to you, Moses?"
[1:01:55] Ain't that funny?
[1:01:58] Oh, they figured they come out by the
[1:01:59] hand of the Lord, so everything ought to
[1:02:01] be smooth sailing. Everything ought to
[1:02:03] be good. Hunky dory. No. No. They just
[1:02:05] started fighting. Come on, somebody. And
[1:02:09] you sit here today and you think, "God,
[1:02:11] I'm going through the lowest valley in
[1:02:12] my life. God, where did I leave you?"
[1:02:15] But sometimes that means you're right
[1:02:17] where God wants you.
[1:02:20] Hallelujah. Sometimes that means you're
[1:02:23] right where God wanted
[1:02:26] you. God, where you at, God? Did I Did I
[1:02:29] do this wrong? Did I do that wrong?
[1:02:31] Maybe you didn't do nothing
[1:02:32] wrong. Maybe God just told Satan, "Have
[1:02:36] you considered my servant
[1:02:39] Allan? None like him in all
[1:02:43] hearty." He says, "Praise the
[1:02:48] Lord." Makes him want to
[1:02:54] shout. This is simple. And I that's what
[1:02:56] I come to do today is just encourage you
[1:02:58] this morning. I do the work of an
[1:03:00] evangelist. This is his pulpit. He'll do
[1:03:02] all the doctrinal stuff. I don't have
[1:03:04] to. Today is my day off.
[1:03:14] Amen. But yet, whenever they came out,
[1:03:17] Amen. That's when their char their their
[1:03:19] heartache and their their struggle
[1:03:21] began. They looked at Moses. This is off
[1:03:23] my notes now. I'm just preaching for
[1:03:25] just a second. Is that okay? Amen. And
[1:03:27] they looked at Moses and they said, "Why
[1:03:28] did you It would have been better if
[1:03:29] we'd just stayed back there in sin. I
[1:03:31] mean,
[1:03:34] Egypt." You realize that the hardest
[1:03:37] you're going to fight is when you're
[1:03:38] trying to come out of sin.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Amen. That's the hardest
[1:03:45] you're going to fight when you're trying
[1:03:46] to come out of sin. Why? Because the
[1:03:48] devil wants to keep you in sin.
[1:03:52] When you're trying to come out of that
[1:03:53] garbage, Amen. The devil's going to
[1:03:55] throw everything he's got at you and
[1:03:57] he's got you wondering, "Am I doing the
[1:03:58] right thing?"
[1:04:01] Come on,
[1:04:02] church. Huh? Am I doing the right thing?
[1:04:05] Am I Am I Am I is God against me?
[1:04:09] Sometimes, let me tell you something.
[1:04:11] Whether you're being blessed or you're
[1:04:12] being uh uh uh uh uh tested, that is no
[1:04:15] sign of God's pleasure or displeasure.
[1:04:18] Many times, that's true. But here was
[1:04:22] Job. Let me get back to him just for a
[1:04:28] moment. He
[1:04:31] said, "Where did I leave? Where did I
[1:04:33] stop?" He said, "He was in the backyard
[1:04:35] scraping boils off of his body. His wife
[1:04:37] walked to the door and said, "Oh, Joe,
[1:04:39] you look so miserable. Why don't you
[1:04:40] curse God and just die?" Sometimes your
[1:04:43] own wife turns against you. Sometimes
[1:04:45] your own husband will turn against you.
[1:04:47] Sometimes your children will turn
[1:04:48] against you. But let me tell you
[1:04:49] something. You stay positive with your
[1:04:52] testimony. That's right. Anybody out
[1:04:55] there this morning? He said,
[1:04:57] "Woman, thou speakest like a foolish
[1:05:00] woman." He said, "The Lord gave and the
[1:05:02] Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of
[1:05:05] the Lord." He said, now watch. He said
[1:05:08] that man had went through trials. That
[1:05:10] man who had been
[1:05:14] purged, God was not dealing with a
[1:05:16] sinner. Now,
[1:05:20] God wasn't dealing with a sinner. Now,
[1:05:24] he was dealing with a saint.
[1:05:29] How many?
[1:05:33] God's not dealing with a sinner. You
[1:05:35] say, "Brother Ben, I sin daily, but Paul
[1:05:37] said, I die daily, too." But God don't
[1:05:40] see you the way you see you. Come on.
[1:05:42] Come on.
[1:05:43] God don't see you the way you see
[1:05:46] you. I'm thankful, brother Mike, that I
[1:05:49] God don't see me the way I see me.
[1:05:51] Because let me tell you something. If
[1:05:53] God saw me the way I see
[1:05:55] me, Amen. I was worthy of
[1:05:58] justice. But God showed me grace. I
[1:06:02] don't want There's a sign on our way to
[1:06:04] church where where some people got
[1:06:05] killed on the side of the road in a
[1:06:07] motorcycle accident. A car hit them.
[1:06:09] Brother Joel, the sign reads, this would
[1:06:11] have been about two years ago, but that
[1:06:12] court case is still going on and on, but
[1:06:14] there's a great big sign on the side of
[1:06:16] the road that said, "We deserve
[1:06:18] justice." And my mind went back to I I
[1:06:21] believe it I believe it might have been
[1:06:23] my father-in-law telling me about that.
[1:06:25] And he he said he said, "Brother Ben,"
[1:06:27] he said, "I saw that." He said, "And my
[1:06:29] mind went back to God, I don't want
[1:06:31] justice. I don't need justice, but I
[1:06:34] want grace, God. And I'm so thankful
[1:06:36] this morning that he didn't give you and
[1:06:38] I justice because you and I was worthy
[1:06:41] of death. You and I was worthy of hell.
[1:06:44] But God looked beyond our fault and he
[1:06:46] saw our need and he didn't give us
[1:06:48] justice but he gave us grace. You was
[1:06:51] worthy for hell but God came. You was
[1:06:54] worthy of a sinner's hell but God came.
[1:06:58] You was worthy to be broken down and
[1:07:00] never mended but God came. He didn't
[1:07:04] give us justice, but he gave us grace.
[1:07:06] Oh my. You want justice for your brother
[1:07:08] and your sister, but you want grace for
[1:07:10] you. I say, God, give us all grace. Oh
[1:07:14] God, I'm thankful that you became me,
[1:07:17] that I could become you, God, this is
[1:07:20] not of my own making. And God, I'm
[1:07:23] brokenhearted. But God, yet you slay me.
[1:07:26] I will serve you, God. God, out of these
[1:07:29] ashes will come something beautiful,
[1:07:32] God. I might be broken, but take this
[1:07:35] brokenness and turn it into something
[1:07:37] beautiful today. God, take my heart,
[1:07:40] Lord, and I lay it out before you. And I
[1:07:43] bleed before your throne this morning.
[1:07:45] Oh God, men me. God, make me a better
[1:07:48] believer. Make me a Christian in front
[1:07:50] of my family. Make me a Christian in
[1:07:52] front of my church. Make me a better
[1:07:54] help to my pastor. Make me a better help
[1:07:57] to the deacons. Oh, God, use me.
[1:08:06] God. There was Job on his ash heap. He
[1:08:11] found himself in such a brokenhearted
[1:08:14] place. That wasn't even of his own
[1:08:17] Tuesday. But yet he stood there and he
[1:08:20] be to scrape them boils. He was scraping
[1:08:23] them boils on his ass ash. And let me
[1:08:26] tell you something, he was in pain from
[1:08:27] his top of his head to the bottom of his
[1:08:29] feet. But he said, "I know my redeemer
[1:08:32] liveth. I know he
[1:08:37] lives.
[1:08:40] God have
[1:08:44] mercy beautifully broken. We live in
[1:08:48] such an age of
[1:08:49] brokenheartedness. You look in the media
[1:08:51] today, and I don't I don't encourage you
[1:08:53] to spend too much time in that, but but
[1:08:55] you know, I I like to know what's going
[1:08:57] on around me. But you look at the in the
[1:09:00] world today been it's it's all negative.
[1:09:02] It's all brokenness. It's all it's all
[1:09:04] despair. Amen. We live in such a an age
[1:09:07] of brokenheartedness. And I'm so
[1:09:09] thankful today, brother, sister, that
[1:09:11] you and I have a have a have a rock,
[1:09:13] have one that we can turn to in the
[1:09:16] midst of the storm. And we can say,
[1:09:18] "God, Lord, I my my shelter is in you
[1:09:21] this morning." Let me tell you
[1:09:23] something. It's It's not in It's not out
[1:09:25] here in the world crowsing around. Come
[1:09:27] on, somebody. He the devil will try to
[1:09:29] give you substitutes. Young people, the
[1:09:31] devil is always there with a substitute
[1:09:33] trying to substitute for for for the
[1:09:35] thirst of God. He'll give you this.
[1:09:37] He'll give you that. But brother,
[1:09:38] sister, let me tell you something. Amen.
[1:09:40] There you you don't turn to the things
[1:09:42] of the enemy. But turn to the things of
[1:09:44] God because in there is lasting
[1:09:46] salvation. In there is lasting peace. In
[1:09:49] there is lasting joy. In there is a is a
[1:09:52] is a is a rock in the midst of the
[1:09:54] storm. in there is
[1:09:59] salvation.
[1:10:01] Amen.
[1:10:04] Hallelujah. But Job, his own wife would
[1:10:07] turn against him in his darkest hour.
[1:10:09] And the and the members of the church
[1:10:11] would look at him and say, "Job, you've
[1:10:12] sinned somewhere. You you've you've
[1:10:14] you've broken a commandment of God. You
[1:10:16] you've gotten cold on the message." But
[1:10:18] Job hadn't done that.
[1:10:21] What a life. Maybe you haven't done
[1:10:22] that. Maybe you're still here. And you
[1:10:24] are, but you're going through it.
[1:10:28] Well, I don't know if you got the same
[1:10:30] devil in Hardy as we got in in Missouri,
[1:10:34] but maybe maybe y'all have halos up
[1:10:37] here. I don't
[1:10:40] know. Problem with the halo is sometimes
[1:10:42] it gets stuck on your
[1:10:49] horns. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:10:55] Yeah, they're all the
[1:10:56] same here and
[1:10:59] there. Amen. Sometimes you got to
[1:11:02] lighten them up a
[1:11:04] little. That's okay. This is just what
[1:11:07] the Lord put on my heart and I just I
[1:11:09] don't know why, but I I couldn't get
[1:11:10] away from it. I He put it on me about a
[1:11:13] little over a week ago and I just
[1:11:14] started it just started going over in me
[1:11:16] and and so I just I went with it. Yeah.
[1:11:21] He said, "Now God was not dealing with a
[1:11:23] sinner. Now he was dealing with a saint,
[1:11:26] a man that had been purged by the by by
[1:11:29] the purged by God, proving to Satan that
[1:11:33] there was mortals who would serve him in
[1:11:35] the face of conflicts. There was
[1:11:38] mortals. He was see God was proving
[1:11:40] something to Satan. He was proving
[1:11:43] something to the devil." Let me tell you
[1:11:44] something, church. Amen. In the day when
[1:11:46] there's men walking away from this
[1:11:48] message at w record pace, God's proving
[1:11:51] to the devil that there's still a bride
[1:11:52] that'll stand in this hour. There's
[1:11:54] still a bride in this age. There's still
[1:11:56] a bride without spot and without
[1:11:57] wrinkle. And she's never going to walk
[1:11:59] away. She's never going to start
[1:12:01] questioning, brother, sister. But she's
[1:12:03] going to stand firm in the word in this
[1:12:05] hour. Let me tell you something. Outside
[1:12:07] of the word in this day, brother Joel,
[1:12:09] there is no perfection. But inside of
[1:12:11] this word, Amen. It is the perfecting of
[1:12:14] the bride.
[1:12:16] They've done everything. Come on,
[1:12:17] somebody. They've done everything to
[1:12:19] attack.
[1:12:21] Now, I'm not getting off in that. I'm
[1:12:22] just going to be real broad and he can
[1:12:24] deal with it. But they've done
[1:12:25] everything to attack. Amen. The
[1:12:27] perfecting of the saints.
[1:12:30] But I want to tell you something in this
[1:12:32] last day. Amen. You got to stand boldly
[1:12:35] and you got to stand in the face of
[1:12:36] conflict. And you've got to stand there
[1:12:38] and say, "It doesn't matter what the
[1:12:40] world says. It doesn't matter if my
[1:12:42] brother falls off or my sister falls
[1:12:43] off. God, yet you slay me, though you
[1:12:46] slay me, yet I'll serve you, Lord. He
[1:12:49] said he was proving to Satan that God
[1:12:50] there was a people who would serve him
[1:12:52] in the face of conflict. He said, "Thou
[1:12:54] speakest like a foolish woman." Now, he
[1:12:55] never said she was foolish. He said,
[1:12:57] "She just spoke like a foolish woman.
[1:12:59] The Lord gave and the Lord taketh away.
[1:13:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Here
[1:13:03] come these fine counselors and church
[1:13:04] members. Job cursed the day that he was
[1:13:06] born." He said, "May the stars not shine
[1:13:09] nor and at the night and the sun by
[1:13:11] day." But he wouldn't curse God. And
[1:13:13] there Satan got him right down there to
[1:13:15] the very threadbear moment. Let me tell
[1:13:18] you something. You may be in your
[1:13:19] threadbear moment, but I want to tell
[1:13:21] you that God has never left you. And
[1:13:23] he'll never forsake
[1:13:28] you. You may be in your threadbear
[1:13:31] moment. You may be in the darkest hour.
[1:13:33] But that's when Jesus comes showing up.
[1:13:37] When Peter was out on the out on the
[1:13:39] water. Amen. And and in the darkest
[1:13:41] hour, the disciples out there, it looked
[1:13:43] as though hell was going to sink them.
[1:13:45] But out on the water, they looked up and
[1:13:47] Joe, here come Jesus walking on the
[1:13:49] water. At that moment when they were the
[1:13:51] most broken, at that moment when they
[1:13:53] were the most defeated, they looked up
[1:13:56] and there Jesus came a call and they
[1:13:58] looked and they said, "Oh God, I'm
[1:14:00] scared to death." But yet G Peter looked
[1:14:03] and said, "Jesus, if it be you, bid me
[1:14:05] to come." And he said, "Come on out of
[1:14:07] the boat, Peter. Come on out of the
[1:14:09] boat." And Peter jumped out of the boat
[1:14:11] and that water begin to take body
[1:14:13] underneath him. And let me tell you
[1:14:15] something. When you'll step outside of
[1:14:18] your problem and your circumstance and
[1:14:20] you'll step out of the boat by faith,
[1:14:22] God will cause the water to have body.
[1:14:25] Hallelujah. God will cause the water to
[1:14:28] have body underneath you and you'll walk
[1:14:30] over the top of your ashes.
[1:14:34] He said, "Come on, Peter." So Peter
[1:14:36] jumped out and all of last time I tried
[1:14:39] to step on
[1:14:42] water didn't work too
[1:14:49] hot. If you walking on water, I want to
[1:14:55] watch cuz we ain't never seen a show
[1:14:57] like
[1:15:00] that. Come on. But Peter stepped out of
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:06] boat and all of a sudden, look, in the
[1:15:09] midst of Peter's miracle, I'm just off
[1:15:11] now. I'm just That's okay. In the midst
[1:15:15] of Peter's
[1:15:16] miracle, Peter was walking in the middle
[1:15:19] of his miracle.
[1:15:22] And the devil begin to begin to cause
[1:15:24] this to arise and that to arise, this
[1:15:27] church problem and that family problem
[1:15:29] and this over here. And Peter took his
[1:15:32] eyes off of Christ. You understand that
[1:15:35] all of these things that's going on
[1:15:37] around you, they are designed to do one
[1:15:38] thing, and that is simply to take your
[1:15:41] eyes off of Christ. It is simply to take
[1:15:44] your eyes off of what really matters and
[1:15:46] get a turn toward your brother and your
[1:15:47] sister. Let me tell you something. And
[1:15:49] that one sitting beside you is not your
[1:15:51] enemy. That one sitting in front of you
[1:15:54] is not your enemy, but it is the devil.
[1:15:59] It is the devil.
[1:16:06] But in the midst of Peter's miracle, he
[1:16:08] was walking on the water and all of a
[1:16:10] sudden, can you imagine that? Literally,
[1:16:12] he was standing there walking on the
[1:16:13] water and he took his eyes off and in
[1:16:15] the midst of a miracle, he began to
[1:16:16] doubt.
[1:16:19] Right in the middle of his
[1:16:21] miracle, the devil was
[1:16:25] present. Oh, think about that just a
[1:16:28] minute. I'm just off now. Okay. But
[1:16:30] right in the middle of his miracle, the
[1:16:32] devil was still
[1:16:34] present. And all of a sudden, he took
[1:16:36] his eyes off and and he began to seek
[1:16:38] and he said, "God, help me." And my
[1:16:42] Bible said immediately,
[1:16:47] not five minutes, not six
[1:16:49] seconds, but immediately, Brother Joel,
[1:16:53] Christ reached out his hand,
[1:16:56] Christ reached out his hand and he
[1:16:58] grabbed a hold of him and he lifted him
[1:17:00] back up
[1:17:03] and he said, "Oh, Peter, why did you
[1:17:08] doubt? Why did you doubt me, Peter?
[1:17:11] right in the middle of your miracle.
[1:17:13] Peter, if you'd have just stayed if you
[1:17:14] would have just stayed focused on what's
[1:17:16] important. Peter, if you would have got
[1:17:18] your eyes off on this or your eyes off
[1:17:20] on that, Peter, if you'd have just
[1:17:22] stayed focused,
[1:17:29] it's I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
[1:17:31] this morning.
[1:17:41] And immediately he reached his hand out
[1:17:45] and he picked him
[1:17:48] up. Peter,
[1:17:51] why did I not
[1:17:57] doubt? Let me get back to this a minute.
[1:18:00] I'm sorry. I get to I get to preach and
[1:18:03] I go down this trail and I go down that
[1:18:05] trail.
[1:18:07] It's just the way God made me. I can't
[1:18:09] be them and they certainly can't be
[1:18:15] me. He
[1:18:18] said all them counselors, he said, came
[1:18:21] to him. He cursed the day that he was
[1:18:22] born, but he wouldn't curse God. And
[1:18:25] there Satan got him into the threadbear
[1:18:26] moment. He said, then some of his
[1:18:28] friends came and instead of counseling
[1:18:30] him, they accused him.
[1:18:33] Instead of counseling him, they accused
[1:18:36] him of being a secret sinner. Let me
[1:18:38] tell you something. Can I go? How do you
[1:18:44] know? That's always makes me nervous,
[1:18:46] too, brother Ben. The preacher looks at
[1:18:48] me and says, "Can I go?" And I'm sitting
[1:18:49] there going, "I think I think you
[1:18:54] can."
[1:18:56] Amen. Now, I lost my
[1:19:00] thought. Amen.
[1:19:02] But instead of accusing, instead of
[1:19:04] counseling him, they accused him. And
[1:19:07] let me tell you something. There it is.
[1:19:09] Let me tell you something. A lot of
[1:19:11] times you'll accuse everybody around
[1:19:13] you. But if your life was to be made
[1:19:15] known,
[1:19:20] come on, somebody. If your life was to
[1:19:22] be made known, you know the difference
[1:19:23] between that person next to you and the
[1:19:25] and you. The difference is is their life
[1:19:27] was made known and yours hadn't been
[1:19:28] yet.
[1:19:32] Come on. That's right up next to us. And
[1:19:34] it just goes for me, too. That's all of
[1:19:36] us. Amen. You know, some of us, Amen. We
[1:19:38] want what? Law for everybody
[1:19:41] else. But praise God. Give me
[1:19:44] grace. Let me tell you something. It's
[1:19:47] by grace and grace alone that any of us
[1:19:49] in this building are going to make it.
[1:19:51] It ain't because any of us could live by
[1:19:53] the law. Because let me tell you
[1:19:54] something. If you could live by the law,
[1:19:56] you didn't need Jesus.
[1:19:58] Come on, somebody. He said Christ was
[1:20:00] the fulfillment of the law. Now that
[1:20:02] don't give you a license to go live any
[1:20:04] life of
[1:20:05] sin that you can. Come on somebody.
[1:20:08] Amen. But you understand many of them
[1:20:10] will say well I'm under grace. Bless God
[1:20:11] I can do whatever I want. That shows me
[1:20:13] that you ain't got it. Because let me
[1:20:16] tell you brother said he said God have
[1:20:18] mercy. Brother said that you are
[1:20:19] reflecting here what you are somewhere
[1:20:21] else. So let me tell you you by their
[1:20:23] fruits. Jesus said by their fruits you
[1:20:26] shall know them. Look I'm not no judge.
[1:20:29] I just inspect a little fruit every now
[1:20:30] and again.
[1:20:33] If it is, if it if it if it's round like
[1:20:35] an apple, it red like an apple, it
[1:20:37] tastes like an apple, it might be an
[1:20:38] apple.
[1:20:42] I got a saying at home. If it looks like
[1:20:44] a duck, it swims like a duck, it quacks
[1:20:46] like a duck, it acts like a duck, it
[1:20:48] might be a duck.
[1:20:56] But you can look and you can say,
[1:20:59] "Well, I believe this message. I believe
[1:21:01] in predestination. So do
[1:21:04] I. But I believe that I'm predestinated
[1:21:07] to the life of Christ."
[1:21:10] Come on, somebody. Now, there's the
[1:21:12] difference right there. Amen. Because
[1:21:14] the life of Christ is going to produce
[1:21:15] Christ.
[1:21:17] That's right. You're predestinated to
[1:21:19] something. I'm just going to touch the
[1:21:20] highlight here and move on back over to
[1:21:21] Job. But you understand that you're
[1:21:23] going to produce something and you'll
[1:21:25] produce that that you are. That's right.
[1:21:28] You say, "Well, praise God. Let me move
[1:21:30] on. I feel
[1:21:34] that he said he said the friends come
[1:21:36] instead of counseling them, accused him,
[1:21:39] counseling him, they accused him of
[1:21:40] being a secret sinner." Like they might
[1:21:41] accuse this woman here in the wheelchair
[1:21:43] or the young man there in the bed, that
[1:21:45] little child, the father
[1:21:47] standing there maybe being a secret
[1:21:49] sinner. He said some something you've
[1:21:52] done. He said that's not always the
[1:21:54] case. Jesus said one time to the
[1:21:56] disciple or one time the disciples he
[1:21:58] said they said who sinned the blind man
[1:22:01] he or his father or his mother. He said
[1:22:04] in this case neither of them sin but
[1:22:07] that the glory the works of God might be
[1:22:09] made manifest. You might be in the midst
[1:22:11] of this stronger storm but it may not be
[1:22:13] because of anything that you've done.
[1:22:15] But it might be that God is just through
[1:22:18] going to show the glory of God through
[1:22:20] your life. It might be that God needed
[1:22:23] needed to show Satan that there was
[1:22:25] somebody in this hour that would stand
[1:22:27] in the midst of the storm. He said Job
[1:22:29] had not sinned. He knew he hadn't
[1:22:30] sinned. He had not sinned. So he would
[1:22:32] not confess it because he had absolutely
[1:22:35] hadn't sinned. But God was really trying
[1:22:39] him. He was putting him to a test. I
[1:22:42] believe that every Christian that's born
[1:22:43] again has got to be has has to go
[1:22:47] through the test. Every son that cometh
[1:22:49] to God must be chasened and purged. He
[1:22:51] said, "Is that right?" He said, "If you
[1:22:53] cannot stand chastisement of the Lord,
[1:22:55] then you become a bastard or
[1:22:56] illegitimate child. You claim God to be
[1:22:59] your father and you know nothing of him.
[1:23:01] A real true born again child of God
[1:23:03] stands firm." We said we are sowed with
[1:23:06] the incorruptible seed of God.
[1:23:09] He said, "We're sowed with the
[1:23:11] incorruptible seed of God." So if you're
[1:23:14] sowed with the incorruptible seed of
[1:23:15] God, it's going to produce Christ in
[1:23:18] this hour.
[1:23:21] Come on.
[1:23:25] I'm having a great time.
[1:23:34] They said incrup your s incruptible. I
[1:23:37] know I'm reading a lot. Forgive me. He
[1:23:39] said it cannot perish. Oh my. Now, if
[1:23:42] you go, he said, you'll go up, you go
[1:23:44] through your ups and downs. I would
[1:23:45] advise you to go to God. He said, stay
[1:23:48] there until you're really born again.
[1:23:51] The problem is is we just get them to an
[1:23:53] emotion.
[1:23:56] We just get them to
[1:23:58] shout. I believe in shouting. I believe
[1:24:01] in it. Come on, somebody. I believe in
[1:24:03] shouting. I believe in a good cry. I
[1:24:05] believe in coming to an altar, brother,
[1:24:07] and just and just struggling it out with
[1:24:09] the Lord. I believe in that. I like to
[1:24:11] see it. But let me tell you something.
[1:24:12] This brother sitting right here in his
[1:24:14] chair chair can get it just like that
[1:24:16] one sitting right here. Come on,
[1:24:18] somebody. We put too much on emotion
[1:24:20] many times though. I believe that
[1:24:22] anything without emotion, it's plum
[1:24:25] dead.
[1:24:27] You know, they they say, "Well, there
[1:24:29] not be there there better not be a lot
[1:24:30] of carrying on. There better not be a
[1:24:32] lot of excitement. There be a lot lot of
[1:24:34] shouting. Come on, somebody. Let me tell
[1:24:36] you something. I didn't come to no morg
[1:24:39] this morning.
[1:24:40] I didn't come to no funeral home. Amen.
[1:24:43] I come to a place where there ought to
[1:24:45] be a joy. There ought to be a shout.
[1:24:47] There ought to be the joy of the
[1:24:49] salvation of the Lord. You've got
[1:24:50] something to be pray raising about.
[1:24:53] You've got something to be happy about.
[1:24:55] Oh, but praise God, the church is the
[1:24:57] place we ought to be the
[1:24:58] quietest. Be
[1:25:01] still and know.
[1:25:05] I
[1:25:06] am God.
[1:25:12] Praise the
[1:25:17] Lord. Is it all right if I just have
[1:25:19] good time this morning? I'm just
[1:25:21] preaching. I don't know y'all that real
[1:25:23] well. Really? I know him real
[1:25:25] well. Better than I want to.
[1:25:32] Amen. He does me
[1:25:36] too. Be still and know that I am God. So
[1:25:41] we come in
[1:25:53] and that same hypocrite goes out here to
[1:25:55] the ball game.
[1:25:58] Brother, can I preach just a minute?
[1:26:00] Amen. I do this at home, too. I'm just
[1:26:02] I'm feeling pretty comfortable at the
[1:26:03] moment, if you can't
[1:26:05] tell.
[1:26:07] Amen. Amen. But, but that same
[1:26:09] hypocrite, Amen, will go out there and
[1:26:11] and little Johnny, they'll be at live
[1:26:13] little league. And brother Joel, you
[1:26:14] might just be It might look like the
[1:26:16] cat's got your tongue right here in
[1:26:18] church, but little old little old
[1:26:19] Johnny, he hits a
[1:26:21] he about 20 feet in front of him. Yeah.
[1:26:25] Run, Johnny. Run.
[1:26:27] run. And I'm sitting there going,
[1:26:29] "Praise
[1:26:32] God." Boy, if we ever get him filled
[1:26:34] with the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost. Oh man, I'm going to get hate
[1:26:43] mail. Amen. But you know that that they
[1:26:46] they'll go out there and and and and and
[1:26:49] they'll throw that pig skin around the
[1:26:51] around down that that field and oh my
[1:26:53] oh, they'll paint their chest red and
[1:26:55] yellow and everything else. They'll
[1:26:57] stand up there and they'll beat that old
[1:26:58] chest. Say, "Yeah, run, run, run." And a
[1:27:01] sinner weeps their way to Christ and
[1:27:03] they set down on them. Let me tell you
[1:27:05] something. There ought to be a believer
[1:27:07] somewhere that stands there and says,
[1:27:09] "Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Fill
[1:27:11] them up, Lord. Be their portion, Lord.
[1:27:14] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord." Amen. But
[1:27:17] I tell you, you've got something to
[1:27:19] shout about. You've got something to
[1:27:20] praise to God about. But yet, God, the
[1:27:23] devil will sit there and he'll set on
[1:27:25] your praise. He'll sit on your worship.
[1:27:27] He ain't going to sit on me, brother
[1:27:29] sister, but I'm going to defy him and
[1:27:31] I'm going to tell him though that though
[1:27:33] you slay me, Lord, yet I serve you,
[1:27:35] Lord, I might be in my brokest moment,
[1:27:38] but God, I'm going to praise you anyhow.
[1:27:43] Oh, they'll get up there and they'll
[1:27:44] they'll act like the devil himself and
[1:27:46] paint their chest red and orange and
[1:27:48] whatever else is a devilish
[1:27:52] color. And then they'll tell me I'm too
[1:27:54] rowdy, Brother Joel.
[1:27:58] I'm gonna video them. Come on,
[1:28:01] somebody. Then I'm going to put it on a
[1:28:03] continual loop on my
[1:28:05] church. Come on. Come on. Get real,
[1:28:09] though. Seriously, just think about that
[1:28:10] a minute. Think about the way the devil
[1:28:12] has done us.
[1:28:15] But now you sit here and you believe
[1:28:17] you. We've got the revealed word of this
[1:28:18] hour. Not a not a mystery no longer.
[1:28:22] Come on. Come on, somebody. It's not a
[1:28:25] mystery now in this hour. It was a
[1:28:26] mystery before a prophet. But now we've
[1:28:29] had a prophet come in this hour. And no
[1:28:31] longer is it a mystery, but now Christ
[1:28:34] lays before you bear.
[1:28:37] Hallelujah. Now Christ stands there
[1:28:39] before you bear. It's no longer a
[1:28:41] mystery.
[1:28:43] They say, "Oh, I'm going to preach to
[1:28:44] you this great big deep hidden mystery."
[1:28:46] Let me tell you something that makes me
[1:28:47] scared.
[1:28:51] Them men that'll come to the pulpit. Oh
[1:28:52] my. I'm going to You've never seen this
[1:28:54] before. All right,
[1:28:58] buddy. Amen. Let's sing and take the
[1:29:00] name of Jesus with
[1:29:03] you. Come on, somebody. I don't go for
[1:29:06] that garbage.
[1:29:08] Come on. You You You in my pulpit, you
[1:29:11] better say what he said.
[1:29:14] How am I doing, brother Ben? Amen. I can
[1:29:17] say this because I know him.
[1:29:21] Amen. You You better say what he said.
[1:29:24] I'm not interested in your private
[1:29:25] interpretation. I'm not interested in
[1:29:27] your revelation. Come on, somebody. I
[1:29:29] had a messenger in my hour. That seventh
[1:29:32] angel messenger came down and last I
[1:29:34] checked, the word come to the prophets.
[1:29:37] Where's that leave you?
[1:29:40] Where's that leave me? Come on,
[1:29:42] somebody. I'm right there with you. When
[1:29:43] I say you, that means me, too. Where's
[1:29:45] that leave me? Amen, brother sister. I
[1:29:47] don't have no deep revelation. I don't
[1:29:49] have nothing. Amen. That that that's
[1:29:51] new. There's nothing new under the sun,
[1:29:52] brother, sister. You understand? I
[1:29:54] wouldn't know what I know, brother Mike.
[1:29:56] Had it not been for a prophet messenger
[1:29:58] to come in our hour and to reveal, Amen.
[1:30:01] And to reveal the word of God in this
[1:30:03] hour. I wouldn't know. This Bible would
[1:30:05] be a dead letter. Come on, somebody.
[1:30:08] They say, "Oh, we don't need a prophet.
[1:30:10] We just need this." You don't even know
[1:30:12] what this says. Come on. Come on. You
[1:30:15] don't even know what this says without a
[1:30:16] prophet in this hour.
[1:30:20] You don't even know if I want to go from
[1:30:21] here, Amen. to to to Murphy'sboro,
[1:30:24] Tennessee. I don't know how to get there
[1:30:26] without a road map to take me there.
[1:30:31] I don't know how to get there, brother
[1:30:33] Jo, without looking at a road map or one
[1:30:35] of them dumb GPS's.
[1:30:37] I was, you know, them GPS's will lead
[1:30:39] you wrong sometimes. I was in Tennessee,
[1:30:42] as a matter of fact, here years ago, my
[1:30:44] wife and my mom and dad and I and my
[1:30:46] little baby at the time, who's 18 years
[1:30:48] old. I don't know how that happened, but
[1:30:49] it
[1:30:52] did. We was driving along about 1:00 in
[1:30:54] the morning. My GPS, we was trying to
[1:30:57] find our room, and I'm
[1:31:00] quitting. That clock tells me I'm
[1:31:04] quitting. Amen. But that GPS, it started
[1:31:07] Amen. It it it it it it says turn here
[1:31:10] and turn there and it's it's it's late
[1:31:11] in the early in the morning, we hours of
[1:31:13] the morning and I and I I take off down
[1:31:15] this road and and I'm just trucking
[1:31:17] right on down this road and all of a
[1:31:19] sudden the headlights light up a body of
[1:31:21] water. It was taking me down a boat
[1:31:25] ramp. Dad's sitting in the back in the
[1:31:27] passenger seat going, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:31:30] whoa." And I'm sitting there going,
[1:31:32] "Whoa, whoa, whoa." Amen. But that GPS
[1:31:36] will lead you lead you wrong. That woman
[1:31:37] didn't know where she was
[1:31:39] going. Don't never take direction from a
[1:31:43] woman. Amen. There's some men can't get
[1:31:47] no directions either. So, you ain't no
[1:31:48] angel. Amen. But but but but but let me
[1:31:52] tell you, you don't know what you don't
[1:31:54] know where you're going if you ain't got
[1:31:55] a map. Amen. And they'll say, "Oh, we're
[1:31:58] beyond the prophet now." No, you're
[1:32:00] never going to be beyond the prophet.
[1:32:02] Come on, somebody. You're never going to
[1:32:03] be higher than the seventh church age
[1:32:05] messenger in this hour. You're never
[1:32:06] going to be beyond what he Come on,
[1:32:08] somebody. Beyond what he preached.
[1:32:11] That's right.
[1:32:14] Praise God.
[1:32:19] So many weird things out there, ain't
[1:32:21] there?
[1:32:24] There I go.
[1:32:27] Let me read this and I'm quitting.
[1:32:33] He
[1:32:35] said Job hadn't sinned, so he wouldn't
[1:32:37] confess it, but God was really trying
[1:32:39] him to put him to the test. And I
[1:32:41] believe every Christian that's
[1:32:44] purged. Let me drop down. I've already
[1:32:46] read that. He said, "You may go through
[1:32:48] your ups and downs, your
[1:32:48] disappointments." He said, "Something
[1:32:51] holds. Not you holding, something
[1:32:53] holding you." It isn't a question
[1:32:55] whether I hold on or not. It's a
[1:32:58] question or whether he held on or on or
[1:33:01] not. Oh, aren't you grateful for that
[1:33:02] this morning, church? It isn't looking
[1:33:05] at me. Listen to this. It isn't looking
[1:33:07] at
[1:33:08] me. It isn't It isn't looking at me.
[1:33:12] It's looking at him.
[1:33:15] It's looking at him. He was the one. He
[1:33:18] said, "A man came here not long ago and
[1:33:20] said, "Brother Brandon, I'm not worthy
[1:33:21] to be saved." He said, "No, you're not."
[1:33:26] And he started weeping. He said, 'I've
[1:33:28] tried since 1940 to get saved.' He said,
[1:33:31] 'But I find myself not worthy.' I said,
[1:33:33] 'You never will be
[1:33:35] worthy.' He said, ' Then I can never be
[1:33:38] saved. I said, oh no, it isn't you.
[1:33:44] It isn't you, it's him. He said, God
[1:33:48] don't look at you.
[1:33:50] He looks at him, brother, sister. You
[1:33:54] could never be worthy. But God never
[1:33:57] looked at that man you were looking at
[1:33:59] in the mirror this morning. But he
[1:34:01] looked to himself. He looked at the
[1:34:04] perfect sacrifice. He said he looks at
[1:34:06] him. He said, "And if you can find any
[1:34:08] fault in him."
[1:34:12] If you can find any fault in him, then
[1:34:15] there's fault in you.
[1:34:18] He said, "But there's no fault in him.
[1:34:22] then you'll be all right.
[1:34:25] Hallelujah. That devil that tells you
[1:34:27] you're never going to make it, there's
[1:34:29] no fault in Christ, devil. All that I
[1:34:32] every sin that I ever had was placed on
[1:34:36] Christ.
[1:34:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may have
[1:34:42] broke me down, but now God has taken my
[1:34:44] life. Let me tell you something,
[1:34:45] brother, sister. If you knew me before I
[1:34:47] knew him, if you knew me before I knew
[1:34:51] him, you would see a life that was
[1:34:53] broken. You would see a young man that
[1:34:55] was running down a road to hell.
[1:34:57] But one day, brother Joel, one day, God
[1:35:01] reached down and caught me in that pit.
[1:35:04] And he reached down and he caught me and
[1:35:06] he said, "You're mine.
[1:35:09] Not because I was good. Not because I
[1:35:11] was worthy, but because he was looking
[1:35:14] to himself.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. He said, and he started
[1:35:23] weeping. He said, I've been trying since
[1:35:25] 1944. He said, I and I never, he said,
[1:35:28] he said, you're never going to be
[1:35:29] worthy. He said, I never can be saved.
[1:35:31] He said, he isn't looking at you. It's
[1:35:33] him. God don't look at you. He looks at
[1:35:36] him. And if you find any fault in him,
[1:35:38] then you can't be saved. But if there's
[1:35:40] no fault in him, then you're all right.
[1:35:44] The blemish that you find in him is on
[1:35:46] you. But if there's no blemish in him,
[1:35:49] then there's no blemish in you.
[1:35:52] Hallelujah. If there's no blemish in
[1:35:55] Christ, there's no blemish in you.
[1:36:00] He never looked to you, but he looked to
[1:36:03] himself.
[1:36:05] Hallelujah.
[1:36:07] You say, "I'm worthless. I'm broken.
[1:36:10] I'll never amount to
[1:36:12] anything. One time there was an old
[1:36:16] violin. It says it was the touch of the
[1:36:20] master's hand said was battered in scar
[1:36:23] and the auctioneer thought it would
[1:36:24] hardly work hardly worth its while to
[1:36:28] waste his time on the old violin. But he
[1:36:30] held it up with a
[1:36:32] smile. What am I bid good people? He
[1:36:35] cried. Who starts the bidding for me?
[1:36:38] One dollar. $1. Do I hear two? $2. Who
[1:36:41] makes it three? $3 once. $3 twice. Going
[1:36:45] for
[1:36:46] three. But no. From the room far back of
[1:36:50] a gray bearded man. He came forward. He
[1:36:54] picked up the bow. Then wiping the dust
[1:36:56] from the old
[1:36:57] violin. He tightened up the strings. He
[1:37:00] played a melody. A melody pure and
[1:37:03] sweet. As sweet as the angel sings. The
[1:37:07] music ceased and the auctioneer with a
[1:37:09] voice that was quiet and low said, "What
[1:37:12] now am I bid for this whole
[1:37:15] violin as he held it a loft with its
[1:37:18] bow? 1,000 1,000 do I hear
[1:37:22] to 2,000? Who makes it three? 3,000 once
[1:37:27] 3,000 twice going gone?" said he.
[1:37:33] The audience cheered, but some of them
[1:37:36] cried. We just don't understand what
[1:37:39] changed its
[1:37:41] worth. Swift came the reply. It was the
[1:37:45] touch of the master's
[1:37:47] hand. And many a man's
[1:37:49] life out of tune, all battered and
[1:37:53] bruised with
[1:37:54] hardship, is auction cheap to a
[1:37:57] thoughtless crowd, much like that old
[1:37:59] violin.
[1:38:01] A mass of a mess of pottage, a glass of
[1:38:03] wine, a game, and he travels on. He is
[1:38:08] going once, he is going twice. He is
[1:38:12] going and almost
[1:38:14] gone. But the master comes along and the
[1:38:17] foolish crowd never can quite understand
[1:38:20] the worth of the soul and the change
[1:38:23] that is wrought by the touch of the
[1:38:26] master's hand. And brother, sister, let
[1:38:29] me tell you something. When Christ comes
[1:38:30] into your
[1:38:32] story, when Christ comes down into the
[1:38:34] brokenness of your
[1:38:36] life and he reaches down and he puts you
[1:38:38] back
[1:38:39] together, you went from a worthless
[1:38:41] nothing to something that was
[1:38:44] invaluable. One soul is worth 10,000
[1:38:47] worlds.
[1:38:51] Never
[1:38:53] ever
[1:38:54] think that you are beyond
[1:39:00] repair. Psalm 34:18 says, "The Lord is
[1:39:04] nigh unto them that are of a broken
[1:39:07] heart, and saveth
[1:39:09] such as be a contrite
[1:39:12] spirit."
[1:39:15] Amen. Don't you love him this morning?
[1:39:18] stand this morning. Whoever is taking
[1:39:20] the service,
[1:39:21] come. Let's
[1:39:31] pray. Most gracious, kind heavenly
[1:39:37] father, oh God, how I love you so much,
[1:39:42] Lord. I thank you for your grace, Lord,
[1:39:45] and your mercy, Lord.
[1:39:49] I thank you, Lord, that you looked
[1:39:51] beyond my fault, Lord, and you saw my
[1:39:53] need,
[1:39:57] Lord. Lord, I ask, Father, that Lord,
[1:40:00] you'd take this broken up message this
[1:40:01] morning, Lord, as as Lord, it's so
[1:40:03] burned in my soul, Lord, for the past
[1:40:05] several
[1:40:08] days, God, as I was studying, Lord, how
[1:40:11] you just stepped down, Lord, and you
[1:40:12] just you came so near, Lord. I thank you
[1:40:15] for that, God.
[1:40:17] Lord, I thank you, Father, for coming
[1:40:18] and walking up and down the corridors of
[1:40:20] our hearts this morning, Lord. And God,
[1:40:23] reminding us, Lord,
[1:40:25] that that
[1:40:28] God though we may be broken,
[1:40:32] Lord. Lord, we're just, Lord,
[1:40:34] beautifully broken this morning, Lord.
[1:40:37] God, we're never too broken. But what
[1:40:40] Lord, you can't put us together in a
[1:40:41] beautiful way, Lord.
[1:40:47] God, thou alone are worthy,
[1:40:50] Lord. So God, I give this people to you
[1:40:54] now. I ask you, Lord, to just move among
[1:40:58] them, Lord, this
[1:41:00] morning. Lord, take the despondent
[1:41:03] heart, Lord, dear God, and turn it
[1:41:04] toward toward to toward you this
[1:41:07] morning, Lord. The one, Father, the
[1:41:10] enemy maybe said, "Well, you've gone too
[1:41:12] far. You you're never going to be
[1:41:14] mended. You're never Lord, would you
[1:41:16] just go down right to him right now,
[1:41:18] Lord? Make yourself known in a special
[1:41:21] way this morning, Lord. Lord, if there's
[1:41:23] a sick one among us, Lord, may the may
[1:41:25] the great physician, Lord, pass by the
[1:41:27] way,
[1:41:28] Lord, and God, put them together once
[1:41:31] more, Lord. I'm so thankful, Lord, this
[1:41:34] morning. You didn't throw the clay away,
[1:41:36] Lord.
[1:41:38] God, I was broken, Lord, but yet God,
[1:41:42] you picked up all the pieces, Lord,
[1:41:45] and and you remembered
[1:41:48] again. Oh Lord, I love you this morning.
[1:41:51] We worship you this morning, Lord. We
[1:41:53] give you praise and we give you honor
[1:41:55] and we give you glory this morning,
[1:41:57] Lord. God, we may stand, Lord, as Job
[1:42:00] did on that ash sheep, Lord, scraping
[1:42:02] our boils as it were. But God, I know,
[1:42:04] Lord, my redeemer. He liveth
[1:42:07] today. Oh, I love you,
[1:42:10] Lord. How great you are this morning,
[1:42:15] Lord. I commit these people, Lord, into
[1:42:18] thy hands,
[1:42:19] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:42:24] Amen. Oh. Oh.
[1:42:28] and
[1:42:30] over heolds me.
[1:42:35] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:38] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:41] Thank you, Lord. He fashioned fashioned
[1:42:45] this old
[1:42:49] clay
[1:42:52] vessel of
[1:42:57] you need prayer this morning. This altar
[1:42:59] is open to you this morning. And it's
[1:43:02] all because
[1:43:05] Jesus didn't
[1:43:07] throw the clay away.
[1:43:14] singing
[1:43:16] over and
[1:43:19] over. He molds
[1:43:21] me and he makes
[1:43:25] me
[1:43:27] into his likeness.
[1:43:31] He
[1:43:32] fashions the
[1:43:38] clay. A
[1:43:40] vessel of
[1:43:44] honor I
[1:43:46] am
[1:43:48] today. And it's all because
[1:43:54] Jesus didn't
[1:43:56] throw the clay away.
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:05] Empty and
[1:44:07] broken. I came back to
[1:44:13] him. A
[1:44:15] vessel
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:19] unworthy, so
[1:44:21] scarred by
[1:44:24] sin. But he did
[1:44:26] not despair.
[1:44:29] He started
[1:44:32] over again.
[1:44:35] And I bless the
[1:44:39] day. He didn't throw the clay
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] away. Oh, we're singing
[1:44:50] over and over.
[1:44:54] He molds
[1:44:56] me and makes
[1:44:59] me
[1:45:01] into his
[1:45:04] likeness. He
[1:45:06] fashions the
[1:45:11] clay. A
[1:45:14] vessel of
[1:45:17] honor I
[1:45:20] am today.
[1:45:23] And it's all because
[1:45:27] Jesus didn't
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:34] grow. Oh, I'm glad that
[1:45:39] mercy
[1:45:41] rro my life. Can we just worship them
[1:45:45] for a moment now? I'm glad that
[1:45:50] mercy
[1:45:52] rules my
[1:45:56] life. Oh yes, I
[1:46:00] should should have
[1:46:03] fallen. My
[1:46:05] soul cast
[1:46:08] down but
[1:46:11] mercy rero.
[1:46:15] Oh, sing it like you mean it this
[1:46:16] morning. Aren't you glad for his mercy?
[1:46:19] Oh, your
[1:46:22] mercy
[1:46:24] re my
[1:46:29] life. It was God's
[1:46:32] mercy that
[1:46:35] rro my
[1:46:38] life. Oh yes it was. Oh, I
[1:46:43] should have
[1:46:45] fallen my
[1:46:48] soul. Cast
[1:46:51] down, but
[1:46:54] mercy
[1:46:57] re my
[1:46:59] life. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[1:47:01] of praise this morning? Amen. Did you
[1:47:04] enjoy the word of the Lord? Amen. Give
[1:47:06] me a key of C.
[1:47:09] All I want to do is love
[1:47:11] him. Well, all I want to do is love
[1:47:17] him. I'm so glad I feel his love for
[1:47:24] me. Jesus paid the price of
[1:47:30] redemption on the cross of
[1:47:34] Calary. Let's praise him now. Oh, so
[1:47:38] every day my heart will praise
[1:47:42] him. Oh, I know I'll never be the
[1:47:49] same. And all I want to do is love him.

[1:48:46] Love his
[1:48:50] holy
[1:48:52] name. Give the Lord one more hand clap
[1:48:54] of
[1:48:55] praise. And
[1:48:58] and he's ready to come. I'm ready to go.
[1:49:00] We're going to sing this one as you go.
[1:49:02] Don't forget service this afternoon at
[1:49:03] 3:00. God bless you. Amen. Did you enjoy
[1:49:06] the word of the Lord this morning? Can
[1:49:07] you give the Lord a big hand clap of
[1:49:11] praise? And he's ready to come. I'm
[1:49:13] ready to go, brother Robert. We're going
[1:49:15] to sing this one as you go. God bless
[1:49:16] you. Well, I've seen all this world I
[1:49:20] want to see.
[1:49:23] Things down here ain't got no chains on
[1:49:27] me. Well, I'm not worried about the
[1:49:30] future because I
[1:49:32] know he's ready to
[1:49:35] come. Well, I'm ready to
[1:49:38] go. Well, it seems like everybody's
[1:49:42] talking about
