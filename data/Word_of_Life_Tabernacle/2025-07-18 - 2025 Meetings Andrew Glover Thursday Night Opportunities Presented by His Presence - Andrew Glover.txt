We're an army of believers that makes us naturalb born receivers. Our negative thoughts, our doubts and fears we've left behind. While others think I know all I've got on my mind is I repeat the nature of the evil kind. We're taking on inspiration. We're living this revelation. Our eyesight's getting cleaner cuz we're not blind. We'll never feast on old things. By your spirit, we're being led. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. Oh, we're an army of believers. That makes us naturalborn receivers. Our negative thoughts, our doubts and fears remain. While others think, all I've got on my mind is fly. I repeat that the nature of the eagle kind. Oh, while others think of dying, all I've got on my mind is flight. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. [Music] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glad to be an eagle. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to be on at the meetings again? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand tonight. Wonderful to us. Brought us back together again another year. My goodness, what a what a wonderful crowd on a Thursday night. I &gt;&gt; These meetings have meant so much to us over the last few years. And this is our fifth meeting, the fourth one that we've done on the third weekend of July. And it's such a privilege to each one of us to have you here with us. And I got so many friends here. If I start calling names, I'm going to be in trouble. But we got folks from all over the country. Several states here tonight and a bunch more coming in tomorrow. So, we'll uh get here early and you'll get a seat. So, we uh but we sure appreciate you. We got a little room. We got room up front and a little bit of room in the back. I know there's some in the fellowship hall uh as well and and uh mothers with children and stuff. I know it's crowded in the nurseries and things, but but we just appreciate you coming together. There's something about coming together that means something, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; It's still worth it. It may be a struggle to be able to get together, but it's still worth it. And we believe that God is going to do something in this meeting. I I've been talking to the church about how our faith can be increased that that we could uh when we see signs of his presence that increases our faith. And that's what we want in this meeting. That's what's on my heart. That the faith of everyone that comes to this meeting would be increased in such a way that we could know God is here. And if he's here, anything is possible. the sick can be healed and the dead can be raised and and and people can be changed and I'm so thankful for that. We've got some amazing testimonies of things that God has done in these meetings. We're going to share some of them with you uh on on Saturday night at the prayer line. But God has just done remarkable things. But if you have a need tonight, how many come here with a need to the meetings tonight all over the building? I've got needs in my life. And I I just pray that God would meet every one of those needs. Do you believe he can do that? Do you believe he will do that? I I believe that he will. God bless each and every one of you for coming. My goodness. I'm looking out there and seeing people. I'm going to call names. I don't want to do that yet, but we'll get to that later in the meetings. Thank you for being here. Each one of you pastors, each one of you for being here. God bless you. Could we stand together tonight? And we're going to sing. Uh let me let me read this first. I've got a brother Brandham is praying and speak to this mountain. He says this. He said, 'Oh Lord, grant to your people a special blessing tonight of your divine presence. &gt;&gt; We we do not know what tomorrow holds, but we know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So we pray God that tonight by your grace that is projected to us a savior by your love. May it send him again tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit. You said, "I'm the vine and you're the branches." Get into these branches of the tree, Lord. energize everyone that you're connected with. Show signs and wonders of your resurrection that it might increase the faith of the people that they might look and live. Oh, that's my prayer tonight. Said for we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. I Let's make that our prayer tonight. Lord, increase my faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it'll just build every night. Tonight, we've got brother Andrew Glover. It's our privilege to have him again here in the meetings and be speaking tonight and again on Sunday morning. Brother Andrew's just been such a friend and a blessing to us. We got sister Mariah and Malachi here somewhere as well. God bless you. Thank you for being here tonight. We just love having our friends with us. Don't you love one another tonight?

How many can testify that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. The world is the world is doing everything they can to offer peace and it's only a substitution &gt;&gt; and it only lasts for just a little bit. But I think of the Bible how it said, "My peace I give unto you." And Amen. I don't believe it's temporary peace. I believe it's eternal peace. And I believe we're here tonight, the recipients of that peace. Amen. Want to say God bless you all tonight. It is a real honor to be here with you once again and to be in these meetings and to look around and see so many familiar faces here. We just want to say God bless you all. And we sure appreciate Brother Ben and Brother Joel and the church here and uh another year of hosting these meetings. And I was just thinking today as I was uh reading a little bit there, I think it's brother Ben mentioned maybe five years I think. And amen. I I just a blessing to see the hand of the Lord upon it and see the power of God moving. And Amen. How many enjoys the presence of the Lord? Amen. There's one thing we know that in his presence all things are possible. Amen. We want to say God bless you to all these men of God here tonight. Amen. A whole whole houseful of preachers and soldiers of the cross. And we sure appreciate every one of these brothers and their ministries and the Lord using them. And I know the Lord's going to use them to speak to us here this weekend. And amen do want to say it is an honor to be here and have my wife here with us. And amen, we bring you greetings tonight from the church at home, brother Matt and the saints there. And uh we see several of the folks here from home and I know several will be here this weekend. So, we just uh say it is a real honor to be in the presence of God. And &gt;&gt; we tonight want to approach the Lord and we're going to open these meetings tonight. And I pray this will be the night we just get our hearts and minds in one accord and allow his presence to come among us and speak to us. And maybe you just turn and lay your hand on someone standing next to you as we just join together. &gt;&gt; I know tonight that where there is division, there's no power. But where there's unity, all things are possible. And I believe there's enough power of God in this building tonight to put every demon back in the hell that it crawled out of. Let's just join together and dedicate ourselves and consecrate ourselves to him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your believers have gathered here this evening on this Thursday afternoon, Father, we've not gathered here out of form or fashion. We've not gathered here out of ritual or tradition, Lord. But Father, we've gathered here because there is a deep calling to the deep and that the noise of the water spouts. Lord, you promised you an answer. And Lord, as we're gathering here tonight, I know that the enemy is attacking on every hand. He's doing everything he can, Lord, to defeat this bride. But we stand up on your promise tonight, Lord, that greater is he that is in us than he that is in our enemy against us. And Lord, as we come together for these next few days, Lord, knowing that your presence is among us, Lord, Father, you see every need that's represented here tonight, whether it be a sickness, oh God, or whether it be a financial need or a materialistic need, Lord. Whatever the need would be, Father, a spiritual need, we're still firm believers that you're Jehovah Gyra. And Lord, as we're turning our attention to you, Father, asking you, Lord, Lord, to consecrate us for these meetings, Lord, Father, I pray you would drive out every spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit, Lord, as the believers have laid their hands upon one another, Father, knowing that where there is division, Lord, there is no power, but where there is unity, oh God, Lord, all things are possible. Now, Father, forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of our shortcomings, Lord. Lord, may we gather ourselves together under that one great banner of Jehovah. Lord, may you come down among us this weekend in supernatural ways. Lord, Father, may it be surge after surge of your presence, oh God. Lord, you see the desires of the hearts of your children, Lord. I pray that you would open the windows of heaven here this weekend. And Lord, you would fill this place with your graces, oh God. Lord, may answers come to prayers, Father. Lord, may may miracles be manifested right here before our very eyes. And Lord, we'll be sure to stand back and give thee all the praise, all the honor, and all the glory. In the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight. If you have your Bibles, while you're standing with us, we want to go uh to the book of St. John, the 18th chapter. Amen. I I want to say, Amen. It's a real uh real honor to be speaking to you and I thank brother Ben for this opportunity tonight and amen that we just actually get home from Czech Republic, brother uh Josh Martin and I just a few days ago and so amen if he dozes off you brothers wake him up and if I do off you wake me up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling brother Ben in the back room I don't know what time zone I'm on but I'm here and we're going to preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to look here tonight in the book of St. John the 18th chapter &gt;&gt; and the 37th verse. Amen. This is a very familiar scripture, but I just want to pull something from it if that be okay. In the 37th verse, the Bible here says, "Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world." So he was not guessing while he was here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth, and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. &gt;&gt; Now Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? &gt;&gt; And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. &gt;&gt; But ye have a custom. Isn't that something? Their custom was so powerful. But ye have a custom that I should release unto you one at the Passover. Will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews. Then cried they all again saying, "Not this man, but Barabbus." Now Barabbus was a robber. I I think it's amazing. Brother Ram said, "There they chose a robber or a murderer over the anointed word." &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word. as you can have your seats here. Uh this afternoon, I want to by the help of the Lord, if I would take a title tonight and speak to you on something here for just a few moments, I want to speak to you on this. Opportunities presented by his presence. Opportunities presented by his presence. Of course, I have to say uh what I believe tonight. I believe that you are a people, amen, of divine opportunity. I don't believe you're just a people of natural opportunity, but rather I believe you're a people of divine opportunity. And maybe uh just to start this off tonight and ask you, Amen. What are we doing with the opportunities that's being presented to us in the hour, in the age that we're living? You know, Brother Brandham would say in the Easter Seal, he said, "Oh, Christian, what an opportunity that we have." See, we have opportunities that St. Paul never dreamed of having. We have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had. Amen. The opportunities that we have now. Now, I love that because these opportunities are not in the future. Amen. So, we're not gathered here tonight looking forward to opportunities. Amen. And neither are we gathered here looking back to opportunities that other ages had, but rather we're here tonight knowing that the same God, amen, that's in the future and that's in the past is in the present. And he's here to give us the desires of our heart. Brother Brandham would say it very beautifully. He said the greatest opportunity that ever laid before any human being was to stand in the presence of Jesus Christ. Another place he said somehow or another it's always throwed a great effect upon people. Amen. To come into the presence of God. He said see there's something about coming into the presence of God. Amen. That it causes things to happen. So, amen. It's not just our music or who's here or who's not here. Amen. That causes things to happen. but rather, amen, it's who is here. Amen. And that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, when you when you look here at this, Pilate was in the presence of God. And I find it amazing that Pilate's standing there in the presence of God and he actually asked a question, amen, that the devil had inspired him to ask. He said, "Now, Amen. What is truth?" Amen. Now, that that's like that's like looking at a tree, amen, and saying, "What is a tree?" Or looking at a mountain and saying, "What is a mountain?" Amen. the thing you're looking at, amen, is the answer to your question. And I I want to say this tonight, that the devil is still anointing people, amen, to ask that question, what is truth? Amen. But I'm glad to announce to you tonight that we have the answer. Amen. To the devil's question that Christ is the truth. The message of the hour is Christ, and he is alive and he is well. Amen. The message of the hour is not a man. It's not a church. Amen. But it's God's promise for the present hour. Amen. According to the scripture. I thank God tonight that we're not gathered here looking around saying, "What is truth or what do we believe?" Or, "Who do we follow? Where do we go?" I'm thankful we're standing on a foundation tonight. Amen. It's not a shifting sands of some man's imagination, but it's the vindicated word of God in the hour that we're living in. We're We're not looking for Malachi 4. We're looking at Malachi 4. We're not looking for Revelation 10. Amen. We're looking at the fulfillment of Revelation 10. Amen. We're not looking for truth to appear. Amen. Truth has already appeared. Amen. And there was a prophet on the earth to identify. Amen. The truth that was appearing, Amen. was not be elyub. Amen. It was not a soothsayer or a fortune teller, but the truth that was appearing was the God of this Bible. Amen. Vindicating every promise that he has made in the hour that we're living. He he was identifying that this is more than just a message. Amen. This is more than just a preacher. But this is the opening of the book that's been sealed, amen, for years. And what's it doing? It's identifying the source of rapturing faith. Listen, I don't know about you, but we don't have another age to go to. Amen. There's not another age coming. There's not another messenger coming. We're standing on the threshold of millennial kingdom tonight. We got to get out of here, folks. We got to go somewhere. Where are we going to go? I'll tell you where we're going to go. The road map has been laid where we're going to go. We're going in the rapture. Amen. This message of the hour has brought. Amen. An opportunity to this generation to do something that others have longed to do. Amen. Not just to shout. Amen. Not just to dance. Amen. Not just to speak in tongues, but to change our bodies some morning between 6 and 9. We're not looking for truth. We're looking at truth. Amen. If God sends a message, Amen. then somebody's going to believe it's the truth. &gt;&gt; If God sends a message, Amen. Somebody's going to believe it's the truth. Said it very beautifully. He said, "We're now ready for a battle." Amen. Amen. The trumpet is to sound. The hymns have been sung. Now comes the word. Ain't that something? When the word comes is when the battle starts. Amen. The battle don't start on the music. It don't start on the singing, but it starts on the word. Amen. Because pro brother said like this. He said to hear these comments of these young soldiers here and myself getting old and listen around and your faith and confidence and what you placed in it to believe the message that I've been given of God. Now if it wasn't for you all the message would do no good. Amen. That devil tells you you're worthless or you don't have no value. But hear a prophet say if it wasn't for you all. Amen. Then the message would do no good. Amen. See, it's got to be somebody to believe it. And as long as it's coming from God, there is going to be somebody believe it. You see, because God has made a way. Well, that ought to make you put your shouting shoes on in the house of God. Hey, God has made a way when the devil's put every roadblock he can in front of the church of the living God. God who is rich in mercy has made a way to bring his word to pass in the hour that we're living in. Amen. God has made a way. Look what God has done. He has affixed his great economy like that that when he sends forth something, there is going to be something there to meet the something. Amen. When he sends forth something, there is going to be something there. Amen. To meet the something. In other words, if if if Amen. If if Philillip is going to the river, there's going to be a unic there. If Jesus is going to the well, there's going to be a woman there. If he's going by the Barnameus, he's going to be there. All glory to God. He didn't come here tonight hoping that there would be a believer here to believe his message, but before the foundation of the world, he set it up that when he would begin to reveal these things, there would be somebody on the earth that would not be saying, "What is truth?" But they would be saying, "Hosana, hosana." Glory to God in the highest. Truth is not coming. Truth is here. &gt;&gt; God has fixed this thing, folks. And there ain't nothing the devil can do about it. This ain't the devil's opportunity. This is the bride's opportunity. Amen. I love that word opportunity. It is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something. It is a chance for success or an advancement occurs. Now, I just got to say this. I don't believe the bride of Christ just going backwards. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we're retreating. Amen. But rather, I believe we are advancing. Brother said, "In spite of dungeons, in spite of swords and in spite of storms, amen, God's great church marches onward. We're so happy to be a member of the blessed body, looking shortly for the coming of our blessed Lord, who will receive us up into his kingdom, into his presence." He said, "There we will ever be with him." Oh, the glorious thoughts and the joy that sweeps through our souls when we look upon these promises and the Holy Spirit bearing us record. Amen. That they are the truth. I have to say it like this. Amen. The promises of God are almost Amen. like a spiritual broom. You know, you get a broom out, you're going to sweep something out, amen, that don't belong there. And and the prophet of God said, "What joy, Amen, fills our souls when we look upon these promises." Listen, I believe the promises of God ought to sweep depression out. I believe the promises of God, amen, ought to sweep sickness out. I think it ought to sweep discouragement out. I think the promises of God, Amen, ought to sweep out unbelief and sweep out confusion and sweep out false doctrine. Amen. Because God's church is not going backward. Amen. She's moving onward and she's going upward. How many is going onward? Amen. Amen. You sing that little song, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Amen. You can talk about me. You can scandalize my name. But I'm going on with Jesus just the same. I say, "Oh God, open the windows of heaven here this weekend and baptize every heart with the determination that come hell or high water, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. If the devil comes against me, if sickness come against me, I'm going on with Jesus just the same. I've come too far to lay down and quit now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going on with Jesus just to say, "Amen." I'll say this. This message ain't going backwards. It's going forward. And if you try to stay where God was, you're going to get left behind. It's time to put your walking shoes on. It's time to get your staff in your hand. And it's time to move into every promise that God has made. Reverend said, "The thing of it is today." Amen. The church grain don't want to mature. It wants to stay like it was back in Moody's time or back in Sanki's time or Finny or Knox or Calvin. He said they were all right. They were the light of the hour, but this is another hour. See, this is another day. Amen. This is the advancement of the gospel. It's coming to its maturity. So, we can't live in what Luther said or what Wesley said or some of the rest of them. We're living in the light that's been predicted for this day. We're in the seventh church age. Amen. Not the third or the fourth church age. Amen. The grain should be able to receive it. Well, that ought to make you put some shout shoes on. Amen. The grain ought to be able to receive. Amen. The maturity of the gospel. I don't think this is the time, Amen, to back up and start preaching sermonets and becoming Christianets and becoming shallow Christians. I think if there's ever been a time, amen, to preach the meat of this message and to declare the oracles of God, I think now is the time to do it. What other age but this age? What other people but you? What other time but this time? This is the hour to move with the presence of the sun. We're not going backwards. If it does, it falls off and it means nothing to it. Amen. The grain is matured with the light. Ain't that powerful? Amen. The grain is matured with the light if it goes ahead with the light. I love what John said. He said, "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, &gt;&gt; cleanseth us all from sin." I love that word walk. It means to make due use of opportunities. So when you're walking in the light, you're making good use of the opportunities that the light is presenting to you in the hour that you're walking. Paul said it like this. He said, "Redeeming the time because the days are evil." I love that phrase, redeeming the time. You know what that actually means? It means to buy up every at each opportunity. Amen. That word time means the supreme moment. It means the golden opportunity. In other words, Paul is saying, "Redeem our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. This is the golden opportunity, folks. Amen. This is the supreme moment. Amen. I love what brother said. He said, "Don't you miss your opportunity. It's presented to every man and woman in this world." Amen. Daily like that. But they fail to get it. See their opportunity. Can I say something to you? Amen. Death is not your opportunity to change. But then he said, "No." He said, "In his presence while you're living is the opportunity to change." He said, "Every sinner that's in here, perhaps there would be one." You have been saved since Jesus died. He said, "But don't you never die here where your opportunity was placed before you to go in his presence then to try to accept it. It's made for now." See? Amen. Right now, you must accept it. Amen. If you go beyond the blood, then you're already judged because you're judged by the way you treated the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. See, you judge yourself. Listen, if that ever settled on your heart, that these are not just meetings and these are not just services and these are not just gettogethers once and twice a year, but these are supreme moments. These are golden opportunities. These are present moments and presence of God where things can change. He said, "When we come in his presence," Amen. We're changed never to be the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that you never go in the presence of God and leave the way you come? You know what the prophet said? He said, "You leave better or you leave worse." Amen. Look, call down for the ages every walk of life. You say, "Well, the changed life is just for ministers." Oh, no. The changed life is for everybody. Well, I'm not a preacher. Bless the Lord. you at the right place at the right time. The change life is for everybody. I say this, the change life is for the young. The change life is for the old. The change life is for the preacher. The change life is for the deacon. The change life is for the Sunday school teacher. Amen. Now is the day of salvation. Amen. This is your hour of visitation. He said, don't you wait till some region yonder in the damned in that dimension when you cannot go in the presence of God. Your time is up on earth in the nightmare of horror. You'll remember you had your opportunity and you turned it away. Amen. Let the young people take notice to this. He said, "Let all take notice to this." Amen. So, a man who turns down his opportunity in the presence of God, amen, does not forget it, but he will remember it when it's too late. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. I think it's powerful in our opening scripture. Amen. that Jesus Christ is standing there in Pilot's hall. And the prophet of God said, he said, "I'm holding my point or making my point here and saying that we are standing today in another Pilot's judgment hall." So, we don't have to go back 2,000 years ago, but right here in Hardy, Arkansas on a Thursday night, we are standing in Pilot's judgment hall again. He said, "You say, "Well, if I would have stood there, I would have spoke out for Jesus Christ." Well, what are you doing about it now? Well, we might as well preach. It's Thursday night. What are you doing about it now? Amen. What are you giving God now? Are Are you just giving him what's left? I think this ought to be the best. &gt;&gt; Can I preach? Amen. This ain't our first meeting, folks. I think this ought to be the best meeting we ever had. I think we ought to preach our best sermons. I think we ought to sing our best songs. I think we ought to give our best hallelujah. I think we ought to give the devil the best kick that we've ever given him. I think it's time, amen, to rise and seize the opportunity that God has given us in the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; What are you doing about it now? See, no matter how much the church turned him down, Amen. You got the opportunity right now. Now, makes he brings it down real close. In the days of Jesus, Re said Pilate was a fool to the world. Amen. Jesus was a fool to Pilate, but Pilate was a nut. Amen. See, he had opportunity, but when he had his opportunity to accept it, he wanted some kind of clown or some kind of a trick or some kind of a magic rabbit. Amen. To bring a hat or or you know, he said, "Oh, I want to see you do some tricks." &gt;&gt; He said he was a nut himself. He had a chance to receive it, but he didn't. I love what the prophet of God said. He said, "What should he have done?" He said, "He ought to have repented." &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter, or Pilate rather, ought to have repented when he was standing in the presence of the only one who could forgive him. &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's powerful that God rich in mercy. Amen. In this another judgment hall and in another pilot's judgment hall, I think it's a powerful thing that God has sent us a prophet. Amen. to make sure that we did not miss our opportunity in the presence of the anointed word. I love what Amos said. He said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." Malachi 4, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophets before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the Lord." Now, watch this. and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest thou would come and smite the earth with a curse. Amen. Now, we can't stop there. We got to go all the way to Revelation 10 when he said, "In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished." Amen. As he hath declared, Amen. to his servants the prophets. Now, he didn't declare this to theologians. He didn't declare this to reformers. He didn't declare this to to to the pope or or to some bishop. He declared this, amen, to his servants, which are the prophets. I love this word servants. Amen. It is one who gives himself up to another's will. Amen. Those whose service is used by Christ in extending and advancing his cause among men. So, Revelation 10:7 was not fulfilled to take the church back. Oh, God. Revelation 10:7 was fulfilled to take the church further in the advancement of the gospel. Listen, we're not going back to dead works, folks. We have been anointed by Apostle Paul's ministry. I feel like shouting. He said, "Let us go on into perfection." Well, if there's a call to go to perfection, God has fixed it up where somebody is going to go to perfection. If there's a pool to go to heaven, God has got a heaven somewhere that somebody's going to go to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God ain't running his business by the &gt;&gt; I got to be careful. My southern waves will come out here. &gt;&gt; God ain't running his business fly by night. &gt;&gt; God knows who's going to be at the marriage supper of the lamb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, he sent a prophet to reveal to you. &gt;&gt; He's not taking you backwards. &gt;&gt; He's taking you further. &gt;&gt; And he's doing it by truth. &gt;&gt; What is truth? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Re said it'll take a prophet to get the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural revelations &gt;&gt; except by a prophet. Now the word always came by a prophet and always will. That is the law of God is evident by even a casual search of scripture. The unchanging God with unchanging ways invariably sin is prophet in every age where the people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word. God always sent his servant to these people. but apart from the theologians in order to correct false teaching and to lead the people back to God. &gt;&gt; Now, come on. We ought we ought to thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of us, if you're like me, Amen. You didn't graduate Kumladi. You graduated. Thank you, Lord. Amen. You didn't have any any I'm talking about, brother. Amen. You didn't have no education and no way to break down all these words. But God sent you a prophet that could say it in such a way that you would understand it that what he was saying would pull you from the confusion. It would pull you from the ideas of man and it would lead you back to the God of Abraham. Go church of the living God. We're not standing on the ideas of the man. We're standing on thus sayaith the Lord. We have been led by the voice of the seventh angel back into the presence of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What are you saying? I'm saying we was a hopeless people. &gt;&gt; Brother Adam, we was a hopeless, helpless people. But revelation came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation came. You say, "Why are you so happy about revelation?" Because revelation brings hope. &gt;&gt; Education brings confusion. And theology brings bondage, but revelation brings hope. Amen. Y'all remember Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones? Brother Tommy looks across this valley and all he sees is dry bones. I love what the Bible says. Then he said unto me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, our bones are dried." Now listen what they said, "And our hope is lost. We are cut off for our parts." Look at this word hope. But that word hope is accord, &gt;&gt; brother Brian. It's an expectation. It's things hoped for. Amen. It means outcome. &gt;&gt; Now, y'all heard me say this before. Amen. It means outcome. Amen. Amen. You want to You want a really deep definition of the word outcome? &gt;&gt; Anybody want one? I'll give it to you. Okay. Just rearrange the word and it means come out. &gt;&gt; Our bones are dried. &gt;&gt; Our parts are cut off. All hope is lost. But they forgot there was a cord of prophecy that was tied to those bones. Amen. You remember the little boy out there flying the kite around? Amen. The critic come by and said, "Hey, young man, where's your kite?" He said, "It's somewhere on the other side of the clouds." He said, "Well, you can't see that kite." Amen. So, how do you know it's there? You know what they say, Brother Joe? They say, "You don't see your theophony. How do you know it's there? You don't see your glorified body. How do you know it's there? You don't see the rapture. How do you know it's there? He said, "Because every now and again, I feel a little tug on the other side of the clouds, testifying that what I believe is there is there." Oh, I pray this weekend that God from the realms of glory would begin to tug on the court of prophecy that is tied around your soul and you would lift up your heavy hands. You would shake off the heavy bands. you would lay aside those garments of heaviness and put on the spirit of praise and say, "God has set this up. God has fixed this up. I know there's a reality to my desire." &gt;&gt; Oh my. God was able to help. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was in the airport the other day and there was a little boy and brother, he was running all over the place and I was sitting there at the gate drinking a cup of coffee, watching this kid. I mean, he was going everywhere. Brother Levi, there was something about it. He would take off running and then all of a sudden he would come back and I thought, "What in the world?" Then his mama walked by and I said, "I got to know what's going on here." She flipped a button and said, "See that line? It's an invisible cord." She said, "He can only go so far." I said, "You don't" I said, "You're not nervous. He's going to get on another plane." She said, "Sorry, Joe." She said, "No." She said, "I'm going to turn on the lights and I'm going to give a little tug and he's going to come back to where he belongs." Oh, we ought to put on our shouting shoes in the house of God. Amen. That devil says, "I'm going to take you out of church. I'm going to take you here. I'm going to take you there and I'm going to put you in the tribulation and I'm going to put you in the graveyard." But then God, rich in mercy, turns on the little lights because there's a man here who can turn on the lights and he gives a little tug and he begins to remind you, you didn't come from Leosa, so you can't go back to Leosa. You didn't come from hell, so you can't go back to hell. You came from God and you must go back to where you came from. &gt;&gt; I say, thank God there's a little tug. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will not lose one of us. No sir. No matter how much sickness comes, how kind of a death we die, how much poverty we go through, God's purpose cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; Well, tell the devil that &gt;&gt; he will raise us up again. &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye shall live also. &gt;&gt; I love what he said, brother Josh. He said, "That's our hope." &gt;&gt; That's our hope. He said, "Lord, the end is nigh. The time is coming and people must know with assurityity that we the Christians know that our hope is not built upon some kind of the mystic something but upon purely the word of God and a God who can make all things work together &gt;&gt; for us. Amen. I'll say this. We're not a hopeless church. &gt;&gt; There's a hope for the church. You say, "What is the hope?" I'll tell you what a prophet said. He said, "There is no hope left but the second coming of the Lord Jesus." He said, "And tonight, the only hope of the church is to get away from their man-made theologies and get back to the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; And in case you're wondering, the same Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit. Amen. And get back to the Holy Spirit and get the spirit back in the church. &gt;&gt; Now, I know why they try to break it down and make you think there's a Holy Ghost and there's a Holy Spirit. It's because they're ashamed. Amen. to say Holy Ghost because they associate Holy Ghost with a bunch of sweating, spitting, sweating people called Pentecostals. But I want to tell that devil, I'm not ashamed of the Holy Ghost I got. If it makes me shout, I'll shout. If it makes me cry, I'll cry. If it makes me run, I'll run. If it makes me repent, I'll repent. Because I know my only hope is the Holy Ghost and the second coming &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just preaching a little bit here tonight. I hope that's okay. Amen. Get the spirit back in the church. Now, listen what the prophet said. He said, "Get the spirit back in the church and get the church straightened out." &gt;&gt; So, putting a certain preacher in the church ain't going to straighten it out. &gt;&gt; Putting a certain idea in the church ain't going to straighten it out. What's going to straighten it out, brother Phil? Is putting the Holy Ghost back in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I say that's what we ought to do. We ought to open up the doors and let the Holy Ghost come back in his church. Let him come back unrestricted. Let him come back unlimited. Let him come back unhindered. Let him come back in the power and the authority of who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you. And brother Bram said very beautiful. He said it's going to take a prophet to straighten it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it. I know, brother Kenny. Amen. We've been battling this for a long time. People don't believe in the church age book. But but I love the church age book. Come on. &gt;&gt; And in 1964, Brother Bram wrote an audio letter to Lee Vale and he said this. He recorded it and said, "In order to proclaim this, he has to send a prophet in order to inject this and make this real again &gt;&gt; to show the people the hour we're living in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if they only see it in the hour past, then there's no hope for the church. So God has to send a prophet to inject the reality of the living presence of Jesus Christ. Because if they just see it in an hour past, then we're a hopeless people. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Bo. If we just see it in Moses's day or Zachariah's day or Abraham's day, we are gathered here a hopeless people. But because I have seen the day star arise, because I have seen the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings, I can believe God will give every barren womb a baby. I can believe God will heal cancer. I can believe God will open blinded eyes. I can believe God will save a sinner. I can believe God will take a drunk and make a preacher out of him. I believe God can take a prostitute and make a Sunday school teacher out of her. This ain't a day gone by. This is the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in his church again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If it's only an hour past, there's no hope. &gt;&gt; The church must see it &gt;&gt; in the present tense. &gt;&gt; So God sends his prophet &gt;&gt; to manifest it in present tense. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, now somebody say, "Well, how does God straighten his church out?" Well, I love what brother says. He said he will plant the seed of the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; So, the way God corrects the error is by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The way God brings his presence back in his church. The way God restores truth to his church is by sending Malachi 4, which is Germanized word, &gt;&gt; which will plant the entire seed of the Bible plumbed from the serpent to the messenger in the former reign. He said, "But what we need today, brother, is to sew the gospel seed of the word of the power, the resurrection of Christ, the living being that's living with us in us now, present tense." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Brother Wendle, he's not just back there. And he's not just up there, but he's right here, present tense. See, what it is, it's a law, amen, of presenting and yielding. Paul said, "Amen." Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. What is sin? Unbelief. &gt;&gt; But yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. &gt;&gt; I love this word yield. It means to present. &gt;&gt; It means to pro. It means to provide. It means to place a person or thing at one's disposal. &gt;&gt; Amen. For sin shall not have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; For ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then shall we sin? Because we're not under the law, but under grace, God forbid. Know ye not. Not to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey. His servants ye are. Amen. Listen. whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness. But God be faint that ye were the servants of sin. &gt;&gt; At one time we were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart. Oh God, &gt;&gt; ye have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered you now. Amen. I just can I can I preach, brother Ben? Is that okay? You got my liberty. Amen. Amen. I just got to be honest with you. I'm about I'm about past sick and tired of people all the time knocking doctrine. Like if you believe in doctrine, you're some kind of intellectual Christian. Amen. We don't need no doctrine. We don't need Well, well, let me say this. Thank God we have some doctrine. Amen. To separate us from a bunch of prostitute daughters and a mother system. &gt;&gt; Well, we don't need no doctrine. We just need to preach the Bible. They've been preaching the Bible for 2,000 years and got women wearing pants and men married three and four times in pull pits and deacons married four and five. &gt;&gt; You know I'm in the message. Amen. It's because somewhere they ran off without the spirit of God. But I am one believer that believes we need to bring the Holy Ghost back in the church and let him clean up from the pullpit to the back door. From the music to the deacons, &gt;&gt; to the Sunday school teachers, to the young people, I say, Lord, straighten out your church and put the true doctrine back in the church. Put the truth back in the church. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm just saying what Paul said. He said, "Obey from the heart." Now, how can you obey from the heart unless God sends a prophet to turn the heart? All right. &gt;&gt; You cannot obey from your heart the truth unless God sends a prophet to turn the heart. Look at this word obeyed. It means of one who comes and knocks at the door. &gt;&gt; Well, you all know what Jesus said. Brother Jeff, he said, "Behold, I stand at the door knock. And if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will suck with him and he with me." Now, Ream said it very beautiful. He said there will be a voice speak to us in the last days. Remember they ought to see a sign. He said but then look after the sign there will come a voice. &gt;&gt; So when you start seeing signs reappearing you got to identify what voice is coming behind those signs. &gt;&gt; He said if any man will c is this okay? &gt;&gt; If any man will let me in I'll come in and will suck with him and they with me. He said, "Now see, if any man will open the door and just and just cooperate with me &gt;&gt; just a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'll come in and suck with them, I'll make myself known to them. If I can just get in like I did on the road to Emmas that night. If I can just get in, I'll make myself known to them." Now, what does suck mean? &gt;&gt; It means to reveal. &gt;&gt; Now, what's he going to reveal when he gets inside? Is he going to reveal the Baptist Jesus? &gt;&gt; Is he going to reveal the Pentecostal Jesus? He said, "I will reveal that I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever. The son of man will be revealed in that day, and everything else will become solemn like that. I'll be on the outside, but I'll be knocking trying to get in." Listen, someone knocking on the door is the presenting of something to you. But when you go over and open the door, is you yielding to what's being presented? &gt;&gt; Look what the prophet of God said. He said, "Now the fle now, now do you realize there's things right now knocking from your flesh at your heart &gt;&gt; and there's things knocking on your flesh and there's things knocking on your heart." He said, "Now the flesh will say there's no need. You pretty little thing, you're the prettiest little thing in school. Now, don't you pay no attention to that holy roller mother of yours or that fanatic father. See, you're the best looking girl in school. You're the prettiest boy. You're you're the best bill. You're you're the most popular there is in the city. And you yield your members to that. &gt;&gt; And where do you come out at? At the little end of the horn every time. &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "My flesh wants to always yield to that." Your flesh does, too. But the law of the spirit &gt;&gt; of God in the heart overcomes the flesh &gt;&gt; and makes the body obey what the heart says do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're God in your heart overcomes the flesh and makes the body obey what the spirit says do because you're not here belonging to yourself. We are God's chosen instruments to accomplish God's divine purposes. But said, "Look, if God, when I was an alien from him, so loved me that he stooped down and picked me up, &gt;&gt; that gives me confidence that he wants to use me. &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose in doing it. He's seen something in me. He's seen something in you. &gt;&gt; He had a reason to save you. &gt;&gt; You look at the people that's unsaved today." He said, "Look at the millions he could have took beside you, &gt;&gt; but he took you. Oh God, come on. &gt;&gt; Look at the millions he could have took, &gt;&gt; but he took you. See, and no one can take your place. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I was preaching somewhere the other day and somebody I was down in Alabama and brother brother David Templeton, he said, "Brother," he said, "Man, you're preaching tonight, preaching tomorrow night, preaching a three-day meeting." He said, "Man," he said, he said, "that that's got to be a lot." And I said, 'Well, I said, I remember when I first started preaching, honestly, brother brother brother Kenny, I remember that in order to be spiritual, you had to walk around and act like you was miserable doing what you was doing. You know, well, I don't know why I'm preaching it. I don't I don't I remember that until one day I was listening to a sermon Brother Bisc was preaching and he was just preaching away and he said, "Are you all enjoying this as much as I'm enjoying preaching it?" &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God." Amen. Amen. It's okay to enjoy what God called you to do. Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I think you ought to be careful." Listen, if you come from where I come from and God gave you the privilege to stand and preach this message to his queen, it's the greatest honor of my life. I'd rather be standing here than anywhere else in the world telling the people that God has sent a prophet and the word has been restored and the seed has come back to seed again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't a burden to do what God called us to do. It's a privilege. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, you've not chosen me, but I chose you that you should bring forth fruit." &gt;&gt; Now, now, come on, church. Brother Brham said, "If the Lord told me to go up here and raise George Washington up out of the presidential graveyard, I would invite the whole world &gt;&gt; to see it done. It could happen." See, for the Holy Ghost said, he said, "And you know how." Amen. And now watch. If he is in you, he will act his life out in you. Just be satisfied. He wants to use you. &gt;&gt; He'll sure do it. See, he knows where you're at. &gt;&gt; Brother Daryl, you weren't looking for God, but God knew where you was at in Jonesboro when he saved you and he revealed himself to you. Come on. I wasn't looking for God, but God knew where I was at when I was a 9-year-old boy. and he pulled on my heart and I gave my heart to God. What about every one of you sitting here tonight? Some of you all was running from God. You was in bars and an alley rats and everywhere else. But God had a purpose in saving you. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. He had a purpose in saving you because he had a plan for your life. &gt;&gt; You say, "What was that plan?" That plan was you was going to be his human instrumentality. &gt;&gt; God was going to confirm his word that had been restored through human instrumentality. Brother said, look, he said, so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return into me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. Look at this word accomplish. It means to act with effect. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the word will act in your life with an effect. &gt;&gt; He said his word cannot return until it's accomplished that which it's been spoken for. So God is waiting this afternoon &gt;&gt; on a people that'll take a hold of that word and hold it until it's accomplished. &gt;&gt; That which it was purposed for. He said, "See, the word was sent to the earth by God, and it will accomplish exactly &gt;&gt; it will accomplish exactly what God sent it for." Amen. Let me say this. Jesus was the word made flesh and he came into the earth, but he came to accomplish the purpose of God. Now listen, the purpose of God was coming through human instrumentality from heaven. &gt;&gt; Can I say what a brother said? He said, "Now we are left, as we understand, to carry on the work that he come to accomplish his death at Calvary. He was with us." And he, now this is a powerful quote. And he come out of God into the world. See, he went from the world into God and come again in the form of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and is with us &gt;&gt; to the end of the world, carrying out in his church the same work that he did when he was here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, if I was the devil, I'd try to shut you up, too. because you're not coming by your own will. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Lo, he came in the volume of the book." &gt;&gt; Jesus found the place that it was written and said, "This is written of me to fulfill this portion of scripture." And you know what the prophet of God said? He said, "The same word that speaks of the bridegroom, it speaks to the bride." So the same book that Jesus stepped out of is the same book that the seventh angel called this bride from. Listen, we didn't come by the flesh of our mothers or our fathers. We come by predestination. &gt;&gt; Well, get out of our way, devil. We're not a bunch of church members. We're sons and daughters of God who have not stepped from some seminary. We have not stepped from some college. We have stepped from the volume [Applause] &gt;&gt; of the book. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, where are you getting at?" He said in his ministry today, he said, "Now, there's many people in the Bible that teaches the Bible as a historical book," &gt;&gt; which it is, &gt;&gt; but it's more than a history. &gt;&gt; It's a prophetic book. &gt;&gt; It foretells it what it was. It tells what it'll be. &gt;&gt; Y'all want to preach with me? Come on. &gt;&gt; Do you accept that to be truth? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is truth? &gt;&gt; The same Jesus &gt;&gt; that was &gt;&gt; is &gt;&gt; and will be. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now his ministry carries on." I'm having fun giving the devil black eyes. He said, "Anoint thy servant and pack me from this sensebound existence into the spheres where you live." &gt;&gt; He said, "The same spirit," are you with me? &gt;&gt; That began the works of the father and to finish the atonement. Now listen, to make a way &gt;&gt; that we could carry the message. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Wendle, his atonement made a way &gt;&gt; that we could carry the message. If that spirit's in you, you'll have the same attitude towards people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we might as well just let the rubber hit the road preacher for a second. Amen. Because if you're carrying the same message that William Brandon brought, you'll have the same attitude towards the people that he had. And his wasn't a bitter attitude. It wasn't a critical attitude. Every time he got a pullpit, he didn't tell who heard him and who offended him and who cut him and who didn't listen to him. Every time he got a pullpit, he took the same attitude that Jesus Christ took and said, "I'm not here as a great big guy. I'm here as God's servant." He said, "I'm here to be a help to my brother and a help to the doctor's patient and a servant to God's child." See, if the spirit's in you, you'll have the same attitude, trying to do what you can to help them. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, can I preach? Come on, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; No matter who they are, &gt;&gt; or where they are, &gt;&gt; he said you'll try to help people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; May as well preach. Come on. &gt;&gt; No matter who they are, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; Or where they are, &gt;&gt; you'll try to help people. Come on, brother. I'm standing on the platform and there comes that maniac all fours with a chain on him. And he said, I was just going to pass him by. He said, but there was something crying out. &gt;&gt; There's a soul in there. &gt;&gt; See, we are the instrumentality of God. We present our bodies a living sacrifice. This revelation didn't come to live on the bookshelf, folks. This message didn't come to be pictures on the wall. &gt;&gt; The Bible said that this is the house that God dwells in. &gt;&gt; He don't dwell in a building with a big bell on the top of it and a high steeple. He said, "But a &gt;&gt; a body hast thou prepared me? A body that God can dwell in, that God can walk in, that God can see in, that God can talk in, that God can work in." &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, here's the beautiful thing about it, Brother Brian. He has moved into us, &gt;&gt; and we have moved into him. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "At that day ye shall guess that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you." Is that what it says? At that day ye shall know, said, "The word becomes you and you become the word." See, at that day, what day? This day. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What are you getting at, preacher? I'm saying his presence has returned to the church. &gt;&gt; He's not here in the sheetrock. He's not here in the carpet. He's not here in the pews. He is here in the redeemed flesh that his atonement made a way for him to move into. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deity is not in heaven. Brother Ben, deity is on the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for deity. I'm looking at deity. I'm not trying to find God. I'm looking at God in his people. &gt;&gt; Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst. &gt;&gt; We're happy today to be alive with the opportunity to once again preach the gospel, the uncarchable riches of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; as we present him to the people today in the form of the written word. Now, &gt;&gt; I love what a prophet said. He said that he brought again the Lord Jesus from the dead &gt;&gt; and has presented him to us this morning &gt;&gt; in the form of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. God has always been on the earth &gt;&gt; in some form. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now he is here." Can't you see the son of man? the son of man in the form of prophetic message &gt;&gt; returning back again in his church &gt;&gt; in prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now come on folks either we preach the truth or we don't &gt;&gt; can we just say what a prophet said it's never been done through the age till this time &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; so it's a changing of dispensation The mighty angel didn't descend in the book of Acts. The mighty angel descended in Revelation 10 at the changing of a dispensation because it was the return of the presence of the Lord Jesus to give faith to his children and to endure with them knowledge. His presence is here. &gt;&gt; And if he is here, then all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm just going to have to preach. My ministry is a different ministry. My ministry is to declare him. See, he is here. &gt;&gt; Remember said what Jesus was is what his presence is now. &gt;&gt; You say, "I wish I'd have been standing there when he healed the bomb Barameus. I wish I would have been there when he opened the eyes of the beggar. I wish I would have been there when he raised the widow of name son." Can I say this to you? The same Jesus that was there in a corporal body is right here tonight in a many member body. Lo, I have come in the volume of the book. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Well, somebody tell that devil, devil, it's time for you to get out. He's here. &gt;&gt; Devil, it's time for you to get out. He's here. He's here in power. He's here in authority. He's here in anointing. He's here in reality. He's here in healing. He's here in revelation. He's here in supreme power. He's here in supreme authority. The supreme intelligence of Jesus Christ is right here in this building tonight. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind." I ain't lost my mind. Re said he's supreme. He's right here now and he's supposed to return. &gt;&gt; Well, let's preach a return ministry. You want to? All right. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, don't run out on me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He's supposed to return &gt;&gt; in the last days. &gt;&gt; We know that through human flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And declare himself the same way. &gt;&gt; We're all aware of that. If you are, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, anybody want some comfort? Now, for your comfort, I say this to you in his name. He is here. &gt;&gt; The same God that came down and talked to Abraham and had his back turned to the tent and Sarah inside the tent. He knew what she was thinking. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have broke out of the dispensation of denominational revivals, folks. We have broke out of the dispensation of personality revivals. We have stepped into the son of man dispensation where the same Jesus that discerned the woman at the well that Hallelujah that God and Melzdc and Elohim and discern Sarah is right here in this building tonight. He knows your heart. He knows your desire. He knows where your baby is. He knows where your healing is. He knows Hallelujah. He's here. &gt;&gt; What is truth? It's here tonight, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. &gt;&gt; Y'all ever look that word comfortless up? Fatherless. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you without a father. [Applause] Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And the devil &gt;&gt; come tell you what to believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; and said, "We got a parent &gt;&gt; and it's the word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; now what are you saying, preacher? I'm saying this. We're not ignorant. &gt;&gt; We're not confused. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to have a meeting. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to have a revival. &gt;&gt; Come on now, &gt;&gt; Sister Corine. We are the revival. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See the prophet God said, "May the pillar of fire, may the pillar of cloud move into the people today &gt;&gt; and sober them Lord &gt;&gt; to the realization of the presence of the living and mighty God." &gt;&gt; Amen. I brother Josh and I was just there in Czech Republic and I was ministering there on Saturday night and I'd never called it before so clear as I was just preaching Revelation 10:1. I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven and he was clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face is were the sun. Y'all ever read that? Amen. In just in just one sentence, brother Josh, it goes from the head to the feet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In just one little &gt;&gt; I'm that guy. I'm sorry. In just one little punctuation mark, it goes all the way from the head to the feet. And I got to thinking, how in the world does it skip from the head to the feet so quick? Because the Bible said he hath put all things under his feet. Who is his feet? His feet was as pillars of fire. And the prophet of God said, "Let the pillar of fire move into the people right now and sober them to the realization that headship is not coming. Headship is here." You say, "I want to put the devil under my feet." Well, now's the high time to do it. Now's the golden opportunity. Now's the supreme moment. When you see the headship identifying the body, it's the time. The rapture is at hand. I tell you tonight, and I'm just going to preach a second. I tell you, it's time to quit playing with devils. It's time to quit playing with spirits. It's time to quit playing church. You're not just another people. You're not just another church. You are the identified return of the presence of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's here tonight. &gt;&gt; I said he's here tonight. &gt;&gt; I said he's here tonight. &gt;&gt; He's here right now. &gt;&gt; He's here right now. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what the devil don't want you to realize? The devil don't want you to catch the revelation that Jesus Christ, the son of God, is right here tonight. Because the second that that revelation strikes your soul that Jesus Christ is in this building is the second that devil becomes a defeated foe. Can &gt;&gt; I tell you this tonight, your devils are already defeated. Them spirits are already broken. Them tormentors are already defeated. It's your time to take possession as the as the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what that devil says. That devil says sleep through this. That devil says, "Look at your watch through this." That devil says, "How many pages has he got and how many &gt;&gt; I know what that devil says." That devil says, "Well, just hurry up. We got to get out of here." Amen. But can I tell you what God says? He says, "When you recognize his presence, You release his power. &gt;&gt; And you're looking at one preacher that will not be limited by a clock. I will not be limited by frowns. I will not be limited by stairs. Because I know if we just keep on knocking, if we keep on asking, before long, the Holy Ghost is going to come in the building. We don't need another meeting. We need a breakthrough. We don't need another get together. We need the Holy Ghost to break out again and shake us from the top of our head to the soles of our feet. &gt;&gt; You know what my Bible says? If any two or three agree is touching any one thing upon the earth, it shall be done in heaven. &gt;&gt; No matter how much God is standing present, you've got to believe it. [Music] &gt;&gt; You got to believe it. I'm telling you tonight, folks, we're not beggars. We're believers. &gt;&gt; We're not beggars. We're believers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not beggars, brother Daryl. We're believers. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That devil don't like that. You know why? Cuz that devil's put you in a begging condition. And every meeting, you're begging God. And every morning you pray, you're begging God. Your prayers ain't even prayers no more. They become begging sessions. Well, we might as well preach. We roam all the way up here. Amen. Your prayers have become begging sessions. And oh God, please. Oh God, oh God, please save. Oh God, please heal. Can I say this to you? We're not going in these meetings beggars. &gt;&gt; We're going in these meetings believers. &gt;&gt; Beggars beg God. Believers believe God. &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you saying?" I'll tell you what I'm saying. I'm over in the book of Mark the 10th chapter when there was a blind man sitting by the highway side and he was begging until the word Hallelujah. He was begging when I'll shout by myself. He was begging until the word come walking by his way. And when the word come by, the word said, "You don't have to beg for your healing. Believe for your healing." &gt;&gt; We don't have to beg God for an answer. We believe God for an answer. I don't have to beg God to heal you. God's already healed you. I don't have to beg God to save your babies. He's already saved them. I don't have to beg God to deliver you from that habit. He's already delivered you. You just got to break out of the confusion and the tradition and the ideas of man and break out in the realms of faith &gt;&gt; and believe God like a Messiah is. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're getting way out there with that begging." No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; Go look at the word begging. You know what it means? It means asking one to make an addition. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I was preaching that the other day, brother, somebody got a little to about it. Well, you talking about begging. I said, 'Well, it's real simple to make an addition. Asking one to make an addition. They said, "You can't prove that by the message." I said, "You forgot I got books and tapes, too, didn't you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what brother Bam said? He said, "If he was standing here in this suit of clothes he gave me, he could do no more for you." &gt;&gt; So, there was no need to stand there and beg God, right? He had already done it. Satan, I adjure thee in the name of the living God. He's already done it. He's already healed. He's already saved. He's already gained the Holy Ghost. Put miracles in the building. He's right here tonight. Come on. You want to take this meeting to another level? Quit begging God. Quit begging God and start believing God. Believe him like a Messiah. Believe him like a son of God. ought to believe. I like to beg God to heal. I believe God's already healed. &gt;&gt; You say, "You lost your mind." I haven't lost my mind. God has appeared right here. The God of heaven has appeared right here in this building in the form of his word. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? I'm saying God &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; has ordained another opportunity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; to come in these meetings. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; you say, "Preacher, you lost your mind." I haven't lost my mind. I've got the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ calls every promise of God present tense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying this. &gt;&gt; We're not begging God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're standing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; On vindicated word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can I say to you like this? &gt;&gt; You're at the right place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the right time. [Music] &gt;&gt; God fixed this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's going from Judea &gt;&gt; to Galilee. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he must have needs to go by Hardy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why are you going by Hardy, Lord? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I only do that what the Father shows me. &gt;&gt; Why are you going down there to that whale? Y'all ever notice something? When Jesus got there, the woman didn't show up and beg him to be there. He was already there. &gt;&gt; You know what God has done this weekend? God has arranged these meetings through human instrumentality to deal with the needs of his believing children. Can I say this to you? I I had a lot I wanted to preach tonight, but I'm going to follow the Lord on this right here. He's already fixed it. He's already set it up. He's already got everything in place. You're not here by accident. You're a part of the vision. This wasn't seen yesterday, Gabby. This was seen from before the foundation of the world. God didn't see you victorious yesterday, Judah. He saw you victorious before you was ever even born because there was a predestinated seed &gt;&gt; on the inside of your soul. Come on, church. When the when Pilate Oh, God, I feel like preaching. When Pilate stood there, he looked at Jesus and he said, "What is truth?" But when that ill-famed woman when she looked at Jesus, she didn't say, "What is truth?" She said, "You are the truth." She said, "I know, Messiah." Do you see the difference in nonseed and in seed? In nonseed, there's nothing to quicken, but in seed, there is something to quicken. You say, "Why am I here?" Because you're not pilot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not pilot. You're the bride of Jesus Christ and there's a seed on the inside of your soul. And when you saw this message, you didn't say, "What is truth?" You said, "This ain't nothing but the truth." You said, "This is the evil screen." &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God fixed it that way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God fixed it that way. Come on. &gt;&gt; God didn't leave the devil any room &gt;&gt; to change in time what he done in eternity. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forever s. &gt;&gt; Now, she was still in flesh, brother Wendle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know how I know that? Because she said these words. &gt;&gt; Oh my. She said, "The Jews &gt;&gt; have no dealings &gt;&gt; with the Samaritans." &gt;&gt; Didn't scare him one bit, Levi. &gt;&gt; Didn't back him up one bit, brother. &gt;&gt; You know why? You know why, brother Colin? Because it wasn't a Jew &gt;&gt; coming to deal with a Samaritan. &gt;&gt; It was the predestinated word. Yes. &gt;&gt; It was the predestinated word coming to quicken the predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why am I here tonight?" Because it wasn't a Baptist Jesus. It wasn't a Methodist Jesus. It wasn't a Pentecostal Jesus. It was the God of Abraham. It was the God of Isaac. It was the God of the Bible. And he wasn't coming to deal with the blood of the American blood or the Israelite blood or the Egypt blood or European blood. He was coming to deal with a seed on the inside of your heart. You know what I tell that devil tonight in closing? I say devil, you're too late. I say, devil, you're too late. I say, devil, you're too late. We already know what truth is. We already believe the message. We've already got the Holy Ghost. We already believe Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man through the bride's body. &gt;&gt; Devil, &gt;&gt; you're too late. &gt;&gt; Won't you stand on your feet tonight? &gt;&gt; Devil, &gt;&gt; you're too late. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you heard the word, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you heard the word &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you know where you come from. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; what was the truth, &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; My Thank you. &gt;&gt; I've often said it like this. Where, Brother Josh, did that baby eagle go get an education to know what an eagle scream sounded like? Come on. &gt;&gt; Fair enough question. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where did he go get a seat or go get a go get an education &gt;&gt; on what an eagle sounds like? &gt;&gt; He didn't &gt;&gt; because what was &gt;&gt; because what he needed to recognize the eagle scream was already in him. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When Mama Eagle flew over, she didn't teach him how to scream. &gt;&gt; She didn't teach him how to how to become an eagle. He always was an eagle. &gt;&gt; Reb said, "You know what was the truth?" He said, "You were always the seed was in you always." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Tell me one time the seed wasn't in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory, &gt;&gt; brother Allan. One time the seed wasn't in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; It was with you, too, buddy. &gt;&gt; We have too much fun. &gt;&gt; The seed was always in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, Benji. I don't mean to call you out, but when you was over there in that tradition of menite, when was the seed of God put in you? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word seen the word &gt;&gt; that was in you that was before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; saw the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you come to it. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, it might have not been the choice place that she wanted to meet the Messiah. &gt;&gt; But when God fixes something, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when God sets something up, &gt;&gt; he makes sure every detail's right. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple. &gt;&gt; But has it ever dawned on you, brother, since she was a filthy woman? &gt;&gt; He didn't meet her at the synagogue. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He didn't meet her down at the temple. &gt;&gt; He met her at the well. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was in a bad shape mentally and physically. But he met her at the well. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He said what happened? She discovered that scriptural fountain had spoken to her &gt;&gt; by scriptural sign &gt;&gt; that she had been looking for and she left Jacob's denominational system &gt;&gt; and never went back to it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; I can preach an hour right there. &gt;&gt; She didn't go get Dr. adoption's ideas and &gt;&gt; Pentecostal preachers ideas. &gt;&gt; She had found the real rock. &gt;&gt; She was through with sin. She was no more a foul woman. He said that sister might have been all right. It had served its purpose. But now she was at the true fountain. &gt;&gt; The sister had been all right until the true fountain was open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when the true fountain come along, [Music] &gt;&gt; the system lost its strength. &gt;&gt; She found a better place to drink. &gt;&gt; And there's a better place &gt;&gt; and that's in Christ. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew? &gt;&gt; I'm saying you're at the fountain tonight. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with your opportunity? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with your opportunity? What did she do with it? &gt;&gt; She threw down the bucket. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she recognized &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, I don't know if I've got an opportunity tonight." Well, I tell you what a prophet said. He said, "There's a fountain open plunging our souls beneath its crimson flow." &gt;&gt; To come up on the other side, washed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where we went in sinners, we come out saved. &gt;&gt; We go in sick and come out well. Oh God, we go in downtrodden, disheartened, weary, tossed about by every little thing and come out on the other side of &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Daryl, what a fountain. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "How we thank thee &gt;&gt; for this great opportunity." &gt;&gt; He said, "Thank God there's a fountain filled with blood." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now listen, Lord, you don't make church members. You make Christians out of them &gt;&gt; when they come &gt;&gt; to that fountain." &gt;&gt; Maybe you're like that woman at the well tonight. Maybe you're approaching these meetings downhearted, &gt;&gt; discouraged, downtrodden, weary, maybe sick and body. I don't know. &gt;&gt; But can I tell you something tonight? If you just start drinking right now, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll come out on the other side of these meetings established. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how many say tonight, Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to seize the golden opportunity. &gt;&gt; Tonight, Lord. Tonight, Lord. Not tomorrow. Not the next day. &gt;&gt; Right now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; She realized she was standing by the fountain of purity. &gt;&gt; She realized she was standing by the only thing that can forgive her. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Listen tonight, friends. Your standing is the only thing that can reveal to you truth. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "Ye shall know the truth, &gt;&gt; and the truth &gt;&gt; shall make you free." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I want you to bow your hearts with us tonight. I say this to you tonight on the first night of these meetings. Satan, he don't want you to give in. He don't want you to yield to the presence of God. Yeah. by the vindicated word. Satan, he don't want you to know what truth is. He don't want you to experience truth. He don't want you to really get a hold of truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He don't want this truth to come into your life because truth exposes him. Truth uncovers his hiding places. But you're got an opportunity tonight in the presence of truthless. &gt;&gt; God has allowed you to live another day. Give you another meeting. Give us another service. &gt;&gt; Let's not look at him and say, "What is truth?" &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's look at it tonight and say, "This is nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Brother Bram stands there and screams out, "Oh word believers, give in to my message. &gt;&gt; Hear me. Not my message, but his message." &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That he firmly declares to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You've got to choose from somewhere. You can't sit still after this. &gt;&gt; You've got to make your choice. I ask you tonight, what's your choice? What's your choice tonight? Morabus, denominational teachings, traditions, man's ideas, customs, rituals, formalisms, or truth. &gt;&gt; With every head bowed, every eye closed, you make your decision tonight. I choose truth. I want truth tonight. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want that same attitude, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want I want the power of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want the realities of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want I want the authority of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want the character of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I want the nature of my Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to be that body he has prepared. Almighty God, we're in your presence tonight by a divine promise. Lord, you made a covenant with your believing children that where two or three would gather in your name, there you would come and be in their midst. Now, Lord, the world tonight is confused. Religion is confused. Father, they've substituted realities with creeds. Lord, they've substituted revelation with traditions. Lord, they've substituted the blood with a handshake. They've replaced the Holy Ghost with just a church membership. And Lord, the world don't know what truth is. But Lord, we've had the privilege to stand in another Pilot's judgment hall. And Lord, we're not looking at the corporal body of our Lord Jesus and saying what is truth. But Lord, you've sent a prophet in this hour to open this book that we call the Bible, to open this sacred love letter, this historical book, this prophetic book. And Lord, you have come in the volume of this book. And Lord, you come to do the will of the father. And Lord, we're not gathered here tonight looking at this message and saying, "What is truth? What is truth?" &gt;&gt; But Lord, we're looking at this message and everything we're hearing a prophet say, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're saying that ain't nothing but a truth. &gt;&gt; And Lord, word is climbing and piling up on top of word and precept upon precept and line upon line. Lord, you're not building a building. You're building a bride. Yes, &gt;&gt; you're building a body, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray the power of the Holy Spirit that is so moved across this congregation tonight, Lord. Father, I believe you've moved among us in the preaching of your word, Lord, settling the atmosphere, Lord, making demons uncomfortable and removing them, Lord. Father, binding spirits of unbelief and binding plaguing spirits of fear and doubt. Lord, you've set this meeting up, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, you fixed it, Lord. Now, Lord, you've sent your word. And Father, I'm so thankful tonight that you've got a people. Lord, unlike Pilate, you got a people like that woman at the well. And we're at the right place at the right time. And you've come to deal with our hearts and lives. Father, may this meeting be more than just a meeting. Father, may it be more than just a gathering, Lord. Lord, may it be a place of transformation. May hearts be changed. &gt;&gt; May lives be changed. Oh God, move among us this weekend. Lord, &gt;&gt; reveal yourself. Lord, declare your presence. Father, without these believers, we couldn't have a meeting. But Lord, you've come in the flesh of your bride. Move among us in Jesus name. Amen. With every head bowed, every eye closed. I wonder if there'll be one tonight. Say, "Lord, I feel the tug. Lord, I feel that tug. Lord, let this be the meeting. Let this be the meeting that I come in downtrodded and discouraged and disheartened, sick and body, but I come out established. Thank you, &gt;&gt; I come out strengthened. I come out positioned. I come out renewed. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I come out refreshed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I come out not desiring the worldly water anymore. &gt;&gt; Lord, wash me &gt;&gt; in the waters of your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, search my heart, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, search my heart. &gt;&gt; How many say tonight, Lord, search my heart? &gt;&gt; Lord, send your word through this building in a powerful way, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, visit the men of God in their studies and visit them in their prayer times. And Lord, lay the things upon their heart that I have need of, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave here the same way. &gt;&gt; I want to leave here changed. &gt;&gt; I want to leave here strengthened, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to leave here refreshed. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's it tonight. God bless you there, sis. &gt;&gt; God bless you there, brother. &gt;&gt; He sees your hand tonight. &gt;&gt; He's right here in this building tonight. Jesus Christ, the son of God, is right here &gt;&gt; in divine presence tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's here to fulfill every promise of his word. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
