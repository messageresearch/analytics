========================================

and so now the word of God has to be the I am today the I am right now not the I am of yesterday not using something that would just be able to justify me for the day before yesterday and now I can use today as an excuse no because he's the I am he's always present amen verse 3 Acts chapter 1 verse 3 and it says to whom he has shown himself alive after this Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days speaking to the things speaking of the things pertaining of the kingdom of God excuse me I'm going to make a little parenthesis there speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God speaking of the things pertaining of the Promised Land the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is within us the kingdom of God is God's word being manifested in me and you and so why is it that we're atmosphere creators why is it that this word actually has to produce a divine presence it's because we're partaking of that nature and now it's no longer myself but it's the word and myself able to be able to to be lived in today hey man and it says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem so now he's given them a promise but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel how many times in our mind do we always think about this this this Kingdom as being this this another another world you know the kingdom of God is within us and so as we're starting to know the word of God we're starting to know of his kingdom because his kingdom is his word remember it was everything in the beginning in the garden I kept everything in perfectness it was the word it was the obedience to the word it was the word that was being obeyed that kept everything in order everything and it's perfect in its perfect creation right and and so it says but ye shall receive a power verse 8. after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be witness says unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost part of the Earth what was Joshua was he a witness of what he's saying was he testifying of the goodness that he was able to experience in this land where he was partaking of the fruit that he was eating he came back and he said come and see let me show you something I'm gonna I I've seen this I ate of this land he testified of his goodness he knew that what he was partaking of was nothing well but what the word had promised amen and when he has spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and when they looked steadfastly towards heaven he went up behold to two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye man of Galilee why standing gazing up into heaven the same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven and so we understand that even even our generation we've seen Christ himself descending coming down in this messenger and he was able to show the true identity of what this land possesses Saints he was the he was the first brother that came to maturity in this generation it was the message of the Lord on this prophet's mouth in his attitude in his atmosphere in what he was that made him who he was but he was the dedication to the word it was dedication in prayer it was a dedication just like he was a Believer like me and you he was believing the word just like me and you were and I know these are new these are not new things these are just things that we're just bringing to your remembrance but second Peter chapter 1 verses 10 to 12 says where wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall understanding in what Vision we're walking in understanding in what is carrying us understanding that is just not man's abilities to try to figure this stuff out yeah it's not something we figure out it's something that we experience and something that we actually know and God comes in my life personally that I've let go of this human ability and I've let go of this thing and I've let go of all these things that this was trying to press against me because the devil will always come and try to He he'll he'll come and tempt you I I know he does because he does it to me too but if we don't constantly stay in the word and keep that as a distraction now we get caught up into that stuff it says and if you do these things you shall never fall right for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ praise the Lord wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth and so we understand that it was by the preaching of the gospel because faith comes by hearing and so as we're feeding on this word now as we're partaking of this divine nature we're partaking of a land now that we're we're going to and so now we understand that just to bring it to to my train of thought and all of this the Lord just blessed me with brother Branham talking about this in the conflict between God and Satan 19 and 62. this is where I caught my inspiration and it's just amazing to see how God himself used the word himself to make sure that the promise would come to pass that's why the bride can't fall right because it's not me and you doing anything if we came from eternity and we're going back from eternity then it's Eternal Word eternity carrying us all the way through praise God amen and so I want you to understand that this word is greater than just us professing where's message believers there has to come a point in our life where we stand for what we say there has to come a point in my life where now I'm not just depending on a vocabulary that I'm using that I've grew up in but now there's a life that's being lived before this human flesh and now I can be an atmosphere creator where I can provide comfort where I can have peace and so if we're eating of this fruit because these are promises okay let's just pretend that I'm eating out of a grape the promise of joy I'm enjoying the promise of joy now now I'm actually experiencing the promise of joy and peace and this land that we can tap into and now uh take these promises of the Lord as something physical for us because that's what will change this body we have to have a transformation of this body right because it's corruptable and we have to get it to be Incorruptible to be pleasant in the front of the Lord right and so that means my carnal mind my carnal think it has to has to be gone away with brother bam says this in into the conflict between God and Satan he says then one day came The Greatest Warrior of all the Lord Jesus the son of God and he said there is a land where a man don't die in my father's house is many mentioned if it wasn't so I would have told you I go and prepare a place and return to receive you now he's the prophet that comes speaking of a land just beyond the river of Jordan all right it says even though you got your forms even though you got your families you're blessed of God but yet have to die but yet there's a land Beyond where you don't die oh my it says he came to kadish Barney or Calvary the Judgment seat again where the penalty of sin that caused men to die it was meant at Judgment at Candice Bernina everybody knows what happened at barnia he paid the penalty of sin died crossed Jordan the Jordan of death and Rose up on the third day now he said coming back he said feel me he says a spirit don't have Flesh and Bones like me you got something to eat he says he ate fish and bread and he was with them for 40 days proving like Joshua that the land was there this is what the prophet says here it says he's the evidence of the Land There Saints he says now he said all that will believe this come on it says go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned okay and now he's bringing it to present tense it says now under their Pentecost he sent back the earnest of this place the Assurance the evidence that this land is real just like Joshua brought it brought back the evidence that Jesus brought the evidence of the Holy Ghost now we reckon ourselves dead we're buried with him in baptism and his death it says it says we are buried with this bad okay and we raised with him in the resurrection and now we are in come on already now going to it says we're now we're raised oh my says we are now not will be we are now tonight sitting in Heavenly places how in Christ Jesus not we will be some other time we are now the church don't realize who they are see we are now right this minute sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus assembled together because he's always been about his word he's always been about himself having a union with the believer with his elect it was a personal relationship from the beginning if the musicians can come we're going to start winding down here but we understand that we've had the opening of the word in our generation the Lord came and showed himself in our generation just like he showed himself through all of these remembrance as a scripture testimonies that we've read in the scripture the word of God the promises that were said and now we understand that you know I was talking to brother then to brother Ben the other day and we were just talking about how you know the prophet there come a point in his life where you know you can hear it even on tapes on him testifying where he was talking about living into this other dimension more than he was living into this fleshly dimension [Music] and we realize that the more we live into the dimension of the word the more we feed on this land that we're going into the more we start being this land that we're inheriting brother bam says this in modern events are made clear by prophecy in 1965. but the real ordained of God the real Gene the real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world I don't know sayings that makes Meeks feel special something Rings within my heart when he talks about something like that because that just it just makes me so sure that there's something inside of me that just pulls back to that word the way that he describes it it says remember view that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was in Christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that it says look he was in Christ then if you were in God now this is how the prophet puts it it's so simple then if you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on Earth you talked with them on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary you Rose with him again and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus communing with him the word as he feeds into your soul that man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God but after you become a Christian the prophet says then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word it says few didn't know I was going to say that you are when you become a Christian your place behind the word of God see now there's your Fortress safety praise God every promise that is yours the only thing that you have to do is reach out and get it and go right with it how do you know it's going to work I don't have to know what's going to work explain to me I don't have to only thing I know is that God gave his children the best attack that he could have given him and the best attack with them that and it says and that's the word because he knows the working of the enemy because the enemy will always try to deceive the very elected if it would be possible by one word but we know that there was a record of this war that had never failed there was a record that we can go and reflect to and know that he's always been a wonderful he's he's never he's never been beaten by anybody he's an almighty God Amen let's just all stand but I want you tonight to just be honest with ourselves you know um there's nothing that we can hide from the Lord there's nothing that we can try to You Know cover up because if anybody knows and if anybody needs to know and so it's very important sometimes to be honest with ourselves and just just say Lord is my life lined up with the word Lord let me be my worst critic father maybe I just [Music] I don't spend much time in Reading I don't spend much time in testifying I don't spend much time with witnessing foreign Lord maybe you can get my heart to be on more on fire for you Lord [Music] you know as we're taken of these promises that he had given us [Music] as we're reaching into this land that he's provided for you that's full of milk and honey it's sweet it's Pleasant there's an atmosphere there that when you partake of that atmosphere you no longer become the same person the more you meet you meet the more of him he is in here the more of the word that we have in our life the more of God we are we have in our life brother bam says this in my closing statement you know I hope that you were encouraged tonight he says now what is the word of God [Music] the word of God is God himself so God gave the believer himself amen [Music] it's God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by in other words he's the father and the word is God then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children he says amen there you are standing out there for his children and then he's asking this question and I want you to just be honest with yourself what are you scared about [Music] what is your worry what are you scared about the prophet says this it says the Rapture sure they're coming is sure every blessing that has been promised is ours and belongs to us if we add faith if we start seeking for more of God the more of God we can be exposed in this true genuine word in this generation showing that this word lives let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord You Know My Heart Lord and you know that Lord this was just burning on My Heart Lord Lord I hope that whatever was said was encouraging to your bride Lord It's a privilege for me to sit here Lord and Lord just speak of these things to your bride the Bride of Jesus Christ the one that's spotless the one that's without wrinkle Lord we are here Lord all together in one mind and one Accord knowing Lord that it was your word that led us all the way to this point and so Lord I pray now Lord that as there's a heart maybe there's somebody individual and our myths tonight that just wants to have a closer relationship with you maybe there's more desire to get closer into a presence Lord that we can create Lord we're tired of just saying Lord that we're just message Believers Lord Lord I want this life inside of me Lord to just be able to reflect Christ so much Lord where I would be able to die out to myself daily die out to my own thoughts and my own ideas and put all these things aside to understand Lord but there's nothing that man could live by but it's by your true unadulterated word of God and so Lord I would rather have your word on my lips than any other word Lord Jesus Lord we thank you for taking us in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Lord Lord we're so thankful Lord that as we're dwelling in that presence now we're able to expose and and reflect that atmosphere Lord I pray that you get us closer to you Lord I pray that you encourage us Lord Lord that you continue to be with us as even we depart and we may go to our home and everybody just goes to their home Lord let that Stills my voice continue to lead your people Lord as they're just seeking your truth as they're just Lord trying to get closer to you Lord I pray that you just continue to lead them Lord that you would just [Music] show your word
