[53:53] amen isn't god good thank the lord
[53:58] i know um we had a time on wednesday
[54:01] night and
[54:02] but i you know we can be just as free in
[54:05] the spirit this morning and i feel that
[54:07] same freedom here today and
[54:11] just let god do what god does
[54:14] don't ever hold back and say well what
[54:17] will people think about me no just
[54:18] worship the lord he
[54:20] he's worthy of all of our praise and so
[54:23] we're thankful
[54:24] for that today amen let's turn to joel
[54:26] chapter 2
[54:28] verse 23 while you're turning there with
[54:32] me this morning i
[54:35] uh have been in touch with some people
[54:38] about brother brown and
[54:40] brother brown was our first pastor
[54:43] really and when i was very young and he
[54:44] was
[54:46] a has been a great example to me over
[54:48] the years and
[54:51] he's in the hospital today and
[54:54] and they've done just about everything
[54:56] they can do for him
[54:58] but we know that there's a great
[54:59] physician do you believe that today
[55:02] some of y'all can testify to that here's
[55:04] a great physician
[55:06] amen i believe we could all testify
[55:09] that and so brother brown's there and
[55:12] they've done all they can do and keeping
[55:13] him comfortable but
[55:15] we believe god can still move on his
[55:16] behalf so be praying especially for him
[55:19] and
[55:20] for the church he's been there for
[55:21] probably more than 50 years and
[55:23] and so a man that's been there that long
[55:25] means a lot to that church and that
[55:27] community
[55:28] and to me and my family as well so be
[55:30] praying for that church and i know
[55:33] god hears and answers prayer amen
[55:37] amen so um just be praying for that
[55:40] situation i
[55:42] may or may not be here wednesday night
[55:44] alan's going to preach i was going to
[55:45] have him preach anyway
[55:47] but i may or may not be there y'all pray
[55:49] for me i'm having a hard time even
[55:50] talking this morning
[55:52] i guess it's all that shouting we did on
[55:54] wednesday night
[55:57] but we uh i may or may not be here on
[56:00] wednesday on wednesday because i've got
[56:02] a funeral this week and they're
[56:03] having a hard time they were going to
[56:04] have it on tuesday but they're having a
[56:06] hard time getting the body back
[56:09] from colorado where the man passed away
[56:12] and i have to travel several hours to do
[56:14] the funeral so if i'm not here wednesday
[56:16] night that'll be why and be praying for
[56:18] that family as well
[56:19] unexpectedly lost a loved one let's go
[56:22] to joel chapter 2
[56:24] and verse 23
[56:27] it says be glad then you children of
[56:29] zion and rejoice in the lord your god
[56:32] amen be glad and rejoice could we do
[56:35] that this morning
[56:37] be glad then you children of zion
[56:39] rejoice in the lord your god for if
[56:41] given you
[56:42] the former rain moderately and he will
[56:45] cause to come down for you the rain
[56:47] the former rain and the latter rain in
[56:49] the first month
[56:50] and the floors should be full of wheat
[56:52] and the vat should overflow with wine
[56:55] and oil i will restore to you the years
[56:59] that the locusts have eaten
[57:01] the cankerworm and the palmer worm the
[57:04] caterpillar and the palmer worm my great
[57:06] army which i sent among you
[57:08] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[57:11] and praise the name of the lord your god
[57:13] that dealt wondrously with you and my
[57:15] people shall never be
[57:17] ashamed i pray the lord would add his
[57:19] blessing to the word you may be seated
[57:21] this morning
[57:24] as we said last sunday the central
[57:28] question
[57:30] for the believer today for the christian
[57:32] today
[57:34] is have we been restored we could put it
[57:37] this way
[57:38] it has god kept his word is the promise
[57:42] true and you know there's a time
[57:45] there's a season for the giving of
[57:48] promises and then there's a season
[57:50] for receiving the promise and and the
[57:53] promise being fulfilled
[57:55] there's a season of planting there's a
[57:56] season of reaping
[57:58] we're not living in a season of planting
[58:00] we're living
[58:01] in a season when god fulfills the
[58:04] promises that he's already made
[58:07] so it's not that he's making promises
[58:09] he's made
[58:10] promises and he fulfills them
[58:13] today amen because he's the same
[58:16] yesterday today and forever and so the
[58:18] god of the promise
[58:20] is the god who fulfills the promise
[58:23] and so i could say for me we have been
[58:26] restored
[58:28] by the message of malachi 4 god did
[58:31] what he promised he would do now you you
[58:34] know the greatest
[58:35] argument that you can make about is the
[58:36] scripture true i could argue about my
[58:39] interpretation of scripture versus
[58:40] your interpretation of scripture but it
[58:43] really wouldn't mean that much
[58:44] to you because you know my opinion is as
[58:47] good as yours
[58:48] yours is as good as mine but when god
[58:51] interprets his word by
[58:53] bringing it to pass that's something
[58:57] different
[58:58] are you with me this morning that's
[59:00] something entirely different
[59:01] it's not god just me taking it and
[59:04] saying well this is what it means
[59:06] but it's god fulfilling his word
[59:09] but when god does that many times it
[59:11] goes over the minds
[59:13] and the eyes of the wise and the prudent
[59:15] it's hid from them
[59:16] because he promised him that he would do
[59:17] that he promised us he said why
[59:20] doesn't everybody see the message why
[59:22] can't everybody see
[59:24] what god's doing why can't everybody
[59:25] somebody might sit in a service like
[59:27] that wednesday night
[59:28] not feel anything not not see anything
[59:30] say i don't these people are crazy
[59:32] but you see not everybody has that
[59:35] access that you have like
[59:36] brother andrew talked about to be able
[59:38] to know what god's doing
[59:40] not everybody can feel it and they may
[59:42] be good people but not everybody can
[59:44] know it
[59:44] but for us it can it's a fulfillment of
[59:47] god's word
[59:49] but the very fact that some don't was
[59:51] prophesied
[59:53] right that was prophesied there has to
[59:55] be those that don't in fact the majority
[59:57] would not because he said in such an
[59:59] hour as you think not
[1:00:01] that's when the son of man comes that's
[1:00:04] when the son of man is revealed
[1:00:06] and so we find all to the scripture this
[1:00:10] promise of restoration
[1:00:12] a promise that god would do what he said
[1:00:14] he would do
[1:00:15] and it's kind of like the children of
[1:00:16] israel when they were waiting there
[1:00:18] there was a time when god said i'll give
[1:00:20] you a land
[1:00:20] there'll be a land flowing with milk and
[1:00:22] honey they were down in egypt for 400
[1:00:25] years
[1:00:26] but finally there come a time when that
[1:00:28] promise began to be fulfilled
[1:00:30] and when it began to be fulfilled joshua
[1:00:32] goes into the land
[1:00:34] and he can have confidence to take the
[1:00:35] land because this is the hour of
[1:00:38] fulfillment
[1:00:39] if you look at jesus for many many years
[1:00:41] they went without a prophet
[1:00:43] they went without a miracle they went
[1:00:44] without anything
[1:00:46] they didn't have a single visitation
[1:00:48] from god that we know of for 400 years
[1:00:52] amen until god said it's time
[1:00:56] right and when god says it's time that's
[1:00:59] it
[1:01:00] right it's time you might pray for
[1:01:03] somebody for years
[1:01:05] you might you might you might struggle
[1:01:07] you might try to get them to understand
[1:01:09] you might you might get down on your
[1:01:11] knees over and over again say god
[1:01:12] why why are they not done but hold on
[1:01:15] because when god says it's time
[1:01:17] it's time
[1:01:21] amen god said it was time
[1:01:24] and all of a sudden the word that was
[1:01:26] planted a virgin shall conceive
[1:01:29] become reality a virgin conceived
[1:01:34] now you say well if god did that then it
[1:01:36] would be absolutely provable
[1:01:38] by science no because no one knew but
[1:01:41] mary
[1:01:44] joseph even had to believe it
[1:01:48] right there's no you're never going to
[1:01:50] be able to scientifically get every word
[1:01:52] and everything just right where you're
[1:01:53] just going to be able to accept it
[1:01:54] joseph had to believe it he had to
[1:01:57] believe that the angel that come to him
[1:01:58] in a dream was telling him the truth
[1:02:01] he had to believe that mary's story was
[1:02:03] true amen
[1:02:05] amen and what does that tell us today
[1:02:06] it's a personal identification you know
[1:02:09] it
[1:02:10] but everybody else don't know it all
[1:02:13] they see is the effects of it
[1:02:16] so we can say have we been restored are
[1:02:18] we there yet
[1:02:20] have we passed have we come to these
[1:02:21] stages do we see the bark on the tree
[1:02:24] and
[1:02:24] the life in the tree do we see the the
[1:02:26] leaves on the tree do we see the fruit
[1:02:28] of the tree
[1:02:30] have we been restored by the message of
[1:02:32] malachi 4.
[1:02:34] amen now jesus gives a parable in luke
[1:02:39] chapter 18.
[1:02:40] you can go read the whole thing sometime
[1:02:42] but i'll just read the last three verses
[1:02:44] to save time
[1:02:46] but he gives a parable that i've used
[1:02:48] with you before but it's the parable of
[1:02:49] the unjust judge you remember
[1:02:52] this with a woman that comes and she
[1:02:54] petitions
[1:02:55] over and over again to an unjust judge
[1:02:58] and the unjust judge finally said okay
[1:03:00] she won't quit bothering me
[1:03:01] i'll let her have what she's asking for
[1:03:04] right and what she's asking for
[1:03:06] is a restoration she's requiring a
[1:03:09] restoration she's asking him
[1:03:12] over and over avenge me and that doesn't
[1:03:14] mean get revenge for me but what it
[1:03:16] means is
[1:03:16] my property was stolen i want it back
[1:03:21] so there's a squatter on my property and
[1:03:23] somebody they've taken and
[1:03:24] and i want it back and he he gave it to
[1:03:26] her even though she didn't really have
[1:03:28] any rights
[1:03:30] because the bible says she was a widow
[1:03:32] and that tells us that she wouldn't have
[1:03:33] inherited
[1:03:35] directly right and so she's a widow
[1:03:39] and i want you to think about that and
[1:03:41] and then we find out that
[1:03:43] if you go back but there's another widow
[1:03:45] in scripture you go back to ruth
[1:03:47] ruth did inherit how did she inherit by
[1:03:50] marrying boaz
[1:03:52] right so she was no longer a widow i
[1:03:54] preached a sermon on that one time no
[1:03:56] longer a widow
[1:03:57] she's no longer a widow she she once
[1:03:59] she's married
[1:04:01] she has full restoration oh that's the
[1:04:03] age we live in church
[1:04:06] but now here's this this widow woman
[1:04:08] crying out
[1:04:09] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:04:11] judge saith
[1:04:12] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[1:04:15] so he uses the extreme example here's a
[1:04:17] widow woman with no rights
[1:04:19] and an unjust judge
[1:04:22] right with a woman with no rights an
[1:04:24] unjust judge
[1:04:26] and he says he even heard her prayer
[1:04:30] her cry for restoration
[1:04:33] how much more amen
[1:04:36] shall not god avenge his own elect amen
[1:04:40] which cry they and i they do have rights
[1:04:43] they do have a standing in court they do
[1:04:47] have a legal right
[1:04:48] to stand there and ask for their healing
[1:04:50] ask for their salvation
[1:04:52] ask for what what they need do you
[1:04:53] believe that this morning
[1:04:55] i've got a legal right to stand and do
[1:04:57] that i've got a legal right to
[1:04:58] to require god to ask god to give me
[1:05:01] what i have need of
[1:05:02] and he said he would do it i have a
[1:05:05] right understanding i'm
[1:05:06] no longer a widow i'm not just asking
[1:05:09] for that but it's been restored to me
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:12] and it's come to the place where now
[1:05:14] you're his wife you've been married to
[1:05:16] christ the word you're not
[1:05:17] going out there petitioning like a widow
[1:05:19] to an unjust judge
[1:05:20] you're coming to god and picking up off
[1:05:22] the shelf what you have need of
[1:05:25] you're signing your name to the check
[1:05:26] it's yours
[1:05:29] amen it's not somebody else's it's not
[1:05:33] for another age it's mine
[1:05:34] it's been restored
[1:05:37] and so he says i tell you he will avenge
[1:05:39] them speedily
[1:05:41] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:05:44] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:05:48] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:05:51] now brother branham picks that up and
[1:05:54] reads that entire story and the anointed
[1:05:56] ones at the end time and he picks that
[1:05:58] up and he says this
[1:05:59] he said now that's the question
[1:06:02] that's the question here's what i wanted
[1:06:05] to get to he said in revelation 10
[1:06:08] he said in the days of the message of
[1:06:09] the seventh angel the mystery god ought
[1:06:11] to be finished
[1:06:12] here is the question is if you follow in
[1:06:16] that line in this
[1:06:17] hour will it be finished
[1:06:21] will i find the faith and you ask this
[1:06:24] question will malachi 4
[1:06:26] be fulfilled in this time
[1:06:30] restore the faith of the children back
[1:06:32] to the faith of the fathers
[1:06:34] the original the word
[1:06:37] now i want to tell you this morning that
[1:06:39] malachi 4 being fulfilled
[1:06:41] is more than the pro the malachi 4
[1:06:44] prophet elijah prophet coming
[1:06:48] all right there's more to malachi 4.
[1:06:52] what does the scripture say behold i
[1:06:54] send you elijah
[1:06:56] right elijah coming is part of that
[1:06:58] fulfillment
[1:07:00] but it says he shall turn the hearts of
[1:07:02] the children
[1:07:04] back to the fathers so if it was elijah
[1:07:09] amen amen if he was there you know
[1:07:14] if i am at home my wife knows
[1:07:17] if i've been there because there's
[1:07:19] certain things i do
[1:07:21] if i'm there and even more so
[1:07:24] there's a much more stark contrast if
[1:07:26] i'm not at home or my wife's not at home
[1:07:29] for a while
[1:07:30] and we've rarely been separated as far
[1:07:32] as being away and her being away but
[1:07:34] just
[1:07:35] i believe once she was away for a few
[1:07:36] days and
[1:07:38] and with her being out of the house for
[1:07:39] a few days the house looks much
[1:07:41] different
[1:07:44] we'll just stop there but a lot of
[1:07:47] things don't get done
[1:07:49] right because i work and do whatever you
[1:07:51] know i've got my excuses but
[1:07:54] when my wife's not there it looks much
[1:07:56] different you can tell when she's been
[1:07:58] there
[1:07:59] how would you tell if elijah had been
[1:08:02] here
[1:08:03] right if elijah was in the room how
[1:08:06] would you tell us my wife's in the room
[1:08:07] the dishes get washed the
[1:08:08] clothes get picked up you understand
[1:08:11] right she does what a wife does
[1:08:13] she fills that office oh my
[1:08:17] and if i'm in a place certain things get
[1:08:20] done there's things that you care about
[1:08:22] that's why if you put a different ceo
[1:08:24] over a company you put a new boss in
[1:08:26] there's different things they'll care
[1:08:27] about a certain person comes in that
[1:08:29] person will do certain things
[1:08:31] amen you've all been if you've ever
[1:08:33] worked in a fast food restaurant or
[1:08:35] someplace where they have a boss
[1:08:36] and the boss leaves for a while
[1:08:38] everybody acts like they want to but if
[1:08:39] the boss is in the room things are
[1:08:41] different
[1:08:43] amen oh don't you realize how would we
[1:08:45] know that malachi 4 was fulfilled how
[1:08:47] would we know that elijah come because
[1:08:49] the hearts
[1:08:50] of individuals amen
[1:08:54] me and you but joe but isaac you and i
[1:08:57] the hearts of individuals said
[1:08:59] and it's not just the emotion of it but
[1:09:01] it's the whole package you understand
[1:09:03] we can have a service like we did
[1:09:04] wednesday night and we can live like we
[1:09:07] did thursday
[1:09:09] right why because amen not by any merit
[1:09:12] of our own
[1:09:13] but god fulfilled his promise
[1:09:18] hey man you say well i can point to many
[1:09:20] others that don't but if he did it in
[1:09:22] one person
[1:09:25] amen amen he's done it
[1:09:28] only one amen only one virgin had to
[1:09:31] conceive
[1:09:32] for god to keep his promise if it was
[1:09:35] just one but i believe it's many more
[1:09:37] than one
[1:09:38] but if he did it in one person it proves
[1:09:41] that he does it
[1:09:44] amen hallelujah so if he's been here
[1:09:48] what should the room look like well the
[1:09:51] faith should be restored
[1:09:53] the bark should be back on the tree
[1:09:56] that's the question of the hour if he's
[1:09:58] been here
[1:09:58] what should our services be like
[1:10:02] if he's been here what kind of a joy
[1:10:05] should we have in our hearts
[1:10:06] if if we've been restored what kind of a
[1:10:09] people want me to be walking every day
[1:10:11] what kind of a faith should we have if
[1:10:13] it's been restored hallelujah
[1:10:19] he's been here have the hearts of the
[1:10:22] children where the children
[1:10:24] been turned back to the pentecostal
[1:10:26] fathers
[1:10:28] are we there yet luke 4 and 20.
[1:10:32] it says that he closed the book and this
[1:10:35] is jesus when he read the scripture
[1:10:37] that spoke of how the blind would
[1:10:39] receive their sight and the poor would
[1:10:40] have the gospel preached to them and
[1:10:43] all these things he closed the book and
[1:10:45] he gave it again to the minister and sat
[1:10:46] down
[1:10:48] and there's a parallel in brother
[1:10:49] branham's ministry to this and you all
[1:10:50] know
[1:10:51] in birth pains when brother branham
[1:10:52] preaches that and he comes and tells us
[1:10:54] later
[1:10:55] but says the eyes of all them that were
[1:10:57] in the synagogue were fastened on him
[1:10:59] and began to say unto them this day is
[1:11:03] this scripture
[1:11:04] fulfilled in your ears this day
[1:11:08] is this scripture fulfilled so in this
[1:11:12] day
[1:11:12] that this scripture was to be fulfilled
[1:11:14] he was to be a certain thing
[1:11:16] messiah when messiah would come and see
[1:11:18] that's what the
[1:11:19] woman at the well recognized when the
[1:11:22] priests didn't
[1:11:24] because she had representation in heaven
[1:11:29] in a place where they don't even though
[1:11:32] they they understood
[1:11:33] more about it a scholar listen
[1:11:37] if i become a greater scholar all the
[1:11:39] language i'd have it all right they
[1:11:41] understood it
[1:11:43] and got it all wrong
[1:11:47] they knew every little letter of it and
[1:11:49] got it all wrong but there was a little
[1:11:51] woman
[1:11:52] amen amen sitting by
[1:11:55] well she's sitting there she don't have
[1:11:58] anything going for her
[1:12:00] everything's gone wrong and he begins to
[1:12:02] tell her your name is
[1:12:06] amen you belong in a certain place you
[1:12:08] you've got five husbands the one you're
[1:12:10] living with now is not your husband
[1:12:13] very bad hey man what what what is it
[1:12:16] who did that she said i perceive you're
[1:12:18] a prophet
[1:12:19] and something inside of her that
[1:12:21] representation caught an idea or
[1:12:24] a thought and said well when messiah
[1:12:26] comes
[1:12:28] amen when messiah comes he's supposed to
[1:12:31] do these things and he said this day
[1:12:34] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:12:37] amen hallelujah
[1:12:40] this day this scripture is fulfilled i
[1:12:42] am he that speaketh unto you
[1:12:45] amen now brother branham
[1:12:48] brings it down and he preaches a sermon
[1:12:51] called this day this scripture is
[1:12:52] fulfilled he brings it down
[1:12:54] into this day he said but in this day
[1:12:58] there is to come a super royal seed of
[1:13:00] abraham
[1:13:02] that's exactly what it would be would be
[1:13:04] a royal bride to the royal
[1:13:06] promised son amen
[1:13:09] i got to look and we may not get through
[1:13:11] much of this today but i
[1:13:13] i feel good amen isn't it good to have
[1:13:14] the freedom of the spirit in our midst
[1:13:16] amen i got to looking at the
[1:13:20] at the funeral the other day for prince
[1:13:22] philip
[1:13:24] and his great the royals that were there
[1:13:27] how different they were
[1:13:29] how they carry themselves they don't
[1:13:31] just do what other people do
[1:13:34] because they feel the burden of that
[1:13:36] maybe in some cases they're worse than
[1:13:37] other people but in public you look at
[1:13:39] them and watch how they carry themselves
[1:13:41] and think we're the royal seed of
[1:13:42] abraham
[1:13:44] we're different than the world and it's
[1:13:47] not because listen none of those people
[1:13:49] did anything to make themselves royal
[1:13:50] they were born into the family
[1:13:54] very bad they couldn't do nothing about
[1:13:56] it they had nothing to do with it they
[1:13:58] just were born in the family when you're
[1:13:59] born in the family
[1:14:00] you're supposed to act like the family
[1:14:02] acts
[1:14:05] you know if you're in the royal family
[1:14:06] they even have a dress code
[1:14:08] they even tell you what you can wear
[1:14:09] what you can't wear what time when you
[1:14:11] where you can go and where you can't go
[1:14:13] you're at the service that you're bound
[1:14:15] to do certain things at certain times of
[1:14:17] the year
[1:14:17] that's why so many people have from the
[1:14:19] outside they have such a problem with it
[1:14:21] because they realize their whole life is
[1:14:22] controlled
[1:14:24] or but church don't you realize if
[1:14:26] you're the royal seed of abraham
[1:14:27] your life is not controlled by a
[1:14:29] preacher it's not controlled by a church
[1:14:30] but it's controlled
[1:14:31] by the holy spirit where everything you
[1:14:34] do everything you say why you're the
[1:14:36] royal seed of abraham
[1:14:38] you're a royal bride to a royal promised
[1:14:39] son he said as i spoke last night it
[1:14:42] won't be a natural seed
[1:14:43] it'll be a spiritual seed amen
[1:14:47] there's no natural royalty in this
[1:14:49] message it's a spiritual seed
[1:14:51] there is to be a spiritual bride raise
[1:14:54] up
[1:14:55] we can believe a prophet or not but this
[1:14:57] is what he said
[1:14:58] there is to be a spiritual bride raise
[1:15:00] up which will be the royal seat
[1:15:03] of the royal faith of abraham's royal
[1:15:04] son she is to come on the scene
[1:15:08] in the last days hallelujah
[1:15:12] and the time and the place is the
[1:15:14] promise that's given to her
[1:15:18] what promise the promise of the malachi
[1:15:21] 4 restoration
[1:15:23] right because brother branham goes on to
[1:15:24] say that the time and the place is a
[1:15:26] promise to her
[1:15:28] that's he said according to malachi 4 a
[1:15:31] scripture there is to rise a message
[1:15:33] that will shake the hearts of the people
[1:15:34] right back to the apostolic fathers
[1:15:36] again
[1:15:36] and there is to rise one on the scene in
[1:15:39] the power of elijah
[1:15:41] that will rise on the scene a wilderness
[1:15:43] man that will come out
[1:15:44] and will have a message that will run
[1:15:45] right straight back to the word again
[1:15:48] why because it's time for the bride to
[1:15:50] come out
[1:15:51] it's time for this royal seed hey man
[1:15:54] it's time for the
[1:15:55] and this is the promise the place the
[1:15:58] time of the place is a promise that's
[1:15:59] given to her what time in what place
[1:16:01] when elijah comes then it's her time
[1:16:06] amen you know john stood there and he
[1:16:10] said i'm here
[1:16:11] preparing away i'm a
[1:16:14] decrease so that he can increase if i'm
[1:16:17] here
[1:16:18] it means he's here
[1:16:23] amen if i'm here
[1:16:28] i have to introduce him hallelujah if
[1:16:31] i'm here it means he's here
[1:16:35] thank you lord jesus if i'm here it
[1:16:38] means he's here
[1:16:39] if the elijah malachi for prophet came
[1:16:42] it means
[1:16:42] he's here the bridegroom is here
[1:16:49] oh my now look
[1:16:52] and yes there'll be a corporal body
[1:16:54] there will be a coming of the lord but
[1:16:55] you understand he's here
[1:16:57] because he he was introduced to us
[1:17:01] he introduced us to christ by the word
[1:17:03] now look
[1:17:05] and brother brown said that's the hour
[1:17:06] that we're living in now the random goes
[1:17:08] on in that sermon and begins to talk
[1:17:10] about events from his own ministry
[1:17:13] and a prophet can do that i believe we
[1:17:16] can do that
[1:17:19] god said he would he would save you
[1:17:23] and you can point back to a time in your
[1:17:25] life you say this day this scripture is
[1:17:28] fulfilled god did that
[1:17:32] god promised that he would save you from
[1:17:33] your sins god promised he would heal you
[1:17:36] and many of you can point back to a time
[1:17:37] in your life and say i know
[1:17:39] that day
[1:17:42] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:45] right he promised he would do certain
[1:17:47] things and a prophet of god stood there
[1:17:49] and looked at his own ministry and said
[1:17:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:54] there are certain things that have taken
[1:17:55] place
[1:17:56] and it's been vindicated in other words
[1:17:59] the
[1:18:00] the vindication is the fulfillment of it
[1:18:03] god interpreting his word by bringing it
[1:18:05] to pass
[1:18:07] and he says this these promises that was
[1:18:09] made
[1:18:10] all these promises have been vindicated
[1:18:13] and fulfilled by the god of the promise
[1:18:20] look what he says he says look hanging
[1:18:23] in washington dc tonight the picture of
[1:18:25] the angel
[1:18:26] of the lord he goes through that and
[1:18:27] then he talks about that and then he
[1:18:29] talks about the tucson vision how he's
[1:18:31] supposed to go west
[1:18:33] and he picks it back up he said how many
[1:18:34] remembers that here way before it
[1:18:36] happened
[1:18:36] there's men sitting right here in this
[1:18:38] building tonight was standing right
[1:18:39] there when it happened
[1:18:40] he said and the seven seals of the
[1:18:43] hidden mysteries of the entire bible

[1:18:46] and fulfill revelation 10 that in the
[1:18:49] seventh angels message
[1:18:51] these things should come to pass
[1:18:55] he said wait a minute brother brother
[1:18:56] ben i've been taught that a certain
[1:18:58] thing parts of that there are certain
[1:18:59] things that weren't fulfilled what did
[1:19:00] the prophet of god say

[1:19:16] he said where are we at in this
[1:19:18] abrahamic age what a way to put it
[1:19:23] this is an age of faith this is an age
[1:19:26] as i said of the fulfilling of promises
[1:19:28] it's not an age and so many people don't
[1:19:30] get that they don't understand it so
[1:19:31] they're worried
[1:19:32] costly but brother branham tried so hard
[1:19:34] to get that fear away from people
[1:19:36] that scare away from people you don't
[1:19:38] have to worry you don't have to make it
[1:19:40] happen

[1:19:57] done it
[1:19:59] amen and it's you and i get to live in
[1:20:02] that
[1:20:04] we get to live in the fulfillment of
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:09] you know it's kind of hard to sell if
[1:20:11] you walk around dark and depressed and
[1:20:13] gloomy all the time i know we go through
[1:20:18] things
[1:20:19] i go through things but look we're still
[1:20:21] human but this day

[1:20:35] against us everybody
[1:20:36] turning against us we can rejoice amen
[1:20:39] why because we know
[1:20:41] god is fulfilling his word this is an
[1:20:43] abrahamic age
[1:20:45] this is an age of faith a perfect faith
[1:20:49] where are we he said in this great time
[1:20:51] we're standing
[1:20:52] the great hour that we're living in
[1:20:55] listen
[1:20:56] he said all the visions has been
[1:20:59] fulfilled
[1:21:01] amen all the visions has been fulfilled
[1:21:05] he goes back and tells about brother
[1:21:07] junior jackson's dream
[1:21:09] and how that they took the crowbar and
[1:21:11] he said there was a
[1:21:12] a rock like a pyramid he took the
[1:21:14] crowbar and he popped off the top of it
[1:21:16] and he pointed down in there he said
[1:21:17] look on that
[1:21:19] you remember and some of them stood
[1:21:20] there he said but the ones that didn't
[1:21:22] remain they
[1:21:23] they fell off the wayside but there was
[1:21:24] some that stayed there
[1:21:27] and looked at what had been revealed
[1:21:30] and so that that was uh junior jackson's
[1:21:33] dream
[1:21:34] and he talked about that he said i stood
[1:21:35] there a little bit till the holy spirit
[1:21:37] revealed it
[1:21:38] he said i said the entire bible as much
[1:21:41] as has been revealed
[1:21:42] to man through justification
[1:21:44] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:21:45] ghost the baptism in jesus name
[1:21:47] all these things has been revealed
[1:21:51] hallelujah now and he goes back and
[1:21:54] he's thinking at the time because he's
[1:21:56] going back he said but there's secrets
[1:21:57] that's hit inside
[1:21:58] because the bible is still with seven
[1:22:00] seals i must go there to find it he said
[1:22:02] that morning when those seven angels
[1:22:03] come down
[1:22:04] and blasted the earth and rocks flew
[1:22:05] every way seven angels stood there and
[1:22:07] said return back to jeffersonville from
[1:22:09] where you come
[1:22:10] from the seven seals of the seven
[1:22:11] mysteries will be open
[1:22:13] and he said here we are today
[1:22:21] he said brother ben can you get excited
[1:22:24] about god doing that so many years ago
[1:22:25] yes
[1:22:28] i still get excited about what god did
[1:22:30] when he kept his promise to abraham
[1:22:34] hallelujah when that baby was born to a
[1:22:37] 90 year old woman i still get excited
[1:22:39] about what god did amen
[1:22:40] when he opened up the red sea i still
[1:22:42] get excited about what god did
[1:22:44] when he brought a baby to bethlehem and
[1:22:46] i still get excited about what god did
[1:22:48] in tucson what god did in jeffersonville
[1:22:50] but let me tell you what makes me more
[1:22:52] excited today
[1:22:53] let me tell you what makes me more
[1:22:54] excited is to see god fulfilling his
[1:22:56] word
[1:22:57] right now in 2021 god is still
[1:23:00] fulfilling his word we can say
[1:23:02] this day this scripture is being
[1:23:04] fulfilled
[1:23:06] hallelujah why because that royal seed
[1:23:07] had to come that that pride had
[1:23:09] had to come someone's heart had to be
[1:23:12] turned back
[1:23:13] and when you begin to see hearts being
[1:23:15] turned you can say
[1:23:16] the message still works
[1:23:20] amen elijah's still doing what he came
[1:23:24] to do
[1:23:26] the message of elijah you understand
[1:23:31] amen amen
[1:23:34] you know that's why we don't mess with
[1:23:35] it but the brandon talked about that in
[1:23:36] the sermon why i believe he talked about
[1:23:38] how we don't mess with the formula
[1:23:40] you know if there's a formula that peter
[1:23:42] gave on the day of pentecost said repent
[1:23:44] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:23:45] of jesus christ you shall receive the
[1:23:47] gift of the holy ghost
[1:23:48] had anything to that take anything away
[1:23:50] from it is death
[1:23:51] but it was just the right thing that's
[1:23:54] what god
[1:23:54] prescribed for the human race for the
[1:23:57] gentiles to be saved
[1:23:59] god prescribed that we don't want to
[1:24:02] mess with the formula that turns the
[1:24:04] hearts of the children back to the
[1:24:05] fathers
[1:24:07] right we don't want to mess with that
[1:24:10] god prescribed it we don't want to mess
[1:24:13] with this
[1:24:14] to me to mess with it but to give it out
[1:24:17] i'm a pharmacist
[1:24:20] you put it that way at the doctor amen
[1:24:22] the messenger to the age already said
[1:24:24] i had already spoke what was going to be
[1:24:26] said i'm a pharmacist all i do is look
[1:24:28] at a prescription
[1:24:29] and i find out what it says and i feel
[1:24:31] it
[1:24:33] amen and i've been specially trained i
[1:24:35] didn't go to bible school
[1:24:36] but i've been specially trained by the
[1:24:38] holy spirit to make sure that those
[1:24:40] instructions are followed
[1:24:42] amen you'd hate to have to sit there at
[1:24:45] home and and do all that by yourself but
[1:24:47] you get somebody
[1:24:48] who's specially trained and devoted to
[1:24:50] that that's what he does
[1:24:51] he goes in and he makes sure that the
[1:24:53] pharmacy gets it just right and the pill
[1:24:55] comes out just the way it's supposed to
[1:24:56] be
[1:24:56] and that's my job not to recreate a
[1:24:59] prescription
[1:25:00] but to be a pharmacist fill the
[1:25:03] prescription
[1:25:04] fill the prescription when you need
[1:25:06] healing amen
[1:25:08] fill the prescription when you need
[1:25:10] salvation fill the prescription when you
[1:25:12] need joy in your life
[1:25:13] feel the prescription i don't i can't
[1:25:14] make the medicine all i can do is fill
[1:25:16] the prescription
[1:25:19] amen but i got confidence
[1:25:23] amen because the longer i do it
[1:25:26] the more i see that when people in
[1:25:29] obedience take the prescription
[1:25:31] the way it's supposed to be taken it
[1:25:33] works
[1:25:37] and the people that tell me it don't
[1:25:38] work is the people that's never tried it
[1:25:43] people tell me that message don't work i
[1:25:44] was in the message but you never took
[1:25:46] the pill
[1:25:49] you never took the pill you never become
[1:25:51] the message you never let it become part
[1:25:53] of you
[1:25:54] you never did surrender yourself to it
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:57] and every person that i've ever seen
[1:25:59] surrender their life surrender their
[1:26:01] home
[1:26:01] surrender their family to the message of
[1:26:03] the hour to the pill that we've been
[1:26:04] given
[1:26:05] every person that i've seen surrender
[1:26:07] themselves to that their life changes
[1:26:09] their family changes
[1:26:10] their their their whole being changes
[1:26:13] yes they're a human being yes they're
[1:26:15] just a flesh body
[1:26:17] but there's something on the inside that
[1:26:19] goes far beyond that
[1:26:22] amen hey man
[1:26:25] how could we get back it's like a
[1:26:29] junkie you know they say that some of
[1:26:30] these junkies i've never taken drugs but
[1:26:32] they say that once you take one you want
[1:26:34] to find something better
[1:26:36] find something better find something
[1:26:37] better finally you find the ultimate
[1:26:40] and then it kills you it's the overdose
[1:26:44] but they're constantly looking for that
[1:26:46] that better hit that better
[1:26:47] they're addicted to that and it's hard
[1:26:50] they won't turn around from that
[1:26:52] how would i ever turn around from what
[1:26:54] i've received from god
[1:26:56] he keeps giving it to me giving it to me
[1:26:59] give it to every time it's greater it's
[1:27:00] greater it's greater
[1:27:02] yes i have struggles yes my family's
[1:27:04] been through it there have been times i
[1:27:06] didn't obey
[1:27:06] there have been times i didn't do it
[1:27:08] right but he keeps giving and he keeps
[1:27:09] giving it
[1:27:10] every time i go to church and hear the
[1:27:11] prescription something begins to happen
[1:27:13] in my heart
[1:27:14] something begins to take place inside of
[1:27:15] me and it begins to become real
[1:27:18] oh man i'm walking around like a junkie
[1:27:20] i want more of it i gotta have more of
[1:27:22] it i gotta be in those kind of services
[1:27:24] i gotta have that kind of word i gotta
[1:27:26] listen to the message of the hour
[1:27:27] why it's me amen
[1:27:33] take it until those things seem more
[1:27:35] real than the things of this world
[1:27:39] hallelujah
[1:27:43] amen you believe he's still here today
[1:27:48] brother branham
[1:27:52] i'm telling you church you never know
[1:27:54] when
[1:27:55] the prescription might be handed out
[1:27:56] that you need
[1:27:59] might come on wednesday night might be
[1:28:00] on a sunday morning you never know
[1:28:04] when the prescription might be handed
[1:28:05] out that you need
[1:28:09] you know what and and god just gives us
[1:28:11] what we have need of and i
[1:28:13] was sitting there wednesday night i'm
[1:28:14] thinking i haven't ever in a meeting
[1:28:16] anywhere and there's just
[1:28:16] maybe 40 of us sitting here but probably
[1:28:20] less than 50
[1:28:21] but in that service i've never felt the
[1:28:24] presence of god
[1:28:25] more than i felt right there
[1:28:30] never and i said god
[1:28:34] i believe there's some more
[1:28:37] maybe this morning just right in here as
[1:28:39] brother david said even in the quietness
[1:28:41] of the service you can sit here
[1:28:42] and just receive something from god
[1:28:44] there's more if i've ever had it i can't
[1:28:46] get that hit of it i want more
[1:28:51] there's a whole world opening up to me
[1:28:53] are you here are you with me this
[1:28:54] morning a whole world opening up to me
[1:28:56] there's more
[1:28:57] of the word there's more for me to
[1:28:59] receive
[1:29:01] notice brother branham said here we are
[1:29:04] today
[1:29:06] hallelujah understanding serpent seed
[1:29:09] he said in a few days if god willing
[1:29:11] will understand the correctness of
[1:29:12] marriage and divorce
[1:29:14] amen and all these things that god has
[1:29:17] opened
[1:29:18] every seal amen
[1:29:21] the mystery since the foundation of the
[1:29:24] world
[1:29:25] and where are we at and we've been in
[1:29:27] joy
[1:29:29] amen the presence of his blessings why
[1:29:32] god is fulfilling his word amen that is
[1:29:36] true he said this day
[1:29:37] this scripture
[1:29:43] we're doing all right let's move on now
[1:29:48] the message is so good we could stop
[1:29:51] right there in that we've had church
[1:29:53] but look at this brother branham talks
[1:29:56] about the bark
[1:29:57] or doctrine coming back on the tree so
[1:29:59] that was all the prelude
[1:30:01] my 45 minute starts now
[1:30:04] oh we won't do that but brother branham
[1:30:07] talks about that bart coming back on the
[1:30:09] tree right
[1:30:12] so that would be the the second thing
[1:30:14] that you would see the life would come
[1:30:16] in the life
[1:30:18] you only the only way you can tell that
[1:30:20] the life is in the trees by what happens
[1:30:22] on the outside
[1:30:24] right that's the only way you can tell
[1:30:25] everyone said don't judge me but that's
[1:30:27] the only way you can tell
[1:30:29] right it's because it exhibits itself
[1:30:31] but it's not just in long hair
[1:30:33] long dresses but it's in a life
[1:30:36] right and and so that life is on the
[1:30:39] inside and so there's a bark that
[1:30:41] begins to be restored and the bark is
[1:30:43] the protection or the doctrine
[1:30:46] coming back on the tree and we find that
[1:30:49] early church was not a bunch of
[1:30:50] charismatics
[1:30:52] and i don't say that against them but
[1:30:54] it's just they'll tell you they have no
[1:30:56] certain doctrine
[1:30:58] and there's nothing really that we
[1:30:59] believe
[1:31:01] one might be a somebody who who runs
[1:31:04] after this doctrine another one might
[1:31:05] run after that doctrine but they all
[1:31:06] come together and they all worship
[1:31:07] together and they all
[1:31:08] just have a wonderful time but there
[1:31:11] there might be a
[1:31:12] a woman preacher and a person standing
[1:31:14] up in shorts
[1:31:15] and people running all over the church
[1:31:17] and there's no church order no
[1:31:19] no changed life it's basically given up
[1:31:22] on the ideas god loves you like you are
[1:31:27] and i've heard this even from lately
[1:31:29] from christian musicians i was listening
[1:31:31] to a christian musician because i loved
[1:31:32] music and
[1:31:33] but they were talking about how that god
[1:31:35] loves you no matter what and i believe
[1:31:37] that i believe god loves you
[1:31:39] but he has a special love for his elect
[1:31:42] but they also talked about how that no
[1:31:44] matter you just you know
[1:31:45] life the way they present it was life is
[1:31:47] just you're human so you're going to do
[1:31:48] things
[1:31:49] so you just do them and then god loves
[1:31:51] you anyway and just when you realize
[1:31:53] that that's when you reach your
[1:31:54] nirvana when you just realize that god
[1:31:56] loves you no matter what you do
[1:31:58] right well god hates sin
[1:32:02] right he does love you but if you do
[1:32:04] certain things
[1:32:06] he's going to do what it takes to make
[1:32:08] you stop
[1:32:13] even the natural world tells us that
[1:32:16] look at the aids epi pandemic and all
[1:32:18] these things that have come on
[1:32:19] you want to go around do those things go
[1:32:21] ahead
[1:32:22] but there's coming a day there will be a
[1:32:24] payment
[1:32:27] there's coming a payday one day for
[1:32:30] those things
[1:32:31] and that's what you hate for you're not
[1:32:33] you stand here warning people
[1:32:34] don't go that way don't go that way
[1:32:39] don't go that way you tell people we
[1:32:40] don't believe in divorce why because we
[1:32:42] don't want to see
[1:32:43] we don't want to we i've seen the
[1:32:44] effects of it i know what it brings
[1:32:47] so don't go that way but you can tell
[1:32:48] people that over and over and over again
[1:32:50] and they go that way but it's not
[1:32:52] because you just want to control their
[1:32:53] life
[1:32:53] it's because you want you don't want to
[1:32:55] see them suffer that
[1:32:57] because god still keeps his word and if
[1:33:00] you do things that
[1:33:01] are against the word of god there will
[1:33:03] come a payday
[1:33:05] there is always a payday there will be a
[1:33:07] payday i don't know why i'm getting off
[1:33:09] on that this morning but you understand
[1:33:11] they'd say well just the love of god the
[1:33:13] love of god but but that wasn't the
[1:33:15] early church at all
[1:33:17] the early church believed in the love of
[1:33:18] god because that love had the power
[1:33:21] not just to leave you where you are in
[1:33:23] your sins but to change you
[1:33:26] hey man hey man paul could say some of
[1:33:29] you were
[1:33:29] adults or some of you were effeminate
[1:33:31] were or homosexual or whatever that it
[1:33:33] was
[1:33:33] but he said such were some of you amen
[1:33:36] but you've been washed but you've been
[1:33:38] cleaned amen
[1:33:40] hallelujah amen and so
[1:33:44] so we we realized that it has to change
[1:33:46] you and that's where the early church
[1:33:47] was in acts 2 42
[1:33:49] it says they continued steadfastly in
[1:33:52] the apostles doctrine
[1:33:54] and fellowship those that were saved on
[1:33:57] the day of pentecost didn't just go back
[1:33:58] to their regular lifestyle
[1:34:00] but they continued steadfastly in the
[1:34:02] apostles doctrine and fellowship
[1:34:04] in breaking of bread and in prayers see
[1:34:06] we have to have a day of pentecost we've
[1:34:08] got to have that moving of the spirit
[1:34:09] among us
[1:34:10] but we've got to have that continuing as
[1:34:11] well
[1:34:13] right we continue steadfastly in that if
[1:34:15] you receive something from god
[1:34:16] keep going in that don't stop you say
[1:34:19] well
[1:34:20] i got something from god i'm okay that's
[1:34:22] a dangerous place
[1:34:24] because right after a victory is where
[1:34:25] satan will always attack you
[1:34:28] right immediately after you begin to you
[1:34:31] feel that presence
[1:34:32] of god that blessing on your life satan
[1:34:34] will attack you right there
[1:34:36] immediately he'll try to tear you down
[1:34:37] try to make you think it wasn't real
[1:34:39] there was nothing to it
[1:34:40] why because he wants to destroy that in
[1:34:42] you
[1:34:43] he wants to destroy his hair and try to
[1:34:45] destroy the children why he didn't want
[1:34:46] him growing up to be the messiah
[1:34:49] right that's why he's trying to destroy
[1:34:52] you
[1:34:52] when you get something something's born
[1:34:54] in you you begin to feel the spirit of
[1:34:56] god move in your life
[1:34:57] and then all of a sudden satan tries to
[1:34:59] destroy why he don't want that to become
[1:35:01] a messiah
[1:35:08] so they continued that and that doctrine
[1:35:10] would be the foundation for
[1:35:11] everything we believe today the
[1:35:14] foundation for it yes it's been built on
[1:35:16] but it's built on that foundation the
[1:35:19] foundation of acts 2. now look
[1:35:22] brother brown said it was more than a
[1:35:23] scaffold work
[1:35:25] right the book of acts was the
[1:35:27] manifestation of what god wanted to do
[1:35:28] in a church
[1:35:30] right it's more than just a well it's a
[1:35:33] good time
[1:35:35] but it was limited to one time no
[1:35:38] it's the way a church should operate
[1:35:41] all right and and we have that plus the
[1:35:44] understanding of those things that were
[1:35:46] revealed at the end time now look
[1:35:50] uh ephesians 2 19 tells us now therefore
[1:35:52] you're no more strangers than foreigners
[1:35:54] but fellow citizens of the household of
[1:35:56] god
[1:35:58] you know you expect a foreigner to act
[1:35:59] like a foreigner but if you become a
[1:36:01] fellow citizen
[1:36:02] there are certain rights and
[1:36:03] responsibilities that you have
[1:36:06] right or different than what you did
[1:36:07] have you now fellow citizens with the
[1:36:10] saints of the household of god
[1:36:11] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:36:14] apostles and prophets
[1:36:16] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:36:18] cornerstone
[1:36:19] and paul takes that even a step farther
[1:36:21] and says this he said though we
[1:36:24] if i came back or an angel from heaven
[1:36:28] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:36:30] that which we have preached unto you
[1:36:32] let him be accursed
[1:36:35] stay on the foundation why because that
[1:36:38] is the bark or the protection on the
[1:36:39] tree
[1:36:41] right and brother branham even says that
[1:36:43] the worm got into the life
[1:36:45] so it could kill the bark once it got
[1:36:48] through
[1:36:49] the doctrine if he strips away the
[1:36:51] doctrine he has free access to the life
[1:36:55] and he will kill the life
[1:36:59] that's right and that's why doctrine is
[1:37:01] important what we believe
[1:37:03] matters but when i say doctrine i don't
[1:37:06] want you to get confused i don't want
[1:37:07] you to think well doctrine
[1:37:08] you know baptizing jesus name yes that
[1:37:10] is doctrine
[1:37:12] but it's more than that it's what you
[1:37:13] believe what do you believe about god
[1:37:17] what do you believe you are
[1:37:20] right it matters that you believe you're
[1:37:21] the elect of god
[1:37:23] it matters that you believe that god
[1:37:25] keeps his word
[1:37:27] right that's doctrine it matters that
[1:37:30] you believe that
[1:37:31] that these things are true if you don't
[1:37:32] believe it if you're not sure
[1:37:35] then you're on an unstable foundation
[1:37:37] you can fall over at any time
[1:37:39] it matters what you believe look
[1:37:43] brother branham said this he said as
[1:37:44] long as the word and said it would be
[1:37:46] here would operate this certain way
[1:37:48] stay right with it right if the word
[1:37:51] said
[1:37:52] that the church would be here and he's
[1:37:55] talking i think there about his own
[1:37:57] ministry
[1:37:58] if the word said it would be here that
[1:37:59] gift would be here and operate a certain
[1:38:01] way
[1:38:01] that's what you should believe right
[1:38:03] stay right with it
[1:38:05] but now if the church let's take that
[1:38:07] same principle right
[1:38:09] the word said it would be here would
[1:38:11] operate a certain way stay right with it
[1:38:15] right don't never get off no matter what
[1:38:18] anybody does how real it seems to be
[1:38:23] amen he said if it doesn't reflect in
[1:38:25] the scriptures from genesis to
[1:38:26] revelation leave it alone
[1:38:28] don't take no chances
[1:38:31] amen we're in the last days when satan
[1:38:34] is just as deceiving as he can be
[1:38:37] and brother brahma says this i love this
[1:38:39] next parrot
[1:38:40] couple of paragraphs because he said
[1:38:42] forgive me if i try to take the place of
[1:38:43] a boss
[1:38:44] i'm no boss but i feel to you like paul
[1:38:47] said back there about his congregation
[1:38:48] once
[1:38:49] you're the stars in my crown when i
[1:38:51] cross over the land over on the other
[1:38:53] side yonder
[1:38:54] and meet you in that glorified condition
[1:38:56] i want you to stand there
[1:38:58] to shine like the stars of my crown see
[1:39:01] i want you to be there
[1:39:02] i want i want to be there and i want you
[1:39:06] to be there see
[1:39:07] the thing about a preacher you have to
[1:39:08] believe in it strong enough
[1:39:10] that you want others to be there and you
[1:39:12] want to be there with them
[1:39:14] right and you believe in it strong so
[1:39:16] strongly that you believe you'll be
[1:39:18] there you want them to be there and so
[1:39:20] you tell them the truth
[1:39:22] because a lie won't get you there he
[1:39:24] said and i remember in my vision when i
[1:39:26] seen the presence of the lord
[1:39:28] or his people in that glorious land
[1:39:29] yonder i looked around
[1:39:32] i told them he said and they told me he
[1:39:34] would judge me first by the gospel that
[1:39:36] i preach
[1:39:37] and i said just exactly the way paul
[1:39:40] preached it
[1:39:42] amen and then millions of people
[1:39:45] screamed out
[1:39:47] amen we're resting on that
[1:39:51] hallelujah he said now i want it to be
[1:39:54] so and we are going to meet there
[1:39:56] someday
[1:39:57] and if we're going to meet there we want
[1:39:58] to know that we stood on what paul said
[1:40:01] we stood on the truth are we there yet
[1:40:05] now doctrinally now think about this the
[1:40:08] word is back
[1:40:10] right you're gonna have a hard time
[1:40:13] convincing me differently from that
[1:40:15] brother brother ben you haven't heard
[1:40:17] what so-and-so said the word is back
[1:40:22] why because i know it's not an opinion
[1:40:23] because it works
[1:40:25] right the word is back life is in the
[1:40:29] grain
[1:40:30] brother brown says we do have today
[1:40:33] by god's help the perfect interpretation
[1:40:35] of the word
[1:40:37] with divine vindication so he's talking
[1:40:40] about resting in in
[1:40:41] all these other things we don't have to
[1:40:42] rest in emotion we have the perfect
[1:40:44] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:40:45] vindication
[1:40:46] and that brings joy to us see that's the
[1:40:49] difference so we're not a bunch of
[1:40:49] charismatics running around
[1:40:52] going around and speaking in tongues and
[1:40:54] doing all kinds of things and running
[1:40:55] around living any way we want to no
[1:40:56] we know what we believe and that's why a
[1:40:59] man of god can stand up here and preach
[1:41:00] in the pulpit
[1:41:01] and while he's preaching the power of
[1:41:03] god can fall in the congregation
[1:41:05] right it's not about your work not about
[1:41:07] your music but god moves
[1:41:10] why does god do that because we have
[1:41:11] today hallelujah
[1:41:13] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:41:15] with divine vindication
[1:41:16] the life is in the grain
[1:41:19] amen the bark is on the bride tree
[1:41:23] but now bring it down to an individual
[1:41:25] level is it been restored to my life
[1:41:27] is what i believe does it match what the
[1:41:30] bible says
[1:41:32] what the word the revealed word says in
[1:41:34] our hour do i imagine or am i still
[1:41:36] fighting part of it
[1:41:38] right well i believe that but you know
[1:41:41] he really didn't want us to do that
[1:41:43] whether it's dress or actions or some
[1:41:45] other way we just fight a part of it
[1:41:47] we try to live just as close as we can
[1:41:48] to the line lord know
[1:41:51] i want all of what you have for me i
[1:41:54] want that bark that covering that
[1:41:55] doctrine
[1:41:56] to protect the life now look brother
[1:41:59] said this little cankerworm began to
[1:42:01] bore himself into the bark
[1:42:02] what did he do he began to take its
[1:42:04] religion it's covering its doctrine away
[1:42:06] from it
[1:42:08] he said religion is a doctrine a
[1:42:09] doctrine that covers anything
[1:42:11] he said that's the reason our religion
[1:42:12] is by blood the blood
[1:42:14] the life is in the blood that covers the
[1:42:16] word and the life it's in the blood the
[1:42:18] blood is religion the life and the blood
[1:42:20] is what brings the results
[1:42:22] he said do you see it he said it's not
[1:42:24] covered by fig leaves adam and eve tried
[1:42:26] that one time
[1:42:27] cain did the same thing did you notice
[1:42:29] that cain brought some of the botany
[1:42:30] life too but it wouldn't work it didn't
[1:42:31] work with adam and eve it won't work
[1:42:33] today
[1:42:34] when god refused it at the beginning
[1:42:37] it's refused for eternity
[1:42:39] handmade creeds and thoughts will never
[1:42:41] take it
[1:42:43] it's god's word has to do it and the
[1:42:44] word is by blood
[1:42:46] the sacrifice of sacrifice of christ now
[1:42:48] listen
[1:42:49] here's a question are we there yet do we
[1:42:52] have a man-made religion
[1:42:54] or are we covered by the blood
[1:42:58] and a good way to know that is did we
[1:42:59] make up what we believe
[1:43:02] because if you invented it you got to
[1:43:05] stand behind it
[1:43:07] but i'm so glad that this word was
[1:43:09] invented by god
[1:43:13] he gets to interpret it how he wants to
[1:43:16] do we have a man-made religion or are we
[1:43:18] covered by the blood
[1:43:20] now look brother branham goes into an
[1:43:23] explanation here in in the restoration
[1:43:25] of the bride tree
[1:43:26] and i felt this was needful and i don't
[1:43:28] know how far we'll get into it and i'll
[1:43:29] just cut it off when we
[1:43:31] reach time we got a few more minutes can
[1:43:33] i have five more minutes
[1:43:35] now brother wendell i won't do that but
[1:43:37] the window martin would take five
[1:43:38] minutes from each hand that goes up but
[1:43:41] we won't do that but it may be a little
[1:43:44] more than five minutes so
[1:43:48] he said it's god's word has to do it and
[1:43:51] the word by the blood
[1:43:52] and brother branham says thank you for
[1:43:54] changing that god never left anything
[1:43:55] for relics and tokens
[1:44:00] he sent the holy ghost something alive
[1:44:04] he didn't preserve the temples have you
[1:44:05] ever noticed that
[1:44:07] the temples were there when the shekinah
[1:44:09] was there
[1:44:11] but when the shekinah left the temple
[1:44:13] the temple was destroyed
[1:44:16] god never left anything for relics and
[1:44:18] tokens and you can make anything a relic
[1:44:20] or token by the way
[1:44:23] it can be a preacher it can be it can be
[1:44:26] a
[1:44:26] it could be a picture it could be a
[1:44:28] piano
[1:44:30] it could be a car
[1:44:33] it could be the way you do things
[1:44:38] listen we're going to take communion
[1:44:39] next week i believe in taking communion
[1:44:40] i like doing it on a regular basis but
[1:44:42] if it becomes a relic and a token to you
[1:44:44] personally now that is a you problem
[1:44:47] right
[1:44:47] that's not the church's problem if you
[1:44:50] if you begin to worship communion that's
[1:44:52] your problem
[1:44:53] right but if it's a relic if you if you
[1:44:56] trust in that for your salvation
[1:44:58] you're in trouble well i take communion
[1:45:02] i go to church i listen to brother ben
[1:45:05] or i listen to whatever other messengers
[1:45:07] out there whatever other preacher is out
[1:45:09] there i listen to them
[1:45:10] well if that's a relic or a token that's
[1:45:13] that's not alive
[1:45:15] you understand there's got to be
[1:45:17] something that's alive
[1:45:18] that cannot be destroyed and let me tell
[1:45:21] you at some point
[1:45:23] if the lord terry's i won't be here
[1:45:24] anymore now i hope that's 50 years from
[1:45:27] now if the lord tarries that long
[1:45:28] i hope we're not here that long but if
[1:45:32] we are
[1:45:32] i hope it's 50 years from now but there
[1:45:34] will come a time i don't stand behind
[1:45:36] this pulpit and it could be tomorrow
[1:45:38] we don't know that you understand i'm
[1:45:40] not trying to scare you there's no
[1:45:41] guarantee
[1:45:42] no guarantee god don't leave anything
[1:45:45] for relics and tokens
[1:45:47] huh you lift me up too far god will take
[1:45:50] me out of the way
[1:45:52] and move somebody else in god never left
[1:45:54] anything for relics and tokens he won't
[1:45:56] do it
[1:45:58] he sent the holy ghost something that
[1:46:01] can't be killed
[1:46:03] something that cannot be destroyed
[1:46:07] but the verb said what would a nail do
[1:46:09] me any good what would the original
[1:46:11] cross he hung on what would it do me any
[1:46:13] good not a bit not to know the nail no
[1:46:14] the cross
[1:46:15] but to know him as life now we're
[1:46:18] holding on nails we're holding on to
[1:46:19] relics we're holding on places today
[1:46:21] people walk up and down in the city of
[1:46:22] jerusalem and all up and down
[1:46:23] and then different places holding the
[1:46:25] relic things that ain't got nothing to
[1:46:26] do with it another thing the thing is
[1:46:28] condemned rotten and going on so you've
[1:46:29] got to have new manna
[1:46:31] you can't make wednesday night a relic
[1:46:34] right that's in the past
[1:46:36] the poet said this is the only living
[1:46:37] time
[1:46:39] right now this is it you don't get to
[1:46:42] memorialize the past and make that
[1:46:44] all that you live for no it's right now
[1:46:47] yes you can learn from it yes you can
[1:46:48] remember it yes you can give honor to it
[1:46:50] but you don't
[1:46:51] god don't leave us nothing for relics
[1:46:53] and tokens
[1:46:56] but branham says i went to a church in
[1:46:57] rome and all these priests that died
[1:46:59] plant them in a garden
[1:47:00] and let the meat fall off the bones then
[1:47:02] they take the bones out make light
[1:47:03] fixtures put their skulls around
[1:47:05] people come in there rub them skulls to
[1:47:07] get blessings till the skulls are white
[1:47:09] and wore
[1:47:10] out he said you go into st peter's
[1:47:12] cathedral foot of peter they claim their
[1:47:14] statue has been kissed off nine or ten
[1:47:15] different times
[1:47:16] they have to mold another foot on it he
[1:47:18] said such nonsense superstitions that's
[1:47:20] all it is
[1:47:20] creeds of man-made doctrine
[1:47:24] if you can't worship god because your
[1:47:25] relic isn't there that's a problem
[1:47:29] if you can't worship god because your
[1:47:30] favorite preacher isn't there that's a
[1:47:32] problem
[1:47:34] whatever the relic is superstition it's
[1:47:37] all creeds of man-made doctrine
[1:47:41] hey man i'm not looking for a certain
[1:47:43] relic listen if i was looking for a
[1:47:44] church today
[1:47:45] i'm not looking for a certain relic for
[1:47:48] some place where i could go to church
[1:47:49] and
[1:47:49] take my family i'm not looking for a
[1:47:51] certain reality what am i looking for a
[1:47:53] living word
[1:47:55] a present truth it's the word that's
[1:47:58] preached
[1:47:58] able to change my life
[1:48:03] that's what i'm looking for not idols
[1:48:05] but living idols
[1:48:07] people that have been changed by the
[1:48:09] word that's what we look for
[1:48:11] where i want to go where the truth is
[1:48:13] preach where the spirit is free to move
[1:48:16] amen i've told you alone for that where
[1:48:18] we have no agenda
[1:48:19] no certain thing but just where the
[1:48:21] spirit of god is able to move
[1:48:23] back and forth through the congregation
[1:48:25] nothing that i don't have to
[1:48:26] i don't have to have this pulpit i don't
[1:48:28] have to have these chairs i don't have
[1:48:29] to have this building
[1:48:31] but i have to have the word amen
[1:48:34] i must have the word and if i have the
[1:48:36] word god can do what he did wednesday
[1:48:38] night he can do what he's doing this
[1:48:40] morning he can do what he's doing in our
[1:48:41] church
[1:48:43] amen and in churches around the country
[1:48:46] not just this one
[1:48:47] god can do what he's doing there can be
[1:48:49] revival
[1:48:50] because the word for our day is here the
[1:48:53] spirit is free from to move
[1:48:55] the word from my day can be manifested
[1:48:57] brother master this little fellow
[1:48:58] started destroying
[1:48:59] destroying what the cake worm got out of
[1:49:01] the bark watch what it did begin to
[1:49:02] destroy the bark
[1:49:03] what did it do he said it made a natural
[1:49:05] church for a spiritual church
[1:49:07] watch it took away the true and gave it
[1:49:09] a false
[1:49:11] he said the fruit the pome worm heat the
[1:49:13] leaf the locust seed
[1:49:15] now the bark the covering the religion
[1:49:17] the doctrine the cankerworm god
[1:49:20] where did the first doctrine come from
[1:49:22] outside the bible he said historians
[1:49:24] know where it comes from from rome
[1:49:25] exactly where it started and there they
[1:49:27] started accepting
[1:49:29] dogmas i want to look at this and then
[1:49:32] we'll speed right on to the end
[1:49:34] now look what is a dogma
[1:49:37] a dogma is a settled opinion
[1:49:42] a principle a maximum a 10 a doctrinal
[1:49:45] notion right that's dogma
[1:49:50] and this by the way is from webster's
[1:49:51] 1828 dictionary which i love
[1:49:53] i love the way he puts it he takes it
[1:49:55] from a biblical perspective because that
[1:49:56] was just the day he lived in
[1:49:58] that's a dogma the dogmas of the church
[1:50:00] the dogma is a plato it could be
[1:50:02] anybody can have a dogma right the other
[1:50:04] word you hear with that is creed what's
[1:50:06] a creed
[1:50:07] a creed is a summary of the articles of
[1:50:09] christian faith or it's that which
[1:50:11] is believed
[1:50:14] a dogma a settled opinion
[1:50:17] you know an opinion is still an opinion
[1:50:19] even if a lot of people believe it
[1:50:22] or we say a lot of people have it still
[1:50:25] an opinion
[1:50:27] right just because a lot of people hear
[1:50:28] a story doesn't make the story true
[1:50:35] that which is believed it's just what we
[1:50:37] believe a creed
[1:50:39] but now look at that we don't live by
[1:50:41] creeds and dogmas
[1:50:43] what do we live by revelation let's look
[1:50:45] at revelation revelation is the act of
[1:50:47] disclosing
[1:50:48] or discovering to others creed comes
[1:50:51] from
[1:50:52] here dogma comes from here
[1:50:55] you understand but revelation comes from
[1:50:57] him
[1:50:59] right it's not me settling on an opinion
[1:51:03] about scripture but it's god saying
[1:51:07] what he did and why he did it amen
[1:51:11] the act of disclosing or discovering to
[1:51:13] others what was before unknown to them
[1:51:15] appropriately
[1:51:16] the disclosure or communication of truth
[1:51:19] to men
[1:51:20] by god himself or by his authorized
[1:51:23] agents hallelujah the prophets
[1:51:27] and the apostles the church nominal
[1:51:29] settles for dogmas and creeds
[1:51:31] we want revelation now look it's got to
[1:51:35] be on a foundation of the apostles and
[1:51:37] prophets so whatever revelation we get
[1:51:38] from god
[1:51:39] we'll check out with the word it always
[1:51:42] will because
[1:51:43] it has to be now revelation 17 8 speaks
[1:51:46] of a bottomless pit and i won't read it
[1:51:48] to save time
[1:51:49] but it talks about the beast coming out
[1:51:50] of a bottomless pit brother branham says
[1:51:52] this
[1:51:53] he said he said it's the catholic
[1:51:55] catholic doctrine he said not on the
[1:51:56] bible
[1:51:57] he said out of a bunch of superstitions
[1:51:59] that was made up
[1:52:02] now again has the mark been restored and
[1:52:03] i want you to ask yourself this question
[1:52:05] before we close today
[1:52:07] is what i believe did it come out of my
[1:52:09] own head
[1:52:11] did i make it up or is it revelation
[1:52:14] from god
[1:52:18] and it's about anything it's not just
[1:52:21] about
[1:52:22] everything the way i worship the way i
[1:52:24] talk the way i interact with my brothers
[1:52:26] and sisters
[1:52:27] is it the way i am what i've settled on
[1:52:30] a dogma a creed
[1:52:32] or is it revelation
[1:52:36] he says it was made up of a bunch of out
[1:52:38] of a bunch of superstitions he lists
[1:52:40] some of these different doctrines where
[1:52:42] do you get that
[1:52:43] app there's no place nowhere to find it
[1:52:45] brother brown said it come out of hell
[1:52:48] the bible said so it come out of the
[1:52:49] beast the power the doctrine that it had
[1:52:52] come out of the bottomless pit
[1:52:55] the bottomless pit what is it brother
[1:52:57] branham in another sermon he said what
[1:52:58] is it the bottomless pit
[1:53:00] there's no foundation for a catholic
[1:53:02] doctrine
[1:53:03] there's no bible for catholic doctrine
[1:53:05] there's no such thing as any bible
[1:53:06] for any catholic doctrine not at all why
[1:53:08] it's a and they'll tell you
[1:53:10] they don't hide that fact like we
[1:53:13] protestants many times try to
[1:53:15] but the catholic don't hide that because
[1:53:18] they say though the church has the power
[1:53:19] to change it
[1:53:21] right now this bark eating locust takes
[1:53:25] away something and replaces it with
[1:53:27] something else from the bottomless pit
[1:53:29] so brother brother said that cake worm
[1:53:31] got to eating and eat away the bat first
[1:53:32] the baptism of water in the name of
[1:53:34] jesus christ secondly
[1:53:35] it got to eat in the baptism of the holy
[1:53:37] ghost i want to
[1:53:40] cow down as i said on this for a little
[1:53:41] while
[1:53:43] actually brother says cabbage down by
[1:53:45] the way
[1:53:46] not cow down my son corrected me on that
[1:53:48] the other day
[1:53:50] he went back and looking for brother
[1:53:51] bran was saying that and that's not what
[1:53:52] he said he said cabbage down so i'm
[1:53:53] sorry i misquoted a prophet
[1:53:56] but i did it in ignorance but i want to
[1:53:59] cabbage down on this for a minute
[1:54:00] because the cankworm takes away the
[1:54:02] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:54:03] he said because as long as you're going
[1:54:04] to have that holy ghost it's going to
[1:54:06] shed light on that word
[1:54:08] you realize what satan don't want you to
[1:54:10] have a service like we did wednesday
[1:54:11] night
[1:54:11] he don't want you to feel the presence
[1:54:13] of god in the service he don't want you
[1:54:14] to have the holy spirit in your life
[1:54:16] because that holy spirit sheds light on
[1:54:18] the word
[1:54:20] right so he said the this this worm ate
[1:54:22] away at the bark and he was eating away
[1:54:25] at the holy ghost he was trying to kill
[1:54:28] the baptism of the holy ghost he said
[1:54:30] now
[1:54:31] he said that's what the cankerworm did
[1:54:33] he said it took away the spirit and give
[1:54:35] them a piece of bread
[1:54:36] a bread that some priests made or some
[1:54:38] nun or something that's what they did
[1:54:39] that's exactly right he said go
[1:54:41] ask now go looking back in history and
[1:54:42] see if it isn't right you let that thing
[1:54:44] be shoved down your throat
[1:54:45] not only them catholics but you
[1:54:47] protestants they said many of you same
[1:54:48] thing he said the protestant instead of
[1:54:50] having the holy ghost you know what they
[1:54:52] do they come and join and shake a hand
[1:54:54] it wasn't somebody come up the road and
[1:54:55] shook a hand on the day of pentecost
[1:54:57] come
[1:54:57] but there come from heaven the sound of
[1:54:59] a rushing mighty wind
[1:55:00] you talk about revelation it wasn't a
[1:55:02] dogma or creed but it come from heaven
[1:55:04] it filled all the house where they were
[1:55:05] sitting that's right he said
[1:55:07] come down through them leaves on trees
[1:55:09] poured over the bark
[1:55:11] he said now instead of the new birth
[1:55:12] that jesus said a man must be born again
[1:55:14] they adopted joining their church
[1:55:16] come and join instead of the word the
[1:55:18] cankerworm give them a creed
[1:55:20] don't you see he said look what he's
[1:55:22] doing he's giving a natural for a
[1:55:23] spiritual
[1:55:25] can you see it can we see it this
[1:55:26] morning
[1:55:28] brother brown asked a question
[1:55:32] he said where do we have the holy ghost
[1:55:34] demonstrations in protestant churches
[1:55:35] today
[1:55:37] where do we have a pentecostal reaction
[1:55:41] in amongst protestants you say oh in the
[1:55:42] pentecostal church
[1:55:44] i beg to differ you have a lot of noise
[1:55:49] but where do we have a pentecostal
[1:55:51] reaction
[1:55:52] a pentecostal reaction would be like it
[1:55:54] was then
[1:55:56] yes and it does involve some people
[1:55:58] acting like they were drunk
[1:56:02] by the way if you've never been drunk in
[1:56:04] the spirit i highly recommend it
[1:56:10] you're worried depressed down on
[1:56:12] yourself
[1:56:13] mad at somebody get drunk on the spirit
[1:56:18] it's good stuff pretty bad
[1:56:22] i'm told that these guys are like wine
[1:56:23] you know they go and find the best stuff
[1:56:25] they can find the best vintage and they
[1:56:26] try to
[1:56:27] show it to people and say this is the
[1:56:29] best stuff and they become almost
[1:56:30] evangelist for it this is the stuff that
[1:56:32] i drink
[1:56:33] i'll tell you what i found some good
[1:56:34] stuff
[1:56:36] i found some stuff that'll make you so
[1:56:38] drunk that revelation will come down on
[1:56:40] you
[1:56:40] i found some stuff that'll make you
[1:56:42] drunk and it'll make you feel like that
[1:56:44] that you can jump through it run through
[1:56:46] a troop and jump over a wall
[1:56:47] it'll make you feel like you can do it
[1:56:49] amen you can make it why because
[1:56:52] god reveals it to you amen in that
[1:56:55] spirit with that quickening power
[1:56:56] brother branham says he says where do
[1:56:59] you have a pentecostal reaction he said
[1:57:00] i want to go over there and just eat
[1:57:02] and have a wonderful time if they're
[1:57:03] having it i want to go over there and
[1:57:05] find it
[1:57:06] he said but see you've adopted something
[1:57:08] natural he said i'm fixing to leave and
[1:57:10] you know that he said don't you never
[1:57:12] let this get out of your heart
[1:57:14] don't take the natural that's death this
[1:57:17] natural man is death anything it does is
[1:57:19] death
[1:57:19] it's subjected here for death it's the
[1:57:21] spirit that maketh the life the spirit
[1:57:24] that gives life and quickens it it's a
[1:57:25] spirit
[1:57:28] i'm going to skip through this next one
[1:57:30] and i apologize to sister joanna
[1:57:33] but i want to come down and brother
[1:57:34] branham talks about purgatory i'm going
[1:57:36] to skip way down so if you can find me
[1:57:39] otherwise we're closing in a moment
[1:57:40] anyway
[1:57:44] brandon talks about purgatory and then
[1:57:45] he talks about he said purgatory is
[1:57:46] unauthoritative word
[1:57:49] and that's he said it's no more than any
[1:57:53] other life it's contrary to god's word
[1:57:54] it's a lie
[1:57:56] brahma said i don't believe
[1:57:58] unauthoritative words
[1:58:00] this is that paragraph 293 he said how
[1:58:03] would we say
[1:58:04] oh they say this that and the other but
[1:58:07] anything that's unauthoritative don't
[1:58:09] believe it
[1:58:11] it won't do anything for you but they
[1:58:14] say it's true
[1:58:15] is it authoritative what makes it
[1:58:18] authoritative authoritative it's on the
[1:58:19] foundation
[1:58:22] he goes on to talk about the people who
[1:58:24] are baptized in jesus name if the angel
[1:58:26] said so
[1:58:29] now watch this because a lot of us if
[1:58:32] listen if we believe in brother brown
[1:58:34] was strong enough but why do you believe
[1:58:36] in brother branham because he stayed
[1:58:37] with the word
[1:58:38] he fulfilled his mission of staying with
[1:58:40] the word he was vindicated but he stayed
[1:58:42] with the word
[1:58:43] we don't have to question that go back
[1:58:44] and dig through and find out he say with
[1:58:46] the word because he did
[1:58:48] i've never found him straying from the
[1:58:50] word and if he would even in his human
[1:58:52] being he would get off maybe say
[1:58:54] something wrong the holy spirit would
[1:58:55] correct him on that
[1:58:56] we've seen that over and over god sent
[1:58:59] us a vindicated prophet with a message
[1:59:00] we can believe in
[1:59:03] right but we don't believe in
[1:59:04] unauthoritative words we
[1:59:06] if an angel brother branham talks about
[1:59:07] how all those ministers told him that if
[1:59:10] the angel the lord told you
[1:59:12] about baptism in jesus name we would
[1:59:13] believe it
[1:59:16] i wonder how many of us if if somebody
[1:59:18] come and said the angel the lord
[1:59:20] said that a certain thing was true
[1:59:24] we believe in that angel the lord huh
[1:59:27] but it's got to match up with the
[1:59:28] scripture
[1:59:30] and brother branham we read that now ago
[1:59:32] he said the angel lord never did say
[1:59:33] anything that wasn't true
[1:59:36] right so that but the angel lord didn't
[1:59:37] tell him about baptism in jesus name
[1:59:41] huh and they said if the angel of the
[1:59:43] lord had told you we would believe it
[1:59:46] but it's brother branham calls that
[1:59:47] unauthoritative words
[1:59:50] go look it up it's the angel of the lord
[1:59:53] and brother branham said that they
[1:59:54] didn't believe it because it wasn't the
[1:59:55] angel of the lord he follows up this
[1:59:57] unauthority of
[1:59:58] words with that they didn't believe it
[1:59:59] because it wasn't the angel of the lord
[2:00:01] that said it
[2:00:02] but brother brown said this is the
[2:00:04] apostolic doctrine
[2:00:06] this is the bible this is the holy
[2:00:08] spirit
[2:00:10] amen every word in it is true
[2:00:13] you just believe it and accept it he
[2:00:16] said and don't take down on it in other
[2:00:17] words don't
[2:00:19] don't weaken it by theory
[2:00:23] are you with me now we can do that to
[2:00:25] the message too if we're not careful
[2:00:27] we can we can theorize it until we
[2:00:28] weaken it down no believe what it says
[2:00:32] don't weaken it by theory don't water it
[2:00:34] down don't take down on it
[2:00:36] he said and watch every promise
[2:00:39] amen do we still believe he does that
[2:00:41] today
[2:00:42] watch every promise amen
[2:00:45] be fulfilled the manifestation of god
[2:00:48] present right now do you believe that
[2:00:51] today
[2:00:52] musicians go ahead and come are we there
[2:00:54] yet
[2:00:57] we have a vindicated message
[2:01:00] but ourselves i want us to think about
[2:01:02] that do we hold the doctrines of
[2:01:03] convenience
[2:01:04] or dogmas and creeds because we were
[2:01:06] raised a certain way or we come up with
[2:01:08] i was talking i had a great conversation
[2:01:10] after that we couldn't go to sleep but
[2:01:12] andrew and i
[2:01:13] i'm telling you we left here wednesday
[2:01:15] night went back there and worshipped
[2:01:19] and that's why we didn't come out for a
[2:01:21] while because we're sitting back there
[2:01:22] praying and worshiping because of what
[2:01:23] god did
[2:01:24] it may not mean a whole lot to some
[2:01:26] people but it means a lot to me
[2:01:28] god is able to move in our midst just he
[2:01:30] may not move that way in every service
[2:01:32] but we want him to be free
[2:01:34] we want him to be free we want him to be
[2:01:36] able to take me in
[2:01:37] and just change what i'm going to preach
[2:01:39] not you know a lot of people in
[2:01:40] pentecost a free service was not having
[2:01:41] any preaching
[2:01:42] but to me a free service is when god
[2:01:44] takes the word and anoints it and puts
[2:01:46] it right exactly where it's supposed to
[2:01:48] be but we set up till
[2:01:51] about two o'clock that morning over here
[2:01:52] at the fellowship hall
[2:01:54] we set up and talked about what the
[2:01:56] goodness of god and the things of god we
[2:01:57] got to talking about
[2:01:59] things we've been through and how he
[2:02:00] come up a certain way and
[2:02:02] that's been him a certain way and he
[2:02:04] preaches a certain way and i come up a
[2:02:05] different way
[2:02:06] and so it kind of would bent a different
[2:02:08] way but yet god
[2:02:10] i believe he uses both of us now i i
[2:02:12] hardly put myself in the conversation of
[2:02:14] that as a preacher
[2:02:15] but god uses both of us somehow he uses
[2:02:18] both of us he uses each one of you
[2:02:20] but you come up a certain way but god
[2:02:22] allowed you to come up that way
[2:02:24] but what you've got to watch is make
[2:02:25] sure that what you believe isn't just
[2:02:27] a a bunch of things that you've learned
[2:02:29] put together
[2:02:31] it isn't just your own biases and things
[2:02:33] you've been around people you've been
[2:02:34] around
[2:02:35] places you've been and you've soaked
[2:02:36] that in and you become that that's not
[2:02:38] what we want
[2:02:39] we don't want to abide in whatever we
[2:02:40] were but we want to abide in the vine
[2:02:43] abide in the word let our what we
[2:02:45] believe become the word become true
[2:02:47] because it's true
[2:02:49] not because we believe it not because
[2:02:51] it's a dogma or a creed or the church
[2:02:52] teaches it but because it's the truth of
[2:02:54] god
[2:02:55] amen and i will tell you this morning if
[2:02:58] you will stay with the word
[2:02:59] do we believe that today the promises
[2:03:02] will be fulfilled in you
[2:03:03] if you can be like martin luther when he
[2:03:05] stood there one day and said here i
[2:03:06] stand i can do no other how could he
[2:03:08] stand there like that
[2:03:09] because he had the the unction of the
[2:03:12] hour was on him
[2:03:13] and the unction of this hour is to stand
[2:03:14] there and say here i stand with the
[2:03:16] message of the hour i can do no other
[2:03:19] amen and when you do the fulfillment of
[2:03:21] the promises will be fulfilled in your
[2:03:23] life
[2:03:24] amen do we believe it today let's bow
[2:03:27] our heads heavenly father
[2:03:29] we love you thank you for your presence
[2:03:32] lord
[2:03:34] thank you for your spirit the people
[2:03:35] responding so well this morning
[2:03:38] even though i had way too much material
[2:03:40] lord i thank you
[2:03:42] i thank you that we have this much
[2:03:44] material lord
[2:03:46] oh it's something so blessing to us lord
[2:03:48] if we just reach down and pull down
[2:03:50] every out every nugget
[2:03:52] everything that you bless us so much
[2:03:55] lord i'm so grateful
[2:03:57] i don't want to let this moment pass
[2:04:00] without thanking you for what you've
[2:04:01] done
[2:04:02] maybe there's people here today that
[2:04:03] wasn't here wednesday here
[2:04:05] or perhaps they were here wednesday and
[2:04:07] they believe they received something
[2:04:08] from you
[2:04:10] lord i pray that that would continue in
[2:04:12] their lives
[2:04:13] whatever they got rid of whatever they
[2:04:15] threw out the door
[2:04:16] that that would continue as they
[2:04:18] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[2:04:20] doctrine
[2:04:20] may it continue to be an influence in
[2:04:22] their lives lord if they got rid of it
[2:04:25] help them not to dig it back
[2:04:26] up tell them not to go outside the
[2:04:28] church and try to find it and
[2:04:29] dig it back up and restart it again but
[2:04:32] lord
[2:04:32] may it really be settled for what
[2:04:34] forever
[2:04:36] lord i pray i pray that in our own
[2:04:38] prayer times

[2:04:54] but because you're moving lord
[2:04:56] i pray you granted god i pray you'd move
[2:04:59] in this church in a mighty way
[2:05:01] lord may we know that what we believe
[2:05:03] doesn't come from the creed or a dog or
[2:05:05] because we've been taught a certain
[2:05:06] thing
[2:05:07] but it's because of divine revelation
[2:05:09] has come down
[2:05:10] in our day god sent a prophet in this
[2:05:13] age
[2:05:13] a prophet an elijah message to come but
