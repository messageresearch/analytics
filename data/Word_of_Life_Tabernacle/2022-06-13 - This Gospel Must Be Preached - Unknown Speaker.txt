peter a chance to get back there you love the lord tonight he's good to us this morning he's always good to us yes i appreciate your response to the message this morning i ran out of wind at some point this morning and i didn't uh feel very good about it but i appreciate your response the lord knows what we need and and when we need it matthew chapter 24 and verse 3 if you'll turn there with me this evening matthew 24 and 3. i didn't have it on well praise god and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many you shall hear of wars and rumors of war see that you be not troubled all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and diverse places have we not seen all of that then they shall they deliver you up he said all these are the beginning of sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you you should be hated of all nations for my name's sake then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold have we seen all of that yes but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and i want to focus on this verse and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations someone say all it says all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your presence here tonight and to thank you for uh lord meeting with us once again as you promised that you would in your word i pray that you would move over this congregation those that have come those lord that are missing tonight are watching the stream i pray that you bless him tonight lord i pray that you just move in a mighty way in our midst lord and and though maybe some of these things would just be maybe mundane or things that we know already but lord i pray that it would just be quick into our hearts and help us to realize that we're a part lord of a great global scheme that you've played out a drama that you played out from the beginning lord and we're just a bit player in that just a part of that just one pebble on the beach but lord we thank you for allowing us to be part of your plan now lord i pray you bless this service help us lord to recognize our place and our position who we are and you lord and then stand in that place and stay in the land of the promises we pray we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated this evening are you happy this evening the bible says i was happy when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen so we're glad to be here on on a sunday afternoon some time ago i was talking to one of the missionaries we support robert wilson about the trips he planned to take this year and he had mentioned something about going to egypt and my attention was grabbed and i began to tell him that if he had had a chance to go let me know maybe we could support it in some way i had prayed about taking a trip i have talked to you all about that i try not to take more than one a year because that's and i haven't taken one in two years since we've been here because this is my first love if i could say it that way is here at the church and and i also know that if a pastor's not there the people suffer and uh in the sense that not because you need me necessarily but i'm in my position and and you always do best when you're in your place i want you to be in your place and you want me to be in mine and and my place really is here behind the pulpit and of this church and so i know that that's the place where i ought to be and and yet i feel that we need to do everything we can to make sure that the gospel is preached and we'll get into that and i want to preach to you about that in just a moment but i was talking to him and he began to talk to me about it and i began to be impressed on my heart that maybe i needed to go i didn't know what i was getting myself into i don't know anything about egypt and i think i put the a couple of pictures on there i didn't know anything about egypt to me egypt was this picture uh and so we don't i didn't know anything about the people or anything like that i knew there was one message church there because i talked to a brother that had been once and that's all that i knew and but egypt is more than the pyramids egypt is a lot of people there's a lot of people there and a very few christian people and i guess if we were going to take our time and our money as a church and our finances and put it somewhere we'd want to do it to a place where there wasn't very many other people going because you want the opportunity to preach to new people and not just to change them from one doctrine to another that's never been my desire but to introduce the gospel of jesus christ to the people and also to we believe in this this gospel the message of the hour that we preach and that we teach we want to get that to the people so we don't want to just go where everybody else goes that's why i support brother wilson because he doesn't do that he goes uh to places where no one else goes and i know some of the places he's been and the things that he's been through and i've been there with him i've been there at togo and benin with him and in africa and i know what that's like in west africa but i've never been to egypt and evidently egypt is a very difficult country to get into and so i telling you this because i want your prayers and and would you do that would you pray for us we're going to be leaving on the 27th brother joel is supposed to go with me and you pray for him because he still has his passport appointment and so he doesn't know for sure uh yet until you get the papers in your hand nothing's guaranteed and and even that they just hassle you about everything you know if you've never traveled internationally then you just don't know but when you go to a place like that they they hassle you about everything and and what they do is they make a living off of bribes and things like that and and just getting through security and there's not only security at the airport but at the hotel and at all the tourist sites and everywhere you go and you got to get a give them an itinerary we're going as tourists there is only one message church there that we know of we're not going to preach we're not going to focus on that church we're actually going and holding a convention in alexandria and some other places i can't give you all the details because of the security issues but we're going to be going some other places and even into upper egypt we're going to have the opportunity to preach to quite a few different nominal churches that have invited us to come while we're there and and so i felt like i just i couldn't not do it if you understand it and once having the invitation the opportunity i felt like it was something that i had to do and so you just pray for us one of the things we were concerned about was covid and it's been such a hassle for us to go anywhere overseas because of the covet situation and i was actually the other day at the doctor's office and and i got a news on my phone and it showed up that they've actually dropped the covet requirements to come back to the us so we're going to be leaving on june 27th getting back on july 11th our meetings here start on july 14th so i want to be back for the meetings and it looks like that that's going to be a blessing not that i feel like we'd be positive but you know how those things go you might get a test that wasn't correct or something like that end up being stuck in a foreign country for two weeks and and so that was on my mind in fact i almost canceled the trip over that because i felt like my responsibility was to be here for the meetings but i believe the lord took care of that and if he took care of that one thing he can take care of all these other things that we're concerned about with the trip as well there's just many many things that i've had to be dealing with and it's a very expensive trip but again you know i just don't want to go where everybody else goes i i want to see the gospel spread to places where it hasn't been and believe me there's plenty of people that have not heard and and i could bring out the quotes to you today but brother branham taught us that if if you've ever heard it once he said then you don't have a we don't there's no obligation god doesn't have an obligation to tell you twice right if you've heard it once that's all he has to do and and then so the gospel has to go to others as well jesus said i've got others out of this fold so we know that that's part of our responsibility is to spread the gospel into places where it's not and one of the things we found out is there's very few messages translated into arabic in fact there are no tapes in that language and so we we're having translation work done we're paying to have books printed in egypt and somebody's got to do it and so since we're going we're going to do that and and so i kind of asked myself the question and i want to address that this afternoon why go why bother to go and i think it's because this gospel this gospel must be preached this gospel when i say this gospel i i mean what peter men in second peter chapter 1 and verse 12 where he says he said i want you to be established in the present truth the present truth the light of the hour is this gospel and i believe that only uh in under the the influence of the message of the hour can you preach the gospel in the way that uh in a way that will open people's eyes in the day and hour we live in now we know that many go and preach the gospel but what it does is it actually has a blinding effect which is why there will be no sweeping revival in this nation we know that right there will be no sweeping revival in this nation or the message of the hour because the people have actually been blinded by the preaching of the gospel that was the job of the two uh the two angels that went into sodom they went there and blinded the eyes of the people and brother branham liking that ministries like billy graham and oral roberts that they would actually blind the eyes of the people but that's not my job it's to blind the eyes but my job is to repeat a voice set that we've heard in our day how many know we've heard a voice in our day and that voice come from the throne of god and and my job is to repeat that and to open the eyes of the people not to blind them so we're not going to the sodomites we're going to the elect right we're going to the elect but to do that you've got to throw a net out you've got to you've got to preach the gospel now paul calls it my gospel in romans 16 25 he said now to him that is the power to establish you according to my gospel what what was he saying it was something different than what john the baptist had preached or even what jesus had preached it was the present truth he said and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to someone say all all nations for the obedience of faith so everyone has an opportunity brother branham was talking with a a man who was actually a great missionary himself by the name of e stanley jones one of the preeminent missionaries of the 20th century he said he was having dinner with him and he said brother branham he said i see most of your meeting it's made up of pentecostal people he said yes sir he said why so i said they're the ones that believe and he said well he said brother branham i think pentecost was a scaffold he said that god was going to put up a building and made pentecost a scaffold i said that's right i'll agree with you he said well see after the scaffold works done we don't need the scaffold anymore i said but the scaffold work isn't done we realize that today the work isn't done and listen to brother branham's reasoning on this he said when the building's completed god will take it up right amen people say well we don't need preachers no more we don't need missionaries no more why go why bother why spend your money and your time and and give your life to the preaching of the gospel because the scaffold work isn't done yet and until it's done we still need to build churches we still need to we still need to have church we still need to do the things that we do but most of all we need to preach the gospel right right we still need to preach the gospel because we're not preaching the gospel to promote this church this is not our gospel here at this church this is the gospel this is the word of the hour and it's not a one-man ministry anymore it's it's a it's a mini-membered body that come that comes under the headship of a one-man ministry right but the scaffold work isn't done he said we still need every step ladder he said every stepping stone right we need everything just exactly the building is still in making amen and when it's completed he said this gospel is preached to every kindred tongue and nation then jesus will return so i think if there's not books in arabic we need to print books in arabic if if there's not if there's not in in a tongue you say well some of them people understand english yes they do but if there's one nation or tongue that has not been put in then we need to do that but not just print the books we need to preach right because the gospel preached is a powerful thing the preached gospel is what separates the shaft from the weed it's what is what convicts the sinner of sin it's what brings people to god amen that's why we still believe in preaching around here amen now he said he said we've had plenty of passing out tracks and theology around the world but the gospel is not the bible altogether he said paul said the gospel came to us not in word only but through power and demonstrations of the holy ghost then when jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he meant go into all the world and demonstrate the power of god to every creature let me tell you what part of that is part of that and let me just let you in on a little bit of missionary work part of going is just you being there and putting up with the hassle of going and going through the hassle of being in the in the motel and being in an unfamiliar place and being far from home and spending your money and not getting paid to do it you don't get paid to do those trips you go over there you're paying your own way you're doing all of those things you begin to but just going through that you're showing something to those people they're learning that you love them right you're expressing something to them so the gospel is not just to preach not just to use words but to actually be there because when you're there you can pray for the sick and they can be healed when you're there you can take up serpents and it won't harm them they see you going and putting up with those things and giving your life for that and it represents something to them it represents christ amen that's why we still need to go to church by the way it's not it virtual church will never take over it is not it is not a substitute for being in the house of god it's good that we have it i'm glad we have it but it's not a substitute for being in the house of god because i need to see your face and you need to see mine and our spirits need to fellowship with one another as long as we're able amen there may come a day where we we're not able we saw that in covent there was a time when we were not able to gather together but as long as we're able to gather together we need to do it because there's something about being there you can demonstrate it not just preach it he said you've got to in order to preach the gospel he said before you can make it a gospel preach you've got to have the power and demonstration of the holy spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth he said the letter killeth the spirit maketh a lie so it's not just a ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of jesus christ living among men he said that's the faith i'm trying my best to contend for today that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever how many believe that he said and his power is unlimited and i love this he said if you can limit god you can limit christ yes think about it if you can limit god you can limit christ he said and if you limit the church today in its possibilities you're limiting god and we need to be careful about what satan does he'll try to come to and say well you're not a big enough church you don't have a good enough ministry you don't have a you're not widely known don't limit what the church can do right don't limit well let's leave that up to somebody else don't limit the chart what the church can do no limit the possibilities of the church don't say well we don't need preachers no more we don't need evangelists we don't need missionaries but he said if you limit the church in his possibilities you're limiting god he said but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believes you receive it you shall have it how many believe that today he said that he said i believe it and i know it's the truth brother branham makes a statement and he's talking here about the magi because he said they in one place he says they come from three different nations he said they represented ham shem and jfest people he said they come together from the east and here they come and he says this he said jesus said when this gospel is preached ham shem and japheth's people and the end shall come and that's africa asia and europe again he said jesus said when this gospel is preached this gospel is preached to all the world for a witness unto me then the end shall be he said then if what he was talking about was spreading out literature sending out missionaries he said well they have the internet well that's not what he's talking about sending out missionaries with reading writing and arithmetic passing out tracts and making people shake hands and believe that there is a god if that's all it was then he's far past his coming he said it shows the gospel paul said the gospel didn't come in the word only but through power and manifestations of the holy ghost then when jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel he said go into all the world and demonstrate he said i like that demonstrate the power of the gospel taking the word that what it says and show the people what it says amen that's what we're doing tonight show the people what it says and then make it manifest to them he said that's the way yes that proves it well i love it it's one thing to say it but then you got to prove it right just like your kids if you tell your kids so i love you but you got to prove it right right they're not going to believe it you got to say if you say i'm a message believer live the life if you live the life that's going to prove to the people and it won't be like we were talking about earlier with alan where where someone hears you from the message and they shy away from it because of some life that somebody's lived that's been crazy but it'll be a real genuine article i've told you the story about brother daniel embarrass him tonight but i was getting my car towed from my house one day and i and i mentioned brother danny or i mentioned the church he asked me i told him i was a pastor he said what church you pastor i told him what church i didn't mean nothing to him but i told him i said well brother danny ward goes there and he said oh i said i know danny he said there's no better man he went on and on about how good of a man danny was see danny demonstrated the gospel right it wasn't just just being there but demonstrating the gospel not just saying word of life tabernacle but becoming the word of life to the people amen you understand that tonight you're written epistles read of all men i'm not gonna hold you much longer i know you're tired i'm surprised everybody's not asleep by now jeremy's still awake on the front row i know he's got to write and take notes to stay awake too so brother branham said now he talks about uh paris read head and talks about if you remember he was a great missionary as well head of sedan missions he come to brother branham and he went all over the world spreading giving tracks out and books and things and he said but he said that we met the challenge of that muslim religion and they were he was unable to meet that challenge he come to brother branham he said i'm missing something something missing brother branham led him to the baptism of the holy ghost and become a great missionary after that much greater than he was before and as far as what he knew and brother branham says this and he talks about how that you were marked with the ear in the year of jubilee you all remember the story how that god how that the slave was marked through the ear if he refused to hear the call he talked about how god marks his and satan marks his he said god marks his by vindicating his promised word through them god marks his children that's how you know who you are by vindicating his promised word through them he said and he said saint john 14 12 and mark 16 jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe and brother brown gets very straight here he said now let's just take that a minute was he joking and i'd like for us to respond to that this morning was he joking did he just mean the apostles as some would tell us he said watch he said read the background go you where he said all the world preach the gospel to what every creature and brother branham said it has not even one third of the way met it yet he said these signs shall follow in all the world every creature wherever this gospel is preached these signs shall follow them that believe and that's the promise that we have we can't make it happen but he said it would follow yes right and we can't produce it but he said it would follow he said now listen he gets very straight he said notice he said not to just one little handful notice all the world every creature these signs shall follow he said don't take satan's unbelieving mark he said he'll put it on you tonight if he can do it he'll poke you up against the wall he said you'd walk out and say i don't know about that he said you go home and study it be sincere and pray he said because everything is too perfectly scriptural at this very hour this sacred hour in time or if we can only see what hour we live in today he said it's done been for years proved come right up to it and this is the hour this is the time amen what is it this gospel has to be preached now he said i can show you in the bible where god gave his church the authority by using his name by faith to cast out evil spirits to heal the sick and to do great signs and wonders i can show you where it was given to the church but there's no record in bible nowhere where he ever took that power away from the church or said he would take it away from the church but this gospel i love this of this same deliverance yes how many believe we have the same deliverance that they did this gospel of this same deliverance was to be preached to all nations beginning at jerusalem and we was to be witnesses of him in jerusalem judea samaria to the uttermost parts of the earth to this gospel and these signs was to follow the believer until he comes again go you into all the world amen and brother branham explain that how that it went from the uh from the gospel came from the east and went all the way west he said and then it goes back again to the east that's where we're working today that's where the focus of the message the hour is today is on the eastern people because it's the last group that haven't been reached yet there's people have to hear whether they turn it down or whether they accept it they have to hear now look he said go into all the world just only one third of it knows about jesus now after 1900 years and all the world preached the gospel he said no the gospel is not the word only but making the word manifest paul says so gospel came not on word only but through the power and manifestation of the holy spirit is the gospel must be preached to every nation these signs shall follow them to believe he said we just can't cut that out we've got to face it he said brother ben wouldn't that be scary to go into a place like that and in a way yes but we've got to face that god said he would do it yeah at some point we have to do that and you know and in science and technology and i'm glad we live where we do trust me i'm happy for this country i'm happy to be here you're never happier to be here than if you come back from another place and realize how blessed we are as a nation and yet we ca we've got to face it at some point you know in this nation we we put everything off where we don't really have to face anything because there's always a doctor there's always money there's always something that'll take care to get us out of our problem but i've noticed in places where they just have to face up to and say lord i'm gonna die unless you help me i found when people have to face it god answers yes and sometimes you just have to face it he said we can't just cut it out we've got to face it god still heals the fit we've got to face that right if you get to a place where the doctor can't do you any more good you'll have to face that god still heals the sick god still raises the dead god still god still saves our children do we believe that we're getting to a place church the world is getting bad enough that we've got to get to a place where we still face that yes say i believe god still does it and be like those three who were children who stood there and said it doesn't matter that he's able to deliver us but even if he doesn't we won't bow to your idol right amen see god chose to use preaching to save the lost first corinthians 1 18 says the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god i wonder if some people are saved we don't want to hear preaching i wonder if we're saved because he said unto us which are saved it's the power of god it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudence where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world i thought god made foolish the wisdom of this world he said for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief and he doesn't say foolish preaching because preaching should not be foolish but he said the foolishness of preaching in other words the manner and the actions of preaching and the way that it's done is foolishness to the world he said the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews of stumbling block unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god amen you see we are the voice of many waters we are the voice of many waters and and by extension you know this church you support ministry and so you support the voice of many waters you have a a stake in that voice because the voice of many waters is the gospel ministry and psalms 29 and 3 it says the voice of the lord is upon the waters it's the multitudes of people the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters revelation 1 and 12 says i turned to see the voices spake with me notice a voice spoke with john being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man called with the garment down to the foot gerd about the patch with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters now watch he heard a voice speaking but now he hears a voice as the sound of many waters brother branham explains that he said all right voice what a horrible thing for a drifting soul in the sea of life no pilate to guide him loose floating with the tithes to hear the roar of the great cataracts the false what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting that's why people don't like preaching because the soul is drifting he said what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting a voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age now notice the voice of many waters many waters was also the voice of the seven stars because these are the men who were faithfully taught and under our messenger brother branham said we become the final voice to the final age right so now he says the voice of those seven stars to every church age preaching notice what they preach the baptism of the holy ghost do we still preach that today hey man go push through your tiredness now and say amen we still preach it today the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues amen the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters came forth from this one that looked like the son of man many waters yes amen many waters notice mark 16 says go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover who's he talking to the voice of many waters this voice of many waters was going to go and was going to be felt and was going to be heard in the quietest places in every corner of the earth and you know where can your voice be heard the loudest well there's few other voices i think of brother hildebrand that went to africa many times when he was younger and i didn't know where the hillary personally but when i went to africa i met people who he had ministered to decades before and said because brother hildebrandt went that's why we have a church that's why we believe and and my hat's off to him today as he just passed away he's gone on to his reward thinker brother biscuit who i heard went some 169 times in 50 years left his church and went overseas and i don't plan on doing that by the way i'm not brother biscuit i don't have that kind of ministry but i think a brother perry green that went around the world many times to hundreds of nations it was a personal friend of mine i seen brother wilson going for three or more trips a year for nearly 30 years but those men are getting older and somebody's got to be a voice and somebody's got to support that voice and keep it strong somebody's got to do it might as well be us huh say well we can't well don't limit the church yeah sure in its possibilities right what you believe you can be is what you're going to be yeah i see this church full one day not from other churches coming but but from people that have been born again yeah now it may it may never get to that place but indulge me in my in my folly if you would i don't i don't want to see just one or two people i want to see it fall if it never gets to that i'm not going to leave because there's few people but i believe god's got people yeah or there still wouldn't be a church here right there's a reason why we're still here there's a reason why he called me to preach there's a reason why he called you to come to the house of god and support the word there's a reason for it and so if he called us to be here then let's have a big enough vision that we can see it we can look in the future when you see god you're doing something and then if he comes and takes us out of here we'll be ready to go because we're preaching a message amen that makes us ready hey man but we're not it's not just us for no more let's get everyone that we can take with us if we really believe that we're going to walk on streets of gold if we really believe that we're going to be in a body that's perfect that that we never have to worry about no more if we believe like i preached last sunday night we're going to be sitting at that table thousands of miles long and the son of man himself is going to come down and wipe the tears away from our eyes if we really believe that why wouldn't we want everybody to go and sit at that table with us why wouldn't we i wonder sometimes how much we really believe it if we really believe it why wouldn't we want to live every day of our life say lord help me be a light if i get an opportunity to be a witness let me be that witness i think that's what those brothers that i mentioned have done somebody's got to do it today somebody's got to keep it up in revelation 19 5 a voice come out of the throne and said praise our god all ye his servants ye that fear him both small and great one voice yes from the throne our message didn't come from indiana it didn't come from from tucson it didn't come from hardy arkansas come from the throne a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants you that fear him both small and great one voice verse 6 said then i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many waters as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth many voices what are the many voices saying verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready what was it the many voices echoing what the one voice has said and they echo and what are they saying make yourself ready amen that's my job but it's also your job because i can't do it without you and those that are watching and those from our local congregation that are that are here you support me and and and i'm able to do this because of you and i'm so grateful the lord just worked it out because we could never normally take a trip like this but the lord's just worked it out where we could not because we have wealthy people in the church but because god just saw fit that we would have just enough to be able to go and it's a very expensive trip but god knows what we need and i don't always know what's going to be in the future i don't know i may never go on another trip again i don't know i mean i go on this trip we don't know but i know this if i have the opportunity to go and he provides me the means to go and gives me a desire to go i want to go yeah i want to go because there might be somebody and i don't care what church they end up in but there might be somebody who i could be the voice of many waters too just one voice out of many that would sit there at that table let me be one who's not afraid to go i think we could all say that tonight i know this is focused more on ministry i think we could all say that let me be one who's not afraid to go yeah let me be one who really cares about this message one of the things that we've lost over the years i think is and there was much if i could explain it you know years ago it seemed like in the message we really cared about the message but sometimes we cared about the wrong things we cared about dates and places and things were places where brother branham had been and all those things were good but but we cared more about that in a prophet's life and then later on we realized it wasn't that it was the word yeah it was the word but i i'd like to see that same level of care towards the word not towards the places or or the people or or the family name but but but to bring people to the word to bring people under the message of the hour we cared about those things because we believe that god sent a prophet but god sent a prophet with a voice he had something to say what did he say hey man he said come out of her my people what are we going to repeat come out of her my people with the opportunity when we go we've had several probably eight or nine churches uh nominal churches that have asked us to come and preach i'd never have that opportunity here in the u.s i'm gonna go lord will and if he allows me to go we're gonna go and preach to those people like i said it's a country where you could get stopped on the way you might get stopped at a checkpoint never be able to go but i believe if god's helped us this far he'll help us get to the places where we need to be and talk to the people we need to talk to why don't you just make that your prayer tonight because you know you you talk to people too and i know some of you have expressed to me and said brother ben how can i talk to somebody i said just be there for them and sometimes i just have to be there sometimes you just have to go and be there and god will give you the words to say don't think so much about what you're going to say as just being there at the right time god will give you the words to say you see you want something to be associated of value with your life right what's it going to be worth when you get home what are you going to leave behind i could leave a bigger house i could i could drive a nicer car i could do that right now i could go take the money and spend it on a nicer car but i wanted something of value i want something that'll last we could spend a lot of money and go on big vacations and we vacationed in the past and you all have been good to us and when i worked i i took my family on vacation i'm not speaking against that but we can do a lot of things but i want to do something if i'm going to spend money you know the way inflation's going up money don't mean anything anyway but if we're going to spend money let's spend on something good you say well you know gas money's getting the place gas price getting places we can't come to church no more because it's too expensive i tell you what if i was going to cut something out it wouldn't be church [Music] because it's the only thing of value that i've got see brother brandon said nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value in it money passes away homes decay and go away everything in the earth moves away he said the only value lasting value he said i'd rather have one soul in glory than i won to christ to know and see think about this for a moment as we close the musicians come he said to know and see that the light of god circles around that soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that think about that because amen because i supported the ministry or i preached the gospel or or i was part of it in some way he didn't say you had to be the one who went he said but if you can't go send somebody and you all have done that faithfully i'm not asking for your money tonight it's just what you've done that to know and see that that light of god circles around that soul through all eternity he said my name to be associated with that he said then to have every penny of money in the whole earth because i'd have to lose it all he said but what you send up there is eternal right and that's the reason we're trying that's the reason let's bow our heads together i want to take somebody with me i i want to see us as a church just i know we're not all here tonight and maybe i should have done this on a sunday morning when more would be here but maybe they'll hear this i know most most of the folks listen i want us to renew our vow as a church to get this gospel to the world and i know you've given sacrificially you've supported missions you've paid your tithes and done that but i what i need now is your prayers i need to know that you're you're 100 percent behind it in the sense that i'm i like i said i don't know what will happen but i need to know that you'll say brother ben i i'm going to support a work any work and i'll say this not just our church not just what our church does because it's just a small part but i'll support any work that gets this message to the people of god i won't let personal issues hinder that and i've seen that too many times among believers where brothers will get because of personal issues with one another they'll they'll not support certain works i don't believe in that every opportunity i get i want to support a work that's getting people to christ and and maybe we would go and and it wouldn't be as successful as what we would like but what is success if we can get one soul and be worth more than 10 000 worlds what about your neighbors what about your friends what about the people at the grocery store i believe there's somebody you could witness to today this message is as powerful as it was when i was a child and i remember what it was like when we would gather around a tape player and listen to the the tapes of a prophet remember what it was like in that feeling that we were listening to something that was wonderful and time has kind of taken away a lot of that and sometimes we we realized people made mistakes and they they pointed to the wrong things but what are we going to point to today that message is still as real as it was when brother branham preached it it's still the same message it's the message of the hour it's not the message of a man but it's the message of the hour and we preached that to you this morning we're in the land of the promises we're not halfway there two-thirds of the way there we're living there we're not preaching a man we're not preaching the words of a man we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the unfailing words of the the body word of the son of man you believe that tonight amen just just search your heart say lord if there's a way that i can help in some way lord i want to pray i'm going to do everything i can commit myself to getting this gospel out this gospel must be preached and then then the end will come heavenly father we're so thankful to be one who is a minister of your gospel today lord and i'm so thankful for these who are supporters and some ministers here as well who are people who i think of different ones who've committed themselves i think of some of the elderly people maybe they they went through a time when getting the message out was hard work and they witnessed to their neighbors and the people at the factory and some of them typed up books and and did that but maybe there's not a need of that so much here as so many people have heard and have access to different things in their language lord there's still a need in other lands and i pray god that you'd help them lord to recognize that and whatever we can do lord we want to do it lord and not not just go aimlessly but to go with a message go knowing that you said these signs shall follow them that believe not only to preach the gospel but to demonstrate the gospel to the people demonstrate the love of christ demonstrate the power of christ demonstrate that you are a healer demonstrate that you are a savior i believe you are that tonight lord if there's one here that needs lord that healing or that saving power i pray you'd move down in the congregation lord even as we sing and as we worship the heart that you perform your good work in their life i pray that you do that lord make missionaries out of these children put a spark in them lord lord as you you caused me to know men lord that went all over the seas and and and traveled the world spreading this gospel and i got to know him as a child and lord it put a spark in me to want to preach the message lord may it be so with these children these young people lord may they get a spark in them lord that when they get older if you tarry that they'd want to get that last seed because we know when that last one comes in it comes to their place we'll be gone we thank you for that lord help us to have a big vision lord beyond ourselves and the four walls of this church may we see you moving lord and every part of the earth we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it in jesus name amen amen hallelujah can you sing it now let's just stand
