[36:45] moment of prayer. If you've got a
[36:47] special need you'd like to make known to
[36:49] the Lord, but we've uplifted hand. God
[36:51] sees every heart. He knows every need.
[36:53] Heavenly Father, I think of those that
[36:55] are gathered around the bed of a loved
[36:57] one tonight. And Lord, that may be
[37:00] perhaps grieving in their hearts. I pray
[37:02] you'd comfort them, Lord. I pray you'd
[37:04] strengthen them for the hour that
[37:06] they're going through. I pray you'd heal
[37:09] the sick, Lord. And and these needs that
[37:11] were represented by way of uplifted
[37:12] hand.
[37:13] I I don't know what they are, but you
[37:15] know, Lord, and I pray, God, that you'd
[37:16] meet those needs. That there would not
[37:19] be one leave here to tonight that
[37:21] wouldn't feel like that you had done
[37:23] that for them, Lord. Not just feel it,
[37:25] but to know it, Lord, because it's
[37:27] according to your word, Lord. You
[37:30] promise to meet our needs and we're
[37:31] believing that tonight. I pray that
[37:33] you'd move move me out of the way. Speak
[37:35] to your people tonight, Lord. I I pray
[37:38] for revelation tonight because we know
[37:40] that's the greatest thing that you could
[37:42] give us, Lord, is a revelation of where
[37:44] we are and who we are. But you grant it,
[37:46] Lord, we ask in Jesus name. Amen. Thank
[37:50] the
[37:51] Lord. Thank the
[37:55] Lord. Amen. I'm going to go
[38:01] uh we're going to go
[38:04] to actually
[38:06] did something I've never done
[38:08] before. I didn't put my opening
[38:10] scripture on
[38:12] the on my
[38:15] notes. So, we're going to go to Genesis
[38:17] chapter 30 and verse 22. It's down
[38:19] there, brother Peter. You'll have a
[38:21] challenge tonight that it's there. It's
[38:23] just not at the beginning. I got some
[38:26] things on my heart tonight. I just want
[38:28] to preach to you. And I I was trying
[38:30] diff very uh it's very difficult for me
[38:33] to pare it down to where we could do
[38:35] this on a Wednesday night because
[38:37] there's just a lot here. We're going to
[38:39] continue our series on the 12 sons of
[38:41] Jacob. I don't know if you've been
[38:42] keeping track, but we've got Manasseh
[38:45] and uh and Ephraim who were Joseph's
[38:48] sons. So that's tonight. And then we'll
[38:50] deal with uh we'll deal with Benjamin
[38:53] and then we'll be done with that. And
[38:55] that'll be just kind of a segue into the
[38:57] next part of what we want to
[38:59] do. So, Genesis 30:22, "And God
[39:03] remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to
[39:05] her and opened her womb, and she
[39:07] conceived and bare a son, and said, God
[39:10] hath taken away my reproach." And she
[39:13] called his name Joseph, and said, "The
[39:16] Lord shall add to me another son." Pray
[39:20] the Lord would add his blessing to the
[39:21] word. You may be seated this evening.
[39:25] You know, we're not put here on the
[39:27] earth just to
[39:28] survive, but each one of us has a unique
[39:32] place in the kingdom of God. We've got a
[39:35] part to play. It would be like if you
[39:38] got hired onto a factory. And I don't
[39:41] know how many of you have worked in
[39:42] factories, but when they hire you to a
[39:44] factory, no one releases a new hire onto
[39:47] the floor without a specific job to do
[39:50] or something to learn. Because if all
[39:53] you did was hire people and and send
[39:56] them out, Stewart, if all you did was
[39:58] hire people and send them out to
[39:59] tractors, you'd have a problem because
[40:01] they don't know what they're doing.
[40:03] Unless them tractors drive themselves
[40:04] these days, they may do that, but but
[40:07] they they just don't know what they're
[40:08] doing. They need training and they need
[40:10] placing. They need to be put in a
[40:12] specific area and and and and something
[40:15] something that they can do. And so when
[40:17] God uh when we're birthed into the
[40:19] kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost, we are
[40:21] not uh we're not put there just to
[40:24] wander around and and just just be
[40:27] children of God, but we're called to a
[40:29] purpose and to a place. And that's what
[40:32] we've been talking about when we talk
[40:33] about our allotment. We're talking about
[40:35] our place, not just in heaven because we
[40:38] want to have a place in heaven, don't
[40:39] we? Every one of us want to have a place
[40:41] there. I believe we already have a
[40:43] theophony body, a word body over there
[40:46] waiting for us. But that's not what
[40:48] we're uh concerned about so much here.
[40:51] We're concerned about what our place is
[40:53] here. What are we supposed to be doing
[40:55] while we're down here? Because there is
[40:57] something for every one of us to do. And
[41:00] brother Brandham had a a problem with
[41:02] the Pentecostals. Even the ones who were
[41:05] doing what they were supposed to do
[41:07] didn't want to be doing that. So they
[41:09] were always looking over at somebody
[41:10] else and and we don't preach enough I
[41:13] don't think on envy and and and on
[41:16] things like that because uh and
[41:18] emulations as as Paul talks about in
[41:21] Galatians because so many times we look
[41:23] at somebody else and say I want their
[41:25] life. I I want to be more like them. I
[41:28] wish we were more like them and wish we
[41:30] had uh you know the the American dream
[41:33] that they have. But that may not be our
[41:36] place. God may have called us to
[41:38] something completely different from that
[41:40] and God wants to place you. But the
[41:42] Brandon said God wants to place the
[41:44] church. He said, "But every one of them
[41:46] wants to do the same thing." That's that
[41:48] first quote of the Peter uh back there.
[41:50] Brother Peter's filling in tonight on on
[41:52] several different things. And he said,
[41:54] "God wants to place the church, but
[41:56] every one of them wants to do the same
[41:58] thing." I say, "God, ma, make make me do
[42:01] what you want me to do. I want to be put
[42:03] in the place you want me in." See, I can
[42:05] put somebody in a place. The church
[42:07] could put somebody in a place, but
[42:09] that's not the same as God putting you
[42:11] in a place. So, God wants to place the
[42:14] church. In 1 Corinthians 12:29, Paul
[42:16] says, "Are all apostles? Are all
[42:18] prophets? Are all teachers? Are all
[42:20] workers of miracles?" I'd say it'd be a
[42:22] good thing to be a worker of miracles,
[42:24] but not everybody's geared that way.
[42:27] It'd be a good thing to be an apostle,
[42:28] but not everybody's geared. Not
[42:30] everybody's gifted to be an apostle or a
[42:32] prophet. And not everybody's gifted to
[42:34] be a teacher. We can say amen to that.
[42:36] Not everybody is. But that doesn't
[42:37] discount what they are gifted to do,
[42:40] right? They're gifted to do something.
[42:42] It's just not all the same. And it'd be
[42:44] pretty boring if we were all the same.
[42:46] If every preacher that was behind this
[42:48] pulpit was just like me, it'd be really
[42:50] boring. You'd get really tired of me and
[42:53] you'd get really tired of them. But God
[42:55] called a diversity of ministry. He said,
[42:57] "Have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[42:59] speak with tongues? Do all interpret?"
[43:02] So, in other words, he's asking the
[43:04] question, knowing the answer, it's
[43:06] rhetorical question. No, they they don't
[43:08] all speak with tongues. We don't all
[43:10] have gifts of healing. We don't all
[43:11] interpret. He said, "But covet earnestly
[43:14] the best gifts." And Paul teaches us us
[43:17] that prophecy was the best
[43:20] gift because it could be understood,
[43:23] right? and could help the soul. And you
[43:26] could extrapolate from that and say that
[43:27] the best thing we could do is preach the
[43:30] gospel and witness the gospel to to
[43:33] those that haven't heard it. And yet he
[43:35] said, "I show unto you a more excellent
[43:36] way." The more excellent way was love.
[43:39] And so each one of us, we come to our
[43:41] gifts. Brother Brandon said, "If you
[43:43] come to your gift or your place without
[43:45] love," he said, then it still won't
[43:47] work. So it'll just be a mess. So love
[43:49] is the more excellent way. So we've got
[43:51] to come to our place. If you know this
[43:54] is your land, see, you're going to face
[43:56] storms. You're you're going to have
[43:58] battles. As brother Joel said Sunday
[44:00] morning, you're going to have to fight
[44:01] for your possession. And if you know
[44:03] that you're where you're supposed to be,
[44:06] then you it's easier to fight. But if
[44:08] you're not sure that that hill's worth
[44:10] dying on, it's much much more difficult
[44:13] to fight. It's why the defending army
[44:15] always if they're on their home turf,
[44:17] they always have an advantage because
[44:19] they they're fighting for something.
[44:21] that land belongs to them. It's why the
[44:24] in the Civil War, the North had a great
[44:26] advantage in men and in material and in
[44:29] money, but they just couldn't seem to
[44:31] whoop the Confederates. And it took them
[44:33] a very long time to do it because the
[44:35] Confederacy was fighting on their own
[44:37] land. And when the Confederates left
[44:39] their land and went into the north, they
[44:41] lost at Gettysburg. So, they were
[44:44] fighting for for their own land. We're
[44:46] fighting tonight for our own land. We're
[44:49] fighting for what God's put us here for.
[44:51] And if we understand what that is, if
[44:53] you understand that, yeah, God called me
[44:56] to be a preacher or God called me to be
[44:58] a deacon or God called me to be here be
[45:01] a factory worker. God called me to raise
[45:03] a family. God called me to mother my
[45:05] children. Whatever it is that he called
[45:07] you to do, if you know that God called
[45:09] you to do that, you can stand in that
[45:11] position. When Satan comes against you,
[45:13] you can say, "Devil, you're I know what
[45:15] you're doing. You're not against me.
[45:17] You're trying to move me off my
[45:18] position. So, this is exactly where I'm
[45:21] going to stay. I'm not going to move
[45:23] just because I'm not going to move away
[45:25] from my position just because it gets
[45:26] hard, but I'm going to fight the fight
[45:28] right where I'm at. And every one of us
[45:30] is going to have to do that because
[45:32] we're going to be challenged in our
[45:34] position. So, and it's not just for
[45:36] church officers. It's for each one of
[45:39] us. Not not placing us so much in
[45:41] offices or even in gifts, but placing us
[45:43] in Christ. Until we know I belong in the
[45:47] word of this day. I belong in the
[45:49] message of the hour. I belong in Christ.
[45:52] I know who I am and whose I am. I know
[45:54] where I belong. I know I know what time
[45:57] it is. I know what time we're living in.
[45:59] And so I'm not going to be dissuaded.
[46:01] I'm not going to be turned aside. I'm
[46:02] not going to be pushed away from my
[46:05] position in my land. So, Brother Brand,
[46:08] and I'm just kind of backgrounding where
[46:09] we're going tonight, and I hope I have
[46:11] time. I'm I'm not using a lot of quotes
[46:13] tonight because I'm trying to move
[46:15] through it more quickly. We use several
[46:17] scriptures. Brother Brandham talks a lot
[46:19] about adoption before the opening of the
[46:22] seals. If you've studied the message,
[46:23] you'll find he talks a lot about
[46:25] adoption, but he does talk about
[46:27] adoption after that, but very rarely.
[46:29] And and a question come to my mind, why
[46:31] is that? And it occurred to me the other
[46:33] day that you know this message is our
[46:36] adoption. So Paul talks where brother
[46:38] Brown takes adoption is from Galatians
[46:40] chapter 4. And Paul talks about how the
[46:43] law was a tutor and a governor until
[46:46] Christ came. Right? He said a son
[46:49] doesn't differ from a servant until the
[46:51] time appointed of the father. And when
[46:53] Christ came it was a time of adoption.
[46:57] So so all that was just a tutor. All the
[46:59] law was was just a a school master. Paul
[47:02] says to bring us to Christ. And we've
[47:04] come through a time like that as well.
[47:06] We come through denominational ages that
[47:09] was a tutor and a school master to bring
[47:11] us to the land of adoption. And so we're
[47:14] now living in that land. Brother
[47:15] Brandham says in the adoption series, he
[47:17] said that the Holy Ghost is the land is
[47:19] the Holy Ghost. He said when you're born
[47:21] into the kingdom of God, you're born
[47:23] into the land, right? But you're not a
[47:25] full-g grown adult yet. You're born into
[47:28] the land, but you've not yet been placed
[47:29] in the land. What does that? It's the
[47:31] Holy Spirit by the opening of the word
[47:34] that puts you in your position. It's the
[47:36] message of the hour. Not just the letter
[47:38] of it, but the spirit of it. The It's
[47:40] the Holy Ghost working in the message of
[47:42] the hour to put you exactly where you
[47:44] need to be where you know I am a word
[47:46] bride and let let sickness come. Let
[47:48] disease come. Let let troubles come in
[47:51] the church. Let strife come in my
[47:52] family. But I know who I am. I know
[47:55] where I belong. I'm not going to be
[47:57] knocked away by that. but I belong to
[47:59] God.
[48:02] And so we have to come to our adoption
[48:03] because the devil's fighting like never
[48:06] before. So this message is our adoption.
[48:08] It's not a fourth work of grace or some
[48:10] kind of a a a super thing. Well, you got
[48:13] the Holy Ghost, but now you got to go
[48:15] back to the altar and get adopted.
[48:16] That's not what it is. This message is
[48:18] our adoption. This message is the Joshua
[48:21] ministry that makes us recognize who we
[48:23] are as the bride.
[48:25] So the fullness of Christ the word
[48:27] brought us away from the school master
[48:29] in into the adoption of sons that
[48:31] happened in our day. And we know that
[48:33] the message was not William Brandham. It
[48:36] was not brother Brandham. The message
[48:37] was Christ, right? It was brought by
[48:40] brother Brandham but it was the me the
[48:43] message was Christ. We do not find our
[48:45] position in the Brandom family. We don't
[48:48] find our position in the Puit family.
[48:50] You go a step further. We don't find our
[48:52] position in Word of Life tabernacle. We
[48:55] find our position in Christ. And then
[48:57] we'll find our position in the in the
[48:59] church, but after we find our position
[49:02] in Christ. So our position is not
[49:05] subject to the whims of I'm so grateful
[49:07] for that today. See, you're not your
[49:10] position in Christ doesn't depend on
[49:12] whether I make it or not. Right? And so
[49:15] many people say, well, you know, if you
[49:16] you can't live any higher than your
[49:18] pastor. So you know what? You if your
[49:20] pastor fails, you're going to fail.
[49:21] That's not true. Because I've had many
[49:23] teachers and pastors, men who helped me,
[49:25] but they didn't maybe go all the way
[49:27] into the promises of God. But I'm going
[49:29] to go all the way. I in my heart, I want
[49:31] to go all the way. And if I fail to go
[49:33] all the way, if I fail to make a
[49:35] rapture, I trust that won't hinder you
[49:37] from making one. Brother Brandham said,
[49:38] if I don't have faith to go there
[49:40] myself, he said, I won't hinder somebody
[49:41] else from going there. So, so our
[49:45] position is not in Word of Life
[49:47] tabernacle. You're not sitting here
[49:48] waiting for me to tell you whether or
[49:50] not you're a Christian. That's not why
[49:52] you're here. You know you are a
[49:54] Christian. You've been born into the
[49:55] kingdom of God. And so what you're
[49:57] waiting on is food that you can eat.
[49:59] Amen. So that you can grow into the full
[50:02] measure of the grace of
[50:04] God. So don't it's not dependent on my
[50:08] whims. Because, you know, I think that's
[50:10] maybe why we don't see spoken word as
[50:12] far as the the speaking of it like we
[50:15] would want to because some of us would
[50:16] be speaking people out of
[50:18] existence all the time. You know, we'd
[50:21] just we'd just be we'd just be carnal
[50:24] with it. And God didn't allow us to do
[50:26] that. He said if we were inspired, we
[50:29] could speak. Brother Brandham didn't
[50:31] even go around using it. He used it five
[50:33] times. I believe in in in his ministry
[50:36] that God showed him that that was
[50:37] possible. But I believe we're a bride
[50:39] who has that within us. Now, we're not
[50:42] again, it's our position in Christ. Now,
[50:44] as we have that in our minds now as we
[50:46] come to Joseph and and his two sons.
[50:49] Now, God remembered Rachel in Genesis
[50:51] 30:22. And God hearkened to her and
[50:53] opened her womb and she conceived and
[50:55] bear a son and said, "God had taken away
[50:57] reproach and she called his name Joseph
[51:00] and said, "The Lord shall add to me
[51:01] another son." Joseph means addition or
[51:04] increase. And we've went into the life
[51:05] of Joseph recently, so we won't go back
[51:08] into the life of Joseph. Joseph a as a
[51:11] tribe, they he would not inherit as an
[51:13] individual, but his two sons would
[51:15] inherit. And the reason for that is
[51:17] because there would be 12 tribes plus
[51:20] Levi, right? So Levi was held out as
[51:24] belonging to God. They would not get a
[51:25] portion on the land. So there would be
[51:27] 12 aotments plus Levi. for there had to
[51:29] be an extra child which was the two two
[51:33] sons of one replaced Levi and one uh one
[51:36] being the 12th who were 12 tribes. Now
[51:39] uh and and one replacing Joseph himself
[51:42] or or substituting for Joseph himself.
[51:44] So Genesis 41:50 it says unto Joseph
[51:47] were born two sons before the years of
[51:49] famine came which Asenthus the daughter
[51:50] of Potifer priest of barren to him and
[51:53] Joseph called the name of the firstborn
[51:56] Manasseh. For God said, "Heath made me
[51:58] forget all my toil and all my father's
[52:01] house." Manasse means caused to
[52:04] forget. Caused to forget. In Genesis
[52:08] 41:52, it says, "The name of the second
[52:10] called he Ephraim." Ephraim. For God
[52:13] hath caused me to be fruitful in the
[52:16] land of my affliction. The name Ephraim
[52:18] means double fruit. Double fruit. And so
[52:22] Manasseh and Ephraim were born to him
[52:24] there in Egypt. And so it came to pass
[52:27] in Genesis 48:1 after these things that
[52:29] one told Joseph, "Behold, thy father is
[52:31] sick." And he took with him his two
[52:32] sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. So Joseph
[52:35] understands that his two sons need to
[52:37] inherit, need to get a blessing from his
[52:39] father. And one told Jacob, and said,
[52:42] "Behold, thy son, Joseph, cometh unto
[52:43] thee." And Israel strengthened himself,
[52:45] and sat upon the bed. And Jacob said to
[52:48] Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
[52:49] loves in the land of Canaan, and blessed
[52:51] me, and said unto me, Behold, I'll make
[52:53] thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and
[52:55] I'll make of thee a multitude of people,
[52:57] will give this land of thy seed after
[52:58] thee for an everlasting possession. And
[53:00] now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh,
[53:03] which were born unto thee in the land of
[53:04] Egypt, before I came unto thee in Egypt,
[53:06] are mine. So he's adopting them. He's
[53:08] taking them in. He said, "As Reuben and
[53:11] Simeon, they shall be mine, and thy
[53:13] issue which thou begetest after them
[53:16] shall be thine, and shall be called
[53:17] after the name of their brethren, and
[53:19] their inheritance." Are you Am I losing
[53:21] you yet? I hope you can stay with me as
[53:23] we read these scriptures. So, they were
[53:25] basically adopted as sons by Jacob,
[53:28] giving Joseph a double portion in the
[53:30] allotment. Now, why would Joseph get a
[53:32] double portion? Remember, the birthright
[53:35] was Joseph's. We read this before, but 1
[53:37] Chronicles 5:2, Judah prevailed above
[53:40] his brethren. Of him came the chief
[53:41] ruler, but the birthright was Joseph's.
[53:44] The birthright went to the second
[53:46] youngest son because a patriarch had the
[53:49] right to change the birthight from the
[53:52] oldest to the younger. So he changes it.
[53:55] Remember, Reuben lost his birthight
[53:57] because of what he did. And so the
[53:59] birthright went to Joseph. So the right
[54:02] of birth, the birthright gave him a
[54:03] double portion as it as it would in the
[54:06] in the lineage, that portion fell to
[54:08] Ephraim and Manasseh. So the portion of
[54:10] Ephraim and Manasseh was actually very
[54:13] large. If you look at a map of the 12
[54:15] tribes, and maybe you can go find one
[54:17] and reference to it on the internets and
[54:19] you can find lots of maps, but you'll
[54:22] find that Ephraim and Manasseh were took
[54:24] up maybe I I think Ephraim itself
[54:26] probably had more territory than all the
[54:27] rest of the tribes combined. And
[54:29] Manasseh then was a very large tribe as
[54:31] well and actually was in two parts. One
[54:33] part which stayed on the other side of
[54:35] Jordan as we've already talked about and
[54:37] then one part which went on in the land.
[54:39] And so they they were very favored in
[54:42] among the people of Israel, among the
[54:44] children of Israel. And yet they failed
[54:46] in many ways to achieve their potential
[54:49] in the land. So what we're talking about
[54:51] tonight, if we can wrap our minds around
[54:53] this and put it in a way that we can
[54:55] understand, we're talking about people
[54:57] who were blessed
[54:59] blessed had every advantage and and and
[55:03] their blessing actually turned against
[55:06] them because it turns into pride. Yeah.
[55:10] So it's a blessing that turns into
[55:13] pride, right? That's the story of
[55:16] Ephraim and Manasseh. So in Joshua
[55:18] chapter 16, Joshua uh gives the the
[55:22] children of Manasseh and Ephraim, the
[55:24] children of Joseph, he gives them their
[55:26] territory. And he describes how how
[55:28] large it is in verses one, two, and
[55:31] three. And in verse four, he says, "So
[55:34] the children of Joseph, Manasseh and
[55:35] Ephraim took their
[55:38] inheritance." And then in in these two
[55:40] tribes, we find that though each was
[55:43] very large, Manasseh was the weaker. and
[55:47] Ephraim was the stronger. Manasseh was
[55:51] the weaker and Ephraim was the stronger.
[55:56] Now,
[55:58] uh Manasseh was the firstborn, remember?
[56:01] And Ephraim was the second born, but
[56:05] Manasseh was weaker than Ephraim. It's
[56:08] because Jacob's arms were crossed. You
[56:10] all know the story. We're going to read
[56:12] the scripture in just a moment, but
[56:14] Jacob's arms were crossed. So when
[56:15] Joseph brings the boys to him to bless
[56:17] to bless them, he goes like
[56:20] this on purpose and well, you'd hate to
[56:24] be some of it's just brutal what some of
[56:26] these kids have to go through and the
[56:28] mind battles they must the complexes
[56:30] they must have had because he went all
[56:31] the way up there, orchestrated
[56:32] everything. I'm the firstborn and
[56:34] everything. And then he goes like
[56:36] this, right? And Genesis 48:12, it says,
[56:39] "Joseph brought them out from between
[56:40] his knees and he bowed himself with his
[56:42] face to the earth. Joseph took them both
[56:45] Ephraim in his right hand toward
[56:46] Israel's left hand. So Joseph or the B
[56:48] said Joseph was a prophet. He said and
[56:50] that prophet took them and tried to
[56:52] place them in where they would be by
[56:54] birth order. But Jacob was also a
[56:57] prophet and Jacob took what Jacob did is
[57:01] Jacob crossed his arm. So it says he
[57:03] took Manass in his left hand toward
[57:05] Israel's right hand and brought them
[57:07] near unto him. And Israel stretched out
[57:09] his right hand and laid it upon
[57:10] Ephraim's head who was the younger. and
[57:13] his left hand upon Manasseh's head,
[57:16] guiding his hands willingly, for
[57:18] Manasseh was the firstborn. And he
[57:21] blessed Joseph and said, "God, before
[57:22] whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did
[57:24] walk, the God which fed me all my
[57:26] lifelong until this day. The angel which
[57:29] redeemed me from all evil, blessed the
[57:31] lands, and let my name be named upon
[57:33] them, and the name of my fathers Abraham
[57:35] and Isaac, let them grow into a
[57:36] multitude in the midst of the earth."
[57:38] And when Joseph saw that his father laid
[57:40] his right hand on the head of Ephraim,
[57:42] it displeased
[57:43] him. I love this. He didn't have the
[57:46] revelation that Jacob did. So he
[57:48] actually tried to move his hands back to
[57:53] uncross the hands. But the re there was
[57:56] a reason for the
[57:57] cross, right? So he tries to uncross his
[58:00] hands. He held up his father's hand to
[58:02] remove it from Ephraim's head to
[58:04] Manass's head. And Joseph said to his
[58:06] father, "Not so, my father. this is the
[58:08] firstborn. He thought the old man was
[58:10] getting scenile and he just forgot. But
[58:12] he did it on purpose. He said, "Not so,
[58:15] my father, for this is the firstborn.
[58:16] Put thy right hand upon his head." And
[58:18] his father refused and said, "I know it,
[58:20] my son. I know it. He also shall become
[58:22] a people. He also shall be great. But
[58:25] truly his younger brother shall be
[58:27] greater than he, and his seed shall
[58:29] become a multitude of nations." And he
[58:31] blessed him that day, saying, "In thee
[58:33] shall Israel bless, saying, God make
[58:35] thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh." and he
[58:37] set Ephraim before Manasseh. So you'll
[58:40] find in the scripture that Ephraim is
[58:41] often most of the time placed first when
[58:44] the when the two tribes are spoken about
[58:47] Ephraim would become the stronger
[58:49] tribe. God crossed Jacob's arms. Brother
[58:53] Brandham picks up on that. If you've
[58:55] listened to the seals, Brother Brandham
[58:56] picks up on that. I don't have the whole
[58:59] quote. You can go back and read it. But
[59:00] in the first seal, he also talks about
[59:02] it in the church age book. He said,
[59:04] "Why? Why did God cross Jacob's arms?
[59:07] Israel, he said, having the rights to be
[59:09] a bride, rejected and sold their
[59:12] birthright and went from the old son,
[59:15] Israel to the new Gentile.
[59:18] So the cross was from Jew to Gentile,
[59:22] right? Ephraim would represent the
[59:23] Gentiles. And the blessings went from
[59:26] there through the cross. Amen. To the
[59:29] Gentile. I I just love the message of
[59:32] the hour. It means I know you all knew
[59:34] knew that. And and mean I've heard that
[59:36] since I was a kid, but it still blesses
[59:38] me that God foreshadowed what would
[59:40] happen all those thousands of years ago.
[59:44] And here he said the blessings went
[59:46] through the cross to the Gentile.
[59:47] Listen, if God could could forecast what
[59:50] would happen when he changed from the
[59:52] Jew to the Gentile all those years
[59:54] before, don't you think he can take care
[59:55] of you? Don't you think he can take care
[59:58] of your problems and the things you're
[59:59] going through right now? He knew before
[1:00:01] you ever went through them. He knew what
[1:00:03] you would be going through.
[1:00:06] So God crossed his arms because the
[1:00:09] blessings went through the cross to the
[1:00:12] Gentile. And in Galatians 3:13, Paul
[1:00:15] says, "Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:00:18] curse of the law, being made a curse for
[1:00:20] us. For it is written, cursed is
[1:00:22] everyone that hangeth on a tree." He
[1:00:24] said that the blessing of Abraham,
[1:00:26] listen, the blessing of Abraham, you
[1:00:28] realize what how we've been blessed as
[1:00:30] Gentiles. That the blessing of Abraham,
[1:00:33] that that was one nation that was given
[1:00:35] a blessing, one man. He said, "Thy seed
[1:00:37] will be a blessing. Wherever they go,
[1:00:39] it'll be blessed." He said, "Everybody
[1:00:41] that loves them, I'll love. Everybody
[1:00:42] that hates them, I'll hate." And God
[1:00:44] took that blessing on Abraham and
[1:00:46] crossed his arms and said, "I'm going to
[1:00:48] place the Abrahamic blessing on the
[1:00:50] royal seed of Abraham." and how by faith
[1:00:52] you can believe that you've been blessed
[1:00:54] too. So when the sons of Jacob were
[1:00:57] blessed, the Gentiles were blessed as
[1:01:00] well.
[1:01:04] The blessing of Abraham might come on
[1:01:05] the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that
[1:01:08] we might receive the promise of the
[1:01:10] spirit through faith. Remember that
[1:01:13] Joseph was the son of prosperity. I'm
[1:01:17] not preaching a prosperity gospel, but I
[1:01:19] do want to kind of hit this home for a
[1:01:21] minute. I don't think we should worry
[1:01:22] about God taking care of us. He's going
[1:01:25] to take care of us, right? We ought to
[1:01:29] work, right? Do our best for our
[1:01:31] families, but I don't think we have to
[1:01:33] move out of the will of God. And and and
[1:01:37] that's a revelation to you. That's not I
[1:01:39] can't tell you what the will of God is.
[1:01:40] But I don't think we have to move out of
[1:01:42] the will of God and say, "Well, I've got
[1:01:43] to do this for my life in order to in
[1:01:46] order to make a living." No, you're a
[1:01:47] son of prosperity. The arm, the blessing
[1:01:50] was crossed to you. And all the
[1:01:52] blessings that were on Abraham were put
[1:01:55] on you. He said, "I've never seen the
[1:01:57] seed of God. I've never seen them
[1:01:59] forsaken. Never seen them begging
[1:02:00] bread." And and those blessings of the
[1:02:02] Old Testament were put on you. Amen.
[1:02:07] So, I don't think we have to go outside
[1:02:08] the will of God to make a living. I
[1:02:10] don't think we have to go outside the
[1:02:11] will of God to have healing. Come on,
[1:02:14] church. We don't have to change what
[1:02:15] Brother Brandham said to have healing in
[1:02:17] our midst. We don't have to change what
[1:02:18] a prophet taught us. We don't have to go
[1:02:20] through, well, let's go back to the
[1:02:21] Pentecostals. Let's do something weird
[1:02:23] or different. No, we just stay right
[1:02:25] here in the land because the blessings
[1:02:27] were given to us through the cross.
[1:02:29] Amen.
[1:02:32] Joseph was a son of prosperity. Genesis
[1:02:36] 49:22, Jacob uh again speaking of
[1:02:39] Joseph, he said, "Joseph is a fruitful
[1:02:41] bow, even a fruitful bow by a well whose
[1:02:44] branches run over the wall. The archers
[1:02:47] have sorely grieved him and shot at him
[1:02:49] and hated him. But his bow abodeed
[1:02:52] strength, and the arms of his hands were
[1:02:53] made strong by the hands of the mighty
[1:02:55] God of Jacob." And this listen church,
[1:02:58] we read this as Joseph, but this is
[1:03:00] speaking of Israel. Yes, natural, but in
[1:03:02] the spiritual type, it's speaking of us,
[1:03:06] right? By the crossing of the hands. And
[1:03:09] so he said, "From this is the shepherd,
[1:03:11] the stone of Israel." He said, "Even by
[1:03:13] the God of thy father who shall help
[1:03:15] thee, by the Almighty, who shall bless
[1:03:17] thee with blessings of heaven above,
[1:03:19] blessings of the deep that lith under,
[1:03:21] blessings of the breast and of the womb.
[1:03:23] The blessings of thy father have
[1:03:24] prevailed above the blessings of my
[1:03:27] progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
[1:03:29] everlasting hills. They shall be on the
[1:03:32] head of Joseph on the crown of the head
[1:03:34] of him that was separate from his
[1:03:36] brethren. Now in the natural sense that
[1:03:38] was fulfilled. Did you know that when
[1:03:41] God blessed
[1:03:43] Joseph through Manasseh and Ephraim
[1:03:46] through his natural children, there
[1:03:49] would be a blessing that would actually
[1:03:52] last into our age. Do you know that? A
[1:03:54] natural blessing that would last into
[1:03:57] our age. And you see it in their land.
[1:03:59] They're blessed there. But they were
[1:04:00] even blessed here
[1:04:02] in the US, right? It's no accident that
[1:04:07] the Jews accumulated wealth.
[1:04:10] in the United States. Brother Brandham
[1:04:13] explains that scripture. He said he told
[1:04:15] Joseph, "Thou art a fruitful vine by the
[1:04:17] by the wall." See, by the well, the
[1:04:19] water. He said he went over said you. So
[1:04:22] they went over the water. Over the wall,
[1:04:25] you trust in the Lord God. You made your
[1:04:26] bow strong. He said, "United
[1:04:31] States." The guy had a good defender,
[1:04:34] good
[1:04:35] protector. Made your bow strong. the
[1:04:37] United States in the Lord. But someday
[1:04:40] that vine was coming back over the wall,
[1:04:44] right? And so, Brother Ram uses that as
[1:04:46] as a prophecy of Israel going back to
[1:04:48] their homeland. He said they come to the
[1:04:50] United States and they prospered, but
[1:04:52] someday that vine's going back over the
[1:04:53] wall. We've seen that and they're
[1:04:56] prospering. I was just reading today.
[1:04:57] every day. You can go read about what
[1:04:58] Israel's doing every day and you find
[1:05:00] that God just blesses them and they
[1:05:02] figured out how to shoot missiles out of
[1:05:04] the sky with lasers where they're not
[1:05:06] even going to have to spend as much
[1:05:08] money to shoot the missiles out of the
[1:05:10] sky because one of the problems they've
[1:05:11] got every time they down a missile it
[1:05:12] cost them
[1:05:13] $100,000. But now they've actually got
[1:05:16] lasers that'll shoot it out of the sky.
[1:05:17] It's a material blessing. But don't you
[1:05:19] realize as blessed as they've been, they
[1:05:21] found oil under them. They they're one
[1:05:23] of the richest countries in the world
[1:05:25] and just a little bitty country out in
[1:05:26] the desert and they they've done
[1:05:29] irrigation. The desert's blossomed as a
[1:05:31] rose and everything else. But can you
[1:05:32] imagine if that's happened to them in
[1:05:34] the natural what God wants to do for us
[1:05:36] spiritually, what he has done for us
[1:05:39] spiritually as the sons of Abraham. He's
[1:05:41] given us the message of the hour. He's
[1:05:43] given us unsearchable riches in the Holy
[1:05:46] Ghost. He's given us our healing, our
[1:05:48] the blessings of our families. Those are
[1:05:50] ours. We might as well take those and
[1:05:52] say boo to the devil tonight and get run
[1:05:54] him off of our property. It belongs to
[1:05:57] us. Yeah, he's going to fight. He's
[1:05:58] still fighting the Israelites. They're
[1:06:00] still fighting over there, but they
[1:06:02] prospered anyhow.
[1:06:10] Hallelujah. He said, there she is right
[1:06:13] there.
[1:06:13] Now Deuteronomy
[1:06:16] 33:13 says of Joseph he said blessed of
[1:06:18] the Lord be his land for the precious
[1:06:21] things of heaven for the dew and for the
[1:06:23] deep that coucheth beneath for the
[1:06:26] precious fruits brought forth by the sun
[1:06:28] for the precious things put forth by the
[1:06:30] moon for the chief things of the ancient
[1:06:32] mountains for the precious things of the
[1:06:34] lasting hills for the precious things of
[1:06:36] the earth and fullness thereof for the
[1:06:38] goodwill of him that dwelleth in the
[1:06:39] bush. Amen. That pillar of fire. Let the
[1:06:43] blessing come upon the head of Joseph
[1:06:44] and upon the top of the head of him that
[1:06:46] was separated from his brethren. His
[1:06:48] glory is like the first of his bulock.
[1:06:50] His horns are like the horns of
[1:06:52] unicorns. With them he shall push the
[1:06:54] people together to the ends of the
[1:06:55] earth. He said they are the 10 thousands
[1:06:57] of Ephraim. They are the thousands of
[1:06:59] Manasseh that would come true literally.
[1:07:01] They'd become their tribes would become
[1:07:03] huge.
[1:07:04] It speaks of a blessing to them in the
[1:07:07] natural and a blessing in the spiritual
[1:07:10] to the Gentiles because Ephesians 1:3
[1:07:12] said, "Blessed be the God and father of
[1:07:14] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[1:07:16] us." See, he told he told Joseph, "This
[1:07:19] is your blessing and this is your
[1:07:20] blessing." But what does he tell us? Who
[1:07:21] has blessed us with? Someone say, say
[1:07:23] it. All All spiritual blessings. So he
[1:07:27] didn't just say you have some of it, but
[1:07:29] you got all of it.
[1:07:30] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:07:32] places in Christ. But that vine is
[1:07:36] coming back over the wall. We know in
[1:07:37] the natural that the the gospel is going
[1:07:40] back to the Jews. Paul says, "I would
[1:07:44] not, brethren, that you should be
[1:07:45] ignorant of this mystery lest you should
[1:07:46] be wise in your own
[1:07:48] conceits." Now, Paul puts his finger on
[1:07:51] something. He said, "You don't want to
[1:07:53] become arrogant. You don't want to
[1:07:55] become prideful. You've been
[1:07:58] blessed." Oh.
[1:08:00] This is where my heart is tonight. And
[1:08:02] you'll see why in in a few minutes, but
[1:08:04] you you've been blessed. Make sure you
[1:08:07] don't get prideful with it and think you
[1:08:09] can do just anything you want to do. And
[1:08:11] and go read Romans chapter 11. He said,
[1:08:13] "If the first if you were grafted in,
[1:08:15] the first vine can be grafted back in."
[1:08:19] Right? He said, "Don't don't be wise in
[1:08:20] your own conceits that blindness in part
[1:08:23] is happened to Israel until the fullness
[1:08:27] of the Gentiles become in
[1:08:30] Now, brother Brandon makes the point in
[1:08:31] the church age book that all seven of
[1:08:33] the churches written to in Revelation
[1:08:35] were gentile churches. There were
[1:08:38] church, Jewish churches, Jewish
[1:08:39] Christian churches then, but he did not
[1:08:42] write to any of them. He didn't write to
[1:08:44] Jerusalem. Didn't write to any of the
[1:08:46] Jews. He wrote only to Gentiles because
[1:08:49] the church ages would be predominantly
[1:08:51] Gentile, right? It would be it would be
[1:08:54] Gentiles and a few Jews who believed but
[1:08:57] it would be predominantly to the
[1:08:58] Gentiles. So, brother Brandon said the
[1:09:00] reason that it was not written to the
[1:09:02] church in Jerusalem is that God had
[1:09:04] turned from the Jews to the Gentiles. He
[1:09:06] said thus the whole of the church ages
[1:09:08] is God dealing with the Gentiles and
[1:09:10] calling out a gentile bride to himself.
[1:09:12] He said that makes the church ages and
[1:09:14] the fullness of the Gentiles want and
[1:09:17] the same thing. So Paul is saying until
[1:09:19] the church ages are
[1:09:21] done. So we must be getting awful close
[1:09:24] because we've seen the messenger to the
[1:09:26] seventh church
[1:09:27] age, right? It's already come and gone.
[1:09:31] So we must be getting awful close to the
[1:09:33] time the fullness of the Gentiles has
[1:09:35] come in and we go home and it turns back
[1:09:38] to the Jews. So So it must be about
[1:09:41] time. Now again, we Gentiles have a
[1:09:44] right to the redemptive blessings of God
[1:09:47] through what? Through the cross.
[1:09:50] That's where our blessings come from.
[1:09:51] That'll never change. Right? Some I know
[1:09:54] people tell you, "Well, if you preach
[1:09:56] the cross, that's too simple. That's
[1:09:57] too, you know, we need to preach
[1:09:58] something else. I Yes, we preach the
[1:10:01] whole mystery of God. I love to get into
[1:10:03] the deep things, but the cross will
[1:10:04] always be there. That's where your
[1:10:07] blessings come from, right? It comes
[1:10:09] from his sacrifice on the
[1:10:11] cross. And let me go a little bit
[1:10:13] further than that. Listen, you got to
[1:10:15] take up your cross, right? We can't die
[1:10:18] for our sins, but if you want to be
[1:10:19] blessed in your life, your blessings
[1:10:21] come through
[1:10:22] self-surrender and sacrifice. Just like
[1:10:25] the woman we talked about last week that
[1:10:26] picked up the two sticks, Rand said she
[1:10:28] took the path of self-surrender and it
[1:10:31] actually caused the Oh my when she did
[1:10:34] that and listened to the voice of
[1:10:36] Elijah, the cruise of oil never failed.
[1:10:38] And the meal never gave out. Amen.
[1:10:41] Because she took the path of
[1:10:44] self-sacrifice. Now again, we've been
[1:10:47] grafted into the tree of blessing as
[1:10:51] Gentiles through the cross. What did the
[1:10:54] cross do? It paid the price for our
[1:10:58] redemption. The cross did not make us
[1:11:01] sons or daughters. It paid the price for
[1:11:05] our redemption as sons. We were always
[1:11:08] sons in the mind of God before the
[1:11:11] foundation of the world. You know, some
[1:11:13] of y'all, I know you're looking at me
[1:11:14] said, "Brother Ben, I already knew that.
[1:11:15] Why don't you move on to something I
[1:11:16] didn't know?" Well, maybe some of our
[1:11:18] young people didn't know that. So, just
[1:11:20] just say amen for them.
[1:11:23] So, the cross, what did the cross do? It
[1:11:25] didn't make you a son, Jason. What did
[1:11:27] the cross do? The cross actually paid
[1:11:29] your way back into sunship.
[1:11:33] Amen. It bought you out of a pawn shop.
[1:11:37] Right? So, you were in a pawn shop. You
[1:11:39] were in the devil's pawn shop. Brother
[1:11:41] said, "It's like a watch in a pawn shop.
[1:11:43] Once you put it in the pawn shop, then
[1:11:45] there's a price that must be paid to get
[1:11:48] it out. It still belonged to God, but he
[1:11:51] had to pay the price because we were
[1:11:53] pawned by the devil into the devil's
[1:11:55] pawn shop. So we had to pay the price so
[1:11:58] that we would get so that we could come
[1:12:00] out of the pawn shop and be put back
[1:12:02] into use that he had us to be used for
[1:12:05] to be put back into sunship. Listen, but
[1:12:07] the B said the devil put us in the pawn
[1:12:09] shop back there from Adam's sin. But
[1:12:12] Jesus came down, paid the pawn bill.
[1:12:17] Hallelujah. Some of y'all don't know
[1:12:18] what I'm talking about because you ain't
[1:12:19] ever pawned anything. I have. Not
[1:12:22] recently, but I have. I've had to pawn
[1:12:25] stuff to get
[1:12:28] groceries. You say, "Brother Ben, you
[1:12:30] should never admit that from the
[1:12:31] pulpit." Hey, I've been through that. I
[1:12:33] know what it's like. Gives me a little
[1:12:34] bit of empathy for some of our young
[1:12:35] families that struggle. I know what
[1:12:38] that's like. I know what it's like to
[1:12:39] not have enough money to to buy
[1:12:41] groceries. I know what it's like to
[1:12:42] leave groceries because your credit card
[1:12:44] fails. You know, payment doesn't work.
[1:12:45] And I know what that's like. Again, not
[1:12:48] recently, but I know what it's like. But
[1:12:50] but again, what what is it? Jesus paid
[1:12:52] that. I had a debt I couldn't pay. I
[1:12:56] could never. When I tried to obtain the
[1:12:58] blessings of God, when I went to the
[1:12:59] blessing tree, there was nothing there
[1:13:01] for me because I had not come. But when
[1:13:04] the cross came, when he died on the
[1:13:06] cross for my sins, and I by faith, I
[1:13:08] realized that I recognized that what
[1:13:09] happened, it brought me back. It grafted
[1:13:11] me back in to the tree of blessings,
[1:13:14] spiritual blessings, so that I could
[1:13:17] enter the land of the Holy Ghost where
[1:13:19] all the promises lay. So now the pawn
[1:13:21] bill, he said he paid the pawn bill,
[1:13:23] wrote it on the word. Hallelujah. So he
[1:13:26] paid the pawn bill and he wrote it right
[1:13:27] here. What does it say? Redeemed,
[1:13:30] bought, paid for. The price has been
[1:13:32] paid. He wrote the pawn receipt. This is
[1:13:35] the receipt of your salvation. This is
[1:13:37] the receipt of the atonement, which
[1:13:39] includes your healing as well.
[1:13:42] This is not a promise.
[1:13:46] It's a receipt.
[1:13:49] Come on, church. It's a promise of
[1:13:50] heaven, but it's a receipt
[1:13:54] when it comes to the cross.
[1:13:57] It's not a promise that one day your
[1:13:59] sins will be forgiven. It's a receipt
[1:14:01] that they've already been forgiven.
[1:14:04] If you can recognize
[1:14:06] it. Now, Brother Brandham uses his own
[1:14:08] health issues as an example because he
[1:14:11] was a prophet that was a man, right? Had
[1:14:13] health issues. He talked about how uh he
[1:14:16] was redeemed from the pawn shop. He
[1:14:18] said, "Male brothers told me you can't
[1:14:20] get well." And I said, "I got a right
[1:14:21] to." He said, 'Well, you inherited from
[1:14:23] your father.' I said, 'But my heavenly
[1:14:25] father redeemed
[1:14:27] me.' There's a strong one right there.
[1:14:29] He said, "Well, I'm the way I am because
[1:14:31] of my father. I inherited cancer from my
[1:14:33] father. I inherited I inherited whatever
[1:14:35] it is. Bad breath from my father." No
[1:14:37] matter what it is, it I got that from my
[1:14:39] father. But listen, if you got it from
[1:14:41] your father, what'd you get from your
[1:14:43] heavenly father? If your natural father
[1:14:45] could pass things on to you, how much
[1:14:47] more could your heavenly father pass
[1:14:49] things on to you? He said, "You
[1:14:51] inherited it from your father, but my
[1:14:53] heavenly father redeemed me." Amen. He
[1:14:55] said, "I'm out of the pawn shop now." He
[1:14:57] said, "So just move over, Satan." He
[1:15:00] said, "Satan kept coming back." And I
[1:15:02] don't have time. I I had to cut out the
[1:15:03] rest of that quote and I hated it. But
[1:15:05] he said, "Satan kept coming back." He
[1:15:06] said, "Pretty soon, I heard old Sufoot
[1:15:08] slipping down the alley."
[1:15:11] He said, "I heard the sound of him
[1:15:13] slipping down the alley. Why was it?" He
[1:15:15] said, "Because I kept standing on on the
[1:15:17] fact I'd been redeemed. He put me in a
[1:15:19] pawn shop, but I could not stay there.
[1:15:21] Healing was mine."
[1:15:24] Hallelujah. Sometimes blessing itself
[1:15:27] can become a curse to us,
[1:15:29] though. Do you know that we are so
[1:15:33] blessed?
[1:15:35] But if we don't thank God for it,
[1:15:41] You realize why praise is so important
[1:15:43] in the house of God. I know people don't
[1:15:44] believe in it. Some people don't believe
[1:15:46] in it, but I trust that we all do.
[1:15:49] Praise is important. I not everybody
[1:15:51] runs the aisles and jumps and we don't
[1:15:52] even, you know, if everybody was the
[1:15:55] same again, it wouldn't be very
[1:15:57] interesting, right? But but praise is
[1:16:00] important. Worship is important
[1:16:04] because and you're going to see in a
[1:16:06] minute, the lack of worship caused the
[1:16:09] lack of of returning thanks of being
[1:16:12] thankful and and the fact that they were
[1:16:14] arrogant and just took it for granted
[1:16:16] caused Ephraim to
[1:16:19] fall. See, Ephraim was blessed. We know
[1:16:21] we read the scripture, they were
[1:16:23] blessed, but they were headstrong and
[1:16:25] arrogant. And I'm and I'm you can go
[1:16:27] back and study Ephraim in the scripture
[1:16:29] and find this. The historical record
[1:16:32] even shows that there was a wealthy,
[1:16:34] prosperous, blessed northern kingdom of
[1:16:38] Israel once the kingdoms were divided
[1:16:40] and a poor backwards people in the
[1:16:43] southern kingdom of
[1:16:45] Judah. So the but that's where the
[1:16:47] spiritual blessings were. Jerusalem was
[1:16:50] in the southern kingdom. The temple was
[1:16:52] in the southern kingdom. But the
[1:16:54] northern kingdom which split off with
[1:16:56] Jeroboam away from Solomon was actually
[1:17:00] from Solomon's son Riaboam. It was
[1:17:03] actually those 10 tribes who who broke
[1:17:05] off were much more prosperous even after
[1:17:08] they
[1:17:10] left than the southern tribes
[1:17:13] were. And I want to preach this. We
[1:17:16] talked about the blessings and we we
[1:17:18] have been blessed with the message of
[1:17:19] the hour, but we don't want to get
[1:17:22] arrogant
[1:17:24] or
[1:17:25] prideful. Now look first kings chapter
[1:17:28] 14 and verse
[1:17:30] 16. Now whenever you see
[1:17:33] Israel, Israel was the 10 tribes once
[1:17:37] the once the kingdoms were divided.
[1:17:39] Israel's the 10 northern tribes. Judah
[1:17:41] was the uh was the two southern tribes.
[1:17:45] The 10 northern tribes were were
[1:17:47] basically swallowed up by Ephraim. So in
[1:17:50] the scripture when it talks about
[1:17:51] Ephraim, many times it's talking about
[1:17:53] Israel, the kingdom of Israel was called
[1:17:56] Ephraim because they kind of swallowed
[1:17:58] up the whole northern kingdom. Look at
[1:18:02] First Kings 14:16. He shall give Israel
[1:18:05] up because of the sins of Jeroboam who
[1:18:09] did sin and made Israel to sin. Now
[1:18:13] look, the exact phrase made Israel to
[1:18:15] sin is repeated eight more times in the
[1:18:18] scripture. Anytime you see a king going
[1:18:20] bad, it says something like this that
[1:18:23] that he made Israel. That exact phrase,
[1:18:26] he made Israel to sin. He followed the
[1:18:28] sins of Jeroboam who made Israel to sin.
[1:18:32] Right? You've read that in the Kings and
[1:18:33] Chronicles. He made Israel to sin.
[1:18:36] Second Kings 17:21, for he rent Israel
[1:18:39] from the house of David, and they made
[1:18:41] Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Jeroboam
[1:18:44] drave Israel from following the Lord.
[1:18:48] Made them sin. A great sin. How did he
[1:18:51] do that? By making them serve
[1:18:53] idols. You remember remember that
[1:18:56] Ephraim is one of the two tribes that's
[1:18:59] taken out. Dan and Ephraim of the
[1:19:03] 144,000. They will not be represented.
[1:19:06] though they're the largest tribe and a
[1:19:08] son of Joseph, but they will not be
[1:19:10] represented in the in the uh 144,000
[1:19:14] that are saved during the tribulation
[1:19:17] period.
[1:19:19] Why? They were blotted out under the
[1:19:21] heavens. We've already taught on that,
[1:19:22] but they were blotted out from under the
[1:19:24] heavens because they've served idols.
[1:19:26] Look at Hosea 4:17. Ephraim is joined to
[1:19:29] idols. Let him alone. Hosea 4:17.
[1:19:34] I'm way ahead of you there, bud. Ephraim
[1:19:37] is joined to idols. Let him alone. And
[1:19:39] Hezekiah's revival in 2 Chronicles 30
[1:19:42] and1. You'll find that there was a great
[1:19:44] revival under the king Hezekiah was the
[1:19:46] king of Judah. And look at the attitude
[1:19:49] of of Ephraim. And I'm going to just
[1:19:50] show this to you and then we'll go home
[1:19:51] because I know I'm getting a little bit
[1:19:53] long already. And I can see your faces
[1:19:55] are growing
[1:19:57] anxious and you're all thinking,
[1:19:58] "Brother Joel didn't hold us this long
[1:20:00] Wednesday." So, or Sunday. So you just
[1:20:04] bear with me. Wow. You just bear with me
[1:20:06] for just a minute. I mean, you got to
[1:20:08] amen the truth,
[1:20:10] right? So Hezekiah sent to all Israel
[1:20:13] and Judah and wrote letters also to
[1:20:15] Ephraim and Manasseh. Notice the way
[1:20:17] it's it's written. Hezekiah sent to
[1:20:20] Israel and Judah and then wrote letters
[1:20:22] to Ephraim and Manasseh specifically
[1:20:25] that they should come to the house of
[1:20:26] the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the
[1:20:28] Passover unto the Lord God of Israel.
[1:20:30] What's he trying to do to reverse that?
[1:20:33] Because their hearts are drifted away.
[1:20:35] Why? Because Jeroboam put an idol, made
[1:20:38] a a golden calf in Dan and Ephraim. And
[1:20:43] Hezekiah, who's under this spirit of
[1:20:45] revival, he writes to him and said,
[1:20:46] "Come back.
[1:20:49] You're back. You've gotten away from the
[1:20:51] message of the hour. You don't worship
[1:20:53] in the temple no more." But God called
[1:20:55] us. But he said, "I'm asking you to come
[1:20:56] back." Yes.
[1:21:00] He said, "I want you to come
[1:21:02] back, keep the Passover." Because the
[1:21:05] Bible said they hadn't kept it in that
[1:21:06] manner for many, many years. In 2
[1:21:09] Chronicles 30:6 says, "So the post went
[1:21:12] with the letters from the king and his
[1:21:13] princes throughout all Israel and Judah,
[1:21:15] and according to the commandment of the
[1:21:16] king, saying, "You children of Israel,
[1:21:18] turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham,
[1:21:20] Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to
[1:21:22] the remnant of you that have escaped out
[1:21:24] of the hands of the king of Assyria." So
[1:21:26] the king of Assyria has already come in
[1:21:28] and the judgments of God has begun on
[1:21:30] that northern kingdom. They actually
[1:21:32] were destroyed several hundred years
[1:21:35] before the southern kingdom of Judah.
[1:21:37] Though they were much more prosperous,
[1:21:39] had many more people, many more tribes,
[1:21:42] but they were destroyed.
[1:21:44] And he said, "You've already been mostly
[1:21:46] destroyed." He said, "Those of you that
[1:21:48] escaped, he'll have mercy on the remnant
[1:21:50] remnant if you'll
[1:21:52] turn." He said, "Be not like your
[1:21:54] father. It's like your brethren which
[1:21:56] trespassed against the Lord God of their
[1:21:58] fathers who therefore gave them up to
[1:21:59] desolation as you see saying you see
[1:22:02] it's not working. I I needed more time
[1:22:04] to preach this. I can tell you I'm not
[1:22:06] going to take it but just look it's not
[1:22:09] working. What you're doing is not
[1:22:12] working. What you're doing is not
[1:22:14] working. He said come back. He said it
[1:22:16] didn't work for your fathers. It's not
[1:22:17] going to work for you.
[1:22:19] He said, ' Now you be not stiff necked
[1:22:21] as your fathers were, but yield
[1:22:23] yourselves unto the Lord. Enter into his
[1:22:25] sanctuary, which he has sanctified
[1:22:26] forever, and serve the Lord your God,
[1:22:28] that the fierceness of his wrath may
[1:22:29] turn away from you. For if you turn
[1:22:31] again unto the Lord, your brethren and
[1:22:33] your
[1:22:34] children, oh my. So watch it. Now, I
[1:22:38] want us to come down and just kind of
[1:22:39] think about this in our own lives. Lord,
[1:22:41] I don't want to be hard-headed.
[1:22:43] I don't want to be arrogant because I've
[1:22:45] been blessed
[1:22:47] and I have been blessed. I've been
[1:22:50] blessed financially. I've been blessed
[1:22:51] with children, wonderful, godly
[1:22:52] children, a godly wife. I've been
[1:22:54] blessed in many ways. But I don't want
[1:22:56] to get prideful and think that I don't
[1:22:58] need an altar anymore and I don't need
[1:23:00] the presence of God anymore. And I don't
[1:23:02] need the water of the spirit anymore.
[1:23:04] And I don't need the church anymore. I
[1:23:06] don't want to get prideful. Come on,
[1:23:07] church.
[1:23:11] Sometimes with material blessings comes
[1:23:14] an
[1:23:15] arrogance. Now look, I'm not preaching
[1:23:18] against money. I wish y'all had more of
[1:23:20] it because the better y'all do, the
[1:23:22] better the pastor does, the better the
[1:23:24] church does. I I'm not against that. But
[1:23:26] I wish we could turn back to the Lord.
[1:23:29] I'm not saying you're you've drifted
[1:23:30] away, but if you have, turn back to the
[1:23:33] Lord. Don't let Leotaa blind you.
[1:23:39] Look at this. This just broke my heart
[1:23:40] when I read it. He said, "Your children
[1:23:43] will find compassion. So they shall come
[1:23:46] again into the land. For the Lord your
[1:23:47] God is gracious and merciful. Will not
[1:23:49] turn away his face from you if you
[1:23:51] return to him."
[1:23:54] So the post, the letters passed from
[1:23:55] city to city, through the country of
[1:23:57] Ephraim and Manasseh, even to
[1:23:59] Zebulun. Can you read that next part?
[1:24:03] But they laughed them to
[1:24:05] scorn and mocked
[1:24:07] them. They were under judgment. And they
[1:24:11] said, "We ain't going back to that
[1:24:12] backwoods, back country,
[1:24:15] bunch of cult people down there in
[1:24:20] Jerusalem, mocked
[1:24:22] them." Nevertheless, I love this
[1:24:24] scripture. Divers are several of Asher
[1:24:28] and Manasseh and Zebulun just
[1:24:32] individuals from Asher and Manasseh and
[1:24:36] Zebulun humbled
[1:24:38] themselves and came to Jerusalem. Not
[1:24:43] Ephraim. Ephraim was the biggest and the
[1:24:45] baddest and the
[1:24:46] wealthiest. And in a very short time,
[1:24:49] Ephraim was completely wiped off the
[1:24:51] map. Only the Mormons claim to be
[1:24:53] Ephraites today.
[1:24:56] And they have zero proof for
[1:25:00] it. Actually wouldn't want that to be,
[1:25:03] but I
[1:25:04] was. Ephraim was completely wiped off
[1:25:07] the map. Isaiah 7:7, "Thus sayith the
[1:25:10] Lord God, it shall not stand, neither
[1:25:12] shall it come to pass, for the head of
[1:25:13] Syria is Damascus, the head of Damascus
[1:25:15] is res within three score and five years
[1:25:17] shall e Ephraim be broken that it be not
[1:25:20] a people." He said within 65 years
[1:25:22] because Israel, Ephraim had actually
[1:25:24] joined with the Syrians to overtake
[1:25:27] Jerusalem and it didn't stand. The
[1:25:30] prophet Hosea prophesied against Ephraim
[1:25:32] as well. And listen to this. I don't
[1:25:35] have time to read all of this, but he
[1:25:36] said in in in verse one, Hosea 11:1,
[1:25:39] when Israel was a child, then I loved
[1:25:41] him, called my son out of
[1:25:44] Egypt. And verse three says, I taught
[1:25:46] Ephraim also to go. This is very
[1:25:48] touching. It's the imagery of he said,
[1:25:50] "I was like a father to Ephraim. I I
[1:25:52] taught him to walk. I taught Ephraim
[1:25:54] also to go take them by their arms." You
[1:25:57] remember when he taught you to walk? You
[1:25:59] remember what it was like when you first
[1:26:01] got saved and he taught you how to walk
[1:26:02] by the word and he taught you how to do
[1:26:04] things that were right and and you
[1:26:06] learned you love the message and you
[1:26:07] love the things of God. Do you remember
[1:26:09] what it was like
[1:26:11] to be taught how to walk?
[1:26:15] He said, "I taught him how to walk,
[1:26:17] taking them by their arms.
[1:26:20] But they knew not that I healed them.
[1:26:24] I drew them with cords of a man, with
[1:26:26] bands of love, and I was to them as they
[1:26:29] that take off the yolk on their jaws. I
[1:26:32] laid meat unto them." G, he gave them
[1:26:34] rest. He gave them food.
[1:26:38] He said, "He shall not return into the
[1:26:40] land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be
[1:26:41] his king because they refused to
[1:26:45] return." They mocked the letter of
[1:26:48] Hezekiah. Sword shall abide on his
[1:26:50] cities, shall consume his branches,
[1:26:51] devour them because of their own
[1:26:53] counselss. He said, "And my people are
[1:26:55] bit to backsliding from me." Though they
[1:26:58] called them to the most high. So in
[1:27:00] other words, when they got in trouble,
[1:27:01] they called out to God, but none at all
[1:27:05] would exalt him.
[1:27:07] They called out to God, but they
[1:27:09] wouldn't worship. When they got in
[1:27:11] trouble, they came to church.
[1:27:14] But when they were blessed, they left
[1:27:15] the house of God and they made their own
[1:27:17] idols and serve their own gods. I say,
[1:27:19] "God, help me never to be like that. I
[1:27:21] want to be one who finds my place in the
[1:27:23] house of God. And if I'm blessed, let me
[1:27:25] stay in the place where the blessing
[1:27:26] falls. And if I'm not, let me worship
[1:27:28] God for my blessing. And if I don't feel
[1:27:30] blessed, let me worship God for who he
[1:27:32] is because he's still worthy of being
[1:27:35] worshiped.
[1:27:37] Ephraim was known as Mount Ephraim. They
[1:27:39] their land come from a mountain and it
[1:27:41] was it was very proud. Pride is such a
[1:27:44] dangerous thing.
[1:27:46] Brandon talks about ministers that would
[1:27:48] get so pride they start prideful they'd
[1:27:49] start drinking
[1:27:51] and thinking that their churches would
[1:27:53] just let
[1:27:54] them. And he said sometimes then we get
[1:27:56] to a place we think God blesses us. He
[1:27:58] give me a Cadillac. Give me a better
[1:28:00] job. He gives me this. It's no sign you
[1:28:02] can't turn his blessings from you. when
[1:28:05] you get lifted up and feel, well, I once
[1:28:07] laid all night and prayed. I once did
[1:28:09] this and I do that, but I didn't do it
[1:28:11] anymore. He said, you're on dangerous
[1:28:13] ground.
[1:28:14] But God has a way of humbling his
[1:28:16] people. I want to leave you with a
[1:28:17] positive note. Ephraim was still God's
[1:28:19] firstborn. Even though the hands had
[1:28:22] been crossed, even though he was the
[1:28:24] first one to be destroyed, even though
[1:28:25] he was arrogant, he still belonged to
[1:28:28] Jacob. Still belonged to Joseph.
[1:28:32] Amen. Look what Jeremiah says about him
[1:28:34] in Jeremiah
[1:28:36] 31:20. Is he from my dear son? Is he a
[1:28:38] pleasant child? For since I spake
[1:28:41] against him, I do earnestly remember him
[1:28:43] still. God still he still loves you. You
[1:28:46] You might be You might be on the outs
[1:28:48] right now. He It may feel like you're
[1:28:50] just under judgment, but God loves you.
[1:28:54] He's waiting for you to
[1:28:56] move. He said, "Since I spake against
[1:28:59] him, I do earnestly remember him still.
[1:29:00] Therefore, my bowels, my my inner being
[1:29:02] is troubled for him, I will surely have
[1:29:04] mercy upon him, sayeth the Lord. In 2
[1:29:08] Chronicles 7:14, he said, "If my people
[1:29:11] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:29:15] themselves, humble themselves how
[1:29:17] through the cross like Manasseh did when
[1:29:20] they come back." And they got the
[1:29:21] letter, they said, "Let's go down to
[1:29:23] Jerusalem." A few of them did. Let's go
[1:29:25] down to Jerusalem. Let's say we were
[1:29:27] wrong. Let's go down to the altar. Let's
[1:29:29] talk to God again. Let's have them all
[1:29:31] night prayer meetings again. Let's get
[1:29:33] down to business with God again. Oh
[1:29:35] church, if we can only recognize many
[1:29:37] times we drift away and we don't even
[1:29:38] recognize it and you hear the voice of
[1:29:40] God in in the spirit of revival speaking
[1:29:43] out, won't you come back? Won't you come
[1:29:45] back? You you're living in Leodysia, but
[1:29:47] there's a place where you can stay under
[1:29:49] the blessings of God. That place is not
[1:29:51] these four walls, but that place is in
[1:29:54] Christ.
[1:29:56] Amen.
[1:29:57] My people which are called by my name
[1:29:59] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:30:02] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:30:03] ways and will I hear from heaven will
[1:30:06] forgive their sin will
[1:30:09] heal their
[1:30:14] land. I can't believe we move that fast
[1:30:17] through that. But I hope you got the the
[1:30:19] highlights of it. Maybe we'll visit it
[1:30:21] some other time. Lord, let me be like
[1:30:24] Manasseh.
[1:30:26] those
[1:30:30] individuals, the church as a whole is
[1:30:32] not coming back to God.
[1:30:34] They got a
[1:30:36] letter. They got a message and they
[1:30:38] laughed to scorn,
[1:30:42] not realizing they were already under
[1:30:44] judgment. You realize where we're
[1:30:46] living, we're living right in that time.
[1:30:48] They were already under judgment. You
[1:30:50] yet they left the letter to scorn. Not
[1:30:53] us.
[1:30:54] I believe you're those individuals
[1:30:57] that come back and said, "I want to be
[1:30:59] right. I'm not just going to carelessly
[1:31:02] defy the words of a prophet. I'm not
[1:31:06] going to carelessly take the Bible. I
[1:31:08] know what the Bible says, but I'm just
[1:31:09] going to leave it there because I want
[1:31:10] to live a different way." I'm not going
[1:31:12] to do that. Something in my heart won't
[1:31:14] let me do that. Though I may be
[1:31:17] influenced in a wrong way, though I may
[1:31:18] be using myself as an example, but any
[1:31:20] of us, though we might we live in Leo to
[1:31:23] see, we might get cold from time to
[1:31:24] time, but we got a place we can go to.
[1:31:26] We don't worship idols, we have a living
[1:31:29] God.
[1:31:31] Can you hear the voice of God calling
[1:31:32] you back to that place?
[1:31:35] How do you get back? Humble yourself and
[1:31:37] pray. Say, God, let me come to that
[1:31:41] place. Let me come every morning, every
[1:31:42] night. Let me let it not be a weekly
[1:31:44] thing, but a daily thing. every hour to
[1:31:47] to that be my zeal to repent before God.
[1:31:53] I know the blessings are
[1:31:55] mine. I know they are. I I know I've
[1:31:58] been blessed with all spiritual
[1:31:59] blessings, but Lord, I don't want to get
[1:32:02] arrogant with
[1:32:03] it. I know this message is a blessing to
[1:32:06] me, but I see so many just become
[1:32:08] arrogant with it until pretty soon it's
[1:32:10] just a message in name only. That's what
[1:32:12] Ephraim was. They were Israel in name
[1:32:14] only, but they served other gods. God,
[1:32:17] help us not to be that way. I believe
[1:32:19] that we're not. Believe that's why
[1:32:20] you're here tonight on a Wednesday
[1:32:21] night. Would you bow your heads with
[1:32:23] me? Musicians, if you would
[1:32:27] come, my people who are called by my
[1:32:30] name shall humble themselves. I don't
[1:32:32] think we should ever get too big. So big
[1:32:35] that we wouldn't say, "Lord, search me.
[1:32:38] Try me. Search me. Oh God, know my
[1:32:41] heart." I know it's a Wednesday night,
[1:32:43] but maybe we could just make this our
[1:32:45] devotion tonight. And I know many of you
[1:32:48] do devotions before you go to bed and
[1:32:50] you search your heart. Hey, Lord,
[1:32:51] forgive me if I've done anything that's
[1:32:54] wrong. Maybe this would be our devotion
[1:32:56] time just for the next
[1:32:58] moment. Lord, if I've drifted and I've
[1:33:02] just casually
[1:33:04] disregarded the things of
[1:33:09] God, help me, Lord.
[1:33:12] I want to come
[1:33:14] close. I I want to live for you. I I
[1:33:17] want to do the right thing. Help me,
[1:33:19] Lord, to humble
[1:33:21] myself in prosperity. I believe as a
[1:33:24] church, we've been prosperous in many
[1:33:26] ways.
[1:33:27] We God has blessed us, but we don't want
[1:33:31] to become arrogant.
[1:33:34] We feel like, well, this is the way we
[1:33:35] have to do it and and and God's on our
[1:33:38] side and he's not with anybody else.
[1:33:41] Say, God, help us not to be that
[1:33:45] way.
[1:33:47] Lord, may we humble ourselves and
[1:33:54] pray. God, help us
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] today. He said, I'll hear you.
[1:34:02] Let that blessing be my blessing. Those
[1:34:04] arms were crossed for me. Those hands
[1:34:08] were nailed to the cross for me. Let
[1:34:11] that be my blessing. Let me never
[1:34:12] forget, Lord, whether I'm up or down or
[1:34:16] in or out. Let me never forget your
[1:34:17] word. Let me never casually disregard
[1:34:20] the things of God. But let me live for
[1:34:23] you with all of my heart. It's my desire
[1:34:26] tonight, heavenly father.
[1:34:29] Lord Jesus, as I've been moved, I was
[1:34:31] moved when I last week when I looked at
[1:34:33] these things and and then I put it away
[1:34:36] for days and I come back to it, Lord,
[1:34:38] and I feel that same movement, Lord, in
[1:34:40] my spirit, Lord. I I feel like that
[1:34:43] you're here with us tonight. And Lord, I
[1:34:46] know that you love us, Lord. We're your
[1:34:49] children. We don't want to ever get to a
[1:34:52] place where we the arms were crossed for
[1:34:55] us. Lord, we thank you for that. But
[1:34:57] help us, Lord, not to get to a place
[1:34:59] where we we don't even realize you're
[1:35:01] the one who healed
[1:35:02] us. Lord, you helped us learn to
[1:35:05] walk. May we not get so arrogant that we
[1:35:08] think we couldn't still use help from
[1:35:10] time to
[1:35:11] time. I pray you'd grant it,
[1:35:14] Lord. Help us not to be critical of
[1:35:16] others. Lord, even of our brothers and
[1:35:19] sisters in the church that they may do
[1:35:21] things we don't understand, Lord. And I
[1:35:23] may do things that people don't
[1:35:24] understand. But Lord, help us not to be
[1:35:26] critical of others. May we may we search
[1:35:29] out our own salvation with fear and
[1:35:31] trembling. And Lord, stay before the
[1:35:34] message of the hour. Lord, wash us by
[1:35:35] the water of your word. I pray you grant
[1:35:38] it, Lord. Lord, we ask that the
[1:35:41] blessings of God would be on every
[1:35:42] family. I pray they'd be on every home,
[1:35:45] Lord. those that maybe some that
[1:35:47] struggle financially, may you help them
[1:35:48] in that, Lord. I I believe that you can.
[1:35:51] Lord, when you bless them, when you
[1:35:53] bring them out of that place, oh God,
[1:35:54] may they not forget to put you first,
[1:35:57] Lord. I'm not talking about money, but
[1:35:58] in in their heart, I pray you'd grant
[1:36:01] it, Lord. Lord, when you when you come
[1:36:04] and heal us, may we not forget what you
[1:36:06] did for us, Lord. May we not forget to
[1:36:10] Lord, we couldn't heal ourselves. We
[1:36:11] couldn't save ourselves, but we can come
[1:36:13] to church. we can get down on our knees
[1:36:15] at home. We can raise our hands up,
[1:36:17] Lord, and we can thank you for the
[1:36:20] things that you've done for us. I pray
[1:36:22] that you'd move and that you'd work
[1:36:23] among us, Lord, among these young people
[1:36:25] and old alike. Lord, help us to be a
[1:36:27] good example, Lord. Help us to be one
[1:36:30] who always comes back to the temple when
[1:36:33] we get the ladder. Lord, may we humble
[1:36:37] ourselves. Come down off of our
[1:36:39] mountains of pride. come down to the
[1:36:42] place where you called us to. I pray
[1:36:44] you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you for
[1:36:46] it in Jesus
[1:36:49] name.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need
[1:36:53] prayer tonight, the altar's open. We
[1:36:54] won't hold you long. God bless you
[1:36:57] tonight. Worship you.
[1:37:01] Hallelujah. Why don't we just worship
[1:37:04] him tonight? Pay back to him.
[1:37:07] Hallelujah.
[1:37:08] Oh Lord, we thank you. We love you. We
[1:37:11] don't want to forget where our blessings
[1:37:12] come from, Lord. Oh, we love you
[1:37:15] tonight.
[1:37:16] Oh Lord, we come to you. Oh, thank you,
[1:37:22] Lord. Let's just stand together and
[1:37:24] worship him now. No matter what the
[1:37:32] serend no matter
[1:37:35] what the
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:39] situation. Oh yes Lord we will live a
[1:37:45] holy
[1:37:49] hand. Oh thank you Lord.

[1:37:56] Jesus. L
[1:37:59] him. Oh how we
[1:38:02] long to
[1:38:04] worship you. There's something in your
[1:38:07] heart that cries out to worship him
[1:38:10] long. Oh we thank thank you for our
[1:38:12] blessings through the cross. Elohim.
[1:38:16] Oh, how we
[1:38:18] long to
[1:38:20] worship
[1:38:24] you.
[1:38:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh,
[1:38:29] we love you, Lord Jesus. Can we just
[1:38:32] raise our hands? Just thank him. Oh, we
[1:38:35] love you, Lord
[1:38:36] Jesus. Thank you for being our provider,
[1:38:39] for being Jehovah
[1:38:41] Gyra. Hallelujah. on this Wednesday
[1:38:43] night. Lord, we want you to know how
[1:38:45] much we love you,
[1:38:47] Lord. Lord, I don't want to leave this
[1:38:49] place without you knowing. I know you've
[1:38:51] forgiven me so many times. You've loved
[1:38:53] me so many times. You You blessed me so
[1:38:56] many times, Lord. And I thank you for
[1:38:58] it. I thank you, Lord Jesus.

[1:39:05] just reach up to him and receive your
[1:39:06] healing tonight. Whatever you have need

[1:42:41] tonight? Amen. Why didn't we
[1:42:48] recognize son of
[1:42:50] God was here today?
[1:42:56] Oh, didn't our
[1:43:00] hearts
[1:43:02] burn as talked along the
[1:43:10] way? Shouldn't we have
[1:43:16] known? Oh, shouldn't we have
[1:43:22] known? I wish that we had known
[1:43:26] him before the Lord had
[1:43:30] come and
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:35] gone.
[1:43:37] Oh, the day
[1:43:39] before
[1:43:41] yesterday
[1:43:43] they
[1:43:45] crucified my Lord.
[1:43:50] beat
[1:43:51] him
[1:43:55] unmercifully and nailed him to a
[1:44:00] tree. The sky grew dark and the earth
[1:44:06] began to fall.
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:14] The people cried,
[1:44:20] "Surely we've
[1:44:23] crucified the son of
[1:44:29] God." Oh, why didn't we
[1:44:34] recognize the son of
[1:44:37] God was here today?
[1:44:42] And didn't our
[1:44:46] hearts
[1:44:48] burn as he talked along the
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:55] way. Oh, shouldn't we have
[1:45:02] known? Shouldn't we have known
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:07] him? I wish that we had known
[1:45:12] him before the Lord had come and
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:22] gone. Today a friend and
[1:45:27] I walk down the
[1:45:34] road. We didn't know our
[1:45:38] Lord had
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:44] arose. But then a man drew near and he
[1:45:49] spoke words so wise.
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:59] He broke the bread and blessed
[1:46:04] it. Vanished and open. Aren't you glad
[1:46:09] your eyes have been open? Let's sing the
[1:46:11] bride's part now. Well, I'm so glad I
[1:46:17] recognized the mighty
[1:46:20] God is here today.
[1:46:26] And doesn't our
[1:46:29] hearts
[1:46:31] burn as we talk along the
[1:46:38] way? Oh, I'm so glad I know him. Do you
