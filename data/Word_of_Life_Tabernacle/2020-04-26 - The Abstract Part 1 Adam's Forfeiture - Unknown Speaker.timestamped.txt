[45:27] this service this morning as I felt you
[45:30] already here today we can honestly say
[45:34] with our brother who sang it as well
[45:36] with our soul no matter what happens on
[45:41] the outside it doesn't matter what the
[45:44] economy does or what sicknesses might
[45:48] come on the earth what diseases may come
[45:51] or things may come and go we may be up
[45:53] or down but you're still alive and it is
[45:58] well with our soul the fact that you
[46:01] chose us and called us into this age and
[46:05] presented us with a message that somehow
[46:08] we had the faith to accept it Lord and
[46:10] was that of our own doing but it was all
[46:12] you Lord and the fact that that happened
[46:15] is just Lord it just gives us an
[46:18] assurance that we know it is well it
[46:20] doesn't matter what happens so well with
[46:22] our soul father I pray that your spirit
[46:26] would go from this place and also into

[46:32] Lord Jesus we know that you're wherever
[46:35] they are father because they brought you
[46:37] with them and I pray God that you'd move
[46:39] in every home I pray that your spirit

[46:44] Moses said if your spirit doesn't go
[46:46] with us we don't want to go
[46:48] are you granted today Lord father may
[46:51] you speak directly to our souls today
[46:53] may we hear Lord and be changed in Jesus
[46:58] name Amen amen thank the Lord for his
[47:03] presence this morning we're gonna read
[47:06] from revelations chapter five and verse
[47:08] one rule read verses one through four
[47:12] so such a privilege to be here today and
[47:16] I just feel the presence of the Lord I
[47:19] sometimes before these services and I
[47:21] feel very at peace today and we're
[47:23] getting more used to doing the things
[47:24] that we do but before these streaming
[47:27] services you get real nervous because
[47:28] we're trying to get the streaming right
[47:31] and do everything and you know we're
[47:33] setting all this up as we've been doing
[47:35] this and I want to thank you for for
[47:37] helping us and also being patient with
[47:38] us but something I did this morning but
[47:41] the Danny I can't laugh at you anymore
[47:42] because I didn't go live but I put an
[47:45] angry face on our video and an angry
[47:48] emoji on our video so those of you are
[47:50] watching that was me and I don't know
[47:53] how to take it off so so you just
[47:56] forgive me for that and we'll move on
[47:59] but I wasn't mad at anybody I just my
[48:01] thumb hit it and I messed up on that
[48:04] while I was trying to set it up so you
[48:06] all forgive me for that we all make
[48:07] mistakes don't we but I guess I'm just
[48:11] in that category brother Danny we just
[48:13] don't know how to deal with technology
[48:14] what are we gonna do so keep trying
[48:17] that's right so that was me next week
[48:20] the Lord willing we'll try to reopen the
[48:23] church their signs posted on the door
[48:27] that the Deacons have posted to comply
[48:29] with state regulations and and just some
[48:31] things that we're gonna ask you to do
[48:33] and and I know it's gonna be hard
[48:34] because when we all get back together we
[48:36] want to hug one another we want to shake
[48:38] each other's hand that's part of being
[48:40] together part of being a member of the
[48:42] bride you just feel that closeness and
[48:44] and just try to keep from from being too
[48:47] close during this time and especially in
[48:49] the church building because we're trying
[48:52] to comply with those regulations and to
[48:54] keep one another's safe as well so I
[48:57] understand how hard it is trust me every
[48:59] time I walk up here I want to shake
[49:00] brother David saying
[49:01] and I have to bump his shoulder but but
[49:05] it it works out and and we'll be through
[49:07] this before too long but the Lord
[49:09] willing you pray with me this week we'll
[49:11] be able to do this we'll be able to open
[49:12] next week everyone will be able to be
[49:14] here that wants to be here they can or
[49:16] that should be here and and we'll start
[49:19] working that direction thank you for
[49:21] your patience this has been the hardest
[49:24] thing that you could go through as a
[49:26] church and you've done admirably through
[49:29] this and I've stayed busy so it's not so
[49:32] hard for me because there's so many
[49:33] things you have to do but if you're
[49:35] sitting at home and you can't be around
[49:36] the people of God it's very hard to do
[49:39] and I appreciate you being faithful and
[49:41] I know that the Lord does as well
[49:43] revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 you're
[49:45] being faithful to him not to me or not
[49:47] to the church you're being faithful to
[49:49] God revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 I
[49:52] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[49:55] the throne a book written within and on
[49:58] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[50:02] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[50:04] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[50:06] book and to loose the seals thereof no
[50:09] man in heaven nor in earth neither under
[50:11] the earth was able to open the book
[50:13] neither to look thereon and I wept much
[50:16] because no man was found worthy to open
[50:19] and to read the book neither to look
[50:21] thereon I pray the Lord would add his
[50:25] blessing to the word you may be seated
[50:26] this morning
[50:34] an abstract of title is a condensed
[50:38] history of the title to a particular
[50:41] piece of real estate it's a summary and
[50:45] I want you to kind of get this this
[50:48] morning and so we can continue this
[50:50] maybe I've purposely limited or we're
[50:54] going to talk about this morning so we
[50:55] can get it the way we need to but and by
[50:59] the Lord's help I want to preach this I
[51:01] don't want to just want to teach it but
[51:03] it's a summary of the original grant and
[51:05] all subsequent conveyances so every time
[51:09] the property changes hands there's
[51:11] another page put in the abstract it also
[51:16] includes all the liens on the property
[51:18] so you'd start at the beginning and then
[51:21] you begin to build the abstract up and
[51:25] but the Branham mentions an abstract 44
[51:29] times the message most of the time
[51:30] referring to a real estate abstract
[51:32] there are other meanings to the word but
[51:35] he's referring to a real estate abstract
[51:37] for 244 times in the message beginning
[51:39] in 1953 all the way to 1965 you want to
[51:43] kind of get a background to what we're
[51:45] gonna be preaching on maybe for the next
[51:47] few weeks if the Lord is willing and I'm
[51:49] gonna try to work brother Alan but the
[51:51] Stuart in as well during this time but
[51:53] but just to kind of get an idea of what
[51:56] we're preaching on brother random
[51:57] references this and the breach he talks
[51:59] a lot about it in the Easter seal it is
[52:02] the rising of the Sun and in God's
[52:04] provided place of worship so the
[52:08] abstract and and this is actually a deed
[52:10] you probably can't see that here it'll
[52:11] be a little clearer on the screen maybe
[52:13] but but that's actually the first deed
[52:16] or the patent in an abstract that one is
[52:19] my great-great-grandfather that's the
[52:21] patent of the land that he come and
[52:23] homesteaded in Kabul Missouri here many
[52:26] many years ago back in the 1800s the
[52:29] president I think that sign that has
[52:30] Grover Cleveland and so it's many many
[52:33] years ago that would have been the first
[52:35] page and what that means is that the
[52:39] abstract there had to be an original
[52:43] owner of the property and they
[52:46] discovered some years ago
[52:47] I used to work in title and Oregon
[52:49] County Missouri when they put the
[52:52] 11-point National Scenic Riverway and
[52:54] they begin to try to expand some of that
[52:56] the government realized that there were
[52:57] people who lived over there who never
[52:59] had an a deed or a grant from the
[53:02] government they never had it and so what
[53:05] they realized is that their title could
[53:07] be forfeited they could force them to
[53:09] sell their land because they never got
[53:12] it from the original owner so an
[53:15] abstract goes all the way back in the
[53:17] most important document in that in an
[53:19] abstract other than the current deed is
[53:21] the original patent because it shows who
[53:25] the original owner was the original
[53:29] owner is important because you can't
[53:32] convey or you can't give somebody more
[53:35] than what you have right you have to be
[53:38] able to you can only produce what you
[53:41] have and I think that applies to us
[53:43] spiritually as well but I want us to
[53:45] think about that with God because title
[53:48] must be derived from somewhere it's got
[53:50] to come from somewhere if you own a
[53:52] piece of real estate it had to come from
[53:54] somewhere you didn't just walk onto it
[53:58] and although in some places there are
[53:59] laws where you can eventually claim it
[54:01] as yours
[54:01] but usually title comes from someone
[54:04] else and so when we think about the
[54:08] earth and brother branham talks about
[54:09] this book that was in the hand of the
[54:11] one who sat on the throne being the
[54:13] title deed to the earth and if you think
[54:16] about that that title deed to the earth
[54:17] is actually is actually the document
[54:22] that shows who it belongs to and it also
[54:25] shows the names of those who would be
[54:29] redeemed the names of those who are gods
[54:32] it shows what his property it describes
[54:35] his property oh my and so the abstract
[54:40] then shows that the original owner was
[54:44] God and we find that in Genesis 1 and 1
[54:46] in the beginning God created the heaven
[54:49] and the earth so God is the owner and
[54:52] he's going to give something to his
[54:55] people now he had the absolute right to
[54:58] convey it to
[55:01] and you had the right to place whatever
[55:04] limitations that he wants to on it right
[55:07] so God in the beginning created male and
[55:10] female let's just take that for an
[55:12] example God created them male and female
[55:14] he has a right to distinguish what male
[55:16] and female is he has a right to tell us
[55:19] even how he should dress and how we
[55:21] should act he said why would God be
[55:22] concerned with that because it's his
[55:24] property he made it in the beginning he
[55:29] is the original owner and so he has a
[55:31] righty the original owner affects the
[55:34] title all the way through because if the
[55:36] original owner was the US government you
[55:38] get it from the US government then as it
[55:40] comes down it continues to have the
[55:43] rights and privileges that American land
[55:45] would have but if the original owner
[55:47] with some other government you would
[55:49] live in another country right and so the
[55:52] original owner being God he had a right
[55:55] to convey what he wanted to convey and
[55:58] so Gabriel's instructions to Daniel but
[56:01] the brand simply says he said who was we
[56:04] find who was we find was the original
[56:06] owner God himself so if you go to the
[56:10] first page of that abstract all the way
[56:14] at the bottom if you've got one maybe
[56:17] you've got one at home I wish I had one
[56:19] I've worked with them all this time and
[56:21] I don't have one at home but if you've
[56:23] got one at home usually the first page
[56:26] the bottom is the oldest deed so you go
[56:29] all the way to the bottom and you find
[56:30] your first page where does it come from
[56:33] if it's a good title it comes from the
[56:37] United States government but if you take
[56:39] a son or daughter of God back to the
[56:41] original where did they come from they
[56:44] come from God so he had the absolute
[56:48] right to give to Adam what was his and
[56:54] we find an example of this in in John
[56:57] chapter 8 in verse 38 where Jesus comes
[57:01] to the earth and he begins to examine
[57:03] the title that the Pharisees and the
[57:06] Sadducees said that they had he begins
[57:08] to look through the book and begin to
[57:09] say you're not who you say you are your
[57:13] your deed doesn't go back
[57:15] your chain of title your abstract
[57:16] doesn't go back to the original owner
[57:19] notice what he says I speak that which I
[57:21] have seen with my father and you do that
[57:24] with your thing with your father the
[57:27] answered and said unto Him Abraham is
[57:28] our Father jesus saith unto them if you
[57:30] were Abraham's children you would do the
[57:32] works of Abraham but now you seek to
[57:34] kill me a man that hath told you the
[57:36] truth which I have heard of God this did
[57:38] not Abraham notice he said you do the
[57:40] deeds of your father and they said unto
[57:43] him we're not serpents eat we'd be not
[57:45] born of fornication we have one father
[57:47] even God Jesus said unto them if God
[57:50] were your father if your abstract went
[57:53] back where it was supposed to if he was
[57:55] the original owner you would love me for
[57:58] I proceeded forth and came from God so
[58:01] he said the original owner or the
[58:04] original essence of Who I am is gone he
[58:07] said and neither came I of myself but he
[58:09] sent me so in other words he said I'm
[58:12] able to trace my lineage back and you're
[58:15] not he based said on how they acted now
[58:20] the original owner he's who I want to
[58:23] focus on this morning he has complete
[58:26] control over the status of future owners
[58:30] he can rent the property he can sell the
[58:33] property he can sell it with conditions
[58:36] he can make covenants with the people
[58:40] that he's given it to try title your
[58:46] title that you hold as a grand G as the
[58:48] owner of property is never greater than
[58:51] the original owners you can't give where
[58:55] he can't give what he does in half so he
[58:58] can only give but he doesn't have to
[59:00] give all of it and we find that he was
[59:02] created the heavens and the earth but he
[59:04] didn't give man title to the heavens but
[59:07] he gave him title to the earth so it
[59:10] gives him a specific piece of real
[59:12] estate to have dominion over job 38 and
[59:17] 4 let's look at this original owner
[59:20] because job is complaining about the
[59:22] things that he's going through in the
[59:23] trials of life and some of us where the
[59:25] Caleb we do the same thing we begin to
[59:27] almost did
[59:27] recognize you back there we begin to
[59:30] complain and and we begin to worry about
[59:33] the things that we've went through it
[59:34] and as we go through life we don't
[59:37] realize he's got it in his hands he's
[59:40] the original owner he has rights to be
[59:43] able to affect her life and so he told
[59:46] jovi said where were you when I laid the
[59:48] foundations of the earth declare if thou
[59:51] hath understanding if you're gonna
[59:54] complain about it you're gonna talk and
[59:56] wonder where I'm at where were you Amen
[59:58] who has laid the measured sir how's it
[1:00:01] sound knowest who has stretched the line
[1:00:03] upon us in other words who who knows the
[1:00:06] description of it he did because he was
[1:00:08] the original owner he said I know
[1:00:11] exactly how far the seas go I know
[1:00:13] exactly how deep the earth is I know
[1:00:15] exactly the distance between the earth
[1:00:17] and the heavens I know everything about
[1:00:19] it oh if he said if I know that he said
[1:00:22] where were you why because he's
[1:00:23] comparing his own status of ownership
[1:00:26] with with job's all you do is walk on
[1:00:29] and all you do is benefit from it but
[1:00:31] here I own it all it belongs to me and
[1:00:35] so I have a right to do it that what I
[1:00:36] want to he said we're a partner the
[1:00:38] foundations are fastened who laid the
[1:00:41] cornerstone thereof when the morning
[1:00:44] stars sang together all the sons of God
[1:00:47] shouted for joy so he used this also
[1:00:52] real estate language we says who laid
[1:00:54] the measures who stretched the line who
[1:00:56] described it and I say at forty five and
[1:01:00] five God again is asserting his rights
[1:01:04] and I think sometimes God does that and
[1:01:06] we don't understand but God says to the
[1:01:09] claim he says you're the clay I'm the
[1:01:12] Potter all right
[1:01:14] and sometimes God reminds the world who
[1:01:16] he is right he didn't have to Agrippa
[1:01:20] when he stood there and they said it's
[1:01:23] the voice of a god and and he began to
[1:01:25] speak and God smote him why did God do
[1:01:28] that you know he was going to come into
[1:01:30] judgment anyway wasn't gods but God was
[1:01:33] reminding them who was in charge right
[1:01:36] and I think sometimes things like we've
[1:01:37] been through lately it's God reminding
[1:01:40] us who's in charge
[1:01:41] it's not us it's not a passenger it's
[1:01:43] not a preacher it's not not a church
[1:01:45] it's not a government it's not anybody
[1:01:47] else but it's God and ultimately he's
[1:01:50] the one who can make life go right and
[1:01:53] so and I said forty five and five he
[1:01:55] said I am the Lord and there is none
[1:01:58] else there is no God beside me I girded
[1:02:02] these Oh thou hast not known me he said
[1:02:05] I'm the original owner
[1:02:06] look look look on the patent you can see
[1:02:09] it's my name there he said I girded me
[1:02:14] though that's not normally verse six
[1:02:16] that they may know from the rising of
[1:02:18] the Sun and from the West that there is
[1:02:19] none beside me I am the Lord and there
[1:02:22] is none else I formed the light oh my
[1:02:27] and create darkness I make beats and
[1:02:31] create evil and why did we have the
[1:02:34] coronavirus because God allowed it he
[1:02:37] said I do this I the LORD do all these
[1:02:39] things drop down you heavens from above
[1:02:41] let the skies pour down righteousness
[1:02:44] left the earth open let them bring forth
[1:02:46] salvation let righteous to spring up
[1:02:48] together I the LORD have created it
[1:02:51] verse nine wohin to him that striveth
[1:02:54] with this maker let the potsherd strive
[1:02:57] with the potsherds of the earth shall
[1:02:59] the clay say to him that fashion is it
[1:03:01] what make his style or that work he has
[1:03:04] no hands that's what they're doing today
[1:03:07] is what the Governor of New York did not
[1:03:09] long ago God didn't have nothing to do
[1:03:10] with this we'll find out he's got less
[1:03:14] control than he thinks he does when I
[1:03:16] kiss now you've got no hands you have no
[1:03:21] ability to affect the earth he said can
[1:03:23] the clay say that to the original owner
[1:03:26] they been won't to him thus saith unto
[1:03:30] his father what began of Sal we'd say to
[1:03:34] our kids maybe you don't say this but
[1:03:36] I've heard it said I brought you into
[1:03:38] this world and I can take you out I'm
[1:03:42] the original owner amen I'm the original
[1:03:49] owner and he said what beget is Sal you
[1:03:51] say to your father what began a sour to
[1:03:52] the woman what
[1:03:53] that's uh brought forth thus says the
[1:03:57] Lord the Holy One of Israel and his
[1:03:59] maker ask me of things to come
[1:04:02] concerning my sons and concerning the
[1:04:06] work of my hands come in
[1:04:07] you mean in other words you want to know
[1:04:09] what's gonna happen ask me he said I've
[1:04:12] made the earth and created man upon it
[1:04:16] I even my hands my hands have stretched
[1:04:19] out the heavens and all their hosts have
[1:04:22] I commanded this is called sovereignty
[1:04:27] sovereignty God made it he has a right
[1:04:31] to define it he has a right to say what
[1:04:34] it is and we could take this into every
[1:04:36] area of our life and I don't want to get
[1:04:37] too far off the track but God set in the
[1:04:40] church apostles prophets pastors
[1:04:42] evangelists and teachers if God said it
[1:04:44] in the church he made it right no one
[1:04:47] can take it out if God said there's
[1:04:49] healing he made it he said I'm the Lord
[1:04:51] that healeth see that's who I made it we
[1:04:53] don't understand why we just say we'd
[1:04:55] rather just be well not healed does that
[1:04:58] make sense we'd rather just never get
[1:04:59] sick but God put healing in the church
[1:05:01] why why because he made it as part of
[1:05:03] his character as part of who he is he
[1:05:05] has the right I don't understand why we
[1:05:09] have why we call for the elders of the
[1:05:10] church to lay hands on the sick I don't
[1:05:12] completely understand that but he made
[1:05:14] it right he has a right to say it to put
[1:05:18] it in his word I don't understand why
[1:05:21] the same God who said speak what you
[1:05:23] have need of also said the effectual
[1:05:25] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:05:26] availeth much and on one hand you could
[1:05:29] just walk out and speak to the mountain
[1:05:30] and on the other hand you cry to God
[1:05:32] every day I don't understand how Jesus
[1:05:35] himself could get in the Garden of
[1:05:36] Gethsemane as if it's possible let this
[1:05:38] cup pass from me why wouldn't he just
[1:05:41] accept it but God made it that way he
[1:05:46] said nevertheless not my will but thine
[1:05:48] be done yes sir right I heard a preacher
[1:05:53] say it this way when talking about
[1:05:55] predestination people say well that's
[1:05:57] that would be awful of God would be
[1:05:58] unjust of God to save some and condemn
[1:06:01] others but he has a right to have a
[1:06:03] family he has a right to have children
[1:06:06] he is a
[1:06:07] right to have a church has a right to
[1:06:09] have a bride has a right to have a
[1:06:12] pocketful of change in a silver dollars
[1:06:14] and pennies and nickels and whatever
[1:06:15] else said he wants to do he has a right
[1:06:17] to do it he has a right to call a man
[1:06:20] who lived all of his life as a drunkard
[1:06:21] drug anacott and a donor and everything
[1:06:24] else he can call that man and a man that
[1:06:26] lives seemingly a good life not be cold
[1:06:28] at all why would he call Paul to do what
[1:06:31] he did why would he call the ones in the
[1:06:33] Bible because God maintains the right to
[1:06:36] do the work in his own creation and
[1:06:39] we've got to let him do that
[1:06:43] amen it's God I don't get mixed up in
[1:06:48] God's work and that's why I've told you
[1:06:51] that's my heart I I don't want to make
[1:06:53] people come to church I want to get
[1:06:55] mixed up in God's work I want to preach
[1:06:58] the word and the people that can come
[1:07:01] and can sit under that ministry then let
[1:07:02] them come and sit and those that can't
[1:07:04] go and go somewhere else I don't want to
[1:07:07] mess with God's work I'm not gonna tell
[1:07:11] you everything that you need to do and
[1:07:14] what what cars you need to buy and stuff
[1:07:16] like that I'm just not going to do it
[1:07:17] God needs to do his work but God does
[1:07:21] this work
[1:07:22] are you with me now God needs to God has
[1:07:25] certain prerogatives that he has over
[1:07:28] the preacher over the singer over
[1:07:30] everybody else we have to let God do his
[1:07:32] work not that we don't fall under
[1:07:35] headship but we need to make sure we're
[1:07:37] under the headship of God now look he
[1:07:42] said I made it my hands did it now as I
[1:07:47] said he has the right to put certain
[1:07:48] conditions on his conveyance or
[1:07:51] covenants and we still call it that
[1:07:54] today that when you make promises and
[1:07:58] indeed your covenant with someone and so
[1:08:02] he has a right to covenant with those
[1:08:04] who he made with those who are his is a
[1:08:08] right to make a covenant and he has a
[1:08:11] right to change covenants and he's the
[1:08:14] only one who has the right to change
[1:08:16] covenants right
[1:08:20] again if there's going to be a new
[1:08:22] covenant made it can't be made by the
[1:08:24] human race must be made by God we find
[1:08:26] that in Genesis 17 and 1 we find Abram
[1:08:29] was ninety years old and nine the Lord
[1:08:32] appeared to him and said unto him I am
[1:08:33] the Almighty God I am the Almighty God
[1:08:36] walk before me and be thou perfect I am
[1:08:42] El Shaddai
[1:08:43] I am the Almighty God walk before me be
[1:08:46] thou perfect and perfect and I will make
[1:08:49] my covenant between me and thee he
[1:08:53] doesn't say we'll make it together
[1:08:54] he doesn't say as he did the first
[1:08:57] covenant if you will I will he said I'll
[1:08:58] make my covenant with you he said and
[1:09:04] between me and thee and will multiply
[1:09:05] thee exceedingly now brother branham
[1:09:10] taught us in the masterpiece and you can
[1:09:13] go and find many other things other than
[1:09:15] what we're gonna read today but I'm
[1:09:16] gonna try not to - just read too much
[1:09:18] but I want you to understand this he
[1:09:21] said now we find that the end of the
[1:09:22] Louvre Ian's world comes along and
[1:09:24] destroyed the whole thing he said
[1:09:26] because the covenants that was made was
[1:09:29] made conditionally so that's why the
[1:09:31] flood came and all of that
[1:09:32] he said the covenants that was made was
[1:09:34] made conditionally if you will not do
[1:09:36] this if you will do that God the great
[1:09:39] sculptor had seen that man could not
[1:09:41] keep a covenant you just can't do it
[1:09:44] there's just no way at all we can't keep
[1:09:48] our promises can we say we're gonna do a
[1:09:51] certain thing and it's completely
[1:09:52] subject to the will of God and it's
[1:09:55] subject to our own mistakes I read a
[1:09:58] quote the other day where brother
[1:09:59] brother said he had visions and he said
[1:10:01] he's and he talked like it was something
[1:10:02] that happened I don't know that happened
[1:10:03] all the time but something that had
[1:10:05] happened several times where he said I
[1:10:06] had a vision he said and God told me
[1:10:08] exactly what to do and I missed it and
[1:10:11] we find that brother Randall dealing
[1:10:13] with the brown bear and all of that that
[1:10:15] there would be a certain thing God told
[1:10:16] him to do and maybe circumstances made
[1:10:18] it where he couldn't do that or or
[1:10:20] somehow but it's a failure on our part
[1:10:22] not God's right it's a failure on our
[1:10:25] part and so man cannot keep a covenant
[1:10:27] because he's human he just can't do it
[1:10:29] he's born in sin shipping iniquity
[1:10:33] at all he says in brother branham did
[1:10:36] not say message he talked about I
[1:10:39] believe it was mr. Bruce it's the one
[1:10:40] that he had the interview with and he
[1:10:42] said on the interview a few minutes ago
[1:10:44] he said I was speaking to a person in
[1:10:45] the room mr. president now that
[1:10:47] interview is on tape he said but brother
[1:10:49] branham she said but brother branham I
[1:10:52] have so many things that I know that's
[1:10:53] wrong and the godly little woman I said
[1:10:55] but look sister you don't look at
[1:10:58] yourself it's just what your desire is
[1:11:00] what you try to do now that seems too
[1:11:04] simple for us because we want to try to
[1:11:06] figure out how to say well did this
[1:11:08] happened at a certain time and no what's
[1:11:10] your desire what do you try to do what
[1:11:12] do you really want if we could put it
[1:11:14] that way he said if you really love the
[1:11:17] Lord you try to serve him with all your
[1:11:20] heart and then all your mistakes is hid
[1:11:23] in the blood of the Lord Jesus aren't
[1:11:25] you glad for that today he said see he
[1:11:28] made away and he goes on he said so he
[1:11:31] began now taking men from his covenants
[1:11:33] of saying that if you will I will and he
[1:11:37] begin with the men called Abraham and
[1:11:39] give to Abrahamic covenant
[1:11:40] unconditionally and so he says every
[1:11:43] time he would start a masterpiece
[1:11:45] Satan would get it because the word he
[1:11:48] said but when he started with Abraham he
[1:11:49] said I have already done it he said now
[1:11:52] this is unconditionally not if you will
[1:11:54] I will but I've already done it I love
[1:11:58] this
[1:11:58] he said now he the sculptor we could say
[1:12:01] the original owner the person with the
[1:12:04] rights all of the rights the person has
[1:12:09] a right to affect the clay to mold it he
[1:12:11] the sculptor is determined to have this
[1:12:14] masterpiece and so we find that there
[1:12:19] had to be a conveyance of the title so
[1:12:25] we come from the original owner and he
[1:12:28] creates Adam and he gives him what he
[1:12:32] gives him dominion over the earth
[1:12:35] Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in
[1:12:37] our image after our likeness let them
[1:12:41] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:12:43] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:12:44] the cattle and we're all the earth over
[1:12:46] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:12:48] earth so God created man in his own
[1:12:50] image and the image of God created he
[1:12:51] him male and female created he them and
[1:12:54] God bless him and God said unto them be
[1:12:56] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:12:58] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[1:13:01] over the fish of the sea I would quote
[1:13:04] that every time I go fishing brother
[1:13:05] Harvey he said have dominion over the
[1:13:09] fish of the sea and he says in the fowl
[1:13:14] of the air and over every living thing
[1:13:16] that moveth upon the earth man has
[1:13:19] dominion that word means to tread down
[1:13:22] or to reign over to rule over to take
[1:13:26] but the brandon takes it maybe a little
[1:13:29] bit further than what we would think of
[1:13:31] it maybe further than I would have
[1:13:33] hadn't been him that said it but he says
[1:13:35] it this way said a man was made to be
[1:13:37] God he said to be a God do you know that
[1:13:41] he's in the image of God he's the son of
[1:13:43] God he's like him he was given a domain
[1:13:46] Genesis 1:26 dominion over the whole
[1:13:49] earth that's right he ruled the earth he
[1:13:51] ruled the animal kingdom all the other
[1:13:53] kingdoms all but the kingdom of God
[1:13:55] above right he was a God of the earth
[1:13:58] God he said it's the God of the universe
[1:14:01] everywhere but his son had this earth
[1:14:03] under his own control see that's what
[1:14:05] God gave him God gave him a title to the
[1:14:08] earth he said he could speak he could
[1:14:10] name he could say he could stop nature
[1:14:12] he could do anything he wanted to but
[1:14:15] when he did that he said he lost his
[1:14:18] inheritance oh that ought to make us
[1:14:21] think - today he could do anything he
[1:14:23] wanted to when he did anything he wanted
[1:14:25] to he lost his inheritance are you with
[1:14:29] me Helen so God had to do more than just
[1:14:34] make a new covenant he had to put
[1:14:35] something within us so would want to
[1:14:36] make us do it well just want us to make
[1:14:39] us want to do it right he had to give us
[1:14:43] a desire because we didn't have that
[1:14:45] desire and human beings always ran from
[1:14:48] God so God had to place his own life
[1:14:51] inside of you to make you have a desire
[1:14:53] to serve God now he said no Adam could
[1:14:59] say
[1:15:00] this mountain here be moved over there
[1:15:02] and it would do it enough you own land
[1:15:07] and you get just certain part of it you
[1:15:08] want to move there's a hill there if
[1:15:10] you've got enough time and money in it
[1:15:12] want to put up effort in it you can move
[1:15:14] it you can take it and take a loader and
[1:15:17] a bucket whatever and then and push that
[1:15:19] a bulldozer push that mountain down if
[1:15:23] you if you won't want to bad enough you
[1:15:26] can move it
[1:15:27] what's your property God had that kind
[1:15:30] of right to create the earth and he give
[1:15:33] Adam those kind of rights Big Ben to
[1:15:37] have dominion over the earth but the Ben
[1:15:40] said it would do it Adam could say let
[1:15:42] this tree here be plucked up and planted
[1:15:44] over here it would do it for he had
[1:15:47] complete supreme control as a minor God
[1:15:50] under God our Father because he was the
[1:15:52] son of God and so we find then that in
[1:15:57] this in this page so we we've gone we've
[1:16:00] looked at the first page of the abstract
[1:16:02] we see that God is the original owner we
[1:16:05] flip up to the next page and we find
[1:16:06] that not only is God the original owner
[1:16:09] but man took possession of it right so
[1:16:13] the second deed if you'd look at it
[1:16:14] would say from God to Adam right to Adam
[1:16:20] now so the Covenant was made in Genesis
[1:16:24] 2:16 now this deed wasn't just God
[1:16:27] owning it but he said I'm gonna make
[1:16:29] conditions in this deed there's going to
[1:16:32] be a certain little thing they have to
[1:16:33] do or not do in order to keep possession
[1:16:37] this Dominion in the earth and so
[1:16:41] Genesis 2:16 says the Lord God commanded
[1:16:43] the man saying of every tree of the
[1:16:46] garden thou mayest freely eat but of the
[1:16:48] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:16:50] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[1:16:53] that thou eatest thereof he said thou
[1:16:55] shalt surely die so here's the cause if
[1:17:01] someone said that whatever we put in in
[1:17:03] big friend on the front page we take
[1:17:04] away in small print on the second page
[1:17:06] so God is not taking away his Dominion
[1:17:09] but he's saying it's subject to
[1:17:11] something it's subject to obedience
[1:17:14] but he said I'm gonna put you on a free
[1:17:16] moral agency where you can disobey you
[1:17:22] oh my now look now I want you to notice
[1:17:26] as we're going through this that at that
[1:17:28] time Adam and Eve were one it's not yet
[1:17:31] separated Eve from Adams body and so but
[1:17:35] the Harvey this means that what he spoke
[1:17:36] to Adam he spoke to Eve - there's no
[1:17:40] record that even joined any lesser
[1:17:43] privileges than Adam before the fall she
[1:17:47] was in him when the covenant was made
[1:17:51] right so being in him and part of him
[1:17:55] whatever was granted to her was granted
[1:17:58] to him
[1:17:59] because she was him quite literally at
[1:18:03] that time so he could say I give to you
[1:18:07] Adam Dominion he was giving it to Adam
[1:18:09] he said male and female created he them
[1:18:11] and Eve because that spirit lay within
[1:18:14] him that rib was still there so no
[1:18:18] lesser privileges that'll be important
[1:18:20] as we go on now this made the things
[1:18:24] that were in the garden Adams personal
[1:18:26] property had to deed to the earth and he
[1:18:28] can look out at all the animals and he
[1:18:30] could begin to name them Genesis chapter
[1:18:32] 2 and verse 19 out of the ground the
[1:18:34] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[1:18:35] every fowl of the air and brought them
[1:18:38] unto Adam because Adam had dominion over
[1:18:40] these things to every fowl of the air
[1:18:43] and brought them unto Adam to see what
[1:18:44] he would call them and whatsoever Adam
[1:18:46] called every living creature that was
[1:18:49] the name thereof and Adam gave names to
[1:18:52] all cattle and to the fowl of the air to
[1:18:55] every beast of the field but for Adam
[1:18:58] there was not found to help meet for him
[1:19:02] now he had personal property but the
[1:19:05] woman was not his personal property she
[1:19:07] was part of him and in the in the guard
[1:19:11] and they were co-equals there had not
[1:19:13] been a fall there was not two separate
[1:19:15] covenants until the fall before the fall
[1:19:19] there was one covenant they both had to
[1:19:21] abide by the same thing and yet she is a
[1:19:26] well the man calls the byproduct which
[1:19:27] sounds like something that's Lester but
[1:19:30] what it means is it comes from him it
[1:19:32] comes from the original and people use
[1:19:34] that as something a lesser thing about
[1:19:36] products not a lesser thing it just
[1:19:37] means it's part of the original and so
[1:19:40] she was part of the original she's not
[1:19:41] his property she's part of him right and
[1:19:45] they have a 50/50 relationship which we
[1:19:48] can say it that way but but yet they
[1:19:50] they own the earth and so it's it's
[1:19:52] unique because it's a marriage
[1:19:54] relationship and justice 221 the Lord
[1:19:57] God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[1:19:59] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[1:20:02] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[1:20:03] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:20:06] had taken from man made he a woman and
[1:20:07] he brought her into the man had him said
[1:20:09] this is now bone of my bones flesh of my
[1:20:11] flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:20:13] she was taken out of man so we find then
[1:20:18] that here they are there and as a unit
[1:20:21] that's a couple they have rights
[1:20:23] dominion over the earth and I want you
[1:20:27] to think of both of them in that in that
[1:20:28] situation they did now they fulfill
[1:20:31] different roles because she was the
[1:20:32] feminist part and he was the masculine
[1:20:34] part but yet they were equal in their
[1:20:37] decision-making they did things together
[1:20:40] are you with me now now it's going to
[1:20:45] come down because they'll we realized
[1:20:47] that it did not stay in that condition
[1:20:49] or that's all the abstracts would be
[1:20:52] today
[1:20:52] God transferring it to Adam go out the
[1:20:56] original owner and him transferring it
[1:20:58] to Adam there's a patent we could close
[1:21:00] the book but Adam could not maintain the
[1:21:05] status that he had look it and when you
[1:21:11] lose the status of title when you lose
[1:21:14] it because of something you did it's
[1:21:16] called a forfeiture a forfeiture and
[1:21:20] this was what we would call a voluntary
[1:21:23] forfeiture this is something that Adam
[1:21:27] gives up knowing he's giving it up oh my
[1:21:32] now there's a saying in in legal realms
[1:21:35] that always have stuck with me that
[1:21:37] equity abhors a forfeiture in other
[1:21:40] words
[1:21:40] there's certain Maxim's in law that have
[1:21:42] been handed down from generation to
[1:21:43] generation one of them is that equity
[1:21:45] aboard the forfeiture equity being
[1:21:47] what's right what's just the law it
[1:21:51] dislikes someone just giving up their
[1:21:53] property and that's why if you look at a
[1:21:56] deed in Arkansas in Missouri it's got a
[1:21:58] dollar amount on it it usually says ten
[1:22:01] dollars someone will say for love and
[1:22:03] affection
[1:22:04] it's called consideration they don't
[1:22:07] want you just giving something for
[1:22:08] nothing right the law requires something
[1:22:12] to be given and something to be paid so
[1:22:16] a forfeiture is the total loss of a
[1:22:18] right or a thing because of the failure
[1:22:21] to do something that was required and a
[1:22:24] total loss is a very stiff penalty to
[1:22:27] have a total forfeiture of title a loss
[1:22:29] of title you have to almost willingly
[1:22:31] give it up you have to ignore all the
[1:22:34] tax bills right because here in America
[1:22:37] we own land subject to taxes right taxes
[1:22:41] are a first lien on all property in the
[1:22:42] United States except on what's owned by
[1:22:44] the government and accept certain
[1:22:46] exemptions like churches but you take a
[1:22:50] normal piece of property owned by a
[1:22:51] private landowner it taxes our first
[1:22:53] lien so if you don't pay your taxes
[1:22:55] eventually they'll take it away but what
[1:22:58] do they do they send you notice after
[1:22:59] notice after notice after notice why
[1:23:03] they don't want you to lose it and God
[1:23:06] made it very clear to them what they had
[1:23:09] to do for the steward to keep it and
[1:23:11] this I think he kind of gets rather
[1:23:13] serious for us this morning
[1:23:14] because God has made it very clear to us
[1:23:17] what we need to do but not to keep it
[1:23:21] ourselves but to receive him so he can
[1:23:24] keep it because he will keep what's his
[1:23:29] but here they had to keep it themselves
[1:23:31] in so it this stiff penalty it wouldn't
[1:23:35] be fair and the law even understands
[1:23:37] that today a court will refuse to permit
[1:23:41] an unreasonable forfeiture so God put
[1:23:45] them in the earth and he gives them
[1:23:47] every blessed thing he could give them
[1:23:49] every right every bit of peace
[1:23:51] every bit of joy they had everything you
[1:23:55] think about it they had everything they
[1:23:57] could ever want at their fingertips they
[1:24:01] didn't have to struggle for it they
[1:24:02] didn't have to fight for it they didn't
[1:24:04] have to go in and shoot a bunch of
[1:24:06] people to keep Mostel hand they had
[1:24:09] everything right there nothing to hurt
[1:24:11] nothing to destroy everything was good
[1:24:14] so god puts him in an extremely good
[1:24:17] position he said this is yours it's all
[1:24:19] yours just don't take of the tree look
[1:24:26] it's it's yours he puts him in the
[1:24:28] position or for them to lose it would be
[1:24:31] just them walking away from it
[1:24:33] purposefully now Eve being a byproduct
[1:24:39] if we can say it that way but being
[1:24:41] someone who wasn't in the original
[1:24:42] creation she could fall
[1:24:44] it also means she could be redeemed so
[1:24:47] our redemption had to come by a woman
[1:24:49] but it's why we don't God we don't have
[1:24:52] women preachers because after the
[1:24:53] follows two covenants women don't run
[1:24:56] the church because and that's not the
[1:25:00] plaintiffs way that we can say it but we
[1:25:01] just we don't allow that because there's
[1:25:04] the two covenants but one day it's going
[1:25:06] back equal again right and I believe we
[1:25:10] are equal as sons and daughters of God
[1:25:12] in Christ there's neither male or female
[1:25:13] but when it comes to the natural things
[1:25:16] and the preaching of the word and things
[1:25:17] like that a woman can't do that
[1:25:19] there's a reason because Eve could be
[1:25:21] deceived she was deceivableness not de
[1:25:25] siiva believed had just been deceived
[1:25:28] and left and did what she did God
[1:25:32] couldn't have allowed a total forfeiture
[1:25:34] because he made her or allowed her to be
[1:25:37] deceivableness how we all fall oh my
[1:25:50] that's why a pastor told me one time he
[1:25:54] said every time there's a problem in a
[1:25:57] marriage and maybe I'm getting too far
[1:25:59] off of this but I think it's important
[1:26:00] this morning he said if there's a
[1:26:02] problem in a marriage you said the first
[1:26:03] thing that I do he said
[1:26:05] and he said I take a young couple that's
[1:26:07] just getting marry he said I bring them
[1:26:08] in and I'll look at him I say now in ten
[1:26:11] years if she's just the retreat
[1:26:13] prostitute he said I'm gonna come and
[1:26:15] ask you what you did why because a man
[1:26:19] has responsibility man Adam had
[1:26:24] responsibility but when we take up
[1:26:28] responsibilities we think well Adam you
[1:26:30] had a responsibility to stay oh but I
[1:26:33] just thought the heart of God Adam was
[1:26:37] like God and being like God he he had
[1:26:41] redemption in him there's something in
[1:26:43] him that wanted Redemption not only for
[1:26:45] himself but for her and the son of God
[1:26:49] don't want just redemption for
[1:26:50] themselves they want redemption for her
[1:26:52] for the bride amen
[1:26:56] and so here Adam with this
[1:26:59] responsibility actually causes the whole
[1:27:02] human race to fall by going out with Eve
[1:27:04] in order to win her back now those who
[1:27:11] are lost will reject every attempt at
[1:27:14] redemption you don't go to hell
[1:27:15] easily God knows who will and who won't
[1:27:19] and yet even gives Cain an opportunity
[1:27:22] and said if you do what your brother did
[1:27:24] and he gives every one of us an
[1:27:27] opportunity but the Brandon talks about
[1:27:29] how that if you go to hell you you'll
[1:27:30] pass every roadblock that God puts in
[1:27:32] your way you'll put where the RAM talks
[1:27:34] about how song services can be a
[1:27:35] roadblock to to going to help God allow
[1:27:38] songs to be sung he'll I messages to be
[1:27:40] preached you put something in your way
[1:27:42] there'll be something there to tell you
[1:27:46] that you should repent and even your
[1:27:50] conscience and everything else so he
[1:27:51] puts everything in front of you he gives
[1:27:54] you every chance that he can and even
[1:27:57] time lingers on to give us the
[1:27:59] opportunity to repent and we find us
[1:28:03] they went on now how did they lose it
[1:28:06] well the serpent gives some bad legal
[1:28:10] advice in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4
[1:28:14] don't go to the serpent for legal advice
[1:28:18] don't go to the serpent for counseling
[1:28:21] right because the serpent doesn't have
[1:28:23] your best interest at heart he'll give
[1:28:27] you bad legal advice for momentary
[1:28:30] pleasure the serpent Center to the woman
[1:28:33] you shall not surely die for God doth
[1:28:37] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:28:39] then your eyes should be open you should
[1:28:40] be as God's knowing good and evil but
[1:28:42] look they already were brother branham
[1:28:45] tells us that they already were gods so
[1:28:49] he tries to deceive them into thinking
[1:28:51] they had less than what they had don't
[1:28:53] we see that all around us today there's
[1:28:56] so many when you find a deceiver when
[1:28:58] you find the false prophet you find
[1:29:00] someone who tries to tell the people
[1:29:01] what they don't have and tries to put it
[1:29:04] off into another age and say well when
[1:29:06] so-and-so comes back or so and so it's
[1:29:08] gonna do this and so you gotta listen to
[1:29:10] this preacher you've got to belong to my
[1:29:11] church you got to move across the
[1:29:13] country with me what's he doing he's a
[1:29:14] deceiver because what he does is he ties
[1:29:17] it to himself and then he says sense
[1:29:21] that you've got to do that in order
[1:29:23] because there's something yet unfinished
[1:29:25] but God said it's a finished work so
[1:29:30] Satan says you're not what you could be
[1:29:33] and I can make you better God does know
[1:29:37] she'll be as gods listen we don't need
[1:29:41] the Serpent's program to have dominion
[1:29:43] we already have it so well where is it
[1:29:47] it's been restored where is it the word
[1:29:50] is naívi all right and with all my heart
[1:29:55] I believe that don't let circumstances
[1:29:58] talk to you out of what you have and
[1:30:00] it's the biggest thing I've seen it all
[1:30:02] through my life how people will will
[1:30:04] look at the Word of God and say well we
[1:30:05] need more of this we need more emotion
[1:30:07] or we need more sensation or we need a
[1:30:09] better ministry we need another prophet
[1:30:11] we need this know we have exactly what
[1:30:13] we need now look
[1:30:19] he said the serpent said God is a good
[1:30:21] God and he was he is a good god he
[1:30:25] abhors the forfeiture to do everything
[1:30:27] he can to keep it from happening but he
[1:30:29] had already done that for them
[1:30:31] but he will keep his word the good
[1:30:36] companies adjust goddess brother Branham
[1:30:38] says over and over again and so we find
[1:30:41] that Adam and Eve as a couple Eve
[1:30:46] listens to the serpent and she is
[1:30:50] overtaken by him she is seduced by him
[1:30:53] and then Adam commits the sin with her
[1:30:56] as well now titled to the earth was held
[1:30:58] in Adam and Eve if we could say it that
[1:31:00] way today the way we would do that legal
[1:31:02] is Adam and Eve husband and wife Adam
[1:31:05] and Eve husband and wife and there's a
[1:31:06] legal doctrine that still exists today
[1:31:08] which they're trying to do away with
[1:31:09] because it doesn't work for gay marriage
[1:31:12] it just doesn't work but used to in a
[1:31:16] marriage had a special status in title
[1:31:19] you hold a status in title as a married
[1:31:21] person in most states that no one else
[1:31:24] hopes and it's called a tenancy by the
[1:31:27] entireties and what it means is when you
[1:31:28] put both your names on a deed it states
[1:31:30] that you're a married couple that you
[1:31:32] both own 100% of the title so if a lien
[1:31:36] is put against your wife it shouldn't
[1:31:39] attach although in Arkansas they make
[1:31:41] you pay it off anyway but it shouldn't
[1:31:43] attach to your property and in Missouri
[1:31:45] I can let that go because because it
[1:31:47] doesn't attach because just because it's
[1:31:49] against you but it's not against him his
[1:31:52] title is clear and her title can't
[1:31:54] affect his because they don't own it
[1:31:55] 50/50 it'll own it like a partnership
[1:31:58] but they own it together are you with me
[1:32:02] a hundred percent and only as a married
[1:32:04] couple can you do that and the purpose
[1:32:06] of that is so title can easily pass to
[1:32:08] your heirs and so someone wouldn't get
[1:32:11] married to someone they didn't know and
[1:32:13] then them getting title and then
[1:32:14] encumber all of their property they lose
[1:32:16] everything because the person they
[1:32:17] married so there's those two things now
[1:32:19] so they don't hold 50:50 they hold
[1:32:22] together their one flesh and I think we
[1:32:25] can look at that scripture later that
[1:32:26] they're one flesh brother branham said
[1:32:29] that the serpent separated Adam and Eve
[1:32:33] sinned Jehovah Jireh he said notice he
[1:32:37] separated Adam and Eve he separated them
[1:32:40] and she fell that's the same thing he
[1:32:44] wants to do
[1:32:46] that's what's so dangerous to be
[1:32:48] separated from Christ there's times when
[1:32:53] you'll be separate like we have been
[1:32:54] from each other but don't ever become
[1:32:56] separated from Christ don't ever walk
[1:33:00] away from him her from his word because
[1:33:02] that's what the devil wants you to do
[1:33:04] when they're there come a difference
[1:33:06] between her and Adam he separated Eve
[1:33:10] and Adam and she fell Adam went with her
[1:33:14] oh my he said Adam was not deceived Eve
[1:33:18] was deceived but Adam the first Adam was
[1:33:21] God's son also and he went out because
[1:33:24] of the love of Eve to try to bring her
[1:33:28] back because he loved her now look he
[1:33:33] could have let her go put her away and
[1:33:37] he had every right to do it but if he
[1:33:40] had put her away her part of that status
[1:33:44] would not be redeemable anymore I hope
[1:33:49] you understand this the redemption would
[1:33:52] only continue would only be an option if
[1:33:56] they were married you could put her away
[1:34:01] but he can't just take away what's hers
[1:34:02] because it was given to her in him that
[1:34:06] make sense so in order for the earth to
[1:34:08] be redeemed as a whole both of them had
[1:34:10] to be redeemed couldn't be just one of
[1:34:14] them don't you see that just the same as
[1:34:18] Christ came and died for you and I
[1:34:20] that's the same way that you and I have
[1:34:22] Redemption today and it's guaranteed
[1:34:24] it's got to happen he's got to have a
[1:34:27] bride because if he has no bride
[1:34:29] he has no works are you with me now
[1:34:33] he can't guarantee title to the earth
[1:34:36] without her because she was part of it
[1:34:39] hey Ben just the same as Abraham God
[1:34:43] could not smite Sarah even though she
[1:34:45] laughed but but she was part of Abraham
[1:34:48] hey Beth and she had rights in the land
[1:34:51] but they were hindered they were they
[1:34:54] were forfeited because of what she did
[1:34:56] but the only way to bring redemption
[1:34:58] back was not for Adam to keep his rights
[1:35:00] but to give his up to hey Ben he said
[1:35:07] for the love of each to try to bring her
[1:35:08] back because he loved her but God forced
[1:35:11] saw the bride in the groom he says see
[1:35:15] said to save his wife like Adam he had
[1:35:17] to go with her listen to save his wife
[1:35:21] he had to go with her Adam knew what he
[1:35:24] was doing Eve didn't know what she was
[1:35:26] doing but Adam walked out with his wife
[1:35:27] and Jesus took his last place and became
[1:35:31] sin for her aren't you glad he did this
[1:35:33] warn him remember he said he become you
[1:35:35] he stood your punishment that you might
[1:35:37] stand in his place so we're looking
[1:35:42] before go back we said well that's
[1:35:44] strange
[1:35:45] how could they forfeit it what happens
[1:35:47] to it does it just this the title just
[1:35:50] flowed out there for anyone to grab hold
[1:35:52] of it what happens to it well they
[1:35:55] forfeited it by sinning and so Satan's
[1:35:59] laid claim on him squatted on it if you
[1:36:02] could put it that way you laid claim on
[1:36:04] it said it's mine that was death Satan
[1:36:10] said they're mine they've got to die
[1:36:12] because you said so God but Satan
[1:36:17] couldn't hold the title himself because
[1:36:20] he too was a sinner he couldn't hold the
[1:36:24] title and he was unredeemable now but
[1:36:28] the brother said God first saw her and
[1:36:30] he took his wife's place and he stood
[1:36:33] your punishment and so now they've
[1:36:35] walked out and we see them being evicted
[1:36:38] from the garden they're walking away in
[1:36:40] for the RAM gives the drama of it how
[1:36:41] that the he kills the lamb and the blood
[1:36:44] running down their legs they're walking
[1:36:46] down the garden you can hear the slap of
[1:36:47] the skins so walking out of the garden
[1:36:50] an angel stood there with a bloody sword
[1:36:52] stood there guarding the way fiery sword
[1:36:55] guarding the way the tree of life and
[1:36:58] they couldn't come back in but there had
[1:37:03] to be something in the deed to begin
[1:37:06] with there had to be some covenant that
[1:37:10] would bring them back in
[1:37:12] the rightful position now we would call
[1:37:15] that today reversion clause a lot of old
[1:37:16] churches out in the country are like
[1:37:18] this if they would need a church and
[1:37:20] then they would say as long as they have
[1:37:22] Church in it then its tears but if they
[1:37:25] don't have church anymore it goes back
[1:37:26] to the original owner a lot of old
[1:37:29] churches are like that but the Tim
[1:37:31] Pruitt's Church that he had the old one
[1:37:32] in Louisiana was that way the titles
[1:37:35] that you go back to the original owner
[1:37:36] well after a hundred years who's the
[1:37:39] original owner well they're very very
[1:37:41] hard to find so those churches you can't
[1:37:44] sell them you can't really do anything
[1:37:45] with them it's just there it's just it's
[1:37:48] a legal morass it's just it just doesn't
[1:37:52] there's nothing you can do with it
[1:37:54] because you have to find the original
[1:37:57] owner they still have rights oh oh I
[1:38:00] hope you're listening to me today he
[1:38:02] still had rights because he made them
[1:38:05] and they were not only made by him they
[1:38:07] were his children so he had certain
[1:38:09] rights whether Danny to them to say like
[1:38:12] he has rights to us today people don't
[1:38:14] want to be told what to do but he has
[1:38:16] rights to you he said well I don't want
[1:38:20] to be told how I should wear my dress I
[1:38:21] don't want to be told how I should God
[1:38:23] whether I should cut my hair and I don't
[1:38:24] want to be told how to act among my
[1:38:26] coworkers but he has rights and he was
[1:38:30] served to himself the right of
[1:38:32] redemption now listen he could not trust
[1:38:36] human beings with the title so he come
[1:38:38] down himself very bad amen
[1:38:44] had a person one time left the office
[1:38:46] and lost a payoff on the way to the bank
[1:38:51] they went by the mail saw it first and
[1:38:54] put it down the mail side you couldn't
[1:38:56] trust them that person eventually got
[1:38:58] fired because we just couldn't trust
[1:39:00] them to handle the payoff God couldn't
[1:39:03] trust Adam he couldn't trust Elijah he
[1:39:08] couldn't trust Moses he couldn't trust
[1:39:11] David so he he put the payment you cost
[1:39:16] the payment to be something that he did
[1:39:18] himself he came down himself and people
[1:39:24] did want to believe in two guards
[1:39:26] you know in a lot of it as semantics
[1:39:27] people take things but the red one says
[1:39:28] but but he was God he had to be because
[1:39:32] no one else could make that payment now
[1:39:35] listen if a thing or person ever
[1:39:38] belonged to God it cannot be lost
[1:39:40] must be redeemed and it belonged to him
[1:39:46] for this purpose to be redeemed now Ruth
[1:39:50] chapter 4 and verse 3 I want us to look
[1:39:52] at this really quick and I won't hold
[1:39:54] you as long as you think I'm going to
[1:39:56] this morning because we're just gonna
[1:39:56] stop rich chapter 4 in verse 3 he said
[1:40:03] unto the kinsman Naomi that has come
[1:40:05] again out of the country of Moab sell us
[1:40:06] a parcel of land which was our brother
[1:40:09] elimi Lex and I thought to advertise
[1:40:12] these saying buy it before the
[1:40:14] inhabitants before the elders of my
[1:40:16] people because he he could make a claim
[1:40:18] on it what he's doing he's clearing the
[1:40:20] title now listen what he says buy it
[1:40:25] before the inhabitants before the elders
[1:40:27] if that will redeem it redeem it but if
[1:40:31] thou will not redeem it then tell me
[1:40:33] that I may know for there is none to
[1:40:35] redeem it beside thee and I am after
[1:40:38] thee now notice the nearer kinsman said
[1:40:40] I will redeem it he said I'm gonna make
[1:40:44] a claim and then said Boaz remember if
[1:40:49] you buy the field you get the title to
[1:40:52] the earth if you buy it of Naomi
[1:40:57] you must also buy it of Ruth you can't
[1:41:01] restore it without restoring the
[1:41:04] marriage relationship babe it don't you
[1:41:09] see what he was feeling with Adam and
[1:41:10] Eve if he had put her away it could
[1:41:13] never be restored but he went out with
[1:41:16] her so that he could know that the
[1:41:19] marriage relationship could be restored
[1:41:20] so that the title would be clear hey
[1:41:24] Beth she has rights to it too and he
[1:41:29] said you must also buy it of Ruth the
[1:41:31] wife of the Dead to raise up the name of
[1:41:32] the Dead upon his inheritance and
[1:41:34] kinsmen said I cannot redeem it for
[1:41:35] myself that was the fact that changed
[1:41:38] what changed its the fact you would
[1:41:39] to marry her and he couldn't do that hey
[1:41:43] Ben she was a bride that was meant for
[1:41:46] bow ass
[1:41:47] he couldn't do that because it would Mar
[1:41:50] his inheritance
[1:41:51] I cannot redeem it for myself less time
[1:41:54] on my own inheritance because then her
[1:41:56] children would inherit that property
[1:41:59] you wouldn't do me any good he says
[1:42:02] let's not Mar my own inheritance
[1:42:04] redeemed out my right to thyself for I
[1:42:08] cannot redeem it
[1:42:09] hey brother Brahim tells us now the
[1:42:12] forfeited title deed is now in the hands
[1:42:14] of the original owner Almighty God the
[1:42:16] title deed to the earth and to eternal
[1:42:18] life when Adam forfeited it didn't
[1:42:21] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[1:42:24] it went back to its original owner God
[1:42:26] himself
[1:42:27] hey man he said we're gonna find it just
[1:42:30] in a minute there he sits on the throne
[1:42:33] with it in his hand the title deed Hey
[1:42:38] oh I just I couldn't get past this this
[1:42:43] morning it's the original owner he has
[1:42:46] it in his hand it didn't just get lost
[1:42:51] but Adam lost it when he walked out was
[1:42:53] even didn't just go anywhere Satan tried
[1:42:56] to take it he couldn't take it but win
[1:42:59] back to the original owner it is now in
[1:43:02] the hands of the original owner there he
[1:43:05] sits on the throne with it in his hand
[1:43:06] the title deed but the random claps his
[1:43:08] hands together two times oh that makes
[1:43:10] me feel religious the title deed to
[1:43:11] eternal life abstract title deed to
[1:43:14] eternal life when Adam forfeited it for
[1:43:16] wisdom as to the faith it went back to
[1:43:18] the hands of the owner Almighty God he
[1:43:23] said what a great thing brother Branham
[1:43:31] says Oh hallelujah I hope you Christians
[1:43:34] see it he says we are the salt of the
[1:43:37] earth God gave this to his sons he gave
[1:43:42] us the jurisdiction over all nature all
[1:43:45] animals all life everywhere do you know
[1:43:48] what the coronavirus is it's a life that
[1:43:51] feeds off of a life
[1:43:53] that's right that's what it is it's a
[1:43:55] life form it's a form of life but he
[1:43:57] gave you jurisdiction over all life
[1:43:59] everywhere any bet you give you
[1:44:03] jurisdiction over all life everywhere
[1:44:05] but Adam our fathers forfeited to Satan
[1:44:09] but where does it fall back to the
[1:44:11] rightful owner God who made it hey Ben
[1:44:18] no brother man says that's the reason
[1:44:20] John wept because if no one could get
[1:44:23] that book all creation everything was
[1:44:26] gone if no one could get it all creation
[1:44:30] and everything was gone she would just
[1:44:32] simply turn back to atoms and molecules
[1:44:34] and so forth cosmic line not even be
[1:44:37] creation person nothing else because
[1:44:40] Adam lost the rights to that book he
[1:44:43] forfeited it when he listened to his
[1:44:44] wife and she listened to Satan's
[1:44:46] reasonings instead of the Word of God
[1:44:47] it was forfeited he said then it
[1:44:50] couldn't go back into the dirty hands of
[1:44:53] Satan who tempted her out of the way and
[1:44:58] he didn't go back just for molecules and
[1:45:01] atoms where did he go into the hands of
[1:45:06] the original owner into the hands of the
[1:45:10] original owner he was not an absentee
[1:45:12] owner he was there he watched him walk
[1:45:14] out of the garden and he took the book
[1:45:16] back in his own hands hey man he said
[1:45:19] I'll make it covered at this time that I
[1:45:21] could they can keep amen
[1:45:22] because it's I will not they will look
[1:45:26] he said he couldn't go back he went back
[1:45:28] to its original owner like any abstract
[1:45:30] deed would do he goes right back to his
[1:45:32] original owner that was God the Creator
[1:45:34] who made it and he holds it I'm closing
[1:45:45] think with me for a moment he holds it
[1:45:49] what does that mean he's invested title
[1:45:52] back in himself he holds it so we find
[1:45:56] him sitting on the throne they begin to
[1:45:59] make it advertisement for a redeemer
[1:46:00] we'll get into some of that little Lord
[1:46:02] willing coming up at another time but
[1:46:05] he's sitting there on the throne John
[1:46:08] begins to weep but now with the benefit
[1:46:14] of hindsight we can look at the one who
[1:46:17] holds the book and we can see that even
[1:46:20] at that time it was redeemable because
[1:46:29] like I said if there's a forfeiture of
[1:46:30] title and you can't find the redeemable
[1:46:32] the original order you've got a problem
[1:46:34] but the original owner was not absent
[1:46:39] I'm playing the drum that's what I'm
[1:46:42] preaching the original owner was not
[1:46:44] what's not absent he didn't move off to
[1:46:48] another city go start another planet
[1:46:50] somewhere but he said on the throne what
[1:46:55] does that mean he had still had the
[1:46:56] power still had the authority even
[1:46:59] though Satan tried to claim it even
[1:47:00] though he tried to take it let me tell
[1:47:02] you church or buried people will never
[1:47:04] moved beyond this into redemption
[1:47:06] they've never moved until the land could
[1:47:09] open that book in their own lives and
[1:47:10] take it and make it a part of their own
[1:47:12] lives and they could beat it up they've
[1:47:14] never moved
[1:47:14] but yet he's still in that still in that
[1:47:16] condition it's still in the hands of the
[1:47:18] original owner let me tell you that what
[1:47:20] that means is that that title could
[1:47:22] never go so far that it could not be
[1:47:24] redeemed because when it goes back as
[1:47:27] far as it can go it just goes back into
[1:47:29] the hands of the original owner I hope
[1:47:33] you with me this has given me way too
[1:47:37] much time to study and there was a time
[1:47:48] and there was a moment with a joke when
[1:47:50] I was in his hands not not yet tasted
[1:47:53] redemption I'd not yet seen the opening
[1:47:56] of the word I'm not yet become a part of
[1:47:59] my life but I was still in his hands
[1:48:02] even though he sit there on the throne
[1:48:07] cried out for a redeemer it was still
[1:48:10] even though I didn't know anything about
[1:48:11] it
[1:48:12] it was still on the throne and if you
[1:48:15] can see it listen John saw it on the
[1:48:17] throne he saw the book in the hands of
[1:48:19] him that sat on the throne when he saw
[1:48:20] it he began to weep and when he's began
[1:48:22] to weep because of that closed book in
[1:48:24] the hands of him that sat on the throne
[1:48:25] they said don't weave John what was that
[1:48:28] he began to weep he began to repent he
[1:48:30] began to cry out to God because he knew
[1:48:32] the title would be lost completely he
[1:48:34] began to sense he began to get the sense
[1:48:36] of total failure
[1:48:37] begin to get the sense of how awful this
[1:48:39] was a church and that's the place we
[1:48:42] have to come to sometimes when John saw
[1:48:44] it in the hands he wept when we see it
[1:48:47] in the hands of God it brings repentance
[1:48:50] there are many more pages I thank God
[1:48:54] for that
[1:48:55] we've only went through the first two
[1:48:57] pages the original grant the forfeiture
[1:49:02] but it's back in the hands of him and I
[1:49:08] know these things are in the past but
[1:49:09] I'm preaching it as if it's present
[1:49:10] because they're our people but that's
[1:49:13] all they see God sitting on the throne
[1:49:16] but if you can see that much remember
[1:49:19] you won't lose you sometimes you have to
[1:49:26] get to a point where you're just
[1:49:28] completely sure that you're gonna be
[1:49:31] lost and then get a vision of him
[1:49:35] sitting on the throne if there's one
[1:49:40] thing we don't see today it's that
[1:49:43] repentance remember what he said repent
[1:49:45] and be baptized and you should receive
[1:49:48] the abstract the guarantees repent and
[1:49:52] be baptized and it'll be a finished work
[1:49:54] you've got to repent why do you have to
[1:49:57] repent you've got to be able to see that
[1:50:00] he is in control you've got to be able
[1:50:03] to see that the book is in his hands and
[1:50:05] he's able to do with it
[1:50:07] what he will as we view the book in the
[1:50:10] hands of God we know Redemption it's
[1:50:13] possible somehow I don't do it
[1:50:16] I don't know understand how I don't know
[1:50:19] how but somehow he'll do it for our
[1:50:23] children sometimes we look and we see
[1:50:24] they've not come to a lamb they don't
[1:50:26] know they don't obey the Word of God
[1:50:28] they don't come to the house of God for
[1:50:30] maybe for people that you know you know
[1:50:31] that maybe once they serve God they
[1:50:33] don't serve God anymore and it seems as
[1:50:35] if just that book is closed and it seems
[1:50:37] as if it's back benefits in the hands of
[1:50:39] the original owner all those that are
[1:50:40] hairs will come to him so we don't have
[1:50:44] to be afraid today we don't have to be
[1:50:46] frightened as if we'll be lost but we
[1:50:48] can say because I see it in the hands of
[1:50:50] the original owner and I went beyond
[1:50:52] that I've seen the lamb come and I've
[1:50:54] seen him take the book and I've seen him
[1:50:56] actually come down and I've seen the
[1:50:59] book opened and handed to me and I hate
[1:51:01] it and when I did hate it I eat it I
[1:51:02] felt the effects of it and when I did
[1:51:04] that all the sudden I realized that when
[1:51:07] it was in his hands I was in his hands
[1:51:09] you don't have to worry but you do after
[1:51:15] a bed rest in his hands
[1:51:19] bow our heads together I just stopped
[1:51:25] there I started to I started to add more
[1:51:31] scriptures and try to complete it and
[1:51:33] take it farther and I just felt the
[1:51:36] unction of the Holy Spirit to stop he
[1:51:39] has it in his hands maybe that's where
[1:51:42] you're at today maybe sitting here I
[1:51:45] don't know maybe watching I know we're a
[1:51:50] small church but maybe to you it's just
[1:51:54] never really been opened the way that it
[1:51:56] should
[1:51:57] could you just see him sitting there
[1:52:00] today
[1:52:02] seems sitting on the throne
[1:52:08] recognize that you can be redeemed don't
[1:52:14] fall into the pit of Satan we said well
[1:52:18] it's okay you can just do what you want
[1:52:19] to don't fall into the Hat
[1:52:21] don't let the serpent give you legal
[1:52:24] advice well I could just do what I want
[1:52:26] I'll just go to church and I'll be fine
[1:52:28] but no you got to be saved
[1:52:30] you got to be born again you have to
[1:52:32] repent before you can receive the
[1:52:35] abstract if we feel his presence here
[1:52:40] today if you just in that situation
[1:52:43] maybe at times you feel like you've lost
[1:52:44] your vision of the redemption that's
[1:52:47] taking place in our hour the redemption
[1:52:49] that took place on the cross the
[1:52:50] finished work if you've lost that vision
[1:52:54] of that you can just see him on his
[1:52:57] throne today you can begin to see he is
[1:53:00] a redeemer you will not lose those
[1:53:03] things that are his it takes faith to
[1:53:06] believe God and to repent you'll never
[1:53:08] repent without faith if you can't
[1:53:10] believe things that seem impossible to
[1:53:12] believe
[1:53:13] you'll never repent but if you can
[1:53:15] believe and just say Lord I believe
[1:53:17] somehow I believe the trauma had thrown
[1:53:19] I don't know exactly I can't give it the
[1:53:21] incidence but I believe you're on that
[1:53:23] throne today I may have failed I may not
[1:53:26] all kinds of things but you're still on
[1:53:27] the throne and now I have an
[1:53:29] intercession I have a lamb interceding
[1:53:32] for me now I have one who can take the
[1:53:36] book and who can provide it as an open
[1:53:38] book in my name Heavenly Father
[1:53:42] if there's one listening for myself lord
[1:53:47] help me Lord so many times as a
[1:53:50] Christian we want to see that open book
[1:53:52] we want to see the lamb and that's
[1:53:53] wonderful we have to see that but we
[1:53:56] first must see that it's in your hands
[1:53:59] but if we've done something that's wrong
[1:54:01] lord help us to repent quickly help us
[1:54:04] not to wait for hours and days and
[1:54:06] months years
[1:54:07] help us to repent Lord God if there's
[1:54:11] something I make mistakes every day I'm
[1:54:14] so glad for the mediator so glad for the
[1:54:17] lamb if there wasn't a lamb where would
[1:54:21] we be but maybe there's someone
[1:54:23] listening today he's got a loss that
[1:54:26] sister fellowship Oh God would you just
[1:54:29] help him to see that you're still on the
[1:54:31] throne they may not understand
[1:54:32] everything but there's an open book
[1:54:34] waiting for them if they're just willing
[1:54:36] to receive it they'll just repent that's
[1:54:39] the first step I'm sorry maybe you need
[1:54:42] to say it to your wife maybe you said to
[1:54:43] your husband maybe you need to say it to
[1:54:45] the church maybe you need to say to your

[2:03:15] contagious something I do every year but
[2:03:18] but just have to deal with that and you
[2:03:20] know but God has a way of working us
