[50:40] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[50:43] trouble you and thereby many
[50:46] be defiled i'd like to speak to you
[50:48] this morning on poison fruit from bitter
[50:51] roots
[50:52] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[50:54] to the word you may be seated
[51:00] every fruit comes from a plant
[51:02] a tree or a vine
[51:05] and every plant has a root a root is
[51:08] that part of a plant or a tree that
[51:10] receives water and nutrients from the
[51:13] soil in the new testament it's used as a
[51:16] metaphor or a parable and it primarily
[51:19] has a symbol of origin including
[51:21] spiritual and genealogical
[51:24] origins when
[51:26] john the baptist came out
[51:28] of the wilderness and he began to preach
[51:30] to that generation of pharisees that was
[51:33] there at that time he began to preach to
[51:36] them and he realized that the fruit that
[51:39] was coming out of their life was not
[51:42] what it should be it did not match what
[51:44] the word
[51:45] was or what the light was for that hour
[51:48] and so he comes out preaching if you can
[51:50] imagine what it must have been what it
[51:52] must have seemed like to the generation
[51:54] he was preaching to here was a 30 year
[51:57] old preacher that come out of the
[51:59] wilderness he was eating locust and wild
[52:02] honey he was dressed in camel's hair and
[52:05] and he had the spirit though and the
[52:07] power of elijah on him
[52:09] right and we've seen that in our day but
[52:11] here was a man who didn't fit in with
[52:13] the organization of the day and he was
[52:16] standing there preaching to these elders
[52:18] to men with gray hair men who had stood
[52:22] there
[52:22] for
[52:23] decade after decade and cared for god's
[52:26] people and they thought they were the
[52:28] the utmost of the jewish religion they
[52:31] thought that they kept all the law just
[52:33] exactly like it was supposed to be but
[52:35] the truth is in their legalism they had
[52:38] actually turned away from god and by
[52:40] their tradition they'd made the word of
[52:42] god of none effect
[52:45] and here comes a 30 year old preacher
[52:47] out of the wilderness and he comes
[52:49] preaching and he comes to him and they
[52:51] come to be baptized of him because it
[52:53] was the popular thing to do in that day
[52:55] and he said if you come for repentance
[52:57] bring fruits worthy of repentance
[53:01] show some fruit worthy of repentance if
[53:04] you come for repentance he was seeing
[53:07] the wrong fruits
[53:08] among an older generation and it must
[53:10] have they must have said well this man
[53:11] has no respect for for his elders this
[53:14] man but the word is always the word
[53:17] and it's always true no matter who says
[53:20] it no matter who we need we've got to
[53:22] separate that in our day we you quit
[53:24] looking at the man that's saying him but
[53:26] is the word the truth we believe that it
[53:28] is
[53:29] we don't look at god calling a kentucky
[53:32] hillbilly in this age and say well he
[53:33] didn't have good grammar he didn't do
[53:35] all of these things that the world
[53:36] thought he should do we don't look at
[53:38] the man you've got to be able to look
[53:39] past that and see that god was speaking
[53:42] to this generation
[53:44] just like he did with john the baptist
[53:46] but then john the baptist say he was
[53:48] he was actually
[53:50] he was turning the hearts
[53:52] of the fathers to the children
[53:55] that's what he was doing now in our day
[53:57] he was called brother animals called to
[53:59] turn the hearts of the children back to
[54:01] the pentecostal fathers
[54:03] but in that day he was turning the
[54:05] hearts of the fathers to the children
[54:07] and so there he stood preaching his
[54:09] message
[54:10] to men who had been pastors and leaders
[54:13] for decades
[54:15] but they were wrong
[54:19] don't ever get hung up on the flesh
[54:21] don't ever put too much confidence in a
[54:23] man
[54:26] what we need to do is look at the fruit
[54:29] what what is the teaching what's the
[54:31] result of the teaching what what is
[54:33] bring what is coming out
[54:35] in matthew 3 and 8 john stands there and
[54:38] he says bring forth therefore fruits
[54:40] meet
[54:41] for repentance
[54:42] and think not to say within yourselves
[54:45] we have abraham to our father notice
[54:47] they would go back to their origin
[54:50] we have roots we have roots we can go
[54:53] back and we can see that we were
[54:54] identified with with moses we were
[54:56] identified with moses teaching we're
[54:59] identified with the quotes and the
[55:01] and the books and the tapes and all
[55:02] those things that's wonderful
[55:04] that they were but they but they could
[55:06] not see that god was doing something
[55:08] that there was a light that was moving
[55:10] in their hour and so he begins to say
[55:12] don't think we have abraham to our
[55:14] father i say unto you that god is able
[55:17] of these stones to raise up children
[55:18] unto abraham and sometimes the way we do
[55:20] that today well i'm a message believer i
[55:23] go to brother ben pruitt's church or i
[55:24] go to some other church in the message
[55:26] and i go to word of life tabernacle
[55:28] maybe your identity was with a church
[55:30] name it's good that we have a good
[55:31] church and a good church name but that's
[55:34] not what our identity is with we our
[55:36] identity needs to be with the word
[55:38] we go to church not because we love the
[55:40] church but because we love god
[55:44] right
[55:45] and that'll make us love one another
[55:48] amen now
[55:50] the acts he said now also
[55:53] the ax is laid
[55:55] unto the root
[55:58] not to the fruit
[56:00] john's not standing there
[56:02] trying to reform the pharisees
[56:05] and this is important this morning as uh
[56:07] maybe it's a little bit different than
[56:09] what we dealt with wednesday night or
[56:11] even last sunday
[56:12] but i think this will be important to us
[56:15] to understand in our own lives
[56:16] individually and i'm not preaching to
[56:18] anybody else this morning but just to
[56:20] each one of us individually and to
[56:22] myself
[56:24] we need to deal with things from the
[56:25] root
[56:28] not go on the fruit we can inspect the
[56:30] fruit but if you take the fruit off
[56:33] if you if you remove the poisoned fruit
[56:36] that root will grow another one
[56:39] right you can even cut down the tree
[56:41] it'll come back up
[56:43] but you've got to get rid of the root
[56:46] and if you can ever get rid of the root
[56:48] and burn it
[56:49] it won't ever come back
[56:51] now watch the ax is not laid to the
[56:55] symptoms
[56:56] but the axe is laid to the cause
[57:00] he says your root is bad
[57:02] so if you look at it in the sense of the
[57:05] way we would understand bitterness today
[57:07] you know in the old testament bitterness
[57:09] was idolatry in the new testament
[57:12] speaking of bitterness false doctrine
[57:14] that would come in or someone with false
[57:16] doctrine coming in but it's poison
[57:18] it's poison and the way we understand
[57:21] bitterness today it's a bitterness of
[57:23] spirit
[57:24] a bitterness of uh
[57:26] of getting to a point where uh you uh
[57:29] you can't be around some people or you
[57:32] have you have an issue with certain
[57:34] people there's things in your life
[57:36] you're bitter about
[57:38] and and and so now as you begin to look
[57:40] at that and begin to realize that
[57:42] you can't just con
[57:44] deal with that
[57:45] by pulling away from those people
[57:49] if the problem is well i'm i'm bitter so
[57:52] i'm going to quit fellowshipping with
[57:53] this church or i'm bitter so i'm going
[57:55] to leave church and just sit out by
[57:56] myself that's not going to deal with the
[57:58] problem
[58:00] i'm bitter so i'm going to
[58:02] i'm going to do away with this family
[58:04] member i'm going to quit being around no
[58:06] more i'm going to quit being around this
[58:08] person that doesn't deal with the
[58:10] problem some people even leave the
[58:11] message entirely
[58:13] out of bitterness
[58:15] and the truth is they have a reason
[58:19] yeah there's a reason and many times
[58:21] it's even a good reason
[58:24] but yet they that reason becomes an
[58:26] excuse
[58:29] right because even just because it's a
[58:31] good reason doesn't give you a right to
[58:33] go against the
[58:34] word right but many people i understand
[58:37] why some people don't want to go to
[58:39] church
[58:40] because they've been hurt in church
[58:42] and all that they associate church with
[58:44] is a man dogmatically bringing out
[58:47] something and beating them over the head
[58:48] with something or or telling them
[58:50] everything to do in their lives and
[58:53] becoming some sort of a ruler or a king
[58:55] that's not what a pastor is that's not
[58:57] what a preacher should be
[58:59] our job is to preach the word
[59:02] i can't make you live it but i can
[59:04] preach it
[59:05] right and my job is to preach the word
[59:07] and then you got to go live it
[59:09] right i've got to go live it
[59:12] so the pastor is not above the people in
[59:13] that way but people say well i've been
[59:15] hurt i've been in a bad church situation
[59:18] my past you don't understand what i
[59:20] meant i'm struggling with this and so
[59:22] now i'm bitter and so i'm going to move
[59:23] away but you're dealing with the fruit
[59:26] not the roots
[59:28] at some point you need to take care of
[59:29] the problem
[59:31] the bitterness itself needs to go you
[59:34] need to let go of the issue itself
[59:37] say not my will but time be done lord
[59:41] this root can only be dealt with by the
[59:43] fire of the holy ghost
[59:46] you're not going to be able to make 12
[59:48] steps to get it out
[59:50] you're not going to be able to reform it
[59:52] you're not going to be able to take it
[59:54] through and
[59:55] through a process of saying well i you
[59:57] know i'm i'm better now than i was and
[1:00:00] i'm better tomorrow than i am was
[1:00:02] yesterday no it needs to be dealt with
[1:00:04] by the fire of the holy ghost and then
[1:00:05] you can begin to heal
[1:00:07] right then you can begin to heal then
[1:00:09] you can begin to make things right but
[1:00:11] first the root has to be dealt with
[1:00:14] you can't use psychology alone to take
[1:00:16] that out psychology may identify what's
[1:00:18] wrong
[1:00:20] but it can't fix it
[1:00:22] and so it begins to make excuses for it
[1:00:24] and that's when it begins to be
[1:00:25] dangerous
[1:00:27] matthew 3 and 11.
[1:00:29] it john continues on now notice where he
[1:00:31] takes this the axe is laid to the root
[1:00:34] to the root of the tree he said it and
[1:00:36] every tree that brings not forth good
[1:00:37] fruit is tuned down cast into the fire
[1:00:40] and then he goes on i indeed baptize you
[1:00:42] with water into repentance but he that
[1:00:44] cometh after me is mightier than i whose
[1:00:46] shoes i'm not worthy to bear he shall
[1:00:48] baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:00:51] and with fire whose fan is in his hand
[1:00:53] and he will thoroughly purge his floor
[1:00:56] and gather his wheat into the garner but
[1:00:58] he will burn up the chaff with
[1:00:59] unquenchable
[1:01:01] fire
[1:01:02] the problem was with the root now their
[1:01:04] particular problem
[1:01:05] was that they were children of the devil
[1:01:10] there's not much taking you can do about
[1:01:12] that you are what you are
[1:01:14] but i believe that you're children of
[1:01:15] god today
[1:01:17] i believe that you are and then you have
[1:01:19] to believe that so if i'm a child of god
[1:01:22] then the root problem is not my origin
[1:01:25] but it's the origin of this bitterness
[1:01:28] which may have been something that
[1:01:29] happened to me or something that went on
[1:01:31] in my life
[1:01:32] so now
[1:01:33] he says but that that's got to be dealt
[1:01:35] with by the fire of the holy ghost
[1:01:36] you've got to become a new creation in
[1:01:38] christ a new creature in christ in order
[1:01:41] for you to ever get rid of that
[1:01:43] bitterness and that root of bitterness
[1:01:45] that springs up otherwise you're going
[1:01:47] to keep running if you've fallen for a
[1:01:49] cult in the past
[1:01:51] and that you didn't get rid of the root
[1:01:53] of what caused you to fall for that
[1:01:55] you'll fall again in the future
[1:01:58] and that's why people go from one uh
[1:02:00] doctrine off the word to another
[1:02:01] doctrine off the word
[1:02:03] right and and they just go pin like a
[1:02:06] pinball machine back and forth because
[1:02:08] the thing is you've never dealt with the
[1:02:10] route
[1:02:11] if you
[1:02:12] if you have a problem with uh with
[1:02:15] people and people have hurt you if you
[1:02:17] don't get rid of that route somebody
[1:02:19] else is going to do it and somebody else
[1:02:20] is going to do it and you can't just
[1:02:22] keep cutting off people
[1:02:24] eventually you'll die lonely and alone
[1:02:26] and no one will be there and it will be
[1:02:28] your fault
[1:02:32] are you hearing me this morning because
[1:02:33] every hand that tried to help you you
[1:02:34] bid it
[1:02:36] everyone that tried to reach out to you
[1:02:38] a pastor tried to reach out to you but
[1:02:40] you'd had a bad pastor so you wouldn't
[1:02:41] listen
[1:02:42] a son tried to reach out to you but you
[1:02:44] wouldn't listen because he's too young a
[1:02:46] daughter tried to reach out to you but
[1:02:48] you wouldn't listen a family member
[1:02:50] tried to reach out to you but that
[1:02:51] bitterness is not dealt with and because
[1:02:53] it's not deal with eventually you end up
[1:02:55] all by yourself but if you let the holy
[1:02:57] spirit go down like a fire inside of you
[1:03:00] and burn that thing out of you
[1:03:03] then you can begin to repair those
[1:03:05] relationships
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] now so if the root of something can be
[1:03:13] found it can be dealt with look at mark
[1:03:17] chapter 11 mark chapter 11 and verse 12
[1:03:21] it says on the morrow when they were
[1:03:22] come from bethany he was hungry
[1:03:24] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[1:03:27] leaves
[1:03:28] he came if happily he might find
[1:03:29] anything thereon and when he came to it
[1:03:31] he found nothing but leaves
[1:03:33] for the time of figs was not yet
[1:03:36] and jesus answered and said unto it no
[1:03:38] man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever
[1:03:41] and his disciples
[1:03:43] heard it
[1:03:44] now they go into jerusalem and come back
[1:03:46] the next day in mark chapter 11 verse 20
[1:03:49] it says in the morning as they passed by
[1:03:52] they saw the fig tree dried up
[1:03:55] from the roots
[1:03:57] from the roots
[1:03:59] now brother brandon picks up the story
[1:04:01] he said peter said look at that tree
[1:04:03] it's dead from the roots up
[1:04:06] why jesus rebuked the life that was in
[1:04:10] that tree that was in the roots and the
[1:04:13] whole thing died
[1:04:15] and brother branham says hallelujah
[1:04:17] that same christ
[1:04:19] oh i'm glad we still serve that same god
[1:04:21] today
[1:04:22] that same christ can rebuke a cancer
[1:04:25] from the roots
[1:04:28] glory to god
[1:04:29] can rebuke a cancer from the roots and
[1:04:31] the whole thing will die
[1:04:33] he said that tree was standing there
[1:04:35] just the same as it was hours before but
[1:04:38] you find the leaves begin to drop off
[1:04:39] then see the bark begin to peel off why
[1:04:42] he rebuked the roots
[1:04:44] oh god he said it began to wear away day
[1:04:47] after day and week after week after a
[1:04:49] while there wasn't even one speck of
[1:04:50] that tree left
[1:04:51] he said cancer tumor cataract or
[1:04:54] anything else will have to go when
[1:04:56] christ speaks do we believe that this
[1:04:58] morning
[1:05:00] so whatever it is whether it's sickness
[1:05:01] whether it's sin whether it's a
[1:05:04] spiritual wound
[1:05:06] see we get wounded in our spirit just
[1:05:08] like we do
[1:05:09] in in our flesh
[1:05:12] if it's a spiritual wound you're not
[1:05:14] going to deal with it by babying it
[1:05:19] and paul spoke to the galatians like
[1:05:20] that i believe it was the galatians he
[1:05:22] said have i become your enemy by telling
[1:05:23] you the truth
[1:05:27] and many times we don't want to hear the
[1:05:29] truth
[1:05:31] and so we just shut it out
[1:05:33] and brother madam tells a story about a
[1:05:35] prospector that went to get some gold
[1:05:37] and he finds the gold and he's going to
[1:05:39] be rich the rest of his life he got a
[1:05:41] faithful old dog y'all remember the
[1:05:43] story got a faithful old dog and the old
[1:05:46] dog is
[1:05:47] is warning him one night he went to bed
[1:05:49] thinking of dreaming about all these
[1:05:51] things and the dog just keeps barking
[1:05:52] keeps barking because there's some
[1:05:54] outlaws out there that want to take that
[1:05:55] gold
[1:05:57] but he's too busy thinking about what
[1:05:58] he's going to do and finally he gets so
[1:06:00] tired of that dog he said oh i don't
[1:06:02] need you no more my prospecting days are
[1:06:05] over i'm going to be a rich man so he
[1:06:06] walks out there and takes a gun and
[1:06:08] shoots the dog
[1:06:11] and killed the only thing that would
[1:06:12] keep him alive
[1:06:15] instead of heeding the warning and
[1:06:16] wondering why was he barking he actually
[1:06:19] shoots the very messenger
[1:06:21] that would have kept him alive oh god
[1:06:23] how many times have we done that instead
[1:06:25] of dealing with the problem we're just
[1:06:27] going to shoot the messenger
[1:06:29] and pretty soon you don't have
[1:06:30] relationships with anybody in your
[1:06:32] family
[1:06:33] anybody in the church
[1:06:35] any other preachers
[1:06:38] he said preachers do this absolutely
[1:06:40] i've seen it
[1:06:42] god help me never to be that way
[1:06:45] but we all have that potential
[1:06:47] because we are woundable in our spirits
[1:06:51] we think we're not but we are
[1:06:55] are you hear me we've learned
[1:06:57] that we're woundable in the flesh
[1:06:59] that's even a word
[1:07:01] we've learned that we we have the
[1:07:02] ability to be wounded you learn that
[1:07:04] when you're a kid you wouldn't touch the
[1:07:06] hot stove
[1:07:08] i told my wife because kids were always
[1:07:10] doing something like that and i told
[1:07:11] them i said well if they do it once they
[1:07:12] won't do it again
[1:07:15] you try to keep your kids from that but
[1:07:16] they got to learn at some point whether
[1:07:18] it's by slapping their hand or something
[1:07:20] there's got to be some some pain
[1:07:21] associated with that or they'll keep
[1:07:23] doing it because they don't know that
[1:07:25] they're woundable
[1:07:27] they don't know they just they'll just
[1:07:28] run jump off a building until they
[1:07:30] realize
[1:07:32] that it'll hurt
[1:07:34] oh my
[1:07:35] and the older you get the more woundable
[1:07:37] you get you realize your spirit is the
[1:07:39] same way
[1:07:42] when you're young now think about it as
[1:07:45] a
[1:07:45] as a young person
[1:07:47] and i'm not just preaching to our elders
[1:07:49] today but if you are an elder today you
[1:07:51] need to listen
[1:07:53] because here you might be i've been in
[1:07:55] the message for decades and and you say
[1:07:57] well i know what i believe i know where
[1:07:58] i stand but you're still woundable in
[1:08:01] your spirit
[1:08:02] and maybe more so now that you're older
[1:08:04] than when you were young
[1:08:06] because you take a young person a child
[1:08:08] that child can have a fight a knock down
[1:08:12] drag out
[1:08:13] with another child you give them both a
[1:08:16] weapon five minutes later they're right
[1:08:18] back there
[1:08:20] playing one with one another again
[1:08:23] most of the time
[1:08:26] right now you take you take your
[1:08:28] children when you have to give them a
[1:08:29] spanking i know that's a dirty word
[1:08:31] today but sometimes we have to spank our
[1:08:33] children
[1:08:34] at least some of us do
[1:08:36] and when we have to spank our children
[1:08:38] many times
[1:08:39] in doing that it you know again
[1:08:42] it's child abuse if you do it in anger
[1:08:45] right so we don't do it in anger
[1:08:47] right but you do it according to the
[1:08:49] word
[1:08:49] you follow the word and so but when you
[1:08:52] have to deal with your children in that
[1:08:53] way what does your child do
[1:08:57] if you go up to them afterwards now when
[1:08:59] they're older they won't do this
[1:09:01] but when they're little
[1:09:03] they come and give you a big hug
[1:09:07] and you'll sit there after a a whooping
[1:09:10] hugging one another and it's so sweet
[1:09:12] and so precious why that spirit recovers
[1:09:16] quickly
[1:09:18] right the wounded spirit of a child
[1:09:20] recovers quickly the wounded spirit of
[1:09:22] an adult recovers less quickly
[1:09:24] and the wounded spirit that recovers the
[1:09:27] worst or the slowest is the oldest many
[1:09:30] times that you get to a point where
[1:09:31] you're covered or maybe i shouldn't say
[1:09:33] the oldest but the one that's been
[1:09:34] through the most
[1:09:36] because you're covered in scars you're
[1:09:38] covered in in callous as your spirit is
[1:09:42] you realize it and so and so you keep
[1:09:44] everything out and you hold yourself in
[1:09:45] a certain position but you you have to
[1:09:48] be vulnerable at some point in order to
[1:09:49] ever feel loved
[1:09:51] you have to be vulnerable at some point
[1:09:53] in order to ever feel special
[1:09:55] you want to i don't ever feel special
[1:09:57] because you never allow yourself to be
[1:09:58] vulnerable
[1:10:01] oh god i don't know who i'm speaking to
[1:10:03] today this isn't all in my notes but i
[1:10:04] hope that i hope that we can grab a hold
[1:10:06] of it
[1:10:07] many times
[1:10:09] as a preacher gets older
[1:10:12] he gets wounded
[1:10:14] and it's not his fault people did it to
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:18] but brother branham went through that
[1:10:20] he said i got to where i'm so tired of
[1:10:22] him doing the same thing year after year
[1:10:23] and i come and preach it and he wanted
[1:10:25] to go out in the wilderness and god told
[1:10:27] me that you're not that kind of a
[1:10:28] prophet you've got a higher ministry
[1:10:31] than that
[1:10:33] you've got to be among the people do the
[1:10:34] work of an evangelist
[1:10:36] right and but he even dealt with that he
[1:10:39] said i lost the love for the people like
[1:10:41] moses did
[1:10:43] we all deal with that
[1:10:44] as you get more and more wounded there's
[1:10:47] more and more the opportunity to say
[1:10:49] well
[1:10:50] you know they did it to me i can do it
[1:10:51] back
[1:10:52] but that's not the spirit of christ
[1:10:55] what is that that bitterness that that
[1:10:57] root begins to grow maybe it's caused by
[1:10:59] something there's always a cause but
[1:11:01] then that root it begins to grow and
[1:11:03] begins to grow and every once while it
[1:11:04] springs up and we cut it down and it
[1:11:06] springs up but you need to deal with the
[1:11:07] root of it
[1:11:10] and so we treat the symptoms but as we
[1:11:12] get older it just gets worse
[1:11:16] you get stronger in the faith
[1:11:18] you're also less pliable
[1:11:21] so you've got to watch that
[1:11:23] because you've lived a good life you
[1:11:25] know you stood for the gospel you know
[1:11:27] you've had victories
[1:11:29] and the devil will use that against you
[1:11:32] because someone will come and tell you
[1:11:33] the truth maybe it'll be your son or
[1:11:35] your daughter or someone else
[1:11:38] someone will come and tell you the truth
[1:11:40] and you won't listen to it
[1:11:43] because you're too wounded
[1:11:45] and you're too in your shell
[1:11:48] you can't allow anything to come in
[1:11:50] i pray this morning that we would just
[1:11:52] let the holy spirit just begin to dig
[1:11:54] where he wants to be
[1:11:56] let the word begin to dig we could be
[1:11:58] like that child we may get a spanking in
[1:12:00] church we we may get dealt with one side
[1:12:02] and the other we listening to a tape or
[1:12:04] reading our bibles it may just deal with
[1:12:06] us but we say lord come in deal with us
[1:12:08] and then i'll love you i'll worship you
[1:12:11] afterwards after i get my toes stepped
[1:12:13] on after i get all black and blue i will
[1:12:16] raise my hands and i say lord i know you
[1:12:18] did it for my good
[1:12:20] amen i know all things work together for
[1:12:23] good to them that love god
[1:12:25] oh my
[1:12:27] so now we're dealing with sicknesses of
[1:12:29] the spirit and too often we treat the
[1:12:31] symptoms
[1:12:32] another vacation
[1:12:34] more fun there's nothing wrong with
[1:12:35] vacation nothing wrong with fun
[1:12:37] but sometimes we're trying to treat the
[1:12:39] bitterness or the
[1:12:41] or the depression
[1:12:43] or whatever wound that's going on in our
[1:12:44] spirit with something
[1:12:46] on the outside we're treating symptoms
[1:12:48] and it may help for a while
[1:12:51] but it doesn't deal with the cause
[1:12:54] a new car
[1:12:55] a better house
[1:12:57] a new wife
[1:12:59] a new husband
[1:13:01] a new church
[1:13:05] i'm gonna have to run after this one
[1:13:09] and see folks changing the channel right
[1:13:10] now you know turning that
[1:13:14] caught you didn't i know
[1:13:18] no
[1:13:19] you know
[1:13:20] we want to deal with the symptoms
[1:13:23] when the poison fruit springs up we say
[1:13:26] oh well i i just need some time for
[1:13:28] myself
[1:13:30] i need some me time i hear so much of
[1:13:32] that today and there are times again
[1:13:34] when these things help are you with me
[1:13:36] there's times when it helps
[1:13:39] but what you need is to get rid of the
[1:13:40] root
[1:13:43] not the root in someone else the root in
[1:13:46] you
[1:13:48] and so a lot of times when a pastor gets
[1:13:50] hurt i'm saying this so that you'll know
[1:13:52] if it happens to me you'll know how to
[1:13:53] deal with me right
[1:13:55] but a lot of times when a pastor gets
[1:13:57] hurt what he does he tries to dig the
[1:13:58] roots out of the people
[1:14:01] he's bitter in his own spirit and so he
[1:14:03] begins to dig at the people and that's
[1:14:05] not what we're called to do
[1:14:07] it's my job to take the grubbing hole of
[1:14:09] the word and dig those roots out
[1:14:11] right but i can't do that when i'm
[1:14:14] myself i need the roots dug out
[1:14:17] i can't help you with the speck in your
[1:14:19] eye if there's a log in mine
[1:14:22] are you with me i'm just being honest
[1:14:24] with you this morning
[1:14:25] and so i've got to get out of my
[1:14:27] bitterness of spirit and come out of
[1:14:29] that situation myself look how
[1:14:31] vulnerable and how honest brother
[1:14:32] branham is with the people and standing
[1:14:34] in the gap and some of those sermons
[1:14:36] that he preached where he talked about
[1:14:37] leaving the field and all those things
[1:14:39] he's so honest and vulnerable with the
[1:14:41] people because he wants to be sincere he
[1:14:43] wants to be right with god and if god
[1:14:45] could call the prophet of this day to
[1:14:47] that how much more will he call us to
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:51] let me be vulnerable let me let me stand
[1:14:53] before the people and say i want to make
[1:14:55] sure my heart is right
[1:14:57] or i don't want to preach
[1:15:00] are you with me today
[1:15:01] i can do way more harm than hurt
[1:15:05] but we deal with the symptoms i'll just
[1:15:07] get rid of all the people in the church
[1:15:09] that disagree with me
[1:15:10] after a while it's just you
[1:15:12] and two or three other people
[1:15:18] you say well i
[1:15:20] i'll deal with my sons and my daughters
[1:15:22] and my children and my parents
[1:15:24] then i'll be happy then no we need to
[1:15:27] deal with the root
[1:15:28] in us
[1:15:31] brother branham
[1:15:32] talks about this he said someone said
[1:15:34] brother roberts brother branham will
[1:15:35] pray for 500 while you pray for three
[1:15:37] that's right certainly he'll get twice
[1:15:39] the testimony certainly
[1:15:40] 50 times the testimonies
[1:15:43] he said because you'll after all it's
[1:15:44] based upon the faith of the individuals
[1:15:46] being prayed for
[1:15:48] but the ones that fails in there
[1:15:50] then they come over to the meeting
[1:15:52] he said if a doctor i love that the ones
[1:15:55] that oral roberts they failed at oral
[1:15:57] roberts meeting to get their healing
[1:15:58] right they come over to brother
[1:16:00] branham's he said if a doctor you go to
[1:16:02] a doctor's office and say i'm sick of my
[1:16:04] stomach and got a headache and so forth
[1:16:06] and that doctor just writes you out a
[1:16:07] little prescription of aspirin or a
[1:16:09] tranquilizer or something he's never
[1:16:11] diagnosed that case
[1:16:13] he's just trying to get you out of the
[1:16:15] office
[1:16:16] he said now if he's got you on his heart
[1:16:18] oh that's what we need today doctors
[1:16:20] with the people on their heart preachers
[1:16:22] with the people on their heart
[1:16:24] are you with me now he's trying to get
[1:16:26] you out of the office but if he's got
[1:16:28] you upon his heart and he's interested
[1:16:29] he'll diagnose that case until he finds
[1:16:31] the cause
[1:16:33] you know what he has to do to get that
[1:16:35] diagnosed he has to talk to you
[1:16:38] the one thing i can't handle is a doctor
[1:16:40] that won't talk to me
[1:16:42] he's too busy
[1:16:44] because i don't know what the problem is
[1:16:47] but he's taught he'll know if he'll talk
[1:16:49] to me long enough to understand
[1:16:52] but many times they miss stuff because
[1:16:54] they won't talk
[1:16:57] but harvey and i have talked about this
[1:16:58] where communication is so important and
[1:17:00] it doesn't come naturally to me but
[1:17:02] we've got to communicate with one
[1:17:03] another
[1:17:04] i would love to be able to just retreat
[1:17:06] into my shell and just study the word
[1:17:08] and come out here and preach but we've
[1:17:09] got to communicate with one another or
[1:17:11] we're never going to be able to deal
[1:17:13] with these roots that come up
[1:17:16] right so you've got to get back to the
[1:17:18] cost now i can't do that like brother
[1:17:20] branham did because i'm not a prophet
[1:17:22] i can talk to you but i don't know but
[1:17:25] the word is still a discerner of the
[1:17:27] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:31] so now
[1:17:32] i can tell you the word now watch
[1:17:35] and
[1:17:36] brother brandon said when a man is sick
[1:17:37] or a woman and something has happened
[1:17:40] there's only one way to correctly get
[1:17:42] that that's go back and find the cause
[1:17:44] go back till we see what they've done in
[1:17:46] the meetings he said watch them stand on
[1:17:48] the platform
[1:17:49] the holy spirit say 10 years ago you was
[1:17:50] at a certain place and you've done a
[1:17:52] certain thing
[1:17:53] you did this and certainly you've heard
[1:17:54] it many of you in the meetings you did
[1:17:56] that you've got to make that right first
[1:17:58] he said and then if they promise to do
[1:17:59] it then you'll hear it come forth
[1:18:01] let's say it the lord
[1:18:03] he said mark it in your books did you
[1:18:04] ever see it fail the congregation says
[1:18:06] no
[1:18:07] he said certainly not it doesn't it
[1:18:08] can't what is it see the first thing you
[1:18:10] got to find the cause before you can
[1:18:12] produce the cure you've got to find the
[1:18:14] reason for it and now today he said
[1:18:16] we're trying to educate people to do
[1:18:18] that
[1:18:20] john the baptist didn't say go get more
[1:18:22] education and come back with fruits he
[1:18:24] didn't say that he said the axe is laid
[1:18:27] to the root of the tree
[1:18:29] right and there's one coming will
[1:18:30] baptize you with fire it'll take care of
[1:18:32] that root
[1:18:34] that's what you do with roots by the way
[1:18:35] you grub them out of the ground you take
[1:18:37] them put them in a pile and burn them
[1:18:41] and so now he said you've got to find
[1:18:43] the cause before you can find the cure
[1:18:45] and we're trying to educate people to
[1:18:46] that to the scientific approach to god
[1:18:48] you can't do that god is known not by
[1:18:50] science but by faith we know god now let
[1:18:54] me use an example can i take a little
[1:18:55] bit of time this morning i i know we got
[1:18:58] one service today so i won't i won't
[1:19:00] take hours and hours but just long
[1:19:01] enough to try to get through this this
[1:19:02] morning i appreciate your patience
[1:19:05] now but the random deals with
[1:19:07] nervousness if you've ever listened to
[1:19:09] very many of the tapes you'll find that
[1:19:11] nervousness over and over again in fact
[1:19:13] he said in some of his meetings he said
[1:19:14] 80 of the people were dealing with the
[1:19:17] same problem
[1:19:19] nervousness
[1:19:20] but now we have to be careful when
[1:19:22] diagnosing people we love to diagnose
[1:19:24] people don't we
[1:19:26] when someone is sick what do you do
[1:19:28] you know this
[1:19:30] if someone in the family is sick we love
[1:19:32] to sit around the table and say well
[1:19:33] brother so and so or you know my my
[1:19:35] grandmother when she had that same
[1:19:37] problem she ended up in a nursing home
[1:19:38] and so and so he had a stroke and so and
[1:19:40] so it was high blood pressure so high
[1:19:42] blood sugar we love to diagnose
[1:19:44] but the truth is we don't know
[1:19:47] and the same symptoms can have many
[1:19:49] causes
[1:19:50] that's why it's important to get at the
[1:19:52] root
[1:19:54] right and so brother brown deals with
[1:19:55] nervousness in the prayer lines
[1:19:57] and he deals it in many different ways
[1:20:00] in one famous case which i know you've
[1:20:02] heard before i know that i've read it
[1:20:03] before but brandon was praying for a man
[1:20:05] who's depressed and nervous
[1:20:07] and and he doesn't just say well lord
[1:20:09] calm his nerves but he goes back into
[1:20:11] his past
[1:20:13] and he finds a cause in this case he
[1:20:14] said when you was a child a little boy
[1:20:16] with knee pants on he said you've got
[1:20:18] problems with something
[1:20:19] run he said i believe it's a dog that
[1:20:21] chased you or something
[1:20:22] isn't that right a big dog and you run
[1:20:24] to a porch
[1:20:26] later on he said it was a yellow dog
[1:20:29] that's pretty that's pretty particular
[1:20:31] isn't it
[1:20:32] the prophet goes back and sees that life
[1:20:35] and you'll find uh another case at least
[1:20:37] one other case the message of that
[1:20:39] young hispanic boy in tucson had the
[1:20:41] same problem here he was an adult man
[1:20:43] that carried out all his life there was
[1:20:44] a young boy that was scared and nervous
[1:20:46] brandon said that child got chased by a
[1:20:48] dog
[1:20:50] so but that's not always the reason for
[1:20:53] nervousness
[1:20:55] right you might be nervous and anxious
[1:20:57] and depressed and it's not caused
[1:20:58] because you were chased by a dog
[1:21:01] right it may have a different route
[1:21:04] look look at this brother brandon says
[1:21:05] that's one of your troubles it's
[1:21:06] nervousness he's speaking to a lady he
[1:21:09] said now your nervousness is caused from
[1:21:10] your age
[1:21:12] in other words menopause
[1:21:14] that's a reason
[1:21:16] he said but now that'll all leave you
[1:21:18] right that's a different reason for
[1:21:19] nervous a different route
[1:21:22] right again brother branham deals with
[1:21:24] another man he said all right the thing
[1:21:25] of it is you're really the trouble is
[1:21:26] you're suffering from a nervous
[1:21:27] breakdown
[1:21:28] you're having some kind of mental
[1:21:30] scruples in your mind it's oppression
[1:21:32] from satan
[1:21:34] right here's a completely different
[1:21:35] cause for the same symptoms
[1:21:38] he said this has been going on for some
[1:21:40] time it's caused your body to get weak
[1:21:41] your heart is weak you're in very bad
[1:21:43] shape by this your whole family is just
[1:21:45] about into a breakdown
[1:21:47] right because when it happens to one it
[1:21:49] spreads to the family
[1:21:51] and their problem was that his problem
[1:21:53] was oppression from satan on him you
[1:21:55] know how many times god satan rather
[1:21:57] will do that especially in a ministry
[1:21:59] family or a deacon's family or somebody
[1:22:00] involved in the church
[1:22:02] he'll get that into a christian's family
[1:22:04] he'll make that one person to be nervous
[1:22:06] and upset and spread it through the
[1:22:07] whole family and then through the whole
[1:22:08] church right that's why we need to deal
[1:22:11] with these things
[1:22:12] not just let it go especially if you can
[1:22:14] get to the pastor in that way if you can
[1:22:16] make the pastor nervous and upset and
[1:22:18] anxious it'll make the whole church like
[1:22:20] that
[1:22:21] because we're sheep
[1:22:23] right sheep are trained because they're
[1:22:25] watching for the wolf
[1:22:27] and they get real nervous when they
[1:22:29] sense there'll be one of them little
[1:22:30] sense or smell or there'll be some some
[1:22:32] way that they identify there's a there's
[1:22:35] a wolf there and they begin to get
[1:22:36] nervous
[1:22:37] and then begin to look for the shepherd
[1:22:39] oh that's what we need to do today when
[1:22:42] you get nervous when you get weary when
[1:22:43] you get anxious look for the shepherd
[1:22:46] but there's many different causes for
[1:22:48] this
[1:22:49] again he deals with another another
[1:22:51] person
[1:22:52] i think this is a woman but he said
[1:22:54] something strange i see a man a young
[1:22:56] man appear in here it's your son
[1:22:59] and he is suffering from a mental
[1:23:00] condition and the mental condition was
[1:23:02] caused by domestic trouble
[1:23:05] domestic trouble
[1:23:07] and again he speaks to another lady a
[1:23:10] lady had tried to contact brother
[1:23:11] branham for nine years
[1:23:13] can you imagine trying to get in touch
[1:23:15] with the prophet
[1:23:16] for nine years she tried and she finally
[1:23:18] got in touch with him got a personal
[1:23:20] interview
[1:23:21] and the lady he said move back and she
[1:23:22] said brother branham just a word with
[1:23:24] you he said standing there a vision
[1:23:26] broke over this fine looking young woman
[1:23:27] and she can see that her heart was
[1:23:29] burdened
[1:23:30] and she was trying to work to make a
[1:23:32] living
[1:23:33] he said and a great thing happened
[1:23:35] back way back in the time of her parents
[1:23:39] that had caused this great thing to
[1:23:41] happen to her
[1:23:43] and the lord jesus revealed it and
[1:23:44] showed what it was
[1:23:47] he said in there in a moment's time
[1:23:50] aren't you glad for the grace of god
[1:23:52] a prophet can look back into her life
[1:23:54] and say this thing didn't happen just to
[1:23:56] you it happened to your parents
[1:23:58] and she maybe had never heard the story
[1:24:00] but she found out what happened to her
[1:24:02] parents you could deal with what
[1:24:03] happened to her
[1:24:04] he said the lord jesus revealed it show
[1:24:06] what it was and there in a moment's time
[1:24:08] took it from the woman you've got to
[1:24:09] identify it but it's the lord jesus that
[1:24:11] takes it away
[1:24:12] you've got to identify but it's the fire
[1:24:14] of the holy ghost that takes it away
[1:24:16] that's why we need the power of god in
[1:24:18] our services we need the presence of god
[1:24:21] to be here not just sometimes but
[1:24:22] there's people dealing with things
[1:24:24] constantly people dealing with all kinds
[1:24:26] of different things and maybe they
[1:24:28] present in the same way but they're
[1:24:30] completely different
[1:24:32] that's why you can't deal with everybody
[1:24:34] in the same way
[1:24:36] and there might be times and i'll just
[1:24:37] deal with this now but you excuse me if
[1:24:39] you don't go to church here and just
[1:24:41] kind of lay this to the side but there
[1:24:42] may be times you say brother ben as my
[1:24:44] pastor you dealt with this one way this
[1:24:47] time and i see you dealing with it a
[1:24:48] different way this time and i don't
[1:24:49] understand there's a reason for that
[1:24:52] it's two different people
[1:24:55] and many times i don't know how we're
[1:24:57] going to deal with something until we
[1:24:57] get back here and begin to talk about it
[1:25:00] and and some of the brothers can tell
[1:25:01] you that you don't know which way you're
[1:25:03] going to go in the person the way they
[1:25:04] present and the spirit that's there and
[1:25:06] you give them to dig back in their life
[1:25:07] and see some things you begin to realize
[1:25:09] this is a problem
[1:25:11] and then if they won't deal with it then
[1:25:12] there's got to be something that happens
[1:25:14] but maybe somebody else with the same
[1:25:16] outward symptoms
[1:25:18] will come and get a different answer
[1:25:20] look at brother branham how many
[1:25:21] different people are going out there
[1:25:22] with personal testimonies brother
[1:25:24] branham told them personally because
[1:25:26] they're different people
[1:25:29] right you can't apply that to a whole
[1:25:30] church
[1:25:33] i may get myself in trouble but it's the
[1:25:34] truth
[1:25:37] and we had a deacon one time i was i
[1:25:39] went to church with a deacon he felt
[1:25:41] that everything had to be the same if
[1:25:43] you if you moved one person from a
[1:25:44] certain spot in the church and wanted
[1:25:46] them to sit somewhere else you know the
[1:25:47] deacons part of their job is seating
[1:25:49] people in meetings and things like that
[1:25:50] if you move this person you had to move
[1:25:52] other people you couldn't just do it to
[1:25:54] one person everybody's the same well
[1:25:55] that's not how that works
[1:25:58] some people are just there they're not
[1:26:00] going to hear it whether or not on the
[1:26:01] front row or the back row
[1:26:05] and there's other people maybe young
[1:26:07] people and they need to be up front
[1:26:09] right so he would never move one unless
[1:26:10] you move the other but it's just there's
[1:26:12] a difference in people you've got to
[1:26:13] learn that
[1:26:15] and so people there's different causes
[1:26:17] for the same
[1:26:18] symptoms
[1:26:19] here's another one that dealt with
[1:26:21] nervousness he said this lady suffers
[1:26:22] with an extremely nervous condition but
[1:26:24] you're all upset about something you're
[1:26:26] weary he said i see you shake your head
[1:26:27] or something in prayer
[1:26:29] you even wonder sometimes if you're
[1:26:31] actually saved
[1:26:35] he said that's true you've doubted your
[1:26:37] experience of being saved
[1:26:40] but i'll tell you now you are
[1:26:43] glory to god
[1:26:45] he said but this was caused by a call
[1:26:48] some kind of a shock you've had
[1:26:51] some news or something that shocked you
[1:26:52] all at once and caused this he said i
[1:26:54] think it was a death of your husband
[1:26:56] last fall
[1:26:57] he said god bless your heart lady let's
[1:26:59] move the sadness
[1:27:01] everything will be all right
[1:27:04] see the root needed to be dealt with now
[1:27:06] that's the same symptom and i showed you
[1:27:08] six different root causes there's many
[1:27:10] more
[1:27:10] if you go in and study nervousness and
[1:27:12] how brother branham dealt with it but it
[1:27:14] wasn't all the same
[1:27:17] now watch if you but the cure is all the
[1:27:20] same
[1:27:22] it's the fire of the holy ghost
[1:27:24] that's always the cure
[1:27:26] we preach christ and him crucified paul
[1:27:29] said i know nothing among you except
[1:27:30] christ and him crucified so again you
[1:27:32] can't counsel away a spiritual problem
[1:27:35] many times you can't beat it out of your
[1:27:37] children either
[1:27:39] it's got the
[1:27:40] word of god has to be preached and that
[1:27:42] person has to accept it into their soul
[1:27:44] and let the fire of god purge it out of
[1:27:46] them
[1:27:48] now
[1:27:51] again the same symptom six different
[1:27:52] root causes
[1:27:54] if you want to quit producing poison
[1:27:55] fruit you need to let the holy ghost
[1:27:57] deal with that root
[1:27:59] and sometimes what you think is
[1:28:01] persecution
[1:28:02] and you think it's an attack well i had
[1:28:04] five preachers tell me the same thing
[1:28:07] they're all against me maybe it's the
[1:28:08] holy spirit trying to speak to you
[1:28:13] did you ever consider that it was the
[1:28:15] grace of god
[1:28:17] the holy spirit reaching down into your
[1:28:19] generation to speak to you because he's
[1:28:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:27] did you ever consider that that it's god
[1:28:29] trying to tell you something every time
[1:28:30] you look at the bible you come up with
[1:28:32] the same thing you think well i must be
[1:28:34] being persecuted the devil must be
[1:28:36] against me maybe god's trying to tell
[1:28:38] you something
[1:28:39] because the word of god is alive quick
[1:28:42] and powerful sharper than any two-edged
[1:28:44] sword piercing to the listen the
[1:28:46] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:28:49] so the word knows
[1:28:52] if it's a soul problem
[1:28:54] or if it's a spirit problem
[1:28:56] are you with me now the word christ
[1:28:59] looked at them pharisees and john the
[1:29:01] baptist said you've got a problem the
[1:29:02] axe is laid to the root of the trees but
[1:29:04] jesus walked out and said you're of your
[1:29:06] father the devil
[1:29:07] why because the word was a discerner
[1:29:10] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:29:12] and could divide between the elect and
[1:29:13] the non-elect
[1:29:15] could divide between the soul and the
[1:29:16] spirit but even you the word that deals
[1:29:19] with you he deals with me the word deals
[1:29:21] with us and it divides
[1:29:24] between what is flesh
[1:29:26] and what is spirit
[1:29:28] what is spirit and what is soul
[1:29:31] you understand if there's a problem and
[1:29:33] many times the devil tried to tell you
[1:29:34] like he did this woman you're not even
[1:29:36] saved well that's not the problem at all
[1:29:39] but the word is is a quick is alive and
[1:29:42] powerful aren't you glad that it is this
[1:29:44] morning
[1:29:45] quit making excuses for the fruit
[1:29:48] dig the root out
[1:29:51] huh
[1:29:52] you don't understand what happened in my
[1:29:53] past i know
[1:29:55] i know it's a hurt
[1:29:56] i know that
[1:29:58] you you need to identify it but don't
[1:30:00] dwell on it dig it out
[1:30:04] see because a poison root infiltrates
[1:30:06] every area of your life
[1:30:09] simon the sorcerer
[1:30:12] you find in acts chapter 8 he tried to
[1:30:13] buy the gift of the holy ghost
[1:30:15] but he was rebuked by the apostles and
[1:30:17] this is how they rebuked him repent
[1:30:19] therefore this thy wickedness and pray
[1:30:21] god if perhaps the thought of thine
[1:30:22] heart may be forgiven thee
[1:30:24] i perceive that thou art in the gall of
[1:30:26] bitterness
[1:30:28] in the bond of iniquity you're believing
[1:30:30] this false thing you're following after
[1:30:32] these false things because of your
[1:30:34] bitterness
[1:30:36] and you don't understand it
[1:30:38] and see that that can be hidden for a
[1:30:40] while many times we can clip the fruit
[1:30:42] off look pretty good come to church and
[1:30:44] clip off all the bitter leaves
[1:30:47] ain't no roots here
[1:30:49] the word of god goes to work and he'd be
[1:30:50] oh man
[1:30:53] it's still there
[1:30:55] needs to be dealt with
[1:30:57] but it seems like it springs up at the
[1:30:59] most unfortunate times
[1:31:01] family reunions
[1:31:04] meetings
[1:31:07] sunday morning
[1:31:09] boy it's quiet in here this morning
[1:31:12] that root of bitterness springs up don't
[1:31:14] it
[1:31:15] we've all had to deal with it there
[1:31:16] ain't none of us that haven't had to
[1:31:18] deal with a root of bitterness
[1:31:22] it springs up and that's what paul said
[1:31:24] be careful he said lester root of
[1:31:26] bitterness springing up
[1:31:27] all at once it's there where did it come
[1:31:29] from they were among us for years
[1:31:32] and root of bitterness sprung up because
[1:31:34] there's something that happened in the
[1:31:35] past they never got over
[1:31:39] and usually again when we're speaking
[1:31:41] about bitterness in particular it's
[1:31:42] usually the result of a wounded spirit
[1:31:45] followed by a decision not to forgive
[1:31:49] that is a choice
[1:31:51] you know how we know that because jesus
[1:31:52] said when you stand praying forgive
[1:31:55] he didn't say when you stand praying try
[1:31:57] to forgive
[1:31:59] make an attempt
[1:32:01] for gift
[1:32:05] now
[1:32:06] a good example that's judas i don't have
[1:32:08] time to go into it that much but
[1:32:10] how did the bible says satan entered
[1:32:12] into judas how did that happen if you go
[1:32:13] look at it
[1:32:15] he was mildly rebuked by jesus
[1:32:18] the bible said he had the bag he was a
[1:32:19] thief he was standing there when the
[1:32:20] woman washed jesus feet and he said that
[1:32:23] money would have been better spent on
[1:32:25] something else
[1:32:26] because judas don't care about the
[1:32:28] sinners
[1:32:30] about salvation of souls he just cared
[1:32:31] about money
[1:32:33] and so he said it'd be better all spent
[1:32:35] on something else
[1:32:37] and here he was holding the bag and
[1:32:39] jesus mildly rebuked him
[1:32:41] and he got his feelings hurt and you can
[1:32:43] go look in the scripture immediately he
[1:32:45] left
[1:32:46] and went straight to the pharisees
[1:32:50] what was it it was the straw that broke
[1:32:52] the camel's back yeah he was the son of
[1:32:54] perdition but what caused him to
[1:32:55] actually go that far you know he didn't
[1:32:58] want to
[1:33:00] he didn't want to but he didn't deal
[1:33:02] with the problem and the problem was
[1:33:03] from his very roots
[1:33:08] it does no good to blame the ones who
[1:33:10] did the wounding
[1:33:13] what if we were working say in
[1:33:15] construction and
[1:33:16] and are you still with me this morning
[1:33:19] let's imagine we were on a job and
[1:33:21] and i was messing around and maybe i was
[1:33:24] trying to help and i'm not much of a
[1:33:26] construction worker but i remember one
[1:33:28] of the things that was a no-no on the
[1:33:29] job if there's a board with nails in it
[1:33:32] you don't leave it on the ground with
[1:33:33] the nails sticking up
[1:33:35] right
[1:33:37] so it's there's a board with nails in it
[1:33:38] but caleb and maybe you and i are
[1:33:39] working out there on the job and that's
[1:33:42] a terrible thought isn't it
[1:33:44] you've worked with my brother you know
[1:33:46] what that's like
[1:33:47] but we'd be working out there and on the
[1:33:49] ground and i leave a board out like that
[1:33:51] well i've been yelled at that before
[1:33:52] when i was a kid we helped out on
[1:33:54] construction sites and and they'd yell
[1:33:56] at me and say hey don't do that turn it
[1:33:57] around stick the nails in the ground or
[1:33:59] take it and throw it in the scrap heap
[1:34:01] don't leave it out there on the ground
[1:34:02] somebody will step on it
[1:34:05] right so i leave it on the ground you
[1:34:06] walk by you're not looking and you walk
[1:34:08] by but you don't you expect the sight to
[1:34:10] be clean you walk by and you get a nail
[1:34:12] in your foot
[1:34:14] now watch
[1:34:16] no no you got a choice
[1:34:18] what you're gonna do about that
[1:34:20] you can stand there and yell at me
[1:34:24] for leaving the board up
[1:34:25] yes it's my fault
[1:34:30] but you need to go to the doctor
[1:34:32] make sure you've had a tetanus shot
[1:34:36] and why do they do that i know some of
[1:34:38] us don't think that's necessary
[1:34:40] why do they give tetanus shots because
[1:34:42] if you get locked jaw if you get the the
[1:34:46] the disease that comes from that
[1:34:48] one out of 10 people with that disease
[1:34:50] die
[1:34:52] so you could literally die
[1:34:54] from stepping on a rusty nail
[1:34:57] and your family might gather around and
[1:34:59] at the funeral and they say oh brother
[1:35:01] ben was so terrible he left out a nail
[1:35:04] and but what really killed you
[1:35:08] think about it
[1:35:10] because there's a
[1:35:12] there's an antidote available
[1:35:15] you all you had to do was get a shot
[1:35:20] and then you can blame me all you want
[1:35:23] but you wouldn't die
[1:35:25] are you hearing me today there there's
[1:35:27] an antidote available you need to deal
[1:35:29] with it because that rusty nail will
[1:35:31] spread that poison will spread
[1:35:34] and if you've been wounded in your
[1:35:35] spirit it does no good to stand there
[1:35:38] and yell at the person who did the
[1:35:40] wounding
[1:35:42] it does you absolutely no good
[1:35:45] you'll stand there and die
[1:35:48] your body will begin to die
[1:35:51] why because that bitterness spreads
[1:35:53] through your body
[1:35:55] and you say but i died of the nail no
[1:35:57] you didn't you died because of your
[1:35:58] refusal to deal with it
[1:36:02] the wound was not fatal
[1:36:05] but the poison that wasn't dealt with
[1:36:07] was fatal
[1:36:10] being hurt is human but you better deal
[1:36:12] with that wound
[1:36:14] now first of all you need to decide if
[1:36:16] this is a real wound a real hurt or if
[1:36:18] you're simply an oft offended person
[1:36:21] because again that's a different thing
[1:36:23] same symptoms but a different cause
[1:36:26] if you're a person just gets offended at
[1:36:28] everything you need to get over that
[1:36:31] and and i know it's that's it's more
[1:36:33] nuanced than that i know there may be
[1:36:34] different different causes for that but
[1:36:36] you understand you need to deal with
[1:36:37] that
[1:36:38] not the offense
[1:36:40] but if it's real you need to deal with
[1:36:41] it and this is why jesus taught that if
[1:36:44] we had something we couldn't get over
[1:36:46] and again i don't think this ought to be
[1:36:48] every little thing that happens but
[1:36:49] something big
[1:36:51] something we can't get over
[1:36:54] if you've got something you can't get
[1:36:55] over you need to go talk
[1:36:58] with the person that did it
[1:37:02] i don't want to see them again i want to
[1:37:03] talk just what the devil wants you to do
[1:37:06] you got to go deal with it
[1:37:08] if again if thy brother shall trespass
[1:37:10] against he go tell him his fault
[1:37:12] between me and him alone
[1:37:14] not on the telephone
[1:37:17] not in the not to the neighbors not to
[1:37:19] all the other preachers but to you and
[1:37:20] him alone
[1:37:22] if he'll hear thee thou has gained thy
[1:37:23] brother
[1:37:25] notice this is a brother you can't deal
[1:37:27] with a person who's not a christian in
[1:37:29] the same way
[1:37:30] right you can't bring somebody from the
[1:37:31] bank brother up here before the church
[1:37:33] and
[1:37:35] deal with it you know they're not going
[1:37:36] to do that unless the person is a
[1:37:38] christian i guess you could but robbie
[1:37:40] works at the bank too you could deal
[1:37:41] with someone that's a christian but not
[1:37:43] you know not with a personal matter but
[1:37:46] this is something that someone has done
[1:37:47] they really did something wrong
[1:37:50] christians talk to one another
[1:37:52] do you know that not about one another
[1:37:56] the church has no authority over a
[1:37:57] non-christian but to a christian we
[1:37:59] ought to be held to
[1:38:01] and that's part of the reason why we are
[1:38:02] a body a church we have a church
[1:38:05] because if you don't have a church you
[1:38:07] have no one to go to
[1:38:09] you can't ever fulfill this scripture
[1:38:11] but if you have a church then there's
[1:38:12] somebody that you can go to it says if
[1:38:14] he will not hear thee take with thee one
[1:38:16] or two more in the mouth of two or three
[1:38:18] witnesses every word may be established
[1:38:20] and if he shall neglect to hear them
[1:38:21] tell it to the church but if he neglect
[1:38:23] to hear the church let him be unto thee
[1:38:24] as a heathen man in the public and i
[1:38:25] will say most people it never gets this
[1:38:27] far
[1:38:28] because most of the time the one who did
[1:38:30] the offending just leaves and he won't
[1:38:32] deal with you anymore
[1:38:34] it's just the way it happens most of the
[1:38:35] time but sometimes it can be dealt with
[1:38:38] if the person's a real christian
[1:38:40] you understand and wants to deal with it
[1:38:42] now it's not to get revenge but to
[1:38:44] settle the matter you're doing as much
[1:38:45] for yourself as for them
[1:38:47] but branham says that he said if i knew
[1:38:48] tonight that i had an enemy he said i
[1:38:50] may have i perhaps have but if i do i
[1:38:53] don't know just who it is
[1:38:55] he said if it was i sure wouldn't go to
[1:38:57] preaching till i went first and made
[1:38:59] that right
[1:39:00] see if i could get straightened up
[1:39:02] because we're not supposed to have
[1:39:04] anything against anyone or if anything
[1:39:07] we can do let no one have anything
[1:39:09] against us
[1:39:12] like if you don't deal with that hurt
[1:39:16] talk it out
[1:39:19] husbands and wives the same way
[1:39:21] if you don't deal with that hurt if you
[1:39:23] won't talk about it you can't
[1:39:25] no progress can be made
[1:39:28] i was dealing with a couple and we had
[1:39:29] weekly meetings and they come back in
[1:39:31] the office and and and i said uh so
[1:39:33] what's happened this week what have you
[1:39:35] talked about oh we haven't talked to
[1:39:36] each other this week so well there's
[1:39:38] nothing i can do
[1:39:42] if your relationship is the point you
[1:39:43] won't talk to each other what are we
[1:39:44] doing here in the office
[1:39:47] right because you've got to be half you
[1:39:49] got to have the will to communicate
[1:39:51] or you can't fix anything
[1:39:54] i i won't hold you that much longer just
[1:39:56] stay with me a few minutes
[1:39:58] are you okay this morning
[1:39:59] i'm trying not to give the whole load of
[1:40:01] hay to the
[1:40:02] to the it's hard to say to the cows that
[1:40:03] showed up but that sounds terrible
[1:40:07] [Laughter]
[1:40:10] to the sheep
[1:40:14] [Laughter]
[1:40:16] boy but joel wasn't here to hear that i
[1:40:17] hope he's not listening
[1:40:21] and he said it don't say if you have
[1:40:22] ought against the brother but if the
[1:40:24] brother has ought against thee
[1:40:26] see you go to him see if he has a lot of
[1:40:28] us would say well that's his problem not
[1:40:30] if you can't get over it it's not
[1:40:33] go to him if he has the auth and that
[1:40:35] way we live peaceful
[1:40:37] how many want to live peaceful
[1:40:39] how many situations could have been
[1:40:41] avoided if two people would have sat
[1:40:42] down and talked something out instead of
[1:40:44] telling someone else
[1:40:45] the root of bitterness causes his
[1:40:47] brother to persecute brother when we
[1:40:49] should be working together how many
[1:40:51] believe we should be working together
[1:40:53] i know it's not always possible i know
[1:40:54] you can't walk together unless you're
[1:40:56] agreed but those of us who do agree
[1:40:58] at least on the big things why can't we
[1:41:00] work together
[1:41:02] but a root of bitterness prevents that
[1:41:04] satan does that look at that first
[1:41:06] church now
[1:41:07] he talks in the early church it was the
[1:41:08] ephesus church age remember the first
[1:41:10] church age that lost their first love
[1:41:11] and here comes smyrna was the next
[1:41:13] church age that come along brother brown
[1:41:15] said now smyrna means bitterness he said
[1:41:18] it comes from the word of myrrh and the
[1:41:19] first church had lost their first love
[1:41:21] the ephesian church and this church had
[1:41:24] began to have a root of bitterness
[1:41:25] coming up in them because at this church
[1:41:27] the main church the big part the
[1:41:29] majority of them always was hammering
[1:41:32] against the holy ghost ruling in the
[1:41:33] church and they wanted to rule
[1:41:35] themselves
[1:41:38] that's where the root of bitterness
[1:41:39] comes from many times
[1:41:41] he said now this church had begun to
[1:41:42] spring up a root of bitterness why it
[1:41:44] was bitter against those who want to
[1:41:46] continue on with the holy ghost
[1:41:49] how many want to continue on with the
[1:41:50] holy ghost
[1:41:52] if you want to then there's always going
[1:41:53] to be a root of bitterness that's
[1:41:55] against that satan will always try to
[1:41:57] come against moving on with the holy
[1:41:59] ghost he said the love had faded away
[1:42:02] and they were trying to swap it to
[1:42:03] creeds and denominations getting away oh
[1:42:06] god can we not see that today
[1:42:08] getting away from the holy ghost
[1:42:09] leadership think of that he said that's
[1:42:11] why the bitterness was in them he said
[1:42:14] now the first church this bitterness
[1:42:15] started creeping in he said the second
[1:42:17] church a little more and finally it kept
[1:42:19] right in because they were making a
[1:42:21] better church thought they were right
[1:42:23] here he said they had something
[1:42:25] dignified the great roman people could
[1:42:27] come in he said why they had a pope they
[1:42:29] had great men cardinals and so forth
[1:42:31] they dressed fine they got away from all
[1:42:33] the noise
[1:42:36] and everything he said they had very
[1:42:38] quiet
[1:42:40] they sat back and said them upstarts
[1:42:42] john the baptist going out there and
[1:42:44] camels robes
[1:42:46] camels hair robes
[1:42:48] too young to even speak to us
[1:42:51] you realize when jesus
[1:42:53] come out we need to watch that when
[1:42:56] jesus come out he was too young to be
[1:42:57] part of the body that judged him
[1:43:00] when he stood before the sanhedrin he
[1:43:01] was too young to be a member of it
[1:43:03] but he was the word
[1:43:06] no i'm not the word in that way i'm not
[1:43:07] the fullness of the word but we have the
[1:43:09] word so we ought to bow to the word not
[1:43:11] to a man
[1:43:12] but we ought to always submit to the
[1:43:14] word
[1:43:15] right he said now he said that he said
[1:43:18] it showed they was now he said they got
[1:43:20] away from all the noise and everything
[1:43:21] they had very quiet showed they was
[1:43:23] dying
[1:43:25] that's the teaching of the prophet as we
[1:43:26] said wednesday night the that's the
[1:43:28] unveiling of the son of man the
[1:43:29] revealing of the son of man
[1:43:31] i didn't say that he taught that
[1:43:33] very quiet so they were dying he said
[1:43:36] and so they got dignified and they made
[1:43:38] a better body
[1:43:39] he said now a church now the church name
[1:43:41] is associated with the nature of its
[1:43:43] character
[1:43:44] he said did you notice smyrna meaning
[1:43:45] bitter did you notice each one of the
[1:43:47] church now it's the church name has
[1:43:48] something to do with the character of
[1:43:50] the church
[1:43:51] and this church was called smyrna
[1:43:52] because it was dying smyrna means
[1:43:55] bitterness
[1:43:56] in other words a root of bitterness was
[1:43:58] coming up and was choking it out it was
[1:44:00] on its road out to myrrh you say that
[1:44:03] could never happen here satan wants to
[1:44:04] do it in every congregation in every
[1:44:06] part of the land i don't care what
[1:44:08] congregation you're a part of who your
[1:44:10] pastor is he wants to bring that root of
[1:44:12] bitterness in
[1:44:15] he said a word of bitterness was coming
[1:44:17] up and was choking it out it was on its
[1:44:18] road out to myrrh
[1:44:20] that's what they anoint bodies with
[1:44:22] myrrh see it was myrrh frankincense as
[1:44:24] an ointment birth used to anoint dead
[1:44:26] bodies after they embalmed them and so
[1:44:27] forth associated with death
[1:44:30] and the church was dying
[1:44:32] oh god help me today
[1:44:34] from a root of bitterness the church was
[1:44:37] dying he said oh can't you see today
[1:44:39] friends the great pentecostal move that
[1:44:41] did have life a few years ago can't you
[1:44:43] see it's being anointed now with myrrh
[1:44:46] he said the same ointment was in this
[1:44:48] church here has come plumbed down and
[1:44:50] anointing this one down here now he's
[1:44:52] talking about the laodiceans
[1:44:54] he said dying out because they're going
[1:44:55] back to ecclesiastical rags
[1:44:58] taking off their white robe saints
[1:45:00] he said the little people who stood out
[1:45:02] there genuine holy spirit spoke with
[1:45:04] tongues and manifested god oh is that
[1:45:06] what you want to do today that's what i
[1:45:08] want to do is manifest god
[1:45:10] here was the little people spoke with
[1:45:11] tongues that manifested god brother they
[1:45:13] was as honest
[1:45:15] oh that's part of the manifestation too
[1:45:17] not just speaking with tongues but being
[1:45:19] honest
[1:45:20] brother they was honest
[1:45:21] all wool and a yard wide
[1:45:24] they absolutely were genuine you could
[1:45:26] trust them anywhere
[1:45:28] he said now you don't know who to what
[1:45:30] to trust
[1:45:31] and who to trust
[1:45:33] realize the condition in the churches
[1:45:35] today
[1:45:36] you look at some places and even some
[1:45:38] pastors i know i can't tell them
[1:45:39] anything
[1:45:41] i couldn't i couldn't let them know a
[1:45:42] burden on my heart because i know they
[1:45:44] would tell other people that shouldn't
[1:45:45] know
[1:45:49] god helped me not to be that way
[1:45:53] i know others who i i thought i could
[1:45:55] trust and you look at anything
[1:45:57] and here we are we have a private maybe
[1:46:00] disagreement
[1:46:01] and you look out and it becomes public
[1:46:02] how did that happen
[1:46:04] the root of bitterness came in
[1:46:07] oh god
[1:46:09] he said now you don't know what to trust
[1:46:10] and who to trust or something's happened
[1:46:12] something happened what is they're being
[1:46:13] anointed with murder bitterness and we
[1:46:15] got to watch that and i've got to watch
[1:46:17] that because if if i'm not careful
[1:46:18] though satan will come in
[1:46:20] and i'll try to bring that bitterness
[1:46:22] about that right down in my life he
[1:46:23] don't care what it's about
[1:46:26] are you hearing me today he don't care
[1:46:27] why you're bitter
[1:46:29] he just wants you to be bitter
[1:46:35] you can trust them anywhere but they're
[1:46:36] being something's happened they're being
[1:46:38] anointed with myrrh of bitterness
[1:46:41] what had caused it one came in it was
[1:46:43] the church called first was a general
[1:46:45] counsel then they called it the
[1:46:46] assemblies of god
[1:46:48] out of the assemblies of god come the
[1:46:49] church of god from the church of god
[1:46:51] they begin to look across and say your
[1:46:53] assemblies
[1:46:55] what caused the root of bitterness
[1:46:58] well you belong to a different church
[1:47:00] i was going to cut real quick here real
[1:47:02] deep here for just a minute we're going
[1:47:04] to close
[1:47:05] the root of bitterness was caused
[1:47:07] because they said you belong to word of
[1:47:09] life tabernacle you belong to this
[1:47:10] tabernacle that i don't care what the
[1:47:12] name is
[1:47:14] the name doesn't make you right
[1:47:18] they begin to look at each other as
[1:47:19] different groups
[1:47:23] they begin to say your assemblies the
[1:47:25] other day your church of god go to the
[1:47:27] rest of that quote
[1:47:30] he said then out i've got to turn around
[1:47:32] to read that without my glasses out of
[1:47:33] that came the united pentecostal church
[1:47:35] of god on an issue
[1:47:37] they had a real issue
[1:47:40] but they separated themselves
[1:47:42] that's right they said if you're not
[1:47:43] with us you're janis and jamers
[1:47:45] if you're not with us your balaam if
[1:47:47] you're not with us you're this that or
[1:47:48] the other where did that spirit come
[1:47:50] from
[1:47:51] it didn't come from a prophet
[1:47:54] look first thing you know and he said he
[1:47:56] said on an issue the first thing you
[1:47:57] know instead of accepting light and
[1:47:58] walking in it he said they don't
[1:48:00] organize themselves so they couldn't
[1:48:02] accept light
[1:48:04] oh god
[1:48:06] what what hour do we live in
[1:48:08] he said and so
[1:48:10] and he goes on to explain how that what
[1:48:12] fellowship was he said so i like that
[1:48:14] i like a fellowship
[1:48:16] but when we draw lines like this and say
[1:48:19] no this is our denomination
[1:48:21] and we won't reach over and shake hands
[1:48:23] with the next man and say bless god
[1:48:25] brother
[1:48:28] he said my
[1:48:30] he said that's when you call fellowship
[1:48:34] i know we had some meetings here not
[1:48:35] long ago
[1:48:36] you don't call meetings like that and
[1:48:38] try to bring everybody in when when
[1:48:40] everything's just fine everybody gets
[1:48:41] along with each other you do it when
[1:48:43] they're not
[1:48:46] that's what a prophet said that's when
[1:48:48] you call fellowship
[1:48:50] when people and you bring people
[1:48:52] together that won't hardly speak to one
[1:48:54] another
[1:48:57] that's the perfect god help me to do
[1:48:58] that because the temptation always is
[1:49:00] just forget them
[1:49:03] they won't listen
[1:49:05] see satan trying to bring in that root
[1:49:07] of bitterness again
[1:49:11] he said reach over and shake hands with
[1:49:12] the next man and say bless god brother
[1:49:15] that's when you call fellowship if you
[1:49:17] don't
[1:49:18] you get that root of bitterness
[1:49:22] oh i pray that we would never have that
[1:49:24] root of bitterness
[1:49:25] yes we have a church we want to be loyal
[1:49:28] we want to be faithful but we're a part
[1:49:29] of the bride
[1:49:32] whether the leadership changes
[1:49:33] completely everything changes no we
[1:49:35] don't know what the future holds we're
[1:49:37] part of the bride
[1:49:39] not a denomination a many member bride
[1:49:43] we are a local church but we're part of
[1:49:45] the mighty church of jesus christ the
[1:49:47] bride of jesus christ
[1:49:50] he said you get that root of bitterness
[1:49:52] just like the smyrna's got it back there
[1:49:53] and you caused the same
[1:49:56] thing what did they cause death
[1:50:00] paul warned them about it in galatians 5
[1:50:01] 15. he said but if you bite and devour
[1:50:04] one another take heed that you be not
[1:50:06] consumed
[1:50:07] one of
[1:50:08] another you eat you've eaten the
[1:50:10] poisoned fruit
[1:50:12] from bitter roots
[1:50:15] brother branham spoke of that name in
[1:50:17] the church age book and then i'll go
[1:50:19] down to the next quote
[1:50:20] he said it was a bitter age
[1:50:22] filled
[1:50:23] with death
[1:50:25] a bitter age filled
[1:50:27] with death
[1:50:29] the two vines within the framework of
[1:50:30] the church were drifting farther apart
[1:50:33] with an increased bitterness
[1:50:35] toward the true vine
[1:50:37] now look where are we associating
[1:50:39] ourselves
[1:50:40] the bitterness was not on the part of
[1:50:42] the true vine
[1:50:44] bride doesn't persecute bride
[1:50:48] and i think you could look at the
[1:50:50] scripture and find that bride doesn't
[1:50:51] persecute anybody
[1:50:53] elect doesn't persecute
[1:50:56] period
[1:50:57] jesus never persecuted he spoke the word
[1:51:00] but he never went and tried to try to
[1:51:02] destroy him
[1:51:04] he knew what his end was it was
[1:51:05] sacrifice
[1:51:07] that's us we have to preach the truth
[1:51:09] you understand we got to deal with
[1:51:10] things sometimes
[1:51:11] sometimes among ministers we have to
[1:51:13] deal with things sometimes among
[1:51:14] churches we have to deal with things you
[1:51:16] can't just let it lay there
[1:51:18] you got to deal with it but don't let
[1:51:20] that root of bitterness come up where
[1:51:22] you can disagree from one side or the
[1:51:23] other and come back and say i'm your
[1:51:24] brother
[1:51:26] brother say if you don't have the same
[1:51:27] feeling that you had before he said you
[1:51:29] don't have the spirit of christ
[1:51:34] which of you discipline your children
[1:51:36] and then hated them
[1:51:39] you don't do that
[1:51:41] if you do you need to repent
[1:51:43] you don't discipline your children and
[1:51:44] hate them
[1:51:46] be spiteful toward them what did i say
[1:51:48] you discipline the children and you want
[1:51:49] them to love on you
[1:51:51] that's what's so hard when they get
[1:51:52] older it's harder and harder to get them
[1:51:53] to do that
[1:51:54] but when they're little
[1:51:56] they'll run to you grab hold of you and
[1:51:58] grab you doesn't that make you feel good
[1:52:01] why because son daughter i did that for
[1:52:03] your good
[1:52:04] i didn't want to
[1:52:06] don't you know the heart of christ is
[1:52:07] the same way
[1:52:09] he said i did that for your good.
[1:52:12] glory
[1:52:14] listen that increased bitterness
[1:52:18] how did men who once called themselves
[1:52:19] brothers end up torturing and murdering
[1:52:22] fellow christians
[1:52:24] roots of bitterness
[1:52:26] this country has got such a root of
[1:52:28] bitterness in it among democrats and
[1:52:31] republicans
[1:52:33] that if the world continues much longer
[1:52:35] there'll be a civil war
[1:52:37] brother against brother
[1:52:39] if you go back and examine the civil war
[1:52:41] and you look at it how it happened how
[1:52:42] the parties raised up and they they use
[1:52:44] the kind of language that they use and
[1:52:46] they're doing the same thing today
[1:52:48] only then you had an abraham lincoln
[1:52:49] that tried to try to make things right
[1:52:51] and say with malice toward none we don't
[1:52:53] have that today
[1:52:56] roots of bitterness and the whole world
[1:52:58] is going crazy with it you better die to
[1:53:01] that thing today don't get caught up in
[1:53:03] that
[1:53:04] it's going to destroy this nation don't
[1:53:05] get caught up in it
[1:53:07] brother branham talked i've talked about
[1:53:08] the black people there that got caught
[1:53:10] up in that in that situation with martin
[1:53:12] luther king he said it's just they're
[1:53:14] trying to get them stirred up
[1:53:16] to where millions of them will die
[1:53:18] don't you realize it's the same thing
[1:53:19] that's happening today it's a spirit
[1:53:23] die to that thing
[1:53:25] or it'll show up
[1:53:26] when you least expect it
[1:53:29] if you don't get rid of the root of
[1:53:31] bitterness it'll come up while you're
[1:53:32] preaching
[1:53:33] it'll show up when you're in your prayer
[1:53:34] closet
[1:53:35] it'll show up in your marriage
[1:53:38] show up in your relationship with your
[1:53:40] brother and sister
[1:53:42] how do we dig it out
[1:53:44] but the brown said you know how to dig a
[1:53:45] root out we used to take a grubbing hole
[1:53:47] and just get down at it
[1:53:48] and dig it till there wasn't a speck
[1:53:50] left in it
[1:53:51] and they said if there'd be any root of
[1:53:53] bitterness bring it up into you grub her
[1:53:54] out
[1:53:55] that's right he said that's what the
[1:53:56] holy spirit does root out all the roots
[1:53:59] dig them out pile it up burn them get
[1:54:01] rid of them
[1:54:02] you get a good crop then if we do that
[1:54:04] so many times we leave too quickly
[1:54:07] after the sermons preached and after we
[1:54:09] feel the presence of god on the place
[1:54:10] conviction is there and we've dug up all
[1:54:12] them roots
[1:54:13] but we just leave them laying on the
[1:54:14] ground and they find their way back into
[1:54:16] the soil
[1:54:18] you've got to burn them
[1:54:20] now it's the time to burn them how do i
[1:54:22] do that with the fire of the holy ghost
[1:54:24] let the holy spirit wash you and cleanse
[1:54:26] you and the word has scrubbed it out now
[1:54:29] let the holy spirit wash over you as you
[1:54:31] begin to worship god
[1:54:33] he said
[1:54:35] get rid of them he said you get a good
[1:54:36] crop then if we do that
[1:54:40] musicians go ahead and come
[1:54:43] but the brandon said it's the brother
[1:54:44] you think he's a little wrong or the
[1:54:45] sister
[1:54:47] say lord
[1:54:48] don't let let me never have that root of
[1:54:50] bitterness spring up
[1:54:52] because it'll affect him
[1:54:54] and it'll take the christ right out of
[1:54:56] my life
[1:54:58] that poison acids of malice
[1:55:00] and jealousy and hatred
[1:55:02] you realize that's just as much sin as
[1:55:04] adultery
[1:55:07] just as much sin as any adultery as any
[1:55:10] kind of moral failing
[1:55:12] a root of bitterness
[1:55:14] he said it'll take the christ right away
[1:55:16] from you right out of my life the poison
[1:55:18] assets of malice jealousy and hatred
[1:55:20] would test just take the holy spirit
[1:55:21] right away from you it will run him from
[1:55:23] the tabernacle here it'll kill the
[1:55:25] spirit of god drive it away from here
[1:55:27] hurt your pastor it'll do everything
[1:55:28] don't you do that you just wax that much
[1:55:31] closer together
[1:55:32] take the buckle as the brother testified
[1:55:34] a minister here the other night but
[1:55:36] having a buckle seeing it in a vision
[1:55:37] that testimony's on youtube by the way
[1:55:39] the brother that saw that vision and he
[1:55:41] explains what the vision was
[1:55:43] he said just set buckles on the whole
[1:55:44] armor of god he said just pull her on
[1:55:47] tighten up move right up close to one
[1:55:49] another
[1:55:50] love one another anyhow
[1:55:52] talk nice about one another say nice
[1:55:55] things about one another and then god
[1:55:57] will bless you
[1:55:59] you want to be blessed
[1:56:02] the children of israel were dealing with
[1:56:03] bitter waters at mara
[1:56:05] bitter waters that's poison waters
[1:56:08] it wasn't that they couldn't drink it
[1:56:10] because it tasted bad but they couldn't
[1:56:12] drink it because if they did they'd die
[1:56:15] it was not drinkable water
[1:56:18] you couldn't fellowship there
[1:56:21] oh god
[1:56:22] and they cried out to the lord and moses
[1:56:24] god showed moses a tree
[1:56:27] you remember the story
[1:56:29] he said he cut down the tree and he
[1:56:30] threw it into the water
[1:56:32] and when he did the tree cured the water
[1:56:34] and brother brandon taught us if we
[1:56:36] would throw the cross take the cross
[1:56:39] take self-sacrifice throw it into the
[1:56:42] water
[1:56:43] put jesus at the center of everything
[1:56:45] that we do and what we are
[1:56:47] it'll sweeten the waters
[1:56:49] as the song says the waters of mara
[1:56:51] he'll sweeten for you
[1:56:53] he drank all the bitter
[1:56:55] a gethsemane
[1:56:56] do you believe it today
[1:56:58] hey man bow your heads with me for a
[1:57:00] moment i hope i haven't kept you too
[1:57:02] long
[1:57:07] don't get bitter
[1:57:11] but brother ben you stepped on my toes
[1:57:12] one time too many don't get better about
[1:57:15] it that don't hurt me
[1:57:18] not nearly as much as it hurts you
[1:57:24] you get better about
[1:57:27] past events i don't care who you are
[1:57:30] if you constantly preach it you
[1:57:32] constantly come against it you may be a
[1:57:34] man of god
[1:57:36] if you constantly deal it's all the time
[1:57:38] on your lips what somebody did to you
[1:57:40] you need to get that root out
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] my mother my father my sister my brother
[1:57:46] my church
[1:57:48] that pastor
[1:57:50] you don't understand what they did
[1:57:52] you don't understand what they did to
[1:57:54] him
[1:57:54] [Music]
[1:57:57] how could it be worse that the stripes
[1:58:00] 39 stripes were put on his back
[1:58:04] tore the flesh until you could see the
[1:58:06] bone
[1:58:07] and his own people
[1:58:10] did not recognize him i must have hurt
[1:58:12] the worst
[1:58:15] when they cried out crucify him
[1:58:18] give us barabbas
[1:58:22] oh god
[1:58:23] must have hurt
[1:58:25] he was a human being in the flesh he
[1:58:27] must have hurt
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:31] but yet he cried out father forgive them
[1:58:36] to air as human to forgive is divine
[1:58:40] father forgive it see but i can't do
[1:58:43] that no you're you're selling yourself
[1:58:45] short
[1:58:46] you have the spirit of christ that that
[1:58:47] same spirit that dwelled in him dwells
[1:58:49] in you it'll raise up your mortal body
[1:58:51] you believe you're going in a rapture
[1:58:52] one day that body's going to be changed
[1:58:54] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye
[1:58:56] you'll see your loved ones
[1:58:58] you believe that a messenger coming our
[1:59:00] day to teach us that
[1:59:02] if you believe that why can't you
[1:59:03] believe that same god
[1:59:05] can make give you the ability to forgive
[1:59:07] people
[1:59:10] to let it go
[1:59:12] get the poison out
[1:59:14] and you can begin to heal but until you
[1:59:17] get rid of the roots you'll never heal
[1:59:21] and i know people hate it when you tell
[1:59:23] them directly
[1:59:24] but some somebody's got to do it
[1:59:29] well thank god that there's been people
[1:59:30] in my life who cared about me in us
[1:59:32] and when i began to get a root of
[1:59:33] bitterness they come to me and said for
[1:59:35] the men you need to watch that
[1:59:38] you need to be careful
[1:59:41] i'm so glad that that happened it
[1:59:43] happened many times in my life i pray
[1:59:44] it'd be the same way with you today i'm
[1:59:46] not going to blame the preacher i'm not
[1:59:47] going to blame anybody else but lord i
[1:59:49] want those roots of bitterness out of my
[1:59:51] life
[1:59:53] could you just say amen to that day lift
[1:59:55] your hands to him we all deal with that
[1:59:57] i'm not going to single out any one of
[1:59:59] you or group of you we all deal with
[2:00:01] that you that are at home
[2:00:03] or wherever you're at today traveling
[2:00:05] maybe you're watching the service

[2:00:10] lord forgive me
[2:00:14] let me let go of everything
[2:00:16] like you did lord
[2:00:18] or i could say father forgive them
[2:00:21] they don't know what they're doing i
[2:00:22] know i've preached on forgiveness before
[2:00:24] and all these things but we've got to
[2:00:26] get it out
[2:00:27] we've got to root it out
[2:00:29] we've got to constantly weed that garden
[2:00:32] or there'll be something grow up that'll
[2:00:34] take the christ right out of our life
[2:00:36] take us right out of fellowship from the
[2:00:37] people

[2:01:00] or with the ministry of this church

[2:01:07] may there be mercy lord
[2:01:09] may there be grace
