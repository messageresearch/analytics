there's a reason for that I was in Jonesboro today with brother Robert and I plan on going up there again tomorrow so be praying for him and I know anytime they do a good good job on heart bypass surgeries but anytime you have to have a major surgery like that it's a it's a worry and a concern so we're just going to believe the Lord will just take care of all of it we'll just be praying for brother Robert every one of us matters every one of us matters and if you weren't here there would be a there would be a space where you normally were that just wouldn't be filled by anybody else so we believe that you matter and and brother Robert does and I know he's a Christian and he's ready to go but he's only 52 years old so uh he's also ready to live for a while until the Lord comes so

that if we believe all things are possible this evening amen I'm so thankful that we serve a God that whatever we have need of he is capable of giving it to us he said all things as our brother mentioned that's a beautiful thing that we don't just serve a halfway Savior and I say if he's not willing to be halfway towards us I don't think we should be halfway towards him amen I think we should be able to give him everything that we got because you know there's a a lot of things in our life that don't deserve as much attention as we give it and but Jesus deserves all of our attention amen so we're going to be sure to give that to him tonight that'll be all for the music thank you for that wonderful playing and that wonderful music I want to say it's a honor and a privilege to be able to be here again I always look forward to being able to come out and and get to speak to you and get to see each and every one of you and I'm sorry last time that I had to leave right after the service but we had a 12-h hour drive and we about 11 hour drive actually and uh my buddy that was with me had to work first thing that morning I think about 6:00 am so I don't think we got home till about 4 so we had to we had to take off but I apologize for leaving so quickly but if if you have your bibles if you could turn with me to very familiar scripture of Jeremiah 29:11 the Lord laid something on my heart this evening and just seemed to speak to me in such a special way and I know that it means something to me this evening and uh I'd like to thank brother Ben also for the opportunity to be able to speak to you tonight amen do you love the Lord this evening amen Jeremiah 291 it might be a little bit different tonight but you bear with me with me and the scripture says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in he said then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart amen if we out just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus it's so nice to know father that we serve a God Lord that you promised Lord that if we would Seek You Lord we would find you Lord father I believe Lord that you're always there Lord and you you said that wherever you were invited Lord you would go to that place Lord and father here tonight we invite you into this place Lord God father we have nothing within ourselves Lord the preacher or the congregation father to give Lord God but we're relying on you Lord God to be here father L we learned a powerful lesson for the by father by your Prophet Lord that that wherever you go you're invited Lord but we don't want you just to be invited Lord but be welcome Among Us Lord father we want you to feel welcome Lord to enter any part of our life Lord to touch anything Lord father would you even Lord maybe there's things in our life Lord that we don't really even know about or recognize Lord that need to be made right father but Lord we want you to feel so welcome Lord you could just go there to that place Lord and help us Lord to be more like you Lord now father in this service Lord there you know there's many people and many hearts Lord father probably many questions on their heart Lord I'm sure if we could pull back the veil this evening Lord we could see a need here and a need over there Lord and Lord Within Myself father I don't I don't know their needs father Lord many many probably Lord I don't even know by Name Lord but I know that before the foundation of the world Lord you knew the need father and not only that but Lord you supplied a way to meet that need father for for you said you were the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world almighty God so father this evening Lord just come in a special way and speak to your children Lord that's our desire father forgive us of every shortcoming any sin anything that would so easily beset us Lord or beset this service father we ask that you would forgive us Lord and just cleanse us in your blood even now Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated and I would like to speak on something this evening that that the Lord spoke to me and really dealt with my heart on on the topic of Sovereign Grace amen and in Romans 8:35 it says this who shall separate us from the love of Christ how tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter but it says nay in all these things we are more than conquers through him that loved us amen for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God so I want you to know if you're going through something you know it might be a principality it might be a power that you're going through but I want to tell you don't worry about it because it can't separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and in second Corinthians it said and he said unto me my grace is sufficient how many knows there's a lot of things that we look look at and there's not enough sufficiency in it you know I'll use it in a simple way and the simple way that I know how to say it you might have a trip planned to go somewhere and that trips 300 miles but but you only have 200 miles till empty and you don't have a a sufficiency of gas to get there or a way to make it to that place but I'm so glad that God said my grace is sufficient therefore no matter what we're going through or where we find ourselves there's a sufficient Grace to meet us there and he says my strength is made perfect in in weakness amen now brother brandom says and I'll be taking most of this from the message of Grace but he said Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to listen to this now Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody it don't have to it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this can I must I will I it doesn't do it it does it itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the viist he can save the worst he can save the Imp purest he can save the immoralist he can he can heal the sickest Hallelujah he can save a Wretch like Me and he did he said what is it Grace William Brenham a drunker son that don't make any difference the grace of God saved me he said me I'm a woman's daughter that was no good he said it don't make any difference the grace of God saved you it's Sovereign has to ask nobody nothing amen I'm so glad of that Hallelujah it can take the violence Sinner and make them white as snow don't have to ask anybody about it oh it can do it because it's Sovereign so we can see that God is Sovereign let me just say it as plain as I can you didn't bring yourself here you didn't give yourself life but the Sovereign almighty God when you woke up this morning and you seen the Sovereign sunrise and you and you breathe The Sovereign air that you breathe this morning he doesn't have to ask for your opinion on who he can save he don't have to ask for our opinion on who he can set free he's The Sovereign God this evening he is I say this who was there to tell God a better way sometimes we don't like the way things are and we don't understand the way things are but I promise you if you tried to step into God's job one day you would have it all messed up you wouldn't know what you were doing because with these finite Minds sometimes we can't understand God but God in his infancy God In His Infinite mind he knows everything the end from the beginning and sometimes we forget it's all about him does the clay say to the Potter why has Thou made me thus here in Ephesians it says f for by grace are ye saved thank you Lord church I'm just going to be straightforward this evening and as my brother said take your Liberty it says for by grace are you saved Satan would like to tell you it's all the good things you did and how many times you came to church and what you did and what I I I I before you know it Satan will turn you into a good old Pharisee if you live that way but it's for by grace are you saved through faith what is faith faith is a revelation when he spoke to Simon Peter he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven so what does that mean you are saved through faith and that is not even of yourself come on it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast right right right my thank you Lord it really brings it into perspective when you begin to think of the Sovereign Grace of God you know you begin to look at that and God just showed me some examples here because the Sovereign Grace of God goes further than our finite Minds can comprehend we can't understand how God can forgive and keep forgiving and forgive cuz we some in our own flesh if you don't have the spirit of Christ on the inside of you somebody does you wrong you have a hard time to forgive them and you'll never never trust them again that's true come on but I begin to look at this of someone in the Bible that really begin to speak to me when I when I begin to think of that and know I begin to think of King David I begin to think how this man's whole life his whole life is wrapped up in Grace and even wrapped up in that Grace it seems that he makes a disgrace yeah and all and you know you begin to think of David and David is just a a young boy on the backside of the desert so to speak raising his father's sheep you know just doing what he can just living his life the best that he can I you know I'm sure maybe he was thinking about God maybe he wasn't but there was something one day that a prophet would just come out of nowhere all right and begin to come to his family's house and and we begin to say hey God has called me to raise up a king in the place of Saul and Jesse you you you're you're there's a boy of yours that has found favor with almighty God he's a man after God's Own Heart and I'm here to call him out what did David do to deserve that what did David do to earn that he did absolutely nothing that's right he was just sitting there taking care of his father's sheep but one day a prophet comes in with some anointing o and says you're anointed to be king come on God Almighty called David out from his brothers called David out from his family you might be one in a family by the grace of God can meet you and pull you out of that situation yes sir all and he picks David and he gives David Victory after Victory he gives him victory over the lion victory over the bear victory over Goliath nothing that David has earned within himself and David recognizes his grace in its rightful place at this time because even when Goliath approaches him he said you you you come to me with a with a sword and a spear but I come to you in the name of the Lord he realized where his perfect strength came from he realized where his Grace came from and God would give him victory over the lion victory over the bear victory over Goliath and then he would God would even raise him up into a place where he would have a a place of power he would have Victory after Victory because remember God raises up Kings and he would raise them up to such a high place he never earned any of it it was the grace of almighty God but one day I believe David maybe begin to think look what I've become that's true if we're not careful we'll get in that same place look what I've become look how many services I've been in look how many services I've preached look what I've done with the church look look look look at who I am look at look at how many people I've witnessed to look at look at look at what I've made with my old hands when we ain't done one thing but what almighty God has allowed us to do and David would begin to think man I'm somebody I I don't know if anything can overcome me I don't I don't if I can be beaten at all but one day he was out on his roof out there and he began to look upon Beba and instead of turning his head like a godly man should he begin to look at that a little bit too long and before you know it he begin to take the grace of God that was in his life and begin to make a disgrace out of it that's right and you know he would even go so far as to take you know he would take Bash IBA and he would take her and and he would in that he would do things he ought not to do and because to try to hide his sin he would try to kill her husband we're just going to be straight this I hope this all right he would try to even take UAH and he would bring him back and he would try to hold hide his whole plan from the people saying you just spend some time with your wife and euriah said how can I spend time with my wife when the armies of the Living God are fighting against the enemy and it even said that he slept at the gate and would not go enjoy time with his wife but instead wanted to fight the battle for the Lord so David trying to hide all of his sins and the things that he's done wrong he has to tell a lie on top of a lie and as he he I believe it was Joseph I can't remember the the the chief's name but but he would begin to tell the captain he begin to say I want you to take UAH put him in the heat of the battle and make sure he's dead and then when he's when he's in the middle of that battle I want you to withdraw from him so that he dies so even David himself has killed Uriah he's thinking he's gotten away with it all yeah but you can't hide from God right he said but you can't hide from God he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the building this morning knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you've done for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he says David was ready to pronounce judgment and what he's talking about was brother brandom in the message of Grace he begins to tell the story of how Nathan the prophet would begin to come into town and he begin to tell he be saying David how are things going oh man it's wonderful everything's great everything's going going well and then he said he began to say well David I want to tell you something that's going on in your kingdom then begin to say what is he said well there was a man and he was was a wealthy man and he he had 500 sheep which represented wives he had 500 wives or 500 sheep and and he was going to he was going to have a feast and and instead of taking one of his Lambs for the feast he went across the road to the poor man that had one lamb and took that lamb and killed that lamb for the for the feast and and David was ready to pronounce judgment when he heard that cuz David didn't realize it was him and that's the way we are brother Brenham said we can always judge the other fellow but when it comes to us oh that's different David said the man will pay with his life he said that old Prophet them eyes narrowed down he said David surely you'll not die he said watch Grace there go to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet saved David's life Grace surely you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house so it's thoroughly purged your heart I want to bring a balance to this church whatever you sow in this life you have to reap it amen for you are that rich man oh it was different then wasn't it what saved David when his own judgment said the man will die he'll pay to the uttermost he'll pay for it with his life and the prophet said surely Grace you'll not die you'll not die David Grace has saved you it was Grace to David that saved him oh my we all have to admit David deserved death David deserved to die David deserved to be tortured in my opinion in my opinion he deserved to be put in the innermost cell the dungeon locked up if he took another man's life his life ought to be taken but the grace of God could look down at David and even though it knew David had mistakes it could look at the very heart of David CU what was it when the prophet came to David he be to whip weep bitterly within his heart because he had a heart after God's Own Heart where he could repent I say this to you this evening if you have a heart that can repent and say God I'm sorry you ought to be thankful yes sir it's not that you won't make mistakes it's not that you won't have problems but the grace of God can meet anybody that has a heart oh yeah and say I'm sorry good we look all the way back to Adam and Eve God gave them everything yeah that's right I mean God gave them every better than we have it that's true they had the best place to live didn't have to worry about bad neighbors didn't have to worry about nothing anything they wanted to eat anything they needed if the temperature was was too hot or too cold they would just speak to it and it would change the temperature whatever they wanted when Eve wanted to Red decorate Adam just said tree over here do this do that anything they had it made everything that they ever needed was right there before him and God said you you you can do anything you want anything you want but the one one tree just one the one thing you ain't supposed to do the one tree in the garden don't eat of that tree but do anything else that you want brother bam said Grace is old Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first shown to the human race when he had a beginning of the human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when that little woman that stepped across the separating line and and had gone against God's Commandments and enticed her husband to do the same thing then the law was broken and the law must have a penalty for it is no law and the law was the day that you eat thereof that that day you shall surely die that should have been the end of it that should have been it over with done but you see before the foundation of the world God had attributes God had characteristics can I say this God is the very word of character I believe that everything that we judge good character off of we judge off of God every attribute that we see is good is from God Almighty and within that attribute of himself he had children that he loved he had children that he loved no matter what they did he still loved them because they were a part of him and there was so much grace in that attribute that even though it said that day you eat thereof that day you should have di I would have wiped them off the face of the planet I gave them everything they ever needed but not God not sovereign almighty God see God don't have to ask me his grace don't have to ask me will you save Adam and Eve will you set them oh my what What a Mighty God that we're serving this evening that's right he said there in the garden that morning when sin was so black Jehovah came in there stood his couple standing condemned there would be no more human race they had to die death on the human race give the world back to wild beasts and there would be no more human race but in the darkest of ours in that time when all hopes was gone Grace came pouring through said I'll give you a savior Hallelujah I'll give you a savior a messiah oh it's wonderful how God could ever do it God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of Eden that give them the promise of a just one who could come through the woman what provided a savior Grace sir my what could they do to mer Grace brother Brenham says what could they show come on preach what did they do to earn a savior I ask you what did they do to earn a savior perfect world perfect condition do whatever you need to just don't do this one thing did the one thing what did they do to to earn God's grace let me just say it this evening as plain as I can say it you cannot earn the grace of God that's right the great you could never earn it you don't deserve it that's why it's called Grace glory glory to this is speaking to me this evening can I read this it's a little bit lengthy but can I read it yeah come on brother Brenham said God's grace is like this let me tell you a story and ending God's grace is like this one time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son and one day a murderer killed that boy and through the kingdom went the delegates hunting for that murderer they finally found that murderer and when they found him they brought him back and imprisoned him and when they did a trial was set in a s was made oh it was a terrible thing he had murdered the King's son and he know what was coming to him they put him in the Inner Cell they locked the doors they put pads on it so no one the guard and put guards around it cuz we know what kind of a horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son guards was placed all around the doors he was put in the Inner Cell stripped with nothing but a loin cloth on there he was set there in that condition starving wouldn't give him nothing to eat he was sitting in that condition then they brought him out to trial he was found guilty proven guilty a sentence was made that he was to be executed under horrible capital punishment he was to be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge he was to die and he begged and cried and he said though I'm guilty though I'm guilty I'm sorry that I did that I wish I never done it I'm sorry that I did that in a moment of rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to do it that way one day the king went down to the place to visit the boy to tell him to talk to him to tell him about killing his own son the only son that he had he K that killed that boy he said I'm going down to talk to him and when he went down there he looked back in the cage like a caged in animal he saw a little skinny body laying back there in the corner crying his face all sunk in his Jaws sank back his eyes way back matter was all in his eyes and in his mouth was all wied over no M no water thirsty laying back there on his face crying the king said stand up he came up to him and he looked at him and he said why did did you kill my son what did my son do to you what did he do to Merit such a death as you killed him stabbing him with a spear he said nothing my Lord not one thing just my own impudence impudence I'm sorry just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him and I got in a temper fit and killed him said now I'm to die under your Justice sir I realized that and I deserve to do it only thing I'm crying for that I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal man like that without a cause the king turned on his heels and walked Walked Out went out to the desk and said destroy all the record oh my destroy all the record you know put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the Wreckers wash them up clean them up I'll send down a robe after him after a while great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell the King stood at the end of the limousine said come my son and ride home with me to the Palace put the king's robe around his shoulder he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity that's Grace thank you Lord now listen what brother Brenham says that was me that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were alien dirty filthy laying in the shells Of The World God washed Us by the blood of his own son Hallelujah and cleansed us put on the robe of the Holy Spirit and now the great Chariot of God oh hallelujah hallelujah church God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with him all records are destroyed we can't be judged no more burn them up put them in the sea of forgetfulness remember them no more no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound Hallelujah I know my record you know your record but God don't even remember our record Hallelujah he said there sins and iniquities I will remember no more Oh Glory Hallelujah I killed the King's son I killed the King's son I'm a David I'm an Adam and Eve I killed the King's son with my sins everything I ever did wrong born in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies yes sir but one day he visited me at 15 years old in a caged up sale and he began to ask me why did you kill my son and I begin to say Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I did those things that's why I say if there's something in your heart you don't know how bad people would want to have that something in your heart that can say God I'm sorry I'm sorry I killed the King's son and he turned around and took my filthy rags and gave me a robe he gave me a royalty Hallelujah the king's royalty he did the same thing for you thank you Lord call people out there in the world in here let them come in here and tell you brother David's mistakes and brother Ben's mistakes and brother Brad's mistakes and brother Allan's mistakes let the Holy Spirit come in here and begin to look at what's been covered by the blood of Jesus Christ all records are gone you didn't earn that you didn't deserve that you couldn't build yourself up it's the Sovereign Grace of almighty God Glory thank you Lord you have to forgive me tonight God spoke to me today oh God spoke to me today you don't know what that means to me how many's ever been through a drought I know y'all been going through a literal drought around here but I felt like I was going through a drought yes I kept preaching I tried to do the best I can but the connection didn't seem to be there but then I listen to that sermon perfect strength by Perfect weakness and I begin to realize oh god I've been trying to do this the whole time on my ability and what I can do and he began to realize son I'm the one that called you I'm the one that took care of you I'm the one that's brought you this far I am the author and finisher of your faith than you Lord sir brother bam said that was proved on the cross when there was the violence Thief he deserved to die God had never come across his mind he never thought nothing of it there on the cross when those bloody lips in between the groans there came out a sound Lord Lord be merciful to me this thief didn't earn it he did not earn it we reading the scriptures just a few seconds before he was cussing cussing out the lovely Lord Jesus but with one cry Lord be merciful to me and brother bham said and there came another one back through blood tears Agony he said Grace took a hold and said today shalt thou be with me in Paradise he said Grace did that' how could that Thief help himself no more than Adam could help hisself no more than Eve could help herself no more than you can help yourself no more than I can help myself with no more that we could jerk ourselves up to the Milky White Wave went by our bootstraps we couldn't do it but the grace of God can do something about it it does it the grace of God the sovereignty the grace of God come to that dying Thief today thou shall be with me in Paradise oh think of it that's wonderful I don't ever hardly ever get on Facebook but but I shared something on my Facebook not too long well probably about three or 4 months ago and it's probably the last post I had but but but I was on there and I seen something that was so wonderful to me and this preacher was preaching on the thief on the cross and you may have seen it but he was preaching on the the thief on the cross and and he said can you imagine that thief on the cross that day when he he said I I want to ask him one day how did that shake out for you yeah he said because one minute you're on the cross the next minute he says you're you're you're you're in front of some angels and they're asking you how did you get here I don't know he said well what do you mean you don't know he said well I don't know and he said you know he's just playing it out as a drama he said so the angel goes and gets his supervising Angel and the other Angel comes out and he begins to say sir we just have a few questions for you on how you got here he said are you clear on justification by faith and he says I've never heard of it in my life he began to talk about well what did you did you he said never attained never never never one time went to a church service never one time went to a Bible study never one time did any of these things and we know all those things are right and good and you ought to do it but I'm just telling you this he be and he begin to say the angel begin to scratch his head and he said well oh sir we don't understand but on what basis are you here and he says he turns to him and he looks to him and he says the man on the middle cross said I could come that's right if you see Seth coffee there on that day if you see me dancing on the Hills of Glory it won't be because of Seth coffee and what he's done but it'll be because the man on the middle cross said I could come I could preach as hard as I can and I'll do it for him because I love him I'll live my life the best I can for him but on that day when you hear Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me it'll be because the man on the middle cross said I could come oh thank you Lord that's right when others said I wasn't good enough when others said we would never make it on that day the man on the middle cross said we could come oh thank you Lord he in his love not that we love God but that he loved us that's right and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins this is Grace he wasn't on the cross for anything he did that's Grace I was the reason he was on that cross he could not die he laid his down his life they couldn't kill him that's Grace brother sister they couldn't kill him he said I have power to lay my life down and raise it up again they didn't have power that pilot didn't have any power unless it was given to him and there's 12 Legions of Angel sitting back just sitting there in the trees looking down and I I wonder if they're thinking how far will his grace go I wonder if they're looking down thinking how far will the grace of God go for these people I'm just going to be honest this morning for these no good people this evening rather yeah seems like every day the angels are looking you know there's Guardian Angels so every day they're around guarding people and then taking care of people and and every day they've got to be seeing the mistakes they've got to be seeing the problems take your your Halos off for a minute come on now judgment starts at the house of God take your Halos off if you live perfect in the LA I'll tell you what if you live you say you know if if you haven't made a mistake in the last week raise your hand my and we think we're going to earn the grace of God but he has 12 Le of angels there and they're sitting there looking must be wondering how far is his grace going to go because that's right these angels are encamped about those that fear Him and they're sitting there watching these angels and they must be scratching their heads going why does God even love them let's be honest these are angels that sit Before the Throne going holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty all they know know was Holiness all they've ever seen is Holiness and then they look at us in this flesh not the real you in this flesh and they see the mistakes and the problems and the situations and they must be scratching their head looking at Jesus 12 Legions of them waiting there just to destroy the whole thing but remember in the garden he made a promise thank you Lord Grace would provide a savior and the law was the innocent for the guilty he couldn't send me I'm Not Innocent he couldn't send you You're Not Innocent that's right so he came himself and they begin to look at him and they begin to wonder what's he doing this for how far can his grace go maybe they even begin to draw their swords thinking any second we're going to rush in we're going to save the king we're going to we're going to come in we're going to destroy all the Romans but then they begin to see Jesus and he begins to be in the garden he say these words not my will not this flesh will but thy will be done oh Lord and that was Grace and they begin to go oh my he's going to go through with it and he begins to walk into that judgment and the angels are watching him be beaten and spit on for you for you that's right for every thing you would ever do wrong they put a crown of thorns on his head and squish it to his head the king of glory the king son yes sir blood begins to Spur out of his head and they push it down with a rod on his head clothe him with a robe and make fun of him and hit him and throw a a bag over his head and hit him and say if you're a prophet tell us who hit you he could have looked up and said you're so and so you're such and such you came from such and such family you were born on such and such a day but he didn't do it because it was God's provided lamb of grace and the sovereignty of his grace he would go you got to realize when you look at Calvary it's not for someone else it's for you oh come on he loved you so much that if you were the only person in the world that would serve him he would go through with it he loves you so much if you were the only person in the world that would ever only believe he went through with it and they begin to they begin to take him into the inner Hall and they begin to beat him because of Grace Grace and he's a helpless lamb but not so helpless but making himself helpless that's right making himself helpless for us making himself helpless the king of glory that created the heavens in the Earth the very fibers of the chairs and the floor that you're standing and sitting on he created every bit of it and he's making himself helpless for you right yes not because of what you've done we weren't even born yet when he was on the cross he looked forward in time my and he begins to look back at Isaiah 535 for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed oh thank you Lord what did we ever do to earn that what did I ever do that one night when my little go daughter woke up in the middle of the night screaming daddy my foot hurts my foot and I began to take that foot had a big swollen up swollen bump on it and I said but he was wounded for Jolie Faith's coffee's transgressions bruis for Jolie Faith coffey's iniquities the chastisement of Jolie Faith coffee's peace was upon him and with his stripes Jud Faith coffee is healed she immediately stopped screaming and that bump disappeared I didn't earn that but the grace of God paid for that that every time we're sick wherever brother Robert is he was wounded for brother Robert's transgressions bruised for his iniquity the chastisement of brother Robert's peace was upon him that's right and with those stripes brother Robert is healed thank you Lord I don't know brother Robert but I promise you whatever he did in this life he didn't earn that that was the grace of almighty God that's God's Almighty Grace to us that he would give himself looking unto Jesus thank you Lord the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame oh thank you Lord is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God who ha saved us saved us church he saved us called us with a ho holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace oh thank you Lord which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began that's Grace yes it is Paul would say for I'm the least of the Apostles I'm trying to get to a place before I close for I'm the least of the Apostles that I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God persecuted the Church of God what did Paul do to earn Grace come on what did Paul do to earn Grace when his daily job was to kill people like Seth coffee and Ben pu and Carla price what in the world did he do to earn Grace that's right but after he would say for I'm the least of the Apostles that am not me to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God he said but by the grace of God sir I am what I am oh yeah good but by the grace of God I am what I am when the pillar of fire became came over Paul and he said it's hard for you why are you kicking against the Pricks Paul why why are you fighting me Paul I've always loved you Paul I've always took Paul before the foundation of the world I knew you Paul he said to Jeremiah one time before you were ever I knew you when you were in your mother's well I already knew you and ordained you to be a prophet what did Jeremiah do to earn that what did he ever do to earn the privilege of being a prophet what did he ever do to earn the privilege that Millions upon millions of people would be able to read Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I think towards you yes we think of Peter I want you to think about this and realize what the grace of God will do in your life because listen Satan will always tell you you're not good enough you can never be good enough but Church what I'm trying to tell you listen absolutely live a holy life don't ever if you take if you if you somehow say hey Seth Seth we can do whatever you've missed it by a million miles you're not even hearing the same sermon that's right you're not even hearing the same servant sermon but Peter Peter we've all been Peter Peter Jesus comes to Peter and says Peter you're going to deny me and Peter begins to say God I will never how many times you told God I will never do that I don't know how that person did that but I will never do that God I will NE God I promise you and by the grace of God you may never do it but it's by the grace of God that's right but Peter said God I won't deny you and he said Peter before the crows you'll deny me Thrice and Peter's going how how will I deny God I've seen God do too much I've been in this too long I've seen 70 disciples walk away I I there's no way I've cast out evil spirits he gave me power to cast out evil spirit I've seen too many miracles but in the midst of his trial when he finds him himself at the gate after they've taken Jesus the very one that he said I'll even give my life for you but when they find him a woman says weren't you weren't you with him I don't know him I don't know him then another one speaks up you even speak like him you talk like him you were with him I don't know him when Jesus is over here getting hit you know what that was it's just like the buffer brother brandham talked about when brother brandham was judging that woman in that place that was sitting there right living in sin doing things she ought not about to be doing an old lady all dressed up with purple fingernails and and drunk as can be in there playing a slot machine and God and he said does my daughter have to grow up in this kind of world and he begins to and the angel of the Lord said come over here for a second and he began to look Beyond the Veil and he seen Jesus up there and there was sins that were going up trying to get to the throne of God but Jesus was standing right there and every time one of those sins would hit him it would jar Jesus and he would begin to say is that the sins of the world and he said no that's your sin but as Peter was sitting there looking at Jesus said I don't know him and the last time Jesus last time they say you were with him and Peter results back to his old ways and says well bleepity bleep bleep I don't know him and it says that Jesus looked across the room and looked at Peter you know what that was a buffer a buffer right there that Jesus was saying I know Peter but I'm doing this for you I'm doing this for you Peter I know you've got mistakes Glory I know you've done things wrong but this is my grace to you that's right and after his death burial and Resurrection he said these beautiful words go tell my disciples everyone else didn't think Peter was a disciple anymore everybody else had done for a God if he would have said go get my disciples Peter would have stayed at the table but he said go get my disciples and Peter isn't it amazing that in Tribulation he wouldn't forget about Peter in death he would not forget about Peter in Resurrection he would not forget about Peter no matter what we're going through no matter where we find ourselves he said in Isaiah he said a mother has a better chance of forgetting her child than he does to forget about you we didn't earn that we don't deserve that that's Grace he said our names are inscribed on the palm of his hands he cooked a meal for Peter and had P Peter Run Fly jump out of a boat and come swimming to him and he said Peter do you love me he said you know I love you Lord that's what the grace of God can do it can take a liar that'll look God in the face and and say I don't know him I don't know him but on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ and the grace of almighty God can cling someone up so much to make him the spokesman on the day of Pentecost that's the grace of God that we have in our lives I'm going trying to I'm trying to close when I think of Abraham and all the mistakes that he made and Moses and his mistake but musicians come but but when Abraham's commentary was written when the Divine commentary was written was Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no never was even accounted unto him he said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God even though we can read in the Bible where Abraham staggered at the promise of God but in God's mind under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the grace of almighty God he would begin to speak to his Prophet Paul and when Paul would go into that vision and Paul would see Abraham he couldn't see his mistakes one time there was a woman that made a mistake and they asked brother brandom what did she do and he said listen brother what's under the blood of Jesus Christ even a prophet can't see Hallelujah my humble prayers is before the grace of God that's here this morning I hope mine's wrote like that he won't see my mistakes that when my commentary is written in my obituary that he won't read how that I made mistakes and done wrong but he'll only see the things that I tried to do for him what does that he'll take the grace of God that I believe in and that's where I'm solely trusting for upon my merits I could no more go in than none of the rest but upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's Grace that I'm depending on right Hallelujah blessed is he that God will not impute sin I'll say this in close last thing I'm saying but this is the point that I wanted to get to through all that brother brandham tells a story of a little Hunter named Gabe he was a black brother down in Louisiana and they tried everything they could he had he had good influences a good mother a good father to try to influence him to give his heart to the Lord he never would do it he had a problem with gambling but he loved to hunt and old Gabe couldn't hit nothing Gabe couldn't hit n a terrible shot and he said one day he was going through the woods the pastor asked him to go hunting on Saturday Gabe had all this game that the Lord had given him he had all this game and he knew that he couldn't hit nothing but he was walking and the sun was setting and he turned around and he looked at that Sunset and he looked at all that game he tears down his eyes and he went to the pastor and he tapped him on the shoulder and he said pastor tomorrow morning I'm going to go to the Altar and I'm going to give my heart to the Lord and I'm going to be committed and dedicated to God and he he turned around he said Gabe what what sermon did I preach what song did you hear what what made you make this decision and he said I turned around and looked at the Sun and I looked at all that game and he said I seen the sun of my life was setting and he said I've seen all this game and he said you know I can't hit nothing you know I I I can't hit nothing I'm a terrible shot he said but if God would give me all this game and would think that much of me he must love me to give me this because I can't get this game on my own and if he loves me I want to serve him all the days of my [Music] life I think we forget too quickly The Sovereign Grace in our life we have a place to worship we have family friends food heartbeat in our chest L lungs that breathe air good health I read that today brother Brad and I thought about how God gave you that deer on this trip Brad always says I'm a terrible shot I take after Pepa Wayne but you know Brad was going to hunt somewhere else but he had a little problem in his leg so he used a different stand that faced him in a different direction and that deer ran right by him where all the other deer were coming behind him but the deer that he wanted ran right by him because God cared enough about Brad to give Brad that deer biggest deer that he's ever killed in his life because God's grace therefore he said my grace is sufficient to thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities knowing that the power of Christ May rest upon me how he thankful for his grace I'm sorry if I held you too long but that one was
