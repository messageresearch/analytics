[0:00] laughs
[0:07] well hopefully everybody enjoy it I
[0:08] think it's fun I like doing this kind of
[0:10] stuff so I guess it's turned out a
[0:12] budget to me
[0:15] we don't do it like we used to me and
[0:16] Jen used to really
[0:19] really kick out and track it daily
[0:25] so she said
[0:30] she said I'm good
[0:31] okay all right
[0:32] so we're gonna pick back up where we
[0:34] left off
[0:35] um
[0:36] so I'll kind of I'll be able to control
[0:38] the screen a little bit so we will have
[0:40] PowerPoints up you can take the camera
[0:41] off me if you want put it on the slides
[0:43] but
[0:44] so I'll kind of do a quick review
[0:48] so we talked about last time about the
[0:51] the master coming to three individual
[0:53] servants and he gave one five talents he
[0:55] gave one I think two and then the other
[0:57] one he gave one and so
[1:00] and this is directly after the
[1:03] the parable on the ten virgins with oil
[1:06] five width five without they sold there
[1:08] so
[1:10] um you know this was to me is pretty
[1:12] important in the in the scripture what
[1:13] we're what we're looking at here and
[1:15] and again what you've got to remember is
[1:18] financial peace is great but there's
[1:20] nothing like the peace that Christ gives
[1:23] you which is the peace that past all
[1:25] understands so you should never try to
[1:26] overpower that piece with this one okay
[1:29] so you've always got to fall in line
[1:31] with that first you know it's it's it's
[1:32] everything falls under that but this
[1:34] does give you an additional added peace
[1:36] with that but we went through that
[1:38] scripture
[1:39] and we titled this good and faithful
[1:41] servant so what God gives us we want to
[1:43] be faithful with
[1:45] and I think I'm put in there you know if
[1:46] you can't manage ten dollars you can't
[1:48] manage ten thousand so if you're not
[1:49] faithful in the least you can't be
[1:51] faithful in the whole okay
[1:52] so
[1:54] we we went through that
[1:56] he gave into one five gave him to one
[1:58] two gave into one one and so we know the
[2:01] the servant with five went and
[2:03] multiplied it
[2:04] five times over the servant with two
[2:06] doubled his and then I think the one
[2:08] with one Talent went and buried it and
[2:10] did nothing with it and so you know
[2:13] we're supposed to be faithful in the
[2:16] things that we do and I did have someone
[2:17] reach out to me it's pretty cool you
[2:19] know they were like well you know we
[2:20] have a little money and you know we we
[2:22] have it stashed back and they they
[2:23] listen to the seminar and you know that
[2:26] you know in that scripture the master
[2:28] says you know you should at least
[2:30] um had gained usury on it so which is
[2:32] interest and so they actually went and
[2:35] did that so just it's the little things
[2:37] that add up and and pay off in the end
[2:39] so
[2:40] um money management is a long game and
[2:42] I'm just going to do this quick review
[2:43] real quick it's it's a long game it's
[2:46] not something that you can do and just
[2:48] snap your fingers and overnight be like
[2:50] okay we got this we're good this is
[2:53] something that takes time and it takes
[2:54] consistency so don't think that tomorrow
[2:57] you're going to be like oh we got
[2:59] everything under control this is going
[3:00] to be a time thing and it's going to
[3:02] take you some time
[3:03] money management is not hard mentally
[3:05] you know it's really a two plus two game
[3:07] it's a two minus two game if you got
[3:10] five dollars and you spend six you're
[3:12] negative one dollar if you got five and
[3:13] you spend four you got one dollar okay
[3:15] so it's not a hard mental game but it is
[3:18] an emotional game and most of the
[3:19] spending that we do really is emotional
[3:22] you know if you look at the ads that pop
[3:24] up on Facebook and Instagram you know
[3:26] they've got an algorithm to see what
[3:27] you're looking at they know what you
[3:28] want you know it's hunting season for me
[3:30] and all that's popping up on my feed
[3:31] right now is hunting boots so that's
[3:33] what I'm looking at it's what I want
[3:34] they know that's what I want and so
[3:36] that's what they're giving me so
[3:38] um
[3:39] again going over we went over last time
[3:41] with married couples
[3:42] unfortunately this doesn't work if just
[3:44] one of you are on board you both have to
[3:46] be on board so if one of you is kind of
[3:49] driving and pushing this and the other
[3:50] one's not unfortunately it's not going
[3:52] to work
[3:53] things may get better but the overall
[3:56] plan will not will not work unless
[3:58] you're both on board
[4:01] and I put in here a quote that we read
[4:02] last time
[4:04] if you're not happy with what you have
[4:05] now why would you be happy with more of
[4:07] it so remember gratitude and
[4:10] gratefulness is is the best attitude
[4:12] that you can have because a lot of
[4:14] people look at as getting money
[4:17] as well I get money and you want to be
[4:19] greedy but the overall goal of this
[4:21] remember is not to be greedy not to not
[4:23] to store up and just for us but it's to
[4:25] it's to become financially free and then
[4:26] we're able to give and able to give back
[4:28] to those in need so
[4:30] um remember that we're going to go over
[4:32] the baby steps one more time
[4:35] and kind of just go over that and then
[4:37] we're going to work on today is just
[4:39] budgeting so just how to do
[4:41] a standard month-to-month budget okay
[4:43] does anybody have any questions from
[4:44] last time
[4:45] anything
[4:46] all right
[4:48] so again
[4:50] the seven baby steps
[4:52] so the first one is to save a thousand
[4:54] dollars the second one is to pay off all
[4:56] debt
[4:57] step three save three to six months of
[4:59] expenses for emergency
[5:01] step four is invest fifteen percent of
[5:02] your income for retirement five is safer
[5:05] college for your children if you want to
[5:07] I'm a little leeway on that I really
[5:09] hope mine don't go to college but
[5:11] I'm hoping we have some other options by
[5:13] then number six is pay off the house and
[5:15] seven is build wealth and give and so
[5:20] let's talk about maybe step one real
[5:21] quick and then we'll jump into the
[5:22] budgeting so saving a thousand dollars
[5:24] the easiest and quickest way to do this
[5:26] is sell stuff that you don't need find
[5:28] stuff around the house that you don't
[5:29] use sell it build that up really really
[5:31] quick
[5:32] second you want to pay off all debt we
[5:34] went over this last time you used What's
[5:35] called the snowball method you take your
[5:37] smallest debt okay so let's say you've
[5:39] got 500 on a credit card it's forty
[5:42] dollars a month and you maybe have three
[5:44] other credit cards and a car payment
[5:46] you list those out greatest to smallest
[5:48] okay and it's not payment amount the
[5:50] smallest is the balance okay we're going
[5:52] off the balances all right so we've got
[5:54] a credit card you owe 500 on monthly
[5:57] payments 40. we do our budget we've got
[5:59] an extra eighty dollars in the budget or
[6:01] an extra hundred dollars in the budget
[6:02] all that extra money
[6:04] goes to that debt okay after you pay off
[6:08] that debt which was 500 which had a
[6:10] monthly balance of 40 then that 100 you
[6:13] have left over in your budget plus the
[6:15] 40 now goes to the next step so now
[6:17] you're paying 140 extra on that and so
[6:20] as you see you pay off that debt maybe
[6:21] say it was a hundred dollars a month
[6:23] well now you have two hundred and forty
[6:24] dollars freed up in your budget you
[6:26] continue that on and you see that's why
[6:28] they call it a snowball it continuously
[6:29] gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
[6:31] bigger and bigger So eventually after
[6:32] you pay off those debts
[6:34] you know you maybe have a three extra
[6:36] three hundred dollars on the budget
[6:37] extra four extra five you're throwing
[6:39] that on dead and it just kind of
[6:40] snowballs from there
[6:42] um after you do that you save three
[6:44] months three to six months expenses for
[6:46] all emergencies
[6:48] um
[6:49] the way that you figure this out is you
[6:51] go over you look at your year from last
[6:53] year and we'll go over how to budget in
[6:55] this and how to figure up you know some
[6:57] of you self-employed people
[6:59] um maybe you have side jobs different
[7:01] things I'm gonna I'm gonna go over all
[7:02] that how you figure out all this how you
[7:04] figure this all out
[7:05] saving three to six months expenses
[7:08] you go out and you look at your total
[7:10] last year if you can if things have
[7:12] changed you've gotta you gotta Factor
[7:13] those in
[7:14] but let's say your monthly expenses are
[7:16] around say three thousand dollars
[7:19] okay that's that's 36 000 a year that it
[7:21] costs you to live and So within that
[7:23] let's say that your house payment
[7:25] insurance
[7:26] gas groceries you want to plan to buy
[7:29] new clothes plan to buy new tires once a
[7:31] year oil changes for your vehicles you
[7:34] want to go on vacation so you budget all
[7:36] this out
[7:37] and so
[7:39] you do that and then you're going to
[7:40] figure out how much that is factored
[7:42] over the year and so let's say it's
[7:43] three thousand so that means you got to
[7:45] put nine thousand in a savings account
[7:46] now this is not money that you invest so
[7:48] you don't put this in Investments this
[7:50] is money that you can go and grab
[7:51] immediately okay this is money you can
[7:53] go and get it goes in a savings account
[7:55] money market something like that
[7:57] you want again you want to earn as much
[7:58] interest as you can on this money you
[8:01] know but this is not checking account
[8:02] money we all know if we put money in our
[8:04] checking account it magically disappears
[8:07] step four is invest 15 of your income
[8:09] for retirement now
[8:11] I did have several people reach out to
[8:13] me
[8:14] um self-employed people or people that
[8:15] work for employers that don't offer
[8:17] retirement plans and this is very very
[8:19] common where we live you just need to go
[8:22] find a financial advisor and figure out
[8:23] how to start investing
[8:25] um for retirement but remember you don't
[8:27] do any of these steps until the one
[8:29] previous above it is completed okay
[8:32] um
[8:34] save for college for your children I'm
[8:36] really hoping mine want to start their
[8:38] own business or work for themselves or
[8:40] you know invest in rental houses or
[8:42] something that they can do that they
[8:43] don't have to do that but if they if
[8:45] they end up being really smart like
[8:46] their mom they might be okay at college
[8:49] and they can they can go off and do it
[8:51] fortunately if they get my brain they're
[8:52] going to struggle they got put on
[8:54] academic suspension and academic
[8:56] probation in college by the way
[8:58] still turned out okay got kicked out of
[9:00] college for my my brain
[9:02] see it all worked out in the end right
[9:05] nobody left I really thought I'd get
[9:07] some laughs off of that all of you
[9:08] expected they were like no we expected
[9:10] you to get kicked out of college we we
[9:12] fully expected it
[9:14] yeah I guess it was academic probation
[9:15] first then academic suspension
[9:18] but they let me back in and I finished
[9:19] and got my degree in something that I
[9:21] don't even work in anymore so praise the
[9:23] Lord step six is pay off the house step
[9:26] seven is build wealth and give again we
[9:28] are not doing this to be greedy we're
[9:30] doing this to give back I believe the
[9:33] the scripture that we read last time I'm
[9:34] not going to go back through those
[9:35] because we just we just don't have
[9:36] enough time
[9:38] a wise man leaves an inheritance to his
[9:40] children's children so you know the goal
[9:42] is to create a generational wealth we
[9:45] can get our families ahead in life again
[9:46] it is not to be
[9:50] um just rich and have all this money and
[9:52] not and not be
[9:53] giving with it so the next slide
[9:57] so we're going to go over what what a
[9:59] budget is
[10:00] a budget tells you what you can do not
[10:02] what you can't do
[10:04] okay so a budget is a guy to tell you
[10:07] what you have the power to do most
[10:09] people look us at a budget and they say
[10:10] well this is going to tell me everything
[10:11] that I cannot do that's not it it tells
[10:14] you what you can do so you know if you
[10:16] like energy drinks and you want to spend
[10:19] 379 a day on it five days a week you
[10:22] need to put that in your budget
[10:24] all right so if I want to spend 20 a
[10:26] week on energy drinks I just put simply
[10:28] put that in my budget make sure I plan
[10:30] for it a budget is about planning okay
[10:32] and so I did
[10:34] um like anyone else good would do I went
[10:37] and isolated a quote in the in the
[10:39] message and I got this from Brother
[10:40] random in 1952 and I'm just kidding
[10:42] about isolating a quote but he said
[10:44] we're never out to receive Finance never
[10:46] and he's talking about going overseas on
[10:47] a mission trip he says if I ever get
[10:49] that in my mind God help me to act
[10:51] gentleman enough about me to walk off
[10:53] the field and pray through till God gets
[10:54] my heart right with him again see it's
[10:56] not that he said but we're a little bit
[10:58] desperately needy now he said it's true
[11:00] he said because I was out of service for
[11:01] about seven months
[11:03] I went several hundred dollars in debt
[11:05] and I've got to get that up he said then
[11:07] I've got to make up my budget for
[11:08] overseas where I'll know of it where I
[11:11] know a vision is calling me and he says
[11:12] I believe when it's all made up then God
[11:15] will let me go so look at how important
[11:17] the budget was to him you know he did
[11:18] not even want to go overseas until that
[11:20] budget was made because he didn't want
[11:21] to waste God's people's money is that
[11:23] right so it appears to be him he wasn't
[11:25] even going to go on the mission trip
[11:26] until that budget was made and set and
[11:28] what he needed to do over there so I
[11:31] think if the prophet was careful with
[11:33] God's children's money God's children
[11:35] should be careful with their money as
[11:36] well so I found that quote he only
[11:38] mentions budget about five times in the
[11:40] scripture excuse me in the message
[11:43] but when he does he's usually dealing
[11:44] with with a mission trip
[11:46] or they were building I think for a
[11:48] church fund he talks about that and then
[11:51] one other place he was talking about
[11:52] another another mission trip so
[11:55] um
[11:56] again some quotes a budget tells your
[11:58] money where to go instead of wondering
[12:00] where it went so
[12:02] I think Dave Ramsey talks about this a
[12:04] lot that's actually a quote from Dave
[12:05] Ramsey and
[12:06] he talks about this a lot is is every
[12:09] dollar is like a little soldier and
[12:10] you're going to tell it what to do so
[12:12] every dollar is an employee to you and
[12:15] you see that you tell it well this one's
[12:16] going to go here this one's going to go
[12:17] here and a lot of what I'll show you
[12:19] today is called a zero balance budget
[12:23] um
[12:24] this scares a lot of people my wife's
[12:25] not a big fan of it sometimes but what
[12:28] it is is at the end of the month you
[12:29] balance out at zero to having no money
[12:31] left but you tell that money to go into
[12:34] savings you tell the extra money to go
[12:36] here and go here and go there it is a
[12:39] little difficult because it doesn't give
[12:40] you much leeway for error
[12:42] you know so let's say you've got
[12:45] 300 budgeted for groceries
[12:48] and you've got fifty dollars budgeted
[12:51] for eating out and you you go 25 over
[12:53] budget so you went 75 well you got to
[12:55] pull that money from somewhere else it
[12:56] doesn't magically just appear at the
[12:58] bottom line so you got to go pull that
[12:59] from another budget because you're
[13:01] working with your total monthly income
[13:04] so used correctly a budget doesn't
[13:07] restrict you it empowers you and it
[13:09] really does
[13:10] it's hard
[13:11] it's it's hard to get on a budget but
[13:13] once you start it really does let you
[13:15] know it kind of gives you that peace of
[13:16] mind where you're like you know
[13:18] I know where this money's going I know
[13:19] where it's coming from and it just kind
[13:21] of makes everything fall in line there
[13:24] um I did this quote in two it was from
[13:26] an unknown author but it says more money
[13:27] can't fix bad spending habits so I think
[13:30] we talked about that a little bit last
[13:31] time
[13:32] is
[13:35] the more you make or you know a lot of
[13:37] people make a lot of money but it's not
[13:39] about how much you make it's about how
[13:40] much you keep right you know so somebody
[13:42] making a quarter of a million dollars a
[13:44] year and spending a quarter million
[13:45] dollars a year and then someone making
[13:46] 30 000 a year and spending twenty
[13:48] thousand at the end of the year they
[13:49] actually the lower income individual has
[13:51] more money than the high income earner
[13:54] so
[13:55] um always always remember that's how
[13:57] much money you keep okay here's simply
[13:59] the definition of a budget it's estimate
[14:01] of income and expenditure for a set
[14:03] period of time we are going to do our
[14:05] budgets based off of a monthly time
[14:08] period okay
[14:10] I did we will get into self-employed
[14:12] people here in a minute and kind of talk
[14:14] about how they need to do their income
[14:15] because it is very difficult for a
[14:17] self-employed income or self-employed
[14:19] individual to balance theirs over a year
[14:24] so your budget needs to be completed
[14:25] monthly and checked weekly and in some
[14:27] cases daily so it depends on where you
[14:30] are
[14:30] in the baby steps and how often you need
[14:33] to be checking in with your budget
[14:34] the main thing again with couples
[14:36] because most of the people here are
[14:37] married couples
[14:39] you've got to be on the same team okay
[14:41] if you're an individual that's great
[14:43] it's you no one else you can sit down
[14:45] and you kind of can hold yourself
[14:46] accountable but a husband and wife you
[14:49] both got to be on the same page okay
[14:50] just remember that it won't work House
[14:53] Divided will not stand
[14:55] so
[14:57] um
[14:58] it's good to plan for the year or even
[15:00] three or five years but your budget
[15:02] needs to be completed monthly so I'm
[15:04] really big in setting setting goals you
[15:07] know so you have something to strive for
[15:09] so you should set a one-year goal where
[15:11] you're going to be in a year
[15:13] um
[15:13] and again to me this is really fun you
[15:15] can sit down with a calculator and you
[15:16] can see where you're going to be
[15:17] financially
[15:18] um you can and that's with nothing going
[15:21] wrong and those changes as you go
[15:22] through the year
[15:24] um but but it's very very fun now you're
[15:26] going to prepare your budget on your net
[15:28] income which is Tech take home pay okay
[15:30] so we're not doing it off the gross
[15:32] like everybody else you know like the
[15:34] government and all that it's not gross
[15:36] this is your take-home pay so this is
[15:37] cash that you have to work with Okay so
[15:39] remember that
[15:41] so let's go over
[15:43] um real quick income so I did this just
[15:45] simply for the math okay
[15:49] so let's say your bring home pay is 500
[15:51] a week okay let's average that over the
[15:54] year so we're going to take 500 times 52
[15:55] how many weeks are in a year we come out
[15:58] twenty six thousand okay twenty six
[16:00] thousand divided by 12 is
[16:02] 2166 dollars per month so your monthly
[16:04] income
[16:06] bring home pay is
[16:08] 2166 dollars now let's talk about
[16:10] self-employed individuals you need to
[16:12] use last year's income average that out
[16:15] over a monthly rate now I know some of
[16:17] you you're going to have more work in
[16:19] the winter or you're going to have more
[16:20] work in the summer but you still need to
[16:21] average it out over the year because you
[16:23] need to know what you're working with
[16:25] now so if the previous year's net income
[16:28] was thirty thousand you divide that by
[16:29] 12 you come up with your monthly income
[16:31] of twenty five hundred that's what you
[16:33] need to base your budget off of now if
[16:36] you're new to being self-employed you do
[16:38] not have your past history
[16:41] you do not have a set weekly income what
[16:43] you're going to do is your expenses
[16:45] should not be varying that much right
[16:47] your your life expenses should not be
[16:49] changing week to week one week you
[16:52] shouldn't have to spend you know a
[16:53] thousand dollars to live in the next
[16:55] week a hundred those should be kind of
[16:57] kind of set so and again your expenses
[16:59] which we'll go over here in a minute you
[17:01] should know what those are going to be
[17:03] based off of the next month right
[17:06] so you would figure your expenses at a
[17:08] monthly rate and your income at a weekly
[17:10] rate okay
[17:12] so
[17:13] what it is is you plan your budget for
[17:15] the month
[17:16] and then week one say you make 750 but
[17:20] then week two you make 375. you factor
[17:23] that out over the month and you just
[17:24] check your budget weekly
[17:26] so it's like where am I at now so I can
[17:28] know where I'm going to be next week
[17:29] okay
[17:31] this is tedious but it is necessary
[17:35] so I don't put giving under expenses
[17:37] that'll come next but this should be the
[17:39] first thing that we look at doing
[17:42] um tithing I put 10 percent
[17:44] if you have any questions talk to your
[17:46] pastor don't ask me about tithing
[17:47] because I will not instruct you on
[17:49] tithing offering if you're given simply
[17:51] to receive then you're doing it wrong so
[17:54] the thought here is not to just give so
[17:56] that I get back I'm going to give this
[17:57] and God's going to bless me now that's a
[18:00] good thought to have that's the belief
[18:02] that you should have that's the faith
[18:03] that you should have but you should give
[18:04] without wanting to receive right if
[18:07] you're giving to receive that's not a
[18:08] gift that's a trade it's like I'll trade
[18:10] God five dollars for health you know
[18:12] that's a trade it's not how this works
[18:15] like well I'm gonna give my wife a back
[18:17] row but she's giving me one after I give
[18:19] her one that's just a trade you know
[18:23] man
[18:24] Stone Cold faces in the audience tonight
[18:27] so you'll never out give God but you
[18:30] need to track it and plan for it okay
[18:33] you got it all y'all are like
[18:36] she still hasn't given me that back rub
[18:37] back this is not a fair trade
[18:40] but that's what a gift is right you know
[18:42] if I was if Stewart gave me 12 arrows
[18:45] he's like hey I want to give you these
[18:46] and then I gave him 100 bucks back
[18:48] that's just a trade it's not a gift okay
[18:51] so
[18:53] tithing talk to your pastor offering set
[18:56] in your budget know what it's going to
[18:57] be and follow it okay now there's going
[18:59] to be times where maybe a special
[19:02] Minister come through or the pastor asks
[19:04] you to give to a certain thing then you
[19:06] do that as you feel led right and then
[19:08] you go back and adjust the budget and
[19:09] say well I took an extra 20 30 40 50 100
[19:12] out of this I'm going to calculate it
[19:14] out of this and so
[19:16] you know we decided to give to a
[19:17] missionary so we're not going to eat out
[19:18] this month we're gonna do something else
[19:20] okay well it's pretty pretty easy to do
[19:24] um always give without remembering and
[19:27] always receive without forgetting I
[19:29] thought that was a really really cool
[19:30] quote that I had
[19:32] um logged back so always give without
[19:33] remembering which means don't give to
[19:36] receive you're not giving this so that
[19:37] people know what you did or so that even
[19:39] you know what you did and then always
[19:40] receive without forgetting so when
[19:42] you're blessed remember that okay
[19:44] Malachi 3 8 I threw this scripture in
[19:47] there because I think I mentioned it in
[19:48] the previous one will a man rob God he
[19:51] says yet you have robbed me but you say
[19:54] wherein have we robbed thee and he said
[19:56] in ties and offerings so you know the
[19:59] Viewpoint a lot of people like well you
[20:00] know I'm I've got to pay my tithes
[20:02] that's my duty to God but you also want
[20:04] to pay and actually give an offering as
[20:07] well I believe the more that you give
[20:09] the more that God will bless you but
[20:10] again if you give if you give with the
[20:12] attitude that you're going to receive
[20:13] you're given in the wrong Spirit and the
[20:15] wrong the wrong mindset right
[20:17] so next we're going to talk about his
[20:19] savings
[20:21] so the emergency fund Jen and I
[20:25] still use the emergency fund
[20:28] um all the time so what what we do is
[20:32] even though we have
[20:33] you know I think we're on baby step six
[20:35] even though we have the the money over
[20:37] here
[20:39] in a different account that we have set
[20:41] up the way that we use the emergency
[20:43] fund is is say if we're running through
[20:45] the week and and maybe we're going to
[20:46] come up short or or we need extra money
[20:48] for something that that is planned we
[20:51] pull from that thousand dollars so I
[20:52] always keep that emergency fund tied to
[20:54] my checking where I can get to it very
[20:56] very quickly
[20:57] um
[20:58] you know you can even set it up
[21:00] automatically as a sweep into your
[21:01] account that if you go under a certain
[21:02] amount you can pull over from it
[21:04] but then the way I have it set up is I
[21:06] give I think it's like 45 dollars a week
[21:09] is directly deposited into that fund so
[21:12] when it gets over that a thousand when
[21:13] it gets up a couple hundred dollars I'll
[21:15] transfer that out and move it around
[21:17] but a lot of times you know if I have to
[21:19] use it it'll build back up very very
[21:21] quickly or it's usually right there but
[21:23] I try to keep an eye on that always try
[21:24] to keep that at a thousand so if you use
[21:27] the emergency fund
[21:29] redo your budget and build it back to a
[21:31] thousand you know this is kind of your
[21:33] rainy day fund
[21:34] and it's always going to rain at some
[21:36] time any of you who have lived in the
[21:39] last few years know that you're going to
[21:40] need some extra cash at some time to do
[21:43] something and again these are
[21:44] emergencies a vacation is non-emergency
[21:46] a birthday is not an emergency a new bow
[21:49] unfortunately is not an emergency the
[21:51] money is not for impulsive purchases
[21:54] right this is for immediate emergencies
[21:56] so an emergency is when your tire blows
[21:58] out
[21:59] our emergency is when something happens
[22:01] wrong with the car an emergency is when
[22:03] you have to take your kid to the
[22:04] emergency room and health insurance
[22:05] covers this but you got a hundred dollar
[22:07] copay or whatever it is those are
[22:10] emergencies okay
[22:12] a vacation is not a new purse it's not
[22:14] an emergency nothing is is an emergency
[22:16] okay
[22:18] a sale at your favorite store is not an
[22:21] emergency
[22:23] no one likes the budgeting part as much
[22:25] as
[22:26] the last one Jen asked me how the last
[22:28] one was like it went really really good
[22:30] and so she didn't get to come to it and
[22:32] so she's sitting on this one and it's
[22:34] not going very very good so everybody's
[22:36] just kind of like
[22:39] but tell me what to do with my money
[22:43] and husband's wife you'll have that
[22:44] conversation when you start budgeting
[22:47] especially if you're a dual income so
[22:49] get ready for that one
[22:52] nobody yep all right
[22:54] expenses let's go over expenses I'm
[22:56] trying to get people to lighten up just
[22:58] Just a Touch
[22:59] so I kind of listed out expenses now
[23:01] these are going to vary for each family
[23:02] right
[23:04] some of you are going to have different
[23:05] fees you may have an HOA fee I've never
[23:08] lived in a nice enough place to have
[23:10] homeowners association so you know some
[23:12] of you are going to have different fees
[23:13] but you need to budget those in whatever
[23:14] those fees are
[23:16] you're also going to have annual fees
[23:17] and what I like to do is if I have a big
[23:19] annual fee I factor it out over the
[23:21] month
[23:22] okay so like if I have
[23:23] my gas bill we use propane to heat the
[23:27] house our hot water heater runs off
[23:28] propane
[23:29] so you know I buy that I think I buy it
[23:31] about once a year and it's about four or
[23:34] five six hundred dollars but you want to
[23:36] factor that out over the months okay so
[23:38] you know if it's if it's 600 you divide
[23:41] that by 12 you set aside that much money
[23:43] through the month now you don't need to
[23:44] leave it in checking account or it will
[23:45] get swallowed up in that set it aside
[23:47] open a different account put that in
[23:49] there so that you budget for it so but
[23:51] most typical families
[23:54] your expenses are going to be housing
[23:56] vehicle transportation food health
[23:58] insurance personal and debt so I do want
[24:03] to go over just a few things
[24:05] with you now
[24:07] again a lot of this is
[24:09] a matter of opinion and I have a lot of
[24:11] people get mad at me when I talk about
[24:13] vehicles or homes or amounts or any of
[24:15] that and it's okay to be mad at me it's
[24:18] not going to bother me at all
[24:19] so when I tell you this it doesn't mean
[24:21] that you need to go and just well this
[24:22] is what Alan said and brother Ben put
[24:24] him up here so we've got to follow it
[24:26] you know blindly no that's not the case
[24:29] all I'm telling you is the average that
[24:31] is factored out for for us this is what
[24:34] we should do
[24:35] so
[24:37] mortgage rent this this is the we're
[24:39] going to go into the housing so we're
[24:40] going to individualize all these items
[24:42] in our budget we're going to go over
[24:43] those so for housing
[24:45] usually first is mortgage or rent right
[24:48] you got your home payment or your rent
[24:51] the payment should never exceed 25 of
[24:54] your take-home pay so this is where a
[24:55] lot of people get mad
[24:57] that doesn't mean that if you have if
[24:58] you pay more than 25 your take-home pay
[25:00] that you need to go and sell your house
[25:01] and do something really really crazy
[25:03] you obviously need to get guidance but
[25:06] you shouldn't have a house payment or
[25:08] rent that's more than 25 percent of your
[25:09] take-home pay so this individual that
[25:11] we're going to do a budget on
[25:13] we've already done their income they
[25:14] make 500 a week bring home pay
[25:17] 25 of the 2166 which is their monthly
[25:20] income net income is 541.50 that
[25:24] individual should not get a house
[25:26] payment or rent higher than that okay
[25:29] now this is just you know this person
[25:33] that we're doing this Budget on I gave
[25:35] them a credit card payment an auto
[25:36] payment and a house payment
[25:38] so you may not have an auto payment you
[25:40] may not have a credit card payment then
[25:41] you can squeeze a little bit more into
[25:43] your mortgage and rent so remember this
[25:44] is not set in stone but these are good
[25:47] things to remember so the way that I did
[25:50] mine and Jenny's when we were looking at
[25:52] this we wanted to do a 15-year mortgage
[25:54] it had a better rate now the payment was
[25:56] double it was practically actually it
[25:59] was about 75 percent more
[26:01] and so that's good
[26:04] but at that time I think Jen was still
[26:06] working in nursing I was working still
[26:08] and I think I was even embalming on the
[26:10] side
[26:10] so that payment wasn't that bad now when
[26:13] Jen quit nursing and went full time at
[26:15] our business that changed a little bit
[26:17] that payment kind of increased a little
[26:19] bit so it's pretty high now it's still
[26:20] not over 25 percent of my take-home pay
[26:22] but that's something you want to pay
[26:23] attention to okay so like if you do have
[26:25] a dual income or or you're wanting to
[26:28] slow down on your workload you want to
[26:31] kind of be thinking about that in the
[26:32] future like you know do I want to pay
[26:34] for this for 30 years or 15 years so the
[26:36] goal is to get a 15-year mortgage
[26:38] you're going to get a lower interest
[26:40] rate
[26:41] and the amount of interest that you'll
[26:42] pay over the life of the loan is going
[26:44] to be direct drastically less okay
[26:47] so
[26:49] um then next we have electric water gas
[26:52] trash internet phone Etc so now you
[26:55] could go through your budget and you
[26:57] figure out what you need for your house
[26:58] how much you need
[27:01] um you know some of you are not going to
[27:02] have a gas bill some of you may have
[27:04] natural gas instead of propane
[27:07] but the main thing when you're doing
[27:08] this is you want to make sure that you
[27:10] don't leave any stone unturned anything
[27:12] that you're going to have to pay for for
[27:13] that year you're going to want to make
[27:16] sure that you do so I've got an example
[27:19] for you
[27:20] if you bought a hundred and fifty
[27:21] thousand dollar house at six percent and
[27:24] you did a loan term of 30 years
[27:27] the total interest you'll pay over the
[27:28] life of the loan is a hundred and
[27:30] seventy four thousand that's the
[27:32] interest not including your payment not
[27:34] including your principal reduction
[27:36] Okay so
[27:37] so the 150 000 house that you bought you
[27:39] actually paid 324 000 for it over a
[27:42] thirty year
[27:43] so you paid a hundred and seventy four
[27:46] thousand interest if you do it on a
[27:48] 50-year loan you pay 77 000 in interest
[27:51] so you pay almost a hundred thousand
[27:53] dollars less than a year in just half
[27:54] the term so remember that when you're
[27:56] going into this interest is calculated
[27:58] over the balance
[28:00] daily interest is accrued daily it never
[28:02] takes vacation it never sleeps it is
[28:05] there always earning and accruing
[28:09] so it never stops but it's figured off
[28:12] your balance a lot of people have a have
[28:14] a problem with like well how am I paying
[28:15] this much this much this much
[28:17] interest is figured off your balances
[28:19] your balance is 150 your payment's 800 a
[28:21] month but 400 of that goes to interest
[28:23] your payment reduces your balance
[28:25] reduces by 400. 400 went to interest
[28:28] vanishes the other 400 goes to principal
[28:30] reduction you now owe 149 600 interest
[28:34] is now figured off of that
[28:36] and it slowly slowly slowly amortizes
[28:39] out
[28:40] FYI little lesson okay
[28:43] so those are your expenses for your
[28:45] housing
[28:46] next is vehicle and transportation
[28:50] so
[28:51] and I've got some information on
[28:53] vehicles in here that people are going
[28:54] to get mad at me about too but it's okay
[28:55] gas tires oil change and maintenance
[28:58] so me and Jen have been trying to figure
[29:01] out a way to buy a vehicle through our
[29:03] business because we do not want to go
[29:06] buy a vehicle because I've preached so
[29:08] hard against them but we want one so bad
[29:10] so we've been going back and forth on
[29:12] this for forever can we afford one yes
[29:14] 100 do we want to do that no we're very
[29:18] divided on it
[29:19] so you know
[29:21] we go back and forth I just want you to
[29:23] know how the struggle is like even
[29:25] though we have the money to do it it's
[29:26] it's hard to go and just say man I want
[29:28] to do I want to spend it on that though
[29:30] you know do I want to do I want to get a
[29:31] thousand dollar payment or do I want to
[29:34] travel two weekends a month or do I want
[29:36] to travel one weekend a month and you
[29:37] know so so there's there's these
[29:39] thoughts all the time no matter you know
[29:40] where you get in this financial piece
[29:43] program or where you get in this you're
[29:45] always going to have these challenges
[29:46] it's not just going to vanish to where
[29:47] you don't have to make decisions anymore
[29:50] But A good rule of thumb is and what
[29:53] we've come to because we've been talking
[29:54] about this for months now
[29:56] um you know finally the other day we we
[29:58] didn't have kids we sat down we kind of
[29:59] talked and you know we decided not to do
[30:01] it the next day we were both sending
[30:03] vehicles that we were finding online now
[30:05] we're probably not going to buy them but
[30:07] you're still going to go through these
[30:08] struggles it's not going to change any
[30:10] bit you're like well we don't have car
[30:11] payments and our cars work fine
[30:13] mine's a little loud and old and doesn't
[30:15] have a full-size Back Seat but it gets
[30:17] this from A to B hers you know we were
[30:19] talking to it's like
[30:21] he'll forget your new vehicle the kids
[30:22] are just going to destroy it anyways you
[30:24] know they've ripped our seeds they've
[30:25] just destroyed the vehicle destroyed it
[30:28] so these are things that you've got to
[30:30] think of right
[30:31] but you want to plan for gas Tire oil
[30:33] changes and maintenance I know people
[30:35] that will go get a new car so they want
[30:37] to put tires on it
[30:39] don't be that person
[30:41] change your oil maintenance your car
[30:45] these are very very important things for
[30:46] longevity of vehicles you know my
[30:49] vehicle is 20
[30:51] 24 years old
[30:53] Jens is right at 18 15 years old they
[30:56] run fine hers actually has more miles I
[30:58] think it's like 206 we had to have new
[31:00] wheel bearings put in and brakes and it
[31:02] was 900 bucks
[31:04] and that's a pretty expensive bill but
[31:05] that's better than a 900 monthly payment
[31:07] every month so you've kind of got to
[31:10] factor these out and say you know once
[31:11] you get that payment you've got sales
[31:13] tax you've got your insurance that's
[31:15] going to go up on a vehicle that's
[31:16] priced more if you get a loan on it
[31:18] you've got to have full coverage because
[31:20] the bank requires it you know there's
[31:22] all these little factoring things that
[31:23] kind of trickle into this okay but you
[31:25] need to factor for gas tires oil changes
[31:28] maintenance anything that's going to
[31:29] fall under that vehicle transportation
[31:30] okay
[31:31] all right food
[31:33] groceries restaurants you should not be
[31:36] eating out if you're not gracely greatly
[31:39] reducing your debt so a lot of people
[31:42] remember when me and Jen were doing the
[31:43] program we're pretty hard on this and um
[31:46] you know like if the church was going to
[31:48] McDonald's we wouldn't go
[31:49] we would just Skip and we'd go home and
[31:51] eat
[31:52] you know it just it just was what it was
[31:53] so it's not fun to maybe do this part I
[31:56] thought it was because I like my wife
[31:58] and I like being home so to me it's
[32:00] better than seeing any of you guys so
[32:01] you know I was fine with it
[32:03] but it doesn't work for everybody
[32:04] there's a lot of social people out there
[32:06] that that require that social
[32:08] interaction so now you should never
[32:10] recluse and pull away that's bad right I
[32:13] love all of you you're welcome in my
[32:15] house anytime
[32:17] after the fall of 2026 but you know
[32:22] this this is a hard part it's not as fun
[32:25] to go home and say eat a bologna
[32:27] sandwich when you have money that you
[32:29] could spend on eating out but that's why
[32:32] you've got to know the why we talked
[32:33] about this in the last one why do you
[32:35] want to do this and again I gave you my
[32:38] wife so I can spend more time with my
[32:39] family and have Financial Freedom where
[32:41] I can work for myself do whatever I want
[32:43] and so that's kind of my why so
[32:46] got 23 minutes left
[32:48] so I really highly wouldn't recommend
[32:50] eating out I've had people argue with
[32:52] this a lot of
[32:53] um what's really funny is I wasn't given
[32:55] this seminar about three or four times
[32:57] and I've done a lot of individuals
[32:58] one-on-one but somebody will always come
[33:00] back to me after this
[33:02] and tell me a better way
[33:03] what they're doing that's better than
[33:05] this
[33:06] so I can tell you I can't tell you what
[33:09] you're doing is better or worse I'm not
[33:11] going to get into that argument with you
[33:13] or or discuss that if you come up with
[33:15] me with something I'm just going to
[33:16] stand there and Nod my head and say
[33:18] that's crazy and then walk away
[33:21] I can tell you one thing this plan does
[33:23] work
[33:24] okay if you're not going to stick to the
[33:26] plan
[33:27] just don't stick to the plan but if
[33:29] you're gonna do it do it with your whole
[33:31] heart do it wholeheartedly and I promise
[33:33] you great things will happen
[33:35] so the next we're going to go to is
[33:37] Health since I own a gym I put a gym
[33:39] membership in here just if any of you
[33:41] want to give me money
[33:43] um but you got medicine gym supplements
[33:44] and doctor visits there's other things
[33:46] that fall within this
[33:48] so you should be thinking about that
[33:51] um I think
[33:53] if any of your if any of your employees
[33:55] offer an HSA account you need to be
[33:58] using it if they don't you can set one
[34:00] up through your bank easy peasy
[34:03] your HSA
[34:05] is deducted out of your gross different
[34:07] than other expenses so the government
[34:10] does not tax your HSA dollars the same
[34:12] way they tax your income dollars so you
[34:15] make this income and you actually say
[34:17] you give
[34:18] um
[34:19] me and Jen what I give
[34:21] I think I give a hundred dollars a week
[34:23] to HSA and if I was to just take that
[34:26] income the government would take like 40
[34:28] percent of it
[34:29] but instead they only take like 10 or 15
[34:32] it's a much lesser percentage so I get
[34:34] to keep that out now you can only use it
[34:36] for health related costs but the
[34:39] government does not tax it the same so
[34:40] they are very important to have
[34:42] you can build this up over time you can
[34:44] use it for long-term Health we use it
[34:47] for all of our co-pays
[34:50] um
[34:50] ER visits you get an HSA debit card you
[34:53] use it like that so if you don't have
[34:55] that you can set that up on your own
[34:57] okay if you do have it
[34:59] when you give to it you'll notice that
[35:01] your net doesn't change as much when you
[35:03] give to that okay
[35:04] so
[35:06] um
[35:07] I believe health is very important over
[35:09] the overall lifespan
[35:11] when you get older the better you took
[35:13] care of yourself at a younger age
[35:15] probably the better unless there's
[35:17] drastic health conditions the better
[35:18] you're going to be off in your older age
[35:21] all right next is insurance so we went
[35:25] over this last time
[35:26] health insurance I've been very
[35:28] fortunate that my employer or my wife's
[35:30] employer has always
[35:32] given health insurance benefits
[35:34] I understand that it's very very
[35:36] expensive if you do not have an employer
[35:39] that offers this I hear it's insanely
[35:40] expensive I know there's there's
[35:41] opportunities out there for others what
[35:44] I would do is reach out to a family
[35:45] that's similar to yours in size and
[35:47] location and see what they're doing
[35:50] figure out if there's
[35:51] um I think there's some families that do
[35:53] this Christian Medishare I think there's
[35:55] something that come through Obamacare
[35:57] that people can still tap into so look
[36:00] at all of those options it's very
[36:01] important to have health insurance if
[36:03] you can if you can get it for free or
[36:05] qualify for some kind of program go for
[36:07] that
[36:07] auto insurance anything that you do on
[36:10] you should have insured
[36:12] now
[36:13] um
[36:14] I was actually thinking talking about
[36:16] gin you know on my truck I don't think
[36:17] it's really if I went to sell it it's
[36:19] not worth much but I think I still have
[36:21] full coverage on it so maybe paying 75
[36:23] 80 a month when I could maybe pay 40
[36:25] because the insurance company's not
[36:27] going to give me that much anyways so if
[36:29] you know if I if it lasted another year
[36:30] I'm going to recoup my my losses in that
[36:33] monthly payment so
[36:35] you know could switch that from Full to
[36:37] liability so there's things like that
[36:38] but remember if you do that you're
[36:40] taking that risk to where they're not
[36:41] going to give you a dime for your
[36:42] vehicle so always make sure you have
[36:44] that factored right risk first reward
[36:47] life insurance we talked about this last
[36:50] time every head of household income
[36:53] producer should have term life insurance
[36:56] it is easy to do I think
[36:59] I have a million or more in coverage now
[37:01] it's a 20-year term okay so when I turn
[37:05] I think I got it when I was 30 this last
[37:07] time because we increased it maybe 30 32
[37:10] when I turned 52 it goes away now the
[37:13] insurance companies typically went on
[37:14] these because they they really do factor
[37:16] that you're going to live beyond that
[37:18] but if there was a catastrophic event a
[37:20] vehicle wreck something else any hunting
[37:23] accident anything like that they would
[37:25] pay and so you want to set this up to 10
[37:28] times if you bring home pay so if you
[37:31] make if you make fifty thousand dollars
[37:33] a year you want to have a term life
[37:34] policy insurance covering five hundred
[37:36] thousand dollars a year that way your
[37:37] wife
[37:38] does not have to go back to work
[37:40] for a good 10 years she can live
[37:43] continuously as she is for 10 years you
[37:45] should have it I think a million dollars
[37:47] coverage on me
[37:49] um my blood work's good my blood
[37:50] pressure is good my heart rate's good so
[37:52] the stuff that they did I think it was
[37:54] like 57 a month so to me it's worth
[37:57] having that so that that my family would
[38:00] be taken care of if I died homeowners
[38:02] insurance Etc so whatever types of
[38:04] insurance you have some of you
[38:06] self-employed people may pay for like um
[38:09] a Disability Policy through like Aflac
[38:12] or something like that you can buy those
[38:13] policies just make sure you budget for
[38:15] It Whatever It Is
[38:17] personal
[38:18] phones clothes Child Care entertainment
[38:21] subscriptions
[38:22] cut any subscription if you can
[38:24] restaurants date nights vacation Etc so
[38:27] this is where the budget remains fun you
[38:29] you plan for the things you're going to
[38:31] do so if you want to take your wife on a
[38:32] date once a week or once a month
[38:36] um just depending on how much she can
[38:37] stand to be around you you want to plan
[38:39] for this okay
[38:41] phones one thing that I've found is
[38:42] phones are so expensive I cannot tell
[38:47] you how much I want to overthrow ATT
[38:50] but
[38:51] the phone bills are just ridiculous
[38:54] try to find the best and the good thing
[38:56] is there's a lot of plans out there now
[38:58] that can get you similar to equal
[39:00] service for a lot less of the price and
[39:02] no contract try to find something like
[39:04] that especially if you're starting off
[39:07] you do not need
[39:08] 5G Wi-Fi coverage while you're driving
[39:12] down the road you know get what you need
[39:14] okay but but try to limit these you
[39:16] don't need every time they come out with
[39:17] a new phone you don't need to go get a
[39:19] new phone they're expensive they always
[39:20] lock you back into a contract
[39:22] you know if your phone breaks
[39:24] and it's a hundred dollars to get a new
[39:25] screen or they can set you up on a 27.99
[39:28] monthly payment plan for 36 months which
[39:30] one should you do
[39:32] 100 screen
[39:34] y'all should have been shouting it at me
[39:36] okay
[39:37] so you want to be thinking about these
[39:40] things okay these are things that you
[39:42] just you kind of ingrain in yourself and
[39:44] eventually you'll change and be a grouch
[39:46] like me when somebody tries to sell you
[39:47] something
[39:49] nobody left again
[39:51] so the phones close again I think I was
[39:54] telling Joel this you only need one belt
[39:56] it can be reversible if you want but you
[39:58] only need one belt
[40:00] you only got two feet you don't need a
[40:02] ton of shoes I'm sorry you just don't I
[40:05] have dress shoes
[40:07] work shoes weed eating shoes hunting
[40:09] boots and I do have two sets of hunting
[40:10] boots
[40:11] got me there I got two sets of hunting
[40:13] boots
[40:14] but remember this is not about the items
[40:17] you know we talked about last time you
[40:19] know I want you want to have an
[40:20] experienced you want to have a good fun
[40:23] life right that's what I want to have
[40:24] for for me and my family so to me it's
[40:26] not about the items you know it's not
[40:29] about those things so just try to limit
[40:30] those things and and buy necessity items
[40:35] um entertainment I know none of you have
[40:38] any music apps or Disney Plus or Netflix
[40:41] or YouTube none of y'all have that
[40:43] because we're in the message so if you
[40:44] do have it cut it
[40:45] subscriptions if you've got magazines
[40:47] subscriptions I don't even know who
[40:49] reads magazines anymore but cut them uh
[40:52] if you've got any subscriptions on your
[40:54] phone like games or apps or anything
[40:56] like that cut those things out okay
[40:58] budget for restaurant date nights
[41:00] vacations Etc so if you want to budget
[41:03] for a vacation you just figure out how
[41:05] much the vacation is going to cost
[41:06] whatever's left over in your budget you
[41:08] put to that okay now these are going to
[41:10] factor into the debt here in a little
[41:11] bit and then you plan that out okay
[41:14] um birthday parties are not
[41:16] a surprise we know what that's going to
[41:18] be
[41:19] we know that our kids are going to have
[41:20] one every year they're going to remind
[41:21] us about six months ahead of time so we
[41:23] can kind of plan for those things right
[41:25] at least my kids do
[41:28] um and what I do me and Jen do that I
[41:30] really like is we put um ten dollars a
[41:32] week into an account for our kids
[41:35] um it's automatically pulled out and we
[41:37] use that occasionally for birthdays
[41:38] Christmas sometimes it builds up this
[41:41] last time we went on vacation Jen
[41:43] doesn't even know this she just lets me
[41:45] do it but I took out 150 you know I took
[41:47] 50 out of each one we use that for them
[41:48] to have fun at the beach gas whatever it
[41:50] was wherever that money went it went to
[41:52] them going on vacation so so that's
[41:55] something cool that you can do and you
[41:56] just kind of have access to that money
[41:57] where birthday's Christmas whatever else
[41:59] it's not a surprise you can just jump in
[42:02] and do that now some of you got five
[42:04] seven kids that kind of adds up over the
[42:06] week if you're given ten dollars per
[42:07] child so you may need to factor that out
[42:09] pun intended for all the four family
[42:11] kids in here
[42:14] still only you got three so
[42:17] um so let's talk about debt here for a
[42:19] minute
[42:21] auto loans
[42:22] it's a good rule of thumb now again this
[42:24] is where people are going to yell at me
[42:25] and get mad at me and text me later
[42:27] but again
[42:29] this is just my opinion
[42:31] so you should never own Vehicles
[42:33] exceeding half your annual income now
[42:36] this is even if you're debt free or not
[42:37] debt free so if you make a hundred
[42:38] thousand a year your vehicle shouldn't
[42:40] be more than fifty thousand dollars now
[42:42] again what I tell people is if you're
[42:44] debt free you have the money to do it or
[42:46] you're not debt free and you have the
[42:47] money to do it do what you want to do I
[42:49] don't care
[42:50] okay if you if you like doing those
[42:52] things you should do them this is not
[42:54] for everyone
[42:55] this is for people who want Financial
[42:57] Peace
[42:58] they don't they don't want items or
[43:01] things they just want to live a little
[43:02] bit different they want to lay down at
[43:04] night and just kind of kind of breathe a
[43:05] little easier so and that doesn't mean
[43:07] the people that that have auto loans
[43:09] aren't right I've had them I've had them
[43:11] almost all my life I just don't have
[43:13] them now and have it for the last five
[43:15] or six years and don't want another one
[43:16] that's just me it's not for everybody so
[43:19] I mean we kind of want another one and
[43:22] when I say we I strongly mean my wife
[43:23] but
[43:24] I'm kind of there with her but again I'm
[43:28] not chopping any of you down if you've
[43:30] got one I think I showed y'all in the
[43:32] last and the last program that you know
[43:34] we had spent a hundred and
[43:36] 50 some thousand on vehicles in our
[43:39] first seven eight years of marriage so
[43:41] again this is not for everyone this is
[43:43] for for who wants to live just a little
[43:45] different okay
[43:46] so personal loans and credit cards now
[43:50] you're going to have debts that's fine
[43:52] so the next slide that I'm going to show
[43:54] you is going to be kind of an example
[43:55] budget now if any of you want me to sit
[43:59] down and do your budget with you it's
[44:00] kind of hard to see on the screen
[44:02] um if any of you want me to do that
[44:03] that's fine I will definitely do it for
[44:05] you
[44:06] um no charge but just know
[44:09] I'm going to be in there telling you
[44:10] what to do so you don't have to listen
[44:12] but that's just the that's just the UN
[44:15] unfun perk that comes with it
[44:17] so the monthly budget we did with
[44:19] someone who brought home 500 a week this
[44:21] is their net pay this is what they get
[44:23] paid
[44:24] and then I also added in an additional
[44:26] monthly income of 250 for a side job so
[44:28] let's say
[44:29] let's say you go do something once a
[44:31] weekend you go and clean gutters or you
[44:33] go mow a few yards or you go clean a
[44:35] house or you clean vehicles on the side
[44:37] whatever you do you get an additional
[44:38] 250 in income
[44:40] so the way you figure that is 500 times
[44:43] 52 so they're 52 weeks in a year
[44:46] it comes out to twenty six thousand
[44:47] divide that by 12 months in the year
[44:49] that comes up to 2166 dollars plus your
[44:52] 250 sign job gives you a net income
[44:56] 2416 okay
[44:58] so out of that I put the ties at 215
[45:01] offering at five or offering at 50. now
[45:04] these are monthly expenses you give as
[45:08] you fill in okay so this doesn't mean if
[45:11] you're giving 75 now you need to drop it
[45:13] to 50. brother Ben be getting on to me
[45:15] okay don't do that
[45:16] you give as you fill it okay I think I
[45:20] factored I don't remember how I factored
[45:21] the offering but it was like
[45:23] five or ten dollars every time we were
[45:25] in church I think it was five dollars
[45:26] it's 15 times a week I put 15 a week
[45:29] that you were given an offering you feel
[45:31] free to give three times that amount
[45:33] okay this was just a factor that I did
[45:36] I put their ex their expenses their
[45:38] mortgage and rent was 6.75.
[45:41] now that's over the 25 percent of their
[45:44] bring home pay so they're already off a
[45:46] little bit there
[45:48] electrics 125
[45:50] your electric fluctuates if any of you
[45:52] live through the summer of 2023 August
[45:55] and July electric bills were not fun
[45:58] I think my last one come in on August
[45:59] was 200 did not like it at all but it is
[46:03] what it is right
[46:05] water is 25 some of you have a well I
[46:08] don't have to factor in water if you
[46:09] have a well you don't have to factor in
[46:11] water either
[46:12] homeowners insurance auto loan credit
[46:14] card auto insurance term life insurance
[46:16] clothing groceries gas internet phone
[46:20] and so after you factor all these items
[46:22] out and I I did these pretty close to
[46:24] what they should be okay for someone
[46:26] making this amount of money
[46:28] having a house that would have a 675
[46:30] dollar payment I factored this out the
[46:32] best they could and so their balance
[46:33] remaining is 41 Okay so
[46:38] and you know a lot of you are like oh
[46:40] man well I have more than 41 dollars in
[46:41] the month some of you are like well I
[46:42] don't even have 41 dollars well
[46:44] it doesn't matter what you have left
[46:45] what you don't okay you're going to
[46:47] factor this to your lifestyle okay
[46:50] now what you do with that remaining
[46:52] forty one dollars does anyone want to
[46:53] tell me what you do with the rain 41
[46:55] dollars
[46:56] no
[46:58] do not treat yourself
[47:00] Allison
[47:02] you add it to the smallest debt okay and
[47:05] so so this forty one dollars let's see
[47:07] what our smallest debt is
[47:10] smallest dead is going to be the credit
[47:12] card
[47:13] it has a monthly payment of 45 and I
[47:16] think I gave them a balance of around
[47:17] 500.
[47:18] so that forty one dollars is going to go
[47:20] back into the budget until that gets
[47:22] paid off that debt is forty five dollars
[47:24] So at the end of this when that gets
[47:25] paid off
[47:26] you have eighty six dollars extra in the
[47:28] budget right now
[47:31] I'm thinking some of you are crafty
[47:33] you're going to find ways to cut the
[47:34] budget you're going to find things to
[47:35] sell that you don't need
[47:37] um
[47:38] one thing that I like to do is I like to
[47:40] scrap stuff I don't know how I find
[47:41] metal but I like scrap and stuff it's
[47:43] just fun going to the scrap yard
[47:46] you know I enjoy it I like I like scrap
[47:48] of metal you know last time I took a
[47:50] load I made like I don't know 270
[47:52] dollars
[47:53] took me a long time to do it but I loved
[47:55] it it was fun
[47:57] so find Nifty ways to make extra money
[47:59] and you're like
[48:01] man do I really want to put the time
[48:02] into that you know do I want to do these
[48:04] things that's again up to you what's
[48:06] your why why do you want to do this so
[48:11] as you go through and budget
[48:13] remember the budget is there to tell you
[48:15] what you can do what you not what you
[48:17] can't do now
[48:19] husbands and wives hear me well
[48:23] you don't want to come in let me tell
[48:25] you if you're trying to convince your
[48:26] spouse to do this if you come in guns
[48:28] blazing like this is what we're doing
[48:29] and you're going to submit yourself and
[48:31] we're going to do this it's not going to
[48:32] work
[48:33] it's not and most of the time it's the
[48:36] wife doing this to the husband it's not
[48:37] it's not the other way around
[48:39] unfortunately it's more that way so
[48:43] so just know the better that you can
[48:46] present this to them the better it's
[48:48] going to come across okay
[48:50] me and Jen did not always magically
[48:52] agree on money
[48:54] I think our first two or three years
[48:56] most of our fights were over money or
[48:58] her family that was it you know
[49:01] um
[49:03] this is why Jen doesn't come to these
[49:05] but
[49:07] but that's what it that's what it was
[49:08] and so
[49:10] they talk about divorces and the
[49:12] majority of divorces are over financial
[49:14] problems
[49:15] so a good way to limit these is to kind
[49:18] of plan for these now you're not going
[49:19] to always find a spouse that's going to
[49:21] fall into line with this you're just not
[49:22] some people are just not going to do it
[49:25] so what you've got to do then is just
[49:26] really get out on your knees and pray
[49:28] that God can change them and you do the
[49:30] best that you can right but I think if
[49:32] you can come together and you can agree
[49:33] on this
[49:35] it will drastically change your life
[49:36] it'll change your home life or how your
[49:38] kids perceive home life how they
[49:40] perceive giving and and all these things
[49:43] so you need to set the tone for your
[49:45] family but again you want to agree on
[49:48] these things when you come together to
[49:50] do your first budget there's going to be
[49:52] one person that wants to slash
[49:53] everything me and there's going to be
[49:55] one that wants to kind of put money
[49:57] where it should go like well we should
[50:00] put money to where we eat out once a
[50:02] week or once a month because we don't
[50:04] want to just alienate ourselves from
[50:05] everything and go home and eat rice and
[50:06] beans and not talk to anyone with the
[50:08] lights off you know that's not good
[50:09] either
[50:10] so can it be done sure would it be fun
[50:13] no but it can be done so you don't want
[50:15] to do those things you want to find that
[50:17] happy median so you don't want to come
[50:18] into your spouse and be like you know
[50:21] I know that you like coffee you got to
[50:24] quit
[50:24] that's just destruction waiting to
[50:26] happen if you tell your spouse they got
[50:28] a quick coffee
[50:29] be like Jen tell me not to drink energy
[50:31] drinks I'll be like you're kind of crazy
[50:32] you're creeping me out a little bit you
[50:34] know
[50:36] so you can't do those things and this is
[50:38] not this is definitely not marriage
[50:40] counseling
[50:41] but I will promise you your fights or if
[50:44] you do argue about money now this is
[50:46] going to fix 100 of those arguments
[50:49] excuse me the message we don't argue we
[50:51] discuss so this is going to fix those
[50:53] discussions
[50:54] got to throw that in our pastor has a
[50:56] perfect church we got five minutes
[50:57] before I kind of close this out does
[50:59] anybody have any questions or thoughts
[51:01] or or comments I know most people
[51:03] just hit me up after the the thing but
[51:06] if you if you have any questions right
[51:07] now I mean ask away
[51:09] but I'll give you time while I close it
[51:12] up
[51:13] the budget
[51:14] is set monthly you know what your
[51:17] expenses are going to be okay if you
[51:19] have an annual expense remember Factor
[51:21] it out over the month
[51:22] go get you if you have a big Bill that
[51:25] comes up at the end of the year
[51:27] and go open up a free checking account
[51:29] or a free savings account you don't want
[51:32] anything with fees you don't want paper
[51:33] statements you just want to put that
[51:35] money there and never touch it okay go
[51:38] do that put that money aside if you've
[51:40] got a big 500 tax bill that comes due at
[51:44] the end of the year or 250 whatever it
[51:46] is
[51:46] go set that money aside and do not touch
[51:48] it okay
[51:49] you know um
[51:52] if if you have if you have unknown
[51:55] income like let's say you are
[51:57] self-employed one thing that I've talked
[51:58] to several people about is once they get
[52:01] this
[52:02] um once they kind of get their life in
[52:05] line on the financial side self-employed
[52:07] individuals are able to go through those
[52:09] slower times because they have this
[52:11] additional cash set back for that they
[52:13] maybe paid themselves for that
[52:15] there's a really good book and I think
[52:17] me and brother Isaac were talking about
[52:18] it it's called the richest man in
[52:20] Babylon
[52:21] a lot of people won't read it because he
[52:23] doesn't give ties an offering but you
[52:24] can just read it and know you're going
[52:26] to give ties an offering but what he
[52:27] talks about in that book is paying
[52:29] himself first
[52:30] and so that's what I've tried to do and
[52:33] Jen and I have tried to do is is to
[52:36] always pay ourselves first now when I
[52:38] say that know that we pay God first
[52:39] right we give our 10 then we pay
[52:42] ourselves first so before I pay
[52:45] debt anything like that I've already got
[52:48] automatic transfers going into savings
[52:50] and then all of our retirement money
[52:51] plan going into the Investments
[52:54] so I can't I can't get my hands on that
[52:56] to spend it I've already paid it to
[52:58] where it goes somewhere where I can't
[52:59] just go and easily access that money
[53:01] so the more that you can do that now
[53:03] again you don't want to do any of that
[53:04] until your debt debt free okay this is
[53:07] this is a baby step and I have a lot of
[53:10] people come up to me
[53:11] at the end and they'll be like well we
[53:14] want to go ahead and start investing but
[53:15] we're not debt free and and all this
[53:17] stuff it doesn't work that way
[53:19] you've got to go through the baby steps
[53:21] okay any questions
[53:26] tell me
[53:31] see I like that yeah I agree hey me
[53:34] going to the Bow Shop saves me every day
[53:36] yeah
[53:37] yeah
[53:39] see that's the thing that I'm
[53:40] embarrassed most with like if me and Jen
[53:42] set down to do a budget and I have to
[53:43] budget hunting season in then she's
[53:45] going to know how much I actually spend
[53:46] on it
[53:48] it's not fun to do yeah that's where the
[53:51] scrap that's right that's where you go
[53:52] and sell scrap metal
[53:53] yeah so baby steps one more time and
[53:56] we're done
[53:57] save a thousand dollars
[53:59] tips to do this sell everything but the
[54:01] kids
[54:02] right sell clothes on Facebook scrap
[54:06] metal find something in your garage that
[54:07] you don't use that you haven't used
[54:10] um
[54:10] you know DVDs that you don't watch
[54:12] anymore because you just don't watch
[54:13] DVDs because you're a Christian so you
[54:16] just you sell those anything that you've
[54:17] got sell that you don't use okay and I'm
[54:20] being light-hearted and joking but
[54:21] anything that you don't use so right
[54:23] it's really easy to do so save a
[54:25] thousand dollars then you pay off all
[54:26] debt
[54:27] do that with a snowball method save 36
[54:29] months of expenses for emergencies next
[54:32] is invest fifteen percent of your income
[54:34] then you're going to save for your
[54:36] children's College pay off the house
[54:38] build wealth and give okay
[54:40] all right that's all I got I don't know
[54:42] if we'll do another Don't Clap yet I
[54:45] don't know if we'll do another one
[54:46] Stuart's so ready to leave
[54:48] I don't know if we'll do another one but
[54:50] if we do it'll just kind of be a recap
[54:52] of this but if you need help with your
[54:54] budget let me know okay
[54:58] [Applause]
