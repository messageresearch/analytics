[0:24] their thinking or understand where
[0:25] they're coming from but they don't make
[0:27] any sense
[0:29] but you you go to a couple of them and a
[0:31] lot of them they're all saying the same
[0:32] thing they all believe the same thing
[0:33] they've all united under one little
[0:35] cause um

[0:47] people's rights and women's rights and
[0:49] equality and

[1:14] nations
[1:15] national sides all these things are all
[1:17] adding up why
[1:19] because there's another u19 going on
[1:22] there's another gathering going on
[1:24] there's a people that are gathering
[1:26] together and they're all saying the same
[1:28] thing
[1:30] the prophet would say it like this in
[1:31] the uniting time and sign
[1:40] he'd say where all the uh
[1:42] all the nations are united we see
[1:43] national signs we see out here in the

[1:47] different things uniting bringing the
[1:49] world together bringing the people
[1:51] together all the churches together all
[1:52] these things and while all that this
[1:55] uniting's been going on
[1:57] there is another uniting going on
[2:00] amen that's what i want to point out to
[2:02] you
[2:02] god is uniting his bride
[2:06] she is coming together
[2:08] from the east and the west
[2:10] and the north and the south there is a
[2:13] uniting time and that's on right now
[2:17] that's in 1963.
[2:21] what is she uniting for
[2:24] the rapture
[2:25] what is she uniting for
[2:27] the rapture
[2:29] why have we gathered here this morning
[2:31] for the rapture why do you believe this
[2:34] message why are we following out there
[2:35] why because we're going in a rapture
[2:39] god's getting her ready
[2:41] yes sir united what is she uniting with
[2:44] with the word
[2:46] for all heavens and all earth will pass
[2:48] away but my words shall never pass away
[2:53] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[2:55] the lord regardless of what any
[2:57] denominations or anybody else says
[3:00] she's uniting herself
[3:02] she's getting ready
[3:04] are you getting ready
[3:07] or have we gotten a little complacent
[3:10] have we have we kind of allowed all
[3:12] these little apps and things to kind of
[3:15] enter into our life and steal our time
[3:16] and rob us
[3:18] of prayer
[3:20] rob us of studying the bible rob us from
[3:22] scripture
[3:24] oh my tell you what the devil is crafty
[3:28] i mean
[3:29] you know we got so many things now to
[3:31] make life easier
[3:34] make everything so much faster yeah of
[3:36] course we've heard it all said we have
[3:38] less time than we've ever had
[3:40] that's right
[3:41] you try to you try to download something
[3:43] or buy something to make make it where
[3:45] you can have more time and it just takes
[3:47] more time for you to figure out how to
[3:48] do it
[3:52] i think sometimes it behooves us to
[3:54] shake ourselves
[3:58] and to see if we're really getting ready
[4:01] why why is she getting ready she is the
[4:03] bride
[4:04] that's right and she's uniting herself
[4:07] with her bridegroom
[4:09] see the bridegroom is the word in the
[4:12] beginning was the word the word was with
[4:14] god and the word was god and the word
[4:16] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[4:18] and the church and the bride
[4:20] and the word is becoming so one
[4:24] until the very word itself
[4:27] is working out the works of the
[4:29] bridegroom
[4:32] oh maybe i'll read that again
[4:34] because something in my heart says lord
[4:36] if that's your word
[4:38] i want to manifest it
[4:40] lord if that's your word that i believe
[4:42] you've called me
[4:44] to manifest that
[4:45] and the church the bride and the word is
[4:48] becoming so on
[4:50] until the very word
[4:52] itself
[4:54] is working out the works of the
[4:56] bridegroom that's what you've been
[4:58] called to that's what this uniting is
[5:00] for it's united you to the word of god
[5:04] that your very actions would be the
[5:06] actions of the bridegroom oh i say
[5:08] brother being helpless oh god to come
[5:11] into a united with the word that where
[5:13] our actions are the actions of the
[5:15] bridegroom
[5:17] that's why he's placed you here that's
[5:19] what he's called you for it's to be the
[5:21] word made flesh in this hour you are
[5:24] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[5:26] of his life power of his power
[5:29] you are the hands you are the feet you
[5:31] are the eyes you are the voice the final
[5:34] voice to the final age
[5:38] all that your works
[5:40] would be the bridegrooms
[5:42] amen you see it's a united
[5:45] not join a church not more of this
[5:48] but flee from everything and be tied to
[5:50] jesus christ
[5:52] oh my that's what we're being united to
[5:54] do church
[5:56] being united to the word
[6:00] if you ever catch a revelation maybe
[6:02] just a little revelation
[6:04] of what was received in the end time
[6:08] not a denomination
[6:10] it's not a man's idea it's not a man's
[6:12] way of thinking
[6:13] but it's none other than the person of
[6:15] jesus christ
[6:16] wanting to have communion with you and
[6:19] if you could just lay aside your
[6:20] differences in everything that you heard
[6:22] and say okay lord
[6:24] maybe i've heard this all my life but
[6:25] lord

[8:32] this
[8:33] what are we talking about we're talking
[8:35] about going in a rapture we're talking
[8:36] about being united for a rapture and
[8:38] going in a body change believe us now
[8:40] this
[8:42] oh i like it how there uh martha said to
[8:45] jesus she said uh
[8:47] he said he said well lord yes i know
[8:49] that as we're at the resurrection
[8:57] but what did jesus say
[8:59] he said i am the resurrection
[9:02] [Applause]
[9:04] see we're always looking to the rapture
[9:06] as an event we're always looking to the
[9:09] resurrection as an event but the worry
[9:11] is saying that the resurrection is a
[9:14] person and you are part of that person
[9:16] the way therefore you the word that has
[9:19] been made manifest in this day you are
[9:22] the resurrection you are part of that
[9:24] word you are the word that god has
[9:26] birthed on the scene in the end time to
[9:28] manifest the spoken word
[9:31] he said i am the resurrection you are
[9:34] that word
[9:36] the word becomes you and you become the
[9:38] word believe us by this
[9:40] we're so caught up in looking for an
[9:42] event to come down the road but the lord
[9:44] has descended with a shout out
[9:49] what is the shot it's the it's the bread
[9:51] of life it's the message gathering
[9:53] together a bride for what for the
[9:55] rapture the prophet said the lord does
[9:58] all three of them while he's descending
[10:00] that means he's already descended
[10:04] we have heard his voice
[10:06] he is uniting you together with that
[10:09] word
[10:10] oh praise god
[10:13] hallelujah you're part of that
[10:14] resurrected word here in the end time
[10:17] the prophet said i believe that through
[10:19] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[10:22] the last days in order to get the bride
[10:23] together for rapturing faith yeah
[10:27] because what we got right now wouldn't
[10:28] be able to do it
[10:30] there is something now right now
[10:33] that that other messenger is saying
[10:35] what you got ain't good enough
[10:38] but just follow the word all the way
[10:40] through
[10:41] you say what we we we got to take a step
[10:44] further praise god there's a step
[10:45] further to take
[10:47] we we can't even have enough faith for
[10:49] divine healing hardly we've got to have
[10:50] enough faith to be changed in a moment
[10:54] and swept up out of this earth
[10:56] and we'll find that after a while
[11:00] this is the first seal
[11:04] but it was through the revelation of
[11:05] those seven seals and those mysterious
[11:07] thunder that's producing rapturing faith
[11:09] in the bride
[11:11] oh don't make it too complicated what
[11:13] does the word say is faith cometh by
[11:16] hearing and hearing the word of god
[11:19] god has equipped you with the necessary
[11:22] word to bring you into that rapturing
[11:24] faith we just got to be willing to feed
[11:26] on it
[11:28] if you feel like you're lacking if you
[11:30] feel like you don't have what you should
[11:32] have look just forgive the things which
[11:34] are behind you and recognize that god
[11:37] has sent a message to you to produce a
[11:39] rapturing faith to change your body to
[11:41] go into a rapture
[11:43] you don't have to you don't have to work
[11:45] it up all on your own
[11:47] i mean i think that's the problem many
[11:48] times we feel like the egyptians
[11:50] yeah
[11:52] not the egyptians the israelites that
[11:53] were in bondage in egypt
[11:56] how are we ever going to get out of
[11:57] egypt
[11:58] how are we ever going to do this
[12:01] well what did they do they started to
[12:02] sigh and they started to cry
[12:05] and the scripture says the lord had
[12:07] heard their cry
[12:09] and i love that scripture in exodus 38
[12:11] it says and i have come down
[12:14] i want to tell you jesus christ is here
[12:17] he's here to meet you in your time of
[12:19] need he's here to manifest the word in
[12:22] your
[12:22] life but he said there in exodus 23 20
[12:25] said behold i sent an angel before thee
[12:28] to keep me in the way and to bring you
[12:31] into the place which i have prepared
[12:33] how are we going to have rapture in
[12:35] faith how are we going to possess the
[12:36] land how are we going to do this is how
[12:39] is our body going to be changed behold i
[12:41] have sent my angel before thee to keep
[12:44] me in the way i have come down
[12:48] oh praise god we're always looking to to
[12:51] what we can do about it
[12:53] we're always looking to how can i do it
[12:56] amen
[13:01] but it's not up to you
[13:04] he's the one that said it
[13:05] he's the one that promised it
[13:08] it's up to us to take him at his word
[13:10] the prophet of god said we're entering
[13:12] into another age
[13:15] he said we're entering into the raptured
[13:17] age he said the move is on for the bride
[13:19] and that's thus saith the lord that's
[13:21] invisible union
[13:23] look something is taking place right now
[13:27] something is happening there's a people
[13:28] that's being united together
[13:32] jesus christ has come down with an open
[13:35] book he's called your name
[13:38] he's revealed the mysteries of the seven
[13:40] seals which has given you rapturing
[13:42] faith
[13:43] that you could be changed in a moment in
[13:45] a twinkling of an eye
[13:47] that's what all this uniting time's
[13:49] about that's what that pillar of cloud
[13:51] that was taken there in february 28th is
[13:53] all about it was the lord coming for
[13:55] redemption claims coming to claim his
[13:57] bride coming to take us home coming to
[14:00] take us into a rapture
[14:02] oh praise god
[14:05] oh hallelujah paul would say behold i
[14:07] show you a mystery
[14:09] we shall not all sleep
[14:11] but we shall be changed
[14:14] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[14:18] at the last trump
[14:20] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[14:22] shall be raised incorruptable
[14:24] and we
[14:25] shall be changed yes sir
[14:27] oh we're going in the rapture church
[14:30] believe us thou this
[14:32] we shall be changed
[14:34] and i believe that even right now
[14:37] little by little we're being changed
[14:38] we're just asking musicians to come that
[14:40] doesn't mean we're ending but
[14:54] what a fellowship
[14:55] or pet doctrines no more creeds
[14:58] no more big eyes no more little use
[15:02] not a way of thinking not a not an
[15:04] explanation
[15:06] but the but the the life of the word
[15:08] living in you
[15:10] the life of the word change in you
[15:12] molding you the scripture says let this
[15:15] mind be in you which was also in christ
[15:17] jesus
[15:21] say well brother matthew
[15:23] that's
[15:24] that's impossible
[15:26] well it would be impossible if god
[15:28] hadn't given us his mind
[15:31] but god made a way in the end time
[15:34] and has revealed his word and given us
[15:37] his very mind
[15:40] that's what he said the the bride of
[15:41] christ has the mind of god and knows
[15:44] what he wants done with the word she has
[15:46] thus saith the lord or she stands still
[15:49] now now don't shrink back from that
[15:51] right
[15:52] that should encourage us to know that
[15:54] there's something laying there in the
[15:56] word for us to obtain
[15:59] friends it's there for you to obtain
[16:02] you've got to be able to obtain it
[16:04] and he didn't lay it there in the word
[16:06] and say it was unobtainable he didn't
[16:08] put it there and place it there and just
[16:10] put these stuff out like a carrot in
[16:12] front of you and say oh you got to be
[16:13] perfect be there for perfect even as
[16:15] your heavenly father is perfect but
[16:17] you'll never be able to do it no these
[16:18] things are put there in the world and he
[16:21] actually put you here to manifest the
[16:24] word that he prophesied
[16:26] and he wants us
[16:27] how long will you hold between two
[16:29] opinions quit looking at the ways of man
[16:32] we're looking at the ways of flesh start
[16:34] looking at the word and saying lord
[16:36] that's for me i'm going to manifest it i
[16:39] believe it i'm going to rise up i'm
[16:41] going to be united under this word
[16:43] because i'm being caught up into a
[16:44] rapture
[16:47] oh thank you
[16:48] jesus oh my
[16:51] just start playing something
[16:53] please
[16:56] oh praise god
[16:59] [Music]
[17:06] praise the lord
[17:09] aren't you glad you've heard the message
[17:12] aren't you glad you've heard the shout
[17:16] aren't you glad you've been gathered
[17:17] together with the people that's come out
[17:19] from all the nonsense there in the world
[17:25] not depending on a man's way of thinking
[17:31] but we've actually received the
[17:32] intelligence of god
[17:35] we've actually received his mind
[17:38] and those are the very things that
[17:41] i just want to encourage you that
[17:42] [Music]
[17:45] we've been united together for a rapture
[17:48] and the devil so much would want to try
[17:50] to come in and cause division amongst
[17:52] the church
[17:53] and break down the fellowship
[17:55] and we could all say oh we believe the
[17:57] message and we're all going to rapture
[17:58] but if that unity is lacking in the body
[18:02] [Music]
[18:04] then it completely defeats
[18:07] what god is wanting to accomplish
[18:09] he's
[18:10] he's joining you together fitly join
[18:12] every need and every joint supply of
[18:15] but there's such a love amongst the
[18:17] brethren and the sisters that you're
[18:19] taking each one's need and each one's
[18:21] burden to heart and we're coming into
[18:23] that that atmosphere of love we're
[18:25] coming into that
[18:26] stature of christ and that capstone of
[18:29] love is settling down upon the bride
[18:33] and if you live like that
[18:36] if you're living
[18:37] what does the prophet say
[18:40] eternal life is
[18:42] living for others
[18:43] [Music]
[18:45] i say we ought to start looking out on
[18:47] the needs of one another the prophet
[18:48] will say this as we stand
[18:53] [Music]
[18:56] but the church has received a heavenly
[18:58] sign
[18:59] an astronaut amen
[19:01] jesus christ in the form of a pillar of
[19:04] fire
[19:05] that he was in the old testament
[19:07] that he was when he met saul on the road
[19:09] down there at damascus
[19:11] the same jesus here today
[19:13] and what does it do
[19:16] does it bring fear
[19:19] it brings love
[19:22] a uniting
[19:23] of one another
[19:25] amen a feeling
[19:28] for one another
[19:29] it brings the love of god
[19:32] oh united us
[19:35] and brings us the body of christ into
[19:38] unity
[19:40] as a bride amen let's just sing this
[19:43] [Music]
[19:52] in this life
[19:56] we've been made victorious
[20:00] [Music]
[20:03] through the blood of jesus christ
[20:11] [Music]
[20:22] we've been made victorious
[20:26] [Music]
[20:28] through the blood of jesus christ

[21:49] would you bow your heads with me for
[21:50] just a moment maybe
[21:52] this morning the words just spoke
[21:54] directly to your heart
[21:56] and somehow you
[21:57] you feel that that desire to be united
[22:00] with the word more in your life
[22:02] and
[22:04] and maybe you've been a christian or
[22:05] you've been raised in the message
[22:07] and you consider yourself a christian
[22:09] today and we don't want to take that
[22:10] away from you but perhaps there's
[22:13] something there that's calling you to a
[22:14] deeper walk with god

[22:18] some of the same things that
[22:20] we've been preaching on as well god must
[22:21] have wanted you to hear it
[22:23] he must have loved you enough to send
[22:25] you a word that you could hear and you
[22:26] could know and would you just talk to
[22:29] him for just a moment and maybe you'd
[22:30] lift your hand and say lord i
