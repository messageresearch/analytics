[26:12] [Music]
[26:24] Oh
[26:37] a man's that's your prayer this evening
[26:44] turn with me if you would to Genesis
[26:47] chapter 3 we'll start reading in verse 9
[26:49] but Glenn is good to see it tonight and
[26:52] and we're kind of in a last-minute kind
[26:56] of deal we had to call off our our
[27:01] regular services and go back to
[27:04] live-streaming course we're not limited
[27:05] to how many can be here but for tonight
[27:08] and then we'll let you know about Sunday
[27:11] so many of you are watching we've had a
[27:13] situation where someone from another
[27:17] church tested positive and they've been
[27:19] around some people from our church so we
[27:21] haven't had anyone from our church test
[27:23] positive but because of the closeness of
[27:26] the situation we thought in the
[27:28] abundance of caution that we would do
[27:29] that and never inspired me to preach to
[27:33] empty pews but but we're glad too that
[27:37] you're here tonight those of you that
[27:38] could make it and we're so so happy that
[27:40] you could make it and I'm sure there
[27:42] there's not much of a risk of exposure
[27:45] but but what was there would be from
[27:48] from that and those that were exposed to
[27:51] that we're taking caution and I believe
[27:54] we should but we also have a
[27:56] responsibility to preach the Word of God
[27:57] and hear the Word of God and so I'm glad
[28:00] that you're here tonight and those of
[28:01] you that are and I'm glad for those of
[28:03] you that are watching and if I didn't
[28:05] get a hold of you and let you know
[28:06] personally about it you forgive me for
[28:09] that we tried to let as meaning know as
[28:11] possible Genesis chapter 3 and verse 9 I
[28:14] want to talk to you tonight about
[28:15] accountability accountability and I
[28:20] believe this is important and it goes
[28:23] along with something that I preached
[28:24] here not long ago about responsibility
[28:28] and so we're gonna talk about
[28:31] accountability and maybe it'll be
[28:32] something that that would help us maybe
[28:34] a little bit heavy for a while but we
[28:36] get to the end there's something really
[28:38] good that I want to get to us something
[28:40] that's on my heart and so kind of just
[28:43] hang with me tonight hang on buckle your
[28:45] seat belts as my brother would say in
[28:47] and just try to stay with us as we go
[28:50] through this tonight Genesis chapter 3
[28:52] and verse 9 and the Lord God called him
[28:55] to Adam and said unto Him where art thou
[28:58] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[29:01] garden and I was afraid because I was
[29:04] naked and I hid myself and he said who
[29:07] told thee that thou was naked hast thou
[29:10] eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
[29:12] thee that thou should us not eat and the
[29:16] man said the woman whom thou gave us to
[29:18] be with me she gave me of the tree and I
[29:20] did eat and the Lord God said unto the
[29:22] woman what is this that thou hast done
[29:24] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[29:27] me and I did eat let's bow our heads for
[29:31] a word of Prayer
[29:33] Heavenly Father we're so grateful for
[29:36] all that you do for us every day and
[29:38] grateful for your goodness and your
[29:39] mercy to us I pray that you would just
[29:41] continue to bless us tonight and Lord
[29:44] keep us in your perfect will oh how we
[29:46] need to know your will every step of the
[29:49] way every day god we pray that you would
[29:51] help us through this current situation
[29:53] Lord you knew what bumster would be in
[29:56] the road Lord and so we asked you to
[29:57] come and and just guide us and lead us
[29:59] Lord as only you can through life we
[30:01] pray in Jesus name Amen
[30:05] I mean god bless you you could be seated
[30:07] this evening we'll make some other
[30:16] announcements in the future as to future
[30:18] services as well so keep that in mind I
[30:25] had recently been thinking about a
[30:29] experience that I'd had when I was
[30:32] younger I used to deliver bread when I
[30:35] was a teenager to the back rooms of
[30:38] storage rooms of grocery stores and
[30:41] during that time there was an employee
[30:45] who sits at the back and his entire job
[30:48] his whole life is to sit at the back of
[30:51] the grocery store and count how many
[30:55] pieces of bread or how many rolls or how
[30:59] many sweets come in the back door
[31:01] grocery store and that's his whole life
[31:03] that's all that he does is to count that
[31:06] up and I found out that he's actually
[31:09] one of the highest-paid employees in the
[31:13] grocery store and that he's actually a
[31:16] union employee and and then he sits back
[31:19] there and brother David and I've always
[31:20] wanted to have one of those jobs but
[31:22] they never would have me but but he has
[31:24] it he has a pretty cushy job and the
[31:27] reason is because he's accountable he is
[31:30] someone who asked to give an account for
[31:33] every item that comes in the back door
[31:36] everything that comes in so we had to
[31:39] come come in and he would sit there and
[31:40] he would count you've got so many roles
[31:42] so many so many loaves of bread and he
[31:45] would know exactly what come in the
[31:47] store and he would report to the store
[31:49] manager exactly what the stock was and
[31:52] how much they had and if it didn't match
[31:54] at the end of the day he was going to be
[31:56] accountable for that and so there was a
[31:58] great reward that come with it he didn't
[32:01] have to work all that hard but he was
[32:03] the most accountable in the store when
[32:07] God come to Adam in the scripture that
[32:09] we read and he said Adam where art thou
[32:11] he's requiring Adam to give an account
[32:15] for his whereabouts and what he had done
[32:19] and I think it's interesting that he
[32:22] doesn't call out - he doesn't call out
[32:25] to Eve or to the serpent he didn't say
[32:28] serpent where art thou he didn't say to
[32:31] Eve were how but he said Adam where are
[32:34] you and the reason for that is because
[32:36] Adam was primarily accountable for what
[32:41] he for the rest of him and so he would
[32:44] speak to Adam first so Adam turns around
[32:46] and God says Adam where are you and Adam
[32:48] said I heard your voice in the garden I
[32:50] was afraid because I was naked I went
[32:52] and hid myself and so at but Adam said
[32:55] but it wasn't my fault
[32:56] he said Eve made me do it right and so
[33:00] then he said hey don't blame me right
[33:03] and because the serpent made me do it
[33:06] and so God if you go back in that
[33:09] chapter he begins to speak first to the
[33:11] serpent and then to even find
[33:13] it's all the way back to Adam and he
[33:15] makes each one of them responsible for
[33:18] what happened
[33:19] so the surfer was responsible for what
[33:21] he did Eve was responsible for what she
[33:23] did but Adam was responsible for the
[33:26] entire thing and ever since the phone
[33:29] has been the case that he's been
[33:30] responsible because of his position and
[33:33] so we find that in a position you have a
[33:36] different level of responsibility or
[33:38] accountability than others do and Paul
[33:42] speaks to this accountability in Romans
[33:43] chapter 14 he says why that's now judged
[33:46] thy brother
[33:47] why does how said it not that brother or
[33:50] say well he doesn't do anything for God
[33:53] you know said we shall all stand before
[33:56] the judgment seat of Christ we shall all
[34:00] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[34:02] I want you to keep that in mind because
[34:04] I know what you're thinking but having
[34:06] been raised in a message and around the
[34:09] message you probably think well the
[34:10] bride doesn't come to the white throne
[34:11] judgment that's true we're going to show
[34:13] you that in a moment but there is a
[34:15] place that we have to stand and give an
[34:17] account for what we've done we've got to
[34:21] do that in Romans 14 11 he's goes on he
[34:25] says for it is written as I live saith
[34:27] the Lord every knee shall bow and every
[34:30] tongue shall confess to God verse 12 so
[34:34] then every one of us shall give account
[34:37] of himself to God every one of us shall
[34:42] give account of himself to God and
[34:45] ultimately God made Adam accountable and
[34:49] he made Eve accountable and he made the
[34:51] serpent accountable every one of us
[34:54] shall give account of himself to God in
[34:58] the 16th century that was a Protestant
[35:01] reformer in England by the name of Hugh
[35:02] Latimer and what's known as the great
[35:05] preacher of his day it would he had many
[35:08] opportunities to speak and once he found
[35:10] that he was to preach before King Henry
[35:13] the eighth that'd be kind of a hard
[35:15] thing to do that was the king that was
[35:16] known for cutting off the heads of his
[35:18] wives but he had to preach in front of
[35:23] him and he got up and he began to say
[35:26] this he
[35:27] says Latimer Latimer speaking of himself
[35:31] he said do you remember that you're
[35:33] speaking before the high and mighty King
[35:35] Henry the eighth who has power to
[35:38] command you to be sent to prison who can
[35:40] have your head cut off if it please him
[35:42] will you not take care to say nothing
[35:45] that will offend royal ears you can
[35:48] pause and continued Latimer Latimer do
[35:51] you not remember that you're speaking
[35:53] before the king of kings and Lord of
[35:55] lords
[35:56] before him and whose throne Henry the
[35:58] eighth will stand before him to him one
[36:02] day you will have to give account
[36:03] yourself
[36:05] he said Latimer be faithful to your
[36:08] master and declare all of God's word and
[36:11] he ended up giving his life during the
[36:13] time of the daughter of King Henry the
[36:15] 8th Queen Mary Bloody Mary but he but he
[36:19] had to give an account and he would
[36:20] rather give that account and have his
[36:23] conscience clear before God than before
[36:26] the King so each one of us kills in
[36:29] account but the Baron says when you're
[36:30] born God sets the record on and that's
[36:33] outdated my kids don't know how a record
[36:35] works but I'm actually old enough to
[36:38] have found a record in an antique store
[36:39] and played one and so I know how record
[36:43] works when but the Bell said you put a
[36:45] record on it don't make much noise for a
[36:47] little while and I'll think back and you
[36:50] remember when you put a record on it
[36:51] don't make much noise it's quiet and
[36:54] then all of a sudden it begins oh you
[36:56] here's a little scratching sound and
[36:58] then it begins he said it don't make
[37:00] much noise for a little while he said
[37:02] that's the little baby he said till it
[37:05] comes to accountability till it comes to
[37:09] accountability and begins to know right
[37:13] from wrong
[37:13] said then the noise starts he starts
[37:17] saying things and doing things he has to
[37:20] answer for and brother Bell says then
[37:24] when that life ends that record or tape
[37:27] is took off and laid in the great big
[37:30] library of God he said now how you going
[37:33] to get around it at the judgment bar
[37:35] it's played right back in front of you
[37:38] every
[37:39] move you made every thought that went
[37:44] through your mind I'll tell you what God
[37:47] knows how to record things I'm so
[37:50] thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:52] but wipes away all of our past sin once
[37:57] it's repented it goes under the blood
[37:58] and I'm so thankful for that because God
[38:01] keeps a record of the things of
[38:04] unrepentant sin now Jesus said it this
[38:07] way he said but I say to you that every
[38:09] idle word that men shall speak so in
[38:12] other words just something they just
[38:13] throw out there they shall give account
[38:15] thereof in the day of judgment every
[38:20] idle word well that would get some of us
[38:23] wouldn't it we say a lot of idle words
[38:27] they shall give account thereof in the
[38:30] day of judgment see the rabbit says
[38:34] every move you make every time you bat
[38:37] your eye it'll never die it's in the
[38:40] ether waves of the air television
[38:41] doesn't manufacture that it just picks
[38:44] up that wave of you and produces it on
[38:46] the screen it's there anyhow it always
[38:49] was every moves you ever made is still
[38:52] alive in the air he said now you see
[38:55] what we're gonna be at the judgement so
[38:58] if you had the ability today and then
[38:59] science has proved this that but they
[39:01] just don't have the ability to do it but
[39:04] if you had the ability you could go back
[39:06] and pick up the vibrations of the voice
[39:08] of Jesus Christ and replay it today
[39:11] because it's still circling the earth
[39:13] and I'm thankful for that because he
[39:16] said Father forgive them they don't know
[39:19] what they're doing but that that voice
[39:20] always circles the earth whatever Jesus
[39:22] said circles the earth whatever you say
[39:25] circles the earth the vibrations of it
[39:27] never never stop and brother Branham
[39:31] says even even your form even what you
[39:33] do it always is it always was
[39:36] every move you ever made is still alive
[39:38] in the air he said now you see what
[39:41] we're going to be at the judgement in
[39:45] Malachi chapter 3 in verse 16 and this
[39:52] taken by the Jews and they say that that
[39:55] there's a recording angel and that
[39:57] actually fits with some things that
[39:58] mother Benham said and we'll look at
[39:59] that in a moment
[40:00] but they say there's a recording angel
[40:03] because of this scripture it says then
[40:05] they that feared the Lord spake often to
[40:07] one another in the live hearkened and
[40:08] heard it and a book of remembrance was
[40:10] written before him for them that feared
[40:13] the Lord so was written before the Lord
[40:14] and that fought upon his name so it's
[40:17] not just the bad things that you do but
[40:19] the good things so he says that a book
[40:22] of remembrance was written and this is
[40:24] where they get the idea of a recording
[40:26] angel now Branham talks about this and
[40:30] he says I dreamed it he says he said I
[40:33] was standing one day and I was watching
[40:35] that great time
[40:36] he said not the judgment he said now I
[40:39] don't believe the church or the bride
[40:40] goes to a judgment he said but I was
[40:43] there when the crowns was being given
[40:45] out he said in the great big throne set
[40:48] up here in Jesus and the recording angel
[40:50] and all was standing there and brother
[40:54] Branham has another another time and
[40:55] that was a dream of the random has a
[40:56] vision and he talks about this vision
[40:59] and perfection of 1957 and you remember
[41:03] the vision because brother Branham walks
[41:04] into a some kind of a cafe or an
[41:07] establishment like that and he sees a
[41:09] woman that it's not what she should be
[41:12] at all and all painted up and and
[41:14] flirting with this man that was there's
[41:17] police officer but a man kind of has
[41:20] some hard thoughts about that situation
[41:21] and he stands there and he said when he
[41:24] when he did that he had a vision he said
[41:27] as I stood looking he said I got a
[41:29] little closer to him and I noticed him
[41:31] and I could hear him say Father forgive
[41:32] him now he sees a vision of the earth
[41:34] spinning and he sees that his own sin
[41:38] going out and hitting out like a bumper
[41:40] of the blood of Jesus Christ that
[41:42] surrounded the earth and he said I could
[41:44] hear him say Father forgive him he
[41:47] doesn't know what he's doing he said and
[41:50] I looked down and there laid a book he
[41:53] said and there was a recording angel
[41:55] there and standing by his side he said
[41:58] and every time I send it was put down on
[42:01] the book and if you remember the vision
[42:04] I was talking about his whole life and
[42:06] how that when he was a young boy the
[42:08] angel would write those things down but
[42:10] there came a time he said when Jesus
[42:12] dipped his hand into his own side and
[42:15] pulled it out bloody and wrote pardon
[42:17] the crossed it well I'm so glad for that
[42:20] time but brother Graham tells us he said
[42:23] every time I send it was foot down on
[42:25] the book and my name was on it and I
[42:28] realized that someday that blood streak
[42:30] would be lifted and I would have to
[42:32] stand in the presence of God with my
[42:34] sinful life speaking him before he got
[42:37] saved he said but I've seen by his mercy
[42:39] he was holding off my judgment don't
[42:43] think that God just gonna let you get by
[42:45] with whatever you want to get by with
[42:47] because nothing happens you do it and
[42:50] nothing happens you get by with it now
[42:52] but there's coming a day when the blood
[42:55] streaks going to be gone and the
[42:57] recording angel quotes the book and
[42:59] that's it or well the book is of my life
[43:02] is still open I want him to dip his hand
[43:04] and his sign it right across it pardoned
[43:09] so he said that blood streak would be
[43:11] lifted and I would have stand in the
[43:13] presence of God with my sinful life but
[43:16] I seen by his mercy was holding off my
[43:19] judgment now but the brand talks about
[43:24] how that when you get the Holy Ghost
[43:25] your godson or God's daughter
[43:27] he said that's true enough so when you
[43:31] are God's Son and God's daughter he
[43:32] can't lose you
[43:34] right you don't get saved so God can
[43:36] loose you but we're still accountable
[43:41] being saved doesn't remove
[43:43] accountability from our life because
[43:46] whether matter said but if you don't
[43:48] obey God walk in the light in the word
[43:52] walk in the lawyer walk in the light
[43:54] walk in the word believe God he said
[43:57] then you won't have any inheritance he
[43:59] said well that's just exactly the way
[44:01] God does it yet you're still son or
[44:06] daughter of God but you won't have any
[44:08] inheritance and I wonder about somebody
[44:11] who doesn't care about his inheritance I
[44:13] understand there's some that will just
[44:16] never
[44:16] never seem to really be able to grab
[44:18] ahold and it seems like that they
[44:20] struggle through life and I believe God
[44:23] understands but but when it comes to
[44:26] somebody that just turns down the things
[44:28] of God and says well I'm a Christian but
[44:30] I can just live any way I want to I
[44:32] don't wonder if that person is really a
[44:35] son or daughter of God because a son or
[44:37] daughter a real son or daughter of God
[44:38] cares about their inheritance so who are
[44:45] we accountable to let's look at that
[44:48] tonight first of all we are accountable
[44:51] to God just like Adam and Eve were Adam
[44:54] where are you every one of us are
[44:56] accountable to God
[44:57] sinners serpent seed seed of God
[45:02] Christians all of us none of us escape
[45:07] being accountable to God we are
[45:10] accountable first for our sins in first
[45:13] John 1:9 he says if we confess our sins
[45:15] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[45:17] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[45:19] unrighteousness but I want you to notice
[45:20] what it says if we confess and that's
[45:24] not to me or to anybody else but that's
[45:26] confessing to God if we confess our sins
[45:29] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[45:31] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[45:33] unrighteousness but we have to confess
[45:36] it and unconfessed sin will be held
[45:38] accountable for that that's true and
[45:42] that's what we're marks of a Christian
[45:44] is you you repent quickly and there's an
[45:47] advocate there for you but but if you
[45:50] hold unconfessed sin in your life then
[45:52] there's something wrong you need to go
[45:54] back and really have an experience with
[45:56] God that's all I can say now but the
[45:59] writer says many people see some only
[46:01] three crosses on Calvary there was four
[46:04] one of them was the thief on one side
[46:06] the thief on the other side Jesus in the
[46:09] middle that's three crosses Judas hung
[46:12] himself on a sycamore tree which is a
[46:15] cross
[46:16] Kirstin is he that hangeth on the tree
[46:18] and there was the son of God came from
[46:21] God returning to God taking with him the
[46:23] repentant sinner remember that was the
[46:26] thief on one side that said father or he
[46:28] said bring take me with
[46:30] when you go to your kingdom he said he
[46:33] wanted to be forgiven and he was a
[46:34] repentant sinner but on the other side
[46:37] was the one who went to hell and he said
[46:40] Judas took with him the unrepentant
[46:42] sinner so a thief on one side had
[46:46] repented both of them had done the same
[46:47] thing
[46:48] both of them being guilty of the same
[46:50] acts but the one repented well I want to
[46:52] be with that one that repented I want to
[46:55] be someone who can repent when when I
[46:58] find sin has come in my life so Mel the
[47:03] son of perdition he said coming from
[47:04] hell we're turning back to hell taking
[47:06] with him the unrepentant sinner we find
[47:09] the importance of repentance in the
[47:11] ephesian church age which had fallen and
[47:15] the scripture says remember therefore
[47:17] from whence thou art fallen and repent
[47:19] new the first works or else I will come
[47:22] unto thee quickly and will remove that
[47:24] candlestick out of his place except thou
[47:26] repent God tells them to remember he
[47:29] said evidently something had left their
[47:31] minds oh I think we need to be reminded
[47:34] that we need to repent every day only
[47:38] something unless their minds they've
[47:39] forgotten something he told them to turn
[47:42] back in their minds to their point of
[47:45] origin
[47:46] he said the origin of the first stage
[47:48] was Pentecost they had fallen from it
[47:50] they had forgotten the glory and laundr
[47:54] of it there was a time when it it was
[47:58] special to them and now it wasn't
[48:00] special anymore they can do without it
[48:02] said remember what you've fallen from
[48:06] and turn back to it
[48:09] he says they'd forgotten the Goron
[48:12] wonder have at that moment when you got
[48:14] saved and you remembered what it was
[48:15] like for the Jonah to have that sense
[48:17] that your sins were forgiven and you
[48:19] were clean you're a warship you had such
[48:21] joy in your life and then as life goes
[48:24] on you begin to kind of get oh it gets
[48:26] away from you but you have to remember
[48:28] where you come from remember your origin
[48:30] remember the glory and the wonder of
[48:32] salvation he said it was time to go back
[48:35] in mind and then reality back to when
[48:39] they could say for me to live is Christ
[48:43] I wonder sometimes if that's what God is
[48:46] doing shaking this world with viruses
[48:48] and everything else is he's shaking us
[48:50] he wants us to remember he wants us to
[48:52] go back to where we started back to
[48:55] purity
[48:56] he says when Ananias and Sapphira were
[48:59] dealt with back to the gate beautiful
[49:02] oh what a reproach it is to drift from
[49:04] God and countenance those acts that
[49:07] defile his name
[49:09] let those who name his name depart from
[49:12] sin
[49:12] keep their vessels pure for God I said
[49:14] God help me to do that today
[49:16] see that's accountability we've got to
[49:19] give an account so we've got to repent
[49:22] but the Rebbe said look at what you
[49:24] wants war in your heart and in your mind
[49:27] and in your life then go back to it what
[49:33] is the way back the way is the way of
[49:36] repentance if a sinner has to come to
[49:39] God by way of repentance listen those of
[49:42] you their church members and those of
[49:44] you are watching tonight and those that
[49:46] are here we've been in in the church for
[49:48] a long time but he said if a sinner has
[49:51] to come to God by way of repentance in
[49:54] the lukewarm or backslider will have to
[49:56] repent that much more repent
[50:01] bring forth fruits meet for repentance
[50:03] prove it by your life said if you do not
[50:06] repent said God I will remove your
[50:08] lampstand certainly a church in that
[50:11] condition can't give light to the world
[50:13] it's light has turned to darkness God
[50:18] will then take away its faithful
[50:19] messenger and his faithful Shepherds and
[50:21] leave them to themselves and they will
[50:23] go on talking about Christianity but the
[50:25] rest of it
[50:26] repent quickly he says don't hesitate
[50:29] evidently emphasis did hesitate for her
[50:32] lifespan was not very long the glory of
[50:34] God decreased ever so rapidly was not
[50:37] long until the city was in ruins this
[50:38] glorious temple became a shapeless mass
[50:40] the land become a marsh inhabited by
[50:42] waterfowl the population was gone except
[50:45] for a few unbelievers in a squalid
[50:47] village there was not even one Christian
[50:50] left you imagine a place like Ephesus
[50:54] which if the book of Ephesians was
[50:57] these were people who were sitting there
[51:00] and they had the goods we might say we
[51:03] want an efficient Church brother branham
[51:05] even said we would be restored back to
[51:06] another efficient but there come a time
[51:11] when that efficient Church so it's not
[51:13] even one Christian left brother mastered
[51:16] the lamp was ripped from its place no it
[51:18] does not mean that she could not have
[51:19] repented it does not mean that we cannot
[51:22] repent we can but it must be quickly it
[51:26] must be a true heart cry to God in
[51:28] sorrow and then God will restore the
[51:31] glory shall come again oh my that's what
[51:36] we want
[51:37] so we have to give an account to God
[51:39] even though we're Christians for things
[51:41] we do in the flesh we give an account
[51:44] for that we give an account for the
[51:46] gifts that were given in Matthew 25 and
[51:47] verse 15 it says unto one he gave five
[51:50] talents to another two and to another
[51:51] one to every man according to his
[51:53] several ability and straightway took his
[51:55] journey so we know that different
[51:56] amounts are given to different people
[51:58] there's some people are given different
[52:01] opportunities than others some people
[52:03] are given different gifts and others
[52:04] some people are given a different a
[52:07] different type of ministry than others
[52:08] and and to us you know all that it does
[52:11] if you if you hear more you're
[52:13] responsible for more you're accountable
[52:16] for more the more that you hear the more
[52:18] you're accountable for when you hear
[52:20] less you're accountable for less so he
[52:23] gave to every man according to his
[52:25] several ability and he went in took his
[52:26] journey and we know the story how did he
[52:29] come and demanded an account of what
[52:31] they had done with what he had given
[52:34] them and desperations in 1963 brother
[52:37] brown said that Jack Moore said to me
[52:39] one time I'd hate to have to answer like
[52:41] you will have to at the day of the
[52:42] judgment he said God has put these
[52:45] people into your hands and you're gonna
[52:47] have to give an account for every one of
[52:49] them now think about that that's why he
[52:54] called out to Adam Adam where art thou
[52:55] he was the one in the original creation
[52:58] God put that garden in his hands
[53:01] and he said you're gonna have to give it
[53:04] account for everybody in the garden you
[53:07] get to name them you have to be
[53:08] accountable for
[53:11] so he says I'm gonna make you
[53:13] accountable God has put these people in
[53:15] your hands you're going to give an
[53:16] account for every one of them he said
[53:18] you're gonna answer for your ministry so
[53:20] that's been about 15 years ago maybe 18
[53:22] since then I've been in desperation what
[53:25] will I do let me say only what you say
[53:27] Lord let me tell them what's the truth
[53:30] or don't say nothing oh how about a grip
[53:33] our hearts today let me tell them what's
[53:35] the truth oh don't say nothing it throws
[53:37] me in desperation but the Rebbe said
[53:40] someday I must stand yonder at the
[53:43] throne of God and give an account for my
[53:45] ministry give an account for these
[53:47] things that you've permitted me to do
[53:48] Lord in the midst of the people to
[53:50] declare the resurrection of the Lord
[53:52] Jesus I'm gonna be accountable but how
[53:55] much more messenger to the aged right so
[53:58] he has to give an account and that's why
[54:02] messengers many times are understood
[54:03] because they had to give an account zq
[54:06] had to be a watchman on the wall and so
[54:08] he had to do exactly what God said and
[54:10] he was misunderstood by the people
[54:12] because he had to give an account for
[54:13] what he would say
[54:14] he had to say it in a certain way and
[54:16] say only what God said and our prophet
[54:19] was the same way he said God he said I
[54:21] must answer for that
[54:23] Oh God burns zeal down into my heart
[54:25] more and more and wisdom that I might
[54:28] know how to lead two people to the Lord
[54:29] Jesus I say amen to that tonight you see
[54:33] the men with the biggest churches won't
[54:36] necessarily get the biggest rewards the
[54:39] people with the with the most greatest
[54:43] ministries won't necessarily have the
[54:46] greatest crowns but it'll be the ones
[54:49] who did the most with what they have
[54:51] right God gave you something he gave you
[54:54] a good mind or give you good hands to
[54:56] give you the ability to work whatever he
[54:57] gave you you give an account for that
[54:59] not for somebody else has not for what
[55:03] he gave somebody else but he gave you a
[55:04] gift and you give an account for that
[55:07] gift not for somebody else's so it'll be
[55:11] those who who stand there and and can
[55:14] give an account for each of the ones
[55:16] that they come in contact with now think
[55:19] about that you don't get a day off or
[55:22] moment off
[55:24] you know when you're on vacation you
[55:26] don't suddenly become unaccountable
[55:28] right when you're when you're not at
[55:31] church you don't suddenly become
[55:33] unaccountable to people or to god you're
[55:36] accountable and you'll be have to give
[55:38] an account for what you do in the
[55:40] ministry well though I'm saved and I
[55:42] believe God the God that saved me will
[55:44] keep me no matter what I do and that's a
[55:47] strong statement but I believe it I
[55:49] believe it doesn't matter what I do God
[55:52] will keep me he's not gonna lose me but
[55:55] I'll give it a count for what I do and I
[55:58] don't want to be embarrassed I don't
[56:02] want to stand up there and have to be
[56:03] embarrassed because of my ministry
[56:05] because I I took some time off or did
[56:09] something that wasn't right not not that
[56:10] I wouldn't rest but that I I
[56:12] misrepresented God to people because of
[56:15] things I was going through but now but
[56:21] the rest is but there will be a great
[56:23] general resurrection one of these days
[56:25] we'll all be called into the presence of
[56:29] God you say that's good for a preacher
[56:31] to have to give an account and a
[56:33] preacher is more accountable a messenger
[56:35] is more accountable but every one of us
[56:38] will be called into the presence of God
[56:39] we'll all be called into the presence of
[56:42] God to give an account for what we have
[56:44] done with what God gave to us what did
[56:46] he give to us Jesus Christ that's what
[56:50] he says every one of us will give an
[56:52] account for what we have done with what
[56:54] God gave to us Pilate had one moment in
[56:56] his life that mattered he had been
[57:00] probably to school all of his life and
[57:02] in the military to become what he was
[57:04] and had become the general counsel or
[57:08] the the governor of that state or that
[57:10] land that he was in and he stood there
[57:12] knows one moment in his life that
[57:14] mattered and that he was held into
[57:15] account for when he said I find no fault
[57:19] in him but they said crucify him anyway
[57:21] and he stood there and washed his hands
[57:22] from the blood of Jesus Christ but he
[57:25] could wash his hands he couldn't wash
[57:27] the stain off of his heart Pilate stood
[57:29] there you'll stand there be it be raised
[57:32] in that old body that he went down and
[57:34] he'd be raised in
[57:35] stand there at the judgment seat and
[57:37] have to answer for what he did with
[57:39] Jesus Christ but Pilate is emblematic of
[57:43] every one of us every one of us have to
[57:45] answer for what we did with Jesus Christ
[57:47] because we knew about it if we know who
[57:52] he is we have to answer for who he is
[57:56] Luke chapter 12 verse 47 says that
[58:00] servant which knew his Lord's will
[58:01] prepared not himself neither did
[58:05] according to his Will shall be beaten
[58:06] with many stripes he that knew not and
[58:09] didn't commit things worthy of stripes
[58:10] shall be beaten with few stripes
[58:12] Brendan whomsoever much is given of him
[58:14] shall be much required who men have
[58:17] committed much of him they will ask more
[58:20] now I want to take a few moments and I
[58:22] won't be extremely long tonight and some
[58:25] of you that thought you were coming to
[58:26] church tonight now you're sitting in
[58:28] your living room I know it's kind of
[58:30] disconcerting it is to me to to have to
[58:32] preach again like this but the Lord has
[58:35] some reason for it and so we have to
[58:36] remember that but but you know as we're
[58:40] sitting there as you're sitting there
[58:41] tonight or as you're here tonight I want
[58:43] you to think about who you're
[58:44] accountable to and why we're accountable
[58:48] to different kinds of people and the
[58:50] thing is we're accountable on different
[58:52] levels so parents are accountable for
[58:55] their children and we can say it this
[58:58] way children are accountable to their
[58:59] parents parents have a right to make
[59:03] taken account of their children right so
[59:06] you can say where were you what did you
[59:08] do you know and children have a certain
[59:11] responsibility to their parents but in
[59:14] Reverse the parents are accountable for
[59:16] their children right so the parents have
[59:19] the greater position of authority so we
[59:21] might say that there's some that have a
[59:24] thought we have authority over and
[59:26] there's others who have authority over
[59:28] us and on every level we're accountable
[59:31] both ways but it's like this so children
[59:35] are accountable to their parents but
[59:37] they're not accountable for their
[59:38] parents right it's not my children's
[59:42] fault what I do but it is my fault well
[59:47] they're little anyway to some
[59:49] still what they do I'm accountable for
[59:52] them right and but it doesn't go the
[59:55] other way they're accountable to me but
[59:58] not for me
[59:59] so we find a husband and a wife in a
[1:00:03] similar situation but not exactly a
[1:00:06] government and the governed right that
[1:00:09] the citizens of a nation are accountable
[1:00:11] in a certain way to one another into
[1:00:13] their government but not the way the
[1:00:15] government is to citizens an employee is
[1:00:18] accountable to his employer not to steal
[1:00:20] the staplers all right
[1:00:23] they say that and forgive me if any of
[1:00:25] you work at Dollar General but they say
[1:00:27] the greatest cause of theft at Dollar
[1:00:29] General is the people that work there
[1:00:31] that's that's the number-one cause of a
[1:00:34] favorite of loss at Dollar General is
[1:00:36] just the people that work there but you
[1:00:38] have to be accountable to who you work
[1:00:39] for or they're gonna make you
[1:00:41] accountable they'll you lose your job
[1:00:43] but your employer is accountable for you
[1:00:46] in a different way a congregation is
[1:00:50] accountable to a pastor and in some
[1:00:52] level but also a pastor is accountable
[1:00:55] to a congregation so I want to just look
[1:00:59] at these relationships tonight and see
[1:01:00] how we can be accountable to one another
[1:01:02] and what who we should be accountable to
[1:01:05] parents in Ephesians 6:1 it says
[1:01:07] children obey your parents in the Lord
[1:01:08] for this is right so that means that if
[1:01:12] you're a child if you're living at home
[1:01:14] you're accountable to your parents but I
[1:01:18] will say this it doesn't end there
[1:01:20] because the Bible says honor your father
[1:01:23] and mother and the Lord for this is
[1:01:25] right and it doesn't end when you're
[1:01:27] grown because the Matthew 7 you can go
[1:01:30] read it we don't read it tonight for
[1:01:31] sake of time but it talks about the
[1:01:33] practice of Corbyn which is actually
[1:01:34] giving your parents a gift and saying
[1:01:39] it's enough now I'm done with you all
[1:01:41] right so they would take a sum of money
[1:01:43] and give it to the parents say this I'm
[1:01:45] buying you off for the rest of your life
[1:01:46] now I don't have to be accountable for
[1:01:48] what you do and whether you make it or
[1:01:50] not whether you live or not no that's
[1:01:52] not the way it works you might give them
[1:01:54] a million dollars today it doesn't make
[1:01:56] you unaccountable you still have to
[1:01:58] remember to honor your parents right
[1:02:02] those few of you who have parents here
[1:02:04] in the church you have to remember that
[1:02:06] you're still accountable and it's a
[1:02:08] shame what happens in this in this
[1:02:10] country sometimes because of our lack of
[1:02:13] accountability to our elders children
[1:02:17] are accountable in a different way it
[1:02:20] says that you father's provoke not your
[1:02:22] children to wrath but bring them up in
[1:02:23] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:02:24] now so children are accountable in that
[1:02:27] they must treat their parents right
[1:02:28] they've got honor the father and mother
[1:02:30] but parents are accountable to not
[1:02:34] provoke their children so that is
[1:02:36] somebody we would be accountable for us
[1:02:38] the children if you have children to
[1:02:41] provoke them to wrath but bring them up
[1:02:44] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:02:46] Lord and I think he said Ye fathers
[1:02:48] because he knew we were prone to
[1:02:50] provoking our children not brother Joe
[1:02:53] but everybody else we fathers are prone
[1:03:00] to provoke our children and and when we
[1:03:03] do you know we tend to get a response
[1:03:05] and the Bible says provoke not your
[1:03:07] children to wrath don't make them angry
[1:03:09] needlessly right but bring them up in
[1:03:13] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:03:15] always keep in mind what your job is
[1:03:16] what how you're accountable to your
[1:03:18] children so you're accountable to your
[1:03:20] children that makes sense you're
[1:03:23] accountable for them but also to God but
[1:03:25] also accountable to them they have a
[1:03:28] right to hold you to the scripture
[1:03:31] maybe not to their interpretation of it
[1:03:33] but but they have a right to hold you to
[1:03:36] that scripture that's absolutely true
[1:03:39] now and you have a right to hold them on
[1:03:41] to honor your father and mother a
[1:03:44] husband so there's an accountability
[1:03:48] that a wife has to a husband and a
[1:03:50] husband has a right to to hold his wife
[1:03:53] accountable in this way like why she was
[1:03:55] being subjection to your own husband's
[1:03:56] that if any obey not the word they are
[1:03:58] also made without the word be won by the
[1:04:01] conversation or the lifestyle of the
[1:04:03] wife that's a strong scripture and it's
[1:04:06] one that we don't like to hear today but
[1:04:08] then in the message we could take that
[1:04:09] and turn it around it also says the wife
[1:04:12] likewise she husband's right because we
[1:04:16] like that
[1:04:16] one it said likewise G wiseness is
[1:04:18] likewise G husband's dwell with them
[1:04:20] according to knowledge so again you see
[1:04:21] the accountability going both ways so
[1:04:24] the husband is accountable for the wife
[1:04:28] just like Adam was Adam where art thou
[1:04:32] it's his responsibility if the buck
[1:04:34] stops here it means it's my I'm
[1:04:36] accountable for it right but it also
[1:04:39] means that the husbands have an
[1:04:42] expectation that their wife would be in
[1:04:44] subjection and the wife has an
[1:04:46] expectation that the husband will not
[1:04:48] abuse that authority and well with them
[1:04:51] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:04:54] the wife as unto the weaker vessel as
[1:04:57] being heirs together of the grace of
[1:04:59] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:05:01] so it's almost like he's saying God is
[1:05:04] saying through his his messenger Paul
[1:05:06] he's saying or Peter rather if you do
[1:05:08] this if you don't do this your prayers
[1:05:11] are gonna be hindered if you don't treat
[1:05:13] your wife right I'm not going to listen
[1:05:15] to your prayers that's a strong
[1:05:18] statement isn't it those of us that are
[1:05:20] married need to listen to that so
[1:05:24] there's an accountability and especially
[1:05:25] in the marriage relationship it's it's
[1:05:27] both ways so Paul says in 1st
[1:05:30] Corinthians 7 for the wife hath not
[1:05:31] power of her own body but the husband
[1:05:33] likewise also the husband hath not power
[1:05:35] of his own body but the wife you're
[1:05:37] accountable to one another even for your
[1:05:38] in natural things and we could go into
[1:05:42] depth in that but I think you understand
[1:05:44] you know that's the only place within
[1:05:46] the marriage covenant is the only place
[1:05:48] where there is a right to complete
[1:05:49] surrender of the body and the mind to
[1:05:51] one another within the boundaries of the
[1:05:53] Word of God it's within that marriage
[1:05:55] covenant and it's not a partnership I
[1:05:58] despised the word partner for my wife
[1:06:01] what we have is not a partnership it is
[1:06:06] a oneness she's me and I'm a hurry a
[1:06:10] partnership I could hide things from her
[1:06:12] I could have another part of my life
[1:06:14] that's not in the partnership right if
[1:06:17] you had a partnership made a partnership
[1:06:19] went open the feed store and with a
[1:06:20] partner you both could be there but the
[1:06:22] rest of your life is not accountable to
[1:06:24] that only what you do at the feed store
[1:06:26] and people treat a marriage as a
[1:06:28] partnership
[1:06:29] for everything they do in the marriage
[1:06:30] they're accountable for but if they
[1:06:32] leave and go out here if they're not
[1:06:33] accountable to it know you're one if you
[1:06:36] leave you take her with you if you leave
[1:06:39] you take him with you and so it's not a
[1:06:42] partnership it's not 50/50 sometimes
[1:06:44] it's a hundred to domestic and it has to
[1:06:49] go both ways when you get married you
[1:06:50] have to commit that you're willing to do
[1:06:53] 100 percent of everything that needs to
[1:06:55] be done to stay married and that's quite
[1:06:59] a commitment but there's times it takes
[1:07:01] that but then it'll swing back the other
[1:07:04] way and so there's times when you have
[1:07:07] to take up for the weakness of someone
[1:07:08] else but that's the oneness of it and
[1:07:12] there's no amount of fear or in this
[1:07:15] relationship specifically there's no
[1:07:17] amount of of holding the scripture over
[1:07:19] your wife's head that will ever make you
[1:07:21] her submit to you there's no amount of
[1:07:24] holding the scripture of your husband's
[1:07:25] head that'll ever make him love you but
[1:07:29] there's got to be love if there's not
[1:07:31] love there it's never gonna work only
[1:07:34] love can do that as quoted by Martin
[1:07:37] Luther King hate can't do that only love
[1:07:39] can do that well only love can keep a
[1:07:41] marriage together no amount of fear will
[1:07:44] ever make you accountable to one another
[1:07:46] I spent a little extra time on that
[1:07:48] because I believe that it's needful it I
[1:07:50] know I need it because we have to
[1:07:52] remember what we're doing we're not
[1:07:53] we're not separate we don't do things
[1:07:56] separately now if I wanted to have my
[1:07:58] own bank account that'd be fine but she
[1:08:00] has a right to know what's in it an
[1:08:02] absolute right to know how much money I
[1:08:05] make and what's in it because one of the
[1:08:06] things that I found is that what happens
[1:08:09] is when people start separating in their
[1:08:11] finances then they begin to separate in
[1:08:12] their oneness and pretty soon it's okay
[1:08:15] to do just whatever as long as I do it
[1:08:17] on my own time know my time is hers
[1:08:19] and her time is mine even when it comes
[1:08:22] to the Lord because Paul says the
[1:08:25] married man has to think of the things
[1:08:26] of his wife
[1:08:27] so there's times brother branham was
[1:08:30] going to move to Arizona but he waited
[1:08:31] until his wife was ready there's a
[1:08:34] reason for that because he was
[1:08:36] accountable to his wife and maybe I'm
[1:08:40] going out on a limb because I'm not
[1:08:42] preaching to very many here
[1:08:43] tonight but you just hang with me I feel
[1:08:45] like I'm just really really giving you
[1:08:47] the the business tonight you know you
[1:08:49] only got a few sitting here but but you
[1:08:52] know there's there's a level at which
[1:08:53] you're more accountable to your spouse
[1:08:55] than you are to God and in this sense
[1:08:58] that you are so accountable to that
[1:09:01] person that brother Baron said if you
[1:09:03] sinned against that person you'd want
[1:09:04] you'd have to repeat to them first
[1:09:07] because you send so much against God is
[1:09:09] against them because that marriage
[1:09:12] relationship has to be right so that's
[1:09:13] why Peter says God won't even hear your
[1:09:15] prayers unless you're one and that
[1:09:19] that's hard on all of us but we need to
[1:09:21] we need to take a good look at where we
[1:09:22] live and how we live now but embarrassed
[1:09:26] I wouldn't this be some sort of family
[1:09:27] to live in if I gather my family around
[1:09:29] me and I'd say lookee here missus
[1:09:31] Brenham you want to realize that you're
[1:09:32] mrs. William Branham thou shalt not have
[1:09:34] any other husbands while I'm gone don't
[1:09:37] you make eyes at any other man all these
[1:09:38] things don't you flirt at all if you do
[1:09:40] when I come back I'm gonna divorce you
[1:09:42] she'd turn around saying I'm a good man
[1:09:44] I want to tell you something also thou
[1:09:46] shalt not take out any other woman while
[1:09:48] you're gone
[1:09:49] thou shalt not do this or that if out if
[1:09:51] you do just consider yourself divorced
[1:09:53] when you come home
[1:09:54] he said now wouldn't that be a loving
[1:09:56] family C no if I really love her though
[1:09:59] I believe if I did make a mistake and
[1:10:00] slip and do something wrong I believe
[1:10:02] she'd forgive me for it because she
[1:10:04] loves me
[1:10:04] and if she did I believe I'd forgive her
[1:10:07] for it certainly because I love her but
[1:10:09] if I loved her like that as long as I
[1:10:11] love her like that she has no worry
[1:10:14] though she would forgive me I wouldn't
[1:10:16] hurt her for nothing
[1:10:17] I feel the guiltiest guy in the world I
[1:10:19] couldn't wait for the minute I'd tell
[1:10:21] her about what I'd done because I loved
[1:10:23] her well how are they held accountable
[1:10:26] they were held accountable to one
[1:10:27] another by love that's how we're held
[1:10:29] accountable to God because we love it
[1:10:32] love holds us accountable to its word
[1:10:35] when fear won't do it fear of Hell won't
[1:10:39] do it fear of losing your inheritance
[1:10:42] won't do it but it's love that doesn't
[1:10:46] we're accountable to government Romans
[1:10:50] 13 and 1 let every soul be subject unto
[1:10:53] the higher powers
[1:10:55] no power but of God the powers that be
[1:10:57] are ordained of God that's hard to
[1:10:59] remember sometimes and especially for
[1:11:03] them in that day because he was talking
[1:11:04] about Nero the powers that be in that
[1:11:07] day was Nero and those under him who was
[1:11:10] perhaps perhaps the most anti-christian
[1:11:12] government that ever was on the face of
[1:11:14] the earth was the government of that day
[1:11:17] and Jesus said give to Caesar what
[1:11:20] Caesar's the most anti-christian
[1:11:23] government the most anti-christian
[1:11:25] system possible and Jesus said give to
[1:11:28] Caesar what is Caesar's but to God what
[1:11:32] is God's
[1:11:33] but there's also responsibility of the
[1:11:35] government we'll look at that in
[1:11:36] Deuteronomy chapter 17 and verse 16
[1:11:38] because this works not just in
[1:11:40] government and natural governments but
[1:11:43] also in the church and it even works in
[1:11:45] our homes because just because we have
[1:11:48] the ability to take certain prerogatives
[1:11:51] don't mean that we should write
[1:11:54] Deuteronomy 1716 but he shall not
[1:11:57] multiply horses to himself now he's
[1:11:59] talking about when Moses knew that one
[1:12:01] day they'd want a king he said when you
[1:12:03] do get a king he said here's how the
[1:12:05] king should act so there were
[1:12:07] limitations on what a king could do he
[1:12:10] shall not multiply horses to himself nor
[1:12:12] caused the people to return to Egypt so
[1:12:14] in other words he shouldn't have a fleet
[1:12:16] of Cadillacs right and he shouldn't make
[1:12:21] the people go back into nomination list
[1:12:22] and say doesn't believe the message no
[1:12:24] more if we just take it and put it in
[1:12:26] our perspective he said to the end that
[1:12:29] he should multiply horses for as much as
[1:12:30] the Lord said unto you you shall his
[1:12:32] fourth return no more that way neither
[1:12:35] shall he multiply wives to himself his
[1:12:38] heart turned out away neither shall he
[1:12:41] greatly multiply to himself silver and
[1:12:43] gold and it shall be when he sitteth
[1:12:45] upon the throne of his kingdom he shall
[1:12:47] write him a copy of this law in a book
[1:12:48] out of that which is before the priests
[1:12:50] of the Levites and it shall be with him
[1:12:52] he shall read therein all the days of
[1:12:54] his life that he may learn to fear the
[1:12:56] Lord his God and to keep all the words
[1:12:58] of this law and these statutes to do
[1:13:00] them why was it the king was accountable
[1:13:02] to God and he was accountable for what
[1:13:07] he did to the people
[1:13:08] and for the people now he said that he
[1:13:12] have not his heart be not lifted up
[1:13:14] above his brethren i watch so he needs
[1:13:18] to make sure that he keeps himself in
[1:13:21] the word so that he doesn't get a big
[1:13:23] head right that his heart be not lifted
[1:13:27] up above his brethren that he turned out
[1:13:29] aside from the commandment to the
[1:13:31] right-hander's for the left to the end
[1:13:34] that he may prolong his days in his
[1:13:36] kingdom he and his children in the midst
[1:13:38] of Israel so we see the responsibilities
[1:13:42] of a king or we could say of a pastor or
[1:13:45] of a of a person who's in a position of
[1:13:48] authority a husband in the home there's
[1:13:50] a responsibility there to those that are
[1:13:53] governed there's a responsibility
[1:13:54] employer hasn't Titus chapter 2 and
[1:13:56] verse 9 will hurry through this Titus
[1:13:59] chapter 2 and verse 9 and exhort
[1:14:00] servants to be obedient unto their own
[1:14:01] masters and to please them well in all
[1:14:04] things not answering again
[1:14:05] oh that's been hard for me over the
[1:14:08] years I worked for a lot of years in an
[1:14:11] office and that not answering again is
[1:14:13] hard but there's times you know I
[1:14:18] remember some years ago in an office I
[1:14:21] was sitting in an office and I was so
[1:14:23] mad at the way people were doing stuff
[1:14:26] and I had a co-worker a young lady that
[1:14:28] was sitting on the other side of the
[1:14:30] office we had cubicles and she was
[1:14:31] sitting where she could hear me and I
[1:14:33] was mad I wasn't saying anything wrong
[1:14:34] or anything like that but I was just she
[1:14:36] could she knew I was upset because of
[1:14:39] the way people did things and they just
[1:14:41] made my job harder and seemed like they
[1:14:42] did it on purpose
[1:14:43] and I got really upset and she was not a
[1:14:47] Christian and she knew I was a preacher
[1:14:49] and she was sitting over there and after
[1:14:50] a while she collared at me she said
[1:14:52] would Jesus have said that and I felt
[1:14:57] pretty low I got up the next that Sunday
[1:15:02] morning after a couple days it was
[1:15:04] Sunday and I got up in front of the
[1:15:06] church at 4:00 the Ivies in work and
[1:15:07] apologized for my attitude even though
[1:15:10] they hadn't known about it but I felt so
[1:15:11] bad about it I thought you know that's
[1:15:13] not that's not the Spirit of Christ and
[1:15:16] she knew enough about it to know that
[1:15:18] but we'll all get up there'll be
[1:15:21] seasons that we have but he said not
[1:15:23] answering again so we have and it were
[1:15:24] accountable to God for the way we treat
[1:15:29] our employer think about that but the
[1:15:34] employer is also accountable for the
[1:15:37] employee and you masters do the same
[1:15:39] things unto them he says forbearing
[1:15:43] threatening knowing that your master
[1:15:46] also is in heaven neither is their
[1:15:49] respective persons with him we'll look
[1:15:53] again as we look at these relationships
[1:15:55] with one another and in life you look at
[1:15:58] a pastor and and that's something that
[1:16:00] we've just recently come in here and
[1:16:03] it's something that's on my heart that I
[1:16:04] have to be accountable and and we have
[1:16:08] to be accountable to one another and he
[1:16:10] says obey them that have the rule over
[1:16:11] you and submit yourselves for they watch
[1:16:14] for your souls when he's speaking of
[1:16:15] secular Authority and also in the church
[1:16:17] he said as they that must give account
[1:16:20] that they may do it with joy and not
[1:16:22] with grief for that is unprofitable for
[1:16:24] you so he says obey them that have the
[1:16:26] rule over you and again that speaks of
[1:16:28] secular authority but I believe it also
[1:16:30] applies to the church now Paul makes a
[1:16:33] strange statement and I'll just say this
[1:16:36] before moving on he says I am jealous
[1:16:39] over you with godly jealousy and that
[1:16:41] first word is different from the second
[1:16:43] word if you go back in the original the
[1:16:44] first word jealous is actually I have a
[1:16:46] deal for you but he says with godly
[1:16:50] jealousy and that word is actually
[1:16:51] jealousy like between a husband and wife
[1:16:54] it's jealousy he said for I have
[1:16:57] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:17:00] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[1:17:03] and it really struck me because it made
[1:17:07] him accountable for their virginity if
[1:17:09] we could say it that way he was
[1:17:10] accountable for their purity he was
[1:17:14] accountable that when they were
[1:17:16] presented to Christ and so he would sell
[1:17:18] us about it about keeping false doctrine
[1:17:21] away and all of these things because he
[1:17:23] says I having espoused her and engaged
[1:17:25] you to one husband now he was not
[1:17:28] jealous that someone else might take his
[1:17:30] place but he was jealous that some other
[1:17:33] man
[1:17:34] I take Christ's place are you with me
[1:17:37] today I have espoused you to one husband
[1:17:40] I don't want anybody to take his place
[1:17:43] so I'm jealous for him and Paul is
[1:17:46] alluding to the the practice that was
[1:17:48] exemplified by John the Baptist when he
[1:17:50] says I'm the one that stands by the
[1:17:52] bridegroom I'm the friend of the
[1:17:53] bridegroom
[1:17:54] so I'm jealous over you with godly
[1:17:56] jealousy because not because I might be
[1:17:58] replaced but because you might replace
[1:18:00] him you might go find some other lover
[1:18:03] some other husband Oh church if we can
[1:18:06] only recognize that's why we're so
[1:18:08] zealous for the word it's not because
[1:18:10] you might change preachers but it's so
[1:18:13] it's because you might change God or
[1:18:16] change who how you approach God and
[1:18:19] there's only one way that we can come to
[1:18:21] God and that same God has provided way
[1:18:24] and gods provided place which is Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ the congregation the pastor is
[1:18:30] responsible is accountable to God for
[1:18:33] the congregation but he's also
[1:18:34] accountable to the congregation feed the
[1:18:36] flock of God which is among you taking
[1:18:38] the oversight thereof not by constraint
[1:18:40] but willingly constraint works both ways
[1:18:42] he's saying don't be made to serve the
[1:18:44] people you know any also he's also
[1:18:47] saying do not force the people to listen
[1:18:49] that's hard to remember because Moses
[1:18:54] took the rod and he struck the rock he
[1:18:55] said you rebels he said I'll show you
[1:18:59] and God didn't let him go in the
[1:19:00] promised land for it because they're not
[1:19:03] God's sheep or not to be led by
[1:19:05] constraint but willingly not for filthy
[1:19:08] lucre money but of a ready mind because
[1:19:11] that's that's what's in your heart and
[1:19:12] your mind to do neither as being lords
[1:19:15] over God's heritage but being examples
[1:19:16] to the flock we've talked about that
[1:19:18] before that's behaving in a haughty
[1:19:20] domineering manner as though you had
[1:19:21] dominion over the conscience of the
[1:19:23] people the word heritage is literally
[1:19:26] God's portions God's portions he has
[1:19:29] different portions everywhere there's
[1:19:31] portions here tonight portions listening
[1:19:33] in portions in other places I'm not
[1:19:35] responsible for the other portions I'm
[1:19:37] accountable for this portion and so I
[1:19:40] have to be an example to this portion
[1:19:42] I'm not a lord or a bishop over God's
[1:19:45] portions I'm accountable for this one
[1:19:48] first Peter five four and when the chief
[1:19:50] Shepherd shall appear you should receive
[1:19:52] a crown of glory that fadeth not away
[1:19:54] and this is the benefit of
[1:19:56] accountability
[1:19:57] you see accountability brings benefits
[1:20:00] in our lives and it's a big deal in
[1:20:03] corporate circles because they realize
[1:20:05] it brings benefits to a business if you
[1:20:07] can hold a leader accountable and the
[1:20:09] workers accountable and then it brings a
[1:20:11] great benefit that the business can
[1:20:12] thrive but we realized when we can be
[1:20:15] accountable in our homes in our
[1:20:17] marriages in our church if we can be
[1:20:20] accountable to God it does bring
[1:20:22] cooperation it does cause trust to be
[1:20:25] formed but it also brings eternal
[1:20:27] rewards he says when the chief Shepherd
[1:20:30] shall appear you'll receive a crown of
[1:20:32] glory that fadeth not away but the brand
[1:20:37] says yes I can see that God is going to
[1:20:38] give a special reward to his messengers
[1:20:40] and he's talking about those seven
[1:20:42] messengers that were in his hand he said
[1:20:45] who have faithfully discharged the
[1:20:46] responsibility he has placed upon them
[1:20:49] if they have received the revelation of
[1:20:52] the word for that age and faithfully
[1:20:53] preached in their day and lived what
[1:20:57] they preach they will receive a great
[1:20:59] reward 2nd Timothy 4:7 Paul is himself
[1:21:06] anticipating that reward he said I have
[1:21:08] fought a good fight I have finished my
[1:21:11] course I have kept the faith that seems
[1:21:13] like a bold thing to say but Paul could
[1:21:16] look back at his life and say I didn't
[1:21:17] know he served God
[1:21:18] but when I did I served him with all of
[1:21:20] my heart I made mistakes many times but
[1:21:23] but I always followed the will of God
[1:21:26] and I repented when I made those
[1:21:27] mistakes when ever was revealed to me I
[1:21:30] followed God I fought a good fight sure
[1:21:32] I got bloodied sometimes but it was a
[1:21:34] good fight I never just gave in I have
[1:21:38] finished my course I have kept the faith
[1:21:40] his fourth there is laid up for me a
[1:21:42] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:21:44] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:21:46] that day not to me only but unto all
[1:21:49] them also that love his appearing
[1:21:55] there's a reward waiting and I want you
[1:21:59] to notice as we're closing in just a
[1:22:01] moment
[1:22:01] I think that's the third time I've said
[1:22:03] that I get three every service but you
[1:22:11] go back to Jesus as he nears the end of
[1:22:14] his life and you see Paul they're
[1:22:15] nearing the end of his ministry begins
[1:22:17] to get retrospective about his ministry
[1:22:19] and he says I've fought a good fight
[1:22:20] I've kept the faith Jesus gets near the
[1:22:23] end of his earthly ministry and he says
[1:22:25] while I was with him in the world I kept
[1:22:27] them in thy name
[1:22:29] now it says if his ministry now is being
[1:22:33] over that God is holding him to attempt
[1:22:36] he's walking up to the Father and he's
[1:22:38] saying here's Peter here's Andrew here's
[1:22:41] Thomas Dowling Thomas but he was still a
[1:22:46] disciple here's Philip here's Matthew
[1:22:50] here's all the disciples they're all
[1:22:53] yours
[1:22:53] I have kept them in thy name when we
[1:22:59] think about that we looking back around
[1:23:00] our home lives we say well maybe if I'd
[1:23:03] have witness more to this person they'd
[1:23:04] have done better maybe if I'd have done
[1:23:06] this state have done better but listen
[1:23:08] he said I have kept him in thy name
[1:23:10] those that thou gave us to me I have
[1:23:13] kept and none of them is lost none of
[1:23:19] them is lost you realize that when Paul
[1:23:20] says I have another body already waiting
[1:23:23] in the heavens that God does not have
[1:23:27] some kind of machine that does away with
[1:23:28] the bodies that don't get used you would
[1:23:32] think about that every word body every
[1:23:35] word bride person if you can say it that
[1:23:37] way every member of the word bride will
[1:23:39] come to a word body there's no ability
[1:23:43] to do away with the word body he says so
[1:23:50] he says none of them is lost with the
[1:23:51] son of perdition that the scripture
[1:23:53] might be fulfilled so he said every one
[1:23:57] of them I'm gonna give an account for
[1:23:58] and I'm also given a going to give an
[1:24:00] account for the Serpent's eat among us
[1:24:03] and the only reason well I'd love to be
[1:24:08] able to say this when I get to the end
[1:24:09] of my ministry but I'm afraid I probably
[1:24:10] couldn't I'm thankful that he could
[1:24:16] because he says none of them is lost
[1:24:18] with the son of perdition the only
[1:24:19] person who did not make it was one who's
[1:24:23] given every opportunity to make it but
[1:24:26] he was the son of perdition from the
[1:24:27] beginning now listen
[1:24:31] he was so accountable with Judas and see
[1:24:37] we think we we say well I'm accountable
[1:24:38] to them because they treat me right no
[1:24:41] we're accountable to everybody we meet
[1:24:44] everybody God puts in our realm of
[1:24:46] influence everybody that he puts in the
[1:24:48] church good or bad smart or dumb
[1:24:52] I'm glad the Devils included because
[1:24:54] that includes me
[1:24:56] but everyone he puts in the church we're
[1:24:58] responsible for them
[1:24:59] everyone who's put in the sphere of the
[1:25:02] influence of our life we are accountable
[1:25:04] for them some of them won't make it but
[1:25:09] let it be because that's what was in
[1:25:11] their heart at the end when it comes to
[1:25:16] the time when Judas comes up with the
[1:25:18] light tone judgment did imagine what
[1:25:20] that will be like because he'll speak to
[1:25:22] Jesus directly remember the Saints will
[1:25:24] judge to the earth but Judas was with
[1:25:27] Jesus and Jesus will say to him didn't I
[1:25:30] treat you like the rest of the disciples
[1:25:34] think about that for a minute didn't I
[1:25:36] treat you like the rest of them at the
[1:25:38] Last Supper they didn't even know who
[1:25:40] the one was even when Jesus identified
[1:25:43] directly that Judas was the one they
[1:25:45] didn't believe it because Jesus never
[1:25:47] treated him any differently even knowing
[1:25:50] who he was and so he'll stand there and
[1:25:52] say did not give you a gift to preach
[1:25:54] did not treat you the same as all the
[1:25:56] other disciples did not do everything
[1:26:01] right in front of you and give you such
[1:26:04] an example to follow that you had a
[1:26:05] pastor who never sinned see you won't
[1:26:09] ever be able to say that but Judas could
[1:26:10] say that but he did what was in his
[1:26:14] heart do you realize that Jesus did not
[1:26:18] lose one of them and he will not lose
[1:26:21] one of us and I got thinking about that
[1:26:26] but David is he do that
[1:26:28] because if I look but Joe if my own
[1:26:30] ministry and I look at what I can do I
[1:26:32] can see that some would be lost because
[1:26:35] they just couldn't put up with me but
[1:26:37] somehow I'm so thankful for the grace of
[1:26:41] God somehow with all the problems of
[1:26:46] ministry and all the problems God will
[1:26:48] send enough preachers into your life
[1:26:51] that you can be reached he'll send
[1:26:55] enough ministry you may have a bad one
[1:26:58] after a bad one after bad one but there
[1:27:00] will be somebody who come to your life
[1:27:02] that'll preach the truth because God is
[1:27:05] accountable to every one of his seed and
[1:27:08] he is accountable for every one of his
[1:27:11] feet he said none of them is lost and he
[1:27:14] does that not through one person so you
[1:27:16] can't reach everybody brother going
[1:27:18] through my ministry but he does it
[1:27:19] through an entire body so somehow
[1:27:22] through the body of Christ that is on
[1:27:25] the earth today every child of God will
[1:27:28] be saved do you ever think about that
[1:27:32] because when the last one comes in we'll
[1:27:34] go home and somehow every one of them
[1:27:38] won't be reached how does he do it he's
[1:27:39] not doing it just through osmosis or
[1:27:41] through the air he speaks through men
[1:27:43] and somehow God has enough men on the
[1:27:46] earth today that'll preach the gospel
[1:27:48] somehow he's got enough people in the
[1:27:51] earth today that can live the gospel or
[1:27:53] hope you're with me today
[1:27:55] he is so accountable to those that are
[1:27:58] in his bride those are in his mind that
[1:28:00] he will not lose one of them and he has
[1:28:03] to send preacher after preacher after
[1:28:05] preacher they will be found if one don't
[1:28:09] get them and another one don't get them
[1:28:10] there will be a time and a place when
[1:28:12] they will be found because none of them
[1:28:14] is lost except those who were meant to
[1:28:17] be that's why when we get to heaven the
[1:28:23] Bible says that the Saints cast the
[1:28:24] crowns at his feet because we couldn't
[1:28:30] do it we weren't even worthy of the
[1:28:32] rewards that we got because we couldn't
[1:28:33] do it without him he's the one that
[1:28:36] makes it work well I'm looking forward
[1:28:41] to that day
[1:28:43] I'm looking forward to that I believe in
[1:28:45] that I'm not one you know there's a lot
[1:28:47] of things we spiritual eyes but I don't
[1:28:49] believe in that's necessarily a
[1:28:51] spiritual thing I don't know exactly how
[1:28:53] it will happen but somehow we're going
[1:28:55] to cast our crowns at his feet
[1:28:56] whatever rewards that we earned be cast
[1:29:00] at his feet but the band tells the story
[1:29:03] if the musicians want to go ahead and
[1:29:04] come he tells the story about an old an
[1:29:08] old preacher named Sam and the old
[1:29:11] preacher had preached for the Lord all
[1:29:14] of these years and he finally got down
[1:29:15] to his deathbed and the people come to
[1:29:18] honor him and and he had he fell into it
[1:29:22] like a trance and he come back out as he
[1:29:24] says he's going coming in going out
[1:29:25] they said Sam what did you see what's on
[1:29:29] the other side he said well I thought
[1:29:33] I'd just come in the gate they just let
[1:29:35] me in said I was standing there and said
[1:29:38] one of the angels run up and said Sam
[1:29:40] come over now to receive your robe in
[1:29:42] your crown he said robe and Crown I
[1:29:48] don't want no robe and Crown
[1:29:51] just let me stand there and look at him
[1:29:55] because he makes it work because as much
[1:29:59] as I could be as I am accountable for
[1:30:01] you and I can be accountable I'm still
[1:30:03] human but he makes it work somehow the
[1:30:06] grace of God made causes the right
[1:30:09] person to come at the right time to
[1:30:10] speak to that soul sit don't talk to me
[1:30:15] about a robe and Crown I don't wonder a
[1:30:17] robe and Crown just then let me stand
[1:30:19] there and look at him for a thousand
[1:30:21] years
[1:30:21] that's enough robe and Crown I'm so glad
[1:30:26] that every one of us will have that
[1:30:29] opportunity but guest our crowns at his
[1:30:32] feet say thou art worthy thou art worthy
[1:30:36] because we couldn't do it on our own
[1:30:38] aren't you grateful for that today bow
[1:30:41] our hips if you know that old song when
[1:30:43] he reached on his hand for me
[1:30:50] Heavenly Father were so grateful or
[1:30:54] tonight's been a little different and
[1:30:55] none of us expected for it to be this
[1:30:57] way I didn't know until about three or
[1:31:00] four o'clock this afternoon we'd be
[1:31:01] doing this but so grateful Lord that you
[1:31:06] are accountable somehow you're
[1:31:12] accountable for the way this service
[1:31:13] goes I'm grateful for that Lord even for
[1:31:19] Judas you give an account for why he did
[1:31:21] what he did he was the son of perdition
[1:31:23] Oh God
[1:31:26] I thank you for that or I pray you would
[1:31:30] help us to rest in that tonight but as
[1:31:33] we look at these areas of our life and
[1:31:35] we see Lord different relationships in
[1:31:38] our life I pray you'd help us to be
[1:31:40] accountable to reflect you in that Lord
[1:31:43] as we reflect you in responsibility as
[1:31:46] we reflect you in all of these other
[1:31:48] things that we've talked about and
[1:31:51] faithfulness and we also wish reflects
[1:31:54] you and accountability that when the
[1:31:57] time comes for us to give an account for
[1:32:00] our lives that will stand there and say
[1:32:02] the time I gave my life to you Lord I
[1:32:05] made many mistakes but every one of them
[1:32:09] has been repent enough I turned quickly
[1:32:11] back to your life and your throne and I
[1:32:15] told everyone that I could about your
[1:32:18] love I displayed that love in my life
[1:32:21] may it be so Lord and we'd be able to
[1:32:24] say on that they may we not be
[1:32:25] embarrassed when we get there well I was
[1:32:28] hardly every Church I hardly ever did
[1:32:30] what I was supposed to do but but I made
[1:32:32] it oh God may we be able to stand there
[1:32:35] say Lord I want a crown so I can give
[1:32:39] him back to you I want to I want to see
[1:32:42] a reward like Paul said there's a great
[1:32:44] crown there's a great reward waiting but
[1:32:46] I want it so I can give it back
[1:32:49] a pretty good granite lord help us to
[1:32:51] set our mind on eternal things to
[1:32:54] anticipate eternal rewards so that we
[1:32:56] can receive earthly rewards those will
[1:33:01] come Lord but we want to anticipate
[1:33:03] eternal rewards beyond anything beyond
[1:33:06] the benefits of accountability that come
[1:33:08] naturally
[1:33:09] Lord may we have the benefits
[1:33:11] spiritually I pray thank you for these
[1:33:14] people Lord that have common Lord those
[1:33:16] that many that are watching tonight by
[1:33:18] streaming and those that'll hear later
[1:33:21] Lord I pray you'd help them they realize
[1:33:24] they're accountable for what they've
[1:33:25] heard I may not have set it all right
[1:33:26] but somehow you are accountable to your
