[4:31] hello and welcome to our
[4:33] uh study on first corinthians uh once
[4:35] again
[4:36] we're going to start or continue with
[4:39] chapter three
[4:40] and we'll be starting today um
[4:44] we'll be starting today with first 10.
[4:46] so we'll continue with that today and
[4:48] i'll give you just a minute to get on
[4:50] and then we'll have a word of prayer
[4:52] there's a couple of
[4:53] special requests we want to be
[4:54] remembering today
[4:56] and we've got
[5:00] just to go back over some of what we had
[5:02] said in in chapter 2
[5:06] or chapter 3 rather um
[5:10] i actually have the wrong review data on
[5:12] there but
[5:13] uh we the information is correct
[5:15] spiritual versus carnal
[5:18] uh we found out that there was a
[5:19] difference between how you could teach
[5:21] someone who was spiritual versus someone
[5:23] who was carnal
[5:25] we also found out that the corinthian
[5:27] church was carnal in word thought and
[5:29] deed
[5:30] so that there was remember envying
[5:34] strife and divisions among them it says
[5:36] are you not carnal and walk as men
[5:38] as carnal and word in envying
[5:41] strife thought and deed and
[5:44] division so he says are you not carnal
[5:47] and walk as men
[5:49] i found out that paul and apollos were
[5:50] ministers and that come from the word
[5:52] servant and it meant that they were
[5:55] as jesus put an unprofitable servants in
[5:58] other words
[5:58] you do just what is your duty to do you
[6:01] don't do
[6:03] something just because for any glory or
[6:05] you don't get any
[6:07] of the benefits from it you do it and
[6:09] that's what god called you to do it's
[6:11] committed to you to do that you're a
[6:12] steward
[6:13] there is rewards for it but it's in
[6:15] another place on the other side
[6:17] and so he says you're carnal because you
[6:20] say you're of paul or apollos
[6:21] we also found out that we're god's
[6:23] building so whoever god
[6:25] uses to build us with we are god's
[6:28] building
[6:29] the building never belongs to the
[6:31] workmen the building belongs to god
[6:34] and we are the ones who work on god's
[6:38] building and so we should treat
[6:39] the people like that so
[6:42] we're going to begin today with first
[6:44] corinthians 3 10 and before we do
[6:46] let's have a word of prayer i want to
[6:48] remember a sister in our church sister
[6:49] mary
[6:50] who has a surgery today on her hand and
[6:52] outpatient surgery
[6:54] she'll be remembering her and each one
[6:56] that's sick or in need
[6:57] and the situation with the coronavirus
[6:59] and of course our nation uh going
[7:02] through the time that it is and knowing
[7:03] that we're in the end times
[7:05] but we want to pray one for another and
[7:07] and have the right attitude towards one
[7:08] another let's pray heavenly father
[7:11] thank you for bringing us lord to this
[7:13] place today
[7:14] lord and i don't know who will watch and
[7:16] or who will listen but lord i pray that
[7:18] each one that does will be blessed
[7:20] father we pray that our efforts would
[7:23] the lord be fruitful
[7:24] or we know that your word does not go
[7:26] forth void so we ask you to come and
[7:28] just bless us today and
[7:29] and bless sister mary in this surgery i
[7:31] pray that you'd give her strength
[7:33] and each one dealing with the
[7:34] chronovirus situations and different
[7:36] things lord we know that you're still
[7:38] god
[7:38] and you still have control over
[7:40] everything so we thank you for all that
[7:42] you do and we ask you to bless
[7:44] what we do today in our bible study in
[7:46] jesus name
[7:47] amen so
[7:50] first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 10
[7:55] says according to the grace of god which
[7:57] is given unto me as a wise
[7:59] master builder and if you underline in
[8:02] your bible you can underline that master
[8:04] builder
[8:06] he says i am a wise master builder we
[8:08] talked about the other day in church
[8:10] about what it meant to be
[8:12] wise and how that god intends for us to
[8:14] use our brains
[8:16] but he says a wise master builder he
[8:19] said i've laid the foundation and
[8:20] another buildeth thereon
[8:22] but let every man take heed how he
[8:25] buildeth
[8:25] thereupon in other words make sure that
[8:28] it matches the idea
[8:30] of what i had in the first place let's
[8:32] make sure that
[8:34] if the first builder was a master
[8:36] builder let's make sure that we follow
[8:38] his pattern
[8:40] so that word master builder is literally
[8:41] an architect
[8:43] and it's a good way to think about paul
[8:46] as the architect
[8:47] of what we believe when it comes to the
[8:49] doctrines of grace
[8:51] that's paul now he got those plans from
[8:54] somewhere he got that ability to build
[8:57] from somewhere where does he get it from
[8:59] he gets it by revelation from god so
[9:02] we don't lightly move away from the
[9:06] things that paul taught us
[9:08] because these are the very foundations
[9:10] of our faith
[9:11] this is what we believe is what paul
[9:14] wrote
[9:15] in the scriptures is what we believe
[9:17] because
[9:18] he was a master builder and he called
[9:20] himself that not to give himself glory
[9:21] because he says by grace
[9:23] that i'm a master builder so the word is
[9:26] architect on which work which is where
[9:28] we get
[9:29] our word architect and it would be a
[9:31] superintendent in the in the erection of
[9:33] buildings
[9:34] so uh wesley puts it this way he said
[9:37] according to the grace of god given to
[9:39] me this
[9:40] he promises lest he should seem to
[9:41] ascribe it to himself
[9:44] let everyone take heed how he buildeth
[9:46] thereon
[9:47] that all his doctrines may be consistent
[9:50] with the foundation
[9:52] that's very important even today we look
[9:54] at the message of the hour our doctrine
[9:56] what we believe has to be consistent
[9:58] with the foundation it's got to fit the
[10:01] pattern
[10:01] that's already been laid and you'll find
[10:04] that in the old testament when
[10:06] moses made a pattern or had a pattern he
[10:09] was shown by god a pattern for the
[10:11] tabernacle in the wilderness
[10:13] which would be a type of the temple but
[10:15] today we're
[10:16] temples we'll find in just a moment so
[10:18] there's a pattern for our lives for our
[10:20] doctrine for how we conduct ourselves
[10:23] and so god had a a
[10:26] tabernacle in heaven and he showed the
[10:28] pattern of that to moses and moses built
[10:30] according to that pattern
[10:32] here on the earth so in exodus 25 9 he
[10:35] says according to all that i show thee
[10:38] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[10:40] the pattern of all the instruments
[10:41] thereof
[10:42] even so shall you make it make it like
[10:45] this he says don't deviate from it
[10:47] don't change it keep it like the pattern
[10:52] in first chronicles 21 28 19 you find
[10:54] where david
[10:56] also received a pattern and he gave it
[10:59] to solomon
[11:00] so he it's like he draws these
[11:02] blueprints and he gives them to solomon
[11:04] he says now i'm the architect
[11:06] i'm the master builder and i'm giving
[11:07] this to you to follow
[11:09] uh the foundation that i've laid and
[11:13] and david said the all this the lord
[11:15] made me understand in writing by his
[11:17] hand upon me
[11:19] even all the works of this pattern even
[11:22] to how much the vessels of gold would
[11:25] weigh in the temple why is that because
[11:29] god cares about the details and god
[11:32] cares about the details of what we
[11:33] believe
[11:34] god cares about doctrine god cares about
[11:36] conduct god cares about these things and
[11:38] so
[11:39] these are things that we can't change we
[11:41] don't get to change and i've used the
[11:43] illustration often we don't get to
[11:44] change male to female
[11:46] we don't get to just because we decide
[11:48] that it doesn't matter
[11:49] say that it doesn't matter if uh if you
[11:52] do
[11:52] certain things before you get married or
[11:54] not it doesn't matter if you do things
[11:55] outside the marriage covenant
[11:57] it does matter because we don't get to
[11:59] change the pattern
[12:00] it matters because god set it in motion
[12:02] that way
[12:03] and you find when people go according to
[12:06] the pattern that their conduct
[12:08] is is better and when their conduct is
[12:11] better their lives are better
[12:12] that they have peace and happiness and
[12:14] joy because they followed the pattern of
[12:16] god
[12:17] and when you follow the pattern that's
[12:19] when god anoints and god moves as he did
[12:22] in the temple when solomon built it
[12:25] now brother branham calls paul a pattern
[12:27] and i'm kind of digressing here but
[12:28] we're not going to do that very much
[12:30] through the rest of this to save time
[12:33] but paul says internet or brother
[12:35] branham says rather that paul
[12:37] is a pattern for the rest of the church
[12:40] ages and this is in the ephesian church
[12:41] age he said his manner of ministering
[12:44] set the pattern that all future
[12:47] messengers were set to aspire to
[12:50] and actually sets the pattern for every
[12:53] true minister of god
[12:55] is this showing up there this one okay
[12:58] actually that's the pattern for every
[13:00] true minister of god i've got peter here
[13:01] with me
[13:02] he said though he would not attain to
[13:04] such heights in the prophetic realm as
[13:06] did paul
[13:07] so these other men these other
[13:10] messengers would not attain to the
[13:12] heights of the prophetic realm of course
[13:13] until the last age
[13:15] as did paul but paul's ministry had a
[13:18] threefold quality that each one of these
[13:20] ministries would have
[13:22] let's see what that was and you can go
[13:24] in the efficient church age and look
[13:26] this up but the random elaborates on
[13:27] these but these
[13:28] are the qualities he said that paul had
[13:30] in that pattern
[13:32] he said paul was absolutely true to the
[13:35] word
[13:36] and that's the first thing that you'll
[13:38] find in any true messenger today
[13:40] and any true minister that they will be
[13:42] absolutely true to the word
[13:45] and number two his ministry was in the
[13:47] power of the spirit thereby
[13:48] demonstrating the spoken and written
[13:50] word so it won't
[13:51] just come in teaching only but in the
[13:54] power and demonstration of the spirit
[13:55] not in letter only because the letter
[13:57] kills but spirit gives life
[13:59] and then number three he had the evident
[14:01] fruit of his god-given ministry
[14:03] this is important someone tells you well
[14:06] i'm i have a
[14:09] ministry i have a special revelation for
[14:12] from god for the people
[14:14] where's the fruit of your ministry
[14:15] because this is the pattern that paul
[14:17] said
[14:17] paul said i don't need letters of
[14:19] recommendation he said you're my letters
[14:21] of recommendation your
[14:23] written epistles read of all men and so
[14:26] any
[14:27] any god called ministry will have
[14:29] results it may not be in great numbers
[14:31] but it'll be in the lives of the people
[14:33] that he preaches to
[14:35] so this is the pattern that was set for
[14:37] us and this will be the pattern that we
[14:38] have to follow
[14:39] let's look at verse 11 first corinthians
[14:41] 3 11.
[14:44] he says now if any man build upon this
[14:46] foundation gold
[14:48] silver i'm sorry let's back up to verse
[14:51] 11. for other foundation can no man lay
[14:54] then that is
[14:54] laid which is jesus christ
[14:58] we can't lay a foundation other than the
[15:00] one that is laid
[15:02] matthew henry said it this way about
[15:04] this and i really like this he said the
[15:06] doctrine of our savior and his mediation
[15:08] is the principled doctrine of
[15:10] christianity it lies at the bottom and
[15:12] is the foundation of all the rest
[15:15] he said if you leave out this you lay
[15:17] waste all our comforts
[15:19] and leave no foundation for our hopes as
[15:21] sinners
[15:22] it is in christ only that god is
[15:24] reconciling a sinful world to himself
[15:26] and remember that
[15:28] he is the foundation paul says no other
[15:30] foundation can any man lay than what
[15:32] i've laid
[15:32] and that foundation is jesus christ he
[15:36] is the principle theme of the scripture
[15:38] and he is the one who has the
[15:39] preeminence so
[15:41] when you have a doctrine or a teaching
[15:44] that devalues
[15:45] christ that devalues jesus that devalues
[15:50] his work and what he did and what he
[15:51] does and what he continues to do
[15:54] then you have a problem because it
[15:55] doesn't build on the foundation
[15:58] it says it is in christ only that god
[16:00] reconciles a sinful world to himself
[16:04] verse 12 i kind of got ahead of myself a
[16:06] minute ago but now we'll go to verse 12.
[16:08] he said now if any men build upon this
[16:09] foundation gold
[16:11] silver precious stones wood hay
[16:15] stubble and you'll notice he goes in
[16:16] descending order gold first
[16:19] silver precious stones would a stubble
[16:23] he said that's descending order of value
[16:26] he says
[16:26] every man's work shall be made manifest
[16:29] for the day shall declare it
[16:33] so let's stop there on verse 12.
[16:37] i keep getting ahead of myself i feel
[16:38] like i'm taking too much time on this
[16:40] because we're going to go through the
[16:41] end of the chapter but let's just stop
[16:43] for a minute
[16:45] what john wesley said if anyone build
[16:47] gold silver
[16:48] costly stones he said three sorts of
[16:50] materials which will bear the fire
[16:52] and notice that the gold silver and
[16:54] costly stones are three different
[16:56] types of ministries but they all build
[16:59] something that'll last that's important
[17:02] because it won't all be the same but
[17:03] it's something that'll last
[17:06] those are true and solid doctrines would
[17:07] hay and stubble are three that will not
[17:09] bear the fire and again they're
[17:10] different types of ministries
[17:12] but they won't bear the fire such are
[17:14] doctrines ceremonies and forms of human
[17:16] invention
[17:17] all but the substantial vital truths of
[17:20] christianity
[17:21] was john wesley so verse 13 every man's
[17:23] work
[17:24] shall be made manifest for the day shall
[17:26] declare it
[17:27] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[17:30] the fire shall try
[17:31] every man's work of what sword it is
[17:35] whether it's wood hay
[17:36] stubble or gold silver or precious
[17:38] stones
[17:40] he says the day shall declare it that's
[17:43] why he says judge nothing before the
[17:44] time as i've been reminding myself
[17:46] lately
[17:47] verse 14 if any man's work abide which
[17:50] he hath built thereupon
[17:51] he shall receive a reward we all want a
[17:54] reward don't we for the things that
[17:56] we've been given
[17:57] we all want a reward for the work that
[17:59] or the work rather that we've done
[18:02] but if your work abides you'll receive a
[18:05] reward
[18:06] but if any man's work should be burned
[18:07] he shall suffer loss
[18:10] so but he himself should be saved
[18:13] yet so as by fire this is verse 15. so
[18:17] he can be pulled like a brand from the
[18:20] fire
[18:21] can be plucked from the fire himself
[18:24] but his work will be lost what a sad
[18:26] thing that is
[18:28] verse 16 now paul kind of changes here
[18:32] and yet stays in the same vein
[18:35] that there are people who will build
[18:39] on the foundation but they don't build
[18:42] correctly because they don't live
[18:43] correctly
[18:44] so there's people who will build on the
[18:46] foundation there's those who will build
[18:48] on the foundation and
[18:49] they build incorrectly because they
[18:51] build with false doctrine
[18:52] then there's those who build on the
[18:54] foundation that build incorrectly
[18:55] because
[18:56] they don't live right and so that's who
[18:59] he's dealing with here and
[19:01] he'll be dealing with an issue with
[19:02] immorality in the corinthian church
[19:05] because that was the culture that they
[19:06] come out of and i think
[19:09] more and more as as ministers of the
[19:12] gospel today that we're going to be
[19:14] dealing with
[19:15] with issues of immorality in the church
[19:17] and issues of immorality because that's
[19:19] the culture that's out there it's an
[19:21] immoral culture and you see it creeping
[19:24] into the church on every level
[19:26] we have to deal with that we have to
[19:27] deal with the very real issues of
[19:29] immorality
[19:30] so paul deals with that and he says know
[19:33] you not that you are the temple of god
[19:35] that the spirit of god dwelleth in you
[19:39] so this is the pattern that god has set
[19:42] he wants you to live a certain way
[19:44] he says if any man defile the temple of
[19:46] god him shall god destroy
[19:49] for the temple of god is holy which
[19:51] temple you are so here's a man
[19:52] a man who builds with wood or hay or
[19:54] stubble he can be saved
[19:56] but here's a man who defiles the temple
[19:58] of god as in him shall god destroy
[20:01] for the temple of god is holy which
[20:03] temple you are
[20:06] and so he says let no man deceive
[20:08] himself
[20:09] who can deceive you the most well it'd
[20:11] be somebody close to you somebody that
[20:13] you trust
[20:14] but who can who can really deceive you
[20:16] yourself
[20:18] your own heart is more deceitful than
[20:20] anything else and so we have to
[20:21] check even our own feelings and our own
[20:24] desires by the word let no man deceive
[20:26] himself if any man among you
[20:28] seemeth to be wise in this world let him
[20:30] become a fool
[20:32] that he may be wise let him become a
[20:35] fool let him
[20:36] unlearn everything he's learned like
[20:38] moses did like paul did
[20:40] that he may be wise the wisdom of this
[20:43] world is foolishness with god
[20:46] when we went through that he said for it
[20:47] is written he taketh the wise and their
[20:49] own craftiness and this comes from job
[20:51] chapter 5
[20:52] and verse 13 which says he taketh the
[20:54] wise in their own craftiness and the
[20:56] counsel
[20:57] of the forward is carried headlong
[21:00] we taketh the wise in our own craftiness
[21:02] in other words he lets them think that
[21:04] they know what they're doing
[21:05] and they know what they're doing and
[21:07] even their own wisdom
[21:09] turns in to folly
[21:12] and they actually become greater sinners
[21:15] because
[21:16] of their wisdom than they would have
[21:17] been otherwise and i've seen that many
[21:19] times
[21:20] he taketh the wise in their own
[21:21] craftiness and
[21:23] so first corinthians 3 and 20 he says
[21:26] again the lord knoweth the thoughts of
[21:27] the wise that they are vain and this
[21:29] comes from psalms 94 11 which says the
[21:32] lord knoweth the thoughts of man
[21:34] that they are vanity so don't trust in
[21:37] your own thoughts because
[21:39] your own thoughts will lead you wrong
[21:41] trust in the word of god always follow
[21:43] the pattern
[21:46] so he says therefore because all the
[21:49] thoughts of man are vanity because
[21:52] men deceive themselves because men
[21:54] defile the temple of god
[21:56] let no man glory in men for all things
[22:00] are yours
[22:01] and this is again paul and you can see
[22:04] just the very seeds of this nicolet in
[22:06] the spirit that's going to come into the
[22:08] church
[22:08] a couple hundred years later after this
[22:11] you can see the seeds of it beginning
[22:13] in that first church because these men
[22:16] they said i'm a paul i'm a
[22:17] apollos i belong to this church i belong
[22:20] to this man
[22:21] he says let no man glory in men for all
[22:24] things are yours
[22:25] who do they belong to they belong to the
[22:26] bride they belong to the church of god
[22:29] and so he says
[22:30] all things are yours verse 22 whether
[22:33] paul
[22:34] or apollos or cephas
[22:37] or the world so paul apollos peter
[22:41] all these things are yours they're given
[22:42] for you they're they're not for the
[22:44] benefit of the men
[22:45] they're for the benefit for your benefit
[22:48] so he says
[22:49] paul apollo cephas the world life death
[22:52] things present things to come all
[22:55] are yours what a what a powerful thing
[22:59] that is
[23:00] they're all yours they belong to you
[23:02] they weren't put here for their own
[23:03] glory they weren't put here to
[23:05] so that they could have something to eat
[23:08] or something to wear or a place to live
[23:10] no
[23:10] they were put here for you and then you
[23:12] honor them and you respect them and you
[23:14] give them
[23:16] of the tithing and the different things
[23:17] that they deserve but
[23:20] but these things are for you they're not
[23:22] there for themselves they're ministers
[23:24] he says all things are yours
[23:28] brother branham deals with this and god
[23:30] providing healing for this generation
[23:32] and i love this quote he says
[23:35] he says when you become a christian walk
[23:39] around
[23:39] find out what you own what's yours
[23:42] that's what we want to do we want to
[23:43] find out what's ours that's why we study
[23:45] the scriptures
[23:46] he said all things are yours given to
[23:48] you freely
[23:50] everything that christ died for is yours
[23:53] every one of you
[23:54] you've got a checkbook with jesus name
[23:56] signed across there
[23:57] and saying whatever you send this check
[23:59] to the father
[24:01] whatever you ask the father in my name
[24:04] that i'll do so he's given you a
[24:07] checkbook with jesus name
[24:08] signed across there and all you have to
[24:10] do is fill it out
[24:12] and that's what paul is saying when he's
[24:13] saying all things are yours these things
[24:15] were given
[24:16] for you fill it out use that gift if you
[24:19] have a pastor use the gift of a pastor
[24:21] if you have
[24:22] an evangelist use the gift of an
[24:23] evangelist if you have a
[24:25] a person with a gift of healing or
[24:26] whatever that it is use those gifts
[24:28] because
[24:29] all things are yours and you are christ
[24:32] verse 23
[24:34] and christ is god's you belong to
[24:38] you belong to christ all things are
[24:40] yours but you belong to christ that
[24:42] means something
[24:44] and the greater than solomon is here
[24:45] brother branham says this and i'll close
[24:47] with this
[24:49] this closes out this third chapter which
[24:51] was such an important chapter
[24:53] in the book of first corinthians to set
[24:55] the stage for what comes later
[24:57] as paul gets stronger and stronger in
[24:59] this book
[25:01] he says i think that the pentecostal
[25:03] people as many things as god has sent
[25:05] you
[25:06] and yet our church is set half empty the
[25:09] pastor can't do it himself the laity has
[25:11] got to help in this
[25:12] remember he says all things are yours
[25:14] what does that do it gives you
[25:15] responsibility as well
[25:17] the laity has got to help in this we're
[25:19] all a partner
[25:21] he said that's what started the chaos at
[25:22] the first time at the nicea council they
[25:24] wanted
[25:25] when the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[25:26] niko means to conquer laity means to
[25:28] take away from the laity
[25:30] and make a holy man he said that's not a
[25:33] holy man holy heal
[25:35] it's a holy god a holy god amongst
[25:37] people
[25:38] the laity has part of it we are children
[25:41] there's no great ones among us
[25:43] how can you have faith when you desire
[25:44] respects one from another
[25:46] we're all one in christ jesus there's no
[25:50] big men and little men
[25:52] he says we're all the same we're
[25:53] children of one father
[25:55] were his children what did paul say
[25:57] you're christ's
[25:58] you don't belong to paul you don't
[25:59] belong to apollos you don't belong to
[26:01] peter
[26:02] you belong to christ where children of
[26:05] one father
[26:06] were his children
[26:11] that's what i want to leave you with
[26:12] today you belong to god if you belong to
[26:14] god then you can write a check for what
[26:16] you have need of and i know there's
[26:18] needs
[26:18] very real needs out there today and
[26:20] we're going to pray again
[26:22] but whatever you have need of just just
[26:24] hold that in your heart today
[26:26] i belong to god if i belong to god
[26:29] god has sent men god has sent gifts into
[26:32] the church to help me
[26:34] and i'm going to take advantage of that
[26:36] and i have a checkbook myself
[26:38] i can go in prayer to god and ask him
[26:40] for the things that i have need of
[26:41] and he'll give it to me isn't our god
[26:44] good to us
[26:45] all things are yours don't wait for some
[26:47] great man to come along
