your majesty amen there's something about the name of the Lord that brings that feeling of Awesomeness and Majesty to us amen amen we've got kids day on a Saturday uh communion on Sunday remember that and um I wanted to let you know whether JT had a test today I don't think I told Brother David this but JT had a test and they had to put him under and and do a test and now they want to do more tests so let's be praying for brother JT and the folks there in West Plains as they're getting older but age is nothing to God aren't you glad of that but Bill I think they put your test off didn't they tell next week so we're just believing for good results and I believe you'll do for you what you've done for others and the testimonies that we've had and wasn't it wonderful the testimonies that we had Sunday and I believe there's more testimonies to be had and we just have to believe amen won't always be uh sunshine and Roses so to speak but the the way uh the way that we walk sometimes is is up up mountains and through valleys but there will be those moments when we know he's still God he's still the same yesterday today and forever and he is a Healer he is a savior and I'm thankful for that tonight turn with me to Exodus chapter 6 and verse 9. so many missing tonight but I trust that they're listening or watching if they're able Exodus chapter 6 and verse 9. it says that Moses speaks so unto the children of Israel but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage I want to just take that as my thought tonight anguish of spirit as we continue to talk about the Exodus let's bow our heads together maybe you have a need you'd like to make known but we've uplifted hand tonight God sees every one of those needs my almost all of us have a need Heavenly Father Lord these needs that are represented here tonight it just would be overwhelming to a man but Lord you're you're not a man you are the almighty God we're so thankful Lord that you do not depend on on the whims of men or or the abilities of men or or even the uh Lord the the goodness of a man but Lord you are you are not bound to anything you are the all-powerful almighty God and we're so grateful for that today Lord we're so thankful that you if the doctor gives a bad report your report is still the same Lord if the world gives a bad report your report is still the same and we're grateful for that today I pray you'd meet every one of these needs I I pray for these families here tonight that you would bless them Lord for coming out to the house of God I pray you give him a double blessing Lord I pray for those that are watching Lord reach down where they're at those that are sick and those that are in need I pray you'd heal them tonight Lord Lord we'll give you the glory and the praise and the honor for what you've done not not only after you've done it but Lord right now we're worship you and praise you and thank you for doing it even before the symptoms leave we thank you for it we love you and we thank you now in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated the word anguish in in the Hebrew is is to be ineffective to be short it's to be short of spirit to be ineffective to be powerless to be impatient it means to be utterly discouraged it means to be short of spirit impatient with God and I think all of us have gotten there at some point or another in our lives especially when it comes to our families and just our regular toil of life our regular way of life they were discouraged and and there was a reason why that they were discouraged it's because that things hadn't worked out under their message the way that they thought that it would and it caused a discouragement because they they had it all planned out of what was going to happen when Moses come up there and and they found out he was still alive for one and that he was to deliver and he comes up with a message an 80 year old man as we left him last time going up there to take over going down to Egypt to take over and he had to stick in his hand and he comes up there and shows the signs and does the things that he's supposed to do and what happens the people of God are all excited and they're thinking my goodness we're gonna we're gonna be delivered immediately but they weren't delivered immediately there was a gap there was a a delay in between the time that that they heard the mess message in the time of the deliverance and I think we could type that to today that we're living in a time when there's been a delay between our hearing of the message and and the actual Deliverance of the Rapture what we would call the full deliverance we believe we've we've come through in Exodus in the sense we've come out of denominationalism we've went into the Promised word and yet there's coming an even greater fulfillment what's happened in a spiritual type what's happened in word form got to become a reality one of these days and these bodies have got to be changed aren't you glad that there's a promise of that yet many times it's a discouragement it's a discouraging thing because we think well it's just not worked out like we thought it did and more people than what we realize maybe on the edge of of wondering well is the message true or not is it even for me does it even matter anymore it's hard to live like we live it's hard to do what we do doesn't even matter and I'm here tonight to encourage you to keep pressing on don't let your spirit get anguished don't let your your patience get short with God because when your patience is short you can't hear the message like it was intended to be heard so now go back if you go back to Exodus 4 . and this is right where we left off last time in Exodus 4 27. that the Lord had spoke to Aaron this is after Moses is coming up from Egypt or from uh from the Wilderness into Egypt the Lord said to Aaron go into the Wilderness to meet Moses and he went and met him in the Mount of God and kissed him and Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him and Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the Elders of the children of Israel and Aaron stake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses and notice and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed how many Believers we got here tonight the people believed and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel that he had looked upon their Affliction then they bowed their heads and worshiped there was a time of worship because they heard the message yeah yeah and there was a message like they'd not heard before it was a message of Deliverance God said I've heard you God said I'm going to deliver you God said there's going to be a rapture and Moses proved to them that God was still alive here they they were going on they believed they were Believers maybe they believed in a yacht they believed in God uh Yahweh whatever it was that they called him by but they didn't know him they didn't really know his name as a deliverer they didn't really know his identity as a deliverer as a as the almighty God they knew him as a Helper but they didn't really know him as the God it was a God of War God who could defeat a pharaoh a God who could defeat Egypt the mightiest Empire in the world they didn't know him that way so this message came to show them that he was more than just a getting along God if we could say it like that more than just to get in by the skin of your teeth God but here was a God that was going to deliver them right that was going to make them a a bride without spotter wrinkles we could say it in modern terms that it was going to make them a people with like no other and he proved to them that God was alive by the signs the two signs that God gave him and so in Exodus 5 1 it says that if you like studying the scriptures I trust that you do we won't read every verse of this but maybe you'll have time when you go home it says afterwards Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh thus saith the Lord God of Israel let my people go if they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and Pharaoh said who is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let Israel go I know not the Lord neither will I let Israel go now that may not have been exactly the the response that they had hoped for they may have hoped for a little bit better response now if you go down to verse 6 Pharaoh instead of things getting better things begin to get worse and Pharaoh commanded the same day the task masters of the people and their officers saying you shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tale of the bricks which they didn't make heretofore the total you shall lay upon them you shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god so he says in response to them asking to go for a break I'm going to make them work harder so they don't have time to think about God so they don't have time to think of oh don't you realize that same devil is working today that same devil is trying his best to get you where you don't have time to pray you don't have time to think about God you don't have time to go to church you don't have time to serve God in any way but I'm here to tell you there's a people of God that's going to overcome that in this day so he said I don't want you to think about a Deliverance message he knows if they talked about it brother Paul if they thought about it it had a power to deliver but as long as they just stay busy he could keep them in bondage so he said he said let there be more work be laid upon the men but they may labor there and let them not regard vain words let's make it look as if that'll never happen let's make life so hard it'll look like it'll let don't you realize that old Devil's doing the same thing today let's let's make them that's all the sicknesses of demons you blood pressure and blood sugar and all these things he wants to come into you your life for the day and he wants to bring it on you and say don't you see there will never be a Rapture there will never be a Deliverance but I serve in almighty God whose word has never failed he said I'm not a man that I should lie amen I'm so glad I served God and not a man God's word never fails but he said let's make them busy so they don't regard vain words let's keep them all we're going to preach a little bit tonight let's keep them so busy that they don't have time to look at the promises of God oh my verse 12 he says so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt together stubble instead of straw they couldn't even stay where God put them because the work had gotten harder so they had to go all over the land and they got split up that's what the devil's trying to do as well and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfill your Works your daily tasks as when there was straw we'll see what they'll do with no Revival in the land we'll see what they'll do when they witness and nobody nobody he wants to hear it we'll see what they do and over and over again they come to church and it seems like the same old same old thing and it seems like they begin to get discouraged let's see what they do oh God that's where you'd be where the rubber meets the road that's when you begin to see those that are really faithful now look he said fulfill your daily task that's when they were strong they went to see Pharaoh they complained about it they said look you it's your fault it's your people's fault because they won't give a straw to make bricks verse 17 but he said you're idle you're idle therefore you say let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall you deliver the tale of bricks the officers left that meeting kind of disheartened with the politics of the day probably look like some of y'all if you get done watching Fox News or get on your phone and listen to all the stuff that's going on or looking at it you get kind of discouraged when you go back from that meeting think there's never going to be there's not any hope this inflation is going to go through the room we're just gonna have to work harder and I'm never going to get to retire have you ever felt like that those are real thanks maybe on this spiritual sense you you begin to question me and think well all that's happened since I come in the message of the hour things have gotten worse things have gotten say well we didn't expect the world to get better did we didn't the prophets say it would get worse and worse until the end but the brides are going down the bride's going up so it depends on whether we're looking at the problem or we're looking at the promise so now they they come back and they told Moses they met him on the way Moses is going back up to pharaoh and here they come back and and they said all you've done is increase our burden Moses verse 22 returned unto the Lord and said Lord wherefore has so so evil entreated this people why is it that thou Hast sent me now think about this for a moment God's Prophet now don't think it's just you tonight you would get mixed up and we wonder what am I called to do what am I supposed to do am I even a believer is this message even right you say well I've never thought like that well praise God everybody's sitting around your house that's just the truth you may not have dwelt on it but at some point in your life those thoughts begin to come say well I wonder what's the point why be faithful when you can be unfaithful and be just as popular Why Live the way we do when you can be when you can live like others and I've heard it said well there's people who don't go to church at all and they're blessed there's people who don't who don't believe the message anymore and it seems like they're more blessed than they ever were but see God to many times God lets that go but there's coming a judgment day there's coming a Payday but there's also coming a Payday for the Bride of Jesus Christ there's coming a reward but we can't see that many times we look at what's going on and so he said Moses God's prophet begin to question why have you sent me I've come with the sign in the hand and I had to sign the other sign that you've given me as our Prophet was given the sign in the hand and then and then know the secrets of the heart and he said he said for since I came to pharaoh to speak in my name he has done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all things just got worse you realize the prophet of God got in the same situation now some of you know the message you know what I'm talking about he began to question brother Allen whether his whether his calling what was whether it was over whether he was about to die whether he was washed up he even said well maybe I'm will they in the groundwork for somebody else to come and not knowing god was about to do the greatest thing he could do by moving his ministry into the third pole but he knew something was happening something was going to come but he goes to God in kind of this questioning manner what am I doing every time he said every time I cross the nation he said it gets worse I preach it and it gets worse oh but I'm so glad there's a people today that have responded to the word of God preached by a prophet Moses even began to question and brother Branham did that he in in gifts in 1956 he said I've been a little nervous he said because I've been since I've been up here I haven't been able to carry my texts and so forth and to minister like I should he said I've started something my meetings has always been a loaded for a long time he said I've seen it he talked about his mail dropping from 1500 letters a day to 15. the big draw he said because he just wasn't home he's too nervous he'd go out in the woods and and run around and they couldn't get a hold of him so they just quit writing he said now he met me again in 1957 Jehovah Jireh said he met me some time ago several months ago and they're fixing to be a change in my Ministry he said it's a change for the better well of course when the people heard a change for the better they thought like we all did you know and well they're going to be more crowds it's going to be bigger stadiums there's going to be more people there's going to be more miraculous miracles which would be hard to do but you know the people after seeing what God did in brother Brandon's Ministry I thought wow this this next Ministry must be something great right but brother Branham didn't know what it was he said I keep feeling there's a change coming a change coming he said when we spoke of it but now he said he was talking to somebody about it he said he said it won't be a change in my Ministry because it can't be no more you understand he talks about how once God gives you a gift you always have it God don't take it away he said but it'll be a change in me amen now again brother by Adam he's inviting folks even to come and see he's telling them he said it's real close in 1959 he said it was so close I thought it was going to happen yesterday he said I believe it'll be right away now it'll be far beyond anything we've ever seen or heard he said now you remember that saith the Lord and we're just expecting it anytime oh my yeah you ever been like that you're not sure what God's doing but you know something's coming something's coming well I'll tell you what's coming the rapture's coming many times the things you know brother random didn't know and you may disagree with me here you have a right too if you want to that's fine you can disagree with me and maybe you're right but but this is what I what I see in the message is that brother Branham didn't know until after it happened that the change had even happened that it was in such a a way that he didn't even realize you can go and look at it he's still looking for that change and then he goes back he turns around and says that was it so it was after he after it happened then he recognized oh that was it sometimes we can't see what God's doing right now we looked for him over Yonder somewhere we looked for him back there somewhere and we can't see him in the middle what he's doing right this moment and so a prophet Being Human was was no different than we are in that way now brother Brandon said so far as I know every Vision he's ever given me has been fulfilled except the one that I'm a change in my Ministry where I'm to pray for people in a little place like a little room under a tent or a big Auditorium or something looked to me he said like a tent he said you remember that through two three years ago most all of it was brought to pass he talks about Mexico he talks about the vision of little fish but he knew there was something more than just the meeting in Mexico but he didn't know what it was yeah it's amazing that people other people knew that he didn't know right but now he said it made him nervous it made him anxious listen we're living in a time like that now I hope you I hope I can get this to you the way it is in my mind in my heart because we're living in that kind of a time when we're not real sure what the next step is and we see people over here saying well this is the bride's Revival and over here this is surprise Revival this is what we should be doing this is who we should be following and we realize that God has already been doing something amen one of these days You're Gonna wake up just walking in the door and you'll realize what God's been doing all the time and it'll be a day just like any other day it'll be a day just like Monday just like Tuesday just like Saturday whatever day that it is it'll be just like any other day and you'll be like you know you'll walk home with God and you begin to see your low aren't you looking forward to it but don't you realize you won't maybe notice the change but it happened you didn't notice that you were getting more sincere you didn't notice you were getting more desperate you didn't notice that things were changing but they were yeah Hallelujah don't lose hope don't get anxious don't get short with God during that time brother Brown thought he was going to die so did you ever think he was at the end of the road let's just be real Church said about eight months ago when I saw a vision at home and you know about it sirs what time is it I've seen that heard that blast go off in the vision seen seven angels come grab me I told you all this is probably the end of the road went to my wife and I said honey this may be my end I don't know he said how many has ever heard the tape well sure you know I said this saith the Lord something is fixing to happen I know not you know what it was he said something is fixing to happen he said and then I went to her and I said sweetheart I'll tell you what I want you to do now if this is my end God has showed a vision now listen he said he don't always tell you what it is he never told the prophets of the Old Testament or new testament what it was many times unless he wanted them to know they just wrote down see he said it wasn't none of their business oh my oh if we learned that we'd be a whole lot better off we'll be a whole lot less mad at God if we learn many times as what he's doing what he's working in the background what he's doing supernaturally many times he don't let us know listen when job begin to get in the position that he was him and everything come against him and job cried after God he said God if you just tell me why if you just tell me why then I would I would come and I would reason with you I'd sit down with you he said if you just tell me why God never did tell him why but what did he do he said I'm going to show you a redeemer and job got to the place where he said I know my redeemer lives and in the last days I was amen though the skin worms destroying my body yet in my flesh I shall see God he showed him a vision of redemption he never told him why he went through what he went through he may never tell you why the struggle he may never tell you why you've been through hell and back and why you went through the things you did Buddy he says you have a redeemer you have a redeemer and get a vision of your Redemption get a vision of the bleeding word he said it wasn't none of their business it's God doing something that's a whole lot different view of prophets than what we have sometimes isn't it yes after the opening of the seals he told him what it was you didn't tell me what it was while during the openings he tells him afterwards and yet you can find brother Brandon preaching it even during the seals but later he identifies it what it is he says remember the third poll was was the opening of them Seven Seals now when brother Brandon says the third poll he's talking about the change of his ministry it's the third pull of brother Banner's Ministry literally casting a fishing pole out in the water and you pull right he's setting the hook for the third time right first time he did it got a little bitty fish second time a little bit bigger fish but he's got his line all tangled up because he tried to explain him but he said you you can't do that you can't teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural things trying to trying to thread a half inch cord through a little baby shoe you remember the vision and so he and so he said this time he said he'll be it'll it'll be so humble that they won't even see it and they didn't the Pentecostal babies still don't see it right right but now what watch what happened he he said now now that it's happened he said the third pole was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he looked back at it and you know with the benefit of hindsight you say why was he so anxious why was he so nervous why did God let him stew like that but he was testing his Prophet just like he tests you and I to see whether we'll hold strong to see whether we'll stay with the word I'm so glad brother Brown to stay with the word but he's not the only one that's got to stay with the word you've got to stay with the word and I've got to stay with the word God gave Moses two signs like he gave brother Branham he told that's what the angel come brother around he said I've given you two signs like I gave Moses Moses showed those signs all the people were excited now they didn't believe no more because of Anguish of spirit and then verse 1 of chapter six I want you to watch this then the Lord said unto Moses now shalt thou see what I will do to pharaoh Hallelujah for with a strong hand shall he let them go with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord now watch real closely he said I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them now so he said I manifested myself to them as God Almighty El Shaddai but not as Yahweh Jehovah see because they had not recognized him though they knew that his name was Yahweh but he had not manifested himself in that way as a deliverer as a mighty God of War and and all those things that they needed and so you see kind of the the lamb and the lion as well that here he had not shown himself yet as a lion and yet the lion is at work judgments coming on this world there's coming a day oh church we could just see what's going on behind the scenes right but when we look we see a lamb so now and remember the the first uh the very first of this of the Mysteries that begin to be unfolded was who got what God's name was how to baptize the very first Hallelujah very first mystery that was unfolded and it's the first thing he shows the children of Israel now he's and the Bible says whatever you do in word or D do all in the name of the Lord Jesus so that's that's what we worship under and now what was he going to do for them once they had the revelation of who he was now he tells them and if you're writing it down or if you want to keep it if you can remember it God bless you because I probably couldn't but there are three I haves in these next few verses three I have watched from he said and I have also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of the pilgrimage wherein they were strangers he said you're not waiting on that yeah Hallelujah I have right he said I have also heard the groanings of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage they weren't delivered yet but he said I have heard amen and then he says again I have remembered my Covenant I have established my Covenant I have heard their groanings and I have remembered my Covenant so the time is right now then he begins to say seven things that he says I will I will so there's three I haves and then seven I Wills I love the way God's word works and all fits together he said wherefore sand of the children of Israel I am the Lord is the first one I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will read you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments listen to this I will take you to be for a people when they were discouraged when they were down when they were despaired but here he says I will if they could have only seen the promises and not the problem he said I will be free to you for a god I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a god you shall know that I am the Lord your God which brings you out under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will bring into you I will bring you into the land concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give you for inheritage I am the Lord these were their positive promises now look he showed the signs and he comes from the Joel with the word and he begins to preach to them I will I will I will but all they can see is pharaoh all they can see is making bricks without straw huh we gotta look up Church we got to look past our problems we've got to look past our circumstances once in a while you need to stay with the word you need saying what the word means more than just not being deceived it means to stay fervent about the word to remain in the word to keep feeding on the Promises of God you need to see he said I will bless you I will put you in a rapture I will do these things I will heal you I will save your children I will we have a positive message listen the Bible says all the promises of God someone say all all the promises of God in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of God by us they're all positive not a negative one in them why because they're in him to us Hallelujah no negativity of all at all what did he say he said I have elected you I have called you I have heard your cry Hallelujah the enemy begins I will she said I will deliver you because the seed is not air with the shuck you see where I'm going now I'll read you out of the bondage of those broken sisters I redeem You by an invisible Union I will take you to me in the choosing of a bride future home oh my it makes me want to run all over the place tonight I will take you to your future home I will give you things that are to be but if we're not careful we can't see the I Wills because always dwelling on well things aren't like they used to be people aren't like they used to be well boy brother if you could have lived in my day I'm glad things aren't like they used to be because I'm another day closer to the Rapture I'm another year closer to the Rapture I'm living in a time of I will it's good can you see that I I don't think I'm stepping outside the word at all and saying that now these are positive promises to us oh it says in Moses steak so in other words God told it told him what to say and Moses said it I love that Moses was a man but he said what God Said Hallelujah oh they had to have confidence in that they could have confidence in the fact though he was a man yet he said what God said when he said what God Said if they just believe it it would change their circumstance because it's much easier to make bricks without straw if you know there's Deliverance coming it's much easier to adopt to live in pharaohs Egypt to live in Satan's Eden it's much easier if you've heard the seven I Wills if you if you've forgotten into the word of God if you believe the word if you if you've if you've listened to the taste you you've heard of prophet's voice and you know you say I know what he said life may be hard right now but I know God sent a prophet to tell me I will huh it doesn't mean anything to us I know it's Wednesday these things just struck my heart I believe God I don't believe God does that for me just for me I believe he does that for all of us they were literally too stressed to be blessed you've heard they're saying I'm too blessed to be stressed the children of Israel were in Egypt were too stressed to be blessed I wonder how many times we've come to church on a Wednesday night to stressed to be blessed and we got nothing out of the service because we're thinking about this and thinking about that and thinking about this person and thinking about how this went and thinking about that if you could just lift yourself above the mud lift yourself above the bricks look at well why did Moses why was he able to forsake the The Treasure of Egypt for for our people that were a bunch of mud daubers because he looked beyond that he looked to a God who said I will amen I will give you a future home I will heal you I will I will touch you all these things that he's promised us the Bible says Moses when he speaks on the children of Israel they hearkened not didn't say they didn't hear him they heard him but they just couldn't believe it because of anguish spirit and cruel bondage if your spirit is short you can't believe the promise of your day the message itself becomes ineffective to you because your spirit is short see he said my brother Ben I've gotten impatient in my spirit I've gotten to where I don't have the thirst and the longing that I used to to hear the word and and to get into the things of God and I just don't know where I stand right now I'm in this condition I see myself in my family I see us in this condition of of Anguish of spirit but how do you fix that by turning your eyes away from the cruel bondage looking at the promise and patiently waiting on the Lord Isaiah 40 and 27 Isaiah says this why say sorrow Jacob and speak as though Israel my way is hid from the Lord my judgment is passed over from my God this judgment is not in a negative sense God should have Avenged my enemies God should have made things right and they said it's not happened my judgment is passed over my way is hid God don't see me have you ever felt like that the children of Israel felt like that he said hast thou not known hast thou not heard sometimes we just need to be reminded don't we that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth Hallelujah faith is not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding did you ever think about it there's many places on the ocean floor that no man has ever been the other day some people died trying to go down to view the wreckage of the Titanic but before the Titanic was ever there there was somebody there God was there he's a God that knows the ends of the Earth he created the ends of the Earth the very deepest places of the earth not only that but the very highest places of the Stars places we've never even dreamed about yet God's already been there and not only that he's already been he's already seen our down sittings and her uprisings he's already been through he's already seen the sickness that we would have and how we would overcome him he's already seen our children go out and do whatever they've done but he also saw how they would come back he's already been there just because a man's not been there remember he said have you not seen have you not heard this is God we're talking about [Music] the creator of the ends of your fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faith oh I'm so glad for that tonight to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint towards the end of his life brother Branham kept telling the people wait on the Lord wait on the Lord be patient God's doing something he says this he said patience patience some of us I'm just going to turn around preach it myself some of us get so in such a hurry and God help us he said I think of many a good man has done that you get in too much of a hurry you want to see you want to do it yourself he said and Minister Brethren Minister brethren God help us tonight Minister Brethren he said you know from when I'm talking you that's listening to this tape he said I'm talking to you that's pretty direct isn't it he said I'm talking to you not only to the little congregation here but men around the world many men go out impatient right many men go out impatient but believing that the time is near you try to do something within yourself he said wait upon the Lord patience is virtue if you can have patience it's virtue it's virtue they that weighed upon the Lord shall renew their strength he said not they that try to get ahead of the Lord they that try to tell the Lord Lord I know you want me to do this glory to God don't do that wait upon the Lord the Bible said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength huh brother Brown's talking about now you just applied to your own life he's talking about the ministry he's talking about how a ministers on how many times did we see it over the years we're now looking back at many of much of this we look back and we see a man got in a hurry started preaching the Thunders for the virtues all right good men but they got impatient men got in a hurry and decided brother Branham had to come back literally in a tent because the Revelation has broken to him yet of what it was what actually happened and brother Brandon said it but they just couldn't see it good men God impatient but he's telling them he said patience patience wait listen he said I understood that in France this morning there's better than 2 000 Frenchmen on a several day fast that will come to bring the message to France he said in France the whole Protestant Nation Protestant part of the nation of France he said it just began blooming now I like this it's just begin blooming now I just I don't want to make this personal but this means so much to me he said just begin the Shucks I wasn't even born yet but look it was beginning to bloom something's been going on something's been going on God's been doing something while they were in anguish of spirit while they were worried about the outcome while they couldn't even hear the message oh God so many of them passed it over couldn't even hear the opening of the word could not hear the seven Thunders being uttered and the voices being could not hear God speaking to us you know what I'm talking about I look they just couldn't see it but how many times we get in the same place anguish of spirit short of spirit impatient well it's time for something to happen something is happening and you're a part of it Hallelujah something was going on God was fixing to judge Egypt fix to give him 10 plagues something was happening the wheels were already turning they just couldn't see it and brother Brandon says remember just began blooming now so just keep reverent he said keep praying see remember they that wait upon the Lord renew their strength he said now I was getting pretty old and I thought well will there be another Revival I'll see another time he said Just remember from the West Oh Come a white horse rider brother speaks about this white horse rider I don't have time to go into it but it's from a dream that someone had actually several dreams that were had they saw a white horse rider and one it was he was an Indian Chief and another he was a captain of the Cowboys and and they saw him writing and and he went off towards the west and and and and then come back from the west and he talked about that he said we'll he now in most places he talks about he said I'll ride this Trail again but in this place he says wheel ride this Trail again we'll ride this Trail again I don't get don't get nervous I'm not preaching no strange Doctrine just hang with me a minute have some faith he said we'll ride this Trail again that's right as soon as we get ready huh it's a promise you see oh my I've told you before God interprets his word by bringing it to pass how did we know that brother Brandon's Ministry was over God took him home right his per his personal Ministry on the Earth was over because God said it was I didn't have anything to do with that you didn't have anything to do with that that's that was the end of his of him making tapes right that was the end of the revealing of the Mysteries that's how God revealed it he interpreted his word amen now watch it this word if you look at it it was not a prophet that went riding I don't know went riding from the west and went around the world again what was it this message it was his message that went out he said we'll ride this Trail again we'll ride this oh my it was the message that went out this message did not stop when the prophet died but the word has been writing around the world for more than 50 years and I got to thinking about this brother Joe because we were in Egypt last year about a year ago preaching to doing something that rarely gets done anymore because most people in the world have been reached by the message now and it's been greatly sped up by the Advent of the internet but most people at least maybe they haven't heard but they've had access to here it's in their language right and somehow God will find that last predestined seed I I don't believe the last one's been found because if it had been found we'd be going home we'd be home right but now it's been going on for 50 years and when we were in Egypt I got thinking about that we were having an opportunity to preach the brand new like a brand new field it was wide open and the people were handing out books and giving them to people that had no access to it no access to the internet no access to in in their language translating the books and giving in their language and as we begin to do that I begin to think about this if brother Branham came back physically where would he go the message already went to France it already went to Africa what he was planning to do was to take this message that we have here which he said we now have by by Divine Vindication of perfect Revelation you know what I'm talking about the quote I'm talking about why why what would he do think about it you do the same thing that's been done you take it to the world oh God and we didn't even know it we've been part of that this little church has been part of that over the years taking the message overseas we've been poor we haven't just left it just to ourselves but we've been part of that you're part of that now you're taking the message to pick it you're taking the message to uh you're taking the message to Hardy you're taking the message to Cherokee Village you're taking the message to Thayer you're taking the message to Bono what is it what's God doing just by your everyday life thousands of lived voices are spreading this message infant bride grew up I Don't Preach like this very often but you just hang with me I'm almost done look brother Brian said I'm very thankful for these open doors I've had to go into the inspiration it's give to young men like your pastor here let's cause them as I'm beginning to get old know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation men like brother biscoll took that and said that's me right men like a young Tim Pruitt took that said that's me right men like that that's me a young Donnie Reagan said that's me right those men are I'm gonna get in trouble but those men are almost old now I qualified it's all right it's a memorial some of them I've even ceased the minister many have gone on brother Perry green many of those people that spread this message all over the world but they're we're still here somebody's got to keep writing somebody's got to keep preaching somebody's got to keep living it because these young men have got to sweep it on to the coming of the Lord see brother Brandon kept telling the people he said nothing's how to cater he kept warning on that and in 1965 it's very interesting if you go to listen to The Rapture message and then things that are to be and modern events made clear by prophecy that's three nights in a row brother Brandon preaches preaches the Rapture things that are to be modern events are made clear by prophecy December 4th December 5th December 6th and I can't find where he said this before but he starts saying it those three nights he said if God is infinite Almighty all-powerful I'm not president omniscient why he knew all things from the beginning so he knowed there's nothing out of cater it's just us that thinks it is again the next night things that are to be you are our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite God he knowed all things somebody believes he knows all things tonight he said therefore there's someone say nothing nothing out of cater it's two again the next night by the mouth of two or three Witnesses of everything be established he said we think we're all out of cater but we're not everything's moving just exactly with God's word everything's moving just exactly less than three weeks later brother Branham was dead God's trying to tell us something Church there was nothing out of cater but there was a blooming going on an infant bride and one day she got big enough she started carrying it started taking it with her amen and they've carried it now for many many years and we're carrying it tonight we haven't quit we're not going to quit someone say Amen tonight we're not going to quit in face of opposition we're not going to quit because of some some website we're not going to quit I'm not gonna quit carrying this message why because this message is who I am this message is more than a Prophet this message is more than just a man it's more than a headquarters somewhere but this message is the word of God revealed Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's the I will what I will do to you I will give you a Rapture but the bill I will give you a new body I will give you healing I will give you salvation I will have a church like that first church there will be a bride without spotter Eagle I will I will I will we think everything's out of cater but nothing's out of gator Hallelujah all the time that the children of God were in anguish of spirit because of the conditions of The Exodus the wheels of Deliverance were already in motion judgment was coming on pharaoh the message had come they were going home yeah oh God Church their shortness of spirit did not change what God was doing they're anguished and their sadness and their worry and their did not change I'm so glad he's not dependent on me but I'm dependent on him he's doing it and he's doing it he's not just doing it but he's doing it through me and he's doing it through you yeah he's not just doing it but he's doing it through us in spite of our shortness of spirit the children of Israel did not know they did not realize they were going home that it did not change the word of God unbelief does not hinder God did not change it but how much better off would we be if we would just believe it it's good yes sir amen let's buy our heads together we're going home musicians wouldn't come we're going home I have to say Lord in spite of my shortness spirit in spite of my worry oh God fussing and fighting and carrying on but we're still going home in spite of the weakness of Flesh no matter how many ways they pick apart the message no matter how many ways they try to pick apart the God he still said I will I will he repeated what God Said I will Hallelujah and what can I do but believe it what can I do it may seem like it'll never happen it may seem like it's so far-fetched you raising young kids I know it's hard to look forward to a Rapture when you're facing you're raising little bitty children you're just trying to get them through the day you're just just trying to make it through the week it's it's hard to look forward I think sometimes for you Elders it's hard to look forward because you just get caught up in today I hurt today it's hard today I I can't remember like I used to I I can't do like I used to I wish I could I see the young ones and I think oh God have I just been left behind [Music] but there's a body change coming there's a reality of the word of God for you you get caught up in what the insurance man's doing and what the uh what what the uh what what the Realtors do and what the what the pastors do and what the church is doing what other churches are doing but if we could only get back to the word and we'd hear a prophet of God speaking said I will give you a future home I will deliver you I'm Gonna Make You the head and not the tail I'm gonna I'm gonna give you the blessings of God I will restore saith the Lord what did he say I will he has never left us has he hasn't he hasn't he been good to us he been good to us over and over again when every time we thought we'd Fallen apart every time we thought it got too bad and people didn't care no more and the church was about to close God provided something better for us every time we thought our family was over every time we thought God did something for us I said God help us tonight God help me help me not to be caught up in the in the grouchiness and the anxiety and the fear of the day God forgive me let me walk forward let me believe when you said I will let me walk into that promise of healing of Deliverance oh granted God Heavenly Father oh Lord Jesus Lord how I how I want to get it across to the people like you gave it to me but Lord I'm so thankful for it may that same Spirit Lord just drop into the hearts of the people tonight Lord not a new revelation but just just emphasizing maybe and taking a little bit different look at what a prophet said oh God you had your Prophet you made a mouthpiece out of a prophet and said I will I will I will oh God we're living in the age of the promises living in the land of the promises where all the promises lay we're so grateful for that tonight Lord help us not to be so caught up in work not to be so caught up in everyday life not to be so caught up in sickness not to know those things are needful and and Lord we have to take care of ourselves but Lord most of all let us see your word let us see the Promise God I will says the Lord I will take care of you I will deliver you oh God I pray for these young families Lord I I think Lord the devil's working on them harder than anybody trying to keep them out of the house of God trying to make it where it's not important anymore trying to make it where their prayer life's not important where home life is unimportant and they can just live any way they want to and my my family as well Lord it just seems like the devil just pressure every day pressure on the teenagers pressure on the parents pressure on the little children but oh God that we've given there's a way to let off the pressure to run into the City of Refuge and we know that is your word let us go to the Lord let us see let us tell our children we're not going to be here for long let's put our shoes on our feet and our staff in our hand and get ready put the token on display we're going home in a time of shortness of spirit of impatience with God let us be ready oh God let us be ready for your rapture Lord as it completes in us we pray we thank you for it now in Jesus name hallelujah hallelujah oh would you just worship him
