[24:41] always feels good to come back one of my
[24:43] favorite churches to come to one of my
[24:45] favorite churches to fellowship with
[24:47] worship with and I just like to say how
[24:50] about that message this morning how was
[24:53] that that was that was wonderful and I'm
[24:56] not a I'm not quite a preacher like that
[24:58] not quite a brother Joel but hopefully
[25:01] we can put some quotes together some
[25:03] scripture together and it can be a an
[25:05] encouragement to somebody a blessing to
[25:07] somebody and Joel he only gave me about
[25:11] 15 minutes up here this evening so I'm
[25:12] going to try and get right in the
[25:13] scripture he he said about 10 15 minutes
[25:16] don't go over so I'm going to try and
[25:18] I'm going to try and abide by that but
[25:19] if we could let's just turn to Psalm 103
[25:33] I think we'll read down to verse 5 Psalm
[25:36] 103 let's go to verse
[25:41] five reads bless the Lord oh my soul and
[25:45] all that is within me bless His holy
[25:47] name bless the Lord oh my soul and
[25:51] forget not all his benefits who
[25:54] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[25:56] Health all thy diseas dises who
[25:59] redeemeth thy life from destruction who
[26:02] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[26:04] Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth
[26:08] with good things so that thy youth is
[26:10] renewed like the eagles and let's turn
[26:12] to one more scripture here first
[26:14] Corinthians the 2 chapter verse
[26:22] 12 1 Corinthians 2 verse2
[26:30] it says now we have received not the
[26:34] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[26:37] is of god that we might know the things
[26:41] that are freely given to us of God Amen
[26:45] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[26:46] Lord Jesus we just thank you for another
[26:48] opportunity Lord we just ask that you
[26:50] would bless this service Lord that your
[26:51] spirit would that you would move amongst
[26:53] us Lord that you would Lord before I
[26:56] would say anything unpleasing you that
[26:57] you would stop me father and Lord we
[27:00] just thank you for the service this
[27:01] morning the anointing that came down
[27:03] lord how your spirit was in this place
[27:05] and father we just ask that you do the
[27:07] same here tonight Lord there's quite a
[27:09] few more than two or three gathered in
[27:11] your name here and father we trust that
[27:13] you'll be in the midst in Jesus Christ's
[27:15] holy name amen amen you may be
[27:18] seated so looking at these scriptures
[27:20] they it was speaking of you know forget
[27:23] not all your benefits as a Believer
[27:27] don't forget about them don't don't ever
[27:28] let them be cast out of your mind hinge
[27:30] on those think about those things
[27:32] consider them in your mind and and then
[27:34] it brought to my mind how the enemy he
[27:36] spends so much time telling us what we
[27:38] can't have he spends so much time
[27:41] telling us what we can't do what you're
[27:43] not capable of he spends so much time
[27:46] doing these things and it reminded me of
[27:47] pharaoh talking to Moses you know he
[27:49] wanted to Pharaoh after a few plagues he
[27:51] wanted to start bargaining with Moses a
[27:53] little bit he want to say well you can
[27:55] have this all right you can have this
[27:58] over here but I'm going to keep this and
[28:00] that's the way the enemy will do in our
[28:01] lives he'll say well you can have this
[28:03] healing over here you can have this
[28:04] thing you prayed for like he has any any
[28:06] deciding factor in that he doesn't but
[28:09] he says you can have this over here but
[28:11] I'm going to keep a hold of this and he
[28:13] tries to bargain with the believer and
[28:15] he tries to say well it's a it's not a
[28:17] give and take it's a it's we have
[28:19] benefits in this day it's in the word we
[28:21] don't have to bargain With the Enemy
[28:23] today we don't have to go back and forth
[28:25] with them we don't we don't have to
[28:27] accept some halfway Deliverance in this
[28:30] hour that's something that we do not
[28:32] have to accept and and I think Pharaoh
[28:34] he didn't quite realize that he didn't
[28:36] have any any legal rights left I don't
[28:39] think the thought had crossed his mind
[28:40] that it wasn't his to give back it
[28:42] wasn't his to give away they didn't need
[28:45] his permission anymore because God had
[28:47] spoken God had laid it down the prophet
[28:51] says in a quote here in the Oneness of
[28:52] unity he says I now challenge the devil
[28:55] to a debate come on now he said Satan
[28:58] you are aware that you are whipped he
[29:01] said you have no legal rights yes sir
[29:04] said Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you
[29:07] of every Authority you had when he died
[29:10] at Calvary to take away sin and sickness
[29:14] he said and you're nothing but a bluff
[29:17] and we're calling your bluff Moses
[29:19] called his bluff Moses said it is all
[29:22] ours he said I'm not leaving one hoof
[29:24] behind I'm taking it all with me Moses
[29:27] called him on that bluff and that's what
[29:29] we have to do now that was the benefits
[29:31] of being a believer in that hour and we
[29:34] say but what's the benefits of being a
[29:35] believer in this hour and there's a few
[29:37] scriptures I'd like to point to there's
[29:39] one we don't have to turn to them but
[29:40] just go through them quickly here Luke
[29:43] 10: 19 it's when the when those 70 are
[29:46] returning to him and he looks at him and
[29:48] he says behold I give un you power to
[29:50] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[29:53] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[29:55] shall by any means hurt you we go to to
[29:58] another one Isaiah 53: 4 and 5 he says
[30:02] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[30:05] carried our sorrows those are benefits
[30:08] of being a
[30:10] Believer he says yet we did esteem him
[30:13] stricken smitten of God and Afflicted
[30:16] but he was wounded for our
[30:18] transgressions he was bruised for our
[30:20] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[30:23] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[30:26] healed these are benefits of the
[30:29] believer we go to another one Ephesians
[30:32] 6 chap or yeah Ephesians 6: 10 and 11
[30:36] it's talking about the arm of God it
[30:37] says finally my brethren sir be strong
[30:40] in the Lord and in the power of His
[30:44] might and that that didn't say be strong
[30:46] in the power of your own might but it
[30:49] said be strong in the power of His might
[30:52] those benefits they're not going to
[30:53] operate correctly if we try and be
[30:55] strong in the power of our own might now
[30:57] we can we can push and pull and we can
[30:59] try really hard but we have to as
[31:01] brother Joel he wonderful message this
[31:03] morning we have to let the spirit of God
[31:06] work through us it's not a it's not a
[31:08] fleshly matter we can't just come at it
[31:10] with our flesh and our own strength cu
[31:12] the devil will beat you 10 times out of
[31:13] 10 he has you conquered in that way but
[31:17] through the spirit of
[31:18] God he does not have you conquered and
[31:21] he never will right and there's a prayer
[31:25] that brother Brenham prayed it's it's
[31:26] kind of my inspiration for this message
[31:28] he says and we come to accept this
[31:30] morning what you have provided for us in
[31:33] your vicarious suffering and the
[31:35] atonement at your Deb that you have made
[31:38] for us he says and we freely Lord Jesus
[31:41] receive it we believe the word of God we
[31:45] believe that you promised he that will
[31:48] come to me I will in no wise cast out oh
[31:52] God what a promise no matter what it's
[31:54] for thou H has said when you pray
[31:56] believe that you receive what you ask
[31:59] for you shall receive it he goes on he
[32:02] says now father if we truly believe it
[32:06] and it's settled we believe it it is
[32:08] done then we act upon our confession
[32:10] that you have did it for us not that we
[32:13] are worthy we are unworthy but through
[32:17] your unmar grace that we have through
[32:20] thee we believe that the work is
[32:22] finished and as these penitent ones and
[32:25] the ones who are coming this morning
[32:27] consecrated themselves and to those who
[32:29] are coming for the benefits of the
[32:32] suffering for the benefits of the
[32:34] suffering as David said bless the Lord
[32:36] oh my soul and forget not all his
[32:38] benefits who forgiveth all of my
[32:41] iniquity my backsliding and who Health
[32:43] all of our diseases that's the benefits
[32:47] of the believer and if I were to title
[32:50] this this morning it would be the
[32:51] benefits of the believer's policy the
[32:54] benefits of the believer's policy and it
[32:55] goes on it says and we receive it
[32:57] through Faith this morning by coming
[33:00] upon the word of God yes which was
[33:02] spoken before the foundation of the
[33:04] world now these these benefits and maybe
[33:07] what First Corinthians was talking there
[33:09] these are the best kind of benefits
[33:11] they're the freely given ones everybody
[33:14] loves some free
[33:15] benefits I've heard brother George say
[33:17] before you know a cheeseburger is nice
[33:19] but a free cheeseburger tastes even
[33:22] better free things are really nice we
[33:24] like to receive these things you know if
[33:26] I'm a if brother Joel a company and if
[33:28] I'm a a worker for that company one of
[33:31] the first few questions I'm going to ask
[33:32] him is what are my free benefits you
[33:35] know we're going to talk about the pay
[33:37] we're going to talk about other things
[33:38] then I'm going to say well what benefits
[33:39] come freely to me what do I receive from
[33:42] you and he might tell me about a a
[33:44] retirement plan he has he might tell me
[33:45] about the different insurances he has he
[33:48] might tell me about these things that
[33:49] that his company offers me being a
[33:51] worker for them but if I don't take the
[33:54] next step and enroll myself in it and
[33:57] claim these benefits that are being
[33:59] freely given to me they're not going to
[34:01] do me any good right they may be offered
[34:05] they may be there for the taking they
[34:07] may be free but if I don't enroll in
[34:09] these and claim them for myself and make
[34:12] them personal to me what good are they
[34:15] going to do me but if I come to a
[34:17] realization if I that's a big part of it
[34:20] if I realize I'm a worker for that
[34:21] company I realize he's my boss and I
[34:24] realize all these
[34:25] things I need to learn to to accept
[34:28] these
[34:29] things just how we need to learn to
[34:31] accept the blood of Christ in our life
[34:32] These benefits into our life sometimes
[34:35] there's there's such our our minds can
[34:37] get so clouded some sometimes we have so
[34:39] many different things to look at in this
[34:41] day and we can look here and look here
[34:43] and look here and we're not recognizing
[34:45] the benefits of a believer in this day
[34:49] there's so many distractions and this is
[34:50] one of my favorite quotes i' I'd like to
[34:52] put it in every sermon I preach because
[34:54] I think the believer needs to believe
[34:56] this right here he says if you realize
[34:59] now that's a big part we must come to
[35:01] that realization if you realize that
[35:03] you're a son and daughter of God and the
[35:06] deposits made in Calvary now there's not
[35:08] any LIE there's not anything the devil
[35:10] can tell you about yourself that will
[35:13] take that deposit out of Calvary that
[35:15] deposits been put there and he can't
[35:18] move that deposit he can't touch that
[35:19] money he can't touch those benefits that
[35:22] are given to us they're there and
[35:24] they're there to stay it goes on it says
[35:26] and you've got a check book in your hand
[35:28] write anything you want to on there
[35:31] God's promised to take care of it that's
[35:32] a check Saints it's not going to bounce
[35:35] that's a check when you write your name
[35:36] on it it's good sir it's good every time
[35:39] there's funds in that account there's
[35:42] blessings in that account there's
[35:43] Redemptive blessings in that account for
[35:45] us to have in this day but we got to
[35:48] realize that he goes on he says it's in
[35:51] the bank it was deposited at Calvary
[35:54] your salvation the baptism of the Holy
[35:57] Spirit your worries and things gone says
[36:01] they're there he says and every one of
[36:03] you can be perfectly made well CU your
[36:05] Redemption is already redeemed before
[36:08] God and he's sitting at the right hand
[36:10] of God to make intercessions upon your
[36:13] confession in another place he says if I
[36:16] fell air to a house I sure wouldn't want
[36:18] to move into it till I got and looked
[36:20] everything over he said I want to see
[36:23] what's mine sir I want to see what I own
[36:27] and when I fell heir to the kingdom of
[36:29] God to the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[36:32] baptized into this great arcade of God's
[36:35] Eternal blessings I like to walk around
[36:37] and see what's mine yes sir he says look
[36:40] on the shelves and see what this is and
[36:42] he says here it is every promise in the
[36:45] book belongs to every believer every
[36:49] promise in this book belongs to every
[36:50] believer he said don't you stand still
[36:52] for somebody to push you off in a corner
[36:54] I love this don't you stand still for
[36:56] somebody to push you off in a corner and
[36:59] give you a little old cold Tater and
[37:01] tell you to wait he said don't you
[37:03] listen to that stuff that that'd be like
[37:05] in between Services over here if you
[37:07] walk in that door and somebody meets you
[37:09] at the door with just a little cold
[37:10] Tater and they push it on you and they
[37:12] say now go wait in that corner you watch
[37:14] everybody else go through this line and
[37:15] get this nice delicious warm food but
[37:18] you go in the corner with that cold
[37:20] Tater now Believers in this day now
[37:22] that'd be the devil standing at the door
[37:24] we don't have to take that cold Tater we
[37:27] can pass right by that cold Tater and we
[37:29] can go get some good food we can go get
[37:32] some some life preserving some eternal
[37:34] life food in this day some Mana that
[37:37] still got some life in it we can go
[37:39] through that line and get what the
[37:41] believer has comeing to
[37:42] him but if you stop for one second and
[37:46] get that little cold Tater then you're
[37:47] left with the cold Tater he's going to
[37:49] push you off in the corner and you're
[37:51] going to watch everybody else receive
[37:53] Their Blessings you're going to watch
[37:54] everybody else get full yeah right just
[37:57] passing by when he offers that cold
[37:59] Tater nobody wants cold
[38:01] Tater he says God's promis is right now
[38:05] he says push you off in a millennium
[38:07] somewhere the Bible said now we are the
[38:09] sons of God what we will be we are now
[38:13] present tense he said if anything that
[38:15] looks a little high and the blessing
[38:17] that looks like it why I'll get me a
[38:19] step ladder and move up doesn't God
[38:22] raise a standard sometimes or actually
[38:24] all the time when the enemy comes in
[38:25] like a flood he's going to ra up a
[38:29] standard says I like to look around it's
[38:32] all yours and every promise in the Bible
[38:35] is yours when a Christian gets saved God
[38:38] gives him a checkbook with the bottom of
[38:40] it with Jesus name signed in blood every
[38:43] Redemptive blessing belongs to the
[38:45] believer fill it out and send it in the
[38:47] headquarters Watch What
[38:49] Happens he says he's obligated to take
[38:53] care of his word if it's something in
[38:55] this word he's obligated to take care of
[38:58] it now we don't want to get in a hurry
[39:00] God is Sovereign in his timing so let's
[39:03] not put a timetable on God about these
[39:05] things there's benefits but then
[39:08] sometimes even working for an employer
[39:10] there's a waiting period you don't
[39:11] always get them benefits first day you
[39:13] may sign up for him the first day you
[39:15] may you may pray about something you
[39:17] need in your life but then sometimes
[39:19] it's 60 days sometimes it's 90 days and
[39:22] then you get them and that's how it
[39:24] works with God sometime sometimes it is
[39:26] the first day but we just don't want to
[39:28] put a timetable on God and say well Lord
[39:30] if if you don't give me this today this
[39:32] thing I've been praying for if I don't
[39:33] get it right now I I I'm just not going
[39:36] to ask anymore I'm just not too more I'm
[39:37] not interested in it
[39:39] anymore let's not give him a timetable
[39:42] he said I challenge any sick person or
[39:44] sinner tonight to sign your name or your
[39:47] wants above a check in Jesus name and
[39:50] send it into heaven once he said don't
[39:53] doubt he said the cashier is right there
[39:55] because the deposit was put there at
[39:57] Calvary through the blood of the Lord
[40:00] Jesus you know there's a when you think
[40:02] of a death inheritance when when there's
[40:04] a passing in the family and you're to
[40:07] you're to receive something that's going
[40:09] to be passed down to you that's a very
[40:11] sobering yet beautiful thing because
[40:12] there there it's something that's being
[40:14] passed down that's very important it may
[40:17] be a family heirloom it may be something
[40:19] very special but there had to be a death
[40:22] come in its place that death had to
[40:24] happen for it to be passed down to you
[40:26] like it was
[40:27] it's a very sacred thing you know when
[40:29] Christ bled and died for us at Calvary
[40:32] he didn't just pay for half an
[40:33] inheritance but he paid for the whole
[40:35] thing you know when the message of the
[40:38] hour came it wasn't just it wasn't just
[40:41] half a fullness of the word but it was
[40:42] all the fullness of the word it was a
[40:46] completion it was everything it wasn't
[40:49] just telling us half and then there's
[40:51] there's another half later to come come
[40:53] on but it's all it's everything it's all
[40:56] the Mysteries it's all the things that
[40:58] were scrupled up it's not just a little
[40:59] bit here and there I don't believe
[41:01] that's how God
[41:04] works so the prophet tells us the story
[41:06] of shamgar and his pressures in his life
[41:09] yeah he goes on here he says little
[41:11] shamgar had perhaps raised a good crop
[41:14] that year and the year before the
[41:16] Philistines come right in and get it so
[41:17] the year before the Philistines had came
[41:19] in he said and took his crop from him he
[41:22] says I can imagine seeing now with all
[41:24] of his Harvest over and he's got it all
[41:26] fixed in his barn and he's standing out
[41:28] in the barn one day looking around he
[41:29] says well I suppose maybe now we've got
[41:31] our crop in we've worked hard all summer
[41:35] and his wife and his kidy standing
[41:36] around he said well maybe we can eat
[41:39] this winter now now everything that
[41:41] they're sitting there looking at these
[41:43] are blessings from God these are things
[41:45] that God had he's given them and these
[41:47] are all things that are rightfully
[41:49] theirs at this
[41:51] moment he says what's that coming he
[41:54] says listens coming up the road what is
[41:56] it Trump chomp chomp tromp at 600
[41:59] Philistines armed men coming he says my
[42:02] my here it is again only thing we can do
[42:04] is sit back and let them take it
[42:07] again the prophet goes on he says that's
[42:10] the way the devil will do he lets you
[42:12] build up a little bit of something then
[42:14] come in and knock the props out from
[42:17] under you says the reason you let him do
[42:21] it he said the reason is you let him do
[42:24] it he said that's all he's just a bluff
[42:27] he has no legal right that's it the
[42:29] prophet goes on and say if you've got an
[42:31] experience of God yeah of the
[42:34] Resurrection Jesus Christ he stripped
[42:36] Satan of every privilege that he had and
[42:39] robbed him of everything he had he took
[42:42] it away from him yes sir he robbed him
[42:44] and stripped him and give the power to
[42:46] the church and today every believer has
[42:49] that same power in their life if they'll
[42:52] just recognize who they are if they'll
[42:53] recognize the position that they're
[42:55] standing in in this day yes sir so the
[42:58] this was my sermon I thought I was going
[42:59] to preach it today and then brother Joel
[43:01] gets up and he he preaches on the
[43:02] Awakening of the bride and says a lot
[43:04] recognize who you are in these different
[43:06] things and I was like what's the odds of
[43:08] that there's so many different things we
[43:10] could both have preached on but I don't
[43:13] know he said now go do the same things
[43:16] that I did that's right he took the
[43:18] sword out of Satan's hand and put it in
[43:21] your hand amen right few paragraphs down
[43:25] I love this right here he said little
[43:26] shamard are looked and you know what I
[43:28] say this to you Holiness people his
[43:31] righteous indignation got up and if you
[43:34] look up righteous indignation that's a
[43:35] righteous anger yeah you know that's a
[43:38] that's an anger that shamgar that that
[43:39] formed in him he was sick and tired of
[43:42] the enemy trying to steal things that
[43:43] were rightfully his he was sick and
[43:46] tired of those Philistines coming and
[43:48] taking things that God had blessed him
[43:50] with and that's how we got to get today
[43:53] come on we got to get bold with the word
[43:55] of God today we got to be able to stand
[43:57] firm sir he's going to come and he's
[43:59] going to try and take and take and take
[44:02] and that's all he wants to do but we
[44:04] have to be like little shamgar here and
[44:06] stand our ground and we'll see what
[44:07] shamgar did you know the shamgar was not
[44:11] a settler he didn't he wasn't his days
[44:13] of settling for this were over and the
[44:16] Bible it didn't say that we are settlers
[44:18] but as a song said it said we are
[44:21] conquerors we're not just here to settle
[44:23] down and just just take any weaping the
[44:25] devil wants to give us but we are here
[44:27] to conquer in Jesus Christ not in oursel
[44:30] but in Christ sir he goes on he says you
[44:33] know what I mean yes he said you know I
[44:35] seen a little sign one time I was
[44:36] walking into a football stadium to have
[44:38] a meeting he said there's a little sign
[44:40] up over the door said it's not the size
[44:42] of the dog in the fight it's the size of
[44:45] the fight in the dog he said that's
[44:48] right brother if you let the devil run
[44:50] over you he will just show you what size
[44:52] he is but you get a little grit yourself
[44:56] yes amen yeah can we get a little grit
[44:58] in the name of Jesus Christ can we get a
[45:01] little bit of that about oursel let him
[45:03] quit running us over day after day he
[45:06] said but you get a little grit yourself
[45:08] claim your god-given privileges in Jesus
[45:11] Christ and you'll Rejoice right he said
[45:14] that's right yes sir said old shamgar
[45:17] stood there and his righteous
[45:18] indignation got up and here they was
[45:21] Trump trump big heavy armor what did he
[45:23] do he said I am an Israelite I've been
[45:27] circumcised in other words receed the
[45:28] Holy Ghost he said I'm not a warrior I'm
[45:31] not a fighter and there's nothing I can
[45:33] do only I know one thing that's God that
[45:37] God's with me that's all I know and he
[45:40] reached up on the mantle and got an old
[45:42] Ox gold and a little old stick with a
[45:44] piece of brass on the end of it yeah he
[45:47] said you punch the dirt off the plow or
[45:49] beat the ox to the gate with it he
[45:51] jumped out there under the power of the
[45:53] Holy Ghost knowing that he knowed he had
[45:55] the right and and he slew 600
[45:59] Philistines
[46:00] Hallelujah he slew 600 Philistines and
[46:04] sometimes there's just one one Spirit
[46:07] tormenting us and we can't get enough
[46:09] grit about oursel just to slay that one
[46:11] Spirit just to get it out of our face
[46:14] and shamgar he slew 600 of them shamgar
[46:18] knew who he was whether he was mighty or
[46:21] not whether he was a warrior or not he
[46:23] knew that God was with him yes he knew
[46:26] he had some benefits of the believer in
[46:27] his day he had something backing him up
[46:30] in this day and that's the same God
[46:32] today that's the same unchanging God
[46:34] today if God did that back then he still
[46:37] got to do that now brother Joel hit that
[46:39] this morning it's the same unchanging
[46:42] God right amen now shamgar he could have
[46:45] just looked down and he could have he
[46:47] could have took the whiping just like he
[46:48] did last year he could have hung his
[46:50] head yes and you know that's sometime it
[46:53] it's a hard life as a Believer sometimes
[46:56] and some days it's easy to to look at
[46:58] the world maybe even for young people
[46:59] this might hit more with the young crowd
[47:02] it it's easy to look at at the young
[47:04] people in the world and say they look
[47:05] like they're having so much fun they
[47:07] don't have to dress any certain way they
[47:09] don't have to look any certain way they
[47:11] don't have this this message we call it
[47:13] to abide by yeah they they look like
[47:16] they're just full of joy and and just
[47:18] having so much fun but what the enemy
[47:21] will do sometimes is if he sees that
[47:23] he's got you on the road that he wants
[47:25] you on he might keep you comfortable for
[47:27] a season if he sees that he's got you
[47:30] going the direction that he wants you to
[47:32] go not not the straight and narrow not
[47:34] God's not God's road but his Road he'll
[47:37] keep people not just young people but
[47:39] old people he he'll keep them
[47:40] comfortable in their ways he's never
[47:43] going to kick up a fuss with him because
[47:44] he don't want them to try and do
[47:46] anything different he wants them to stay
[47:48] on that same road doing the same things
[47:50] and some that's why their lives look
[47:52] easy sometimes people that are living
[47:54] worldly that are abiding by the world's
[47:56] rules
[47:57] that's why it looks simple but we ought
[48:00] to be the happiest people in the world
[48:02] today with this word that we have with
[48:05] the Lord with the realization of who we
[48:07] are yes of the blood of Jesus Christ we
[48:10] ought to be happy put a smile on our
[48:12] face not a frown not hanging our head
[48:16] not acting like a whipped dog but I can
[48:18] I want to cross that Finish Line running
[48:21] I don't want to come crawling up to it I
[48:23] want to cross that thing
[48:25] sprinting I I don't want to be just on
[48:27] my last leg hopping
[48:29] across but in the name of Jesus Christ I
[48:31] want to run across listen how the
[48:34] prophet speaks about the believer here
[48:36] he says our spirit is clean it is fresh
[48:39] it is real it is sober and serious but
[48:42] nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord
[48:46] the Christian ought to be just as
[48:47] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[48:49] the Lord as the world is when it savors
[48:52] and delights in its Pleasures we ought
[48:54] to be just as happy you see them happy
[48:56] out doing what they're doing we ought to
[48:58] be even happier than that and here doing
[49:00] what we're doing living the life that
[49:02] we're living living the life for Jesus
[49:04] Christ in this day he says both
[49:06] Christians and the world are human both
[49:09] have emotions the difference is the
[49:11] Christians hearts and emotions are
[49:13] purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love
[49:17] while the world satisfies the flesh
[49:20] right you know going forward speaking on
[49:22] these benefits of the believer just a
[49:24] little bit more what about the benefits
[49:26] that the the prophet had in his ministry
[49:29] what about those benefits all that
[49:30] healing and deliverance that we hear on
[49:32] tape those prayer lines that the signs
[49:35] and wonders the Miracles coming forth
[49:37] these things happening you know I've
[49:38] caught myself before saying man I wish I
[49:41] could have been there I wish I could
[49:43] have been a part of that now I would
[49:44] have liked to have seen it yeah but when
[49:46] I take that attitude man I wish I could
[49:48] have been there because that stuff was
[49:49] happening there well do I think that it
[49:52] can't happen here too do I think that it
[49:54] can't happen right now too
[49:57] because I saw where those things were
[49:59] put into the Bible but I never saw where
[50:01] they were taken out of the Bible those
[50:03] things are to the believer until the end
[50:06] they can still happen here today we
[50:08] don't need to put it off some other time
[50:10] but it can happen right here right now
[50:12] it can happen any day that we need it
[50:14] amen he goes on this is in the church
[50:16] age book he said and this Comfort is not
[50:19] he was talking about the the Seven Stars
[50:21] in his hand and he says and this Comfort
[50:23] is not for the seven Church age
[50:25] Messengers only every True Believer is
[50:28] in the hand of God and can draw from his
[50:30] love and power yeah and receive the full
[50:34] benefit of all that God is to the
[50:37] believer the full benefit not half a
[50:39] benefit not just a little bit of it but
[50:41] the full
[50:42] benefit he says what God gives the
[50:45] messenger and How He blesses and uses
[50:47] the messenger is an example to all
[50:49] believers of his goodness and care to
[50:52] all members of his body yes not just to
[50:55] the prophet not just to the preachers
[50:57] the teachers the evangelists the
[50:58] apostles not just to the song leader but
[51:01] to all members of his
[51:03] body right these benefits are available
[51:06] right in another message he said in the
[51:09] days of the seventh messenger in the
[51:11] days of the leoan age its Messenger will
[51:14] reveal the mysteries of God as revealed
[51:16] to Paul he will speak out and those who
[51:20] receive that prophet in his own name
[51:22] will receive the beneficient effect of
[51:25] that prophet's Ministry that's right yes
[51:27] and they that hear him will be blessed
[51:30] and become part of that Bride of the
[51:32] last day yes that's
[51:35] right goes on in another place now the
[51:37] first human beings disfellowship
[51:39] themselves from believing God by
[51:42] disbelieving his word and listening to a
[51:44] lie of the devil now that's the first
[51:47] thing that dis Fellowship this wonderful
[51:49] union now look Adam and Eve in a
[51:51] position to never die in a position to
[51:54] never be old to never be sick to never
[51:58] have a worry you say I sure wish I could
[52:02] be like that he said I got news for you
[52:05] you are in the same position right when
[52:09] is that going to become real to each and
[52:11] every one of us you are in the same
[52:13] position right the very same as they
[52:16] were he said God places that to every
[52:19] creature on the earth in the same
[52:21] position he says what was the agreement
[52:24] if you'll keep my words if my word if
[52:27] you keep it believe it and if you act
[52:30] upon it today we have so many different
[52:33] different coverages and policies in our
[52:35] life so many different you know programs
[52:38] or maybe memberships that we're part of
[52:40] and when we're a part of something like
[52:41] that what we like to do is we get down
[52:43] and we'll read the fine print of that
[52:45] contract we we'll just we'll read every
[52:47] line of it we won't we won't let any
[52:50] benefit get past us yeah and that's in
[52:52] the physical we won't let one benefit
[52:55] slip away from us if we got a gym
[52:57] membership we're going to know we're
[52:59] going to know everything we got to know
[53:00] about that membership we're going to
[53:02] know everything if we got one free hour
[53:04] of yoga we're going to make sure we get
[53:05] that one free hour yoga in we're not
[53:07] going to let that pass Us by but then
[53:10] speaking on the spiritual why can't we
[53:11] look into this book and look into this
[53:14] message and read the fine print there
[53:17] and not let one thing slip Us by no
[53:20] matter you before you go to the gym you
[53:22] might have had a really bad day but you
[53:24] don't let the benefits there slip away
[53:26] so even even if you had a bad day before
[53:27] you walk through those doors back there
[53:29] we still can't let a benefit slip past
[53:32] us we got to grab a hold of each and
[53:34] every one of them it's our god-given
[53:36] right in this day and if you don't grab
[53:38] a hold of them the enemy will sit there
[53:40] and watch you and he'll know if you did
[53:41] or
[53:42] not and if you don't he's going to keep
[53:45] on
[53:45] tormenting he's going to keep on
[53:48] oppressing you'll stay in
[53:51] bondage then after we read it we have to
[53:54] make a claim on the word there's an old
[53:55] saying staken a claim and that was the
[53:58] California Gold Rush day there was time
[54:00] that the land was worth so much that
[54:01] people were just scrambling they would
[54:03] be out there and they would literally be
[54:04] putting Stakes down in the ground they'
[54:06] be staking out what property that they
[54:09] wanted and so the idea was I I want this
[54:12] property it's going to benefit me a lot
[54:13] it's going to make me a lot of money
[54:15] it's going to make me a rich man it's
[54:16] going to make my life easier it's going
[54:18] to do these things for me that was the
[54:21] idea of it and if there's any piece of
[54:23] ground in the believer's life if there's
[54:25] any piece of ground that the enemy is
[54:27] occupying in your life go put a stake
[54:30] down on it that can be your
[54:33] ground go put some Stakes down and once
[54:36] drive them deep in there and once those
[54:37] Stakes get down that's yours claim that
[54:41] benefit yes he goes on in another place
[54:43] he says now keep those things in mind
[54:45] The Church Must Believe every word every
[54:48] promise every Iota and claim it for
[54:51] themselves and exercise themselves in it
[54:55] he says if I was engag to a girl and I
[54:57] was a single man I'd send her something
[54:59] an engagement ring and if she wouldn't
[55:02] wear it then that shows that she doesn't
[55:04] believe me she doesn't want to be my
[55:06] bride right come on what are we showing
[55:09] God when we won't claim these benefits
[55:11] what do we saying to him yes he goes on
[55:15] he says she doesn't want to be my bride
[55:17] and if Christ sends his church the gifts
[55:19] that he promised and they refused them
[55:21] and say they're not so yeah they don't
[55:24] want to be the bride of Christ
[55:27] right that's a strong statement they
[55:29] don't want to be the bride of Christ he
[55:32] didn't put any he didn't put any certain
[55:34] criteria on that and he said well if
[55:35] their days is really bad then we can
[55:37] maybe they do want to be part of the
[55:38] bride of Christ but no he said if I send
[55:41] them and they say they're not so and
[55:42] they refuse them they don't want to be a
[55:44] part of the bride of Christ says they
[55:46] are a espouse to some other lover and
[55:49] not to Christ the bridegroom so the real
[55:52] Church keeps the promise and keeps all
[55:55] and accepts the gifts that God sends
[55:57] them all right now this in the deity of
[56:01] Jesus Christ this is probably one of the
[56:02] most powerful quotes I've ever read he
[56:04] said in that same power that same Christ
[56:07] Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let
[56:09] them people who deny the power of God
[56:12] and say it's wrong but the same power
[56:16] that spoke the world into existence is
[56:19] in those people that's got the Holy
[56:21] Ghost the same power that spoke the
[56:24] world into existence it's in the people
[56:27] that's got the Holy Ghost he said that's
[56:28] right men and women it's time that we
[56:31] found out who we are he said the devil
[56:34] is trying to hide you back tell you that
[56:36] you're some little cow down something
[56:38] you're not you are Sons and Daughters of
[56:41] God right he says the deity is not in
[56:46] heaven he said it's in you right the
[56:50] deity is not some Far Away thing it is
[56:53] living in you Hallelujah he says I I
[56:56] know you think I'm crazy but let me tell
[56:58] you something brother when you realize
[57:00] there it is again that same statement
[57:03] when you realize if you realize if you
[57:06] can see that almighty God lives in you
[57:10] immortal life my life I give Zoey the
[57:14] life of God is in the human being with
[57:17] statements like that from a Vindicated
[57:18] Prophet why can we not recognize these
[57:21] things and you know sometimes we can we
[57:24] do recognize these things but but what's
[57:26] worse than not recognizing is
[57:28] recognizing and still not claiming these
[57:30] things maybe you do recognize your
[57:32] position but then you got to claim
[57:34] something come on now you may recognize
[57:36] who you are yeah but you got to claim it
[57:39] right we said you got to enroll in those
[57:41] benefits
[57:42] amen now the technical word of that if
[57:45] we're talking about a situation in the
[57:47] law it would be disclaiming oh it's the
[57:49] refusal of an inheritance yes it's not
[57:52] being interested in it yes and now most
[57:54] of the time in those cases says when
[57:56] there's a refusal of inheritance it's
[57:58] because there's not a good relationship
[58:00] between the two yeah the one that's
[58:02] trying to pass it down it's because you
[58:04] two are not you're not speaking you're
[58:06] not in good relations right you're not
[58:08] talking as much as you
[58:10] should they've left you out you've left
[58:12] them out and that's how it gets with God
[58:15] sometimes right we start refusing that
[58:17] inheritance well it's probably because
[58:19] there's not enough communication going
[58:21] on it's probably because you don't feel
[58:24] comfortable accepting that inheritance
[58:25] right now
[58:27] and maybe when you don't feel
[58:28] comfortable when the when the devil sees
[58:29] you hang your head about something he's
[58:31] going to attack that he's watching each
[58:33] and every single one of us he's watching
[58:35] our reaction he's watching what we do
[58:38] with certain people and he uses those
[58:40] things and he'll use those things to try
[58:42] and get us to refuse any benefit that
[58:44] God has for us if he can't keep you from
[58:47] becoming a son or daughter of God he's
[58:49] definitely going to try and Rob you of
[58:51] the benefits of it if he can't stop you
[58:53] from that from being baptized into the
[58:55] into the Holy Ghost and it coming inside
[58:57] of you and God living inside of you he's
[58:59] going to try and then rob you of every
[59:01] benefit he's going to try and keep
[59:03] anything God has for you out of your
[59:05] reach he's going to try and keep you too
[59:07] far back too away from it and that's
[59:09] just the way he works and he's worked
[59:11] that same way throughout history you can
[59:13] read the scripture and you can see a
[59:14] pattern of how he works you know Jehovah
[59:18] Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new
[59:20] well Satan of the old is Satan of the
[59:22] new he works the same way too just as
[59:24] God has a provided way Satan has his own
[59:26] provided way as well and he's going to
[59:29] try and get you on that provided way yes
[59:32] yes and sometimes because of our past or
[59:35] something the the enemy he likes to hold
[59:37] things above your head he likes to hold
[59:39] things over your head you've done things
[59:41] that maybe only you and him know that
[59:43] you've
[59:44] done that's a deep thing he likes to
[59:46] hold stuff like that over the believer's
[59:48] head he likes to sit there and dangling
[59:50] and say well do you really deserve what
[59:52] God has for you should you even be
[59:55] asking this are you worthy to be asking
[59:58] this he knows he's seen what you've done
[1:00:01] he's seen you every day of your life so
[1:00:04] he knows these things and he can shame
[1:00:07] us sometimes so much and when he gets on
[1:00:09] when he gets on you and he's shaming you
[1:00:11] over and over again it'll just keep you
[1:00:14] paralyzed as a Believer he'll he'll keep
[1:00:16] you thinking you're not good enough
[1:00:18] he'll keep you thinking that you don't
[1:00:19] deserve those benefits and if he can get
[1:00:22] you thinking you don't deserve those
[1:00:23] benefits you'll never try and try and
[1:00:26] enroll in that program you'll never go
[1:00:28] after those benefits he'll keep you at a
[1:00:31] stalemate that's what he wants to do
[1:00:33] keep you well the prophet told us if you
[1:00:35] ain't moving forward you ain't moving
[1:00:37] backwards you're you're you're not just
[1:00:39] going to stay still so more than likely
[1:00:41] you're going to scoot on backwards a
[1:00:42] little bit you're going to fall
[1:00:44] backwards right a prophet says in
[1:00:46] another
[1:00:47] place I love this right here he says
[1:00:50] every Angel Archangel every principality
[1:00:52] and power he tore down and spoiled at
[1:00:56] his crucifixion and Resurrection
[1:00:59] everything Satan had he broke through
[1:01:01] the veil of sin he tore it apart with
[1:01:04] the high priest's blood of his own body
[1:01:07] excuse me he come to the next what was
[1:01:10] it it was a veil of sickness that held
[1:01:12] over the people he tore it apart for he
[1:01:15] was wounded for our transgression with
[1:01:18] his stripes we were healed he went
[1:01:20] through the great Veil Yonder of
[1:01:22] sickness the great veil of sin he went
[1:01:25] through the Great great veil of worry
[1:01:27] yes how many people is that Veil covered
[1:01:29] over here tonight the great veil of
[1:01:31] worry now you can be you can be have a a
[1:01:34] Christian concern about something you
[1:01:36] can be concerned but don't let it eat at
[1:01:38] you so much that it turns into a
[1:01:40] worry it's it's not against the
[1:01:43] scripture to be concerned about a
[1:01:44] situation or a person or something but
[1:01:46] don't let it Fester don't let it turn
[1:01:48] into it commit it to the Lord and move
[1:01:51] on he goes on and he says he went
[1:01:54] through the great veil of fear
[1:01:56] he tore every one of them down and he
[1:01:58] ascended so high and received the name
[1:02:01] above every name that's named in the
[1:02:03] heavens above or in Earth Below or in
[1:02:05] the world to come God taken that lovely
[1:02:08] one who stooped down so low that even he
[1:02:11] didn't have a place to be born or a
[1:02:14] place to die God exalted him on high and
[1:02:17] give him a Crown of Glory under a name
[1:02:20] above every name he says there he sits
[1:02:23] today the mighty conqueror since he rent
[1:02:26] every veil in two the veil of sin was
[1:02:29] rent two the veil of sickness was rent
[1:02:32] two and every Veil that kept man away
[1:02:35] from God yes he said was written too I
[1:02:38] am the way the truth and the life he
[1:02:41] broke every Power he scattered every
[1:02:45] devil he made a search light from Glory
[1:02:48] that day he goes on he says there he
[1:02:50] sits the mighty conqueror he rent every
[1:02:53] Veil into he rent The Veil that you
[1:02:55] could be sa saved he rent The Veil that
[1:02:57] if you've committed adultery if you have
[1:03:00] cursed if you've done anything wrong he
[1:03:03] rent that Veil for
[1:03:05] you so that's those sticks as it
[1:03:07] mentioned that that the enemy that he
[1:03:09] wants to hold above your head these
[1:03:11] things that he wants to hold and and he
[1:03:13] wants to wave it above your head and and
[1:03:14] tell you're not good enough he rent
[1:03:16] those things in two whatever it may be
[1:03:19] at Calvary at his crucifixion at his
[1:03:22] resurrection he rent those things into
[1:03:27] and so feel free that's the word feel
[1:03:29] free to tell the enemy that when he's
[1:03:31] coming at you with those things speak
[1:03:33] the word to him don't just don't just
[1:03:36] keep it in your mind speak it out loud
[1:03:37] to him say it out loud to the devil
[1:03:39] you'd be in the middle of Walmart and
[1:03:41] act like a crazy person if he's
[1:03:43] tormenting you walking through there
[1:03:44] tell him no tell him what the word says
[1:03:47] who cares what we look like it's too
[1:03:48] late hour to care what we look like to
[1:03:50] everybody else right now but we need to
[1:03:53] turn into conquerors we don't need to
[1:03:55] just just walk walk on this Earth and
[1:03:57] just settle for this and settle for that
[1:03:59] but we need to turn into conquerors at
[1:04:00] some point this word has blessed us too
[1:04:03] much it's given us too much for us to
[1:04:06] sit
[1:04:07] still and take that cold
[1:04:09] Tater I keep coming back to that cold
[1:04:13] Tater he goes on he says that stick that
[1:04:15] Satan holds over you he rent it if
[1:04:18] you'll only receive him he said if
[1:04:22] you're sick today and the doctor says
[1:04:23] you can't get well he rent that that
[1:04:25] Veil un too and everything is broken
[1:04:29] before God he rent every Veil he tears
[1:04:32] down every domain and he sits there
[1:04:35] today the mighty conqueror since he rent
[1:04:37] The Veil into as brother Joel said this
[1:04:40] morning it's very possible for us we can
[1:04:42] go a long time before recognizing who we
[1:04:44] are and he talked about the baby eagle
[1:04:46] and brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:04:47] here a Son of God can go a long time
[1:04:50] before he recognizes that he is a son a
[1:04:53] son or a daughter of God you can go a
[1:04:54] long time before before you recognize
[1:04:56] that before you move upon anything yes
[1:04:59] now the enemy wants the believer to stay
[1:05:02] as far away from that Revelation is
[1:05:04] possible that's one Revelation he does
[1:05:06] not want you to get that's one he's
[1:05:08] going to push you away from yes there's
[1:05:11] a I think he he mentioned brother Joel
[1:05:13] mentioned invisible Army this morning
[1:05:15] the quote here it says he knows and now
[1:05:17] this is speaking of the devil he knows
[1:05:20] that if the that if the people get the
[1:05:22] true revelation of the true church and
[1:05:25] what she is what she stands for and that
[1:05:29] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:05:33] an invincible Army right she will be an
[1:05:38] invincible Army now that's going to take
[1:05:41] some
[1:05:42] Faith now it's not some far off mystical
[1:05:45] Faith like sometimes we make it when we
[1:05:47] come to get prayed for or if we're
[1:05:48] praying for somebody else and we're
[1:05:50] we're we're thinking about do I have
[1:05:52] enough faith for this it's not some far
[1:05:53] off mystical complicated Faith but just
[1:05:57] as like the night of the Passover that
[1:05:58] hsip what did they apply what they apply
[1:06:01] that blood with they applied it with the
[1:06:03] hsip yeah and brother brandham said that
[1:06:05] hsip represented faith that word it
[1:06:08] means your faith and now he also said
[1:06:10] about that hsip that little common weed
[1:06:12] he said it could be found anywhere you
[1:06:15] could find you could find that hiss up
[1:06:17] anywhere you look around you just pull
[1:06:19] it up yeah and now we make Faith so
[1:06:21] complicated sometimes but it's like that
[1:06:23] hsip it's such a simple thing but we
[1:06:26] like to twist it and and make it into
[1:06:28] something that's not it's a very simple
[1:06:31] thing a prophet said faith is a
[1:06:33] revelation yes he told us that Faith was
[1:06:36] a revelation something that's revealed
[1:06:38] to you that you have it's a substance
[1:06:40] something like gas in the
[1:06:43] tank that's what I look at Faith as it's
[1:06:45] it's gas in the believer's tank it's
[1:06:47] what can keep the believer pushing
[1:06:49] forward in this hour right but a lot of
[1:06:52] us stay tied because we make it too
[1:06:54] complicated we make it into something
[1:06:56] that's
[1:06:57] unachievable we look at it like we're
[1:06:59] not able to obtain that it reminds me of
[1:07:01] the Crow story how that Crow's sitting
[1:07:03] there and he's tied on his ankle and
[1:07:04] he's hopping around he's hopping around
[1:07:06] he's calling and what he was probably
[1:07:08] saying when he was calling he was
[1:07:09] probably crying out for help he's
[1:07:11] probably saying come untie me somebody
[1:07:13] come help me then the man came and he
[1:07:15] untied him and then after even after he
[1:07:18] was untied he had got so conditioned he
[1:07:20] had been so and just like us we get so
[1:07:22] conditioned by the enemy sometimes that
[1:07:25] crowed became
[1:07:26] untied and he just sat there and kept
[1:07:28] hopping in the same Circle that he had
[1:07:30] always been in he had no Revelation in
[1:07:33] his life that he had been untied he
[1:07:36] didn't recognize now that he could fly
[1:07:37] off he didn't recognize what he could do
[1:07:42] and so he sit there and he stayed in the
[1:07:44] same rut that he had been in he kept
[1:07:46] just hopping around calling for help in
[1:07:49] the same rut little did he know he had
[1:07:51] been
[1:07:52] untied he had the opportunity to leave
[1:07:55] the prophet says in a message he says
[1:07:56] you may think you are tied too brother
[1:07:58] sister that wrote this question you may
[1:08:00] think the devil has got you tied down
[1:08:02] there but he's lying there was one time
[1:08:05] a man come to Earth Jesus Christ the son
[1:08:08] of God he untied you don't you believe
[1:08:11] it you don't have to stay down there no
[1:08:13] sir you're free that's right he died in
[1:08:16] your place to take away your sins you
[1:08:20] just believe on him flop your wings and
[1:08:22] fly away with the rest of them don't
[1:08:25] stay in that pit of the devil no
[1:08:27] sir and the person that it's a this is a
[1:08:30] questions and answers he says now will
[1:08:32] you lay your hands upon me and free me
[1:08:34] from that they asked brother Brandon
[1:08:35] this he said sister dear or brother dear
[1:08:38] sure I'd lay hands on you but that
[1:08:41] wouldn't free you all right yeah he said
[1:08:43] what would free you is to understand
[1:08:46] that you're already free all right yeah
[1:08:49] he said you're already untied you don't
[1:08:52] have to worry about being free you're
[1:08:54] already free Jesus made you free be not
[1:08:57] again entangled in the Yoke of bondage
[1:08:59] it says you're free as you can be you
[1:09:02] don't have to be tangled up any
[1:09:05] longer and that's to us sitting here
[1:09:07] tonight we don't have to be this is a
[1:09:09] simple message this is maybe just a
[1:09:10] little encouragement these quotes and
[1:09:13] these the these scriptures just a little
[1:09:15] bit of encouragement you don't have to
[1:09:16] be tied any longer you don't have to
[1:09:19] settle in this day all right you have to
[1:09:22] settle for what Satan has for you right
[1:09:25] but you take what God has for you and
[1:09:27] become a conqueror in this
[1:09:29] hour accept the benefits of the believer
[1:09:32] yes as a musicians come I went just a
[1:09:35] little bit over 15 minutes I didn't as
[1:09:39] musicians can they can come up we have
[1:09:42] to recognize the freedom that Christ
[1:09:43] paid for we have to stake our claim in
[1:09:46] that
[1:09:49] freedom yes we have to drive that stake
[1:09:52] down deep if I could just read Maybe
[1:09:56] one or two more quotes
[1:09:58] here in the message of token he says and
[1:10:01] everything that Jesus purchased and
[1:10:03] promised you in the Bible is yours it's
[1:10:06] your property because it's paid for
[1:10:09] amen he said life is mine he paid for it
[1:10:14] life is yours he paid for it healing is
[1:10:17] mine he paid for it healing is yours he
[1:10:21] paid for let's actually everybody say
[1:10:22] life is mine
[1:10:25] say healing is
[1:10:27] mine Freedom Is
[1:10:29] Mine Heaven is mine he paid the
[1:10:34] price he paid the price for those
[1:10:36] things they're mine they're yours just
[1:10:40] one more quote here if you knowed
[1:10:42] positionally who you was and what you
[1:10:44] are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble
[1:10:47] person in here in the next five
[1:10:50] minutes he said that's right the thing
[1:10:53] of it is you're looking off into a
[1:10:56] millennium for something to happen you
[1:10:58] know we can't be waiting on something in
[1:11:00] the future to take God at his word the
[1:11:03] benefits are now we don't have to wait
[1:11:05] for another event we don't have to wait
[1:11:07] for anything like that but we can take
[1:11:09] God now at his word right now right this
[1:11:12] second any time any place we can take
[1:11:15] him at his
[1:11:17] word he said looking off into a
[1:11:19] millennium for something to happen when
[1:11:20] it's already here he said now we are the
[1:11:23] sons of God not we will be we are right
[1:11:27] now he said when this night he said
[1:11:30] right now this minute we're seated
[1:11:32] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:34] Jesus right now said oh if you'd only
[1:11:37] recognize that and the supreme authority
[1:11:40] that Jesus Christ has given to every
[1:11:43] believer anything you have desire of
[1:11:46] anything you have need of only thing you
[1:11:48] have to do is ask and receive it good he
[1:11:52] said whatsoever things you desire When
[1:11:54] you pray believe you receive it it'll be
[1:11:56] given unto you he said St Mark
[1:12:00] 11:24 and that's true whatsoever things
[1:12:02] you desire When you pray believe that
[1:12:05] you receive it and you shall have it you
[1:12:08] know today I hope that there was listen
[1:12:10] to the message this morning and coming
[1:12:12] into tonight I hope there was some but
[1:12:14] God moments he read that scripture at
[1:12:15] the end some but God moment you know I
[1:12:17] came in here seeking healing I came in
[1:12:20] here seeking a deeper Revelation I came
[1:12:22] in here seeking to be closer with the
[1:12:23] Lord and then the enemy attacks you on
[1:12:25] those things he knows that's what you
[1:12:27] want and he attacks you on those things
[1:12:29] but but then you look at him and you say
[1:12:31] but God who is rich in
[1:12:34] Mercy let's have some but God moments
[1:12:37] but God who is rich in Mercy but God who
[1:12:40] is rich in healing of my body but God
[1:12:43] who is abundant in Revelation but God
[1:12:46] who's the love Giver who's the faith
