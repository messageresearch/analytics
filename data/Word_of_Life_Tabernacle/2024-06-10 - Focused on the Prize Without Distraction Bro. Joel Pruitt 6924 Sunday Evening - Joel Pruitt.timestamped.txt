[48:05] verse and focus on it here and this I
[48:07] speak for your own Prophet not that I
[48:09] may cast a snare upon you but for that
[48:12] which is comely and that ye may attend
[48:14] upon the Lord without distraction and
[48:17] you may have your seats this evening may
[48:19] the Lord add his Blessing to the word I
[48:21] I want to just lay a foundation with
[48:22] this quote here brother brandham talks
[48:24] about uh uh looking ahead and not
[48:26] looking back back and he says not
[48:28] looking back but we're looking forward
[48:29] to the breaking of a new day until there
[48:32] is something great laying ahead of us
[48:34] how many believes that tonight there's
[48:35] something great I believe there's a
[48:37] prize before us and we need to keep our
[48:39] focus in this hour above any other time
[48:42] I think now is the time we don't need to
[48:44] lose our Focus we don't need to get
[48:45] distracted by the things of the world
[48:47] but we need to keep our focus a and
[48:49] continue on with W with without
[48:51] distraction and and brother brand says
[48:53] looking for the breaking of a new day
[48:55] there is something great great laying
[48:57] ahead of us can you say Amen where the
[48:59] years has been the the the joy that
[49:01] we've been looking forward to the
[49:03] pressing coming of the great light and
[49:05] now we can see it breaking Over the
[49:07] Horizon he said it it's breaking between
[49:10] Mortal and immortality and we see it
[49:12] breaking between the heavens and the
[49:14] Earth from an Earthbound sickness and
[49:16] troubled world into a bright shining day
[49:19] of an immortal life and an immortal body
[49:22] and an immortal Earth that shall never
[49:24] pass away that sounds like a good place
[49:26] to to be he says it it's shalom to the
[49:29] church now it's light time for the
[49:31] Believers can you say Amen but a gross
[49:33] Darkness for the unbelievers it's for
[49:35] the church for the people but now it's a
[49:37] time of light for us it's a time it's a
[49:40] time of of immortality that's coming
[49:42] into you listen if you're not distracted
[49:44] you can see where we're headed you can
[49:46] see the prize that lays ahead of us if
[49:48] you're not if you're not caught by
[49:50] distractions of the world now now there
[49:52] must be a desire to win there must be a
[49:54] desire to actually reach your gold there
[49:57] must there must be a desire in you young
[49:59] people's hearts to actually reach for
[50:01] the prize that is ahead of us can you
[50:04] say Amen there's got to be a desire
[50:06] there you're never going to reach it if
[50:07] you're distracted and always just
[50:09] looking to this way and looking that way
[50:11] no there's got to be a desire to keep on
[50:13] pressing the battle can you say amen I
[50:16] press towards the Mark I press towards
[50:18] the prize I press why because it is a
[50:21] battle it is a time that you got to
[50:23] fight it is a time that you got to keep
[50:25] pressing but you cannot get distracted
[50:28] by what the devil's going to try to
[50:29] bring you down with he doesn't want you
[50:31] to get to your prize he doesn't want you
[50:32] to make your to make your goal he
[50:34] doesn't want you to make it all the way
[50:36] because he knows if he can get you
[50:38] distracted in the age of distractions in
[50:41] a time of distraction he knows he can
[50:43] keep you Earthbound but I I I think
[50:45] there's a young people here there's a
[50:47] group of people here today that are not
[50:49] going to be Earthbound creatures but we
[50:51] are eagles and we are we are to be
[50:53] caught up into a realm that is going to
[50:55] break from mortal into immortality well
[50:58] I wish somebody would say Amen tonight
[51:00] somebody's going to make it somebody's
[51:02] going to reach the prize somebody's got
[51:04] to hold the trophy at the end of the
[51:06] year think about a football
[51:08] season think about a football season
[51:10] it's a long season and if you got a bad
[51:13] team it's an even worse season but if
[51:15] you got if you got a team some of you
[51:18] kids know about football
[51:19] right you got a long season and you
[51:22] start off and you got to win so many
[51:24] games or may you may not even make the
[51:25] playoffs if you get distracted by the
[51:27] money or you get distracted by another
[51:29] team well they're too good to beat let
[51:31] me tell you something it's all up here
[51:34] you you you've got to keep fighting no
[51:35] matter how good the I tell you what your
[51:37] opponent is the devil and he looks
[51:39] strong but he cannot overtake you
[51:41] because you've got the greatest coach in
[51:44] the history of coaches you've got the
[51:46] greatest quarterback in the history of
[51:48] quarterbacks and it's not Tom
[51:52] Brady come think about it if God is on
[51:55] your side you are going to hold the
[51:57] trophy at the end of the season so when
[52:01] the Super Bowl comes around and you're
[52:03] the
[52:04] underdog you can't
[52:06] lose because it's already been rigged in
[52:09] your favor God has already given you the
[52:12] ability to win he's already given you
[52:14] everything you need you've seen the
[52:16] Playbook and you already know every play
[52:19] and so when the devil puts you back from
[52:21] first and 10 to Second and
[52:23] 15 well if you ladies don't have a clue
[52:25] what I'm talking about
[52:27] out and he gives you a
[52:30] setback and you feel defeated before you
[52:32] even play another down well what it is
[52:35] it's the devil on defense and he's
[52:38] trying to stop you from winning the game
[52:41] but all you need is just one good pass
[52:44] all you need is just one good down and
[52:47] then you make another down all you need
[52:49] is a first down and another first down
[52:51] and the next thing you know you're
[52:52] you're holding the football in the end
[52:54] zone what is it you've you've defeated
[52:56] your enemy and you've made it to your
[52:58] goal and now you've got a chance to win
[53:01] the game now that's the way this I know
[53:02] this is simple but I'm trying to put it
[53:04] where the kids can understand it you've
[53:05] got a goal then you want to hold that
[53:08] trophy at the end of the game now you've
[53:10] got to fight with all you've got for 60
[53:12] minutes or better you've got to fight
[53:14] with everything that's in you if you're
[53:16] just distracted by how good that other
[53:18] team looks or if you're distracted by
[53:20] the scoreboard you may never win but
[53:23] you've got to quit looking at your
[53:25] distractions and start looking at the
[53:27] goal hold that Trophy up before you and
[53:30] say that's my goal and I'm not going to
[53:32] leave here defeated but I'm going to
[53:35] well come on somebody I'm not leaving
[53:37] this place defeated but I'm going to
[53:39] keep pressing on until I can hold that
[53:41] trophy in my
[53:43] hand we we've let the devil tell us we
[53:46] can't win we've let the devil tell us
[53:48] that we're not good enough we're not big
[53:50] enough we're not strong enough well you
[53:51] may not be in your own self but with God
[53:54] on your side oh all things are possible
[53:57] to them that believe all things are
[54:00] possible to them that are I tell you
[54:02] what you're an overcomer you young
[54:03] people were put in Leia because God knew
[54:06] you could handle it that's right God
[54:09] knew you could win in a time where so
[54:12] many would fall away and sit down and
[54:14] didn't want to win now there's got to be
[54:16] a desire now in Psalms 27:4 David said
[54:19] one thing have I desired of the Lord and
[54:21] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[54:24] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[54:26] my life life to behold the beauty of the
[54:28] Lord and to inquire in his Temple now
[54:30] you've got to have a desire for the
[54:32] things of the Lord you've got to have a
[54:34] desire to seek after the things of the
[54:36] Lord you've got to have a desire to
[54:38] behold the beauty of the Lord you've got
[54:40] to have a desire to inquire in his
[54:42] Temple well can you say Amen you've got
[54:44] to have a desire in order to make these
[54:46] things happen if you have no desire to
[54:48] come to church then it won't do you no
[54:50] good to be in church if you don't have a
[54:52] desire for the things of the Lord then
[54:54] the things of the Lord will have no hold
[54:55] on you but if you have a desire for the
[54:57] things of God then nothing can keep you
[55:00] from getting your full potential in the
[55:02] house of God now if you want healing
[55:04] don't be distracted by the sickness come
[55:07] on yeah well can you say Amen if you
[55:10] want healing you can't be looking at the
[55:12] symptoms that's a distraction I I if you
[55:15] want some I'll tell you what you've got
[55:16] to follow the orders of faith in total
[55:20] Faith you got to follow the orders of
[55:22] the word in total Faith you've got to
[55:24] you've got to surrender your own
[55:25] thinking you got to surrender the
[55:27] distractions to be able to overcome the
[55:30] distractions that are trying to stop you
[55:32] well can somebody say Amen now now
[55:33] there's going to be all kinds of
[55:34] distractions let me go ahead and tell
[55:36] you there's distractions from the
[55:37] message of the hour by by by false
[55:39] prophets there's there's there's false
[55:41] Messengers well come on somebody there's
[55:43] going to be false teachers on the
[55:44] internet some of you are going to see
[55:46] you're going to see them at some point
[55:47] in life listen you you can't hide them
[55:49] forever we can we can shelter our
[55:51] children but there's going to be Devils
[55:52] come in their minds and say well what
[55:54] about this and what about that well
[55:55] listen there's going to be Devils come
[55:57] against you to distract you from your
[56:00] goal now in this age there is an
[56:01] ultimate goal for the Believers and I
[56:03] hope this is okay for you young people
[56:05] but there's an ultimate goal that you
[56:07] have now your ultimate goal maybe you
[56:09] you at your age you may say well my goal
[56:10] is to grow up and get married and have a
[56:12] job and and all these things that's
[56:13] that's fine that's a good goal for this
[56:15] life but that is not your ultimate goal
[56:18] your ultimate goal is to make a Rapture
[56:20] can you say Amen your ultimate goal is
[56:22] to have a body change your ultimate goal
[56:25] is to get out of this world and go to a

[56:54] lose the promise of a body change if

[57:00] Holy Ghost well I think that's something

[57:04] young people need to be on fire because

[59:50] goal what can the church say Amen if you
[59:53] keep your focus there is something for
[59:56] for you to attain but you cannot attain
[59:59] it by Falling to the side and following
[1:00:03] after distractions now in the Bible
[1:00:05] there is a uh there's a woman she's
[1:00:07] called the shunamite woman are you kids
[1:00:09] still awake I don't have any more
[1:00:11] football
[1:00:12] stories we might work on something else
[1:00:15] there's a shunamite woman and this woman
[1:00:18] had needed she wanted a son she wanted a
[1:00:20] child and so a prophet prayed for her
[1:00:24] and she had a son how many knows the
[1:00:25] story
[1:00:27] just a little bit okay well that's okay
[1:00:31] at least you're at least you're honest
[1:00:32] you know I like it I don't know that
[1:00:34] story my dad and mom don't teach me
[1:00:36] those
[1:00:42] things so so then then this little boy
[1:00:44] gets sick and he dies now this is a
[1:00:47] promised son that dies this is a this is
[1:00:50] a child that has been born and then he
[1:00:52] dies now now that that might that would
[1:00:55] shake some people's brother brandom
[1:00:56] actually talks about the father of this
[1:00:58] son pacing the floors and hollering and
[1:01:00] screaming and sad because the son had
[1:01:03] died he was gone but he said this woman
[1:01:05] never lost faith matter of fact when she
[1:01:08] oh come on somebody this woman never
[1:01:10] loses Faith she's not distracted by
[1:01:11] death she's not distracted she's not
[1:01:14] distracted by the things that are going
[1:01:16] wrong in her life but what well come on
[1:01:18] now if you're needing a child don't be
[1:01:20] distracted cuz it ain't here right when
[1:01:21] you need right when you want it don't be
[1:01:23] distracted there is a promise and that
[1:01:25] is is the goal hold to the promise I
[1:01:28] don't care what the distractions are the
[1:01:30] doctor May say you can't have
[1:01:33] them the doctor May say you can never
[1:01:35] have a child but God said you could have
[1:01:38] a child so hold on to that promise don't
[1:01:41] let the distractions of the doctor's
[1:01:44] opinions get in your
[1:01:46] way so Brother Talks he said uh the
[1:01:50] woman said go ask go ask if I shall
[1:01:52] speak to the chief captain and he goes
[1:01:54] on he said I'm going to try to skip this
[1:01:55] cuz time is going way faster than I
[1:01:57] expected he said I wonder if I could
[1:01:59] speak when I go before him when I'm
[1:02:00] called one of these people so G ha went
[1:02:02] and asked her and she said no she said I
[1:02:05] abide with my own people I don't have
[1:02:06] any reasons to ask things like that that
[1:02:08] was just out of my heart just because I
[1:02:10] know he's a man of God she wanted to go
[1:02:11] talk to the prophet and I want to show
[1:02:14] favor to him and that's all and and she
[1:02:16] come back and but her husband is old and
[1:02:17] they have no children now this is the
[1:02:18] promised son and Elijah must have saw a
[1:02:20] vision he said go tell her about the
[1:02:22] time of Life about a year from now
[1:02:23] she'll Embrace a child and she did and
[1:02:26] she had a little boy and this little boy
[1:02:28] brother bandham talks about him was
[1:02:29] about 12 years old and he was out in the
[1:02:31] field with his father and brother
[1:02:32] brandham says it may have been a sun
[1:02:34] stroke or a heat stroke because this
[1:02:36] little boy actually he he's he's out
[1:02:38] there in the field working he's actually
[1:02:39] working imagine you happed to work in a
[1:02:41] field but he's working and this this
[1:02:43] boy's Out In the Heat of the day and and
[1:02:45] it's hot he don't get to go inside in
[1:02:46] the AC because they probably didn't have
[1:02:48] air condition in the
[1:02:50] house it's true yeah they probably
[1:02:54] didn't have air conditioner in the house
[1:02:55] they couldn't go in and say I want I I
[1:02:56] want a popsicle and I want I want a
[1:02:59] glass of cold water no no these the this
[1:03:01] little boy had to work had to work
[1:03:03] that's foreign word to some of you isn't
[1:03:05] it it it to my kids anyway it's it had
[1:03:09] to work you know what the word work is
[1:03:11] you know what it means anybody know the
[1:03:12] definition of
[1:03:14] work nobody oh you do go tell
[1:03:22] me you're a banker son you don't know
[1:03:33] I'm sorry think about it though this
[1:03:35] little boy's working and he
[1:03:37] dies now we'd feel bad if we put our
[1:03:39] kids in a position where they died right
[1:03:41] we would as a parent you'd feel bad if
[1:03:43] you put your kid out there working hard
[1:03:44] and and
[1:03:46] and and they
[1:03:48] die Lord help me to get back on track
[1:03:51] and brother brandom said no breath in
[1:03:53] him he had died she took him and laid
[1:03:55] him
[1:03:56] upon Elijah's bed yeah now that's this
[1:03:58] woman had Faith you talk about a woman
[1:04:00] of Faith did this woman had Faith now
[1:04:02] and then she said to the servant saddle
[1:04:04] a mule and go forward and don't stop
[1:04:06] till I tell you because we want to go to
[1:04:08] the man of God this woman was not going
[1:04:10] to be distracted by death this woman was
[1:04:12] not going to be distracted by the fact
[1:04:14] that she was in a bad situation God had
[1:04:16] already give her the son come on
[1:04:18] somebody the promise had already been
[1:04:20] fulfilled she knew that if he could give
[1:04:23] her a son he could bring that son back
[1:04:25] to life life now this body gets cold
[1:04:27] this body gets stiff this and she goes
[1:04:31] and she doesn't stop and she said and
[1:04:33] and she goes there and God don't tell
[1:04:35] His prophets everything brother B says
[1:04:37] the prophet didn't even know why she was
[1:04:38] coming this was the woman's Faith this
[1:04:41] wasn't a prophet saying oh I already
[1:04:42] knew you was coming and I knew that boy
[1:04:44] was dead no no no the prophet didn't
[1:04:45] even know she was coming the the prophet
[1:04:48] didn't and and and said and and God has
[1:04:51] kept it from me I don't know what she
[1:04:52] wants and when she come and brother said
[1:04:55] I like this when she got up close to
[1:04:56] Elijah Elijah screamed out and said all
[1:04:58] is well with thee and she says and he
[1:05:02] says all is well with thy husband and
[1:05:04] notice the husband Walking the Floor
[1:05:06] screaming he didn't have the faith that
[1:05:07] she had and him just screaming and going
[1:05:09] on all the neighbors going on and the
[1:05:11] baby hours before that was laying cold

[1:07:49] distractor to try to get you off the
[1:07:51] path that leads to the great well come
[1:07:54] on somebody that leads to the ultimate
[1:07:56] goal you know the the goal you know it's
[1:07:59] going to come in such a way that there's
[1:08:01] going to be many church people that
[1:08:02] don't believe it'll ever happen there's
[1:08:05] going to be all kinds of of leosia
[1:08:07] church members that'll say well the
[1:08:08] Rapture is not really going to happen

[1:15:22] unto me the joy of Youth Camp right
[1:15:24] restore unto me what I had felt why

[1:15:31] everpresent God and he's here to send
[1:15:34] down His blessings even here
[1:15:37] tonight well can you say

[1:15:42] Napoleon any of you know about Napoleon
[1:15:44] I don't even want to ask that
[1:15:46] question do any of you go to
[1:15:53] school I'm going to give a prophet's
[1:15:56] version check it with the history books
[1:15:58] and he might have had lived I'm not sure
[1:16:01] cuz I don't know anything about
[1:16:03] it I didn't go to
[1:16:05] school we think of a conqueror Napoleon
[1:16:08] at the age of 33 he conquered the world
[1:16:11] he whipped Every Nation there was to be
[1:16:12] whipped he was so discouraged because
[1:16:15] there was nobody else to fight and he
[1:16:16] sat down and
[1:16:18] cried he wanted to fight and everybody
[1:16:21] was gone he' already defeated
[1:16:23] everybody and and he got got bored kind
[1:16:26] of like some of you look right now he
[1:16:27] got
[1:16:29] bored he got
[1:16:31] bored because there was nobody to fight
[1:16:33] imagine if you didn't have a brother to
[1:16:35] pick on to fight
[1:16:40] with I'm not talking to you girls I'm
[1:16:42] talking to these
[1:16:43] boys but imagine you get bored you're
[1:16:45] like I'm just sitting here Peter knows
[1:16:47] how it is he never got to beat up on
[1:16:49] nobody in his whole
[1:16:52] life I mean really you know and and and
[1:16:55] he was told no you can't hit the girls
[1:16:57] you can't do that well now you can't hit
[1:17:00] nobody you know cuz he who do I punch
[1:17:02] who do I hit I can't hit nobody I I'm
[1:17:04] bored I can't
[1:17:07] fight but he played the rules of the
[1:17:09] game unfair tens of thousands I
[1:17:12] shouldn't even read I'm going to skip
[1:17:13] this part because it does not go well
[1:17:15] with what I just said at the age of 33
[1:17:18] conquered the world but he was once
[1:17:20] prohibit prohib
[1:17:23] prohibition prohibit
[1:17:26] and you can PR pronounce that word
[1:17:27] yourself cuz I can't right now and he
[1:17:29] died an extreme alcoholic think about it
[1:17:33] this is a guy who conquered the world
[1:17:34] and he dies an alcoholic because he got
[1:17:36] bored he couldn't fight no more I've got
[1:17:39] a point here I think just just just let
[1:17:41] me get to it okay he said he forgot the
[1:17:44] message oh what did he what did he
[1:17:46] forget the message he had he had
[1:17:48] conquered the world but forgot the
[1:17:52] message like the little boy that run the
[1:17:54] race like like the church that is
[1:17:55] running today like the people that's
[1:17:57] running like the nation is running our
[1:17:58] refuge is not an atomic bombs our refuge
[1:18:00] is Jesus Christ and his resurrection
[1:18:03] Napoleon had forgot the main thing he
[1:18:06] had forgot and what happened to him he
[1:18:08] said he died totally defeated why he
[1:18:11] didn't play the game right though he had
[1:18:12] conquered the world physically he had
[1:18:14] prepared an army that was with with a
[1:18:15] military genius he took every nation and
[1:18:17] done the things that no other man could
[1:18:20] have ever done or ever did do but he
[1:18:23] forgot what the real message was was he
[1:18:25] had taken it and got his military
[1:18:27] strength but he forgot the strength of
[1:18:29] the Lord he he completely got distracted
[1:18:33] by this by by by the by the by the Army
[1:18:36] you you could get distracted by your job
[1:18:39] and have the most successful career out
[1:18:41] of anybody in the town of Hardy which is
[1:18:43] not very which is not much but you could
[1:18:46] have you could really be successful but
[1:18:48] if you miss the message you miss the
[1:18:51] main thing and it's nothing but a
[1:18:53] distraction to you
[1:18:55] your your worldly success is nothing if
[1:18:58] you miss the message your your well come

[1:19:12] the message has come to call you out of
[1:19:15] this world and make and help you reach
[1:19:18] the mark that you are pressing for but
[1:19:20] you will not make it on your own you

[1:19:32] we can fit in our suits next week and
[1:19:33] and we want to really fit you know we we
[1:19:35] want to get fit but listen that goal
[1:19:37] won't do you no good that goal will only
[1:19:39] keep you Earthbound that goal is only
[1:19:42] temporary but the goal that we are for
[1:19:45] we are going to is not just a temporary
[1:19:48] goal but it is an eternal being that we
[1:19:51] are trying to become we are getting out
[1:19:53] of this pest house
[1:19:55] anybody know what that
[1:19:56] is no you don't know what a pest house
[1:19:59] help me Lord I don't either it's what
[1:20:02] you're living
[1:20:03] in you know look at yourself in the
[1:20:05] mirror tomorrow and say that's a pest
[1:20:09] house you girls are like no I don't I
[1:20:12] don't think that of
[1:20:15] myself this is temporary did you know
[1:20:17] that you could live be 100 years old and
[1:20:19] you're still
[1:20:21] temporary yeah right you're temporary
[1:20:24] things that that's why we don't live for
[1:20:26] this this is just a
[1:20:29] distraction this this this this world is
[1:20:32] full of distraction do you realize
[1:20:33] everywhere you turn when you when you
[1:20:35] when you drive down a Scenic Highway you
[1:20:36] know why it's a Scenic Highway because
[1:20:38] you have to look at the distractions
[1:20:40] you're not supposed to look at the
[1:20:41] distraction you're supposed to look at
[1:20:42] the
[1:20:43] road it's a Scenic Highway why would you
[1:20:46] ever drive a scenic
[1:20:48] route if you're by yourself in the
[1:20:52] car come on somebody you could literally
[1:20:55] get a ticket for distracted driving just
[1:20:57] for driving on a scenic
[1:20:59] route every one of you could not you
[1:21:01] none of you
[1:21:04] drive think about it it's a distraction
[1:21:07] and it some people would call an
[1:21:09] attraction but it's actually a
[1:21:10] distraction if you drive out to you ever
[1:21:12] go to Tucson sometime you ever go out
[1:21:14] there you get to this place what's it
[1:21:15] called it's it's called a uh what is it
[1:21:18] it's it's a it's a what's that called
[1:21:20] it's a it's a museum it's a museum with
[1:21:23] a mummy in it oh and uh and it's it it
[1:21:26] has no the thing the thing it's it's
[1:21:30] that's that's not an attraction by the
[1:21:32] way that's a distraction if there ever
[1:21:33] was one there's nothing there it has no
[1:21:35] purpose it's it but it wants you to
[1:21:38] stop and and cost yourself 30 minutes
[1:21:40] from getting to Tucson to go through and
[1:21:43] find out there's a mummy in there maybe
[1:21:46] I I don't even know if I've ever seen it
[1:21:47] but I've went through there and it's a
[1:21:49] distraction the devil has got all kinds
[1:21:52] of little road shows set up
[1:21:55] just to try to stop you when you sit
[1:21:57] down to read your Bible young people
[1:21:59] listen to me for a minute when you sit
[1:22:01] down to read your Bible the devil's
[1:22:02] always saying well there's a movie on
[1:22:04] you could go watch or there's a TV show
[1:22:06] that you could watch instead and it's
[1:22:08] much more entertaining you're exactly
[1:22:09] right it is an attraction to the young
[1:22:11] it is an attraction to our age it is an
[1:22:13] attraction to our young people but it is
[1:22:16] a distraction from the things of God it
[1:22:18] is not it is not going to help you it is
[1:22:21] not going to do nothing for you it's
[1:22:22] going to get you it it might teach you
[1:22:24] some things you could you could sit down
[1:22:26] and listen I'm not against learning
[1:22:28] obviously I needed some of it but listen
[1:22:30] what what you've got to do is remember
[1:22:32] there is the main thing and the main
[1:22:35] thing is not what you learn here and not
[1:22:37] what you know here history's great and
[1:22:39] history's good and you can use it for
[1:22:41] all things in life and and math is good
[1:22:43] and and I was trying to teach Peter the
[1:22:45] other day how to read a tape measure and
[1:22:46] it was it would be good for him to learn
[1:22:48] how to read to take measure because if
[1:22:49] he's going to work with me he's got to
[1:22:50] learn how to read to take
[1:22:53] measure amen there's some things you
[1:22:55] have to learn here but it has nothing to
[1:22:57] do with your Eternal being you're you
[1:23:00] you you may become a doctor here and
[1:23:02] that is a successful thing to become but
[1:23:04] it will never affect whether you make it
[1:23:06] or
[1:23:08] not that's right you could you you you
[1:23:10] you could be a nobody or you could be a
[1:23:12] somebody and when you get there you're
[1:23:14] going to be the same the somebody and
[1:23:16] the nobody are still going to have to go
[1:23:18] through the same portal that anybody
[1:23:20] else is going to have to go through you
[1:23:22] say well I've made a million dollars and
[1:23:23] what have you made well I'll tell you I
[1:23:25] I wish I made the million dollars too
[1:23:27] but it's not going to help my soul any
[1:23:28] when we what I'm telling you is I'm not
[1:23:30] trying to tell you not to be successful
[1:23:32] you need to be successful you young
[1:23:34] people I you you need to have goals you
[1:23:36] need to focus and all these things those
[1:23:37] are wonderful things but I'm not here to
[1:23:39] tell you about finances tonight what I'm
[1:23:42] here you to tell I would be the wrong
[1:23:43] person to ask anyway but I would like to
[1:23:45] tell you tonight that what you need to
[1:23:47] focus on is getting back in the Bible
[1:23:50] again young people you young people that
[1:23:51] went to Camp get back on fire for God
[1:23:54] and don't let the devil distract you
[1:23:56] with things of the
[1:23:58] world I wonder if some of you Elder
[1:24:01] people if I could talk to you for a
[1:24:02] minute I wonder if you could go back to
[1:24:04] like it was when you first came to the
[1:24:05] message you could say well I I used to
[1:24:07] have joy I I used to feel really good in
[1:24:10] church I used to be able to worship like
[1:24:11] nobody well let me tell you something
[1:24:13] what happened it God didn't change the
[1:24:16] word didn't change come on somebody but
[1:24:20] what you need to do is go back to where
[1:24:21] you left that love and and quit being
[1:24:24] distracted well some people say well we
[1:24:26] used to have it so good that you know
[1:24:28] the past can be a
[1:24:30] distraction that's right you know a good
[1:24:32] preacher can be a distraction that's why
[1:24:34] I've chose not to be
[1:24:39] one I don't want to distract you you
[1:24:41] know from the main thing don't want to
[1:24:44] be good-looking and good preacher like
[1:24:45] brother Ben because then you'd be
[1:24:48] distracted I completely lost my
[1:24:52] spot I want to say this you'll defend
[1:24:54] your rights as an American you'll defend
[1:24:57] your rights to a good
[1:24:59] career but you lose focus on going back
[1:25:02] to church and really getting in touch
[1:25:04] with God
[1:25:05] again there's a story I heard and I'll
[1:25:08] mess it up because I'm not a good story
[1:25:09] Storyteller either I'm not really good
[1:25:11] at anything actually but here I am so
[1:25:14] there's a story I heard by another
[1:25:16] preacher and uh he he said it and he and
[1:25:20] he said there was a successful man and
[1:25:23] there was this man that asked him how do
[1:25:24] you be successful how how can you be
[1:25:26] successful he said well he said uh if
[1:25:28] you want to be successful meet me in the
[1:25:30] morning out here at the beach and I'll
[1:25:31] tell you how to be successful and so he
[1:25:34] got out to the beach the next morning
[1:25:36] and and uh the successful man's standing
[1:25:39] out there and he says now come in ankle
[1:25:41] deep and so the man does and he says
[1:25:42] what's this got to do what how's this
[1:25:44] going to make me successful I didn't
[1:25:45] come to to swim I come to be successful
[1:25:48] so he says well come out a little
[1:25:49] farther you want to be successful come
[1:25:50] out a little farther I said well I out
[1:25:51] to waste next thing you know he's got
[1:25:53] water up to his neck and the successful
[1:25:55] man reaches over and puts him under the
[1:25:56] water and holds him down till he starts
[1:25:59] bubbling gets water in his lungs and he
[1:26:02] LS the man up and the man comes up and
[1:26:04] the the successful man ask him what were
[1:26:07] you thinking of he said just trying to
[1:26:08] get a breath he said when you want to be
[1:26:10] successful as bad as you wanted that
[1:26:12] next breath then you'll be successful
[1:26:15] now if you want what God has for you as
[1:26:18] bad as you want your next breath then
[1:26:21] then I tell you what nothing can stop
[1:26:22] you the devil can't stop you from
[1:26:24] getting all that God's got for you but
[1:26:26] you've got to want it you've got to have
[1:26:28] a desire one thing have I desired of the
[1:26:31] Lord and that will I seek after that
[1:26:34] thing will I seek after that I may
[1:26:36] inquire of the Lord that I may be in his
[1:26:38] Temple well come on somebody I want to
[1:26:40] dwell in the house of the Lord I don't
[1:26:42] want to stay here in this pest house I
[1:26:45] don't want to stay here in this
[1:26:47] Earthbound vessel but I want to move on
[1:26:50] to the ultimate goal in a Rapture that
[1:26:52] God has for you you know you young
[1:26:54] people I believe you're the generation
[1:26:56] that's going to not I don't believe
[1:26:57] you're going to taste death I believe
[1:26:58] you're going to see God coming in the
[1:27:00] Clouds Of Glory I believe he's going to
[1:27:01] come after you and there's going to be a
[1:27:03] change come over you and you're going to
[1:27:05] start seeing loved ones uh you may be
[1:27:07] now you may be when you're teenagers but
[1:27:09] think about it when you get a little
[1:27:10] older some of you younger younger people
[1:27:12] listen don't be scared of a Rapture that
[1:27:14] is what your goal is don't be scared of
[1:27:16] a body change that's your goal don't be
[1:27:19] scared of of going to the afterlife that
[1:27:21] is what we're here for we're not here to
[1:27:23] build kingdoms here on this Earth we're
[1:27:25] not here to say well well this is all
[1:27:28] I've got this is no I don't want to be a
[1:27:30] miserable person in this life only but I
[1:27:32] have a hope that there is another land
[1:27:36] and you're going to go to it I tell you
[1:27:38] what we're not going to leave one behind
[1:27:39] are we come on don't leave me
[1:27:42] hanging yall are
[1:27:44] awful come on you're all going we're not
[1:27:49] going to leave you here why because we
[1:27:50] are determined to hold the token over
[1:27:53] our children
[1:27:54] parents can say Amen to that you're
[1:27:56] determined to hold the token over these
[1:27:58] children I I tell you what they may they
[1:28:00] may try they may try to depart from it
[1:28:01] but they cannot depart from the love of
[1:28:03] God that's in their life they cannot
[1:28:05] depart from the seed that has been
[1:28:07] planted on the inside because when God
[1:28:10] strikes that seed they can't help but
[1:28:12] come forth as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:15] they can't help but fall in love with
[1:28:16] god well I hope somebody's hear me
[1:28:18] tonight you say well that's too simple
[1:28:20] if I could leave you with one thing I'd
[1:28:21] say don't look at the distraction but
[1:28:24] look at the prize at the end of The
[1:28:27] Journey because it will be worth it all
[1:28:29] it will be worth everything when we
[1:28:31] actually see him face to face he who we
[1:28:34] loved he who we love well come on
[1:28:36] somebody I love is appearing I want to
[1:28:38] see him brother excuse me 1 Timothy 69
[1:28:42] uh 612 says it like this fight the good
[1:28:44] fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life
[1:28:47] where unto Thou Art also called and H
[1:28:50] has professed a good profession before
[1:28:52] many witnesses we didn't do this in a
[1:28:55] closet we don't do this setting at home
[1:28:57] but before many witnesses we're going to
[1:28:59] fight this fight before many witnesses
[1:29:01] we're going to lay hold on the faith of
[1:29:03] God and say you know what if it's an
[1:29:05] altar experience I need then I'll go to
[1:29:07] the altar right you know sometimes if
[1:29:10] you wanted to go to an altar as bad as
[1:29:11] you wanted a movie we couldn't keep you
[1:29:13] back did you know that you probably need
[1:29:15] an altar more than you need a movie
[1:29:17] right but I'd hate to ask you how many
[1:29:18] times you watch a movie every
[1:29:21] day come on but think about it
[1:29:25] if you'll ever listen there's a voice on
[1:29:27] the inside of you not the one I've got
[1:29:29] that talks to you I talk to myself not
[1:29:31] that kind but there's a voice there's a
[1:29:34] voice on the inside of every you that's
[1:29:36] every one of you that's calling you
[1:29:38] that's calling
[1:29:39] you to do something but you have got to
[1:29:43] yield to that voice and when you're
[1:29:45] distracted you can't hear the voice of
[1:29:48] God well come on somebody the world has
[1:29:51] tried to drown out the voice of God with
[1:29:54] distractions the world has tried to get
[1:29:57] your attention now I'm not saying
[1:29:59] anything against Sports because I use
[1:30:00] Sports as an illustration but what what
[1:30:02] I'm saying is that's just a distraction
[1:30:04] in the grand scheme of things that's
[1:30:06] just a distraction because you think
[1:30:08] about every time you pulled up the ESPN
[1:30:09] app to check what your team standing was
[1:30:12] in baseball if you if you read if you
[1:30:14] just replace that with a couple Bible
[1:30:16] chapters right well it got quiet you
[1:30:20] kids don't know what ESPN app is well I
[1:30:22] tell you it's a thing you get addicted
[1:30:23] to when you're about 45 years
[1:30:27] old middle-aged people that have nothing
[1:30:29] to do and they're not retired but they
[1:30:32] get home and you kids are all grown up
[1:30:33] and out of the house and they're sitting
[1:30:35] there and their wife's cooking and
[1:30:36] they're sitting there what do I do I
[1:30:37] don't know what to do so they pull up
[1:30:39] ESPN and all my team's horrible they're
[1:30:41] at the bottom of the division the
[1:30:42] Cardinals I'm talking about they're just
[1:30:43] awful and and they're just just horrible
[1:30:45] and the Cubs are bad too brother Joe and
[1:30:47] they're just so bad and uh they're
[1:30:50] really bad actually but they uh but the
[1:30:53] Brewers at the top of the standing you
[1:30:54] look at all these things and you realize
[1:30:56] if I would have just read a scripture
[1:30:58] instead of finding out how bad my team
[1:31:00] was I would have actually benefited
[1:31:02] myself instead of depressing myself it's
[1:31:06] a distraction now I'm about ready to
[1:31:08] close but I want to tell you
[1:31:10] this there these are all things some
[1:31:12] good things can distract you I'm going
[1:31:14] to say this and I'm going to close I've
[1:31:15] got a minute and 12 seconds
[1:31:17] left relationships can be a distraction
[1:31:20] sorry sorry buddy relationships can be a
[1:31:23] distraction
[1:31:25] I'll say it one more time relationships
[1:31:27] can be a
[1:31:28] distraction if you just got on fire for
[1:31:31] God and then and your next goal is well
[1:31:33] I just need a boyfriend girlfriend no
[1:31:34] that that's not exactly what you need to
[1:31:36] be looking for what you need to focus on
[1:31:38] is I need to make sure that I've really
[1:31:40] got the Holy Ghost before you ever start
[1:31:42] dating somebody you need to make sure
[1:31:43] you got the Holy Ghost can you say
[1:31:46] Amen friends can be a distraction that's
[1:31:49] why it's important who you hang out with
[1:31:52] right that's right good friends are are
[1:31:55] good good friends can be can be a good
[1:31:57] thing good friends can help you bad
[1:32:00] friends are such a distraction because
[1:32:02] what it is they may be good people but
[1:32:05] if they don't hold your values they are
[1:32:06] a distraction to
[1:32:09] you can you say
[1:32:12] Amen drama in your
[1:32:14] life drama is a distraction some people
[1:32:17] say well I'm just a dramatic person well
[1:32:19] you you might be but that's sometimes
[1:32:21] just a distraction
[1:32:24] brother R says like this and and I'm I'm
[1:32:26] I'm closing with this
[1:32:27] quote every one of you people who
[1:32:30] profess to be Christians get yourself
[1:32:32] quiet before
[1:32:34] him don't let the washing hinder don't
[1:32:37] let the work hinder don't let nothing
[1:32:40] hinder now when he says nothing that
[1:32:42] gives us the ability to put whatever we
[1:32:44] want that would hinder us and distract
[1:32:46] Us in there don't let nothing distract
[1:32:50] you that's right from getting alone with
[1:32:53] God
[1:32:55] I know I've just been all over the place
[1:32:56] today but I wanted you young people can
[1:32:58] you just pay attention for like two more
[1:32:59] minutes I've got 30 seconds left but two
[1:33:02] minutes
[1:33:03] okay don't let nobody know what you're
[1:33:06] doing just go somewhere get outside or
[1:33:08] go into the secret closet you young
[1:33:10] people can do this did you know that
[1:33:13] hello did you know that did you know
[1:33:16] that you can pray at your age and get
[1:33:19] alone with
[1:33:21] God going to the secret CL it when the
[1:33:24] kids gets at school now this is for you
[1:33:26] adults here because I wonder if
[1:33:29] sometimes I'm guilty of this by the way
[1:33:32] I wonder if sometimes our kids don't see
[1:33:33] us praying enough and they don't really
[1:33:35] know what prayer life
[1:33:38] is on it got kind of somber there for a
[1:33:41] minute but that's because a lot of us I
[1:33:42] think are in the same boat our kids
[1:33:44] don't ever see what it's like to really
[1:33:47] oh my dad's got a real prayer life
[1:33:49] because I've seen him go get quiet I've
[1:33:50] heard him pray before the Lord I I I've
[1:33:53] I've seen it
[1:33:54] well come on somebody say well I'm
[1:33:56] guilty well you can say Amen or ohe me
[1:33:57] it doesn't matter but but one one thing
[1:33:59] for sure is we're all guilty of not
[1:34:01] praying
[1:34:03] enough I can stand up here and talk too
[1:34:05] much but we can never pray too much
[1:34:07] that's right he said go to the secret
[1:34:09] closet get on on your knees you've heard
[1:34:11] all kinds of voices everywhere but just
[1:34:13] get down and stay there until those
[1:34:15] voices are silenced and you begin to
[1:34:17] lift up it'll change you it'll make you
[1:34:19] different like it did Samuel it'll do
[1:34:21] something to you if you'll just do it
[1:34:23] now it'll make you what you should be
[1:34:25] it'll make you the kind of Christian
[1:34:27] that you ought to be can you young
[1:34:28] people say amen to
[1:34:30] that you want to be a good
[1:34:33] Christian you want to be an overcomer
[1:34:35] and not distracted you've got to
[1:34:38] pray as the musicians would
[1:34:41] come I I just want to hit these real
[1:34:43] quick false teachers can be a
[1:34:45] distraction you can hear something on
[1:34:47] the Internet that's just a distraction
[1:34:48] to get you from the real
[1:34:50] thing there could be gifts that could be
[1:34:52] wrong and they could be a distraction to
[1:34:53] try to get you out of
[1:34:56] church friends are a distraction the
[1:34:58] past some of you Elders listen to me the
[1:35:00] past is just a distraction sometimes oh
[1:35:03] there's wonderful things in the past and
[1:35:04] maybe you need to go back to where you
[1:35:05] left maybe you need to go back to where
[1:35:07] you left something and repent and come
[1:35:08] back but but don't stay in the past
[1:35:10] because it's just a distraction if you
[1:35:12] look in the rearview mirror long enough
[1:35:13] it just becomes a
[1:35:16] distraction how many of you's ever been
[1:35:18] distracted from an Altra
[1:35:20] call anybody just me
[1:35:26] I've wanted to be at an altar how old
[1:35:29] how old are you
[1:35:30] Jared 11 I was about 9ine or 10 and I
[1:35:34] remember I went to an altar and I got
[1:35:37] distracted because they closed the
[1:35:38] service on me just like that they closed
[1:35:41] it they they just they went to a fast
[1:35:42] song and then I completely lost I I the
[1:35:45] desire to be at the altar left
[1:35:47] me now I say that because it's up to us
[1:35:52] musicians and song leaders we want to
[1:35:54] create an atmosphere where you feel like
[1:35:56] you should be there but don't don't get
[1:36:00] distracted if you need to be at the
[1:36:02] altar don't get distracted by something
[1:36:03] that makes you get up it took me a whole
[1:36:05] year year and a half more before I ever
[1:36:07] felt to go back to an altar again you
[1:36:08] say what good is an altar do I'm going
[1:36:10] to tell you there's a lot of us that
[1:36:11] started an
[1:36:12] altar well can can anybody here say Amen
[1:36:15] to that some there's been a bunch of you
[1:36:18] here tonight that started at an altar
[1:36:19] and then you want to get rid of altars
[1:36:21] in the church come on I say our kids
[1:36:24] need to be welcome to the altars again
[1:36:27] make altars great
[1:36:28] again bring altars back in the church

[1:36:32] people feel welcome to an altar let
[1:36:34] young well sometimes you old people
[1:36:36] excuse me for this but sometimes you
[1:36:38] need to feel welcome back to an altar
[1:36:40] again sometimes you need to show our
[1:36:42] young people it ain't wrong to get down
[1:36:44] there and cry and snot and look just
[1:36:48] awful at an altar anymore why because we
[1:36:50] made such a form of godliness out of
[1:36:53] this thing that we're scared to get
[1:36:55] messy but a birth is a mess and if our
[1:36:59] young people got to get messy to have a
[1:37:01] birth I say let them get messy I say let
[1:37:03] them get down with God I say let our
[1:37:06] young people get on fire for God again I
[1:37:09] say let the young people don't lose what
[1:37:11] you got at Youth Camp but get back on
[1:37:13] fire for God again let God move upon you
[1:37:17] I I I think we need to do that I say
[1:37:19] don't let nothing hinder you don't you
[1:37:21] you start feeling a cold formal Spirit
[1:37:23] come among us I say don't let that
[1:37:24] hinder you from what you feel God moving
[1:37:26] in your heart to do don't let anything
[1:37:29] hinder you well come on somebody I I I
[1:37:32] think you need to watch your friends I
[1:37:33] think you need to watch those
[1:37:34] relationships make sure the devil's not
[1:37:37] in there using those things to distract
[1:37:40] you from your full potential in the
[1:37:42] house of God stand to your feet if you
[1:37:46] would I want to live the way he wants me
[1:37:49] to live can we do that one I I wonder
[1:37:52] you young people I don't want to make
[1:37:53] altar calls every time we have a youth
[1:37:54] service but I want you to know that if
[1:37:56] there's a desire in your heart to go to
[1:37:58] an altar you need to be at that
[1:38:01] altar well we don't have time you've
[1:38:03] always got time for the main thing oh
[1:38:05] yeah we may not always have time for
[1:38:07] work we may not always have time for the
[1:38:09] things of the world we may not always
[1:38:11] have time for vacation but we've got
[1:38:13] time for the main thing eternity awaits
[1:38:16] you you've got to youve got to let the
[1:38:19] main thing be the main
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:22] thing we're not we're not here to play
[1:38:25] Church we're not here just to have
[1:38:27] another Services check a box we had
[1:38:30] three services this week that's not the
[1:38:31] goal the goal is to see a young oh come
[1:38:34] on somebody the goal is to see somebody
[1:38:37] here when a Rapture takes place that is
[1:38:40] ready to meet him when he
[1:38:42] comes whatever that takes whatever it
[1:38:45] takes if it takes getting myself out of
[1:38:48] the way if it takes getting yourself out
[1:38:50] of the way parents if it takes you
[1:38:53] getting back on your knees in an altar
[1:38:54] again if it takes you getting yourself
[1:38:57] out of the way again I say don't let the
[1:38:59] distractions hinder our children from
[1:39:02] getting their blessings in the house of
[1:39:05] God the devil's a
[1:39:07] distractor but don't miss the
[1:39:10] attraction this attraction is not
[1:39:12] something that the the devil put on the
[1:39:14] side of the road but this is this is the
[1:39:16] goal at the end of the
[1:39:18] season you're in a season at the end of
[1:39:22] this long ruing hard
[1:39:26] season when you've played every down and
[1:39:29] you're beat and you're battered and
[1:39:32] you're
[1:39:33] hurt and you get down there and you hold
[1:39:35] the trophy it will be worth it all
[1:39:38] then it's worth it all when you get to
[1:39:41] the
[1:39:41] end see along the way it's just
[1:39:45] distractions just little things here a
[1:39:47] little things there but at the end is
[1:39:50] that's where it all matters so I want
[1:39:52] you to sing this
[1:39:54] and I want you young people to think
[1:39:56] about it do you want to live like he
[1:39:59] wants you to
[1:40:00] live do you want to love like he wants
[1:40:03] you to
[1:40:04] love put God first ahead of your friends

[1:40:32] not I wish somebody would just please
[1:40:34] the Lord and worship him because he
[1:40:37] deserves the glory he deserves the honor
[1:40:41] when you get down to the end and you're
[1:40:42] holding that trophy it's not about what
[1:40:44] I did it's not about what you did it's
[1:40:48] about what he did for you his Mercy his
[1:40:51] grace has brought you safe this far and
[1:40:54] Grace will lead you home if you make it
