[47:51] way and just talk to him this morning

[49:00] think it's it's pretty rare that we get
[49:01] most of us in church I know the birie
[49:03] family I think he's working today and
[49:05] and but Jeremy's working and different
[49:07] ones but it's still good to see the
[49:09] majority of the church out on a Sunday
[49:10] morning and it's been the weather's been
[49:12] so bad that uh it just seems like uh uh
[49:17] it it be hard to have church and then
[49:19] the Lord just made give us a beautiful
[49:21] day today to have church and we're
[49:23] thankful to be here today I'll if we
[49:24] have any visitors but Lucas I see you

[49:28] but God bless you I'm sure sister
[49:30] Ashley's here somewhere so taking care
[49:32] of one of those 11
[49:35] children so it's good to have you with
[49:38] us it's good to be in the house of the
[49:40] Lord isn't it yes amen Luke
[49:43] 11:21 says when a strong man armed
[49:47] keepeth his Palace his goods are in
[49:51] peace but when a stronger than he shall
[49:55] come upon him and overcome him he taketh
[49:59] from him all his armor wherein he
[50:01] trusted and divideth his spoils pray the
[50:05] Lord would add his Blessing to the
[50:07] reading of the word you may be seated
[50:08] this morning I want to speak to you this
[50:11] morning on the stronger man's house the
[50:15] stronger man's
[50:16] house when Jesus came the first time he
[50:21] uh came to a world where the established
[50:23] religions had become very denominational
[50:26] in their thinking
[50:27] very organized they had not had uh any
[50:30] Supernatural among them for many many
[50:33] years in fact it had been 400 years
[50:36] since they'd had a prophet and so they
[50:38] were very uh organized the way they
[50:41] thought about the Lord was very it was
[50:44] very much had to do with intellect and
[50:46] very little to do with the supernatural
[50:49] power of God and so when he came to that
[50:53] country place where they were uh they
[50:56] didn't even think think about God
[50:57] anymore uh so much as a miracle working
[51:00] God yeah he did things in the past but
[51:03] those days were long gone it it was many
[51:05] many years many decades many even
[51:09] centuries ago that God had done those
[51:11] things and so when things began to
[51:13] happen in Jesus Ministry they realized
[51:16] there was something going on and and and
[51:19] they interpreted it in different ways
[51:20] they had to account for it and so the
[51:23] people there some thought he was crazy
[51:26] in fact Jesus own family thought he was
[51:28] crazy now for all of you who maybe your
[51:31] family thinks you're crazy today and why
[51:33] do you believe the message why do you
[51:35] believe in miracles why do you believe
[51:37] that God still raises the dead and heals
[51:40] the sick and and does the things for us
[51:42] why do you believe that today well and
[51:45] they may think you're crazy they may say
[51:47] well you've gone off your rocker you're
[51:48] beside yourself well they thought the
[51:50] same thing of him in Mark 3:21 it says
[51:53] when his friends heard of it and that
[51:56] word friends is actually his family or
[51:58] those on his side of the family heard of
[52:00] it they went out to lay hold on him they
[52:03] actually went to Stage an intervention
[52:06] on
[52:07] Jesus right they they start talking
[52:09] about it around the dinner table you
[52:11] know you know Jesus has been doing some
[52:13] strange things he left the carpentry
[52:15] shop at 30 years old and he began to he
[52:18] began to preach and he began to teach
[52:20] and and and and people my goodness them
[52:22] people get wild down there there a bunch
[52:24] of holy rollers and and there saying
[52:26] things about people getting healed and
[52:28] people getting saved and and things
[52:30] happen and people getting baptized he's
[52:32] gone crazy just like his cousin you know
[52:34] old John the Baptist said we got to do
[52:36] something about it and so they actually
[52:38] go down to lay hold on him right they're
[52:41] going to physically try to take him and
[52:43] put him in an institution somewhere
[52:45] whatever the the the equivalent of that
[52:48] was at the time because they did not
[52:50] understand the supernatural they said
[52:52] he's crazy they still think that today
[52:54] any Christian is going to be seen as
[52:56] crazy by the world any real believer is
[52:58] going to be told that they're crazy by
[53:00] the world but I don't care what the
[53:01] world thinks today but I care what he
[53:04] thinks so they still think it's crazy
[53:07] they thought Paul was crazy they said
[53:10] Paul you're beside yourself in Acts 26
[53:12] it said much learning has made you
[53:14] insane it thought brother Brandon was
[53:16] beside
[53:17] himself in uh brother brand says this
[53:19] about his own family he said I remember
[53:21] the time when the angel of the Lord came
[53:23] and told me go pray for sick people and
[53:25] a great friend of mine the denomination
[53:27] I belonged to said Billy you're going to
[53:29] be a Holy Roller as sure as the
[53:31] world and my mother
[53:35] said now listen it's not always going to
[53:37] be easy when it comes to family it's not
[53:40] always going to be easy to get them to
[53:42] understand I'm a Believer now mama I
[53:43] don't cut my hair no more I don't wear
[53:45] those pants no more I don't wear that
[53:46] makeup no more and it's hard to get them
[53:48] to understand why you don't do those
[53:50] things and why it's going well they'll
[53:52] think you're crazy but they thought he
[53:53] was crazy and and he said my mother said
[53:57] why Billy you've lost your mind my poor
[54:00] old dad that died on my arm said Billy
[54:02] you can't bring that stuff around this
[54:03] house here they thought I was
[54:06] crazy oh my I'm glad he didn't give into
[54:09] to that thought he said I was a single
[54:12] man he said my girlfriends that I've
[54:14] been going with they thought I was crazy
[54:17] but I knew something happened yeah I
[54:19] knew that I could trust him amen you
[54:22] know you can trust him today he said no
[54:24] matter what taking place I believed him
[54:27] and you have to believe him listen when
[54:29] you follow Christ you'll be called crazy
[54:32] what we have is the mind of Christ
[54:34] listen to me this morning if crazy is
[54:36] love and joy and peace and gentleness
[54:39] and and kindness and Assurance I'll take
[54:41] that over all the chemically induced
[54:43] things folks have today I'll take crazy
[54:45] over that whatever they got I don't want
[54:48] I don't want what the world's got where
[54:49] they have to medicate themselves with
[54:50] alcohol and everything else to have you
[54:52] and have a peace of mind but I want to
[54:54] see I want God to move I want to be in
[54:56] the presence of God they can call it
[54:58] crazy all they want to I know there's
[55:00] churches in the message that don't
[55:01] believe in a move of the Holy Ghost
[55:02] anymore but I I'd rather be there let my
[55:05] mind be soothed by that than by things
[55:08] of the world you know people tell you
[55:10] say well you don't need emotion anymore
[55:12] and that's true you don't need emotion
[55:14] at all you should just take God's word
[55:16] for it but we're human
[55:19] beings right we're human beings and and
[55:22] when you care about something it shows
[55:25] right when when something happens to you
[55:27] and you get a revelation of what God's
[55:29] done for you it'll show on your face
[55:31] it'll show as we preach about Judah with
[55:33] the lifting up of your hands and and the
[55:35] Cry of your voice it'll show somewhere
[55:38] you care about what you're saying it's
[55:40] going to come out in a passion in your
[55:41] voice in your
[55:43] heart right oh my yeah we don't need
[55:46] emotions that's not what we base our
[55:48] religion on WE base it on the word
[55:50] you're healed not because you feel like
[55:52] it but because God said so you're saved
[55:54] not because you feel like it but because
[55:56] God said so but I'd rather be called
[55:58] crazy and enjoy my religion than have to
[56:01] put up with whatever they put up with
[56:02] all right
[56:04] yes good now in Mark
[56:09] 3 the devil work on you man you'll
[56:11] either you'll either enjoy Christ or the
[56:14] devil will come in and try to get you to
[56:17] enjoy something else you're going to
[56:20] enjoy something you're going to find
[56:22] peace
[56:23] somewhere you're going to find somewhere
[56:26] to make to cause a care you know brother
[56:29] man preaches he carth for you he said
[56:32] you're going to find somebody to care
[56:34] but he's the one that really cares
[56:37] rather take him anything else in Mark
[56:40] chap 3 and: 22 that's just a background
[56:43] for where we want to go so they're
[56:45] saying that these things maybe he's
[56:47] crazy and so the scribes and the
[56:49] Pharisees they realize well he's not
[56:51] insane but maybe it's a
[56:53] devil right that's how they try to
[56:55] explain it and the scribes in Mark 3:22
[56:58] which came down from Jerusalem said he
[57:00] hath be elub and by the prince of the
[57:02] Devils casteth he out devils and he
[57:04] called them unto him and said unto them
[57:06] in Parables how can Satan cast out
[57:09] Satan and if a kingdom be divided
[57:12] against itself that Kingdom cannot stand
[57:16] and if a house be divided against itself
[57:18] that house cannot stand there a great
[57:20] lesson here I don't have time to go into
[57:22] this morning but of a church if a church
[57:24] is divided against itself and can't
[57:26] stand right if a family is divided
[57:29] against itself it can't stand you got to
[57:31] be on the same page and if Satan rise up
[57:34] against himself and be divided he cannot
[57:36] stand but hath an end yeah I like that
[57:39] hath an end
[57:41] now he then presents Satan as a powerful
[57:45] man you'll find this in Matthew and Mark
[57:47] and in
[57:48] Luke he presents Satan as a powerful man
[57:52] in his home or or in his Palace
[57:56] and so if we had a a strong man one one
[58:01] of you kids which one of you is strong
[58:03] you young man strong real
[58:07] strong I got some raising their hands
[58:09] but they're doing it like is you
[58:13] know real strong I got strong men up
[58:16] here uh Wyatt you make come
[58:19] here he pointing to somebody else Jason
[58:22] come here
[58:25] [Music]
[58:27] I don't know buddy you're a preacher's
[58:31] kid all right uh this is a strong
[58:36] man are you a strong man very doubtful
[58:39] very doubtful he
[58:40] says I got one that don't cooperate
[58:43] right here so this is a strong man right
[58:46] he's a strong man and to some of these
[58:48] other boys maybe to Wyatt I don't know I
[58:50] think Whitey beats up on him
[58:52] but he he's a strong man some of these
[58:55] girls name m boy here's a strong man
[58:57] with muscle as you
[59:00] know he's a strong man where's trip
[59:04] at are you in the back trip come on
[59:07] buddy I need
[59:10] you this is a strong man right but he
[59:13] he's he's not he he's able to as long as
[59:16] the as long as his opponents are of
[59:19] equivalent
[59:21] size right I'm trying to make it where
[59:24] you'll understand it church where you
[59:25] it'll stick with you as long as his
[59:27] opponent is of equivalent size he will
[59:31] actually uh be able to keep the things
[59:35] in his house so he's he's armed himself
[59:39] he has he has he's protecting his Goods
[59:42] trip where did you
[59:44] go he's able to to do that and uh he
[59:49] he's able to keep his house he's able to
[59:51] protect what's his right so so you're
[59:54] the strong man now be
[59:56] strong there you go it's a strong man
[1:00:00] but when Jesus come on the scene what
[1:00:03] happened was a stronger man
[1:00:06] came
[1:00:08] right so if Jason is trying to keep
[1:00:10] what's
[1:00:12] his and trip wants it right now I don't
[1:00:15] know if you got anything he wants but
[1:00:16] you better be
[1:00:18] careful but if trip wants it he can take
[1:00:21] it that makes s now that's no but he's
[1:00:24] just a stronger man right he's another
[1:00:26] he's on another level that's right he's
[1:00:28] in another class now do you understand
[1:00:30] when Jesus come along it was like this
[1:00:32] man was there and he he was enjoying
[1:00:35] himself he could take whatever control
[1:00:37] he could put in disease he wanted to on
[1:00:38] the people he could fill their minds
[1:00:40] with hate and and fear and everything
[1:00:43] else it was a strong man that had
[1:00:44] control of the world but a stronger man
[1:00:46] come along and when the stronger man
[1:00:49] came in he said that's how the Devils
[1:00:51] were cast out thank you guys give him a
[1:00:54] hand
[1:00:56] oh my can you
[1:00:58] imagine you imagine him trying the
[1:01:00] strong man can't keep his Goods anymore
[1:01:03] and many times we give too much credit
[1:01:05] to the devil cuz what happened in the
[1:01:07] strong man yeah he's strong yeah he can
[1:01:09] do many things and cause great fears and
[1:01:12] anxieties and things but the stronger
[1:01:14] man has come down and come into our age
[1:01:17] and he's standing there casting out the
[1:01:19] strong man because he's the stronger man
[1:01:23] are you with me now so now where is how
[1:01:26] Satan had the house yeah he had control
[1:01:31] of the house he had control of my house
[1:01:33] and your house we were all born in sin
[1:01:35] shapen in iniquity com to the world
[1:01:37] speaking lies the strong man and he
[1:01:40] armed himself with with hate and fear
[1:01:42] and hypocrisy and drugs and alcohol and
[1:01:45] he armed himself on right he armed
[1:01:48] himself with evil thoughts and
[1:01:49] everything else that was the he was the
[1:01:51] strong man yeah but he said the stronger
[1:01:54] man come along one day what happened to
[1:01:56] you listen to me Church you don't have
[1:01:59] to be
[1:02:00] bound you don't have to live your life
[1:02:02] under a curse you don't have to live
[1:02:05] your life under depression you don't
[1:02:07] have to live under fear you don't have
[1:02:09] to live under a pornography devil you
[1:02:11] don't have to live under that thing you
[1:02:13] say well I can't just overcome it yes
[1:02:14] you can it's not you but it's the
[1:02:16] stronger man has come by what happened
[1:02:19] to you what happened to all of us that
[1:02:21] have lived for a while the stronger man
[1:02:23] came in the stronger man came in we were
[1:02:26] just like everybody else Bound by all
[1:02:27] the things that LE to is bound by I know
[1:02:30] some of you drank and smoked and and and
[1:02:32] and and carried on with women and
[1:02:34] everything else but yet you the stronger
[1:02:36] man come by one day and when he come by
[1:02:38] everything
[1:02:43] changed oh
[1:02:45] Hallelujah don't don't make excuses for
[1:02:48] it let the stronger man come by he say
[1:02:51] well if I could just feel him coming by
[1:02:53] yeah I believe that's that's possible
[1:02:55] but who is the strong man he was the
[1:02:58] word the strong man was the word in
[1:03:00] flesh yeah that come by your way when
[1:03:04] the word came all the other things have
[1:03:06] to leave amen said well I can never be
[1:03:09] different I can never cast out these
[1:03:11] things these thoughts these tormenting
[1:03:12] thoughts this depression this trouble
[1:03:15] let the stronger man come by you were
[1:03:18] the strong man's house but when the
[1:03:21] stronger one stronger than he comes he
[1:03:24] binds the strong man
[1:03:26] and spoils his
[1:03:28] Goods Hallelujah he spoiled cigarettes
[1:03:32] he spoiled alcohol he spoiled all of
[1:03:34] that made a show of it openly the Bible
[1:03:36] says and comes back the mighty conqueror
[1:03:39] yes aren't you glad he's still the
[1:03:41] strong stronger man
[1:03:43] today oh my now look he says he'll he'll
[1:03:47] bind the strong man and spoil his house
[1:03:49] again the strong man has possession he's
[1:03:51] armed he will not cast himself out right
[1:03:55] because the house divided against itself
[1:03:57] would not fall would fall but he he he's
[1:04:00] entrenched in there we know that demons
[1:04:02] do make war and fight but they don't
[1:04:05] cast one another out they simply wreak
[1:04:07] havoc in the Earthly realm right they
[1:04:10] actually that demon is still there that
[1:04:12] American demon fights with the British
[1:04:14] demon and the German demon and brandom
[1:04:17] explained that how that he was over all
[1:04:18] the kingdoms of the world and they fight
[1:04:20] with one another right they can't even
[1:04:22] get along with themselves but yet they
[1:04:24] cannot cast each other out out only God
[1:04:27] can do that because they're they're not
[1:04:30] the stronger
[1:04:32] man Hallelujah there's only one and
[1:04:35] church we can look at Psychology you can
[1:04:37] you say well I need to do this I need to
[1:04:38] go get counseling I need to do this and
[1:04:40] that I'm not against that but what wait
[1:04:42] and see if maybe the stronger man could
[1:04:45] come by maybe he could cast out the the
[1:04:47] strong man because there's no one
[1:04:50] greater than Jesus there's no one bigger
[1:04:52] than he is
[1:04:56] if he's cast out when so when you see
[1:04:58] Devils begin to be cast out you know the
[1:05:01] stronger man has come by so that's what
[1:05:04] Jesus said happen he said it was the
[1:05:07] strong man had his house but when the
[1:05:09] stronger one came by the reason the
[1:05:12] devils are cast out is because the
[1:05:14] stronger Man cast him out and that house
[1:05:17] became the house of the stronger
[1:05:21] man now in Luke 11: 18 he said if Satan
[1:05:25] also be divided against himself how
[1:05:26] shall his kingdom stand because you say
[1:05:28] that I cast out Devils to beel above but
[1:05:31] if I with the Finger of God cast out
[1:05:35] Devils no doubt the kingdom of God is
[1:05:39] come upon you now brother Brandon points
[1:05:42] that out to us he said he cast out
[1:05:44] Devils with his
[1:05:46] finger but when he goes after his sheep
[1:05:49] listen to me he doesn't use his finger
[1:05:51] see a devil's a little thing to God yeah
[1:05:53] he can cast out demons with his finger
[1:05:56] but he but when he comes after his lost
[1:05:58] sheep he doesn't use his finger but he
[1:06:01] puts the Sheep across the strongest part
[1:06:03] of his body oh I'm so glad that when he
[1:06:05] come after me he didn't just use his
[1:06:07] finger but he used the strongest part of
[1:06:09] his body and he come and he bore me into
[1:06:12] his
[1:06:12] house he was a stronger man and he's not
[1:06:16] but he didn't just trust in his finger
[1:06:18] to deliver you but he came and he bore
[1:06:21] you across his shoulders B said see how
[1:06:23] he loves you so now now look what was
[1:06:26] happening you know what the major
[1:06:28] difference in the Pharisees and the
[1:06:29] Sadducees was the Pharisees believed in
[1:06:32] a resurrection and the Sadducees didn't
[1:06:35] believe there was a
[1:06:36] resurrection and while they were
[1:06:38] debating about it Jesus raised Lazarus
[1:06:41] from the
[1:06:42] dead come on Church what was it all
[1:06:46] their weapon was was argument but Jesus
[1:06:48] come by he was the stronger man the
[1:06:51] stronger man come by and there they had
[1:06:54] argument but he had reality he settled
[1:06:57] the question when Lazarus come out of
[1:06:59] the Grave how could you not believe in a
[1:07:00] resurrection when there's a dead man
[1:07:02] walking oh come on Church what is the
[1:07:04] evidence today that the stronger man is
[1:07:06] here it's because you and I have been
[1:07:08] raised from dead trespasses and sin and
[1:07:11] we're walking with him every day oh that
[1:07:12] ought to make us excited church that
[1:07:14] ought to turn us give us a little joy in
[1:07:16] our heart because we know that the
[1:07:18] stronger man has come
[1:07:20] by oh my Hallelujah well they were
[1:07:24] debating whether or not days of Miracles
[1:07:27] were passed a strong man come by
[1:07:30] stronger one and prove God's word was
[1:07:34] true see Paul tells us he said you being
[1:07:37] dead in your sins in Colossians 2:13 and
[1:07:40] the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:07:42] quickened together with him having
[1:07:44] forgiven you all someone say all all
[1:07:49] trespasses oh I'm so glad he forgives
[1:07:52] all your
[1:07:53] trespasses blotting out the hand writing
[1:07:55] of ordinances that was against us which
[1:07:57] was contrary to us took it out of the
[1:07:59] way nailing it to his cross I think I've
[1:08:01] told you before but the way that they
[1:08:02] canceled a mortgage in that day and age
[1:08:05] was to actually take the original
[1:08:06] mortgage and use a blotter and blot it
[1:08:09] out where you couldn't even read what
[1:08:12] church you couldn't even read what the
[1:08:13] terms were anymore you couldn't even
[1:08:16] read what the amount was anymore they
[1:08:18] blotted it out and he said he blotted
[1:08:20] out the law that was against us on
[1:08:22] Hallelujah blotted out that thou shallal
[1:08:24] not kill now show not and because we had
[1:08:26] done that we killed and we lied and we
[1:08:28] committed adultery all of those things
[1:08:30] but he blotted that out he blotted out
[1:08:33] what was against us which was contrary
[1:08:35] to us took it out of the way nailing it
[1:08:37] to his cross yes and listen what he did
[1:08:39] the stronger man came by and having
[1:08:42] spoiled principalities yeah that means
[1:08:45] the spoiling back then they we don't
[1:08:47] understand what that is but used to an
[1:08:49] army when they went into a country they
[1:08:51] didn't just go in they had Wars they
[1:08:53] make up reasons for Wars because they
[1:08:56] wanted the spoil they were going in for
[1:08:58] the spoil so they would go in and take
[1:09:01] everything that belonged to that soldier
[1:09:03] that came because when you come to fight
[1:09:04] a war you got to bring stuff with you so
[1:09:07] they would actually fight the war to
[1:09:08] gain the
[1:09:09] spoil and Jesus Hallelujah fought the
[1:09:13] War took the devil's own
[1:09:16] stuff took it away from him took the
[1:09:18] keys of death in Hell Hallelujah he said
[1:09:21] he made a show of them openly when the
[1:09:24] Roman emperors would defeat a country
[1:09:27] when they when Titus defeated Jerusalem
[1:09:30] he sacked Jerusalem burn it to the
[1:09:32] ground and and there wasn't even a town
[1:09:35] there anymore just a Roman encampment
[1:09:37] would have been a city of thousands and
[1:09:39] thousands of people and he sailed back
[1:09:43] to Rome and there's an arch there called
[1:09:45] I believe it's titus's Arch and it has a
[1:09:49] it has a a relief you know drawn on it
[1:09:52] like a a sculpture on it and it shows
[1:09:55] the the the procession of how that they
[1:09:58] come back bearing the things oh my the
[1:10:01] things that they had stolen and taken
[1:10:03] out of the temple and famously on it
[1:10:05] there's a manora cuz they took that out
[1:10:07] of the temple and what were they doing
[1:10:10] they were saying we're
[1:10:11] stronger right they're saying our gods
[1:10:14] are stronger than their gods they're
[1:10:16] saying our nation is stronger than their
[1:10:18] Nation what did Christ do when he come
[1:10:21] back Paul says he spoiled principalities
[1:10:23] and powers and he had a Triumph when he
[1:10:25] come back he made a show of them openly
[1:10:28] triumphing over them in it he didn't
[1:10:30] just he didn't just defeat the Devil he
[1:10:33] humiliated the
[1:10:34] devil took the teeth out of him made him
[1:10:38] where he couldn't even get took away the
[1:10:39] keys to his own
[1:10:41] house made him where he had no power and
[1:10:43] then you give in to him come on church
[1:10:46] say well we just got we just can't do it
[1:10:47] cuz the devil you know the devil so we
[1:10:50] got to just really be careful cuz we
[1:10:51] might be deceived come on Church he's a
[1:10:53] devil we got to understand who is yeah
[1:10:56] he has power but the stronger one has
[1:10:58] come
[1:10:59] by
[1:11:01] yes the the maniac of gadera think of
[1:11:04] him he was possessed by a legion of
[1:11:08] demons and everybody everywhere he' come
[1:11:11] against something he was the stronger
[1:11:14] man right they tried to bind him with
[1:11:17] chains but he was the stronger
[1:11:20] man they they tried to they tried to
[1:11:23] keep him in a house but he was the
[1:11:26] stronger man because he was possessed by
[1:11:28] Legions of devils brother brand we we
[1:11:32] talked about that here recently brother
[1:11:33] BR said that was some devils them Devils
[1:11:35] of
[1:11:36] hatred come on him he said they
[1:11:39] multiplied he said that devil of hatred
[1:11:41] is the same devil that come out of
[1:11:42] Legion that devil of temper when you
[1:11:44] lose your temper he said it's the same
[1:11:46] they lose it it's the same devil that
[1:11:48] come out of Legion he said but the one
[1:11:50] that was in Legion he said just it was
[1:11:52] multiplied there were just many of them
[1:11:54] made him so strong strong strong that he
[1:11:56] could break
[1:11:58] chains oh my but one day a little man
[1:12:04] who didn't look very strong sir who
[1:12:06] looked weak who looked like he couldn't
[1:12:08] oh come on church he looked like he
[1:12:11] wasn't much in the flesh but the BR said
[1:12:13] didn't look like a leader he wasn't very
[1:12:15] tall he didn't look very imposing didn't
[1:12:17] look like a military man but he had
[1:12:19] great Authority one day when he crossed
[1:12:22] over to the other side of the sea and
[1:12:24] Legion stood before for him Legion had
[1:12:26] never faced a stronger man but on this
[1:12:28] day that demon had to ask for permission
[1:12:31] of where to go when he cast him out
[1:12:33] listen he didn't have to jump and holler
[1:12:35] and and scream and and pray all night or
[1:12:37] nothing else to get Legion to come out
[1:12:39] all he had to say was come out of
[1:12:42] him come on Church why he was the
[1:12:44] stronger
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] man right
[1:12:50] Hallelujah he made a show of it Jesus is
[1:12:54] stronger than a legion of demons right
[1:12:57] stronger stronger than the the Bible
[1:13:00] says that you know Legion was mentally
[1:13:02] disabled or at least he had mental
[1:13:05] issues we would call a mental
[1:13:08] sickness because the Bible says when he
[1:13:10] come to himself so when Jesus cast him
[1:13:12] out he he was in clothed and in his
[1:13:14] right mind proving that before he had
[1:13:17] not been in his right
[1:13:20] mind but Jesus is
[1:13:23] stronger amen huh come on now come on
[1:13:28] church right I know we deal with these
[1:13:30] things it's The Age of Anxiety it's the
[1:13:32] age of mental depression is the age when
[1:13:34] uh we we're told we name these things
[1:13:37] and we're told that these things have a
[1:13:39] place in our lives but I'm here to I'm
[1:13:41] still preaching the gospel today we're
[1:13:43] not preaching self-help and we're not
[1:13:45] preaching a a 12-step program I'm still
[1:13:47] preaching to you the gospel that there's
[1:13:49] a stronger man that can come by and when
[1:13:51] the word comes by your direction he can
[1:13:54] speak to that devil and cast him
[1:13:58] out that's not to minimize what's going
[1:14:01] on I know the devil is strong he's armed
[1:14:03] yeah he he's strong man but the stronger
[1:14:06] man is
[1:14:07] here good good yes come on Hallelujah
[1:14:12] the anointed word is stronger than
[1:14:15] whatever Affliction you have which is
[1:14:18] caused by demonic
[1:14:21] power and and you say well what is a
[1:14:24] demon a demon is a fallen
[1:14:26] angel the the the King James version
[1:14:29] calls him a devil but if you go back
[1:14:31] into Greek it's demon which is demon
[1:14:33] demon a a demon is not the devil the
[1:14:37] devil is Satan but a demon is one of the
[1:14:39] angels that fell with the Devils also
[1:14:42] King James also calls him an evil spirit
[1:14:45] in Jude chapter 6 it says the a or Jude
[1:14:48] verse 6 the Angels which kept not their
[1:14:50] first estate but left their own
[1:14:52] habitation he hath reserved
[1:14:55] in Everlasting
[1:14:57] chains you say well I wish he'd come by
[1:14:59] and bind this demon that's working he
[1:15:01] already
[1:15:02] has right yes Hallelujah he hath
[1:15:07] reserved that
[1:15:09] devil that bothers you that that devil
[1:15:11] of sickness that devil of cancer he hath
[1:15:14] Reser do we believe the word or not he
[1:15:17] hath reserved yes that devil in
[1:15:20] Everlasting chains under Darkness right
[1:15:23] unto the Judgment of the great day he's
[1:15:27] already got a
[1:15:28] slot you know how they give time slots
[1:15:30] if you've ever been involved in court I
[1:15:32] was just not because I was in court for
[1:15:34] myself but because I worked for an
[1:15:36] attorney and we always there's time
[1:15:38] slots for court you know and you're
[1:15:39] supposed to show up and maybe they'll
[1:15:40] say at months ahead and you got to
[1:15:42] remember you got to be there at 3:00 in

[1:15:47] time he's already
[1:15:49] reserved come on church that Old Devil
[1:15:52] that's been bugging you that that that
[1:15:53] old arthritis that's comes on you and
[1:15:55] that Old Demon of sickness that tries to
[1:15:57] oppress you you remember he's already
[1:15:59] been reserved for a place at the
[1:16:01] Judgment seat of
[1:16:05] God
[1:16:07] hallelujah you already got a time
[1:16:09] slot you tell your time's
[1:16:12] coming you got a little you got a little
[1:16:14] space a little season you can torment me
[1:16:17] now but your time's
[1:16:18] coming you're on the docket sir for
[1:16:23] Destruction
[1:16:25] Hallelujah these are the one-third of
[1:16:27] angels that fell with Lucifer if you go
[1:16:30] to Roman or Revelation 12 and I don't
[1:16:31] have time to to take it today but talked
[1:16:34] about the dragon how he drew a third
[1:16:36] part of the stars out of the heavens
[1:16:38] with him and Jesus actually when he came
[1:16:43] now the stronger man came but he didn't
[1:16:46] Reserve his strength for
[1:16:48] himself because a real strong man he
[1:16:51] lives for others he he gives to others
[1:16:54] and it's so in Luke chapter 10 even
[1:16:56] before the coming of the Holy Ghost we
[1:16:58] find that the 70 had the power Jesus had
[1:17:01] delegated to them the power to to
[1:17:05] overcome demons to overcome Devils it
[1:17:08] says the 70 returned again with Joy
[1:17:11] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[1:17:13] unto us through thy name that's that the
[1:17:15] demons are subject unto us through thy
[1:17:17] name and he said unto them he said I
[1:17:20] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[1:17:23] Heaven behold I give unto you power to
[1:17:27] tread on serpents and scorpions over all
[1:17:31] the power of the enemy and nothing shall
[1:17:34] by any means hurt
[1:17:38] you now we believe the word or we don't
[1:17:40] when are we going to take it
[1:17:43] seriously are you with B now you might
[1:17:46] even bring me down but you're not going
[1:17:47] to hurt me yeah yeah it might be painful
[1:17:50] but it's not going to hurt me right it
[1:17:52] can only be used as a tool by god listen
[1:17:55] to me when we go through things when we
[1:17:57] maybe get sick or something happens
[1:17:59] maybe our finances aren't exactly what
[1:18:00] we want them to be and we're thinking
[1:18:02] how what what's going on in my life
[1:18:04] remember it's for a purpose a reason
[1:18:06] there's a season that you're going
[1:18:08] through as brother George preach the
[1:18:09] other weekend there's something that
[1:18:10] you're going through that only lasts for
[1:18:11] a little while remember it's a season
[1:18:14] and God had to allow it because those
[1:18:16] devils are bound right reserved to
[1:18:19] judgment yes he's already been defeated
[1:18:22] yeah and he said I give you power that
[1:18:24] nothing someone say nothing this morning
[1:18:27] shall by any means hurt
[1:18:29] you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not
[1:18:33] that the spirits are subject unto you
[1:18:36] but rather Rejoice Hallelujah because
[1:18:40] your names are written in heaven right
[1:18:43] oh he said that's the reason that you
[1:18:44] ought to Rejoice not because that you've
[1:18:46] overcome all these things but you have
[1:18:48] that power to overcome but yet he said
[1:18:50] Rejoice that your names are written in
[1:18:52] heaven what was it he was the stronger
[1:18:55] one what do they say they said we are
[1:18:57] even devils are subject unto us through
[1:18:59] thy name see the name because he's the
[1:19:03] stronger one in Revelation 12 and: 7 the
[1:19:07] Bible tells us that there was war in
[1:19:09] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[1:19:10] against the dragon the dragon fought and
[1:19:12] his angels prevailed not neither was
[1:19:15] their place found anymore in heaven the
[1:19:18] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[1:19:19] serpent called the devil and Satan was
[1:19:21] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:19:23] down to the Earth and his angels were
[1:19:24] cast out with
[1:19:26] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:19:29] heaven now has come salvation and
[1:19:31] strength and the kingdom of our God the
[1:19:33] power of His Christ for the accuser of
[1:19:35] our Brethren is cast down which accused
[1:19:38] him before our God day and night see
[1:19:40] he's been dethroned
[1:19:43] yesen right he's
[1:19:45] dethroned the difference in you now and
[1:19:48] you before is not that the devil can't
[1:19:49] bother you but he's been
[1:19:51] dethroned that dethronement has to take
[1:19:54] place in your
[1:19:55] life right that's that's that's got to
[1:19:57] there's got to be an experience of the
[1:19:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost that takes him
[1:20:00] off the throne and put someone else on
[1:20:03] the throne young people listen to me
[1:20:05] it's not enough just to go to a message
[1:20:07] church it's not just enough just say I
[1:20:08] believe but you got to have an
[1:20:09] experience with God that you know that
[1:20:11] there someone else came and is living in
[1:20:14] your heart so it's not enough just to
[1:20:17] say I believe in a message or a prophet
[1:20:19] or anything else you got to have a
[1:20:20] dethronement of Satan and an
[1:20:23] enthronement of Christ in your heart and
[1:20:26] brother brand you say well how can I
[1:20:27] tell if that happen brother brandom
[1:20:28] tells us by your desire you can tell
[1:20:30] who's on the throne of your
[1:20:32] heart right by your desire you can tell
[1:20:35] what do you want many times we we find
[1:20:36] ourselves caught in bad situations but
[1:20:38] what is your the desire of your heart
[1:20:40] what do you really want oh I want to be
[1:20:42] in his presence I want to live for him I
[1:20:44] want to be clean and holy and live a
[1:20:46] Godly life then what is it there's the
[1:20:47] power to do that then you can tell he's
[1:20:50] on the
[1:20:52] throne now so the first battle was the
[1:20:57] battle between Michael and
[1:21:00] Lucifer brother BR said then was thrown
[1:21:02] down from heaven cast out of Heaven to
[1:21:05] the Earth and fell on human
[1:21:06] beings then the battle from Angels
[1:21:09] became human battles and Satan come to
[1:21:12] destroy God's creation what God had
[1:21:15] created to be for
[1:21:18] himself he had Satan come to destroy
[1:21:21] this that's what his purpose was to
[1:21:24] destroy
[1:21:25] then the battle begin here on Earth and
[1:21:28] begin in us and has been
[1:21:30] raging ever since now we know where that
[1:21:33] Battleground is the Battleground is the
[1:21:35] mind
[1:21:37] right I was chosen for the
[1:21:39] Battleground so what is the
[1:21:42] fight the battle of the Mind what's
[1:21:44] going on in your mind it's for
[1:21:46] possession yeah of a house right right
[1:21:51] it's the battle for possession of your
[1:21:54] house it's going on right
[1:21:55] now right now in your mind the devil you
[1:21:58] think he gives up when you receive the
[1:21:59] Holy Ghost no he's got access to your
[1:22:01] mind when you receive the Holy Ghost the
[1:22:03] devil don't just give up right right but
[1:22:06] but he has he has access to your mind so
[1:22:09] he's trying to get you to not pay
[1:22:11] attention yeah right the devil's trying
[1:22:13] to do that right the devil's trying to
[1:22:15] get it where you you know and maybe it's
[1:22:18] something that going on in your family
[1:22:19] or going on at home or going on in your
[1:22:22] work you sit in church and
[1:22:25] it get you a little hot uncomfortable
[1:22:27] and your mind starts to wonder yeah why
[1:22:30] because God's about to tell you
[1:22:31] something you need to
[1:22:33] know not cuz I'm saying it but because
[1:22:35] that's what he does for his children
[1:22:37] right and the battle's going on in the
[1:22:39] mind the devil's trying to take that
[1:22:40] thought away from you because he knows
[1:22:42] that the word is stronger than him so
[1:22:44] the only way he can overcome you is if
[1:22:46] you allow the word to to or you you do
[1:22:49] not allow the word to come in if you if
[1:22:51] you accept the word and reject Satan the
[1:22:53] word is always is stronger than the
[1:22:56] devil but if you're having if you're
[1:22:58] having a problem you say well I'm unable
[1:22:59] to overcome it's because you haven't
[1:23:01] fully accepted the word by Faith from
[1:23:04] the heart now look it it's not our
[1:23:08] effort that cast out
[1:23:11] demons it's the stronger man yeah yeah
[1:23:15] right Jesus said I do it with the Finger
[1:23:17] of God yeah right it's not effort I want
[1:23:22] you if you have a chance this week to go
[1:23:24] back and watch TL osbor his testimony
[1:23:26] about brother brandham specifically the
[1:23:28] one where he talks about how brother
[1:23:30] brandham dealt with a deaf and dumb
[1:23:32] spirit and he talks about being there in
[1:23:35] Portland I'll just give you a little bit
[1:23:36] of it he talks about brother brandom
[1:23:39] it's available on
[1:23:40] YouTube he talks about brother Brandon
[1:23:42] being in Portland in the great uh or in
[1:23:44] the early in the late 40s that in
[1:23:46] brother Brandon's early Ministry that
[1:23:47] great meeting they had in Portland
[1:23:49] Oregon and he said in the big this is
[1:23:52] tal Osburn talking about it he said in
[1:23:54] the Big City Auditorium it seats 8,000
[1:23:56] people he said we sat in the third
[1:23:58] balcony this gentle little man came out
[1:24:02] on the
[1:24:03] platform he said he was like Christ to
[1:24:06] me he said he spoke very
[1:24:09] careful he preached tender but firm and
[1:24:13] when he got through preaching hundreds
[1:24:15] of people came and accepted Christ and T
[1:24:19] osbor looks at that and says I want to
[1:24:21] do
[1:24:22] that right and then he called for the
[1:24:25] sick marvelous Miracles took place as we
[1:24:29] watched and and till urn said he had had
[1:24:33] a vision of Jesus just before that and
[1:24:35] he went to that meeting he said I had a
[1:24:37] second Vision he said I saw Jesus Christ
[1:24:40] in that man oh that people would see
[1:24:43] Jesus in US yeah that wasn't limited to
[1:24:46] brother brandom listen the son of man
[1:24:48] wasn't only limited to brother brandom
[1:24:50] the son of man the the the evidence of
[1:24:52] the of the son of man of the
[1:24:53] Resurrection was only one man to one
[1:24:56] generation but the son of man is in the
[1:24:58] bride revealing himself not as a prophet
[1:25:01] but as men and women and boys and girls
[1:25:03] living everyday
[1:25:07] life but what he said I saw Jesus Christ
[1:25:09] in that man yeah he said pretty soon
[1:25:12] there was a girl that was born deaf and
[1:25:15] dumb and come on the
[1:25:17] platform and this is his words he said I
[1:25:19] was a noise making
[1:25:21] Pentecostal he said we were scared of
[1:25:23] devils
[1:25:25] and if we thought someone had a devil we
[1:25:28] were scared of them and the best we
[1:25:30] could do was yell at them and gang up on
[1:25:35] them and the more noise we made the
[1:25:38] greater possibility maybe they would
[1:25:41] go now we've all been there get a little
[1:25:44] bit weak in faith you know say I wish I
[1:25:45] had a whole gang of it you know there's
[1:25:47] nothing wrong with ganging up on the
[1:25:50] devil but what God showed us to a
[1:25:52] prophet's Ministry is you don't have to
[1:25:53] do that right you don't have to have 12
[1:25:56] preachers around
[1:25:58] you reminds me of a little story I was
[1:26:00] at a meeting one time and there was a
[1:26:02] people that didn't believe in Preachers
[1:26:03] that showed up at the meeting and and uh
[1:26:06] they uh they were going to have their
[1:26:07] vows renewed and their headquarters told
[1:26:10] them they needed to have a preacher do
[1:26:11] that which I don't understand that
[1:26:13] completely but they need to have a
[1:26:15] preacher do that and so they show up at
[1:26:17] the meeting and the Pastor said well
[1:26:18] we'll do it we'll do it this morning you
[1:26:20] just being gracious I just kidding I
[1:26:22] said you know you ought to just have
[1:26:23] every preacher in that place come and
[1:26:25] and lay hands on them and pray over them
[1:26:27] and sure enough he did
[1:26:30] it every preacher in that place there
[1:26:32] must have been about 15 of us and we all
[1:26:34] come around you know and gather around
[1:26:36] you talk about being ganged up on they
[1:26:38] were as nervous as a longtailed cat in a
[1:26:40] room full of rocking
[1:26:42] chairs and get and prayed for them
[1:26:44] people they didn't believe in Preachers
[1:26:46] well that you know we ganged up on them
[1:26:49] but you don't have to gang up on the
[1:26:50] devil that's right because you and God's
[1:26:52] a majority
[1:26:55] you don't even have to yell at
[1:26:57] him are you with me Church speak to him
[1:27:01] yes speak to that devil tell him you
[1:27:03] don't belong here right right you you do
[1:27:07] not belong in my house you are not
[1:27:10] strong enough sir to take this
[1:27:13] house oh I don't care what Devil's
[1:27:15] bothering you today I'm here to tell you
[1:27:17] I'm here to tell you to remind you this
[1:27:19] morning he is not strong enough to take
[1:27:21] your house he's not strong enough to
[1:27:23] take your marriage he's not strong
[1:27:24] enough to take you until it's your time
[1:27:26] to go in sickness he is not strong
[1:27:28] enough the stronger man has come
[1:27:32] by he said the best we could do is yell
[1:27:35] at them and gang up on them and the more
[1:27:36] noise we made the greater possibility
[1:27:38] maybe they would
[1:27:39] go he said this man pulled this little
[1:27:42] girl to his side like a father and he
[1:27:44] spoke so kind to the people please bow
[1:27:47] your heads while we pray for the
[1:27:49] child he said this man I'll never forget
[1:27:52] his prayer just quiet but first
[1:27:54] he said thou deaf and dumb Spirit leave
[1:27:57] the child and enter her no more he said
[1:28:00] I was
[1:28:01] shocked he said audience you can lift
[1:28:04] your heads now the evil spirit has left
[1:28:07] the
[1:28:08] child and I said how do you
[1:28:10] know we haven't even made any noise
[1:28:17] yet he was looking for a moment of
[1:28:19] Deliverance but brother BR said the evil
[1:28:21] spirit was left the child because he
[1:28:23] knew the stronger one had commissioned
[1:28:25] him to cast out Devils so when he said
[1:28:28] Satan how many times have you heard him
[1:28:29] say it Satan I adure you to leave what
[1:28:32] was he saying he was under Authority
[1:28:35] that's what Jesus why he was different
[1:28:37] from all the rest they he come teaching
[1:28:38] as a one under Authority he said leave
[1:28:40] and they
[1:28:41] left he said be healed and they were
[1:28:44] healed sir are you with me now yes he
[1:28:47] said I saw Jesus in that man if we see
[1:28:52] Jesus now was one of his contemporaries
[1:28:55] teal Osborne never did embrace the
[1:28:57] message but he understood that there was
[1:28:59] something there right if we see Jesus
[1:29:03] casting out Devils with his finger right
[1:29:06] what do we know we know the kingdom of
[1:29:08] God is coming to us right we had
[1:29:10] denominational ages we had Pentecostals
[1:29:12] all over the place healing meetings and
[1:29:14] everything else but there come a time
[1:29:16] when God came down and what did he show
[1:29:18] us to the ministry of a prophet of a man
[1:29:21] of a mortal man not a God but he' come
[1:29:23] down and he showed himself through that
[1:29:25] man and he said what did we what could
[1:29:27] we say what could we deduce from that
[1:29:29] the kingdom of God has come to us we now
[1:29:32] know that the stronger
[1:29:35] one you don't read about demons being
[1:29:38] cast out in the Old
[1:29:40] Testament did you know
[1:29:42] that there's not a single example that I
[1:29:44] can think of of a demon being cast out
[1:29:46] people are healed and things but it
[1:29:47] never specifically say the devil's cast
[1:29:49] out but suddenly Jesus comeing along and
[1:29:51] he's cast them out left and right
[1:29:54] why the stronger men come
[1:29:57] by amen oh my denominations they had
[1:30:01] church and they had church and they had
[1:30:02] church but in the in the ministry you
[1:30:04] realize it was more than the ministry of
[1:30:05] a man but through the ministry of a
[1:30:07] prophet God came by and he showed us a
[1:30:09] stronger man was in the
[1:30:12] house and he hadn't
[1:30:15] left so the brother brand talked about
[1:30:18] the angel can you bear with me just for
[1:30:19] a few more minutes brother brand talked
[1:30:22] about the angel of the Lord that come to
[1:30:23] him and he said that was not Christ
[1:30:26] himself right he didn't have a
[1:30:28] beard that's one way he said he was
[1:30:30] clean shaven and he was of a different
[1:30:34] height than when he saw Christ in the
[1:30:36] field
[1:30:37] remember and he said but the angel that
[1:30:40] come in was not Christ himself he was an
[1:30:44] angel but he was a strong
[1:30:47] Angel the strength was not in William
[1:30:52] Brandon yeah
[1:30:54] but a strong Angel stood by his
[1:30:57] side now he he was sent from the
[1:31:00] presence of Christ but the say that many
[1:31:02] times he said I am sent from the
[1:31:03] presence of Christ the presence of
[1:31:05] God he said now he talk about the angel
[1:31:09] coming say I'm just trying to speak of
[1:31:10] this Angel the Lord I do not worship
[1:31:12] that angel he said in the first place
[1:31:14] I'd say this I believe if I'd even made
[1:31:16] the attempt that the angel himself would
[1:31:18] correct me for I truly believe he was
[1:31:21] sent from God see we don't brother
[1:31:23] brother Bram didn't worship the angel we
[1:31:25] don't worship brother brown right right
[1:31:27] but it's something that God was using
[1:31:29] him he was a messenger yes a strong
[1:31:31] Messenger right Hallelujah a strong
[1:31:35] Angel but he what we don't worship him
[1:31:37] come on now Hallelujah he said he was a
[1:31:40] man just as I am just as much human
[1:31:42] looking as I are you and he looks to be
[1:31:44] a man in his 30s I'd say a strongl
[1:31:45] looking man folding his hands yeah well
[1:31:49] go back to Revelation chap 5 and you can
[1:31:51] go and take anecdotal evidence and say
[1:31:53] well this was a strong
[1:31:55] Angel right he come for a purpose he
[1:31:58] come at a certain time and for a certain
[1:32:00] purpose to to get give a commission to a
[1:32:04] prophet to have a Ministry that the
[1:32:06] strength of that Ministry had not been
[1:32:07] seen many many years and yet in in
[1:32:11] Revelation 5:2 there was a a
[1:32:13] proclamation that went out you you
[1:32:15] you've heard it many times and the Bible
[1:32:17] says a strong angel I saw a strong Angel
[1:32:21] yeah proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:32:24] who's
[1:32:26] worthy brother brandom tells us in the
[1:32:28] breach he was advertising for a
[1:32:31] redeemer who's
[1:32:34] Worthy is a strong Angel yes sir but
[1:32:37] even a strong Angel can't open the
[1:32:40] book it took a mighty
[1:32:44] Angel The Mighty Angel it was not just
[1:32:47] an angel but was Christ
[1:32:49] himself right a strong Angel could not
[1:32:51] take the book it took a stronger man
[1:32:54] that's oh Church the lamb had to open
[1:32:56] the book The Lamb had to die for sin now
[1:32:59] the angel brought it to brother brandham
[1:33:00] but the angel is a messenger from who
[1:33:02] from the lamb are you with me now hope I
[1:33:06] haven't lost you it took a stronger man
[1:33:09] yeah and you see it had to be a man
[1:33:11] because man lost
[1:33:14] it Adam lost the keys to his house Adam
[1:33:18] lost a title deed to heavens and earth
[1:33:21] when he lost it the book was sealed it's
[1:33:23] just a simp simp as I know how to put it
[1:33:25] the book was sealed and when it was
[1:33:27] sealed There's No Redemption listen if
[1:33:29] you cannot receive Revelation sir from
[1:33:32] this book There's No Redemption for you
[1:33:35] right are you hearing me there's got to
[1:33:36] be re you say well it's I don't
[1:33:38] understand the complexity it's not
[1:33:39] complexity you have to understand but
[1:33:41] you it's got to be revealed to you that
[1:33:43] Jesus died for your sins he can be
[1:33:44] revealed to you in that manner even as a
[1:33:46] child yeah but it's got to be revealed
[1:33:48] to you right it's not enough just to
[1:33:50] understand it here but it's got to be
[1:33:52] open to you yeah and all through the Old
[1:33:55] Testament they could not have it in
[1:33:56] their heart they could only have it in
[1:33:58] their head but he come to to turn the
[1:34:00] heart of the children back to the
[1:34:01] fathers he come what did he do through
[1:34:03] this ministry he opened the
[1:34:06] seals the lamb opened the seals brother
[1:34:08] Braham didn't open the seals the lamb
[1:34:10] did and he gave Hallelujah he gave the
[1:34:14] book
[1:34:15] to the opening of the word he gave it to
[1:34:18] a an angel gave it to a
[1:34:22] prophet Prophet gave gave it to us yes
[1:34:26] Hallelujah why because a stronger man
[1:34:29] yeah had come by and what did he say man
[1:34:32] had lost it it had to be Redeemed by the
[1:34:34] stronger man not the strong Angel but
[1:34:36] the stronger man yeah and one of the
[1:34:39] elders saith unto me weep not Behold The
[1:34:42] Lion of the tribe of Judah we just went
[1:34:44] through this with the with the tribe of
[1:34:45] Judah teaching on that the root of David
[1:34:47] hath what prevailed sir he hath
[1:34:51] prevailed he has overcome to open the
[1:34:53] book and to loose the Seven Seals
[1:34:54] thereof when he looked he didn't see a
[1:34:56] line what did he see he saw a
[1:34:58] lamb
[1:35:00] hallelujah
[1:35:02] hallelujah the devil has strong
[1:35:05] demons right just like God's Got Strong
[1:35:07] Angels there's weak demons and strong
[1:35:11] demons
[1:35:13] right and and demons gain power from
[1:35:19] Fear whatever you're afraid of demons
[1:35:23] can't grow more powerful because you're
[1:35:24] giving them more
[1:35:27] room it's just like a battlefield the
[1:35:30] more room that you have in the
[1:35:31] battlefield you're trying to take the
[1:35:32] ground right more room that you have
[1:35:35] Jaden and chess you're trying to push
[1:35:38] the other person
[1:35:39] across right you're trying to build
[1:35:42] space for yourself and put them on the
[1:35:46] defensive and the way the demon gains
[1:35:49] power and puts you on the defensive is
[1:35:51] fear well if I go to church this will
[1:35:54] happen yeah if I if I live for God
[1:35:57] people laugh at me yeah huh if I quit
[1:36:00] doing this thing I know is wrong to do
[1:36:03] people say I'm crazy on now it's fear
[1:36:07] brother BR said those demons of fear
[1:36:09] come over him you remember him talking
[1:36:10] about it I don't have the quote with me
[1:36:11] this morning but he said I would have
[1:36:13] received Christ at 8 years old he said
[1:36:16] but them demons come and said wait yeah
[1:36:18] wait a little longer the people laugh at
[1:36:21] you people make fun of you they do the
[1:36:22] same things today right that's right and
[1:36:24] what do you do you give speci way said
[1:36:26] don't give place to the devil don't give
[1:36:28] him room to maneuver right right cuz if
[1:36:31] you give him room in one area here he'll
[1:36:33] come around get in another area and get
[1:36:35] in another area pretty soon you find
[1:36:36] yourself with all kinds of devils
[1:36:38] wandering around take care of it when
[1:36:40] you have a problem that's the time to
[1:36:42] deal with it when you have a bad thought
[1:36:44] that's the time to deal with it when
[1:36:45] Satan tells you nobody loves you deal
[1:36:47] with it right there and say I know Jesus
[1:36:49] loves me and that's
[1:36:52] enough h
[1:36:55] good you got to stop him as we preached
[1:36:58] before stop him at the borders the devil
[1:37:00] has strong demons cause
[1:37:02] cancer strong demons that cause
[1:37:06] depression sickness anxiety evil
[1:37:10] thoughts but God has strong angels
[1:37:13] too and brother BR said Satan's Army
[1:37:15] brings diseases and God's Army is
[1:37:18] commissioned to cast them
[1:37:20] out the devil arms himself remember the
[1:37:23] strong man is
[1:37:25] armed but when the stronger man takes
[1:37:28] possession he has weapons
[1:37:31] too he's got armor
[1:37:33] too brother BR said the greatest battle
[1:37:36] ever fought she's going on right in here
[1:37:37] now yes sir between life and death
[1:37:39] between sickness and health between
[1:37:41] faith and doubt between Liberty and
[1:37:43] bondage it's going on right here this
[1:37:45] morning can we see it church it's going
[1:37:47] on right here right the strong one is
[1:37:51] wanting to bring sickness on you and
[1:37:54] here's the word that says by his stripes
[1:37:56] I am
[1:37:59] healed he said the battle is
[1:38:01] on he said Shine Your spear soldiers
[1:38:05] polish up the armor God is getting his
[1:38:07] soldiers ready God anoints his
[1:38:12] army he talked about America's Army how
[1:38:15] they dressed their army for
[1:38:17] success and Hebrews 4:12 says for the
[1:38:19] word of God is or let me back up but the
[1:38:23] brand said God dresses his army
[1:38:24] hallelujah what kind of equipment do we
[1:38:26] use the spirit of the sword the word of
[1:38:28] God and we don't separate the word and
[1:38:30] the spirit right we're we're we are not
[1:38:33] word only in the sense that we're word
[1:38:35] only in the sense that we only want the
[1:38:37] word not anything that's not true right
[1:38:39] we only want the truth but we're not
[1:38:40] word only in the sense we don't believe
[1:38:41] in the power of God we believe in the
[1:38:43] power of God because if it is the word
[1:38:44] the god power of God anoints it this you
[1:38:47] kind of always dwelt over the word if
[1:38:49] it's the true word the power of God will
[1:38:51] be there you you can't separate the two
[1:38:54] and I preached that before you can't
[1:38:55] separate the lust feel like I'm just
[1:38:56] repeating myself this morning you can't
[1:38:58] you can't separate the logos from the
[1:39:01] word you can't separate the anointing
[1:39:03] from the word he's the same person when
[1:39:06] he come on the in flesh he's the same
[1:39:08] one yeah Hallelujah and the word of God
[1:39:12] is alive the word of God is Spirit he
[1:39:16] said my words are Spirit in life the
[1:39:18] word of God is quick that's alive and
[1:39:20] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:39:22] sword piercing even to the dividing of
[1:39:24] ther of Soul and Spirit of the joints
[1:39:26] and Marl and a discerner of the thoughts
[1:39:28] and T the ARs he armed the church what's
[1:39:30] armed with his word his Spirit of the
[1:39:32] word to cast out
[1:39:35] Devils BR said the word of God to
[1:39:37] believe his word that's the way God
[1:39:39] armors
[1:39:41] yeah that's what he gave Eve to arm him
[1:39:43] herself with she broke her armor down
[1:39:45] how'd she do it by opening up her mind
[1:39:47] to reason he said you don't reason with
[1:39:49] God's word it has no reason it's just
[1:39:52] God's word right there's no doubt about
[1:39:54] it there's no reasonings to it it's
[1:39:56] God's word that settles it that's got it
[1:39:58] that settles it forever don't you let no
[1:40:00] devil come by and tell you you're not
[1:40:02] saved if you know you come God's
[1:40:03] provided way you can stand there and say
[1:40:05] I'm saved yeah I'm saved cuz God said
[1:40:09] so then don't start acting like it right
[1:40:13] it's got it settles it forever he said
[1:40:15] they told Abraham said go back where you
[1:40:17] come from you might as well just quit

[1:40:26] back home he said God gave me the
[1:40:27] promise amen he said God will give the
[1:40:30] baby right in the land where he sent me
[1:40:33] God will heal you right in this
[1:40:34] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost where he
[1:40:37] sent you God will give it to you just
[1:40:38] believe
[1:40:39] it amen he said open up them flu of the
[1:40:42] soul and body senses and conscience just
[1:40:45] let God's words penetrate first take
[1:40:48] that mind there is the Battleground not
[1:40:50] say well if I could feel it if I'd feel
[1:40:53] the glory of God falling oh that has
[1:40:55] nothing to do with it right not a thing
[1:41:00] reason you feel the glory of God many
[1:41:01] times because you've already the
[1:41:02] battle's already been won in the mind
[1:41:05] yeah and then the glory of God comes
[1:41:07] down yeah but the battle in the mind
[1:41:09] open up that mind that's the
[1:41:11] Battleground there's where the battle
[1:41:12] sits in Array right here in the front
[1:41:13] line your mind open up and say every
[1:41:16] doubt church can we say it this morning
[1:41:18] every doubt I doubt my doubts yes
[1:41:25] good so every time the Devil comes to
[1:41:27] you brother Paul and says well you this
[1:41:28] is going to happen or that's going to
[1:41:30] happen I doubt
[1:41:33] that I doubt that very much you tell me
[1:41:36] the bride's going down and they're oh
[1:41:38] you say Well everybody's it's all
[1:41:40] falling apart and nobody believes the
[1:41:41] truth anymore I doubt that come on why
[1:41:45] because he said he'd have a bride
[1:41:46] without spot wrinkle wash in the blood
[1:41:48] of the Lamb you think people don't get
[1:41:50] saved anymore I doubt that why because
[1:41:53] his word is true he's the same yesterday
[1:41:55] today and forever he says you can't be
[1:41:57] rid of that Spirit that's holding on to
[1:41:58] you for so long I doubt that because his
[1:42:01] word said we can be free and live happy
[1:42:03] before the
[1:42:04] father yes sir sir I doubt that Satan is
[1:42:08] right I doubt that he's telling you the
[1:42:10] truth he said nobody loves you I doubt
[1:42:13] that right good he he tries to tell you
[1:42:17] that things are only going to get worse
[1:42:19] I doubt that not for you you're going up
[1:42:22] going
[1:42:24] down your family's never going to be
[1:42:26] saved I doubt that God gave me my
[1:42:31] family something's going to take place
[1:42:33] and I'm doubting my doubts now believing
[1:42:36] God's words here I come Satan
[1:42:38] something's going to take place sure it
[1:42:40] will he said he anoints his servants
[1:42:43] with his Spirit he sends them angels
[1:42:46] angels are messengers now we don't
[1:42:48] understand what we're doing when we hear
[1:42:49] the preaching of the word when brother
[1:42:51] Joel comes by Brother Joel's going to
[1:42:52] preach tonight
[1:42:53] brother Andrew comes by or brother
[1:42:55] Stuart preaches or anybody that we have
[1:42:57] here at the church comes and preaches
[1:42:59] what happens when they come God uses him
[1:43:01] in a unique way but it's more than just
[1:43:03] a man preaching brother brandom taught
[1:43:06] us it was ministering spirits that
[1:43:08] anoint the man to say
[1:43:10] words that's what he said he said are

[1:43:19] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[1:43:21] minister for them who shall be hirs for
[1:43:23] salvation he said now here the Bible

[1:46:21] yesterday
[1:46:23] that's why it's so important what we

[1:46:26] presenting a weakness but a strength
[1:46:29] amen right we don't present a god of
[1:46:33] depression a god of well you maybe if
[1:46:36] you hold on you might make it you could
[1:46:38] be lost any moment we don't present that
[1:46:40] kind of God but we present a god who's
[1:46:42] the stronger man and when he comes in
[1:46:45] and takes possession he cannot be cast
[1:46:49] out there's a revelation there church

[1:50:11] pillar feet were his pillars of fire
[1:50:14] right a rainbow Covenant brother B this
[1:50:15] Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger

[1:50:19] But Here Comes one down from heaven
[1:50:21] rainbow Covenant oh only Christ it could
[1:50:23] be right Hallelujah and he had in his
[1:50:27] hand a little book open and he set his

[1:50:43] dominion over it he set his right foot
[1:50:45] upon the sea his left foot on the earth
[1:50:46] and he cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:50:49] lion Roth when he cried seven Thunders
[1:50:50] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:50:52] Thunders and UT their voices I was about
[1:50:54] to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:50:55] saying unto me seal up those things
[1:50:57] which the seven Thunders UT and write
[1:50:58] them not and the angel which I saw stand
[1:51:00] upon the sea upon the Earth lifted up
[1:51:01] his hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:51:03] liveth forever and ever created heaven
[1:51:04] and things that there in are the sea and
[1:51:06] things which other in that there shall
[1:51:07] be time no longer other words he said
[1:51:09] these things will not be delayed right
[1:51:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:51:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:51:15] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:51:18] finished as he had declared to his
[1:51:20] servants the prophets what did he come

[1:51:25] his house
[1:51:28] yeah

[1:51:39] rejoicing and a come

[1:51:45] his
[1:51:47] house
[1:51:49] hallelujah hallelujah comes down with a
[1:51:52] title seed in his hand to claim his
[1:51:53] attributes something Beyond Pentecost
[1:51:56] thank you right said the word that fell
[1:51:59] on the day of Pentecost will not work
[1:52:00] this day right remember when the word
[1:52:03] fell on the day of Pentecost the spirit
[1:52:04] fell there at Pentecost the original
[1:52:06] that seed had to go into the ground
[1:52:08] right it was predestined to go into the
[1:52:10] ground he said that won't work in this
[1:52:12] day no sir that was for Pentecost this
[1:52:13] is for the bride going home in the bride
[1:52:15] we got something different the Pentecost
[1:52:18] has represented that again we're in the
[1:52:19] bride age yes sir he taught us that Mary
[1:52:21] was not the seed she was the shut she
[1:52:24] was not the seed Mary was not just a
[1:52:26] shut tassel and sto carriers are part of
[1:52:28] the word not all the word Luther had
[1:52:29] justification wesle had sanctification
[1:52:31] Pentecostals and the restoration of the
[1:52:33] gifts but when the word came glory to
[1:52:36] God he says when you come to say I am my
[1:52:38] father or one these other things that
[1:52:39] shut pulls away from it but the real
[1:52:42] genuine how many real genuine bride do
[1:52:44] we have here this morning the real
[1:52:45] genuine bride church will bring forth
[1:52:48] the entire word of God yes
[1:52:53] Hallelujah in what in its fullness right
[1:52:57] and in its
[1:52:58] strength good Hallelujah the stronger
[1:53:03] one has come that's why demons start
[1:53:04] acting
[1:53:06] up that's why they get cast out cuz the
[1:53:10] stronger one come
[1:53:11] by Hallelujah and he showed us in a
[1:53:14] prophet what he could do in a bride body
[1:53:17] that's right are you hearing me
[1:53:20] Church through the ministry of a prophet
[1:53:22] he showed us what he would do like a
[1:53:24] first fruit of the Resurrection he
[1:53:25] showed us as Jesus was the first fruit
[1:53:27] of the Resurrection he raised Jesus as
[1:53:28] the wave sheep that raised in our
[1:53:30] generation and the Word was waved over
[1:53:32] the people again and said he's the same
[1:53:34] yesterday today and
[1:53:36] forever
[1:53:37] hallelujah
[1:53:39] hallelujah he said I come to do the will
[1:53:41] of him that sent me he said there was
[1:53:43] the seed he said which one of you can
[1:53:45] condemn me of unbelief I'm skipping down
[1:53:47] because I don't have time he said God
[1:53:49] has verified that through me he said who
[1:53:50] can tell now but the seed and Mary the
[1:53:53] shuck it was close to being that but it
[1:53:54] wasn't it was still in the womb in the
[1:53:56] Pentecostal age over the Lutheran age
[1:53:58] through the Lutheran age through the
[1:53:59] westan age it's been the same through
[1:54:00] this Pentecostal age but notice that the
[1:54:03] opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10
[1:54:06] the full word someone say that with me
[1:54:07] the full word is to be born into
[1:54:11] manifestation again when was it born the
[1:54:13] first time in Bethlehem right are you
[1:54:16] with me now the full word God in
[1:54:19] flesh was born in the manifestation now
[1:54:22] the full word is to be born into
[1:54:23] manifestation again and is Vindicated by
[1:54:26] the spirit of God in the full strength
[1:54:29] as it was when he was here on Earth
[1:54:34] right so has the stronger one come come
[1:54:37] on Church according to the message of
[1:54:39] the hour who has com in our day the
[1:54:41] stronger man has come by there's nothing
[1:54:44] we should be afraid of the stronger one
[1:54:48] come by manifesting the same way doing
[1:54:50] the same things he did when it was here
[1:54:51] on Earth he Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the
[1:54:53] same yesterday today and forever St Luke
[1:54:55] 17:30 in the last days it wasn't the
[1:54:57] days of Sodom when the son of man be
[1:54:59] revealing himself again it'll be the
[1:55:00] same thing the world in a Sodom
[1:55:02] condition the church has went into Sodom
[1:55:03] with it like lot and his wife and I say
[1:55:06] that there is an elected church
[1:55:08] somewhere in this world that's pulling
[1:55:10] out and set aside from those things and
[1:55:12] the manifestation of God has attracted
[1:55:14] its
[1:55:16] attention oh I'm preaching with
[1:55:18] everything I got this morning the
[1:55:20] stronger man has come down to claim his
[1:55:23] house

[1:55:29] know what's got into me I always

[1:55:34] not
[1:55:39] happening Brother Bron said where the
[1:55:41] carcass is the Bible says where the E
[1:55:42] where the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:55:44] gathered together brother Brandon
[1:55:46] repeats that he said Pentecostal said
[1:55:49] there's going to be a great thing

[1:55:51] they don't know it
[1:55:53] that's it yes sir for where the carcass

[1:56:14] that's not the purpose of what we're
[1:56:16] doing we Elevate the ministry of Christ
[1:56:19] in our day because we believe Christ
[1:56:22] came in our day and had something to say
[1:56:27] when he come it wasn't just a sign but a
[1:56:28] voice follows a sign so we Elevate that
[1:56:31] because in elevating that it tells us
[1:56:33] there's something in US yeah right ye
[1:56:35] are of God Little Children John said and
[1:56:38] have overcome them because greater
[1:56:41] someone say greater greater is he that
[1:56:44] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:56:46] how can the strong man keep possession
[1:56:48] of his house this morning if greater is
[1:56:50] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:56:53] world oh Church you don't have to be
[1:56:55] afraid of devils you don't have to be
[1:56:57] afraid of death itself oh death Paul
[1:56:59] said where is your sting oh grave where
[1:57:02] is your Victory the stronger man came by
[1:57:04] and took the sting out of
[1:57:06] death Hallelujah the brand said here is
[1:57:09] the secret the musicians go ahead and
[1:57:11] come the word is in the bride as it was
[1:57:13] in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:57:15] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:57:17] the word she performs the command of the
[1:57:19] word in his name for she has thus sayeth
[1:57:22] the Lord that don't sound like a weak
[1:57:24] powerless bunch of people can't even
[1:57:26] preach no more right come on Church
[1:57:28] sitting around can't even get together
[1:57:29] no more scared to have church hiding in
[1:57:31] their little H somewhere that's not what
[1:57:33] God called he called you to be a mighty
[1:57:35] Army he called you to be a people that
[1:57:37] performs the command of the word in his
[1:57:39] name for she has thus sayith the Lord
[1:57:42] and the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:57:44] it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:57:45] planted and water it comes to full
[1:57:47] Harvest serving his purpose those in the
[1:57:51] bride do only his will yeah no one can
[1:57:54] make them do otherwise why the stronger
[1:57:57] man has come by taking
[1:58:01] possession they have thus say the Lord
[1:58:03] they keep still they know that it has to
[1:58:04] be God in them doing the works
[1:58:07] fulfilling his own
[1:58:11] word listen to this now as we close he
[1:58:14] did not complete all his
[1:58:17] work while in his Earthly
[1:58:20] Ministry so now he works Works in and
[1:58:23] through the
[1:58:25] bride Hallelujah she knows that it was
[1:58:30] not yet time for him to do certain
[1:58:32] things that he must now do what are
[1:58:36] those things brother been speaking
[1:58:37] tongues run around the church that's
[1:58:39] part of it but what of the things that
[1:58:41] he has not have not yet been
[1:58:43] fulfilled that's we've seen that what

[1:58:59] do but he will now fulfill through the
[1:59:02] bride that work which he left for this
[1:59:07] specific
[1:59:10] time that song I thought of that old

[1:59:15] because Legion come by and and he'd
[1:59:18] never there' never been anyone greater
[1:59:20] and he had to say when when Jesus left
[1:59:22] that place he said there's no one

[1:59:27] woman at the
[1:59:28] well oh church when she stood there and
[1:59:31] had many husbands and and he revealed
[1:59:33] The Secret of her heart and she'd come
[1:59:35] back forgiven and she went testified she
[1:59:37] lost all her shinness and everything
[1:59:39] else and she went and began to worship
