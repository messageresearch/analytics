tonight let's power heads together heavenly father such a privilege to be in your house one more time and to thank you for that redemption power that only you could give that you placed within us or to change our nature to change what we were and to transform us into sons and daughters of god we would not be conformed to this world but that we would be transformed by the renewing of our mind lord would you do that tonight lord just continue to renew our mind by your word we thank you for it well lord i pray that we would accept it there would be no spirit of rebellion or spirit of fear or or something that would keep us from wholly embracing your word but lord that we would believe that it is you lord that is speaking to us tonight we ask and we pray lord if there's one that's sick among us i pray you'd heal them lord give us everything that we have need of and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor we pray in jesus name amen amen i sure appreciate that song i am redeemed to tell them i am redeemed amen we're going to read from genesis chapter 49 verse 27 and then deuteronomy chapter 33 verse 12. this will be our final installment of the series on the family curse breaking the family curse on the tribe of benjamin i trust that you've gotten something out of this but we're going to review these scriptures genesis 49 12 27 deuteronomy 33 and 12. and then also we'll read romans 11 and 1. that's a new scripture romans 11 and 1 genesis 49 27 deuteronomy 33 12 and romans 11 and 1 i'll give you a minute to get there i was trying to preach without my monitor tonight so my voice cutting out a little bit i'm trying to get used to it i got to go overseas and do without that stuff and uh we're going to egypt and we just got the books printed by the joel i forgot to show you the picture we got the books printed over there and and so thank god for that the word is powerful it's sharper than a two-edged sword i believe the word of the hour is is powerful it it'll do something and if we can just get it in the language of the people and then uh let the word come to them and then also as we said sunday with the with the fivefold ministry and how god uses that to uh to expose the word to the people to bring it to them and how will we hear without a preacher and so that's what we want to do tonight we believe that god wants to open the word to us but to do that we have to be receptive to the word it doesn't do us any good to sit here or to stand here tonight unless we're receptive to what we're reading so when we read we're reading now the word of god genesis 49 and 27 it said benjamin shall raven as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil so this was the birth path that benjamin was born under this was what they were destined if you could say it that way to do and to be and then in deuteronomy 33 12 we see another birth path for benjamin benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders then i like romans 11 1 where paul is coming back and he's explained how that the true circumcision is by faith and that's how we're circumcised from the flesh is by faith and but he comes back in romans 11 he said i say then hath god cast away his people he said god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin he said god saved me god changed me if he can change me he can he can bring deuteronomy 33 12 out of what was genesis 49 27. amen that's the story of our life isn't it amen god bless you you could be seated pray for that at the end of the service a prayer request you know there was something in the tribe of benjamin as we've talked about it that god could use but if left unchecked it would become destructive and i think that's true of any of us there's something about your nature that god can use but he don't want to leave you like you are because every one of us came to the earth born in sin shapen in iniquity and so god can't use us just like we are there has to be a a transformation that takes place whether we like it or not though god makes us who we are for a purpose he made us and brother billy made you and he made sister karen he made me he made each one of us the way that we are and there's value in that i don't want to uh you to think that well god just has to change my personality he's got to change everything about me but what he actually does is he makes us a new creature but that new creature is not a complete destruction of the old and you'll find that taught if you go back and listen to the sermon a future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the and the earthly bride you'll find that brother branham teaches us that the earth was an attribute of god how many know that tonight the earth is an attribute of god and so if the earth is an attribute of god he said you're a part of the earth your your body is made up of the dust of the earth and so you therefore are an attribute of god more than just the there's a seed of god within you spiritually but you're an attribute of god and so god doesn't destroy his attributes but what does he do he comes and he remakes it he he burns up the atmospheres of it what did god do to you and for you brother jt when he saved you he didn't just do away with jt he didn't take away the way you necessarily the way you said words and he didn't turn you into a tall dark and handsome individual but what did he do to jt he took the atmospheres of your life and he burned it up right and that's what needs to happen to us that's how you break the family curse that's how you that's how you become something different what god actually intended for you to be in the first place so he doesn't take gabe and make him something different but he makes gabe the way he wants him to be right without the without all these curses that come in the family without all the the hindrances of the past without all the without all the years and years that satan has worked maybe in your family to try to make it a certain way and god will bring it back to what it's supposed to be amen and one day we'll be in a body that's the way it's supposed to be not just the not just this but even that body it won't be something different it'll be you the way you were meant to be are you with me tonight so i want us to find value in who we are and yet realize that we must be born again in order to become who he wants us to be you don't want us to be cookie cutters and all be copies of someone else he don't want me as a preacher as a pastor to be a copy of somebody else he wants me to be me he wants you to be you right he wants you to be who he called you to be he made you to be who was in his mind for you to be before the foundation of the earth but satan has come and corrupted through the fall and done all of these things but he's bringing you back out of time into eternity again now he's transforming us back to his original purpose he's destroying he destroys the atmosphere of sin in your life and he actually remakes you into a new creature he calls it a new creature a new creation but it is you it's just it's just in uh he takes the uh the same person and he makes a new person now when he does that many times we get confused because we begin to think well you say brother ben i i thought i was saved and then i did something after i got saved after i got filled with the holy spirit i did something that reminds me of who i used to be how many of you have done that we've all we can all be honest and say i've done things that remind me maybe i don't smoke or drink anymore i don't do drugs i don't do those things but yet at some point i i did something i said oh god and quickly i repented but i thought i i i you know that here that's who my family is that's not me that that's not who you made me to be and so i think and many times people come and they'll say well i thought i got saved i thought i was filled with the holy ghost young people do this so come to an altar and and be just full of the holy ghost and leave him and then they'll go out and and they'll find themselves attracted to the wrong thing or or there'll be a wrong spirit come on them and they'll repent of it but the the shame that comes with it because well i thought i was different but see you still have the same things that you have to deal with right you still have the same weaknesses in many ways but now there's a control tower there now there's a man running the ship now you're not wandering across the ocean by yourself but there's a captain in the ship so now it's the time that you can call on god and say god i know you're in charge so we shouldn't get discouraged when we act like a pruitt and you put your own family name in there right and yet we should not make that the standard are you with me now or we're called to the scripture we're called to be the word right so we so he's making us that now with there's nine spiritual gifts that is given to the church and this kind of teaching tonight but just to kind of wrap these things up and and and hopefully be done tonight but there's nine spiritual gifts that are given to the church and those gifts are the ability to do something right to speak in tongues or or different gifts that are given to the church to prophesy and those are spread through the church but then we also find other gifts that are given in ephesians 4 11 that are specific men called to specific places for a specific work and i want to show you how god uses who you are he doesn't destroy that but then he comes and transforms it and and that's what he did with the apostle paul ephesians 4 7 says unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ so we all have a measure of the gift of christ the gift is christ but we all have a measure some a certain amount of ability that he gives us he makes us a certain way wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive he gave gifts unto men now watch now he gives gifts to men and then he gives gifted men right there there are some men that these are predestined offices and i'm going to show you where brother branham makes the difference between that of the nine spiritual gifts he said he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ so if we pass the need for that then we pass the need for edification right so as long as we need edified we need the ministry so god said in the church brother branham said now there's nine spiritual gifts goes in each local body which is tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies and so forth but there is five predestinated offices of the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists that's what god sent in the church he said the holy spirit he said that's an office the holy spirit might fall on one tonight and speak in tongues and the other give the prophecy and so forth and then next night it might be on somebody else and somebody else like that he said that's local gifts in the body to keep us straight so we need those gifts to keep us straight he said but in the church alone five offices apostles means missionaries apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists god sets those in the church he said now let's believe with all of our heart i love this that through these ministering gifts that the great god of heaven will send christ that's how he works he sends the skits he said and through these ministering gifts that he would send christ among us tonight not that we'll see the man the gift but that will see jesus right if you get a gift you think of the giver right you're not it's to make you think of the giver that's why they say it's the thought that counts because it's the giver that you're thinking of and that's what we want to do now again he said as we know there's local gifts of nine gifts in the church but there's offices of the church and god he said that's predestinated or for ordained god has said in the church apostles then prophets and teachers pastors evangelists and so forth that's god's gift set in the church he said then there is nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body i feel like i can't hear myself i know i probably can brother joel but he said there is nine spirits that's what you get when you get all this technology you get used to it he said there is nine spiritual gifts that operate in the local body of believers he said they must be checked by two or three judges before they're given to the church this is very important because we don't just let someone come in here and begin to prophesy write or begin to begin to speak in tongues and with tongues interpretation you understand a person can speak in tongues quietly in prayer and i would have no problem with that but if a person would speak in tongues in the midst of the congregation you would wait on an interpretation but really that should be judged first right because before it's given to the church because sometimes they could be wrong he's but then he goes and he talks about prophets he said notice these prophets they were born he said in jeremiah god said before you was even conceived in your mother's womb i ordained you a prophet over the nations moses was born a prophet on the baptist 712 years before he was born he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness yes isaiah the prophet speaking of him he said see these gifts are born gifts now he's not just talking about a prophet he said these are predestinated gifts born gifts if you're a minister in the fivefold ministry you were born a minister right your mama might not have thought you was one your daddy might not have thought you was one but you were born that way right you couldn't help it that's right now the bible tells us the gifts and calling of god are without repentance the gifts and calling of god are without repentance so paul understood this now as we pick up the story of paul he understood after his conversion that god had called him to be who he was before his conversion so he knew that he he had nothing to do with that god had already called him to be an apostle and see god needed who paul was i want you to understand this tonight and and you're not going to understand this from the baptist church or the methodist church nothing against them but we understand this by the message of the hour you're a gene of god you're a thought of god god thought about you and he made you the way he wanted you right and maybe what he made you and so you think of yourself right now and you say well god must have made me imperfectly but that's not what god made you he made what you could be he put in you he doesn't he doesn't make the fruit tree the apple tree immediately an apple tree but he makes a seed and within it is the ability to be an apple tree and then when it's put in the right atmosphere it'll grow and produce apples right and so god puts something in you and that's something he wants to be expressed in a certain way and so with paul we could say it like this he could say god has not cast away his people god needed his people now think about this as it relates to the israelites for a moment god needed benjamin see he needed benjamin to be that protector and we went into it how that benjamin would be there in the millennium right and be the protector of the king you remember that benjamin would be the protector of the king the scripture says that in the millennium so he's looking all the way down there see god's looking past what's going on right now yes are you hearing me tonight he's looking past what's going on right now he said well i'm sitting on a wednesday night in church and i feel like you know things just aren't going like i thought they would go but god's looking past what's going on right now maybe he needed a mother maybe he needed a housewife maybe he needed a carpenter maybe he needed a factory worker he needs you right he needs you he needs you to be here god could have done it any way he wanted to but he uses people to do it so god needed paul and he needed him to be born in tarsus and he needed him to be raised a certain way and he needed him to be a benjamite are you with me now god don't do anything by accident but not only did god need paul but god needed joel he needed to be born a certain place are you with me now god needed you not just the ministry we'll get to that in just a moment because but the ministry ordering to a certain thing but so are you god needed you he needed a bench of mine he needed somebody who would be a protector of the word but he don't need a ravening wolf he don't need a persecutor so oh my so he drops down when the time is right into paul's life and paul thought he had a pretty good career going on he thought he was a pretty good pharisee he thought he was a pretty good man he thought he was everything he was supposed to be but god dropped down into his life do you remember the moment when god dropped down into your life there come a day when god dropped down into your life and all of a sudden he changed what you were to what you could be and he began to do a work in your life he began to do a work in paul's life and so paul could would go on from that moment and he recognized that god did this i am what i am by the grace of god as we read to you i believe last wednesday night i am what i am by the grace of god so we find whenever paul would introduce himself to the people in his ladders let's look at how he would do that he said it this way in romans he said paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated under the gospel of god all called and separated in first corinthians 1 he said paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother again in ii corinthians 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god notice how he he keeps reminding him i don't think he's just reminding them but he's reminding himself paul you were a pharisee paul you were saul of tarsus you were a persecutor of the church how did he get past that see the great thing to me about paul is not so much that the people would ever accept him because the people saw that jesus had done something in his life but the hardest thing how would he ever accept it right but brother brown said he spent three and a half years in arabia comparing the experience that he had with the word right hallelujah and when he got done oh my that's we need the experience but we need to spend some time take some wednesday nights and compare the experience we have with the word and so he spends three and a half years in arabia comparing his experience with the word and then what what does he do he comes back and he knows god did this i couldn't do it by myself i couldn't make myself an apostle i couldn't make myself a preacher so i can have confidence so he's not like saul remember saul was always worried somebody's going to take my position somebody's going to assert me somebody's going to take over the kingship paul don't have to be like that he said whether they preach a strife or whatever he said some preach wanting to add affliction to my bonds he said but nevertheless christ is preached why can paul be like that why can't he stand there in flamingo and say paul a prisoner of jesus christ why can't he do that because he knows he's bound to do this it wasn't him that did it was god that did it are you with me tonight he knows it had to be predestined by god i hope we would i wish we would get a revelation of that and we wouldn't spend all so much time worrying well maybe i'll miss the rapture maybe i'll i know god called you to something maybe we need to remind ourselves when we write a letter benjamin the seed of god are you with me luella the seed of god the bride of jesus christ the elect of the hour that'll break that curse off of you thinking oh my family i'm the least of the tribe of benjamin i i i come from the least family and then you get all worried and self-conscious about what you're doing oh god i pray that he would break that off of us tonight and we'd begin to step forward and say i am what god made me i can do what god says i can do are you with me tonight yeah and it's not some joel osteen thing where he and i called his name but but you know the man that would stand up there and just we got that satellite radio and he's always on there and peter will turn him on because he he likes to hear that i guess and he'll sit there and just just chuckle you know and he's just concentrating you're called you're you're the elective guardian but he's right but see paul went took his experience number one he had a real experience and then two he took his experience compared it with the word and then he could have confidence he's not just saying it he's not just standing up there and saying you're elected you're called you're chosen but he's standing and saying i'm elected i'm called i'm chosen because god said i was god came down in my life i've seen the pillar of fire i met god on the back side of the desert in a burning bush i've had an experience with god are you with me now paul an apostle by the will of god galatians paul and apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead ephesians 1 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god oh my to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus first timothy paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment he said paul i'm going to show you what you're going to do i'm not going to give you an option because you wouldn't pick you to do it you'd pick somebody else the church wouldn't have picked paul paul wouldn't have picked paul but god chose paul and so paul has to come out and say i'm an apostle not by the commandment of man but by the commandment of god i didn't take my position because i got all the men in the message to agree this was that you would be a good pastor of that church you'd be good no i am what i am by the grace of god you are what you are by the grace of god we don't bring people through a some kind of a a a place a a cemetery as brother branham calls it a seminary where we begin to graduate them out and then we pick a church for them that's not what we do in the message of the hour what do we do we watch a man's life and and we see what's going on within how he struggles and what he does and and and how he's how he how he ministers and what his ministry is you watch it it becomes self-evident and through the the fire you throw him in the fire and see what he does and through the fire of life it produces something in his life where he can become a pastor become a leader are you with me now or become an evangelist there's nothing special in that sense about the pastor he could be any of these five gifts or for that matter any member of the bride you don't just become a deacon because i said you were one you don't just become a a prayer warrior because i said you were one you become that through the fires of life and god worked that in your life until that's the gift that began to manifest in your life you understand you went through the fire of life and it was revealed there was gold in there oh my amen that ought to give us confidence to do whatever job we've been called to i can look at you and say i think you're a good deacon i think you're i think we have wonderful deacons i'm so glad to see what god's doing among us but i think we have wonderful song leaders but i can't just look at you and say this is what you're going to be you got to be called to that on some level and again not all those gifts are predestined gifts sometimes god could use you for a while and then set you down but these predestined gifts are born that way you understand now so that's why a deacon is not necessarily a lifelong thing although for brother danny it's approaching that but it's not necessarily a life sentence right because you might be called to that for a season right but a minister of the gospel if he's an evangelist if he's a pastor now his ministry may change but the gift that he has was always there whatever he was ultimately meant to be was always there so he says i'm gonna i'm an apostle by the will of god by the commandment of god he said paul a servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god gillette i love that and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness so god called me to be this and so he was adamant again we've been over this but in galatians he was adamant that his gospel was not from man not even from himself he said i didn't make this up see if you made up your gospel then your gospel is only as strong as you are and if you can't change your body i don't want to hear a made-up gospel that you made up because you can't you can't change it who you are but this this gospel will change our bodies one day how will it do that if i made it up it's not going to happen but if i believe the word hey man one day it's going to change my body i believe in a supernatural god right who has a supernatural word and so paul said i didn't make it up i didn't get it from just myself and he said that he uses the reason for that he says because you know what i was he said you've heard of my conversation or my lifestyle in time past in the jewish religion that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jewish religion above many my equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace see this isn't about us it's not about well i figured it out i made it up no paul said i didn't figure it out i didn't make it up but it would the revelation i got matched the word because god had pleased god to reveal his son in me supernaturally that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither when i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned to get into damascus what was it to compare his experience with the word amen because god's the true experience will always compare with the word and but so we got it from god he said and get it from myself it's important salvation doesn't come from us right it comes from god paul was always an apostle he just didn't know it but now see then after he realizes that now he can't boast about being one all right because he is the proverbial turtle on a fence post right the turtle's on the fence post he can't he didn't get there by himself he can't climb there nothing he can do to get there oh my that's the way we are church that's the position we stand in today by the grace of god i i can't make myself a believer i can't make you a believer but i'm here i believe and you believe why because god placed us here and put within us something that could believe now again he couldn't boast about it he said in first corinthians 9 16 though i preached the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea he said woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel yes so it's not that i want to i can't not right i'm afraid to not preach that's why you won't tell a real god-called man that not to preach anymore not to stand in the pulpit and preach you can't tell a god called man that right he'll find somewhere to preach because there's something inside of him you know he said if i do this thing willingly i have a reward some of us are not very willing to preach are we brother allen some of us are not willing but if we do it willingly he said there's a reward for that but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me and so he's saying i was the only one who could do it that's where you want to be in a place that god creates for you that you're the only one that fits that place you understand you're the only one that fits in that marriage you're not replaceable you with me yeah you're the only one that fits right where you do in the church you're not replaceable that's why we don't hop around jump from place to place and pillar to post we're not replaceable are you with me and again god may call you to a certain season to a certain thing and move you but you'll fit where you are you belong somewhere because you're in the mind of god god don't do anything haphazardly and so you sit there and you worry oh am i doing what uh am i am i able to do anything i'm just useless in the church you're never useless you're here for a reason you're here for a reason i excuse me for digressing tonight but we'll get over it i've got six minutes left is what i've got on here but it may be a few more minutes than that but we uh you know every person in this church there's a there's a reason for you right there's a reason there's a purpose for you it matters it matters that you're here and i don't mean just necessarily in the building although that matters too but it matters that you're in the church it matters that you're a part of the church even the little ones it matters wyatt's sitting over there and jason and melody and the other young ones that sit and the young ones in the back and the ones that that come it matters that they're in the church right it matters that millie's in the church and the ones that have joined us and and several of you weren't here two years ago when we come and it's been two years now as of a couple of weeks ago i believe it's been two years since i've been the pastor here and during that time a lot of things have changed and several of you are new but it matters that you're here what would we do i think so many times at different ones and think what would i do without a brother danny or brother harvey or or brother gabe or or brother joel or or or any one of you that are sitting here and i don't want to leave any of you out because some of you don't do much in the actual service what would i do without brother harold i think what would i do without brother harold being here and and i think about that and i think god you put him here and and there must be a reason why he's here right and what would i do without sister fritz back there and she's expressed to me before she don't want to be where she's not doing anything because she's always done something for the gospel and she feels useless when she's not working and so she wants to print my address labels and do things and and do things for me in the church and i thank god for that but that's not what makes you useful sister fritz says the fact that you're here it shows us that that there's a dedication in your heart i think about the story someone told there's a they said this this lady that was deaf she went to church and she never heard a thing and they asked her they said why do you bother going to church you can't hear and she said but i just want the devil to know which side i'm on so it matters that you're here it matters don't let the devil beat you up and say well i i come from a bad family i've come through a hard time i i've been through many struggles and it don't matter it seems like nobody ever notices me but god notices you he sees you and you have a reward for doing what god wants you to do are you with me now and so but but now to paul he said there was a dispensation place to me i couldn't help but be who i am i've got to do what you call me to do how many ever felt like that i didn't necessarily want to be in this message but god called me to this message i can't do anything different than this message are you with me now this word is who i am it's part of me it's predestined other people don't understand that but it's predestined to me amen i'm just preaching to you tonight but just now so paul says where is my what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel without charge and so paul would do extra things he'd make tents and give the money back to the church even though he goes through a list and says the ministry should live by the offering but he does that because you don't want to abuse his power in the gospel and we've been over that but he does and he does that though so because he feels like i want a reward and i can't get a reward for being an apostle because god made me an apostle are you with me now jeremiah experienced the same thing in jeremiah 29 jeremiah took a lot of heat for preaching what he preached because every one of jeremiah's sermon was sermons was hellfire and brimstone it was he got up he was the weeping prophet he got up and preached the babylonians are coming you just need to surrender actually threw him in jail over it and they persecuted him over it but guess what he was right but jeremiah stood there because he said you sinned in the and the babylonians are coming and he said okay i'm not going to preach anymore he said i'll not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones i was weary with forbearing i could not stay god did that god made you who you are not because you wanted to or you willed it or you made it up god pulled you and dragged you and pushed you and propped you up and set you on the fence posted here he is amen who set the city on the hill right you ever think about that i didn't until just now who set the city on a hill god did he said a city set on a hill can't be hid why is the city on a hill god put him on the hill amen god put him on a hill god put you where you are to shine in the age that you're in are you with me now god did that brother branham tell us it's in things that are to be it's very common quote and you've heard me say it many times but he said in my father's house there's many kinds of mansions he said i don't believe that when we get to heaven we'll be just everybody look just exactly alike i don't believe that we'll all be brought blondes or brunettes or little or big or giants my brother monroe champion if you're listening tonight brother monroe god bless you i'm glad and maybe maybe he would listen sometime and i know he's told me he has but monroe was a good friend of mine but mother monroe had a doctrine or an idea he believed his faith was that he was going to be six foot tall and have blonde hair and be perfect weight and proportioned and everything like that when he gets over there so that's what it's the off and he looked like and i had a problem with that because i think god made me perfect in his eyes thank you for reminding me but we are perfect in god's eyes but that'd be wonderful you think well but the thing is i told him i said you know you and me would look exactly alike if we got over there you couldn't even tell god's a god of variety he don't want us to look exactly alike so when we get there we're not going to be a bunch of robots right and all looking and acting and i'll have the same personality wouldn't that be dull see when you get to heaven you're still going to have your personality brother harvey's going to be taking water bottles and saving them and it's still going to be you all right but david's still going to be a fireball some of you are going to you're still going to be you do you understand tonight you're still going to be you i'm still going to be me praise god but we'll be a perfect version of that thank god he said i believe god is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety amen some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine he said others are kind you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom and he talks about how you can't compare peter to andrew and we went over that how different they were in their makeup and then he talked about paul and how scholarly that he was and how he thought differently than these others but god made him that way god wanted him that way notice he said many mansions many kinds of mentions like many kinds of hills many kinds of rivers springs lakes they were here when you come here first because the kindness amen of your heavenly father placed them here he talked about mountains and rivers and plains and he said god unloaded his mortar box for me he said so i could have mountains but other men would look at that and say he said it's just two different natures but we'll both be in heaven right he said but the father knew that you would be here well here's the important part he said and prepared everything for you before you got here he said amen your first coming here he had it ready for you when you got here that's how predestined you are just how predestined am i well the world was prepared for you before you got here hallelujah god made hardy arkansas or whatever it is that that you've found contentment and and lived in your life god made that for you are you hearing me now the kindness of your heavenly father put it here he said you your father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here you had it ready for you when you got here and so we find then that not all of us fit into ephesians 4 11 because those are predestined gifts men who are gifts in the body but all of us do fit into romans 8 28 where he said all things someone say all things all things work together even your family background amen that's included in all even your genes even the even the wars even the struggles amen even the trials oh we ought to worship a god like that even the struggles of life he made you that way amen we are the called we are all called for a purpose he said for them that love god to them or the called according to his purpose brother branham speaks again of prophets he said the man who's seen the vision or heard his voice never altogether understood it many cases he didn't know now that's scriptural because he's just an instrument of god it's god's thoughts expressed through a man's lips moses said there'll be a prophet like me he may not even know what he was talking about david said my hands are pierced my hands and feet they pierced he didn't even know what he was he thought he was talking about himself they rent my garments he didn't know why he was saying it that's what brother branham taught us he said it's god's thoughts expressed through man's lips because a thought is a word expressed god does his own choosing by his predestinated choosing he done it in every age he set forth the man for each age he said like when moses when he was to fulfill what he told to abraham moses was born a proper child can i have a few more minutes tonight sorry i just i need to finish this and be done with it he said he was born that way because he was born for that purpose and so we find out that god does that in every age watch god does his own choosing by his own predestinated choosing chooses prophets and things for the age fixes his nature the man's nature the man's style of preaching on their gift and all that he does just to meet the challenge of that day oh my god that's why paul and brother branham were so similar in their approach but yet so different right because paul was called to the first church age brandon was called to the last church age you've had different pastors that different men in different areas they're different right god calls a man to to meet the challenge of that time you can say the challenge of that church are you with me now not that you're a challenge to me but you understand the ministry itself is a challenge satan is challenging us today but god calls a man to that challenge so it doesn't do me any good to whine about it and gripe about it oh i'm preaching it myself now oh like moses all the people the people you know all these people they just murmur and complain but then when god said okay i'll just do away with him he said lord yes take me instead the people you know are can be a challenge the place can be a challenge but god called you to it your family might be a challenge but god called you to that challenge your marriage might be a challenge but god called you to that challenge are you with me now he did not he didn't call you to meet an enemy that you can't defeat i shouldn't have put that in marriage together but but he didn't call you to a challenge that you couldn't win or you hear me tonight but god creates the man and sent him he said in his own mind he said we are a germ of the gene of god he knew that man would be there at that age he knew that man would be there at that age before there ever was a molecule or a light or anything else in the earth and so it's not just preachers because he goes on to say that if you are a son of god how many sons of god do we have or a daughter of god how many daughters of god do we have to meet the challenge of this hour he said manifested son or daughter of god he said he knew what bed and time you'd be planted you're in god all the time he knew what bed and time you were planted but now you're made a creature a son of god manifested son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour glory the message that's coming forth in this time god don't do things like we do he needed paul to be born in tarsus and i'll just go over these things quickly before we close he needed paul to be born in tarsus a city hat that had a roman arena in it think about it he couldn't be born in jerusalem he had to be trained in jerusalem but he couldn't be born there you say oh you don't know what's trouble he couldn't be born there because he would say things like this he'd say he'd say run the race with patience he said runners that running a race he said they they they strip aside everything they lay aside every weight why do we have those scriptures because paul was born close enough to a roman arena that he could see it i keep under my body bring it under subjection a boxing metaphor because here was a young man that was educated and wealthy enough he could go to the games we miss we we don't understand god sometimes he needed him to be a roman citizen because he had to go and stand in front of caesar and one of the most wicked rulers that's ever been can you imagine what he must have felt like brother david one day that nero had seen a lot of things he was one of the most wicked men that's ever lived and he stood there that day and paul oh my here comes this little jew in front of him he said what's this man doing here well he's a roman citizen and every roman citizen has a right to stand before nero get his head chopped off but that's why they couldn't crucify him because he was a roman citizen they couldn't crucify citizens so he had a right to stand there because god for some reason nero won't have an excuse the man who oh god you think god's not merciful yeah he chose to have the gospel preached to the man who took christians put oil and tar on them and put them up as torches in his garden and god sent paul to that man he said brother ben you're wasting your time preaching to those people you're wasting your time preaching to that person trying to reach that person god sent paul to preach to him he had to preach to nero amen in acts chapter 21 and verse 37 this is kind of how it came about that he would end up in rome because they would have killed him right there the jews wanted to kill him and and so there was a great chaos going on they were trying to kill him and the romans come and god him the soldiers and as paul was to be led into the castle he said to the chief captain he said may i speak unto thee he said can you speak greek he didn't expect him to be able to how why could he speak greek because he was raised in tarsus he said are you not that egyptian which made an uproar and led out in the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers it's funny how people they get the joel osteens and the many hens but they don't ever see the truth and this man missed jesus and he said you're that egyptian because there was an egyptian that come before jesus that made an uproar and led into the wilderness 4 000 men that were murderers but all they see is the false that's what the world sees but paul said i'm a man which i'm a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia he that's who he was he wasn't denying who he was he said a citizen of no mean city i come from a big city may not look like it i may be ragged and beaten and bloody but i come from a big city i come from tarsus a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people when he had given him license paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand and of the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them now in the hebrew tongue saying men brethren and fathers hear my defense which i make now unto you and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue he had to be born in tarsus he had to be raised in jerusalem he spent eight years under gamaliel he spoke hebrew oh my they kept the more silence they listened to him because he spoke to them in their own time god calls this man for a reason he said i'm verily a man which i'm a jew again he reminds them i'm a jew i was born in tarsus the city and cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as you all are this day but i challenge you to go and read the rest of the chapter because brother adam said every time paul gets in a tight spot he goes back to his conversion because being born in tarsus could only go so far being born in cilicia could only go so far being taught at the feet of gamalia would only gain you so much favor but he said i was didn't stop there amen he said i was taught i knew the law but the law couldn't make a change in my life the law couldn't change the binge of mine the law couldn't make me into what god wanted me to be but i met god one day on the damascus road how many could say amen to that tonight i met god he said i was just like you i was jealous toward god him and notice how he used to he was to appeal to them and yet he could not place confidence in who he was or what he had learned he told them about his conversion amen he told him about the supernatural if you don't believe in the supernatural you're in a sorry shape because any idea can be talked out of you he comes always comes back to the supernatural the pillar of fire that appeared to him he said finally my brethren in philippians 3 1 rejoice in the lord this is at the end now of his life he said to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe i hate preaching the same thing over and over and sometimes i feel like i tell you the same things read the same scriptures and paul said it's he said it it's easy for me to do that he said but for you it's safe in other words you need to hear it you need to be reminded rejoice in the lord how many times did he say that he told him he said beware of dogs beware of evil workers be aware of the concision the dogs he was speaking of was the judaizers that's right beware of the concision those who would separate themselves from the body he said for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence this is where i'm closing this evening you have no confidence in the flesh see god made me who i am but that's not where i put my confidence are you with me now whether i had a good home or a bad home that's not where i put my confidence god brought me up a certain way but i don't put my confidence in that but i put it in a supernatural birth amen he said though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man think if he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i'm more he said you think you've got a way to trust the flesh he said i do he said i was circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisees concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yay dallas i count all things say all things all things all the things i've been through all of my past but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done use this very strong language that i may win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is to the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith i love this that i may know him and the power of his resurrection the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means somehow detained unto the resurrection of the dead he said my pharisaic law who i was being taught by gamalia being one of the smartest men in the world on the fast track to be the high priest he said that won't get me anywhere when it comes to change of the body not as though i had already attained either we're already perfect but i follow after let me say amen to this tonight that i may apprehend that for which i also am apprehended so he says i'm not just sitting there and believing in in in fatalism predestination is not fatalism there is a difference i'm going to apprehend that for which i am apprehended right so i'm pressing what he's already pressed for are you with me now the cross of christ makes me pick up my cross they say that the iranians have the highest level of accidents the most accidents in the world is in iran and the reason for that is because they believe allah wills all things and so they if they get in an accident a wreck and the daughter gets killed or someone gets killed allah wills it so it's fatalism so they don't even bother to drive carefully that's a fact they don't bother i see we don't live like that that i may apprehend i i take i persevere i press that for which also i am apprehended i couldn't apprehend unless i was already apprehended unless he had grabbed a hold of me i couldn't grab a hold of him to put it in arkansas language brethren i count not myself to have apprehended see i i may apprehend there's something more a body change a rapture he said but this one thing i do forgetting those things oh god forgetting who i was forgetting what i did forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before i press toward the mark here he's using the imagery from the running from the races that he's seen as the last moment they would stretch out stretch out like a runner in baseball diving into the base i pressed toward the mark toward the finish line for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be mature as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you'd be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you musicians go ahead and come we're to have no confidence in the flesh so we we press forward we keep under our body that's why paul can understand grace like nobody else can you get it you see it paul understands grace like nobody else because the re he has grace therefore he works god couldn't have called any other man but paul to preach the message of grace listen when paul told of his translation into the third heaven he also let us know that something in his body wasn't right we don't know what it was but the brandon said it was perhaps his eyes in other places he talked like it wasn't but we know he had bad eyes because he talks in galatians about how he has to write when he writes his own letters many times he dictated them but when he had to write his own letters he had to write in big letters because he couldn't see he had a thorn in the flesh he asked god three times to take it away and brother branham even dwells on that and says he you know he didn't just he didn't just say well it's the will of god he asked him to take it away and god gave him an answer he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness can we say it this way my strength is made perfect in who who have made you to be and sometimes he allows us to be a little bit of ourselves are you hearing me he lets a little bit of that family tree creep through a little bit of that no no i'm not talking about sin now i'm just talking about just the way we were and that kind of creeps in and we think oh god that's not what i'm supposed to be but he wants to remind you who you are so that the glory won't rest on you but it'll rest on him he said most gladly therefore he said for my grace is sufficient for thee he said for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities so he said i'm going to boast about something not about being an apostle i love this he said i'm not going to boast about being an apostle or sitting under the feet of gamaliel or being he's not just a fact he didn't try to hide it it's just what his life was but i'm not going to boast about that what am i going to boast about my weaknesses but he wasn't out there saying oh i go down to the bar and drink on friday nights bless god i have grace in my life it's not what he's saying in spite of my eyes or whatever it was the thorn in the flesh in spite of my body in spite of being in prison in spite of being beaten i still bring the message in spite of people living a life in front of us that would turn us away from it but we will come anyway you're in church tonight anyway so you don't glory in your strengths in your gifts but in spite of how my headache i went to church are you hearing me in spite of my struggles in spite of my my bank account i still worship to god i will glory in my infirmities amen that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure what an attitude in infirmities and reproaches what did he do he looked at him and said you got a whip bring it on you're going to lead me for dead bring it on i take pleasure in the fact that they tried to kill me and couldn't i take pleasure in the fact that a snake bit me but i shook it off are you hearing me tonight you're gonna have to come back and listen to this again not because i said it but i know you're tired i take pleasure in the fact that i'm still here i take pleasure in necessities i wake up in the morning i have no idea where the bread's coming from today but i know he's a provider i wake up there's sickness in my body i'm in need but he's always met my needs some of you are getting older you know what i'm talking about lord i i'm rejoicing in the fact that i woke up this morning i don't feel good but i woke up and i still made my way to the side of the bed and got down on my knees and began to pray and i still came to church and i still as long as i'm able i still even though he was in jail he still managed to write the new testament when i'm weak then i'm strong and the message shalom brother branham calls that the growing pains of grace growing pains of grace would you bow your heads with me tonight i know i put a little bit too much on the plate tonight tried to feed too much hay to do a few cows but if you would just just think about what what the lord is trying to tell us [Music] i'm not bound to be what my genes are [Music] i'm gonna i can apprehend because i am apprehended i can i can become more than my limitations in spite of what the devil has done to me i'm still here i still love him still worshiping he's still my my first love he'll always be a glory in that because that means the power of god rests on me that's the grace of god by his grace i am what i am would you just think about that for a moment as we pray heavenly father maybe there's someone here the devil's tried to get at them in this way to try to make them think well the way i was raised and when i when i come through i i can't be a real christian i but paul stood there and said i i persecuted the church i didn't want to be saved but you saved me anyway lord i had no desire to serve you in this way lord but you came and supernaturally changed my life and put a desire there to make me press toward the mark so he said i'll rejoice in that oh god help us to do that tonight help us to rejoice in our infirmities i know it's difficult paul reminded them of that over and over again rejoice in all things again i say rejoice he said it's necessary for me to remind you it's good for you to be reminded rejoice in my infirmities because when i'm weak i'm strong because i'm still here still serving god i pray you'd help the people or those that are watching tonight those that are sick and in need lord we have this prayer request that was put here for tim andrews dad is battling cancer he had surgery and put a rod in his leg bone and the mass is so large it could break the bone and they're worried about that surgery oh god would you come down right now lord there's this little family tim in chicago that you'd bless that family lord do something lord as your presence we believe is here would you just do something for that family lord and that that man lord would recognize that you did it i pray you'd grant it today lord we know that you're a healer we know you're the same yesterday today and forever i pray god that you just move in a mighty way in every one of our lives as we worship you lord as we go about our business our jobs may we recognize that you are the same yesterday today and forever you're the same in our weaknesses as our strengths lord you're always with us may we not glory in our gifts lord but in our weaknesses lord our necessities because we're still here we're still fighting we thank you for it we ask these things in your precious name amen thank you lord we just worship the lord now oh i'm amazed that you love me let's stand together and worship him i'm amazed if you can stand oh how you care through your precious love i found pardon oh my oh and my sins are washed can you say amen to that tonight they're all washed away all my sins are washed away i met him on the damascus road oh i'm amazed

lord coming and speaking to us i mean let's just sing just before we go let's sing that song the chorus pressing on and we'll sing this this through one time and then we'll be dismissed if you
