[37:36] during the day or the week, you are
[37:38] still worthy to be praised. And so we
[37:40] bless your name tonight. And we we thank
[37:43] you for making us who we are, for
[37:46] causing us to be here in this place
[37:48] tonight, for giving us all the blessings
[37:50] that you give us, Lord. Even if we find
[37:52] ourselves in a difficult situation,
[37:54] Lord, you we know there's still
[37:56] deliverance ahead and and there's
[37:58] strength that can be found in your word.
[38:00] We thank you for that, Lord. I pray that
[38:02] you'd heal the sick tonight. I pray
[38:04] you'd touch every heart and bless each
[38:07] one. We pray. Move me out of the way,
[38:09] Lord. May you say only those things that
[38:11] need to be said. I pray in Jesus name.
[38:15] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight.
[38:20] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[38:21] the Lord. Good to be back in the pulpit
[38:24] preaching tonight. So, we'll get right
[38:26] into the word of God. Genesis chapter 35
[38:28] and verse 16. Genesis 35:16
[38:38] says, "They journeyed from Bethl,
[38:41] and there was but a little way to come
[38:42] to Ephereth, and Rachel travailed, and
[38:46] she had hard labor. And it came pass
[38:50] when she was in hard labor that the
[38:52] midwife said unto her, "Fear not, thou
[38:54] shalt have this son also." And it came
[38:57] to pass as her soul was in departing,
[38:59] for she died, that she called his name
[39:02] Benoni, but his father called him
[39:05] Benjamin. Pray the Lord would add his
[39:07] blessing to the word. You may be seated
[39:09] this evening. We've come all the way
[39:11] through 12 of Jacob's sons. We've seen
[39:16] the meaning of their name and their
[39:17] aotment in the land.
[39:20] and how the prophecy spoken over them
[39:22] has affected their lives and where they
[39:25] were placed in the natural. And we know
[39:27] that we've been placed in a spiritual
[39:29] land in the same way. This is the last
[39:31] one, Benjamin. Uh and and and I want us
[39:34] to just kind of focus tonight on the
[39:36] fact that our our birth, even our
[39:39] natural birth was pre-planned. Brother
[39:42] Brandham tells us that there's nothing
[39:44] out of cater. Nothing out of cater. We
[39:47] we think things are out of cater and we
[39:50] get nervous sometimes and we get worried
[39:52] and and we think well this is this
[39:54] wasn't right and this happened in my
[39:56] life or or or that happened in my life
[39:58] or maybe it was before you were born
[40:00] things that happened that affect you and
[40:02] it affects you today and you think well
[40:04] there's nothing I can do about that and
[40:06] it must have been some horrible thing
[40:08] that was out of cater says it wasn't out
[40:11] of cater at all in fact it was the
[40:13] actually God working it for your good
[40:16] And so we know that all things Romans
[40:19] 8:28 all things work together for good
[40:23] to them that are called according to the
[40:25] purpose of God. And so we either believe
[40:26] that or we don't. And and and I want us
[40:29] to understand I want all of us to
[40:31] understand especially our youth to
[40:33] understand that even our natural birth
[40:36] was pre-planned and there is an election
[40:39] in our natural birth right that we are
[40:42] elected by our spiritual birth. We are
[40:44] elected. Uh we are elected. There's a
[40:46] seed that's spiritual. Nothing natural
[40:48] about that. But our natural birth was
[40:51] also pre-planned. It wasn't an accident
[40:54] there. There's no such thing. If you're
[40:55] here tonight, you are not an accident.
[40:58] You're not a uh you're not just a a
[41:01] bother to your parents. You're not just
[41:03] a just something that's here that just
[41:06] happened to be here and now they got to
[41:08] now they got to raise you up. But that's
[41:10] not what it is at all. You were actually
[41:12] planned by God to be here. Even in your
[41:15] natural birth, even before you were
[41:17] saved, even before you ever come to
[41:20] church, even before you ever receive the
[41:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost, he had
[41:24] already picked you and pre-planned you
[41:27] and actually elected you to be born in
[41:29] the manner and in the place and at the
[41:31] time that you were born in. Now, now,
[41:34] Brother Brandham tells us, every one of
[41:35] you knows, he said that our birth was
[41:38] pre-planned. He said, "Did you know that
[41:40] your being here never originated just as
[41:43] a myth or a thought?" He said,
[41:45] "Everything." Someone say, "Everything."
[41:49] Was all pre-planned by God before the
[41:52] foundation of the world that you would
[41:55] be here. I believe this will settle us
[41:56] tonight if we could really grab a hold
[41:58] of it that we could really see the word.
[42:00] That's the great thing about the word of
[42:02] God. You know, emotions are fleeting and
[42:04] and we could we can be stirred up and
[42:06] and that that'll pass. And I thank God
[42:08] for that. We want to be stirred up, but
[42:10] the word will settle us and make us
[42:12] realize who we are and who's we are and
[42:15] where we belong. So he said, "Your being
[42:18] here never originated as a myth or a
[42:21] thought." Everything was all pre-planned
[42:23] by God before the foundation of the
[42:24] world that you would be here. So God
[42:27] didn't just have a sudden thought and
[42:28] said, "Oh, I think I'll I think I'll
[42:30] I'll cause this one to be born or that
[42:32] one." No, you were all pre-planned
[42:34] before the world was ever formed. He
[42:36] taught us that the natural birth is by
[42:39] election. Right? Because how else would
[42:42] that particular germ meet that
[42:44] particular egg,
[42:46] right? There there's no way, brother
[42:48] Rand said it's a greater mystery even
[42:49] than the virgin birth. He said the
[42:52] natural birth because of how that it
[42:55] comes together. And he said there is an
[42:57] intelligence behind all of this. He said
[43:00] otherwise what determines whether the
[43:02] baby is a boy or girl? Right? And that's
[43:05] why we don't changed that, right? Right.
[43:09] Only boys can be the fathers. Only girls
[43:12] can be the mothers, right? And there was
[43:14] an intelligence that determined whether
[43:18] you were a boy or a girl, blonde or
[43:22] brunette. I know like people like to go
[43:25] changing their hair color and that's up
[43:27] to you. But but God chose you to be the
[43:30] color that you are. Skin color, hair
[43:33] color, right? He chose that. Blonde or
[43:37] brunette, light or dark type of eyes,
[43:40] etc. Now, so God chose you to be that
[43:44] way. You say, "Oh, I'm so ugly." Well,
[43:46] God chose you to be like that, so it
[43:49] must not have been too ugly, right? But
[43:52] maybe sometimes we just need our
[43:54] thoughts to match the thoughts of God.
[43:57] So, Brother Brandon makes a striking
[43:59] statement in the church age book. He
[44:01] said, "With these thoughts in mind,
[44:03] think about Joshua and Caleb." He said,
[44:05] "Did not Jesus say in John 6:49, "Your
[44:08] fathers did eat mana in the wilderness
[44:10] and are dead." So, he's speaking to
[44:12] people that were standing in that time,
[44:15] and he said, "Your fathers ate mana in
[44:18] the wilderness and are dead." Your
[44:20] fathers, he said, "Those parents that
[44:23] died were necessary." Those parents that
[44:28] died were necessary as the forefathers
[44:31] of the people to whom Jesus was
[44:34] speaking.
[44:36] You think God don't have everything in
[44:38] control? Look, he's saying that the ones
[44:40] that were standing there disputing with
[44:42] Jesus, the Pharisees, he looks at them
[44:44] and he says, "Your fathers,
[44:47] right, died in the wilderness,
[44:50] right? They they ate man and they're
[44:51] everyone dead. Your fathers." And
[44:53] brother Brandon picks up on that and he
[44:55] says that was the planning of God. It
[44:58] was actually the election of God, right?
[45:00] That they were chosen to die in the
[45:03] wilderness. They were chosen to be the
[45:06] forefathers of the Pharisees,
[45:09] right? He said they perished yet they
[45:11] were in the election of God naturally as
[45:15] Joshua and Caleb were spiritually. Oh, I
[45:18] thank God for the spiritual election
[45:21] that bypasses the natural election. And
[45:24] in your nature, you might have been born
[45:25] into a horrible situation naturally, but
[45:28] God allowed that. But in your in your
[45:30] spiritual election, you were chosen to
[45:33] be something else entirely. You were
[45:35] chosen in the mind of God. And so, no
[45:37] matter what this body is, and no matter
[45:40] what the it its predecessors were, no
[45:42] matter what damage has been done to the
[45:45] DNA or the genes or whatever else that
[45:47] there is, yet you know there's a
[45:49] spiritual election that has nothing to
[45:51] do with that. Are you with me now? But
[45:54] but even in the natural, they were
[45:56] chosen to be there.
[45:58] They had to have those parents. So,
[46:00] think about your parents and your
[46:01] grandparents and your great-grandparents
[46:04] and your great great-grandparents.
[46:06] And I know some people have problems
[46:08] with their parents and and my mother's
[46:10] here tonight. And I thank God for my
[46:12] mother, and I thank God for uh my my
[46:14] family. And yet, you know, it wasn't
[46:16] perfect. And and my dad wasn't perfect,
[46:19] and my grandfather wasn't perfect.
[46:20] either one of my grandfathers both had
[46:22] their faults and I didn't know my
[46:24] great-grandparents, but I'm sure they
[46:25] weren't perfect either. They had their
[46:28] faults and and I've at times wish that
[46:30] maybe maybe I could have been born in a
[46:32] little bit better family. Maybe one that
[46:33] that believed in life insurance, you
[46:35] know, that would be good.
[46:40] Yes. You know, because we never passed
[46:43] any wealth down from generation. I'm
[46:44] trying to change that, break that cycle.
[46:47] But but you know that that would be nice
[46:49] if you were born to parents like that.
[46:51] And yet and yet we didn't get to choose
[46:54] our parents. But God did.
[46:59] God knew I needed to be born when I was.
[47:02] You needed to be born when you was.
[47:05] Right. To parents that didn't save their
[47:06] money.
[47:09] Come on, church. Right. Like like God
[47:11] knew that I needed to make it the way
[47:13] that I did so I would be here today.
[47:16] Because if I had the money to go to law
[47:18] school and do the things I wanted to do,
[47:20] where would I be today? But God put me
[47:22] right where he wanted me to be. Oh
[47:24] church, can you see the election of God
[47:26] and the fornowledge of God? If I could
[47:28] have been what I wanted to be, I might
[47:30] have been a sinner. I might have been
[47:31] out of out of the ark of safety. I might
[47:33] have been a completely not a preacher,
[47:35] not a minister at all. But God chose my
[47:38] parents. He chose my grandparents. He
[47:41] chose and he and he orchestrated my life
[47:43] to make me what I am today. So there's
[47:46] nothing out of cater.
[47:50] Are you with me now? See, you you you
[47:53] were but born and chosen. And I'm just
[47:55] kind of uh hammering down on that
[47:56] tonight because I want us to understand
[47:58] it. In Psalm 139:14, David said, "I will
[48:01] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[48:04] wonderfully made." Marvelous are thy
[48:06] works. He's not talking about the soul.
[48:08] the the the the election of the soul.
[48:10] He's talking about the body. He said the
[48:13] you in the natural, right? He said,
[48:15] "Marvelous are their works that my soul
[48:17] knoweth right well. My substance was not
[48:19] hid from thee when I was made in secret,
[48:21] curiously rot in the lower parts of the
[48:23] earth. Thine eyes did see my substance
[48:25] yet being unperfect. In thy book all my
[48:28] members were written, which in
[48:30] continuence were fashioned, when as yet
[48:32] there was none of them." Oh, I love
[48:34] this. If he can do that in the natural,
[48:36] what can he do by your spiritual birth?
[48:38] He said, "How precious also are thy
[48:40] thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is
[48:42] the sum of them. If I should count them,
[48:44] they're more in number than the sand.
[48:46] When I awake, I am still with thee."
[48:48] Don't let nobody tell you you're
[48:50] worthless. Don't let nobody tell you
[48:52] that because God pre-planned you. If he
[48:54] pre-planned the forefathers of the
[48:56] Pharisees, what what do you think he did
[48:58] for you?
[49:00] Are you with me now?
[49:03] So if if our natural birth was
[49:05] pre-planned,
[49:07] if God brought our great
[49:10] greatgrandparents together
[49:12] so we could be here,
[49:15] then it doesn't matter. I want you to
[49:18] think about this. Whether the things or
[49:20] the genes that we inherit are good or
[49:23] bad,
[49:25] they're for our good.
[49:29] Right? You might have inherited a gene
[49:31] of some kind or DNA that caused cancer,
[49:35] but it's for your good,
[49:38] right? It's for you to overcome. You
[49:41] might have inherited a temper,
[49:44] but it was for your good. Not to excuse
[49:47] it, but to overcome it.
[49:50] Right? So when we talk about Benjamin,
[49:55] Benjamin was born at Benoni. She Rachel
[49:58] called out his name because she was born
[50:02] while he was born while she was dying.
[50:06] And and and Jacob changed his name
[50:09] because he realized that Benoni, son of
[50:12] my sorrow, that would mark his life. So
[50:14] he said, I don't want him to be known by
[50:16] sorrow. So he changes his name to
[50:19] Benjamin. Benyamin in the Hebrew is I
[50:23] know I know that because my grandpa told
[50:25] me that years ago but Benyamin in Hebrew
[50:28] is actually uh it's son of my right hand
[50:32] instead of son of sorrow. So there's a
[50:34] great change in that. So he was his
[50:37] special son because he was born remember
[50:40] while Joseph was in Egypt and he was
[50:42] Jacob's only son by Rachel or so he
[50:45] thought. He thought Joseph was dead.
[50:48] When he did come to uh Egypt, he was
[50:50] special to Joseph as well. You remember
[50:53] how he he cared for Benjamin. It was
[50:55] little Benjamin that he cried over and
[50:58] he couldn't keep himself any long.
[51:00] Couldn't keep his secret any longer. And
[51:02] he he cried out, "I I I'm your brother,
[51:05] Joseph." What was it? Brother Brandon
[51:07] said that was he was a type of the
[51:09] 144,000 Jews at the end time that that
[51:13] Christ will reveal himself to. He
[51:15] they're special to him. I believe that
[51:18] today.
[51:19] And and yet Benjamin when he was born he
[51:24] there was Jacob gave a a a prophecy over
[51:28] him in Genesis 49. And you would think
[51:30] the prophecy would be positive because
[51:32] this is his favorite. But listen to it.
[51:34] Genesis 49:27. Benjamin shall raven as a
[51:37] wolf. In the morning, he shall devour
[51:40] the prey. At night, he shall divide the
[51:43] spoil. So raven means to tear or to rip.
[51:47] A wolf doesn't just kill. He he tears
[51:51] his prey. He he does what he does with
[51:53] ferocity and zeal. He promotes himself
[51:56] to the front of the pack and he and he
[51:59] fights his way there. And so that's the
[52:01] nature of a wolf. And and yet that's not
[52:04] all the story because in Moses when he
[52:07] gave his blessing over the tribes he he
[52:10] gives a completely different type of
[52:13] blessing to Benjamin. He said of
[52:15] Benjamin he said the beloved of the Lord
[52:17] shall dwell in safety by him and the
[52:20] Lord shall cover him all the day long
[52:23] and he shall dwell between his
[52:26] shoulders. It spoke of where Benjamin
[52:28] would be in the land. And I I've been
[52:31] through some of this before. We preach a
[52:33] series on overcoming a family curse. So,
[52:35] I'm not going to belabor some of these
[52:37] points, but you can go back and listen
[52:38] to that or or just dig for yourself and
[52:41] find some of these things. But Benjamin,
[52:43] his land was in uh was where Mount
[52:46] Mariah was. In fact, Jerusalem was
[52:49] divided between Judah and Benjamin.
[52:51] Mount Zion was in Judah, but Mount
[52:53] Mariah, where the temple mount was, was
[52:55] in Benjamin. So, the Lord would actually
[52:58] dwell in safety in Benjamin. So in his
[53:01] nature there's a fierceness that can be
[53:04] used either to tear or to protect.
[53:09] Right? To to rend, to be like a wolf or
[53:12] to protect, right? And so and and this
[53:16] passes on. It's a little easier to see
[53:18] in Benjamin than even the other tribes
[53:19] that we've looked at how that it
[53:21] affected his family.
[53:24] And you know, things pass on in
[53:27] families. We know that sin does. uh we
[53:29] know uh we know it passes on to the
[53:32] third and fourth generation and and even
[53:34] maybe beyond that in some cases sin
[53:36] passes on but also righteousness passes
[53:40] on right so the things that you do just
[53:43] by just by coming to church and
[53:45] believing the word and but believing the
[53:47] message that can make a difference to
[53:48] your family if the Lord carries to your
[53:50] children to your grandchildren to your
[53:52] great grandchildren because it makes a
[53:55] difference righteousness passes on from
[53:57] generation to generation just life just
[53:59] like sin does. Right? So once the curse
[54:02] is broken and and and and and a person
[54:05] is born again, then righteousness begins
[54:08] to build up in that family and even the
[54:10] their unsaved relatives benefit from
[54:13] that. So and brother Brandham taught us
[54:16] all of that. Now brother Brandham talks
[54:18] about himself. He said my mother as you
[54:20] know was a half Indian. He said my
[54:22] father was an Irishman, a Kentucky Irish
[54:25] at that. I guess that had significance.
[54:27] is a Kentucky Irish was had more of a
[54:30] temper than a regular Irishman. He said
[54:32] both of them had enough temper to fight
[54:33] a buzzsaw.
[54:36] He said all the time my mouth was
[54:38] mashed.
[54:40] He said I was little to begin with. You
[54:43] know that's a little man syndrome.
[54:44] Brother Brandham said Zakius had an
[54:46] inferiority complex.
[54:48] Not these brothers don't. I know. But
[54:52] but but Zakius did, you know. He he was
[54:54] just little. And and brother Brandon
[54:56] said that's why he was comp in
[54:57] competition with his with his friend,
[55:00] you know, that was going to take Jesus
[55:02] to dinner. And so brother Brandon said
[55:04] he was in competition. I think he called
[55:05] him Leavinsky. He's in competition with
[55:07] you remember the story, drag the trash
[55:09] can up and climbs up the tree, right?
[55:12] And so uh so it was uh he he it was
[55:16] something that uh it was something that
[55:18] ran in the family. Now he said both of
[55:20] them had an attemper to fight a buzzaw.
[55:22] They had this, he said he had this
[55:24] little man complex and he said they just
[55:26] picked me up and knocked me down. I'd
[55:27] get up again, they knock me down again
[55:29] till I just got unable to get up
[55:30] anymore. He said that's always, he said,
[55:32] then when I I was got able to get up, I
[55:34] got up again, they knocked me down
[55:35] again. So that's just the way I had it.
[55:38] And I thought I can never be a
[55:41] Christian.
[55:42] I wonder if we could really be honest
[55:44] with ourselves tonight. How many of us
[55:47] at some point in our lives might help
[55:49] our young people if we're more honest
[55:51] about it? At some point in our lives, we
[55:54] thought, "I can never be a Christian."
[55:58] Cuz I got problems in my life. I got
[56:01] things that I can't I I just can't seem
[56:03] to overcome.
[56:05] He said, "I thought I can never be a
[56:07] Christian, but when the Holy Spirit came
[56:09] into my life, that done it." Amen. Oh,
[56:13] that's what we want. We want the Holy
[56:14] Spirit to come in and take over our
[56:16] lives.
[56:20] The worst example of Benjamin, the tribe
[56:22] of Benjamin, as a ravening wolf, was in
[56:26] the incident of the Levite in Judges
[56:28] chapter 19. In fact, it's one of the
[56:30] darkest moments in scripture, one of the
[56:32] darkest chapters of scripture. And and
[56:35] you can go and read it. I don't have
[56:37] time tonight to read all of it, but it's
[56:39] it's remarkable in its in its depravity
[56:42] and and how far that the Benjamites had
[56:45] gone. They were a very warlike tribe, a
[56:48] very great tribe, but they they actually
[56:52] there was a great sin that was committed
[56:54] against the Levite who was sjouring in
[56:55] the land and his concubine was actually
[56:58] killed.
[57:00] And it's a brutal story. And instead of
[57:04] punishing the men who did wrong, they
[57:07] the the Israelites they sent the other
[57:09] tribes sent out and they said, "We want
[57:10] these men to be punished." And and
[57:14] instead of punishing them, the
[57:15] Benjamites banded together and started a
[57:17] civil war.
[57:19] And they were almost completely
[57:22] destroyed.
[57:25] In fact, the the few men that were left
[57:27] were the Bible says they were actually
[57:29] reduced to kidnapping their wives.
[57:32] because no one would let them marry in
[57:34] Israel. They'd made a packact. They
[57:36] wouldn't let them marry. So, they had to
[57:38] wait. You know, it's an awful story and
[57:41] and and almost humorous, too, because of
[57:43] that. But it was terrible. They almost
[57:46] there was almost completely wiped out.
[57:49] And the Bible sums it up in Judges
[57:51] 21:25. It says, "In those days, there
[57:52] was no king in Israel. Every man did
[57:55] that which was right in his own eyes."
[57:57] That's the way it is when there's no
[57:58] king, when there's no ruler. Yeah. And
[58:02] And so you you fast forward a few years
[58:05] from then and there was a young man
[58:07] named Saul, a Benjamite who was chosen
[58:10] to be the first king of Israel. And his
[58:14] family has overcome that that those
[58:16] those problems in the tribe to become
[58:18] prosperous and well respected. But he
[58:20] had an inferiority complex. He he he he
[58:24] don't Saul doesn't uh he he he can't
[58:27] really comprehend uh he he can't really
[58:30] deal with the fact that he's been made
[58:32] king. Remember he was a man-made king.
[58:34] Brother Random deals with that. The
[58:36] people wanted him and God wanted David
[58:39] but the people wanted Saul. So God
[58:41] allowed it and even anointed Samuel even
[58:43] anointed him for that purpose. But he
[58:46] never really was comfortable in the job
[58:48] because he he was inferior in his
[58:51] mindset. And in 1st Samuel 9:21, Saul
[58:54] answered and said, this is when Samuel
[58:56] tells him, "You're going to be the
[58:57] king." And Saul answered and said, "Am
[58:59] not am not I a Benjamite." Now, keep in
[59:02] mind what had just happened a few couple
[59:04] decades before that there had been this
[59:06] extermination nearly of the tribe. And
[59:09] and Saul's been brought up with the
[59:11] Benjamites being the least and the and
[59:13] the most maligned of all the tribes of
[59:15] Israel. He said, "Of the smallest of the
[59:17] tribes of Israel, my family, the least
[59:19] of all the families of the tribe of
[59:21] Benjamin. Wherefore then speakest thou
[59:22] so to me? And so it was something about
[59:27] Saul's nature that made him extremely
[59:30] paranoid because of what he'd been
[59:31] through. And remember what what you
[59:33] become in life is is the genes that are
[59:36] passed on, the way God allows you to be
[59:38] born and the place he allows you to be
[59:40] born, the sign you're born under, that's
[59:42] part of who you are. Uh the place where
[59:44] you're born is part of who you are. And
[59:46] then the nurture, the way you're brought
[59:47] up, the way the the experience that you
[59:50] have in life. And and so Saul would have
[59:52] been exposed to this story and he would
[59:55] have known what had happened. And so you
[59:58] find he's extremely paranoid. He
[1:00:00] believes he's not worthy to be king. And
[1:00:02] so he kind of props himself up and he
[1:00:05] watches for threats to his kingship.
[1:00:09] So when David comes along, Saul doesn't
[1:00:12] see him as the anointed of the Lord. He
[1:00:14] sees him as a threat.
[1:00:17] And I'm kind of moving fast through this
[1:00:20] tonight, but you know, this is why some
[1:00:21] people can never have a good friend
[1:00:24] because every time they get a good
[1:00:25] friendship, they start looking for that
[1:00:27] person to undermine them. And if and if
[1:00:30] they don't, they'll invent it. They'll
[1:00:33] make it up because they can never really
[1:00:36] trust anybody
[1:00:38] because they've got this complex. But
[1:00:40] the Bible tells us to cast down our
[1:00:43] complexes,
[1:00:45] right? every thought that exalts itself
[1:00:46] against the knowledge of Christ. But but
[1:00:49] they, you know, it's hard for some
[1:00:51] people to believe that people's motives
[1:00:53] are good, right? And so they're always
[1:00:55] looking for a a sinister plot, right? Or
[1:01:00] some type of conspiracy behind someone.
[1:01:03] If that person wants to be my friend,
[1:01:04] then, you know, I'm not a very good
[1:01:06] person. So if they want to be my friend,
[1:01:08] there must be some reason behind it. And
[1:01:10] so some people can't receive love
[1:01:12] because they think there's got to be
[1:01:14] some reason for it. And you'll find them
[1:01:16] actually uh getting divorces and
[1:01:18] rejecting love from from a wife or a
[1:01:21] husband, rejecting love from a family or
[1:01:23] even from a church because they they're
[1:01:25] reading motives into it. And all you
[1:01:27] want to do is help the person, but they
[1:01:29] reading all these motives into what
[1:01:31] you're doing. Right. Right. And in that
[1:01:34] situation, you you can't do help them
[1:01:36] because because they're just that's just
[1:01:38] the way that they are. They're
[1:01:40] suspicious. That's something that we
[1:01:41] have to overcome. But we we need to
[1:01:44] realize that God does have some good
[1:01:46] things for us. And yeah, we don't
[1:01:48] deserve mercy. We we're we're pretty bad
[1:01:51] people if you just looked at the flesh.
[1:01:53] And none of us deserve to be Christians.
[1:01:55] None of us deserve to be have any good
[1:01:57] gifts at all. None of us deserve to
[1:01:59] worship in church. None of us deserve to
[1:02:02] lift our hands. Nobody deserves to
[1:02:04] worship a holy God. But yet at the same
[1:02:07] time, we've been washed by the blood of
[1:02:08] the lamb. We've been cleansed from our
[1:02:10] sins. That our sin was dropped into that
[1:02:13] tub of bleach and it went back on him.
[1:02:15] And so we can worship God with all of
[1:02:17] our hearts.
[1:02:19] And so we should be able to receive the
[1:02:21] love of God without questioning it. Yes.
[1:02:25] Why is this person extending mercy to
[1:02:27] me? Why is this person loving me? Well,
[1:02:30] maybe because they just have love in
[1:02:32] their heart for you.
[1:02:35] But Saul couldn't see that David was was
[1:02:38] on his side. David would have never
[1:02:40] taken the kingdom from him. He would
[1:02:42] have waited until his time. Saul
[1:02:44] couldn't see that.
[1:02:46] So, you know, our makeup
[1:02:50] and what we are taking a little more
[1:02:52] time on this than I anticipated, but I
[1:02:54] hope it it it'll help us tonight. our
[1:02:56] makeup, our our nature, our nurture, the
[1:02:58] DNA, what we're made out of, it can be
[1:03:01] anointed
[1:03:02] by God,
[1:03:05] right? Or by the devil.
[1:03:07] So Saul could have been a defender, and
[1:03:10] he was at times a defender of God's
[1:03:13] people. He has this nature. He's a
[1:03:16] warrior,
[1:03:17] right? He's a fighter.
[1:03:20] But he actually became a ravening wolf
[1:03:24] because he was anointed. That makeup was
[1:03:26] anointed. You see the two prophecies
[1:03:28] over Benjamin. You can see both of them
[1:03:30] in Saul. He become a ravening wolf
[1:03:32] because he was anointed by the devil to
[1:03:34] do that. An evil spirit from the Lord.
[1:03:36] The Bible says overcame him. His son
[1:03:38] Jonathan was different.
[1:03:41] Glad there's some Jonathans in the
[1:03:42] world.
[1:03:43] In 1st Samuel 18:1, it says, "It come to
[1:03:46] pass when he made an end of speaking
[1:03:47] unto Saul that the soul of Jonathan was
[1:03:50] knit with the soul of David." Jonathan,
[1:03:53] there was something about David that
[1:03:54] Jonathan loved. And Jonathan loved him
[1:03:57] as his own soul. Listen, David was as
[1:04:00] much or more of a threat to Jonathan as
[1:04:02] he was to Saul.
[1:04:05] But Jonathan didn't take him as a
[1:04:06] threat.
[1:04:08] Look at this remarkable conversation in
[1:04:10] 1st Samuel chapter 20 and verse 31. In
[1:04:13] 1st Samuel 20:31
[1:04:16] and and this is important because
[1:04:18] sometimes people feel threatened. You
[1:04:20] know, sometimes older officers of the
[1:04:22] church feel threatened by younger men as
[1:04:24] they come along. But that shouldn't be a
[1:04:26] threat. It should be an opportunity to
[1:04:27] help somebody because you want somebody
[1:04:29] to replace you. Like that's the whole
[1:04:32] goal of what we're doing. You know, I
[1:04:34] want my kids to be better off than I am.
[1:04:36] I I want the church to be more stable
[1:04:38] than when I came here. I want it to be
[1:04:40] more stable when I leave. Right? If the
[1:04:42] Lord carries at some point, I'm going to
[1:04:44] leave because I I won't live forever.
[1:04:46] Right? So, so you realize that you want
[1:04:49] to empower other people. And to do that,
[1:04:52] you've got to be like Jonathan. You got
[1:04:53] to recognize this God's anointing this
[1:04:56] person and and how can I help them? How
[1:04:58] can I help them make it to to their
[1:05:01] place and their calling? Look, look at
[1:05:03] this conversation. Saul's telling
[1:05:05] Jonathan, he said, "For as long as the
[1:05:07] son of Jesse liveth upon the ground,
[1:05:09] thou shalt not be established." So, he's
[1:05:12] telling him, he's saying, he says,
[1:05:13] "Jonathan, your your throne won't be
[1:05:15] secure. I'm trying to help you, my son,
[1:05:18] become the king." He said, "You won't be
[1:05:20] secure as long as David's alive." He
[1:05:22] said, "Nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now
[1:05:24] send fetch him unto me, for he shall
[1:05:26] surely die." But look at Jonathan.
[1:05:28] Jonathan answered Saul his father and
[1:05:30] said unto him, "Wherefore shall he be
[1:05:31] slain? What hath he done? Look at the
[1:05:34] two sides of Benjamin you see in this
[1:05:36] one family,
[1:05:38] right? Jonathan here, he's protecting
[1:05:41] David
[1:05:42] and Saul is ripping and tearing like a
[1:05:44] wolf,
[1:05:47] right? And a lot of times we want to
[1:05:48] blame our family,
[1:05:52] but the things the way God allowed us to
[1:05:54] be could be good if it was anointed by
[1:05:57] God or it could be bad if it was
[1:06:00] anointed by the devil.
[1:06:03] Are you with me? Does it make sense to
[1:06:05] you?
[1:06:08] I I coughed in my mic. I turned my ear
[1:06:11] monitor down.
[1:06:15] Joel knows what I'm talking about there.
[1:06:17] Didn't help y'all any.
[1:06:20] Saul is ripping and tearing, forcing his
[1:06:23] way to the head of the pack, but
[1:06:25] Jonathan's being a protector. Listen.
[1:06:27] Same family,
[1:06:29] same genes, same experiences, different
[1:06:32] men.
[1:06:35] That's freeing right there. If you'll
[1:06:37] recognize it, because you realize I'm
[1:06:38] not what I'm I don't have to make all
[1:06:40] the mistakes my father made. I don't
[1:06:42] have to make all the mistakes my
[1:06:43] grandfather made. Right? My children
[1:06:45] won't have to make all the mistakes that
[1:06:47] I've made. Are you with me now? There's
[1:06:50] something freeing about that. See,
[1:06:52] because we can choose in in in our free
[1:06:55] moral agency. We can choose to to love
[1:06:57] God and love his people and and be the
[1:07:00] protector, not the destroyer. Yeah. I I
[1:07:04] read a story here recently and then I
[1:07:06] went and watched a documentary about it.
[1:07:09] The the common of Awitz, I think his
[1:07:12] name was Hess, he's considered the worst
[1:07:16] the worst mass murderer in history. The
[1:07:19] man who single-handedly killed more
[1:07:21] people than anybody else. And he killed
[1:07:26] Hundreds of thousands of Jews. In fact,
[1:07:28] I think around two million while he was
[1:07:30] there of the six million Jews that died
[1:07:32] were killed by the common of ash Awitz.
[1:07:36] His grandson
[1:07:39] is an evangelical preacher,
[1:07:42] pastors a church in Germany.
[1:07:46] That was remarkable to me.
[1:07:49] I went and looked him up and he actually
[1:07:51] did a documentary where he took his
[1:07:52] father who grew up at Awitz. You think
[1:07:56] about that, the atrocities, things that
[1:07:58] were going on and they had a home there
[1:08:00] right there. While the crematories were
[1:08:02] burning, they were playing in the ark.
[1:08:06] And and so he took his father back and
[1:08:09] showed him all these things. They got
[1:08:10] together with a a Holocaust survivor and
[1:08:13] talked to her about it. And it was it
[1:08:14] was remarkable the healing and things
[1:08:17] that had taken place. But he has devoted
[1:08:20] his life to speaking out on these things
[1:08:24] and talking about how the Jews are God's
[1:08:25] chosen people and and how that in the
[1:08:28] Bible because we're Christians, we have
[1:08:30] a responsibility to honor the Jews. And
[1:08:33] he's a preacher. And I got to looking at
[1:08:35] him and listening to some of what he had
[1:08:37] to say. And I thought, my goodness,
[1:08:38] they're from the same family. They got
[1:08:40] the same genes. He was brought up in his
[1:08:43] own home by his dad who had believed his
[1:08:46] father's lie that it was all just a a
[1:08:48] fake that the Holy Ghost was faked. And
[1:08:51] so his father taught him that. But
[1:08:54] somehow he got a hold of the truth and
[1:08:56] and and it changed him. Listen church,
[1:08:58] we are not bound to be what what what
[1:09:00] our genes say that we are. But we are we
[1:09:04] can be called out of that to a higher
[1:09:05] place until we're actually become a
[1:09:07] protector instead of a destroyer.
[1:09:12] For the grandson is a spokesman, a
[1:09:15] protector for the Jews.
[1:09:17] The grandfather
[1:09:19] was the greatest murderer of Jews that
[1:09:21] ever was.
[1:09:23] Don't let your family trauma
[1:09:25] your future. You get to choose.
[1:09:30] Somehow,
[1:09:34] this is important tonight. Somehow this
[1:09:36] is all for our good.
[1:09:41] A thousand years after King Saul, I got
[1:09:44] 15 minutes and I don't know if we'll
[1:09:46] make it tonight, but we'll stop when
[1:09:48] it's time to stop. But a thousand years
[1:09:51] after King Saul died, a son is born to a
[1:09:53] Benjamite family of tent makers in
[1:09:58] Tarsus.
[1:10:00] They name him after the ancient king.
[1:10:04] His family had high hopes for him. They
[1:10:06] were Pharisees. So he he was sent to
[1:10:08] Jerusalem and given the best education a
[1:10:11] Pharisee could dream of.
[1:10:13] His name was Saul. We know him as Paul
[1:10:17] the Apostle. In Acts 22:3 he said, "I'm
[1:10:20] verily a man which I'm a Jew, born in
[1:10:23] Tarsus, a city in Cissia, yet brought up
[1:10:25] in this city at the feet of Galo, taught
[1:10:27] according to the perfect manner of the
[1:10:29] law of the fathers, was zealous toward
[1:10:31] God as you all are this day." When a man
[1:10:34] named Stephen came preaching Christ, he
[1:10:38] held the coats of the men who stoned
[1:10:40] him.
[1:10:42] In Acts chapter 22 and verse 20, he
[1:10:44] tells about it. He said, "When the blood
[1:10:46] of thy martyr Steven was shed, I also
[1:10:48] was standing by and consenting unto his
[1:10:50] death, kept the raignment of them that
[1:10:52] slew him." Something about that exposure
[1:10:54] to the gospel, brother Brandham said,
[1:10:55] and he never got away from it, but in
[1:10:57] the meantime, it made him worse,
[1:11:02] right? And so don't give up hope on your
[1:11:03] loved ones because they seem to they
[1:11:06] come to church and they get worse,
[1:11:09] right? Because that's what Saul did, he
[1:11:12] saw Stephen and he saw him standing
[1:11:13] there and he never got away from that.
[1:11:15] Brother Brandon said that was God's
[1:11:16] billboard. Steven was there as God's
[1:11:19] billboard and and eventually it got a
[1:11:22] hold of of Saul. But Saul in the
[1:11:25] meantime in Acts chapter 9 verse one it
[1:11:27] says Saul yet breathing out threatenings
[1:11:29] and slaughter. Can you see the spirit of
[1:11:32] the wolf
[1:11:34] in the Benjamite?
[1:11:36] A thousand years
[1:11:39] after Saul,
[1:11:43] all these hundreds of of years after
[1:11:46] Benjamin was born and after Saul was
[1:11:49] born. And yet here still that trait is
[1:11:52] still going through the family. And and
[1:11:55] it said he went to the high priest's
[1:11:56] desired letters that if he found any of
[1:11:58] this way, whether they were men or
[1:11:59] women, he might bring them bound to
[1:12:01] Jerusalem. He was a ravening wolf.
[1:12:05] And in Galatians 1:13, he tells about if
[1:12:07] you've heard of my conversation in time
[1:12:10] past in the Jewish religion, he said,
[1:12:12] "You you know how I was, how that beyond
[1:12:14] measure I persecuted the church of God
[1:12:16] and wasted it." See, he didn't just
[1:12:19] persecute them. He he relished it. He
[1:12:23] enjoyed it.
[1:12:26] He He wasn't just somebody who who who
[1:12:28] would persecute a Christian if he found
[1:12:30] one. He went and hunted them down. Went
[1:12:33] out of his way to throw them in prison.
[1:12:37] Sought permission to go and find more of
[1:12:40] them, men and women, boys and girls, and
[1:12:42] throw them in prison and kill them. He
[1:12:45] said, "I wasted it. Profited in the Jews
[1:12:48] religion above many. my equals and my
[1:12:50] own nation being more exceedingly
[1:12:52] zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
[1:12:53] He had that nature of a wolf. He was he
[1:12:56] would rend and he would tear like a wolf
[1:12:58] would sometimes kill just for the
[1:13:00] enjoyment of it when they don't even
[1:13:03] need it. They'll kill a whole herd if
[1:13:04] they can do it when they don't even need
[1:13:06] it because they enjoy that so much.
[1:13:11] It took divine intervention.
[1:13:16] You You weren't going to talk Saul out
[1:13:19] of it. Saul of Tarsus, you weren't going
[1:13:21] to talk him out of of persecuting the
[1:13:24] church.
[1:13:26] You You weren't No amount of of reason
[1:13:28] was going to was going to make Saul
[1:13:30] change his mind. You could have taught
[1:13:33] him and taught him and taught him and
[1:13:34] everything else and and told him and
[1:13:36] said, "Son, you be a good boy and don't
[1:13:38] do that." But he had it in his heart.
[1:13:42] But one day on the road to Damascus to
[1:13:45] do more harm to the church just woof
[1:13:50] God got a hold of him. And what did he
[1:13:53] do? He, you know, God had again God
[1:13:56] allowed him to be the way that he was
[1:13:58] because there was elements of that God
[1:14:00] was going to use him. He was going to
[1:14:02] use that zeal. He was going to use that
[1:14:05] that that driven nature.
[1:14:10] But it took divine intervention to break
[1:14:12] that family curse.
[1:14:14] But I want you to think about this. We
[1:14:16] know how he was born again. He saw the
[1:14:18] pillar of fire. He said, "Lord, Lord,
[1:14:20] Lord, who are you?" And he he said, "I
[1:14:22] am Jesus. Whom thou persecutest?" And he
[1:14:24] goes, he he's blinded. He receives the
[1:14:27] Holy Ghost. He he's baptized.
[1:14:30] But think of the complexes he could have
[1:14:32] had.
[1:14:36] When Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:3
[1:14:39] through5 talks to us about walking in
[1:14:42] not w walking in the flesh but not
[1:14:43] waring after the flesh. He knows what
[1:14:45] he's talking about.
[1:14:47] Because Paul can't overthink himself in
[1:14:50] his own story or he gets in trouble.
[1:14:54] He said, "Though we walk in the flesh,
[1:14:55] we do not war after the flesh. For the
[1:14:56] weapons of our warfare, not carnal, but
[1:14:58] mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:15:00] of strongholds. Casting down
[1:15:03] imaginations.
[1:15:06] Whose imagination is Paul casting? His
[1:15:09] own,
[1:15:10] right? He's got to deal with what he's
[1:15:12] done. He's got to deal with his past.
[1:15:14] He's got to deal with the Oh, church.
[1:15:17] Got to deal with all the families he's
[1:15:19] tore apart and all the nonsense that
[1:15:21] he's done. And yet recognizing that God
[1:15:24] saved him from that. Yes, I think every
[1:15:26] one of us can identify a little bit with
[1:15:28] that. You got to deal in your mind with
[1:15:30] what's happened and yet you know God
[1:15:32] saved you brought you away from that.
[1:15:38] He said, "So I bring into captivity
[1:15:40] every thought
[1:15:43] that exalts itself against the the
[1:15:45] knowledge of God. Bring into captivity
[1:15:47] every thought to the obedience of
[1:15:49] Christ." Good. Yes.
[1:15:52] Brother Brandham said he even went back
[1:15:54] to his own brethren.
[1:15:56] He said he had to he had to give all
[1:15:58] that up. He said Paul said, "I had to
[1:16:01] count it as dung. All the learning, all
[1:16:03] the things,
[1:16:04] but he said he had his church, his
[1:16:06] brethren. He was a fugitive from the
[1:16:07] church after that, the Jewish church. He
[1:16:10] had to run. Finally, his own church took
[1:16:12] his life. They killed him. And we find
[1:16:14] out persecuted from city to city, was
[1:16:16] stoned, almost dead once and so forth.
[1:16:18] his own brethren and he said I would
[1:16:21] become a curse for them. He didn't
[1:16:23] despise them. Oh, come on church. He He
[1:16:27] was a raving wolf.
[1:16:29] But when his nature got changed, I think
[1:16:32] we need more people with the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:34] That's what we need. We need the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost to come to I think many of us need
[1:16:37] a refilling of the Holy Ghost because
[1:16:39] that old wolf nature showing back up and
[1:16:41] this old wolf nature was there. But once
[1:16:43] that wolf nature was changed, he said,
[1:16:45] "I would become a curse for the ones
[1:16:47] Yes. That that persecute me. Yes. He
[1:16:51] didn't despise them. He said when he
[1:16:53] received the Holy Spirit, he loves them.
[1:16:55] He wanted to save them. This is a
[1:16:56] remarkable statement. But the Brandon
[1:16:58] said, "Don't isolate yourself.
[1:17:01] Go to them kind,
[1:17:05] right? The ones you say, well, well,
[1:17:07] they they were wrong and and they
[1:17:09] they've treated me wrong." He said,
[1:17:10] "Don't isolate yourself. Go to them
[1:17:12] kind."
[1:17:14] Paul would be made a curse himself
[1:17:15] because it was the spirit of Christ that
[1:17:17] was in him that was cursed and hung on a
[1:17:19] tree for his own. He had the genes of a
[1:17:22] Benjamite. He had the upbringing of a
[1:17:24] Pharisee. His fathers died in the
[1:17:26] wilderness like the others. But he had
[1:17:29] been chosen by God from the beginning.
[1:17:31] How many are glad for the election of
[1:17:33] God? How many glad for spiritual
[1:17:35] election that that overcome our natural
[1:17:37] birth?
[1:17:39] We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity.
[1:17:41] Yet God had his hand on it. He had his
[1:17:44] hand on us. He chose us to be born the
[1:17:46] way we were and brought up the way we
[1:17:48] were. And yet and yet we were lost
[1:17:50] without hope. And God come down one day
[1:17:53] on our way to Damascus. He come down and
[1:17:55] woke us up and brought us the message of
[1:17:58] the hour. That ought to be something we
[1:17:59] could thank God for tonight on a
[1:18:02] Wednesday night.
[1:18:04] Hallelujah.
[1:18:06] He He had been chosen by God from the
[1:18:08] beginning. He said, "When it pleased
[1:18:10] God, who separated me from my mother's
[1:18:12] womb and called me by his grace to
[1:18:15] reveal his son in me," he said, "I that
[1:18:16] I might preach him among the heathen,
[1:18:18] and immediately I conferred not with
[1:18:19] flesh and blood." Listen, his ministry
[1:18:21] wasn't made by the council of Jerusalem.
[1:18:23] Yeah, he didn't separate from them. He
[1:18:25] he went to them, but they that's not who
[1:18:27] made him. That's not who gave him the
[1:18:29] revelation. It come from God. He Now
[1:18:32] listen, 1 Corinthians 15:9, he said,
[1:18:34] "For I am the least of the apostles.
[1:18:37] am not meat to be called an apostle
[1:18:39] because I persecuted the church of God.
[1:18:42] But by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[1:18:45] How many could could raise your hand and
[1:18:47] say, "That's me tonight. By the grace of
[1:18:49] God, I am what I am." It's only grace
[1:18:52] that brought me safe this far. It's only
[1:18:54] grace that'll lead me on. By the grace
[1:18:57] of God, I am what I am. And his grace
[1:19:01] which was bestowed upon me was not in
[1:19:03] vain. But I labored more abundantly than
[1:19:05] they all.
[1:19:07] Paul, he wouldn't even take money for
[1:19:10] preaching the gospel. He made tents. He
[1:19:12] traveled all over the world, gave his
[1:19:14] life and had a zeal in his heart even to
[1:19:16] be a martyr and go to Rome, preach the
[1:19:18] gospel. What did that? He knew what he
[1:19:20] was. And God took that same that nature
[1:19:24] that he had. He didn't take it away from
[1:19:25] him. But what did he do? He anointed it
[1:19:28] by the Holy Ghost. And he be he be to he
[1:19:33] be to be a protector
[1:19:36] instead of a destroyer.
[1:19:42] He said, "I labored more abundantly than
[1:19:43] they all. Yet not I, but the grace of
[1:19:45] God which was with me. Therefore,
[1:19:46] whether it were I or they, so we
[1:19:48] preached and so you believed." He
[1:19:51] consented to Stephven's death, but he
[1:19:53] did not let that condemnation
[1:19:55] destroy his effectiveness.
[1:19:59] Condemnation will destroy you as a
[1:20:01] parent, as a grandparent,
[1:20:04] as a as a church member. If you just let
[1:20:07] it sit on you, at some point, you got to
[1:20:09] get a revelation. There is therefore now
[1:20:11] no condemnation of them which are in
[1:20:13] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:20:15] flesh, but after the spirit. At some
[1:20:16] point, we got to start walking in the
[1:20:18] spirit. Say, I'm going to cast down
[1:20:19] every thought, every condemning thought.
[1:20:21] I know I've been redeemed. I know I'm
[1:20:23] free. I know I'm Listen, con all
[1:20:26] condemnation does is tie you to your
[1:20:29] past. We know the past was wrong. Let's
[1:20:31] go on into the future
[1:20:34] where all things are made right.
[1:20:39] He didn't let that condemnation destroy
[1:20:41] his effectiveness. He said, "For I am
[1:20:43] now ready to be offered. The timing of
[1:20:45] my departure is at hand." He said, "I
[1:20:47] have fought a good fight."
[1:20:51] He didn't say, "I fought a good fight
[1:20:52] except for that time." You know, but you
[1:20:54] know what he said? He said, "I did that
[1:20:56] in ignorance."
[1:20:58] Wasn't an ignorance of head knowledge.
[1:20:59] Because he knew who Jesus was.
[1:21:02] It was an ignorance. He had never met
[1:21:04] the Holy Ghost yet. Never met Christ
[1:21:07] yet. He said, "I have fought a good
[1:21:10] fight. I have finished my course. I have
[1:21:11] kept the faith. His fourth laid up for
[1:21:14] me a crown of righteousness." That word
[1:21:17] as we've preached many times that's a
[1:21:19] stfanos. I'm sure he thought of Stephen
[1:21:21] when he said it when he wrote it. A
[1:21:24] crown. Steven means crown. A crown of
[1:21:26] righteous which the Lord the righteous
[1:21:28] judge shall give me at that day. Unto me
[1:21:30] only but unto all them also that love
[1:21:33] his appearing. How could he be so sure?
[1:21:35] How could he be so sure that he was he
[1:21:37] had fought a good fight? He knew the
[1:21:39] same power that changed him from what he
[1:21:41] was would keep him in the hour of
[1:21:43] judgment. In the hour when the crowns
[1:21:46] were handed out, he said, "I fought a
[1:21:48] good fight." Listen. He said, "For the
[1:21:50] which cause also I suffer these things.
[1:21:53] Nevertheless, I'm not ashamed." He said,
[1:21:55] "For I know whom I have believed."
[1:21:58] I know. How many can say I know tonight
[1:22:00] as we're closing in just a moment. I
[1:22:02] know whom I have believed and am
[1:22:04] persuaded that he's able to keep what
[1:22:06] I've committed unto him against that
[1:22:08] day. I gave it to him. I couldn't keep
[1:22:11] myself. I couldn't make myself a
[1:22:13] nurturer, a protector, and not a
[1:22:15] destroyer. But he made me what I am. By
[1:22:18] the grace of God, I am what I am. And
[1:22:20] I'm persuaded that what I committed to
[1:22:22] him, he's able to keep. I committed my
[1:22:24] soul to him, he's able to keep my soul.
[1:22:28] Know he changed me. And I know I will be
[1:22:30] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[1:22:33] an eye.
[1:22:35] I want to ask you tonight if God could
[1:22:36] take a Benjamite named Saul,
[1:22:39] break the family curse, give him a new
[1:22:41] name, place him as the apostle to the
[1:22:44] Gentiles, what could he do in your life?
[1:22:47] What could he do in mine?
[1:22:51] See, God wants to use us. Did you know
[1:22:52] that, young man? He wants to use us.
[1:22:55] Even Puitz, he wants to use Puits
[1:22:59] and Vas.
[1:23:06] Some of them sitting there saying,
[1:23:07] "Don't call my name."
[1:23:11] God wants to use you young ladies. He
[1:23:13] wants to use you young men, but you got
[1:23:15] to get you out of the way. Come on.
[1:23:19] Right. Otherwise, you'll just be a
[1:23:21] destroyer.
[1:23:24] You may be talented, but you'll be a
[1:23:25] destroyer.
[1:23:27] You may be gifted, but you'll be a
[1:23:28] destroyer. But if you'll if you'll
[1:23:31] surrender to him,
[1:23:34] See, he wants to use you, but he wants
[1:23:36] to use you to to nurture and to protect,
[1:23:40] not to destroy. The new birth didn't do
[1:23:42] away with Paul's nature. It just gave
[1:23:45] him power over it. How do we know that?
[1:23:48] Because Paul says, "I protest by your
[1:23:50] rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus
[1:23:52] our Lord. I die daily." He wasn't
[1:23:55] talking about his hair.
[1:24:02] He said, "I die daily."
[1:24:05] Daily.
[1:24:07] Every day. He had to wake up and prove
[1:24:09] the devil wrong.
[1:24:11] I am not a ravening wolf.
[1:24:15] Come on, church. We think we Well, I got
[1:24:17] saved. I come to the altar and now why
[1:24:20] is the devil fighting me? He's going to
[1:24:22] fight you every day. He's going to make
[1:24:24] you prove you're a Christian. Gonna make
[1:24:26] you prove what you say. He's going to
[1:24:29] make you back up your testimony, but you
[1:24:31] can do it by the grace of God, sir.
[1:24:34] Every day he had to prove the devil
[1:24:35] wrong. Romans 12:1, I beseech you
[1:24:37] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[1:24:39] God, you present your bodies a living
[1:24:41] sacrifice, not just your say, well, my
[1:24:43] souls going to God, but present your
[1:24:45] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[1:24:47] acceptable unto God, which is your
[1:24:49] reasonable service. Be not conformed to
[1:24:51] this world. Don't be conformed to the
[1:24:54] nature that you are just automatically,
[1:24:56] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:24:58] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:25:00] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:25:02] will of God. The devil will make you
[1:25:04] prove it, but you can do it by the
[1:25:07] renewing of your mind. Every day Paul
[1:25:09] lived, he nailed his flesh to the cross
[1:25:11] and he said, "I'm not the sum of my
[1:25:13] mistakes. I'm a son of God. I'm a son of
[1:25:16] God. I belong to God." He said, "I am
[1:25:19] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:25:21] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:25:23] and the life which I now live in the
[1:25:25] flesh. I live by the faith of the son of
[1:25:26] God who loved me and gave himself for
[1:25:28] me. He said, "Well, what if I make a
[1:25:30] mistake?" Brother Brandham tells us a
[1:25:32] story about the man with no eraser. He
[1:25:34] said he went to be hired by the Ballard
[1:25:35] company and and he said he he said, "Why
[1:25:39] do you not have an eraser on your pencil
[1:25:41] and the man said the job applicant?" He
[1:25:42] said he said, "Well," he said, "I never
[1:25:44] make any mistakes." He said, "Then I
[1:25:45] can't use you." He said, "Because if you
[1:25:47] never make any mistakes, you ain't doing
[1:25:50] nothing." And so, Brother Brandon picked
[1:25:52] that up. He said, "If I fall or if I
[1:25:54] fail, let me rise and try again. Forgive
[1:25:56] me, Lord, and try me one more time." He
[1:25:59] said, "I prayed that so much to God till
[1:26:01] I'm ashamed of myself almost. Let me
[1:26:03] rise and try again, constantly falling
[1:26:06] and each time why he's been merciful to
[1:26:08] help me to come back again." How many
[1:26:10] can testify to that tonight? He said,
[1:26:12] "Now, if we just look it over, listen to
[1:26:14] this. Listen to the humility of a
[1:26:16] prophet. And if we'd be honest with
[1:26:17] ourselves, we'd say the same thing. He
[1:26:19] said, "There isn't an hour through the
[1:26:21] day, sir." So when you going to pick on
[1:26:24] somebody else,
[1:26:27] which hour are you going to spend
[1:26:29] picking on somebody else?
[1:26:32] Say, "Well, they don't have any love.
[1:26:33] They don't do this, that, or the other."
[1:26:35] I fail him every hour.
[1:26:38] There is an hour through the day hardly.
[1:26:40] But what's something we do that's wrong?
[1:26:43] And now there's no little ones or big
[1:26:45] ones. They're all big ones before God.
[1:26:47] So if Apostle Paul had to die daily, how
[1:26:49] much more will we have to die daily? He
[1:26:52] said, "Then I think a person that has
[1:26:54] done something wrong and is willing to
[1:26:56] make it right." The real Christian
[1:26:58] attitude is to forgive that person.
[1:27:01] Remember, if you go back a couple weeks,
[1:27:03] I talked to you about Brother Graham
[1:27:05] Snelling. Brother Brandon was preaching
[1:27:07] this in his church and he had had a
[1:27:09] problem and he had started his own
[1:27:11] church, left the tabernacle, started his
[1:27:14] own church. Brother Brandham went
[1:27:15] dedicated it,
[1:27:17] right?
[1:27:19] And and and so brother, he's talking to
[1:27:21] brother Graham's trying to encourage
[1:27:22] him. He said, "There's where I think
[1:27:24] brother Graham the church people today
[1:27:25] miss it so much. Instead of trying to
[1:27:27] raise this person back up again just to
[1:27:29] keep shoving them farther, said see
[1:27:32] Christ when we were the lowest, he
[1:27:34] stooped down and picked us up." He said
[1:27:36] that makes it to where we ought to have
[1:27:37] that kind of a spirit too.
[1:27:42] Can I have just three or four more
[1:27:44] minutes?
[1:27:47] You remember the How many's ever read
[1:27:49] the book of Fleiman?
[1:27:52] Few of you, you can read it in five
[1:27:54] minutes.
[1:27:58] in in in the Bible there's a book called
[1:28:00] Fleiman and it's written it's a letter
[1:28:03] to Fleiman about a slave called
[1:28:07] Onissimus or Wanisimus something like
[1:28:10] that
[1:28:12] and and and Paul has an interesting
[1:28:16] relationship with this guy because this
[1:28:17] guy run away from home and his master
[1:28:20] become a Christian and Paul knew him. In
[1:28:23] fact, Paul evidently had spread the
[1:28:25] gospel there in that place. his master
[1:28:27] believed it. And so now Wanissimus is is
[1:28:31] has run away from home and he becomes a
[1:28:33] Christian.
[1:28:35] And so recognizing the under the law in
[1:28:38] that day like you know the slave would
[1:28:41] leave and they would take stuff with
[1:28:43] them and probably stole some stuff and
[1:28:45] did his master wrong. And so Paul writes
[1:28:48] a letter and sends this slave back
[1:28:51] to his master.
[1:28:54] But he sends him back in a very
[1:28:55] interesting way. If you read the book, I
[1:28:57] don't have time to read it tonight, but
[1:28:59] in verse 17, it says, "If thou count me
[1:29:01] therefore a partner, receive him as
[1:29:04] myself."
[1:29:08] I don't see a bit of the ravening wolf
[1:29:12] nature in Paul at this stage of his
[1:29:14] life.
[1:29:17] I don't I don't see even a bit of it.
[1:29:20] Thank God for the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:24] Paul says, "If this slave has wronged
[1:29:26] thee or oweth thee ought, put that on my
[1:29:30] account."
[1:29:33] So he writes back to him. He says, "I
[1:29:35] know he left you. I know he stole some
[1:29:36] stuff or, you know, broke some stuff or
[1:29:40] did something wrong." He says, "But
[1:29:42] whatever he owes you, put it on my
[1:29:44] account." Don't sound much like a
[1:29:47] Benjamite, does it? Right? Verse
[1:29:50] 2 Corinthians 5:17 tells us, he said,
[1:29:53] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:29:54] he's a new creature. Old things are
[1:29:56] passed away. All things are become new."
[1:29:59] That's what Paul was doing was
[1:30:01] exhibiting that new nature.
[1:30:03] He said, "Whatever he owes you, be
[1:30:06] reconciled to him."
[1:30:09] And he actually tells him in that in
[1:30:12] that chapter, he tells him, he says now,
[1:30:14] he said, "I want you to receive him, but
[1:30:16] not as a servant." said, "Receive him as
[1:30:19] a brother."
[1:30:22] Oh, thank the Lord. What was it? It was
[1:30:24] something in Paul that was bringing not
[1:30:26] a tearing, not a ripping apart, but a
[1:30:29] reconciliation. He said, "And if any man
[1:30:31] be in Christ, he's a new creature, and
[1:30:32] all things are become new, and all
[1:30:34] things are of God, who hath reconciled
[1:30:36] us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath
[1:30:39] given to us the ministry of
[1:30:41] reconciliation." He did not give us the
[1:30:43] ministry of ripping apart, right? but
[1:30:46] the ministry of reconciliation to with
[1:30:49] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:30:52] world unto himself not imputing their
[1:30:55] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[1:30:57] unto us the word of reconciliation. What
[1:31:01] was he why is Fiman even in the Bible
[1:31:04] it's showing us the word of
[1:31:06] reconciliation?
[1:31:08] Oh church, the genes of the Benjamite
[1:31:12] made Saul a ravening wolf ripping and
[1:31:14] tearing to get his own way. But the seed
[1:31:16] gene of God musicians go ahead and come
[1:31:18] by the new birth. Give him a ministry of
[1:31:21] reconciliation.
[1:31:24] Hallelujah.
[1:31:25] Well, that's what I want tonight. That's
[1:31:28] what I believe we have. He said he's
[1:31:30] given to us the word reconciliation.
[1:31:33] That's what this message is. It's not a
[1:31:35] word of tearing and ripping.
[1:31:37] It's a ministry of reconciliation,
[1:31:41] reconciling us
[1:31:44] back to the word.
[1:31:47] Listen to me tonight as we close. I know
[1:31:49] I've taken a little bit longer than
[1:31:50] normal, but you forgive me.
[1:31:54] If you've been placed naturally a
[1:31:56] certain way,
[1:31:59] and we've talked about all these young
[1:32:00] men and how they were placed in the
[1:32:02] land, and we just are who we are,
[1:32:04] brother Bill. We just a certain way.
[1:32:07] Right? You look at a person, you say,
[1:32:08] "Well, that's just his way. It's just
[1:32:10] their way. It's the way their family
[1:32:13] is."
[1:32:17] But the genes, you know what genes are?
[1:32:21] It's it's it's letters. It's
[1:32:23] information.
[1:32:25] It's word. Do you know that? Your body
[1:32:29] is made up of word.
[1:32:31] That's what it is. that can take the
[1:32:33] genes in your body and lay down its ABC,
[1:32:36] right?
[1:32:39] It's information. It tells you what
[1:32:41] color your eyes are, right? That come
[1:32:44] from your parents. God orchestrated
[1:32:46] that,
[1:32:48] right?
[1:32:50] So, what are the genes of God?
[1:32:53] The genes of God is the word of God.
[1:32:59] So,
[1:33:00] so you say, "Well, my family's lazy,
[1:33:03] but the word
[1:33:06] isn't that way.
[1:33:08] My family has a temper, but the word
[1:33:11] isn't that way."
[1:33:15] And when, Brother JT, we've been reimed,
[1:33:20] right? By our new birth, we've been
[1:33:22] reined. Oh, this ought to make this
[1:33:25] ought to make a Baptist shout. We've
[1:33:26] been reined. So, whatever the word says
[1:33:29] a husband can be, I can be. Not because
[1:33:32] of my father, not because of my
[1:33:33] grandfather, but because of the word
[1:33:35] gene. It was put down on the inside of
[1:33:38] my heart. And what was it? It began to
[1:33:41] express, it can only be expressed under
[1:33:43] the message of the hour. That's why the
[1:33:44] message is so important
[1:33:47] because the message come the message
[1:33:49] come to to give us the information that
[1:33:52] would change us.
[1:33:56] And the message isn't just something on
[1:33:57] the outside, but it's something within
[1:33:59] you. That's why you couldn't leave it.
[1:34:01] You couldn't give up on it. You couldn't
[1:34:03] say it's not true. Why? Because there's
[1:34:05] something inside of you that identifies
[1:34:07] with it. It's part of who you are. Yes.
[1:34:11] So, no matter what the world tells you
[1:34:13] you are, no matter what your family
[1:34:15] history tells you you are, what does the
[1:34:17] word say you can be, that's the
[1:34:19] instructions you've been given, and that
[1:34:21] word will make you into what you are
[1:34:23] just as much as your natural genes made
[1:34:25] you blondeheaded or blackheaded or
[1:34:27] whatever you are. The spiritual gene
[1:34:29] will make you a son or daughter of God
[1:34:31] if you'll let it tonight. If you'll just
[1:34:33] surrender to it. Can we just do that?
[1:34:36] Let's bow our heads together. Why can't
[1:34:38] Why don't we just put ourselves on the
[1:34:40] altar tonight?
[1:34:44] I want to be like Paul. I want to die
[1:34:45] daily.
[1:34:47] Let this be the moment today. Tomorrow
[1:34:49] I'll die again.
[1:34:51] Let me die to my natural genes
[1:34:54] so Christ may live in me. Paul said, I I
[1:34:58] keep under my body. Bring it under
[1:35:00] subjection.
[1:35:01] I don't want to be a Benjamite.
[1:35:04] I don't want to just be a raving wolf. I
[1:35:06] don't want to just be a Jew.
[1:35:09] I don't want to just be a Pharisee. I
[1:35:11] want to be a son of God. I've been given
[1:35:15] a ministry of reconciliation.
[1:35:18] But why don't we put ourselves young and
[1:35:19] old on the altar tonight?
[1:35:22] Said, "Christ, I want you to live in me.
[1:35:24] Let your word live. Let it be born in my
[1:35:27] heart." Heavenly Father, that's my
[1:35:29] desire tonight. I lay myself on the
[1:35:31] altar with these people, with this
[1:35:33] congregation, Lord.
[1:35:36] have come and listen patiently tonight.
[1:35:38] I pray God that you'd help us.
[1:35:41] We We want to be right. We don't want to
[1:35:43] ever be be Lord what we are by just by
[1:35:47] nature. Just do things because that's
[1:35:49] the way we are. We want to do everything
[1:35:51] according to the word. Change us oh God
[1:35:55] by the power of the Holy Ghost Lord that
[1:35:58] makes that DNA live. Oh God, that
[1:36:02] quickens the word to us. I pray you'd
[1:36:05] grant it, Lord. As when our natural
[1:36:06] bodies, when our spirit come into us,
[1:36:08] Lord, it made the the DNA that we were
[1:36:11] live. Oh God, may the spirit of God come
[1:36:14] in every heart tonight. Refill us, oh
[1:36:16] God. Lord, as we die here on this altar,
[1:36:20] Lord, refill us as we die to ourselves.
[1:36:23] Refill us with the genes of God, Lord.
[1:36:26] Make it active in our make the word
[1:36:27] active among us, oh God, that we can
[1:36:30] love one another. We can exhibit the
[1:36:32] fruits of the spirit. we can live like
[1:36:33] Christians ought to live. I pray you'd
[1:36:36] grant it tonight. We love you. Thank you
[1:36:37] for this service. I pray Lord somehow
[1:36:40] you'd Lord take the broken words and
[1:36:43] make it real to us. Father, I pray in
[1:36:45] Jesus name. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. You believe he wants to use
[1:36:54] you tonight. If you need prayer, the
[1:36:55] altar is open. Let's stand together.
[1:36:59] Even though
[1:37:01] it's humble,
[1:37:04] Lord, help my will to crumble.
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] Though the cost be great, I'll work for
[1:37:18] you.
