good to see you back there this morning God bless you both and all of you that are here good to have the PR's back with us today and and my bunch of folks here we've actually got quite a few gone today but um traveling we'll just have the one service so let's just let's just dig in on this service Peter I've got a little bit of feedback let's just dig in on this service and uh and just be part of it participate in it can you do that this morning just participate and this is for all of us and so let's just do that Genesis chapter 15 and verse one excuse me it says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we know that Abram had been called by election separated by Grace been called out of Babylon uh out of uh out of confusion out of of the caldes and and he'd been given an unconditional Covenant and so uh he had faith and we know that he was called out by election brother brand said notice s Abraham called by election and God giving him the Covenant of Grace unconditionally he said you know when God makes a covenant with man man breaks his Covenant you make he said if you make a promise to God nine times out of 10 you'll not do it he said when God made a covenant with man in the Garden of Eden this you do and if you do this there's an if in it there's an if in it he said man turned right back around and broke his Covenant with God as an important thing to understand about Mankind is that mankind will always do the wrong thing right and that's why we don't trust in the flesh because our flesh will always do the wrong thing and yet there's got to be something that controls and governs that flesh because we do believe in Holiness we believe that God wants us to be holy he wants us to be Godly in this world but how can we be that only by the spirit of God living within us because man always breaks his Covenant and he said God was determined to save man so instead of saying if he was no if to Abraham he said I have I have you see the Assurance you'll come to me in an old age other words he told Abraham what he would do his seed would sourn in a Strange Land and all of those things he said this is what's going to happen this is not what's going to happen if Abraham you do this and if Abraham you do that he said no I already know what Abraham will do don't you see he already knew oh my he already knew every step that Abraham would take and he overwhelmed Abraham by Grace and Faith and knowing that knowing that Abraham though in himself he he he would fail though in in his own flesh he would do the wrong thing and yet God would so overwhelm him by election and by love that he would end up in the right place anyway and I think we could say Amen to that today we've made many mistakes and yet we know that God didn't say if with us but he said you're going to be there and we got to have have that Assurance in our hearts and if we really have that Assurance it makes us love God with all of our hearts now watch he said not if you see the Assurance you'll come to me in an old age I've already settled it not if you'll do anything go read the scripture he never said If Abraham if he said I will make of you a great nation I will bless you I'll make your name a blessing listen he said he didn't say if he said no if to Abraham you see the Assurance you'll come to me at old age of already settled it not if you'll do anything I've already done it he said then it's got to be sure yeah he said not Abraham if you backslide or Abraham if you'll keep my word Abraham if you'll do this or you'll do that God said I've already done it that ought to make a Baptist shout I've already done it oh you say I'd like to be Abraham oh brother Braham if I had that Assurance then I would certainly rest perfectly quiet right you said why you've got the same assurance and the same Covenant the Covenant was not only to Abraham only but to his seed after him amen if you begin to see that he said then Divine Healing becomes easy right Divine Healing becomes easy any other promise that God has given becomes easy when you see that it's not you it's God he said God has given the promise so then you don't need to get Restless oh oh my you don't get Restless oh that's that's what I want to do I want to remain settled on the Promises of God and know it's going to happen I'm going to believe God see God was so sure of Abraham that he did not have a backup plan yeah right right there wasn't another Abraham in the wings waiting on so if Abraham don't work out I got another guy lot you can do it no there was already a purpose for lot right you know how when you do your your your your finances when you do your budget they tell you to give every dollar a purpose right and in God's economy they they say give it a purpose or it'll spend itself right you you won't know what happened to it so you give it a purpose in God's economy every bit of God's economy had a purpose lot had a purpose he already had a job he was a penny he couldn't be a quarter or silver dollar or a half dollar but Abraham was a silver dollar right and so they already were purposed out in God's mind and again that's hard for us to understand you say well what's the point of of even uh of even doing of even doing anything for God what's the point of effort well God knew who would make the effort God knew who would would do well God knew that Abraham would believe him and he called him and he actually put that faith in him to believe sir right it's all God now God was so sure of you you didn't have a backup plan do you know that right there's not some other group going to raise up and be the bride it's not going to be the message plus somebody else and that's why I don't like to hear a bunch of criticism and a bunch of a bunch of nonsense about the message people and say well the message people are so bad okay uh you know we're the ones that are going to do it that's right right we're it's got It's got to come from the message somewhere might as well be us it may not be everybody that claims to be a message believer but somebody that believes the message is going to go in a Rapture right somebody that has believes all the promises of God is going to go in a Rapture I see your sign back there somebody is going to believe God's word and stand for it in this hour oh I say let that be me you young people you ought to take that and say let it be me I'm going to be somebody who stands for God if all the other young ladies go into the world let me be one who stands if all the other young men go out in the world let me be one who stands for God who believes God somebody will do it somebody will and it won't be the one everybody thinks maybe maybe somebody out there that that's lost in sin hooked on drugs and everything else but if God calls them they'll come out of that place and come and live for God he's able to deliver he's able to save oh every one of us ought to realize that this morning I don't care what your pastors being if he's calling you listen to that call heed that call you see God didn't need to hear a voice you already knew God didn't need to be assured of Victory Abraham didn't have to go to God and say okay God you're going to be okay be calm God don't don't don't don't I'll be okay I I'll serve you God didn't fret on he wasn't worried Abraham needed to be sure right God was sure sure Abram needed to be sure God didn't need to hear a voice he didn't need to be served communion right oh my am he didn't need to make a sacrifice he didn't need a seal of circumcision right but Abraham did amen he didn't need to see the sign of the son of man but he provided those things for Abraham and he has provided those things for us right Genesis 15 verse1 after these things the word of the Lord came un Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward I am thy Shield brother B said if God is your Shield how is the devil going to hit you that's pretty good right there if God is your Shield how is the devil going to hit you that's a better Shield than a Roman Shield or a Greek Shield or an American Shield if God sir is your Shield how is the devil going to hit you I'm your shield and your exceeding great reward in other words he was saying I'm your protection and I'm your provision I'm Pro I'm providing for you and I'm going to protect you in what I've provided Genesis 15:2 Abraham said Lord God what wil thou give me now watch Abram is looking for Assurance and God gave it to him we're humans and I know many times people will ask now say why do we need to have meetings why why do we need to feel the presence of God why do I need to go to church why do I need a pastor why why do we need to hear the word preach why why if everything's already set in order why do we need these things if everything's the way it ought to be and and God's taking care of me and God's taking care of everything why do I need to feel the presence of God what's the point in shouting I heard a preacher say why would I ever Shout why would I ever do all that he said I already know the word well you might but some I'll say this we're human beings and somebody sometimes the human part of us needs to feel and know that God is there the soul is convinced but it's the spirit and the body that need to know God's still real we still need to see people healed we still need to PE see people saved we still need to feel the power of God in the church we still need God to move Among Us why is that human part that needs Assurance God you're still there oh don't you feel like that sometimes you get to where you yes you're relying on the word you know the word is there that's what your confidence is in but sometimes you need to know Lord I just need to hear from you I just need to know that you're still alive all right and Abram needed that he needed confirmation am you needed confirmation some of y'all fought Devils this week and you come to the house of God and you need confirmation not not me saying it but you need to feel the presence of God you need to see the pillar of fire if I could say it that way maybe you won't see it with these eyes but you'll see you'll see the Holy Spirit moving among the congregation and and it gives you a confidence in knowing that he's here God didn't need those things people say well I don't need it well good for you I do I'm glad glad you're above that but brother brandham wasn't Abraham wasn't Abram said Lord God what wil thou give me sir What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elaser of Damascus he said Lord it's hard for me to understand how you're going to make me a great nation and I don't even have any children right he needed confirmation and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir so he's saying I look at the promise and I look at my current condition and I realize that my current condition doesn't match the promise I believe it will but how Lord would you confirm to me that you that you really mean what you say would you just please give me something I don't believe Abram was wrong to ask that I believe he was he was right where God wanted him to be he's admitting I'm human God I'm human and I've got great faith but I also know that I need a confirmation I need something that I can I can see to know that you're moving among me Among Us now you say well that's wrong that's just for unbelievers well there's never been go go look in the scripture there's never been a person who met God that didn't get some kind of confirmation that they met him right it never did work on just an intellect ual faith it never did work without some kind of confirmation that they'd met God and I'll say well you say well I'm not a very emotional person well you may not be but there's got to be some kind of confirmation there has to be some Supernatural in your life the fact if you've left the world and followed the gospel that's a supernatural thing right that's not a natural thing to do what you're doing it's not a natural thing to live like you live that's a supernatural thing there's got to be some element of Supernatural in your life or you're never going to make it because you're human right and we don't just live for the Lord in an abstract way right we live in a real way in a real world words we we have real hands and real feet and we walk in a real world and we have real marriages and we have we work in real jobs and we need a real God a God who comes down a God who helps us when we have a need a God who's there when we're have a sickness a God who we can feel and we can know sir brother BR said a Believer could feel God and know that he's there and I'm so thankful for that amen we don't put our confidence in feelings we don't put our trust in feelings but it's just a confirmation right a confirmation now he said and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward Heaven all right tell the stars all right if thou be able to number them Abram's looking up there and says one two three 500 5,000 10 million said I can't count them God that's the point right so shall your seed be and he said and he believed belied in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness he believed before it was confirmed but God was gracious to confirm the Covenant now Abraham belongs to God he believes God he's separated from his Kindred but now God is going to confirm his Covenant through the blood with the end result being the Seal of circumcision which is the type of the Holy Ghost and we know after the Covenant is confirmed in chapter 17 Abram is changed to Abraham in chapter 18 he's visited by Elohim and Abraham and Sarah have their bodies changed back now brother BR said what he done to Abraham he did to his seed and we are his seed by faith Romans 4:1 what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by works he hath where of to Glory but not before God other words who can go to God and say I did this right all of our righteousness is filthy rags before God he says if he was justified by works he has to where of to Glory but not before God he said for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is a reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt other words we go to God and say God you owe me this God don't owe us nothing he gave us everything right but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin imputation is placing in an account it's not covering up so in other words it's not it's not an overdraft privilege it's not the bank ignoring the fact that you're overdrawn it's the bank putting money into the account so that you're not overdrawn God don't just leave you in your sin but he imputes righteousness to you by faith and then he makes you righteous he cleans you up as though you never did it in the first place and he makes you want to live for him and he makes you want to follow him and he put the spirit in you to love the word of God and love the people of God that's what God will do listen if that's never happen happen in your life you need to believe God with all your heart when you believe him with all of your heart like Abraham did and you do what God says you obey God's voice you hear the voice of God God will begin to confirm his Covenant in your life Paul argues that his Abraham's righteousness did not come from circumcision but from Faith because the uh the Jews put their confidence in the confirmation of circumcision and watch what he said cometh this blessing to stand upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision he received in other words he was a gentile at the time there was no such thing as a Jewish Nation he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised walk in the steps of that Faith jump to verse 16 therefore it is a faith that it might be by Grace with to the end or with the result listen that the promise might be sure yes sir to all the seed right it was already sure to God yeah he had no question about Abraham's ability to serve him but Abraham had the questions God never laughed but Abraham and Sarah laughed right God never doubted but Abraham and Sarah never doubted when you get the to the biography of Abraham's life it says he never never staggered at the promise of God right but but God never had any God had never had any need to come down and show Abraham these things but Abraham had that need amen oh my oh my it's not that God needs for us to to have a great Revival Among Us and got him moving among us but we need it amen now and I believe he loves it now watch this he said it's a faith to the end or with the result the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all it written I've made the father many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and cth those things which be not as though they were now there had to be a supernatural event this is how God has chosen to work with Humanity that there would be a supernatural event to make the promise sure again not to God but to Abraham and his seed brother Bram says it this way early on in his ministry in 1953 he said the very phenomena of Sarah's womb being dead before Isaac come he said God just let it go on she was 60 years old when she got the promise she was 90 years old before the seed ever was conceived in her perfectly absolutely phenomenal phenomenal other words Supernatural right and the man that's born again is a phenomenal hallelujah it's not accepting or raising up your hand like this he said it's a gift of God phenomenal he said born again taken out of this this world in the realm of Senses yes sir why because you deserve it no because God promised it that the promise might be sure according to the election right so there's a time for raising your hand to accept Christ that that is effective and that you surrender to Christ there's a time uh to be baptized there's a time to do the works of of of repentance and and those things but there needs to be a supernatural birth to confirm your faith that you're a child of God because without that God knows but you don't know are you with me now God knew before you were ever born that you were a child of God but you don't know who you are until you receive his Spirit living inside of you right you can hope you can think you can press you can do all of that you can want to be but there's got to be a supernatural phenominal event right that takes place for you to be born again he said does that to be well will I shout will I run we don't know what you'll do but it'll be Supernatural and I'll say this again if you've come out of the world and something changed you and your desires have changed something supernatural has happened right so now's not a time to doubt Now's the Time to press forward whatever you have and I just tell people this they brother Ben I'm not sure if I've got it whatever you have hold on to that and want more Lord I want more I I want to filling of the Holy Ghost I want a phenomenal event in my life I want you to move in my life whatever I have now I want more of that I want something that keeps me I want something that takes a doubt away from me I want something that seals me to the day of my my uh my my going home I want something I want something that confirms my faith oh every one of us need to have our faith confirmed sometimes now look Genesis 15:7 he said unto him I am the Lord that brought the out of er the Calis to give thee this land to inherit it now notice what he asked he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it other words God I want to be sure I'm I know you called me I know you've led me I believe I'm a Believer but I want to be sure how will I know that I shall inherit it he said unto him take me in heer of three years old and she goat of 3 years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one one against another but the birds divided he not now brother bandham taught us that the sacrifices were divided and they were divided as a type and they were also divided to show the Old and New Testament they were divided in two pieces he said but the turtle dos were not divided because healing Divine Healing was a type of Divine Healing and Divine Healing he said was always by faith right it was in the Old Testament it is in the New Testament but in the Old Testament the way you accessed Grace was not just by believing it but by having a literal sacrifice and then believing in that right having faith in that and putting your hands on that being identified with that but it had to be a literal sacrifice we don't have a literal sacrifice what do we have we have the Lord Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins right so it's a it's a sacrifice once for all we don't have to go cut up a bunch of he goats and she goats and and heers right what are we doing we we just come to church and believe God and trust God but we have the Holy Spirit that comes back on us that shows us that that sacrifice was made and was made for us now uh brother BR said Divine Healing has always been by faith in the old New Testament there's a wonderful teaching there I don't have time to get into it this morning in Genesis 151 it says now now he's divided the sacrifice now think about it for a minute Abraham's gone out there and done what God Said to do right and he's divided the sacrifices cut them in two and he's got half a hepher over here half a heer over there and half a ram over here and half a ram over here and half a she goat over here half of she got over there got them divided he says well now what do I do well the birds were attracted to the carcasses and Abraham knew that whatever God was going to do while God was doing it he had to keep the birds off of it now watch so what did Abram do he just drove him away right you can see him down there among the among all these sacrifices and you know Abraham probably look like a crazy person they say our meetings are crazy you should have went to that meeting brother Allan he's out there get off of there on you bird get get get back huh what's he doing he's got to get rid of the birds oh my cuz the sacrifice had to remain clean had to be holy are you with me now so Abraham's out there shouting wo get get huh sorry I didn't mean to scare you but waving his arms like a mad man Sarah's probably looking at him like what in the world get off of here go away what's he doing he's running the birds off I'm going somewhere now brother Bon notice what he done he took those three animals cut them apart laid them piece by piece and then Abraham got back he said now that was the sacrifice and he watched until the sun was going down and fouls come down out of the air on Abraham sacrifice vultures and Abraham cast them out shoot them away what's this a type of Abraham's seed in the last day casting out Devils from the sacrifice oh Church casting away what's he doing casting out Devils get out of here devil I know sometimes we look silly up here you know brother Andrew come sometimes and preach and open the back door and and whatever open the side door whatever and tell the devil to get out and you think what in the world is he doing well that's what we're called to do right cast out Devils right that's what that's literally what we're called to do Abraham's seed in the last day casting out devils are you with me now he said God he said promised it the sacrifice Christ the same yesterday today and forever and all them unbelieving Spirits trying to devour that's right right so every time you come to church oh my and the word's being preached here come all them unbelieving Spirits right and start to come down try to Devour the sacrifice try to take it away from you or you can't receive your healing you can't be saved you've done too much all this going on in your mind and you're sitting there thinking well I might as well just quit I might as well just give up what's doing that it's a prince of the power of the air the fowls have come down on the sacrifice but it's time for the people of God God to stand up Abraham seed and begin to cast out them Devils now how do we cast out Devils oh my by preaching the word that's right by receiving the word by amaning the word right right brother Bron said give us power today Lord he said through the preaching of the word to cast every devil of doubt and Superstition and fear from the people's hearts and Minds that those who are bound by frustration amen and doubt might be brought into the arms of Christ oh I pray this morning that every bird would be shed away that every doubt every frustration would be Shed off of the sacrifice brother Ben why do you why do you have want to stay in the back and come out and try to be under the anointing and try to try to preach the way you do cuz I've got I got a mandate to Cast Away unbelieving Spirits I don't want people to leave I want those spirits to leave that's right we want spirits to be gone and we'll do what it takes to see those Spirits are gone that's why we set an atmosphere that's why we have a service the way we do we're we're working we're not working in just a natural realm but in a supernatural realm Hallelujah see we can't save nobody me Me By Me me preaching won't save nobody we can't heal nobody that's already done at Calvary brother Stuart can preach all day and never heal nobody never save nobody it's it's already done in Calvary all we can do is cast out Devils by preaching the word that's right now brother brandom goes on you can listen to a sermon called believing God brother brandham talks about this how he cast out Devils by the preaching of the word brother brandham said he would have been saved when he was 12 now you young people you remember that number 12 because so many of you are about to be 12 and remember Samuel was called at 12 years of age to go in and to to be what he was and God called him at that time and give him a message to preach 12 years old and and all the different things that we we talked about brother BR said he would have been saved when he was 12 he said but a spirit of unbelief hung over him telling him not to go to the altar well I wonder how many people would have already been saved already been delivered if it wasn't for that Spirit of unbelief right right and so brother B talks about that and he said he committ IED his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils you ain't going to heal nobody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing I've already done everything you have need of is already paid for but our job is to cast drive them fouls off get them birds away right every time you hear one flapping in get him out of here right he don't belong in here that demon of FL FR rtion of worry that tells you that that well we wonder you know maybe maybe it's all just a show maybe it all don't mean anything maybe it's just emotion drive him out that's right that devil tells you the message isn't right drive him out that devil that tries to tell you you can't be saved drive him out you young people that devil tries to tell well you'd have more fun in the world you'd be better off if youd leave and go out there somewhere and and live your best life drive him away let belief let Faith begin to settle in your heart cuz God's fixing to do something that's right hey man are you with me so far Hallelujah preachers he said stood on the platform and preached the gospel Devils scatter amen that's God's provided way brother Ben do you understand that I don't understand it sir but that's God's provided way right sir oh that's why Paul says he chose by the foolishness of preaching he didn't even say by the foolishness of hearing preaching though that's how faith is increased by the foolishness of preaching right by the fo some will be say listen God chose preaching for that purpose and that's why it's such a a job and we should we should make sure we're doing it the right way we we should make sure we're staying with the message of the hour but God chose preachers if if every preacher was wrong it wouldn't change what God did God chose preachers right preachers stood on the platform and preached the gospel Devils scatter amen he said the man come to the altar under conviction say I want to get saved he said he never saved the man he cast out the devil that's right and the man got saved amen hallelujah I believe God still confirms his word the same way that he did to Abraham we've been given a promise church we believe the message of the hour but we want God to confirm his word and when the fouls come down on the sacrifice let me be one gospel preacher who will stand up there and Sho the fouls off get rid of the fouls get rid of the birds let God begin to move again one of the reasons we go to church get the fouls shoed off the sacrifice oh my the natural Seed of Abraham failed brother bom taught us and they accepted law instead of Grace at SI but there is a seed he said a royal seed with the word stands true am you believe you're Abraham's seed now it's not just the preaching a preacher that cast out Devils It's You cast out Devils too because he said those that believe these signs shall follow them that believe you can cast out devils and I don't believe you have to be loud or or anything like that to cast out a devil but it's just the act of preaching the word is what does it it's the act in you of speaking the word and living the word said if you can't if you're not called to preach he said if you're called get behind the ppit and preach if you're not called to preach he said live a sermon he said oh how Jeffersonville needs thousands of lived voices I say oh how Hardy needs hundreds of thousands of lived [Music] voices I'm G I'm gonna get touch you here for a minute you realize what some of the damage has been done in this area by by people who didn't live it I'm talking many many years ago that's right that's right and and I I'll walk around people tell me you know I told a person recently we all the teachers of William brandom he said oh yeah he lived out on Worth Road no it wasn't him it wasn't him but I want you to think about this look at the damage that's been done over the years that's right look at the good that could be done and has been done amen by somebody who will live it that's right that's right by somebody who's been redeemed by somebody who's Changed by even somebody maybe who didn't live it but does now what a testimony it ought to be to our community to know that that we're not that way anymore we don't do that anymore that's not what we do yeah I was a sinner yeah I may have claimed to be a Christian and didn't live right but now I live for God and we're going to live for God and be a be an army of lived voices and I wonder how many young people there are out there I wonder how many people that grew up in church that that have been beat down by the world and beat down by what people did to them that wouldn't come back to the house of God if they knew there was a lived voice somewhere I say live it in the schools live it in the communities live it at the bank live it on the factory floor live it where in your community where you're at and if there's a seat of God there they'll come to it amen if the damage could be done then it can be undone I hope you're hearing me today there's a sea that stands true casting out Devils doing great signs and wonders somebody's got to do it church let it be me this morning getting all the unbelief away from the word keeping the sacrifice clean keeping the word holy keep it reverenced not put anything with it add anything to it just keeping it away standing on guard let nothing touch it that's what we got to do with the word we'll let nothing touch it if I can't brother B said if I can't fulfill the promise I won't stand in somebody else's way that can there you go that's right the promise is still true we acknowledge the word is right whether we do have always done right or not the word is right that's right the word is right when we come back to that it gives us a freedom of knowing oh I'm not relying on my works I'm relying on him and he can help me to be a lived voice that's right in the world that I live in keep the sacrifice clean keeping the word holy keep it reverence not put anything with it add anything to it just keep it away stand on guard oh let me fulfill that Lord let that become a promise in my life right amen but nothing touch it when the sun was going down deep sleep fell upon Abram l a horror of great Darkness fell upon on him brother brandom said the deep sleep was a type of death which we all must come to we don't go by way of the Rapture we're going to go by way of the Grave that's right the horror of Darkness was hell which without his Mercy all of us would be there all of us would be there amen without his Mercy Genesis 15:13 begins to speak to Abram while he's in this condition he said to Abram no of aury thy seed shall be a stranger and the land that is not there shall serve them they shall afflict them 400 years also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge afterward shall they come out with great substance thou shall go to thy fathers in peace thou shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces he was torn apart on Calvary do we believe that and the pillar of fire came down after his body was broken was separated into his church and now brother brandom taught us that the spirit that's in US must dovetail with that Spirit just like the pieces of the animal would fit back together the B said they kill an animal standing between it tear the piece of goat skin apart he said one took one and and when the Covenant was confirmed they brought the pieces together and they had to dovetail just exactly now what God is showing him here is this on these sacrifices speaking of Christ how God took Jesus to Calvary and tore him apart and received the body up into heaven and sent the spirit down upon us that the same Spirit was on him has to be on you to dtail with the body to be the bride at the end time you can't be the bride without the power of the Holy Ghost right it takes that to be the bride even though you're called to that but what that tells me is every person who's predestined to it will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you don't have to worry about it you just go and and claim it and believe it and receive it and you'll experience it right because it is a definite experience sir now he said what God is showing him here is speaking of Christ he sent the spirit that was on him and has to duvail to be the bride at the end time now he said in this we find when they made this Covenant in them days they drew it out on a piece of sheep skin or leather and once they kill killed then they killed an animal and stood between the pieces he said and and uh he said stood between the pieces and cut it this their Covenant into two their words pulled into two like that I don't have a piece of paper up here but he actually took a piece of paper and he tore it into two and when the paper was torn into then the two pieces would fit back together but they would be the only things that would fit back together it would be very hard very difficult to to replicate that he said so it could not be duplicated he said now we see he said in this also in this Covenant that he showed there what he would do how God would tear apart Christ Jesus and the body was raised up sits on the right hand of God Majesty on high and the spirit of Christ was brought down upon the earth now the Bible tells us if we are christs then we are Abraham's seed because he was the royal Seed of Abraham right he said and HS according to the promise now get back with me for a minute I know I lost you there for a minute but come on back it's all right he Saidi am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit someone say much fruit for without me you can do nothing nothing amen it takes him all right John 14:12 verily verily I say un you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father right yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also a little while and the world seeth me no more the world there is the Greek word Cosmos which means World Order sees me no more yet you shall see me I being a personal pronoun I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what does that mean Church it means he still confirms his Covenant with Believers by filling them with his spirit and by producing his Works through them to the world right he is still a supernatural God who is able to take care of any problem do we believe that or don't we believe it Church he's able to take care of every situation he's able to to to we can believe him for any issue big or small a little while in the world won't see me but you'll see me because I'll be with you and even in you now brother Brandon said to believe the word is to receive the word and to let it become life he said now God showing there how he was confirming this Covenant it has to be that way the church not an organization not a denomination but the individual and God has to become the Same Spirit that's God's purpose in the beginning to become the Same Spirit now the turtle do and the pigeon but the said we're related Eve come from Adam's side right the same spirit that dwelt in Christ dwells in us he confirms his Covenant to us when the Covenant is manifested in our lives it brings forth Faith now watch Abraham believed God but he needed a confirmation of his faith and God gave him what he needed then I believe that if we need a confirmation God will give us one sir it may not confirm it to the world in fact the world might have called what Abraham saw crazy but to Abraham because he was a Believer it confirmed his faith see when God comes and settles down over you and you begin to feel the presence of God you begin to know God in a very real way you may not you may not feel it or you may not be able to express that to other people as far as they may look at that and say well that's just emotion but to you it becomes a confirmation of Faith that's right now to a person that had no faith there's no confirmation but to a person who has faith it becomes a confirmation you can say he's here I can feel him I know that he's real why because you already had Faith to believe it right now are you with you so far I'm trying to preach fast because we had a lot of ground to cover but we're doing good now how does he confirm his word his word is the Covenant how many believe that everything God said is what he has promised to do yes that's powerful brother West everything in the scripture is what God promised to do do right and and then what does he do the message of the hour comes and takes these promises and makes them real in our day right makes them real to us shines light on those promises so we can look at the message of the hour and see God's interpretation of how those promises would be revealed in our day and what promises are for our day and we know that there are specific signs and Promises confirmations for particular ages but we know that there are some that follow just follow Believers now Mark 16:5 he said to them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well it sounds like Supernatural to me so then after the Lord had spoke unto them right we read on he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere why because God told them to right preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following God will do that if we just ask I I don't like it you know I was raised in an overly you know we were every little thing was a sign and things like that and so I got my I I I keep quiet about a lot of things God's moving Among Us he's doing something I can see it in your lives I can see it on your faces when I preach God's doing something we don't need to forget that we had a very simple thing happened not long ago uh sister uh uh Pucket was Sister Jessica was in church and it was a very simple thing that that that happen happen but it's powerful she come up and and that's a big thing for her she's not here this morning they may be watching at home but it's a big thing for her to come up and brother Logan you know that to come up front to be prayed for she got a lot of anxiety and things and and and so for her to come up front was a big deal and and she come up to be prayed for and I believe that's that's just what the word says to do amen it says if you need healing call for the Elders of the church right it's not always wait until something they call for you but you call them and so she did that and she come up to be prayed for and and we prayed for her and I gave her a prayer cloth I said go put that under your pillow you just believe God and it'll be okay she was losing her hair and and she made a public testimony of it so I will as well when when she uh when she went home immediately her hair began to start growing back and things begin to happen and she got her hair back he said that's a little thing but you know we're we're we overcome by the by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony right brother Andrew Glover was in uh in up at brother Ben Beard's Church recently preaching and he's talking to me on the phone on a Sunday morning and I was telling him about that that had happened and he and he told me wow that's that's powerful he said that morning there was a a sister in that church that had the same issue and he didn't know nothing about it he said she come up to be prayed for and he said I just got off the phone with brother Ben PR telling me that God did this for a sister in his church he said I believe he can do it for you see it's not just for us it's for somebody else and that you say that's a little thing but aren't there some little things maybe that you have need of that God's able to do I believe he can do it and we don't make a big deal about things and try to promote ourselves we're just here to preach the word and to drive the Devils off and let the word settle down Among Us and the word will produce the results because signs follow the Believers and I believe that there are believers here this morning I believe you are believers some of youall have great testimonies coming out of the world and being changed and and drinking and smoking and drugs and everything else and coming out and some of it happened years ago some of it recently and you come out of all that you come back to the house of God and God saved you and changed you and I believe every one of you sitting here this morning is a testimony of what God can do we look so much at what people have been why don't we look look at what God made those people why don't we look at where they're at today yeah they they they did wrong and they failed but look where they're at they didn't stop they didn't quit because God called them sir God saved them and God changed them and I'm believing for every one of you I know not everybody we look at that sometimes say Well everybody's not where I am well I'm glad you're farther up the road but there may be something in your life that that needs a little structure too a little change too I said Lord when I come to the house of God let me be changed let me be Washed by the Water of the word no matter what condition I'm in but give them Grace cuz you were there one day you were there one day sir give them Grace to grow too see preaching the gospel now brother brandham says this I've got to get this brother Bram said that is the general orders from Jesus Christ to be carried out until the day he returns yeah that's what we got to do preach the word let God confirm it that's the general orders now what if they left there and only told the story but nothing ever happened how many Christians would there be think about this Christianity spread all over the world like wildfire not just because they told the story but because it was confirmed right brother brand said it didn't even stir up the devil when they all received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but when a person got healed he said that really stirred him up why because it was confirmation right because the devil doubts if you have the Holy Ghost he don't know right he doubts it he might know I don't know but but what one way or the other he he can make you doubt it try to sure he will that's his job but but if somebody getss healed like that's evident right it's evident he sees that he knows that that's why he fights it so much look so he said he fought Divine Healing that's when they really cracked down on the church is when the lame man walked because everybody knew he was lame sir and everybody knew he got up yes sir and I say what a great testimony it is not when a a well man walks but when a lame man walks when a sinner comes to God and they are saved and they begin to walk right and act right what a blessing that is amen everywhere those Believers went they preached the gospel they didn't just tell the story but the B said Paul said the word came in power as well as voice the word preach actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the Consciousness consciousness of men came say it consciousness of men that but and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel word and God confirmed that word with signs following oh my the sick were healed Devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action listen that word has never failed someone say never failed it has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians how many believing Christians do we have here it has never failed oh my speak it this morning I am saved I am healed I am going to heaven it has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians oh that's powerful and in this last stage it is here stronger and greater than ever I believe that church I believe he knew what he was talking about you said well the church has failed we need to go do something else reinvent the wheel no we we have what God promised us we would have that word is stronger and greater than ever in the true word br oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom do you believe that today do are you that little flock do you believe one day he'll give you the kingdom see God still supernaturally confirms his word if you believe the that we find here after Abraham had done all these great things believing God holding to the promise separating himself and all along following out the way of carrying of The Commandments of the lord we find out that God appeared to to him at the altar and Abraham asked him the question he said now who is my Heir but this elaser of Damascus and now you promis me a seed and I want you to do something I want you to confirm this promise to me and God said he would confirm it to Abraham confirming the Covenant he had made between him and Abraham he's going to give him a sign that it's going to be true that even though he's old he's about 85 now but yet he's going to give proof to him Pro to him by a sign he's going to keep that Covenant you saw you said I thought signs were just for unbelievers no cuz look what the prophet said oh I'm so glad that God always gives the signs right the unbelievers won't believe it anyway right what does a sign do to the unbeliever it judges the unbeliever the sign is not why you believe it confirms the faith you already have are you with me now he said we ought to know today that the hour that we're now living there is supposed to be a sign in the Earth at this time were to look for that sign he's speaking of the sign of the son of man what he called the Messianic sign when Jesus come to Jerusalem God confirmed his word by manifesting his word you remember the story I'm closing in just a moment but you remember the story how that he come riding on a donkey and the people were gathered there and and and in fact the scripture tells us that they were gathered there because they heard about Lazarus right and they saw what God did with Lazarus and so they were gathered along the road and they laid palm branches in his way you remember the story and brother brandom said that talked about how there were three kinds of Believers there and and each one some were some were curious what was going on some were against it but some were really true believers and they laid The Palms in the way and they began to cry out Hosanna to him he that cometh uh to God from God in the highest and they begin to cry these things and what happens the Pharisees said make them shut up and and Jesus said if these keep their silence he said the stones will cry out right but what was it God was confirming his word on the mountain God was keeping his word oh my confirming his word by doing what he promised he would do oh my now look he was going to do that for Abraham he's done that for us now brother brandom talks about Mount Sunset and we all know what happened on Mount Sunset that's where the Angels gathered with brother brandom and they formed a cloud now you may not believe that I believe that right what's the difference in us well I believe and you don't believe right I mean that's the only difference because you can't prove it didn't happen right you say prove it happened well prove to me Jesus even lived you can't do that by science but we believe it don't we right some people try to cast doubt on that the thing is if they'd apply that to every area of their life they'd be insane that's right because you got to believe something H prove prove that your wife loves you that's tough prove your H prove your husband loves you you can't prove love right they could be Faking It come on church but you believe it why do you believe it you love them too right I believe this message because I love this message amen there's something inside of me that cries out and says that's right it's not me it's something inside of me something inside of you crying out that's right I believe those Seven Angels were there I believe they formed a cloud and then they took a picture a few days before a few days after they took a picture of the cloud as it was traveling now uh and and we have that picture now brother Brandon said what's happened upon Mount Sunset happened on a mountain brother brand called sunset Mountain or Sunset Peak there in Arizona it's go it's God confirming his word amen he still confirms his word that's what all this noise is about it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelation 10 1-7 1:7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the the son of man shall be revealed watch what's he saying God promised it we believed it he has confirmed it oh what confidence that ought to give us today the B said the observatories all them in Tucson are still asking research of science trying to find out what it is so high they can't be fog Mis or nothing up there what it what did it where's it at they're just as puzzled of that Supernatural Halo hanging under in the sky as they were when the Magi come in following a star saying where is he this born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word there shall rise a star out of Jacob and the god of Heaven promised evening time would have evening lights three years ago he said this mystery was a prophecy this was in 1965 he's referring to a sermon he preached in 1962 called is this the sign of the end sir when he talked about the seven Thunders and Revelation 10 1-7 and he and he and he prophesied what would happen and then it become a reality listen what he's saying three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is sir but now it's history it's ped the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever do we believe that today you can have confidence in the message of the hour just the same as Abraham had confidence God he he confirmed his word go listen to Jehovah Gyra number one in 1964 when brother Brandon preaches that and he preaches the sermon but he doesn't stop at the sermon what does he do at the end he begins to reveal the secrets of their heart he said this is God confirming his word just like he did to Abraham God confirming oh I believe he's still confirming his word today God didn't die when brother
