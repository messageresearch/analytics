[41:12] it went a lot longer than they thought
[41:14] and man it was good to see him already
[41:16] back in church on a Sunday aren't we
[41:17] thankful For What the Lord Has Done For
[41:19] Us amen makes us want to just shout a
[41:21] little bit but let's get right into the
[41:23] word of the Lord First Kings 10 verse1
[41:26] and when the queen of Sheba heard of the
[41:28] fame of Solomon concerning the name of
[41:29] the Lord she came to prove him with hard
[41:32] questions and she came to Jerusalem with
[41:35] a very great train with camels that bear
[41:37] spices and very much gold and precious
[41:40] stones and when she was come to Solomon
[41:43] she communed with him of all that was in
[41:45] her heart and Solomon told her all her
[41:48] questions that were that was not
[41:50] anything hid from the King which he told
[41:53] her
[41:53] not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen
[41:56] all Solomon's wisdom wiom and the house
[41:57] that he had built and the meat of his
[41:59] table and the sitting of his servants
[42:01] and the attendance of his ministers and
[42:03] their apparel and his cut bearers and
[42:05] his Ascent by which he went up into the
[42:07] house of the Lord there was no more
[42:10] spirit in her and she said to the king
[42:12] it was a true report that I heard in my
[42:15] own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom
[42:18] how be it I believed not the words until
[42:20] I came and my eyes had seen it and
[42:23] behold the half was not told me thy
[42:25] wisdom and prosper ity exceedthehype
[42:57] the Earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[43:00] and behold a greater than Solomon is
[43:04] here and you may be seated may the Lord
[43:05] add His blessings to the word and just
[43:08] tonight just to lay a background this
[43:11] queen and she I don't know if you know
[43:12] if you've ever looked on a map to see
[43:14] how far she traveled but it was
[43:16] approximately it's believed to be around
[43:17] 1250 mil on Camel so it's a long trip
[43:21] and it's in it's in the Middle East
[43:23] there around Sudan I believe it is and
[43:26] Sai Arabia right there in Saudi Arabia
[43:28] next to the Red Sea and she travels
[43:30] about 1250 miles approximately uh on by
[43:35] by way of camel to see this man who has
[43:39] a gift of God just think about that
[43:41] because she wanted to see if it was if
[43:43] it was true and so she had hard
[43:45] questions for him and she wanted to try
[43:47] the gift and see if it was real but now
[43:49] I want you to notice something she
[43:50] wasn't going to see God himself and and
[43:54] she wasn't going to see I mean even a
[43:56] prophet necessarily but she wanted to
[43:58] try the gift that the man had and see if
[44:01] it was true now she was not a Believer
[44:03] brother brandham said she was she was an
[44:05] unbeliever she was just a uh she was
[44:07] just a a person of the day she was
[44:09] serving other gods she didn't serve uh
[44:11] the god of Solomon and so she comes from
[44:14] the uttermost parts of the earth and and
[44:17] she comes to Palestine there and she was
[44:20] uh all the way brother Bram said across
[44:22] the Sahara Desert and he said uh and he
[44:24] talks about it and he goes in in depth
[44:26] and I love the story because of the
[44:29] sacrifices that she made yet not a
[44:31] Christian and not a Believer and had no
[44:33] idea if what she had heard was even real
[44:35] when she got there but when she got
[44:37] there she tried to she tried the gift
[44:40] and she gave hard questions and and he
[44:42] was able to tell her every secret of her
[44:44] heart and everything and and he was to
[44:47] show amen that there was a real gift
[44:49] there and there was something great in
[44:51] in Solomon now I want you to notice that
[44:53] Jesus would also say that a greater than
[44:56] Solomon is here so when you're coming
[44:58] out here to see on the house of in the
[45:00] house of God on a Wednesday night amen
[45:02] it's not to see a man it's not to see
[45:04] even to hear the words of a prophet amen
[45:06] or see the gift and action of a prophet
[45:09] but what you're coming to see is God
[45:11] himself because of greater than Solomon
[45:13] is in the house of God a greater than
[45:15] Solomon is among us tonight a greater
[45:18] than any man or a greater than a prophet
[45:20] is here to reveal every secret of your
[45:23] heart tonight so I'm here to tell you
[45:25] that it's worth the effort to come out
[45:27] to church on a Wednesday night why
[45:29] because God is here to meet you and it's
[45:31] more than just a prophet it's more than
[45:34] just a king it's more listen church it's
[45:36] God himself that is here to meet you
[45:38] tonight and he knows every need every
[45:40] every problem you're going through every
[45:42] situation that may look too hard nothing
[45:45] is impossible with my God nothing is too
[45:47] hard for God and I'm I'm I'm glad to say
[45:50] tonight that I've seen you know we can
[45:52] see by video the gift in action in our
[45:54] day and we can hear the words of a
[45:56] prophet but I want to remind you that it
[45:58] is more than just a prophet that we're
[46:00] following but it is God that is moving
[46:02] in our day using his men using his gifts
[46:06] and and we're not looking for something
[46:08] more we're not looking for that to come
[46:10] again but we're looking to see that
[46:13] Jesus is the author and the finisher and
[46:15] mean it's all about him it's all about
[46:17] God in our day and so it's not just a
[46:20] man it's not just to travel that far
[46:22] it's not you're not giving your money to
[46:24] a man you're not giving your time to a
[46:26] man but you're giving it to God can you
[46:28] say amen amen so brother Brandon would
[46:30] talk about this and he actually talks
[46:31] about humility in the fifth seal and I
[46:34] like I I want to throw this in there
[46:36] just as a as a foundation he said what
[46:38] makes God great is because he can make
[46:40] himself so simple and that's what makes
[46:42] him great God is great and can make
[46:45] himself in such a simple form that the
[46:48] wise of this world can't find him and
[46:50] they just find they just can't find him
[46:52] because he makes himself too simple now
[46:54] he said watch this in itself is the The
[46:57] Mystery of the revelation of Jesus
[46:59] Christ see he said this in itself
[47:02] there's can be nothing greater than God
[47:04] can you say Amen there come on somebody
[47:06] there's no Prophet greater than our God
[47:09] there's no gift greater than our God
[47:11] there's nothing greater than our God and
[47:13] he is his work can you say amen and so
[47:16] brother brand would go on and he would
[47:17] say he said nothing greater than God you
[47:19] can't make anything he said as simple as
[47:22] he makes himself see and that's what
[47:24] makes him great because God has come in
[47:28] Simplicity in our day can you say amen
[47:30] amen so you could look at the at the
[47:32] gift that that brother brandham came
[47:34] with and say well was was that God no
[47:36] that wasn't God Amen the gift was not
[47:39] God God was using the man and using the
[47:41] man to perform a gift through the man
[47:44] but don't get don't mistake the man for
[47:46] God don't mistake the gift for God
[47:49] because God was using the man and God is
[47:52] the one that that performed the gift but
[47:54] but listen church it's more than that he
[47:56] is Among Us us he is a living God he
[47:59] listen the worst thing you can do is
[48:01] make a god of history and and try to
[48:03] keep him in history because if he ever
[48:06] was then he still is and if he ever did
[48:09] anything then he's still more than able
[48:11] to do the same thing today so brother BR
[48:14] would go on like this he said there
[48:15] isn't anything in this life satis
[48:18] satisfying as it may be as good and as
[48:21] fine as it may be but you'll find the
[48:23] sum total of all perfection in Christ
[48:27] thank you Lord everything Fades into
[48:29] insignificance beside him he that hath
[48:32] the Key of David this beautiful phrase
[48:34] he said follows and comes out of the
[48:36] preceding phrase he that is true Christ
[48:38] the perfect realization contrasted with
[48:41] partial realization he said here it is
[48:43] Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus
[48:45] liken to Moses was the prophet of God
[48:48] and he said David was a man after God's
[48:50] Own Heart was king of Israel but Jesus
[48:52] is the greater David he said he said now
[48:55] King of Kings Lord of lords God very God
[48:57] now David was born of the tribe of Judah
[49:00] out of whom no priest came yet he ate of
[49:02] the showbread reserved for priest he was
[49:04] the great warrior overcoming the enemy
[49:07] establishing the people as king he sat
[49:10] on the throne he was a prophet he was a
[49:12] wonderful type of Christ but now
[49:14] remember you couldn't Elevate David to
[49:17] Christ because he was just a type of
[49:19] Christ I want to get somewhere I hope
[49:20] you're still with me tonight in 1 John
[49:23] 4:4 he says ye are of God little
[49:25] children and have overcome them because
[49:28] greater is he that is in you than he
[49:31] that is in the world I know we hear that
[49:32] phrase all the time but greater is he
[49:35] than the trouble you're in Greater is he
[49:38] than the circumstances surrounding you
[49:40] greater is he than the problems that are
[49:42] trying to overtake your life greater is
[49:44] he than any sickness that would come on
[49:46] your body I I think tonight we need to
[49:48] just give praise to God because he is
[49:51] great and he still does Miracles and he
[49:53] still brings us out of bondage and he
[49:55] still sets the captives free he is great
[49:58] and I believe that he is more powerful
[50:01] here tonight than he's ever been why
[50:03] because he he's he's proven himself time
[50:06] after time that he's if he's done it for
[50:08] the the children of Israel then brother
[50:10] Bill he can do it for us here tonight
[50:12] amen God does not change he is no
[50:14] respector of persons he doesn't just
[50:16] come to a prophet but he comes to the
[50:18] lowest of the low amen he came to
[50:20] Simon's house and he didn't come to the
[50:22] religious people in Simon's house but he
[50:24] revealed himself to a woman that had an
[50:26] ill Fame and and had done all kinds of
[50:29] bad things but I want you to notice
[50:30] something he was the greater one in the
[50:32] room and they failed to recognize it but
[50:34] the one that recognized the greatness of
[50:37] Jesus was the one who would re would
[50:39] would reap the benefits of Christ's
[50:41] coming and I want to say tonight if we
[50:42] could recognize that he is the great one
[50:45] there's no big eyes and no big eyes and
[50:47] little 's there's there you know all the
[50:49] spokes in a bicycle wheel of the same
[50:51] size but I want you to notice something
[50:53] there is somebody who is greater than
[50:55] the spoke and the will and amen he is
[50:57] the Hub he is the center of it all he is
[50:59] the whe in the middle of the whe he is
[51:01] Christ he is all things to the believer
[51:04] can you say amen he said he said he that
[51:07] is in you he is Christ brother brand
[51:09] said as John said he that's in you is
[51:11] greater than he that's in the world and
[51:12] that was Christ he is greater than all
[51:14] the world because he conquered the world
[51:16] and is the greater than all those things
[51:19] because he conquers it he conquered it
[51:21] for us can you say amen and he said we
[51:24] are more than conquerors through him him
[51:27] that loved us and gave himself for us so
[51:30] we are not the conquerors unless we're
[51:32] in him amen it's got to be through him
[51:35] there's got to be somebody greater he
[51:36] already conquered the world for us can
[51:40] the church say Amen tonight and he said
[51:41] we're more than conquerors why he said
[51:43] he gave himself for us that he might
[51:44] come back and do his Works through us to
[51:47] prove to us that he is the same
[51:50] yesterday today and forever now brother
[51:53] brand would go on he said in the name of
[51:54] Jesus Christ of Nazareth renounce your
[51:56] sickness cuz greater is he that's in you
[51:59] than the devil that's trying to take
[52:00] your life you are children of God you
[52:03] are the redeemed somebody ought to
[52:05] testify tonight I'm a Child of God I am
[52:08] the redeemed I am bought with a price
[52:10] can you say Amen am mean the blood of
[52:12] Jesus has covered all your past sins and
[52:16] mistakes if he did it for your past
[52:18] he'll do it for your
[52:19] future well can you say amen amen I
[52:22] think the Church of God we've looked at
[52:24] all the problems around us long enough
[52:26] let's look to to him the author and
[52:28] finisher of our faith I know it's easy
[52:29] to get critical and it's easy to get a
[52:32] spirit on us where we we get nothing out
[52:33] of church but it's time that we realize
[52:36] that we didn't come to see one another
[52:37] and we didn't come to criticize but we
[52:40] came to meet with him who is worthy of
[52:42] our time thank you so brother Brandon
[52:44] would go on like this he said then what
[52:46] about Healing The Sick sea greater is he
[52:48] that's in you than the sickness SE
[52:50] because that's an interruption
[52:52] interrupting the very laws of God
[52:54] sickness is so if You' got a sick in
[52:56] your life that's just an interruption in
[52:58] the laws of God that's not something
[53:00] that that was not that was not God
[53:02] giving you the sickness and he allowed
[53:04] it to come on you amen maybe just to
[53:06] show his glory in your life amen I
[53:08] wonder if sometimes the trouble we're
[53:10] going through maybe we we we we we gripe
[53:13] about the problem but what about trying
[53:14] to trying to get a testimony out of that
[53:17] problem and saying Lord I know I'm going
[53:19] through a trial but I believe on the
[53:20] other side there's going to be Victory
[53:22] because you're with me and you've
[53:24] already conquered this problem for me
[53:26] amen I believe tonight we need a
[53:27] positive testimony and leave the things
[53:30] of negativity in the past and press
[53:32] forward towards the mark of the High
[53:34] Calling come on somebody tonight I know
[53:37] that we've had a lot of negativity in
[53:38] our lives and I know the world is a
[53:40] negative place to live in but tonight if
[53:42] you could look to the greater one that
[53:44] is Among Us amen he is greater than
[53:47] every situation that you'll go through
[53:49] he's greater than the prison bars that
[53:52] Paul and Silas were behind amen he's
[53:54] greater than the bills that you can't
[53:56] pay he's greater than all the things
[53:58] that have come against you every devil
[54:00] that has come against your family he's
[54:02] greater than that here tonight amen if
[54:04] you could see the greater one among us
[54:06] then I believe all your troubles amen
[54:08] they'd look a lot smaller to you amen
[54:10] all your sickness amen you'd start to
[54:11] see healings come in your family why
[54:14] because he is greater and he is worthy
[54:17] of Our Praise because he's great and he
[54:19] does Miracles so great and and and I
[54:21] believe he's still doing that today you
[54:24] say what are you preaching tonight I'm
[54:25] trying to tell you that if a if a queen
[54:27] could travel 1,50 Mi on the back of a
[54:29] camel just to see a gift what are we
[54:32] what ought we to do today to see a
[54:34] living God and a living bride and among
[54:36] his people amen we ought to lay aside
[54:39] everything that would try to stop us and
[54:41] lay aside every sin and lay aside every
[54:43] little critical spirit and every kind of
[54:46] thing that would try to hold us from a
[54:47] blessing I say lay it aside tonight and
[54:50] put your focus back on the one who is
[54:53] greater can the church say amen amen
[54:55] because great he deserves to be
[54:58] worshiped when we come to church amen I
[55:00] I I know there's all kinds of things
[55:03] sometimes I'll sit there and it's too
[55:04] hot sometimes it might be too cold for
[55:06] somebody and you know what we all have
[55:08] our problems and we are all built
[55:10] different and we like things in a
[55:11] different way amen but it's all about
[55:13] him in the house of God it's all about
[55:16] what he can do for us amen it's a
[55:18] meeting place where God has chose to
[55:21] meet us and he's and if he and if he
[55:23] promised to be here then I think we need
[55:25] to re recognize that he is the greater
[55:28] one Among Us amen you can put the
[55:30] greatest preacher in the World Behind
[55:31] the pulpit but if God doesn't show up
[55:34] then the greater one's not there amen
[55:36] you can put the you can put the uh you
[55:38] can put the lowest preacher on the totem
[55:40] pole behind the pulpit I want to tell
[55:42] you tonight if God shows up then God can
[55:44] speak through I mean he can speak
[55:46] through anything that he wants to use he
[55:49] can speak through anybody he can speak
[55:50] to his people why because he's more than
[55:53] able to do whatever he wants to do
[55:57] because he is the greater one he is the
[56:00] great God Amen and I love this brother
[56:02] Brandon would say well well the greater
[56:04] is he that's in you that's the Healer
[56:06] that and the Creator than the devil
[56:09] that's interrupted the very program of
[56:10] your life greater is he that's in you
[56:13] than he that's in the world see greater
[56:15] was he that was in Elijah greater was he
[56:17] that was in that was in Isaiah than he
[56:20] said the time was or any of those
[56:22] prophets because they seen past the time
[56:24] see greater is he that was in job even
[56:27] the skin worms and death in the grave
[56:29] because he said by a vision he said he
[56:31] he saw the coming of the Lord and he
[56:33] said My Redeemer liveth and at the last
[56:34] days he'll stand upon the Earth and
[56:36] though the skin worms destroy this body
[56:39] yet in my flesh shall I see God see
[56:41] greater is he that was in job than the
[56:44] death greater because he said death
[56:46] tried to take him and couldn't do it it
[56:49] couldn't do it because he said I'll rise
[56:50] up again and he did now I want to notice
[56:53] I want you to notice tonight amen death
[56:55] might try to take you out out of this
[56:56] body but death can't take you out of of
[56:59] the body that he has prepared for you
[57:01] because death has already been conquered
[57:04] can you say amen amen you might die in
[57:06] this body but you can't die in the body
[57:08] that God has already prepared for you
[57:11] why because he came to overcome death
[57:14] hell in the grave and I want you to know
[57:16] tonight that it's not just about about
[57:18] about dying and and listen we all talk
[57:21] about death and and you know
[57:23] statistically 10 out of 10 die
[57:27] I didn't know if you knew that or not
[57:28] but unless the Rapture comes we're all
[57:29] going to be down there seeing Joe but I
[57:31] want you to notice tonight not the young
[57:34] ones he might go first but I want you to
[57:36] notice tonight that even if that should
[57:38] take you then death still didn't win
[57:41] right that's right well can you say man
[57:44] why because the the the devil is the
[57:47] author of those things amen death came
[57:49] by the fall and we are not in listen our
[57:52] theophany body the body that is waiting
[57:54] for us is not in a fall State oh come on
[57:57] somebody but that body that is waiting
[57:59] for us is just like his glorious body oh
[58:03] I wish I could preach here for a minute
[58:05] I believe if you'll get a revelation
[58:07] that no matter what happens to this body
[58:09] you've got one already waiting on you
[58:11] because the greater one went to Calvary
[58:14] and shed his blood so that you wouldn't
[58:16] have to die and go to hell am mean if
[58:18] the blood's over you brother Bill amen
[58:20] you're just as close to a new body now
[58:22] as you've ever been amen but that body
[58:24] though though it may Decay and though
[58:26] may lay in the grave one of these days
[58:28] and me that is not the finality of a
[58:30] Christian because we have someone
[58:33] something already waiting for us why
[58:35] because the greater one showed his works
[58:38] the greater one sister Janie amen he
[58:40] said I'll give you life Everlasting
[58:42] anden the greater one is in the room
[58:44] here tonight and if you've got a problem
[58:46] you don't have to wait till Sunday
[58:48] morning the greater one can take care of
[58:50] your situation the greater one why
[58:54] because he said he'd meet us can we just
[58:56] go ahead and say Lord I know you're here
[58:59] I may not feel you here but I know
[59:01] you're here and the greater one Among Us
[59:04] and if he's so great then we ought to
[59:06] just show up with such anticipation that
[59:09] we're going to meet the king of kings
[59:11] and the Lord of lords amen it's greater
[59:13] than meeting the president of the United
[59:14] States it's meeting the the the King of
[59:17] Kings amen it's meeting Christ himself
[59:19] why because he promised to be here and
[59:22] he does not break a promise thank you
[59:24] Lord he doesn't break a promise brother
[59:26] BR would go on he said he said it like
[59:28] this excuse me 1 Chronicles if you got
[59:30] that 1st chronicles 16 16:25 for great

[59:35] and also is to be feared Above All Gods
[59:39] can you say amen for all the gods of the
[59:41] people are Idols but the Lord made the
[59:44] heavens well the church ought to say
[59:45] amen amen do you realize who you're
[59:47] serving tonight it is not just a god a
[59:49] far off but it is a present tense God it
[59:52] is an OM omniscient God Amen he's
[59:54] everywhere you go amen he he knows
[59:57] everything you do he knows every trouble
[59:59] he knows every trial he knows every time
[1:00:01] you you you failed him amen but if
[1:00:04] you'll just get on your knees and say
[1:00:05] Lord I failed you but I'm coming humbly
[1:00:07] back to you he is faithful and just to
[1:00:10] forgive you why because he is the
[1:00:12] greater one Among Us it's hard for for
[1:00:16] sometimes for a human being to forgive
[1:00:18] and forget amen but once you have been
[1:00:20] forgiven he not only forgets it but he
[1:00:23] wipes it off and puts it in the sea of
[1:00:25] forget this brother Justin amen he no
[1:00:27] longer sees what you did he don't even
[1:00:30] see those past sins and the past
[1:00:32] mistakes once they're under the blood
[1:00:34] they're gone for good because the
[1:00:36] greater one can you say amen amen amen
[1:00:38] verse 27 he says it like this Glory and
[1:00:41] Honor are in his presence strength and
[1:00:44] gladness are in his place give unto the
[1:00:46] Lord ye kindreds of the people give unto
[1:00:48] the Lord glory and strength we ought to
[1:00:50] give him glory here tonight give unto
[1:00:52] the Lord the glory do unto his name
[1:00:55] bring an offering and come before him
[1:00:56] Worship the Lord in the beauty of his
[1:00:59] Holiness well the church ought to say
[1:01:00] amen amen these are the words of God not
[1:01:02] the words of a man amen he said fear
[1:01:05] before him all the Earth the world also
[1:01:07] shall be stable that it be not moved let
[1:01:10] the heavens be glad and let the Earth
[1:01:12] rejoice and let men say among the
[1:01:14] Nations the lord reth well can you say
[1:01:17] praise the Lord here tonight amen the
[1:01:19] Lord Reign is Let the Sea Roar and the
[1:01:21] fullness thereof let the field rejoice
[1:01:23] and all that therein is then shall the
[1:01:26] Trees of the wood sing out at the
[1:01:27] presence of the Lord because he cometh
[1:01:29] to judge the Earth and I love this one
[1:01:31] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[1:01:34] good for his mercy endureth forever amen
[1:01:38] it's not just till tomorrow not just
[1:01:41] till the next day but if you've got a
[1:01:43] problem his mercies endure forever if
[1:01:45] you've got a situation that seems like
[1:01:47] you can't get past it he endures forever
[1:01:50] well can you say Amen tonight if you've
[1:01:52] got loved ones that are not saved his
[1:01:54] Mercy endures for forever and I believe
[1:01:57] he's here tonight and his mercies are
[1:01:59] still in enduring forever well can you
[1:02:01] say man I love this in Psalms 964 for
[1:02:05] the Lord is great can you say the Lord
[1:02:08] is great and greatly to be praised and
[1:02:12] he said he is to be feared above all
[1:02:14] gods in Psalms 868 he said among the
[1:02:17] gods there is none like unto thee Oh
[1:02:20] Lord neither are there any works like
[1:02:22] under thy Works amen so it is not the
[1:02:24] man's works but it is the Lord that is
[1:02:27] working through the man amen the Lord is
[1:02:29] speaking through man am mean it's the
[1:02:31] voice of God it's the actions of God all
[1:02:34] the time and if we could ever realize
[1:02:36] look past the humanity look past the
[1:02:38] mistakes look past all these things and
[1:02:40] realize the greater one came Among Us in
[1:02:43] our day and he it wasn't brother brandom
[1:02:45] standing there and revealing the secrets
[1:02:47] of the hearts but it was the greater one
[1:02:50] that would come on the platform and
[1:02:51] stand with him and it would discern the
[1:02:53] hearts of the people and it would never
[1:02:55] miss why because it wasn't brother
[1:02:57] brandom doing it but it was the greater
[1:02:59] one that was there with him I want to
[1:03:00] tell you tonight we're not following a
[1:03:02] man but we're following the greater one
[1:03:04] that used the man is that okay I know
[1:03:08] we're following a man but as he followed
[1:03:10] Christ remember he had to be in Christ
[1:03:12] he had to be in tune with God in order
[1:03:15] for the gift to operate and mean
[1:03:17] sometimes he would stand at the platform
[1:03:18] and he would say I'm waiting on him
[1:03:20] because I'm just as helpless as any
[1:03:22] other man well can you say Amen
[1:03:26] I'm just as helpless if he was helpless
[1:03:28] what about me what about you I mean he
[1:03:30] had to wait on the great one to come and
[1:03:33] then there would not be a sick person
[1:03:35] that would believe in the building you
[1:03:38] say people left sick people died yeah
[1:03:40] because not everybody believes anden
[1:03:43] even the queen when she went to see
[1:03:44] Solomon she had questions and she she
[1:03:46] she really didn't believe it but then
[1:03:48] she went and she saw it and she couldn't
[1:03:50] deny that God was using Solomon and I
[1:03:53] want to say today there's been many
[1:03:55] skeptic around the message but I want to
[1:03:57] tell you this God used that man and I'm
[1:04:00] not pointing to the man as infallible
[1:04:02] but I'm pointing you to a greater one
[1:04:04] who is the infallible God he never lost
[1:04:07] a battle He's been Faithful in Victory
[1:04:10] he's overcome every war he is still God
[1:04:12] the greater one Among
[1:04:14] Us I was talking about Simon's house a
[1:04:17] minute ago he was the greater one but
[1:04:19] he's unrecognized by many because he
[1:04:21] doesn't come the way you expect him to
[1:04:23] come is that okay but it changed
[1:04:26] somebody's it changed a woman's life
[1:04:28] amen who the who who everybody else said
[1:04:30] hey look even the disciples would stand
[1:04:32] there and
[1:04:33] criticize well can you say man the
[1:04:36] disciples would criticize the woman and
[1:04:38] she's the very one that recognized the
[1:04:40] greater one was in the house amen the
[1:04:42] greater ones in the house tonight amen
[1:04:44] you say well I'm looking at you brother
[1:04:45] Joel don't look at the humanity but look
[1:04:47] to the word of God because he's still
[1:04:50] the greater one Among
[1:04:51] Us right everybody still awake amen
[1:04:55] brother R said it like this and a man
[1:04:57] that's a Son of God reads the Bible and
[1:04:58] see what God was yesterday he's the same
[1:05:01] today he believes him to be the same in
[1:05:04] principle in power everything that he
[1:05:06] ever was the great Jehovah is still the
[1:05:10] same can you sayen amen it's Hebrews 138
[1:05:13] he's he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:15] yesterday and today and forever amen
[1:05:17] he's never changed and he never will
[1:05:19] change amen the same God that can
[1:05:21] discern the heart of the queen is the
[1:05:24] same God that can discern the heart of
[1:05:26] his bride here tonight thank you Lorden
[1:05:29] you say what we if we had a man here
[1:05:31] that could discern our heart no the the
[1:05:33] discerner is here come on somebody amen
[1:05:36] you we we've made it a we've made it a
[1:05:38] side show where some man's got to stand
[1:05:40] here but that's not what it's about
[1:05:42] we're not to give glory to the man but
[1:05:44] give glory to the greater one because
[1:05:46] he's came he come in humility in our day
[1:05:49] and he's still here hiding himself in a
[1:05:53] bride amen he's revealing himself in
[1:05:57] humility can you say Amen brother brand
[1:05:59] said he's the same he said a true son
[1:06:03] believes that a true son believes that
[1:06:06] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:06:07] God is great in battles when he sent you
[1:06:10] don't be scared stand there and see
[1:06:13] God's salvation anden he said stand
[1:06:15] there there's only one who could produce
[1:06:17] salvation and that's God no one else can
[1:06:19] bring Salvation but God you say I want
[1:06:21] my children saved well you you can't
[1:06:24] just getting them to church is good
[1:06:25] that's a nice thing but God has got to
[1:06:27] come and change their life God has got
[1:06:30] to come on the inside of them or they
[1:06:32] could go down a wet Center or a dry
[1:06:34] Center and come up a wet Center amen
[1:06:36] they could come to church and sit there
[1:06:38] and split hell wide open well come on
[1:06:40] somebody it's time we realize we got to
[1:06:42] get serious with God tonight we're not
[1:06:44] just traveling to church just to see
[1:06:46] what you're wearing or who's who's there
[1:06:48] and who's not there but we're here to
[1:06:50] meet with the greater one that promised
[1:06:52] to show up and meet every single need do
[1:06:55] you say Amen tonight remember the r
[1:06:57] would say like this he said he's great
[1:06:59] he said stand there there's only one who
[1:07:01] could produce salvation he goes on down
[1:07:02] he said stand still and see the
[1:07:03] salvation of God he said Here Come the
[1:07:05] Army he said oh when I think of it here
[1:07:07] come the Army and the dust are roaring
[1:07:09] and when Moses Stood Still to see the
[1:07:11] salvation of God the great Pillar of
[1:07:12] Fire that was hanging before them had
[1:07:15] led them into this trap and moved and
[1:07:17] went over and stood between Israel and
[1:07:19] Pharaoh's Army so the same light that
[1:07:21] led the children of Israel was the same
[1:07:23] light that would blind the unbeliever oh
[1:07:25] come on somebody amen we are we are we
[1:07:27] are following a light but not everybody
[1:07:29] can follow this light because some will
[1:07:32] look at it and say well with a skeptical
[1:07:34] eye and say well that was for another
[1:07:36] day or or that can't be true and they
[1:07:38] they just don't recognize that God is
[1:07:41] always the same and he is an everpresent
[1:07:43] help and he's always here he's
[1:07:45] omniscient he's always Among Us and he's
[1:07:48] living in us and with us and through us
[1:07:50] and and why because he promised he would
[1:07:53] and if he promised it then he's still
[1:07:55] here he is the greater one Among Us
[1:07:57] right come on how do I recognize the
[1:08:00] greater one Among Us brother Joel well
[1:08:01] it only comes by the Holy Spirit leading
[1:08:04] you into all truth because the greater
[1:08:08] one is the word come on and if the let
[1:08:12] me just stop here for a second amen
[1:08:15] that's why it's so hard for the people
[1:08:16] to see because if it was a man standing
[1:08:19] here with nail scars and and he was uh
[1:08:22] you could say well he he he came back
[1:08:24] and this is the literal Jesus and he was
[1:08:25] standing here amen there'd be all kinds
[1:08:27] of Hypocrites say oh now we believe amen
[1:08:30] but he but he hid himself in simplicity
[1:08:33] so that he could actually hide himself
[1:08:35] from the wise and The Prudent but he
[1:08:37] would reveal himself to people that
[1:08:39] would learn and and babes and suches
[1:08:41] would learn why because he's not coming
[1:08:43] to that group of people and the
[1:08:45] intellectual group of people but he's
[1:08:46] coming to a bride group of people who
[1:08:49] have humbled themselves and who have not
[1:08:51] elevated themselves to smarter than
[1:08:53] everybody else and greater than every
[1:08:55] body else and and and try to elevate men
[1:08:57] as as something better than what they
[1:08:59] are no we're not here to do that tonight
[1:09:02] but we are to elevate one man and that
[1:09:04] is God himself well he is he alone is
[1:09:06] God and and and I want to tell you
[1:09:08] tonight I'm not putting down a a prophet
[1:09:10] and saying that he has no place amen he
[1:09:12] does have a place and he was a type and
[1:09:14] he had a Ministry that was a son of man
[1:09:16] Ministry and I don't deny any of those
[1:09:18] things but I want you to know tonight
[1:09:20] look past the humanity and see the
[1:09:23] greater one that was here and he still
[1:09:25] among us tonight amen cuz men can die
[1:09:28] men can fail you men can fall away men
[1:09:30] can do all kinds of things but he can
[1:09:33] never fail you amen he can never fall
[1:09:35] away he can never die because he's
[1:09:38] always with his bride can you say am man
[1:09:41] here tonight amen am man I hope this is
[1:09:43] okay but I just want you to know the
[1:09:45] greater one is here and if he's here
[1:09:47] then you need to take your troubles and
[1:09:48] your burdens to the Lord amen take take
[1:09:50] your burdens to the Lord and leave them
[1:09:52] there amen quit quit trying to go to the
[1:09:54] Lord and and say well I I just can't
[1:09:56] seem to do this on my own I I he knows
[1:09:59] you can't do it on your own that's why
[1:10:01] he went before you in battle that's why
[1:10:03] he put the pillar of fire on the other
[1:10:05] side of the Israelites why because he
[1:10:08] had to blind those who would actually
[1:10:10] try to come after him and and listen
[1:10:12] Church the the same one that was leading
[1:10:14] which is this message you say well so so
[1:10:16] and so couldn't accept it no because it
[1:10:19] blinded them but aren't you glad that
[1:10:21] you can walk in the evening light that
[1:10:23] has led you this far amen it was Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ amen it is the Jehovah of the old
[1:10:28] Jesus of the new it is the same God all
[1:10:31] the time it is him and he is worthy of
[1:10:35] Our Praise he is worthy of all things he
[1:10:37] is worthy to be adored why because he
[1:10:39] didn't leave us like he found us come on
[1:10:43] is that okay he didn't leave you brother
[1:10:45] Bill like he found you but he changed
[1:10:48] you and made you a Son of God and if
[1:10:50] you're a Son of God and I I love this
[1:10:52] not to steal brother Josh Bennett's
[1:10:53] sermon from the other night but he deal
[1:10:55] with us his sons and I want you to know
[1:10:57] he really does and sometimes when you're
[1:10:59] dealing with a son am me you have to let
[1:11:01] him fall down and get a get a bump on
[1:11:03] their knee or or fall flat on their face
[1:11:05] but when you're dealing with them like
[1:11:06] that it's not because you don't love
[1:11:08] them it's because you are trying to show
[1:11:10] them that there is someone greater and
[1:11:13] you can't walk alone you can't do this
[1:11:15] on your own but there is a God come on
[1:11:18] somebody there is a God and he's not
[1:11:21] 2,000 years away he's not 2,000 years
[1:11:24] ago and he's not so far off in the
[1:11:26] future that you can't ever see but he's
[1:11:28] an everpresent God and he is the water
[1:11:32] that is Flowing from The Rock in this
[1:11:33] day I think we need to grab a hold of
[1:11:35] that fact tonight and you would you you
[1:11:37] you would see your problems get smaller
[1:11:39] you would see your children listen
[1:11:41] Church we've held on to our children by
[1:11:43] fear of losing them that's right come on
[1:11:47] y'all okay tonight you start telling
[1:11:49] well my my kids are going to be lost if
[1:11:50] you start dealing with them like they're
[1:11:52] never going to be lost and say listen I
[1:11:54] know you're coming back
[1:11:56] I know you're coming back let us show
[1:11:57] our faith muscles once in a while and
[1:12:00] show the devil whose side we're on the
[1:12:02] greater one is still in control of it
[1:12:04] all thank you Lord thank you Lord and if
[1:12:07] he's in control of it all then let us
[1:12:08] let us just not take the burdens upon
[1:12:10] oursel and try to be God because we we
[1:12:13] can't be in that role we weren't meant
[1:12:14] to be but we were meant to be
[1:12:15] worshippers of God we were meant to take
[1:12:18] our needs to God because he's our father
[1:12:20] and we can go to him and and when you go
[1:12:22] to him in prayer don't you think he
[1:12:23] didn't listen to you amen he heard your
[1:12:25] prayer he heard your need he heard the
[1:12:28] desire of your heart and if he heard you
[1:12:31] he will answer you in his time he will
[1:12:33] answer you why because he's great enough
[1:12:36] to do it but you've got to believe that
[1:12:38] God is still able to keep his
[1:12:41] word now brother Brandon would talk
[1:12:44] about this I've read the quote and I
[1:12:45] don't actually have it with me but he
[1:12:47] said all that God
[1:12:48] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:12:51] Christ was he poured into his church now
[1:12:54] I want you know that the Greater Works
[1:12:56] that you do is not the Greater Works on
[1:12:58] your own but it is actually the Greater
[1:13:01] Works that he is doing through you on
[1:13:04] see that takes the humanity out of it
[1:13:05] Brother David because if we're laying
[1:13:07] hands on the sick it's not my hands it's
[1:13:10] the word of God being fulfilled that
[1:13:12] we're we're we're elevating amen it is
[1:13:14] not the man that lays the hands on you
[1:13:16] that matters it is the fact that you
[1:13:18] went in obedience and believed that the
[1:13:20] word still works are you still with me
[1:13:23] tonight amen if the word still works
[1:13:25] that's why we do what we do if the word
[1:13:27] still works that's why we gather at the
[1:13:29] house of God and if the word still works
[1:13:31] that's why that we have Altra calls
[1:13:33] because it's worked before and it's why
[1:13:36] we do it's why we lay hands on people
[1:13:38] it's why you you'll see sometimes we'll
[1:13:40] have a prayer line in a meeting amen
[1:13:42] it's not just to have the biggest prayer
[1:13:44] line the most preachers lined up and and
[1:13:46] and if you if this one didn't pray for
[1:13:48] me it's not going to work listen church
[1:13:50] it's not about the man it's about the
[1:13:51] greater one that is Among Us Changing
[1:13:54] Life and healing bodies that's the one
[1:13:57] we're looking at amen when you get your
[1:13:59] eyes on a man you're sure to fall or
[1:14:01] you're sure to be led astray but if you

[1:17:27] going to leave get those thoughts
[1:17:29] away I ain't done
[1:17:34] yet Satan is defeated that's what
[1:17:36] brother random says here he knows he's
[1:17:38] on the earth he is going like a roaring
[1:17:40] Li it isn't long oh he's finished he
[1:17:43] said he knows this time he's going like
[1:17:45] a roaring lion but remember the Prince
[1:17:46] of Peace stands by the Great Divine one
[1:17:50] man I don't know how much Glory we can
[1:17:52] give to God tonight but I feel like that
[1:17:53] we we might as well do it while we're
[1:17:54] here here amen I I'm not here to to
[1:17:56] elevate anything but him tonight and I
[1:17:59] want you to know that I'm not I'm not
[1:18:01] trying to preach to you anything that's
[1:18:02] not in the scriptures anything that's
[1:18:04] not in the message I want to tell you
[1:18:06] that he is the greater one and the
[1:18:09] message was only to declare that he is
[1:18:12] here and if he's here nothing is
[1:18:15] impossible to them that believe can you
[1:18:18] say man and so Satan is going around
[1:18:21] like a roaring line he said it isn't
[1:18:22] long till oh he's finished he knows his
[1:18:24] time he's going around like that he said
[1:18:26] but the Prince of Peace stands by the
[1:18:28] Great Divine One the architect of my
[1:18:30] being the architect who built me what I
[1:18:33] am who built you what you are is here
[1:18:36] the very one that designed you the very
[1:18:39] one that thought up how you would look
[1:18:41] Brother David and how tall you would be
[1:18:43] amen the very one that thought of that
[1:18:45] amen the very one that came and and
[1:18:47] brother Bill he he he he made you in the
[1:18:49] very image that he knew you would be he
[1:18:51] knew exactly what you would look like
[1:18:53] and where you'd be sitting church
[1:18:55] tonight I mean he's the architect he's
[1:18:57] the one that knows every detail and
[1:18:59] every hair that you have on your head he
[1:19:01] is the great one and he knows he and he
[1:19:05] said who knows better than the architect
[1:19:07] and he's here to prove himself that he's
[1:19:09] here amen I think tonight church we we
[1:19:12] we've put God too far away and Out Of
[1:19:14] Reach but but he's actually right here
[1:19:16] brother Brandon said he's as close as my
[1:19:18] right arm anden he's right here in the
[1:19:20] building with us he would say time after
[1:19:22] time he would say if you could just see
[1:19:24] the one standing by me amen he's the
[1:19:26] greater one he's the one that can do the
[1:19:29] works amen that that that would make a
[1:19:31] every person in this building go away
[1:19:33] saying you know what I met with the King
[1:19:35] of Kings I met with the Lord of lords
[1:19:37] and I met the greater one in church
[1:19:39] tonight and all my troubles are laying
[1:19:41] at his feet and I'm going to go out the

[1:19:47] every battle is won every Victory is
[1:19:50] already taking place in my life come on
[1:19:52] church amen I think what we need tonight

[1:19:57] in our lives and the greater one taking
[1:19:59] control amen Jesus take the will amen
[1:20:02] let him take control of your situation
[1:20:05] let him take control because you haven't
[1:20:07] done a very good job of it
[1:20:09] yourself I haven't done a very good job
[1:20:12] of it myself but when you give it to
[1:20:14] Jesus well can you say Amen if you'll
[1:20:17] give it to him he can take control of
[1:20:20] your life amen can you say man tonight

[1:20:28] it already he said my Ministry is a
[1:20:30] different Ministry from a pastor or
[1:20:31] teacher he said and if I say things
[1:20:33] wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean
[1:20:35] it amen he was a human but he said but
[1:20:38] this is my Ministry SE to declare him
[1:20:41] that he is here it wasn't about brother
[1:20:43] Brandon but it was about him he didn't
[1:20:46] get up there and say look at me look at
[1:20:47] the man look at the five six man that's
[1:20:49] standing here look how big I am no it
[1:20:52] wasn't about the man it was about the
[1:20:54] the God in the man amen it was a son of
[1:20:57] man revealing the son of man as the
[1:21:00] greater one that was Among Us in our
[1:21:02] generation can you say amen amen so you

[1:21:18] mean that's good amen I I I would
[1:21:20] identify as that too if I was a chicken
[1:21:22] I didn't tell him that part but you know
[1:21:23] what you know sometimes sometimes I'm
[1:21:27] okay with that name because listen the
[1:21:29] church has always been called crazy the
[1:21:31] church has always been called holy
[1:21:33] rollers and the church has always been
[1:21:35] called you know we're just a little off
[1:21:36] we're just a bunch of nuts we're just
[1:21:38] crazy amen but I'm not a I'm not a
[1:21:40] listen I'm not following the man the
[1:21:42] flesh man I'm following the greater one
[1:21:45] that he proved to be among
[1:21:47] us thank you Lord So when you say what
[1:21:49] are you I'm a Christian I'm a message
[1:21:52] believer because the message is to prove
[1:21:54] that Christ is still alive am me all the
[1:21:56] other denominations listen I don't put
[1:21:58] any of them out of heaven but I'll tell
[1:21:59] you this they're pointing you to a god
[1:22:01] that was or a God that will be we got
[1:22:04] some message people like that they're
[1:22:05] pointing you to a message that was or a
[1:22:08] message that will be but I'm here
[1:22:09] tonight to declare the same thing that a
[1:22:12] prophet declared that he the greater one
[1:22:15] is here Among Us doing the same Works
[1:22:18] doing the greater things why because
[1:22:21] it's not the man the man could leave the
[1:22:23] scene the man could die but the greater
[1:22:26] one can't die well can you say man I'm
[1:22:29] almost done so stay with me a few more
[1:22:31] minutes is that okay brother brandom
[1:22:32] said I feel so bad today when people try
[1:22:35] to make God something in a history I
[1:22:37] want to ask you something what good is a
[1:22:40] god of History if he isn't God today
[1:22:45] well can you say man what good is he he
[1:22:47] said what good is this Bible if it's
[1:22:49] something yesterday if it ain't the same
[1:22:52] today what good is the god of Moses if
[1:22:55] he isn't the same today he said he is
[1:22:58] the same God he has risen from the dead
[1:23:01] he's here to prove himself that he's
[1:23:03] still the same God well somebody ought
[1:23:05] to say Amen to that amen he said you say
[1:23:07] I have no faith to believe it but you're
[1:23:09] afraid to let loose what good does it do
[1:23:11] to put a bird that has wings in a cage
[1:23:14] am mean if he isn't out of the cage
[1:23:15] that's right his wings doesn't do any
[1:23:18] good I mean you got to have a wing in
[1:23:19] another world and he said he said that
[1:23:21] he he said in this church tonight
[1:23:23] there's enough faith to heal every
[1:23:25] person here but you're afraid to get out
[1:23:28] of the cage and get out of the cage he
[1:23:30] said now don't feed your Bo your bird
[1:23:32] more food he said you can be feed your
[1:23:35] bird ever such Orthodox food if you
[1:23:37] don't let him out of the cage what good
[1:23:39] is it going to do him that's right it
[1:23:40] ain't the your food it's tur him loose
[1:23:43] he's not a god of History altogether
[1:23:45] he's the same today how can people claim
[1:23:48] him to be something that he was and
[1:23:50] isn't now when did our God lose his
[1:23:52] power when was he ever any different
[1:23:54] what what's the use of talking about a
[1:23:56] holy ghost the apostles had that helped
[1:23:58] and blessed the people then if he won't
[1:24:00] do the same today well can you say amen
[1:24:03] he said he won't do the same today it
[1:24:05] can't make sense out of it Jesus Christ
[1:24:08] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:24:12] the greater one his entire Ministry the
[1:24:15] greater one was proven to be there and
[1:24:18] he's not didn't die in 1965 but the
[1:24:21] greater one is still here I'm tonight
[1:24:25] church that the same God of Elijah the
[1:24:27] same God of Jesus am mean that that
[1:24:30] walked the shores of Galilee and made
[1:24:32] himself a flesh man the same God that
[1:24:34] met Paul on the road to Damascus is the
[1:24:37] same God that is in our midst tonight
[1:24:39] the same one in William brandham the
[1:24:41] same one that has sustained the church
[1:24:44] all through the Dark Ages is the same
[1:24:46] God that is here tonight to do the
[1:24:49] impossible in your life you say you
[1:24:51] don't know what I'm going through you
[1:24:52] don't know the situation I'm in I'm here
[1:24:54] to tell you encourage yourself in the
[1:24:57] word encourage yourself in the Lord
[1:24:59] because the greater one has never lost a
[1:25:02] battle come on church amen if you could
[1:25:04] recognize who he is and and and your
[1:25:07] faults listen Church they're not that
[1:25:09] big of problems if you realize how big
[1:25:12] he really
[1:25:13] is he's bigger than any problem he's
[1:25:16] bigger than anything that would try to
[1:25:18] come against you amen he is so great and
[1:25:21] he is so good too and say and you say
[1:25:23] well I deserve better no you don't even
[1:25:25] deserve life itself but you're here
[1:25:28] anyway amen we don't deserve we don't
[1:25:30] deserve to sit here in a building on a
[1:25:32] Wednesday night and worship the god that
[1:25:34] we're worshiping but he gave us the
[1:25:37] ability to do that because he sent his
[1:25:39] son and the spirit that's in you led you
[1:25:42] to the church tonight and that same
[1:25:44] spirit is what raises that hand in
[1:25:46] worship and it's the same thing that is
[1:25:48] holding on to the faith of a Rapture
[1:25:50] amen I believe it's time that we we let
[1:25:52] loose of the cage and and and get out of
[1:25:54] the cage and start flying like eagles
[1:25:56] that we are and say Lord I'm here to
[1:25:59] worship I'm here to fly into the
[1:26:01] heavenlies I'm here to love you more
[1:26:03] than I ever have before I'm here to lay
[1:26:06] down everything at your feet that would
[1:26:07] be unlike you I'm here to lay aside
[1:26:10] every weight and everything that would
[1:26:12] so easily beset me but Lord I'm here in
[1:26:15] your presence and I'm running to you
[1:26:18] amen I'm not just walking to him but I'm
[1:26:20] running after him because I know he is
[1:26:22] the greater one in my life
[1:26:24] amen I think tonight Church brother
[1:26:26] Brandon would say like this he said he
[1:26:28] said he's praying here and he said we
[1:26:30] pray now that you'll bless every person
[1:26:32] of divine presence everyone that hears
[1:26:34] this tape Lord around the world may they
[1:26:35] get away from those old Creeds and
[1:26:37] things and come and serve the Living God
[1:26:40] come and invest in
[1:26:42] it can you say am man he said like the
[1:26:45] do like the queen of the South did she
[1:26:47] come and took her three months to get to
[1:26:49] where the man was representing God
[1:26:52] excuse me to where the man was
[1:26:53] representing the the god of heaven and
[1:26:55] Solomon and she Jesus said she come from
[1:26:57] the uttermost parts of the world to hear
[1:26:58] the wisdom of Solomon and behold a
[1:27:01] greater than Solomon is here and we know
[1:27:03] that greater than Solomon is here the
[1:27:05] greater the great Holy Spirit himself is
[1:27:08] here working through the people how we
[1:27:10] thank you for this father and that's
[1:27:13] what I want to say tonight church if we
[1:27:15] know the greater one is here then we
[1:27:17] ought to thank him for being Among Us
[1:27:20] amen I believe the greater one is here
[1:27:22] to do the impossible in your sit
[1:27:24] situation tonight am mean I don't know
[1:27:26] what this was this message was for but
[1:27:28] it was on my heart because I know that
[1:27:29] in this world we're going to have
[1:27:31] trouble but a mean greater is he he came
[1:27:33] to overcome the world Amen he made the
[1:27:36] world he made all that there is and if
[1:27:38] he made it he can take care of it amen
[1:27:40] if he made you amen I love the song If
[1:27:43] he made the sparrow and if he if he
[1:27:45] taught to give a fish a place to swim
[1:27:47] how much more does he care for you and I
[1:27:50] here tonight why because he is the
[1:27:53] greater one Among Us
[1:27:55] as the musicians come all that God was
[1:27:59] he poured into Christ thank you Lord and
[1:28:02] He poured into Christ and Christ bled
[1:28:03] there at Calvary and when he died he
[1:28:06] gave up The Ghost and then he would
[1:28:08] actually AR raise from the dead and
[1:28:11] three days later he would conquer death
[1:28:13] hell in the grave and that ought to make
[1:28:14] somebody shout hallelujah and then he
[1:28:17] would actually he would Ascend into the
[1:28:19] heaven and he would send his Spirit back
[1:28:21] to the church and if his spirit is in
[1:28:23] you tonight tonight then remember the
[1:28:25] greater one is in you amen the greater
[1:28:28] one is not coming but the greater one is
[1:28:30] here amen he he's coming into a physical
[1:28:32] form but the greater one that's among us
[1:28:34] tonight he can take care of all of your
[1:28:38] problems all of your problems you say
[1:28:41] well if I get the Holy Ghost do I still
[1:28:43] need to go to church the Holy Ghost will
[1:28:45] make you go the Holy Ghost will make you
[1:28:46] love one another the Holy Ghost will
[1:28:49] will make you look at that problem and
[1:28:50] you say mountain move because the Holy
[1:28:53] Ghost is in me and I I have authority as
[1:28:56] a Son of God I have authority of a
[1:28:58] daughter of god sister Sandra the
[1:29:00] problem's not too big for you and your
[1:29:01] children amen God has come to do the
[1:29:04] impossible God has come to take away
[1:29:07] everything that has been made wrong in
[1:29:09] this world he has come to make all
[1:29:11] things new and to make all things right
[1:29:13] why because he's the greater one amen do
[1:29:16] you believe the greater ones among us
