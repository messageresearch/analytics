[23:32] not get heavy
[23:36] [Music]

[37:28] feel like the lord laid it on my heart
[37:30] for a reason i trust to be a blessing to
[37:32] you
[37:32] i want to title this no broken bones
[37:36] no broken bones psalms chapter 34 and

[37:54] lord earth and delivereth them out of

[38:04] oh amen that's saying something
[38:07] all their troubles he said the lord is
[38:10] nigh unto them that are of a broken
[38:11] heart
[38:13] saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
[38:16] many are the afflictions of the
[38:18] righteous but the lord delivereth him
[38:20] out of them all how many again
[38:24] oh amen
[38:27] verse 20 he keepeth all his bones
[38:31] not one of them is broken
[38:35] i pray lord would add his blessing to
[38:36] the word you may be seated this morning
[38:43] if you were there with joseph and
[38:46] nicodemus
[38:48] after the body of christ had been taken
[38:50] down from the cross and delivered to
[38:52] them
[38:54] there are some things that you would
[38:55] have seen as you examine the body
[38:58] of christ
[39:01] you would have seen the bruises where he
[39:03] was buffeted and where they slapped him
[39:06] the scripture even said and it always
[39:08] touched me where it said the servants
[39:10] slapped him
[39:11] the king of the heavens and the servants
[39:14] slapped him
[39:16] he was bruised for our iniquity
[39:22] you would have seen the wounds in a
[39:24] scalp where they took
[39:26] a crown of thorns and
[39:29] put it down over his head
[39:34] you would have seen the nail prints in
[39:36] his wrist and in his feet
[39:38] he's seen splinters in the body from
[39:40] carrying the cross
[39:42] until he couldn't carry it anymore
[39:45] you would have seen deep gashes in his
[39:47] skin
[39:48] strips of skin torn off and hanging
[39:51] loose
[39:53] where the bible even says that his bones
[39:56] and his internal organs could be seen
[39:59] from being beaten with 39
[40:02] stripes but the bible says he was
[40:05] wounded for our transgression
[40:08] and i'm so grateful for that this
[40:10] morning i'm so grateful that he was
[40:12] wounded
[40:14] for our transgression and brother
[40:16] branham
[40:17] tells us they beat him to a point where
[40:20] if they had
[40:20] beaten him one more time he would have
[40:22] died
[40:25] you would have seen that the body was
[40:28] was bruised and wounded
[40:31] but no broken bones
[40:34] which is a miracle in itself because the
[40:37] body
[40:38] would have been abused in such a way
[40:41] that you would have thought there would
[40:43] had to have been something broken
[40:46] even a bone and even the bible in psalms
[40:50] 22 14
[40:51] david describes what it would be like in
[40:53] the crucifixion he says
[40:54] i'm poured out like water all my bones
[40:57] are out of joint
[40:58] so they were out of joint they were
[41:00] pulled until the tendons and everything
[41:02] was pulled apart
[41:03] but the bones were whole
[41:07] not one broken you'd have thought when
[41:08] they beat him with the with the whip
[41:10] that would have broken a rib that there
[41:12] would have been somehow there would have
[41:13] been a bone
[41:14] broken but it says not one was broken
[41:18] he says my heart is like wax it is
[41:20] melted in the midst of my bowels my
[41:22] strength is dried up like a potsherd
[41:24] my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and that's
[41:26] brought me into the dust of death
[41:28] dogs have compassed me the assembly of
[41:30] the wicked have enclosed me they pierced
[41:32] my hands and my feet he says i may tell
[41:35] all my bones they look and stare
[41:38] upon me so he's in a horrible condition
[41:42] but he still has all his bones
[41:46] and i want to draw your attention to
[41:47] that today he said they parked my
[41:49] garments among them cast thoughts upon
[41:51] my vesture so he's been persecuted he's
[41:53] been mocked he's been spit on
[41:55] he's been laughed at he's he's had the
[41:57] he's had his body
[41:59] uh so disfigured by the abuse that he's
[42:02] taken
[42:03] but he still had all his bones
[42:06] all his bones were out of a joint but
[42:08] they were still there
[42:10] his bones could be counted but they were
[42:12] there
[42:15] no broken bones and you look at that and
[42:19] and
[42:19] find out in the old testament in exodus
[42:21] 12 46 that
[42:23] the lamb that was for the passover would
[42:26] not
[42:27] be broken and this was different from
[42:30] all of the other sacrifices where the
[42:32] bones would be taken out or taken apart
[42:34] but here
[42:35] was a lamb that would be whole a lamb
[42:39] that would be complete
[42:41] and i believe we have that kind of a
[42:43] lamb today
[42:45] a complete lamb because it requires and
[42:48] you have to think with me a little bit
[42:49] this morning but it requires
[42:51] a complete lamb for the resurrection
[42:54] that's why his bones had to be left
[42:58] intact a complete lamb
[43:01] and today we eat lamb just like they did
[43:04] in the passover they were to eat the
[43:06] lamb
[43:06] whole and where to eat the whole word
[43:09] the whole lamb
[43:11] not with any part separated from it but
[43:13] we eat the whole thing
[43:15] right and so the lamb had to be whole
[43:18] because it takes all of the word now
[43:21] listen to me
[43:22] it takes all of the word to produce a
[43:24] resurrection
[43:27] his body wouldn't be there there
[43:29] wouldn't be part of his
[43:30] of his structure of his body left behind
[43:34] you can't tear off a limb and leave it
[43:35] there but the whole body
[43:38] was placed in the tomb and the whole
[43:41] body
[43:42] would raise up from the two
[43:46] and i want to encourage you this morning
[43:47] because you see there's no devil in the
[43:49] hell
[43:50] that could ever keep any part of that
[43:53] body
[43:54] in the tomb it had to come out
[44:00] oh this that ought to make us really
[44:03] thank god this morning to be a part of
[44:05] that body
[44:06] he said well how do you know you're a
[44:07] part of the body we're baptized into the
[44:09] body by one spirit
[44:11] by the holy ghost we're baptized into
[44:14] the body of christ and when we come into
[44:15] the body
[44:16] it means that we cannot be left here
[44:19] brother branham tells us in christ the
[44:21] mystery of god revealed he said the
[44:22] bride body must follow the head
[44:25] must follow the head it can't be left
[44:27] behind part of it left behind we don't
[44:29] have to worry about
[44:30] one bone being left off but the whole
[44:32] body
[44:34] amen that is eaten the whole word
[44:37] goes in the resurrection and the rapture
[44:42] so in exodus 12 46 he says in one house
[44:44] shall it be eaten or in one company
[44:46] thou shall not carry forth out of the
[44:47] flesh or brought out of the house
[44:49] neither shall you break a bone thereof
[44:53] and in john 19 and 32
[44:56] when the soldiers were just about to do
[44:59] what they always
[45:00] did in every case it would break a bone
[45:04] to make sure that he was dead to make
[45:07] sure that the male factor that the
[45:09] the one who was hung for that capital
[45:11] punishment was dead
[45:12] they broke the bones and so they went to
[45:15] the first one and broke his bone
[45:18] and of the other they went to him broke
[45:20] his bone
[45:22] the good with the bad
[45:26] when they came to jesus i love how god
[45:29] keeps his word this morning
[45:31] god keeps his word if god will keep his
[45:33] word like this down to this detail
[45:35] don't you realize he still keeps his
[45:37] word today
[45:38] that if god can keep the word of a
[45:40] prophet that was spoken hundreds of
[45:41] years before
[45:42] don't you think that god could keep the
[45:44] word of a prophet in this hour
[45:46] that speaks about a bribe and so he says
[45:48] when they come to jesus they saw
[45:50] that he was dead already and they break
[45:53] knowledge legs
[45:55] see no one took his life from him he
[45:56] gave up the ghost
[45:59] but one of the soldiers with a spear
[46:01] pierced his side
[46:02] and forthwith came throughout blood and
[46:05] water
[46:07] now brother branham tells us in the
[46:09] entombment he says then another thing i
[46:10] want you to notice he said the truth
[46:12] the infallible part of god's word
[46:16] i love this the infallible part of god's
[46:18] word the bible said he keeps all his
[46:21] bones
[46:22] not one of them is broken in the type
[46:26] the paschal lamb was a type of
[46:27] the lamb must be without blemish no
[46:29] broken bones must be in the lamb
[46:32] and at the hour when he had died they
[46:34] went up to break his legs with a hammer
[46:35] he said look at that very
[46:37] crucial moment and i want you to notice
[46:40] and keep in mind what we read
[46:42] in psalms where he says many are the
[46:44] afflictions of the righteous
[46:47] many are the afflictions of the
[46:48] righteous you might have come here today
[46:50] and you've been through hell all week
[46:52] excuse it but it's just the way it is
[46:55] you might have come here and
[46:56] you've had all kinds of trouble you
[46:57] might have come with all kinds of
[46:59] sickness in your body
[47:00] you might have come with all kinds of
[47:01] worry you might be watching or listening
[47:03] this morning with all kinds of trouble
[47:05] but remember
[47:06] many are the afflictions of the
[47:07] righteous
[47:09] many by the jt are the afflictions but
[47:11] the lord delivered them out of them all
[47:15] amen and so he said at that crucial
[47:19] moment and think about it
[47:21] this might be your crucial moment this
[47:22] morning that you really need to hear
[47:24] from god
[47:25] you really need an answer from god you
[47:27] really need god to step
[47:29] up and and and we know he's already done
[47:32] that in his word but you really need to
[47:34] know that it's real to know that it's
[47:36] for you
[47:37] that's that crucial moment and it's at
[47:39] that crucial moment he said the man with
[47:41] the hammer ready to strike his legs
[47:42] but god's word said there will not be
[47:45] one bone broke in his body
[47:48] amen hallelujah
[47:53] that's why we stay with the word we
[47:55] don't want to get off of it
[47:56] we don't want to leave it we don't want
[47:58] to leave it in our doctrine we don't
[47:59] want to leave it in our practice
[48:02] we don't want to leave it in our lives
[48:04] we stay with the word because the word
[48:06] guarantees us a resurrection this is
[48:08] what's getting me out of here
[48:10] my friendship with you or your
[48:11] friendship with me won't get me out of
[48:13] here
[48:13] the fact that you go to this church
[48:14] won't get you out of here but the word
[48:16] gets us out of here
[48:18] why he keeps his word he's a god who
[48:22] keeps his word when he keeps his word
[48:23] it means he keeps all of his word he
[48:26] doesn't just keep part of it and so
[48:28] there's no bones broken at that crucial
[48:31] moment it seems like he won't keep his
[48:33] word listen to me we're living in a time
[48:35] if you just excuse me for a moment we're
[48:37] living in a very crucial moment of
[48:39] history
[48:39] we're living in a time when it looks
[48:41] like that god can't keep his word
[48:42] anymore
[48:43] we're living in a time when it looks
[48:44] like there's no hope when it looks like
[48:46] that the world has gone into darkness
[48:48] people don't want god anymore but
[48:50] remember it's at that crucial moment
[48:52] that's when god keeps his word
[48:55] he did it for the three hebrew children
[48:56] after they were they were already there
[48:58] and they were bound up and
[48:59] ready to be thrown in he kept his word
[49:02] in the fire
[49:03] in that crucial moment the son of man
[49:05] appeared it is in this crucial moment
[49:07] that god has given us a message just
[49:09] the whole word to be able to get out of
[49:11] here
[49:14] amen amen
[49:17] you know i wouldn't want to try to make
[49:19] a rapture without this message
[49:21] i tell you more than that i wouldn't
[49:22] want to try to navigate laodicea without
[49:24] this message
[49:29] you talk about confusion
[49:33] we have a message that didn't glorify a
[49:35] messenger brought us back to the word
[49:38] to the whole word amen and so he said
[49:42] look at that crucial moment the man with
[49:43] the hammer
[49:45] ready to strike his legs but god's word
[49:48] said very bad
[49:51] you take that and put it in your own
[49:52] situation god's word
[49:55] said there will not be one bone broken
[49:58] god's word says i'm the god that heals
[50:00] all of your diseases
[50:02] god's word says i i'll have a church at
[50:05] the end time be a mighty army god's word
[50:07] said
[50:07] there'll be a bride without spot or
[50:08] blemish i didn't say that
[50:10] i can't make that happen god's word says
[50:12] that
[50:14] are you with me this morning excuse me
[50:16] for being a little bit excited but
[50:19] god's word said that takes the pressure
[50:22] off of me
[50:23] takes the pressure off of you god's word
[50:26] said
[50:28] and what i have to do brother caleb is
[50:29] believe that word
[50:32] hold on to that word amen
[50:36] i see my brother back here that's been
[50:38] sick for a while and
[50:39] able to come to church today god's word
[50:41] says i'm a he's a healer
[50:44] and so that's why we're able to gather
[50:45] together you see others that
[50:47] that you see them down at that crucial
[50:49] moment it seems like they'll be lost but
[50:51] god's word says
[50:53] maybe your kids is the same way it
[50:54] seemed like that your kids
[50:56] getting a point where they get away from
[50:58] god and they don't want nothing to do
[51:00] with god but god's word said
[51:04] if you believed all your household could
[51:06] be saved
[51:10] there will not be one bone broke in his
[51:12] body
[51:14] brother how is it going to happen
[51:17] he says we get in a hurry
[51:23] we get in a hurry you know what hurry
[51:26] produces
[51:27] hurry produces ishmael
[51:31] ishmael is an attempt to force god's
[51:33] promise to take place
[51:37] right every time that there's a false
[51:39] doctrine around the message of the hour
[51:40] somebody that
[51:41] believes that they've got everything
[51:43] figured out it's because they're trying
[51:45] to force the action of god
[51:48] trying to make it happen and it's not
[51:50] were you i can't make it happen
[51:54] i can't change your body if i did i'd
[51:56] change mine
[51:59] right if i could do that i'd have
[52:00] already done it i would have already had
[52:02] a rapture but it's in god's time
[52:05] see you can't do that jesus said which
[52:07] of you by taking thought can add one
[52:09] cubit to his stature you can't do it
[52:13] so what do you have to do you have to
[52:14] rest in the word it's god's word that's
[52:16] eternal
[52:17] amen and so brother brown says if god's
[52:20] word is that perfect
[52:21] them who are in christ is just as sure
[52:23] to raise
[52:24] as there is a resurrection
[52:28] amen he said god is just as obligated to
[52:31] his word to heal you as he is to save
[52:34] you
[52:35] oh my why it's a whole body no no bones
[52:39] broken
[52:40] wounded but not broken torn up but not
[52:43] broken
[52:45] abused and persecuted but not broken
[52:49] amen i hope you're hearing me this
[52:51] morning
[52:52] he said he's just as obligated to his
[52:54] word to heal you as he is to save you
[52:56] he said for it's his word that promised
[52:57] it it's god's word and we have no right
[52:59] to take away from it but just say it's
[53:01] the truth
[53:04] it's the truth well it may not happen
[53:07] unless i force something no
[53:09] it'll happen in god's time
[53:15] you get discouraged because you see
[53:16] people people aren't living the word
[53:18] like they should people aren't doing
[53:19] what they should it'll happen
[53:22] in god's time
[53:25] all we can do is preach it we can't
[53:27] force it because
[53:28] god is obligated not to us but to his
[53:31] word
[53:32] and if we're a part of that word then
[53:33] that makes him obligated to us
[53:36] but it's not to our words but to what he
[53:38] said now
[53:39] he said believe it no matter what
[53:41] happens believe it
[53:43] anyhow he said that's the way the rest
[53:45] of them had to believe it
[53:47] and we're not excluded from that
[53:50] he said god gave palestine to israel but
[53:53] they had to fight for every instagram
[53:55] they got
[53:56] the promise is yours but you have to
[53:59] fight for every inch you claim
[54:01] the devil will see to that certainly he
[54:03] will
[54:05] certainly he will so god gives us a
[54:07] promise we have to fight for it and
[54:09] there's a
[54:10] you know when you look at when we we
[54:11] watched the play of noah this week and
[54:14] as i was sitting there was thinking
[54:15] about this
[54:16] this balance and this almost seemed like
[54:19] a
[54:19] back and forth between election and what
[54:22] god said and what noah had to
[54:24] do because without either one it
[54:26] wouldn't have worked but
[54:28] see god calls the right man he knows
[54:31] he'll do the job
[54:33] right but you take the two together and
[54:34] you think here god said there'll be a
[54:36] flood
[54:37] no one would be saved but he didn't
[54:39] build him a boat
[54:40] he made noah build the boat
[54:45] and so you think well what was that and
[54:46] that's what brother bran was talking
[54:47] about he said you've got to fight for
[54:48] every inch of ground
[54:50] he said he said you've got to fight for
[54:52] every answer you claim the devil will
[54:54] see to that certainly
[54:55] he will he said but notice when they
[54:57] were ready to break the legs of our lord
[54:59] jesus
[55:00] if that hammer would have struck the leg
[55:02] and broke it
[55:04] god would have been found false
[55:09] but there wasn't enough devils in all
[55:12] dark torment
[55:14] amen to let that hammer strike that
[55:17] precious body
[55:19] for david 800 years before then said
[55:21] there will not be one bone
[55:23] broke in his body god's word
[55:27] has to stand truth and we know
[55:31] that bones in the scripture represent a
[55:33] potential for resurrection
[55:35] because it it's joseph when he died in
[55:38] hebrews 11
[55:39] 22 it says by faith joseph when he died
[55:41] made mention of the departing of the
[55:42] children of israel
[55:44] and gave commandment concerning his
[55:46] bones he did that by faith
[55:48] take my bones when you go you say if you
[55:51] go
[55:51] when you go take my bones
[55:55] right and it was jacob and joseph both
[55:58] who refused to be buried in egypt but
[56:00] they carried their bones back
[56:03] to the place where abraham and job were
[56:05] buried
[56:06] and those bones lay there in the ground
[56:08] in palestine they laid there in
[56:10] in that land for all those years job
[56:12] laid there maybe for hundreds of years
[56:14] and here's
[56:15] abraham laid there and sarah and here's
[56:18] jacob and joseph and all the patriarchs
[56:20] laying in that land
[56:23] they wanted they wanted to be buried
[56:25] there
[56:26] brother branham speaking of job he said
[56:28] that when the spirit of god came upon
[56:30] him
[56:30] he began to prophesy he said i know my
[56:32] redeemer liveth
[56:34] at the last days will stand upon this
[56:35] earth though the skin worms destroy this
[56:37] body
[56:38] i love that though the skin worms
[56:41] destroy the body yet in my flesh i shall
[56:45] see god
[56:49] amen he made a place to bury himself
[56:52] he said well by this ground he bought it
[56:54] there and buried himself later on there
[56:55] came a man
[56:56] he said named abraham the church growing
[56:58] up growing coming on up abraham he said
[57:00] well now
[57:01] he had the potentials of god too
[57:03] everlasting life eternal
[57:04] because god called him now notice he
[57:07] said when he died or sarah died he
[57:09] bought a piece of ground in palestine
[57:10] near job's grave
[57:12] and buried sarah abraham died and also
[57:15] was buried with sarah
[57:16] and abraham begot isaac and isaac when
[57:18] he died he slept with abraham in the
[57:20] same parcel of ground
[57:22] he said now when isaac begot jacob and
[57:24] jacob died way down in egypt but being a
[57:26] prophet with this potential
[57:28] this quickening power he said don't you
[57:30] bury me down here joseph come here my
[57:32] prophet son
[57:32] put your hand on the hip that god
[57:34] crippled swear to the god of heaven
[57:36] that you'll not bury me down here he
[57:38] said what was in that man why was in
[57:40] egypt just as good as any place he was a
[57:42] prophet
[57:43] he knew amen where that resurrection was
[57:45] going to be
[57:47] so he says take my bones
[57:50] amen you might be in this world and say
[57:53] all i've got is bones
[57:55] i don't have much all i've got is bones
[57:57] it don't seem like there's any meat on
[57:59] the bone doesn't seem like there's any
[58:01] any ability to do anything i'm just
[58:02] sitting here at bones
[58:05] but if you have bones you've got
[58:07] potentials
[58:12] amen you can remember before you
[58:15] were saved you may not have had anything
[58:18] that resembled a christian you might may
[58:20] not have been anything that resembled a
[58:21] christian
[58:22] but you had bones
[58:26] if i could put it that way in the bones
[58:28] and we'll get into it a little bit later
[58:29] but the bones speak of election
[58:33] and it speaks of our of our placing it
[58:36] speaks of
[58:37] resurrection and that part of you that
[58:40] that is eternal
[58:41] has to raise oh my
[58:45] so the bones were already there even
[58:47] though there was nothing there so if you
[58:48] get in a place as a christian
[58:51] where you feel like that you're you're
[58:53] in the worst place of your life and you
[58:55] can't do anything right
[58:57] you still have bones
[59:01] take those bones and bury them
[59:04] because there's got to be a resurrection
[59:08] amen now look he says
[59:12] he says what was in that man why wasn't
[59:14] in egypt just as good as any other place
[59:17] he said he he was a prophet he knew
[59:18] where the resurrection was going to be
[59:19] wasn't going to be in egypt would be in
[59:20] palestine
[59:21] put your hands on my crippled hip and
[59:23] you swear by the god that i served you
[59:25] you're my prophet son you'll not bury
[59:26] him my bones down here take me up yonder
[59:28] and bury me
[59:29] joseph being a prophet also laid his
[59:31] hands upon his crippled dead he said
[59:33] i swear by the god of abraham isaac and
[59:34] jacob i'll not bury you here
[59:36] he took him up and buried him in that
[59:37] land why he said when joseph died he
[59:40] said don't you bury me down here don't
[59:42] you bear me down here why
[59:43] god has got everywhere but he has a plan
[59:46] joseph was a prophet he said someday
[59:49] he said listen his words the lord god
[59:50] will visit you
[59:52] will take you out of this land when you
[59:54] go you take my bones
[59:56] he said that quickening power was in
[59:58] them bones
[1:00:02] he said oh if the spirit of him that
[1:00:03] raised up christ from the dead dwell in
[1:00:05] you
[1:00:06] he'll also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:00:12] they're getting where now they can take
[1:00:13] the dna out of bones from
[1:00:15] thousands of years ago out of bones
[1:00:19] there's something in the bone that
[1:00:21] identifies
[1:00:24] amen and speaking spiritually now i'm
[1:00:27] not saying that if you had a limb
[1:00:29] transplant or something that you
[1:00:30] couldn't
[1:00:30] that part of you wouldn't go up i'm not
[1:00:32] saying that at all but what i'm saying
[1:00:34] is spiritually the bones the
[1:00:36] the basics of what you are is election
[1:00:40] that's the basics that's what forms you
[1:00:42] that's what may that's what caused you
[1:00:43] to be saved
[1:00:44] it's the election of god that's the
[1:00:47] bones
[1:00:49] you still got the bones when it seems
[1:00:51] like everything else is going wrong
[1:00:53] so he says he says that quickening power
[1:00:58] he says was in them bones he said oh if
[1:01:01] the spirit of him that raised up christ
[1:01:02] from the dead dwelling you who also
[1:01:04] quicken your mortal bodies
[1:01:05] don't put my bones down here bury them
[1:01:07] up there with those of the promise
[1:01:10] and brother branham in back in
[1:01:12] entombment in 1957 he says the reason
[1:01:14] those prophets did that
[1:01:15] and wanted to be buried in palestine he
[1:01:18] said they knew that the resurrection was
[1:01:19] not going to be in egypt
[1:01:21] it was going to be in palestine alone he
[1:01:23] said that's why i say tonight
[1:01:25] he said i've got all kinds of names i
[1:01:27] don't care what people call me
[1:01:28] it doesn't mean a thing to me the only
[1:01:30] thing that i want to do is know this
[1:01:33] i've been dead and my life is hidden
[1:01:36] christ through god
[1:01:37] and sealed by the holy ghost and when he
[1:01:39] calls me from among the dead i'll answer
[1:01:41] on that day
[1:01:42] he said bury me in christ
[1:01:46] amen bury me in christ for those that
[1:01:49] are in christ will god bring with him at
[1:01:51] that day
[1:01:53] bury me there let me be planted in the
[1:01:55] word let my
[1:01:56] spiritual identity who i am be buried in
[1:02:00] the word
[1:02:03] and if i'm buried in the word then it
[1:02:05] doesn't matter what somebody says about
[1:02:06] me
[1:02:08] it doesn't matter what other people
[1:02:09] think doesn't matter other opinions but
[1:02:12] i'm buried in the word
[1:02:15] it doesn't even matter what i do though
[1:02:17] i wouldn't want to do anything to
[1:02:18] displease god
[1:02:20] but i'm buried not in what i do but in
[1:02:23] the promise
[1:02:27] so brother brown says the only thing
[1:02:29] that i want to do is know this that i've
[1:02:30] been dead
[1:02:31] he said and my life is hidden christ
[1:02:33] through god and still by the holy ghost
[1:02:34] so when he calls me from among the dead
[1:02:36] i'll answer on that day
[1:02:37] bear me in christ for those that are in
[1:02:40] christ will god bring with him at that
[1:02:41] day
[1:02:43] you go in in second kings 13 21 you find
[1:02:45] out that
[1:02:46] elijah's bone still had that quickening
[1:02:48] power
[1:02:49] even after he was dead the flesh was all
[1:02:53] gone
[1:02:55] because the bible says that the moabites
[1:02:56] come up in the land and says as they
[1:02:58] were burying a man
[1:02:59] behold they spied a band of men they
[1:03:01] cast the man because they needed to run
[1:03:03] faster you know
[1:03:04] so they took their dead man and just
[1:03:05] cast him into the tomb of elisha
[1:03:09] when the man was let down and touched
[1:03:11] the bones of elisha he revived
[1:03:16] that's some bones right there
[1:03:20] that's some bones elijah's dead and all
[1:03:23] the flesh is gone everything's dried up
[1:03:26] imagine being the moabite how he must
[1:03:28] have felt
[1:03:31] he did you know and he's he's had it
[1:03:33] rough he may have been chopped to pieces
[1:03:35] we don't know he get dead in the battle
[1:03:36] and his friends just toss him in the
[1:03:38] prophet's grave
[1:03:40] he just stands up whoa wait a minute
[1:03:46] woke up in a graveyard but he was alive
[1:03:49] why because of the bones
[1:03:51] amen the bones had the potential of
[1:03:54] resurrection
[1:03:56] amen someone saw that everything they
[1:03:59] touched was
[1:04:00] risen amen
[1:04:04] i want us to go to ezekiel chapter 37
[1:04:07] and i know most of you knew i was going
[1:04:08] there so
[1:04:10] ezekiel chapter 37 and verse 1.
[1:04:16] let's look at some bones
[1:04:19] and just think about this now in context
[1:04:21] of what we've said that
[1:04:23] he said that many are the afflictions of
[1:04:24] the righteous but the lord delivered
[1:04:26] them out of them all not one bone will
[1:04:27] be broken
[1:04:28] and then you find nicodemus and joseph
[1:04:30] of arimathea examining the body and
[1:04:33] they see all these wounds but no broken
[1:04:35] bones
[1:04:37] fulfilled the promise in ezekiel 37
[1:04:40] 1 it says the hand of the lord was upon
[1:04:42] me carried me out in the spirit of the
[1:04:45] lord
[1:04:46] set me down in the midst of the valley
[1:04:49] full of bombs
[1:04:51] that's usually where the warfare is is
[1:04:53] in the in the valley
[1:04:55] dave and goliath come to fight against
[1:04:56] one another they come together in the
[1:04:58] valley
[1:04:59] they were camped on either hill they
[1:05:00] come together in the valley
[1:05:03] so he says it was a valley full of bones
[1:05:06] they died he said it caused me to pass
[1:05:09] by them round about
[1:05:11] he said and behold there were very many
[1:05:13] in the open valley
[1:05:15] oh they were very dry
[1:05:20] we're very dry they didn't make no sound
[1:05:25] didn't make no movement they just sat
[1:05:28] there like a
[1:05:29] bone it's not connected to anything
[1:05:35] and when it's not connected it just lays
[1:05:37] there
[1:05:38] it doesn't move what do your bones do
[1:05:40] when you sleep
[1:05:42] unless your nervous system moves them
[1:05:45] they just stay there
[1:05:47] huh these were very dry bones
[1:05:50] without moisture the body can't lift
[1:05:55] these bones were not just bones but they
[1:05:58] were very
[1:05:59] dry bones there was nothing on them
[1:06:02] but bone nothing but bone
[1:06:06] but they still had potential
[1:06:09] because all of the bones were there
[1:06:13] you just couldn't know where they belong
[1:06:15] but they were there
[1:06:17] they were out of joint they were spread
[1:06:18] out all over the valley but they were
[1:06:20] there
[1:06:23] the bones were there
[1:06:26] and he said unto me son of man can these
[1:06:29] bones live
[1:06:32] i love the wisdom of the prophet
[1:06:36] because the mystery of whether these
[1:06:38] bones could live or not
[1:06:40] the mystery of the resurrection of the
[1:06:41] bones laid it was held in the mind of
[1:06:44] god
[1:06:46] right because what does he say can these
[1:06:48] bones live
[1:06:49] he doesn't say who knows this way a lot
[1:06:52] of people take that is
[1:06:53] can these bones live i don't know that's
[1:06:55] not what he said
[1:06:57] he didn't say who knows he said you know
[1:07:04] i know some of you have prayed for
[1:07:05] people for a long time
[1:07:08] i've got family i'm praying for people
[1:07:10] that i'm praying for
[1:07:12] can these bones live he knows
[1:07:18] i can't tell one from the other
[1:07:22] they all look like dry bones they all go
[1:07:25] to the same amusements they all drink
[1:07:27] the same alcohol
[1:07:28] they all smoke the same cigarettes
[1:07:31] they all go to the same churches the
[1:07:33] same world they're all they're all part
[1:07:35] of the same
[1:07:36] same system can these bones live
[1:07:40] the preacher doesn't know the prophet
[1:07:43] doesn't know
[1:07:48] but the mysteries in the mind of god can
[1:07:50] these bones live
[1:07:52] he said you know
[1:07:56] too quick to give up on people
[1:07:59] can these bones live they're all dry
[1:08:02] they're all dead they all need revival
[1:08:05] we're too quick to give up say well the
[1:08:07] church is going through a tough time
[1:08:08] i'll just leave and go somewhere else no
[1:08:10] the bones can these bones live
[1:08:14] god knows very bad
[1:08:18] all the bones were there can they live
[1:08:21] now we know that
[1:08:23] this was a type as well of of the jews
[1:08:26] and this is
[1:08:26] the primary type of the scripture is of
[1:08:28] the jews and their return to the holy
[1:08:30] land
[1:08:32] and we find then that the jews and the
[1:08:33] holocaust were
[1:08:35] slaughtered until there was nothing left
[1:08:39] but bones and you find them
[1:08:44] pictures where there's nothing but shoes
[1:08:46] piled up
[1:08:47] they were incinerated they made ashes
[1:08:51] and bones and it seemed like
[1:08:55] that for those people god didn't do them
[1:08:57] any good
[1:09:01] you know and this has always been a
[1:09:02] quandary among the jewish people because
[1:09:05] they understand that they're god's
[1:09:06] chosen people but they don't really
[1:09:07] understand what good it does to be god's
[1:09:09] chosen people
[1:09:12] because all that they ever brought them
[1:09:13] is persecution
[1:09:16] and they've been destroyed over and over
[1:09:18] again but they're god's people
[1:09:23] and over and over again they've been
[1:09:24] destroyed and they said we're special
[1:09:26] we're god's people and every time they
[1:09:27] say it
[1:09:28] they get kicked down again
[1:09:31] and so these jews in the holocaust were
[1:09:33] slaughtered
[1:09:35] but revelations chapter 6 tells us that
[1:09:38] there was
[1:09:39] they were under an altar there were
[1:09:40] souls under the altar
[1:09:42] crying how long and we know they
[1:09:44] couldn't be a gentile bride because they
[1:09:46] cried for vengeance
[1:09:50] and that wouldn't be the type of christ
[1:09:51] at all that wouldn't be christ's sight
[1:09:54] but they cried for vengeance what were
[1:09:56] they they were these
[1:09:57] souls under the altar that had been
[1:09:59] martyred
[1:10:01] can these bones live you go through the
[1:10:04] holy ghost you go through that time and
[1:10:06] even to today and you look at it and say
[1:10:08] there's not much hope
[1:10:10] but somewhere there's 144 000
[1:10:14] pretty jews can these bones live
[1:10:19] you see they were scattered all over the
[1:10:20] valley all over the world
[1:10:23] and there come a time when during that
[1:10:26] that that world war period when
[1:10:28] and during the first world war and after
[1:10:30] the first world war between the wars and
[1:10:32] endure after the second world war there
[1:10:34] was that time when there come a great
[1:10:36] a great movement a great return and they
[1:10:39] began to come back what was it those
[1:10:40] bones were coming together
[1:10:44] because they have to be in a physical
[1:10:45] place
[1:10:48] right but what's happening to us is the
[1:10:49] bride we don't come together in a
[1:10:50] physical place
[1:10:52] but we come together in christ the word
[1:10:56] under one head the word and when we come
[1:10:57] together in christ what happens
[1:10:59] the bones start coming together
[1:11:04] so he says you know lord that these
[1:11:06] bones can live
[1:11:08] because you know the name of each bone
[1:11:11] and where it belongs and how it connects
[1:11:14] to the body
[1:11:16] you see god knows what we should be
[1:11:19] doing
[1:11:20] we don't know the mystery is in the mind
[1:11:23] of god and he reveals that to us
[1:11:26] as when we need it right but sometimes
[1:11:29] you'll do for a year you don't
[1:11:30] understand what should i be doing then
[1:11:31] one day you realize
[1:11:32] this is my place this is where i belong
[1:11:37] why because that mystery was held in the
[1:11:38] mind of god but it comes down to you
[1:11:41] in the right season the bone comes
[1:11:43] together
[1:11:44] he knows where he where you belong and
[1:11:47] in verse 4 again he said unto me
[1:11:48] prophesy upon these bones
[1:11:51] and say unto them oh ye dry bones
[1:11:55] hear the word of the lord amen
[1:11:59] notice he doesn't say hear the
[1:12:03] hear the great anointing or here the
[1:12:06] great miracles and that's wonderful
[1:12:08] he says hear the word and the anointing
[1:12:11] follows
[1:12:12] you hear the word the miracles follow
[1:12:14] hear the word all these other things
[1:12:16] follow right these things follow them to
[1:12:20] believe but he said hear the word
[1:12:22] we underestimate the power of the word
[1:12:25] to make these bones live
[1:12:29] amen now these predestined bones
[1:12:32] are there in the valley he said prophesy
[1:12:34] to these bones i'm saying to them oh you
[1:12:35] dry bones hear the word of the lord
[1:12:38] thus saith the lord god unto these bones
[1:12:40] behold i will cause
[1:12:42] breath to enter into you and you shall
[1:12:43] live
[1:12:45] and i will lay sinews upon you and bring
[1:12:47] up flesh upon you and cover with you
[1:12:48] with skin
[1:12:49] but breath in you and you shall live and
[1:12:52] you shall know that i am the lord
[1:12:55] he said so i prophesied as i was
[1:12:58] commanded
[1:13:00] and as i prophesied there was a noise
[1:13:05] he said i prophesied there was a noise
[1:13:08] and behold it's shaking
[1:13:10] and the bones came together
[1:13:13] the church started taking shape
[1:13:17] the bones came together
[1:13:20] amen he said and bone to his bone
[1:13:25] now we know that this happened there was
[1:13:27] a an army of god there in that first age
[1:13:29] but now
[1:13:31] it was lost in the dark ages but we've
[1:13:33] seen a restoration
[1:13:35] these bones scattered in the valley and
[1:13:37] it come through luther and through
[1:13:38] wesley through pentecost and brother
[1:13:40] branham in one place said that shaking
[1:13:41] the bones come together with a
[1:13:43] pentecostal revival
[1:13:45] there was a great shaking the bones came
[1:13:48] together bone to his bone
[1:13:50] he said when i beheld low the sinews and
[1:13:53] the flesh came upon them
[1:13:55] the skin covered them above but there
[1:13:58] was no breath in them
[1:14:00] amen they'd been through the the
[1:14:04] the lutheran move and the wesley move
[1:14:06] and the pentecostal move
[1:14:08] but they still didn't have life
[1:14:12] he said oh breath now they had the
[1:14:15] potential of life
[1:14:16] but they didn't have the fullness of it
[1:14:19] now he said unto me
[1:14:21] he said prophesy unto the wind
[1:14:25] notice he's already prophesied once at
[1:14:26] the beginning
[1:14:28] now he's prophesying again prophesy to
[1:14:31] the wind prophesy son of man say to the
[1:14:33] wind thus saith the lord god
[1:14:34] come from the four winds o breath
[1:14:37] breathe upon these slain
[1:14:39] that they may live so i prophesied as he
[1:14:42] commanded me
[1:14:44] and the breath came into them and they
[1:14:46] lift
[1:14:47] what did they do they lift they stood
[1:14:49] upon their feet
[1:14:51] an exceeding great army
[1:14:54] there was a resurrection of all of the
[1:14:56] bones
[1:14:59] and it come in stages and the first the
[1:15:02] skin come on and then
[1:15:03] the sin you come on the muscle and then
[1:15:05] the skin and and then
[1:15:07] they laid there in the valley but he
[1:15:08] said prophesy again
[1:15:12] so he says and they lived and stood upon
[1:15:15] their feet and exceeding great army he
[1:15:17] said unto me son of man these bones of
[1:15:18] the whole house of israel
[1:15:20] behold they say our bones are dry and
[1:15:22] our hope is lost
[1:15:24] we are cut off for our parts
[1:15:27] remember he said many are the
[1:15:29] afflictions of the righteous
[1:15:31] our bones are lost we are cut off for
[1:15:33] our parts
[1:15:34] i can't tell you this morning that being
[1:15:36] a christian is going to be easy it won't
[1:15:38] be easy if you're going to come god's
[1:15:41] way you're going to have to
[1:15:42] give up yourself you're going to lay
[1:15:44] yourself on the altar
[1:15:46] if you're going to come god's way you're
[1:15:47] going to have to live for him you're
[1:15:49] going to have to endure persecution
[1:15:51] you're going to have trials you're going
[1:15:53] to get sick sometimes but he said i'm
[1:15:55] the lord that healeth all thy diseases
[1:15:57] but you're going to get sick there's
[1:15:59] going to be things happen to you you're
[1:16:00] going to go through
[1:16:01] times of trial like we've had here
[1:16:03] lately but remember
[1:16:06] you still have the potential of
[1:16:07] resurrection
[1:16:09] listen he says he's he says our bones
[1:16:13] are dried our hope is lost we are cut
[1:16:15] off for our parts therefore prophesied
[1:16:16] saying to them
[1:16:17] thus saith the lord god behold my o my
[1:16:19] people i will open your graves
[1:16:22] amen cause you to come up out of your
[1:16:24] graves bring you into the land of israel
[1:16:26] you shall know that i am the lord when i
[1:16:28] have opened your grave so my people
[1:16:30] brought you up out of your graves and
[1:16:31] shall put my spirit in you you shall
[1:16:33] live and i shall place you
[1:16:35] in your own land and then you show you
[1:16:37] know that i the lord has spoken and
[1:16:38] performed it saith the lord
[1:16:40] can you imagine what it'll be like for
[1:16:44] the jews now think about it
[1:16:46] think about it they come out many of
[1:16:49] them
[1:16:50] were in russia or different parts of the
[1:16:52] world
[1:16:54] and they died there they died there
[1:16:58] and they become that one of those souls
[1:16:59] under the altar
[1:17:02] and they said how long lord in those
[1:17:06] hundred forty four thousand they have to
[1:17:07] come and
[1:17:08] go through their persecution and all
[1:17:09] those things and
[1:17:11] and they have to die also and but those
[1:17:14] bones
[1:17:15] will come back
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:20] and that's more than just natural bones
[1:17:22] because some of them were incinerated
[1:17:23] and everything else
[1:17:24] but all those bones
[1:17:27] the bones that were broken and messed up
[1:17:30] and
[1:17:30] and out of joint and all over the place
[1:17:33] will come back
[1:17:35] and they'll walk on the land of
[1:17:36] palestine
[1:17:40] look around say what did it and they'll
[1:17:44] see him
[1:17:46] very bad the one that they rejected
[1:17:49] you tell me god's not merciful you can't
[1:17:51] tell us you can't tell a believer that
[1:17:55] because the one that they rejected the
[1:17:56] one that they turned down two thousand
[1:17:59] years later
[1:18:01] they're walking around how'd we get here
[1:18:05] he said you were mine you were my bones
[1:18:11] the bones were important because they
[1:18:12] were my they were my bones they're the
[1:18:14] bones of
[1:18:14] the makeup the the wife of christ of
[1:18:17] jehovah that had been
[1:18:18] that had forsaken him and went out with
[1:18:20] so many other lovers
[1:18:22] we got him back
[1:18:27] oh church imagine what a time they'll
[1:18:31] have
[1:18:33] walking on the ground don't you realize
[1:18:37] that's where we're at spiritually
[1:18:40] we're living in that time when our we've
[1:18:43] been resurrected by the word not
[1:18:45] there'll come a time it'll come
[1:18:46] naturally too
[1:18:48] it'll we'll see him in the flesh i
[1:18:49] believe that
[1:18:51] we'll see him in his body brother brown
[1:18:53] said that's what believers believe and
[1:18:54] it will seem in a corporal body
[1:18:57] but for now we've been risen in christ
[1:19:00] raised sitting in heavenly places
[1:19:03] walking on the ground
[1:19:05] that abraham looked for walking on the
[1:19:07] ground that all of them look for why
[1:19:09] we know the the whole story we know the
[1:19:11] whole lamb of god
[1:19:13] we're able to take advantage of every
[1:19:15] part oh church don't stop
[1:19:17] short in this hour don't don't stop
[1:19:19] short and say well
[1:19:20] i go to church that's enough i know get
[1:19:22] into the message of the hour
[1:19:23] find out what the word says this word is
[1:19:26] able to make you live
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:35] he said you shall know that i am the
[1:19:36] lord when i've opened your graves
[1:19:39] he said and brought you out of your
[1:19:40] graves and shall put my spirit and you
[1:19:41] shall live and i shall place you in your
[1:19:42] own land
[1:19:43] and shall you know that i the lord has
[1:19:45] spoken and performed to saith the lord
[1:19:47] why did he do that because they are his
[1:19:50] why does he do it for us because we are
[1:19:52] his
[1:19:55] psalms 135 and 4 for the lord has chosen
[1:19:57] jacob unto himself
[1:20:00] and israel for his peculiar treasure
[1:20:05] there's also a prophecy concerning the
[1:20:06] bride brother brown speaks up in the
[1:20:08] restoration of the bride tree he says
[1:20:10] four killers took it
[1:20:11] speaking of that bride tree four killers
[1:20:14] killed the bride tree four messengers
[1:20:15] destroyed it
[1:20:17] for four messengers of death took it
[1:20:18] away in dogmas
[1:20:20] four messengers of righteousness restore
[1:20:22] back again
[1:20:24] prophesy son of man can these bones live
[1:20:28] he said i wish we had time he said i got
[1:20:31] it wrote down here but i have to miss
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:34] if you listen to the tape the people
[1:20:36] kind of holler out for him to take his
[1:20:38] time
[1:20:39] so he takes just a little bit he says
[1:20:42] what's the four stages
[1:20:44] he says of that coming forth of that
[1:20:46] church
[1:20:48] what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry
[1:20:49] bones coming forth
[1:20:51] he said but the life only come not when
[1:20:54] the sinew skin was on them
[1:20:55] but when the wind blowed upon them he
[1:20:58] said that's when come back that fourth
[1:21:00] message of life i will restore saith the
[1:21:03] lord
[1:21:04] he says hallelujah glory praised me to
[1:21:07] god the fourth light is to come
[1:21:09] he said that will bring forth the same
[1:21:11] signs amen
[1:21:13] watch he said justification brought back
[1:21:15] the pulp sanctification brought back the
[1:21:17] bark
[1:21:18] the doctrine of holiness well brought
[1:21:20] back the leaf pentecostals
[1:21:22] leaves clap their hands joy rejoicing
[1:21:24] now we still have the pope the
[1:21:26] justification we still believe that
[1:21:28] we so have the sanctification of the
[1:21:30] bark the doctrine of holiness
[1:21:32] we don't give that up in this hour but
[1:21:35] we've moved on
[1:21:37] so we don't we have it but we don't have
[1:21:38] just that
[1:21:40] right we still have the leaves
[1:21:45] clapping their hands the leaves that are
[1:21:46] for the healing of the nation's
[1:21:47] brotherly love
[1:21:48] we still have that that that atmosphere
[1:21:51] i'm so glad we still do
[1:21:55] so he said we still have that or what
[1:21:57] what brought back the leaf that was the
[1:21:59] pentecostal but what he said the fourth
[1:22:00] was the word itself
[1:22:03] amen as brother brandon put it we have
[1:22:05] that plus
[1:22:08] he said the fourth was the word itself
[1:22:10] the word made flesh
[1:22:11] fruits of the proof of the resurrection
[1:22:13] sign that christ has
[1:22:15] finally after justification been planted
[1:22:17] sanctification been planted baptism of
[1:22:19] the holy ghost organizations died out
[1:22:21] and christ has again centered himself
[1:22:23] like the cap of the pyramid
[1:22:25] first sign saint justification
[1:22:27] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:30] and then the coming of the cap listen
[1:22:33] the full word
[1:22:35] produces the full mature bride
[1:22:39] don't give up on those bones
[1:22:44] now listen brother brother says notice
[1:22:48] the vindicated word in this body is this
[1:22:50] very
[1:22:50] victory i read that too fast
[1:22:55] listen the vindicated word where
[1:22:59] in his body
[1:23:03] the prophet had to be vindicated but the
[1:23:06] vindication of the word is in the body
[1:23:10] and part of that is the prophet in our
[1:23:11] day there's things that he did we don't
[1:23:13] have to do
[1:23:14] and that no one else will do right but
[1:23:18] that's the vindicated word that's in the
[1:23:19] body but the vindicated word in his body
[1:23:22] that's us is his very
[1:23:25] victory that's very simple because
[1:23:30] if the body is not vindicated if it
[1:23:32] doesn't show signs of life
[1:23:34] it proves that something wrong with the
[1:23:35] head
[1:23:39] you could take that to all kinds of
[1:23:41] places
[1:23:42] the body doesn't show signs of life it's
[1:23:45] something wrong with the with the
[1:23:46] leadership
[1:23:47] so this message come to bring us the
[1:23:49] head
[1:23:50] so the leadership could be right amen
[1:23:53] because the leader is not your pastor
[1:23:55] the leader is not some other man but the
[1:23:56] leader is christ
[1:23:57] the word and so he says
[1:24:02] that the vindicated word in his body is
[1:24:04] his very victory
[1:24:06] and the reason of his death
[1:24:09] when the the romans the the emperors
[1:24:13] would come back they would have a
[1:24:14] jubilee and they would come back after
[1:24:16] conquering they would come and have
[1:24:17] parades
[1:24:18] and they would get all the things that
[1:24:20] they gathered all the gold and the
[1:24:21] silver and the slaves and
[1:24:22] all the things that they gathered and
[1:24:23] parade them down the streets of rome
[1:24:25] and the people would would shower with
[1:24:27] flowers and all these things why
[1:24:29] because it was it was a victory they
[1:24:31] were showing their victory it was the
[1:24:32] fruit
[1:24:33] of the victory they depended on that for
[1:24:35] their very life and their their
[1:24:37] power and all those things that was
[1:24:39] their victory
[1:24:40] what is his victory he comes walking
[1:24:43] down the road with this bride
[1:24:46] amen amen we are his victory and the
[1:24:49] reason of his death see the death not in
[1:24:51] the spirit when he died
[1:24:52] he only died in the flesh his spirit
[1:24:55] went to hell and preached to the souls
[1:24:56] in prison
[1:24:57] he said that's right the flesh only died
[1:24:59] then he raised it up again
[1:25:01] and quickened it a bit
[1:25:05] amen he raised it up again and quickened
[1:25:07] it
[1:25:09] now he said quicken means made alive his
[1:25:11] flesh which was his body and that's the
[1:25:14] word
[1:25:15] amen it's been laying dead for years
[1:25:19] but it gradually began to come in the
[1:25:21] reformation and now
[1:25:25] well i'm waiting for something to happen
[1:25:26] if we don't have it now we'll never have
[1:25:28] it
[1:25:30] listen to me and just just bear with me
[1:25:31] we'll close in just a moment
[1:25:33] but if if this message can't produce a
[1:25:36] rapture on its own
[1:25:38] without my intervention without me
[1:25:41] changing it
[1:25:43] then it's the wrong message
[1:25:47] if it can't produce it without me
[1:25:49] becoming a legalist
[1:25:51] trying to make it happen or becoming
[1:25:52] some kind of a tyrant
[1:25:55] or becoming some kind of a person who
[1:25:58] who forces it to happen or are changing
[1:26:00] the doctrine in some way
[1:26:01] try to spiritualize it it stands on its
[1:26:04] own
[1:26:06] it is what it is amen and i believe
[1:26:10] it's the word of god
[1:26:14] i don't have to make that happen now she
[1:26:16] is standing upon her feet listen if
[1:26:18] she's not standing on her feet now if
[1:26:20] you're waiting
[1:26:21] on something else to come where
[1:26:24] you know and then people wait on brother
[1:26:25] branham to come back but there's people
[1:26:27] waiting on other things
[1:26:29] and if we're not careful we look at
[1:26:30] those that wait on brother branham to
[1:26:31] come back and say well that's terrible
[1:26:32] but we're waiting on
[1:26:33] the next revival or the next preacher or
[1:26:37] the next thing no
[1:26:37] it's now
[1:26:41] now she's standing on her feet
[1:26:44] hey man now she's standing on her feet
[1:26:47] why
[1:26:48] because she's received the full word
[1:26:51] he said oh how i wish i had time to go
[1:26:53] back into ezekiel this is in
[1:26:54] in christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:26:57] said and pull out them dry bones and
[1:26:58] show you
[1:26:59] he said can these bones live again
[1:27:03] he said prophesy how can prophecy come
[1:27:06] only through the prophet well
[1:27:10] if i need to know about it my pastor
[1:27:11] will tell me you better get into the
[1:27:12] word
[1:27:16] you have to know that what i'm telling
[1:27:17] you is the truth
[1:27:22] how can prophecy come only through the
[1:27:24] prophet and the bible that's because the
[1:27:25] bible says that
[1:27:26] you'll only reveal it through the
[1:27:27] prophet he said it's the word of the
[1:27:29] lord hear you dry bones
[1:27:31] the word of the lord and send you skin
[1:27:34] to come upon them
[1:27:35] and they stood up a mighty army he said
[1:27:37] beginning to march towards high and he
[1:27:38] said glory to god that's him
[1:27:42] he said that's him the victory
[1:27:46] pretty bad let's put it on a real
[1:27:50] personal level go back to psalm 34 19.
[1:27:56] many are the afflictions
[1:28:01] of the righteous but the lord delivereth
[1:28:04] him out of the mall
[1:28:08] he keepeth all his bones what do you say
[1:28:11] that's him
[1:28:12] huh that's the victory
[1:28:16] not one bone of his was broken we can
[1:28:18] say it this way not one bone of hers
[1:28:20] will be broken
[1:28:22] the bride
[1:28:25] not one predestined bone will be lost
[1:28:28] but think about that personally you
[1:28:30] could say well
[1:28:32] my experience isn't very good right now
[1:28:36] i'm suffering persecution you might do
[1:28:38] that
[1:28:40] i suffer loss you will as long as we
[1:28:43] live here
[1:28:45] this flesh gives me problems
[1:28:49] you might get so that you get weary of
[1:28:52] even living
[1:28:54] at times some might even die
[1:28:59] doesn't mean they're not the bride
[1:29:05] in some way you know we look at failures
[1:29:07] in our life and i'm just talking to you
[1:29:09] now but
[1:29:10] we look at failures in our life and
[1:29:11] think well that's the end that's all
[1:29:13] there can be
[1:29:14] but even death is a failure on some
[1:29:16] level
[1:29:18] because we didn't make it in the rapture
[1:29:21] and he said well
[1:29:21] it's a failure on some level but yet a
[1:29:24] lot of us the lord terrorists will go
[1:29:25] through that
[1:29:27] but it has nothing to do with the inside
[1:29:31] it's the flesh that fails god doesn't
[1:29:36] fail
[1:29:39] you suffer persecution you go through a
[1:29:40] time when you feel
[1:29:42] i heard brother darrell ward preach one
[1:29:43] time a a message called a bottle in the
[1:29:45] smoke
[1:29:46] i don't know if you've ever heard him
[1:29:47] preach on that a bottle in the smoke
[1:29:49] david said
[1:29:50] he said i'm like a bottle in the smoke
[1:29:52] it's a skin that would be hung up in the
[1:29:54] in the tent and the smoke would would
[1:29:56] come up on it and
[1:29:58] it would dry it out and crack it i'm
[1:30:00] like a bottle in the smoke
[1:30:02] you go read the psalms you find out
[1:30:04] david was god's chosen vessel but he
[1:30:06] went through it man
[1:30:09] i'm like a bottle of smoke i can't even
[1:30:11] hold water i'm cracked
[1:30:13] i don't feel like much like a christian
[1:30:17] but there won't be a broken bone in his
[1:30:19] body
[1:30:21] that's bad not one predestined bone will
[1:30:25] be lost
[1:30:28] what do i need to do brother man what
[1:30:29] how do i get out of this place hear the
[1:30:31] word of the lord
