honor to be here in this in this meeting appreciate brother Ben for inviting us to come and and I I want to say that I love brother Ben brother Ben for a long time and I've been blessed to watch him as and the gift of God in his life is there's one thing you can say about brother Ben is he's a servant and um and that's nothing new you know that amen those that know brother Ben he served under brother ivy for many years and looked and always watching Emma's see he worked hard behind the scenes to help brother Ivy there and play and playing second fiddle so to speak but um was always to always there to make sure that the program got over and we appreciate men like that we appreciate you that's good when a pastor doesn't have to worry about a about people working with him amen I think all you pastors can say Amen to that and um so we're we're thankful to the Lord for for this opportunity and we're just so blessed to have so many people here a lot of our friends over the years that

when there's so many ministers around and and um but I look here at these at these two soldiers uh right up here on the front row brother Bo and brother Daryl and and great warriors of the Gospel men that have that have labored in the kingdom of God for many many years and I say God bless both of you Faithful Men of God and they're both I I I tell you what they are both incredible men with swords

his and his ministry and the work that he's doing for the Lord and and we appreciate all of you fine Brothers amen let's look here in in Psalms 92 and if I've missed anybody here tonight y'all please forgive me I'm gonna I'm gonna Now read my scripture amen it is a 92-1 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name almost High to show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings upon the Sultry and upon the heart with a solemn sound for thou Lord Hast made me glad through the through thy Work I will Triumph in the works of thine hands O Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish man or a stupid dull-hearted unreceptive man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your love thank you for your grace to fill your presence that we have here tonight I'm asking God that your Holy Spirit would just remain Among Us and Lord that you would help me to get out of the way and that you would speak through me that you would anoint me anoint the people Let Your Grace be here with us bless our brother Den Lord in the congregation for all of the labors of love that they have given I ask God that your Holy Spirit would be with us in a supernatural way we love you Lord reporting for Duty now in Jesus name can the Church Say Amen and a man God bless you you may be seated amen I will Triumph in the works of thine hands I want to speak for a moment maybe for a little bit on Amen Thanksgiving unto the Lord as our brother um Glover mentioned last night and didn't brother Glover do such a wonderful job last night that was that was a wonderful message brother amen and his scripture that he that he started with is this poor man cried and the Lord heard and the Lord delivered him out of all of his troubles this poor man cried David knew what it was he knew what troubles were all about I I think David we could read through the psalmist David was pretty transparent with his with his trials and the situations that he went through and brother uh the psalmist David went through a lot of Trials you can read in the Bible and and there he was anointed to be king and the next thing he knows he's he is out being chased by the king himself and he's living in caves David knows what it is to have to call unto the Lord and rely upon the Lord amen but but here we're when we look at this scripture that we're just reading David is is wanting to express something unto the Lord amen another place there in Psalms 103 and 1. he says bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord somebody say bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgives all thine iniquities and who heals all thine diseases who redeems thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender Mercy who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like unlike the Eagles as I begin to look at this what an incredible pyramid and David must have had is the man as he's looking back at what God has done for him and I think we could all even look back to that and how you've had some of those prayer meetings where you've where you've just begin to reminisce begin to go back and think about what God has done for you you've went back and seen that God's been faithful to you have survived four of God was with you when when it looked like everything else was gone and you were down for the last count no can you say man looking back where he brought you from and now he's established you upon his word amen God's been good to you I I think about David as he's reflecting on these things and his man and there must be something that begins to welm up in him bless the Lord oh my soul I I don't want it just to be a recipient of what you've done for me but I want to make sure that you know that I know that you have been good to me I want you to know that I know and that I am thankful for the blessings that you have given me I want you to know with everything that is within me that I am thankful for what you have given me in my life is there anybody in this building that is thankful to the Lord for His blessings upon your life amen you see when you look at this a man this desire it was a response what caused this response to uh from David brother uh or brother Branham would say it's a reaction to an action it's because God has been so good that David is now looking back and saying thank you for being good oh my too many times we come to church and we just sit here as you know knots on a log and and and we don't know what it is to live in Victory because we're not living in Victory at home but if you ever get in Victory at home that you'll have victory in the church when you have a think how he raised me how he lifted me up and turned me around how he placed my feet On Solid Ground it makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord I love you amen I don't know how the rest of it goes praise the Lord amen but it's but but it's a song of thanks unto the Lord can you say Amen and I think David must have been really a man he must have got beside himself as he began to think about how God had been good to him how God had forgiven oh David had some problems in his life David had some situations in his life that looked pretty bleak amen but God forgave David and God brought him out and God redeemed David and God's loving kindness was with David and God's Tender Mercies never went out if it was thankful can you see man man what a reaction bless the Lord O my soul what a reaction a man that word bless it means to kneel it means to adore it means to salute it means to praise I will bless him with all of my might my soul and my strength there in Psalm 63 and 3 it says because somebody say because thy loving kindness is better than my life then my lips shall praise thee somebody say because thy loving kindness is better Hallelujah my praise thee will I while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with moral and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and I meditate on thee in the night watches be clouds thou has been my help oh can I get a witness you see when you're looking at what he has done for you it creates a praise on the inside of your heart Hallelujah I think we need to go back tonight and begin to thank God for what he has done for us I think we need to go back and say God if it hadn't been for your grace if it hadn't been for your mercy if it hadn't been for your love amen this boy would not be here tonight but it's been because of your divine grace Hallelujah how can you say man amen because thou has been my help amen therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice that said there in second Peter 1 and 13. he says I think it meet amen that as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance putting you in real are y'all hearing me yeah now you say now brother this is this is pretty shallow here tonight it's pretty deep for some of you Hallelujah because God we should be thankful in here tonight [Applause] well praise the Lord Hallelujah there should be a joy burning up in our heart there should be something amen that is bubbling up because God's been good to me man my boy shouldn't be here tonight amen when he was mama was pregnant with him Hallelujah it looked like it was totally impossible he was born too much premature and and it didn't look too good and there I sat at the hospital his mom on one into the hospital and I see you amen he was in the other end of the hospital and a baby I see you and their God wasn't given either one of or the devil wasn't giving anyone of them any chance the doctors had told me it just it just doesn't look good Hallelujah but I remember the day amen a week or two into it amen when the doctor came out and said listen something just happened to your wife she just lost 10 pounds of fluids her kidneys are starting to work you see I've got a lot to be thankful for [Applause] yeah the Daryl there's a reason you're crying every time you tell the testimony of Jessica when you think hallelujah oh come on Church God's been good to you God's been good to you can you say man you see amen the Apostle Peter is saying I want to stir you up by putting you in remembrance you've not followed some cunningly devised fable when we made known unto you the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty can you say man I will bless somebody say I will bless the Lord but you see the word blessed did you know bless first belonged to the Lord the word bless the word blessed came from God now I want you to think about that there it didn't belong to the Mortal being at all right amen what can you say man what by the way what could a mortal man ever give to God to make him any greater the word bless comes from the Hebrew word Barack it comes 330 times in the Bible and most always it is deity that is doing the bestowal they're in Genesis 1 and 22 and the Bible says and God blessed them and saying be fruitful and multiply we'll praise the Lord you see we think about our blessing we think about our giving thanks we think about our being a blessing but you see God is the one who was the first one to blast and it's because of God's blessings that you can reciprocate and bring back and bless him well praise the Lord amen all creation depends upon that blessing amen the Lord is the author of all life the Lord is The Giver of all Health the Lord is the bestower of all blessings well can y'all hear me tonight amen Psalms 104 and 27 it says these all wait upon thee that thou mayest give them their Me In Due season that thou give us them they gather amen thou openest thine hand and they are filled with good thou hidest thy face and they are troubled thy taketh away their breath and they die and return to the dash thou sendeth forth thy spirit and they are created thou renew us to the face of the Earth so if it had not been for the blessings of God upon Humanity Humanity would have nothing to return with that it was God who said and God blessed Noah and God blessed Abraham and God blessed are y'all hearing me we are reliant upon the blessings of God Hallelujah we should never get too big amen for our britches we should be thankful for what God is doing we should be thankful amen I have nothing to give without you giving it to me first praise the Lord man Abraham the central theme to Abraham the central theme from God to Abraham is what God blessing Abraham we praise the Lord I'm saying that if God has been good to you there should be a desire within us to let him know how much we love you and you say Amen Hallelujah the Bible says there in in the book of uh Genesis it says amen uh are there in Genesis 28 and 14 and thy seed shall be as uh let's see here amen uh there your thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the side and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families be blessed can you say amen he says I Will Bless thee and thou shalt be a blessing amen he comes back and he says I will bless them that bless thee another place he says in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed Abraham was blessed because God dealt personally with him now now I I want to tell you Amen in this in this you know this Pentecostal age that we're living in to where stuff means blessings you know we're thankful for the thing things that God gives us but I'm here to tell you if God is dealing personally with you and revealing himself personally to you and showing himself in divine revelation to you that you ought to be thankfully here because there is no way that a man can ever come to God except God draws him first except God blesses him first except God brings him to himself first there is nothing what can you say man Abraham was blessed because God dealt with Abraham well praise the Lord now lot on the other hand he had a lot of materialistic things can you say Amen he had wealth prestige he was the mayor of the city amen Mrs Lott was in the High class of society but hey but lot was not blessed you say now how can that be brother Wendell he's driving a nice car he's got a nice house he's the mayor of the city hey man they they are you're hearing me but you see he was not blessed God appeared unto Abraham he did not appear unto lot lot was blinded to the fact amen that Sodom was fixing to burn lot was blinded to the fact that he was fixing to lose his family lot was blinded to the fact amen that everything he had all of his possessions were fixing to burn but it was the blessings of God upon Abraham that opened his eyes and says I will not hold anything back from Abraham [Applause] Abraham was blessed but praise the Lord now Abraham was over there on the hill hot living in a tent waiting on a promise that he had been waiting on for a well a million years come on church amen and the Bible says when God showed up on Earth he says let's stop by Abraham he's my friend I will not hold anything back from Abraham I have already blessed Abraham I gave him my promise that through Abraham come on church amen if God gave his elect that promise then there should be a response from the elect there should be a response from the elect saying thank you Lord [Applause] can you see man Amen in fact when God appeared on Abraham Hallelujah he says they're they're in Genesis 18 and 19. he says for I know him I know him I'm going to stop I'm not going to hide anything from Abraham for I know him that he will command his children in his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment and the Lord that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken unto him amen that word command is not being bossy it does not mean being demanding amen but that word a command it simply means to make or create in the sense of appearing as a beacon or as a monument so the scripture should read this Abraham will erect as a beacon or a monument or as a token his children and his household after him to keep the ways of the Lord Abraham is blessed [Applause] I believe it was the psalmist that says Thou says seek my face and I said thy face will I seek it is God that does the drawing [Applause] and it is us that does the responding I think we heard a little bit about that last night the pool something pooling something drawing so come on church amen when you're in your trial you've got a you've got something to look at you're either gonna throw up those hands and say I believe I trust I'm standing on the promise or you're going to give in and give out and get the belly grubs and get all kinds of Amen you know looking at the doubts of your life stand upon the promise of God [Music] can you say man amen you see Abraham was given that promise God gave the promise Abraham was in a position to intercede because he was blessed his eyes were open are y'all with me here tonight amen I'm fixing to get somewhere huh I say that the blessings if God's appeared in this last generation and he's given you an understanding of what he's doing you're blessed if you young men that are setting up here on this on this front period here amen Pew shares whatever hallelujah amen you guys got the uncomfy ones amen Hallelujah but if you're sitting here tonight and there's something that is drawing and God's saying I'm going to stop by Hardy Arkansas to wherever you're from and I'm going to reveal myself to this one and to this one and to this one you should say I'm blessed it's not who has the prettiest girlfriend it's not who has the prettiest cars not who has the fanciest of house it's who has heard from the voice of the lord it's the Lord that gives it's the Lord that gives the Revelation it's the Lord who does the blessings you can't bless me you can't bless me you can't bless me you can't bless me but the one who created me has blessed me can you say amen I Will Bless thee is what he told Abraham and when God blessed him his eyes were unveiled and he could oh Hallelujah can you say Amen you see what creates this in our hearts I want us to look for a moment at the levitical pronouncement of blessings to the elect of Israel the Bible says that the priests were to bless them on this order he says these are my people these are the Sheep of my pasture and this is the way that I want the blessings to come number 6 and 23 he says speaking to Aaron unto his son saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them the Lord bless thee and keep thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless there you're being blessed tonight you're being blessed tonight because God's anointed me to come and put his name on you you're blessed tonight

the words of the seventh angel messenger come on Church anybody can hear those guys outside there but there's only the alert that is going to hear the message of Malachi 4. it's the elect of Malachi 4 that is going to rise in a Rapture and God says I will hold nothing back why because God has already blessed you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life God spoke faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and I want to say that hearing by the word of God before the foundation of the world there is a seed on the inside of you when the word of God comes to you you hear it [Applause] your blast somebody say I'm blessed Hallelujah I haven't been feeling too very well these these last couple weeks and I I just almost backed out in coming but I thought you know I'm blessed and I want to do what I can to put my shoulder behind the wheel to tell somebody else you are blessed [Applause] you're not blessed because you got him as your pastor

enemies and an adversary and divine adversaries I'm talking to a blessed people for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites hibites and the jebusites and I will cut them off you are blessed Deuteronomy 28 and 2 all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt over a hearken unto the voice

against he to be smitten before thy face and they shall come out against thee one way and flee before these seven ways do I have anybody in the building that is blessed and the Lord shall establish thee holy people [Applause] oh yeah well praise the Lord now David's thinking about I think that David is thinking about all of the blessings of the Lord and David's just he's just he's just about

blessing to God now it is David responding back it's David it's the pool and the responding to the poor another is something in David that is saying oh bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me what is man the psalmist David put it here says when I consider thy heavens and the work of thy fingers and the moon and the stars which thou Hast ordained what is man the thou art mindful of him and the son of man the thou would his visit him can you say Amen David is asking who am I that you would care for me it begins to scream out are you serious you mean you've done this for me you've

the power now it's incredible how that God how brother Branham said in this last day in when he's opening the seals he says now the opening of these seals is the time when everything must worship come on everything must worship he said John was the type of the Bride he says he said John seen his name in that book and he got so excited he said he was having a Pentecostal Jubilee He says if I've ever seen one that's what John was having a Pentecostal Jubilee he says they heard him in the heavens they've heard him under the Earth they hurt him on the earth they heard it they heard John just a shouting glory to God he said John must have really been heaven he said you know why because he's seen himself in the book [Applause] it was just guesswork but when the book was open yes sir yes amen when the book was open he found that he was blessed they found his name in the book he found that God had him in that word so when the book was open John seen his name and he begins to praise oh come

on it was written already in there that for you that you were going to be holy blimp without blemish Without Blame You were going to be pure unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ it was already here amen but it was a whosoever will until the revelation of the book and then it became personal to you it was the Revelation drawing you pulling you it was that third pull anointing your eyes I will say of the Lord he is I belong in this passage I'm ordained to be here just as that Shepherd belongs in his pasture this sheep belongs in the pasture with the shepherd my name has been in the book it's

placed over the people for when the word is placed over the people the people can identify who they are [Applause] and then you can start getting a little step in your in your feet then you can start shouting then you can start rejoicing because you know who you are thank you who can you say man did you know that Judah was the first to go in in the promise their judges one and one it says after the death Joshua came to pass the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who should go before us the Canaanites against the Canaanites first to fight against him and the Lord said send Judah Judah means praise sin Judah he says he said the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have already delivered the land into his hand well praise the Lord no wonder if brother random would call it King lamb

come Judah prays to give thanks to lawn in praise to sing Praises of Judah means to cast down to shoot arrows to throw down praise for the Brenham he says now ten of them said oh it's too much of a job we just can't do it well them people we look like grasshoppers by the side of them and but what did you and Joshua do he steal the people and he said wait a minute we are more than able to take it no matter how little we are how much in the minority what was he doing he was standing true to that promise I give you this land but you'll fight for every inch of it and then he says do you believe that's given you your healing but you'll fight for every inch of it everywhere the soles of your feet says I want to give you for possession footsteps means possession it's all yours every promise belongs to you but you'll fight for every inch of it every inch of the way Joshua knew what God Said he was a Seed of Abraham he said I believe that God give us this land and we're more than able to take it and because he stood the test against the whole group of the Israelites and all the tribes and all the people moaned and cried Joshua said keep steel God made the promise no matter how big you are and what the opposition is and what the doctor said God gave the promise and it's up to God to do it he do when he come down to the river of Jordan he possessed that gate that's what he's done another place he says now forgive me if I hurt you no don't you do it I'm doing this in the name of the Lord Jesus come back [Music] David standing Yonder Jesus Christ a fugitive from his church

ahead go ahead it's all right oh worship is to prostate yourself before prostrate yourself before a king to lay flat on your face and recognize that there's a the presence of someone larger in the room that's what we're doing I wonder if we've lost our ability to be moved by the word you helping with some of you you need the Holy Ghost you need to be seeking for it Now's the Time [Music] get any clearer than that Now's the Time some of us Elders we need to break through some some bitterness we need to break through some carnality we need to we start loving people again [Music] you know what it's you need to be able to be touched I don't know as a minister I know where the windows felt this he Brothers sometimes you just just can't touch somebody you try and you see them and you just can't get through to him and in the church they'll be sitting there and week after week week after week but one day God does something supernaturally in their life and all of a sudden they begin to hunger for God that's everything for one person sister Stephanie did that for you a little over a year ago that's why she can praise the Lord because she knows what she wants and she knows what God did for her having changed her life every one of us should know that all my life you have been faithful you brought me to trials and situations it wasn't perfect but you loved me and I'm gonna bow myself before a mighty God or whatever you want I'm Not Afraid not afraid to worship I'm not afraid to Bow myself down we're not trying to work up anything we just want God we want him to have his place to be the main main one in the meeting to be the one who's feels that we love him we're returning that blessing to him was that a masterpiece tonight hey Ben I'm going to ask Brother David Morris if he's still David back there I ask you to come and and dismiss us and pray with the food but what we're going to do is we're going to worship for a while and just as you feel to leave you
