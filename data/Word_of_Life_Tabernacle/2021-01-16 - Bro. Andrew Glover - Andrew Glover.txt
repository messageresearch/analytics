lord we do not gather here out of form or fashion lord we do not gather here out of tradition but lord we gather here because there is a deep calling into the deep the lord there is a there is a desire in our hearts lord to lord to be more like you to know you more in the power of your resurrection lord as we come here tonight father i pray that your spirit would come lord as the songs of zion have been sung lord lord your prophet told us that if the atmosphere is ever created that all things are possible when the atmosphere is right and i pray tonight dear god that the atmosphere would be pleasing unto you lord i pray that you would send angels into this building tonight father you see the hands that are lifted behind those hands are needs lord whether it be physical or spiritual lord financial lord whatever the need would be material lord whatever that need is lord your word said that where two or three would gather in your name you would come and you would meet

mean are you happy to be here tonight amen happy to be a christian and then we greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again good to see everyone out tonight in the house of god all of our friends from donut brother matt's and some from brother jason's and then here at the church here it's just good to good to be together tonight amen with believers have liked precious faith and brother matt texted me and told me to greet you for him so i want to do that and we sure thank the lord for the opportunity to get together hey man i tell you after this colvin it's good to be anywhere amen just to be out of the house and be together believers i heard the prophet of god say today he said there's nothing like believers getting together in the fellowship of his word and i believe that's what we've come here tonight to do is to fellowship around the word of god and we know that when the word is preached demons are cast out lives are changed and we're believing that tonight aren't you if you have your bibles while you're standing with us tonight we want to turn to the book of genesis the first chapter and we sure i want to say it's good to be back here with you all here at hardy again and my the building sure has changed since we was here last time but it's looking looking real nice and good to see what the lord is doing here for you and appreciate brother ben his friendship allowing us to come and be with you this weekend and i sure appreciate brother josiah mclaren coming with us from home there he helped us drive out here so we sure appreciate that appreciate him being here with us this weekend and we're just looking for the lord to speak to our hearts tonight aren't we amen we know if he comes all things are possible here in the book of genesis of the first chapter i know this is not an unfamiliar scripture in the 26th verse the bible here says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so man was made to have dominion so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them or could we say he give them identities in the 20th verse and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth up on the earth also i'd like to look at the book of revelations the third chapter revelation uh the third chapter in the 17th verse i know it's a passage of scripture we're familiar with tonight as message believers in revelation 3 and verse 17. you love the lord this evening amen the bible here says in revelation 3 verse 17 because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked brother brown would call that and knoweth it not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there for just a few moments this evening from those scriptures if the lord would help me i would like to speak to you here and if i title this tonight i want to speak to you on a for a few moments here on identity crisis identity crisis how many believes we're living in a time of crisis we're living in an hour where the world is in a crisis tonight they really don't know what to believe they don't know what to turn to they don't know what is truth and what is fiction what is gospel and what is man's ideas what is the word what is creeds and dogmas the world don't know tonight but thank god he sent us a message in this hour that we would know the difference between truth and air and the prophet of god would tell us this and the faith of abraham he said now to you in radio land this might seem very strange to you but i like sometimes he said just to kind of baby along with the peoples he says but it comes to time and it is now where they got to know what's the truth how many believes the time has come where we've got to know what is the truth he said see the people forget who they are he said you're just not an ordinary person you are a christian you are sons and daughters of god by the grace of god he said then why should you be in the condition you're in why should you be doubting and have frustrations amen you're not just an ordinary person you are a christian you are a son and daughter of almighty god and i think tonight that the devil does not want us amen to know what is truth he does not want us to come in contact with truth because jesus himself said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and i don't believe tonight that this is the hour of bondage i don't believe this is the hour amen to be tied down and to be backed up in a corner and not know who we are but i believe the hour has come amen that the sons and daughters of god have got a right this is not just a privilege this is not just just something that's been given to you but i believe if you are a son or daughter of god tonight amen we have been given a right to know what is truth in the time of crisis now the word crisis means a time of intense difficulty of trouble or danger a time when a difficult or important decision must be made it's a critical period it's a critical point it's a turning point or it's a crossroads and i think tonight that every one of us here amen are at a critical point we're at a turning point and we're at a crossroads tonight either we're going to go on and we're going to go forward and we're going to possess the promises of god or we're going to remain where we're at we're going to remain in the condition we're in and we're not going to go any further but i believe tonight amen that there are some believers here tonight that recognize that they're not just men women boys and girls amen they recognize they're not just human beings not just fathers and mothers but they're actually sons and daughters of god that have been bought by the blood of jesus christ and they have got a right tonight amen to know the truth and by knowing that truth amen they've got a right to go free by the truth they know amen what good would it do is to not to know the truth if there was not a way to go free what good would it do us tonight amen to know there was a deliverer in the midst of the church if there was no way he could deliver us amen but i want to remind you the devil is a liar amen he was a liar to begin with and he's a liar here tonight and there is still a liberty in the truth of jesus christ now as i said it's no question tonight that we are living in a time of crisis the world is in a crisis they meant the national a life is in a crisis financial is in a crisis political is in a crisis and the religious world is in a crisis tonight they're all in a difficult point amen but i think as the prophet of god would say that in a time of crisis is the time to call a conference in the time of crisis is a time to call a conference he said come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be a scarlet they shall be as white as snow and though they be red like christmas crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the lamb but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord has spoken in he said that's what we're here tonight is in a conference he said this is a conference where we get together we've had them in national and here in the last world war he said we wonder what conferences are amen what are they for anyhow it's for them to take the most intelligent group of the group and come together and to work out some strategy to do something in a time of crisis is when they call conferences together he said be a wonderful time to have one in the universal church the living god wasn't it on the account of the crisis that we are facing he said communism and all things the isms this world he said the church is cooling off and it's time for us to come together and reason and get together on these things now think about it when the time comes brother david that the church begins to cool off when the church begins to draw back that's not the time amen to separate ourselves and divide ourselves amen but that's the time to come together amen and call the conference and i think tonight amen we're living in a time where the world is falling apart amen churches are closing doors are closing the world is falling apart but there is a pride here tonight that did not come for just another service we did not come just to sing another song amen but we've come here because there's a possibility amen that if the fire is gone out there is still a god in heaven that can relap the fire if the child is going out of the church there is still a possibility for the shout to come back amen can i just be at home tonight preach for a second i don't know what you think but let me tell you what the prophet said we need he said what we need is a good old-fashioned amen acts 2 revival and the bible holy ghost back in the church again listen we got a lot of problems i know we got a lot of circumstances i know but we have still got a promise and if we'll come together and begin to call on the name of the lord amen that the windows of heaven will open up and a blessing will come from almighty god i tell you what you may not even feel like raising your hands tonight amen but if there is a god here he didn't bring you here for just a service he brought you here for a conference you may not even feel like saying amen but if there's a desire in your heart that goes to show god didn't bring you here and then just to occupy time but he's called you here for a conference and if god calls a conference let me go ahead and tell you something something's about to change amen if god calls a conference it's a sign amen that something's getting ready to change if the president did not call the conference it's a sign something in the world is getting ready to change well there's a man here tonight who can turn on the light and then there is a god here who is higher than the president who is higher than the government and his name is the lord jesus christ and when he shows up and then something's fixing to change amen how many will claim that tonight something's fixing to change if jesus comes on the scene something's getting ready to change i don't know where you're at tonight but let me tell you this amen it's not too late amen to change it's not too late to turn around it's not too late to realize who you are and who bought you and who you belong to and you're not just an ordinary person and then you're a child of the living there's a god even though the world is in confusion and the churches are cooling off he said there's still a possibility things can change and then now the problem of god said when we have a conference he said what do we do we call together and then those just got the highest intelligence amen of everybody in the group amen we get the brains together right we get the smart men together right and the product of god said gracious almighty god who before there was even an atom in the air or a molecule in adam you were god and in this great being called god there was attributes there was an attribute to be a father an attribute to be god an attribute to be a healer an attribute to be a savior and there was nothing to save or nothing to worship you so you were just the great source of all intelligence amen see he was the great source of all intelligence he said and when god ever makes a decision it has to ever remain that way it cannot change he cannot get smarter he is the source of all intelligence amen no matter what our science says if it's against the intelligence or the word of god it's contrary and it's not right he said i don't care how scientific they can prove it amen if it's against the word of god then it's still wrong then to think tonight church we have not come together amen under a bunch of intelligence of man or intelligence of a bishop or intelligence of a preacher amen but the intelligence of all intelligence has returned in this age amen to conference with the church the living god now i'm about to explode here for a second amen do you realize who's in the building tonight it's not just a preacher it's not just a deacon amen but the god who stepped out on nothing and created everything amen the god that was before adam the god that was before abraham amen the god that was there when there was nothing but molecules and atoms but he took nothing and created a garden of eden that's the god that's in this building tonight and let me assure you if he can take chaos and transform it into a garden of eden that he can take a wrecked up life he can take a messed up church he can take a broken family and get him in the spirit of god and in a few moments time it'll go from chaos amen to a garden of heathen where the spirit of god can flow through there hey i don't know what the devil's telling you but let me tell you what the word says he's here he's here tonight amen the source and then the source of all intelligence listen friends amen our counselors have got to have counselors our psychologists have got to have psychologists our mental doctors have got to have mental doctors amen but he is the doctor of all doctors he is the counselor of all counselors he is the physician of all physicians and when you hear him speak his answer is perfect his diagnosis is accurate and his cure is the safety of the lord and nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it what is it church it's the source of all intelligence now how many knows john 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen god is the word and the word is god then the word is the intelligence and the intelligence is the word see the word is the intelligence and the intelligence is the word then to think here tonight amen he may not be here in a corporal body amen but if his word is here it's the same as him being here his word in him is the self-same faith that's why jesus said search the scriptures for in them you fake that you have eternal life and they are they which testify me the prophet said first thing i'd sit down and i'd look it up in the scriptures and see if it was in the bible amen first because that's where all truth comes from is from the bible amen see all truth actually comes from the bible and if it comes from the bible then it's coming from the source of intelligence and what is intelligence amen intelligence is the word amen then you realize when you've got intelligence amen you've got to have it but you got to communicate with it and then you got to operate it and let me say this god is the author of communication god is the author of communication before there was a telephone before there was a telegram before there was a tele email or anything else amen there was god who was the god of intelligence and you know what his word said his word said give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend unto the voice of my supplication for in the day of my trouble i will call upon me for thou will answer me amen see he's telling you in the time of crisis in the hour of a critical turning point amen if you'll just open up your mouth and begin to call on him he said i'll answer in psalms 91 15 he shall call upon me and i will answer him in jeremiah 33 3 call unto me and i will answer thee and will show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not see invite him in invite the source of all intelligence to come in the church and he will discern situations he will answer unknown questions he will reveal the secrets of hearts he will open up the scripture come on church amen i don't know if you realize you're not amen but i'm not inviting him here he's already here i'm not trying to beg him to come he's already here and you know what if he's here tonight you know what we ought to do we ought to make him welcome if he's here tonight we ought to make him welcome you say how do you make him welcome with a hallelujah and an amen and a hand raised and a clapping of that what are you talking about i'm talking about the god that had the answer before you had the question is in this building tonight amen the god that was the cure before you possess the disease is in this building tonight can i preach here for a minute amen the god that is the sin breaker is in this building tonight before the sin ever claimed your body the god amen who said i will never leave thee nor forsake me that's the god that is in this building tonight i don't have time amen to go through all the adjectives of what he is but let me just tell you what isaiah said he's wonderful amen he's mighty amen he's a god of all gods he's the everlasting father he's the prince of peace and he's here tonight amen to have a conference with you and to bring a resolve to the situation oh brother andrew you don't realize my situation you don't realize what i'm going through you don't realize the crisis i'm in my bible said he will answer in the time of crisis he'll brother ask a question will god answer in a time of crisis he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis if the people assemble together no matter if it's two or three he said he would hear from heaven not only will he hear you and then not only will he answer your call but he will come down in the midst of crisis and will manifest himself amen as the i am hey i'm trying to behave myself and in the time of crisis he will come right down in the church and he will change things he will change your whole listen friends i serve a god that shows up in the darkest of ours i sow a god i serve a god when it's all dark he's still the light it don't matter how dark it is ain't that all he needs is somebody that'll call on him all he needs is somebody that'll invite him in and he'll come in and manifest himself hey you say what are you preaching what do you preach about preacher well let me tell you this no matter how dark amen the demons of unbelief against this message becomes he'll still manifest himself are you hearing me amen no matter how cold a family comes against this message he'll still manifest himself no matter how many demons of unbelief amen

listen i'm not just up here preaching about something i imagined amen i am a witness amen that god comes in the time of crisis and manifests himself you say what are you talking about i know that i'm just gonna stop give a testimony here for a second hey man i know of a situation in a home one time where there was a family all broken up amen the daddy was leaving the message mom had been getting on websites and was all tore up didn't know what to believe anymore and the past they were sitting under had become a good old-fashioned psychologist who laid aside the message said we didn't need the message books we don't need the prophet's tapes in the church library all we need is dr dobson and some old psychology idea and he filled the church full of that and everything that the family was feeding on was nothing but psychology but there was one man there who was a deacon in that church that still believed that there was power in this message and he said listen he told the young lady he said listen next time and then that home erupts you call me and i'll come over there and he call him they got a call and he went over and he went in the home and he sat down and he said now what's wrong and the father was mad brother brahm's a liar and the woman was mad the message was wrong amen that little holy ghost-filled beacon he said well listen i didn't come here amen to represent psychology i come here to represent god and he pulled out a message book and he said this message is thus saith the lord it's the absolute to the church it's the amen to the bible it's the interpretation of what god has done in this generation and let me tell you that family is sitting together tonight because somebody ain't been called out to the god of intelligence in the hour of crisis and god came on the scene and manifested himself as more than a religion that's more than an idea but as a reality that the i am i am has come down are y'all hearing me tonight what are you up there saying i'm saying just call on him amen just call on him amen brother andrew he won't answer me yes he will just call on him and then just call on him he'll answer you in the midnight hour he'll answer you when everything is falling apart he is still the god that said if you'll just call i'll answer i feel like preaching here for a minute and then you know what if you're going to call somebody first thing you got to do is open your mouth are you hearing me hey man if you're going to call somebody if you're going to say something first thing you got to do is open your mouth you ain't going to get it frowning hey you ain't going to get it sitting there nod you got to open up your mouth amen and that's what bartimaeus done he knew there was a god that was passing by that could change the situation they told him to shut up they told him to hold his peace but he knew that that was more than a man he knew that was more than a teacher he knew that was intelligence been walking in flesh and if i'll just open up my voice and begin to call on him brother howard you'll come in the midnight hour and he'll answer oh brother andrew my situation's too dark no it's not if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven are you hearing amen then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land the problem of god said we christians have got to wake up somebody shall wake up we gotta wake up to a reality to real genuine faith tie it to the word of god and plead that promise yes sir if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you want and then again if the people that's called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then i'll hear from heaven amen do you realize my bible tells me the time will come amen that before you even call he will answer and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they're yet speaking i will hear think about that the time will come before you call he will answer and while you're yet speaking he will hear amen the prophet said and be gathered here in this building tonight under the heat of the weather yet the glorious spirit of jesus christ is in the building amen how many will stop right here and agree with me that the glorious spirit of jesus christ is in the building amen okay we've got three that agree amen how many will agree that the glorious spirit of jesus christ is in the building see then if he's in the building he's ready to make well the sick and to make the needy to be satisfied and to supply whatever we have need of your heavenly father knows the needs you have before you even ask him are y'all hearing me tonight your heavenly father knows the need you have before you even ask him amen then when you come here tonight he didn't say oh well josiah's going to be here and dale's going to be here and and joel's going to be here amen brother chad's going to be here i didn't know that brother harvey you showed up i didn't know that it's going to be here well let's mix something together and give an answer amen but before you got here amen he knew you was going to be here and the answer was already here amen sister eve amen you're a witness amen if you need a healing in your body amen just open up and call and the healing is there for you can i preach a second we went down there the other day and she come up can i share that come up for prayer and a pain in her shoulder and couldn't sleep amen but we just prayed you know what i got a testimony the other day amen two nights later hadn't had no pain and slept all night you see what that is that's a sign amen that no matter what the condition the world's in no matter what condition washington's head when the saints of god amen begin to call on the name of jesus he'll come down in the time of crisis and manifest the realities of who he is oh brother andrew what are you talking about i'm talking about a people that knows who they are they know where they come from they know where they're at they know where they're standing and they know where they're going they know who is with him see israel was a nation do you believe that but they was in captivity in egypt there was the product of god so there were hard times under the egyptians amen you know what they had to do they had to labor and serve as the people of god in captivity as the nation of god amen and everyone had grown cold down there now i ain't got time to preach here all night amen but by the circumstances and by the things they were going through they had grown cold the prophet said did you know israel was in egypt twice as long as the united states has been a nation we're not over about 150 or 70 years old something like that and they were 420 years in bondage down in egypt but it cometh time somebody shouted come a time but it come a time when it seemed like all hopes was gone but there was one man amen and one woman who seemed to have faith in a historical god that spoke to abraham in the time of crisis and they believed they believed they believed they believed i'm not a broken record they believed that they could call on him and he would answer and that was amram and jochebed the mother and father of moses notice here amram and josephine were actually more than just human beings in captivity egypt they were identified believers they had an identity they were identified believers but they didn't identify themselves with payroll they didn't identify themselves amen with the conditions around them they identified themselves with the vision that god gave abraham in genesis 15 when he said your seed would sojourn in a strange land for some 400 years but afterwards i will bring them out and i'll bring them out with great substance see they identify themselves they meant brother joe they went over there and they said you know who that's speaking of that's speaking of the amram that's speaking of me joseph that is speaking of me and they were convinced can we have church here tonight they were convinced that the same god that answered abraham was the same god that would answer them they were not hoping they were not guessing they were not probing they knew if we just call on him he'll answer if we just open up her mouth and the bible says in genesis 15 that it was a vision but do you realize what it was it was more than a vision it became a reality to them it become more than a scripture it become more than a vision it became a reality and i say to not church we are a part of the seed amen that's leaving with great substance ah can i preach here for a minute amen they were down there in bondage they were down there in captivity but they never took on the mentality of captivity amen they never lost their identity and so well i guess we're just going to be here always and i guess this is our end amen but they knew if we just call on god and we identify ourself with that vision it'll become more than a vision it'll become a reality and let me say this tonight church the time has come amen that this message is more than a book on the shelf it's more than something you read when you need to add something to your sermon it's come time that this message has got to become more than just a vision it's the absolute it's your whole you're looking at a preacher tonight that's got the guts to say it this message is the absolute of this generation as long as i got breath in my body i'll say this and it's more than a vision it's a reality tonight we're gonna leave here church are you hearing me church what identity are you under tonight amen the prophet of god said a man's got to be convinced first and the only convincing thing is the manifestation so reading don't convince them amen here and alone doesn't convince but they've got to see the manifestation or the identity of the gospel being identified in you when you see that you have passed from death unto life and become a new creature in christ jesus that's the identity of the holy spirit how can the holy spirit write the bible and turn around and deny what he wrote see he cannot do it that's the identity of unbelief amen see that's it any of them but the identity of belief let's say this together the identity of the holy spirit the identity of belief the identity of unbelief the identity of unbelief is to deny what has been written but the identity of belief is jesus said these signs shall identify those who believe in me see we know that's god's own word ain't been seen an identity of unbelief is to deny the word but the identity of belief is to believe the word in the age you're living in see what is identity identity means the fact of being who or what a person or a thing is amen it's not an opinion it's not a guess it's not a hope so it's a no-show how can we preach here for a minute amen it's a no-show it's a no-show it's not a you didn't know you was gonna sew a front row did you it's a no-show it's not a hope soul it's not a guess so it's a no-show i know who i am i know what i believe i know where i'm going i know who i'm calling on are you hearing me tonight church come on church the world is an identity crisis tonight they don't know who they are oh don't look at me like i'm crazy boys don't even know if they're boys anymore and girls don't know if they're girls and men don't know what bathroom to use it's an identity crisis well let me just preach here for a second i'm here shouldn't i amen republicans don't know if they're republicans and democrats don't know if they're democrats and liberals don't know if they're liberals amen the world is confused and that same devil is trying to bring an identity crisis in the church by the living god because he knows if i can just get the sickness if i can just get the germ in the church i'll wipe it out but i join my faith tonight with brother being and with every believer here tonight and i say satan we are believers we are holy ghost believers we are sons and daughters of god we believe this message we believe this prophet we believe this vision it's more than a vision it's a reality tonight i'm not confused i know who i am i know what i believe i know where i come from i know the god i'm serving i'm not here trying to figure out who i am well is it the truth or not come on it's a time brother brother harvey the time has come you can be whatever you want to be just to identify it you can have a doctor say it's a boy you can have chromosomes that's a boy you can have a birth certificate so it's a boy you can have a whole family say it's a boy and let the individual say i'm a girl well i just want to identify as a girl amen see but the problem is that's an opinion and not a fact and your identity has got to be from a fact and not an opinion well you should preach what he talked about well look at amran and joseph they knew who they were they never took on the identity of unbelief the prophet said they were real poor but they were christians they mean they worked hard they was in slavery they had to make mud bricks and things for the old king moses mother joseph ed had taken and put him in the little raft out in the river like that and those old crocodiles had eaten up all the little babies and you know she got them crocodiles away from him and she made this little arc and she put him in and then she made it out of the pitch you know what it was it was turpentine an old gator would come up and say a little fat hebrew i'll get him hear him crying like that one over there what a smell see the mother was led on how to protect the baby and then the mother was led on how to protect the baby but here's my question who was doing the leading brother ben who was leading moses mother when he went down there when she went down there and made a made a little basket to put him in who was leading her well the problem of god said amen that satan tried to destroy moses he said satan tried to destroy jesus same as he did moses he tried to tempt him do the wrong thing but he couldn't do it why he had been sprayed with the repellent of predestination are you hearing me he had been sprayed with a repel and a predestination it cannot be deceived the word said he would be here and there ain't no devil going to bother him and no other son of god [Music] thank you lord i feel the preacher coming on right now amen that ain't good enough just for moses amen that ain't good enough just for jesus but he actually puts you there he said the same devil that came to moses and tried to destroy him was the same devil that came to jesus and tried to destroy him he said but he couldn't destroy moses and he couldn't destroy jesus the son of god and you have been sprayed with the repellent a predestination and he can't destroy you either [Music] [Applause] oh that's predestinated take his place he sprayed somebody shouts prayed with the repellent he said satan's poisonous denominational doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing going to bother him it didn't have any effect upon him see so what was the repellent it was predestinated seed let's say that together god's repellent is predestinated seed come on amen them crocodiles weren't just smelling turpentine they weren't just smelling amen a hebrew baby they were smelling the smell of god they were smelling amen the smell of predestination come on church you know as well as i know a predestinated seed puts off an odor brother a predestinated seed puts off an odor amen you just get a predestinated seed around a bunch of chickens and let them start clucking about this message and an old productionated seed he'll sit there and look but he won't cluck with him and they'll say what's wrong with you don't you believe what we believe he can't because there's a devil there trying to shift the life out of him but there's a repellent in there are you all hearing me tonight amen can we do amen can we just preach here for a second the devil can't get you he wants to but he cannot get you he's trying to get you but he cannot get you he's tried to destroy you but he cannot destroy you you say well it's because the family i'm in or the church i went to or the pastor i sit under oh no it's because god placed a repellent on the inside of your soul from before the foundation of the world [Applause] [Music] i know what i'm talking about hey man i was down hunting one time at david mills some of y'all know brother david here down in florida he took him brother danny's steaming they took me out there brother david it was september it was hot man it was about 85 degrees in in september i mean it was hot in the morning before the sun even come up we're going out to hunt down here in florida and i look brother danny i said there's mosquitoes out here brother david said well here's a here what they call that thing it's a oh i just went blank thermacell you're from arkansas you know and it's a thermocell it give me that thermocell man i i thought what's this thing going to do he said when you get out there he said the mosquito is going to be swarming he said just flip it on and they won't bother you you know there's a man here that can turn on the light he said just flip it on it won't bother you so i climbed up there brother harvey and i was sitting up there in the tree and about about about oh i don't know 5 36 in the morning here come ones and it bit me and then i thought this thing don't work so i text brother david i said david this thing ain't working he said well it may be out you said you meant to put a refill in it i said well if there's not one i'm gonna be out cause i ain't gonna sit here all day i go home i'll go to the room a minute so i put a rep i put a put a refill in there flip the thing back home you know what amazed me amen it was still dark but when the sun come up come on i looked around me and for about i don't know they meant how long a radius but all around me was a swarm of mosquitoes and then they were there it was that big around but the glorious thing about it was there wasn't a one of them could get to me they were buzzing around dying to bite me they were dying to get a hold of me they mean they were dying as brother jewel said to get some dark chocolate amen he said he said then mosquitoes were dying to get me he said but you know what they couldn't get through the barrier amen they couldn't get through are you all hearing me tonight i don't know if you see it or not but i see demons swarming around this field and they're dying to get you they're dying to get your church they're dying to get your family but the grass oh but the predestinated seed says stand back you can't touch them you can't have them you can't possess them they're mine i've claimed them they know who they are thank you lord are you hearing me church the devil right now is dying to get you but he can't because he can't get past the smell of predestination well brother andrew said moses rejected the throne to the popularity he could have young girls wives by the hundreds could have had scepters under egypt rule the world the world later on his feet he was haired every bit of it but by looking in the scripture and seeing the day he was living in and know that something in him that pre-destinated seed of god went to work can i preach to you for a second moses looking at all that and said i'll fall there and every bit of it i'll leave this mud pit and i'll sit on the side of pharaoh's throne but the pre-destined seat on the inside of his soul went to work and the prophet said moses was a predestinated seed jesus was a predestinated seed and see because you are a predestinated seed just like christ was and when the rain falls on the seed that life produces itself when the holy spirit falls now how many knows genesis 1 11 says every seed must bring forth of its own kind and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind let's say that together after he is kind whose seed is in itself up on the earth and it was so see the seed was there and the seed controlled the vessel to yield the fruit now look at what this word kind means it means the species every seed must come forth of its own kind and god in the beginning made man in his own image and that's the kind of man that god makes today the seminary and the incubator hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids but when god calls a man he's in his own image the word made alive in him [Music] that's right amen notice here you got to be born not come just come on a new creature yes in his own image of his kind to be expressed word on earth see god's kind he said it's going to be word expressed on earth then what are we to be sons of god with the expressed word in the church but if you're god's kind i mean it's god's kind he said that's different see you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest oh my why it's got to if the water falls on it it's got to do it see the holy ghost rain is being poured out in this last day to identify god's kind the holy ghost reign is being poured out in this last day to identify amen god's kind and the devil's kind now you said andrew what are you talking about well god's kind how many believes there's a god's kind god's kind knows who they are god's kind knows whose they are and the identity of belief knows but the identity of unbelief wonders are you hear me the identity of belief knows but the identity of unbelief wonders i wonder if i'm a son of god i wonder if i'm a child of god i wonder if i've got the victory i wonder if i'm an overcomer i wonder if i can possess all things i wonder if the holy ghost has sealed my soul amen but the identity of belief which is god kind says i know now come on church we gotta find our type in the scriptures right and the promise god said jesus knew who he was jesus knew who he was but satan wondered well i got the quote here in front of me jesus noted by faith in the revelation of god's word in his own predestined life glory jesus knew who he was satan was wondering he know that he was a predestined creature of god and god himself was manifested in him it wasn't him doing the works it was the father that dwelt in him see then jesus knew the word by revelation are you hearing me jesus knew the word by revelation but satan knew the word by theology that's why he was wondering because there's no vindication to authority there's no vindication amen to theology there's no authority to theology amen can i preach to you for a second i heard a prophet of god say we have received the revelation by the hand of vindication we have received the revelation by the hand of vindication then come on church whether brandon did not deliver an opinion he did not deliver a theology he delivered a revelation that he could stand invisible union and say we now have the revelation of the seventh seal the lord i wish somebody helped me preach her for a second amen i want you to see tonight church brother david we're not here wondering we're not here guessing we're not here hoping we are here with identity by the word of a prophet in this hour oh i feel like shout right now amen the pronoun of god said see he said jesus knew the word my revelation satan knew the word by theology he said therefore satan was like a walking bible he was light brother dale that's a little word but it's a big word he was like a walking bible but you know the difference was jesus was jesus was a walking bible the devil was like a walking bible but jesus could stand there and say the scripture said destroy this body but in three days i'll raise it up again that was not a theology walking like a bible that was a bible walking like a god oh come on church and right here tonight this is not a church full of a bunch of walking amen bibles by theology you are the bible that's eaten by revelation of the message of the hour we know who we are well brother ender i want victory figure out who you are come on church amen the days of playing church is over the days of dead church services is over the days of religious gatherings is over listen friends we're not fighting the devil amen that don't know who he is he knows who he is he knows where he come from you know why the devil's working so hard right now it's cause he realizes he's working up against the deadline he realizes right here tonight he's only got a little bit of time and he's wondering how much time he's got but there is a pride on the earth tonight who is walking under the divine favor of the opening of the word and we're not wondering how much more time we got we're not wondering how many more days to work we heard a prophet say we'll work until jesus comes we'll preach until jesus comes we'll sing until jesus comes we'll cast out devils until jesus comes we'll have prayer lines until jesus comes we'll pray for the sick and watch god heal him until jesus comes we'll preach this message until jesus comes because we know who we are hallelujah somebody give him some praise in here no i'm talking about the intelligence i'm talking about jesus has come in this age to identify you as not walking like a bible but as the walking bible it's identity crisis come on church can i preach to you for a second washington ain't the only place for to find itself right now hell's fortifying itself demons right now are four to find themselves you know why because they're finding out that there's a people in the last days that's not a part of this identity crisis the prophet said jesus just stood still for he knew where he was standing he knowed somebody shout node he know that he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he knowed aren't you thankful for a kentucky seventh grade hillbilly preacher that could say node so we would know what he was talking about when we heard what he was talking about we would note it brother andrew aren't you embarrassed there ain't a bit of shame in me to quote this prophet and say i knowed who i am i know what i believe i know who saved my soul i know who redeemed me from the pawn shop i knowed who sent this message i knowed who called my name under the revelation of them seven seals i knowed it hallelujah oh brother he that hath an ear let him hear he know that he was producing it he know that he was the word and it worked satan knew it by wisdom and it failed satan noted by theology and it failed he quoted the same word jesus quoted the same bible from the psalms he will give his angels charge concerning you lest at any time you dash your foot against the stone he said it's also written satan noted all by knowledge same way jesus knew his identity is the same way his bride knowed the same way jesus knowed his identity is the same way his bride knowed hers brother dale how do we note it he jesus knowed it by experience and he knowed it by revelation he know that he was the son of god that was to come in the world he knowed his standing he knowed he was born the world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of god can work through him because he knowed what he was oh and jesus knowed what he was he knowed where he was standing he know that the word was speaking of him he knew his identity he could identify himself in the time come on church you're realizing that you think we're living it in any crisis look at jesus day look how many boys was being raped to be raised to be identified as the messiah look how many girls was in it at any crisis because their daddy was trying to make them the womb that would bring forth the messiah that was prophesied by isaiah look at a time but there will always be a predestinated seed that will stand in the middle of an identity crisis and say but i know but i know but are you hearing me you remember the young boy there in john 9 his parents turned against him his own mom and daddy stood there and said we don't know about what this is done we don't know this is our son but we don't know what's happened to him but there was a boy there who knew who he was and he said but one thing i thing i know wherein i was blind now i see see jesus knowed his adversary and the bride knows hers who is that the devil then if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now the predestinated bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything that god promised in her amen right now is there everything is in order the holy spirit has been given the seed has been sown the evening launch has been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised is here and malachi 4 a predestinated church oh devil now can i give the devil a warning will you stay awake with me while i give the devil a prophetic warning how many likes warnings you like warnings well let's give the devil a prophetic warning church the living god hearing on take two do you know where you stand do you know that you were called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you oh brother how is satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following it why you could throw them in jail if you could i don't care what you do they done tried it they rotted in the jails they was fed the lines they were sawed asunder they were jerk to pieces you can't kill it it's a church that's predestinated you can't kill it it's a church that's predestinated are you hearing me amen the devil better hear me tonight he might as well quit wasting his time he's not going to kill word of life tabernacle he's not going to kill grace tabernacle he's not going to kill christian assembly why it's a predestinated church god it just turns on inside of me those he for knew like he did jesus he is called those he is called he is justified though he is justified he's already glorified predestinated somebody shout predestinated predestinate it and now in the last days with every seat shown everything in order the world and its order the time shaped up in the church in its order the seed the evening lies the signs like he said as it was in the days of sodom performing the signs coming down moving performing the signs malachi 4 is here amen hey man where is here amen amen i'm reading prophets amen he got happy amen do you love him amen sure right here in the last days a predestinated church knowing where they're standing sowed with the seed the holy spirit in the church are you ready satan be careful satan oh come on church satan be careful you're not dealing with just a church you're not dealing with theology you're not dealing with wisdom you're not dealing with knowledge you are dealing with a word seed bride that has been sowed by the word of almighty god oh church are you hearing me satan be careful well brother andrew i'm a young person satan be careful real brother i'm growing cold satan be careful well by the end of the devil's destroying my mind satan be careful you hear me satan be careful because you can push and you can push and you can push until it looks like you pushed this church down it looks like you pushed my mind down until it looks like you pushed my body down come on church it looks like you pushed my family down but then comes the sun then comes the rain then comes the power then comes the dynamics and begins to strike that seed that is laying inside of my soul come on church take the breaks off and preach it ain't but 7 30. surely you didn't come and leave it on your mind did you are you with me amen has the devil pushed on you brother has the devil pushed on you brother he's pushed on you but you know what he does he pushes and he pushes and he pushes and he pushes and he drives and he drives and he hurts and he hurts and he cuts and he cuts until it comes to a point you look like you're going to quit you look like you're going to throw up your hands and walk away because you can't take another wound you can't take another cut you can't take another hurt but then you get in the presence of the sun [Applause] then you get in the presence of the sun and all of a sudden something begins to stir in your soul something begins to move something begins to pulsate what is it church it's your identification quickening you [Music] [Applause] church the devil's tried but he's lost the battle brother david he's tried but he's defeated brother josiah's tried but he's cut down tonight the church is victorious come on church i think somebody needs to testify the devil right now i'm still here i'm still standing i still believe a message i still believe in the holy ghost i still believe in a body change i still believe in a theophany i still believe in a future home i still believe in the millennium i still believe he's the same yesterday today and forever i still believe if god be for us then who can be against us i still believe if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and seek my face and begin to pray then when i hear from heaven and i'll forgive their sin and i'll heal their land and i'll open the witness of heaven and quicken my seed in a time of identity crisis [Applause] i lost my mind i know exactly where i'm standing i'm looking at people tonight the devil's done everything to destroy you but you're still here you're still standing you're still worshiping why because you know who you are well brother i don't know who i am come on how much more can be done than what's already been done to identify you are who you are yeah come on come on come on church we didn't come here just to have a social gathering we would come to have church [Applause] devil done everything he can everything possible to destroy the church living stone everything at it but there's something in us that we just get back up again are you hearing me oh brother brother ben you ever seen them on things down there at the car dealership they blow around they ain't got no bones they ain't got no spines they just they're just a bunch of hot air you just hook them up to some hot air and they just blow around and jump around and so oh god then somebody come by and just take their hand and hit them barely and they fall over and give up but you know what i like about it they stand right back up are you hearing me you knock them down but they stand right back up i don't think the devil realizes who he's in the ring with tonight he thinks he's in the ring with a bunch of young men and a bunch of young girls and a bunch of preachers and a bunch of housewives and a bunch of fathers but let me tell that devil tonight he's in for a rude awakening because if you got the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul he's back in the ring with jesus christ himself again [Applause] brother the devil's back in the ring again you say well brother andrew is jesus going to come down and knock him out know you're going to amen it's not you swinging your hand it's jesus in that fist it's not you kicking your foot it's jesus and that foot what's he done church jesus christ has come down in this last days and claimed another human body that was sex born and sinned sheep and iniquity and he's defeating the devil again through human flesh on the earth oh brother andrew you seem all fired up about this i am i am you say what's wrong with you i'm mad what are you mad at i'm mad at the devil he's beating the church down he's took our praise he's took our song he's took our joy come on church amen well let's preach we're here shouldn't we amen he's got the church to quiet now if somebody says amen everybody thinks they're breaking out in a spasm come on if somebody danced in the spirit they think somebody's lost their mind they mean somebody get happy and god forbid they even shout or dance the aisles amen but you know what my prophet said jesus started his church out on the day of pentecost and the way he started it is the way he's gonna end it and he didn't start it with a bunch of cold formal dried confessions and a bunch of theology he started his church out on fire and i heard a prophet say i am inclined to believe that the same elijah fire that wrapped up elijah will return in this last stage the fire of god will pick the church up off the earth there's somebody nude somebody next to you say give me some room give me some room what you need some room for been a long time since you spread your wings eagle it's been a long time since you really got in church been a long time since you just let go and let god have his way come on church we we oh can i preach a minute brother ben it's coveted nonsense that's about drove everybody crazy hating it amen people say well we can't shout because we might spread covet and we can't wave our hands cause we might wave the air and spread covet and we can't dance the isles because we might talk is it devil are you saying brother andrew what are you saying i'm not saying be ignorant i'm seeing use wisdom but i think it's time we stop using excuses when it comes to praising god before covet come before comet come we have people that miss church if a flea flew in their house they missed church if they broke a fingernail well kovy just gave them people a chance to perfect what they had been practicing for years come on but you know what covert did to me it gave me a chance to perfect who i am you know what i'm talking about because i'm a worshiper i'm a praiser amen amen are you with me church everything i've been through i'm still a worshiper everything i faced i'm still a praiser on my dark days i still got a song on my sunny days i still got to shout when the walls are tall i still believe in a jericho fallen anointing are you hearing me amen i still believe in praising god when the odds are against you i still believe in worshiping god when you ain't got one thing to worship him for what he's saying i'm saying cover to give people a chance to perfect who they were and it gave me a chance to perfect who i am no matter what the devil posed in the church we're still going on whether we do it we're perfecting perseverance no matter how the devil tries to divide us we still unite ourselves together what are we doing we're perfecting unity come on church amen no matter what the devil does to stop us we still push through it why because there's a seed on the inside of our heart that must come to life now let me say it like this and i'm going to hurry here but i want to leave here for a second because a lot of people think well we just get through this covet and brother david the end time pandemic's over but actually there's really actually a there's a natural pandemic we we believe it's real we're not all right we're not saying it's not real don't wad up on me we ain't saying ain't real we we believe it's real but we still believe god's real yeah but you know what we got people that look oh come on preach me brother god take care take some liberty here we got people man i saw a guy the other day i was checking in the hotel i went in i wore my mask i went in i did what they told me to do there was a couple come in behind me bless his heart he had two masks on a big old head a big old head shield i mean the thing was wrapped around his head locked on both sides and big old arm gloves i wore them things gutting deer not checking in a hotel i mean things that i thought my you know they're going to ever extreme possible to avoid this natural end time pandemic but do you realize there's a spiritual pandemic you know what it's called it's called spiritual amnesia it's called spiritual amnesia you say what is amnesia we're told it's caused you to get to a place where you cannot identify yourself it's a it's a mercy it's an unusual thing he said but the cause is the cause is three different things one is from shock you know what he said somebody gets shocked he said they go through a war sometimes and soldiers get it you know what happens they get in a shock and they forget who they are they forget who their family is they forget what country they come from shock causes spirits and you know another thing that causes it is worry [Music] the prophet said another thing causes it is worry worry has no virtue in it all yeah just skip worry and accept faith spiritual amnesia is caused by a shock caused by a shock caused by worry but you know the third thing brother harvey that spiritual amnesia caused by brotherhood says is getting between two opinions yes sir that'll cause amnesia you lost your reasons you lost your mind you don't know who you are and you cannot identify yourself you can walk around eating everything but still you can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education the same education you had before but you don't know where it comes from and you don't know who you are where you are or where you belong that's amnesia now look in first kings 18 21 the bible says elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him notice here the problem i love this the prominent discernment in the case he actually deals with a woman halting between two opinions he said how do you do do you believe with all your heart you do you're in trouble you're not sick only you're nervous you're upset it's a mental distress like because you're you're halting between two opinions what you must do in life yours is not a sickness you have a child don't you a boy you're having family trouble at home isn't that right you don't want a divorce in your family you don't know what to do and you're not from the city you come from michigan is that right now you believe with all your hearts god will grant you your request there's only one thing you can do that's believe on the lord thank the lord only one thing you can do is believe on the lord and i'd advise you one thing to do go he says receive the baptismal spirit live for god all your life and everything will just work right now if god can tell me what's your trouble and what is your trouble now he can surely tell me the way out of it is that right that's your avenue will you receive it come here lord be merciful this woman he says grant unto her that she may receive the holy spirit may all of her troubles leave granted father i bless her for this purpose in jesus christ's name that the baby be raised in a christian atmosphere both father and mother filled with the spirit grant it lord now your husband isn't with you when you go home i trust god you'll find it different are you ready to believe you will listen here now as you believe i know he does it but i say this you're going to be better yeah you believe that he says i believe as you believe that's just what being you amen can i give you another here a person suffering with heart trouble where him comes in a prayer line a person struck with heart trouble he says here's your problem your halt between two opinions you want to serve god but you know i'm paraphrasing but you don't know what to do he said but will you sell out and serve god he said then go your way are you hearing me church listen amnesia causes people not to be able to remember yeah no can i have a few minutes here and i'll close he said we were identified with our families in this human life by marriage with our wives our family he said what if this horrible thing would happen to you and you wouldn't be able to remember who you married who's your wife which is your children who is your father mother who is your neighbor that would be a horrible thing then we are identified again and can identify ourselves in the human race by having intelligence and being different from the animal life but we're animal life what makes us different we're mammal but what makes us different we're identified by having a soul [Music] we're identified as having a soul a conscience that tells us what's right and what's wrong see church we've been halt between opini you say that brother andrew why are you why are you preaching because i'm coming to a close but i want to say this i'm tired of seeing the devil wreaking havoc in people's minds wreaking havoc in people's homes destroying their nerves destroying their mental condition it's time church we raise up it's time we raise up and remember who we are remember whose we are remember what we believe the prophet said nebuchadnezzar forgot one time he was human being he forgot he was human being he says and we forget sometimes what the christian church is he said what happens is you get amnesia and you receive a heart for the world come on preach come on but brother ben it amazes me samuel said to saul now it's done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord which he command thee for now the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath saw him a man what's that say after his own heart come on so david wasn't wondering who he was come on preach david was identified as god's kind when he had removed him he raised up on them david to be their kingdom also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man yeah after my own heart come on now i mean tonight can say lord i know the world is an identity crisis but i don't want to be like saul come on come on i don't want to lose my identity and take on the identity of the preach world on when a man gets holy spirit he acts crazy anyhow but he's only acting that to the people of the world he's only crazy to the people who don't know who they are are you hearing me see i hope i'm not holding too long a person shouting in the spirit is only strange to somebody who don't know who they are a person rejoicing is only strange to somebody because they don't know who they are but when a person is rejoicing it's because they know who they are see the prophet said look at this he said when a man gets holy spirit acts crazy but he's only acting that people the world look at david when he danced around the ark and his wife sit up there and said you embarrass me and god looked down at heaven said david thou art a man after my own heart now it depends on whose heart that you belong to if you belong to the heart of the world you'll act like the world but if you belong to the heart of god you'll do things the world knows nothing about the lord israel forgot who they were they forgot where they come from they forgot all that grace had provided the prophet said so as god's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a christian means they can't identify themselves they forgot all about it they forgot his holiness that forgot his law the women were living like the rest of the world he said oh israel forgot all the laws of god they wanted a king over them like the rest of the world when the world and the church joins together they don't want nothing spiritual now the prophet identifies and i'm close right here he parallels israel's with this day yeah you know how israel was paralleled to this day i'm slowing down here for a reason yeah cause i won't drive this home is they couldn't identify themselves with supernatural things that's true they couldn't well brother says they could not identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it the word the gospel sin disease had afflicted them and they loved it sin is pleasant to the unconverted heart it looks good the unconverted mind but it's the ways of death the spiritual signs the preaching of an ordained messenger from god never stirred them anymore the women could laugh right in their face and say i don't have to go hear such a stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual amnesia exactly they have forgotten that god and his word is the same come on preach come on come on that's right you know what spiritual amnesia does i'm just gonna borrow a few minutes here i'm not gonna ask i'm gonna take it that's good spiritual amnesia makes people get to a spot they have no feeling inside of them yes it does come on the prophet said if it probably rose on the scene in this days that's what spiritual amnesia does gets to spot where they have no feeling on the inside of them take a real spiritual meeting where the holy spirit is healing the sick discerning the thoughts that's in the heart put it among all the churches just a great rally out here the stadium look what happened in a few minutes everybody get up and walk out they have nothing to do with it they don't want nothing to do with it they'll listen to some intellectual talk they have no feeling inside of them the power of the spirit comes down i'm just gonna rehearse these to you he said the power of jesus christ and his resurrection and the holy ghost they want nothing to do with it because it condemns them no chastisement of course is pleasant for the season but if you yield to it it'll bring forth the fruits of repentance are we are we are we are we slip into an identity crisis the prophet said you must be identified your life shows tonight you're not halfway halting between two opinions there's no such thing you're either saved or you're not saved and your spirit you're either sinner or saint you're or the other and your spiritual attitude towards god's word identifies exactly where you're standing and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not well brother andrew i'm a deacon and i'm a preacher well the prophet of god said that's no matter whether if you're a deacon or even if you're a preacher they get it too that's right so we find out it's contagious to the whole thing can i can i step out of the limb here and say something i believe spiritual amnesia spreads a lot more faster than covert 19 does it takes about 7 to 14 days now if a church has got it or somebody family's got it but it only takes about one or two minutes in the surface to see if a church has got it the word begins to be preached well i've heard that before and well i don't know my brother ben's preached that and i've heard this come on church have we got it tonight i wonder tonight in closing as our musicians come have we let spiritual amnesia slip in our churches slip in our homes sipping on our fa and our families i'll tell you one thing america's done is let amnesia slip in on it forgot what our forefathers fought for forgot what men and women left their homes and families and fought for and shed their blood for come on a country going down the drain which we know these things must happen because amnesia set in yeah brother david is sitting at the highest at the highest place it could come out of the government into the churches and into the into the political the world's amnesia tonight the prophet said to be an american i must be a citizen born in this country and identify with this nation as an american whatever it is i am because i am identified with it i'm identified with its shame and its glory church i wonder tonight the prophet god says all that he was i'm identified with him he said all america was i'm identified with her shame and her glory plymouth rock i'm identified with it i see delaware i'm identified with it hoisted up the flag on guam i'm identified with it right iraq i'm identified with it we're identified with it we realize that but what about the church he says to be a christian you've got to be identified with him and i'm identified with him we were with abraham at the age of 75 and sarah 65 when they were told they were going to have a baby and abraham took a stand upon thus saith the lord i was with abraham when his temptations come went on top of the mountain to offer up isaac when the ram appeared i was with joseph when he was rejected of his brothers because he was spiritual the rest of them was carnal we were with jacob when he wrestled with the angel we were with moses at the burning bush when he went down in egypt when all the people turned against him and he crossed the red sea we were with elijah in the days of ahab on mount carmel when they had the truth between god or balaam we were with the hebrew children the fiery furnace when the fire couldn't burn them because the press is the fourth man we with danny on the lion's den when the angel lord identify with him in there we were most surely with jesus with him at calvary die with him raise them on easter morning with him in the resurrection now church we all identify with that but the prophet of god says and now i am seated with him in heavenly places in christ jesus with all the powers of hell conquered through him every christian believer was seated the same way because you have to be identified let's stand our feet tonight how many can say tonight lord keep me from this spiritual plague of amnesia friends it swept in on preachers they used to preach this message now they sit make videos swept in on preachers that used to used to cry and weep and shout holler brother brown was a prophet now they don't know if he was a prophet or god's god amnesia amnesia friends if it'll sleep in on a preacher or a deacon yeah i know it'll try to sweep it on a young person yes it will i know it'll try to sweep in a family and get them between two opinions but when you know who you are and you've been sprayed with the repellent predestination the devil can swarm he can buzz he can but he don't have a stinger how many can say tonight i know who i am i know what i believe i know i've been through some hard times i know i've been through some disappointing times i know the devil's cut and cut and cut and punched and hit come on but i'm still here i'm not here by theology you say brother andrew what are you talking about i told church back home in the day brother sean was pretty having meeting there i was preaching on sunday i said we've come to place they could if they shut the church down we'll go preach under under a tree somewhere burn the bill down the church will still be here we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're going you love him this evening amen let's bow our hearts together friends amnesia is a real thing spiritual amnesia [Music] is just as real tonight as natural amnesia

opinions [Music] how many can say tonight my home is sold out to this message my family is sold out to this message brother harvey our future is sold out to this message we're not halting between opinions we're not halting between what is the absolute and what is not what we follow and what do we not all know we've come the middle of the road church the prophet said spiritual amnesia causes a christian to lose their balance if i could say anything to you tonight if you're halt between two opinions won't you run won't you run to the other side won't you cross the line tonight won't you
