tonight we pray in Jesus name amen thank the Lord amen don't you love the Lord tonight let's turn to acts chap 10 verse 42 I want to add my condolences to those that have already been expressed for the family of sister Jackson sister Carol was always kind to to me and my wife and I cter brother Truman as a friend and and uh he was just a fixture here at the church for so many years and uh so I'm sure that'll be a great loss to them and especially to Sister Vicky and brother Glenn and the family I want to say we're pulling for you and pray and for you and believing the Lord will just comfort you in the time of loss and we'll let you know just as soon as we hear about arrangements for sister Carol I always want to honor those who have worked in the church because every person that's been a part of the church over the years has made uh made up the fabric of what the church is today and I believe thinking back at times when brother trumman was here and sister Carol it uh really makes me think that that uh that still lives on that Legacy lives on and and they were hospitable to us and we always want to be to other people and treat them right and I believe there will be a reward for that sister Jackson's in a better place tonight and we're just believing that we're all going to be there one of these days we're trusting that amen let's go back to Acts chapter 10 verse 42 this is Peter speaking to those in cornelius's house says he commanded us to preach unto the people notice what it says and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick that's alive and dead to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins and while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word I pray that would be the case tonight the word is being preached preached you may have your seats God bless you tonight I want to speak to you tonight on case dismissed with prejudice case dismissed with prejudice Prejudice in criminal law is not the same as uh being racist or something like that but it actually means a final decision that's not subject to Future inquiry a final decision that's not subject to future inquiry if the judge announces a case is dismissed but then he says with prejudice it means it can never be brought again and I believe tonight just to say it up FR that our sins have been dismissed that the case against us has been dismissed with prejudice in other words it can never be brought back again it's put in the sea of his forgetfulness and it can never be fished out again and and what it means in criminal law is that is that the prosecutor must make an extremely strong case uh against the person that he is accusing before it can be brought so they'll go and search out everything and make sure that they know exactly what the person did and they'll go out and and uh and tie up get all kinds of witnesses and all kinds of material evidence because they want to make sure there's no reasonable doubt they have to prove Beyond a reasonable doubt that this person did what they said that they would do or what they said that they did in order for them to be convicted because it would be better for one uh for for uh uh all of the guilty to go free than for one innocent person to be found guilty and so and because of that they have to make a very strong case and I want to tell you tonight that the case against us was a strong case right it was not a weak case the the we we started sinning at the moment that we could if that if that makes sense right you say when when did you start sinning brother Ben the minute I could the minute I could make a decision to do wrong I did wrong the minute you could make a decision I know we all want to be Angels tonight and get little Halos and put over our heads but but we the minute we could make a wrong decision we made a wrong decision someone said well I always looked for God no you didn't look for God you were looking to do everything wrong I I am I was where I was by my free will but it was his grace that called me out of where I was and made me a Christian the case against us was strong when when Eve listened to Satan's lie and Adam went with her every child born after that was Guilty By Nature by nature and we all proved it as we grew up because as soon as we could we sinned and so and this is why Abel had to offer a blood sacrifice even though he was the right seed line he was the elect of God but yet he had to offer a blood sacrifice because of the fact even though the blood had not yet been mixed but because of the fact that he uh he when he come into the world because he come even with Adam and Eve under that relationship but it was wrong and so he had to offer a blood sacrifice because it was blood in the beginning and so every man born between a man and a woman no matter how good the man and woman is every person born between a man and a woman is a sinner the Bible tells us that the wicked are estranged from the womb in other words they they're separated from God from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies you say well that's the wicked well here's what David a man after God's Own Heart said he said behold I was shapen in iniquity in sin did my mother conceive me he said well I don't know I'm you know David Fell and he he did some things that were wrong maybe I wouldn't be quite that way but the Bible says all someone say all all have sinned and come short of the glory of God I think all fits most of us so we must come to Perfection we we believe that we must come to Perfection Paul tells us let it let us go on to Perfection and Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect we must come to Perfection we can't do that in ourselves we can't do that let me repeat that to you tonight I want you young people to understand this and I and I think some of us Elders you might say brother Ben this is pretty simplistic but I think it's important because we need to understand that we can't do that ourselves it must be a supernatural work of God in our life but the B said you legalist how could you ever perfect yourself when you have not one thing to perfect yourself with where would you find the building blocks of righteousness where would you find the ability to do the word of God to perform the word of God you don't have it there's no way you could do it only by the leadership of the Holy Ghost now he said you were born in sin your very conception was in sin the very desire of you being here with sin born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies now where are you going to stand at where are you sinner that said I'll quit smoking and I'll go to heaven right that's good thing to quit smoking but that won't make you go to heaven you can wear a patch and do that you can't wear a patch to get into heaven right where where are you lukewarm mossback so-called Christian that goes around here with a long face and saying well I belong to the church he said you sinner that's right unless you're born of the spirit of God you're lost right he said that's true how you going to go to heaven you say I never lied in my life oh the darling it was just an angel to begin with he said that's a lie I know you kids are good kids but you weren't an angel you were a human being even Joel's kids are human huh even my kids are human even your kids are human beings and brother Brandon said if I never had an evil thought in my life if I never spoke a bad word in my life if I never looked at anything evil never thought anything evil do you know how remarkable that would be to be a person who never thought anything evil that'd be pretty remarkable wouldn't it you'd be a pretty good person if you'd never thought anything evil but you even if you had never had an evil thought now this is a Biblical principle if you never had an evil thought he said I'm just as Rank and black as the smudy walls of hell I'm a sinner on now I'm a sinner that's what Paul means when he says all have sinned and that debt had to be paid so that was the case against us but we don't want to dwell on that tonight because I think we can all just pretty much say we're guilty right but what's the case for us now you say well there is no case for The Sinner but that's actually not true when it comes to to the elect because our attorney is Jesus Christ the prosecutor is Satan and so if you could think of the Throne of God as a as a as a courtroom you'd find that the the judge is there and the prosecutor and the attorney and the attorney is Jesus Christ and the uh prosecutor is Satan now in our attorney has alleged misconduct on the part of the prosecutor do you know that he has alleged that the prosecutor has has been involved in Entrapment right you know what that is it's when the law the law cannot go out of their way to make you do something illegal so that they can then trap you in that so he says that's what this this prosecutor has done look at Revelation CH 12 Revelation 12:7 it says there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not oh I love that you know we might lose our loved one to cancer but the dragon did not Prevail in the end he was cast out you might you might have a temporary falling or failing you might temporarily lose a battle but in the end we win the war aren't you glad of that prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out on the earth and his angels were cast out with him now notice if if our attorney was making a case he would say now there's been a case of entrapment and the thing is that this attorney this prosecuting attorney has disguised himself in many different ways but if you go back to that ninth verse look what he says he said that great Dragon was cast out so he was he was in the form of a great Dragon he was that old serpent what serpent the one that talked to Eve yeah right called the devil yeah right now look how many ways he identifies him and Satan which deceiveth the whole world so he identifies him in in four or five different ways and says I want you to understand that he's all the same person and there's a reason for that because if he's the same person that did the deceiving what's he doing here in the courtroom doing the accusing right right how can you be here how can you stand here devil and accuse God's Children of doing something wrong when you were the one that trapped them into doing something wrong in the first place so the prosecutor I'm going somewhere with this tonight the prosecutor is alleging that or the the defendant is alleging our attorney is alleging that the prosecutor mishandled the case oh my now now look and he said so this great Dragon the devil the serpent Satan and his angels were cast out with him in verse 10 says I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser sir now there's another name so who is the accuser of the Brethren the same one come on who got Eve in trouble yes the same one who got you in trouble right the same one who convinced you someone said the devil make you rob the store and then and then call the police on you right and the same one that convinced Satan or the convinced you to do wrong the same one who who pulled you and and made you what you were the same one who caused Eve to fall is the same one who is the accuser of the Brethren now that's that's important which accused them before our God day and night this is the same guy who deceived the third of the angels in heaven who is deceived and disrupted human race ever since but one day he got a hold of a man that had a little bit more about him than even Moses or Adam or any of those men did but he got a hold of someone named Jesus Christ our attorney and he did not deceive our attorney are you with me now I know it's simple but it's just what's on my heart tonight he did not deceive our attorney what did he do he said it's also written because our attorney knew the law he was the law he was the prophets he knew the law but he said it's also written he did not deceive I'm so glad of that tonight he did not deceive our attorney but he overcame him by the word the same way that you and I can tonight and so and so our attorney begins to tell us a story and he said these these these people are like eagles an eagle that was picked up by a farmer you You' all heard the story and and he was put in a chicken pin and hatched under a chicken but he was an eagle to begin with and his mama knew that he was that she was missing uh one of her eggs and so she went looking for him and one day he heard the voice of something that he never heard before now this little Eagle realized as he grew that something was wrong with the condition that he was in but you can't accuse the eagle all right come on yeah are you with me now you can't accuse him for being in a chicken pin you realize brother brandom tells us you don't he said don't get mad at the cner for being a sinner that's just what he is right but he needs a savior we shouldn't look down our noses at people for being what they are that's just what they are but we needed a savior and there was an eagle that come by one day and we heard a scream and we begin to get uncomfortable in our life and the way that we lived and we begin get uncomfortable with who we were and one day we heard the voice of the message of the hour and it spoke directly to our hearts and when it did what happened we were trapped in a chicken pin yes sir but we were an eagle to begin with yes Hallelujah and brother Brandon said this Eagle knew something was wrong he said there is something wrong that's right but you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning right notice the language that he uses you were trapped into it at the beginning see you were part to use another analogy of an arranged marriage huh you were part of an arranged marriage you were born in sin you come into the world and you were already married to the world and brother Rand said that's the reason the divorce when you divorced because you were trapped into it see by your first parents Adam and Eve you become a sinner by Nature by Nature you didn't want to be but now you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by hearing Revelation comes by hearing you realize you don't have to choose to be a sinner right I know some people think well you know I I'll just stay neutral I won't choose to be a sinner and I won't choose to be a Christian I'll just stay neutral that's not how it works you already are a sinner you need a savior I already was a sinner I needed a savior I needed I needed somebody to come by and plead my case and so he said you become a sinner by Nature you didn't want to be but now you heard the gospel and faith comes by hearing Revelation comes by hearing there's a little something inside of you again he said dear God the word has gone forth he was praying here he said it cannot return void it'll find its place somewhere if the seed has already been planted it'll water it till it grows and none can pluck it from your hand all someone say all all the father has given me will come to me and no man can pluck them out of my hand my father has given them to me before the foundation of the world I love this when the plans were all draw up as so Jesus was given his church his bride so you were given to Christ oh my as a bride before the beginning of time yeah how could you be lost right I know that's hard for people to swallow because you want to have something to do with that but you didn't have anything to do with that I didn't have anything to do with that all I have to do is respond to it say Lord I love you I thank you for doing it look what he says the bogus marriage of the world now watch the terms he's using because I believe God's trying to tell us something he said you were trapped into it it was a bogus marriage right a bogus marriage to these denominations he said you came and died into the world you redeemed her you Justified her she never did it at the first place she was trapped into it blind so you can see the misconduct of the prosecutor said you caused it you you you're the one that tricked her into this marriage now you're trying to tell her she can't get out of it but the old husband's dead he amen again he said but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sinned in the first place why she was for ordained she was trapped into this come on now I know you say brother Ben that sounds like an excuse it is but you only get to hear it one time or to use it one time and that's when you hear the gospel if you turn down the gospel you don't get to use the excuse you were trapped into it again because now you've heard it but if you heard the gospel and you responded to the gospel you can say I was trapped into it but when I heard the eagle scream then I came to it so I was trapped into it now look he said he said she never done it in the first place she was trapped in this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her she stands there virtuous see she know sin on her and at all right no sin on her at all brother B makes it very clear and if you if you have a difficult time understanding this go back to the Hebrews series The Brand preaches a series uh called the Hebrews series he preach it's Hebrews chapter 1 and then chapter two and on down through the end of Hebrews and and when he preaches that series he deals extensively with his church and with Pentecostal people dealing with the idea of Grace and and what God is and how you can't be lost and what it means to be elected by God and it's very important for us as Believers to understand it because he talked about in that sermon about perfection because because Paul says let's go on to Perfection and how can we go on to Perfection and he says Perfection is Jesus Christ Perfection is Christ he's the only thing that's ever perfect so we're not going to find anything perfect so when we say let us go on to Perfection what are we going into we're going to Christ the word that's what we come to we cannot be perfect in our own righteousness we must be perfect through Christ so he said it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come a perfect Kingdom now I you know I don't think well I know we don't I know we don't understand Perfection because we've never experienced exped it right Perfection to you you might this morning I think someone said it was a perfect morning but not exactly it was perfect but you got another day older the weather was nice but it's not exactly perfect but it was perfect for us because we don't really understand Perfection I don't think we would and forgive me for this but I think I don't think we look at it right and and and we can't because we're human beings we can only look at it things limited by time but if we knew how perfect it was number one we would we would reckon that our lives here were just a blip on the radar and we would understand that that that that that death ain't no big deal because we're going to a perfect place so perfect for us individually that we'll never want anything anymore we'll never have that longing or that desire for anything else other than that place oh that's the place I want to go to that's why we preach that's why we have church that's why we we give our all to God that's why we raise that's why we do what we do why there's a place there's a perfect place out there no matter what you're struggling with now there's a place of perfection that you can come to but we don't understand perfect because we're not perfect and yet he says the Bible said to come to that perfect place he said be therefore perfect you had to be perfect to get there it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God oh thank you Lord which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in yes sir she stands perfect sir oh how by the blood yes she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it yes so we've heard from the prosecutor and I think we all hear the voice of the prosecutor from time to time accusing us don't we we've heard the accusation of the prosecutor you've heard the response of our attorney now the judge has to make a decision you see it's all up to him whether we live or whether we die but in this hour we had to learn the true identity not only of the accuser but also of the judge see the scripture is very clear that the Messiah will be the judge of the earth go to Isaiah 16:5 it says in Mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it who who is he the Messiah right shall sit on it in Truth in the Tabernacle of David judging and seeking judgment and Hasting righteousness acts 10:42 which we read he commanded us to preach unto the people like that he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead acts 17:31 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world he will judge who will Christ will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained where whereof Heath given Assurance unto all men that Heath raised him from the dead Revelation 1911 I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him who was he right that's Christ isn't it that comes back on a white horse he said he's called faithful and true and in righteousness what does he do he does judge and make war John 5:22 Jesus says it plainly for the father judgeth no man but has committed all all judgment someone say all judgment to the son every judgment is his to make I want you to understand this church to go to hell he would have to condemn you right every judgment is his to make I just love this and in our room drama you know as a young boy often thought of the father as sitting there and the son is coming up to the father and he's pleading the case to the father but we found out by the message of the hour I think what's important in this age that we learn this we get this Revelation that they're the same person right it's not two separate people church it's the same person and so the one that gets to make the final decision and he's the only one yeah right your parents can't make it right you can't you can't even make the decision someone else can't make it the one that gets to make the final decision on whether or not your sins would be dismissed would be him yeah it would be the son it would be him and his not just God but God as Jesus Christ does that make sense God revealed in his son so the the judge has scars in his hands could I say it that way the judge has blood oh my that he is offered for the defendant yeah you talk about a rigged Court the judge the only one who gets to say and and even trinitarians will tell you which it creates a problem for Trin Arians because they do not understand why uh why Jesus gets to do everything now in trinitarian Dogma now think about this the father does nothing because the Bible's very clear the son created the world Christ created the world they look at that as a separate person the Bible's very clear that he's the judge right he's the one coming back he's the one who sits on the throne he's the one we worship and so in trinitarian theology the father doesn't do anything because he commits everything to the son and so he's literally a person with no job that's right he absolutely has no job and then they have the Holy Spirit with no body so you got one here's a man with no job and a spirit with no body and and and Christ is doing everything but that's not what we believe we believe that it's God revealed or manifested in three different offices three different manifestations so what happened now he is the judge now remember that he is the judge and we know that when in this age we know this age has been judged are you still with me tonight I I I've been sick so I'm carrying this thing I usually use a Baptist microphone but using this one tonight because I've been sick and I'm just trying to talk to you much as I can but this this gets me excited he is the judge that's important to remember and but yet in this age he made a judgment on this age and in fact he indicted this generation right and he used a prophet to do that now you can get into it brother brandom talks about prophecy he said whatever the judge says the attorney the prophet just takes what the judge says or what the judge thinks and tells it to the people so the the prophet is an attorney for the judge right he's an attorney for the judge Jud so when he come to this age and indicted the age he did it through a prophet listen to what brother brandom says it's very stirring he says I stand in his defense right I'm his attorney he said and I indict you by the word of God right change your ways or you'll go to hell that's pretty harsh isn't it but it's the truth he's speaking to denominations down change your ways or you go to hell your denominations will crumble he said I indict you in the Pres presence of the judge huh the one who was there to make a decision he said I indict you in the presence of the judge right he said you with your forms of godliness hypocrisies and why do you call it he said ain't one Calvary enough ain't one Calvary what did they do they crucified him aresh ain't one Calvary enough but notice what he did he used his Prophet to do that his Prophet spoke an indictment oh Church he let his Prophet represent him to the denominations to indict them as a prosecutor but when it came time to be our attorney all right come on he didn't send a prophet to be our attorney right he sent a prophet to be his attorney to represent him to an age but he sent to be our attorney he didn't just represent himself through a prophet but he had to come down himself he had to come into our our age sir oh my no wonder brother BR said my Ministry is to to say he's here right now look at it it's always been that way John represented God's judgment on the Pharisees on Herod but Christ represented God's grace to those who would believe John 1:17 the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ see the judge and the attorney had to be the same person the attorney could not be the prophet even though the prophet was God's representative God's attorney to the world but the attorney could not be the prophet the attorney had to be Christ himself yes now brother Brandon presents this this idea he said what if youd committed a crime worthy of death he said you knew you were guilty and you must die if you don't get some attorney to represent you that that can get you out of the thing and you can imagine what that must feel like because you got to feel guilty because you did it all right but yet you don't want to die right I did it but I don't want to die for it I don't believe I should die and so now you want the best attorney you could have he said and then getting an attorney that was a good shrewd attorney you would feel that you could relax a little bit because you had an attorney but still there would be a question whether this attorney could change the judge's idea see if you're trying to approach the father through another person yes sir you would always have a question can they change the father's mind can they change the judge's mind right that's what he's telling us there would be a question whether this attorney could change the judge's idea or change the jury if this attorney with his shrewd speaking and the knowing of the laws could change that and could plead your case and prove that you should live listen if you're trying to live vicariously through a pastor trying to live through somebody else trying to live through a church it'll never work you've got to speak directly to the judge because he is your attorney right amen he said yet in all of his great Authority and the great speech he could make and the impression he could put upon the jury or have with the judge maybe you might get relaxed for a few minutes but still there would be a question in your mind can he do it he said well he's got an unbroken record so far well my case is pretty bad I actually did it and the law says I should die but is my attorney good enough oh my that's the question church and your confidence in your attorney will be your outlook on life and whether or not you can have the faith to to believe and live a Christian Life be whether you have confidence or not in your attorney you see there would be a question with the attorney he said but in this case amen the case we're talking about tonight the case between you and God huh the judge himself becomes our attorney God became man there was no attorney could do it we couldn't find one Moses and the law the prophets nothing could do it so the judge become both jury attorney and judge himself and took the justice of his in his own hands and paid the price of it himself how much more secure could we be can you imagine how you how you would feel if you went to court and you found out the judge paid your bail all right I heard about this judge this guy this guy came before him and and and they said he said what's his crime he said well he stole a loaf of bread and uh and he said uh he saidwell how much was the loaf of bread worth He said 50 cents he said okay I'll find you 50 cents and then so the man come and he paid us or or the judge said but he said I'm not going to make you pay it he said I'm going to pay it so he pays the 50 cents and then he says I got another statement to make he said I'm gonna find everybody else in the courtroom 50 cents a piece for living in a city that would make a man steal to feed his family judge can do stuff like that what if the judge in your case if you saw him down at the window paying your bail you could you'd have a pretty good idea oh Church you'd have a pretty good idea that you were going to make it a pretty good idea he wasn't going to lose you you weren't going to lose that case because he's already stepped in weighed in in your favor don't you realize the judge has already weighed in in your favor what did he do the judge became both jury attorney and judge himself and took the justice of his law in his own hands and paid the price of it himself how much more secure could we be send his own life back upon us as a witness he'd accepted how safely the said would' be like David Walking In the Valley of the shadow of death he said I fear no evil for thou art with me when he becomes both judge jury and attorney he pleaded our case we found guilty by his own law he come and took the guilty person's place was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and died paid the price and shed his blood and give back his own token his own life he said why we are perfectly listen the case is dismissed glory to God there's no more sin to the believer yes oh God have mercy I I've had people ask me I've dealt with this several times because I think it's important I've had people tell me say well I believe God's punishing me for doing something how could he how could he punish you for what he doesn't see himself come on he'll correct you he'll he'll let you go through some things he'll he'll bring you through fire sometimes just for your character building job didn't do nothing wrong and God still brought him through through the fire but he brought him through when he got done he had twice as much as when he went in but what was it he was just building his character he was showing him who he was he wasn't punishing his son he's not punishing you right the case has been dismissed and it's been dismissed with prejudice it can't ever be brought again quit letting the devil beat you up for what you done yes sir said brother Ben you always preach as people do whatever they want to I want people to do whatever they want to sir just if you're a Christian you want to do what's right brother brandom said that if you he said if you only go to church because he said if you only serve him because you want to you want to escape hell he said you're a fraud you're a hypocrite right well listen to the Hebrew series it's a strong we don't do it we don't we don't serve God to escape hell we serve God because there's been a revelation of Grace in our life we know he loved us from the beginning Amen brother B say why we are perfectly the case is dismissed there's no more sin to the believer he said oh God have mercy if the people can't see that there is no more case and he bases that on John 5:24 verily verily I say un you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life if you have everlasting life how do you lose that you can't shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death To Life there is the case case dismissed I didn't say that a prophet of God stood there and said that there is the case John 5:24 that's our attorney statement that's our judge's statement yes oh my there is the case case dismissed no more case to it than safely safely with the token applied When Death begins to Smite against the door out there it has no control that's why I said death ain't no big deal when you really understand what he's done for you why because death has no control over you spiritual death has no control and natural death has no control over the believer no wonder Paul can say oh death where is thy steam oh grave where is thy victory brother Brenham talked about death as the the bee of death that that that buzzed Around Jesus on the cross and it had a stinger in it he said and when it when it when it sunk that Stinger into the Flesh of Jesus Christ when it pulled it out it pulled the stinger out and the bee can still buzz but it can't sting no more look what he says I'm free tonight Hallelujah I'm so glad that I'm free the sting of death is gone how many you say Amen to that tonight death may come in but it may come and threaten me it'll threaten all of you yeah hey I got a 15-year-old that's learning to drive death threatens me every day actually I've got a 15-year-old and a 17y old y'all pray for us pray for the other drivers too some of y'all won't drive now for a month but death will threaten you it starts threatening you when you're about 39 I know well your life's about halfway over what do you think what are you going to do if you're going to do anything for the Lord as brother BR said you better do it now right none of us are promised tomorrow death may come and Buzz it may come and threaten me it may come to pull me away but like one writer said God harnessed it to a buggy it can only pull me in his presence where I long to be where every believer longs to be listen if this was the hour of the revealing of our Attorney judge he must be present in this day as a judge to dismiss the case yeah he's already paid the price he's been our attorney now he's our judge this is the hour when the head comes to the body the hour Perfection the case could only be continued under the blood of bulls and goats but now it's been dismissed never to be remembered again remember every time they'd offer a sacrifice it' put it off for another year right was just a continuance but now the judge has said it's dismissed never to be remembered again right remember and I I don't have the the picture on my Sid so I don't think but remember when he come uh he showed his brother Wendell dealt with it over the meetings but he showed himself as the cloud in the form of the cloud what was so significant about that he was wigged in the cloud he was wearing a white wig and in Revelation 1114 the Bible says this head and his hairs were white like wool white as snow and brother Brandon when he preached the seven Church ages he didn't understand that scripture because the prophet doesn't know everything until God reveals it to him and so he calls Jack Moore to ask him about it and Jack Moore told him he said well that uh that meant this or that and and he said well I just couldn't hardly believe that but he said he said I said he was a young man that's where the Revelation come he said about that being a wig on not him he's wigged he said he's young he's got a black beard he said but he was wigged he said I couldn't understand it as being Supreme deity he said but the old judges used to in Israel had to be whiteh headed and the white stands for Purity and the English judges to this day in Supreme Courts of England put on a white wig when they come out because there's no other law above theirs on Earth and they Supreme judge what does that mean church if he says it's dismissed it's over what happened in this age the judge had to be present to dismiss case I know some of you are thinking right now you as I'm closing in just a moment you say brother Ben I sinned again I come to the message and I messed up I come to church and I did good for a while but then I messed up let me talk to you for just a moment John wrote to his church of that first age and he said my little children these things right out unto you that you sin not if any man sin we have an advocate with the father that word advocate is a attorney we have an attorney with the father Jesus Christ the righteous you need to remember your judge is still your attorney he doesn't suddenly become two persons after you get saved and suddenly start judging you for the things that you do he don't do that the case of original sin cannot be brought again I hope you're hear me it can't be can't be brought again now we know that that our attorney that everyone he represents the judge declares pardon because he's the same person why would he work against himself right so Look what Jesus said when he was here John 17:9 he said I pray for them I pray not for the world but I pray for them which thou Hast given me for they are thine they belong to the judge and the attorney oh my all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them brother Bram said the believer can't sin this a strong meat tonight but I want you to brother Bram taught it over and over and over again certainly not the seed of God the blessings of God remains on him God can't see nothing but the blood of his own son no matter what's in what is in his church what it is God don't see it because Jesus is making intercession constantly the high priest no way for him to sin so all them complaints you make to God oh God did you see what brother so and so did to me well they're a real True Believer God don't see it right all that complaining we do might make us feel better but God don't even see it I love brother brandom when he was talking about he he said he was out in the woods praying out by his cave when he got the revelation of of uh of the wheat and the tears but he said the reason he was out there praying is because Dr Davis had said some awful things about him in in the paper that's why he was out there praying he said I was praying that God would forgive him yeah all right oh my I believe that's the way we ought to be Oh my he said there's no way he said no matter what it is in the church no way for him to sin when such a sacrifice is laying there for him certainly not now if you say well that gives me a good chance he said that shows you're not right he said you'll appreciate that you'll love it if you're a real Christian to a place that sin would haunt you till you couldn't do it for the seed of God remains in him and he cannot sin the Bible said one's purged by the blood of Jesus has no more desire of sin if you have a desire your heart is not right with God he said now you will do wrong but you don't do it willfully willfully from what from the seed you don't do it from the inside man your flesh wants to do it obviously you wouldn't do it but he said see you're trapped and anything you're trapped into or do something that you don't mean to do it listen it's not sin yet look here's the difference you take someone that's been born again it's not sin yet you'll repent the minute you see you're wrong you'll turn quickly and say I didn't mean didn't see that he said you'll say that all through life better get used to some of our elders could say Amen tonight you better get used to it what about condemnation well that's the tool of the devil that's the only tool he's got right that's the only tool he's got left in his box he had a whole bunch of tools and God took them all away from him only thing he's got left is condemnation right the feeling of condemnation not actual condemnation because actual condemnation is passed we can't even have that but his recourse is to get you to act as if the case has not been dismissed all right because if he gets you to act in that way then it doesn't matter if it's been dismissed or not but listen what he said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus listen who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that Greek word for walk is the action of walking now it's just the devil you know what he does he makes us condemned about being condemned right he'll actually bring condemnation to us about having condemnation but the Bible says there is no condemnation that's a statement of fact those whose actions of Life are influenced by the spirit and not by the flesh to use an analogy that brother Joel is famous for using uh there was an Indian chief one time and and a man asked me said how are you doing he said pretty good and pretty bad he said he said why why do you say pretty good and pretty bad he said because there's two dogs fighting he said one's a good dog and one's a bad dog he said a white dog and a black dog and he said they fight one with another and when they fight he said they the the good dog and the bad dog he said well which one wins he said the one she feeds the most right he said that just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature to the things of God see we could get into the service we could spend the whole service thinking about McDonald's it just depends on which one we cater to we could get into the service or we could spend the whole service thinking about tomorrow but which one we cater to depends on which one wins but John said beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God that's what we want tonight we want confidence our case has been dismissed our attorney is the judge and he dismissed it with prejudice I wish I had the voice to preach it tonight he dismissed it with prejudice he said whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments you say oh there it is oh that means I can keep the law and we'll get what I want now listen what he says he said do those things that are pleasing in his sight you say brother Ben give me a list of things to do okay I'm going to do that I'm going to do that that next verse is a list of things you have to do to keep the Commandments of God everything's on it do you know that that's what he says this is is his commandment you want to know what you should do what you shouldn't do say brother B what's the list of rules to belong to Word of Life Tabernacle here it is this is what you got to do to be a member of the Bride some say you got to jump some say you got to shout but this is what he said this is the Commandment this is his commandment we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment that's pretty simple isn't it there is therefore now no condemnation to them who walk after that believe why would you sit in church your whole life under condemnation and I know I've experienced the joy of the Lord as the musicians come I know what it's like to feel the presence of God I know many of you do as well but why why would why would you want to sit there and and only feel condemnation every time you you're just always under conviction you know how to fix that repent and believe repent and believe be honest with your attorney he already knows anyway in fact he already paid for it be honest with him and then if you're a Christian just don't let the devil back in you know when they when they built the Great Wall of China they built a wall that was so massive that no Army could get past it and it was so high no Army no there was no technology to overcome the Great Wall of China it's still there they built it so big and I'm sure they were so proud of it but they were invaded three times in the first hundred years that wall was built you know what they did they bribed The Gatekeepers you're a gatekeeper you got a gate in the mind that's a gate to the soul you're a gatekeeper the only way the devil can get you is to bribe you so he says he says I'll you know watch this do this he bribes you and then condemnation comes in that's the only way he can get in is to offer you temporary pleasure but I say Lord I'm going to stand for the word I'm going to do what's right I'm going to believe I'm I'm going to I'm going to do what God said I'm going to believe no matter what the devil says about me no matter how much of it is true because I know that devil the one who's talking is the one who got me to do it in the first place so I'm not going to listen to him no more I'm not going to listen to the accuser can you say Amen to that tonight I'm not going to listen to him anymore I'm going to only listen to the one who can give me joy and peace that passes all understand standing would you bow your heads with us tonight as we go to the Lord in prayer maybe you'd like to be remembered I apologize tonight I don't have a lot of breath but I felt like I needed to preach and it's just something the lord gave me I don't know who it was for I don't believe he does anything randomly it's always on purpose maybe you like to just lift your hand to him and say but been remember me tonight I I've had this condemnation or things I I just not really understood this but tonight I want to I want to just accept the fact that he's my judge and my attorney he he's the one he's the only one who can put me in or out and I'm believing today he's going to put me in God bless those hands I need to be reminded I know on a regular basis just like your children they need to be reminded that that you love them on a regular basis and sometimes you just need to hear the voice of God speaking to you saying I love you I love you I care about you I I'm your attorney remember I'm your attorney I'm not just your judge I'm your attorney but I am your judge and I've said cases dismissed against you can never be brought again I'm so thankful for that tonight aren't you Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray for each one that raise their
