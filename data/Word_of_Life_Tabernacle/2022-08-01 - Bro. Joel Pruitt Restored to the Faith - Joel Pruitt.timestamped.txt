[51:50] office i said i like to preach after
[51:51] you've had a bad day
[51:53] it's hard to preach after he hit a home
[51:55] run
[51:56] so
[51:58] come up and do some cleanup duty tonight
[51:59] but i tell you what it's good to be in
[52:01] the house the lord if we could turn to
[52:02] jude chapter 1 verse 3.
[52:08] do you love the lord tonight amen
[52:15] jude chapter 1 verse 3 beloved when i
[52:18] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[52:20] the common salvation
[52:22] it was needful needful for me to write
[52:24] unto you and exhort you that you should
[52:26] earnestly contend
[52:28] for the faith which was once delivered
[52:31] unto the saints
[52:33] and one more scripture before you're
[52:34] seated joel chapter 2
[52:37] 25-26 very familiar scripture here
[52:40] joel 2 25 and i will restore to you
[52:43] the years that the locusts hath eaten
[52:46] the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[52:48] palmer worm
[52:49] my great army which i sent among you and
[52:51] you shall eat and plenty and be
[52:53] satisfied and praise the name of the
[52:55] lord your god that hath dealt wondrously
[52:58] with you and my people shall never
[53:01] be ashamed
[53:03] we're not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[53:05] christ we're not ashamed to be
[53:07] associated with that book of acts church
[53:09] tonight
[53:10] can you say amen amen
[53:12] may the lord add his blessings to the
[53:14] words you may be seated
[53:15] i just had this thought come on my mind
[53:18] that we cannot allow
[53:20] the common
[53:21] conception of church entity
[53:24] to stop us from having a book of acts
[53:26] experience
[53:27] we cannot ex we can't take on the spirit
[53:30] of the age where you'll see the two
[53:32] spirits come up so close and you'll see
[53:35] the church that'll have a form of
[53:36] godliness but they deny the power of the
[53:39] first church
[53:41] brother branham says it like this he
[53:42] says i will restore saith the lord i
[53:44] will restore all the days of the
[53:46] caterpillar all the blessings of the
[53:48] lutheran had the baptist had the
[53:49] methodist had i will restore
[53:52] saith the lord a tree that won't stand
[53:54] stiff but when the holy ghost falls
[53:56] they're flexible
[53:57] we might be green but we're flexible
[53:59] that's one thing about us we may not be
[54:01] doctors of divinity have all the
[54:03] theology but we're green enough to bend
[54:05] to the power of god and rejoice and have
[54:07] a real good old-fashioned holy ghost
[54:09] meeting that's what we need brother more
[54:11] than anything
[54:13] else
[54:14] more than a head knowledge
[54:16] more than somebody to get up here and
[54:17] give you an intellectual talk is the
[54:19] power of the holy ghost preached in the
[54:21] pulpits again
[54:22] he goes on to say that's the way an
[54:24] old-fashioned revival is when you reach
[54:26] down and get a better hold step off of
[54:27] that old cold formal creed over here and
[54:30] get over here on the vine of the lord
[54:31] and go to eating the fruits and grapes
[54:33] off the vine of the lord he said i will
[54:35] restore
[54:36] remember a restoration a restoration is
[54:39] to bring back something to its original
[54:41] condition something that was that was
[54:43] once good and had had lost itself down
[54:46] through the dark ages you'll see that
[54:47] the book of acts church is what we
[54:49] strive for but throughout the ages
[54:51] you'll have the lutherans and you have
[54:52] the baptist and and the catholics and so
[54:54] forth and they took something away that
[54:56] that would fit with their creed or their
[54:58] organization but what we have now is a
[55:01] message of restoration we have a message
[55:03] that came to restore all the things that
[55:05] were eat off the tree back to the tree
[55:07] this bride tree that we have now
[55:10] and we go on brother brown says restore
[55:11] what
[55:13] all the beauty that she was at one time
[55:15] i will restore the same church that i
[55:18] had at pentecost i will restore the
[55:20] gifts of the spirit i will restore signs
[55:22] and wonders i will restore speaking in
[55:25] tongues i will restore the prophet i
[55:27] will restore all saith the lord all is
[55:31] restored in this day we have need of
[55:33] nothing in this day because what we have
[55:35] is the fullness of the restored word of
[55:38] god for the hour
[55:39] can you say amen
[55:41] this is not a day where we have need of
[55:43] revelation the revelation is there what
[55:46] we have is we have to it has to be
[55:47] revealed to us by the holy spirit but
[55:49] there's not going to come another
[55:50] prophet with another revelation to tell
[55:53] us what we need to do the revelation is
[55:55] there if we'll just grab hold of it
[55:58] and i think today we get we're always
[56:00] looking for something in the future
[56:01] brother branham says we're looking for
[56:03] something far off and we fail to see
[56:05] what god is doing right now but church
[56:07] i'm here to tell you there is a revival
[56:09] going on in the bride right now we're
[56:11] not looking for a bride's revival it's
[56:13] here
[56:14] the bride's revival is happening now and
[56:17] we we get so caught up with the things
[56:19] of the world and the distractions but
[56:21] remember this church will be restored
[56:23] this true church this bride will be
[56:25] restored back to the book of acts back
[56:27] to the gifts they had then and you think
[56:29] about it it takes a faith to be restored
[56:31] to that condition because what what the
[56:33] church had and the original when they
[56:35] went up to the upper room they didn't go
[56:37] up there for a few minutes and say well
[56:39] the lord didn't bless me so i'm going to
[56:40] leave no they stayed until the power
[56:42] came
[56:43] and in this day we don't we don't go to
[56:45] church and if the first 15 minutes don't
[56:47] give us goosebumps we just say well this
[56:49] is a bad service but stay there hold on
[56:52] accept something that god has to give
[56:54] for you today
[56:55] i think we get a little bit too caught
[56:57] up in the the worldly attitude and and
[57:00] we get into the tv and sports and things
[57:02] and and it kind of blinds us our pastor
[57:05] taught us this morning about being
[57:06] blinded and the the father would put
[57:08] would put a blindfold over the sun and
[57:10] then that father would put a blindfold
[57:12] over the next one so that they would he
[57:14] said next thing you know they're born
[57:15] blind
[57:17] what is it because you're accepting the
[57:19] blindness that you're in you accept the
[57:21] world and its condition but we need to
[57:23] move past that this world and its
[57:25] condition is going to perish but there
[57:27] will be a bride that will come out of
[57:28] this world and not be partakers of the
[57:31] plagues that are coming on this world
[57:34] we need to have something new
[57:36] something refreshed in our lives
[57:38] something restored
[57:40] the message that came was not a message
[57:42] to keep us in our condition it was not a
[57:44] message that told us stay in your
[57:46] baptist church and you're just okay no
[57:48] he did tell people to go to church
[57:50] but he said if you'll you go in there
[57:52] and if you make a stand for something
[57:54] they'll get rid of you they'll kick you
[57:55] out of that denominational system but i
[57:57] wonder today if we haven't done the same
[57:59] thing in the message ranks we're sitting
[58:01] in a church and we say this is good
[58:03] enough what we have is enough and
[58:06] they're dead they're cold they're formal
[58:08] and they have some kind of a creed or
[58:10] they'll preach your doctrine about the
[58:11] return of
[58:12] a prophet
[58:13] we're looking for the coming of the lord
[58:15] not looking for the return of a prophet
[58:17] i'd love to see a prophet return but
[58:19] church we're looking for the return of
[58:22] jesus christ to take a bride out of here
[58:24] the prophet came to get you ready for
[58:26] that
[58:28] psalms 51 10 created me a clean heart oh
[58:30] god renew a right spirit within me cast
[58:33] me not away from thy presence take not
[58:35] thy holy spirit from me restore unto me
[58:39] the joy of thy salvation
[58:42] restore the joy he didn't lose his
[58:44] salvation but he lost the joy of his
[58:47] salvation we were not a brother brandon
[58:49] will say this in a message and i was
[58:51] just listening to the restoration of the
[58:52] bride tree and he talks about how we
[58:54] would lose uh we would the bride was
[58:56] lost
[58:57] in catholicism he said because they cut
[59:00] off the gifts of the spirit and water
[59:02] baptism in jesus name he said that was
[59:04] the bride coming down and they cut it
[59:06] off there they lost it right there why
[59:08] because you took off some of the word
[59:10] but if that same people
[59:13] that are called by the name of god
[59:15] called by the name of jesus christ can
[59:17] take a hold of the promises of god he
[59:20] never took away the blessings
[59:23] we lost the blessings when we left the
[59:24] word
[59:26] the blessings were always there if you
[59:28] would stay with the word
[59:30] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[59:33] he said uh brother branham goes on he's
[59:35] and i and i don't i've got too many
[59:36] quotes i won't be able to get to all of
[59:38] them he said we find them
[59:40] insects are the same insects only in a
[59:42] different stage
[59:44] what the lutheran had the methodist
[59:45] eight what the methodist left the
[59:47] baptist state what the beb what the
[59:49] baptist left the pentecostals eight the
[59:50] whole thing is cut down he said he said
[59:52] but god said i will restore saith the
[59:54] lord all the years
[59:57] all the years that were taken away will
[59:58] be restored in this last day he said
[1:00:00] i'll send back another church
[1:00:04] i believe he sent another church today
[1:00:06] we are the church
[1:00:08] we are the bride of christ
[1:00:10] there's not coming another bride you're
[1:00:12] it
[1:00:13] this is the end time if you could ever
[1:00:15] see
[1:00:16] if you could see what the prophet came
[1:00:18] and and prophesied to us the things that
[1:00:21] would happen and i i mentioned this to a
[1:00:23] brother this afternoon when brother
[1:00:25] branham had the vision he was sitting
[1:00:26] there in jcpenney's about how bad it
[1:00:27] would get
[1:00:28] how vulgar the women would get i'm
[1:00:30] telling you church this is the last age
[1:00:33] and in this age there would come a bride
[1:00:35] out of this worldly age
[1:00:37] somebody who could withstand the very
[1:00:39] test of time
[1:00:42] somebody
[1:00:43] who wouldn't walk away just because it
[1:00:45] got a little tough
[1:00:47] somebody who would who would stand
[1:00:50] when there was those who'd go against
[1:00:51] the message somebody who said i believe
[1:00:54] the message of the hour i have the faith
[1:00:56] of abraham
[1:00:58] i don't care if it's 25 more years to a
[1:01:00] rapture i'll be here waiting for it
[1:01:03] i'll send back another church in the
[1:01:05] last days he said i will restore that
[1:01:07] original power again
[1:01:09] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:01:13] he said down in the heart of that tree
[1:01:14] no matter how many branches is pruned
[1:01:16] there will come forth the royal seed of
[1:01:19] abraham
[1:01:20] god promised it god will do it he said
[1:01:22] he would do it he said i will restore
[1:01:24] all the years that the denominations
[1:01:26] took from you all that the denominations
[1:01:28] ate i will restore back to that church
[1:01:32] i love it i believe if we could
[1:01:33] recognize that we are that church the
[1:01:35] true church
[1:01:37] we wouldn't let no denominational creed
[1:01:38] creep in among us we wouldn't let no
[1:01:41] message creed come in among us
[1:01:43] and try to steal the joy that we have
[1:01:46] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:01:48] i believe that if a church can get
[1:01:50] really really into the message of the
[1:01:52] hour you say we need the word the word i
[1:01:54] believe if you can get that word of the
[1:01:56] original church that brother branham
[1:01:58] said he preached the same thing paul
[1:02:00] taught the same thing peter taught is
[1:02:02] the same thing that was taught now but
[1:02:04] that will not produce a dead church it
[1:02:06] will produce another book of acts church
[1:02:09] these the signs and wonders will follow
[1:02:11] if you'll get back in line with the word
[1:02:13] of god
[1:02:14] we're not looking for something it's
[1:02:16] here
[1:02:18] he said he'll be like a tree that's
[1:02:19] planted by the rivers of water a man
[1:02:21] that meditates in the word of god day
[1:02:23] and night not a creed or a denomination
[1:02:25] but meditates in the word day and night
[1:02:28] he'll be like a tree planted by the
[1:02:29] water branches shall not wither he'll
[1:02:32] bring forth his fruit in the season
[1:02:35] and he said no matter how far you
[1:02:37] stooped in sin you're still sons and
[1:02:39] daughters of god because you're fallen
[1:02:42] degenerated in your soul and mind but
[1:02:44] god is your creator and in your fallen
[1:02:46] estate you're a lost undone creation of
[1:02:49] god dominated by the devil
[1:02:52] you were never not his
[1:02:54] but your spirit was dominated by him
[1:02:57] he said that's right you're still sons
[1:02:59] and daughters of god he is not willing
[1:03:01] that any of you should perish but all
[1:03:03] might come unto repentance see and he's
[1:03:06] done everything that lays possible for
[1:03:08] only god himself could do this to give
[1:03:11] the opportunities to the creature of his
[1:03:13] to accept and be what he wants you to be
[1:03:16] back in your right estate again he said
[1:03:18] now here it is and it's pretty sharp but
[1:03:20] no person is in their right mental
[1:03:22] status until they have accepted the lord
[1:03:24] jesus
[1:03:25] no person
[1:03:27] is in your right mental status you say
[1:03:28] the world's insane of course they're
[1:03:30] insane because they've never accepted
[1:03:32] what we have today there's a reason
[1:03:34] there's a difference
[1:03:36] there's a reason why we don't live like
[1:03:38] the world
[1:03:39] there's a reason why we're not groping
[1:03:41] in insanity like the world is today it's
[1:03:44] because we have accepted the very spirit
[1:03:46] of christ in our day when they went into
[1:03:48] the upper room they accepted something
[1:03:50] that would change them from the inside
[1:03:52] out and we have waited and we have
[1:03:54] waited and now on this day they have the
[1:03:56] same spirit has been restored to the
[1:03:58] church and we have now the same power
[1:04:01] of the book of acts
[1:04:04] brother branham goes on he says it's not
[1:04:05] just a power but it's an authority given
[1:04:08] see you can look at me and say brother
[1:04:09] joel you don't look very strong but
[1:04:11] there's an authority given to me by the
[1:04:13] word of god i may not be able to fight
[1:04:15] off a devil by myself but there's
[1:04:17] something on the inside of me that can
[1:04:19] withstand every devil because why it's
[1:04:21] an authority given to the body of christ
[1:04:24] it's an authority given to you in this
[1:04:26] day because he knew how bad it would be
[1:04:28] he knew how dark it would get but he
[1:04:31] knew that you would be a light in this
[1:04:32] day he knew that you would be somebody
[1:04:35] that could withstand the darkest hour he
[1:04:37] didn't call you in luther's age he
[1:04:39] didn't call you in wesley's age but he
[1:04:41] called you in the darkest age of all of
[1:04:44] them because he knew you were made of
[1:04:46] that stuff that could withstand all the
[1:04:48] devils he knew you were made of
[1:04:50] something that wouldn't bluff from the
[1:04:52] devil
[1:04:53] he knew you were made out of something
[1:04:54] pretty tough
[1:04:56] because why the spirit of christ himself
[1:04:59] had to come and be in you in this day
[1:05:02] you had to accept the fullness of the
[1:05:04] godhead in his day
[1:05:05] in order to withstand all the tactics
[1:05:09] the devil would send i believe the devil
[1:05:11] has got all kinds of tactics i believe
[1:05:13] he changes them
[1:05:14] when we start understanding the tactics
[1:05:17] think about it like this when the devil
[1:05:18] knows he can't get you to keep stay out
[1:05:20] of church he'll get you to quit praying
[1:05:22] he'll get you to quit reading your bible
[1:05:24] he'll get you to do something and he'll
[1:05:26] have a really sneaky way to do it
[1:05:28] he'll have a way to do it that'll just
[1:05:30] it'll seem like nothing changed in your
[1:05:32] life but if you'll ever look back to
[1:05:34] where you were when you were really on
[1:05:36] fire for god
[1:05:37] and then you see in the cold condition
[1:05:39] that we sometimes get into church if we
[1:05:41] could ever get back to where we were get
[1:05:44] back to our first love back to what we
[1:05:46] had at the beginning remember when you
[1:05:48] were on fire for god and there was
[1:05:50] something inside of you that would just
[1:05:52] stand up and worship in church something
[1:05:54] that was just so glad that god could
[1:05:56] save a sinner like me and then you
[1:05:58] become a good church member and then
[1:06:00] you're acting like you're too good to
[1:06:01] stand up and worship god i'm telling you
[1:06:04] this will restore you back to the
[1:06:06] condition of worship this will restore
[1:06:08] you back to where you have been excited
[1:06:11] about god this will take you from being
[1:06:13] being so so just you just seem like
[1:06:15] christians
[1:06:16] the word i'm looking for i believe it's
[1:06:18] like this i believe we have become so so
[1:06:21] slothful
[1:06:23] in our worship but you know what it is
[1:06:25] it's not just the worship it's not just
[1:06:27] that we can come and raise our hand but
[1:06:29] there's something on the inside that we
[1:06:31] lack and what happens is we lose it
[1:06:34] because of the condition we're living in
[1:06:36] what you are at home
[1:06:38] will show up
[1:06:40] the stuff you watch
[1:06:42] the stuff you read
[1:06:44] i'll tell you if you're in the bible if
[1:06:47] you're listening to the message of the
[1:06:48] hour that'll show too
[1:06:51] and satan will fight you harder when you
[1:06:53] do that
[1:06:54] he'll make less time for you to read
[1:06:56] he'll make less time for you to hear the
[1:06:58] tapes
[1:06:58] he'll make plenty of time for you to
[1:07:00] watch the latest movie that's out
[1:07:02] but if you'll just stand up for the
[1:07:04] truth one time and watch that devil flee
[1:07:07] away from you
[1:07:08] watch that devil run from you watch him
[1:07:10] when you stand up when you get out of
[1:07:12] bed and you put your feet on the floor
[1:07:15] and all hell shakes because they know
[1:07:17] that you got up out of bed and you're
[1:07:19] there to torment the devil
[1:07:22] i'll tell you i think we need some more
[1:07:23] tormentors here today that'll tell the
[1:07:25] devil you cannot take my joy you are not
[1:07:29] going to keep me out of the house of god
[1:07:31] you are not going to keep me out of the
[1:07:33] word of god you can't stop me there's
[1:07:35] nothing going to make me give up because
[1:07:37] i was not born to lose but i was born to
[1:07:40] win
[1:07:42] i wonder if somebody in the church could
[1:07:44] stand up today and say i was born to win
[1:07:48] can't nobody keep the joy away from me
[1:07:51] can't nobody stop me from worshiping god
[1:07:53] nobody
[1:07:55] nothing there's not enough devils in
[1:07:57] hell
[1:07:59] not enough devils in hell to make me
[1:08:01] stop
[1:08:02] i'll tell you what he can take me to the
[1:08:04] grave
[1:08:05] he could ruin me in any way he wants to
[1:08:07] but i'm not giving up my battle and
[1:08:09] fighting him
[1:08:10] i'll get up every day and as long as
[1:08:12] i've got breath i'll say boo devil
[1:08:15] you have no right
[1:08:17] in my body
[1:08:18] healing is mine
[1:08:20] i'll tell you something
[1:08:22] ever since i've been go back from egypt
[1:08:24] satan has fought me in my health
[1:08:27] has been i can still can't hardly eat
[1:08:29] but i'm going to tell you right now it
[1:08:31] won't stop me from telling the people of
[1:08:33] the world about god
[1:08:35] won't tell it won't stop me you know i'd
[1:08:38] rather
[1:08:40] i'll tell you what
[1:08:41] i would rather be in this fight
[1:08:44] than sitting back at my lazy boy
[1:08:46] watching football
[1:08:47] because the devil's got you sitting
[1:08:49] there
[1:08:49] if you get up and you just do what he
[1:08:51] wants you to do every day he's got you
[1:08:54] but if there's something fighting you
[1:08:56] remember you if you're a young christian
[1:08:57] think about this if satan's fighting you
[1:09:00] on what to dress
[1:09:02] how to act who to hang out with remember
[1:09:04] that's not that's not the right spirit
[1:09:06] trying to get you to do bad things
[1:09:09] that's satan trying to get in there and
[1:09:11] trying to steal your joy because you've
[1:09:13] come under something that is an
[1:09:15] anointing for this generation you are
[1:09:17] anointed to win but satan sees that
[1:09:20] knows that you've taken your side with
[1:09:22] jesus
[1:09:24] and he wants to fight you with
[1:09:25] everything he's got and he's got a lot
[1:09:28] but we've got more
[1:09:30] there's more with us
[1:09:32] than be with them greater is he
[1:09:35] that is in you
[1:09:37] than he that is in the world
[1:09:39] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:09:42] prosper
[1:09:43] no weapon
[1:09:45] nothing shall prosper against you why
[1:09:47] because you were born to win
[1:09:50] there was a seed on the inside of you
[1:09:52] that couldn't be squashed out by the
[1:09:54] drought
[1:09:56] you were born to win when you needed the
[1:09:58] anointing and the holy spirit on your
[1:10:00] life god would send it
[1:10:02] god would send a watering rain when you
[1:10:04] had need of it there is nothing can stop
[1:10:07] you
[1:10:08] this bride of jesus will march on and
[1:10:10] prevail no matter what
[1:10:12] brother branham talks about enforcing
[1:10:15] he said what is it enforcing
[1:10:17] give it back
[1:10:18] what he said that's what it's talking
[1:10:20] about restore it bring it back
[1:10:22] to its right owner
[1:10:25] i tell you what we let satan act like
[1:10:27] the owner way too often
[1:10:29] we let him act like he owns your body
[1:10:31] your soul and your spirit but he owns
[1:10:34] nothing
[1:10:36] he owns nothing of ours
[1:10:38] god gave it to us it's his property
[1:10:41] we borrowed this flesh to walk in but
[1:10:44] it's the very spirit of god satan owns
[1:10:46] nothing
[1:10:48] remember when jesus went into hell
[1:10:51] he took those keys
[1:10:54] and he opened the lock
[1:10:56] and you are no longer shackled i believe
[1:10:58] i heard it in the meetings we're not
[1:11:00] polishing the shackles we come to loose
[1:11:02] the shackles
[1:11:04] we're not here to bring the spirit of
[1:11:06] fear upon the people but to tell you
[1:11:08] there's a release in the seventh year in
[1:11:11] the seventh age there is something in
[1:11:13] this age that'll restore everything back
[1:11:15] that you lost
[1:11:17] you say i lost family look at job he
[1:11:19] lost everything but it was all restored
[1:11:22] to him
[1:11:24] if you're one of his
[1:11:26] you can't lose
[1:11:28] if you're one of his
[1:11:30] everything you have need of is yours
[1:11:33] i believe there's spiritual food in this
[1:11:34] season we have to eat i believe there's
[1:11:37] this heat i believe there's a spirit
[1:11:39] here to make it live i believe there's a
[1:11:41] people here for it to live through
[1:11:44] do you believe it tonight you're one of
[1:11:46] his i'm not here to beat you over the
[1:11:47] head i'm here to encourage you tonight
[1:11:49] don't be distracted by the devil don't
[1:11:52] be distracted by movies and tv and all
[1:11:54] these things that would take away your
[1:11:56] time from god but if you could ever get
[1:11:59] back in love with god if you can fall in
[1:12:01] love with him all over again then
[1:12:03] nothing can take away that divine
[1:12:06] revelation that he's put in your heart
[1:12:08] this is not a head knowledge this is not
[1:12:10] something i learned i tell you what you
[1:12:11] say was you were you were raised on a
[1:12:13] message pew i was raised around the
[1:12:15] message and and the church of god and
[1:12:17] the different ones but i can tell you
[1:12:18] this i was an unbeliever or a
[1:12:20] make-believer until there was a time
[1:12:23] when i come in contact with the very
[1:12:25] spirit of god for myself and now there's
[1:12:27] nothing could take it away from me at
[1:12:29] one time i would listen to the upc on
[1:12:31] what they had to say i would go to their
[1:12:33] churches i was looking for something but
[1:12:35] there's something in me now that says
[1:12:37] there's nothing greater than the word
[1:12:39] that god has given me and the spirit
[1:12:41] that he gave me to stand for it there's
[1:12:43] nothing going to make me deny it now
[1:12:47] you say
[1:12:48] brother joel if they were going to cut
[1:12:50] your head off would you stand for this
[1:12:51] message i believe i'm too in love with
[1:12:54] the message to turn it down now
[1:12:56] i believe that i can stand in the face
[1:12:58] of it now and say do with me what you
[1:13:00] will but i serve a god who is more than
[1:13:03] able to deliver me from that
[1:13:05] i believe by revelation but see it
[1:13:07] wasn't a dead letter i heard the tapes i
[1:13:10] heard the preachers but when the spirit
[1:13:12] revealed it to me it wasn't a dead
[1:13:14] letter no more it was the spirit making
[1:13:17] the word come alive in me
[1:13:20] somebody here's experienced that before
[1:13:22] somebody has more than just a theology
[1:13:25] here today somebody has experienced god
[1:13:28] for themselves
[1:13:32] abraham says and if satan has robbed you
[1:13:33] of the privilege of being a son or
[1:13:35] daughter of god
[1:13:36] we have a right this morning by the holy
[1:13:38] spirit to enforce the claim of god bring
[1:13:41] them back
[1:13:42] if you feel under condemnation this
[1:13:45] afternoon you don't have to leave that
[1:13:47] way
[1:13:48] if you feel like satan is robbing you of
[1:13:51] joy and peace and all the things that
[1:13:53] those worms ate off the tree in the in
[1:13:55] those days and joel said that they would
[1:13:57] but the prophet said that they would eat
[1:13:59] off the caterpillar and the locust and
[1:14:01] the palmer worm and so forth would eat
[1:14:02] these things off the tree but remember
[1:14:04] this is the day of restoration if you
[1:14:06] were in the days and the dark ages in
[1:14:08] the in those other church ages there may
[1:14:10] not have been a restoration for you
[1:14:12] maybe you would have had to live without
[1:14:14] something but in this day all things are
[1:14:16] made new
[1:14:18] everything has been restored back to the
[1:14:20] church
[1:14:21] he said if he's afflicted you made you
[1:14:23] sick we have a right before god to
[1:14:26] enforce the laws of god by his stripes
[1:14:28] we are healed he said bring him back
[1:14:31] turn him loose you're taking him out
[1:14:32] yonder of death and we claim him and
[1:14:35] bring him back i wonder if we can stand
[1:14:37] like a prophet of god and say we're not
[1:14:39] under you we have been brought back he
[1:14:42] said release him and bring him back
[1:14:46] in this day
[1:14:48] we allow we allow ourselves to be tied
[1:14:51] we are allow ourselves to be in bondage
[1:14:53] when there's no need for that
[1:14:55] remember johnny crow brother branham
[1:14:57] would talk about he was tied up out
[1:14:59] there
[1:15:00] and he was on a rope and he went and
[1:15:01] somebody felt sorry for him come and cut
[1:15:03] him loose and he still stayed in the
[1:15:05] same little circle because he didn't
[1:15:07] recognize his freedom it's time you
[1:15:09] recognize your freedom you can fly if
[1:15:12] you want to
[1:15:13] you can go free if you want to this is
[1:15:15] the day that you can have your freedom
[1:15:19] this is not a day of condemnation and
[1:15:22] bondage you say well it sounds pretty
[1:15:24] condemning when brother brandon preaches
[1:15:25] those things it's only condemning if
[1:15:27] you're doing them
[1:15:29] i mean come on now
[1:15:32] if you get up here and you preach
[1:15:33] something steps on your toes don't get
[1:15:35] mad at the preacher examine what you're
[1:15:38] doing
[1:15:39] maybe i'm wrong but at least you'll
[1:15:41] examine yourself stir up your mind and
[1:15:43] make sure that what you're doing
[1:15:46] is lining up with the word of god
[1:15:48] make sure it's pleasing to
[1:15:50] god that's the enforcement he says
[1:15:54] restore it back
[1:15:55] to its natural condition again
[1:15:57] a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is
[1:15:59] sick he said they're out of their
[1:16:01] natural
[1:16:02] condition
[1:16:03] he said we have a right to enforce our
[1:16:05] claim
[1:16:06] not our claim it's our claim because god
[1:16:09] gave it to us
[1:16:10] by his stripes we were healed he was
[1:16:13] wounded for our transgression with his
[1:16:16] stripes we were healed now we have a
[1:16:18] right to enforce that law and the law
[1:16:21] giver the holy spirit himself is here
[1:16:24] the agent of god to see that it's done
[1:16:28] that way
[1:16:30] he's here today the agent of god is here
[1:16:34] to see that you have been restored
[1:16:37] amen we just let we say here i tell you
[1:16:40] what we get ourselves in such a
[1:16:41] condemnation we get ourselves under
[1:16:44] condemnation because we're not living
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:46] but there is therefore now no
[1:16:49] condemnation
[1:16:50] to him who walks what
[1:16:52] after what
[1:16:54] after the spirit but if you're walking
[1:16:56] according to the flesh there will be
[1:16:58] condemnation in your heart but if you
[1:17:00] can ever get the condemnation away from
[1:17:02] you
[1:17:03] then you can have freedom to worship
[1:17:05] when you come into the service and
[1:17:07] there's no condemnation then you can
[1:17:09] expect something from god you can say
[1:17:11] there's no there's therefore no
[1:17:13] condemnation to him that passed from
[1:17:15] death into life but i'll tell you
[1:17:16] tonight there is therefore no
[1:17:18] condemnation to you that believe there's
[1:17:20] no condemnation if you'll sit here today
[1:17:23] and say lord take those things away from
[1:17:25] me you were wounded for my
[1:17:27] transgressions i don't have to pay for
[1:17:29] that you paid for that transgression
[1:17:31] that i did if you it don't matter how
[1:17:33] low in sin you were let me tell you this
[1:17:35] i don't care what you've done
[1:17:38] if you can accept jesus christ in this
[1:17:40] day and the word that he's given to you
[1:17:42] then you don't have to live under
[1:17:44] condemnation i don't care what you look
[1:17:46] like i don't care what you feel like
[1:17:48] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:17:50] to you if you'll walk not after the
[1:17:53] flesh
[1:17:56] i don't think
[1:17:57] we live
[1:17:58] like we should
[1:18:00] but many times when satan will distract
[1:18:02] us and he'll get us out of fellowship
[1:18:03] with god out of communion with god
[1:18:05] remember there's a way back
[1:18:08] there's a way back
[1:18:09] sometimes it requires humility sometimes
[1:18:12] it requires us to give up something that
[1:18:14] we are doing
[1:18:15] sometimes it requires us
[1:18:17] to make something right with somebody
[1:18:19] even though it may embarrass us
[1:18:21] but if there's something there that's
[1:18:23] hindering your worship make it right
[1:18:25] it's worth it
[1:18:27] it's worth it
[1:18:28] it's worth it because you sitting there
[1:18:30] with the wrong spirit can hinder the
[1:18:32] person next to you in the church
[1:18:34] but if you can make that thing right
[1:18:37] if you can go to god and repent of your
[1:18:40] sin and then if he says go make it right
[1:18:42] with your brother maybe there's
[1:18:43] something you have against somebody go
[1:18:45] make it right and watch god moving that
[1:18:47] next service for you
[1:18:49] come expecting why because there's no
[1:18:51] condemnation and what is it it's a
[1:18:53] restoration it's making things new
[1:18:57] making things right restoring back if
[1:18:59] you take an old car that needs to be
[1:19:01] restored it may look like a piece of
[1:19:03] junk
[1:19:04] it may be sitting out there just resting
[1:19:06] away but brother it can be restored to
[1:19:09] its original condition and you may have
[1:19:11] backslid into a place where you just
[1:19:13] seem like you can't find god no more but
[1:19:16] there is a restoring agent here today
[1:19:19] he can restore you back to your right
[1:19:21] condition back to a right mind again
[1:19:25] brother brandon said the natural eve
[1:19:27] fell in the eden by listening to satan's
[1:19:28] reasoning against god's word that's how
[1:19:30] she fell spiritual eve now that's the
[1:19:33] church
[1:19:34] christ's bride she fell not in eden but
[1:19:37] in rome
[1:19:38] she at the night see a council when she
[1:19:40] rejected that pentecostal church
[1:19:42] that sin i've got some feedback
[1:19:44] brother peter
[1:19:46] that pentecostal church that went down
[1:19:47] to nicea and listening to roman's
[1:19:49] reasoning instead of holding onto the
[1:19:50] word
[1:19:51] she fell and everything away from her
[1:19:54] died with her around her now just as
[1:19:56] natural eve fell
[1:19:57] spiritual eve fell god's bride fell in
[1:20:00] the garden christ's bride fell in rome
[1:20:03] see notice by the same reasoning against
[1:20:06] god's word she also forfeited her rights
[1:20:08] of virtue to satan which we found in the
[1:20:11] breaking of these seals that was satan
[1:20:13] and still a satan there the bible said
[1:20:15] it's the very seed of satan and as eve
[1:20:17] forfeited her virtuous rites and give
[1:20:19] them over to satan in the garden of eden
[1:20:21] the church the bride of christ did the
[1:20:23] same thing at rome when they forfeited
[1:20:25] the bible of their for their dogmas and
[1:20:27] their reasonings now she fell not in
[1:20:29] eden but in rome remember and he said
[1:20:31] and he goes on down here is anything
[1:20:33] standing in our way of serving god he
[1:20:34] said when we separated eve from adam eve
[1:20:37] fell by disbelieving the word that's
[1:20:38] right that's where the church failed
[1:20:40] today disbelieving the word but in this
[1:20:42] case to the royal seed
[1:20:44] called predestinated to eternal life the
[1:20:47] royal seat of abraham they believe that
[1:20:49] word i don't care what comes or goes how
[1:20:52] much they laugh who says this that or
[1:20:54] the other they are ordained to eternal
[1:20:56] life and she goes right straight back to
[1:20:58] her lover christ is the one he said the
[1:21:01] life the spirit that's in christ is in
[1:21:03] the church he said that's their eternal
[1:21:05] covenant here see god took the spirit of
[1:21:08] christ tore it apart and the sacrifice
[1:21:10] at calvary and took that spirit lifted
[1:21:13] up the body and set it on the right hand
[1:21:14] of the throne of god and majesty on high
[1:21:16] that's everything in heaven is
[1:21:18] controlled by him and then the spirit
[1:21:21] that was on on him come back the same
[1:21:23] spirit not another spirit the same
[1:21:25] spirit come upon him to confirm the
[1:21:28] covenant to the royal seed and in the
[1:21:30] last days we are supposed to see it
[1:21:32] according to the scripture and before
[1:21:34] the bride of christ can ever be taken up
[1:21:37] there has to be a ministry that just
[1:21:39] dovetails exactly he said i'm so glad to
[1:21:42] say tonight that i know that's the truth
[1:21:44] dovetailing confirming confirming the
[1:21:46] covenant amen the ministry came
[1:21:50] that ministry came and dovetailed
[1:21:52] perfectly with that first church what
[1:21:53] did he do he proved that the signs and
[1:21:55] wonders were still here he proved that
[1:21:57] healing was back in the church he proved
[1:21:59] christ was alive there's no reason for
[1:22:02] us to doubt in this day we have we can
[1:22:04] see it
[1:22:05] brother brother ben talked about this
[1:22:07] the five senses this morning and the
[1:22:09] sixth sense and if we think about it we
[1:22:12] can see it on the film deep calls to the
[1:22:13] deep you can see god in action you can
[1:22:16] hear it on the tapes we can use those
[1:22:17] senses to know in this age you don't
[1:22:20] even have to go strictly by your sixth
[1:22:22] sense to know that there's a living god
[1:22:25] even your human natural senses can tell
[1:22:27] you that there's a living god today if
[1:22:30] you don't try to reason it away
[1:22:31] but he said now the ministry came was
[1:22:33] exactly like the bible days well i'll
[1:22:35] skip down here look god in his body
[1:22:37] christ and christ in his body the bride
[1:22:40] oh my god made manifest in christ christ
[1:22:43] made manifest in the bride and as god
[1:22:45] took from the body of adam the woman she
[1:22:48] fell then god is took from the body of
[1:22:50] christ his flesh his body which is his
[1:22:52] word and is bringing a bride out that
[1:22:55] won't fall by denomination or creed no
[1:22:58] sir but she is coming back with the pure
[1:23:01] unadulterated word of god being
[1:23:04] manifested i'd like for you to catch
[1:23:07] that right there being manifested
[1:23:09] we're not putting it back on the prophet
[1:23:11] anymore it's manifested here and now
[1:23:14] this is not a time when we're looking
[1:23:16] for the manifestation
[1:23:18] in something in the future we're looking
[1:23:20] for something to be manifested in a tent
[1:23:22] but it's being manifested right here and
[1:23:24] now
[1:23:25] what the problem is the reason we miss
[1:23:28] it it goes over our heads is because
[1:23:30] we're not looking for it but if you're
[1:23:32] looking for the manifestation now you
[1:23:34] will see the manifestation in this body
[1:23:36] called the bride
[1:23:38] nothing can stop it
[1:23:41] satan may attack us
[1:23:43] but we are being restored back
[1:23:45] back to what
[1:23:47] to the faith
[1:23:48] of the pentecostal fathers
[1:23:51] back to the faith
[1:23:52] that they had
[1:23:54] this is not something afar off
[1:23:57] but it's here
[1:23:58] can we recognize it in our day have you
[1:24:01] recognized your day and its message
[1:24:04] have you recognized that we are not just
[1:24:06] another denomination we are not just
[1:24:08] another church or creed but we are the
[1:24:10] very body of christ today
[1:24:13] we are the ones called out we are the
[1:24:15] generation
[1:24:17] we are the chosen
[1:24:19] generation
[1:24:21] you may look like a normal human being
[1:24:23] but there's never been a greater body in
[1:24:25] all the ages than now
[1:24:28] because they didn't stay for a rapture
[1:24:30] but you were called out for a rapture i
[1:24:33] believe there's a generation on earth
[1:24:35] now that will not see death
[1:24:37] i believe there's a generation on earth
[1:24:39] that will be caught away
[1:24:41] by the quickening power that christ put
[1:24:43] in his church
[1:24:45] i'm about done here so i'll try not to
[1:24:47] hold you much longer
[1:24:49] but we are ordained
[1:24:50] to be restored
[1:24:52] we are ordained
[1:24:54] not to fall
[1:24:56] we are ordained
[1:24:58] to be restored in this day
[1:25:01] brother branham says if that tree ever
[1:25:03] puts forth another branch
[1:25:04] it will bear its original fruit
[1:25:06] there's got to be a restoration of these
[1:25:08] things right at the end of the vine
[1:25:11] there has to come forth a restoration an
[1:25:14] evening light
[1:25:15] to light it up and make it right
[1:25:18] but it will come out of the vine not a
[1:25:20] denomination that's grafted into it but
[1:25:22] an original production of the word
[1:25:24] i believe that i believe what we had
[1:25:27] this day was an original production of
[1:25:28] the word right this was not another
[1:25:30] healing evangelist
[1:25:32] this was a man that had more than just a
[1:25:34] healing ministry
[1:25:35] he could show you that christ was alive
[1:25:37] but what he had was the vindication that
[1:25:40] god was alive so we don't serve a dead
[1:25:42] god today we are following a vindicated
[1:25:45] prophet
[1:25:46] and we are doing what he said do
[1:25:48] that's why we don't sit down and just
[1:25:50] hear the tapes we actually have live
[1:25:52] ministry in the pulpit because he said
[1:25:53] to do it we're not hearers only in this
[1:25:56] day but we've been restored to doers
[1:25:58] also
[1:25:58] we have been restored from those that
[1:26:00] could sit in denominational thinking and
[1:26:02] been restored back to a complete
[1:26:05] look at the at the whole entire word
[1:26:07] when he came and opened the seals
[1:26:09] that wasn't just just so he could do it
[1:26:12] but it was to show you
[1:26:13] who you could be
[1:26:15] it was to show you what we needed to be
[1:26:16] restored to
[1:26:18] to restore us back
[1:26:20] it's to come forth for the evening time
[1:26:22] there will be a light in the evening
[1:26:24] time it takes the light to ripen it see
[1:26:26] how perfectly the scripture is a day
[1:26:28] that won't be called day or night fruit
[1:26:31] cannot ripen unless the sun ripens it no
[1:26:33] matter how much you preach whatever you
[1:26:35] do it cannot be ripened it cannot be
[1:26:37] manifested it cannot be vindicated only
[1:26:40] by him who said i am the light of the
[1:26:42] world the word so there has to come
[1:26:44] forth a power the holy spirit himself to
[1:26:47] ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to
[1:26:51] make manifested that what he's predicted
[1:26:53] would happen in this day the evening
[1:26:56] light produces that he says what a time
[1:26:59] i would say today what a time to be
[1:27:01] alive what a time to be a christian
[1:27:04] what a time to know what we know
[1:27:07] what a time to be called out of
[1:27:08] denominations
[1:27:10] what a time to understand that we don't
[1:27:12] have to die in our sins but we have been
[1:27:15] given authority by the word of god to be
[1:27:17] taken from that denomination and to be
[1:27:20] renewed and to have eternal life we
[1:27:22] ought to be the happiest people on the
[1:27:24] face of the earth to know that we don't
[1:27:26] have to live like the world but we are
[1:27:29] more than conquerors through christ
[1:27:32] he made us free he set us free he has
[1:27:35] taken me from what i was to what i can
[1:27:38] be when i looked there in egypt and i
[1:27:40] saw those people i saw so many of them
[1:27:42] and i saw him bound there was a man come
[1:27:44] forward and he said he'd been living a
[1:27:46] fake christian life for i think 12 or 13
[1:27:49] years and to see that man come forward
[1:27:51] stand up right after the preaching was
[1:27:53] over stood up and says i'm done being a
[1:27:55] fake christian
[1:27:56] it's time for me to be a real christian
[1:27:58] i'll tell you what confession's good for
[1:28:00] the soul maybe you need to tell god say
[1:28:02] lord i'm tired of living the halfway
[1:28:04] life but i'm ready to surrender all to
[1:28:07] you i'm tired of being a halfway
[1:28:09] christian but i'm ready to come forward
[1:28:11] if it takes an altar if it takes me
[1:28:13] snotting and spitting and crying and
[1:28:16] whatever it takes i'm willing to
[1:28:17] surrender my pride so that i can be made
[1:28:20] new i can be restored back
[1:28:23] there is a restoration for you but you
[1:28:26] must accept the restoration
[1:28:28] message
[1:28:30] it is for us
[1:28:31] they waited in the upper room until
[1:28:34] not just until they felt like they'd
[1:28:36] that maybe they felt like well it's time
[1:28:38] to go eat dinner we're done we've been
[1:28:41] here 15 minutes and there's there's no
[1:28:43] rushing mighty wind
[1:28:45] but they weren't given up
[1:28:47] and you know what the great thing about
[1:28:48] it is god knew they weren't giving up
[1:28:50] and he knew it and so he had already
[1:28:53] prepared a great moving and shaking to
[1:28:55] go on in that room and the prophet tells
[1:28:57] us that we must have the same experience
[1:29:01] now you can say and you can try to say
[1:29:03] that was a theological thing all you
[1:29:05] want to you can say it was a little
[1:29:07] breeze that come through you can say
[1:29:09] that i i've been in tent meetings where
[1:29:11] there's been big breezes coming through
[1:29:13] if that was it i don't want it
[1:29:14] big hot air come through the tent and
[1:29:16] and it makes all the stink come from one
[1:29:18] side or the other but let me just tell
[1:29:20] you this i don't want just a little
[1:29:22] breeze i want a rushing mighty wind on
[1:29:24] my life
[1:29:25] i want more than what the denominations
[1:29:28] can offer they can tell you well you can
[1:29:30] speak in tongues and that's good they
[1:29:32] can tell you you can come over here and
[1:29:33] just shake hands and that's good but i
[1:29:35] want something that will make me live
[1:29:36] the christian life i want something that
[1:29:39] will excite me on the inside to when i
[1:29:41] come to church i expect to hear from god
[1:29:44] i don't care who's preaching i don't
[1:29:45] care who's standing there i don't care
[1:29:47] who's here who's not here but i do
[1:29:49] expect to hear from god
[1:29:52] you can look around remember there will
[1:29:53] be distractions
[1:29:55] there will always come distractions
[1:29:56] that's satan's job and he'll come at
[1:29:58] your weakest point
[1:30:00] maybe you don't do maybe you're not a
[1:30:02] sinner but maybe on sunday afternoon you
[1:30:04] have to rush home to watch the ball game
[1:30:06] remember that may be the weakness that
[1:30:08] you have that you have to go against
[1:30:10] maybe that's the area that you have to
[1:30:11] protect because satan is there trying to
[1:30:14] tell you hey hey this is this is okay
[1:30:17] and maybe maybe it's fine
[1:30:19] but remember that may be where he's
[1:30:20] keeping you out of prayer or maybe
[1:30:22] you're not getting much out of the end
[1:30:23] of that service because you got to rush
[1:30:24] off
[1:30:26] maybe he wants you to stay just a little
[1:30:27] bit longer maybe there's something on
[1:30:29] the inside that's talking to you but
[1:30:31] you've quieted that voice
[1:30:33] because of how loud the world has gotten
[1:30:36] but i wonder today if we could quiet
[1:30:38] ourselves enough to hear from the voice
[1:30:40] of god again and he will tell you all
[1:30:43] that i was all that i ever will be i
[1:30:46] give to you
[1:30:47] all the spirit i ever had is in you i he
[1:30:51] separated himself at calvary he said and
[1:30:53] divided himself so that you could be
[1:30:54] part of him
[1:30:56] this is this message is not just to make
[1:30:58] you feel good this is not a message just
[1:31:00] to come and and pump you up but it's
[1:31:03] something that'll change your life
[1:31:05] it's something that'll make you live
[1:31:06] different you'll act different you're a
[1:31:09] different creature it changes your whole
[1:31:11] nature i once was in the pig pen but i
[1:31:14] don't go there no more i don't eat with
[1:31:16] the pigs no more because i went back to
[1:31:18] my father's house
[1:31:20] and at my father's house he had a fatted
[1:31:22] calf for me to eat he had the message of
[1:31:24] the hour there he gave me some new
[1:31:27] clothes i don't have to look like a
[1:31:28] dirty old uh big pen person anymore but
[1:31:32] i've been brought back
[1:31:33] i have been changed into my garments
[1:31:36] that god gave me i have the truth now so
[1:31:39] i don't have to live like the world amen
[1:31:42] there'll be scars
[1:31:44] to overcome
[1:31:46] there'll be things in your life
[1:31:48] that maybe overnight
[1:31:50] won't change
[1:31:52] but if you hear the word of god
[1:31:55] hasten to obey
[1:31:58] run and repent when you need to
[1:32:01] quickly apologize when it's necessary to
[1:32:03] apologize and it's probably a lot more
[1:32:06] than what we do
[1:32:08] quickly
[1:32:09] go to the altar if god's calling you
[1:32:12] don't wait
[1:32:13] if there's something on the inside
[1:32:15] talking to you yield to the voice today
[1:32:18] what is it it's a voice of restoration
[1:32:21] he wants to restore you
[1:32:23] he wants to take you back remember in
[1:32:26] the garden of eden where they could
[1:32:28] musicians go ahead and come i've got to
[1:32:29] quit
[1:32:30] in the in the garden of eden
[1:32:33] there was a communion going on
[1:32:35] and they could sit there and they could
[1:32:36] talk to god and he could talk back to
[1:32:38] him
[1:32:39] but remember
[1:32:40] when eve got out of fellowship and
[1:32:42] started talking
[1:32:43] to the world
[1:32:45] she started
[1:32:46] listening
[1:32:47] to too much tv
[1:32:50] too many worldly voices got in her head
[1:32:54] and it caused her to fall
[1:32:56] there is a message here today
[1:32:58] that is trying to commune with you
[1:33:01] in the stillness in the peace of the
[1:33:03] garden but you're going after something
[1:33:06] flashy
[1:33:07] you're going after something that looks
[1:33:09] good that'll tell you you won't surely
[1:33:11] die
[1:33:12] but i'm here to tell you if you can turn
[1:33:14] back to god
[1:33:16] i believe you are ordained to not fall
[1:33:19] like the first eve i believe there's
[1:33:21] something that will stop you before you
[1:33:24] ever get that far
[1:33:25] there is something that will keep you in
[1:33:27] the days we're living in can somebody
[1:33:30] say amen today there's something here
[1:33:32] that can keep you there is a holy ghost
[1:33:34] here today they didn't have the holy
[1:33:36] ghost then they had to rely on a
[1:33:37] sacrifice but today if you can accept
[1:33:40] the holy ghost in your life it will keep
[1:33:42] you and seal you until the day of your
[1:33:44] redemption
[1:33:46] there's nothing that can make you fall
[1:33:48] this is a restoration message if you
[1:33:50] believe it can you stand to your feet
[1:33:52] this afternoon
[1:33:54] with every head bowed
[1:33:57] i believe it's a promise
[1:33:59] that there's a restoration message
[1:34:02] but we don't have to look for it in this
[1:34:04] hour
[1:34:05] the restoration message is here
[1:34:09] can you believe it today
[1:34:12] if there's something hindering
[1:34:14] the voice of god that's trying to speak
[1:34:15] to you
[1:34:16] i challenge you today
[1:34:19] to go back to where you lost your first
[1:34:21] love
[1:34:22] and find out
[1:34:24] what you need to do in your own life
[1:34:27] to get you back in fellowship with god
[1:34:30] say lord i need a renewing of your
[1:34:31] spirit
[1:34:33] i need a refilling of the holy ghost
