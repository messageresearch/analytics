[1:21:26] the book of St Mark the 16th chapter and
[1:21:29] I want to begin reading in the 14th
[1:21:31] verse and I want to maybe make a
[1:21:33] statement here the prophet of God uh
[1:21:35] said so it maybe put a little bit of a
[1:21:37] understanding in your heart he said now
[1:21:40] the last words speaking of Mark 16:14
[1:21:42] to20 he said these are the last words
[1:21:45] that ever fell from the lips of our
[1:21:47] beloved savior he said it was the final
[1:21:50] words to his church Universal all right
[1:21:54] in mark
[1:21:55] 16:14 afterward he appeared unto the 11
[1:21:58] as they set at meat and up braided them
[1:22:01] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[1:22:02] Heart because they believed not them
[1:22:05] which had seen him after he was risen
[1:22:08] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:22:11] world and preach the gospel thank to
[1:22:15] Every Creature for he that believeth and
[1:22:17] is and now watch he that believeth and
[1:22:19] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:22:24] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:22:26] signs shall follow them that believe all
[1:22:29] right in my name they shall cast out
[1:22:31] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:22:34] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:22:36] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:22:39] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:22:44] and they shall recover so then after the
[1:22:47] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:22:49] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:22:52] right hand of God now watch and they
[1:22:54] went forth and preached everywhere the
[1:22:57] Lord working with them and confirming
[1:23:01] the word with signs following amen now
[1:23:04] in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4
[1:23:07] the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and
[1:23:10] I want to read the 13th verse 2
[1:23:13] Corinthians chapter 4 Amen in verse
[1:23:15] number 13 you know there we read about
[1:23:18] the Lord amen speaking to his disciples
[1:23:21] and here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and:
[1:23:23] 13 Paul writing he says now we having
[1:23:27] the same Spirit of faith I love that
[1:23:30] there's not many faiths but there's only
[1:23:32] one faith we having the same Spirit of
[1:23:35] Faith according as it is written I
[1:23:39] believed and therefore I have I spoken
[1:23:43] now we also believe and therefore we
[1:23:46] speak so there is a direct connection
[1:23:49] between what you're believing and what
[1:23:51] you're speaking I have received what the
[1:23:53] Lord spoke spoke and therefore what I
[1:23:55] believe he spoke is what I speak also
[1:23:58] amen we ask the Lord this evening to add
[1:24:00] the blessing to the reading of his word
[1:24:01] as you can have your seats here this
[1:24:03] afternoon I want to for just a few
[1:24:05] moments to speak to you tonight if I
[1:24:07] title this I want to speak to you on the
[1:24:09] Vindicated method of God the Vindicated
[1:24:13] method of God I want to amen maybe begin
[1:24:16] tonight by just saying this thank God
[1:24:19] for Vindication amen thank God for
[1:24:22] Vindication when you look at that word
[1:24:24] Vindication it means to show or to prove
[1:24:27] to be right now we don't just have
[1:24:30] Vindication amen but we have Divine
[1:24:33] Vindication we're not just here
[1:24:35] rejoicing because something has been
[1:24:37] Vindicated once or somebody thought it
[1:24:39] was Vindicated but no we have Divine
[1:24:42] Vindication brother said we do have
[1:24:44] today by God's help amen the perfect
[1:24:47] interpretation of the word amen with
[1:24:50] Divine Vindication we have today we're
[1:24:53] not looking for we're not waiting on it
[1:24:56] we're not trying to find it amen but we
[1:24:58] have today the perfect interpretation of
[1:25:01] the word with Divine Vindication said
[1:25:04] but as it's been in every age people let
[1:25:07] man amen put their own interpretation to
[1:25:09] it by Theology and will not believe
[1:25:12] God's Divine Vindication amen of it see
[1:25:15] that's God's interpretation so now amen
[1:25:19] God's interpretation is the perfect
[1:25:21] interpretation amen and it's also a
[1:25:23] divine Vindication he said not what I
[1:25:26] say or what somebody else says amen but
[1:25:29] what God has promised and the what God
[1:25:31] is doing amen proves that it's God doing
[1:25:34] his own interpreting of his word now
[1:25:37] amen to just lay a foundation tonight
[1:25:39] amen where I'm drawing the inspiration
[1:25:41] from this and the greatest battle ever
[1:25:42] fought brother BR said Satan's Army
[1:25:44] brings diseases amen but God's Army is
[1:25:48] commission to cast them out amen the
[1:25:50] devil brings them but God's Army is
[1:25:53] commissioned to cast them out out amen
[1:25:55] every time Satan throws any Onto You
[1:25:58] amen God's Army is to cast him out amen
[1:26:01] amen cast out see that's the very
[1:26:04] technique that God used amen Satan used
[1:26:07] the army of Destruction to disbelieve
[1:26:10] God's word and set him up a better
[1:26:12] Kingdom than Michael had amen and God
[1:26:15] cast him out he said so God's method is
[1:26:19] cast out the evil amen I love that not
[1:26:21] make room for it not make excuses for it
[1:26:24] amen but God's method is to cast out the
[1:26:27] evil Amen to cast down reasoning to cast
[1:26:30] down Superstition to cast down worry to
[1:26:33] cast down diseases to cast down sin amen
[1:26:36] you are above it see amen resurrected in
[1:26:40] Christ Jesus and you are sitting in
[1:26:42] Heavenly places with every devil under
[1:26:45] your foot amen now listen that is not in
[1:26:48] the future amen and neither is that in
[1:26:50] the past of the days amen when brother
[1:26:53] Brandon was up on the Earth amen but we
[1:26:55] are the army of the Living God Amen and
[1:26:58] if we are the army of God then we have
[1:27:00] received a commission of God Amen and
[1:27:02] our commission is not to put up with the
[1:27:04] devil amen but our commission is to cast
[1:27:08] out the devil I love what Paul says he
[1:27:10] says see neither give place to the devil
[1:27:14] when you look at that word place it
[1:27:15] means room or quarter or Coast amen
[1:27:18] opportunity or power amen occasion for
[1:27:21] acting so what Paul is saying amen don't
[1:27:24] you give any room to the devil don't you
[1:27:26] give the devil an opportunity Amen to
[1:27:29] manifest himself in the destruction amen
[1:27:32] that he's come to manifest himself in he
[1:27:34] says see in other words Paul is saying
[1:27:37] amen resist the devil I love what James
[1:27:40] said he said if you will submit yourself
[1:27:42] unto God Amen and resist the devil amen
[1:27:46] he will flee from you you know what that
[1:27:49] word resist means it means to set
[1:27:51] oneself against it means to withstand it
[1:27:54] means to resist or to oppose you know I
[1:27:57] believe it's high time as the Church of
[1:27:59] the Living God Amen to stop backing up
[1:28:01] to spirits and stop backing up to demons
[1:28:03] and stop backing up to doctrines of
[1:28:05] devils amen but God has sent a message
[1:28:08] in this generation and it's not a man's
[1:28:11] message it's a Vindicated message and it
[1:28:13] is a message that there set yourself
[1:28:16] Amen in the position as a son and a
[1:28:18] daughter of God Amen don't you give the
[1:28:21] devil any room we're taught in James 4:7
[1:28:24] resist the devil amen just won't walk
[1:28:26] away but he'll flee amen how do you
[1:28:28] resist the devil the same way that our
[1:28:31] chief Captain told us to do it amen
[1:28:34] that's to take the word of
[1:28:37] God that's how you resist the devil is
[1:28:40] by the word of God another place when
[1:28:43] Satan gets a raging around amen we quote
[1:28:46] the scripture to him amen Jesus said
[1:28:49] amen resist the devil and he will flee
[1:28:51] from you somebody said well you just
[1:28:53] quote the scripture amen but can I ask
[1:28:55] you something amen they were doing that
[1:28:57] for 2,000 years amen and had questions
[1:29:00] on top of questions amen but in this
[1:29:02] generation amen God has sent the perfect
[1:29:06] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:29:08] Vindication listen we're not just
[1:29:10] quoting scripture amen we're quoting
[1:29:12] interpreted scripture we're not just
[1:29:14] quoting a bunch of quotes amen but what
[1:29:17] we're saying has come from God through
[1:29:19] the lips of the seventh angel and
[1:29:21] tonight when Jesus is Among Us said the
[1:29:24] devil's trying to hinder the meeting
[1:29:26] amen just as hard as he could he will do
[1:29:29] that to every God sent meeting he said
[1:29:31] but you stand Toe to Toe with him and
[1:29:34] you say Amen if you're going to resist
[1:29:37] the devil you got to quote the word now
[1:29:39] come on and then you say Amen thus saith
[1:29:43] the Lord hey thus sayith the Lord he
[1:29:46] said resist the devil and he will flee
[1:29:48] from you now what does his word do it
[1:29:51] builds up our spiritual body been making
[1:29:54] us strong as we commune with him to
[1:29:58] resist the devil if you wonder how to
[1:30:00] resist the devil I just give you God's
[1:30:03] Vindicated method Amen on resisting the
[1:30:06] devil and it's by the quoting of the
[1:30:08] word of God Amen and the standing on
[1:30:11] thus sayith the Lord I'll say tonight
[1:30:13] God's Vindicated method amen comes by
[1:30:16] his word now when you look at this word
[1:30:18] method it is a particular form amen or
[1:30:21] procedure for accomplishing amen or
[1:30:24] approaching something it is especially a
[1:30:26] systematic or established one it is a
[1:30:29] way it is a technique or a process amen
[1:30:33] of or for doing something amen it is a
[1:30:36] body of skills amen that's why the devil
[1:30:39] hates you amen because you're more than
[1:30:41] just church members amen but was in
[1:30:43] God's mind has now come into God's
[1:30:46] church and you are the bride body of
[1:30:48] Jesus Christ you are carrying the
[1:30:51] techniques you are carrying the way you
[1:30:54] carrying the skills Amen to defeat the
[1:30:56] Devil anywhere any time any place under
[1:31:00] any condition amen I love that Word
[1:31:02] Method but I also love another word amen
[1:31:05] way which brother Ram teaches us amen
[1:31:07] that God has a provided way for
[1:31:10] everything I'm thankful to know tonight
[1:31:12] that God Amen has a method of doing
[1:31:15] things we're not just haphazardly
[1:31:17] shooting at something we're not just
[1:31:19] throwing something out there amen but
[1:31:22] God has come down in this gener ation
[1:31:24] and he has Vindicated that the preaching
[1:31:27] of the message of the hour amen is the
[1:31:29] authority of God on every scripture Amen
[1:31:32] to defeat the Devil now when you look at
[1:31:35] this this approach brother say it very
[1:31:37] beautiful he said God has an a provided
[1:31:40] approach he said see God's first method
[1:31:43] of approach Amen to himself for the
[1:31:45] people amen was through the shedding of
[1:31:48] blood now listen it has been from that
[1:31:50] day amen until this day amen the same
[1:31:54] thing so from the day that God
[1:31:56] established the shedding of blood for
[1:31:59] the saving of the soul of a human human
[1:32:01] it has not changeed and I go ahead and
[1:32:03] say it and never will it change amen
[1:32:06] there's not one thing you can do to save
[1:32:08] yourself when God provide something amen
[1:32:11] you've got to solom me trust amen the
[1:32:14] grace of God you have to accept his
[1:32:16] provided method amen and that is Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ see it's freely you don't have to
[1:32:22] do one thing but just accept amen what's
[1:32:25] already been given to you I'll say this
[1:32:28] God Amen has a Vindicated method amen of
[1:32:31] bringing his word now can I just preach
[1:32:34] a minute amen it's through the channel
[1:32:37] or the office of a Vindicated Prophet
[1:32:40] the Bible says in Amos 3:7 that surely
[1:32:42] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[1:32:44] revealeth his Secrets amen unto his
[1:32:47] servants the prophets in Hebrews chapter
[1:32:49] 1 God in sunnd times and diverse manners
[1:32:52] wrote the Bible amen by the prophets now
[1:32:55] notice he wrote the Bible by his own
[1:32:57] chosen way the way he chose amen he
[1:33:00] didn't have to write it that way and
[1:33:02] neither did he have to save Man by Blood
[1:33:04] he didn't have to preach the gospel by
[1:33:06] man he could let the Sun or the moon or
[1:33:08] the Stars preach the gospel he could
[1:33:10] have let the winds come the gospel amen
[1:33:13] but he chose man think about that he
[1:33:16] could have chose the wind to HT Malachi
[1:33:18] 4 he could have chose the trees to quote
[1:33:21] Revelation 10 but he chose man who had
[1:33:24] faults and failures amen but God was not
[1:33:27] looking at the man on the basis of
[1:33:29] Education he was looking at man on the
[1:33:32] basis of the blood because all the way
[1:33:34] back in the beginning he established a
[1:33:36] way to approach him and that was not for
[1:33:39] your education that was not through your
[1:33:41] church standing that was not for your C
[1:33:43] oh come on that was not for your culture
[1:33:46] it was through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:49] he chose his way the way his word would
[1:33:51] come and that was by his prophets which
[1:33:54] were predestinated and for ordained
[1:33:57] being a part of God's word now what were
[1:34:00] they doing they were declaring the
[1:34:02] revelation of his word amen to that age
[1:34:05] and that time now the Bible said the
[1:34:07] word of God Amen it came to the prophets
[1:34:10] only never does it come to a
[1:34:12] theologian show me a scripture it comes
[1:34:15] only to prophets so God wrote the Bible
[1:34:18] amen by his chosen method and by his own
[1:34:22] chosen prophets amen not the prophets
[1:34:24] man had chose amen but the prophets that
[1:34:27] God had chose another place see the
[1:34:30] prophet always amen points back to the
[1:34:32] great Supernatural God Amen a real
[1:34:35] prophet of God that's a real preacher
[1:34:38] amen In a Pulpit now I know we got a lot
[1:34:40] of ideas today but let's forget the
[1:34:42] ideas and let's just come back to what a
[1:34:44] prophet said if you believe what a
[1:34:47] prophet said you will find yourself in
[1:34:49] the pews whenever the church doors are
[1:34:51] open and if you're a God called Creature
[1:34:54] if you believe what the prophet said
[1:34:56] when the Lord inspires the word to your
[1:34:58] heart you will find yourself in the
[1:35:00] pullit amen standing Toe to Toe with the
[1:35:03] devil and preaching the perfect
[1:35:05] interpretation with Divine Vindication
[1:35:08] I'll just go and say and I think it's
[1:35:09] time amen we get the oldfashioned gospel
[1:35:12] of going back to church back among our
[1:35:14] young people it's not where people come
[1:35:17] and they go and say please if they don't
[1:35:19] like this they go that hey but come back
[1:35:21] to the message of the hour and the
[1:35:23] message of the hour says forsake not the
[1:35:26] assembling of yourselves together as you
[1:35:30] see the day approaching and if a real
[1:35:32] true prophet of God stands in the pull
[1:35:34] pit he will say exactly what William
[1:35:37] brandham said on those tapes and the
[1:35:39] same P of fire that stood with him will
[1:35:42] come among the church again and will
[1:35:44] vindicate what he's saying because it's
[1:35:46] already already
[1:35:49] Vindicated so a real true Prophet will
[1:35:53] point back back to the word which is the
[1:35:55] promise of the Lord amen not the
[1:35:57] Declaration that the church has made
[1:36:00] amen but a declaration that God has made
[1:36:03] see then you are not here amen as just
[1:36:05] church members amen but you are here as
[1:36:08] believers who God has claimed Amen to
[1:36:11] believe him by the Declarations that the
[1:36:14] Vindicated Prophet made let me just say
[1:36:16] this the Vindicated method of God is
[1:36:19] never changing
[1:36:21] am it is always the same if you put it
[1:36:24] in Africa it's the same if you put it in
[1:36:27] India it's the same if you put it up in
[1:36:29] Canada it's the same if you put it in
[1:36:32] Europe it's the same if you bring it to
[1:36:34] Arkansas it's the same if you take it to
[1:36:36] Oklahoma it's the same come on church
[1:36:39] amen this ain't a man's message this is
[1:36:41] the King's message and you know what I
[1:36:43] think it's high time to do I think it's
[1:36:46] time to remember it ain't about a
[1:36:47] preacher and it ain't about a church it
[1:36:49] ain't about a kingdom it's about the
[1:36:51] Lord Jesus Christ and he's the same
[1:36:54] yesterday today and forever and as the
[1:36:57] Bride of Jesus Christ we welcome the
[1:37:00] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost AM me to move
[1:37:03] in the church once again it ain't about
[1:37:05] a man it's about the son of man it's
[1:37:08] about the King of Kings it's about the
[1:37:10] prophets of prophets it's about the word
[1:37:14] and it never changes God said I'm the
[1:37:16] Lord and I change not therefore ye sons
[1:37:19] of Jacob amen you are not consumed amen
[1:37:22] now watch this it taken 4,000 years to
[1:37:26] make a masterpiece he's been nearly
[1:37:28] 2,000 years and then making another
[1:37:31] Masterpiece which is a bride for Christ
[1:37:34] in so doing it he does it by his never
[1:37:37] changing method amen the same way he
[1:37:40] made the Masterpiece his word somebody
[1:37:43] shout he cannot change can I say this
[1:37:46] man changes and time changes and ages
[1:37:49] changes and dispensation changes but
[1:37:52] somebody shouted from from the rooftops
[1:37:54] but God Remains the Same that's a
[1:37:58] glorious shout Point Church it don't
[1:38:00] matter how you feel it don't matter what
[1:38:03] you're going through it don't matter
[1:38:04] what mood the church is in if you just
[1:38:07] get the word among the Believers the
[1:38:10] word is the
[1:38:12] same my goodness then God works by his
[1:38:15] word amen and his word is his Vindicated
[1:38:18] method somebody say God God never
[1:38:21] changes the church has changed
[1:38:24] but God never changes amen friendships
[1:38:26] change but God never changes I might as
[1:38:30] well say it preachers change amen but
[1:38:32] God never changes churches will change
[1:38:35] on you amen but God will never change
[1:38:38] somebody say well what are you trying to
[1:38:39] tie the church to I'm trying to tie you
[1:38:42] to the message of the hour it's been in
[1:38:45] the jungles of Africa it's been in the
[1:38:47] Huts of India it's been in the skin come
[1:38:49] on it's been in the witch doctors and
[1:38:52] there's nothing ever defeated this
[1:38:55] message it's God's Divine way to bring
[1:38:58] Faith into the church what is it it's
[1:39:00] not some man-made Theory it's something
[1:39:02] not some group of men amen comes
[1:39:04] together and makes up it's his
[1:39:06] unchangeable word somebody say well amen
[1:39:09] you need to ask brother so and so about
[1:39:11] this and ask brother so and so about
[1:39:12] that and ask brother so no I got
[1:39:15] tapes I got my own tapes in my own books
[1:39:18] and brother so and so might change
[1:39:20] tomorrow amen but the message will never
[1:39:22] change what a prophet tgh about the
[1:39:25] godhead it's the truth what he Tau about
[1:39:27] water baptism it's the truth what he Tau
[1:39:30] about Holiness it's the truth what he T
[1:39:32] about church order it's the truth what
[1:39:35] he T about the gifts it's the truth it
[1:39:37] don't matter where you put this message
[1:39:40] it will be the
[1:39:42] truth yes sir because the word of God
[1:39:45] Amen runs in continuity and never has he
[1:39:48] changed his method he said we've tried
[1:39:50] to educate them into it we've tried to
[1:39:52] denominate into it we've tried to beg
[1:39:55] them into it we've tried to beat them
[1:39:57] into it we've tried to shout them into
[1:39:59] it and it still Remains the Same the
[1:40:02] shed blood amen only is where God Amen
[1:40:06] meets a Believer if somebody begs you
[1:40:09] into it somebody will beg you out if
[1:40:11] somebody shouts you into it somebody
[1:40:14] will shout you out if somebody sings you
[1:40:16] into it somebody will sing you out amen
[1:40:19] but if you ever come underneath the
[1:40:21] Wonder working blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:24] it'll never move it'll never change
[1:40:27] that's why I can shout tonight it's CU
[1:40:29] all my sins are under the blood of Jesus
[1:40:32] Christ and there's Wonder workking power
[1:40:35] in that blood yes sir yes sir he is the
[1:40:39] word and the bride has become the word I
[1:40:42] love it because Malachi 4 amen comes to
[1:40:44] deal with a heart which the prophet of
[1:40:46] God said each individual Amen in his
[1:40:49] heart he must be that one with God so
[1:40:52] the message of Malachi 4 amen comes to
[1:40:55] deal with a heart amen which is to turn
[1:40:58] the heart to God in John 6:45 Jesus said
[1:41:01] it very beautiful he said it is written
[1:41:03] in the prophets and they shall be taught
[1:41:06] of God every man therefore that hath
[1:41:08] heard and hath learned of the father
[1:41:11] amen cometh unto me so here the here the
[1:41:14] Lord Jesus is saying if you're going to
[1:41:16] come unto the father you're going to
[1:41:18] come by me but you're going to come by
[1:41:20] what you've heard and what you've
[1:41:22] learned somebody say we don't need no
[1:41:24] teaching amen well that's a that's an
[1:41:25] old Pentecostal idea Amen to give a
[1:41:28] bunch of Liberty to gifts to leave the
[1:41:30] church but I say the headship of this
[1:41:32] bride amen is the message of the hour
[1:41:35] and we need the teaching of what a
[1:41:37] seventh angel Tau Amen to come into our
[1:41:40] hearts and to marry us to Christ the
[1:41:42] word yes sir being one with the word
[1:41:45] proves amen whether you are of God and
[1:41:48] spirit fill there is no other
[1:41:51] criteria come on you know what that word
[1:41:54] criteria means it is a standard for
[1:41:56] judging something which is established
[1:41:59] by Authority so Authority will establish
[1:42:01] a standard and when that standard is
[1:42:04] established amen God forbid anybody ever
[1:42:07] change it that's why Prophet come among
[1:42:09] the church and said God's criteria for
[1:42:12] his church amen is his word amen it's
[1:42:15] not the Greek Orthodox it's not the
[1:42:17] Roman Catholic it's not the Pentecostal
[1:42:20] come on we might as well preach we're
[1:42:21] all the way out here amen not the seven
[1:42:23] Thunders or the return Ministry or or no
[1:42:26] no no there's only one standard that God
[1:42:29] has established as the Judgment of the
[1:42:31] church and that is his word now the
[1:42:34] Bible he says is the entire revelation
[1:42:37] of Jesus Christ amen this is the
[1:42:39] Revelation I want to say tonight that
[1:42:42] Satan amen hates Revelation he hates it
[1:42:45] amen he hates the revelation of Jesus
[1:42:48] Christ amen in the church and he hates
[1:42:51] that the church knows that Jesus Christ
[1:42:53] is Hebrews
[1:42:55] 138 come on he hates that Revelation
[1:42:59] because he knows amen that the whole lot
[1:43:01] more than 90% of the theologians do he
[1:43:04] knows that since God Amen is immutable
[1:43:07] in his nature then he is immutable in
[1:43:09] his ways you know the problem God uses
[1:43:12] this term in the church age book he
[1:43:14] calls it persuad scientist amen and
[1:43:16] liberal theologians now you all know
[1:43:19] amen we're living in a day and time
[1:43:20] where the world is divided amen between
[1:43:22] liberal and conservatives am and they
[1:43:25] take the Bible liberal theologians amen
[1:43:28] they take the Bible and they make it a
[1:43:30] liberal book that's why you got women in
[1:43:32] the pullit that's why you got men
[1:43:34] wearing shorts that's why oh come on now
[1:43:37] that's why you got Bob haired women in
[1:43:38] pets he got deacons married five times
[1:43:41] and he got women telling the husbands
[1:43:43] how to run the house come on y'all know
[1:43:45] I'm telling the truth amen because
[1:43:47] because liberal theologians got a hold
[1:43:49] of God's word and they watered it down
[1:43:51] to some liberal approach am but let's go
[1:43:53] ahead and go the other side amen you got
[1:43:55] conservative theologians that took the
[1:43:57] same book and made a bunch of legalism
[1:44:00] out of it and beat the life of God out
[1:44:02] of the church and now the young people's
[1:44:04] dried up and half the church is dried up
[1:44:06] but I say come back to the message of
[1:44:09] the Hour come back to the preaching of
[1:44:12] the word of God underneath the filter of
[1:44:15] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 I say clean
[1:44:18] up the
[1:44:19] church hey it's good to see you brother
[1:44:21] Josh I say clean up the church I say
[1:44:23] bring the liberty of God Amen to come
[1:44:26] back in the church until the power of
[1:44:28] God can fall among the church again and
[1:44:31] can bring a real true Revelation I'm not
[1:44:33] looking for emotion I'm not looking for
[1:44:35] excitement I'm looking for Revelation
[1:44:38] because Revelation is the only thing
[1:44:40] that'll whip the
[1:44:43] devil come on somebody it's the only
[1:44:46] thing that will whip the devil you say
[1:44:48] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:44:50] about God who is not liberal and neither
[1:44:52] is he conserv
[1:44:54] well come on somebody amen if you come
[1:44:56] to sit on the meeting I pray God Amen
[1:44:58] get a hold of you and Shake You P out of
[1:44:59] your seat this ain't a liberal meeting
[1:45:02] and neither is it a conservative meeting
[1:45:04] this ain't a Democrat convention it
[1:45:06] ain't a republican convention it's a
[1:45:08] gathering of eagles and wherever the
[1:45:10] carcass is and then there will the
[1:45:12] Eagles be gathered together come on
[1:45:15] church I say bring back the message in
[1:45:17] the power of the Holy Ghost and let it
[1:45:20] Liberate the church again to serve God
[1:45:23] and love God yes sir th Satan knows ass
[1:45:27] surely that the original church at
[1:45:29] Pentecost with the power of God the
[1:45:31] devil knows this amen Mark 16 and action
[1:45:35] is the true church it's the true church
[1:45:38] that claims that Jesus claims as his own
[1:45:42] all else is
[1:45:44] false now that's not my words that's
[1:45:46] perfect interpretation with Divine
[1:45:49] Vindication yes sir all else is false it
[1:45:53] has to be so then what do we know Mark
[1:45:55] 16 as we know it as the Great Commission
[1:45:58] look at this word commission it is an
[1:46:00] instruction it is a command it is a duty
[1:46:03] given Amen to a person or to a group of
[1:46:06] people it's a group of people who are
[1:46:09] officially charged oh
[1:46:11] my with a particular function they are
[1:46:14] given an order for or authorize amen the
[1:46:18] production of something amen such as a
[1:46:20] building amen or a work of art now you
[1:46:23] all know that brother brandom said that
[1:46:25] I've not come Amen to build
[1:46:27] denominations I've not come to build
[1:46:29] organizations he said I have come Amen
[1:46:32] to build powerhouses unto the Lord Jesus
[1:46:34] Christ then this message amen is the
[1:46:37] building of a Powerhouse under the
[1:46:40] authority of the word of God Mark 16
[1:46:43] said it very beautiful he says now go ye
[1:46:46] into all the world Amen and preach the
[1:46:49] gospel to Every Creature you say what is
[1:46:51] this word gospel well the the Bible
[1:46:53] speaks amen of the Gospel the gospel of
[1:46:56] Christ The Gospel of God Amen the gospel
[1:46:58] of the kingdom in the Greek definition
[1:47:00] gospel amen is Good Tidings it means to
[1:47:03] bring good things among the church you
[1:47:05] know I think it's time to get back to
[1:47:06] bringing some good things among the
[1:47:08] church we got enough bad things and
[1:47:10] negative things and sad things amen
[1:47:13] let's just start bringing some good
[1:47:15] things and here's what the Bible said
[1:47:17] it's after the death of Christ amen the
[1:47:20] term compromises also amen the preach in
[1:47:23] of or concerning Jesus Christ amen is
[1:47:26] having suffered the death on the cross
[1:47:27] to procure Eternal salvation for the men
[1:47:30] in the kingdom of God but as restored to
[1:47:32] life and exalted to the right hand of
[1:47:35] God in heaven amen fence to return in M
[1:47:38] Majesty Amen to consummate the kingdom
[1:47:40] of God so that it may be briefly defined
[1:47:43] amen as the Glad Tidings of Salvation
[1:47:45] through Christ it is the proclamation of
[1:47:48] the grace of God made manifest and
[1:47:51] pledged in Christ and he sums all of
[1:47:53] that up into one word brother Cliffy
[1:47:56] sums all that up into one word and he
[1:47:58] calls it the
[1:48:00] gospel my goodness brother Danny amen
[1:48:03] the proclamation that Jesus was born and
[1:48:05] that he lived and that he died and that
[1:48:08] he was buried and that he rose again and
[1:48:10] that he Whi the devil amen all the way
[1:48:12] from the pits of Hell to the throne of
[1:48:15] God all that Majesty All That Glory is
[1:48:18] summed up into one word and it's called
[1:48:21] The Gospel woo brother brother said then
[1:48:25] what is the highest form Amen to get the
[1:48:27] message to the people he said the
[1:48:29] preaching of the Gospel is the highest
[1:48:32] form the highest form to bring the
[1:48:35] message to the people is the preaching
[1:48:38] of the Gospel then if you notice the
[1:48:40] Bible places it amen first apostles
[1:48:43] secondary prophets and so forth then on
[1:48:46] down into the non spiritual gifts amen
[1:48:48] operating in every local body so the
[1:48:51] highest form of bringing the message is
[1:48:53] the preaching of the Gospel but you know
[1:48:56] what else he ties with that he says the
[1:48:58] highest office in the world Amen they've
[1:49:01] got to be right because we're standing
[1:49:03] here amen holding the highest office
[1:49:06] that's held in the world Amen and that
[1:49:08] is a minister amen a minister and the
[1:49:11] most truthful and right accurate we must
[1:49:14] be that way we must depend Amen on God
[1:49:17] to do it let me say this the day a man
[1:49:20] takes a pullit amen dependent on educ
[1:49:23] and depending on the feeling of the
[1:49:24] church and depending on what somebody
[1:49:26] thinks about it amen to help us soul is
[1:49:29] a day we might as well turn off the
[1:49:30] lights and padlock the doors if we're
[1:49:33] going to have church we need God on the
[1:49:35] pul pits we need God on the musicians we
[1:49:37] need God on the pebes we need God in the
[1:49:40] back room listen we need God from the
[1:49:42] front door to the
[1:49:44] back come on somebody am then church
[1:49:47] ain't about a man it's about God I'll
[1:49:49] tell you then if that wonderful
[1:49:50] consummation of everything that Jesus
[1:49:53] done for us amen is summed up into one
[1:49:55] word amen the gospel amen I just love
[1:49:58] this y'all y'all just forgive me for a
[1:49:59] second amen it's it's real simple okay
[1:50:02] brother Josh it says these two words go
[1:50:04] preach if you look in the Bible amen
[1:50:07] next to Mark 16 it sums all that up into
[1:50:10] word word one word the gospel and then
[1:50:12] brother W says go preach you know what
[1:50:15] Jesus said he said as you go amen preach
[1:50:19] amen saying I find this amazing he said
[1:50:21] say and not play
[1:50:27] he said saying amen the Kingdom of
[1:50:30] Heaven is at hand look at Matthew 20:27
[1:50:33] when I tell you in darkness that you
[1:50:35] speak in light and what you hear in the
[1:50:37] ear that you preach upon the housetops
[1:50:39] in Luke 9 Jesus said I give you power
[1:50:42] and authority over all devils and to
[1:50:44] cure diseases watch and he sent them
[1:50:47] amen to preach the kingdom of God and to
[1:50:50] heal the sick listen he said let the
[1:50:52] dead bury the dead amen but you go th
[1:50:55] and preach amen you go th and declare
[1:50:59] amen the kingdom of God God said it like
[1:51:01] this through the Apostle in Acts 5 go
[1:51:04] amen stand and speak in the temple to
[1:51:06] the people all the words of this life
[1:51:10] listen friends the preaching of the
[1:51:12] Gospel is the success of the church he
[1:51:15] said lies within the preaching of the
[1:51:17] Gospel of the power of God and the
[1:51:20] demonstration of the spirit now I know
[1:51:22] some people they like to dig into things
[1:51:24] and go places with things brother BR
[1:51:26] never
[1:51:26] went and they like to take quotes like
[1:51:29] well we don't need a we don't need a new
[1:51:31] church what we need is to go back to the
[1:51:32] mission corners or and listen brother
[1:51:35] Brandon was only saying something there
[1:51:37] what he was saying was a he he conducted
[1:51:39] his oh I'm getting in trouble he
[1:51:41] conducted his own building project in
[1:51:44] Jeffersonville and added on to the
[1:51:46] sanctuary what he was saying amen is we
[1:51:49] move the success of the church away from
[1:51:51] the preaching the gospel and the power
[1:51:54] and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:56] and we put it on buildings and programs
[1:51:59] and who can do this and who can do that
[1:52:01] but a Prophet come and said if you want
[1:52:03] a successful church amen then come back
[1:52:06] to the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:52:09] Christ and the power of God and the
[1:52:11] salvation and the demonstration of the
[1:52:13] spirit you know why because the
[1:52:15] commission am met the Great Commission
[1:52:18] it did not come before the resurrection
[1:52:20] but it came after the resurrection which
[1:52:23] means it was established in the power of
[1:52:26] the Resurrection if somebody tells you
[1:52:28] to do something and they've never had a
[1:52:30] twoo fake are you going to believe them
[1:52:32] to do it but if somebody who was born
[1:52:35] and lived 33 and A2 years and hung up on
[1:52:37] a cross and died the most crucifying
[1:52:40] death could be died and he went into the
[1:52:42] grave for three days but he arose on the
[1:52:45] third day and he appears unto you and
[1:52:47] says go preach this gospel go tell the
[1:52:50] Glad Tidings are you going to believe
[1:52:52] somebody like that I say yes I'll
[1:52:55] believe somebody that can be died and be
[1:52:58] buried and can raise again because all
[1:53:01] power is behind this commission I say
[1:53:04] tonight Satan I rebuke you in the name
[1:53:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ who has called
[1:53:09] us to preach this
[1:53:12] gospel my goodness it wasn't somebody
[1:53:14] that just had a toothache on the way to
[1:53:16] church it was somebody that knew what
[1:53:18] they were talking about brother said the
[1:53:20] Great Commission was after he rose from
[1:53:22] the dead every creature was to hear the
[1:53:25] gospel that's the Comm condition this
[1:53:27] morning of the church that every
[1:53:29] creature shall hear the gospel I say oh
[1:53:33] God help us that every preacher and
[1:53:35] every son and daughter of God does not
[1:53:38] hear who don't like us and does not hear
[1:53:40] who's against us but they hear the
[1:53:42] Gospel of Jesus Christ in the power of
[1:53:45] the
[1:53:46] Resurrection come on bring some good
[1:53:48] things among the church bring some Glad
[1:53:50] Tidings among the church that's when
[1:53:53] every creature has heard the gospel then
[1:53:56] Jesus will return again you know what I
[1:53:58] love about that is they don't all have
[1:53:59] to hear
[1:54:00] me but they do have to hear the gospel
[1:54:04] they don't all have to hear any of these
[1:54:05] preachers but they do have to hear the
[1:54:07] gospel because the gospel is not a man
[1:54:10] it's the power of God and salvation it's
[1:54:13] the power of the Resurrection that's why
[1:54:15] a man that is Commission of God he looks
[1:54:17] upward and he looks onward you don't
[1:54:19] have to care what the world says about
[1:54:21] it he's not listening to the world he's
[1:54:24] got a Divine commission from God and he
[1:54:27] is enjoying the presence of almighty God
[1:54:31] somebody say preacher why amen are you
[1:54:33] up there so excited and rejoicing
[1:54:35] because I didn't come here under the
[1:54:37] commission of some preacher I come here
[1:54:39] under a Divine Commission of Mark the
[1:54:42] 16th chapter and he said if I'll go and
[1:54:44] say what he said he will heal the sick
[1:54:47] he will save the Lost he will refal the
[1:54:49] empty he will cast out Devils come on
[1:54:52] church we are a powerful force of people
[1:54:55] not because of a church we go to or a
[1:54:57] man we listen to because of the
[1:55:03] Gospel yes sir has the Great Commission
[1:55:05] I know what the devil says the devil
[1:55:07] loves to say things like well the Great
[1:55:09] Commission hadn't reached this day but
[1:55:11] really brother wend that's a lie because
[1:55:13] the prophet asked the question he said
[1:55:15] has the Great Commission reached down to
[1:55:18] this day I love his words brother Maddie
[1:55:20] says certainly certainly certainly if
[1:55:23] anybody tells you God ain't still saving
[1:55:26] I'll tell you how to answer him you're a
[1:55:28] liar if anybody tells you God ain't
[1:55:30] still performing Miracles I'll tell you
[1:55:32] how to answer them you are a liar
[1:55:34] because the Bible said that Mark 16
[1:55:37] would be an action until the day that
[1:55:40] Jesus returns to claim his
[1:55:42] bride yes sir certainly then how long to
[1:55:46] all the world to how many to Every
[1:55:48] Creature to believe is to accept eternal
[1:55:52] life why should I believe it you say
[1:55:54] because it's the word of God and once
[1:55:56] God speaks a word he's got to stay with
[1:55:59] it I love that amen listen that's been
[1:56:01] 2,000 years ago that the words of Mark
[1:56:04] 16 fell from the lips of the resurrected
[1:56:07] Lord but he's still with those words
[1:56:11] tonight Hallelujah come on Church
[1:56:14] Theodore Roosevelt said things and
[1:56:16] Lincoln said things come on now are you
[1:56:19] with me amen come on Martin Luther King
[1:56:21] said things amen there's all kinds of
[1:56:22] important men say things amen and people
[1:56:25] are still quoting their words tonight
[1:56:28] but there's no effect behind them
[1:56:29] because the presence of the one who
[1:56:32] spoke those words is not here tonight
[1:56:35] but those words of Mark 16 it did not
[1:56:38] come from a preacher it came from Jesus
[1:56:40] Christ and it has been revealed in the
[1:56:43] form of the message of the hour then
[1:56:46] wherever the message is preached the
[1:56:49] presence of Jesus Christ is in the room
[1:56:52] to vindicate the words that's being said
[1:56:56] yes sir if God spoke it he stays with it
[1:56:58] and he will confirm it the resurrection
[1:57:01] is just as vital today just as real to
[1:57:04] every human heart amen that will believe
[1:57:07] it I'm going somewhere amen so then we
[1:57:09] find the Great Commission amen is the
[1:57:12] preaching of the Gospel to meet the
[1:57:14] great need you say what is the great
[1:57:17] need the prophet of God said the great
[1:57:19] need oh my is a living Christ
[1:57:23] yes to bring a living faith we read the
[1:57:27] sacred writings of this book and we feel
[1:57:29] our great need of a living Christ in the
[1:57:31] days of Skeptics so listen if you were
[1:57:34] believing Christ in the reason realm
[1:57:37] then how can you ever take his word when
[1:57:39] you got to cast that aside and let that
[1:57:42] word that you have caught with your mind
[1:57:44] amen come down into your heart Amen to a
[1:57:47] living faith listen friends the
[1:57:49] preaching of a living Christ is the
[1:57:52] bringing of a living reality amen which

[2:01:15] humanity I am the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:18] I have come from God and I must go back
[2:01:21] to God
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:24] I get so sick of that devil running
[2:01:26] people around
[2:01:28] and oh you know it's a truth brother B
[2:01:31] said like this he said so Jesus looks at
[2:01:34] him this great secret and says go
[2:01:38] quickly and tell his
[2:01:42] disciples that he is risen from the dead
[2:01:45] now look at this word tail it means now
[2:01:48] watch to speak it means to command it
[2:01:51] means to say there has been many great
[2:01:54] commissions given to men and the peoples
[2:01:56] of this Earth but never was there such
[2:01:59] an important commission given as this
[2:02:02] one go tell his disciples that he is
[2:02:05] risen from the dead come on church do
[2:02:09] you know who you are you are Disciples
[2:02:12] of the Gospel you are Disciples of the
[2:02:15] one who was buried who went to hell and
[2:02:18] arose on the third day then this Great
[2:02:21] Commission has been thoroughly
[2:02:22] Vindicated can I say what a prophet said
[2:02:25] I say unto you this afternoon my dear
[2:02:27] beloved believer and fellow citizen of
[2:02:29] the kingdom of God the Great Commission
[2:02:31] is just as much enforced today as it was
[2:02:35] the days when it fell from the lips of
[2:02:37] our Lord Jesus Christ if he doesn't do
[2:02:40] the same thing in this meeting that he
[2:02:43] did in days gone by then I'm a false
[2:02:46] prophet but if he does and you fail to
[2:02:48] receive him then you are a sinner that's
[2:02:51] right let's just say what he said he
[2:02:53] said the word sinner means unbeliever so
[2:02:56] go ye and disbelieve no more there's
[2:02:58] only one Crossing line between a sinner
[2:03:00] and a saint and that's Faith so the
[2:03:03] Great Commission amen that's made our
[2:03:05] places now listen so the Great
[2:03:07] Commission what has made our places in
[2:03:10] the condition it's in today you ever ask
[2:03:12] yourself that question amen amen now
[2:03:14] don't get mad at me but let me preach
[2:03:17] amen why have we got kids who have been
[2:03:19] raised around the message don't even
[2:03:21] know the sound of the voice of the
[2:03:23] seventh angel on a

[2:03:42] to hear me and you ain't got to hear no
[2:03:44] other preacher but there's one voice you
[2:03:46] got to hear and that's the voice of
[2:03:48] Malachi for and if there is a preacher
[2:03:51] in the p
[2:03:52] he will be saying what a prophet has
[2:03:55] already
[2:03:58] said I say what's got the churches in
[2:04:00] the condition here it is because we've
[2:04:03] not carried out the Great Commission of
[2:04:06] the resurrected Jesus of his power and
[2:04:09] his love to his church well we might as
[2:04:12] well preach for here why are we trying

[2:09:26] listen if it could stop a bull help me
[2:09:29] somebody if it could stop a hornet if it
[2:09:31] could stop a possum if it could curse a
[2:09:34] tree that I come here tonight to say
[2:09:36] whatever the devil's throwing against
[2:09:37] you it can stop that
[2:09:41] D brother it can stop cancer it can stop

[2:09:59] it can stop false Doctrine it can stop
[2:10:03] division it's never lost its power it's
[2:10:08] always the same gospel then the problem
[2:10:10] of God say like this he said now watch
[2:10:12] the church in its present condition it
[2:10:15] cannot finish up the Great Commission so
[2:10:17] that's why we're not a modern church he
[2:10:20] said see it's Pres condition and its
[2:10:22] present state is in no condition to
[2:10:25] finish up the Great Commission that God
[2:10:27] gave the church for this day you say
[2:10:29] finish up the Great Commission how could
[2:10:31] they do that well now listen they're
[2:10:33] dead Pentecostal died he said God let it
[2:10:36] die amen so he could what open up the
[2:10:38] seven seal mystery to the
[2:10:41] undenominational bride and the Seven
[2:10:43] Seals of God when it was open there on
[2:10:46] the mountain he said now what does it do
[2:10:49] it brings forth those things that's been
[2:10:51] hid since the foundation of the world it
[2:10:54] might be revealed in the last days to
[2:10:57] the sons of God so under the Son of God
[2:11:00] dispensation the church only came so far
[2:11:03] but then they started brother zachari
[2:11:05] looking back and saying well if I have
[2:11:07] been in finny's day if I'd have been in
[2:11:09] knox's day if I'd have been in Calvin's
[2:11:11] day if I'd have been in Paul's day then
[2:11:13] I could really done something for God
[2:11:15] but then a prophet comes on the scene
[2:11:17] and says to finish the Great Commission
[2:11:19] is going to take headship and it's going
[2:11:21] to take the advancement of the gospel
[2:11:24] and he turns to Revelation 10:1 and says
[2:11:26] another Mighty
[2:11:28] angel came down from heaven and was
[2:11:32] clothed with a cloud watch this and
[2:11:34] Christ amen took the position of the
[2:11:37] leader of the church so if you're trying
[2:11:39] to be the leader you showed up too late
[2:11:42] God already claimed that
[2:11:47] office he said the shuck has got to get
[2:11:50] forth the seed because this is the
[2:11:53] advancement of the Gospel now you all
[2:11:55] know amen amen is everybody
[2:11:57] okay amen sometimes in the preach of the
[2:12:01] Gospel brother sister we have to say
[2:12:03] some harsh things and some rough things
[2:12:06] and some cutting things he said but Lord
[2:12:08] you said that the gospel is sharper than
[2:12:11] a two-edged sword he said God forbid
[2:12:14] that we should have anything less than
[2:12:16] that he says we are not sufficient Lord
[2:12:19] the only thing we can do is bring the
[2:12:21] gospel and the gospel is the word amen
[2:12:24] plus the power amen now now can I just
[2:12:26] preach for a second the gospel he says
[2:12:29] is not to be fussed it's to be lived and
[2:12:32] believed yes sir well somebody shout out

[2:26:49] would have it he said but all of a
[2:26:51] sudden he said there was a warm feeling
[2:26:54] just come over me and he said the only
[2:26:56] thing I could do was
