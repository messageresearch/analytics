[46:55] and if the servant shall PL ly say I
[46:57] love my master my wife and my children I
[46:59] will not go out free then his master
[47:02] shall bring him unto the judges he shall
[47:04] also bring him to the door or unto the
[47:07] doorpost and his master shall bore him
[47:10] bore his ear through with an A and he
[47:13] shall serve him forever and one more
[47:17] scripture while you're standing
[47:18] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one
[47:20] Ephesians 2 and one just one verse there
[47:24] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[47:27] and
[47:28] trespasses and sins somebody say that's
[47:30] me amen you may be seated may the Lord
[47:33] add His blessings to the reading of the
[47:35] word and brother Brandon would say it
[47:36] like this just for a foundation here
[47:38] tonight he said on the seventh year
[47:40] there was a priest that sounded a
[47:42] trumpet and if a man had been a slave he
[47:44] said I don't care what his debts was he
[47:46] was free aren't you glad for that I
[47:49] don't care what his debts was he was
[47:50] free now that's a type of the Gospel
[47:52] trumpet he said you might have served
[47:53] the devil all these years in Chains with
[47:56] drink drinking smoking gambling and sin
[47:58] dirty things no matter what you've done
[48:01] but when you hear the gospel trumpet
[48:03] it's a sign that you can go free how
[48:05] many's heard the gospel trumpet here
[48:07] tonight it is a sign that you can go
[48:09] free and he said Faith cometh by hearing
[48:12] and he says hearing what the word the
[48:14] word of God now you've heard the Full
[48:16] Gospel you don't have to stay bound any
[48:18] longer and I'd like to just go off here
[48:20] for a second and say this the Full
[48:22] Gospel in this age is different than any
[48:24] other age you've been you've had age
[48:26] after age that would come and they could
[48:28] shed a light here and a light there and
[48:30] there would be a little bit of light
[48:31] here and they would walk in that light
[48:32] but then they would denominate and it
[48:34] would actually bind the people again to
[48:36] the light that they actually was open to
[48:38] so they would come out in justification
[48:40] and then they would be bound to that
[48:41] Doctrine and wouldn't go any farther
[48:43] justification sanctification it was all
[48:46] the same way we see the Pentecostals did
[48:47] it with the restoration of the gifts and
[48:49] they became bound to the very thing that
[48:52] was the light for their age because they
[48:54] would refused to go any farther than
[48:55] that so they would be found by
[48:57] denominating on on on a truth can you
[49:00] say Amen it was actually a truth but
[49:02] they would denominate on that and that
[49:04] would actually uh bind the people to
[49:06] their to their Doctrine it would be it
[49:08] would be a new doctrine it' be a new
[49:09] idea it would be something that though
[49:11] it would be true they would take the
[49:13] people right back to what they come out
[49:14] of by denominating them again can you
[49:17] say Amen so the Full Gospel is an open
[49:20] book The Full Gospel is the Mysteries
[49:22] contained in the book Revelations 10:7
[49:24] it has been revealed and the full
[49:27] restoration of the word has been
[49:28] revealed to us can you say Amen to that
[49:29] tonight amen he said under this evening
[49:32] light message that we can receive
[49:33] Freedom amen it's it's a message that
[49:35] places us and we are sons and no longer
[49:38] slaves can you say amen and so how do we
[49:41] receive this message of Freedom it's not
[49:43] it's not by going back and denominating
[49:45] it's not going back to 1906 Pentecost
[49:47] it's not going back to what Luther had
[49:49] or what Wesley had but what it is it's
[49:51] walking in all the light that has been
[49:53] revealed to you in your day and hour so
[49:56] I can say tonight that I believe this
[49:58] message is the message of the hour I
[50:00] believe this is the evening time and we
[50:02] have heard the evening message and if we
[50:05] will walk in that and not go back to say
[50:07] well we're we're going to denominate on
[50:09] the tongues or we're we're going to
[50:10] we're going to just you know we're going
[50:11] to go back to the gifts or listen that's
[50:13] all restored in this message but we
[50:15] don't want to do what the the the
[50:16] churches have done before us and stop
[50:19] with just the tongues and stop with stop
[50:21] with just the gifts or stop with just a
[50:24] just a justification message but we want
[50:26] to continue on until the fullness of the
[50:28] opening of the word can you say amen and
[50:30] so this is an age of life this is an age
[50:32] of freedom because the word will bring
[50:34] life to a church well can somebody say
[50:36] Amen here tonight the the the the the
[50:38] word actually brings life now now it's
[50:40] not something I can get up here and we
[50:42] can preach and you can you can amen and
[50:44] we can just go home and say well it was
[50:46] a good service but what you need is let
[50:48] the word come into you and actually come
[50:50] into the places of your life that need
[50:52] to be straightened out and let the word
[50:54] do the correcting excuse me let the word
[50:56] word let let the word have its way in
[50:58] your life and watch the full word of God
[51:01] line a people up for a Rapture can you
[51:03] say Amen now brother Brandon would say
[51:06] it like this he said now he said if you
[51:08] just sit and say oh I listened to it but
[51:09] I didn't hear it he said all right then
[51:11] it ain't for you see it's for those who
[51:14] hear it all right now you can hear but
[51:16] you may not really hear it what can you
[51:17] say Amen tonight you may you may hear
[51:19] what a prophet said but if you really
[51:21] hear it then you'll go to action on what
[51:23] he said he said now it's for those who
[51:25] hear it if you can hear now watch he
[51:27] said he said prove this now watch real
[51:29] close and he goes on down to say this he
[51:31] said he said he said he said uh he said
[51:33] some people will say I love my master
[51:36] and that Master he would say is I like
[51:37] to go to the dances and and I ain't
[51:39] giving up my dances for nobody and I
[51:41] ain't giving up this or that or the
[51:42] other for nobody but you have to you
[51:44] have to be willing to lay down
[51:46] everything if you want to be set free in
[51:48] the seventh age well come on somebody we
[51:51] have to be willing to move on with the
[51:53] fullness of the word I tell you what I I
[51:56] don't want to give up nothing but I have
[51:58] to be willing to leave it all behind to
[52:00] follow Christ in this day because
[52:02] everything that is outside of the word
[52:05] can be bondage to you everything that
[52:07] you would put above Christ is bondage
[52:09] but he is the reason that we are able to
[52:12] claim our children he is the reason
[52:14] we're able to come to the house of God
[52:16] he is the reason that we can say I'm
[52:18] free he is the reason I can say I'm no
[52:21] longer a slave why because he set me
[52:23] free his word is coming this day and the
[52:26] word word has made me free and who the
[52:29] son is set free is free indeed you say
[52:31] well who is the son well we know in the
[52:33] beginning was the word and the Word was
[52:34] with God and the Word was God and God
[52:36] became flesh so who the word has made
[52:39] free is free indeed what can you say am
[52:41] man tonight he said well he said I he
[52:44] said I tell you he said he said brother
[52:46] brandom I'm going to tell you do you
[52:47] mean you have to do this no you don't
[52:49] have to stop nothing you just come in it
[52:51] stops itself but you say well I wouldn't
[52:53] do that I don't have to do that I belong
[52:55] to church I'm as good as any else he
[52:57] said all right brother that's all right
[52:58] he said well if you want to keep on that
[53:00] way just go right ahead you've heard
[53:02] what the trumpet sounded and you heard
[53:04] the noted give and the Bible said he
[53:06] said look at that wouldn't that make me
[53:08] a text right now now brother brandom
[53:10] says I could go for the next hour on
[53:11] that I won't do that he says but if the
[53:13] trumpet gives an uncertain sound if your
[53:16] denominational idea if your opinion says
[53:19] something that the trumpet didn't say I
[53:21] say let's cast that down and walk on in
[53:24] the full revealed word that we have and
[53:26] brother say he said look at this he said
[53:28] if if the trumpet says Father Son and
[53:29] Holy Ghost that don't sound like the
[53:31] trumpet to me he said if the trumpet
[53:33] gives an uncertain sound who shall
[53:35] prepare himself for war he said and he
[53:37] said you may say well I love that devil
[53:39] that's making me do these things that's
[53:40] all right and he well can somebody say
[53:43] amen he said well he's he's talking
[53:44] about somebody saying they love the
[53:45] devil I say tonight I I say I'm going to
[53:48] step on that devil's head if I can and
[53:50] I'm going to cast that devil out with
[53:51] the power that God has given me here
[53:53] tonight but he said he said well they
[53:55] say you're just too narrow-minded up
[53:57] there and I think you're just to this
[53:59] and he said all right and he said then
[54:00] they say I love these things and I think
[54:02] we ought to have these big things like
[54:03] that and do this and we ought to do that
[54:05] and have Bunko in our church whatever
[54:06] that is and and things like that and we
[54:08] all have a good time and they're just as
[54:10] good as any other Bunch you got up there
[54:11] he said okay that's all right he said I
[54:14] I will not go out in this freedom of the
[54:15] spirit you talk about then his master
[54:17] the devil shall bring him to the judges
[54:19] can you say amen and shall also bring
[54:22] him to the door he said then what who is
[54:24] the door it's Jesus Christ he said said
[54:26] I set before you a door and when did
[54:28] that Mark of the Beast come in he said
[54:30] this is the age where the door was set
[54:33] the final marking of the Beast bring him
[54:35] to the door or to the post and he said
[54:37] that's to Calvary oh can you say man I
[54:39] love how a prophet can take this
[54:40] scripture and just and just open it to
[54:42] us why because you may just read it as a
[54:44] Bible story but when the opening of the
[54:46] word come he can come and show you where
[54:48] the scripture fits in in the time that
[54:50] he was preaching in there was some
[54:52] people sitting there that didn't realize
[54:54] that they were actually slaves to a den
[54:56] ational system but a prophet would come
[54:58] and show them hey hey this is the way
[55:00] out of here here is the post set before
[55:02] you choose you this day who you will
[55:04] serve and you either choose to serve God
[55:07] or you choose to follow the word of God
[55:09] well can you say amen and he said if you
[55:11] if you choose this master he said then
[55:13] then you'll serve him forever and he
[55:15] said what do you mean brother Brandon if
[55:16] you hear the gospel truth and you refuse
[55:18] to walk in it then God marks your ear
[55:20] where you'll never hear it no more
[55:22] you've crossed the line see some people
[55:23] say it's Mercy over no if you're still
[55:26] here hear in the gospel message and
[55:27] you're still receiving it and believing
[55:29] it and trying your best to live it it's
[55:31] not over for you because you still have
[55:34] an ear to hear what God is saying to you
[55:37] but if you ever turn the message down
[55:39] and you start saying well I I just don't
[55:40] want to hear that no more and I you go
[55:42] out from it listen you make a decision
[55:45] on whether you want to be free or
[55:46] whether you want to be a slave but I say
[55:48] there's some people here tonight that
[55:49] want to be free can you say Amen I'm not
[55:52] going to be a slave to this world or its
[55:54] system or its denomination but I'm going
[55:57] to walk where Freedom lets me walk
[55:59] listen Church you say this message binds
[56:01] you this message is the only thing that
[56:03] can set you
[56:05] free this is an age of binding it's a
[56:07] denominate this denominate that come to
[56:10] my group join my group no and I know
[56:11] that Spirit gets in the message but we
[56:13] are not to be partakers of that spirit
[56:16] in this age well we got well I'm just
[56:18] going to say it we got tape only over
[56:20] here and an anti-t tape over here and
[56:22] we've got this preacher over here
[56:23] fighting this preacher listen let's just
[56:25] quit our non sense and stay with the
[56:27] word of God and say what a prophet said
[56:30] and just feed on the word of God that's
[56:32] where Liberty comes from see when you
[56:34] start biting one another and backbiting
[56:36] and you start fighting the next thing
[56:38] you know that's when you realize you you
[56:40] start poking one another why because
[56:41] you've got dry in your experience it's
[56:44] time to come back to where the wells are
[56:46] running and where the rivers are running
[56:48] and where the water's flowing why that
[56:50] is the word it is being Washed by the
[56:53] Water of the word of the hour well come
[56:55] on somebody do you actually want to be
[56:57] free then I say the word is how you'll
[57:00] find your freedom tonight the word is
[57:03] what's going to make you free now this
[57:05] brother man would say like this he said
[57:06] now see the trumpet sounded and he can
[57:08] go free that's God's grace can somebody
[57:10] say praise the Lord for that it's it's
[57:13] it's God's grace it's the Year of
[57:15] Jubilee the completion the day of sin is
[57:19] over brother I tell every one of you
[57:21] serving sin oh listen now he said I tell
[57:24] every one of you serving sin Jesus died
[57:27] you don't have to serve sin no more can
[57:30] you say praise the Lord he said you
[57:31] don't have to serve sin no more you
[57:34] don't have to be bowed down to Creeds
[57:35] and denominations he who the son is made
[57:38] free is free indeed he said if you want
[57:41] to go free and be free in the sun Cut
[57:42] Loose from all the things and serve him
[57:45] can somebody say Amen tonight I think
[57:48] it's time we cut loose from everything
[57:50] that would hold us back every Fetter
[57:51] that would hold us down everything that
[57:53] would try to try to hurt us from our
[57:55] prayer life everything that would try to
[57:56] hurt us from the house of God everything
[57:58] that well come on somebody everything
[58:00] that would make us hate our brother or
[58:02] talk bad about our sister I say we need
[58:04] to let go of those things and let's
[58:05] start hearing the word of God again and
[58:07] start leving on one another again and
[58:09] quit trying to be like the world because
[58:11] that's nothing but bondage oh it looks
[58:14] good but the end thereof is destruction
[58:17] I'm not here trying to tell you what
[58:18] something you don't already know if I'm
[58:20] preaching the word then you probably
[58:21] already heard it before but I want to
[58:23] remind you that if you want your freedom
[58:26] if you want to no longer be a slave then
[58:28] get into the word of God and let the
[58:30] word of God set you free well can you
[58:33] say Amen brother brand said a universal
[58:36] belief uh the the the Catholic Church
[58:38] wanted a universal belief and they
[58:39] forced it to the People by punishment
[58:42] and then when Martin Luther come out
[58:44] seeing the spirit of God led him out
[58:45] instead of letting the people stay free
[58:48] he organized the church and image listen
[58:50] a man that come out of an organization
[58:52] he saw what an organiz an organization
[58:54] could do and then comes right out has a
[58:57] gospel truth and then he goes right back
[58:59] into an organization again now it sounds
[59:03] like he should have learned his lesson
[59:04] the first time but but but remember
[59:07] every Revival had to had to start and it
[59:09] had to die it had to begin and end it
[59:11] had to there had to be a Revival and
[59:13] there had to be death to follow it until
[59:15] this final age can you say amen and so
[59:17] brother B said like this he said he said
[59:20] there had to be a political power and he
[59:22] said he he said he lik it it unto a
[59:23] beast because it had to fulfill prophecy
[59:25] in Scripture and he said instead of
[59:27] letting the people walk as God gave the
[59:29] light they organized under discipline
[59:31] and they have to stay to that discipline
[59:33] now brother Brandon said God moved right
[59:35] out into the Methodist Church and the
[59:36] Methodist Church had a Revival that
[59:37] swept the world now I I when I was a kid
[59:40] we were around some of those old Wesley
[59:41] and Methodist people and I can tell you
[59:43] they were some good people those people
[59:45] believed what they were taught but they
[59:46] could not accept anything further than
[59:48] that they could not accept anything that
[59:50] this message had to offer they were
[59:52] still trinitarians many of them and they
[59:54] would still walk in a in an age that
[59:56] Wesley had taught them but they couldn't
[59:58] see no more light now I believe they
[1:00:00] were Christians but they were not of
[1:00:02] this evening Light Christian they were
[1:00:03] not of this evening light bride because
[1:00:06] what they were they were they were Bound
[1:00:07] To A system that told them this is as
[1:00:10] far as you can go and you got to stop
[1:00:12] you see they thought they were free from
[1:00:14] from the Luther's AG they thought they
[1:00:15] were free from justification only but
[1:00:17] they only went so far and they were
[1:00:19] bound again I hope you're still with me
[1:00:20] tonight because I I want to try to go
[1:00:22] somewhere here but listen that that's
[1:00:24] just an age of it's a ccle brother Gabe
[1:00:26] it's a cycle of of Revival and then
[1:00:29] death you could see the church on fire
[1:00:31] it was a Revival that swept the country
[1:00:33] but he said then it was death why
[1:00:35] because they organized and anytime you
[1:00:37] organize you will die and he said then
[1:00:40] he he said they made another image under
[1:00:41] the Beast a political power to bind the
[1:00:44] people of God to a Creed instead of
[1:00:46] being free to worship and walk in the
[1:00:48] light of their path they set back in
[1:00:50] that age and it just goes on and on and
[1:00:52] he said for the pergamus age but and the
[1:00:54] Philadelphian church he said that's
[1:00:55] another but you see regardless of how
[1:00:57] much they organized God moved right out
[1:01:00] in this church age anyhow well aren't
[1:01:02] you thankful for that tonight God moved
[1:01:04] on just the same see you can organize
[1:01:07] your religion you can organize your
[1:01:08] little group but you can't organize the
[1:01:10] word of God because God is going to open
[1:01:13] the light Open the Eyes of the people
[1:01:15] who are willing to walk in the light I
[1:01:17] don't care how much you organize it I
[1:01:19] don't care how much you try to take
[1:01:20] preachers out of the pulpit I don't care
[1:01:22] how much you try to say you've got a
[1:01:23] better way of having Church the way God
[1:01:25] God moves is the way the bride will move
[1:01:28] and she will stay right with thus sayith
[1:01:31] the lord well can you say amen and he
[1:01:33] said they just went right on he said
[1:01:35] they walk in the light that was shed on
[1:01:36] their path and they set them back again
[1:01:37] in that age and he goes on to talk some
[1:01:40] more he said he said then when w Wesley
[1:01:43] and Luther couldn't follow it because he
[1:01:44] didn't believe he was already organized
[1:01:45] back there and then John Wesley
[1:01:47] organized so tight they got to a place
[1:01:49] it was time for this church age now now
[1:01:51] this is the final Church age now now I
[1:01:53] know that within the age there would be
[1:01:55] a a an age within the age and brother
[1:01:57] Brandon would teach us that there would
[1:01:58] be a bride age but that would not but
[1:02:00] the final age is the layer to see an age
[1:02:02] so in this age is an age where the bride
[1:02:05] comes together and is called out but he
[1:02:07] he said like this he said we've been
[1:02:08] down through all these ages through here
[1:02:10] where it's neither light nor dark time
[1:02:12] but a cloudy gloomy day but right here
[1:02:15] as the light is shining just the same as
[1:02:18] it did there in the evening time can
[1:02:20] somebody say Amen it shall be light in
[1:02:23] this day there will be light again and
[1:02:25] in this day will will not organize in
[1:02:27] this day the Revival will not die in
[1:02:29] this day there will be somebody that
[1:02:31] will believe the full opening of the
[1:02:32] word listen church that no other Angels
[1:02:35] promised a full open book by a message
[1:02:37] of the hour but in this stage we have
[1:02:40] Revelations 10:7 to point to and in the
[1:02:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:02:44] when he shall begin to sound the
[1:02:46] mysteries of God will be finished and I
[1:02:48] believe we're part of the prophecy and
[1:02:50] we can believe what a prophet has said
[1:02:53] and the fullness has come in this day
[1:02:55] well I was wish somebody back me here
[1:02:56] tonight a little bit the better you pull
[1:02:58] the better I'm the quicker I'm going to
[1:02:59] get out of here I can promise you that
[1:03:01] and and so brother Brandon would say
[1:03:02] like this he said now what is this
[1:03:04] Pentecostal blessing it's the
[1:03:06] confirmation of the Resurrection no
[1:03:08] wonder the gospel itself means good news
[1:03:10] good news of what he has raised from the
[1:03:14] dead has that become common to us
[1:03:17] because if it has I say we ought to not
[1:03:19] let the message become common to us but
[1:03:21] the good news is he has raised from the
[1:03:23] dead now it didn't stop there he said he
[1:03:25] raised from the dead and because I live
[1:03:28] you live also ye which were once dead in
[1:03:30] sin and trespasses God has quickened us
[1:03:33] together now listen we've moved on from
[1:03:35] the age to age experience but now we're
[1:03:37] in the fullness of time now we're in the
[1:03:39] fullness of the age where all things are
[1:03:41] coming to ahead all things are coming to
[1:03:43] into view as the Bible would tell us and
[1:03:46] he said God quickened Us Together by
[1:03:48] that spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:03:50] the dead and we are now sitting in
[1:03:53] Heavenly places with him no longer
[1:03:55] slaves but we're now Sons seated with
[1:03:58] the father well can you say amen he said
[1:04:01] he said communing with him talking with
[1:04:03] him what a joy to tell people that story
[1:04:05] that believes it to be the truth he said
[1:04:07] I'm wondering today what's happened are
[1:04:08] we really getting people to God or are
[1:04:10] we just getting them to a church listen
[1:04:12] Church uh my church ain't the only one
[1:04:14] going your church ain't the only one
[1:04:16] going I tell you what if we start
[1:04:17] denominating around our little church
[1:04:19] again we lose focus on what God is doing
[1:04:22] in this day this is not the only church
[1:04:24] I tell you what listen you say if it's
[1:04:26] just us and we start we don't want to
[1:04:28] fellowship with them because they're
[1:04:29] different listen what we've done is
[1:04:30] we've denominated oursel and we'll die
[1:04:33] right where we denominate ourselves but
[1:04:35] I'll say this open the floodgates and
[1:04:37] let us Fellowship a little bit because
[1:04:39] what we need is Brotherly Love in This
[1:04:41] Day what we need in this age is not to
[1:04:44] be picking on that church and then
[1:04:45] picking on us but I'm going to tell you
[1:04:47] right now I love them and they can love
[1:04:49] us we don't have to see eye to eye on
[1:04:51] every little thing but what I want to
[1:04:52] say is do you believe this message of
[1:04:54] the hour if they can agree on that I say
[1:04:56] you're my brother you're my sister I
[1:04:59] don't have to see everything cuz my
[1:05:00] opinion is not taking me in the Rapture
[1:05:03] Brother David your opinion is not going
[1:05:04] to take you in the Rapture but what's
[1:05:06] going to take you is the full revealed
[1:05:08] word in the heart of the believer and
[1:05:11] they will not turn to the right they
[1:05:13] will not turn to the left they're not
[1:05:14] bound to a Creed but they are free to
[1:05:17] walk in the fullness of the word for
[1:05:19] their age well can somebody say praise
[1:05:21] the lord well maybe it just excites me
[1:05:23] but the opening of the word excited me
[1:05:25] because it took me a long time in this
[1:05:27] message to realize that there is a full
[1:05:29] word there is a full restoration there
[1:05:31] is a full revealed truth that is on the
[1:05:33] earth now but I've just got to
[1:05:35] participate in it see the bride's
[1:05:36] Revival's been here the whole time ever
[1:05:38] since it began the bride's Revival came
[1:05:41] on the scene it'll never end and I tell
[1:05:43] you many of us weren't here when it
[1:05:44] started but the bride's Revival you are
[1:05:47] a part of it so we've got to participate
[1:05:50] in it I'm not willing to just sit in
[1:05:52] church and say well that was a good
[1:05:54] message or that was a good sermon I want
[1:05:56] to be free in the house of God I want to
[1:05:58] say with all that I've got in me say it
[1:06:00] don't matter what nobody says about how
[1:06:02] we worship it don't matter what anybody
[1:06:04] else would say who the son is set free
[1:06:07] is free indeed those who are free to
[1:06:09] worship those who are free to cast out
[1:06:11] Devils well come on somebody those who
[1:06:14] are free from complexes those who have
[1:06:16] been set free from from doubt and
[1:06:18] depression I tell you I've been there
[1:06:20] I've been I've had depression and I've
[1:06:22] fought doubt but I'm here today to tell
[1:06:24] you that when God sets you free when he
[1:06:26] comes on the scene there's nothing he
[1:06:28] can't do there's nothing too big sister
[1:06:30] Stephanie for my God why because he can
[1:06:33] take a broken person he can take a
[1:06:35] broken marriage he can take a broken
[1:06:37] husband or a broken wife or he can take
[1:06:39] a broken family and God is the god of
[1:06:42] restoration God is a God who can do the
[1:06:45] impossible God is still a God who heals
[1:06:47] cancer well why are the people dying
[1:06:49] with cancer well God's not you know what
[1:06:51] if it's your time I can't help that but
[1:06:53] God is still a God who heals cancer God
[1:06:55] is still a God who can come on the scene
[1:06:57] and he can I tell you what I've seen him
[1:06:59] do it I've seen him save and heal and
[1:07:01] deliver I've seen people young people
[1:07:03] come to into a meeting that were Bound
[1:07:05] by complexes and bound to pornography
[1:07:07] and bound to all kinds of filthy Devils
[1:07:09] I've seen them walk out of that building
[1:07:11] a different person oh it wasn't just an
[1:07:13] emotion but I've seen a move I've seen
[1:07:15] God do something and I watched their
[1:07:17] life and I tell you what I I think what
[1:07:20] we've done is we've let the devil take
[1:07:21] us right back to where our experience
[1:07:23] began and say but look what you did
[1:07:25] wrong I say forget those things that are
[1:07:27] in the past and press on towards the
[1:07:30] mark of the prize of the high
[1:07:32] calling I say let's have church a little
[1:07:34] bit and quit worrying about what
[1:07:36] somebody else thinks about how we have
[1:07:37] church well can you say amen I I say we
[1:07:40] can worship I'm free to Worship in the
[1:07:42] way that they call heresy I'm free to
[1:07:44] worship the way God wants me to worship
[1:07:46] I think we need to find our freedom
[1:07:48] again I know it's not all about shouting
[1:07:50] and running and jumping I know any
[1:07:51] church can do that but I want to tell
[1:07:53] you when you realize that the word has
[1:07:55] brought you this far and the word is
[1:07:58] going to take you in a Rapture the word
[1:08:00] is going to cause that body to change
[1:08:02] how can you sit there and not shout a
[1:08:04] little bit why because the word is still
[1:08:07] true and the word still has an effect
[1:08:10] and the word can still cause a woman
[1:08:12] that shouldn't have a child to have a
[1:08:13] child the word can still bring old
[1:08:16] people back in the house of God who look
[1:08:18] like they should have been dead the word
[1:08:19] can still bring young people back in
[1:08:21] this message listen we do not serve a
[1:08:23] dead God but we are serving a living God
[1:08:27] and this is an age where we have been
[1:08:29] set free you are a son of God you are a
[1:08:32] daughter of God in this age you are no
[1:08:35] longer a slave to fear you're no longer
[1:08:38] a slave to the things of the world I'm
[1:08:40] not well tell come on somebody we are no
[1:08:42] longer slaves you know the world would
[1:08:44] like to bind you to sports and the world
[1:08:46] would like to get you into a way where
[1:08:48] where you know what what the world would
[1:08:49] like to take you out but let me just go
[1:08:51] ahead and tell you something you are not
[1:08:52] a slave to this world you are not a
[1:08:55] Slave to the system because God has
[1:08:57] ordained you for a Time such as this to
[1:09:00] where you could break that generational
[1:09:02] curse well can you say Amen where you
[1:09:04] can say I don't have to be what my daddy
[1:09:06] was or what my mama was or what my great
[1:09:08] great grandparents were I I tell you
[1:09:10] what I don't have to go back and say
[1:09:12] well they were Sinners and you know they
[1:09:14] they were drug addicts and and they were
[1:09:16] they weren't Believers and they couldn't
[1:09:17] go to church no I'm here to break that
[1:09:19] cycle I'm here to say in this day is a
[1:09:22] time where I can be free from anything
[1:09:25] that the devil would try to hold me to
[1:09:27] well can the church say amen he said I'm
[1:09:30] wondering
[1:09:31] today it's what's happening are we
[1:09:33] really people getting people to God or
[1:09:36] are we just getting to the church that's
[1:09:37] a good question he says that's as far as
[1:09:39] we go he said that's good but it's not
[1:09:41] far enough when you come to church
[1:09:43] that's good but go on to Christ from the
[1:09:45] church because we receive the quickening
[1:09:47] power he said we must receive the
[1:09:49] quickening power if we ever expect to be
[1:09:52] in the general Resurrection because it's
[1:09:54] the only only thing that will ever bring
[1:09:57] us from the dead well can you say amen
[1:10:00] he said for if this spirit that raised
[1:10:01] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:10:03] it'll also Quicken and make he said
[1:10:05] bring to life your mortal bodies he said
[1:10:07] what a promise that is well can you say
[1:10:09] amen and he talks about victories how
[1:10:11] many's how many's ever had a battle in
[1:10:13] here before how many's ever had a battle
[1:10:15] then you know you've also had to have a
[1:10:16] victory you've also had to have a
[1:10:18] victory I thank God for the battles
[1:10:20] because it shows me that I can win the
[1:10:22] next battle because I just come out of
[1:10:23] that one well I I don't want to look at
[1:10:25] battles like like a bad thing and
[1:10:27] they're hard when you're in them but
[1:10:28] I've come out of battle after battle and
[1:10:30] I'm going to go into another one if I
[1:10:31] get out of this one but let me gohe and
[1:10:33] tell you something God is never going to
[1:10:35] leave you somewhere or put you somewhere
[1:10:38] that he can't bring you out of what can
[1:10:39] you say amen he said all these great
[1:10:41] victories was temporal victories even
[1:10:43] Moses he said Israel went right back
[1:10:45] into bondage again Always In and Out in
[1:10:47] and out we find it he said many Heroes
[1:10:49] did that they still do it in wars and
[1:10:51] the natural forces and I'm running out
[1:10:53] of time so I'm going to I'm going to go
[1:10:55] on down here he said but he said he said
[1:10:57] every he said man was made to live and
[1:10:59] no matter how many great achievements he
[1:11:00] did he still died and just the same and
[1:11:02] he went to the grave and they buried him
[1:11:04] and that settled it they marked his
[1:11:05] grave with a tombstone out there and
[1:11:07] that was it he said death swallowed him
[1:11:09] up he said that great Moses great Joshua
[1:11:11] the great prophets of the Bible nearly
[1:11:13] all of them except about two or three we
[1:11:15] know where their graves are at and where
[1:11:17] it marked them death swallowed them up
[1:11:19] and took them right out on see but one
[1:11:21] day he said there came a battle and
[1:11:23] there come the chief Warrior came down
[1:11:26] it was Jesus Christ the son of God and
[1:11:28] there was an Easter and that was the
[1:11:30] real Victory Day oh somebody say amen
[1:11:32] and Jesus had fought and prevailed well
[1:11:35] come on somebody he didn't just fight
[1:11:37] and Prevail for him but he overcame
[1:11:39] death hell and the grave he fought for
[1:11:42] you he died so that you could live again
[1:11:45] he died so that you could be free he
[1:11:48] died so that you would not have to live
[1:11:51] in bondage in this day can you say
[1:11:54] Amen he said the first thing he said
[1:11:56] when he was born he was born with a
[1:11:58] dirty name he was born as an
[1:11:59] illegitimate child and he fought himself
[1:12:01] right on through that and he said he
[1:12:03] said he said he he said when but in his
[1:12:05] heart he knew he was a Son of God he
[1:12:07] fought through that and he come to the
[1:12:09] day where he would make his decision of
[1:12:11] what he would do after he had received
[1:12:13] the Holy Ghost he come to the day that
[1:12:15] Satan took him up on the mountain and he
[1:12:16] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[1:12:18] and said I'll make you a king now you're
[1:12:20] the Son of God and you got power but
[1:12:22] I'll give you the rule of all the
[1:12:24] nations I'll make you ruler of all
[1:12:25] Nations he said just what the Antichrist
[1:12:27] is trying to do today he said but there
[1:12:30] was a victory day oh can somebody say
[1:12:32] Amen there was a victory day and he said
[1:12:36] he said then he said they said if thou
[1:12:37] be the Son of God and then there come a
[1:12:39] time when he was challenged by the word
[1:12:40] if thou be the Son of God command these
[1:12:42] stones to be made bread and you're
[1:12:43] hungry now eat them see if you're the
[1:12:45] Son of God you can do that if you're the
[1:12:47] Son of God pull yourself off of that
[1:12:49] cross if you're the Son of God if you
[1:12:51] well they're unbelievers anyway and you
[1:12:53] cannot make an unbeliever believer no
[1:12:56] matter how hard you try why because
[1:12:58] their ears have already been deafened to
[1:13:00] the message of the hour now brother
[1:13:02] Brandon would go on to say this he said
[1:13:03] that's right but there had to be a
[1:13:05] victory day and he won the victory over
[1:13:07] that Temptation and now he they said now

[1:13:11] yourself and you can go to the Pinnacle
[1:13:13] of the temple and and drop off and

[1:13:31] was there to deny every word it was as
[1:13:33] it was written and he said now he said
[1:13:35] now Jesus would say it like this now
[1:13:37] remember everything Jesus did was to
[1:13:40] show what you can do now Jesus said get
[1:13:43] thee behind me Satan and he said come

[1:16:42] enemies and brought them down and he
[1:16:43] said didn't give them a time to be
[1:16:45] mobilized again but see these were
[1:16:47] temporal victories these were not
[1:16:49] anything that you could look at and say
[1:16:50] well after we win this then the battle's
[1:16:52] over no no this was just a battle attle
[1:16:55] and a victory and a battle and a victory
[1:16:58] and a battle and a victory it was just
[1:16:59] over and over it's much like life that
[1:17:01] you're living sister Stephanie it's a
[1:17:03] battle and there's a victory and it's a
[1:17:05] battle and a victory sometimes it's hard
[1:17:06] to come to church but then sometimes
[1:17:08] there's victory in coming to church
[1:17:10] sometimes the devil will get you and
[1:17:12] he'll he'll just make you have such a
[1:17:13] miserable time in the house of God and
[1:17:15] sometimes you'll be so free I say we
[1:17:17] need to be free in the house of God we
[1:17:20] need to find our freedom again in the
[1:17:22] house of God we need to know that we can
[1:17:24] go in the house of God and we can feel
[1:17:26] the presence of God and if we have a
[1:17:28] sickness or we have something come up
[1:17:30] upon our body we can call out to God and
[1:17:32] he is there to meet every need God is
[1:17:35] still God can you say
[1:17:37] Amen brother Ram said now there's two
[1:17:39] more enemies that's the grave out yonder
[1:17:41] and he said then there's hell and he
[1:17:43] said so on that day when he died Jesus
[1:17:45] died so and he died so dead until the
[1:17:48] sun quit shining and the Earth had a
[1:17:50] nervous breakdown and the Rocks rung out
[1:17:52] of the hills and things like that he
[1:17:54] died and he went down into hell and he
[1:17:56] conquered death and he conquered hell
[1:17:58] and on Easter morning he conquered the
[1:18:00] grave he said you talk about a complete
[1:18:02] Victory Day a real Victory Day and
[1:18:04] brother Ram goes on down here a little
[1:18:05] bit farther and he said he said he said
[1:18:07] don't you know that that was a great
[1:18:09] time up there when they entered that
[1:18:10] Kingdom into the kingdom of God all
[1:18:12] these Heroes that were stuck in their
[1:18:14] graves and there was no way for them to
[1:18:15] come out but he said that there was a
[1:18:17] victory day because remember when he
[1:18:19] come out of the Grave many of the saints
[1:18:21] that were dead already come out of the
[1:18:22] Grave he said oh that must have been a
[1:18:24] great time that was a real victory for
[1:18:26] them because he said he brought out
[1:18:27] Abraham Isaac Jacob job and all the rest
[1:18:30] of them and brought them out of the
[1:18:32] Grave with him and he captured see he
[1:18:34] come to the Earth and he captured death
[1:18:36] and he captured hell and he captured the
[1:18:38] grave and he captured everything
[1:18:39] somebody say everything he captured
[1:18:42] everything and he said then he said what
[1:18:44] did he do he ascended on high and give
[1:18:47] gifts back to men what was it swords
[1:18:50] swords in their hand the word to conquer
[1:18:53] oh can you say Amen the word that you
[1:18:55] have Will Conquer every devil that will
[1:18:58] come against you the word that you have
[1:19:00] in your heart the word that you're
[1:19:02] holding in your hand I say take what's
[1:19:04] in your hand and defeat that devil
[1:19:06] listen we've sat in church too long with
[1:19:07] complexes and we've sat here with
[1:19:09] grudges against somebody for way too
[1:19:11] long I say it's time that we go ahead
[1:19:13] and take that sword of the word of God
[1:19:15] and cut that devil's head off and go on
[1:19:17] in Victory there's no reason to have a
[1:19:19] bad service because of a bad attitude
[1:19:21] you might as well just go ahead and let
[1:19:23] go of that thing and have church for a
[1:19:25] little while you might as well just go
[1:19:26] ahead and let go and let God have his
[1:19:29] wonderful way in the house of God he
[1:19:31] wants you to be happy he wants you to be
[1:19:33] free he wants you to live like little
[1:19:35] children he wants to be in your heart
[1:19:37] you just got to let him in well I wish
[1:19:39] somebody' say man God has given you the
[1:19:42] authority to walk on Devils God has
[1:19:45] given you the authority to cast out
[1:19:46] demons and all you have to do is just
[1:19:49] believe his word can you say amen he
[1:19:53] said he give gifts back to and see he
[1:19:55] said Oh my he gave them swords and and
[1:19:57] the Word was to conquer sickness and sin
[1:20:00] and superstitions oh can somebody say
[1:20:03] amen he said it was to conquer evil and
[1:20:05] to bring every living creature every
[1:20:07] living creature that wants to live bring
[1:20:09] every one of them to the realization
[1:20:11] that because I live you live also we
[1:20:14] have the fight of Faith let us fight
[1:20:17] good he said let us fight the good fight
[1:20:19] of Faith complete our victory for our
[1:20:22] complete Victory is positive can you say
[1:20:24] amen it sure is it's got to be we have
[1:20:27] the first fruits of it we have the
[1:20:29] evidence of it in our heart now because
[1:20:31] we've already got the first battle
[1:20:33] behind us we have been able to conquer
[1:20:35] through faith of Jesus Christ we've had
[1:20:38] our Victory Day oh come on somebody
[1:20:40] we've had our Victory Day we've seen
[1:20:43] what God can do we know that God is real
[1:20:46] we are not serving a dead God but we are
[1:20:48] serving a real God and I would say if
[1:20:50] the Holy Ghost comes on you then you
[1:20:52] won't be able to sit there but you'll
[1:20:54] have have to get an action and say I'm
[1:20:56] going to tell somebody about a living
[1:20:58] God who can still save and he can still
[1:21:00] heal and he can still take the broken
[1:21:03] and bring them back together again
[1:21:04] because God is still God and you are no
[1:21:08] longer slaves to what the world
[1:21:11] has I'm not a slave I'm a son I'm not a
[1:21:14] slave you're not a slave you're a son
[1:21:17] you're not a slave you're a daughter
[1:21:18] you're no longer slaves to fear you're
[1:21:20] no longer slaves to that complex the
[1:21:23] complex can't hold you you're letting
[1:21:25] the complex hold you you see the devil
[1:21:28] can't hold you but you're letting the
[1:21:30] devil have his way in your life you're
[1:21:31] letting the devil talk to you cast down
[1:21:33] that devil cast down the reasoning cast
[1:21:36] down imaginations and as brother Brandon
[1:21:39] would say cast down superstitions and
[1:21:42] walk on in the presence of God live a
[1:21:44] Victorious Life in this day that we live
[1:21:46] here you say how can we do it because we
[1:21:48] have the word we have the blueprint we
[1:21:51] know the way to get to a Rapture let's
[1:21:53] not be deviated over here and pulled
[1:21:55] aside over here let's not let's not fall
[1:21:57] to the Creeds of man and let's not go
[1:21:59] off on this side and say well I want to
[1:22:00] make a little ISM over here and a little
[1:22:02] Doctrine over here no I say I just want
[1:22:04] to believe everything he said I want to
[1:22:06] believe all that the prophet spoke and
[1:22:07] it's not because he was a prophet but he
[1:22:09] was a word prophet and I can take what
[1:22:11] he said right back to the word of God in
[1:22:13] the Bible see if he had have preached
[1:22:15] something outside of that word he
[1:22:17] wouldn't have been the prophet to come
[1:22:18] in the hour that we live in but this
[1:22:20] Bible was revealed to us the Bible
[1:22:23] became a new book the loose sins were
[1:22:25] tied up the things that we didn't
[1:22:27] understand we can now see in the Bible
[1:22:30] why because we're not slaves to man's
[1:22:32] opinion of the Bible we're not slave
[1:22:35] slaves to six Church ages of different
[1:22:37] ideas and and different things but what
[1:22:39] we are is we are now free to worship
[1:22:42] freely in the pure unadulterated word of
[1:22:45] the hour so I would say today the
[1:22:47] opening of the word has set us free the
[1:22:50] revealed truth in this hour has set us
[1:22:52] free I would say Malachi 4 came so that
[1:22:55] you could be free he could restore you
[1:22:57] all the way back to where you don't have
[1:22:59] to live in another cycle of Revival and
[1:23:02] death but he has restored you back to
[1:23:04] where you could be just like the
[1:23:05] original church and when the power of
[1:23:07] the Holy Ghost would fall on them oh
[1:23:09] they couldn't even speak English no more
[1:23:10] Brother David why I tell you what listen
[1:23:12] we need to quit worrying about what
[1:23:14] people think about us and walk on in the
[1:23:17] true word that's been revealed to us I
[1:23:20] believe this word is what's going to get
[1:23:22] us out of here can you say Amen I'm G
[1:23:24] skip way on down here and try to close
[1:23:27] shortly very shortly he said now listen
[1:23:31] he said he said look at Hebrews 11 there
[1:23:33] was just one nod of them Patriarchs from
[1:23:35] God and they subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:23:38] righteousness stopped the lion's mouth
[1:23:40] escaped the fire and the things that
[1:23:42] they done through faith by just one nod
[1:23:44] now he's talking about the heroes in the
[1:23:45] Bible just one nod from God and he said
[1:23:48] they done that through faith by just one
[1:23:51] nod just a nod you didn't realize the
[1:23:53] power you had on a
[1:23:55] nod but God has given you so much power
[1:23:58] that you can just point at that devil
[1:24:00] and he scared to death of you he hates
[1:24:02] to be exposed he hates to know that you
[1:24:05] know that he has no power over you what
[1:24:08] can you say man the devil knows it but
[1:24:10] he don't want you to know that he wants
[1:24:12] you to be scared of him he wants you to
[1:24:14] feel pressure from him he wants you to
[1:24:16] be in a world listen do you realize why
[1:24:19] the world's in the condition it's in
[1:24:21] because this is Satan's kingdom and he
[1:24:23] puts pressure on the people that's why
[1:24:25] there's neurotics everywhere and that's
[1:24:27] why there's people that are that are
[1:24:28] just literally a nervous wreck in this
[1:24:31] world I tell you what it even affects
[1:24:32] church people because Satan is so he's
[1:24:35] coming on so strong in this hour that
[1:24:38] when you get a little Freedom the devil
[1:24:39] wants to come and steal your joy what
[1:24:41] can you say man that's why we see
[1:24:43] churches that are sitting dead as 12:00
[1:24:45] why because they're not really able to
[1:24:48] break through the cycle of Revival and
[1:24:50] death and they're trying to go backwards
[1:24:52] when this bride will go forward can you
[1:24:55] say Amen this bride will never turn back
[1:24:57] this bride will this bride will not
[1:24:59] point you to a has been message or a has
[1:25:02] been work but this bride will only point
[1:25:05] you to the things to come and it will
[1:25:07] live like it's living now and it will
[1:25:08] say look this is the this is what the
[1:25:10] prophet would say this is what the Bible
[1:25:12] would say and here it is coming to pass
[1:25:14] and we know that if God is doing these
[1:25:17] things he is able to continue to do what
[1:25:19] he's promised and we're not going to
[1:25:21] stop here and denominate around God s a
[1:25:24] prophet what can you say Amen you know
[1:25:25] people could do that you can denominate
[1:25:27] and say well we're just going to listen
[1:25:28] to his tapes and we're not going to go
[1:25:30] any farther no he wants men and women
[1:25:31] that are in action he wants men and
[1:25:33] women that are not afraid to stand where
[1:25:36] God has placed them positionally he
[1:25:38] wants men that'll stand in the pulpit
[1:25:40] and preach the message he wants women
[1:25:42] who will stay in their position and
[1:25:44] raise children to believe this message
[1:25:46] God still has a people that are still
[1:25:48] doing the works of God in this day well
[1:25:51] how do you know brother Joel because he
[1:25:52] has no hands but yours he has no feet
[1:25:54] but yours he has no mouth but yours this
[1:25:57] is an age where the bride has a voice
[1:26:00] and the bride has a Ministry what
[1:26:02] brother Brandon was asked the question
[1:26:03] will the bride have a Ministry before
[1:26:05] the Rapture he said yes it's going on
[1:26:07] right now but it'll be so simple listen
[1:26:09] you may not feel like you're much but
[1:26:11] God has called you Brother Bruce to a
[1:26:13] Time such as this God has called you to
[1:26:16] be a believer in this day and if God
[1:26:18] chose you for this time he is able to
[1:26:21] keep you until the Rapture and a body
[1:26:23] change can you say Amen brother brand
[1:26:26] would say it like this he said today God
[1:26:28] can send a preacher and Hammer that word
[1:26:29] as hard as he can and we go to sleep and
[1:26:31] get up and walk out he said no wonder
[1:26:33] we're walled in well help me Lord he
[1:26:35] said no wonder we're walled in he said I
[1:26:37] he said I know this is taped and it's
[1:26:39] going a lot of places you see all over
[1:26:40] the world but he says I mean to every he
[1:26:42] said I mean and I mean everyone yes sir
[1:26:44] he said return what can somebody say
[1:26:46] Amen return this is the time to return
[1:26:49] while the Call's coming I I I know this
[1:26:52] has been a little bit cut up tonight but
[1:26:53] I want to show you where we're at at now
[1:26:54] remember there was a cycle and it was a
[1:26:56] Revival and then there was a death and
[1:26:58] so they would be set free and then they
[1:27:00] would love that Doctrine or that idea so
[1:27:03] much that they would actually go right
[1:27:04] back into bondage again and and I don't
[1:27:06] mean this to be bad but brother BR would
[1:27:08] actually use it like this it was like a
[1:27:10] a hog returning back to the wall it was
[1:27:12] actually just coming out of something
[1:27:14] getting cleaned up and going right back
[1:27:15] to the same thing it's like a a
[1:27:17] Christian or you'll see a person come
[1:27:19] out of the world and they'll clean up
[1:27:20] and there's no more drugs there's no
[1:27:21] more alcohol but there's something on
[1:27:23] the inside of the Nature has not been
[1:27:25] changed they go right back to it now I'm
[1:27:27] not saying that that eternally separates
[1:27:29] them but but maybe they weren't ready
[1:27:30] yet maybe they just couldn't handle it
[1:27:32] yet but listen there will be a people
[1:27:34] who will not be bound by the things of
[1:27:36] the world there will be a people who
[1:27:38] when they hear the gospel trumpet they
[1:27:40] will be set free never to return back to
[1:27:43] slavery again I you know in the Bible
[1:27:46] they they had to be willing to give up
[1:27:47] family they had to be willing to walk
[1:27:49] alone but I say there is a bride here
[1:27:51] today that has the authority to say you
[1:27:53] know what I'm willing to walk alone but
[1:27:55] I'm not going to leave one hoof behind
[1:27:57] they're going to come with I'm not
[1:27:58] walking with them just so I can be
[1:28:00] closer to my family I'm not going to
[1:28:02] walk in the world just so I can have
[1:28:03] fellowship with Darkness but I'm going
[1:28:05] to say I'm going to walk in the light as
[1:28:07] he is in the light and then I will have
[1:28:09] fellowship with my father and then those
[1:28:12] that are called of God they will come in
[1:28:14] line they will come to the message don't
[1:28:16] worry about your family don't worry
[1:28:18] about your kids don't worry about
[1:28:19] anybody that's out there listen if
[1:28:21] you'll stay walking in this message God
[1:28:23] will bring the those in that are meant
[1:28:25] to follow this message a God is not
[1:28:27] going to lose one of them God is not
[1:28:29] going to lose you he's not going to lose
[1:28:31] them but I would say tonight let us not
[1:28:33] stay in bondage let us not stay in fear
[1:28:35] let us not be be bondage to the world
[1:28:38] let's not be bound to the world but let
[1:28:39] us come out of the world and separate
[1:28:41] ourselves and come into the message of
[1:28:43] the hour I say if you hadn't been
[1:28:45] hearing the tapes I say you need to be
[1:28:46] hearing the tapes again if you're not
[1:28:48] reading your Bible I say read your Bible

[1:28:58] amen once in a while God will set you

[1:29:51] these signs shall follow he said now and
[1:29:53] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:29:55] the Holy Ghost that's right you might
