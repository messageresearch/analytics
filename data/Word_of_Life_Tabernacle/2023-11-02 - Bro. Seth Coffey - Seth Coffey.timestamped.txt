[37:25] a Christian and he's ready to go but

[40:22] serve a God that whatever we have need
[40:25] of he is capable of giving it to us he
[40:28] said all things as our brother mentioned
[40:30] that's a beautiful thing that we don't
[40:32] just serve a halfway Savior and I say if
[40:34] he's not willing to be halfway towards
[40:36] us I don't think we should be halfway
[40:38] towards him amen I think we should be
[40:40] able to give him everything that we got
[40:42] because you know there's a a lot of
[40:44] things in our life that don't deserve as
[40:46] much attention as we give it and but
[40:48] Jesus deserves all of our attention amen
[40:50] so we're going to be sure to give that
[40:52] to him tonight that'll be all for the
[40:54] music thank you for that wonderful
[40:56] playing and that wonderful music I want

[42:43] this place Lord God father we have
[42:45] nothing within ourselves Lord the
[42:47] preacher or the congregation father to
[42:50] give Lord God but we're relying on you
[42:52] Lord God to be here father L we learned
[42:54] a powerful lesson for the by father by
[42:56] your Prophet Lord that that wherever you
[42:59] go you're invited Lord but we don't want
[43:01] you just to be invited Lord but be
[43:03] welcome Among Us Lord father we want you
[43:05] to feel welcome Lord to enter any part
[43:08] of our life Lord to touch anything Lord
[43:11] father would you even Lord maybe there's
[43:13] things in our life Lord that we don't
[43:14] really even know about or recognize Lord
[43:17] that need to be made right father but
[43:19] Lord we want you to feel so welcome Lord
[43:21] you could just go there to that place
[43:22] Lord and help us Lord to be more like
[43:25] you Lord now father in this service Lord
[43:28] there you know there's many people and
[43:29] many hearts Lord father probably many
[43:32] questions on their heart Lord I'm sure
[43:34] if we could pull back the veil this
[43:36] evening Lord we could see a need here
[43:38] and a need over there Lord and Lord
[43:40] Within Myself father I don't I don't
[43:42] know their needs father Lord many many
[43:45] probably Lord I don't even know by Name
[43:47] Lord but I know that before the
[43:48] foundation of the world Lord you knew
[43:51] the need father and not only that but
[43:53] Lord you supplied a way to meet that
[43:55] need father for for you said you were
[43:56] the lamb that was slain before the
[43:59] foundation of the world almighty God so
[44:01] father this evening Lord just come in a
[44:03] special way and speak to your children
[44:05] Lord that's our desire father forgive us
[44:08] of every shortcoming any sin anything
[44:10] that would so easily beset us Lord or
[44:12] beset this service father we ask that
[44:15] you would forgive us Lord and just
[44:16] cleanse us in your blood even now Lord
[44:18] in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be
[44:21] seated and I would like to speak on
[44:23] something this evening that that the
[44:25] Lord spoke to me and really dealt with
[44:28] my heart on on the topic of Sovereign
[44:30] Grace amen and in Romans 8:35 it says
[44:33] this who shall separate us from the love
[44:35] of Christ how tribulation or distress or
[44:38] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[44:40] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[44:43] sake we are killed all the day long we
[44:45] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[44:46] but it says nay in all these things we
[44:49] are more than conquers through him that
[44:51] loved us amen for I am persuaded that
[44:54] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[44:57] principalities nor powers nor things
[44:59] present nor things to come nor height
[45:01] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[45:04] be able to separate us from the love of
[45:06] God so I want you to know if you're
[45:08] going through something you know it
[45:09] might be a principality it might be a
[45:11] power that you're going through but I
[45:13] want to tell you don't worry about it
[45:14] because it can't separate you from the
[45:16] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[45:19] lord and in second Corinthians it said
[45:21] and he said unto me my grace is
[45:23] sufficient how many knows there's a lot
[45:25] of things that we look look at and
[45:26] there's not enough sufficiency in it you
[45:28] know I'll use it in a simple way and the
[45:30] simple way that I know how to say it you
[45:31] might have a trip planned to go
[45:33] somewhere and that trips 300 miles but
[45:35] but you only have 200 miles till empty
[45:37] and you don't have a a sufficiency of
[45:39] gas to get there or a way to make it to
[45:41] that place but I'm so glad that God said
[45:44] my grace is sufficient therefore no
[45:46] matter what we're going through or where
[45:48] we find ourselves there's a sufficient
[45:51] Grace to meet us there and he says my
[45:53] strength is made perfect in in weakness
[45:56] amen now brother brandom says and I'll
[45:58] be taking most of this from the message
[46:00] of Grace but he said Sovereign Grace is
[46:02] from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace
[46:04] from a sovereign One Sovereign what can
[46:07] it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants
[46:09] to listen to this now Sovereign Grace
[46:11] can only be given by one that's
[46:13] Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can
[46:15] give Sovereign Grace therefore being
[46:18] Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[46:20] anybody it don't have to it does what it
[46:22] wants to isn't that wonderful it don't
[46:24] have to ask can I do this or shall I do
[46:27] this can I must I will I it doesn't do
[46:29] it it does it itself Grace is Sovereign
[46:32] therefore he can save the viist he can
[46:34] save the worst he can save the Imp
[46:37] purest he can save the immoralist he can
[46:40] he can heal the sickest Hallelujah he
[46:42] can save a Wretch like Me and he did he
[46:44] said what is it Grace William Brenham a
[46:47] drunker son that don't make any
[46:48] difference the grace of God saved me he
[46:51] said me I'm a woman's daughter that was
[46:53] no good he said it don't make any
[46:55] difference the grace of God saved you
[46:57] it's Sovereign has to ask nobody nothing
[47:00] amen I'm so glad of that Hallelujah it
[47:02] can take the violence Sinner and make
[47:04] them white as snow don't have to ask
[47:07] anybody about it oh it can do it because
[47:09] it's Sovereign so we can see that God is
[47:11] Sovereign let me just say it as plain as
[47:13] I can you didn't bring yourself here you
[47:16] didn't give yourself life but the
[47:18] Sovereign almighty God when you woke up
[47:20] this morning and you seen the Sovereign
[47:22] sunrise and you and you breathe The
[47:24] Sovereign air that you breathe this
[47:25] morning he doesn't have to ask for your
[47:27] opinion on who he can save he don't have
[47:29] to ask for our opinion on who he can set
[47:31] free he's The Sovereign God this evening
[47:35] he is I say this who was there to tell
[47:37] God a better
[47:38] way sometimes we don't like the way
[47:40] things are and we don't understand the
[47:41] way things are but I promise you if you
[47:44] tried to step into God's job one day you
[47:47] would have it all messed up you wouldn't
[47:49] know what you were doing because with
[47:50] these finite Minds sometimes we can't
[47:53] understand God but God in his infancy
[47:56] God In His Infinite mind he knows
[47:57] everything the end from the beginning
[47:59] and sometimes we forget it's all about
[48:01] him does the clay say to the Potter why
[48:04] has Thou made me thus here in Ephesians
[48:06] it says f for by grace are ye saved
[48:10] thank you Lord church I'm just going to
[48:12] be straightforward this evening and as
[48:14] my brother said take your Liberty it
[48:16] says for by grace are you saved Satan
[48:19] would like to tell you it's all the good
[48:20] things you did and how many times you
[48:22] came to church and what you did and what
[48:24] I I I I before you know it Satan will
[48:27] turn you into a good old Pharisee if you
[48:29] live that way but it's for by grace are
[48:31] you saved through faith what is faith
[48:34] faith is a revelation when he spoke to
[48:37] Simon Peter he said flesh and blood has
[48:40] not revealed this to you but my Father
[48:42] which is in heaven so what does that
[48:44] mean you are saved through faith and
[48:46] that is not even of yourself come on it
[48:49] is the gift of God not of Works lest any
[48:53] man should boast right right right my
[48:56] thank you Lord it really brings it into
[48:59] perspective when you begin to think of
[49:01] the Sovereign Grace of God you know you
[49:03] begin to look at that and God just
[49:04] showed me some examples here because the
[49:07] Sovereign Grace of God goes further than
[49:09] our finite Minds can comprehend we can't
[49:12] understand how God can forgive and keep
[49:14] forgiving and forgive cuz we some in our
[49:17] own flesh if you don't have the spirit
[49:18] of Christ on the inside of you somebody
[49:20] does you wrong you have a hard time to
[49:23] forgive them and you'll never never
[49:25] trust them
[49:27] again that's true come on but I begin to
[49:31] look at this of someone in the Bible
[49:32] that really begin to speak to me when I
[49:34] when I begin to think of that and know I
[49:36] begin to think of King
[49:38] David I begin to think how this man's
[49:40] whole life his whole life is wrapped up
[49:43] in Grace and even wrapped up in that
[49:46] Grace it seems that he makes a disgrace
[49:49] yeah and all and you know you begin to
[49:52] think of David and David is just a a
[49:54] young boy on the backside of the desert
[49:57] so to speak raising his father's sheep
[49:59] you know just doing what he can just
[50:01] living his life the best that he can I
[50:03] you know I'm sure maybe he was thinking
[50:05] about God maybe he wasn't but there was
[50:07] something one day that a prophet would
[50:09] just come out of nowhere all right and
[50:12] begin to come to his family's house and
[50:14] and we begin to say hey God has called
[50:16] me to raise up a king in the place of
[50:18] Saul and Jesse you you you're you're
[50:21] there's a boy of yours that has found
[50:22] favor with almighty God he's a man after
[50:25] God's Own Heart and I'm here to call him
[50:27] out what did David do to deserve that
[50:29] what did David do to earn that he did
[50:31] absolutely nothing that's right he was
[50:33] just sitting there taking care of his
[50:35] father's sheep but one day a prophet
[50:37] comes in with some anointing o and says
[50:39] you're anointed to be
[50:41] king come on God Almighty called David
[50:45] out from his brothers called David out
[50:47] from his family you might be one in a
[50:49] family by the grace of God can meet you
[50:52] and pull you out of that situation yes
[50:54] sir all
[50:56] and he picks David and he gives David
[50:58] Victory after Victory he gives him
[51:00] victory over the lion victory over the
[51:02] bear victory over Goliath nothing that
[51:05] David has earned within
[51:08] himself and David recognizes his grace
[51:11] in its rightful place at this time
[51:13] because even when Goliath approaches him
[51:15] he said you you you come to me with a
[51:17] with a sword and a spear but I come to
[51:19] you in the name of the Lord he realized
[51:21] where his perfect strength came from he
[51:24] realized where his Grace came from and
[51:26] God would give him victory over the lion
[51:28] victory over the bear victory over
[51:30] Goliath and then he would God would even
[51:32] raise him up into a place where he would
[51:34] have a a place of power he would have
[51:36] Victory after Victory because remember
[51:38] God raises up Kings and he would raise
[51:40] them up to such a high place he never
[51:42] earned any of it it was the grace of
[51:44] almighty
[51:47] God but one day I believe
[51:51] David maybe begin to think look what
[51:54] I've become
[51:56] that's true if we're not careful we'll
[51:58] get in that same
[52:00] place look what I've become look how
[52:02] many services I've been in look how many
[52:04] services I've preached look what I've
[52:06] done with the church look look look look
[52:08] at who I am look at look at how many
[52:10] people I've witnessed to look at look at
[52:12] look at what I've made with my old hands
[52:14] when we ain't done one thing but what
[52:16] almighty God has allowed us to
[52:18] do and David would begin to think man
[52:21] I'm somebody I I don't know if anything
[52:23] can overcome me I don't I don't if I can
[52:25] be beaten at all but one day he was out
[52:27] on his roof out there and he began to
[52:29] look upon
[52:31] Beba and instead of turning his head
[52:33] like a godly man should he begin to look
[52:36] at that a little bit too
[52:37] long and before you know it he begin to
[52:40] take the grace of God that was in his
[52:42] life and begin to make a disgrace out of
[52:46] it that's right and you know he would
[52:48] even go so
[52:50] far as to take you know he would take
[52:54] Bash IBA and he would take her and and
[52:59] he would in that he would do things he
[53:01] ought not to
[53:02] do and because to try to hide his sin he
[53:06] would try to kill her
[53:10] husband we're just going to be straight
[53:12] this I hope this all right he would try
[53:16] to even take UAH and he would bring him
[53:19] back and he would try to hold hide his
[53:22] whole plan from the people saying you
[53:24] just spend some time with your wife and
[53:26] euriah said how can I spend time with my
[53:28] wife when the armies of the Living God
[53:30] are fighting against the enemy and it
[53:32] even said that he slept at the gate and
[53:34] would not go enjoy time with his wife
[53:36] but instead wanted to fight the battle
[53:38] for the
[53:39] Lord so David trying to hide all of his
[53:44] sins and the things that he's done wrong
[53:46] he has to tell a lie on top of a lie and
[53:49] as he he I believe it was Joseph I can't
[53:52] remember the the the chief's name but
[53:54] but he would begin to tell the captain
[53:56] he begin to say I want you to take UAH
[53:58] put him in the heat of the battle and
[53:59] make sure he's dead and then when he's
[54:01] when he's in the middle of that battle I
[54:03] want you to withdraw from him so that he
[54:05] dies so even David himself has killed
[54:08] Uriah he's thinking he's gotten away
[54:11] with it all yeah but you can't hide from
[54:14] God right he said but you can't hide
[54:16] from God he knows what you're thinking
[54:18] right now he knows your thoughts for
[54:19] he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the
[54:21] building this morning knows your
[54:23] thoughts who you are where you come from
[54:25] what you've done for Jesus Christ is the
[54:27] same yesterday today and forever and he
[54:30] says David was ready to pronounce
[54:31] judgment and what he's talking about was
[54:33] brother brandom in the message of Grace
[54:35] he begins to tell the story of how
[54:37] Nathan the prophet would begin to come
[54:38] into town and he begin to tell he be
[54:41] saying David how are things going oh man
[54:43] it's wonderful everything's great
[54:45] everything's going going well and then
[54:47] he said he began to say well David I
[54:49] want to tell you something that's going
[54:50] on in your kingdom then begin to say
[54:52] what is he said well there was a man and
[54:54] he was was a wealthy man and he he had
[54:56] 500 sheep which represented wives he had
[54:59] 500 wives or 500 sheep and and he was
[55:02] going to he was going to have a feast
[55:03] and and instead of taking one of his
[55:05] Lambs for the feast he went across the
[55:07] road to the poor man that had one lamb
[55:10] and took that lamb and killed that lamb
[55:13] for the for the feast and and David was
[55:16] ready to pronounce judgment when he
[55:18] heard that cuz David didn't realize it
[55:21] was him and that's the way we are
[55:23] brother Brenham said we can always judge
[55:25] the other fellow but when it comes to us
[55:27] oh that's different David said the man
[55:30] will pay with his life he said that old
[55:32] Prophet them eyes narrowed down he said
[55:34] David surely you'll not die he said
[55:38] watch Grace there go to work right quick
[55:40] the spirit struck the prophet saved
[55:43] David's life
[55:44] Grace surely you'll not die but the
[55:47] sword will not leave your house so it's
[55:49] thoroughly purged your heart I want to
[55:50] bring a balance to this church whatever
[55:52] you sow in this life you have to reap it
[55:54] amen for you are that rich man oh it was
[55:57] different then wasn't it what saved
[55:59] David when his own judgment said the man
[56:02] will die he'll pay to the uttermost
[56:04] he'll pay for it with his life and the
[56:06] prophet said surely Grace you'll not die
[56:09] you'll not die David Grace has saved you
[56:12] it was Grace to David that saved him oh
[56:15] my we all have to admit David deserved
[56:19] death David deserved to die David
[56:22] deserved to be tortured in my opinion in
[56:25] my opinion he deserved to be put in the
[56:27] innermost cell the dungeon locked up if
[56:31] he took another man's life his life
[56:33] ought to be taken but the grace of God
[56:36] could look down at David and even though
[56:38] it knew David had mistakes it could look
[56:40] at the very heart of
[56:42] David CU what was it when the prophet
[56:45] came to David he be to whip weep
[56:48] bitterly within his heart because he had
[56:50] a heart after God's Own Heart where he
[56:52] could repent I say this to you this
[56:54] evening if you have a heart that can
[56:56] repent and say God I'm sorry you ought
[56:58] to be thankful yes
[57:00] sir it's not that you won't make
[57:02] mistakes it's not that you won't have
[57:04] problems but the grace of God can meet
[57:06] anybody that has a heart oh yeah and say
[57:09] I'm
[57:10] sorry good we look all the way back to
[57:14] Adam and Eve God gave them everything
[57:17] yeah that's right I mean God gave them
[57:20] every better than we have it that's true
[57:23] they had the best place to live
[57:25] didn't have to worry about bad
[57:28] neighbors didn't have to worry about
[57:30] nothing anything they wanted to eat
[57:32] anything they needed if the temperature
[57:34] was was too hot or too cold they would
[57:36] just speak to it and it would change the
[57:38] temperature whatever they wanted when
[57:40] Eve wanted to Red decorate Adam just
[57:41] said tree over here do this do that
[57:43] anything they had it
[57:45] made everything that they ever needed
[57:48] was right there before him and God said
[57:50] you you you can do anything you want
[57:53] anything you want but the one one tree
[57:55] just one the one thing you ain't
[57:58] supposed to do the one tree in the
[58:00] garden don't eat of that tree but do
[58:02] anything else that you
[58:04] want brother bam said Grace is old Grace
[58:08] is as old as the world is Grace was
[58:11] first shown to the human race when he
[58:13] had a beginning of the human race when
[58:15] the human race was first created in the
[58:16] Garden of Eden on that dark morning when
[58:19] that little woman that stepped across
[58:21] the separating line and and had gone
[58:23] against God's Commandments and enticed
[58:25] her husband to do the same thing then
[58:27] the law was broken and the law must have
[58:30] a penalty for it is no law and the law
[58:33] was the day that you eat thereof that
[58:35] that day you shall surely die that
[58:37] should have been the end of it that
[58:40] should have been it over with
[58:42] done but you see before the foundation
[58:45] of the world God had attributes God had
[58:48] characteristics can I say this God is
[58:51] the very word of character I believe
[58:53] that everything that we judge good
[58:56] character off of we judge off of God
[58:58] every attribute that we see is good is
[59:01] from God Almighty and within that
[59:03] attribute of himself he had children
[59:05] that he
[59:07] loved he had children that he loved no
[59:10] matter what they did he still loved them
[59:12] because they were a part of
[59:14] him and there was so much grace in that
[59:17] attribute that even though it said that
[59:19] day you eat thereof that day you should
[59:20] have di I would have wiped them off the
[59:22] face of the planet I gave them
[59:23] everything they ever needed but not God
[59:27] not sovereign almighty God see God don't
[59:29] have to ask me his grace don't have to
[59:32] ask me will you save Adam and Eve will
[59:34] you set them oh my what What a Mighty
[59:37] God that we're serving this evening
[59:39] that's right he said there in the garden
[59:41] that morning when sin was so black
[59:42] Jehovah came in there stood his couple
[59:45] standing condemned there would be no
[59:46] more human race they had to die death on
[59:49] the human race give the world back to
[59:51] wild beasts and there would be no more
[59:52] human race but in the darkest of ours
[59:55] in that time when all hopes was gone
[59:57] Grace came pouring through said I'll
[59:59] give you a savior Hallelujah I'll give
[1:00:02] you a savior a messiah oh it's wonderful

[1:06:56] many's ever been through a

[1:07:00] a literal drought around here but I felt
[1:07:03] like I was going through a drought yes I
[1:07:04] kept preaching I tried to do the best I
[1:07:07] can but the connection didn't seem to be
[1:07:09] there but then I listen to that sermon
[1:07:12] perfect strength by Perfect weakness and
[1:07:16] I begin to realize oh god I've been
[1:07:18] trying to do this the whole time on my
[1:07:20] ability and what I can do and he began
[1:07:23] to realize son I'm the one that called

[1:07:28] I'm the one that's brought you this far
[1:07:30] I am the author and finisher of your
[1:07:33] faith than you Lord
[1:07:37] sir brother bam said that was proved on
[1:07:39] the cross when there was the violence
[1:07:42] Thief he deserved to die God had never
[1:07:44] come across his mind he never thought
[1:07:47] nothing of it there on the cross when
[1:07:49] those bloody lips in between the groans
[1:07:52] there came out a sound Lord Lord be
[1:07:54] merciful to me this thief didn't earn it
[1:07:58] he did not earn it we reading the
[1:08:00] scriptures just a few seconds before he
[1:08:03] was
[1:08:04] cussing cussing out the lovely Lord
[1:08:07] Jesus but with one cry
[1:08:10] Lord be merciful to me and brother bham
[1:08:14] said and there came another one back
[1:08:15] through blood tears Agony he said Grace
[1:08:18] took a hold and said today shalt thou be
[1:08:21] with me in Paradise he said Grace did
[1:08:23] that' how could that Thief help himself
[1:08:25] no more than Adam could help hisself no
[1:08:27] more than Eve could help herself no more
[1:08:29] than you can help yourself no more than
[1:08:32] I can help myself with no more that we
[1:08:34] could jerk ourselves up to the Milky
[1:08:35] White Wave went by our bootstraps we
[1:08:38] couldn't do it but the grace of God can
[1:08:40] do something about it it does it the
[1:08:42] grace of God the sovereignty the grace
[1:08:44] of God come to that dying Thief today
[1:08:47] thou shall be with me in Paradise oh
[1:08:50] think of it that's wonderful I don't
[1:08:52] ever hardly ever get on Facebook but but
[1:08:53] I shared something on my Facebook not
[1:08:55] too long well probably about three or 4
[1:08:56] months ago and it's probably the last
[1:08:57] post I had but but but I was on there
[1:08:59] and I seen something that was so
[1:09:01] wonderful to me and this preacher was
[1:09:03] preaching on the thief on the
[1:09:04] cross and you may have seen it but he
[1:09:07] was preaching on the the thief on the
[1:09:09] cross and and he said can you imagine
[1:09:12] that thief on the cross that day when he
[1:09:15] he said I I want to ask him one day how
[1:09:17] did that shake out for you yeah he said
[1:09:20] because one minute you're on the cross
[1:09:22] the next minute he says you're you're
[1:09:24] you're you're in front of some angels
[1:09:26] and they're asking you how did you get
[1:09:28] here I don't
[1:09:29] know he said well what do you mean you
[1:09:31] don't know he said well I don't know and
[1:09:33] he said you know he's just playing it
[1:09:35] out as a drama he said so the angel goes
[1:09:37] and gets his supervising Angel and the
[1:09:40] other Angel comes out and he begins to
[1:09:41] say sir we just have a few questions for
[1:09:43] you on how you got here he said are you
[1:09:47] clear on justification by faith and he
[1:09:50] says I've never heard of it in my
[1:09:52] life
[1:09:55] he began to talk about well what did you
[1:09:57] did you he said never attained never
[1:10:00] never never one time went to a church
[1:10:02] service never one time went to a Bible
[1:10:04] study never one time did any of these
[1:10:07] things and we know all those things are
[1:10:08] right and good and you ought to do it
[1:10:09] but I'm just telling you this he be and
[1:10:12] he begin to say the angel begin to
[1:10:14] scratch his head and he said well oh sir
[1:10:17] we don't understand but on what basis
[1:10:20] are you here and he says he turns to him
[1:10:23] and he looks to him and he says the man
[1:10:25] on the middle cross said I could come
[1:10:28] that's right if you see Seth coffee
[1:10:31] there on that day if you see me dancing
[1:10:34] on the Hills of Glory it won't be
[1:10:37] because of Seth coffee and what he's
[1:10:39] done but it'll be because the man on the
[1:10:42] middle cross said I could
[1:10:45] come I could preach as hard as I can and
[1:10:48] I'll do it for him because I love him
[1:10:51] I'll live my life the best I can for him
[1:10:54] but on that day when you hear Amazing
[1:10:57] Grace how sweet the sound that saved a
[1:11:00] Wretch like
[1:11:01] Me it'll be because the man on the
[1:11:05] middle cross said I could come oh thank
[1:11:09] you Lord that's right when others said I
[1:11:11] wasn't good
[1:11:13] enough when others said we would never
[1:11:15] make
[1:11:17] it on that day the man on the middle
[1:11:21] cross said we could come oh thank you
[1:11:24] Lord he in his love not that we love
[1:11:28] God but that he loved us that's right
[1:11:31] and sent his son to be the
[1:11:33] perpetuation for our
[1:11:36] sins this is
[1:11:40] Grace he wasn't on the cross for
[1:11:42] anything he
[1:11:45] did that's
[1:11:49] Grace I was the reason he was on that
[1:11:52] cross he could not
[1:11:54] die he laid his down his life they
[1:11:58] couldn't kill
[1:11:59] him that's
[1:12:01] Grace brother sister they couldn't kill
[1:12:05] him he said I have power to lay my life
[1:12:09] down and raise it up again they didn't
[1:12:11] have power that pilot didn't have any
[1:12:13] power unless it was given to him and
[1:12:15] there's 12 Legions of Angel sitting back
[1:12:18] just sitting there in the trees looking
[1:12:22] down and I I wonder if they're thinking
[1:12:24] how far will his grace go I wonder if
[1:12:27] they're looking down thinking how far
[1:12:29] will the grace of God go for these
[1:12:32] people I'm just going to be honest this
[1:12:34] morning for these no good people this
[1:12:37] evening rather yeah seems like every day
[1:12:40] the angels are looking you know there's
[1:12:41] Guardian Angels so every day they're
[1:12:43] around guarding people and then taking
[1:12:45] care of people and and every day they've
[1:12:48] got to be seeing the
[1:12:49] mistakes they've got to be seeing the
[1:12:52] problems take your your Halos off for a
[1:12:54] minute come on now judgment starts at
[1:12:58] the house of God take your Halos off if
[1:13:01] you live perfect in the LA I'll tell you
[1:13:03] what if you live you say you know if if
[1:13:05] you haven't made a mistake in the last
[1:13:08] week raise your
[1:13:11] hand my and we think we're going to earn
[1:13:14] the grace of
[1:13:20] God but he has 12 Le of angels there and
[1:13:25] they're sitting
[1:13:26] there looking must be wondering how far
[1:13:30] is his grace going to go because that's
[1:13:32] right these angels are encamped about
[1:13:36] those that fear Him and they're sitting
[1:13:40] there watching these angels and they
[1:13:41] must be scratching their heads going why
[1:13:43] does God even love
[1:13:46] them let's be honest these are angels
[1:13:49] that sit Before the Throne going holy
[1:13:51] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty all
[1:13:53] they know know was Holiness all they've
[1:13:54] ever seen is Holiness and then they look
[1:13:56] at us in this
[1:13:59] flesh not the real you in this flesh and
[1:14:04] they see the mistakes and the problems
[1:14:05] and the situations and they must be
[1:14:07] scratching their head looking at Jesus
[1:14:09] 12 Legions of them waiting there just to
[1:14:11] destroy the whole thing but remember in
[1:14:14] the garden he made a promise thank you
[1:14:17] Lord Grace would provide a
[1:14:19] savior and the law was the innocent for
[1:14:22] the guilty
[1:14:24] he couldn't send me I'm Not Innocent he
[1:14:28] couldn't send you You're Not Innocent
[1:14:31] that's right so he came himself and they
[1:14:33] begin to look at him and they begin to
[1:14:36] wonder what's he doing this for how far
[1:14:38] can his grace go maybe they even begin
[1:14:40] to draw their swords thinking any second
[1:14:43] we're going to rush in we're going to
[1:14:46] save the
[1:14:48] king we're going
[1:14:50] to we're going to come in we're going to
[1:14:53] destroy all the Romans but then they
[1:14:56] begin to see Jesus and he begins to be
[1:14:59] in the garden he say these words not my
[1:15:01] will not this flesh will but thy will be
[1:15:05] done oh
[1:15:06] Lord and that was Grace and they begin
[1:15:09] to go oh my he's going to go through
[1:15:11] with it and he begins to walk into that
[1:15:14] judgment and the angels are watching him
[1:15:16] be beaten and spit on for
[1:15:19] you for you that's right for every thing
[1:15:23] you would ever do wrong they put a crown
[1:15:26] of thorns on his head and squish it to
[1:15:28] his head the king of glory the king son
[1:15:32] yes sir blood begins to Spur out of his
[1:15:37] head and they push it down with a rod on
[1:15:41] his
[1:15:43] head clothe him with a robe and make fun
[1:15:47] of him and hit him and throw a a bag
[1:15:49] over his head and hit him and say if
[1:15:51] you're a prophet tell us who hit you he
[1:15:52] could have looked up and said you're so
[1:15:54] and so you're such and such you came
[1:15:56] from such and such family you were born
[1:15:57] on such and such a day but he didn't do
[1:15:59] it because it was God's provided lamb of
[1:16:04] grace and the sovereignty of his
[1:16:07] grace he would
[1:16:10] go you got to realize when you look at
[1:16:13] Calvary it's not for someone else it's
[1:16:15] for you oh come
[1:16:18] on he loved you so much that if you were
[1:16:21] the only person in the world that would
[1:16:22] serve him he would go through with it he
[1:16:25] loves you so much if you were the only
[1:16:27] person in the world that would ever only
[1:16:29] believe he went through with it and they
[1:16:32] begin to they begin to take him into the
[1:16:35] inner Hall and they begin to beat him
[1:16:37] because of
[1:16:39] Grace
[1:16:42] Grace and he's a helpless lamb but not
[1:16:45] so helpless but making himself helpless
[1:16:48] that's right making himself helpless for
[1:16:52] us
[1:16:56] making himself helpless the king of
[1:16:59] glory that created the heavens in the
[1:17:01] Earth the very fibers of the chairs and
[1:17:03] the floor that you're standing and
[1:17:05] sitting on he created every bit of it
[1:17:08] and he's making himself helpless for you
[1:17:12] right yes not because of what you've
[1:17:15] done we weren't even born
[1:17:19] yet when he was on the cross he looked
[1:17:22] forward
[1:17:23] in
[1:17:24] time
[1:17:27] my and he begins to look back at Isaiah
[1:17:34] 535 for he was
[1:17:36] wounded for
[1:17:38] our
[1:17:41] transgressions bruised for our
[1:17:45] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:17:49] was upon him and with his stripes
[1:17:53] we are healed oh thank you Lord what did
[1:17:56] we ever
[1:17:58] do to earn
[1:18:01] that what did I ever do that one night
[1:18:03] when my little go daughter woke up in
[1:18:06] the middle of the night screaming daddy

[1:18:12] take that foot had a big swollen up
[1:18:15] swollen bump on it and I said but he was

[1:18:53] that every time we're
[1:18:55] sick wherever brother Robert is he was
[1:18:58] wounded for brother Robert's
[1:19:00] transgressions bruised for his
[1:19:03] iniquity the chastisement of brother
[1:19:05] Robert's peace was upon him that's right
[1:19:08] and with those stripes brother Robert is
[1:19:12] healed thank you Lord I don't know
[1:19:14] brother Robert but I promise you
[1:19:16] whatever he did in this life he didn't
[1:19:17] earn
[1:19:19] that that was the grace of almighty God
[1:19:23] that's God's Almighty Grace to
[1:19:26] us that he would give
[1:19:29] himself looking unto Jesus thank you
[1:19:32] Lord the author and finisher of our
[1:19:34] faith who for the joy that was set
[1:19:36] before him endured the cross despising
[1:19:39] the shame oh thank you Lord is sat down
[1:19:41] at the right hand of the Throne of God
[1:19:44] who ha saved us saved us church he saved
[1:19:49] us called us with a ho holy calling not
[1:19:54] according to our works but according to
[1:19:57] his own purpose and Grace oh thank you
[1:20:01] Lord which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:20:05] before the world
[1:20:09] began that's
[1:20:11] Grace yes it is Paul would say for I'm
[1:20:16] the least of the Apostles I'm trying to
[1:20:17] get to a place before I close for I'm
[1:20:20] the least of the Apostles that I'm not
[1:20:21] meat to be called an apostle because I
[1:20:24] persecuted the Church of
[1:20:26] God persecuted the Church of God what
[1:20:30] did Paul do to earn
[1:20:32] Grace come on what did Paul do to earn
[1:20:38] Grace when his daily job was to kill
[1:20:40] people like Seth coffee and Ben pu and
[1:20:44] Carla
[1:20:45] price what in the world did he do to
[1:20:49] earn
[1:20:51] Grace that's
[1:20:53] right but after he would say for I'm the
[1:20:55] least of the Apostles that am not me to
[1:20:58] be called an apostle because I
[1:20:59] persecuted the Church of God he said but
[1:21:02] by the grace of God sir I am what I am
[1:21:07] oh yeah
[1:21:10] good but by the grace of God I am what I
[1:21:14] am when the pillar of fire became came
[1:21:17] over Paul and he said it's hard for you
[1:21:19] why are you kicking against the Pricks
[1:21:20] Paul why why are you fighting me Paul
[1:21:24] I've always loved you Paul I've always
[1:21:27] took Paul before the foundation of the
[1:21:30] world I knew you Paul he said to
[1:21:33] Jeremiah one time before you were ever I
[1:21:36] knew you when you were in your mother's
[1:21:39] well I already knew you and ordained you
[1:21:41] to be a prophet what did Jeremiah do to
[1:21:43] earn that what did he ever do to earn
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:46] privilege of being a prophet what did he
[1:21:50] ever do to earn the privilege that
[1:21:53] Millions upon millions of people would
[1:21:56] be able to read Jeremiah
[1:21:58] 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I
[1:22:01] think towards you
[1:22:05] yes we think of
[1:22:08] Peter I want you to think about
[1:22:11] this and realize what the grace of God
[1:22:13] will do in your life because listen
[1:22:15] Satan will always tell you you're not
[1:22:17] good enough you can never be good enough
[1:22:18] but Church what I'm trying to tell you
[1:22:20] listen absolutely live a holy life
[1:22:23] don't ever if you take if you if you
[1:22:25] somehow say hey Seth Seth we can do
[1:22:27] whatever you've missed it by a million
[1:22:29] miles you're not even hearing the same
[1:22:32] sermon that's
[1:22:35] right you're not even hearing the same
[1:22:38] servant
[1:22:40] sermon but
[1:22:42] Peter Peter we've all been
[1:22:47] Peter
[1:22:49] Peter Jesus comes to Peter and says
[1:22:53] Peter you're going to deny
[1:22:55] me and Peter begins to say God I will
[1:22:58] never how many times you told God I will
[1:23:01] never do that I don't know how that
[1:23:04] person did that but I will never do that
[1:23:07] God I will NE God I promise you and by
[1:23:10] the grace of God you may never do it but
[1:23:12] it's by the grace of
[1:23:15] God that's right but Peter said God I
[1:23:18] won't deny you and he said Peter before
[1:23:21] the crows you'll deny me
[1:23:24] Thrice and Peter's going how how will I
[1:23:28] deny God I've seen God do too much I've
[1:23:31] been in this too long I've seen 70
[1:23:34] disciples walk away I I there's no way
[1:23:38] I've cast out evil spirits he gave me
[1:23:40] power to cast out evil spirit I've seen
[1:23:42] too many
[1:23:48] miracles but in the midst of his trial
[1:23:51] when he finds him himself at the gate
[1:23:54] after they've taken Jesus the very one
[1:23:57] that he said I'll even give my life for
[1:23:59] you but when they find him a woman says
[1:24:03] weren't
[1:24:06] you weren't you with him I don't know
[1:24:12] him I don't know
[1:24:15] him then another one speaks up you even
[1:24:18] speak like him you talk like him you
[1:24:21] were with him I don't know
[1:24:26] him when Jesus is over here getting
[1:24:30] hit you know what that was it's just
[1:24:32] like the buffer brother brandham talked
[1:24:34] about when brother brandham was judging
[1:24:35] that woman in that place that was
[1:24:39] sitting there right living in sin doing
[1:24:41] things she ought not about to be doing
[1:24:43] an old lady all dressed up with purple
[1:24:44] fingernails and and drunk as can be in
[1:24:47] there playing a slot machine and God and
[1:24:49] he said does my daughter have to grow up
[1:24:51] in this kind of world
[1:24:53] and he begins to and the angel of the
[1:24:54] Lord said come over here for a second
[1:24:56] and he began to look Beyond the Veil and
[1:25:00] he seen Jesus up there and there was
[1:25:02] sins that were going up trying to get to
[1:25:04] the throne of God but Jesus was standing
[1:25:06] right there and every time one of those
[1:25:08] sins would hit him it would jar Jesus
[1:25:10] and he would begin to say is that the
[1:25:12] sins of the world and he said no that's
[1:25:13] your
[1:25:16] sin but as Peter was sitting there
[1:25:19] looking at Jesus said I don't know him
[1:25:23] and the last time Jesus last time they
[1:25:26] say you were with him and Peter results
[1:25:28] back to his old ways and says well
[1:25:30] bleepity bleep bleep I don't know
[1:25:33] him and it says that Jesus looked across
[1:25:36] the room and looked at Peter you know
[1:25:39] what that was a
[1:25:41] buffer a buffer right there that Jesus
[1:25:44] was saying I know Peter but I'm doing
[1:25:46] this for you I'm doing this for you
[1:25:49] Peter I know you've got mistakes
[1:25:52] Glory I know you've done things wrong
[1:25:55] but this is my grace to
[1:25:58] you that's right and after his death
[1:26:01] burial and
[1:26:02] Resurrection he said these beautiful
[1:26:05] words go tell my
[1:26:09] disciples everyone else didn't think
[1:26:12] Peter was a disciple anymore everybody
[1:26:15] else had done for a God if he would have
[1:26:17] said go get my disciples Peter would
[1:26:19] have stayed at the
[1:26:21] table but he said go get my disciples
[1:26:24] and Peter isn't it amazing that in
[1:26:27] Tribulation he wouldn't forget about
[1:26:29] Peter in death he would not forget about
[1:26:32] Peter in Resurrection he would not
[1:26:35] forget about Peter no matter what we're
[1:26:38] going through no matter where we find
[1:26:40] ourselves he said in Isaiah he said a
[1:26:42] mother has a better chance of forgetting
[1:26:44] her child than he does to forget about
[1:26:47] you we didn't earn that we don't deserve
[1:26:50] that that's Grace he said our names are
[1:26:52] inscribed on the palm of his
[1:26:55] hands he cooked a meal for Peter and had
[1:26:59] P Peter Run Fly jump out of a boat and
[1:27:02] come swimming to him and he said Peter
[1:27:04] do you love me he said you know I love
[1:27:06] you Lord that's what the grace of God
[1:27:08] can do it can take a liar that'll look
[1:27:11] God in the face and and say I don't know
[1:27:13] him I don't know him but on the day of
[1:27:15] Pentecost the Holy Ghost the blood of
[1:27:18] Jesus Christ and the grace of almighty
[1:27:20] God can cling someone up so much to make
[1:27:24] him the spokesman on the day of
[1:27:28] Pentecost that's the grace of God that
[1:27:32] we have in our lives I'm going trying to
[1:27:34] I'm trying to
[1:27:35] close when I think of Abraham and all
[1:27:37] the mistakes that he made and Moses and
[1:27:39] his mistake but musicians come but but
[1:27:43] when Abraham's commentary was written
[1:27:45] when the Divine commentary was written
[1:27:47] was Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he
[1:27:49] never mentioned one thing about
[1:27:50] Abraham's unbelief no no never was even
[1:27:54] accounted unto him he said Abraham
[1:27:55] staggered not at the promise of God even
[1:27:57] though we can read in the Bible where
[1:27:59] Abraham staggered at the promise of God
[1:28:01] but in God's mind under the blood of the
[1:28:03] Lord Jesus Christ and the grace of
[1:28:05] almighty God he would begin to speak to
[1:28:06] his Prophet Paul and when Paul would go
[1:28:08] into that vision and Paul would see
[1:28:10] Abraham he couldn't see his
[1:28:12] mistakes one time there was a woman that
[1:28:14] made a mistake and they asked brother
[1:28:16] brandom what did she do and he said
[1:28:17] listen brother what's under the blood of
[1:28:20] Jesus Christ even a prophet can't
[1:28:22] see Hallelujah my humble prayers is
[1:28:25] before the grace of God that's here this
[1:28:27] morning I hope mine's wrote like that he
[1:28:29] won't see my mistakes that when my
[1:28:32] commentary is written in my obituary
[1:28:33] that he won't read how that I made
[1:28:35] mistakes and done wrong but he'll only
[1:28:37] see the things that I tried to do for
[1:28:39] him what does that he'll take the grace
[1:28:42] of God that I believe in and that's
[1:28:44] where I'm solely trusting for upon my
[1:28:45] merits I could no more go in than none
[1:28:47] of the rest but upon the grace of God
[1:28:50] I'm depending yes it's Grace that I'm
[1:28:52] depending on right Hallelujah blessed is
[1:28:56] he that God will not impute
[1:28:59] sin I'll say this in close last thing
[1:29:03] I'm saying but this is the point that I
[1:29:05] wanted to get to through all
[1:29:07] that brother brandham tells a story of a
[1:29:10] little Hunter named
[1:29:14] Gabe he was a black brother down in
[1:29:18] Louisiana and they tried everything they
[1:29:21] could he had he had good influences a
[1:29:23] good mother a good father to try to
[1:29:26] influence him to give his heart to the
[1:29:28] Lord he never would do it he had a
[1:29:30] problem with
[1:29:32] gambling but he loved to hunt and old
[1:29:35] Gabe couldn't hit nothing Gabe couldn't
[1:29:37] hit n a terrible
[1:29:38] shot and he said one day he was going
[1:29:42] through the woods the pastor asked him
[1:29:43] to go hunting on
[1:29:45] Saturday Gabe had all this
[1:29:49] game that the Lord had given him he had
[1:29:52] all this game and he knew that he
[1:29:53] couldn't hit
[1:29:54] nothing but he was walking and the sun
[1:29:58] was
[1:29:59] setting and he turned
[1:30:02] around and he looked at that Sunset and
[1:30:04] he looked at all that
[1:30:06] game he tears down his
[1:30:09] eyes and he went to the pastor and he
[1:30:11] tapped him on the
[1:30:13] shoulder and he said pastor tomorrow
[1:30:16] morning I'm going to go to the
[1:30:18] Altar and I'm going to give my heart to
[1:30:20] the Lord
[1:30:22] and I'm going to be committed and
[1:30:26] dedicated to God and he he turned around
[1:30:28] he said
[1:30:30] Gabe what what sermon did I preach what
[1:30:32] song did you hear what what made you
[1:30:34] make this
[1:30:36] decision and he said I turned around and
[1:30:38] looked at the Sun and I looked at all
[1:30:40] that game and he said I
[1:30:42] seen the sun of my life was
[1:30:45] setting and he said I've seen all this
[1:30:47] game and he said you know I can't hit
[1:30:49] nothing you know I I I can't hit nothing
[1:30:52] I'm a terrible
[1:30:53] shot he said but if God would give me
[1:30:56] all this
[1:30:57] game and would think that much of me he
[1:31:01] must love me to give me
[1:31:04] this because I can't get this game on my
[1:31:07] own and if he loves me I want to serve
[1:31:11] him all the days of my
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:14] life I think we
[1:31:16] forget too
[1:31:19] quickly The Sovereign Grace in our
[1:31:23] life we have a place to
[1:31:26] worship we have family friends food
[1:31:30] heartbeat in our chest L lungs that
[1:31:32] breathe air good
[1:31:35] health I read that today brother Brad
[1:31:38] and I thought about how God gave you
[1:31:39] that deer on this
[1:31:42] trip Brad always says I'm a terrible
[1:31:44] shot I take after Pepa
[1:31:49] Wayne but you know Brad was going to
[1:31:51] hunt somewhere
[1:31:52] else but he had a little problem in his
[1:31:55] leg so he used a different stand that
[1:31:57] faced him in a different
[1:31:59] direction and that deer ran right by him
[1:32:02] where all the other deer were coming
[1:32:03] behind him but the deer that he wanted
[1:32:06] ran right by him because God cared
[1:32:08] enough about Brad to give Brad that
[1:32:12] deer biggest deer that he's ever killed
[1:32:14] in his life because God's grace
[1:32:18] therefore he said my grace is sufficient
[1:32:21] to thee for my strength is made perfect
[1:32:24] in weakness therefore will I rather
[1:32:26] glory in my infirmities knowing that the
[1:32:29] power of Christ May rest upon me how he
