[41:58] How many enjoyed our specials this
[41:59] morning? And then give give the Lord a
[42:01] hand for the talent that he's given us.
[42:03] Amen. We're going to change the song up.
[42:05] Brother Robert, if you don't mind,
[42:07] change it to He's God. He's God. When I
[42:10] come into his presence, when I come into
[42:14] his presence, can we stand together? I
[42:16] humble myself.
[42:20] I lift up both my hands
[42:24] and I begin
[42:28] to worship
[42:30] him.
[42:33] Oh,
[42:35] I worship
[42:40] him when I come into his presence.
[42:47] I humble myself,
[42:51] remembering what he's done.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; All the victory he's won. So I'll praise
[43:01] him.
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] Oh
[43:05] yes, I'll praise
[43:10] him
[43:12] for
[43:14] all
[43:16] he's done for me.
[43:20] He has redeemed
[43:23] and he set me free
[43:28] and become.
[43:31] Oh, just become
[43:34] [Music]
[43:37] God.
[43:41] Oh, when I come to his presence,
[43:48] I humble myself.
[43:52] I lift up both my hands
[43:56] and I begin
[44:00] to worship
[44:02] him. Can you worship him now?
[44:06] Oh,
[44:07] I worship
[44:11] him.
[44:13] When I come into his praise,
[44:19] I humble myself.
[44:23] Remember, oh, somebody ought to think
[44:25] about what he's done for you this
[44:26] morning.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we praise him now? So, I'll
[44:32] praise him. Oh, let's praise him,
[44:34] church. Oh, yes.
[44:38] I'll praise
[44:42] him for
[44:46] all he's done for me.
[44:52] He has redeemed
[44:54] and he set me free.
[44:58] [Applause]
[44:58] [Music]
[44:59] And because
[45:03] Oh, just because
[45:06] he's
[45:08] not. Sing it again. When I come into his
[45:10] presence, oh when I come into
[45:17] his presence, I humble myself.
[45:22] I lift up.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody could just give him
[45:26] praise in the building this morning.
[45:29] again to worship him. Oh yes we do.
[45:36] Oh yes I worship
[45:42] him
[45:43] when I come into his presence.
[45:49] I humble myself
[45:53] remembering what he's done.
[45:57] All the victories
[45:59] he's won. So I'll praise
[46:03] you. Oh yes I will. Oh yes
[46:08] I'll praise.
[46:13] Oh sing it now. Oh
[46:16] all he's done for me.
[46:21] Oh, he has redeemed
[46:24] and he set me free.
[46:29] And because
[46:33] Oh, just because
[46:36] he's
[46:38] God. Sing with all your hearts now. For
[46:41] all he's done. Oh, for
[46:45] all he's done for me.
[46:51] He has redeemed
[46:54] and set me free
[46:58] and because.
[47:02] Oh, just because
[47:05] he's
[47:07] God. Can somebody praise the Lord this
[47:10] morning? I wonder if you can give him a
[47:11] hand clap of praise and just let him
[47:13] know how much you love him. Has he done
[47:15] something for you? If he's done
[47:17] something for you, we ought to be the
[47:19] happiest people on the face of the
[47:21] earth. You know, the angels can't sing
[47:22] that song because they've never been
[47:24] redeemed. But you can sing because
[47:26] you've been so I'll tell you what,
[47:28] you've been so low, but he reached down
[47:30] his hand for you. Aren't you thankful
[47:32] that he did it? If you're redeemed this
[47:34] morning, I wonder if you could put a
[47:35] hand up to him and say, "Thank you,
[47:36] Lord, for redeeming me." I wonder if we
[47:39] can sing that one more time. Amen. As we
[47:41] turn it to our pastor. Amen. Aren't you
[47:43] glad he's done something for you this
[47:44] morning? When you think about what he's
[47:46] done, how can you keep quiet?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; It's like fire shut up in our bones.
[47:50] Why? Because we've been redeemed by the
[47:52] blood of the lamb. And we're so thankful
[47:54] that we can worship this morning. I want
[47:56] to just hear you with all your hearts
[47:57] now as we sing that chorus again. Oh,
[48:00] for all he's done for me. Sing it like
[48:06] you mean it now. He's redeemed
[48:10] and he set me free.
[48:14] And because
[48:18] Oh, just because
[48:21] he's
[48:23] one more time with your hands up to him
[48:25] now. Oh,
[48:28] for
[48:30] all he's done for me.
[48:37] me
[48:39] and set me free.
[48:43] Oh, and because
[48:47] Oh, just because
[48:51] he's
[48:52] God. Oh, do you believe he's God this
[48:55] morning? Give him another hand clap of
[48:57] praise.
[49:00] Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[49:03] We're going to have brother Sean come
[49:06] and deliver the word this morning. Been
[49:08] looking forward to this weekend. And
[49:11] just believing as we relax this morning
[49:13] and hear the word and back the word that
[49:16] every need that we have will just be
[49:18] met. And we've seen God use Brother
[49:20] Shawn Martin before to to help the
[49:23] church to build up our faith and and we
[49:26] know that he's he's got a calling and
[49:28] gift to preach and able to help the
[49:31] body. And then we believe we're the
[49:33] elected children of God,
[49:35] &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of the king.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Then why would we stop short of anything
[49:39] but whatever the fullness is of what he
[49:42] wants us to be and what he wants us to
[49:44] have. Why don't you just press through
[49:45] that today? And if you're sick in your
[49:48] body, there's healing here for you. If
[49:50] you're worried and weary in your mind,
[49:53] there's peace for you this morning. And
[49:55] if you're struggling with something,
[49:56] there's clarity in your life. And I
[49:59] believe the word can do that today. So,
[50:01] we'll turn it to brother Sean from V
[50:03] from Virginia. So glad to have him and
[50:05] his family with us. Brother Judah, if
[50:06] you want to go ahead and and uh set his
[50:10] mic for him to this morning and he's
[50:13] going to preach and maybe sing for us as
[50:15] well, but we just believe the Lord will
[50:18] will have his way in the service this
[50:19] morning. Amen. Let's sing Amazing Grace
[50:23] as brother Sean comes this morning.
[50:25] Aren't you glad for grace? It was
[50:27] amazing
[50:30] grace.
[50:33] How sweet
[50:35] the sound.
[50:37] Oh that say. Why don't you lift your
[50:41] hands to him and tell him about it this
[50:43] morning like me.
[50:48] Oh, I once
[50:51] was
[50:54] but now
[51:10] Oh, praise God.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:16] Praise God.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:24] Praise God.
[51:26] Praise God.
[51:31] Oh, praise God.
[51:34] Praise God.
[51:37] Praise God.
[51:40] Praise God.
[51:42] Praise God.
[51:45] Praise God.
[51:48] Praise God. One more time. It's amazing
[51:51] grace. It's amazing.
[51:55] Aren't you glad for the grace of God
[51:58] this morning?
[52:00] [Music]
[52:02] Oh, that saves
[52:06] a wrench
[52:09] like me.
[52:13] Oh, I once
[52:16] was lost,
[52:19] but now
[52:22] I'm found.
[52:24] I was blind,
[52:27] but now
[52:29] I see.
[52:34] Amen.
[52:35] Well, we're so thankful for the grace of
[52:39] God.
[52:40] Amen. And men have tried to write songs,
[52:45] done their best to describe.
[52:48] Amen. What grace really means.
[52:51] Great sermons have been preached. Amen.
[52:54] But the human dialect just no language
[52:58] can ever describe truly what the grace
[53:01] of God is to us. Amen. But I'm certainly
[53:05] glad to know that it's touched my life
[53:08] and uh because when we get on the other
[53:11] side, all we can say is just by grace,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; God's amazing grace. Can you say amen?
[53:19] Do you love the Lord?
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be here in the house
[53:23] of the Lord. I don't think I'm going to
[53:25] sing. Um my brother's the singers, so
[53:29] we'll leave that to them. And u uh but
[53:33] we really just count it an honor uh to
[53:36] be here this morning and to u uh
[53:40] minister the gospel to you and
[53:43] appreciate u your pastor giving us the
[53:46] invitation. really enjoyed it yesterday
[53:49] and uh the food was great and uh my
[53:53] goodness, I uh gained a pound or two
[53:57] just from yesterday. But um uh uh we
[54:02] really had a good time of fellowship and
[54:04] really appreciate the hospitality
[54:07] um there that your pastor and um his
[54:10] wife has shown us. Amen. and good to
[54:13] have my children uh here uh with me and
[54:18] my wife couldn't make it. Uh she really
[54:20] was she was planning on it and uh my
[54:24] daughter is about to have her first baby
[54:28] and uh so she u I think was wanting mama
[54:32] to hang out there with her and so um um
[54:37] mom's back home. But anyway, we're here.
[54:40] So u you got us. Amen. But uh if you
[54:44] have your Bibles, we're going to turn to
[54:46] the book of Deuteronomy
[54:50] or read uh a few scriptures, but
[54:53] Deuteronomy the 29th chapter and then
[54:56] we'll turn to 1 Corinthians 2.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:07] But before we go into the word, may we
[55:10] just bow our hearts and talk to the
[55:13] Lord.
[55:15] Amen. We certainly need him, don't we?
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Father,
[55:20] Lord, we're certainly thankful for your
[55:24] grace and your touch upon our lives.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Father, we realize it's an eternal touch
[55:30] and that we'll never be the same again.
[55:34] And father, we're just asking Lord that
[55:37] you would come in your special way here
[55:40] this morning.
[55:42] You know the needs that are present,
[55:44] Father.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And maybe Lord, you know what we will
[55:49] face next week or in the future. But
[55:52] Father, we're just asking that you would
[55:55] come and that you would touch this
[55:58] morning.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Father, we're unworthy of you, Lord. But
[56:02] Father, if you would just come and
[56:04] anoint the gift that you placed within
[56:07] me, anoint your people.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Father, that you would bless
[56:11] the pastor here, Brother Ben, and bless
[56:14] the congregation, Lord, as Father,
[56:17] they're pressing the battle here in
[56:19] Hardy, Lord, and making ready for your
[56:23] soon coming. And father may just what
[56:26] words we would have to say would be
[56:29] edifying to the church here. We ask it
[56:33] father in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[56:36] church says
[56:38] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. So we we look at
[56:43] Deuteronomy the 29th chapter and I'm
[56:46] just going to read the 29th verse here
[56:49] but it says the secret things. Everybody
[56:52] say the secret things.
[56:55] belong unto the Lord our God. But those
[56:58] things which are revealed belong to us
[57:02] and to our children forever, that we may
[57:06] do all the words of this law. Amen. Then
[57:11] if you'll turn first Corinthians uh 2.
[57:16] Amen. 1 Corinthians 2 and um
[57:21] we'll start at the the ninth verse.
[57:29] But it says, "But God hath revealed them
[57:32] unto us by his spirit."
[57:36] We could go uh maybe start at the ninth
[57:38] verse. But as it is written, I hath not
[57:41] seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
[57:44] into the heart of man the things,
[57:47] everybody say, the things
[57:49] &gt;&gt; which God hath prepared for them that
[57:52] love him. But God hath revealed them
[57:55] unto us by his spirit. For the Spirit
[57:58] searchth all things, yay, the deep
[58:00] things of God. For what man knoweth the
[58:03] things of a man, save the spirit of a
[58:05] man which is in him? Even so, the things
[58:08] of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[58:11] God. Now we have received not the spirit
[58:15] of the world, but the spirit which is of
[58:17] God, that we might know the things that
[58:21] are freely given to us of God. Then if
[58:25] you'll go one more, uh second
[58:27] Corinthians the 4th chapter.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:35] I believe it's the um
[58:39] 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and we'll
[58:43] start at the 17th verse. But it says,
[58:46] "For our light affliction, which is but
[58:49] for a moment, workketh for us a far more
[58:53] exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[58:57] While we look not at the things which
[59:00] are seen,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; But at the things which are not seen.
[59:05] For those things which are seen are
[59:07] temporal, but the things which are not
[59:11] seen are eternal. Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not looking at the
[59:16] things that are seen. We're looking at
[59:18] the things that are revealed.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. For they are eternal. You can have
[59:24] your seats this morning. And uh if I
[59:28] were to have a title, it would be uh we
[59:32] look at what is unseen.
[59:35] Amen. And um you know we're we're living
[59:39] in an age uh where there's so much
[59:43] negativity.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And everything is so negative. And uh uh
[59:50] you know I I've tried to encourage my
[59:52] children is if you go get a job, don't
[59:55] be negative about that job. You know,
[59:58] you're the one that went there. You're
[59:59] the one that asked to get hired. So
[1:00:02] don't run the job down just because you
[1:00:05] know the boss of sneeze is wrong or
[1:00:07] something, you know. But there's there's
[1:00:09] just so much negativity today and and
[1:00:13] it's it's not just negative about uh one
[1:00:17] another, but people are negative even
[1:00:19] about their themselves.
[1:00:21] and and they have uh we we have people
[1:00:25] you know people have complexes
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; uh you know and and it's easy to have a
[1:00:31] complex about yourself. It's easy to
[1:00:33] have a complex about the church or about
[1:00:36] whatever. But uh uh you know negative
[1:00:40] thinking and speaking negative words and
[1:00:44] uh uh actions become negative and and
[1:00:48] it's easy it's easy to be uh negative uh
[1:00:53] when we're looking at the negative.
[1:00:56] Amen. And and there is plenty of
[1:00:59] negative, amen, to to to look at. Amen.
[1:01:03] Uh you can look at your wife and see
[1:01:05] negative. You can look at your husband
[1:01:06] and see negative. Children can look at
[1:01:08] the parents and see negative. And and we
[1:01:11] can bring it into the church. You can
[1:01:13] look at your pastor and see negative.
[1:01:15] And he could look at the congregation
[1:01:17] and see negative. And and everybody's
[1:01:19] looking at the negative. and and before
[1:01:22] you know it, we're preaching negative,
[1:01:24] singing negative, talking negative,
[1:01:26] thinking negative. Everybody's just
[1:01:28] negative, you know, and uh so that's
[1:01:30] just the way it is. But God does not
[1:01:34] want us looking at the negative.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He he does it. And and so uh when
[1:01:40] we become Christians, uh we're not to be
[1:01:43] negative people. Amen. We're not to
[1:01:46] carry them traits of of negativity
[1:01:49] because the prophet tells us that
[1:01:52] Christianity has no negativity at all.
[1:01:56] There is no negativity in Christianity.
[1:02:00] Amen. So that tells us that we're not of
[1:02:02] the world. The world is negative, but
[1:02:04] we're not. Not as Christians. Amen.
[1:02:07] Because we we are Christians and there's
[1:02:10] no negativity in Christianity. Now, the
[1:02:14] Bible tells us that we are hes. Amen.
[1:02:18] Which means that we have an inheritance.
[1:02:21] Aren't you glad you're an heir of God?
[1:02:23] Amen. And and we have an inheritance.
[1:02:26] And uh uh so an an inheritance is
[1:02:30] something that is given and and the heir
[1:02:34] is what receives
[1:02:37] uh uh that that inheritance. So like in
[1:02:41] Galatians 3:18 just breaking in Paul
[1:02:44] says now if the inheritance be of the
[1:02:48] law it is no more of promise.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's telling us now that the
[1:02:55] inheritance that we have been given is
[1:02:57] not of the law. It's not of dos and
[1:03:00] don'ts. Amen. It it it's not uh it's not
[1:03:04] a conditional thing, but it's been given
[1:03:08] to us by a promise. Can you say amen?
[1:03:11] See, so God gave it the inheritance to
[1:03:15] Abraham by promise. Ain't that right? So
[1:03:19] there is a group of people that God gave
[1:03:23] his promises to.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? His promises is the
[1:03:29] inheritance. Amen. uh uh is our
[1:03:32] inheritance. Amen. Not negativity, not
[1:03:35] not nothing like that, but God's
[1:03:37] promises. Now, so Paul is saying that
[1:03:40] God gave Abraham the inheritance by
[1:03:44] promise. But now in Galatians 3:16,
[1:03:48] it says, "Now to Abraham and his seed
[1:03:53] were the promises made." Ain't that
[1:03:55] right?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe you're seed of
[1:03:57] Abraham? See, so it's not just uh the
[1:04:01] promises given in history. Amen. To a
[1:04:04] man called Abraham, but now to Abraham
[1:04:08] and his seed were the promises made.
[1:04:13] Amen. Seed. And so then we find that
[1:04:17] that the seed if if you if you just
[1:04:20] study what Paul uh says there in in
[1:04:24] Romans and in Galatians and uh BUT HE
[1:04:27] SAYS THE PROMISES WERE MADE TO Abraham
[1:04:30] and his seed which is Christ.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Now you just bear with me now. And the
[1:04:37] prophet says now notice it was one one
[1:04:41] was the seed singular. He said there's
[1:04:44] more than one promise and there's more
[1:04:47] than one person that's in included in
[1:04:50] the seed of Abraham. He says see there's
[1:04:54] one seed but many people of this seed.
[1:04:58] They were not just to Abraham alone or
[1:05:01] to Isaac alone. IT WAS TO ALL the seed
[1:05:05] of Abraham. THE PROMISES WAS MADE to
[1:05:09] each and every individual seed of that
[1:05:14] seed. Can you say amen?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; So Galatians 3:29,
[1:05:19] it says, "If you be Christ, then you are
[1:05:24] Abraham's seed." Ain't that right? So
[1:05:28] then, Brother Brandham would call the
[1:05:30] seed of Abraham the seed of promise, not
[1:05:34] of the law, but the seed of promise.
[1:05:37] Now, if we're if we're Abraham's seed,
[1:05:40] then we we automatically know. Now, you
[1:05:43] may have a little bit of Jewish blood. I
[1:05:45] I don't think I do, but but we're we're
[1:05:48] not seed of Abraham by a natural
[1:05:51] lineage. It it's not a natural thing
[1:05:55] that makes us seed of Abraham, but we
[1:05:58] are seed of promise.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. The seed of
[1:06:03] promise. Now, so we we find that even
[1:06:07] though we're not uh uh of the natural
[1:06:10] lineage of of Abraham, yet Paul would
[1:06:14] talk to us as the church in Hebrews 6
[1:06:18] and 12. And he says, "Be followers of
[1:06:21] them." Everybody say, "Be followers." BE
[1:06:24] FOLLOWERS OF THEM. AMEN. Who through
[1:06:27] faith and patience inherit the promises.
[1:06:32] Now, that doesn't mean to be be uh uh
[1:06:35] followers of a Jewish nation. AMEN.
[1:06:38] WE'RE NOT FOLLOWERS OF A NATURAL
[1:06:41] LINEAGE. But actually, the Bible the
[1:06:45] Bible uh puts a uh in the Old Testament,
[1:06:49] he he uh God would put people in there
[1:06:53] just for us who were heirs of the
[1:06:55] promise. that was not even of a lineage
[1:06:59] of of the natural lineage. And and that
[1:07:02] was Rahab the harlot. If you look at
[1:07:04] Rahab the harlot, see, she is one of
[1:07:07] those who who WHO THROUGH FAITH AND
[1:07:10] patience inherited the promise. AND PAUL
[1:07:13] IS TELLING US GENTILES who are not of
[1:07:16] the lineage of the Jewish Jewish
[1:07:19] lineage, the natural seed of Abraham.
[1:07:22] and and and he's telling us to to follow
[1:07:26] them who through faith and patience.
[1:07:28] Now, Rahab the harlot, she she was a
[1:07:32] gentile. She was a prostitute, a
[1:07:35] heathen. She was not in the lineage of
[1:07:38] Abraham. She had no rights to the
[1:07:41] covenant of Abraham. She had no rights
[1:07:45] to the blessings of God. She was not
[1:07:49] considered as one of God's chosen
[1:07:52] people.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? She was of another
[1:07:57] PEOPLE. SHE WAS OF ANOTHER NATION.
[1:07:59] ISRAEL WAS THE CHOSEN nation of God.
[1:08:02] Amen. See, and so actually Rahab, she
[1:08:06] was of the lineage of a PEOPLE THAT GOD
[1:08:11] TOLD JOSHUA TO DESTROY. SO, HERE IS A A
[1:08:16] a a chosen nation of God coming across
[1:08:21] that Jordan River TO DESTROY THE CITY OF
[1:08:25] Jericho and to destroy ALL THEM PEOPLE.
[1:08:30] FOR THEY were considered the enemy of
[1:08:33] God. And Raab WAS OF THAT PEOPLE. Raab
[1:08:39] was of that nation. Can you say amen?
[1:08:42] Amen. But see, GOD KNEW HER BEFORE THE
[1:08:46] FOUNDATION of the world.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so we find that that
[1:08:51] Rahab, she got in touch with these spies
[1:08:54] and the two spies that Joshua had sent
[1:08:56] over. Amen. To spy off the land and and
[1:08:59] and she um uh she hid them. She took
[1:09:04] care of them. She made a way for them to
[1:09:06] escape. But she she told them before she
[1:09:09] left. They left says, "We we fear you."
[1:09:12] Amen. We know you're coming and and we
[1:09:15] shake because of you. NATIONS SHAKE AND
[1:09:18] AND THEY FEAR because of you. Now, I'm
[1:09:20] going to ask you something. I want
[1:09:22] mercy. Amen. I I WANT MERCY UPON MY
[1:09:25] LIFE. YOU YOU YOU GOT A PROMISE ME. CAN
[1:09:28] YOU SAY AMEN? AND GOD GAVE HER A PROMISE
[1:09:31] OUTSIDE THAT COVENANT AND SAID, "IF
[1:09:34] YOU'LL HOLD THIS STRING," AMEN. OUT THE
[1:09:36] WINDOW, WHICH WAS A TOKEN, AMEN, when we
[1:09:39] come, Amen. then then you'll be safe.
[1:09:43] And she says, "Oh, but I I I don't only
[1:09:45] want me. I want my family saved." And
[1:09:48] and they said, "IF YOU CAN GET YOUR
[1:09:49] FAMILY UNDER THIS TOKEN IN THIS PLACE,
[1:09:53] they'll be spared." Can you say amen?
[1:09:56] See, and she became an heir to the
[1:09:59] promises because she married in a to
[1:10:02] Israel, the nation of Israel. Amen. We
[1:10:05] find also, Amen. It was through her
[1:10:08] line. Amen. That Christ came. Ain't that
[1:10:11] right? Amen. But then we find that her
[1:10:14] greatgrandson,
[1:10:16] Amen. Rahab the harlot's greatgrandson
[1:10:19] Boaz, Amen, married another little girl,
[1:10:22] Amen. Well, she had no rights, amen, to
[1:10:26] Israel. She was not an uh uh of the
[1:10:29] covenant of Abraham. She wasn't a part
[1:10:31] of Israel. Actually, she came from a she
[1:10:35] was a gentile, the prophet said. And she
[1:10:38] came out of a a nation of incest. Amen.
[1:10:42] The nation of Moab was born out of
[1:10:46] incest, which was an evil thing before
[1:10:48] God.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so, uh, we find that she
[1:10:54] had NO COVENANT WITH GOD. SHE WAS NOT
[1:10:56] PART of the Abrahamic covenant. She had
[1:10:59] no inheritance with the Jew. her
[1:11:02] mother-in-law Naomi, right? See, she was
[1:11:06] the one, the prophet said, who had the
[1:11:08] inheritance. Amen. Naomi had left the,
[1:11:12] if you know the story. Amen. Naomi had
[1:11:14] and her husband had left. Amen. Uh,
[1:11:17] Israel and went into the uh the lands of
[1:11:21] the Moabites, I believe. And and uh
[1:11:24] there, Brother Bram said, the moment
[1:11:25] they done that, they backslid. Amen. But
[1:11:28] they left because there was drought in
[1:11:30] Israel.
[1:11:31] And and years later uh uh uh God had
[1:11:35] visited Israel and there was plenteous
[1:11:37] and so Naomi returned and and and came
[1:11:41] back to Israel. Now uh Ruth said, "You
[1:11:44] know what? Uh uh my husband's dead and
[1:11:47] I'm going to follow you." And and Orpha
[1:11:50] says, "Well, I'm going to go too." And
[1:11:51] and the elmy discouraged them both.
[1:11:53] Says, "No, you you you go back." And
[1:11:56] Orpha did. She kissed her mother-in-law
[1:11:58] and and went back. But Ruth says, "No,
[1:12:01] your people's going to be MY PEOPLE.
[1:12:03] YOUR GOD'S GOING TO BE MY GOD." AMEN.
[1:12:05] YOUR your nation is my nation.
[1:12:07] EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE, I'M GOING to
[1:12:10] be. Amen. And she went with Naomi. Amen.
[1:12:13] And she saw Boaz. Now, Naomi represented
[1:12:18] uh Israel. The prophet said she lost her
[1:12:21] first estate and all of her goods had
[1:12:24] been sold at a public auction. She had
[1:12:28] been exccommunicated
[1:12:29] and and had gone away. But when when the
[1:12:33] elmy came back to her homeland, amen, we
[1:12:37] find that that she just couldn't come up
[1:12:40] to to what she had lost. Amen. It had to
[1:12:43] be redeemed
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; unto her. Amen. It had to be redeemed.
[1:12:48] Well, according to the law of
[1:12:50] redemption, there had to be a kinsman
[1:12:53] redeemer.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. She just couldn't come up there
[1:12:56] and say, "It's mine." There had to be a
[1:12:59] kinsman redeemer. Amen. And the price
[1:13:02] had to be paid. Amen. And so there was a
[1:13:05] Boaz. Amen. He saw Ruth. Amen. And he
[1:13:09] loved Ruth and he thought, "MAN, HOW AM
[1:13:12] I GOING TO GET HER?" WELL, HE COULDN'T
[1:13:14] GET HER without redeeming uh uh Naomi
[1:13:18] because uh uh uh Ruth was a part of the
[1:13:23] the estate of Naomi. Can you say amen?
[1:13:26] That's what a prophet said. Said Ruth
[1:13:28] was part of the estate. So he realized
[1:13:31] if I redeemed Nelie and and I redeemed
[1:13:35] her estate, I'm going to get Ruth. WELL,
[1:13:38] THAT'S WHAT JESUS DONE. HE BECAME a
[1:13:41] redeemer. and he redeemed Israel. But
[1:13:45] when he REDEEMED ISRAEL, HE GOT A
[1:13:47] GENTILE BRIDE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE come
[1:13:50] in. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? SEE, and so we
[1:13:53] find, Amen. Uh uh uh Ruth became heir to
[1:13:58] the promise. Amen. And through her
[1:14:00] lineage came Christ. Amen. See, and so
[1:14:04] we find Peter 1 Peter 2:9 says, "But you
[1:14:08] are a chosen generation, a royal
[1:14:11] priesthood and holy nation, a peculiar
[1:14:15] people." Ain't that right? That you
[1:14:17] should show forth the praises of him who
[1:14:20] hath called you out of darkness into his
[1:14:23] marvelous light, which in time PAST WERE
[1:14:27] NOT A PEOPLE, but now are the PEOPLE OF
[1:14:31] GOD. WHICH HAD NOT OBTAINED MERCY, BUT
[1:14:35] NOW HAS
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; OBTAINED MERCY.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; SO THROUGH FAITH and patience, be
[1:14:42] followers of them who through faith and
[1:14:44] patience INHERIT THE PROMISE OF GOD. SO
[1:14:48] NOT EVERYBODY, AMEN, inherited through
[1:14:51] the generation OR THROUGH THAT LINEAGE
[1:14:53] OF THE NATURAL SEED. BUT THERE WAS SOME
[1:14:56] PEOPLE THAT GOD JUST SIMPLY SHOWED GRACE
[1:14:59] TO AND they became heir of the promise.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:15:07] Paul's talking to us. Now, there's been
[1:15:10] a redemption claim or made Christ our
[1:15:14] Boaz, amen, fell in love with us. And
[1:15:18] and now Paul is talking to this bride,
[1:15:20] us, and he says, "In Christ, we also
[1:15:24] have obtained an inheritance."
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've obtained an
[1:15:28] inheritance?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just church members
[1:15:31] here.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, good grief. You're not JUST HERE
[1:15:34] LEARNING ABOUT DR. DOBSON OR SOMETHING
[1:15:36] LIKE THAT. NO, there's been an
[1:15:39] inheritance given to you. And we've
[1:15:42] obtained this inheritance, being
[1:15:44] predestinated
[1:15:46] according to the purpose of him who
[1:15:48] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:15:50] his own will. Now, Brother Brandham says
[1:15:52] this, "We've obtained an inheritance."
[1:15:55] Somebody has to leave you something. So,
[1:15:58] God before the foundation of the world
[1:15:59] left you something, a name written on
[1:16:03] the book
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE LAMB would be slain, you
[1:16:06] would be recognized with it.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Are aren't you glad for that? The lamb
[1:16:11] was just wasn't slain just for
[1:16:12] everybody. Amen. But for those names
[1:16:15] written ON THAT LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, the
[1:16:18] lamb was slain for them.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Now, another place, the prophet says, "I
[1:16:24] have an inheritance, an inheritance of
[1:16:27] eternal life." Now, God sent Jesus to
[1:16:30] make that inheritance real to me because
[1:16:33] there was nothing I could do to inherit
[1:16:35] it. See, it was blank. It was valid.
[1:16:38] There's nothing I can do. But in the
[1:16:40] fullness of time, God sent in his own
[1:16:43] good time Jesus, the lamb slain from the
[1:16:46] foundation of the world. His blood WAS
[1:16:49] SHED THAT I MIGHT GO TO my inheritance
[1:16:52] to be what? What? Inheritance to sunship
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; to be a son of God.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; So we are hes
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; now. So, so you know uh uh the Bible
[1:17:05] says in one place we are heir of the
[1:17:09] world for the world belongs to us. Do
[1:17:12] you believe that?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; The world belongs to us. Now I know the
[1:17:16] world's got their monetary things and m
[1:17:19] materialistic things but in all reality
[1:17:22] the world belongs to us.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we don't want this world in
[1:17:26] the system that it's in. corruption and
[1:17:28] the murders and the rapes and the wars
[1:17:31] and the bloodshed. BUT GOD'S PROMISE
[1:17:33] THAT THIS WORLD belongs to us.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. The Bible says the meek
[1:17:39] shall inherit the earth.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; But also it says we are heir of all
[1:17:45] things.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you may not have a lot of
[1:17:49] money, but you're heir of all things.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. THIS IS WHY IT'S NO PROBLEM THAT
[1:17:55] WHEN WE'RE SICK, we just ask our father
[1:17:57] for healing and he gives it to us
[1:17:59] because I'm heir of all things. Amen.
[1:18:02] Even when I'm needing money, Amen. and
[1:18:04] my bills are are due and and and I've
[1:18:07] done all I know to do and and and and I
[1:18:10] I I'm needing that. Amen. Don't you
[1:18:12] believe that God can still provide? I've
[1:18:15] seen God provide many times because I'm
[1:18:18] heir of all things. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, we find also in Romans
[1:18:26] 8:17, Paul tells us that we are hes of
[1:18:30] God.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just heirs of the earth.
[1:18:34] We're not just heirs of all things. We
[1:18:37] are heir of God. Oh my. Well, how can we
[1:18:42] BE HEIRS OF GOD? BECAUSE WE'RE SONS AND
[1:18:44] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE'RE PART OF GOD.
[1:18:47] WE'VE GOT HIS GENETICS in us. Can you
[1:18:51] say amen? We were made in the image of
[1:18:53] God. So here the prophet says, "Man in
[1:18:57] the beginning when he was made, a man is
[1:19:00] a God." He's absolutely a God for he was
[1:19:04] made in the image of God being a son of
[1:19:07] God. And then he's
[1:19:11] of all that God is.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Now church, that's not a misstatement.
[1:19:19] HE DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY heir that all that
[1:19:21] God has.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; He said all heir to all that God is.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Now, church, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN BE AN
[1:19:29] HEIR TO ALL THAT GOD IS IS YOU'RE A SON
[1:19:31] AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE HIS LIKENESS. YOU HAVE HIS
[1:19:35] ATTRIBUTES. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. As God rules, so do you rule.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; AS GOD SPEAKS, SO DO YOU SPEAK. AS GOD
[1:19:44] THINKS, SO DO YOU THINK. AS GOD'S nature
[1:19:47] is, so is your nature because it's him.
[1:19:50] You're heir to everything that God is.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we make so much times. Amen.
[1:19:58] The world has made church so different
[1:20:01] from what God is.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; We just go to church. We're poor little
[1:20:04] peasants. We're trying and we're barely,
[1:20:06] Amen. making it. God's up there
[1:20:08] victorious and we're just down here. I
[1:20:10] just don't know. Amen. But here come a
[1:20:12] PROPHET TO TELL YOU, HOLD IT. THIS is
[1:20:15] what an heir means. IS WHAT GOD IS YOU
[1:20:18] ARE.
[1:20:20] YES, SIR.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S VICTORIOUS, YOU'RE VICTORIOUS.
[1:20:23] IF GOD HAS NO ENEMIES, YOU HAVE NO
[1:20:25] ENEMIES. IN OTHER WORDS, IF EVERY ENEMY
[1:20:28] IS under his feet, they're under your
[1:20:31] feet.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; If God can overcome, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:20:35] OVERCOME. THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, "AS I
[1:20:37] HAVE OVERCOME, SO SHALL YOU OVERCOME."
[1:20:40] THE SAME GOD THAT WAS IN HIM IS IN YOU.
[1:20:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; So, here's a prophet now saying, "The
[1:20:51] members of the virgin bride will love
[1:20:53] him and they will have his potentials."
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. How many believes
[1:20:59] you got his potentials?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; I know you got a mirror at your home and
[1:21:06] you're looking at it and everything's
[1:21:08] starting to sag the older you get.
[1:21:13] Come on.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said this, the B, Paul
[1:21:16] says, this is a mirror, too.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, in this mirror, I
[1:21:21] don't see a sinner.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON, PRE.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; IN THIS MIRROR, I DON'T SEE MYSELF
[1:21:26] DEFEATED.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; IN THIS MIRROR, I I DON'T SEE MYSELF A
[1:21:30] VICTIM.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; In this mirror, I DON'T SEE MYSELF going
[1:21:33] to hell.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; In this mirror, I'm starting to see the
[1:21:36] LIKENESS OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:21:39] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? FOR I'M an heir to
[1:21:42] everything that God is.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:21:51] you know, it's in this day that our
[1:21:53] inheritance has been shown to us.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; That we are heir to the power of
[1:22:00] creation.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:22:05] were heir to the power of creation.
[1:22:09] Those things that are not.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's why Abraham, he looked not at THE
[1:22:15] THINGS THAT COULD BE SEEN,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE COUNTED THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT
[1:22:19] AS THOUGH THEY WERE.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; He was heir TO THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON, PREACH.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:30] Now, you remember a prophet talking
[1:22:32] about he went to go hunting.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that story?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Now, he's not just telling it just to
[1:22:40] tell it now.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; He's telling us exactly what we're heir
[1:22:43] to. God showing through him what we're
[1:22:45] heir to.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And and there was no squirrels.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And God says, "How many squirrels do you
[1:22:52] want?"
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Well, he just thought he was thinking
[1:22:54] that up and and and finally came to him.
[1:22:58] No, this is God Jehovah asking me,
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; "How many squirrels do I want?"
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, I want three." Right?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak and you shall have them.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; You You know the story.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; He spoke at one of them one of them
[1:23:15] times he couldn't he he couldn't find
[1:23:18] that squirrel.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And he was going to go home.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And the voice said, "But you said
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; holding him to his OWN WORD."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WASN'T JUST A WORD OF A MAN.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; COME ON, PREACHER.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A CREATIVE US.
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Now, in Hebrews 6:17,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Paul says that we're heirs of promise.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're heirs of promise. All that
[1:23:52] God has promised, we're heir to. Ain't
[1:23:54] that right?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; So now, his word is his promise.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe God can do anything he
[1:24:04] wants to, but where my faith is is in
[1:24:07] this word.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's what he's promised.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And if he promised it, I'M HEIR TO IT.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, so we're heirs. Every promise
[1:24:20] that God made is written in the word of
[1:24:23] God.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the prophet tells us that the
[1:24:26] Bible is God's thoughts in seed form.
[1:24:30] And God's thoughts about you are written
[1:24:34] in the Bible.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to find out really what you
[1:24:40] are, it's in the Bible. Not not about
[1:24:43] you being a sinner and not about you you
[1:24:46] know painting the town red and all your
[1:24:48] mistakes. No, no, no. I mean, you were
[1:24:52] that way through your natural the the
[1:24:54] natural conception of your parents and
[1:24:56] things like that. But but we're TALKING
[1:24:58] ABOUT WHAT GOD THOUGHT OF YOU.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; WELL, see Jeremiah 29:11, God says, "I
[1:25:07] know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:25:09] you."
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace. Everybody say
[1:25:11] thoughts of peace
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; not of evil
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; So I want to just say this. Satan can
[1:25:20] never inject an evil thought in God's
[1:25:23] mind toward you.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's power.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; No matter how bad and convincing that
[1:25:30] devil is, he'll never get God to change
[1:25:32] his mind about you.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Well, the prophet said God's thoughts
[1:25:40] are eternal and they're real.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TELLS US WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS
[1:25:44] HE HAD. THEY WERE THOUGHTS OF PEACE.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; NOT THOUGHTS of evil, not thoughts of
[1:25:50] destruction.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Thoughts of peace.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And to bring you to an expected end.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Good. Thank you.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, the Bible says that Satan
[1:26:03] stood before God accusing us. He's the
[1:26:06] accuser of the brethren. And and this
[1:26:08] word accuse, it means to charge with a
[1:26:11] thought or with a fault and and to
[1:26:14] blame. And yet THERE IS NO ACCUSATION
[1:26:17] POWERFUL enough
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; to go to get God
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; to accuse us.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I know you already know these things.
[1:26:29] It's just simple
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; but I hope I can get it in your heart.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I hope you young people can get this
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; that no matter how condemned you feel,
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; God doesn't condemn you.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that brings condemnation.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LIVING A LIE
[1:26:46] AND doing your own thing, living
[1:26:48] hypocritical. But I I believe there are
[1:26:51] people that genuinely want to serve God
[1:26:54] with all their heart. How many wants to
[1:26:56] serve God with all your heart? Now,
[1:26:59] Satan knows this
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; and and so he knows THAT IS THE BEST
[1:27:03] THING, THE best weapon is to bring
[1:27:06] accusations to us and to let us know how
[1:27:10] low down we are, how unworthy we are,
[1:27:14] how misfit we are. AND HERE WE WANT TO
[1:27:17] SERVE GOD WITH EVERYTHING. AND WE find
[1:27:20] ourselves believing everything negative
[1:27:22] about us.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:26] But I'm here to talk positive
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; and the word OF GOD. IT'S NOT POSITIVE
[1:27:30] THINKING. IT'S JUST THE PROMISES that
[1:27:32] you're heir to.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; We're heirs.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; We're heirs of promise.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; So our final end is written in the word
[1:27:45] of God. NOW DO YOU KNOW THIS Bible is a
[1:27:48] mystery?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery book.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Book of mystery to the world. And did
[1:27:55] you know yet the prophet said it's a
[1:27:57] love it's a love letter.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; It's a book of mystery,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; but yet it's a love letter.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we've had men of men that stand
[1:28:07] behind pulpits and they take this word
[1:28:11] and it's a mystery. And so they look at
[1:28:13] the problems of the people and they
[1:28:16] think surely
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; surely
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; God will judge these people. and and and
[1:28:22] they become like a balum
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and they TAKE THE WORD OF GOD and they
[1:28:27] use IT AS A JUDGMENT against the PEOPLE
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; AND HERE'S A PROPHET WITH THE MIND OF
[1:28:33] GOD. SO NO, IT'S A LOVE LETTER.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Now, this book of mystery, it's only
[1:28:43] revealed to the heirs of promise because
[1:28:47] that's really who it was written for.
[1:28:50] Do you believe it?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; See, Luke 10:21, Jesus in his prayer
[1:28:55] said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord of
[1:28:57] heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
[1:29:00] these things from the wise and the
[1:29:01] prudent and hast revealed them unto
[1:29:04] babes."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; How many's glad you're a babe?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He's revealed them unto BABES SUCH AS WE
[1:29:13] LEARN.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Good. Now, in this this this
[1:29:19] class, in this category, I'm glad to be
[1:29:21] called a babe.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; For those now notice, revealed them unto
[1:29:34] babes. For father, it seemed good in THY
[1:29:38] SIGHT. NOW THE PROPHET SAID YOU KNOW THE
[1:29:41] BIBLE is written the message is not all
[1:29:44] together right on the letter but it's
[1:29:47] between the lines
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean you have to preach deep
[1:29:51] mysteries
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; IT JUST MEANS THAT'S WHERE THE
[1:29:55] REVELATION IS
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; PREACH
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S REVEALING MY INHERITANCE
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN BETWEEN THE LINE DOESN'T TAKE
[1:30:05] WHAT'S ON THE line
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; can you say amen Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "See, it's in between the
[1:30:11] line." Another place, when you try to
[1:30:13] put the Bible together with an
[1:30:14] intellectual understanding of it, you
[1:30:16] can't do that. It's a spirit written
[1:30:19] word
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; and it takes THE HOLY SPIRIT TO PLACE it
[1:30:24] together.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Remember what we read in the opening
[1:30:28] scripture. As it is written, I hath not
[1:30:31] seen,
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; nor ear heard,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; neither has it entered into the heart of
[1:30:35] man, the things that God has prepared
[1:30:38] for them that love him.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Now it cannot enter into your heart.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; It it cannot be heard with the ear or
[1:30:47] seen with the eye unless God reveals it.
[1:30:51] BUT HE SAYS, "BUT GOD HATH REVEALED THEM
[1:30:54] unto us by his spirit." Yes.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this is all right this
[1:31:03] morning,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; but remember in our opening scripture,
[1:31:06] the secret things belong to the Lord.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; He's the one that has the key to the
[1:31:12] secret things.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; It isn't a preacher. It isn't a pope. It
[1:31:16] wasn't even a prophet.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAS THE SECRET BELS BELONG TO
[1:31:24] THE LORD.
[1:31:26] But those things that are revealed
[1:31:30] belong to us.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad God sent a prophet?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Because it couldn't be revealed without
[1:31:39] a prophet.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; DON'T EVER LET THIS MESSAGE GET COMMON
[1:31:43] TO YOU.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET BECAUSE HE WANTED TO
[1:31:47] REVEAL an inheritance
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; to the heir of promise.
[1:31:53] I know IT SEEMS STRANGE SOMETIMES. WHAT
[1:31:55] you hear the prophet say seems strange
[1:31:57] and out of the this world. It's because
[1:31:59] the world knows nothing of it.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THEY AIN'T PREACHING the
[1:32:04] promises like a prophet preached it.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; No, no matter how educated they are,
[1:32:11] they can go to seminaries and they can
[1:32:12] preach the best sermons and yet not
[1:32:15] preach what a prophet brought out.
[1:32:18] Because those things which are hidden,
[1:32:20] the secret things that BELONG TO THE
[1:32:22] LORD now reveal to a prophet.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; See, down through the years, men have
[1:32:30] probed out this book.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Trying to understand the secrets of
[1:32:36] God's mind. Trying to truly understand
[1:32:42] the meaning of God's word.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Why was it written in the
[1:32:46] way it was?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Why did it say certain things?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; I've I we we you know heard a heard a
[1:32:53] minister one time say that the book of
[1:32:56] Esther
[1:32:58] has no place in the Bible. It makes no
[1:33:00] sense.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Talking to another man. Amen. Trying to
[1:33:05] tell me that divine healing there was no
[1:33:07] such thing as divine healing. He was a
[1:33:09] minister at a certain certain
[1:33:11] denomination. And and I I I quoted
[1:33:15] Hebrews 10 uh uh 13:8 and and Jesus
[1:33:19] Christ same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:20] forever. He said, "That ain't even
[1:33:22] inspired." He said, "Paul said, "Why
[1:33:25] would Paul put that in there?" He said,
[1:33:26] "If you read the whole chapter, read the
[1:33:28] whole chapter, it's like some man just
[1:33:31] throw that in there."
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "It doesn't even make sense."
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, blind, blind,
[1:33:39] blind."
[1:33:40] But see, in this day, God has revealed
[1:33:44] it to us.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; We're not looking at these things as
[1:33:48] misfit, mischaracterized, and all of
[1:33:51] these things. It's painting a picture
[1:33:54] from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:33:56] And I'm seeing myself in the book.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, so we are heirs to
[1:34:06] what has been revealed.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:12] You love him.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; So, we find that in this book is where
[1:34:19] our inheritance lays. It's written out.
[1:34:22] It's there, but yet it's unseen to the
[1:34:24] unbeliever.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Now, it's it's proven fact that
[1:34:28] something can be seen
[1:34:31] and yet at the same time, it can't be
[1:34:34] seen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It's proven fact that it can be there
[1:34:37] and yet not seen. Come on.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I do that a lot. Just just me.
[1:34:46] I can look in the refrigerator and say,
[1:34:48] "Hey, babe."
[1:34:52] I'm telling off on myself. Where's the
[1:34:54] mane? Well, it's right there. Well, I
[1:34:57] can't see it.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I know y'all don't do that, but I sure
[1:35:03] do. I can't see it. She'd come all the
[1:35:06] way downstairs just to show me where
[1:35:07] that mayonnaise is. Oh, I don't know. I
[1:35:12] Something just put it there. I guarantee
[1:35:14] it.
[1:35:18] But it can be there and yet can't be
[1:35:21] seen.
[1:35:23] And and we find that that's in the
[1:35:26] Bible. Actually, one time uh the enemy
[1:35:29] had surrounded a city and the prophet
[1:35:33] Elisha was there with his servant and
[1:35:37] his servant come out and first and he
[1:35:40] looked over the wall and saw all these
[1:35:41] people there.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; In their armor and everything and he
[1:35:46] starts to panic talking about having
[1:35:48] anxiety.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; He had it.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; His heart starts failing for fear.
[1:35:57] and and he starts oh man he just goes in
[1:36:01] a panic attack and you know and probably
[1:36:03] like what wrong with you
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; and he says well come out and look he
[1:36:08] says we're surrounded we're
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; you know finally Elisha looks out there
[1:36:12] and says well more are they with us than
[1:36:14] they are with them
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; now you know that servant being the
[1:36:19] carnal man he's probably thinking man
[1:36:21] he's lost his marbles
[1:36:24] cuz I can't see nothing but the enemy.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Right? But see, Elisha was seeing
[1:36:30] something and it was there
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; but the servant could not see it.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; So, so what Elisha was seeing,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; it was giving him hope.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; What Elisha was seeing WAS GIVING HIM
[1:36:43] JOY.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT ELISHA WAS SEEING, HE SAW VICTORY.
[1:36:47] WHEREAS THE SERVANT, WHAT HE WAS SEEING,
[1:36:49] HE WAS LOOKING,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; you know, getting ready to write out his
[1:36:55] last will and testament.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Finally, the prophet began to pray. So,
[1:37:00] Lord, just open his eyes.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; And when God opened his eyes, Elisha was
[1:37:06] a or that servant was able to see the
[1:37:08] same thing that Elisha saw.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh my. Aren't Aren't you glad for
[1:37:14] that? See?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; And and and so we we find Amen. The
[1:37:18] prophet said, "See, they were there all
[1:37:20] the time." But the servant just couldn't
[1:37:24] see them. Can you say amen? Amen. See,
[1:37:27] now, now the angels were there. God
[1:37:30] didn't have to bring them down so that
[1:37:34] the servant could see.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; PREACH.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THERE. COME ON.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; GOD JUST HAD TO CHANGE THE SEEING OF
[1:37:43] THAT SERVANT.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And when he changed his sight,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; HE COULD SEE WHAT WAS THERE
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; ALL ALONG.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you, Lord. That's good.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Now, see, Brother Brham said, see, there
[1:37:59] was mount there was the mountains full
[1:38:00] of angels and fire and horses of fire,
[1:38:04] chariots of fire all around this
[1:38:06] prophet. He just changed the scene.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; THE THING IS ALREADY THERE.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK about us? Now
[1:38:17] Jesus says I will come to you.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Right a little while I will come to you.
[1:38:23] He says in in one place as one down he
[1:38:26] says at that day brother Bram said this
[1:38:28] day you shall know you shall know that
[1:38:33] I'm in my father. He in me, you in me,
[1:38:36] and I in you. Right.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; You will know. But then he says, "But
[1:38:42] the world will see me no more."
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; So there IS A PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY SEE
[1:38:49] HIM
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; know him
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; and the world's like, "Huh?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; What's going on?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I don't see a thing." Now, the Bible
[1:38:59] says men's hearts failing them for fear,
[1:39:02] looking after those things that are
[1:39:04] coming.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; What they're looking at is bringing
[1:39:09] fear.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; What we're looking at
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; is bringing a faith.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; We know he's here.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; How many believe he's here?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; He didn't leave with A PROPHET. THE
[1:39:24] PROPHET'S MINISTRY was to declare his
[1:39:27] presence here among us. He is here.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to get off for just a
[1:39:33] moment, but why is he here?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus gave a promise.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go away.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm got to go away.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; But see, I'm going there to prepare a
[1:39:45] place for you.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; That where I am, you may be there also.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; So, he says, I'm going to come. I'm not
[1:39:52] going to leave you. I'm going to come
[1:39:54] again
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; and receive YOU UNTO MYSELF.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; NOW, CHURCH, I just happen to believe
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; that he's come among us.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; To receive us unto himself.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; That mighty angel coming down.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16. FOR THE LORD
[1:40:18] HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND WITH A SHOUT.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. Ain't that right? A VOICE AND
[1:40:24] A TRUMP. AND THEN WHAT'S TO HAPPEN? That
[1:40:27] we which are alive and remain, the dead
[1:40:29] in Christ are going to rise first. And
[1:40:32] we which are alive and remain are going
[1:40:33] to be caught up together with them to
[1:40:36] meet the Lord in the air.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; AND YET THE WORLD CAN'T SEEK HIM. YES,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:40:45] Come on, preach. Come on
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; here. We've got every excuse to panic.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. We've got every excuse to fear.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; We've got every reason around us, AMEN,
[1:40:55] TO FALL APART.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN THE SAME WORLD THAT
[1:41:00] EVERYBODY ELSE is living in,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; but our seeing is different.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? I'M NOT HEIR TO
[1:41:10] TRIBULATION.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; I'm an heir of a rapture.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I'M HEIR TO A BODY CHANGE. I'M GOING TO
[1:41:18] BE ONE SITTING AT THAT MARRIAGE SUPPER
[1:41:20] OF THE LAMB.
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He's here. He's come to get me.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; The world will no longer see me. This
[1:41:36] why Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes,
[1:41:38] for they see.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed are yours, for they hear." Ain't
[1:41:42] that right? See, God changed our seeing.
[1:41:47] So we could see the unseen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The promises are laying in the book.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Our inheritance is there.
[1:41:58] This book, the Bible, is a sacred thing
[1:42:00] to God. And it's a sacred thing to the
[1:42:05] heirs of promise.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And this is why it's such a sacred
[1:42:10] thing. This is why God pronounces a
[1:42:12] curse to any man that would try to add
[1:42:14] to it or take away from it.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ain't ain't we we we we ain't
[1:42:19] to add. Amen. Because the prophet said
[1:42:21] when you do all that and you dislocate
[1:42:23] and misplace and all of these things,
[1:42:26] then you have the the cow on top of the
[1:42:28] tree eating grass and the picture's just
[1:42:31] wacko. Well, God would send a prophet to
[1:42:35] reveal the word to us to paint the
[1:42:38] scenery
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; to PUT EVERY PIECE OF THE PUZZLE
[1:42:42] TOGETHER.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; To where I DON'T HAVE TO FEAR THE WHITE
[1:42:47] THRONE JUDGMENT.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT MY PLACE.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:57] Now in this last day, God has sent the
[1:43:01] spirit of truth
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; to tutor us.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; To lead us to guide us into all truth.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; the spirit of truth, the prophet said,
[1:43:14] is the spirit of the word.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And it is showing us or revealing to us
[1:43:22] the word, which is our inheritance.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:26] Paul in the book of Ephesians says that
[1:43:29] this spirit of truth is the spirit of
[1:43:32] promise.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; The one who gave the promise is here
[1:43:37] among us to reveal the promise.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF truth that came
[1:43:47] down.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; ONLY CHRIST IT COULD BE. YES.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; AND HE DESCENDED
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; WITH SOMETHING IN HIS HAND.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. COME ON. COME ON. PREACH.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; It was an open book.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; And remember the prophet said, remember
[1:44:10] this seventh angel is on earth at the
[1:44:13] time of this coming.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Why? The seventh angel is a prophet and
[1:44:19] the word COMES TO A PROPHET.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON. COME ON.
[1:44:24] Can you say amen?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID, "WHAT IS A
[1:44:28] PROPHET?" It's a revealer of the word.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET IS A REVEALER.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; It's not to get you emotionally high.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; It's It's not to get you all excited,
[1:44:42] which we're glad for that.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad for emotions. We're
[1:44:46] glad for feelings. We're glad for these
[1:44:48] things. But your feelings will fail.
[1:44:50] Your emotions will fail. all of these
[1:44:52] things. But when God sent a prophet,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; G,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; he come to reveal our inheritance.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He had kept these secret things in his
[1:45:04] mind. They belong to him. Now he's going
[1:45:08] to give it to the people.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now notice and I hope
[1:45:14] this all right but brother Bram said the
[1:45:16] first thing that represented that
[1:45:18] redemption come the lamb that had been
[1:45:20] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:45:22] He took the book.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; GLORY. OPENED THE BOOK, tore off the
[1:45:29] seals, sent it down to earth to a
[1:45:32] seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:45:34] people.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Now, and I'm not going to keep you long.
[1:45:38] I don't know where I'm at on my hour,
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; but okay, you got me.
[1:45:42] But I want to say this. We're living in
[1:45:44] the age of adoption.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I I thank God for everything that
[1:45:51] he's done. Sending us a prophet. We
[1:45:54] understand why he sent a prophet.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just to work miracles.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Remember the two pools was to gather us
[1:46:02] together, attract us.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; They were the attraction.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; But here we are now. Third pool, the
[1:46:10] opening of the word. Right. Right.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Third pull, the open of the word. I know
[1:46:16] ministers have taken this message,
[1:46:17] dissect it, fought and fussed and
[1:46:19] divided and all that. That is not what
[1:46:22] this message is about.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; God opened the seal, SENT THE REVELATION
[1:46:28] OF THE BOOK, WHAT WAS IN THE BACK PART
[1:46:30] OF HIS MIND, AND REVEALED IT TO US.
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; To empower you.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; That's good. Yeah.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; To place you.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; So, we're in this age of adoption.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Now, remember what brother Bram said
[1:46:49] about adoption.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; The father has a son.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And and he's busy with with the kingdom
[1:46:56] and all that that he has and he's he's
[1:46:59] got servants here and he's got this over
[1:47:01] here and he's he's busy operating
[1:47:03] everything and he ain't got time to
[1:47:06] tutor the son. So he hires a teacher, a
[1:47:09] tutor to come in and to teach the son.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a trusted friend, right?
[1:47:16] The tutor is a trusted friend. He knows
[1:47:18] the father in and out and and all of
[1:47:20] these things. Knows the ways of the
[1:47:22] father. And so this this this uh uh uh
[1:47:26] uh what the the point of the tutor
[1:47:29] teaching the son is the father has the
[1:47:32] dream and the desire amen to hand over
[1:47:36] the business to his son
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; to to bring him to an adoption
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; to where the son now can run the
[1:47:45] business. Can you say amen? So the
[1:47:49] child's inheritance is the father's
[1:47:51] kingdom.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; I I want to just throw this in there.
[1:47:56] The prophet said the kingdom of God is
[1:47:57] the word made power.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Not just letter.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; The word made power.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; You speak it.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You say it.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You declare it.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say shall happen.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So the inheritance is
[1:48:18] the father's kingdom.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet SAID WHEN THE CHILD WAS born
[1:48:22] he was a son but his conduct
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; everybody say conduct
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; had to do with his character
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; or his inheritance
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; can you say amen? So this tutor would
[1:48:36] teach the child. He would teach the
[1:48:39] child not about himself.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; He would teach the child the ways of the
[1:48:44] father.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; How the father conducted the business.
[1:48:47] Amen. He would tell him all about the
[1:48:49] kingdom that the father had. In other
[1:48:52] words, I I just just bear with me. I
[1:48:55] believe that the tutor took that boy and
[1:48:57] he began to show him his inheritance.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And he says, "Well, look what
[1:49:01] this is and look what that is and look
[1:49:03] how how this is being operated. Look how
[1:49:05] this is being conducted and look how
[1:49:08] this has been happening and and all of
[1:49:10] these things and and he began to give
[1:49:12] him tests and and and and these things."
[1:49:15] See, now I uh just to throw this in
[1:49:18] here, our inheritance has been revealed
[1:49:21] to us through the message.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Not psychology.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; THROUGH A PROPHET. THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, IF THE CHILD WAS OBEDIENT,
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; notice he starts taking on the ways of
[1:49:42] his father.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; He starts talking the way his father
[1:49:46] talked.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; He starts acting the way his FATHER
[1:49:50] ACTED.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; HE STARTS THINKING THE THOUGHTS THE WAY
[1:49:53] HIS father would think. CAN YOU SAY
[1:49:55] AMEN? HE STARTS HANDLING THE THINGS THE
[1:49:58] WAY HIS FATHER WOULD HANDLE THEM. AMEN.
[1:50:01] See why? Because he's now showing he's
[1:50:05] interested.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; He's interested in the father's kingdom.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; How many's interested in the father's
[1:50:16] kingdom?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I ain't interested in fighting with you.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON. I ain't interested in proving
[1:50:25] MY POINT.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; WHERE I'M RIGHT AND you're wrong.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Preach. Come on.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; I'M INTERESTED IN THE FATHER'S KINGDOM.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So then the prophet says that
[1:50:40] the tutor at a certain time would give
[1:50:42] give report back to the father.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, buddy. Billy Bob. Billy Bob,
[1:50:50] you would be so proud of Bob.
[1:50:54] man, he just handles everything the way
[1:50:57] you handle it. I tell you what, I give
[1:50:59] him all kinds of tests and all and he
[1:51:01] doesn't just go and say, "Well, I'm
[1:51:03] going to do my own thing."
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I tell him how you handle it and
[1:51:07] he just does it AND IT WORKS OUT.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; OH, HE'S past his teenage years.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Where he knows more about the father
[1:51:17] does.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:22] HE'S PASSED THAT POINT TO WHERE he Well,
[1:51:25] I know my father's done good, but boy,
[1:51:27] you just get me in the saddle. I'll do a
[1:51:29] lot better. Oh, no, no, no. He He's an
[1:51:32] obedient son. Oh, he's worthy. Can you
[1:51:34] say amen? And notice the prophet says,
[1:51:37] "See, that little fell is one of the
[1:51:38] smartest little chaps I've ever seen.
[1:51:41] Even though he's youthful, he's a chip
[1:51:43] off the old block. HE LOVES YOU. HE'S
[1:51:46] JUST EXACTLY LIKE YOU. HE'S ABOUT YOUR
[1:51:49] BUSINESS. HE STANDS JUST EXACTLY FIRM on
[1:51:52] what you say.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SAY, HE BELIEVES.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU SAY, HE SAYS.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; He just like you.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; See, so then the boy comes to that
[1:52:11] place. He's learned how to handle the
[1:52:14] kingdom through all the tests and all
[1:52:17] the things that he's gone through. He
[1:52:19] still believes what a father says. Still
[1:52:22] says what the father says.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Still handles it the way the father
[1:52:25] would handle it.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; He's learned not to listen to the
[1:52:32] negative.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; HE'S LEARNED NOT TO GO BY FEELINGS.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; He's learned NOT TO DEPEND ON
[1:52:39] SENSATIONS.
[1:52:41] HE JUST SIMPLY TAKES YOU AT YOUR WORD.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; That's where the Pentecostals had a
[1:52:51] problem.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; They went for emotions.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; They went for feelings.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Well, not all the time are you going to
[1:52:57] feel like you're saved.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Not every time you're going to feel like
[1:53:03] you're a Christian.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Not every time you're going to feel like
[1:53:06] you're going in a rapture.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE
[1:53:10] FATHER SAYS I AM GOING IN A RAPTURE.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; THE FATHER HAS REVEALED THE INHERITANCE.
[1:53:17] AND I'LL SAY what a f my father says.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; So then what happens? He was placed over
[1:53:25] the inheritance through adoption given
[1:53:28] authority. Spoke in the father'sstead.
[1:53:31] His signature on the check was just as
[1:53:33] good as the father. Everything was under
[1:53:35] his command.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Then the son comes into legal possession
[1:53:40] of his inheritance because he now has
[1:53:42] the authority to speak and everything
[1:53:44] obeys him.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; See, so the voice of authority was now
[1:53:49] in the sun.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Just like it was when Jesus was adopted
[1:53:54] on Mount Transfiguration,
[1:53:56] God said, "This is my beloved son.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him."
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; You see, being an heir
[1:54:05] of an inheritance means nothing. If you
[1:54:07] have no authority.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; So this is why Paul says, "Thou art no
[1:54:14] more a son or a servant, but a son. And
[1:54:19] if a son than an heir."
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Now Paul would tell us we were
[1:54:27] predestinated. Everybody say, "I was
[1:54:30] predestinated
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; to the adoption of sons."
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:35] Abraham was predestinated
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; to be adopted.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW COULD GOD PREDESTINATE HIM
[1:54:45] BEFORE HE ADOPTED HIM?
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet said God knew what Abraham
[1:54:50] would do.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; And God knows exactly what you will do.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; He knows you're going to come out of it.
[1:55:02] YOU MAY BE IN YOUR TRIAL RIGHT NOW, BUT
[1:55:03] HE knows you're going to come out.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE DEVIL MAY BE WARNING YOU,
[1:55:08] BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS YOU BEFORE THE
[1:55:09] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE KNOWS YOU
[1:55:11] AIN'T going to give up.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; He knows you ain't going to give into
[1:55:14] that unbelieving spirit.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He forneew him. Can you
[1:55:21] say amen?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? So here, God's great
[1:55:26] mysteries, what the eternal God had as a
[1:55:30] mystery now has been unfolded, the
[1:55:32] prophet said, in Jesus Christ, then
[1:55:35] given right down to his church. What was
[1:55:38] once in God's mind is now in the bride
[1:55:42] of Christ. JESUS MAKING LOVE TO THE
[1:55:46] CHURCH, his bride, whispering secrets.
[1:55:49] Oh yeah.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's whispering secrets
[1:55:53] to you?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Now he says, "You know how you tell your
[1:55:59] wife things? You know, little girl
[1:56:00] you're going to marry, you love her so
[1:56:02] much, you just tell her the secrets.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; You get her up next to you and you and
[1:56:07] love you and everything. You know how it
[1:56:09] is." Well, that's what God Christ is
[1:56:11] doing to the church. He's letting her
[1:56:13] know the secrets. Just the secrets.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; It ain't to the world. IT'S TO HIS
[1:56:19] BRIDE.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; DID YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "NOT THESE FLIRTERS, I MEAN HIS
[1:56:27] WIFE."
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; AND BY having the revelation of his
[1:56:30] secret made known to them by his grace,
[1:56:33] how the grace of God, I hope you don't
[1:56:34] think this sounds personal. He says to a
[1:56:37] bunch of people, "But the secret that
[1:56:38] God is sharing with the whole church, if
[1:56:41] they would just receive it."
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And by revealing his
[1:56:48] secrets to this church, to the elect,
[1:56:53] he's changing their seeing.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; THIS BOOK IS BECOME A NEW BOOK.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; I know how it is. We were raised in the
[1:57:10] apostolic
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal.
[1:57:14] preacher wanted to put us in hell, he
[1:57:16] could just preach a fiery sermon, put us
[1:57:18] in hell, we'd be at an altar.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; We were on a emotional co roller coaster
[1:57:23] constantly.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Because we couldn't see ourselves in the
[1:57:30] book.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; So, it was the PREACHER THAT POSSESSED
[1:57:37] THE power over our emotions. Come on.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE PREACHER THAT POSSESSED THE
[1:57:43] POWER OVER OUR FEELINGS.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Over our faith.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:50] [Music]
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; That God is given the inheritance to his
[1:57:56] elect.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right.
[1:58:01] But brother Brandon said, "See, he
[1:58:02] breaks the seals, reveals, gives us his
[1:58:07] inheritance to his people.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; He gives the inheritance that he
[1:58:11] inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and
[1:58:15] freely gives it out to us. It all
[1:58:17] belonged to him. He was the one who
[1:58:19] redeemed. But instead of keeping it to
[1:58:22] himself, he gives it back to the
[1:58:24] people."
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; That's his love for us. And what's he
[1:58:29] doing in this age? Through the prophet's
[1:58:31] message, teaching us how to think,
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; teaching us how to act,
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; teaching us how to talk,
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; teaching us how to rule
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; above our emotions and subdue OUR
[1:58:43] EMOTIONS AND SUBDUE OUR FEELINGS,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; that when I DON'T FEEL SAVED, I CAN
[1:58:49] STILL HOLD TO THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY,
[1:58:52] "I AM SAVED." WHEN EVERYTHING IS JUST
[1:58:55] GOING WRONG AND CHAOS, I CAN STILL STAND
[1:58:58] WITH THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because God done it in his age.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, there was the world.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Chaotic, darkness, water covered the
[1:59:16] earth. And yet, God wanted a world. And
[1:59:20] instead of God looking at all of this
[1:59:23] that was down there, he looked at his
[1:59:25] word. Yes, sir.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; He believed in that word and he looked
[1:59:30] at WHAT HE COULD NOT see and said, "Let
[1:59:33] there be." And there was
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; What's he doing?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; He's putting the word in our mouth.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Not Oh.
[1:59:49] I just don't know.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; No, he's changing that.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Why? It's a tutor.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Now, as I wind it down, the things that
[2:00:06] were unseen to the world, John saw.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Did you know when the book was open, he
[2:00:12] shouted, he screamed, he rejoiced,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; and what did the prophet say? John must
[2:00:17] have saw his name.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT COULD NOT BE SEEN?
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Now became seen
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; and John saw himself in the book.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; He was able to read between the lines
[2:00:38] and see himself. Can you say amen? AND
[2:00:41] IN EVERY PROMISE THAT GOD MADE FOR THE
[2:00:44] BRIDE, I JUST BELIEVE John saw himself.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; He was the one that the promise was made
[2:00:55] to.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw himself in the book, too.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's the way he knew the word.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus saw himself in the
[2:01:06] word?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said that's how he knew
[2:01:09] the word. Come on.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Sure. And that's how he defeated Satan.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; He had power upon power, but he not used
[2:01:19] not one of them. He took the word.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; He took THE WORD THAT WAS REVEALED TO
[2:01:28] HIM and he defeated Satan.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother Bram said he did it to
[2:01:34] show that the weakest Christian can
[2:01:36] defeat Satan anytime,
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; anywhere. Amen.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Under any condition
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; by using the word of God.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how did Jesus defeat Satan?
[2:01:48] He knew what the word said. Everybody
[2:01:50] say, "He knew what the word said."
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; He believed what the word said.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; He confessed what the word said.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; That's how he defeated Satan.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; He knew what the word said.
[2:02:07] HE BELIEVED WHAT THE WORD SAID.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; HE CONFESSED WHAT THE WORD SAID.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; NOW, if you know the prophet said Satan
[2:02:15] knew the word, too.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Well, how am I going to defeat him then
[2:02:21] if he knows the word?
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Well, here's how it was. He knew the
[2:02:25] word in the Garden of Eden.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; He knew the word when he tempted Jesus
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; and he still knows the word today.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Now, notice the prophet said Satan know
[2:02:35] the word. He noted from A to Z. Well,
[2:02:39] you know what? I imagine he'd have a
[2:02:41] degree. He'd have enough titles to
[2:02:43] stretch across four or five pages of
[2:02:45] paper. Doctor, Reverend, Elder, PH, LL,
[2:02:49] QD, all the alphabet in every way. His
[2:02:52] degree would be in that Bible. He knows
[2:02:56] every word of it. He sure does.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew the word differently.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. Can you say amen?
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew the word by faith IN THE
[2:03:11] REVELATION OF GOD'S word in his OWN
[2:03:16] PREDESTINATED LIFE.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Anybody can read John 3:16.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Anyone can know all these other other
[2:03:26] scriptures.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew it differently.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Hello. Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; See, JESUS BY FAITH COULD PLACE HIMSELF
[2:03:36] in the word.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; SO, THE PROPHET SAID JESUS knew who he
[2:03:42] was.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Satan was wondering who he was.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Both knew the word.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS BY HIS WORD, BY THE WORD knew
[2:03:54] who he was.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Satan knew the word and was still
[2:03:58] wondering who he was.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[2:04:01] Are you with me?
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS BY FAITH, BY REVELATION, COULD
[2:04:07] PLACE HIMSELF IN THE WORD.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Satan knew the word, but he couldn't
[2:04:15] place Jesus in the word.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this, Satan knows the
[2:04:19] word, too, in this age,
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; but he can't place you in the word.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He can't place you in
[2:04:27] a rapture. HE CAN'T PLACE YOU AT THE
[2:04:29] MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. HE CAN'T
[2:04:31] PLACE you in a new body.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; But see, he came, THE LAMB CAME WITH THE
[2:04:37] BOOK open
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; and HE GAVE THE REVELATION TO THE
[2:04:41] PROPHET TO REVEAL IT TO US.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW THE WORD BETTER THAN THE
[2:04:47] devil does.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; FOR WE SEE OURSELVES in a rapture.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We see ourselves
[2:04:57] as heir to every promise of God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Well, do you love him?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[2:05:08] and worship him? SO GLAD. SO GLAD THAT
[2:05:13] we're heirs of promise.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; So glad. See, Satan couldn't see Jesus
[2:05:19] in the word. The religious leaders
[2:05:22] couldn't see Jesus in the word.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Most of the people couldn't see him in
[2:05:27] the word.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; But Jesus saw what they couldn't.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; When Jesus looked at that word, he saw
[2:05:38] himself in Moses's prophecy.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; HE SAW HIMSELF IN THE prophecy that was
[2:05:44] given to Eve as the woman's seed.
[2:05:47] HE SAW HIMSELF IN ISAIAH'S PROPHECY. HE
[2:05:50] SAW HIMSELF IN DAVID'S songs
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; and in his prophecies.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; He saw himself in Solomon's poetry.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; He saw himself in the types and shadows
[2:06:02] of the Old Testament. That's the way
[2:06:05] Jesus knew the word.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; He saw the unseen
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; and declared what he saw.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN?
[2:06:19] THE PROPHETS DECLARED WHAT THEY SAW.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; THEY SAID, "HE'S COMING. He's a will in
[2:06:25] the middle of the wheel."
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; He's the fourth man in the fire.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. COME ON.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; THEY DECLARED WHAT THEY SAW.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; They said, "He's a He's a prophet."
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; He's coming. He's Messiah. He's a
[2:06:39] woman's seed.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; And they began to declare. But when he
[2:06:43] came, he looked back at everything that
[2:06:45] they prophesied and said, "I'm that one.
[2:06:48] I'm that one. I'm that one. Can you say
[2:06:51] amen?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; In such a thing that he would say,
[2:06:54] "Destroy this temple and within three
[2:06:55] days I'll raise it up again."
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Did he not say that?
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Did you know he made that statement
[2:07:01] based off the word of God?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; A prophet said, "I'll not suffer my holy
[2:07:05] one to see corruption or leave HIS SOUL
[2:07:07] IN HELL."
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAW HIMSELF AS THAT HOLY ONE.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's how he defeated
[2:07:17] Satan.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID JESUS KNEW IT BY
[2:07:22] EXPERIENCE. He knowed it by revelation.
[2:07:25] He knowed that he was that son of God
[2:07:27] that was to come into the world. He
[2:07:29] knowed his standing. He knowed he was
[2:07:31] born in this world for that purpose. And
[2:07:33] that's the reason the word of God could
[2:07:34] work through him because he knowed what
[2:07:36] he was. Yes.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Another place. If Jesus defeated Satan
[2:07:40] upon the faith, knowing who he was, he
[2:07:43] was a predestinated creature. He said,
[2:07:45] "Are you ready? What about the
[2:07:47] predestinated bride of Jesus Christ?"
[2:07:49] Now,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; you believe the bride is predestinated.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; The bride, predestinated bride of
[2:07:54] Christ, now the church, the word seed
[2:07:56] with everything that God promised to put
[2:07:58] in the church is in it right now.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Well, do you love him? Amen.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; We could go on and on and on and I just
[2:08:08] love the word.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; I pray it's been a help to you today.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; But I I I'll tell you this. What do you
[2:08:15] see?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; What What do you see when you look at
[2:08:18] the word?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; You know, when you look at the Old
[2:08:21] Testament saints, Hebrews 11:13, it
[2:08:23] says, "These all died in faith, not
[2:08:25] having received the promises, but having
[2:08:28] seen them aar off."
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; So, they were looking at things that
[2:08:33] were not yet there.
[2:08:35] They were unseen and yet they were
[2:08:38] persuaded of them
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; and embraced them.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; See, they were living under the natural
[2:08:47] things of types and shadows.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; The natural lamb only spoke of the one
[2:08:52] true lamb to come. The natural priest
[2:08:55] only spoke of the true priest to come.
[2:08:58] The natural tabernacle only spoke of the
[2:09:00] true tabernacle to come. The natural
[2:09:03] altar was a type of the true altar to
[2:09:05] come. The natural scapegoat was only a
[2:09:09] type of the true one to come. Can you
[2:09:12] say amen?
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus saw it,
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am he."
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; And did you know?
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; The natural arc of the covenant was not
[2:09:26] the promise.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; It was only a type and shadow. Yeah.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; The natural Solomon wasn't the promise.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; The natural son of David wasn't the
[2:09:38] promise.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; The natural seed of Abraham wasn't the
[2:09:42] promise of Isaac.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; NATURAL JERUSALEM isn't the promise.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; The natural seed of Abraham isn't the
[2:09:50] promise.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; I'll say it this way. Ruth,
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Rahab.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; They're not the promise.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Glory.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; You're the promise.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; You're heir.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Of what they spoke of.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; It didn't point to Ruth. It pointed to
[2:10:18] me.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; IT DIDN'T POINT TO RAHAB. GLORY.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; It pointed to me.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; God was showing through them a promise.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; she's coming.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Look at Ruth. But don't look at just
[2:10:32] that natural. Look beyond. Here she
[2:10:34] comes. And now when the book is open, I
[2:10:37] see that I am that Ruth.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; I am the rehab.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; I am the one
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; that he has shown grace to.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; I am heir of the promise. Thank you,
[2:10:48] Lord.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; I am. Amen. Eve wasn't the promise. I'm
[2:10:52] the promise. Just as Adam wasn't the
[2:10:55] promise, Christ was the promise. CAN YOU
[2:10:58] SAY AMEN? BOAZ WASN'T THE PROMISE.
[2:11:00] CHRIST WAS THE PROMISE. AND SO HERE I
[2:11:03] AM. I'M the promise.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; What do you see?
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Do you see what the world can't see?
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song.

[2:16:17] we first
[2:16:20] began
[2:16:24] give the Lord a big hand clap of praise
[2:16:26] this morning.
[2:16:28] We are the generation.
[2:16:32] We're the culmination,
[2:16:35] the final voice the world will hear. The
[2:16:39] coming of the Lord is near.
[2:16:44] Living out the revelation,
[2:16:48] overcoming sins temptation. The truth
[2:16:52] will go to every tongue and nation.

[2:17:04] Sing it like you believe it now. Oh yes.
[2:17:08] We are the generation.
[2:17:11] Oh yeah. We're the nation, the final
[2:17:16] voice the world will hear. The coming of
[2:17:21] our Lord is near.
[2:17:24] living out revelation,

[2:17:32] will go to every tongue and nation.
[2:17:38] Oh yes, we are the chosen. Oh, if you
[2:17:43] believe it this morning, can you sing it
[2:17:44] one more time? Oh yes, we are. We are
[2:17:49] the generation.
[2:17:52] We're the call of nation. The final

[2:18:32] Amen. Aren't you? Aren't you thankful?
[2:18:34] Bless my heart
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; when he said Satan and Jesus both knew
[2:18:38] the word.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus saw himself in the word.
[2:18:42] When you see yourself in the word, you
[2:18:44] don't even think of yourself as your
[2:18:46] mistakes and your failures, but you see
[2:18:48] what God thinks about you.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I was looking at this flesh to
[2:18:51] make it, I couldn't make it. But aren't
[2:18:52] you glad he was looking at more than
[2:18:54] just an imperfect person, sir?
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; But he was looking at the blood. I'm so
[2:18:58] glad this morning to see my name in the
[2:19:00] book.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we don't have
[2:19:02] to look at our mistakes and our
[2:19:04] failures. Amen. But we can look at a
[2:19:06] perfect sacrifice. Amen. He chose me.
[2:19:09] And if he chose me, he don't make no
[2:19:10] mistakes. Aren't you glad about it this
[2:19:13] morning?
