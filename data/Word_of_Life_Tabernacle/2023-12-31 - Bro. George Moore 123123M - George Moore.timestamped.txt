[41:48] told Jezebel all that Elijah had done
[41:50] and with all how he had slain all the
[41:53] prophets with the sword and Jezebel sent
[41:55] a message messenger unto Elijah saying
[41:57] so let the gods do to me and more also
[42:00] if I make not thy life as the life of
[42:03] one of them by tomorrow about this
[42:05] time and when he saw that he arose and
[42:08] went for his life and came to bear Sheba
[42:11] which belongeth to Judah and left his
[42:13] servant there but he himself went a
[42:16] Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and
[42:18] came and sat down under the juniper tree
[42:21] and he requested for himself that he
[42:23] might die and said it is enough now oh
[42:26] Lord take away my life for I am not
[42:28] better than my father's and as he lay
[42:31] and slept under the juniper tree behold
[42:33] then an angel touched him and said unto
[42:36] him arise and eat and he looked and
[42:39] behold there was a cake baked on the
[42:41] coals and a Cru of water at his head and
[42:44] he did eat and drink and laid him down
[42:46] again and the angel of the Lord came
[42:48] again the second time and touched him
[42:51] and said arise and eat because the
[42:53] journey is too great for thee and he
[42:55] arose and did eat and drank and went in
[42:58] the strength of that meat 40 days and 40
[43:01] nights unto Horeb the Mount of God
[43:03] Saints I don't know what was in them
[43:06] cakes but whatever was in them cakes he
[43:08] went on the strength of those cakes 40

[47:13] been
[47:15] tired are you tired this
[47:17] morning I got one person
[47:21] yeah we all get tired Saints we all have
[47:25] when we're tired and and I I don't mean
[47:27] tired like like you worked all day and
[47:30] you're tired from working tired if you
[47:32] get tired like that you can sleep that
[47:34] off in a day or two that's right amen
[47:37] but I'm talking about the kind of tired
[47:39] where you say I don't want to think
[47:40] about nothing else tired that's right
[47:43] all right I I mean tired like I I've
[47:45] been pulled and I've been pulled and
[47:47] I've been pulled and I I don't want to
[47:48] mess with nothing else today I'm going
[47:50] to go home and go to bed and hope
[47:52] tomorrow's a better day yes I don't I
[47:55] mean tired like you've been to the gym
[47:57] too much I I mean tired like if if
[47:59] somebody ask me one more question I'm
[48:02] going to scream tired that's
[48:05] good I mean tired like some of you kid
[48:08] uh some of you mamas get when them kids
[48:10] won't shut up tired some of them some of
[48:13] them tired like if that kid smarts off
[48:15] to me one more time I'm gon choke him
[48:19] tired that kind of tired they're kind of
[48:22] tired like you Brothers get sometimes
[48:24] when you say I'm F to walk out of this
[48:26] job and quit and go find me something
[48:28] else to do I can't stand it no more
[48:30] tired
[48:33] on yes we all deal with it Saints if you
[48:37] go to church long enough you're going to
[48:39] deal with it in church too you going
[48:42] you're going you're going to deal with
[48:43] the frustration of you know what I'm
[48:44] just going to let them handle it they
[48:46] they act like they know everything to do
[48:47] anyways
[48:48] tired sir I'm done dealing with all of
[48:52] it tired I'm G to find me somewhere else
[48:54] to go tired
[48:56] I'm tired my mom used to tell me that
[48:58] when I was a kid she say look I'm tired
[49:02] now and what that meant was the beating
[49:05] was coming if I didn't go on
[49:07] somewhere but we sometimes we're just
[49:09] sick and tired of being sick and
[49:12] tired sometimes we all get tired and
[49:15] that's that's where Elijah was when we
[49:17] found him under that juniper tree and we
[49:20] found him we found him pulled away and
[49:22] and we found him up under that juniper
[49:24] tree and he was in such a condition
[49:26] saints that he just didn't know what to
[49:28] do and and he didn't know what was going
[49:30] on and brother brandham said that
[49:32] experience of the juniper tree he said
[49:35] there's many of us that find ourselves
[49:37] under that juniper tree and he says I
[49:40] get myself under there many times to a
[49:43] place that I don't know what to do he
[49:46] said you're
[49:47] flustrated all right now many Christians
[49:49] don't want to admit that and many people
[49:51] in The Bride don't want to admit that
[49:52] but when we don't know what to do Saints
[49:55] it gets frustrating sometimes now if it
[49:57] frustrated God's Prophet it'll frustrate
[50:00] me and you right see we don't always
[50:03] have everything all figured out and we
[50:05] don't always have everything all
[50:08] together sometimes we just don't know
[50:10] what to do
[50:12] Saints and he said frankly I'm under it
[50:15] right now wondering oh God what would
[50:17] you have me do have you ever been there
[50:19] Saints where you say oh God what do you
[50:21] want me to do what would you have me to
[50:22] do what's the purpose in all of this
[50:26] and it's frustrating to be there Saints
[50:29] and he says you know people under the
[50:31] juniper tree is like Elijah he said they
[50:34] like to sleep and he said I preached to
[50:36] more tired people than anybody in the
[50:40] world he said people is so tired they're
[50:43] so mentally strained until they're
[50:45] filling the insane institutions and the
[50:48] hospitals everywhere and he says they
[50:50] went in such a nervous condition till
[50:52] they don't know what they do believe he
[50:55] said they don't know what they do
[50:57] believe and if you think we're not there
[50:59] in the message today Saints you're
[51:00] fooling yourself there's so many people
[51:02] in the message today and they're sick
[51:04] and tired and they're tired but they
[51:06] don't know what they
[51:10] believe and he says they don't know what
[51:13] they do believe and they don't know what
[51:14] they
[51:15] want amen sometimes they stuff wrong and
[51:19] you don't even know how to fix it you
[51:21] don't know what would make it right you
[51:23] just know you don't like it
[51:25] that's amen I know I'm a
[51:28] husband and I know sometimes mama don't
[51:32] know what she
[51:37] wants oh you brothers are scared to give
[51:39] me an
[51:40] amen but that's the
[51:43] truth but I want you to notice this
[51:45] Saints it was when the anointing left
[51:48] Elijah that's what put him under that
[51:50] juniper tree it was when the anointing
[51:53] left him that he found himself under the
[51:55] the juniper tree see that's what we're
[51:56] facing Saints whenever you have a mount
[51:58] carel experience you're going to have a
[52:00] juniper tree coming right whenever
[52:04] whenever we we get out of a good
[52:07] meeting let's call it like this it's
[52:10] Monday after a good Sunday you're going
[52:13] to find yourself under the juniper tree
[52:16] sometimes it's when the anointing lead
[52:18] when you come to the house of the Lord
[52:19] and God blesses and and the Lord's
[52:21] moving on the scene for people and and
[52:23] people are delivered and people are
[52:24] being uh uh rejoicing in the spirit it
[52:27] it's it's it's wonderful it's the
[52:29] greatest thing I
[52:31] know but when you leave that
[52:33] atmosphere and you go back to all the
[52:36] problems you had before and you got to
[52:38] go back to work the next day and you and
[52:40] you got to go back to school the next
[52:42] day and and you got to get back to the
[52:44] regular Daily Grind then you find
[52:47] yourself tired and under the juniper
[52:50] tree and feeling sorry for yourself a
[52:52] little bit come on somebody
[52:55] see when you got a good Sunday watch out
[52:57] for Monday come on Amen brother Brown
[53:00] said usually after a great something
[53:03] watch for the enemy and he says and it
[53:05] was when Elijah's nerves was all upset
[53:08] and he was just about to break down
[53:09] anyhow that's when Jezebel acted up amen
[53:13] it's when you're weak it's when you're
[53:16] tired that the enemy attacks is that
[53:18] right and brother Brown said that's a
[53:20] trick of the devil and all Christians
[53:22] know that so if we all know that then
[53:26] why are we surprised when it happen
[53:28] Saints he said every man and woman
[53:31] that's ever witnessed a great experience
[53:32] in Christ knows how true that is do you
[53:36] know that's true Saints do you know if
[53:38] there's a great Sunday it's going to be
[53:39] a bad Monday
[53:41] coming do you know if you get something
[53:43] from the Lord the devil's going to be
[53:45] right there to try to make you take back
[53:47] what the Lord give you all right do you
[53:49] know you know if God heals you on Sunday
[53:51] you know you're going to feel terrible
[53:53] on
[53:54] Monday is that right you know if you get
[53:57] the victory over something on Sunday and
[53:59] you get delivered of something on Sunday
[54:01] then on Monday it's going to be right
[54:03] there nagging at you all right to try to
[54:05] make you doubt what the Lord did for you
[54:07] on
[54:08] Sunday amen he said every man or woman
[54:11] that's ever witnessed a great experience
[54:13] in Christ knows how true that is he said
[54:16] look at our Lord after his great Earthly
[54:18] coronation when he was baptized and God
[54:21] the Holy Spirit Come ascending Out of
[54:23] Heaven in the form of a dove and fill
[54:24] his Tabernacle he said immediately he
[54:27] was taken in the wilderness for 40 days
[54:29] and was tempted of the devil right now
[54:32] if that's that way for the lord it's
[54:33] going to be that way for you and I amen
[54:36] now let me let me stop right here and
[54:38] say this Jesus was tempted it's critical
[54:40] we understand this Saints Jesus was
[54:43] tempted of the devil he was
[54:47] tempted actually tempted like you and I
[54:51] are tempted see brother brandham said
[54:53] when you try to make when you try to
[54:55] chop Jesus's legs off and make him a
[54:58] little smaller God than God he said
[55:00] you're so wrong for that he said he was
[55:02] a man yes and he was tempted like your
[55:06] tempted and he was tried like your tried
[55:08] except he was without sin you see he
[55:11] knows what you're going through today
[55:13] and he knows what it feels like today
[55:15] and he's been tempted like you've been
[55:17] tempted he's been tried like your tribe
[55:20] but he overcame and because he overcame
[55:23] you'll
[55:24] overcome
[55:25] is that right Saints he was a man but he
[55:28] was a perfect
[55:29] man
[55:31] amen you were Redeemed by a
[55:35] Kinsman he says when you try to make him
[55:37] a Lesser God see it's a critical point
[55:40] that we got to understand it's it's not
[55:42] hard to imagine that God overcomes
[55:44] things like that but it's hard to
[55:46] understand that a man can overcome
[55:48] things like
[55:50] that amen and he knows how it feels he's
[55:55] a God today that can be touched by the
[55:57] feeling of your infirmities that means
[56:00] mental or physical weakness he's a God
[56:02] that can be touched by that because he's
[56:04] been through it himself yes right it's
[56:08] good so we got to be ready for the devil
[56:11] after these meetings we got to be ready
[56:13] for the devil on Monday we got to be
[56:15] ready for the devil on Thursday morning
[56:16] we got to be ready for the devil after
[56:18] God delivers us of something we got to
[56:20] start looking because here he comes Amen
[56:23] brother Brown said any p P's wife knows
[56:26] to watch him on Monday if he's had a big
[56:28] day on Sunday he said you might as well
[56:30] just let him sleep it off a little bit
[56:32] that's right it's the best thing for him
[56:34] to do he said and he said that's what
[56:36] God let Elijah do was sleep it off and
[56:39] he goes to show that when God's doing
[56:42] something Satan is always present to
[56:44] block it or tear it down or do what he
[56:46] can to interrupt it yeah right see he
[56:50] said he was wore out his nerves were all
[56:52] on edge just like the people today he
[56:54] said we we need a juniper tree he said I
[56:57] preach to tired people nervous people
[56:59] pray for nervous people and it's nervous
[57:02] neurotic upset world right now that
[57:04] we're living in and everybody's just on
[57:06] edge Saints I feel it myself somebody

[57:12] a host of them
[57:16] saints I left I left Tucson yesterday
[57:18] morning at 3:00 a.m. in the morning
[57:21] there was one car on the road and they
[57:23] cut me off
[57:27] and if this preacher could have got a
[57:28] hold of
[57:31] them it's a nervous age where are we
[57:35] going what we in such a hurry for what
[57:38] are we so upset about it's a pressure
[57:41] that's on the people that's right and
[57:44] it's at the people at Walmart and it's
[57:46] at the people at the drive-thru and it's
[57:48] on the people at work and it's on the
[57:50] people at school and it's on the people
[57:52] before they get to church yeah all right
[57:55] yes it's a pressure it's pressure in
[57:58] your home on Sunday
[58:00] morning yes and he said he said that's
[58:04] God's people is that way he said the
[58:06] world is that way and we all need a
[58:08] juniper tree a place to
[58:11] rest and he said and I trust that this
[58:14] convention will be a juniper tree so
[58:18] brother brandom talked about the church
[58:20] services that they were having as being
[58:22] a juniper tree to God's people
[58:25] yeah so when you say well I'm too tired
[58:27] to go to church really Saints you're too
[58:29] tired not to go right see it's you got
[58:32] to come here to get recharged you got to

[58:45] here for
[58:46] Saints amen you're you're not too tired
[58:48] not to come to CH you're too tired to
[58:51] come to church you're too tired not to
[58:52] come when you're tired that's when you
[58:55] need to come
[58:57] amen so if we get something on Monday
[59:00] the devil's always going to try to take
[59:02] it back yeah and now I remember when I
[59:05] was baptized my wife's grandfather told
[59:07] me he said now look brother George uh
[59:09] you just got baptized he said the devil
[59:11] don't like what you just did and he's
[59:14] going to be after you because he used to
[59:17] have you but now he don't amen whenever
[59:20] we make a move for God the devil will be
[59:23] after us he will be he will be pursuing
[59:27] to see if he can make us take back what
[59:29] the what the Lord did for
[59:31] us now I want you to notice so we find
[59:34] that the anointing leaves us and that
[59:36] leaves us
[59:37] tired also not being sure brother brand
[59:40] said of the next steps makes us tired
[59:44] yeah if you're not sure what to do and
[59:45] you're worried about what's next it
[59:47] wears on you mentally and spiritually if
[59:50] you don't know what's next if you don't
[59:51] know what to do next it's hard Saints
[59:54] and it can make you tired and we need to
[59:56] know everything right now that's right
[59:59] we live in a fast food Society we they
[1:00:01] can't get the fries out hot enough
[1:00:04] that's right and we want to know
[1:00:06] everything right now and we want the
[1:00:08] answer right now and we want God to
[1:00:10] speak to us right now and we want our
[1:00:12] prayer answered right now and we want to
[1:00:14] know what to do right now but God don't
[1:00:16] always work that way does
[1:00:20] he amen so how do we know what the will
[1:00:23] of the Lord is is well brother Bram said
[1:00:26] that God's will was his word yeah all
[1:00:29] right amen but even if you know God's
[1:00:32] word it's still doesn't mean it's the
[1:00:33] will for your life you might know what
[1:00:36] the word says it's God's will to preach
[1:00:38] the gospel is that right but it may not
[1:00:41] be God's will for you to preach the
[1:00:43] gospel amen it's God's will to be a
[1:00:46] missionary but it may not be God's will
[1:00:48] for you to be a missionary it's God's
[1:00:51] will to operate the offices and the
[1:00:52] gifts but it may not be God's will for
[1:00:55] you so we have to seek God's will for
[1:00:58] our
[1:01:01] life
[1:01:02] okay so even though we know the word of
[1:01:05] the lord we still got to seek his will
[1:01:07] for us
[1:01:09] individually and now brother brand they
[1:01:11] asked him this they said how do you feel
[1:01:13] is the best way to find the will of the
[1:01:16] Lord on some important matters now they
[1:01:18] asked the prophet at how what how do you
[1:01:20] feel is the best way for me and you to
[1:01:22] know God's will now that's a good
[1:01:24] question isn't it y'all want to hear
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] answer he said I tell you dear friend
[1:01:30] the best way to find the will of God in
[1:01:32] some important matters is prayer yeah
[1:01:35] all right it's good now people don't
[1:01:38] like that
[1:01:40] answer because that's
[1:01:43] hard praying over something is
[1:01:46] hard seeking God's will is hard staying
[1:01:50] quiet before the Lord and praying is
[1:01:53] hard Saints
[1:01:54] it's difficult for us to do sometimes
[1:01:57] and we want everything easy the flesh is
[1:02:00] soft and we want everything handed to us
[1:02:03] and we want the preacher to tell us what
[1:02:05] to do or we want the pastor to tell us
[1:02:07] what to do or we want our brother to
[1:02:09] tell us what to do or we want
[1:02:11] us but we but but it's got to be God
[1:02:14] telling us what to do
[1:02:18] amen you see people want to serve the
[1:02:21] Lord and they want to do great things
[1:02:22] many times until they realize the
[1:02:24] sacrifice that goes along with it that's
[1:02:27] right yes everybody wants to have more
[1:02:29] church functions until somebody's got to
[1:02:31] put one of them
[1:02:34] on
[1:02:36] that's we used to have church functions
[1:02:38] people show up and eat and leave and
[1:02:40] they say we ought to do this every
[1:02:42] week I bet you do think we ought to do
[1:02:45] it every
[1:02:46] week I don't want to do it no more I'm
[1:02:50] tired right see the flesh wants a quick
[1:02:53] answer the flesh but it takes long
[1:02:55] nights and it takes early mornings and
[1:02:57] it takes constant mental and emotional
[1:02:59] battles to find the will of the Lord
[1:03:02] right and he and we find it that doing
[1:03:04] something for the Lord is it takes men
[1:03:07] and real men and real women and people
[1:03:10] that's got some character to do
[1:03:12] something for the Lord because it gets
[1:03:15] hard it's not for this bunch of soft
[1:03:17] jellyfish that we got today it's for
[1:03:20] real men and women yes that's right now
[1:03:23] brother Brown said this he said said
[1:03:24] here's the way I do it I take it before
[1:03:26] the Lord and it's always been my
[1:03:29] strength he said I wait upon the Lord
[1:03:32] and see what he says and I just let
[1:03:35] myself remain neutral to it so we got to
[1:03:40] go to the Lord take it to the Lord and
[1:03:42] we have to allow oursel to remain
[1:03:45] neutral right yeah good now that's the
[1:03:49] hard part Saints amen if you ever tried
[1:03:52] brother Jeremy to pray for a new truck
[1:03:54] or
[1:03:57] something it's hard to remain neutral
[1:04:00] cuz you really want that truck or you
[1:04:02] really want that house or you really
[1:04:04] want that job is that right that's right
[1:04:07] and so when you pray it's hard to remain
[1:04:10] neutral but to remain neutral means
[1:04:12] you're happy no matter what the answer
[1:04:16] is and if the answer is no you're happy
[1:04:19] anyways because that's the that's the
[1:04:21] will of the Lord amen
[1:04:24] so he says I let myself remain neutral
[1:04:26] to it he said' I don't take either side
[1:04:28] and I say now heavenly father now now he
[1:04:31] he goes on he says this and so I would
[1:04:34] if I was in your place and didn't have
[1:04:37] visions from the Lord he said I would
[1:04:39] just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now
[1:04:43] you show me what's the direction to make
[1:04:46] right so he says you go to the Lord in
[1:04:48] prayer you remain neutral and you say
[1:04:51] Lord you show me the direction to make
[1:04:55] and he said then the way you feel led to
[1:04:58] do
[1:05:01] it then just wait a little
[1:05:06] bit so the prophet said you go to the
[1:05:09] Lord in prayer you remain neutral and
[1:05:12] you see which way you feel
[1:05:14] led and then you wait a little
[1:05:17] bit see many times if we feel led to do
[1:05:20] something we just go do it come on and
[1:05:22] we say well the Lord led me to do do
[1:05:24] this amen but there's another step to it
[1:05:27] isn't it see you feel well the Lord led
[1:05:29] me to do this yeah that's how we got
[1:05:30] into all some of the messes we got into
[1:05:33] is people saying the Lord let them to do
[1:05:34] something come on now is that right
[1:05:37] Saints and he said he said just wait a
[1:05:40] little bit and then wait a little while
[1:05:43] longer yeah let me read it again he said
[1:05:47] Lord you show me what's the decision to
[1:05:49] make and in the way you feel led to do
[1:05:52] it then just wait a little bit yeah then
[1:05:59] wait a little while
[1:06:01] longer and see which side you lean
[1:06:05] towards all right he says which way the
[1:06:08] spirit he says now you say now father in
[1:06:10] my heart you know it doesn't matter but
[1:06:13] I want to know what you want to do about
[1:06:15] it now that's the approach that we have
[1:06:17] to take to find the will of the Lord in
[1:06:20] our lives and that's hard Saints yeah
[1:06:23] that's difficult for you and I to do but
[1:06:26] that's the way we have to do it is that
[1:06:29] what he said Saints so we ask the Lord
[1:06:32] we remain neutral we pray we see how we
[1:06:35] feel led then we wait and then we wait a
[1:06:37] little longer yes and then we see how we
[1:06:40] feel there
[1:06:43] right it's good how many of you do
[1:06:49] that yeah me
[1:06:53] neither Saints that's what we got to get
[1:06:55] to that's where we got to go see I I'm
[1:06:59] I'm used to making decisions just like
[1:07:00] this I've been in management all my life
[1:07:03] I'm I'm used to deciding move on move on
[1:07:05] here's here's what we're going to do now
[1:07:07] move to the next now move to the next
[1:07:08] now move to the next but that's not the
[1:07:10] way it works with God Saints we have to
[1:07:12] remain neutral we have we have to take
[1:07:14] our feelings and our emotions out of it
[1:07:18] and remain neutral and say Lord I'm
[1:07:19] bringing this to you and whatever you'd
[1:07:21] have me to do whatever your answer is
[1:07:24] I'll be satisfied with it I just want to
[1:07:26] know your will amen and then we wait and
[1:07:29] we see how we feel there and we wait and
[1:07:32] we see how we feel led and then we
[1:07:34] go all right now if we can learn to wait
[1:07:38] on the Lord Watch What Happens he said
[1:07:40] Isaiah said and I I love this in Isaiah
[1:07:43] 4028 he said hast thou not known hast
[1:07:46] thou not heard that the Everlasting God
[1:07:48] the Lord the creator of the ends of the
[1:07:50] Earth Feth not neither is weary so God
[1:07:53] don't get tired Saints it's us that gets
[1:07:55] tired and God don't run out of power
[1:07:58] it's us that runs out of virtue yeah
[1:08:01] amen he said there's no searching of his
[1:08:04] understanding he said he giveth power to
[1:08:06] the faint and to them who have no might
[1:08:09] he increases strength see he doesn't
[1:08:12] give strength to the strong but he gives
[1:08:14] strength to the
[1:08:15] weak yeah thank the Lord for that he
[1:08:19] says even the youth shall faint and be
[1:08:21] weary and the young men shall utter fall
[1:08:24] see Saints young people we don't think
[1:08:26] they get tired but young people get
[1:08:28] tired too we don't think that anything
[1:08:30] wears on the young people but it wears
[1:08:32] on the young people too the stress that
[1:08:34] we Face they face also the trials that
[1:08:37] they that they got that's the trials we
[1:08:39] got it's the same devil that's against
[1:08:41] them as against you and I and the young
[1:08:43] people get tired
[1:08:45] also right and we need to consider the
[1:08:48] pressure that the young people are under
[1:08:50] just like the pressure that we're under
[1:08:52] we need to consider the fact that they
[1:08:54] make mistakes just like we make mistakes
[1:08:56] and we need to consider the fact that
[1:08:58] they need strength just like we need
[1:08:59] strength and they need to be here just
[1:09:01] like we need to be here and they need
[1:09:03] the Holy Ghost just like we do and they
[1:09:05] need to oh God they need it
[1:09:08] Saints amen I can't imagine trying to
[1:09:11] grow up in this world today all right
[1:09:14] it's multiple times more evil than it
[1:09:16] was when I was a kid all
[1:09:18] right you know when I was a kid we'd
[1:09:20] bust each other up a little bit and
[1:09:22] maybe we get a bloody nose and maybe
[1:09:24] break a bone or two something like that
[1:09:25] but today they'll pull out a gun and
[1:09:27] shoot
[1:09:30] you when I was a kid we got into all
[1:09:33] kinds of trouble but I always knew that
[1:09:35] I was a
[1:09:38] boy I didn't have to
[1:09:40] decide I never thought I was a dog or a
[1:09:44] cat I never asked nobody to call me a
[1:09:46] they or a
[1:09:47] them that's the world these young people
[1:09:49] growing up in it's total insanity Saints
[1:09:53] and that's the problems that they deal
[1:09:55] with and that's the problems that they
[1:09:56] fight there wasn't no internet when I
[1:09:58] was a kid there wasn't no social media
[1:10:00] when I was a kid I wasn't getting
[1:10:02] pressure to be like a certain thing from
[1:10:04] all the way across the country or
[1:10:08] world but these young people do and they
[1:10:10] get tired
[1:10:12] also but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:10:15] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:10:18] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:10:20] run and not be weary they'll walk and
[1:10:22] not faint the Bible said
[1:10:24] see if we can wait on the
[1:10:26] Lord we can get stronger while we're
[1:10:30] waiting if we pray and we'll remain
[1:10:33] neutral and we'll seek God's will we'll
[1:10:36] get stronger in the
[1:10:39] waiting now you say well brother George
[1:10:41] that sounds so hard to get a clear-cut
[1:10:43] answer well you know sometimes it is
[1:10:45] hard sometimes it is a challenged but
[1:10:48] I'd rather be challenged and know the
[1:10:50] will of God than to go haphazardly and
[1:10:52] be out of his will
[1:10:55] amen now you say well how do I know if
[1:10:57] I'm getting it right or not how do I
[1:10:59] know if I'm making the right decision or
[1:11:00] not whether the prophet said you just do
[1:11:03] the best you can and all you can do is
[1:11:07] the best you can do Saints all you can
[1:11:09] do is try as best you
[1:11:11] can that's all you can do and God knows
[1:11:15] that's all you can do and he doesn't
[1:11:17] require something of us that we're not
[1:11:18] able to fulfill yeah right amen let me
[1:11:23] read this to you he said that's the way
[1:11:25] I do about meetings sometimes he said I
[1:11:27] feel kind of led to go this way or that
[1:11:30] way he said then I follow that way
[1:11:32] that's the way to do it because it's in
[1:11:34] prayer then you're doing the best you
[1:11:38] can Saints all we can do is the best we
[1:11:41] can all we can do is try to seek God's
[1:11:44] will all we can do is try to remain
[1:11:47] neutral all we can do is try to feel how
[1:11:49] we feel L that's the best we can do amen
[1:11:54] is that right Saints what else can we do
[1:11:57] now you say well brother George I'm
[1:11:58] scared to do anything then because I
[1:12:00] might make the wrong decision well
[1:12:02] that's just exactly what the devil wants
[1:12:03] you to do see if the devil can get you
[1:12:05] to do nothing he's real happy about that
[1:12:08] all right yeah you ever been scared to
[1:12:11] make a decision cuz you scared you're
[1:12:12] going to be wrong yes that's what the
[1:12:15] devil wants you to do never to make a
[1:12:17] decision never to do anything just let
[1:12:19] it continue to ride on
[1:12:21] out amen he loves it when we do
[1:12:25] nothing but here's a promise we got I'm
[1:12:27] going to read this to you I think it'll
[1:12:28] help you brother Brown sting questions
[1:12:31] and answers he said I believe this my
[1:12:33] friends as Paul was in the New Testament
[1:12:36] in the days gone by he was between two
[1:12:39] states which way he should go yeah now
[1:12:43] this is
[1:12:45] Paul and he said he started on the wrong
[1:12:48] road
[1:12:49] yeah and he got a Macedonian call
[1:12:54] and he says and I believe if you're
[1:12:56] making a decision for God and do it the
[1:13:00] best you
[1:13:01] can I believe God will correct you and
[1:13:04] see that you don't go
[1:13:07] wrong Oh Glory to God Saints we do the
[1:13:11] best we can and we have confidence that
[1:13:14] if we do the best we can do that if we
[1:13:17] happen to do the wrong thing God will
[1:13:19] correct
[1:13:22] it right
[1:13:23] now the Bible said all things work
[1:13:26] together for the good of those that love
[1:13:28] God and are called according to his
[1:13:30] purpose how can we lose with a promise
[1:13:32] like that Saints so so the anointing
[1:13:35] leaves us it makes us tired not being
[1:13:37] sure the next step makes us tired and
[1:13:39] then there's a mental tiredness that we
[1:13:41] battle and brother BR said this that our
[1:13:44] minds we understand Saints are going a
[1:13:46] thousand miles an hour and if you just
[1:13:49] think about everything that's went
[1:13:50] through your mind since you've been in
[1:13:52] this church service
[1:13:54] yeah that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:13:56] this church service that's right we're
[1:13:58] worried about the beans or we're worried
[1:14:00] about what's in the crock pot or we're
[1:14:01] worried about what we got to do at work
[1:14:03] tomorrow we're worried about what
[1:14:04] somebody's going to think or we're
[1:14:06] worried about all these different things
[1:14:07] it's all the devil trying to force these
[1:14:10] things to interrupt the
[1:14:12] service right and it doesn't seem to be
[1:14:14] enough time in the day to get everything
[1:14:17] uh done and I'll tell you that being
[1:14:19] caught between two opinions makes you
[1:14:22] tired
[1:14:25] yes it's the spirit of the age and we
[1:14:29] find brother Brown said it's a sin from
[1:14:31] Satan uh will make anything have a
[1:14:33] nervous prostration so it's the sin
[1:14:36] that's in the world that makes us
[1:14:38] nervous it makes a nervous prostration
[1:14:41] on us now if you want to look at that
[1:14:43] you'll find that there are things that
[1:14:45] are allowed today in the message that
[1:14:47] didn't used to be allowed but because
[1:14:50] sin has abounded because everything
[1:14:53] everything's gotten so wicked by
[1:14:55] comparison it doesn't look as bad
[1:14:57] anymore but if it was wrong when the
[1:15:00] prophet preached it it's wrong
[1:15:02] today so so it's just like my daughter
[1:15:05] Emma she's not here so I can talk about
[1:15:07] her my middle daughter Emma I used to go
[1:15:10] in and I'd get on to her about her
[1:15:11] bedroom I she was a teenager and I'd say
[1:15:14] hey your room is a mess and you need to
[1:15:17] get that room cleaned up and you need to
[1:15:20] you need to do a better job of keeping
[1:15:21] it cleaned up and she looked at me and
[1:15:23] say well at least I'm not on
[1:15:29] drugs you understand it's all relative
[1:15:32] right by comparison a dirty room or
[1:15:35] drugs
[1:15:36] right but Saints it doesn't matter what
[1:15:39] she's own drugs or not the room was
[1:15:40] still
[1:15:41] dirty is that right and whether the
[1:15:44] world's gotten Wicked whether the world
[1:15:46] has lost its mind it has no bearing on
[1:15:49] the fact that you and I have to maintain
[1:15:51] the standard of this message
[1:15:56] amen and it's a sin he said that causes
[1:15:59] a nervous prostration and that's the
[1:16:01] reason we got so many nervous breakdowns
[1:16:03] and the insane institutions filling up
[1:16:05] he said we got people running through a
[1:16:07] 30 mph Zone 90 M an hour squeezing all
[1:16:11] the tar and rubber off the tires turning
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:14] corners he said they're in a nervous
[1:16:16] neurotic State they don't know what to
[1:16:18] do and all the world is nervous upset
[1:16:20] they don't know where they're standing
[1:16:22] and they're joining one church and then
[1:16:23] they're joining another church and every
[1:16:25] little thing they're running here
[1:16:27] they're running there to and fro it's
[1:16:28] because Satan has begun to push out his
[1:16:31] poison breath he's begun to blow his
[1:16:33] Winds of strife breaking churches apart
[1:16:36] separating Brotherhood as he done it
[1:16:37] today Saints breaking churches apart and
[1:16:40] separating Brotherhood and making people
[1:16:42] think that they're a little better than
[1:16:44] somebody else that they belong to a
[1:16:46] better bracket that they belong to a
[1:16:47] better Church there's only one church
[1:16:49] and that's the Church of Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ see it's exhausting to be caught
[1:16:54] between two opinions it's exhaust it'll
[1:16:57] wear a person out when they're not sure
[1:16:59] what to believe yes sir amen there was a
[1:17:03] time that I was burned out from being
[1:17:05] caught between two different schools of
[1:17:09] thoughts right see I was raised up one
[1:17:11] kind of way in the message listening to
[1:17:13] tapes and I would preach but then all of
[1:17:15] a sudden they said well we don't need to
[1:17:17] preach no more we just need to listen to
[1:17:19] tapes but I said the tapes that I'm
[1:17:21] hearing tell me I need to preach
[1:17:25] and I was caught between two opinions
[1:17:27] and it's exhausting to be caught between
[1:17:29] two opinions it's exhausting to be
[1:17:32] caught between two doctrines but finally
[1:17:34] one day it dawned on me that I don't
[1:17:36] have to have nobody's permission to
[1:17:38] believe God's
[1:17:40] word I don't have to check with nobody
[1:17:43] to make sure it's all right I can read
[1:17:45] it for myself and say Amen to
[1:17:49] it and if you're caught in such a trap
[1:17:52] and you're caught between two opinions
[1:17:54] it'll wear you out but if you just take
[1:17:56] the blinders off and believe what he
[1:17:58] said you got freedom in that
[1:18:04] Saint I don't have to call no other
[1:18:06] Pastor I don't have to call no other
[1:18:08] evangelist to see if it's all right to
[1:18:10] believe what God said about it I don't
[1:18:13] have to see if it's sanctioned by
[1:18:14] another church or not I can just believe
[1:18:16] it the way he said
[1:18:19] it oh
[1:18:21] my yes I don't have to call headquarters
[1:18:24] to make sure it's all right for me to
[1:18:25] listen to it on I can just believe it
[1:18:28] the way it said it amen I can I can
[1:18:31] reach out and grab a tape and put it in
[1:18:33] and know that tape's going to be the
[1:18:35] word of
[1:18:37] God oh God get in trouble this
[1:18:42] morning it's exhausting to be caught
[1:18:44] between two
[1:18:45] opinions so the Lord revealed to me that
[1:18:48] I don't have to have nobody's approval
[1:18:50] to believe his word amen that's right
[1:18:54] you don't either that's right see the
[1:18:57] Bible said this is a or the message says
[1:18:59] it's an individual
[1:19:02] Affair that we receive these Revelations
[1:19:04] as an
[1:19:05] individual amen I'm so grateful for this
[1:19:10] church Saints I'm so grateful I I think
[1:19:12] your pastor does a better job than
[1:19:15] almost anybody I've ever seen of keeping
[1:19:16] it between the middle of the
[1:19:18] road not getting off too far to one side
[1:19:21] of the other I appre appreciate that
[1:19:23] Saints see there's freedom in the middle
[1:19:25] of the
[1:19:28] road he said it was in the middle of the
[1:19:31] road that the sound s gospel was
[1:19:33] preached he said it was in the middle of
[1:19:36] the road that the power of God
[1:19:38] was
[1:19:40] amen so when you find all these things
[1:19:42] going on in the church you find all
[1:19:46] these ideas coming across your mind
[1:19:48] while you're in the church think about
[1:19:49] what happens Saints if the service runs
[1:19:51] a little bit long
[1:19:54] you can feel that pressure start to come
[1:19:57] in see the only part of church order
[1:20:00] anybody's ever heard is 45
[1:20:03] minutes and once it goes over that it
[1:20:06] starts a pressure builds up you can feel
[1:20:08] it and if you watch it Saints have you
[1:20:11] ever just carried around after everybody
[1:20:13] that's got a go can go and you just sit
[1:20:16] around in the church and you hear the
[1:20:18] music's playing and the people are
[1:20:19] worshiping and everybody that's got to
[1:20:21] go check the beans has gone and check
[1:20:23] the beans and everybody that's got to go
[1:20:25] to somewhere else has gone and gone
[1:20:27] somewhere else and it's just the folks
[1:20:28] that just want to be here that's right
[1:20:30] that's good and the and the music's
[1:20:32] playing and the people relax they
[1:20:36] exhale and then you'll find the spirit
[1:20:39] of God come into the church sometimes
[1:20:40] the best Services you ever have is after
[1:20:43] service because it's a pressure that
[1:20:45] builds up on the people is that
[1:20:48] right now battles and trials
[1:20:53] will make you
[1:20:55] tired when the anointing leaves you it
[1:20:58] makes you tired if you're caught between
[1:21:00] two opinions it'll make you
[1:21:02] tired if you're not sure what's next
[1:21:05] it'll make you tired and then sometimes
[1:21:07] we're tired from hard battles and hard
[1:21:10] trials yeah true and brother Brown said
[1:21:13] that one of the things that had hurt him
[1:21:15] all through his life was a nervous
[1:21:17] condition and he said he got worn down
[1:21:20] and he got tired and when he did he got
[1:21:22] real weary and he got to feeling like
[1:21:24] nobody cared about him and he said it
[1:21:27] happens to every one of us is that right
[1:21:30] Saints and he said when you get to
[1:21:32] feeling that way none of it is true
[1:21:37] right see there's never a time when
[1:21:41] don't nobody care about you that's right
[1:21:43] if the devil tries to tell you that just
[1:21:45] show him all the folks in this church
[1:21:47] this morning amen is that right Saints
[1:21:51] and God knows her struggles and he came
[1:21:53] in the form of a man and he knows what
[1:21:55] it's like to be tired and he was tired
[1:21:57] and he went to sleep on that boat that
[1:21:59] time remember but oh when he stood up
[1:22:02] Saints when he woke
[1:22:04] up the winds and the way obeyed him he
[1:22:07] he's a God that can be touched by the
[1:22:09] feeling of our infirmities and he said I
[1:22:12] will give you
[1:22:14] rest now Saints to you and I that's the
[1:22:17] Holy Ghost today and he said fear
[1:22:20] Hebrews 4:1 says let us therefore fear
[1:22:23] lest the promise being left of us of
[1:22:25] entering into his rest that any should
[1:22:26] come short of it and he said there
[1:22:29] remaineth therefore the rest a rest to
[1:22:31] the people of God for if he that has
[1:22:33] entered into this rest rest he has also
[1:22:36] ceased from his own works as God did for
[1:22:39] his now brother brandham talks about
[1:22:41] this scripture and he says if you've
[1:22:43] never received the Holy Ghost you've
[1:22:45] never entered into God's rest that's
[1:22:48] right right amen amen and he says you
[1:22:52] don't have to say oh I couldn't I I want
[1:22:54] to smoke I just couldn't do it I'm a
[1:22:56] Christian he says I really don't want to
[1:22:58] drink but I'm a Christian I just can't I
[1:23:00] I I don't want to drink but yet I like
[1:23:01] to he said if you lust after women if
[1:23:03] you do ungodly things you've never hit
[1:23:06] that rest period
[1:23:07] yet and he said you've never entered
[1:23:09] into that rest and when you enter into
[1:23:11] this rest you cease from your own
[1:23:14] worldly works like God did from his
[1:23:17] you're a part of God you rest eternally
[1:23:20] he said so the Holy Ghost is the rest to
[1:23:23] The Believer by taking all of this stuff
[1:23:27] that we're carrying and taking it off of
[1:23:30] our plates and putting it over on the
[1:23:32] shoulders of
[1:23:34] Jesus see instead of us carrying all of
[1:23:37] our burdens instead of us carrying all
[1:23:40] of our trials instead of us dealing with
[1:23:42] all of our Temptations we can we can
[1:23:44] take them off and hand them to
[1:23:48] Jesus is that right Saints so worldly
[1:23:51] desire can be laid upon him and
[1:23:53] complexes can be laid upon him and
[1:23:56] insecurity can be laid upon him and
[1:23:58] heartache can be laid upon him and
[1:24:01] stress can be laid on him and trials can
[1:24:03] be laid on him and anxiety can be laid
[1:24:06] on him and depression can be laid on and
[1:24:08] your family oh your children you can lay
[1:24:11] them on
[1:24:14] Jesus yes and when we lay them on him we
[1:24:18] don't have to carry them and we can rest
[1:24:20] this morning Saints
[1:24:23] but it's not a get out of jail free card
[1:24:25] we got to do it we got to let go we got
[1:24:29] to give up we got to give it to him we
[1:24:32] got to take these trials and say I can't
[1:24:34] do nothing with them no more but I'm
[1:24:36] going to give them to Jesus and I'm
[1:24:37] going to let him handle them I can't I
[1:24:40] can't do nothing about my health I can't
[1:24:42] make myself feel no better but I'm going
[1:24:43] to give it to Jesus and he can handle it
[1:24:47] yes I can't do nothing about what the
[1:24:49] doctor said I can't do
[1:24:51] nothing about my job I can't do nothing
[1:24:55] about work I can't do nothing about my
[1:24:57] home I can't do nothing about my
[1:24:58] marriage but I can give it to him amen
[1:25:02] and I can let him handle it see Elijah
[1:25:05] was fighting the greatest battle ever
[1:25:07] fought he was tired he was under the
[1:25:10] juniper tree he was dealing with some
[1:25:12] stuff in his head now this was a great
[1:25:15] man he just come up under the great
[1:25:18] anointing he called fire down from
[1:25:20] heaven a few days before
[1:25:23] he he just put to death 400 prophets of
[1:25:25] Baal and 450 prophets of the Groves he
[1:25:27] wanted tremendous victory for Israel and
[1:25:29] in a few days later he's he's he's
[1:25:32] laying under a juniper tree asking God
[1:25:34] to take his life right brother BR said
[1:25:37] he was running from the threat of a
[1:25:39] woman is that right because the anointed
[1:25:42] had left him and it was
[1:25:44] Monday and his mind was going crazy on
[1:25:47] It come on
[1:25:48] somebody and I want you to notice what
[1:25:50] Elijah was dealing with he was dealing
[1:25:52] deal with number one
[1:25:53] self-doubt he said I am no better than
[1:25:56] my father's are you kidding me a man
[1:25:59] like Elijah saying I'm no better than my
[1:26:02] fathers none of Elijah's fathers did
[1:26:04] anything near close to what Elijah did
[1:26:07] this was a man of God this was a man
[1:26:10] that God
[1:26:11] used is that right he was a great man
[1:26:15] and he here he is sitting under a
[1:26:16] juniper tree saying I'm no better than
[1:26:18] my fathers he said oh my
[1:26:21] goodness see that's that same old devil
[1:26:24] that's trying to tell you how you're
[1:26:25] going to turn out that's the same old
[1:26:28] devil you take the baddest worst person
[1:26:31] in your family and anytime something
[1:26:33] goes wrong the devil's going to tell you
[1:26:34] you're going to turn out just like
[1:26:38] them that's the same old devil Saints
[1:26:42] now well I want you to notice this the
[1:26:44] prophet said he said if you got an
[1:26:46] inbred weakness from some sickness that
[1:26:48] you inherited from your peoples back
[1:26:50] there in the generations he said each
[1:26:52] one of us is growing weaker and wiser he
[1:26:54] said the blood of Jesus Christ sir right
[1:26:58] atoned for that at
[1:27:00] Calvary it don't matter what your
[1:27:02] background is and it don't matter what
[1:27:03] your family did and it don't matter how
[1:27:05] people acted before you and it don't
[1:27:07] matter that your aunts got some kind of
[1:27:09] mental illness and none of that matters
[1:27:11] because Jesus Christ atoned for that at
[1:27:14] Calvary
[1:27:16] Saints all
[1:27:18] right that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ did he said you you don't have to
[1:27:22] be judged you don't have to think
[1:27:24] yourself worthy you'll never be
[1:27:26] worthy I ain't trying to get good enough
[1:27:29] Saints yeah he said but Christ was
[1:27:32] worthy in your stead right oh God he
[1:27:35] said that price he paid it he said now
[1:27:38] try not trying to redeem something you
[1:27:41] can't redeem it cuz you ain't got the
[1:27:43] money to do
[1:27:44] it he said but God had the money and he
[1:27:47] sent Christ and settled the bill and
[1:27:50] redeemed you from your sickness and your
[1:27:52] sorrow and your worry and your sin and
[1:27:54] your backsliding he sent the money which
[1:27:57] was Christ Jesus and deposited it on
[1:27:59] Calvary on gatha's hill and tonight
[1:28:02] every one of you is free and you just
[1:28:05] believe it he
[1:28:07] said oh God yes sir that's a promise
[1:28:11] Saints it's not how good I am it's how
[1:28:14] good he was he paid the
[1:28:17] price that I couldn't pay I couldn't
[1:28:21] save myself so he had to save
[1:28:24] me the other thing he was dealing with
[1:28:27] was his selfworth he said Elijah said
[1:28:29] it'd be better off if I wasn't even here
[1:28:31] it'd be better off if I was never born
[1:28:34] it'd be better the world would be better
[1:28:35] without me come on somebody see if the
[1:28:37] devil can get you to think that and he
[1:28:39] can get you to think you're not worthy
[1:28:41] he's got you right
[1:28:43] there see that's why we got more young
[1:28:46] people that's damaging their bodies and
[1:28:49] they're cutting their s and they're
[1:28:51] they're putting all these piercings and
[1:28:52] stuff in and they're and they're
[1:28:54] desecrating their bodies because they've
[1:28:56] lost their
[1:28:59] selfworth that's that's why they get
[1:29:01] trapped people get trapped in abusive
[1:29:03] relationships because because they don't
[1:29:05] think they deserve any
[1:29:08] better that's why we got so much suicide
[1:29:11] that somebody would so lose their
[1:29:13] selfworth till they would try to take
[1:29:15] their own life that's why we got so much
[1:29:17] sexual deviance because people don't
[1:29:20] value themselves enough to keep
[1:29:22] themselves
[1:29:24] pure is that right Saints and if you
[1:29:27] believe though saints that you're worth
[1:29:29] something and you believe that you're
[1:29:31] worth a great deal and you believe that
[1:29:33] there's value in you that there's worth
[1:29:35] in you that God has a purpose for you
[1:29:37] that God has a plan for you that there's
[1:29:40] Redemption for you that your price has
[1:29:42] been paid that your debt has been
[1:29:43] settled that God has a reason for you
[1:29:46] being here all right yes sir then you
[1:29:49] tell that devil to go jump in the river
[1:29:52] because you're here to serve the
[1:29:54] Lord it's our selfworth Saints God don't
[1:29:57] make no mistakes right he didn't call
[1:29:59] you to this for no reason come on he
[1:30:02] didn't pull you out of the darkness to
[1:30:03] bring you here for no reason he didn't
[1:30:06] pick you up out of the mud and clean you
[1:30:07] up and give you the Holy Ghost for no
[1:30:09] reason oh he's got a plan for us
[1:30:14] Saints that's good but it's just because
[1:30:18] we don't look at it through God's eyes
[1:30:19] we're looking at it through our eyes and
[1:30:21] when you look at me through your eyes
[1:30:22] you see all kind of faults but we got to
[1:30:25] look at it through God's eyes amen no
[1:30:28] matter what you done brother BR said
[1:30:30] when God sees you've confessed your sins
[1:30:32] and God looks through the blood of the
[1:30:34] Lord Jesus he sees you Snow White all
[1:30:37] right yes that's what the prophet
[1:30:39] said he says no matter what you done
[1:30:42] he's looking through you through
[1:30:44] Christ's blood you're redeemed he
[1:30:47] said he said you can't do it yourself no
[1:30:50] matter how much you want to you can't do
[1:30:52] it it's a gift of God right and no man
[1:30:55] can come to me except my father draws
[1:30:57] him and all that comes to me I'll give
[1:30:58] him everlasting life and raise him up in
[1:31:00] the last day now I love this he says and
[1:31:02] when God has borne you a new by the Holy
[1:31:05] Spirit he can only look upon you that's
[1:31:07] a perfect work because he did it
[1:31:10] himself yes oh my that's good you're
[1:31:14] God's workmanship it's by Sovereign
[1:31:16] Grace is that right I feel pretty poorly
[1:31:20] about myself sometimes
[1:31:22] but I'm not responsible for how I feel
[1:31:25] I'm responsible for what he
[1:31:28] said and he said that I'm covered under
[1:31:31] the blood he said that I'm redeemed he
[1:31:34] said that I'm a new creature he said
[1:31:37] that I'm a Child of God now think about
[1:31:40] this Saints if if a cow out here has a
[1:31:43] calf what species is that
[1:31:48] calf come on somebody this ain't
[1:31:50] hard it's a
[1:31:54] cow all right y'all little
[1:31:58] slow all right so if a horse has a cult
[1:32:02] what species is that
[1:32:04] cult it's a
[1:32:06] horse so if God has a son or
[1:32:11] daughter what species is that son or
[1:32:15] daughter how will that son or daughter
[1:32:18] act what will proceed out of their mouth
[1:32:21] what will they say what will they do
[1:32:23] they're here to represent
[1:32:26] God
[1:32:30] Amen oh my we all get to these places
[1:32:32] where we had to have some help and
[1:32:35] Elijah was to get to the point to
[1:32:37] where he had to have somebody take care
[1:32:40] of
[1:32:41] him he had to let go and let God take
[1:32:46] care of him yeah and we got to get in
[1:32:49] that same position of Letting Go to
[1:32:52] today we got to get in the same position
[1:32:54] of letting God handle it all right
[1:32:57] brother Brown said it's the same with us
[1:32:59] he said it isn't what we fight and Pull
[1:33:01] and hurry that's not it it's to know
[1:33:04] that the law of life is in
[1:33:07] you and you just let go and let
[1:33:11] God he said then he takes you to your
[1:33:14] healing he takes you to the baptism of
[1:33:16] the spirit and anything that he's
[1:33:18] promised any claim that he's given is
[1:33:21] yours
[1:33:22] by letting go and letting God yes see we
[1:33:26] got to stop trying to do everything
[1:33:28] oursel as a musicians come this morning
[1:33:31] now when you enter into this rest you
[1:33:34] have to cease from your own worldly
[1:33:36] works is that
[1:33:38] right and he said we're insufficient
[1:33:40] ourselves he said then we're subjects to
[1:33:43] yield to God's spirit when we can't do
[1:33:46] it ourself we're subjects to yield to
[1:33:50] God's spirit and he says as as long as
[1:33:52] we think we can do it we can't do it he
[1:33:55] said but when you get to the place to
[1:33:57] where we know we can't do it then we
[1:33:59] yield oursel to God and he does
[1:34:02] it so then he said it's not us trying to
[1:34:06] do it he said if we try to do it we'll
[1:34:08] fail but we yield oursel to God and God
[1:34:11] can he said because there's only one
[1:34:14] thing that God can't do and that's fail
[1:34:17] and he said we have to master the the uh
[1:34:20] the thought
[1:34:22] of human ability we got to get a hold of
[1:34:25] the fact that we don't have the ability
[1:34:28] is that right Saints and if we ever get
[1:34:31] to a spot where we think we can do it
[1:34:32] ourselves with our own intelligent he
[1:34:34] said he said we got to master that in
[1:34:37] such a way and get rid of that thing and
[1:34:39] lay it aside so that God can use us he
[1:34:43] says it's hard because we're always
[1:34:45] wanting to put our part in
[1:34:48] it but as long as you're doing it that
[1:34:50] way it's going to be wrong WR and God
[1:34:52] will never use that effort amen so I
[1:34:55] want to leave you this morning with
[1:34:56] three
[1:35:00] points well Jo just go ahead and sing
[1:35:02] something three points
[1:35:06] here there's many things in our life
[1:35:09] that make us
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:13] tired the second point is Jesus has
[1:35:16] given us a rest to enter
[1:35:19] into and then lastly
[1:35:22] we have something to do today we have to
[1:35:25] enter into that rest he said come to me
[1:35:29] and I'll give you rest so how do we do
[1:35:32] that he said by letting go and letting
[1:35:35] God have it letting go of our
[1:35:39] ideas letting go of our trials letting
[1:35:42] go of our sins lay aside to wait and sin
[1:35:45] that so easily besets us letting go of
[1:35:48] our pride letting go of our stubbornness
[1:35:51] letting go of anything in us that's
[1:35:53] hindering us whatever is hindering our
[1:35:55] walk whatever's taking up his time
[1:35:58] whatever's whatever's causing us grief
[1:36:01] whatever is grieving our spirit we got
[1:36:03] to let go
[1:36:04] today we got to let go and let God have
[1:36:07] his way Saints I think we all know when
[1:36:10] we do something we're not supposed to I
[1:36:12] think we all know when we're spending
[1:36:14] too much time on our phones or we're
[1:36:16] spending too much time on the TV or
[1:36:19] we're spending too much time doing some
[1:36:21] kind of worldly entertainment I think we
[1:36:23] all know that but we got to let it
[1:36:26] go and see when we empty out then we're
[1:36:30] subjects to fill back up when we give
[1:36:34] those things over to God that leaves
[1:36:36] room for him to come
[1:36:38] in and he said you can't put this new
[1:36:41] wine in the old wine skin the wine skins
[1:36:45] got to be changed it's got to be a new
[1:36:47] wine skin that can stretch
[1:36:50] out
[1:36:51] with the good things of
[1:36:54] God he wants to be our savior but he
[1:36:57] also wants to be our Lord
[1:36:59] today he wants to have rulership over
[1:37:03] us amen as long as we're fighting our
[1:37:06] own battles he can't fight them for us
