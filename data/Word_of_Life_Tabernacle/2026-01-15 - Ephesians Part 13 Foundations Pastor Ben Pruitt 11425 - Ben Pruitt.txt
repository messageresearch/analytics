I bless your name seat. And we just praise him just for a few moments before we change the order of the service. Amen. You're worshiping good tonight. Isn't it good to come together in his presence and worship? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." In prisoners chains with bleeding stripes. All in silence they pray that night and in their pain. They began to sing. Their chains were loose and they were free. Let me hear you sing it now. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. I give you praise. For you are the light. You're the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Some midnight hour. If you should find you're in a prison in your mind.

Will I bless your name? I bless your name, Lord. I give you all. Oh, yes we do. I give you praise for you. for the truth the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Give him a hand clap of praise. Amen. Let's sing this one as we invite our pastor tonight. I shall forever lift lives to Calvary. Amen. How many is looking forward to the word of the Lord tonight? Amen. We've worshiped. We've invited his presence in. Amen. Now, as the word goes forth, let him walk right down your to your seat and and and reach your need tonight. Can we do that? Amen. If you come with a need tonight, as the word goes forth, he sent his word to heal you. He sent his word to save you. Aren't you glad for the word tonight? Amen. We can do a lot of things in a service, but when the word is going forth, that's when you're feeding your soul. Amen. So, we're thankful for that tonight. And as our pastor comes, let's just pull on the gift of God tonight and let's sing this with all of our hearts as he comes. Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace that bought my liberty. I do not know just why he came to love. Aren't you glad he did it for you? He looked beyond all my faults and he saw my needs. Let it ring out now. I shall forever my eyes to Calary. Oh to him the cross where Jesus died for me. How long so grace that I fall soul. He looked beyond all my faults and he saw my needs. It was God's grace. It was God's grace that brought me out of darkness into the light where I can clearly see. I'll shout it in front of the mountains and the valley and he looked beyond all my faults and he saw. If he did it for you, let me hear you sing it now. Well, I shall forever lift my eyes to Calary to him for all to me. How marvelous. Oh, the grace of God my falling soul. He looked me all. Aren't you glad he did tonight? My fault said he saw my need. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. There's a special need tonight you'd like to make known by lifting your hand. I know that he sees it tonight and he knows all about it. Heavenly Father, you see these hands that are raised, Lord, and they didn't do that just by habit, but it was some need that they had in their life. And Lord, I ask you to meet that need. Father, ask you to come and just speak directly to them tonight, Lord. We know a word from you is better than even a material blessing, Lord. Cuz when we hear your word, we know that the blessing's on the way, Lord. and the promise is as good to us as having Lord the fulfillment right among us. We thank you for that Lord. I pray that you'd move tonight. I pray you'd move me out of the way. Meet every need. We pray. Pray that you'd heal the sick. Your presence would be with us, Lord, to meet every need. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to Ephesians chapter 2:es 8-10. Good to have each and every one of you with us tonight. Ephesians 2 8-10. Didn't you enjoy the services Sunday? I just feel a very special blessing from the Lord is on its way and it's already here and so thankful to feel a spirit of revival among us. We don't want to ever let that die. We want to stay in revival all of the time. Brother Brandham said, "Whatever you do, keep yourself in the life of Christ." That's what we want to do. Amen. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8, Paul says, and we'll read down through verse 10 and then read the rest uh uh after you're seated. Verse eight, for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship. So it's like he is the architect and we are the building created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. I don't know about having a preacher on the back row back there. Okay, we got two preachers on the back row. My goodness. Glad you're all here tonight. Thank you for being here. In Ephesians chapter 2, starting in verse 8, Paul deals with uh grace and says you are saved through faith by grace and that it is a gift of God that we can't work towards that. There's nothing we could do to earn it. He said, "And we have nothing to boast in." And then he goes on to say that we are his workmanship. So he doesn't leave it in a sense of, "Well, there's nothing I can do, so I'll just let him do everything." But he says we were ordained to good works. So we are not to just stay in our uh secure in our election, but our election is also a an election to good works. It's a predestination to adoption as we've talked about. So, we are what he Christ has built. Now, I want to go somewhere tonight. I know some of you sitting there say, "Well, he's on Ephesians again." And but there's some place I want to go tonight that I believe the Lord put on my heart for us as a church. So, we are what he has built. Now, go to verse 11. And it says, "Wherefore remember that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision, in the flesh made by hands, that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, without God in the world." So he's placing us as Gentiles outside the promise. He said, "But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ." So he says, "We were made uh uh partakers of the promise with the with Israel." He said, "And for he is our peace who have made both one and broken down the middle wall of partition between us." So we should not think of the gentile church as being separate from the Jewish church in the sense of whatever prom he promised to the Jews in shadow comes to us in a reality. &gt;&gt; So we are not just a new testament church. We are a new testament church but we are believers in the old and the new testament. All of the old testament promises also apply to the bride. Not in a natural way, but in a spiritual way. So he says he's broke down the middle wall of partition between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to making himself of twain or of two one new man, so making peace. and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby, and came and preached peace to you which were a far off, and to them which are that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one spirit to the father. Now, this is important. Paul's not just taking up space in the book of Ephesians to tell us this. It's important because the Gentiles again are not to think of themselves as separate from the promises, but fellow heirs of the promises. Are you with me so far? He said, "Now therefore, you're no more," one of you are. "Therefore, you're no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God." Notice how he terms it. You're fellow citizens. You're part of the household of God. He said, "And are built, now notice this verse, upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets." So we are not built separately from the Old Testament prophets or the promises of the Old Testament, but we are actually built on top of the Old Testament. So he says, "You are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone &gt;&gt; in whom all the building fitly framed together." So we're part of the building. Israel's part of the building. He said, "Groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit." So he's placing you as part of his building. Part of his building. You say, "Well, he said the foundation was the apostles and prophets." But did you know that you are also a part of the foundation? How many knew that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught that in uh in the church age book and in in the church ages when he taught uh I believe it's from the Philadelphiaian church age, Revelation 3:12, it said, "Him that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God." A pillar. I'm going to make him a pillar. A pillar is part of the foundation. But the bride said he's not only giving crowns, but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God. You ever heard somebody say, "Well, that brother is a pillar in the church or that sister is a pillar in the church." Well, actually, all the saints of God are to be pillars in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Right? So, brother Brandham said Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple. It was it was the temple of God. He said, ' But now that we are his body, the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us. He said, 'Now he's going to make the overcomer. How many overcomers do we have here tonight? Uh we're all going to have to be overcomers to make it out of this world. So if we're an overcomer, we are actually a pillar in the temple of God. He said, what is a pillar? He said, a pillar is actually a part of the foundation. He said, for it holds up the superructure. So, he's not just going to put the apostles and the prophets there, but he's going to put us there with them. Brother Brandham said it puts us right in with the apostles and the prophets. And he references Ephesians 2:19. And through 22, he said, "Yes, that verse 22 says we're builded together with them." He said, "Everything went through the door Jesus and is a part of that body or temple." He said, "Now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that foundation group, that's good. That's better than what we realize it is." He said, "He's making him a part of the foundation group." &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's not just a prophet. It's not just an apostle, but he said, "I want to make the overcomer &gt;&gt; a part of the foundation." Did you realize, brother Peter, you're a part of the foundation? Right? You young people, you're to be a part of the foundation. The overcomer is to be a part of the foundation group. He said what is he doing? He is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had. Matthew 16:17 he said there he is in that word. There he stands. No one I like that. No one can get him out. &gt;&gt; Why? I'M PART OF THE FOUNDATION. SO I'M NOT SEPARATE from what the Old Testament teaches. I'm not separate from what the New Testament teaches. It's not a new religion. It's a Bible-based religion. Brother said, "It's a new case of old religion." &gt;&gt; Right? And so, we're a part of if this is the foundation, I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're to be pillars in the house of God. Listen, WE CAN'T LIVE OUR LIVES SEPARATE from the scriptures. We can't live OUR LIVES SEPARATE FROM THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; because the foundation was planted AND AND GOD'S PROPHET COME TO TAKE US BACK TO THE FOUNDATION. SO WE CAN'T BE something different from that. WE'RE TO BE A PILLAR in that. SO WE SHOULDN'T SHY AWAY FROM THE TEACHINGS OF THE MESSAGE. WE SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY FROM THE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT to understand or maybe difficult to live or maybe we think, well, I I I know what brother Brandon taught, but I don't really want to do it that way. Listen, we want to be a pillar in the temple of God. We want all the blessings of God. We want access to all the things that God has. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not separate from them. &gt;&gt; You're a part of them." &gt;&gt; Do you understand so far? &gt;&gt; Now, so the apostles and prophets of the foundation, Matthew 5:17, Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfill." That's right. &gt;&gt; For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass from the law. He said not even the punctuation &gt;&gt; shall pass from the law till all be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So he was actually not separate from the word. He was the word. &gt;&gt; Right? He didn't just come anyway he wanted to. He come according to the word. &gt;&gt; The word said he would be born in Bethlehem. Right? He's the chief cornerstone of the the scriptures. I I know I'm laboring in this tonight, but I want us to just uh get it really good. I want us to understand that we're part of that foundation. He said uh brother Brandham said therefore knowing these things he said maybe he said maybe you don't know them my brethren but knowing these things he said I'm constrained and duty bound to GOD TO CARRY OUT THE plan of the first foundation because no other man can lay any other foundation than that which already laid. So if anybody wants to come and build a different way than what's already been built, he can't do that, right? I can't do that. No other preacher can do that. A prophet couldn't even do that. He had to build on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. &gt;&gt; So, and I want us to think practically about this tonight. I want us to think about it, examine ourselves and say, Lord, am I built on the foundation? Not only my church, you know, you want to go to a church that's that's based on the foundation of the scriptures, but am I basing my own life on the foundation of the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Do I know the scriptures well enough to know IF I'M BEING TAUGHT according to the foundation? &gt;&gt; Do I know the message well enough to know how what I should be doing and how I should be acting and and what I should be and what our families ought to be and what our church ought to be. I think we ought to I think we ought to pray for revelation every hour of our life more than we pray for anything else. Lord reveal to me my place in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; He said he said he said no other man can lay any other foundation that which is already laid. That's the apostles and the prophets. The prophets foretold it and the apostles carried it out &gt;&gt; and we're supposed to keep on carrying it &gt;&gt; till the buildings completed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is our foundation. &gt;&gt; Paul says, as we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received than than the foundation, let him be accursed. So again, just to kind of go back over it, we don't exist as strangers to the covenants. Aren't you glad you're not a stranger to the covenant when it comes to healing? &gt;&gt; Right? See, so the modern church would teach that you're a stranger to the covenant, that healing ceased with the apostles, miracles ceased with the apostles. But you're not a stranger to what the apostles and the prophets had. &gt;&gt; You're not a stranger to uh to a Holy Ghost move. You're not a stranger to acts to experience. You're not a strange a stranger to being led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You're not a stranger to these things, but you're built on the foundation. You're a pillar in the temple, a fellow citizen in the city of God, in the kingdom of God. We build our life by the foundation of the word and on the foundation of the word. If you try to build off the foundation, your building will fall. &gt;&gt; Right? So, we need to reorder our thoughts and how we think about things, &gt;&gt; right? We think about our jobs through a scriptural lens. &gt;&gt; We think about our church through a scriptural lens. &gt;&gt; We think about our uh we think about our uh our lives, our marriages, our love life, if you will, through a spiritual lens. We think about who we will marry. We think about WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE WILL CONDUCT OUR our homes &gt;&gt; through the lens of the scripture. &gt;&gt; I'm taking it slow for a reason tonight. I just want us to really understand this. See, if you try to build off the foundation, your building's got to fall. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 7, you can go read the whole thing later, but in Matthew chapter 7, uh Paul or Jesus talks about false prophets. He said, "Beware of false prophets." And he said, "Not everyone that says, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You'll know them by their fruits." Brother man said that was their teaching. &gt;&gt; And in Matthew 7:24, he goes on and continues that thought and says this, "Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them," if you've got a if you underline, if you mark in your Bible, underline that. If you're taking notes, write it down. Whoever hears it and does it, not just hears it, but hears it and does it. He said, 'I will liken him to a wise man. How many of you young people, young men, you want to be a wise man? Nobody wants to There's one on the front. You want to be a wise man? If you want to be a wise man, build your life on the word. &gt;&gt; That's the only wisdom that we that we want is the wisdom of the word. So the wise man built his house on a rock and the rains came because they will come, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The floods came because floods will come, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The winds blew because the wind will blow and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded on a foundation &gt;&gt; on a rock. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house on sand. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. &gt;&gt; When you see something fall, &gt;&gt; it wasn't built on the foundation. &gt;&gt; It might look good. Come on. &gt;&gt; It It might have the most impressive doors and windows and roof that you've ever seen. But when the winds come and it falls, it wasn't built on the right foundation. But when you see somebody, though they have loss in their family, though they go through struggle, though they have financial trouble, &gt;&gt; somebody testify with me tonight. Brother Joel was talking to some of you personally SUNDAY NIGHT AND SAYING WHAT GOD HAD DONE AND YET some of the things that you'd been through and yet some of the testimonies that we have that the reason you came through it, the reason you're here tonight, the reason that you made it IS BECAUSE YOU BUILT YOUR LIFE ON THE WORD, YOU DECIDED WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WASN'T GOING TO GO TO CHURCH, I'M GOING TO GO TO CHURCH. WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS NOT GOING TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, I'M GOING TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE DOES, IT PAYS TO BUILD ON the rock. &gt;&gt; Build it now. Don't wait till you're old TO BUILD IT. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, START YOUR FAMILIES ON THE ROCK. START YOUR JOB ON THE ROCK. START YOUR CAREERS ON THE ROCK. IF THE LORD CARRIES AND YOU BECOME A PREACHER OR A SONG LEADER OR or a deacon OR A TRUSTEE, BUILD IT ON THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; And you won't HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FALLING when temptation comes. That's right. &gt;&gt; The rains come and the floods come. &gt;&gt; We don't build our lives or our families or the church on the foundation of our opinions. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We don't build on feelings. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Don't build a marriage on feelings. Don't build a church on feelings. Don't don't conduct your life by how you feel &gt;&gt; because the devil will get into that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we don't build on emotion. We build on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. And then if and then if you build it that way, there'll be some feeling to your worship &gt;&gt; because your life is built on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram says in every age it was the same cry. Hear what the spirit says. &gt;&gt; He that hath an ear, let him hear. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian, YOU WILL GET BACK TO what the spirit is teaching. That is the word of this age. Every messenger to every age will preach that word. Every. Someone say every. Every fresh and true revival. Do you want a revival today? Do you WANT A PERSONAL REVIVAL? DO YOU WANT A WORD REVIVAL? DO YOU WANT A FRESH AND TRUE REVIVAL? EVERY FRESH and true revival. Everyone will be BECAUSE MEN HAVE GOTTEN BACK TO THE WORD FOR THEIR AGE. OH, LET ME GET BACK TO THE WORD. LET ME BUILD ON THE RIGHT FOUNDATION. &gt;&gt; DO IT WHILE YOU'RE STARTING OUT. DON'T WAIT TILL LATER. DON'T DON'T GO OUT AND SEW YOUR WILD O SAY, "WELL, I'll do that." No, THAT THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE HARM TO YOUR FOUNDATION. BUILD RIGHT NOW ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUILD. NOW, you say, "Well, I'm older and I didn't build on the foundation." But you can start BUILDING RIGHT NOW. GO BACK TO THE foundation and make sure that you know where you stand in the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; People make big decisions in life without really knowing what the foundation is &gt;&gt; and that's when they fall. &gt;&gt; Look, brother Brandon said the cry of every age. That's the cry of this age is the rebuke. You have left the word of God. Repent and come back to the word. From the first book in the Bible, Genesis, to the last book, Revelation, there's only one reason for God's displeasure, leaving the word. And there's only one remedy to regain his favor, back to the word. &gt;&gt; See, a true prophet leads the people back to the foundation. What did Elijah do when he went to build the altar, repair the altar of the Lord? He looked FOR WHERE IT ALREADY HAD BEEN. IT WAS TORE DOWN. THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A STONE LEFT ON IT, BUT HE WENT AND FOUND THE FOUNDATION OF THE SAME ALTAR AND BUILT IN THE SAME SPOT &gt;&gt; AND REPAIRED THE altar of the Lord. HE DIDN'T BUILD A NEW ONE. HE REPAIRED THE ALTAR OF THE LORD. HE WAS TURNING THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS to the children. AND TODAY THERE'S A HEART OF THE CHILDREN TURNED BACK TO THE FATHERS BECAUSE ELIJAH WENT AND FOUND THE FOUNDATION by the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; HE WENT AND FOUND THE FOUNDATION. AND IF HE FOUND THE FOUNDATION, LET ME BUILD WHATEVER PART THAT I HAVE TO PLAY. WHATEVER PART I HAVE AS A PASTOR, WHATEVER PART WE HAVE AS A CHURCH, LET US BUILD ON THIS SAME FOUNDATION. WE'RE NOT SEPARATE. THIS ISN'T A CULT. IT'S NOT SOME TYPE OF GROUP WHERE WE CAN JUST DO our own thing, BUT WE ARE BUILDING ON THE FOUNDATION of the word. &gt;&gt; So if the early church had healing, we want healing. &gt;&gt; If the early church had miracles, we want miracles. If the early church went to church, we want to go to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, back to the word. Any doctrine built off the foundation is false. &gt;&gt; In fact, the Catholic Church, Brother Brandon said that beast come out of the bottomless pit because he said the bottomless pit had no foundation to it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It had no basis in the word. So, Brother Brandham said, "We've taught them off of the foundation of the faith that was once delivered to the Pentecostal fathers." Yeah. He said, "The Bible taught a false purgatory, taught a false baptism, everything false, false, false, separating from the original." He said, "You don't believe it? Come back to the Bible. Take your purgatory. Take your father, son, holy ghost, and sprinkling and all that stuff. Come back. See if it's scriptural." &gt;&gt; Huh? Take return ministry. &gt;&gt; Take I'm gonna get in trouble. Take your thunders, &gt;&gt; right? Take it back to the Bible. what you believe about the message, &gt;&gt; your personal opinion, &gt;&gt; about how you should live or what you should do, take it back to the word, &gt;&gt; right? Run it through the Bible. And he said, and come back, see if it's scriptural. That's the way. Find out if it's on the foundation. See, they're off of the foundation, which Paul said, the church of God is founded upon the doctrine of the apostles and prophets. The prophets and apostles has to be the same. Sure. What he said? We went off of that foundation of the word to denominational foundations. off of the foundation of the word onto the foundation of worldly pleasure, worldliness, immoral creeping into the church. I I know this is heavy for a Wednesday night, but just hang with me for a minute. He said off the word onto creeds. He said there ain't but one thing. Come right back where it left off and go again. If you've left the foundation, HE SAID COME BACK TO WHERE IT LEFT OFF. &gt;&gt; Go again. Come back to the word. That's right. Repent means to go turn back ABOUT FACE. YOU'RE GOING the wrong way. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that if you need to repent if you're if you didn't build on the foundation, but if you did build on the foundation, you can stand in faith. You can be secure. You can be happy today. You can be excited to be in the house of God because I know that my life is built on the foundation. I may not have done everything right. I've made many mistakes, BUT TODAY MY LIFE IS BASED NOT ON MY OWN WORKS, but on the workmanship of Jesus Christ in my life. &gt;&gt; All of us have a past. All of us have made mistakes, BUT I'M SO GLAD FOR A FOUNDATION THAT I CAN COME BACK TO. &gt;&gt; WHEN I GET OFF OF IT, IT'S STILL THERE. &gt;&gt; I can come back to the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon taught us that the book of Acts, they said, "It's just a scaffold." He said, "No, it's the foundation." The apostles and prophets. He said, "Don't build your home on anything else." If there's anything I have a heart for in this age, it's homes. because of the the time that we're living in. It's a difficult time. &gt;&gt; Our homes can't be built on opinion, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because my opinion is different from yours. &gt;&gt; Right? And and and maybe my family way of doing things is different from yours. But if two people will come together and build on the foundation, &gt;&gt; they can build a home, &gt;&gt; right? not just have a house. &gt;&gt; I don't believe uh we've taught this. We don't believe in divorce. &gt;&gt; We believe in we believe in uh eternal mates if we could say it like that. We believe in somebody that would that's a part of you. &gt;&gt; The person the one person on in the whole universe that was made for you Gabon. You found it. &gt;&gt; You found that person. &gt;&gt; How did you find that person? Because you you built your life on the foundation. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; If you're not built on a foundation, you won't find the right person. &gt;&gt; And so, but you can build on that. And maybe maybe you weren't saved when you got married and you come together and and you say, "But but start building now." I believe if any two people really will will build on the foundation, they'll learn how to love one another and care for their children and build a home. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm speaking especially to our young people, but I think it applies to all of us. &gt;&gt; You know, I read an article this week about that 40 million people have left the church, quit going to church since co in the US. 40 million people. And I got to reading that and I went down to the comments. I don't know if any of you all do that, but I do. You know, when when you read a an article that you you know, you just skip past the article. I don't even like I don't even read articles that don't have comments. Some of y'all know you do the same thing. And so I I saw this article and I went down to the comments. I read the article and then I went to the comments because that's important. And I went to the comments and I got to looking at them and you know it's so subjective. This one person said, 'You know, I quit going to church because I feel closer to God walking in the woods. I feel closer to God. The one person said, I felt more accepted at a Wiccan church than I did in my church. I feel more accepted. Right. the but they're making decisions based on they're making decisions the same way people make decisions about whether to go to church or not &gt;&gt; right I I don't feel like it I feel like I should you know do something different take a walk in the woods they say I feel more spiritual and they probably did especially in some of these morgs out here I've been in churches where I would have been much better off to walk in the woods why do we go to church because of the foundation, &gt;&gt; right? That's the in the word. It's it's what the word tells us to do. It didn't say just to go when we felt good about it, &gt;&gt; right? But people have actually left the church because they say, "Well, there's just there's there's nothing to it. We we don't feel like that it's right. So, we're going." So, now the thing is people are spiritual but not religious. &gt;&gt; Spiritual. Everybody's spiritual. And they're getting a spirit. All right. They're getting a national spirit &gt;&gt; because this nation as a whole has left its foundations. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Our national spirit is frolic jokes." He said, "You know why? We were founded upon the doctrine of the apostles. We were founding upon leadership of great men like Washington, Lincoln, but we've moved off of that foundation and we know that we've got it coming." He said, "So this nation is like a boy whistling in a graveyard." Right? As he goes through, I can't whistle. That's why I don't go to graveyards. But it's like it's like a boy whistling in the graveyard. But he but he said they know that that they've got it coming. He said there's a nuclear bomb with their name on it. But he follows that up. He said, "But oh, what a blessed hope for the believer. It's lifting up hands. For our redemption is drawing nigh." When he sees these signs appearing, it's a great time for the believer because we're built on a foundation. Now, why would a person not build on the foundation? I want to address that before we close tonight. Boy, you're you're right with me. I appreciate it. I am uh I'm not doing a good job preaching, but you're doing a good job listening. Why would a person not build on the foundation? &gt;&gt; Stubbornness. If I don't build on the foundation, it's because of stubbornness. I'm not just making this up. If you go to Second Kings chapter 1, Ahab, the king Ahab, everybody remember Ahab. Brother Brandon said, "We live in a nation full of Ahabs. people who are halfway believers. &gt;&gt; But Ahab had a son named Ahaziah. And brother Brandham taught us, he said, Ahaziah would have been a better better man if if Ahab had been a better man. &gt;&gt; Said if his father had been a better man, &gt;&gt; that ought to make us think as fathers. And but Ahaziah, he was caught between the religion of his father and the religion of his mother because his Ahab was a Jew who worshiped God. Remember, he had all them Hebrew prophets that prophesied to him, right? He was a Jew, but he was he was backslid and he married a woman who was not a believer. And so, she caused him all kinds of trouble, Jezebel. So, Jezebel was Ahaziah's mother. So after Ahab died, you'll find it in 2 Kings chapter 1. Uh Ahaziah is brother Brand said he probably drank too much and he fell through a lattice and got an infection. He said he probably fell through and broke his ribs and got an infection. And he tells his servant to go inquire of a god named Beelzeub. Beelub, god of Echron, whether or not he was going to be well. And this is when the vindicated prophet Elijah was in the land. But brother Brandon said he was confused because of his mother, &gt;&gt; right? And so he decided that he would go to be elabub because be elabub. The religion of beelub was more popular than than the religion of the one true god. &gt;&gt; Right? So he said, "We're going to go to be elabub and find out whether or not I'm going to be well." But God spoke to Elijah. The Bible says the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah in 2 Kings 1:3 the Dishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and saying unto them is it not because there's not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of Beub the God of Echron and he said listen ask him why did you do it are you listening to me tonight and we're talking about foundations &gt;&gt; he said why did you do it &gt;&gt; what makes you do it why did you go for worldly ly pleasure instead of building your your life in the right way. Why? Why did you look to the world for satisfaction, &gt;&gt; instead of coming to God, instead of surrendering to him? I know we go through pain. I KNOW WE HAVE STRUGGLES. I know there's times it's hard to live as A CHRISTIAN, BUT WE OUGHT TO THAT OUGHT TO DRIVE US TO HIS THRONE. IT OUGHT TO MAKE US ALL THAT MUCH MORE DETERMINED TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. ALL THAT MUCH MORE DETERMINED TO FALL ON OUR KNEES AND SAY, "LORD, I need a revival. I need you. I need your presence." How many can say amen to that tonight? I need you to be with me. I need you to live. I need you to be in my home. I need you to be in my marriage. I need you to be with my children. &gt;&gt; It ought to drive us TO HIM WHEN WE GO THROUGH HARD TIMES. BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE, because they're confused about what THE FOUNDATION IS, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD OR THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT WRONG. AND SO, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY go out to worldly pleasure &gt;&gt; for entertainment OR FOR SATISFACTION. AND IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED to do. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. Why did you do it? He said, well, he said, well, you know what's happened. You know the scripture. You got them in your own palace. The priests are around there. No doubt you've read them since a boy. Why did you do such a silly thing as that? He said, I wonder tonight if Christ would come on the scene over the nation today and drawing this nation to judgment, if that same question wouldn't been asked, why is it? Why is it we are doing these things? Why are we fussing in the government? I just listened to oral arguments yesterday from the Supreme Court on whether or not they allow boys on girls sports teams and and and some of the justices were sympathetic to it. I'm going, "What in the world? How do you get so messed up?" &gt;&gt; And I'm, no pun intended, I'm laying a foundation tonight for Sunday morning. But how does the world get? YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN IN Genesis 1? &gt;&gt; How does it get without form and void? &gt;&gt; How does it become a wasteland? &gt;&gt; Now, think about it for a minute. &gt;&gt; BUT BUT GOD, THE THE WORD PUT ORDER TO THE VOID. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; The the word spoke and and what was disorderly and chaos became order &gt;&gt; when the word spoke in it. THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN IN OUR LIVES. But you realize Satan's eating, what Satan's doing is ACTUALLY TAKING THE WORLD BACK. Satan's eating IS COMING BACK INTO CHAOS &gt;&gt; where boys don't know who they are. GIRLS DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. CHURCHES DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY WORSHIP. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; People don't know. Even in the message, THEY MESSAGE BELIEVERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE GETTING TO THAT POINT? BECAUSE COME ON, CHURCH. The devil, SATAN, THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE IS TAKING PEOPLE BACK TO CHAOS. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHAOS. I WANT TO I WANT TO GO TO THAT HEAVENLY JERUSALEM, A NEW CITY, AN ORDERLY PLACE &gt;&gt; BUILT BY the word of God. &gt;&gt; Do you want order in your home? Do you want it to run? You say, "Well, I want peace in my home, so I I'll just start doing what some psychologist SAYS OR SOMEBODY ELSE." COME BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I want peace at work. I want TO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO RIGHT AND LIVE RIGHT. KNOW I'M GOING TO BE. SO, I'LL just go out and do what the world does. NO, LET'S GO BACK TO THE WORD. FIND OUT IF WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. &gt;&gt; If we're building on the foundation and then if we are set our face to go forward, say why are we fussing in the government whether we should read the Bible in public? And why if we're reading all this nonsense? Did not our forefathers set this constitution in order? Did not this nation be born upon the principles of the Bible? Aren't we here for freedom of religion to act in God the way we feel fit to act the way we are convinced is truth? But you see, we've done something like they did then. We're just letting everything politics swallow us up instead of respecting our faith in our God. Men who has stood for truth. We're letting our politics run over that. Voting in such stuff that's polluting this nation. Well, we're coming to a judgment. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a statement in that sermon. He said, "God will raise up a prophet and they'll know it was God, but they won't repent." &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; And they knew it was God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Vice President Nixon attended the meetings. I've been told in Washington DC, they knew it was God. &gt;&gt; The world knew it was God, &gt;&gt; but they didn't repent. &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah asked the question, Jeremiah 8:22, "Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? I would ask us the same thing tonight. We live below our privileges, &gt;&gt; right? If if if if our life and I understand everybody's going to have winds and storm, but if your building keeps getting knocked down, why is that? &gt;&gt; Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? &gt;&gt; Brandon said, "We wonder that tonight. Why is there no Bible? Is there no God? Is there no difference? If God is going to bring the people to judgment, he's got to have something to judge them by. There's got to be some standard. But God will judge the world by Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ is the word. The word is God. And he will judge them by this Bible. For this is the word. That is God's standard. We must Someone say it with me. We must measure up to what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Right? So our children just just don't get to decide whether they're boys or girls. That's right. &gt;&gt; We teach them that a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. We don't get to decide whether we should get married four or five times. &gt;&gt; We teach them once you make that vow, that's for that's for good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I know. I know it's heavy, but but we need to make sure our foundation is right cuz we sure don't want to get blown down between now and Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said that that's God's standard. we must measure up to what the Bible says. Now, it wasn't exactly they didn't have a physician. They did. We have a physician, the great physician tonight. He said God was the physician. It wasn't because there wasn't a God in Israel. There was a God. They had a prophet TO CONSULT TO FIND OUT WHAT THESE things are. But it was the king's own stubborn will. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing that gets in the way every time. We know the word, right? And we're taught it. I'm not preaching at anybody. I'm preaching at me if anybody because this is the story of my life where I've messed up in my life. When I when I get a little off the path, it's because my own stubborn will. Can anyone say amen to that tonight? It was the king's own stubborn will. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said that's what's the matter in the nation today. It's the people's own stubborn will. Not because we don't have the same God that crossed the Red Sea. Brother Joel talked about that Sunday night with his people that fed them 40 years in the wilderness. It's not because we don't have the same God that we had in the beginning. It's the people's own stubborn way. &gt;&gt; He said they don't want to bow down. They don't want to have anything to do with holiness and purity of living, the Bible way of living. They'd rather belong to church and put their name on a book, even in the message, &gt;&gt; live like the rest of the world, than to bow down to the promises and the commandments of Almighty God. But I say, God, let me bow down to THAT WHICH BRINGS ORDER IN MY LIFE. LET ME WORSHIP that which WHICH CREATES STABILITY. Let let me let me in inquire of and and ASK THE ONE WHO'S GOT ALL THE ANSWERS. Come on, CHURCH. YOU MIGHT ASK THE INTERNET, GOOGLE don't have all the answers. CHAT GPT DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT THERE is one who's got all the answers. WE CAN INQUIRE OF HIM TODAY. YOU SAY, "WELL, GOOGLE'S EASY. I can get on there and ask a question." Listen, prayer is easy, too. You don't have to WORK YOURSELF UP. YOU TALK TO GOD LIKE YOU DO TO A FRIEND and say, "Lord, I need an answer." And he'll give you one in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll speak to you tonight. I'm a witness. How many could witness with me tonight? If you really get down TO BUSINESS WITH GOD, HE'LL speak to you and lead you and tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; He'll put you in the right place. &gt;&gt; WE BOW DOWN to the promises. GLORY TO GOD. BECAUSE WHEN I'M SURRENDERED TO THE PROMISES, THERE'S HEALING IN MY LIFE. THERE'S STABILITY IN MY MARRIAGE. THERE'S STABILITY IN the church &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING BY MY OWN OPINION. I'M NOT UP HERE PREACHING A BUNCH OF STUFF I MADE UP. BUT I'M ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE APOSTLES AND THE PROPHETS. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what the matter today is. It's the reason people are going the way they are. People get away from the word. You'll never be able to get straightened out till we get back on the right path." &gt;&gt; He said they built this building. talking about the building he was in, but the building here, I believe the building he was in was actually that that tabernacle in Hot Springs that brother Nathan Ericson went by and saw the other day said they built this building, put that corner down here somewhere. He said, "You'd never get the building built. Just put it down anywhere." He said, "You got to be laid on the foundation." And the foundation is the Bible, doctrine of apostles and prophets and so forth of the Bible. He comes back to he said the king's own stubborn way. Oh, brother Josh, how my heart was convicted as I as I listened and I read that and I went back and listened to it and I said, "Oh, God, don't let me just do things out of my own stubborn will. Let me build on a foundation. &gt;&gt; It's been laid." &gt;&gt; Said he didn't just want to sin down there. It wasn't very popular. Brother Brandham talked about in this message, he talked about how people would die. He said a man will die on a doctor's doorstep if he won't take the medicine the doctor gave him. &gt;&gt; He said if he's got a curable disease &gt;&gt; and the doctor gives you medicine for it and you won't take it. He said he said that the man would die on the doctor's doorstep. Look, we understand there's some things medicine won't cure and that's when we give up to God, &gt;&gt; right? But but if it's a curable disease, he said here was something that he could be cured of. He won't take the medicine. He said they die on the doctor's doorstep. He said people die on the pews &gt;&gt; because they won't take the medicine. He said people sit in the church and hear the messages of God and believe them. &gt;&gt; Church, do you realize where the line is? This where Jesus said. He said, "If anyone hear these sayings of mine and do it, &gt;&gt; his house will be on a rock." Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if he just hears it and don't do it, &gt;&gt; realize the danger that young people, if you grow up in church and you've heard the sound went to all the earth, you've heard. We are without excuse today. &gt;&gt; We know what the word says. If you don't know, you can know. Don't build your life on your own opinion. Die on the pew. People sit in the church and hear the message of God and believe them and won't accept it. They wouldn't say, "Well, now I don't believe that's right. Some of them will come say and agree with it. Say, "I believe it's right, but you won't do it." He said, "You'll die." Dying in the pews of the church because they won't accept the remedy. They won't see what it does. It takes a little bit of the popularity out of the people. Kind of beats them up a little bit. He said they're afraid of that new birth. You know, any birth is a mess. He I don't care what it is. If it's in a pig pin or a pink decorated hospital, it's a mess. And so is the new birth. It'll make you do things you didn't think you would do. It'll straighten you up. But before you can ever get right, you have to come through that mess. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know, as I said, I I keep repeating that, but it's heavy on a Wednesday night. I know that. But if we could ever get this little group that's here, you know, I know you really want to be in church or you wouldn't have worked all day and come to church on a Wednesday night. And I salute you for that. But if you're here tonight, if we could just get us right, if we could just get this little group of believers in one accord IN ONE PLACE, I BELIEVE THE HOLY GHOST IS STILL THE SAME AS HE WAS on the DAY OF PENTECOST. I BELIEVE THAT FOUNDATION IS STILL THERE. YEAH, &gt;&gt; if we could just get us in the same in the same thought and the same mind. Lord, I'm going to bow down before your word. I'm going to ask YOUR OPINION. I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MESSAGE SAYS. FIND OUT WHAT THE SCRIPTURES SAY. He said, "A birth is a mess." He said, "So is the new birth. It'll make you do things you didn't think you'd do. It'll straighten you up. Before you can ever get right, you got to come through that mess. Before a seed can ever be born, it has to die and rot." And that's what's the matter with people today. They don't want to die and rot out to the world so they can be born again of the Holy Ghost. What did the chief cornerstone say? You must be born again. What did Paul say? And I'm closing with this. He said, "According to the grace of God, which is given unto me as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildth thereon. Would you bow your heads with me for just a moment? It's Wednesday night. We've got things to do, but I just want to we come for reflection, brother. We come to church. It's the house of correction. I say, Lord, correct me. I can be a very stubborn person and yet I know that stubbornness is like witchcraft. The Bible says has a sin of witchcraft. Rebellion. I don't want to have rebellion to the word. I don't want to sit there and believe it and know it's true. Not do it. Say, "God, help me tonight. When I know if I do it, my family will be right and my life will get better and there will be benefits even in this life of living right. I've preached many times to people who were about to make a very bad decision in their life because they they consulted be elabub instead of consulting Jesus the word. Why don't you talk to Jesus tonight? If you got some decision to make, if you've got a young people, if you if you don't know where to go in life, you don't know what to do, ask the word. And don't ask in a way of like, well, I'll find out what he says. If I don't agree with it, I'll do my own thing. But say, Lord, I surrender. I surrender my heart. I surrender my life. I surrender my ways. I surrender everything to you. I want my life to start right. I want it to continue right. I got a ministry. I want my ministry to be built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. I WANT MY FAMILY TO be built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. I want the church to be built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Let it be, Lord. Take away that old stubborn will. Put in a heart of flesh. Oh God, we don't want to be hard-hearted, church. We don't want to get stubborn. This is how my family will run. You better check that out with the word. If you just because you've been doing something for 40 years, don't make it right. This is how I talk to my wife, you better check it out with the word. This is how I talk to my husband. You better check it out with the word. This is how I deal with my children. You better check it out with the word. Build on the right foundation. Today, people consult YouTube videos to find out how to build things. And some people become good builders just by consulting videos. We have a a vision that's been given in this day, a prophet to show us how to build, to take the scriptures and show us how to set up a family, how to set up a church. Let's take advantage of that church and surrender oursel to the word of the hour. Would you do that tonight? Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, with my head bowed, my heart bowed, Lord, I've got tears in my heart tonight. I I don't want my own stubborn will to get in the way till I would do that which was popular instead of that which was right. Oh God, I pray that you'd help me to be bound to your word. Lord, to do only what your word says to do. Oh, let me conduct my life. Let me build on a foundation, Lord. As I've testified already, I know that where I've built on the foundation, that has lasted in my life. There's a lasting quality to that which is built on the foundation, Lord. And when I build, let me not build with hay and stubble, but let me build, oh God, with precious jewels, Lord, that I mine from the word of God. Pray you'd grant it, Lord God. Let me build a a house appropriate for a temple for you. Let me be a pillar in that temple, oh God. Oh, I pray you grant it, oh God. Forgive us, Lord, where we've not built the right foundation. We don't want chaos. We don't The world is slipping into chaos. They don't know who they are. Lord, we know who we are today. I pray none of these young people as we're going through the stream of time. And I pray they would not slip into that stream of of gaity that the prophet talked about, that stream of entertainment, that stream that was going by, that blackness and darkness, popularity. But oh God, may they remain on the straight and narrow way. Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadth to salvation. I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
