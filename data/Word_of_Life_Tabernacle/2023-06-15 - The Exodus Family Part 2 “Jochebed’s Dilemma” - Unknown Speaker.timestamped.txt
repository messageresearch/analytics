[47:06] the anointing of your spirit we pray
[47:08] you'd Grant it now in Jesus name
[47:11] amen thank you Lord
[47:16] turn to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 23
[47:18] we're going to continue on The Exodus
[47:21] family
[47:22] Hebrews 11 23
[47:25] reads like this by faith Moses when he
[47:28] was born
[47:29] was he was a hid three months of his
[47:31] parents because they saw he was a proper
[47:34] child and they were not afraid of the
[47:37] king's commandment I pray the Lord
[47:40] without his Blessing to the word you may
[47:42] be seated
[47:46] it's a hard age to be born into it's
[47:50] definitely a hard age to raise children
[47:52] in I I heard a story or saw a video of a
[47:55] young woman who decided she wanted to
[47:57] sue her parents for having her because
[48:00] she had to get a job she'd reach the age
[48:03] she had to get a job and had to make it
[48:05] in the world and that's kind of a
[48:07] difficult situation so she said I'll
[48:09] just sue them and and they might have
[48:11] wanted to sue her back if they could for
[48:14] for being who she was but just the age
[48:17] that we live in It's A Hard age and yet
[48:20] we we've been called to this age and God
[48:22] wouldn't have put us here if we couldn't
[48:23] handle it and that's that's a revelation
[48:26] in itself is whatever we've been given
[48:29] whatever problems that we Face we have
[48:32] the ability to handle those problems or
[48:35] he wouldn't have allowed us to go
[48:37] through it and there's a great comfort
[48:40] in that and understanding and and
[48:42] receiving from from God in that way that
[48:45] Lord I know uh that I must be able to
[48:47] take it Lord give me strength to be able
[48:50] to Bear it and so we know that Egypt at
[48:52] the time of The Exodus was a a difficult
[48:55] place to raise children the government
[48:58] made it difficult the culture made it
[49:01] different difficult in fact the
[49:03] government and the culture of that time
[49:04] were insane and I think we could say the
[49:07] same thing about this government and and
[49:09] this culture that we live in today it's
[49:12] just it's just grouping in Insanity it's
[49:14] it's nonsense everywhere and yet we want
[49:17] to raise children that are that are
[49:19] Godly in in the world and that's the
[49:22] situation that they face during that
[49:24] time the Bible says in Exodus 1 13 that
[49:27] the Egyptians made the children of
[49:29] Israel to serve with rigor in other
[49:32] words they they made them slaves that's
[49:34] what that word means they made their
[49:37] lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar
[49:40] and brick and in all manner of service
[49:41] in the field all their service were and
[49:44] they made them serve was with rigor they
[49:47] they become slaves and they served with
[49:50] rigor and a pharaoh knew that the the
[49:54] more that they grew the more of a threat
[49:56] that they were so he tried to disrupt
[49:59] the home life as much as he could and he
[50:01] did that as we saw last week he tried to
[50:04] make it impossible for a man to fulfill
[50:06] his Covenant of work of providing for
[50:09] his own and now we're going to see that
[50:11] he's going to attack the woman he's
[50:13] going to attack the mothers he's going
[50:15] to attack the wives in their Covenant
[50:17] trying to make it as difficult as
[50:18] possible for them to do what God called
[50:21] them to do yet God's going to have some
[50:23] mothers at the time of The Exodus that
[50:26] were able to produce a Moses out of
[50:28] their home and God's going to have some
[50:30] people today it may not be exactly the
[50:32] way people see it happening but somehow
[50:34] God made it work
[50:38] so he's going to attack the woman in the
[50:40] Covenant that she has
[50:43] now that Covenant is in Genesis 3 16.
[50:46] you remember the dual covenant brother
[50:48] said in marriage and divorce he taught
[50:51] us a man and the woman had a dual
[50:52] covenant and he said unto the woman he
[50:55] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[50:57] and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt
[51:01] bring forth children thy desire shall be
[51:03] to husband and he shall rule over thee
[51:06] so her Covenant was one of childbearing
[51:10] and submission to her husband
[51:14] and yet there's more to being a woman
[51:17] than having babies and serving your
[51:19] husband
[51:22] I thought I'd get a big amen out of that
[51:26] just like there's more to being a man
[51:27] than work
[51:30] right you got to be a Christian too
[51:33] you've got to live in the world
[51:34] and yet but but you do have to do that
[51:37] you have to be a man and work but that's
[51:40] only part of what you are the same thing
[51:42] is true of a woman it's their primary
[51:45] role
[51:46] given by God and yet there's some some
[51:49] women that never even get married and
[51:51] yet they serve God in in that capacity
[51:53] and some women that can never have
[51:55] children they yet they serve God in that
[51:57] capacity
[51:58] and they become very strong women and
[52:01] and a woman uh maybe that never has a
[52:04] house to keep and yet and yet they could
[52:06] be a woman of God but yet their primary
[52:09] role is still that there's something
[52:10] something about them that wants to
[52:12] fulfill that Covenant I think a woman in
[52:15] this age must be strong but not
[52:18] dominating it it takes a strong woman in
[52:20] this hour to submit to her husband when
[52:23] the world is in an exodus condition when
[52:25] it when it teaches the other way
[52:28] and and and begin to be dominating now
[52:30] Paul taught that one way a woman honors
[52:34] or submits to her husband is by wearing
[52:36] long hair do you know that that's what
[52:39] that actually is First Corinthians 11 3
[52:41] I'm not going to preach on hair tonight
[52:42] but I'm just building a background for
[52:44] where we want to go first Corinthians 11
[52:47] 3 said I would have you know that the
[52:48] head of every man is Christ the head of
[52:50] the woman is the man in the head of
[52:51] Christ is God so he's building up the
[52:54] the headship in the home he said every
[52:57] man praying or prophesying having his
[52:58] head covered this this on Earth his head
[53:01] and about every and you know people wear
[53:04] a hat while they preach or whatever
[53:06] while they sing we see that today that's
[53:08] why we don't because the Bible teaches a
[53:10] mansion cover his head but every woman
[53:12] that prayeth her prophesies with her
[53:14] head uncovered dishonor through her head
[53:15] for that is even all one as if she were
[53:18] shaven he ties it to the hair and and
[53:21] Paul so it then he goes on and explains
[53:23] that but he's careful to let the people
[53:25] know the woman is not a second class
[53:28] citizen in the Lord and I think that's
[53:30] important for us as well verse 11. he
[53:32] said nevertheless neither it's The Man
[53:34] Without The Woman neither the woman
[53:36] without the man in the Lord in other
[53:38] words we need one another
[53:40] he said for as the woman is of the man
[53:42] even so the man also by the woman in
[53:45] other words there wasn't a man alive
[53:46] that didn't come from a woman
[53:48] right even so is the man also by the
[53:50] woman but all things of God
[53:52] so in Christ and that's why you get some
[53:55] situations you know you begin to think
[53:57] Branham is against women voting how many
[54:00] know that he was against he was against
[54:02] the the women getting the vote I should
[54:05] say it that way he was against the women
[54:07] getting the vote he said great evil had
[54:09] been done and it was because it brought
[54:11] in abortion and everything else
[54:13] same-sex marriage and women's vote and
[54:16] yet he women vote in church
[54:21] and have a say in the church
[54:23] as much as say as any man does when it
[54:26] comes to that they're a voting member of
[54:28] the church how does that work well
[54:30] because in Christ in Christ all things
[54:33] are of God and so you your position in
[54:36] Christ is not lessened because you're a
[54:38] woman or because you're a man but
[54:40] brother Brandon put it this way he said
[54:41] he said God Made Men a help mate not a
[54:44] doormat he said remember she was your
[54:46] sweetheart she should always be that
[54:49] aren't you glad that if you're a real
[54:51] man of God your wife will always be your
[54:53] sweetheart
[54:54] amen
[54:57] now he goes on to say that her hairs are
[54:59] covering so it's not just a hat that she
[55:02] would wear or a scarf but in First
[55:04] Corinthians 11 13 judging yourselves as
[55:06] a commonly that a woman praying to God
[55:07] uncovered that's not even nature itself
[55:09] teach you that if a man have long hair
[55:11] it is a shame unto him but if a woman
[55:14] have long hair is a glory to her for her
[55:17] hair is given her for a covering so a
[55:19] woman's Covenant then is also to be a
[55:22] keeper or worker at home that's what the
[55:24] word keeper means in Titus Paul tells
[55:27] the older women to teach the younger
[55:29] women he said the age of women likewise
[55:31] they'd be in behaviorist becometh
[55:32] Holiness not not false accusers not
[55:35] given to much wine teachers of good
[55:37] things that they may teach the young
[55:39] women to be sober to love their husbands
[55:41] to love their children to be discreet
[55:44] chased keepers at home good obedient to
[55:47] their own husbands the word of God be
[55:49] not blasphemed now Satan again is
[55:52] working against this
[55:53] biblical order in the home in the time
[55:57] of The Exodus and so where the Branham
[55:59] dramatizes that in in teaching on Moses
[56:02] he talks about how that Pharaoh's
[56:04] counselors came around and they began to
[56:06] tell him uh Pharaoh how can we get these
[56:09] people uh to become more like the world
[56:11] and and they said this they said look
[56:13] you've got the man working you you make
[56:15] them have Attila bricks so many each day
[56:17] make them out of stubble you've killed
[56:19] the little children things but they're
[56:21] still increasing he said the thing you
[56:23] ought to do is put the women to work too
[56:24] he said if you put the women to work and
[56:26] he said no that's not a woman's place he
[56:28] said so they said but you put the woman
[56:30] into work put them out there let them
[56:32] make brick too and they'll be so tired
[56:34] when they come in they can't cook their
[56:35] husbands supper they can't be a good
[56:37] Mama see him and so if they're going to
[56:39] work and go on like that so they won't
[56:40] be able to do it so you put them to work
[56:43] too is everybody with me so far
[56:46] yeah again it's it's a conspiracy in our
[56:50] day
[56:51] there's been a conspiracy to make the
[56:53] economic situation so bad that you can't
[56:56] hardly make it without two incomes now
[56:59] and that's the reality of the time that
[57:00] we live in
[57:02] it's happened in our time
[57:04] I want to say this I I am so proud of
[57:07] many of our young couples that have have
[57:09] chosen for the the wife to stay at home
[57:11] and I know how hard that is because we
[57:13] made that choice for my wife to stay
[57:15] home and then if you have several
[57:16] children the choice kind of gets made
[57:18] for you but but that's hard that's
[57:20] difficult because it's difficult to make
[57:23] a living by yourself but I'm proud of
[57:26] you you young men that do that and and
[57:29] this has happened in our time that women
[57:31] have been put to work and and yet I want
[57:34] to be careful with this because brother
[57:36] Branham didn't act like some of us do
[57:38] sometimes and and shame women who had to
[57:41] work
[57:43] brother Branham didn't do that
[57:45] he when he was talking about Margie Cox
[57:48] I I knew the the Cox family and uh new
[57:51] sister Nelly and brother Charlie well
[57:53] this would be sister Nellie's or brother
[57:55] Charlie's brother I believe and and yeah
[57:57] his brother and her sister-in-law Margie
[58:00] and he talked about her and how she'd
[58:03] been healed of diabetes and told that
[58:05] testimony and I've heard the testimony
[58:08] from the Cox's
[58:10] and he talked about how that those
[58:11] ladies Margie and Nelly worked in the
[58:14] factory
[58:15] and and he said the little lady Works
[58:18] day and night almost up there a loyal
[58:20] little mother to help her husband to pay
[58:21] for their home that they're trying to
[58:23] build and her and her little sister
[58:25] Nelly and Charlie he said that's the
[58:27] brother of Rodney his wife all them
[58:28] working together at them factories there
[58:30] just as hard as they can go and standing
[58:33] the reproach they let their hair grow
[58:34] out taking the makeup off things like
[58:36] that when they become Christians he said
[58:39] I believe in giving credit where credit
[58:40] is deserved he said and I certainly have
[58:43] a warm place in my heart for those two
[58:45] young women they were working in a
[58:47] factory and I'll be honest with you I
[58:49] wouldn't want my wife working in a
[58:51] factory
[58:52] I don't think it'd be a good place for
[58:54] my wife to be I'd do everything I could
[58:56] to keep her out of there and yet brother
[58:58] Brandon said he had a warm place in his
[59:00] heart for these ladies he never told
[59:02] them they had to quit or or that they
[59:04] were doing he said they were doing
[59:05] something to help see the motive matters
[59:07] and we've read that to you recently but
[59:09] brother Brown was asked the question are
[59:11] women allowed to work in public affairs
[59:13] when they have a healthy husband and
[59:14] children and the person said I'm asking
[59:16] this question for someone else and and
[59:18] I'd just like to talk to the person who
[59:20] asks the question and and find out who
[59:22] they were throwing that off on but
[59:24] brother Brandon was very cautious with
[59:26] that he's very careful with it he said
[59:27] well I don't know about that I can't say
[59:30] he he was a lot more humble than a lot
[59:32] of us were
[59:33] he said I don't know about that I can't
[59:35] say he said but I just have this feeling
[59:37] he said let me say this I believe if I
[59:39] was a woman I mean my husband was
[59:41] healthy had a good job working I believe
[59:43] it would be a great pleasure to me to
[59:45] stay home take care of my children raise
[59:47] them up to love the Lord he said if I
[59:49] had any time for my washing and things
[59:50] that I was going to do I think I'd teach
[59:52] my children how to serve the Lord he
[59:54] said now if you've got a debt or
[59:55] something you're trying to help your
[59:56] husband pay for something that you have
[59:58] to do he said I think that's fine if
[1:00:00] you'll try to help him and you live a
[1:00:02] ladies yeah that's the important thing
[1:00:04] sometimes we miss the big things you can
[1:00:06] stay home and not live like a lady
[1:00:10] you can stay home stay on the internet
[1:00:11] all the time that's no no better than
[1:00:13] being at the office
[1:00:16] all right and so brother Brandon talks
[1:00:18] about being in the office where they men
[1:00:19] told dirty jokes and some of us have
[1:00:21] been in those environments it's no place
[1:00:23] for a lady it's no place for a man for
[1:00:25] that matter many places that I've been
[1:00:27] but but brother Brown said now if a
[1:00:29] woman can hold herself as a real lady
[1:00:31] and trying to help her husband do
[1:00:33] something to meet some clothes for the
[1:00:35] kids to go to school or Alpha bill or
[1:00:37] something like that and she wants to
[1:00:38] work till that's over he said no this is
[1:00:40] not the Lord because I don't have no
[1:00:42] scripture for this he said I don't know
[1:00:43] one way or another
[1:00:45] he said I'm just saying that'd be my
[1:00:47] opinion but otherwise I wouldn't think
[1:00:49] just because she wants to work just to
[1:00:50] run around and have more money to spend
[1:00:52] run around run to bar rooms or drink
[1:00:55] smoke and carry on I don't think she
[1:00:57] should do it I think she should stay
[1:00:58] home try to be a lady and take care of
[1:01:00] her house and I'll see if there's any
[1:01:02] women in this church that are working in
[1:01:04] order to buy cigarettes or in order to
[1:01:06] buy alcohol in order to run around in
[1:01:08] bar rooms you ought to quit working and
[1:01:09] stay home
[1:01:13] it's the devil that that done it though
[1:01:16] made it to where it's so hard so
[1:01:18] difficult because as I've said many
[1:01:20] times if if a woman has a job and
[1:01:23] outside of the home she has two jobs
[1:01:25] because she still has her primary
[1:01:27] responsibility at home and it's
[1:01:29] difficult
[1:01:30] now so they they were trying to destroy
[1:01:33] the image that God had for the home and
[1:01:36] it's the same thing that's going on
[1:01:37] today
[1:01:39] and then we find that Pharaoh he called
[1:01:42] out he was trying to work this where he
[1:01:45] could get rid of these people in Exodus
[1:01:47] chapter one and he talked to the Hebrew
[1:01:49] midwives and and he told him he said you
[1:01:52] know he said when there's a girl baby
[1:01:53] born he said you can let them be born
[1:01:55] but whenever there's a boy baby you need
[1:01:58] to kill it
[1:01:59] and was a direct order from the King but
[1:02:01] the midwives feared God and they refused
[1:02:04] to deal with that abortion program that
[1:02:06] was there but infanticide that was there
[1:02:08] and I believe God's got some people
[1:02:10] today that are still good people that
[1:02:13] won't do that and won't partake in that
[1:02:15] and that's what was happening then these
[1:02:17] people would not partake in that and so
[1:02:19] brother or the Bible says therefore God
[1:02:22] dealt well with the midwives I think God
[1:02:24] will deal well with anybody who is who
[1:02:27] is for life and who doesn't want to kill
[1:02:30] babies
[1:02:31] so God dealt well with the midwives and
[1:02:34] the people multiplied and waxed very
[1:02:35] Mighty and it came to pass because the
[1:02:37] midwives feared God he made them houses
[1:02:40] in other words he blessed them
[1:02:41] financially because of what they did
[1:02:43] this nation listened to me this nation
[1:02:46] when it protects children God will bless
[1:02:49] it and when it doesn't protect children
[1:02:51] he'll curse it
[1:02:53] just like if this nation stands for
[1:02:55] Israel God will bless it when they don't
[1:02:57] stand for Israel he'll curse it there
[1:02:58] are certain things that God does
[1:03:00] and even if I was not a Christian I'd
[1:03:03] want to be on God God's good side
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:08] but now they feared God rather than man
[1:03:11] and they were blessed financially and
[1:03:12] and Pharaoh in Exodus 1 22 charged all
[1:03:16] his people then he said every son that
[1:03:19] is born you shall cast into the river
[1:03:21] every daughter you shall save a life
[1:03:24] and brother Branham dramatizes that and
[1:03:27] he says these these women he said that
[1:03:29] had never had children and never wanted
[1:03:30] children he said and they were women
[1:03:32] with no feelings for children like what
[1:03:35] you would normally have he said they
[1:03:36] they went out he said it was witches
[1:03:38] like with with long fingernails and pain
[1:03:40] on their face and and we got some of
[1:03:42] those running around today I think they
[1:03:45] have no uh they had no I saw the other
[1:03:47] day where a woman killed her own son
[1:03:50] over a dispute over a lawnmower or
[1:03:52] something like that and you look at that
[1:03:54] and think what what kind of a world do
[1:03:56] we live in it's women who have no no
[1:03:58] natural affection no ability to feel he
[1:04:01] said he made them the police but the
[1:04:03] brown said it'd become women police and
[1:04:05] and a woman doesn't have any business in
[1:04:07] that kind of an office but but here they
[1:04:10] become a woman police and they went out
[1:04:12] and they began to begin to go around
[1:04:14] looking for these babies and you can
[1:04:17] imagine what kind of fear that must have
[1:04:19] caused to the children of Israel and and
[1:04:21] how some of them thought well maybe we
[1:04:22] should just do what Pharaoh says and
[1:04:24] kill our children and others there would
[1:04:26] be a natural desire to want to see your
[1:04:28] baby live
[1:04:29] but the Bible attributed it to Faith
[1:04:32] Paul did when he said Moses parents by
[1:04:35] faith they hid Moses
[1:04:37] it was faith that caused him to provide
[1:04:39] a caring home for him it was faith that
[1:04:42] provided that caused him to shelter him
[1:04:44] keep him quiet every time these these
[1:04:46] witches come around and knocked on the
[1:04:48] door and said it's time to it's time to
[1:04:50] give up your child by faith they kept
[1:04:52] him away from them
[1:04:53] and the same things going on today by
[1:04:56] faith we keep our children out of the
[1:04:58] out of the out of the Hollywood culture
[1:05:01] out of the world out of the things that
[1:05:03] are going on we've got to hold on to
[1:05:05] them
[1:05:06] especially when they're very little by
[1:05:09] faith we we build I would say this it's
[1:05:11] not physical walls because physical
[1:05:13] walls won't do it it's not even walls
[1:05:16] that where you can keep them away from
[1:05:17] people as much as it is a wall of prayer
[1:05:20] that you build around your children and
[1:05:22] you take them to the house of God and
[1:05:24] you pray over them and you and you work
[1:05:26] with them and you teach them and you're
[1:05:28] trying to build something in their lives
[1:05:31] what are you doing by faith you do that
[1:05:34] believing that there's going to be a
[1:05:36] fruit out of this the devil's not going
[1:05:38] to get them like he does all the other
[1:05:39] children
[1:05:41] who am I we have that promise today
[1:05:45] the devil can't have my children
[1:05:47] I might say Amen to that tonight not
[1:05:49] letting him have my children
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:53] now and so in Exodus 2 1 now it says
[1:05:58] there when a man of the house of Levi
[1:06:00] and took to wife a daughter of Levi and
[1:06:02] the woman conceived embarrassed son
[1:06:05] and when she saw him that he was a
[1:06:07] goodly child she hit him three months
[1:06:11] this Faith being expressed but the brown
[1:06:14] taught us that works is Faith expressed
[1:06:16] the faith of the parents being expressed
[1:06:19] by the act of hiding Moses away from the
[1:06:23] king's commandment
[1:06:25] they saw something in it that others did
[1:06:28] not see he was a goodly child
[1:06:32] Exodus 2 3 and when she could not longer
[1:06:34] hide him
[1:06:36] now this is where it gets interesting
[1:06:38] because
[1:06:39] there come a time she couldn't hide him
[1:06:42] no longer
[1:06:44] and I think for all of us there Comes A
[1:06:46] Time with our children that we can't
[1:06:47] hide them no more it's very simple
[1:06:49] tonight but I I want us to understand
[1:06:51] this that in this time of Exodus we want
[1:06:54] to hide our children
[1:06:55] but there Comes A Time you can't
[1:06:58] and there comes a time you've got to
[1:07:00] commit your children to the Providence
[1:07:02] of God
[1:07:06] can no longer hide him
[1:07:08] she took for him an ark of bull rushes
[1:07:12] dobbed it with slime and with pitch and
[1:07:15] put the child there in and she laid it
[1:07:17] in the flags by the river's Brink
[1:07:20] and his sister stood afar off to wit
[1:07:24] what would be done to him
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:28] there are two parts to raising a child
[1:07:31] just as there was with Moses parents the
[1:07:34] first part you hide them you protect
[1:07:37] them
[1:07:38] and then the second part letting them go
[1:07:41] and many times it's the second part
[1:07:43] that's so difficult I think some of some
[1:07:46] of you Elders could probably tell me
[1:07:47] this better than I could say myself but
[1:07:50] especially some of you mothers you worry
[1:07:52] more about your children now than what
[1:07:54] you did when they were little
[1:07:56] because now they they get to make their
[1:07:59] own decisions
[1:08:00] and you being a full-grown human being
[1:08:02] you know just how stupid human beings
[1:08:04] can be
[1:08:06] right
[1:08:07] and so you wonder about your children
[1:08:11] my kids growing up and I I think Lord I
[1:08:14] I don't want them to make some of the
[1:08:15] mistakes that I made and yet I want them
[1:08:18] to follow the path that I did because I
[1:08:19] followed a path that led to Mercy and
[1:08:21] repentance and Grace and and godliness
[1:08:24] and and the and the ability to be in the
[1:08:27] house of God and to worship God I want
[1:08:29] them to follow that path but yet not
[1:08:31] make the mistakes that I made
[1:08:33] but but I can't control that after a
[1:08:35] certain time you got to build the ark
[1:08:39] you got to pitch it with tar you got to
[1:08:41] prepare it
[1:08:43] but then you got to let them go
[1:08:47] so she could only hide Moses so long
[1:08:51] joke about just as Abraham and last
[1:08:53] Wednesday night we preached about how
[1:08:54] amram faced The Dilemma is it going to
[1:08:57] work or take care of his house is it
[1:09:00] going to work or is he going to pray
[1:09:02] it's a dilemma he did both
[1:09:05] and jokerman faced a dilemma in her
[1:09:07] Covenant to care for her children Satan
[1:09:09] always will force us to try to force us
[1:09:12] to to choose and try to get us to make
[1:09:14] the wrong choice
[1:09:16] and she faced The Dilemma in her
[1:09:18] Covenant to care for her child she could
[1:09:20] only hide him for so long
[1:09:21] because he was getting too big to hide
[1:09:24] and brother Brown taught us in teaching
[1:09:27] Moses he said teaching about Moses he
[1:09:30] said brother Branham our brother Brown
[1:09:31] said amram had a dream and he started
[1:09:33] building and God showed him what to
[1:09:35] build he started building a little boat
[1:09:37] made out of reeds and I'll say this I I
[1:09:40] didn't have a dream about what to do
[1:09:42] with my children I remember thinking I
[1:09:43] have no clue how to raise children but I
[1:09:46] did have the word of God
[1:09:48] and the word of God was God's revealed
[1:09:50] will to me of how to build an ark
[1:09:55] from my children
[1:09:56] how do I build an ark for my children
[1:09:58] well I build an ark out of prayer I
[1:10:01] build an ark out of out of Bible reading
[1:10:03] I built an ark out of teaching
[1:10:06] I built an ark out of going to church
[1:10:10] I built it out of faith
[1:10:12] are you with me now I build it out of
[1:10:14] love
[1:10:16] I'm building an ark for my family
[1:10:19] building an art putting it together and
[1:10:21] so he said Imran was down there building
[1:10:23] a shark at night so he switched over he
[1:10:25] was praying you remember he got an
[1:10:27] answer to his prayer though the
[1:10:28] situation had not changed
[1:10:30] so now he was believing and now he went
[1:10:33] to work and said past the bricks you
[1:10:34] remember but now he's got to build a
[1:10:37] boat for his child so he can send him
[1:10:40] away
[1:10:41] so he goes to the basement for a
[1:10:43] different reason he's been going
[1:10:44] upstairs to pray now he goes down to the
[1:10:46] basement and he begins to work there's a
[1:10:48] time to pray and there's a time to work
[1:10:51] so now he started building a little boat
[1:10:54] and here his wife she said have you been
[1:10:57] in the basement praying this time of
[1:10:58] night I am with him he said no I've been
[1:11:01] in the basement praising God
[1:11:03] Hallelujah he said what have you been
[1:11:06] doing he said I want to tell you he said
[1:11:07] now you know them old witches is coming
[1:11:09] back
[1:11:10] he said I want to tell you what we're
[1:11:11] going to do
[1:11:12] we've had the baby now for three months
[1:11:15] and we've got to get rid of it
[1:11:20] well there's a tough one
[1:11:22] you'd probably react like Joker bed did
[1:11:24] she said oh ram ram
[1:11:26] we got to do what
[1:11:28] we got to get rid of the baby get rid of
[1:11:31] the babysit yeah oh you're cruel
[1:11:34] no I'm not cruel
[1:11:36] I know what I'm doing
[1:11:38] what do you mean why well you'll be as
[1:11:39] bad as Pharaoh going to get rid of our
[1:11:41] baby
[1:11:42] yeah I'm gonna get rid of the baby oh oh
[1:11:44] we can't
[1:11:45] now listen if we keep it we're going to
[1:11:47] lose it
[1:11:48] or what a lesson this is to us
[1:11:51] what a lesson is this if we keep it
[1:11:53] we're going to lose it we got to commit
[1:11:55] it to God
[1:11:56] and if we give it to the one who gave it
[1:11:59] to us he'll find it
[1:12:02] Hallelujah
[1:12:04] at some point
[1:12:06] now I want you to watch this especially
[1:12:07] those of you who are getting who are
[1:12:09] older and maybe you've seen this and and
[1:12:11] some of us have younger children but
[1:12:13] they're going to be in this place at
[1:12:15] some point her efforts to help her child
[1:12:18] would only endanger it
[1:12:21] she had to let it go
[1:12:24] now that's very difficult for a real
[1:12:25] mother maybe some of these people out
[1:12:27] here today that shoot their children
[1:12:29] wouldn't have a hard time with it but
[1:12:30] for for those who are real mother you'd
[1:12:33] have a difficult time getting rid of
[1:12:35] your children
[1:12:36] putting them in a boat
[1:12:39] send them to school
[1:12:41] letting them go to work
[1:12:43] let them do what they have to learn to
[1:12:45] do I know my wife she she don't want to
[1:12:49] let them do anything that might hurt
[1:12:50] them
[1:12:51] but life is risk
[1:12:54] right and you can't work without taking
[1:12:56] a risk
[1:12:58] you can't you can't love without taking
[1:13:01] a risk
[1:13:02] can't have a family without taking a
[1:13:04] risk so at some point you trying to hold
[1:13:08] them and tell them every what to do
[1:13:09] actually we could endanger them
[1:13:12] because it'll make them rebellious now
[1:13:15] she had to let him go now this is this
[1:13:18] is difficult again for a real mother and
[1:13:20] the Bible says that if we train up a
[1:13:22] child in the way he should go when he's
[1:13:25] old he will not depart from it
[1:13:27] and and that that train is interesting
[1:13:30] in that way because it's to teach a
[1:13:32] child or to pull them back and and the
[1:13:35] way is is the the bit
[1:13:38] the bit of the child the child was bent
[1:13:40] a certain way
[1:13:42] and so you take a tree you know when a
[1:13:44] tree is Young what do you do to it you
[1:13:46] tie it to a post
[1:13:48] when it's a sapling you take a tree and
[1:13:51] you tie it to a post with a bit of
[1:13:52] fabric
[1:13:53] why do you do that you want to influence
[1:13:56] the way it's growing
[1:13:58] so you're not going to let it be around
[1:14:00] certain people
[1:14:02] right it's a sampling it can't handle it
[1:14:06] so it's got to grow up straight
[1:14:09] right and we make these choices are we
[1:14:11] going to send them to public school or
[1:14:12] home school and I'll say there's there's
[1:14:14] problems both ways right but you're
[1:14:17] making that choice you're tying that
[1:14:18] fabric around that sapling well who you
[1:14:21] let them fellowship with maybe even
[1:14:22] people in your own family you say well
[1:14:24] it's not good for them to be around them
[1:14:25] and and it's not good for them to spend
[1:14:27] time with them because what are you
[1:14:29] doing you're tying them up
[1:14:31] you want them to grow straight
[1:14:33] literally
[1:14:34] in this day and age
[1:14:37] you want them to grow straight you want
[1:14:39] you want them to be you want to be okay
[1:14:43] it's crazy out there
[1:14:45] I read the other day the school had a
[1:14:47] big Pride display in Massachusetts and
[1:14:49] the kids got upset they got tired of
[1:14:51] being indoctrinated and they kind of
[1:14:53] they took over the school and poured all
[1:14:55] the stuff down now they're in a lot of
[1:14:56] trouble
[1:14:57] I have to say I mean
[1:14:59] what are you gonna do
[1:15:01] what are you going to do I'm not
[1:15:03] advocating that but it's a hard age when
[1:15:05] they're young you got it's our
[1:15:07] responsibility to tie them up
[1:15:10] right they need boundaries
[1:15:12] they need to be told no
[1:15:15] we better tell them that while they're
[1:15:16] young or they'll never hear it while
[1:15:17] they're old when they get old is that
[1:15:19] right
[1:15:19] so it's our responsibility to tell them
[1:15:22] no
[1:15:23] but we tie them up we don't tie them up
[1:15:25] with something that'll hurt them but but
[1:15:27] we tie them up so that they grow to be a
[1:15:29] mature tree but have you ever noticed if
[1:15:31] you tried to take a mature tree brother
[1:15:33] Joe that's already bit
[1:15:35] a certain direction and you tie a rope
[1:15:38] around it now you're going to influence
[1:15:40] its growth you know what you'll do to it
[1:15:41] you'll wound it
[1:15:44] right because the Rope will actually
[1:15:46] grow into the tree
[1:15:48] I've seen it done
[1:15:50] or whatever it is if it comes up against
[1:15:52] a fence if it comes up against something
[1:15:53] that tree is so mature it won't it'll
[1:15:56] just it'll just go around that it'll
[1:15:58] become a wound on the tree and the tree
[1:16:01] won't live a song because of the fact
[1:16:03] that it's wounded
[1:16:05] huh
[1:16:06] and so many times when we get to a
[1:16:09] certain age and I don't know who I'm not
[1:16:11] preaching to any individuals tonight I I
[1:16:13] may be preaching to Future me so you
[1:16:15] just bear with me tonight
[1:16:17] but when our kids get to a certain place
[1:16:19] that uh you know we we want our children
[1:16:22] and mother especially once their
[1:16:24] children to be at home that never
[1:16:25] changes by the way my mother still wants
[1:16:29] all her children to live with her you
[1:16:30] know that's just the way it is
[1:16:33] that's just the way it is you don't ever
[1:16:34] get over that but the Branham talked
[1:16:36] about how there's nothing that mother
[1:16:37] wants more than to see all of her
[1:16:39] children gathered around the table and
[1:16:41] you have a promise that one day if you
[1:16:43] never have another Thanksgiving if you
[1:16:45] never have another Christmas if you
[1:16:46] never get them all together again maybe
[1:16:47] some of them have gone on to be with the
[1:16:49] Lord and I know some of you've lost
[1:16:51] several children they've gone on to be
[1:16:53] with the Lord but one day you have a
[1:16:54] promise that there's going to be a table
[1:16:56] and you're going to be gathered around
[1:16:57] it again
[1:16:58] you have that promise and you can hold
[1:17:00] on to that that's what mother wants
[1:17:04] but if a child is wasting their money
[1:17:07] on drugs and alcohol and living in that
[1:17:10] way and you're giving them a free place
[1:17:12] to stay sometimes you're hindering the
[1:17:14] child trying to hold them up more than
[1:17:15] you're helping
[1:17:19] sometimes you just have to let God be
[1:17:20] God
[1:17:22] and we don't always understand what
[1:17:24] God's doing
[1:17:26] all right we don't understand what God
[1:17:28] is doing that's why the way of God
[1:17:30] sometimes is hard
[1:17:31] it's a harder way he's told Brother
[1:17:33] Brown because you've chosen the harder
[1:17:34] way
[1:17:35] we don't understand what God's doing you
[1:17:37] look at Jeremiah and Israel Jeremiah is
[1:17:39] in is in the nation of Israel at a time
[1:17:42] when it seems like they need patriotism
[1:17:43] and they need somebody to stand up and
[1:17:45] say hey let's go fight this war with the
[1:17:47] Babylonians that's not the prophet that
[1:17:50] God called Jeremiah to be he was a
[1:17:52] weeping prophet because he constantly
[1:17:55] had to preach go with them
[1:17:57] go with them let them go let go with
[1:17:59] them make peace with the Babylonians
[1:18:01] and the people say what in the world are
[1:18:03] you doing
[1:18:04] because he already knew that God had
[1:18:07] told him that the end would be okay
[1:18:10] see God had already told him I know the
[1:18:12] thoughts that I think towards you saith
[1:18:14] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:18:16] evil to give you an expected end so he
[1:18:18] said all this war is going to do is
[1:18:20] cause more people to die
[1:18:22] so he got put in jail as a traitor for
[1:18:25] doing that but God showed him after 70
[1:18:27] years they would come back again
[1:18:29] see the thoughts but it's not always
[1:18:31] revealed to us what the end will be
[1:18:34] right so it's many times we we try to
[1:18:36] control situations so much and not just
[1:18:38] with children but even in churches we we
[1:18:41] try to control everything that goes on
[1:18:43] and you can't do that
[1:18:45] you can't control you can't control your
[1:18:48] parents even
[1:18:50] what they want to do when they're doing
[1:18:53] things they shouldn't be doing you can't
[1:18:54] do that you've got to take your hands
[1:18:55] off sometimes
[1:18:58] but the Bible says we don't always know
[1:19:01] you know God works in mysterious ways
[1:19:03] his wonders to perform
[1:19:04] if we commit anything to God and believe
[1:19:07] it like our children or whatever more
[1:19:09] how many have committed your children to
[1:19:11] God even when they're young you got to
[1:19:12] commit them to God he said like our
[1:19:15] children or whatever more let's believe
[1:19:16] that God will answer that prayer
[1:19:19] hey man he said today before I left to
[1:19:21] go away the phone constantly ringing the
[1:19:24] mothers with their children saying now
[1:19:25] pray for them
[1:19:26] and I say now just commit them to God
[1:19:29] that's all you have to do don't put your
[1:19:32] hands on it anymore
[1:19:35] that's good advice isn't it don't put
[1:19:38] your hands on it anymore let God have it
[1:19:40] if you're going to do something about it
[1:19:42] then God will stand back and let you go
[1:19:45] ahead till you get finished
[1:19:48] he said well why has God moved in this
[1:19:51] situation or maybe it's because we got
[1:19:52] our hands on it
[1:19:54] and if we take our hands off of it then
[1:19:56] God would stand back and let you he said
[1:19:58] let you go ahead till you're finished
[1:19:59] but when you committed to God let him
[1:20:01] have it he will do it
[1:20:03] amen he said you just believe him just
[1:20:05] stand back and don't work
[1:20:07] but believe
[1:20:11] don't work
[1:20:13] and that's hard for people to comprehend
[1:20:15] because people want to know especially
[1:20:17] people who who like to fix things they
[1:20:19] want to fix situations they they want to
[1:20:21] make it good
[1:20:23] they want to put a Band-Aid on that on
[1:20:25] that on that spot
[1:20:27] you know that where the child got hurt
[1:20:29] or or the situation they want to put a
[1:20:31] Band-Aid on it but sometimes you got to
[1:20:33] let God heal it
[1:20:36] you committed to God let him have it
[1:20:38] he'll do it you just believe him just
[1:20:40] stand back and don't work but believe
[1:20:43] that's where Grace they said is imputed
[1:20:45] for righteousness to believe that God
[1:20:47] will how many believe he will tonight he
[1:20:50] will take care of my children he will
[1:20:52] take care of my family he will take care
[1:20:54] of the church he will take home I he
[1:20:57] will he'll be okay you don't have to
[1:20:59] keep your hands on it all the time
[1:21:02] take it off once in a while
[1:21:05] brother said that's the way it is of
[1:21:06] anything as long as you're going to do
[1:21:08] it if someone talks about you and you
[1:21:10] talk back about them God can't fight
[1:21:12] your battle you're fighting it yourself
[1:21:15] Just Let it Loose and let him do it just
[1:21:18] commit it to him that's why praise is
[1:21:19] such a powerful weapon what did Abraham
[1:21:21] say I'm in the basement I'm not praying
[1:21:23] anymore I'm praying I'm praising why am
[1:21:26] I praising praise is a powerful weapon
[1:21:28] because it's a sign of committal I've
[1:21:30] done everything I can do the doctors
[1:21:31] have done everything they can do now I'm
[1:21:33] going to praise God now I'm going to
[1:21:35] worship God now I'm going to believe God
[1:21:39] I'm going to worship Him in spite of the
[1:21:40] situation I'm going to worship him as if
[1:21:42] it's already done
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:47] Hallelujah just committed to him
[1:21:50] but the Branham said that he said that's
[1:21:52] the way it is just just let loose let
[1:21:53] him do it just commit it to him
[1:21:55] he said the greatest weapon that I know
[1:21:57] of a Christian today is committal to God
[1:22:00] do nothing about it just commit it to
[1:22:02] him and God will take care of it
[1:22:08] hopefully we could just believe that
[1:22:09] tonight
[1:22:11] now most mothers
[1:22:14] have to do that at 18 or 21 or
[1:22:16] 40.
[1:22:19] Joker bed had to do it at three months
[1:22:24] that's faith
[1:22:26] that's faith
[1:22:28] but she had confidence in two things
[1:22:29] number one the ark that they had made
[1:22:33] now God could have made an ark
[1:22:35] you know we've got lightning come down
[1:22:37] hollow out a tree and put him in the
[1:22:39] tree and then put him that's not what he
[1:22:40] did he had amaran make the ark
[1:22:44] he built the ark that's what the Bible
[1:22:46] says they built the ark
[1:22:48] they built the ark they weaved it
[1:22:50] together
[1:22:52] and I'm sure every time every they did a
[1:22:54] good job too
[1:22:55] because that's Mom and Dad making the
[1:22:57] ark that's not made of some Factory in
[1:22:59] China
[1:23:00] they're building the ark they're doing
[1:23:02] the very best I think we ought to do the
[1:23:03] very best we can for our children
[1:23:05] financially spiritually every other way
[1:23:07] we ought to do the best we can and yet
[1:23:09] realize once that Ark is built there's
[1:23:11] nothing more you can do you got to let
[1:23:13] them go
[1:23:14] but she had confidence in the ark and
[1:23:16] the and also the Providence of God
[1:23:19] that if they did all that they could do
[1:23:21] that God would do his part
[1:23:25] so brother Brandon says they go down to
[1:23:27] the river
[1:23:28] amram goes down to the river he's
[1:23:31] carrying the ark
[1:23:33] and she's carrying the baby
[1:23:35] and they go about daylight just before
[1:23:36] it gets light out where the the opening
[1:23:39] my witches you know they stayed up late
[1:23:40] at night they couldn't get up early in
[1:23:41] the morning so they've been out killing
[1:23:43] babies all night partying
[1:23:46] here come Abraham yoga bed this joke
[1:23:48] about this this Christian families we
[1:23:51] would say it today this Godly family and
[1:23:53] they're slipping down to the river early
[1:23:56] in the morning
[1:23:57] before he had to go to work and she had
[1:23:58] to go to work
[1:24:00] they went all they've got down to the
[1:24:01] river they slipped down where the Reeds
[1:24:03] would kind of cover things up
[1:24:06] slip down into the water
[1:24:08] he puts down the he puts down the ark he
[1:24:11] looks around he sees what looks like
[1:24:13] logs floating on the river no one I was
[1:24:15] at the now ever here not long ago they
[1:24:17] told me there's no more crocodiles
[1:24:18] because the pollution is so bad
[1:24:21] but in that day they had crocodiles and
[1:24:23] brother Brown said they'd gotten fat off
[1:24:24] of babies
[1:24:26] big old fat crocodiles just waiting on
[1:24:29] another baby to get thrown into the
[1:24:31] river gathered in the Nile River
[1:24:34] and at the same place where they threw
[1:24:36] the babies in maybe here they put an ark
[1:24:38] in
[1:24:40] and joking about I just can't do it I I
[1:24:42] can't put my baby down there I just
[1:24:44] can't let go I can't do it and they
[1:24:47] remember standing there yes dear you've
[1:24:48] got to you've got to if you keep him
[1:24:50] it'll be dangerous to him
[1:24:52] you imagine must have been some
[1:24:54] discussion in that home
[1:24:57] you got to let him go
[1:24:59] so she places him down as gently as she
[1:25:02] can make sure he's not crying not
[1:25:04] alerting anything She lays him down in
[1:25:05] the in the basket closes the lid of it
[1:25:08] brother said I had a little window in
[1:25:09] the top just like the ark did
[1:25:12] they laid it down there let some
[1:25:14] sunlight in let him be able to breathe
[1:25:16] and they laid that in close the lid and
[1:25:18] then they pushed it off
[1:25:21] they told their daughter because they
[1:25:22] had to go to work after doing that
[1:25:26] she told her daughter wait Miriam wait
[1:25:28] there and watch it
[1:25:30] see what happens to it
[1:25:32] it starts to float away
[1:25:34] it's a helpless feeling isn't it
[1:25:37] starts to float away down the river
[1:25:39] fat crocodiles start to swim up towards
[1:25:42] it
[1:25:44] they only get so closing
[1:25:46] kind of jump back
[1:25:49] big old crocodile's just about to oh my
[1:25:53] big old crocodile just about to grab a
[1:25:54] hold of it as they jump back why
[1:25:56] something was going on in heaven
[1:25:58] while this was going on on Earth
[1:26:00] something was going on in heaven
[1:26:02] brother Brown said what do you think is
[1:26:03] going on in heaven about this time
[1:26:05] he said you know when things goes on
[1:26:06] down here there's something going on up
[1:26:08] there too Jehovah called Gabriel over to
[1:26:11] watch the scene
[1:26:12] and he said look down there see those
[1:26:13] people putting that baby in the water he
[1:26:16] said I still got some people that trust
[1:26:17] me I can still got some people who know
[1:26:20] how to build an ark
[1:26:21] I've still got some people that know how
[1:26:23] to how to trust me that believe the
[1:26:25] promise of God their kids are going to
[1:26:27] be there
[1:26:28] I still got some people that believe me
[1:26:29] here they are putting them in the water
[1:26:31] let him go committing him to the water
[1:26:36] oh my
[1:26:37] God and the Father the Bible says
[1:26:38] walking into the water starts to push a
[1:26:40] little boat out
[1:26:41] I can hear the Lord say Gabriel yes Lord
[1:26:45] call Ten Thousand Angels to the scene
[1:26:48] see you couldn't see what was going on
[1:26:50] in heaven all you saw was what you did
[1:26:52] here on the Earth all you saw was having
[1:26:53] to let go and that was hard
[1:26:55] but you couldn't see what was going on
[1:26:57] in heaven dimmer that child has a future
[1:27:00] that child has a future oh my our
[1:27:03] children have a future
[1:27:05] they have a purpose
[1:27:08] and here in heaven in heaven Ten
[1:27:12] Thousand Angels stand at attention
[1:27:14] give them marching orders right away
[1:27:16] called the host of Heaven out send them
[1:27:18] all up and down along the banisters of
[1:27:20] Heaven put them all up and down the Nile
[1:27:22] he said I command that no crocodile will
[1:27:24] touch that cargo
[1:27:26] Hallelujah nothing will touch it don't
[1:27:28] even let a chunk of wood come near it
[1:27:31] Gabriel said it shall be done
[1:27:34] my sound of the trumpet Ten Thousand
[1:27:36] Angels come in arm
[1:27:37] the pilot where are you going to be Lord
[1:27:40] he said I'll be at the other end
[1:27:44] oh God
[1:27:46] imagine they put that thing in the water
[1:27:48] if they had disclosed to anyone what
[1:27:50] they had done
[1:27:51] you imagine what the others might have
[1:27:52] thought
[1:27:53] I put my baby in the water it didn't
[1:27:55] survive
[1:27:57] God cared why didn't he take care of
[1:27:59] mine but our children are special
[1:28:02] hear me Church our children are special
[1:28:04] they belong to the elect of God
[1:28:07] there may have been a million others
[1:28:09] went out and they did the same things
[1:28:10] your kids did with the same way your
[1:28:12] kids did and you thought well they'll go
[1:28:14] the same way and end the same way but
[1:28:16] their end will not be the same because
[1:28:18] there's Ten Thousand Angels guarding the
[1:28:20] river and there's there's a Christ at
[1:28:23] the end of it
[1:28:25] waiting he's always on the receiving end
[1:28:28] he said I'll wait down at the other end
[1:28:29] I got a purpose when people will trust
[1:28:31] me I have something of purpose it'll be
[1:28:34] all right
[1:28:35] it'll be all right oh could we could we
[1:28:37] grab a hold of that promise today it'll
[1:28:40] be all right when people trust me with
[1:28:41] their finances when they trust me with
[1:28:43] their health when they trust me with the
[1:28:45] church when they trust me with their
[1:28:46] children when they trust me with their
[1:28:48] marriage it'll be all right
[1:28:51] look like there's some crocodiles in the
[1:28:52] water but it'll be okay
[1:28:55] it'll be all right with them
[1:28:57] committed to God
[1:28:59] he'll take care of it
[1:29:02] musicians go ahead and come
[1:29:07] the great dilemma what do I do
[1:29:10] commit them to God
[1:29:12] build the ark
[1:29:14] do the very best you can build it
[1:29:17] go to church as often as you can go live
[1:29:20] for God as much as you can but someday
[1:29:21] you're gonna have to let that child go
[1:29:24] when you do
[1:29:25] know that there will be Ten Thousand
[1:29:27] Angels
[1:29:29] watching over that baby
[1:29:31] we do our part God will do his part
[1:29:33] and when we fail in our part
[1:29:36] God still does his part
[1:29:39] well that's the grace of God
[1:29:41] oh isn't he wonderful but let him have
[1:29:43] your dilemma whatever that dilemma is
