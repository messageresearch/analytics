[46:13] with that as well and there's biblical
[46:16] things about that that we can do to help

[46:19] to find the right one amen so I got all
[46:23] your attention tonight all the young
[46:25] people's attention and everybody's awake
[46:28] and ready to hear the word you ready
[46:30] hear the word tonight Genesis chapter 2
[46:32] verse 22 appreciate you sitting up front
[46:34] guys it means a lot to me Genesis 2:22
[46:37] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[46:40] from man made he a woman and brought her
[46:43] unto the man so she was part of him and
[46:47] he separated her from him and then
[46:49] brought her back to
[46:51] him and Adam said this is now bone of my
[46:54] bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[46:57] called woman because she was taken out
[47:00] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[47:03] father and his mother and shall cleave
[47:05] unto his wife they shall be one flesh I
[47:09] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[47:11] the reading of the word you may be
[47:13] seated a man named John Wesley had a
[47:16] famously unhappy
[47:18] marriage he uh met his wife Mary when he
[47:22] was taken to her house after spraining
[47:24] his ankle and uh somebody knews that she
[47:27] was a Believer and she lived nearby and
[47:28] so they they took uh him to her house
[47:31] and she cared for him nursed him back to
[47:33] health and he was so pleased with the
[47:35] way that she took care of him that he
[47:37] just thought it was the Lord he said
[47:39] this just Lord just put us together and
[47:41] and we're going to be happy and he was
[47:43] an older man at that time he wasn't real
[47:46] young should have known better he didn't
[47:48] ask nobody he just married her and his
[47:52] brother actually knew her and if he'd
[47:53] have asked it Charles would have told
[47:55] him that this woman had a temper
[47:58] problem and
[48:00] uh uh so he he was so uh pleased with
[48:06] the way she took care of him that she he
[48:07] just married her and he really thought
[48:09] it was the Lord and it may have been God
[48:11] God sure allowed it but if God wants us
[48:13] to be happy surely John Wesley did that
[48:16] to himself you know CU he was not happy
[48:19] in that marriage in fact that famously
[48:21] she drugg him around the house by by his
[48:25] head by his hair
[48:27] and he had a little bit longer hair and
[48:29] she took him and Drug him around the
[48:30] house so you don't want a marriage like
[48:31] that at all but it just proves that good
[48:34] men Godly men can make mistakes in that
[48:37] and and women as well and and we need to
[48:40] make sure we find the right one and we
[48:41] talked last time we talked about this I
[48:43] talked to young people
[48:45] about about uh how we date and court or
[48:48] whatever you want to call it and
[48:50] everything that we do like that but I
[48:52] don't want to deal with that so much
[48:53] this time I want to deal with who who
[48:56] who we find mind because that's much
[48:58] more important than how and brother
[49:01] brand deals with that a whole lot more
[49:02] and the Bible deals with that a lot more
[49:04] than than how deals with who because you
[49:07] might be able to overcome a mistake when
[49:09] it comes to dating or courting but you
[49:11] will not overcome a mistake when it
[49:13] comes to marrying the wrong one it's a
[49:16] knot that can only be untied in another
[49:18] world or in the Millennium it can't be
[49:21] untied here once it's done it's done so
[49:24] it's a very important thing we don't
[49:26] believe in
[49:27] divorce we we just don't believe in it
[49:30] and so we we believe that if God puts
[49:31] you together you stay together you work
[49:33] that out and that doesn't mean it's the
[49:35] unpardonable sin but we just don't even
[49:37] present that as an option right right we
[49:40] don't present that as an option we want
[49:41] you to stay married so in Matthew
[49:44] chapter 19 and
[49:45] verse3 uh Jesus talks about that he said
[49:48] the Pharisees came to him tempting him
[49:49] and said to him is it lawful for a man
[49:52] to put away his wife for every cause and
[49:55] uh cuz they had made it where it was
[49:56] lawful if she burned your dinner you
[49:58] could put her
[49:59] away and Jesus said no he said he
[50:02] answered have you not read that he which
[50:03] made them at the beginning made them
[50:05] male and female and said for this cause
[50:07] shall a man leave father and mother and
[50:09] shall cleave to his wife and they twain
[50:11] shall be one flesh you can't put away
[50:14] your flesh your own bones you can't do
[50:17] that if you were one you can't put that
[50:19] away he said wherefore there are no more
[50:21] Twain but one flesh what therefore God
[50:24] hath joined together let not man put us
[50:27] under so what God puts together don't
[50:29] let any man separate that so what does
[50:33] God join together I believe if you're
[50:35] married you should believe like Wesley
[50:37] that God has put you with your current
[50:40] spouse right and I mean that's you say
[50:43] well you know I can't believe God put me
[50:45] with my current spouse because she's
[50:47] hard on me but the BR said don't turn
[50:48] down your spouse because she's got a
[50:49] temper it's actually a direct quote he
[50:52] said maybe God put you together God put
[50:54] Moses and his wife together and you know
[50:57] and excuse me for the plain language but
[50:59] we're not dealing with The Village Idiot
[51:02] we're talking about
[51:03] God right sometimes you got to be
[51:05] playing with the the young people so you
[51:07] understand it but we're not we're
[51:08] talking about God God knows what he's
[51:10] doing right he's able to put you at the
[51:12] right one so I've always told married
[51:14] people say well am I married to the
[51:15] right one absolutely why would you
[51:17] believe anything else right work on what
[51:20] you got try to look at somebody else
[51:23] work on the marriage that you have but
[51:25] if you're if you're unmarried if you've
[51:27] made no vows your spouse could be anyone
[51:31] anywhere of the opposite
[51:34] sex when I put that in there I thought I
[51:36] don't have to say that yeah we
[51:40] do it's a stupid
[51:43] world it really is but you're not going
[51:46] to marry if you're a man you don't get
[51:48] to marry a man that's not marriage they
[51:51] they they'll give you a license today
[51:52] because people are
[51:54] insane but that's not marriage
[51:57] yeah right and and so it could be anyone
[52:00] anywhere and and we find Isaac and
[52:03] Rebecca like they didn't know each other
[52:05] but they were meant for one another
[52:07] there aren't many low stories in the
[52:09] Bible as far as how they met and things
[52:12] like that but Isaac and Rebecca is the
[52:13] exception to that it tells us all about
[52:16] it so we have characters in the story we
[52:19] have Abraham Isaac the servant The
[52:22] Trusted servant who elaser you know who
[52:25] he is but he's not named in the story
[52:28] Rebecca uh bethu who was Rebecca's
[52:31] father uh because if you get married you
[52:33] marry the whole
[52:35] family so we know uh Rebecca's mother
[52:38] was there it talks about her mother but
[52:39] she's unnamed and and then her brother
[52:43] nahor her brother and the story opens
[52:46] with Abraham's concern for his son to
[52:50] find a proper wife and we know that
[52:52] Isaac at this point you know he it's
[52:54] about time for him to get out of the
[52:55] house he's 40 years
[52:58] old so some of y'all got time yet you
[53:01] know to get married most of our our
[53:04] young people are young real young so
[53:06] you're not even at this point but I want
[53:07] you to be thinking about it and and
[53:10] preparing for it when's the time to
[53:11] start preparing now get ready and
[53:14] because one day he will come and he'll
[53:16] come before you know it so uh here
[53:19] Abraham's ready for Isaac to get out of
[53:22] the
[53:23] house and uh he's ready for him to get
[53:26] out of his basement you know and and
[53:28] move on with his life so he says Isaac
[53:31] needs a wife so he's interested in that
[53:34] and I'll say to us parents we didn't
[53:35] take an interest in our
[53:37] children right and and their lives to
[53:39] make sure that we're promoting the best
[53:41] interest of our children so and we know
[53:44] that Isaac in in that Society Isaac
[53:46] wouldn't have taken part in decisions
[53:48] affecting the household until he got
[53:50] married so in order for him to inherit
[53:53] he had to get married that's why elaser
[53:55] is still in charge of of everything
[53:56] Abraham has even though Isaac is 40
[53:59] years old because he had to get married
[54:01] in order to take on the the headship in
[54:03] the home and so and Abraham knows he's
[54:06] fixing to pass away he's getting old and
[54:08] so he said it's time for some grandkids
[54:09] you know and we got to keep this line
[54:11] going so and he sends him out now the
[54:15] first point I want to make to you if
[54:16] you're making notes or want to write it
[54:18] down you can write this down the right
[54:21] one is a
[54:23] believer I'm not going to spend a lot of
[54:24] time on this cuz we've talked about it
[54:26] before poor but the right one is a
[54:28] Believer look what Abraham tells elzer
[54:30] the servant he he said I will make thee
[54:33] swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and
[54:35] the god of the earth that thou shalt not
[54:36] take a wife un my son of the daughters
[54:39] of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but
[54:41] Thou shalt go into my country to my
[54:43] Kindred and take a wife into my son
[54:45] Isaac but the brandom tells us that no
[54:47] believer should ever marry an unbeliever
[54:49] under no circumstances you should always
[54:51] marry Believers now you might say well I
[54:54] met this girl and and oh my uh you know
[54:58] like John Wesley boy she she's just so
[55:00] nice and so wonderful and she just uh
[55:04] you know her eyes are so pretty and her
[55:06] hair is so pretty and and maybe she's
[55:08] not a Believer you say well how you know
[55:11] I just fell in love with her that's fine
[55:12] it's wonderful you say Stars shot off
[55:15] and fireworks and love it first sight
[55:18] and it's just wonderful okay invite her
[55:21] to
[55:22] church invite him to church don't date
[55:25] him don't go out with him or her until
[55:27] they're a Believer until you know that
[55:29] they come and they didn't just come for
[55:31] you yeah right because that could happen
[55:35] because if they don't have a habit of
[55:36] going to church and don't know anything
[55:37] about what you believe and and you get
[55:39] married then all of a sudden things uh
[55:42] everything's a problem so do that you
[55:43] say well sometimes it works out
[55:45] absolutely it does thank God for Grace
[55:48] thank God for grace that it does work
[55:50] out sometimes but the rule is marry a
[55:52] Believer yes right that's what we're
[55:55] supposed to do because
[55:56] Paul says be not unequally yolked
[55:58] together with unbelievers for what
[55:59] Fellowship hath righteousness with
[56:00] unrighteousness what communion light
[56:03] with Darkness not everybody that goes to
[56:04] church is a
[56:05] Believer right marry somebody like you
[56:08] and I want to get a little bit into that
[56:09] because a church is a good spot to find
[56:12] a spouse so he tells he tells uh uh he
[56:15] tells elther you're going to have to
[56:17] take a trip right to go and find this
[56:20] this woman who who will be like Isaac
[56:22] who will think like him who'll be a part
[56:24] of my family but just because they go to
[56:26] church doesn't make them a Believer
[56:29] right what what what are their goals
[56:30] what do they want out of life what are
[56:32] they filled with the Holy Ghost do they
[56:33] love the Lord or are they just in church
[56:36] are they in church because they have a
[56:38] drug problem and their parents drug them
[56:40] to church or are they in church because
[56:42] they want to be in the house of God what
[56:44] what what do they want out of life Isaac
[56:46] wasn't just anybody he he was a sourer
[56:49] with Abraham looking for a city right he
[56:52] wasn't just another guy he was special I
[56:55] want to tell you young people well
[56:56] you're special and that's why it matters
[56:58] who you marry because you're special
[57:01] you're going to bring on that next
[57:02] Generation if there is one and so you
[57:05] didn't come up in just any household you
[57:07] come up in a Abraham Faith household you
[57:09] come you come up as a Seed of Abraham
[57:12] and so you you don't want to just marry
[57:14] any kind of person you want to look at
[57:17] what does this person share my vision
[57:19] for
[57:20] life right do they are they somebody who
[57:24] uh who wants to go to church and wants
[57:26] to live for God and so you want to deal
[57:28] with that you don't find that out after
[57:30] you get married or after you get engaged
[57:33] find that out before find out what kind
[57:36] of person that is so and you know if
[57:39] you're a person that goes to church
[57:40] every time the doors open and you marry
[57:42] somebody who's comes to church when they
[57:44] feel like it there's going to be a
[57:46] conflict there yes right if you take the
[57:49] message seriously you marry somebody who
[57:52] also takes it seriously it's not the
[57:55] time a marriage is not the place you
[57:56] want to fix people and help people
[57:58] marriage is not the place to do that
[58:01] right find somebody who's stronger than
[58:02] you and or or at least as strong as you
[58:05] are in those things because you're going
[58:07] to find out there's going to be times
[58:08] you're going to have to drag them to
[58:09] church and they're going to have to drag
[58:11] you to church and there's going to be
[58:12] times you have to do that so so do that
[58:14] yeah marry somebody like that it's not
[58:17] the time to try to fix somebody say well
[58:19] they got a problem and if I married them
[58:20] they'd be better off don't do that
[58:23] because you find out most of the time
[58:25] what'll happen is they'll drag you down
[58:27] you won't help them they just makes you
[58:29] weaker instead of you coming together
[58:31] and making each other
[58:33] stronger we'll get off of that what else
[58:36] can we learn from Isaac and Rebecca that
[58:38] we learn that the right one is approved
[58:41] by Godly
[58:42] Parents I'm gonna get in a sticky
[58:44] situation here but just bear with me I
[58:48] put Godly as a modifier there on
[58:50] purpose because parents aren't always
[58:54] Godly and as parents and we need to be
[58:56] careful who we
[58:57] disapprove and who we approve we need to
[59:00] our kids do have to make their own
[59:02] decision right but we do need to be
[59:04] careful that we uh if we're Godly
[59:07] Parents we're going to we're going to
[59:09] approve somebody because of the word
[59:11] we're going to give advice based on the
[59:13] word not just based on whether this
[59:16] person is going to be a millionaire or
[59:17] not you know and uh CU we don't know
[59:21] that many times anyway we don't find our
[59:24] children's spouses just not the way it's
[59:25] done to day boy I wish it was you know
[59:27] you just go out there
[59:28] and you know send my servant out and
[59:32] we're going to go find a spouse when
[59:34] they're 40 years old you know I wish
[59:36] don't you wish it work like that but
[59:37] Logan just just figured to send them out
[59:39] and do that but we don't do that anymore
[59:41] they have to make a decision but we
[59:43] should give counsel and listen to me
[59:45] young people if you're smart how many
[59:47] smart young people do we have here boy I
[59:50] saw you raise your hand look at that all
[59:52] right yeah it's all right got some smart
[59:54] young people smart dress Young young
[59:56] people up here in the front row hey if
[59:58] you're smart you will listen to your
[1:00:02] parents
[1:00:05] right it's true if you're smart come on
[1:00:08] some of you Elders help me out if you're
[1:00:10] smart you'll listen to your parents and
[1:00:12] all of us sitting there saying wish we'
[1:00:13] to listen to our parents you
[1:00:15] know but that's part of you know as as
[1:00:18] you got to realize if you're smart that
[1:00:20] your parents could know something you
[1:00:23] don't know and they can't make a
[1:00:25] decision for you but they can help you
[1:00:28] they can help you and they want to help
[1:00:30] you they're not in it listen they
[1:00:33] didn't you're not just another something
[1:00:35] they own you you're their life and and
[1:00:39] they don't just pay the bills for you
[1:00:40] for no reason there's a reason why they
[1:00:42] haven't kicked you out of the house yet
[1:00:44] cuz they love you and they care about
[1:00:46] you and so listen to
[1:00:48] them and again there will be times where
[1:00:51] you there will be times in your life
[1:00:52] where you feel like they're they're
[1:00:54] wrong boy if I had a dollar for every
[1:00:57] time I thought my dad was wrong you know
[1:00:59] and sometimes he was yeah many times he
[1:01:02] was but I still had to listen yeah you
[1:01:04] still need to listen because chances are
[1:01:07] he's going to find something going to
[1:01:08] have something that he knows and and
[1:01:11] there were things that he said that were
[1:01:13] true that happened and and I and I wish
[1:01:15] I had have listen to some things not
[1:01:16] many but some things but if you got
[1:01:19] Godly Parents listen to your
[1:01:22] parents now as a
[1:01:24] parent if if your kid won't listen to
[1:01:27] you just will not listen to you we need
[1:01:29] to examine ourselves sometimes right and
[1:01:32] say is there a reason for
[1:01:34] that right because as Abraham as
[1:01:37] Abraham's seed we got to lead our
[1:01:39] children right we want to do that how
[1:01:41] many parents want to lead their children
[1:01:42] right and and so we want to do like
[1:01:45] Abraham has sent and and and find help
[1:01:47] them find the right spouse and help them
[1:01:49] in their schoolwork and help them in
[1:01:51] their life and help them guide them
[1:01:53] towards the right kind of a job or
[1:01:54] something like that but you've got to
[1:01:56] got them towards the right kind of a
[1:01:58] church and the right kind of belief and
[1:01:59] all of those things but if they just
[1:02:01] will not listen to us they just won't
[1:02:02] listen to nothing we say it could be a
[1:02:04] rebellious Spirit but it could be that
[1:02:07] we
[1:02:08] just we're maybe we're not living
[1:02:11] exactly what we're talking
[1:02:13] about and nobody knows that better than
[1:02:16] kids all right right so if the kids
[1:02:18] won't listen to you way is there a
[1:02:19] reason and it may not be but always
[1:02:21] examine
[1:02:23] yourself H we need somebody who will do
[1:02:25] that lead your children right brother
[1:02:27] brand says this about he said keep them
[1:02:29] in Christian company as long as you
[1:02:32] possibly can if it's a girl keep her
[1:02:35] with Christian girls Christian boys vice
[1:02:37] versa if she's old enough to go with a
[1:02:39] boy see that she keeps with the right
[1:02:41] kind of a boy discourage her to any boy
[1:02:44] otherwise look at the language he uses
[1:02:46] discourage her so many times we want to
[1:02:48] stand up here and be a dictator but what
[1:02:50] you got is a budding adult they're not
[1:02:52] adults yet their brain's not even fully
[1:02:53] developed right but you're not going to
[1:02:55] be able to just dictate to them
[1:02:57] especially when they get to be 16 17
[1:02:58] years old you're just not going to be
[1:03:00] able to stand there and say thus saith
[1:03:02] the parent they're just not going to
[1:03:04] listen to you all the
[1:03:06] time right and so what do you do at that
[1:03:10] point you have to have built enough
[1:03:12] influence that they want to listen to
[1:03:14] you that if there's a Christian in the
[1:03:17] world my parents a Christian my dad's a
[1:03:19] Christian now they have an obligation to
[1:03:21] Listen by the word let me say this the
[1:03:23] worst way to get respect is to command
[1:03:25] it
[1:03:27] D I'm just going to give you respect
[1:03:29] just cuz you said so that's what we want
[1:03:32] to do cuz I said so all right right but
[1:03:34] there needs to be something backing that
[1:03:36] up a life remember
[1:03:38] demons I know we don't think of our
[1:03:40] children as demons but demons don't even
[1:03:43] leave just cuz you said
[1:03:45] so do you know that remember the seven
[1:03:48] sons of ska they went down there and and
[1:03:50] they said we're we cast you out in the
[1:03:52] name of Paul you know and in the name of
[1:03:55] the Jesus Paul preaches they said we
[1:03:57] don't even know who you
[1:03:59] are huh they tore them all up and sent
[1:04:03] them back
[1:04:04] crying but and you remember the
[1:04:05] disciples when went on to heal the the
[1:04:07] case of epilepsy they couldn't heal the
[1:04:09] boy and here uh here comes uh uh here
[1:04:13] come or the dog the the girl and here
[1:04:15] comes Jesus but man said he he said that
[1:04:17] demon knew the
[1:04:19] life right that Jesus lived and because
[1:04:22] he saw that life he said he when he saw
[1:04:25] that he said that's what caused him to
[1:04:26] leave when he commanded it and so how do
[1:04:29] we expect if a demon won't even leave
[1:04:31] based on just you telling them to
[1:04:33] without they being a life to back it up
[1:04:35] what about our children yeah they're not
[1:04:37] going to just listen to you because
[1:04:39] because of who you are you got to have
[1:04:40] something to back that up maybe that's
[1:04:42] not the best analogy
[1:04:45] but brother B said discourage her look
[1:04:48] at that language discourage her to any
[1:04:50] boy otherwise her boy to a girl she's
[1:04:52] going with an unbeliever try to
[1:04:53] encourage her to go with a Believer and
[1:04:55] vice versa
[1:04:56] make your home
[1:05:00] nice make your home nice make your home
[1:05:04] a place where your daughter or son will
[1:05:07] not be ashamed to bring their company
[1:05:10] before their father and mother and into
[1:05:13] their house and make homes so happy that
[1:05:17] they'll be pleased in their home to stay
[1:05:21] there that's a challenge to us parents
[1:05:24] you want your kids to listen to you let
[1:05:27] them have a home some place they can go
[1:05:29] to because it's not enough just to say
[1:05:31] go beat your head against the wall and
[1:05:32] sit in your room and stay on your phone
[1:05:35] no there's got to be some place that
[1:05:36] they enjoy being and I think that ought
[1:05:38] to be our
[1:05:39] house and and if they're under 18 and
[1:05:42] under our roof we have veto power over
[1:05:44] who they choose to hang out with we do
[1:05:48] but we use wisdom with that right guide
[1:05:50] them the right direction uh you find
[1:05:53] that in the story of Rebecca brandham
[1:05:54] nearing 18 years old as she gets close
[1:05:56] to 18 brother Brandon realizes he got to
[1:05:58] take his hands off and pray and deal
[1:06:01] with this in a spiritual way now because
[1:06:02] she's getting old enough that she's
[1:06:04] going to leave
[1:06:05] anyway right so so and listen to me
[1:06:09] listen to me I've seen this over the
[1:06:10] years I've watched churches where people
[1:06:13] and I'm not putting that off on any of
[1:06:14] our churches here but watch churches
[1:06:16] where people every kid as soon as they
[1:06:18] turn 18 they go out in the world every
[1:06:20] one of them there's a reason for that
[1:06:22] yeah there's a reason for that homes
[1:06:24] aren't nice
[1:06:26] Church isn't
[1:06:27] nice brother Ivy told us years ago he
[1:06:30] said you know he said they make it where
[1:06:32] the kids are uh they said uh go get out
[1:06:36] of sight and out of mind he said and as
[1:06:38] soon as they got old enough to leave
[1:06:39] they left if you don't care about them
[1:06:41] show you show them you care about them
[1:06:43] they will
[1:06:44] leave so you got to use wisdom with that
[1:06:46] but listen young people listen to your
[1:06:49] parents look what proverb says about a
[1:06:53] son listening to his father and mother
[1:06:55] said my son keep thy father's
[1:06:57] commandment forsake not the law of thy
[1:07:00] mother bind them continually upon thine
[1:07:03] heart tie them about thy neck s of a
[1:07:06] neck tie you put on your Commandments
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:09] know what your mother and father have
[1:07:11] taught you yes when thou goest it shall
[1:07:14] lead thee when thou sleepest it shall
[1:07:17] keep thee listen parents don't get
[1:07:19] discouraged all the things that you said
[1:07:21] and the things you stood for over the
[1:07:22] years one day it's going to come around
[1:07:24] and they're going to remember what you
[1:07:25] taught them they may leave for a while
[1:07:27] but the Bible said if you train them up
[1:07:29] in the way they should go when they are
[1:07:31] old they will not depart from
[1:07:33] it that's a promise he said when it go
[1:07:37] when th goest it shall lead thee when
[1:07:38] thou sleepest it shall keep thee when
[1:07:40] thou wakest it shall talk with thee you
[1:07:41] always have that voice in your head you
[1:07:44] think well when I leave home I'll get
[1:07:45] away from that no it'll always be there
[1:07:48] why because your parents were teaching
[1:07:49] you the
[1:07:50] truth the Commandment is a lamp and the
[1:07:52] law is light proofer instruction of the
[1:07:55] way of life to keep thee from the evil
[1:07:58] woman from the flattery of the tongue of
[1:08:00] a strange
[1:08:02] woman there's evil people out
[1:08:05] there evil men and women are everywhere
[1:08:07] get all the advice you
[1:08:09] can yeah in Proverbs 625 he goes on to
[1:08:12] say lust not after her beauty in thine
[1:08:14] art in thy heart neither let her take
[1:08:17] thee with her
[1:08:21] eyelids that's why they color their
[1:08:23] eyelid you know B their eyes at you
[1:08:27] huh try they put that stuff brother man
[1:08:31] called it Gang
[1:08:33] Green put that over their eyelids and
[1:08:35] bat their eyes you know what's the
[1:08:37] reason we don't do that yeah right the
[1:08:40] Bible says a bad woman will do that an
[1:08:42] evil woman yes right and you you get
[1:08:44] your eyes you know Woman Like That B
[1:08:46] their eyes at you and think oh my that's
[1:08:49] my future what spouse what that is is
[1:08:52] the
[1:08:53] devil maybe not her but but the what the
[1:08:56] spirit that's behind
[1:08:57] her right and it says the adulterous
[1:09:00] will hunt for the precious
[1:09:03] life oh
[1:09:05] my uh so you need to take Godly Parents
[1:09:07] advice I know it's slow tonight but I
[1:09:09] just got to do this I got to get through
[1:09:10] it so just hang with me take a pastor's
[1:09:12] advice and this is sticky because I have
[1:09:15] no control over who anyone in this
[1:09:17] church courts or marries and I don't
[1:09:18] want that kind of obligation or
[1:09:22] responsibility but I will tell you what
[1:09:24] I think if you ask yeah yeah and it'd be
[1:09:27] good if we'd ask you say why do you do
[1:09:30] that I've been told I don't have a right
[1:09:32] to do that why do you do that well
[1:09:33] brother brandom did it set that example
[1:09:35] yeah the Bible sets that example for
[1:09:37] ministers do you know that brother
[1:09:39] brandom said not long ago there was a
[1:09:41] little girl back there at the Tabernacle
[1:09:42] my church she was a sweet little old
[1:09:44] girl little Christian girl she was
[1:09:46] running around with some little old boy
[1:09:48] who packed a flask in his pocket and
[1:09:49] smoked cigarettes he said I couldn't see
[1:09:52] nothing in the boy myself tried for two
[1:09:54] or three years to get him to be a
[1:09:55] Christian but he wouldn't do it and I
[1:09:58] asked her I said sis what do you see in
[1:09:59] that boy you know what kind of answer
[1:10:02] she give me said like some of these
[1:10:04] Bobby sock kids today she said brother
[1:10:06] brandom said he just got such cute

[1:10:18] good he's so cute I hear that my girls
[1:10:21] all the time they're so cute well that's
[1:10:24] not a reason to get
[1:10:27] married young people say

[1:10:35] smells good cuz he went down and bought
[1:10:37] out the the cologne the cheap cologne
[1:10:39] aisle on at Walmart he won't smell good
[1:10:43] for
[1:10:45] long except for trip trip where's really
[1:10:47] good cologne I wish I could afford
[1:10:52] it now he said brother I thought what a
[1:10:55] to pick a husband and I said you say
[1:10:59] well Pastor you out of line when you say
[1:11:00] anything about who we're going to marry
[1:11:01] brother BR said it I said I'd rather
[1:11:04] marry a man that was a Christian had
[1:11:05] feet like a box
[1:11:08] car smelled like a pole cat if he was a
[1:11:12] Christian yes you want the right one the
[1:11:15] right one's a Christian
[1:11:17] yes by the blood of he said by the blood

[1:11:22] said hallelujah what a what a what a
[1:11:24] something drop in right here at the end
[1:11:26] he will make a living for you and be a
[1:11:28] gentleman if he's
[1:11:31] saved come on young people you girls
[1:11:34] going to look for somebody and say well
[1:11:36] you know so and so's got cute
[1:11:40] feet huh if he's
[1:11:43] saved huh he may not have cute feet but
[1:11:46] if he's saved he'll make a living for
[1:11:48] you yes yeah if you don't have a job you
[1:11:51] got no
[1:11:53] business looking for a wife until he
[1:11:55] looks for a
[1:11:57] job I'm telling you the truth speaking
[1:11:59] to my kids my kids are some of the
[1:12:01] oldest young people so y'all hear me you
[1:12:03] don't have any business getting engaged
[1:12:05] to a girl unless you got a job it
[1:12:07] doesn't have to be a great job well when
[1:12:10] we we got engaged my wife and I got
[1:12:11] engaged I worked at Burger
[1:12:14] King but I
[1:12:17] worked huh you don't have to be a great
[1:12:19] job might be a lot of money but I worked
[1:12:22] my wife's never never worked in the
[1:12:24] workplace and I say that not to brag but
[1:12:26] God's always provided for us now by the
[1:12:28] time I got married I had to get serious
[1:12:30] and I had a had three jobs I was
[1:12:32] preaching full time and and we end up
[1:12:35] pastoring a church at branville so I
[1:12:37] preach full-time and I the bill
[1:12:39] remembers those days and also worked at
[1:12:42] a title company during the week and I
[1:12:43] worked at Burger King on Saturdays so I
[1:12:46] was working I was working three jobs
[1:12:48] because I knew I had to provide for my
[1:12:49] wife I just I never questioned that yeah
[1:12:52] and you young people did excuse me for
[1:12:53] being on a tantrum but
[1:12:56] young men question that like well you
[1:12:58] know if we split everything up and we
[1:12:59] all go down to bills come on young man
[1:13:02] be a man come on right you you got to
[1:13:05] you you have to be a man I'm turning
[1:13:07] into by the window up here
[1:13:10] but be a man and pay the
[1:13:13] bills and it's nothing wrong with a wife
[1:13:15] helping if she needs to help brother
[1:13:17] brandom taught us that there's nothing
[1:13:19] wrong with a wife helping if she needs
[1:13:21] to help but it the right the way it
[1:13:23] ought to be is our wives wouldn't have
[1:13:24] to to
[1:13:25] work right because the man provides so
[1:13:28] well marry a provider brother says if
[1:13:30] he's a Christian brother made a link
[1:13:32] between that why because the word says
[1:13:34] if you won't provide for your own you're
[1:13:35] worse than an Infidel and I've come down
[1:13:38] kind of hard on that but some of our and
[1:13:39] I'm proud of our young men I get tithes
[1:13:42] from our young men that work 16 17 years
[1:13:45] old you I salute you for that young men
[1:13:47] doing all you can to find a job and
[1:13:49] right now it's really difficult to find
[1:13:50] a job but make sure you're stable in
[1:13:53] that before you get married or propose
[1:13:54] to somebody
[1:13:58] so now you're going to take care of if
[1:14:00] you're saved and you'll be a
[1:14:03] gentleman again brother Brown said some
[1:14:06] little old girl he's telling the same
[1:14:07] story tells it a little bit different
[1:14:08] way he said started going with some
[1:14:09] little old
[1:14:11] shrimp I've met some of them
[1:14:16] shrimps I met them shrimps haven't I
[1:14:19] yesterday I met them little
[1:14:22] shrimps some little shrimp downtown here

[1:14:30] that boy he wouldn't come to church he'd
[1:14:33] sit out here put her in the church out
[1:14:34] here and he'd sit out there on the
[1:14:35] outside in his car and wait wouldn't

[1:17:48] for you but teach your children the
[1:17:51] truth and and you'll find them all broke

[1:17:55] didn't listen to Somebody God help us to
[1:17:57] listen help us to have a a a repentant
[1:17:59] heart listen to Young People I love it
[1:18:01] when you come to the Altar and and and
[1:18:03] seek for the Lord because it tells me
[1:18:04] there's softness there and as as older
[1:18:06] people we don't need to ever discourage
[1:18:08] that we don't need to ever discourage
[1:18:10] that some of us need to be in the altar
[1:18:12] sometimes well we don't need that
[1:18:13] anymore you needed it when you were
[1:18:15] young and you probably need it
[1:18:20] today we need to be soft we need to we
[1:18:23] need to be we need to something needs to
[1:18:24] prick our hearts once in a
[1:18:27] while don't ever get away from that good
[1:18:30] you keep on doing it and brother brand
[1:18:33] says marriage is Honorable it should be
[1:18:35] entered prayerfully and reverently in
[1:18:36] genuine love for that woman he said
[1:18:38] we'll bind you together forever when you
[1:18:41] bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven when
[1:18:43] you walk down the street Yonder she may
[1:18:44] get old and gray and wrinkled but that
[1:18:46] same love you had for her when she was a
[1:18:48] young beautiful woman you'll still have
[1:18:51] it you may get stoop shouldered
[1:18:53] baldheaded my wife didn't think it

[1:19:07] time when you've crossed the river
[1:19:09] Yonder when you'll spring back again to
[1:19:10] young men and women to live together
[1:19:12] forever he said that's God's Eternal
[1:19:15] promise listen to me I I got to hit this
[1:19:18] because you'll hear it out there say
[1:19:19] well a pastor has no business giving
[1:19:20] advice to a young couple if a pastor can
[1:19:23] advise you on the most important
[1:19:24] decision ever make what is his job
[1:19:26] exactly yeah
[1:19:29] right second Timothy 4:2 says preach the
[1:19:32] word be instant in season not all the
[1:19:33] preaching we do is in the Pulpit right
[1:19:36] out of season but but trip and brother
[1:19:38] sister Esther and brother Peter and all
[1:19:40] of you young people know that if you've
[1:19:41] been in my house much you know I'll
[1:19:44] preach to them sometimes and why because
[1:19:46] I'm trying to lead them in the right
[1:19:48] direction I want to see them I want to
[1:19:49] see them grow up and be be strong young
[1:19:51] men and women and people that serve God
[1:19:54] and love God I don't want to see one of
[1:19:55] them lost I got a a conviction in my
[1:19:58] heart that we're not going to lose
[1:19:59] another generation of young people come
[1:20:01] on Church let's let's not just let it go
[1:20:04] let's let's let them see God in us and
[1:20:06] do what it takes to see them make it we
[1:20:09] don't have time it's too late to be
[1:20:11] losing another generation let's see them
[1:20:14] Reach that age and and continue on with
[1:20:16] the Lord put some take some interest in
[1:20:18] their
[1:20:19] life amen again he told tells the pastor
[1:20:24] that we exort you Brethren warn them
[1:20:25] that are unruly that's not a pastor's
[1:20:28] job what is yeah Comfort the feeble
[1:20:30] minded support the weak be patient
[1:20:32] toward all men that's part of it being
[1:20:34] patient as well this is our job brother
[1:20:36] BR said so many people were asking me
[1:20:38] questions about marriage and divorce and
[1:20:39] so forth he said which is a tangle in
[1:20:41] the church he said always refer them
[1:20:43] back say ask your pastor people wrote me
[1:20:46] letters here and say what about this
[1:20:48] what about that refer the letter back
[1:20:50] you'll get it see your pastor on little
[1:20:51] things because after all he's your
[1:20:53] Shepherd he's the one God God sent to
[1:20:55] watch over you again not a dictator
[1:20:57] right you don't have to take the advice
[1:20:59] but at least
[1:21:01] ask you might know something you don't
[1:21:03] about that
[1:21:04] person and it don't mean you won't
[1:21:06] disagree with him you couldn't be wrong
[1:21:08] he's human he don't have any Authority
[1:21:10] in those things that no legal Authority
[1:21:12] tell you what to do but he's equipped to
[1:21:14] tell you the truth right brother B said
[1:21:16] so I'd rather your pastor tell about
[1:21:18] marriage and divorce and these things
[1:21:19] and things let him do it he said he's
[1:21:21] God's servant too and he's equipped to
[1:21:22] do that right he said well my pastor's
[1:21:25] not equipped to do that well i' find
[1:21:27] somebody
[1:21:28] else right I'm saying that about me and
[1:21:30] to my to those that go to church here
[1:21:33] right if your pastor's not equipped to
[1:21:34] help you in those those things then he's
[1:21:36] not equipped at
[1:21:38] all number three we won't may not have
[1:21:40] time to get through all these tonight
[1:21:41] but we'll just we'll just are you doing
[1:21:43] okay young people still
[1:21:48] breathing they tell me when you get all
[1:21:50] excited and stressed out you should do
[1:21:51] that you know breathe in
[1:21:56] it's all right you can breathe
[1:22:00] Esther the right one will be found
[1:22:02] through prayer yes how many of you that
[1:22:05] are married know that that's the truth
[1:22:07] find the right one through prayer you
[1:22:09] remember El eer got down he got
[1:22:11] desperate with God he said oh Lord God
[1:22:13] of my master Abraham I pray you send me
[1:22:14] good speed this day show kindness unto
[1:22:17] my master Abraham the BR says you better
[1:22:19] pray hard before you marry that girl I
[1:22:21] don't care how pretty she is same thing
[1:22:24] to to a man again he said there was many
[1:22:26] women in that City speaking of the city
[1:22:28] where Rebecca was young girls for him to
[1:22:31] choose from but he didn't take his own
[1:22:33] choice he trusted God's choice he took
[1:22:36] the one that had a supernatural sign a
[1:22:40] answer to prayer submitted to the Lord
[1:22:44] Genesis 24:15 the Bible says that when
[1:22:47] he prayed I love how God works it came
[1:22:49] to pass before he had done speaking
[1:22:52] behold Rebecca came out who was born
[1:22:54] Beth son of milka the wife of nahor
[1:22:56] Abraham's brother with her picture upon
[1:22:59] her shoulder God answered his prayer
[1:23:01] while he was still praying it what do I
[1:23:03] what does that tell us keep praying
[1:23:05] until the prayer is answered yes we
[1:23:08] should pray about that if we pray about
[1:23:09] anything we ought to pray about
[1:23:11] this he said if we would study what
[1:23:14] we're doing when we're going to get
[1:23:15] married when we choose our wife our
[1:23:16] husband if we'd study it over a man
[1:23:18] should pray earnestly for he could ruin
[1:23:21] his entire
[1:23:22] life right and then not just cuz she a
[1:23:24] bad
[1:23:26] cook H right if she can't cook you can
[1:23:30] fix that you could do some of the
[1:23:33] cooking yourself but if you marry
[1:23:35] somebody who's rotten in their spirit
[1:23:38] and their heart you can't fix that only
[1:23:40] God can fix
[1:23:42] that a man should pray earnestly he
[1:23:44] could ruin his entire life Remember The
[1:23:47] Vow I've heard people say well we can
[1:23:48] choose a pastor you know I heard
[1:23:50] somebody say that well we chose a pastor
[1:23:52] and I when I heard the name I said well
[1:23:54] we don't even have to pray about that
[1:23:56] that'll get you in trouble yeah if
[1:23:59] something ever happens to me you have to
[1:24:00] choose a pastor better pray it's
[1:24:03] important yes and he said if he knows
[1:24:06] what he's making the wrong choice he's
[1:24:07] Maring a woman isn't fit to be his wife
[1:24:09] he does it anyhow he said then it's his
[1:24:11] fault if the woman takes a husband knows
[1:24:13] he's not fit to be a husband to you and
[1:24:15] that's your own fault after you know
[1:24:16] what's right and wrong so you shouldn't
[1:24:18] do it until you thoroughly someone say
[1:24:20] thoroughly thoroughly pray through yes
[1:24:24] again the right one is a servant to
[1:24:27] others yeah the right one is a servant
[1:24:30] to others elaser devises the oddest test
[1:24:34] he says Lord he said if you know if I
[1:24:38] found the right one he said let it be
[1:24:40] the one who gives me water which about
[1:24:43] anybody would do if you see a thirsty
[1:24:45] guy you know coming stranger coming off
[1:24:47] the just Hospitality but then I wanted
[1:24:50] to be the one who Waters my
[1:24:52] camels now how how many of you young
[1:24:54] people before I show you how many how
[1:24:55] many of you young people know how many
[1:24:57] camels elar had with him do you know how
[1:24:59] many camels he had with him she's trying
[1:25:02] to remember kenedy's heard this he's
[1:25:03] trying to remember how many camels you
[1:25:05] have with him 10 10
[1:25:08] camels so if you had 10 camels think
[1:25:12] about this a camel drinks around 35
[1:25:15] gallons of
[1:25:16] water and they've been going through the
[1:25:19] desert right so they've got 10 camels
[1:25:22] going through the desert 35 gallons of
[1:25:25] water and they get up there and he said
[1:25:27] let the one who's willing to draw 350
[1:25:31] gallons of water in a little jug out of
[1:25:34] a well and pour it out for that's an all
[1:25:37] day job
[1:25:39] people it's messy it's hot it's sweaty
[1:25:43] let let it be the one who volunteers to
[1:25:45] do that yeah said let that be the
[1:25:49] one what is it she had a heart for
[1:25:52] service to a servant you don't
[1:25:56] want a beauty
[1:25:59] queen uh you want a
[1:26:01] servant you don't want a pretty
[1:26:04] boy you want a servant somebody who's
[1:26:08] willing to help when you need
[1:26:10] help huh and the best way if you go to
[1:26:13] church the best way to do that is to go
[1:26:16] to the church the church has more
[1:26:17] function than just we don't just exist I
[1:26:20] get irritated when people think we just
[1:26:21] exist for false Doctrine to be preached
[1:26:23] come on they don't understand what a
[1:26:24] church is come on huh in a church you
[1:26:27] find out who people are yeah cuz you're
[1:26:29] around each other right right and so a
[1:26:33] lot of times you find out who's willing
[1:26:34] to help in the kitchen oh it's getting
[1:26:36] sticky you
[1:26:38] know who's willing to who's willing to
[1:26:42] give and give and give and and and has
[1:26:46] that servant's heart who's willing to
[1:26:49] help when someone needs help which of
[1:26:52] them boys is willing to carry more
[1:26:53] chairs
[1:26:55] you know that's the test of manhood in
[1:26:56] in churches is how many chairs you can
[1:27:02] carry but but but who's who's willing
[1:27:04] don't have to be told to do that stuff
[1:27:06] just willing to do it yeah yeah huh
[1:27:10] who's willing to help out you see them
[1:27:12] they're always involved they don't have
[1:27:12] time to talk to you because they're
[1:27:13] always involved in stuff in the church
[1:27:15] that's the one that's the right one
[1:27:17] maybe not the right one for you but the
[1:27:18] right one for
[1:27:21] somebody so we got the right kind of
[1:27:23] attitude
[1:27:25] and again and the damel he said was very
[1:27:27] fair to look upon that don't hurt I
[1:27:30] believe God can give you somebody pretty
[1:27:31] I thank God he did for me now I'm not
[1:27:35] sure why that didn't work for my wife
[1:27:37] but you know God can give you something
[1:27:40] that's good to look
[1:27:41] at the damel was very fair to look upon
[1:27:44] a virgin neither had any man known her
[1:27:45] and she went down to the well filled her
[1:27:47] picture and came up and the servant ran
[1:27:50] to meet her and said let me I pray the
[1:27:51] drink a little water with that picture
[1:27:53] and she said drink my Lord and she
[1:27:55] hasted and let down her picture upon her
[1:27:57] hand give him drink when she'd done
[1:27:58] giving him drink she said oh by the way
[1:28:01] I will draw water for thy camels also
[1:28:04] until they have done drinking at least
[1:28:07] 320 gallons of water pulled up from a
[1:28:10] well poured out by hand the person who
[1:28:13] would do that she's isn't some prissy
[1:28:15] little girl who's afraid to break a
[1:28:17] fingernail she's a worker
[1:28:20] yeah the Bible says that the Elder women
[1:28:22] in the church ought to teach the younger
[1:28:24] women to be sober to love their husbands
[1:28:27] to love their children to be discreet
[1:28:29] chased keepers at home you know what
[1:28:30] that word Keepers means it means
[1:28:32] workers workers at home young man marry
[1:28:36] a worker young woman marry a
[1:28:39] worker somebody who's willing to do what
[1:28:42] needs to be done good obedient to their
[1:28:44] own husbands at the word of God be not
[1:28:47] blasphemed listen if she lays let me
[1:28:49] just get real with you guys if she lays
[1:28:51] around on her phone all day now and
[1:28:52] she's always available to
[1:28:55] talk oh it got
[1:28:58] quiet huh he's probably not the right
[1:29:02] one you want somebody who's doing
[1:29:04] something yeah right if he's always got
[1:29:08] time to
[1:29:09] talk chuckle how much people can talk
[1:29:12] now you know which I guess we did it too
[1:29:14] you know we we just use landlines you
[1:29:16] know but I worked I couldn't talk to my
[1:29:19] wife
[1:29:20] 24/7 I preached I had to study when we
[1:29:23] were I stud for sermons while we were
[1:29:25] going together and courting and and
[1:29:27] while we were engaged and before we get
[1:29:29] married I remember at our wedding
[1:29:31] reception arranging things for the
[1:29:33] service that weekend at our church
[1:29:35] finding a preacher and making sure that
[1:29:37] people somebody was going to be there
[1:29:39] right that you still do those things you
[1:29:41] don't just get to sit say well now we're
[1:29:44] now we're recording someone and we're
[1:29:45] and now we're not going to do anything
[1:29:47] else no it's not how it works find
[1:29:49] somebody if they lay around the house
[1:29:51] now won't get up in the morning go to
[1:29:53] work
[1:29:54] what are they going to do when they get
[1:29:55] married the same thing yeah now I'm done
[1:29:59] with
[1:30:01] that the right one's a
[1:30:03] servant the right one's under headship
[1:30:06] yes good the Bible says Rebecca was a
[1:30:08] virgin brother B said a young man tried
[1:30:09] to find a wife that's even a virgin
[1:30:11] that's moral you'd have to go around
[1:30:12] some good little old Holy Ghost Church I
[1:30:14] like to think of us as a good little old
[1:30:16] Holy Ghost Church that's all right you
[1:30:18] want to call me that I that's all right
[1:30:21] good little old Holy Ghost Church almost
[1:30:22] to find one he said that's exactly right
[1:30:24] where man just kept her in things like
[1:30:26] that got a little decency about her why
[1:30:28] because the husband I don't have time to
[1:30:29] go into this afternoon but the husband
[1:30:31] is his name is houseband that's what the
[1:30:33] word husband means he's the he's the
[1:30:35] protector of the house yes right he's
[1:30:38] the protector of the house even though
[1:30:41] uh she was fully grown it's true of boys
[1:30:43] as well but it's more true of girls
[1:30:45] because the boys sometimes they go out
[1:30:47] and find a wife a man he'll do that but
[1:30:51] but a a wife or girl the the father is a
[1:30:54] protector if she has one as a protector
[1:30:57] of that home the mother is protecting as
[1:31:00] well and here Rebecca was fully grown
[1:31:04] and and she had to make the decision
[1:31:05] herself but yet she was still under the
[1:31:08] headship of her father listening to the
[1:31:10] counsel of her mother and brother and
[1:31:13] Isaac on the other hand was completely
[1:31:14] trusting you talk about head being under
[1:31:16] headship he was letting his father pick
[1:31:18] for him I'm not saying that's I don't I
[1:31:22] don't want that responsibility but
[1:31:24] I will give
[1:31:25] advice it but now what do we learn from
[1:31:28] this it's appropriate for a young man to
[1:31:29] go out and seek a wife it's appropriate
[1:31:32] that that's why you go to youth camp
[1:31:33] that's all
[1:31:34] right I'll get hammered for saying that
[1:31:37] but that's okay is appropriate for young
[1:31:40] man to go out and seek a wife leave his
[1:31:41] father and mother and cleave to his wife
[1:31:42] what it means it don't mean he has to
[1:31:43] live where his wife lives but it just
[1:31:46] means that sometimes he'll go
[1:31:49] looking right because there aren't many
[1:31:50] trusted servants around we can send out
[1:31:56] so it's appropriate for a young man to
[1:31:57] go out and seek a wife his decision is
[1:32:00] who her decision is yes or no she has a
[1:32:03] decision every much as right to make a
[1:32:04] decision as he does girls you don't have
[1:32:06] to you don't have to always answer
[1:32:08] yes just cuz he asked I had somebody
[1:32:12] tell me said I would answer the first
[1:32:14] person that asked me I'd say yes I'm
[1:32:15] ready to get married that's a dangerous
[1:32:17] place to be
[1:32:20] in so you don't have to say yes but a
[1:32:24] young it's a young man's job to ask the
[1:32:25] question we I know we got that twisted
[1:32:28] around today but why do we have what we
[1:32:31] have the the the tradition of the man
[1:32:33] asking you know why that is Isaac and
[1:32:35] Rebecca the biblical example yeah yeah
[1:32:39] right that's the way that was done well
[1:32:40] that's been happening for thousands of
[1:32:42] years and now we got the girls asking
[1:32:43] the boys for their hand in marriage
[1:32:46] don't do that and if y all did that
[1:32:49] don't don't just don't worry don't tell
[1:32:50] me that story I don't
[1:32:54] now my wife had a revelation before I
[1:32:56] did that she was my wife she did but she
[1:32:59] didn't ask me I ask her she prayed and
[1:33:04] waited a little
[1:33:06] while but she didn't come after
[1:33:08] me right and it's not appropriate for a
[1:33:11] girl to be aggressive pursuing a guy
[1:33:14] it's not
[1:33:16] appropriate and you guys especially
[1:33:19] there's girl you know us dads we'll keep
[1:33:21] you from being too aggressive
[1:33:25] right we got our ways don't we brother
[1:33:27] Joe you know we we can stop you from
[1:33:29] being too aggressive but it is
[1:33:30] appropriate for a guy to pursue a girl
[1:33:33] it's not appropriate for the girl to you
[1:33:35] think well it's all going to be 50/50
[1:33:36] it's not going to be that's where we get
[1:33:38] this example woman's not supposed to be
[1:33:41] aggressive you know and that's turned
[1:33:42] around I don't have time to go through
[1:33:44] this I wanted to get through this but uh
[1:33:46] the Bible talks about 1 Timothy about
[1:33:47] shamefacedness how many you heard that
[1:33:49] that word how many you young people
[1:33:50] heard that word
[1:33:52] shamefacedness you know what that is is
[1:33:53] it's the ability to blush yeah right the
[1:33:57] ability to
[1:33:58] blush so brother BR talked about how
[1:34:01] women can't blush anymore there's no
[1:34:03] modesty he said I wouldn't even know
[1:34:05] what it was if some woman blush he they
[1:34:07] haven't got that dignity anymore he said
[1:34:09] they wear clothes like a man cut their
[1:34:11] hair like a man smoke like a man drink
[1:34:12] like a man cuss like a man vote like a
[1:34:13] man work like a man so become rough
[1:34:16] Burly shows where you got to that's
[1:34:18] exactly he said a little lady like you
[1:34:20] don't see her much more she's a hard
[1:34:21] person to find I thank God for Godly
[1:34:23] sisters don't you thank God for your
[1:34:25] wives and these young ladies that are
[1:34:27] sitting here we thank God for Godly
[1:34:29] sisters who aren't like this who can
[1:34:31] still
[1:34:32] blush he told brother argb he said it's
[1:34:35] hard to find a girl with enough modesty
[1:34:37] to blush they've heard so many dirty
[1:34:38] jokes and filth and you couldn't say
[1:34:40] anything to make them blush but brother
[1:34:41] Brandon said that was a god-given
[1:34:43] quality to safeguard our morals yeah
[1:34:46] right watch be careful how much you
[1:34:48] watch you young people don't need to
[1:34:50] have your head in romance novels all the
[1:34:52] time and and then romance TV shows all
[1:34:54] this stuff because you get to where
[1:34:55] nothing bothers you right you don't
[1:34:58] blush
[1:34:59] anymore brother brandom taught us that a
[1:35:01] woman a married woman shouldn't even
[1:35:03] wink at another
[1:35:04] man right you shouldn't do that you
[1:35:06] don't well how am I going to get a man
[1:35:08] if I don't paint above my eyes and I
[1:35:10] don't wink at them how am I going to get
[1:35:12] a man water some
[1:35:18] camels be a keeper at home learn to cook
[1:35:22] do the dishes
[1:35:24] I'm telling the truth now my wife before
[1:35:27] we got married you know what I noticed
[1:35:28] about her we don't do this today but
[1:35:31] what I noticed about my wife I'm sorry
[1:35:32] she's blushing now but what I what I
[1:35:34] noticed about my wife you know she's
[1:35:36] beautiful right but she was real young I
[1:35:38] was real young what I noticed about her
[1:35:40] she cleaned her bathroom with a
[1:35:42] toothbrush I'd never seen that done
[1:35:46] before and her grandma who kind of
[1:35:48] raised her great-grandmother who's gone
[1:35:49] now to be with the Lord she ironed her
[1:35:51] sheets you know that's the way she
[1:35:53] raised Britney in that way and and I
[1:35:55] thought you know in our lives we have
[1:35:57] three kids now so our house is always
[1:35:58] Helter Skelter but but but she was that
[1:36:01] way and I thought that there's something
[1:36:02] about that and and my wife when we got
[1:36:04] married she was a teenager we got
[1:36:06] married a young teenager and I've never
[1:36:09] had to tell my wife that never had to
[1:36:12] never had to uh never had to teach her
[1:36:15] how to clean
[1:36:16] house yeah or teach her how to and I've
[1:36:19] helped a few
[1:36:20] times but when we I worked and she had a
[1:36:23] baby
[1:36:24] and and I couldn't stay up all night
[1:36:26] with the baby I was going to work I work
[1:36:28] seven days a
[1:36:29] week and so she she took complete care
[1:36:32] of the babies Complete Care of our three
[1:36:34] children but I also didn't make her have
[1:36:36] 12 for another
[1:36:41] sermon God help
[1:36:45] me but Isaiah said you know in the Bible
[1:36:48] it says they walk with stretched forth
[1:36:49] necks and wanting eyes you know what
[1:36:52] that is a want and wanting eyes that
[1:36:54] that's a woman who who has no
[1:36:56] shamefacedness won't
[1:36:58] blush if you want one that'll do right
[1:37:01] watch how they work watch what they do
[1:37:03] for people watch how they work around
[1:37:05] the church boy that ought to get some of
[1:37:06] our sisters up and washing dishes over
[1:37:08] here at the fellowship H you know our
[1:37:10] young
[1:37:11] ones see God orchestrates these things
[1:37:14] the right one is God provided I got
[1:37:16] seven minutes I'm on finish the right
[1:37:19] one is God provided how many believe
[1:37:20] that did God provide your spouse those
[1:37:22] of you that are married
[1:37:24] eler recounts his story and the
[1:37:25] miraculous nature of it he begins to
[1:37:27] negotiate with her father and brother
[1:37:29] cuz you marry the whole family you know
[1:37:31] in verse 49 he said now if you will deal
[1:37:33] kindly and truly with my master tell me
[1:37:35] if not tell me I may return to the
[1:37:37] rightand or to the left and then laan
[1:37:39] and bethu answered and said the thing
[1:37:41] proceedeth from the Lord we cannot speak
[1:37:43] unto thee bad or good so in other words
[1:37:44] we can see the hand of God in it we
[1:37:47] ought to be able to see the hand of God
[1:37:48] in these things that's why Jesus said
[1:37:50] what God has joined together you don't
[1:37:51] have to push and shove and lie and
[1:37:53] pretend try to be somebody that you're
[1:37:55] not let God put it together let God do
[1:37:58] it and I've told you this story before
[1:38:00] but I am married today because I went
[1:38:03] and heard Daryl Ward
[1:38:05] preach so it's a good thing to come and
[1:38:07] hear a preacher come to church because
[1:38:09] you might meet your wife and I know uh
[1:38:12] uh brother Gabe sister Milly aren't here
[1:38:14] she was feeling bad this afternoon about
[1:38:15] to have a child but I know that uh they
[1:38:18] met the same way I I remember that night
[1:38:20] and I kind of me and Brother David kind
[1:38:22] of
[1:38:24] putting a little unction unction giving
[1:38:26] him a little anointing there push him in
[1:38:28] that
[1:38:29] direction you know and it it worked out
[1:38:33] they end up loving one another and don't
[1:38:35] always work out like that but it did and
[1:38:37] why they weren't expecting that it was
[1:38:39] something God did God put them together
[1:38:42] God let it be that way don't push and
[1:38:44] shove and and and lie to your parents
[1:38:47] and sneak around on the phone
[1:38:50] and get on that app that your parents
[1:38:52] don't know about out because your
[1:38:54] parents are kind of tech stupid and they
[1:38:55] don't realize you could talk to Boys on
[1:39:02] it oh yeah now some of you are
[1:39:07] blessing he's gaming apps and the
[1:39:10] parents think oh they're learning a
[1:39:11] foreign language
[1:39:14] and y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:39:17] talking to boys or talking to girls
[1:39:19] don't do that you get your parents
[1:39:21] permission you want a guy that'll ask
[1:39:22] your parent your do your father and your
[1:39:25] mother hey can I talk to your daughter
[1:39:27] get that
[1:39:28] guy I'm GL I wantan to I want to say
[1:39:30] something about our young men here we
[1:39:32] got some some young men that have that
[1:39:35] have held themselves right and done the
[1:39:36] right thing and I'm so proud you know
[1:39:38] why I don't preach on dress very much
[1:39:41] with our young people because I don't
[1:39:42] have
[1:39:44] to these young people I've noticed that
[1:39:47] our young people I think dress better
[1:39:49] than our elders sometimes not to put our
[1:39:52] elders down but they do they dress well
[1:39:54] and I'm proud of him for that yeah let's
[1:39:57] set that expectation yes let's keep them
[1:40:00] doing that right I want to encourage you
[1:40:02] in that and our young men have been for
[1:40:04] the most part appropriate with our young
[1:40:06] ladies let's keep doing that let's keep
[1:40:09] doing that and don't get upset you know
[1:40:11] it's hard to be the odd the odd person
[1:40:12] out you know it's always I was always
[1:40:14] the odd person out I was always you know
[1:40:16] it seemed like every girl that I like
[1:40:18] they was just waiting on another guy to
[1:40:19] come along and then they they leave me
[1:40:21] and go to them but you don't want that
[1:40:22] one in anyway you want somebody that
[1:40:25] loves you let God orchestrate it and
[1:40:28] don't overlook what God has provided and
[1:40:30] be content with what you are Paul said
[1:40:32] art thou bound unto a wife seek not to
[1:40:34] be loosed art thou loosed from a wife
[1:40:36] seek not a
[1:40:37] wife sounds like he's talking about jail
[1:40:43] there he said but if thou marry thou not
[1:40:46] sined if a virgin Mar she has not sinned
[1:40:48] nevertheless such shall have trouble in
[1:40:49] the flesh marriage is hard work he said
[1:40:52] but I spare you let God provide let
[1:40:54] lastly the right one is
[1:40:57] willing listen to me you won't have to
[1:40:59] chase them too
[1:41:02] hard and by the way you young girls
[1:41:04] don't be chasing these boys literally or
[1:41:11] figuratively if you catch them you
[1:41:13] wouldn't know what to do with
[1:41:16] them the right one is willing God works
[1:41:19] on both ends of the line aren't you glad
[1:41:21] that he does you won't have to talk the
[1:41:24] right one into an engagement oh oh I'm
[1:41:26] going to die if you don't marry me you
[1:41:28] know and and you got to finally make
[1:41:29] them feel sorry for them you know enough
[1:41:31] to to Mar no if they want to say yes
[1:41:34] they'll say
[1:41:35] yes don't hide things in your life all
[1:41:38] right try to get their sympathy they're
[1:41:40] going to find out be honest yes and if
[1:41:44] they are the right one they won't show
[1:41:45] interest just to make you jealous but
[1:41:47] Caleb and I talked about that I think we
[1:41:49] talked about that how that it seemed
[1:41:51] like girls that they have a problem with
[1:41:52] that and got guys do it too but they
[1:41:54] just show interest to make somebody else
[1:41:56] jealous don't do that girls don't play
[1:41:58] with somebody's emotions if you find
[1:42:00] somebody that's right you'll know
[1:42:03] yeah it'll be how will you know you'll
[1:42:05] just
[1:42:08] know and it'll be somebody that'll fit
[1:42:10] the word it'll fit all of this right and
[1:42:14] I promise you your parents won't be too
[1:42:16] mad if you find the right
[1:42:20] one dads always get mad that's their job
[1:42:22] but
[1:42:24] anyway Genesis 24:58 they called Rebecca
[1:42:27] and said to her wil thou go with this
[1:42:28] man she said I'll go clear-cut
[1:42:31] decision he didn't have to pretend to be
[1:42:34] something he didn't have to sell her a
[1:42:36] story but she'd been told how Isaac was
[1:42:38] aired all that Abraham had she knew
[1:42:40] she'd be taken care of yeah listen Isaac
[1:42:43] wasn't some person we said some random
[1:42:45] person Isaac had a job he wasn't abusive
[1:42:48] he wasn't on his second or third wife he
[1:42:50] wasn't a Manchild playing video games
[1:42:51] while she worked
[1:42:54] but Isaac was was ready to be married
[1:42:57] and she was ready to go marry him so
[1:42:59] they were there was willingness on both
[1:43:00] ends of the line yeah let me tell you
[1:43:02] young people your Isaac is out there
[1:43:04] your Rebecca is out there don't settle
[1:43:06] for less right because once you say yes
[1:43:09] you're
[1:43:10] committed yeah right and in fact in
[1:43:13] those days once you were betrothed you
[1:43:14] were legally married you couldn't come
[1:43:17] together yet but you were legally
[1:43:18] married now that wasn't some 12-year-old
[1:43:20] kid saying I'm going to marry you
[1:43:21] someday you know like we get but it's it
[1:43:25] was a legally binding agreement between
[1:43:27] two families betral the promise
[1:43:31] matters brother Brandon says when you're
[1:43:33] engaged to her as far as God is
[1:43:34] concerned you're married to
[1:43:36] her be careful about who you
[1:43:39] ask you don't get to do that again and I
[1:43:43] realize every situation is different I
[1:43:44] don't think we ought to look at people
[1:43:46] and say well you know that one got
[1:43:48] engaged and they broke up and they did
[1:43:49] this they don't look at that you just
[1:43:50] stay right with the word yourself no put
[1:43:53] down on other people like that you don't
[1:43:55] know the situation right but know this
[1:43:58] it's a it's a serious thing when you
[1:43:59] make a vow yes engagement is not the
[1:44:02] time to give you getting to know someone
[1:44:04] right know them before you get engaged
[1:44:07] pray before you get engaged he said well
[1:44:10] I can't get as close to them as I'd like
[1:44:11] to so I get to know them better pray
[1:44:15] talk to their parents yeah and you talk
[1:44:17] to them you need to talk to them right
[1:44:19] but make sure the parents are involved
[1:44:21] consult your pastor consult her pastor
[1:44:24] if it's a different Pastor or his Pastor
[1:44:27] finding the right and if they're the
[1:44:28] right one they'll have one or get one
[1:44:31] yes finding the right one doesn't mean
[1:44:33] everything will go smoothly your entire
[1:44:35] marriage the right one might be poor
[1:44:38] he'll work but he might be poor right
[1:44:40] one might have a difficult background
[1:44:42] come from the world or a different kind
[1:44:43] of church but there'll be a believer
[1:44:46] whose sins are forgiven aren't you glad
[1:44:47] for forgiveness of
[1:44:49] sins and and and and the right one we
[1:44:52] should never look bad at young people
[1:44:53] who come out of the world you know
[1:44:55] sometimes we feel like the only ones
[1:44:57] eligible to get married are ones no we
[1:44:58] we want our young people to we want
[1:45:00] young people to come in and and feel
[1:45:02] like they can find a wife in the world I
[1:45:04] I'm glad but let them get saved filled
[1:45:06] with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:07] first right but we want them we want
[1:45:10] them to get saved and let sins washed
[1:45:12] away if they've been married before it's
[1:45:14] a different thing you need to you need
[1:45:16] to talk to your pastor and make sure
[1:45:18] those things are right but we're we're
[1:45:20] not looking for temporary pleasure don't
[1:45:23] settled for that the world's full of
[1:45:25] that that's not an option yeah huh
[1:45:28] that's why we don't use dating
[1:45:31] apps got real
[1:45:34] quiet we don't use dating apps we don't
[1:45:36] get on the internet to look for a wife
[1:45:37] because everything on there's a
[1:45:40] lie don't do that if you found your wife
[1:45:42] online that's bless the Lord you know
[1:45:46] wonderful that God gave you Grace but
[1:45:49] make sure you get to know her even if
[1:45:50] you connected online make sure you get
[1:45:51] to know her before you ask her to marry
[1:45:54] or him or accept a marriage proposal
[1:45:57] we're not looking for temporary pleasure
[1:45:59] love is eternal I'll say this I'll read
[1:46:01] this quote musicians go ahead and
[1:46:04] come brother brand said love is eternal
[1:46:07] listen to me young people love is
[1:46:11] eternal it's not fleeting it's not a
[1:46:14] feeling it's Eternal he said When a Man
[1:46:17] Loves a Woman and marries her because
[1:46:18] she's
[1:46:19] pretty there will be an end to that but
[1:46:23] when a man finds a woman that he loves
[1:46:25] he don't know
[1:46:27] why but he loves her that's why I said
[1:46:30] you'll know wait till you know you'll
[1:46:34] know people try to talk you out of it
[1:46:36] but you you just
[1:46:38] know she finds a man that she
[1:46:41] loves no matter what he looks like
[1:46:43] praise
[1:46:45] God he loves her she loves him that's an
[1:46:49] eternal mate in glory death nor nothing
[1:46:52] else can ever separate them because
[1:46:55] they're from
[1:46:57] eternity because love is eternal love is
[1:47:01] not a temporary thing a fling an affair
[1:47:06] that's not what love is love is eternal
[1:47:09] I want you to remember these things as
[1:47:10] we close to begin to play something the
[1:47:12] right one is a
[1:47:14] Believer the right one is approved by
[1:47:17] Godly
[1:47:18] Parents the right one will be found
[1:47:21] through prayer
[1:47:23] the right one is a servant to
[1:47:26] others the right one is under
[1:47:29] headship the right one is God
[1:47:32] provided you won't have to push and
[1:47:34] shove for it the right one's
[1:47:36] willing you know I want so badly for all
[1:47:39] of you I
[1:47:40] realize that not everything's going to
[1:47:42] work
[1:47:43] out in the world half of all marriages
[1:47:48] end in divorce did you know that half
[1:47:51] 50%
[1:47:54] and the ones
[1:47:55] that anymore a lot of them don't even
[1:47:57] bother to get married you realize there
[1:47:58] are more unmarried people living
[1:48:00] together than there are married people
[1:48:02] today we're taught not to do that we
[1:48:05] don't believe in that we want marriages
[1:48:07] that last let me say this it's a it's
[1:48:10] the best thing the Bible says it's the
[1:48:13] best thing he can give you next to
[1:48:14] Salvation is a Godly wife marriage is a
[1:48:18] wonderful thing I don't let people scare
[1:48:20] you too much I say these things and kids
[1:48:22] get scared I don't want you to be scared
[1:48:24] and most of our young people are not old
[1:48:25] enough to be married anyway but I want
[1:48:28] you to I want you to look down down the
[1:48:31] road someday Melody not too
[1:48:34] long you be that bride that blessing
[1:48:36] bride walking down the
[1:48:39] aisle let the Lord just let you stay
[1:48:42] with me and I'd be okay with that too
[1:48:45] she shook her head no on both
[1:48:49] things someday you might be that girls
[1:48:52] you you might be that voice and you
[1:48:54] younger ones you say well this doesn't
[1:48:55] affect me but keep it in mind going
[1:48:59] forward don't play with these things let
[1:49:02] let God lead you it's a serious thing I
[1:49:04] I know you get little boyfriends and
[1:49:06] girlfriends and things but let it you
[1:49:08] don't need that in your life right now
[1:49:10] just be friends love love one another in
[1:49:12] in a Godly Christian way when you get
[1:49:15] older there's going to come a time you
[1:49:17] get a choice that you have to make and
[1:49:19] when it comes time for that choice
[1:49:20] remember what we said I may not be here
[1:49:23] when you get old enough to make a choice
[1:49:25] but listen to what's been said cuz we
[1:49:28] want to it's it's the word that washes
[1:49:30] us from our own ideas to let us follow
[1:49:33] the word and and be right we want to be
[1:49:35] right listen I don't say these things to
[1:49:36] be mean it's not because of culture it's
[1:49:39] not because of that we the what we've
[1:49:41] been taught we've been taught for a
[1:49:42] reason is to make have make you have a
[1:49:44] happy marriage one that you'll get along
[1:49:46] with somebody listen you don't have to
[1:49:49] fight all the
[1:49:50] time you couples if you do that every
[1:49:53] day you're fighting and fighting and
[1:49:54] fussing you need to
[1:49:56] repent you need to you need to work on
[1:49:59] that fall in love with each other
[1:50:02] again brother B told a story about a
[1:50:06] couple who about to get divorced just
[1:50:08] comes to my
[1:50:09] mind he said
[1:50:11] that they were fighting over everything
[1:50:14] people do that I they fight fuss over
[1:50:18] the cat and the dog everything
[1:50:20] else he said they were fighting fussing
[1:50:23] and dividing all the stuff up and they
[1:50:25] divided all the clothes and furniture
[1:50:27] they finally make it to the attic and
[1:50:29] they're fussing and fighting and they
[1:50:33] get to a trunk that they some stuff they
[1:50:35] put away and she said this is mine this
[1:50:38] is mine finally they found something
[1:50:39] they both grabbed a hold of at the same
[1:50:41] time and was a little baby
[1:50:45] shoe and they'd had a baby that they'
[1:50:48] lost they' bought the little shoes for
[1:50:50] it never got to wear it
[1:50:53] and when they both grabbed that shoe
[1:50:55] they looked at each other's eyes but the
[1:50:56] man said that they realized they had
[1:50:58] something in common listen to me Mary
[1:51:00] you got something in
[1:51:02] common fight for what you have it's
[1:51:05] worth fighting
[1:51:07] for make make it right the worst thing
[1:51:10] I've counts people I've told them the
[1:51:12] worst thing in a marriage is apathy it's
[1:51:14] the absolute worst
[1:51:16] thing it's worse than fighting is people
[1:51:19] don't care anymore eventually it just
[1:51:22] goes away way cuz nobody cared fight for
[1:51:25] it if you got something worth you got
[1:51:26] something in common fight for that I
[1:51:29] think as Believers we ought to fight for
[1:51:31] one another as young people do the best
[1:51:34] you can do we don't want you just to get
[1:51:35] along we want you to be The Shining
[1:51:37] Light an example to other young people
[1:51:39] as you are already you're an example to
[1:51:41] other young people in other places
[1:51:43] continue to be that you young men you
[1:51:46] stand strong do the right thing that you
[1:51:49] say well I don't have a girlfriend right
[1:51:50] now it'll come I don't have a boyfriend
[1:51:53] right now it'll come just wait on God
[1:51:55] wait till you're old enough wait on God
[1:51:58] let God take care of those things he'll
[1:52:01] handle it for you he did for Rebecca if
[1:52:03] he did it for Rebecca he did it for
[1:52:04] Isaac he can do it for you I believe he
[1:52:07] will hey man let's bow our heads
[1:52:09] together
