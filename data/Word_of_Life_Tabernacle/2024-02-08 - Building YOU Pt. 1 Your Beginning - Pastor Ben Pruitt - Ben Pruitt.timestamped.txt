[35:02] you young people try to be here and
[35:04] those that aren't able to be here
[35:05] tonight try to be here on Sunday
[35:07] afternoon I'm sure it'll be a blessing
[35:10] to you uh we'll we'll have our communion
[35:12] service the first Sunday in March
[35:14] brother Harvey if we'll go ahead and do
[35:17] that that that week can give us time to
[35:18] put things back together and uh you
[35:21] remind me of that so we don't forget
[35:24] amen amen Ephesians 4:11 he gave some
[35:28] Apostles some prophets some evangelists
[35:30] some pastors and teachers the perfecting
[35:33] of the Saints for the work of the
[35:36] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[35:39] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[35:42] the faith of the knowledge of the Son of
[35:45] God to a perfect man un to the measure
[35:48] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[35:52] I pray the Lord with add his Blessing to
[35:53] the word you may be
[35:55] seated
[36:01] man named Roy Sullivan was struck by
[36:04] lightning seven
[36:06] times that's pretty hard to do he uh I
[36:10] think the odds of of getting struck by
[36:12] lightning twice is something like one in
[36:14] N million he was struck by lightning in
[36:18] 1942 and lost a nail on his big toe he
[36:21] was struck by lightning in 69 70 72 73
[36:26] 76 and 77 suffered injuries to his
[36:31] shoulder his ankle his chest and and the
[36:35] strike in 72 even caused his hair to
[36:37] catch on
[36:38] fire in 1973 he was struck again he cost
[36:42] he he caused him to lose the hair he'
[36:44] just grown
[36:45] back and it's hard to believe someone
[36:49] could be that unlucky as we would call
[36:51] it but you know he didn't die from
[36:54] that he actually committed suicide
[36:58] died from his own hand and uh and all
[37:01] those times you know I don't know you
[37:04] you probably would feel like the
[37:06] unluckiest person in the world if you'd
[37:08] been struck by lightning seven times and
[37:11] yet if you'd been struck by lightning
[37:12] seven times and it didn't kill
[37:15] you right you'd have to feel pretty
[37:20] blessed but he didn't see it that way a
[37:23] lot of it is our Viewpoint yeah right
[37:26] and I know that many times we we we we
[37:28] tend to take on a a victim mentality we
[37:31] tend to uh we become a victim of
[37:34] circumstances and and and and people
[37:37] life can be hard and we recognize that
[37:40] some people have a much harder life than
[37:42] others it just seems like they're marked
[37:44] for for difficulty and yet uh one of
[37:47] that's one of the most difficult things
[37:49] as a pastor is to get people to see
[37:51] beyond that and see that the things that
[37:53] come to them are actually ordered of the
[37:56] Lord and we are not victims in fact we
[38:00] are Victors tonight we we cannot be
[38:04] victims according to the word of the
[38:06] Lord so we have to be able to uh to look
[38:09] away from our circumstances and look
[38:12] away from how we've lived and look away
[38:14] from what has happened to us and see
[38:17] something brother the eyesa that's more
[38:18] real than the reality of what we've gone
[38:22] through if we're not careful we I think
[38:25] a good example example of of this is is
[38:27] Marxism you know in Marxism uh I'm a
[38:31] victim of electronics actually tonight
[38:34] but but uh messing up but Marxism is a
[38:38] is a victim mentality and what they
[38:40] taught the people is that you're poor
[38:43] because of the circumstances of your
[38:45] life and and and many times that's true
[38:47] but they said because of that it gives
[38:49] you the right that if you can
[38:51] collectively gather together and
[38:53] overthrow the system that gives you the
[38:55] right to to do what whatever you want to
[38:57] do to the oppressor class to the ones
[39:00] who owned everything it gives you the
[39:02] right to just uh do whatever it is that
[39:04] you want to do and and because you're a
[39:07] victim and it it it it separated people
[39:10] into groups and labeled those people I
[39:12] think we have a form of that today and
[39:14] you see it on social media feeds that uh
[39:17] we give ourselves all kinds of names for
[39:20] uh for to that make us victims and we
[39:22] become a victim to some illness or a
[39:25] victim to some mental state or a victim
[39:27] to some uh way that we are and say well
[39:30] this is just the way I am but that's not
[39:32] what the gospel teaches us the gospel
[39:34] teaches us that whatever condition we
[39:37] are in whatever state our mind is in
[39:39] whatever state our body is in We are
[39:41] never a victim of our circumstances but
[39:44] our life can be changed so radically in
[39:46] a moment's time in a moment in the
[39:49] presence of Christ we can actually
[39:51] become something completely different
[39:53] than what we were born to be or what it
[39:56] seemed like like our life was headed
[39:57] towards or what it was that we had we
[39:59] had happened to us in our past we can be
[40:01] more than that right that's what the
[40:04] gospel teaches us and sometimes we don't
[40:07] even realize that we're being
[40:09] manipulated by
[40:10] memes manipulated by cute
[40:13] pictures to tell us that we're a certain
[40:16] way or or we have a certain problem and
[40:18] we don't realize that there's there's a
[40:20] scripture that we can look to there's a
[40:23] Bible there's a word of God that we can
[40:25] look at and it tells you're more than
[40:27] conquerors to him that loved
[40:30] you so we don't want to believe what has
[40:33] been set up for us under Satan's Eden
[40:37] under his under his economy under his
[40:40] reign as it would be we want to believe
[40:43] the word amen do we believe that the
[40:46] word is right how many believe the Bible
[40:47] is the inherent word of God it's it's
[40:50] absolutely the word of God it it's
[40:52] infallible it comes to us and God has
[40:55] protected it and so we can look at the
[40:57] Bible and see that we are the victors in
[41:00] this life we are the people that God has
[41:03] called to overcome and and you realize
[41:06] then that if he knows us and he knows
[41:08] about us and he knows all about our life
[41:10] that we cannot be a victim we must be a
[41:13] Victor now uh we we realize that Abraham
[41:17] was just out there one day he was in the
[41:20] in his father's God shop brother brand
[41:22] said he was making idols and he he's
[41:24] just he's just knocking around like any
[41:26] body else would just just conducting
[41:28] himself like anybody else but one day
[41:30] God spoke to Abraham he was just one of
[41:33] millions of people in that time one of
[41:36] millions of people in that Civilization
[41:38] but God spoke to him one day and he said
[41:41] Abraham I want you to move from the
[41:43] place where you're at to another place I
[41:45] want you to be something different I
[41:47] want you to become a father of Nations I
[41:49] know you can't you haven't been able to
[41:50] give birth with Sarah but I'm going to
[41:52] make you a father of Nations and Abraham
[41:55] believed God and was imputed to him for
[41:57] righteousness a moment that he heard
[41:59] from God changed his life
[42:02] forever and his Circumstances had
[42:05] nothing to do with it whether he had
[42:06] money or not had nothing to do with it
[42:08] it was all about what God said that's
[42:10] right he heard the word of the Lord and
[42:12] he believed it and it changed it forever
[42:14] oh church if we could only believe it
[42:16] tonight we have heard the word of the
[42:18] lord we have thus sayith the Lord if we
[42:20] could only believe it and grab a hold of
[42:24] it Moses was uh was born in slavery but
[42:28] but God so ordained his life and
[42:31] controlled his life until he he was when
[42:34] when they sent him down the river uh to
[42:36] be eaten Maybe by crocodiles or lost in
[42:39] the river he was actually saved by
[42:41] Pharaoh's daughter and he become a king
[42:43] like in Pharaoh's house next to pharaoh
[42:45] and he actually delivered the people of
[42:48] Israel what was it God had ordained
[42:50] something over his life and God has
[42:52] ordained something over our life today
[42:55] Rahab you signed in the uh in Jericho
[42:58] Rahab was a woman that had nothing going
[43:00] for her her parents had turned her out
[43:02] on the street and she was a woman who'
[43:04] had been used by men abused by men taken
[43:07] and and she she she she earned her money
[43:10] in the worst kind of a way but when the
[43:12] spies came by her house oh it wasn't no
[43:15] accident that they came by rahab's house
[43:17] but she was predestined to hear it and
[43:19] to believe it and because she happened
[43:21] to be the one that was standing there
[43:23] that day when they come by her house and
[43:25] she said I believe whatever God tells
[43:27] you he'll do it amen oh I I think we
[43:31] ought to be like Rahab tonight not look
[43:34] at our circumstances but look at the
[43:36] promise amen they said if you'll hang
[43:38] this scarlet cord out the window you'll
[43:40] be okay and I'm just going through some
[43:42] of these to show us what a difference it
[43:44] can make when we hear from the word of
[43:46] the Lord when we believe it Mary
[43:47] Magdalene was a woman with Seven Devils
[43:51] she had Seven Devils on her and and and
[43:53] she was a woman that brother Brown said
[43:55] she had devils of Pride and and all
[43:57] those different devils that she had and
[43:59] yet she was a woman that met Jesus and
[44:01] out of her was the Seven Devils were
[44:03] cast and she become a follower of Jesus
[44:06] the woman at the well was a woman that
[44:08] had done everything wrong the woman who
[44:10] washed Jesus feet another woman think of
[44:13] the number of prostitutes that Jesus
[44:15] come by their way because they were
[44:17] ordained to life right and there was
[44:20] there was no e it made no economic sense
[44:22] it made no cultural sense it made no
[44:24] sense that they would ever be different
[44:26] than what their family was but they were
[44:28] different anyway because God said
[44:30] so they were ordained to life a
[44:34] representation in heaven I think of
[44:37] Legion Legion out of whom or he was so
[44:40] full of devils and out of his mind and
[44:44] they cut himself and he and he and he
[44:48] actually was so angry and so mean that
[44:51] no one could bear him be around him he
[44:54] dwelt among the tombs
[44:56] naked and when Jesus spoke to those
[45:00] demons spoke them out of his
[45:02] life they found him sitting at the feet
[45:05] of Jesus in his right mind clothed amen
[45:09] he had no reason to be there but the
[45:10] grace of God Jesus had a need to go by
[45:13] the place where he
[45:15] was Paul was persecuting Christians he
[45:18] was headed just as hard as he could
[45:21] against God trying to do everything he
[45:23] could against God and he was persecuting
[45:25] Christians and one day he's on his way
[45:27] to Damascus to do more persecuting and
[45:29] God knocked him off of his high horse
[45:31] right in the middle of the road and
[45:33] turned him around made him an apostle to
[45:34] the Gentiles
[45:37] right think of brother brandom I went
[45:39] and did a a little genology the other
[45:42] day on brother Brandon's family that's
[45:44] an interesting
[45:46] study bunch of bootleggers and and uh
[45:51] people that you know you wouldn't be
[45:52] necessarily proud of and parts of his
[45:54] family like everybody else El you have
[45:56] the good and the bad brother brandom's
[45:58] family his father there it was in
[46:00] Jeffersonville paper I can show you the
[46:02] clipping of it where his father became a
[46:06] was put in jail when he was young and
[46:08] how that he had to provide for his his
[46:10] siblings because he was the
[46:12] oldest and they had they had to go on
[46:14] welfare parents were on welfare because
[46:18] his father was in jail and they had no
[46:20] money beside what they got from him
[46:22] selling Moonshine Whiskey God made a
[46:26] profit out of a boy raised in that kind
[46:29] of a
[46:30] home I don't want to stop just there I I
[46:33] want to tell you I want to testify to
[46:34] you tonight that God can do exceedingly
[46:37] and abundantly above all that we could
[46:39] ask or thing I'm going to testify to you
[46:41] that I've been poor I've been homeless
[46:43] I've been I've not had any AD DI to my
[46:45] name but I know God lifted me up and if
[46:48] he Lifted Me Up he can lift you up
[46:52] tonight I was born in sin like you were
[46:55] without hope so you and I could say that
[46:58] we are not victims we are Victors over
[47:01] these circumstances of life I want you
[47:04] to understand what God does and how he
[47:07] works in your life and in my life and I
[47:11] we just want to take a deep dive into it
[47:13] and how does God deal with the
[47:16] individual the Bible tells us that
[47:18] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[47:22] world that's just a fact that's the word
[47:24] of God he said believe it was the
[47:26] infallible word of God and so you might
[47:28] say brother Ben well I can't overcome
[47:29] this or I can't overcome that but he
[47:31] said whatsoever is born of God
[47:34] overcometh the
[47:36] world that that encompasses all of it he
[47:39] overcometh the world and this is the
[47:42] victory that overcometh the world even
[47:44] our faith so when we believe we can't do
[47:46] it we can't but if we ever could believe
[47:49] that we can do it then we
[47:51] can why because the victory that
[47:53] overcomes the world faith is the victory
[47:55] Victory amen you believe that
[47:58] tonight so I want us to see again what
[48:01] the infallible inherent word of God says
[48:04] about
[48:05] you and I want us to take it real
[48:08] personal come on now good I don't want
[48:10] us to put it over on the preacher or put
[48:12] it over on somebody else but you've got
[48:14] to believe the message you've got to be
[48:17] born again you've got to you your
[48:20] children young people all of us we've
[48:22] got to be ourselves we've got to
[48:24] manifest the word if somebody's going in
[48:26] a Rapture it's going to be me if
[48:28] somebody's going to overcome it's going
[48:30] to be me it's one thing to come to
[48:32] church and sympathize with the message
[48:34] and sympathize with what's being said
[48:36] and even enjoy the fellowship but it's
[48:37] another thing to say that's for me I'm
[48:40] the eagle that he's crying to I'm the
[48:42] one that heard the word of God for my
[48:44] day right and you might sit for years
[48:47] and and sit around and think well I I
[48:50] just you know it's never been for me I
[48:52] just I just kind of go along with it but
[48:54] one day a light strikes on the inside of
[48:56] your soul and you realize it is for me
[48:59] it is
[49:01] mine so I want us to think about
[49:03] ourselves as
[49:05] individuals the brand said Christ never
[49:07] sent me to build organization but he
[49:10] sent me to build individuals to the
[49:11] stature of Jesus Christ that they might
[49:14] be the
[49:15] PowerHouse oh don't I want our church to
[49:17] be a Powerhouse but that's not what he
[49:19] said he said that they might be the
[49:21] PowerHouse you as individuals could be
[49:23] the
[49:24] PowerHouse and the Dwelling Place of the
[49:26] Spirit by his
[49:29] word and I want to present to you
[49:31] tonight as we're kind of just backing
[49:33] this up and laying the groundwork for
[49:35] something we want to say maybe over a
[49:37] few services but I want to present to
[49:40] you tonight that you've heard all the
[49:42] psychology yeah come on you've heard
[49:44] your parents you've heard your friends
[49:47] you've heard from Facebook you've heard
[49:50] from all the social media sites now hear
[49:53] from
[49:54] God it's about time to hear from God
[49:57] what does God say that you are does he
[50:00] say that you're lost and and and and and
[50:02] and you're unlucky and and you're a
[50:04] victim or does he say that you're his
[50:06] child and he loves you and he's going to
[50:08] take care of you and he's going to do
[50:10] what he
[50:11] promised come on now you've heard from
[50:13] everybody else now hear from
[50:16] God look what he told Jeremiah and
[50:19] Jeremiah the prophet in Jeremiah 1: 15
[50:21] he said before I formed thee in the
[50:23] belly I knew thee oh aren't you glad for
[50:26] a God that knew you sir before thou
[50:28] comest forth out of the womb I sanctify
[50:31] thee and I ordain thee a prophit unto
[50:35] the Nations so it tells us that God
[50:38] allows or limits can even limit what we
[50:41] might get into in the future because he
[50:43] said before I I set you apart and
[50:46] Sanctified you when you were in your
[50:47] mother's womb now we know that he is God
[50:50] and you say well Jeremiah was a prophet
[50:53] but God's forn knowledge is not limited
[50:55] to prophets I want us to turn to Psalms
[50:58] 139 and we've dealt with this before but
[51:00] it's been some time and so I want to
[51:02] look at this chapter of Psalms
[51:04] 139 we'll take several verses look what
[51:07] Look What the Lord says about you again
[51:11] I want this to be real personal to you
[51:13] tonight I don't want you looking around
[51:15] at somebody else I don't want you
[51:16] pitchforking at somebody else I want you
[51:18] to look at you yes sir this is for you
[51:24] he said behold I see you the message
[51:27] Elijah the prophet amen behold I come
[51:30] he's coming back for
[51:32] you amen not for a group but he's coming
[51:35] back for an individual that loves him
[51:37] amen right and so this is what he thinks
[51:41] about you and what he knows about you
[51:44] and and David said oh Lord thou has
[51:46] searched me and known me look how
[51:49] personal it is and also it's past
[51:52] tense you have known me yes sir you have
[51:55] searched me amen he already has he he's
[51:59] not you're not waiting on him to do this
[52:01] this is what the word says he already
[52:03] has done you have searched me you have
[52:07] known
[52:08] me verse two thou knowest my Downs
[52:11] sitting and my Uprising thou
[52:14] understandest my thought a far off thou
[52:19] compassest my path and my lying down and
[52:22] art acquainted with all my ways that a
[52:24] far off by the way is not distance but
[52:27] time you understand my thought before I
[52:30] think
[52:31] it you you Compass my path and my lying
[52:35] down you are acquainted with all someone
[52:37] say
[52:38] all all my ways so David gives a picture
[52:43] he said you surround me you you've laid
[52:45] Siege to my life like an army would
[52:48] around a city he said you've laid seege
[52:50] to my life you're on you're on this side
[52:52] you're on that side you're on the other
[52:54] side and so you when you think well I've
[52:56] been struck by lightning seven times
[52:58] I've had a real unlucky life but
[52:59] remember whatever's happened in your
[53:01] life it had to go through a Siege of God
[53:04] that was around
[53:06] you his Providence was around you on
[53:09] every side you said when does this start
[53:12] well we're going to find out in just a
[53:13] moment he said you are you you compasses
[53:17] my path in other words you surround me
[53:19] there's no getting away oh my there
[53:22] there's no uh there's no uh falling in
[53:25] between the cracks there's no getting
[53:28] lost but you surround me sir you lay
[53:32] seeds to my path of
[53:34] Life verse four for there is not a word
[53:37] in my tongue but L Lord thou knowest it
[53:40] all together what that is is he said be
[53:42] before I can frame a word on the tip of
[53:46] my
[53:47] tongue the Lord is already thoroughly
[53:50] familiar with what I have to
[53:54] say oh my it to we ought to complain
[53:57] less and thank him more he said
[54:01] before Oh My before you ever made your
[54:04] comp before you ever said the word he
[54:06] already knew who you were what you were
[54:08] and what you were about to
[54:13] say that's so wonderful to me brother
[54:15] Allan because you know you speak by
[54:17] inspiration I have notes that I use and
[54:19] quotes and scriptures but you speak by
[54:21] inspiration a lot of times I don't know
[54:23] what I'm about to say till I say it
[54:25] but he already
[54:27] knew can you think of an intelligence
[54:29] like that I don't even know what I'm
[54:31] about to say I'm just preaching under
[54:33] inspiration but he already knew what I
[54:35] was going to say before I ever said
[54:38] it amen he was thoroughly familiar with
[54:42] my words thou H has beset me behind and
[54:46] before and laid thine hand upon me so he
[54:49] said I'm in the path of life you
[54:51] surrounded you me you besieged me and
[54:54] you beset me behind and before so
[54:56] there's nowhere to run and then you put
[54:58] your hand on my shoulder you arrested
[55:02] me I want us to think because I know
[55:05] right now you might be feeling well you
[55:06] know well I brother Ben I life's pretty
[55:09] bad right now I don't have much money I
[55:10] don't know what we're going to do I
[55:12] don't know what's going to happen next
[55:13] but these truths do not
[55:16] change based on where you're at in the
[55:20] path right whether you're beginning
[55:22] whether you're in the middle whether
[55:23] you're at the end he said even down to
[55:25] your old age I will keep
[55:28] you listen it doesn't matter what part
[55:30] of the path you're on he said I have
[55:32] arrested you I put my hand on your
[55:36] shoulder hallelujah thank you Jonah I
[55:39] appreciate the
[55:42] support he put He put my his hand on my
[55:45] shoulder aren't you glad to be arrested
[55:47] by God
[55:50] right you said but I haven't been
[55:52] arrested by God what are you doing here
[55:58] well my parents were believe the message
[56:00] and so I believe the message why did
[56:02] your parents believe the
[56:04] message at some point
[56:07] somebody had to come across the message
[56:10] at some point somebody had to believe on
[56:12] Christ at some point somebody had to do
[56:14] that whether it was your generation or
[56:16] in a previous generation somebody had to
[56:18] do that and so you're being here is not
[56:21] an accident at
[56:23] all you're being in your seat tonight in
[56:26] this in the seats you're sitting in in
[56:28] the church you're sitting in hearing the
[56:29] preaching that you're hearing listening
[56:31] to the reading the Bible that you're
[56:32] reading that is not an accident at
[56:37] all that's because he said you have
[56:40] arrested me I am under your
[56:45] control and David he can't hardly handle
[56:48] it as I think maybe we can't hardly
[56:50] handle it today the the thought is too
[56:53] big for our brains
[56:55] the the concept of deity by the D is too
[56:58] big for us it's too much for us to
[57:01] understand oh but I'm so glad I can
[57:03] believe it
[57:04] anyway I don't understand how that all
[57:07] that God was came down but the B talked
[57:10] about how God was existed up in the
[57:12] heaven he said he filled all time and
[57:14] space and when Adam and Eve walked out
[57:16] of the garden and that that that Bloody
[57:18] that bloody skin knocked up against her
[57:20] legs he said that there was actually he
[57:22] said God condensed himself down and come
[57:25] down into a pillar of fire and watched
[57:27] them walk out of the garden I don't
[57:30] understand how God could make himself a
[57:31] germ in the womb of a of a of a mother
[57:34] of of of a little 15-year-old maybe
[57:36] 16year old girl that Mary as she was
[57:39] there a little virgin girl I don't
[57:41] understand how he did it but I know he
[57:42] did it I know he did it such knowledge
[57:46] is too wonderful for me it's high I can
[57:48] un attain unto it he said whe shall I go
[57:51] from thy Spirit whether shall I flee
[57:53] from thy presence if I Ascend up into
[57:56] heaven you're there if I make my bed in
[57:58] hell behold Thou Art there yes if I take
[58:01] the wings of the morning and dwell in
[58:03] the uttermost parts of the sea even
[58:05] there shall thy hand lead me and thy
[58:08] right hand shall hold
[58:11] me and I sit there thinking I I I'm
[58:13] doing this all by myself and you're
[58:15] really not right you sit there thinking
[58:18] that you got it all in control and you
[58:20] really don't you sit there thinking that
[58:23] you're the one that messed up your life
[58:24] and you really
[58:26] weren't think about it for a minute God
[58:29] had to allow it for some
[58:32] purpose and I don't make me want to go
[58:34] out and just make a mess of my life
[58:36] makes me want to love him all that much
[58:40] more look at Jonah and I don't have time
[58:42] to get into it tonight but we've talked
[58:44] about it before we went through the Book
[58:45] of Jonah here a couple years ago Jonah's
[58:47] sitting there in a Well's belly he don't
[58:49] realize what's going on he he doesn't
[58:51] even have an inkling of a clue what's
[58:53] happening in his life
[58:55] but God is moving mountains moving
[58:57] kingdoms God is doing things Beyond
[59:00] Jonah's understanding because Jonah
[59:02] would have never went to Nineveh and he
[59:04] went the opposite direction but he had
[59:06] to go the opposite direction he was just
[59:08] playing into God's plans by going the
[59:10] opposite direction and brother B said
[59:12] the Jonah be by taking the permissive
[59:14] will of God he actually made the perfect
[59:16] will of God more perfect I don't even
[59:18] understand that but it's still true that
[59:21] God knew he would do it and so God
[59:22] caused him to be spit out by a way so he
[59:25] could go tell a story to Nineveh and so
[59:27] the ninevites would hear it and Believe
[59:30] come on because the ninevites had to
[59:31] believe cuz they had to capture Israel
[59:34] again they would raid Israel again they
[59:36] would capture Samaria and the Samaritans
[59:38] would be there there had to be a woman
[59:40] at the well don't you understand what
[59:41] God was doing there had to be a woman at
[59:44] the well and there would have never been
[59:45] if Jonah hadn't preached to
[59:47] Nineveh right good very good we went
[59:50] through that in the scriptures sir we
[59:53] don't even comprehend that Jonah never
[59:55] knew it yeah you imagine what that
[59:58] conversation's like in
[1:00:01] heaven if she understands that and I
[1:00:04] guess she probably
[1:00:06] does the reason I existed is because you
[1:00:09] went and you didn't want to go and you
[1:00:13] went the wrong direction but I want you
[1:00:15] to know Jonah that everything was in
[1:00:16] God's plan all the time amen I want you
[1:00:20] to know that it was okay I want you to
[1:00:22] know that because you because you went
[1:00:24] to Tarsus instead of going to Nineveh
[1:00:26] God made it work out so I could be born
[1:00:30] in
[1:00:31] Samaria there's a direct
[1:00:33] link now
[1:00:36] look said if I Ascend into heaven you're
[1:00:39] there if I if I make my bed in hell
[1:00:42] you're there if I take the wings of the
[1:00:43] morning and dwell in the uttermost parts
[1:00:45] of the sea even there shall thy hand
[1:00:47] lead me and thy right hand shall hold me
[1:00:48] if I say surely the darkness shall cover
[1:00:51] me even the night shall be light around
[1:00:53] me yeah
[1:00:55] ye the darkness hideth not from thee but
[1:00:57] the night shineth as the day the
[1:00:58] darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:01:01] thee for thou H has possessed my
[1:01:05] Reigns Reigns in the Bible if you go
[1:01:07] look in the scriptures Reigns is is the
[1:01:10] the seat of your emotion it's your heart
[1:01:12] it's it's what makes you do what you do
[1:01:15] right right you don't understand why you
[1:01:17] are what you are and why you do what you
[1:01:20] do and maybe we'll get into it more on
[1:01:21] Sunday you don't understand but it's a
[1:01:23] lot of its genetics right yeah so Reigns
[1:01:26] in the Bible is like
[1:01:29] genetics it's your it's your motivation
[1:01:31] it's why you do what you do
[1:01:33] unconsciously why you look how you look
[1:01:36] and the Bible says you have
[1:01:39] possessed my Reigns in other words you
[1:01:43] you possessed my DNA yeah and made it
[1:01:47] the way you wanted
[1:01:49] it now look what he says it's so
[1:01:51] precious thou Hast covered me in my
[1:01:54] mother's
[1:01:55] womb thou H has covered me in my
[1:01:59] mother's womb so in other words he said
[1:02:02] you protected me personally before I was
[1:02:07] born now you think about that and you
[1:02:09] look back and say well brother Ben my
[1:02:11] life my life's been messed up and I
[1:02:13] understand I'm not trying to minimize
[1:02:15] the damage that's been done in your life
[1:02:17] I'm not trying to minimize the things
[1:02:18] that are going on with you right now and
[1:02:20] I say that to all of you and to each of
[1:02:22] you because every one of us deals with
[1:02:24] things that we would rather not deal
[1:02:25] with and we'd rather not talk about and
[1:02:27] every one of us has things going on and
[1:02:29] we think well what does this have to do
[1:02:30] with me but remember that before when we
[1:02:33] were in our mother's womb don't you know
[1:02:34] if he covered you there that he's
[1:02:36] covering you today he got a hold of your
[1:02:39] reins today if he actually took interest
[1:02:42] in your DNA to make you what you are
[1:02:44] today what more how much more is he
[1:02:47] taking interest in you today as a son or
[1:02:49] daughter of God that's manifesting the
[1:02:51] word yeah that's good amen you protected
[1:02:55] me personally before I was born he said
[1:02:57] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:03:00] and wonderfully made notice he he
[1:03:03] doesn't say I I was I was an
[1:03:07] accident I'm made I'm not an accident
[1:03:11] I'm created I'm not a
[1:03:13] mistake amen I I I I am a masterpiece
[1:03:18] yes sir if you go look at what brother
[1:03:20] Bram taught us and identified
[1:03:21] masterpieces of God you'll find Not only
[1:03:23] was Christ his Masterpiece but the bride
[1:03:26] is as
[1:03:28] well listen Psalms 139:15 my substance
[1:03:31] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:03:34] secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:03:37] lower parts of the earth when I was made
[1:03:41] notice the language it's
[1:03:43] intentional it's not
[1:03:45] like you know while my parents got
[1:03:48] together and maybe you don't even know
[1:03:50] your parents and I'm so glad the blood
[1:03:52] of Jesus covers all of that today you we
[1:03:55] don't live under the law sir some sir I
[1:03:59] don't want to say the word that comes to
[1:04:00] mind but some uh stupid people I guess
[1:04:04] I'll say
[1:04:06] it think the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:08] couldn't
[1:04:10] cover the wrong kind of a birth brother
[1:04:13] brand said that was the way it was that
[1:04:14] back then that they couldn't come in the
[1:04:16] in the house of the Lord for so many
[1:04:17] generations but now the blood of Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ covers
[1:04:21] that and we know he oh my look God knew
[1:04:25] that was going to happen you said well
[1:04:26] it was just an accident it was just even
[1:04:28] a the product of something terrible but
[1:04:31] yet God knew it that's why we don't ever
[1:04:34] life is
[1:04:36] precious we don't ever do away with life
[1:04:39] life is is difficult to get here in the
[1:04:41] first place we definitely don't want to
[1:04:43] get rid of it I look Thine Eyes did see
[1:04:47] my substance yet being unperfect in thy
[1:04:50] book all my members were written amen I
[1:04:54] love in thy book all my members were
[1:04:57] written which in continuance were
[1:04:58] fashion when as yet there was none of
[1:05:00] them so when it was just a cell when it
[1:05:02] was just barely
[1:05:06] conceived said you already had what I
[1:05:09] would look like written in your
[1:05:11] book before it even became
[1:05:14] that verse 17 how precious also are thy
[1:05:20] thoughts so now David's going back even
[1:05:22] further he's taking us back until we
[1:05:24] were just a just a gleam in our father's
[1:05:27] eye just just a a seed in the womb of
[1:05:30] our mother he's taking us all the way
[1:05:32] back there and then he takes us farther
[1:05:34] back he said how precious are thy
[1:05:37] thoughts unto me oh God how great is the
[1:05:41] sum sir of them yes sir see he's gone
[1:05:45] back way farther into God's mind which
[1:05:47] is eternal he said if I should count
[1:05:50] them they're more in number than the
[1:05:52] sand when I I awake I'm still with thee
[1:05:58] see he didn't start protecting you when
[1:05:59] you were conceived do we believe the
[1:06:01] word tonight do we do we really believe
[1:06:04] this can we can we make it personal can
[1:06:06] we say this is me this is what God did
[1:06:09] for me cuz that's what he said he did
[1:06:11] for you I don't want to call him a
[1:06:13] liar this is what he did for me this is
[1:06:17] what he did for you this is how he
[1:06:19] builds you yeah right the individual
[1:06:24] you were not just a protected in your
[1:06:27] mother's womb but you were a protected
[1:06:31] thought from
[1:06:34] eternity right God had lots of thoughts
[1:06:37] CU he knew everything that would happen
[1:06:39] but you were a protected thought yes sir
[1:06:42] see he told Israel he said I know the
[1:06:43] thoughts that I think towards you
[1:06:45] thoughts of peace and not of evil you
[1:06:47] are a protected you were a protected
[1:06:50] thought and are a protected thought in
[1:06:52] the mind of God yes look at Ephesians
[1:06:55] 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our
[1:06:57] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:06:59] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:07:01] places in Christ according as Heath
[1:07:03] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:07:07] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:07:09] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:07:12] predestinated someone say
[1:07:14] predestinated he has predestinated us
[1:07:17] unto the adoption of children now that's
[1:07:20] where I want to take you is I want us to
[1:07:22] go through this process and see how he
[1:07:24] builds us up to the adoption of children
[1:07:26] but you you got to go back to the
[1:07:28] beginning you got to find out who you
[1:07:29] were to understand who you are you got
[1:07:32] to have a revelation of who you were to
[1:07:34] know who you are so here we were in the
[1:07:38] thoughts of God he has chosen us with
[1:07:40] him within him within himself that we
[1:07:44] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:07:46] him in love he has predestinated us unto
[1:07:48] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:07:51] to himself according to the good
[1:07:53] pleasure of of his will I want you to I
[1:07:55] want you to understand tonight that you
[1:07:57] don't want to give up you can't give up
[1:07:59] why because there's something inside of
[1:08:01] you that recognizes you're going to be a
[1:08:03] full-blown son or daughter of God one
[1:08:05] day you young men sitting on the front
[1:08:07] you're going to be and what I mean by
[1:08:08] that is you're going to be able to
[1:08:10] manifest the word and overcome the
[1:08:12] challenges that face you in life you're
[1:08:14] going to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:16] Ghost you're going to be you're going to
[1:08:19] you're going to manifest the word why
[1:08:21] because he said you
[1:08:22] would yes you said but I made a mistake
[1:08:26] well you knew that
[1:08:31] too right yes sir I just want us to
[1:08:34] thoroughly understand this we don't want
[1:08:36] we don't need to be shaky in these times
[1:08:38] the Bible says everything that can be
[1:08:40] shaken will be
[1:08:43] shaken and you sure don't need to be
[1:08:46] living on the whims of a pastor or
[1:08:50] living on the whims of an evangelist or
[1:08:52] living on the whims of today I feel good
[1:08:54] and tomorrow I feel bad right come on
[1:08:57] now right you realize and I'm just being
[1:08:59] open with you and honest tonight you
[1:09:01] realize when our worship changes based
[1:09:03] on our circumstances of life right that
[1:09:06] actually and I know it does even for
[1:09:08] myself like a something's going on but
[1:09:11] but but I I I always want to come back
[1:09:14] to the house of God and have the same
[1:09:16] kind of worship towards God no matter
[1:09:18] what's going on right but it does it
[1:09:20] does affect us but why does it affect us
[1:09:22] because we don't really
[1:09:24] understand who we are in God because we
[1:09:26] we we ought to be unshakable our worship
[1:09:28] should not change because in fact look
[1:09:32] look is he less worthy today than he was
[1:09:35] when you worshiped him before is he Le
[1:09:37] oh God is he less worthy then when you
[1:09:40] got saved is he less worth no he's not
[1:09:42] any less worthy he's the same God today
[1:09:45] as he is in a meeting he's the same God
[1:09:47] tonight as he was when you got saved
[1:09:50] sir but you don't understand what I'm
[1:09:52] going through you need to understand
[1:09:53] understand less about what you're going
[1:09:56] through you really do quit dwelling on
[1:10:00] it and praise
[1:10:02] God yes sir CU you can't change it
[1:10:06] anyway I told Joel that I've come to a
[1:10:09] place in my life where uh what I want to
[1:10:11] do what I want to know about a situation
[1:10:13] is what I can change about
[1:10:15] it right and if I can't change anything
[1:10:17] about it there's no point in dwelling on
[1:10:21] it right and so what are we going to do
[1:10:24] we've got to get to a place where we
[1:10:26] realize that God you're in control of
[1:10:28] these things there's so many things I
[1:10:30] can't what I can do I will do what I
[1:10:32] I'll go to church I'll serve God I'll do
[1:10:35] my best but I can't make my my kids
[1:10:37] Christians I can't make my these young
[1:10:39] people I can't do that but I know he can
[1:10:42] I know he called them before the
[1:10:44] foundational world and I believe it by
[1:10:45] the same faith it took me to be saved I
[1:10:47] believe my children can be
[1:10:50] saved but I can't make it happen but you
[1:10:53] change things you can change you're
[1:10:55] trying to make you you're you're trying
[1:10:57] to change big stuff and there's little
[1:11:00] stuff you could change it gets left
[1:11:03] undone while you're trying to change the
[1:11:07] world right and we spend so much time on
[1:11:09] Fox news or CNN or whatever your
[1:11:12] preferred uh uh whatever your Preferred
[1:11:16] channel from hell
[1:11:20] is
[1:11:21] right I that's what it is
[1:11:24] is it's a news speed From Hell from
[1:11:28] Satan's Eden that's what it
[1:11:30] is right but here we have a news feed
[1:11:32] from Heaven that says that I'm the
[1:11:35] economy is going down the that news feed
[1:11:37] says everything's going to Pieces but
[1:11:39] this news says I'm a Child of God I'm a
[1:11:42] son of a of a king I'm going to make it
[1:11:45] amen I'm going to live in that City one
[1:11:47] day I'm going to be there one day that's
[1:11:52] Lord
[1:11:54] so he says he has made us accepted in
[1:11:57] the Beloved in verse six and it says
[1:12:00] we've obtained an inheritance in him in
[1:12:01] verse verse 11 being predestinated
[1:12:04] according to the purpose of him who
[1:12:06] worketh all things someone say all
[1:12:09] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:12:13] and we
[1:12:14] know that all things all things work
[1:12:18] together for good it doesn't say all
[1:12:20] things are good but all things work
[1:12:22] together for good
[1:12:24] to them that love God to them who are
[1:12:26] the called according to his purpose for
[1:12:30] and we got to read the rest of it for
[1:12:32] whom he did for know he also did
[1:12:35] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:12:38] image of his son he did not predestinate
[1:12:40] you to be uh uh as brother as brother
[1:12:43] Andrew says a helpless hopeless kind of
[1:12:45] person he predestinated you to be a
[1:12:48] child of
[1:12:49] God right he predestinated you to live
[1:12:52] he predestinated you to adoption and you
[1:12:54] say but brother Ben I'm afraid that if I
[1:12:57] try to live the message that my family
[1:12:58] will be all messed up and everything no
[1:13:00] you just believe the word live the word
[1:13:03] God will take care of the rest of
[1:13:05] it
[1:13:07] good now look so now look look what Paul
[1:13:12] says look at the reasoning that he uses
[1:13:13] and it's so it's such Common
[1:13:16] Sense moreover whom he did
[1:13:19] predestinate then he also
[1:13:21] called whom he called them he
[1:13:24] justified whom he
[1:13:26] justified them he also
[1:13:29] glorified why because they were
[1:13:32] predestinated they were called because
[1:13:33] they were predestinated they were
[1:13:35] Justified because they were
[1:13:36] predestinated they were glorified
[1:13:38] because they were
[1:13:40] predestinated verse 31 what shall we
[1:13:42] then say to these things other words
[1:13:44] what should our attitude be towards
[1:13:47] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:13:51] against us that's good not who will be
[1:13:55] because many will be but who can
[1:13:58] be amen many will be but who can be see
[1:14:05] this is your
[1:14:06] beginning this is where he started
[1:14:08] building you yeah this is the real you
[1:14:13] and I want to know the real me come on I
[1:14:16] don't want to be stuck in my past I
[1:14:18] don't want to be worried about my future
[1:14:21] I want to know the real me I want to
[1:14:22] know there's something Beyond brother
[1:14:24] Mark this old flesh that fails and and
[1:14:26] does everything that wrong that it could
[1:14:28] do if you just in life every day brother
[1:14:30] B said we we sin every day because we we
[1:14:32] fail to do things we should do the sins
[1:14:35] of omission we sin every day we do
[1:14:37] things maybe we say something or do
[1:14:39] something that's wrong but yet he loves
[1:14:40] us anyway I want to know who I really am
[1:14:43] I don't want to know I know this body of
[1:14:45] Flesh got to be dissolved I want to know
[1:14:47] who's the real
[1:14:48] me and he tells us in his word if God
[1:14:51] before us who can be against this
[1:14:54] brother Brandon says it this way did you
[1:14:56] know that you're being here never
[1:14:57] originated just as a myth or a thought
[1:14:59] everything was all pre-planned by God so
[1:15:02] it wasn't just God thought about you in
[1:15:05] in a in
[1:15:07] a can't use too big of a word for
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:12] Joel I'm searching for a smaller word
[1:15:16] it's not that he thought about you like
[1:15:17] in a free market capitalistic way like
[1:15:20] like he just let things go there's a
[1:15:23] word for that but I won't use it because
[1:15:24] I'm afraid I'll pronounce it
[1:15:26] wrong he just let it go you know no it's
[1:15:31] it's pre-planned
[1:15:32] right right it's pre-planned the Our
[1:15:35] God's economy is not a an Economy based
[1:15:40] like ours is and should be on
[1:15:43] capitalism but it's actually based on
[1:15:46] planning it is a planned economy that
[1:15:50] actually works now planned economy don't
[1:15:53] work for us and the reason they don't
[1:15:55] work is because we can't control things
[1:15:59] right they may have the best intentions
[1:16:00] but they can't control the outcomes and
[1:16:02] you've all heard of Chaos Theory where a
[1:16:04] where a butterfly flapping its wings in
[1:16:06] South America can cause a typhoon in
[1:16:08] Asia somewhere and and and and they've
[1:16:11] proven that just a little atmospheric
[1:16:13] change can cause such a difference
[1:16:15] everything you do makes a difference in
[1:16:16] the world around you and so you can't
[1:16:18] predict even the weather very far out
[1:16:20] why they give you a 5-day forecast and
[1:16:22] it ain't very ACC
[1:16:23] accurate and so you you can't predict
[1:16:26] what's going to happen down the road but
[1:16:28] I'm telling you we serve a God who knows
[1:16:30] not every not just the big things but
[1:16:32] every little
[1:16:33] thing listen brother brand said the
[1:16:35] infinite God knowed and to be infinite
[1:16:38] he had to know every flee right think
[1:16:42] about it for a minute he knew every flea
[1:16:46] that ever would be in the
[1:16:49] earth there's probably been a billion
[1:16:51] fleas bite your dog if you have
[1:16:56] one think about it for a minute there's
[1:16:59] been I know there has been our dog he
[1:17:01] has to take a pill because of fleas I
[1:17:04] don't know how that works he takes a
[1:17:06] pill because he's allergic to fleas it's
[1:17:07] pretty bad to be a dog that's allergic
[1:17:09] to
[1:17:12] flee just he's just
[1:17:16] worthless he's allergic to fleas but God
[1:17:19] knows everyone that ever B him along
[1:17:22] with all the other 400 million dogs on
[1:17:24] our
[1:17:27] block God knows sir amen oh do we
[1:17:31] believe that tonight he knows he knows
[1:17:34] every flea that would ever be in the
[1:17:36] Earth how many times it would bat its
[1:17:38] eye all right he said that's infinite
[1:17:41] our little Minds cannot fathom what
[1:17:42] infinite means the infinite God he knew
[1:17:44] all things therefore there is nothing
[1:17:47] someone say nothing there is nothing out
[1:17:49] of cater nothing out of you said but my
[1:17:52] situation right now is out of cater do
[1:17:54] we believe the word or do we
[1:17:56] not there is nothing out of cater we may
[1:17:59] think it's out of cater we may be
[1:18:01] sitting in a whales belly and every
[1:18:03] which way we look is whales belly but
[1:18:05] Jonah said I'm going to worship you I'm
[1:18:07] going to turn my face toward the temple
[1:18:09] I'm going to cry out to God because I
[1:18:11] believe he's a god of Miracles I believe
[1:18:13] he's a God that can change my situation
[1:18:15] you may have symptoms all over the place
[1:18:17] but you're not in the whale's belly but
[1:18:19] even if you were you could believe God
[1:18:21] would bring you out
[1:18:25] I think Jonah realized that the very God
[1:18:27] that kept him alive as long as he had
[1:18:28] been alive in the whales belly could get
[1:18:29] him out of the whales belly and I guess
[1:18:32] you need to realize at some point in
[1:18:33] your life that the very God that's kept
[1:18:35] you alive to this point is going to get
[1:18:36] you out of
[1:18:38] here right oh church that ought to give
[1:18:42] us comfort and strength tonight to know
[1:18:44] we're going
[1:18:45] somewhere nothing out of cater sir
[1:18:48] brother BR said now we're a part of God
[1:18:49] you always was you don't remember it
[1:18:51] because you were only an attribute read
[1:18:53] in God you were only in his thinking
[1:18:54] your very name that ever ever was on the
[1:18:56] book of life it was put there before the
[1:18:58] foundation of the world he knew what you
[1:19:00] were he said I'm saying this not to mix
[1:19:02] up Doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:19:04] that we might get away from this fear
[1:19:06] and
[1:19:07] scare you don't know who you are he said
[1:19:10] you are not going to be but now you're
[1:19:11] the sons of God you always were the sons
[1:19:14] of God for when God had you in his
[1:19:16] thinking at the beginning you have to be
[1:19:17] some part of you your life that's in you
[1:19:19] now had to be with God before there he
[1:19:22] said when he before he even became
[1:19:23] material here on Earth before there was
[1:19:25] anything but God you were one of his
[1:19:27] attributes he knew what your name would
[1:19:31] be you ever not like your
[1:19:34] name he knew what it would
[1:19:37] be he knew the color of hair you would
[1:19:41] have we may have never seen it in its
[1:19:43] natural color but he knows
[1:19:48] it right and you think about that and
[1:19:50] I'm seriously though I know I'm not
[1:19:53] preaching about hair coloring but think
[1:19:54] about it for a minute he knows the color
[1:19:57] of your hair it means he meant for
[1:19:59] you to be what you
[1:20:02] are that ought to give us great peace I
[1:20:05] know I'm taking it slow tonight but I
[1:20:07] hope we understand
[1:20:10] it that ought to give us great peace not
[1:20:13] knocking you for coloring your
[1:20:15] hair I'd color mine there's not enough
[1:20:17] left to color
[1:20:21] it
[1:20:23] but he knew what
[1:20:26] color he's got mine
[1:20:29] counted that's a project right
[1:20:32] there wonder how many angels he's got
[1:20:34] assigned to that
[1:20:37] one he could do it all
[1:20:41] himself he knew he knew all about you
[1:20:45] all right no matter how well you know a
[1:20:47] person you don't know everything
[1:20:50] right you don't know everything about
[1:20:53] the person you're married to you may
[1:20:54] have been married for 50 years and still
[1:20:56] you might get surprised
[1:20:58] sometime you don't know everything
[1:21:01] because there maybe there was things
[1:21:02] they forgot they went through before
[1:21:04] they met you that you don't even know
[1:21:06] about them oh my but he knows yes he
[1:21:12] said the only thing happened he said is
[1:21:14] when you being a sinner he said many of
[1:21:15] you can fellowship with me on this
[1:21:16] thought when you was a little boy or
[1:21:18] little girl you'd walk around there
[1:21:19] would be certain things that would just
[1:21:21] wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed
[1:21:22] like there something you that cried
[1:21:24] out see and and what what the devil's
[1:21:27] doing now is he's labeling us different
[1:21:29] and we were different it's called The
[1:21:31] Seed of
[1:21:34] God but the devil wants to label us as
[1:21:36] something else try to make us give us
[1:21:38] some disease or something and some
[1:21:40] mental condition put us off over in a
[1:21:42] box somewhere don't let the devil
[1:21:44] provide the
[1:21:46] labels you're a seed of God he said it
[1:21:50] seemed like there was something in you
[1:21:51] that cried out there was God somewhere
[1:21:53] yet you were a sinner you remember that
[1:21:55] certainly he said now what was that
[1:21:57] there was that little form of life in
[1:21:59] you then and then after a while you
[1:22:01] heard the gospel maybe you went to
[1:22:03] church you picked out this and that and
[1:22:05] went from denomination to denomination
[1:22:07] but one day amen we could say today
[1:22:10] maybe you went from Camp to Camp from
[1:22:11] meeting to meeting from church to church
[1:22:13] but one day you being part of God you
[1:22:17] had to be part of the word and when you
[1:22:19] heard the word you see why we preached
[1:22:22] the word
[1:22:23] because there just might be somebody
[1:22:25] sitting here tonight it's your time to
[1:22:26] hear the word for the first time to wake
[1:22:29] up that seed on the inside that your
[1:22:31] journey can begin at least the part you
[1:22:33] know
[1:22:35] about
[1:22:36] good one day you're being part of God
[1:22:39] you had to be the word when you heard
[1:22:40] the word you knew where it came from you
[1:22:41] knew that that you you you knew that
[1:22:43] what was the truth he said you were
[1:22:45] always the seed was in you always the
[1:22:47] word seen the word that was in you that
[1:22:49] was before the foundation of the world
[1:22:51] saw the word and you come to it amen he
[1:22:54] told his Eagle Story how this the little
[1:22:56] eagle and I'm letting you go in just a
[1:22:57] few minutes you forgive me tonight but
[1:22:59] brother Joel gave me a little extra time
[1:23:00] so I got just a few minutes but that
[1:23:03] eagle story you remember brother bam
[1:23:05] told it how that the eagle was out was
[1:23:07] hunting its chick and they knew had laid
[1:23:09] another egg and here was a his chick had
[1:23:12] been put with a with a hen and here the
[1:23:14] hen the chicken is with the H being
[1:23:16] taught how to scratch like a hen how to
[1:23:18] click like a hen how to act like a hen
[1:23:21] but as it grew the more it grew the less
[1:23:23] hin like it
[1:23:25] was and the less it fit in around the
[1:23:28] hin and one day just at the right time
[1:23:32] aren't you glad that God rescued you at
[1:23:34] the right time I believe there's hope
[1:23:36] for our children There's Hope for our
[1:23:38] your lost loved ones there's hope for
[1:23:39] other people because you know that you
[1:23:41] were you weren't always tuned towards
[1:23:43] God but yet there was something there
[1:23:45] but one day you heard the scream of an
[1:23:47] eagle and it reminded you of something
[1:23:49] you'd heard that before you didn't
[1:23:51] remember because you were an egg form
[1:23:53] you were in thought form when you heard
[1:23:54] that word before but now you're hearing
[1:23:56] it
[1:23:59] again you realize you was in a thought
[1:24:01] in God's mind you're going to have to
[1:24:03] forgive me tonight you were a thought in
[1:24:05] God's mind when he spoke let there be
[1:24:09] light that was a thought
[1:24:12] too and that thought was there think
[1:24:15] about it you you oh my we can say it
[1:24:18] this way I know I know it's not because
[1:24:20] you you're a thought you didn't
[1:24:22] understand it but it's like it's as if
[1:24:23] you heard the word of
[1:24:26] God you had heard it before and when you
[1:24:29] heard this
[1:24:31] message you didn't hear the voice of a
[1:24:33] man but you heard the same
[1:24:37] voice glory to God yes
[1:24:40] sir boo
[1:24:44] devil you heard the
[1:24:46] same word you
[1:24:50] heard it's a thought good
[1:24:54] think about that for a minute how you
[1:24:55] know you think I'm
[1:24:56] crazy
[1:24:58] look God by his for knowledge knew all
[1:25:01] things he said there's that word flashes
[1:25:03] out there he said that that's the way it
[1:25:05] is with every Born Again believer that
[1:25:06] word flashes out and there's something
[1:25:07] takes a hold you come to it he said you
[1:25:08] were once dead in sin life as as he
[1:25:11] quickened he said we were predestinated
[1:25:13] to be Sons and Daughters of God you who
[1:25:14] are once dead in sin and trespasses he
[1:25:17] said wherein we all had our times pass
[1:25:18] but hath he quickened he said look at
[1:25:20] Paul when Paul was a great Theologian
[1:25:22] when he come face to face with that word
[1:25:23] Jesus it quickened he come to life right
[1:25:26] quick because he was ordained to be that
[1:25:29] Paul talks about how his lifestyle I
[1:25:32] have don't have time to read it tonight
[1:25:33] in Galatians chapter 1 you can read it
[1:25:35] starting in verse 14 but he says this
[1:25:37] how that he was exceedingly zealous of
[1:25:39] the traditions of his fathers he said
[1:25:42] but when it pleased God Amen when it
[1:25:44] pleased God who separated me from my
[1:25:47] mother's womb you said but I've been in
[1:25:49] the message for years I've been around a
[1:25:50] message church for years but when it
[1:25:52] pleased God Paul heard about the gospel
[1:25:56] but he had never met Christ he had heard
[1:25:59] the gospel and he said this he did what
[1:26:01] he did in ignorance because he'd never
[1:26:03] that seed had never been awakened but
[1:26:05] when it pleased God who separated me
[1:26:07] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:26:10] his grace to reveal his son in me he
[1:26:13] said I didn't confer among Flesh and
[1:26:14] Blood he said I went up to Jerusalem to
[1:26:16] them which were I didn't go up to
[1:26:17] Jerusalem but I went into Arabia and
[1:26:19] returned again into Damascus what was it
[1:26:21] the word heard the
[1:26:23] word and when he come back he was
[1:26:25] preaching the same word though he'd
[1:26:27] never been taught it he was part of the
[1:26:29] word when the word saw the word it was
[1:26:31] his nature he said all the clucking of
[1:26:33] the hens and the Orthodox Churches
[1:26:34] didn't have no effect on him he had seen
[1:26:36] the word it was part of him he was an
[1:26:37] eagle he wasn't a chicken he was just in
[1:26:39] the barnyard with them but he was an
[1:26:40] eagle to begin with brother Brandon
[1:26:43] tells a story about the duck and I
[1:26:44] preached a message on it here a while
[1:26:45] back you remember it was can you smell
[1:26:47] the water can you smell the water he
[1:26:50] said the duck was out there with the
[1:26:51] hens and it was just it was just
[1:26:54] clicking around with the hens doing
[1:26:55] whatever the hens do do and uh and it
[1:26:58] was just clucking with the hin and when
[1:27:00] it did that it was just it was just out
[1:27:02] there he said but one day it got out
[1:27:04] around back of the Barnyard and it
[1:27:06] caught a whiff the wind turned in the
[1:27:07] right direction and it caught a sin of
[1:27:09] water he said it went straight for the
[1:27:11] pond as fast as it could go why it was
[1:27:13] born to be in water there was something
[1:27:15] inside of it that made it want the water
[1:27:18] more than anything else oh church that's
[1:27:20] the way you come to God that's the way
[1:27:22] he built you there's something inside of
[1:27:24] you even though maybe in your mind
[1:27:25] you're thinking well I'm bored I
[1:27:27] shouldn't be here but there's something
[1:27:28] inside of you that is smelled the water
[1:27:31] and if you can smell the water you can
[1:27:33] be
[1:27:34] saved right
[1:27:37] good
[1:27:41] look I don't have time to get the rest
[1:27:44] this
[1:27:45] Sunday
[1:27:47] look R said you become part of
[1:27:51] God we
[1:27:53] were we were unbelievers right we did
[1:27:58] everything an adult can
[1:28:02] do everything a kid could do if you're
[1:28:04] saved as a child we did we did it all
[1:28:08] for the
[1:28:09] equivalent and Paul says such were some
[1:28:11] of you but you're washed you're
[1:28:16] Sanctified but you know sometimes we get
[1:28:20] complexes in our minds and we think well
[1:28:23] I'm just not good enough I done too much
[1:28:25] and I've never really had that smell the
[1:28:29] water
[1:28:30] moment heard that eagle scream because I
[1:28:33] just heard it in
[1:28:35] church devil will beat you up about that
[1:28:37] look what brother brandom tells a woman
[1:28:39] named sister Bruce that got in that same
[1:28:42] condition are you still with me tonight
[1:28:43] I got maybe five more
[1:28:47] minutes brother brandom says sister
[1:28:50] Bruce says but I've never had had an
[1:28:52] experience that I've been filled with
[1:28:54] the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot
[1:28:56] on and he responds this way he said all
[1:28:58] right notice this ordinarily a human
[1:29:01] being is born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:29:05] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:29:06] the nature of a human being Sister Bruce
[1:29:09] said yes that was your
[1:29:12] nature it changed once what changed it
[1:29:17] Christ there you are
[1:29:20] sister that's how he builds you
[1:29:23] you you used to be a sinner and I
[1:29:25] fellowship with some of you about that
[1:29:27] but you
[1:29:28] changed what was it you said what
[1:29:30] happened for me down at an altar and I
[1:29:31] cried and spoke in tongues that's
[1:29:33] wonderful I believe God does that that
[1:29:35] way for a reason but for others maybe
[1:29:37] they don't necessarily have that same
[1:29:39] type of experience but yet they still
[1:29:41] have been
[1:29:43] changed look and you someone say you
[1:29:48] someone say
[1:29:49] me you happy Quicken
[1:29:52] me hath he quickened can you say that
[1:29:55] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[1:29:57] where in time past you walk according to
[1:29:59] the course of this world but God
[1:30:01] Ephesians 2:4 who is rich in Mercy for
[1:30:03] his great love where with he loved us
[1:30:05] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:30:07] quickened us together with Christ has
[1:30:08] raised us up that in the ages to come he
[1:30:10] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[1:30:12] grace from his kindness toward us
[1:30:14] through Christ
[1:30:16] Jesus brother brandom talked to a man
[1:30:18] who had been gone from church to church
[1:30:20] looking for something one day he'd been
[1:30:22] a car dealer and there ain't much
[1:30:24] forgiveness for
[1:30:27] that he was on the car lot and someone
[1:30:29] left a give him a card said where will
[1:30:31] you spend an eternity and made him think
[1:30:33] so he starts looking he goes to the
[1:30:34] Baptist Church the Methodist Church
[1:30:36] Pentecostal church and he just never
[1:30:37] felt like he had
[1:30:39] it and he said went to Brother Bram
[1:30:42] Pentecostal told him well go to brother
[1:30:43] Bram he's a prophet he can discern your
[1:30:44] life and tell you what you need to do I
[1:30:46] love the way brother Bram discerned his
[1:30:48] life he he he come to me said what do I
[1:30:51] need to do brother brother random he
[1:30:52] said not a
[1:30:55] thing hey man he said nothing you can do
[1:30:59] I said you told me for the first 40
[1:31:01] Years of your life you didn't care about
[1:31:03] God but you picked up a little piece of
[1:31:04] paper and said where will you spend
[1:31:06] eternity and something said that's got
[1:31:07] to be settled you couldn't get over it
[1:31:09] he said now you were going down the road
[1:31:11] this way all at once you started back
[1:31:13] this way you didn't care for God you
[1:31:15] started back hunting for him oh my I
[1:31:17] remember what that was like he said you
[1:31:19] started back cutting him I said right
[1:31:21] there where you made your turn where you
[1:31:23] made your turn do you remember what the
[1:31:24] turn was like where you made your turn
[1:31:27] right there where you made your turn
[1:31:29] that's exactly what changed you right
[1:31:30] there he said then I've had it all the
[1:31:32] time I said certainly glory to God he
[1:31:36] said well praise be to God he said it
[1:31:39] never started on any day listen it never
[1:31:43] started on any day you wasn't saved on
[1:31:45] any day you was always saved Jesus just
[1:31:48] come to redeem that but you was saved
[1:31:50] from the beginning because you had
[1:31:51] eternal life to begin with do you
[1:31:54] believe it tonight musicians go ahead
[1:31:56] and come I want to close with
[1:31:59] this how many of you have ever counted
[1:32:04] steps got a wrist watch I did that for a
[1:32:08] while and the kids stole my watch
[1:32:11] disconnected it from my phone now it's
[1:32:13] missing but the thing lied anyway I walk
[1:32:16] more than
[1:32:19] that think said I was lazy
[1:32:25] if you count steps you know what I'm
[1:32:26] about to
[1:32:27] say see you do that for fitness and you
[1:32:31] know you can you know you can cheat
[1:32:33] maybe I shouldn't tell you that depends
[1:32:36] on what you're wearing I guess how high
[1:32:37] takech your equipment is but you can
[1:32:38] cheat on that right it you know you can
[1:32:41] kind of you get to a place where you can
[1:32:43] shake it or put it in your pocket you
[1:32:47] know do something with it I I some of
[1:32:50] y'all done that hav
[1:32:53] you did you realize God counts your
[1:32:57] steps you know
[1:32:59] that job said that he said does he not
[1:33:02] see my
[1:33:03] ways and count
[1:33:05] all my
[1:33:08] steps that little thing you wear on your
[1:33:10] arm that watch could be wrong but he's
[1:33:13] never been
[1:33:14] wrong he counts your steps and he
[1:33:17] doesn't do it to be judgmental and wake
[1:33:18] up in the morning say you didn't get
[1:33:20] enough steps yesterday
[1:33:23] he counts your steps because he cares
[1:33:25] about
[1:33:26] you and he knows how many steps it takes
[1:33:30] to get you from here to there he he do
[1:33:33] right when Enoch W when Enoch walked
[1:33:36] with
[1:33:40] God this came to me today and it just
[1:33:42] just blessed me when Enoch walked with
[1:33:45] God God knew exactly how many
[1:33:48] steps it would take Enoch from the
[1:33:51] moment he's started walking with God
[1:33:52] until the end of his life and he walked
[1:33:55] home he wasn't guessing Enoch didn't
[1:33:59] know he had no clue but God did can I
[1:34:04] tell you tonight God knows your
[1:34:06] steps he sees your steps and I see
[1:34:09] people get so out of sorts and upset and
[1:34:12] and you don't realize we go everybody
[1:34:14] goes through stuff what's the difference
[1:34:16] between a steady Christian who's
[1:34:18] grounded on the word it's not that they
[1:34:19] never go through anything but the Danny
[1:34:21] but it's because they know that they
[1:34:23] have a rock they know there's something
[1:34:25] that that has a hold of their life they
[1:34:27] know that there's something and I'm
[1:34:28] going to praise God anyway I'm going to
[1:34:30] worship him anyway I'm going to live for
[1:34:32] him anyway no matter what happens in my
[1:34:35] life God is building me he is taking
[1:34:38] care of me he's counting my
[1:34:42] steps how he's building you the
[1:34:44] individual began his thoughts will you
[1:34:47] believe that tonight you are not a
[1:34:49] victim but he counts your steps you are
[1:34:51] a Victor greater is he that is in you
[1:34:53] than he that is in the world would you
[1:34:55] stand with me tonight and bow your
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:02] heads
[1:35:04] maybe maybe we just need to thank all of
[1:35:06] us I want to ask for a show of hands we
[1:35:09] just all need to
[1:35:11] think we just don't give God enough
[1:35:15] credit it counts my
[1:35:20] steps he knew how many steps I would
[1:35:23] take today why I would be this way and
[1:35:26] who I am all of my character
[1:35:30] flaws everything about me he knew and he
[1:35:34] let me be the way I am for a
[1:35:37] reason Lord help me to be content in the
[1:35:41] state that I'm
[1:35:44] in and to know that it's not the end he
[1:35:47] knows how many steps between now and the
[1:35:49] Rapture how many steps between now and
[1:35:52] your between right now and your healing
[1:35:54] he knows how many steps between right
[1:35:56] now when your kids come
[1:35:58] home he knows how many steps when your
[1:36:01] children receive the Holy Ghost he knows
[1:36:03] let's just let him handle it can we can
