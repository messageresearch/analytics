Lord I believe that it can come to pass even tonight Lord that the symptoms will begin to leave and people begin to worship you for that Lord for some it's not sickness physically but maybe just a little cold in spirit or maybe you had a hard day at work but Lord I pray you'd help us to put all that aside and just let you speak to speak to we want to hear from you lord your voice matters to us oh God lord we we take a lot of time to hear from all kinds of people but Lord tonight we want to hear from you move me out of the way Lord don't let me say the things that I would say but what you would have to speak Lord oh how we want to feel your love expressed through your words Lord God or do you want to tell us how much you love us and or even in correction Lord sometimes that well that's how you show us that you love us we're so thankful Lord God oh we love you tonight thank you for this people Lord I pray that you've bless them abundantly for coming out to the house of God lord May there be Revelation and peace and joy in their hearts when we leave thank you for it oh we thank you for loving us Lord [Music] amen Revelation chapter 6 and verse 5. I'm going to go into maybe my favorite of the four horse riders the third seal I really enjoy this sermon if you haven't heard it on tape recently I encourage you to go back and listen to it the third seal remember we'll have two services on Sunday and for the Allen's finances class as well on Sunday afternoon we'll have services uh in Galena Missouri starting Friday night the 22nd and if any of you could go I know it's a little ways up there but they really showed up for our meetings so I know some of you planning on going so if you can go even if it's just for one night I'm preaching Saturday morning and Sunday morning so you know what services to avoid if you want to uh if you want to do that my brother Daryl Ward will be preaching on Friday night and Saturday night so the Lord willing and uh so we're looking forward to that and just being with those folks and then brother Josh Martin will be here for those of you that can't go for two services that Sunday and so I'm sure you're looking forward to that but Josh is a wonderful preacher and a singer as well maybe he'll sing for you because he just had a baby so at least he's not expecting one this time so hopefully but Josh if you're listening or you listen to this later that uh you'll uh you'll show up this time so kind of an inside joke between us amen let's go to Revelation six and five and says we need to open the third seal I heard the third be say come and see and I'll be held and low a black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hands and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine but Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated I thank the Lord for the presence of the Lord we feel here this evening I believe that each one of these seals are relevant today maybe none of them more than this one as each one of these Powers these horses as the Bible calls this brother Branham says that each one of these horses ride out into eternity and so these powers are still around today but I thank God for an anointing to combat that power that we still have today as well now brother Branham gets right into it and if you're following in the seal book it's around paragraph 250 is where we're going to jump in so brother ran them extensively backgrounds the third seal and then just in the last uh 30 minutes or so the tape he gets really into it uh into what the seal actually is but there's a tremendous background we're getting a little bit of that and then the seal so brother Brian said the lamb opens another seal another one of the living creatures like a man so remember there was the the lion the ox the man and the eagle this is the living creature like a man that said come see remember whenever the enemy does something the spirit of the Lord raises up his standard against him and that's what's happening in this age when this was taking place and he said when he does there come a rider on a black horse he said this this writer let's discuss him if you'll notice the first Rider who he was we found out last night scripturally that the second rider was exactly the same man only he was on another horse he said what happened he changed his ministry we found out he was an antichrist he changed his position you can see him as he begins to ride and then he's crowned and then he becomes and he gets off his white horse rides his red horse and he takes a sword in his hand and now he gets off his red horse and he rides his black horse so brother Branham tells us that this black horse is about the time of the Third Church age when he gets off and he begins to write so that is the time remember you can't look at the seals exactly like you do the church ages but it just gives you a reference point as this thing begins to happen now he begins to write and and there were three stages before Satan became incarnate he was the Antichrist he was the false prophet he was the Beast now brother random typed that and said the church went through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you had Antichrist false prophet Beast Incarnation right justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost where are we living at tonight we're living in the age of the Incarnate God we're living as brother Brandon put it in a play on words he said incarnate men hey man that's the age that we're living in I believe that's us tonight that's the bride he wants to he wants to Avail himself behind the bride in this day so he said the writer this writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage a white horse see he he was just a teacher just an antichrist teacher well we've seen him in that form before haven't we even in our age we've seen him he's just a teacher he was against the word of God and brother Branham defines Antichrist here it's a wonderful definition he said now how can you be an antichrist if you were going to say I remember there is an incarnate Antichrist but how could you be an antichrist he said anybody someone say anybody that denies that every word of this isn't true and to be taught just the same is an antichrist because they deny the word and he is the word so they are against the word by saying that the every word isn't true and that it's not to be taught just the same don't you see where every Spirit of false doctrine that we're Believers here tonight every Spirit of false Doctrine that's ever come in this message everything that even that that maybe affects you personally every little false thing that comes along every little Antichrist Spirit what does it do it exalts itself against the word by not teaching what the word teaches by saying well that's not for us anymore we don't have to do that anymore maybe that was just for brother Brown's time maybe that was just for another age maybe that was just for the early church don't let him do that to you whatever God said is still true we believe that tonight so an antichrist denies the word by saying well we don't do that anymore the days of Miracles has passed no more preachers no more you see what that spirit is maybe on good people but it's an antichrist spirit right so now he said First Stage White Horse He was just a teacher but an antichrist spirit in its Doctrine and its quality that's important it was an antichrist spirit and he's not in this stage he wasn't incarnate so the people even that carried this Spirit were not necessarily Antichrist people you understand but They Carried an antichrist spirit and it's important to separate that brother said we're not against the people we're against the system right so we don't treat people bad say well you're an antichrist he's an antichrist they're Antichrist no you're identifying the the doctriness against the word that's what the Antichrist is he said it was innocent it couldn't hurt nothing seemed like just go on he said that's the way Satan comes in right and just like he did Eve in The Serpent and and remembers we're going through this where I'm moving through as quickly as I can so when brother Brandon would go off he'll he'll talk about even the serpent and we're just moving right through that but you can listen to that on the tape read it in the book now this spirit this Antichrist Spirit he said watch this Antichrist Spirit rise up amongst the early church a doctrine of nicolaitan Nico conquer the laity make a holy man and so the spirit produced denominations right that's the nicolating spirit was the Antichrist spirit in the early church that produced an unscriptural Dogma placing man over man facing Bishops over uh over pastors right and that was the the original Antichrist we don't answer the headquarters of any kind we answer to Christ and so you said my brother Ben you preach it may be a little bit different than other pastors or or this other Pastor you know you're not preaching maybe what someone else is but I'll say this there's more similarities than you realize because I believe God's got a bright all over the world whose preachers are preaching the same thing but it's not because somebody told us to it's not because you've got somebody sending out literature and telling us this is what you preach on this week it's because you get the mind of Christ and that's what we strive to do so this Spirit produced denominational Logistics which could not be churches because brother Brandon said there's only one church and that's the mystical body of Jesus Christ he said and you're born into that by predestination all right so you were predestined to be born you're predestined to become a son or daughter of God and look at this he used the scripture John 6 39 this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all someone say all oh which he has given me I should lose nothing Hallelujah well that ought to give you courage tonight that ought to that'll give us Faith tonight I'm going to make it I'm going to be all right no matter what comes against me what can separate me from the love of Jesus Christ of all he has given me I will lose nothing yes sir oh do you love him tonight so now he says but should raise it up again at the last day so everyone who was predestined to be born will be in the resurrection thank God for that so same writer now he said this first stage he was innocent and second now if you want a little bit higher a little more to that more than they said the second stage the Bible said he'd be given a crown that he crowned a man a Superman and then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet he said of course he must be a false prophet by his his Antichrist Spirit the Antichrist against the original word he said now when he did that what did he do then he Satan took his political power which he was already over now we've established that right Satan is over every Kingdom this one that's why things happen like they do the devil someone said the devil's in the details but he is he's in every yeah it's the system it's a it's not going to be like this in heaven it's not gonna be like this during the millennium the reason things that run like they do we don't want to get too used to the way things run every it's a devil now we got to learn how to well we've got to live we we got we're a part of this world but we're we're going to be in this world but we're not going to be of it in other words We're Not Gonna We're not gonna be like it we're going to be like the word amen but we do have to live here well we have to learn here we have to learn how to uh the Bible says be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove we've got to learn how to do those things and yet recognize that this world is controlled by Satan and so anytime you you know you get stuck in an airport overnight or or you get to you see all the things that happen you know you get out of hearty sometimes things begin to happen you know you begin to realize it's not just Hardy that's controlled by an antichrist Spirit but it's the whole world it's controlled by an antichrist system the whole thing well it's fixing to go down into a tribulation period and then go ah and then be destroyed but we're not going down we're going up so he said when you see these things happen look up your Redemption draweth night so he said Satan took his political power which he was already over took the religious power he had already been crowned put them together so the Nicene Council then finally resulting in the doctrine of purgatory which took them several hundred years actually to get everybody in line where they could begin to teach Purgatory but finally they did he said now his great power comes he was made Victor of heaven and worshiped as God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth give him a crown over that right that's what you don't expect too much from the politics of this Earth because he already had that and he has religion too right he has the church I'm glad I'm part of the Bride I'm glad there's been a distinction with Harvey made in my day I'm glad there's a difference between the church and the bride because he's ruler of the church nominal again we're not talking about the people we're talking about the system Revelation 13 2 the Beast which I saw was like to a leopard his feet was the feet of a bear his mouth is a mouth of a lion and where to get his power and authority the Dragon Satan gave him his power and his feet his position and great Authority he said now brother Brandon's going to get into this now he said now I have to say this just the way it come to me and then if it comes to me now look look how brother Branham did if it come to me and didn't compare with the rest of the scriptures then God never give it scripture has to agree with scripture and anything is contrary to the scripture listen he said if that angel of the Lord told me anything that wasn't scriptural I wouldn't believe him that's pretty powerful isn't it if the angel of the Lord he said that angel of the Lord the one who told him all these things but I'm glad that he didn't I'm glad he found it in the word many times he said the angel would come to him he said and tell him what it was and he'd go in the scripture and find it right and so it wasn't by his own effort the angel brought it to him but it had to match up with the scripture he said scripture has to agree with the scripture if the angel Lord told me anything it wasn't scriptural I wouldn't believe him he talks about the Chicago Ministerial Association and how they dragged him in there and began to question him on the godhead and so God had explained I believe it's the tape if you go and listen to it you can see how brother Brandon deals within me deals with them very kindly but he said if you can disprove it come Stand By Me if you can disprove it by the scripture he said I don't want to deal with your theologians he said bring the scriptures and disprove it and they couldn't do it right and and so uh even they said well we'll be baptized but they never showed up to the baptism why it wasn't who they were but I'm glad it's who I am I'm glad that my the the desire that's in me matches up with the word of God so but they told him they said we'll believe it if the angel told you isn't that interesting they told him I said if the angel said that it's to baptize the name of Jesus Christ we'll believe it he said I can't believe you'd be fooled by something like that see if the angel come to you and told you say well I had a dream I had a vision those things are wonderful but don't take that over the word God's primary method of dealing with us is always always the word of God and sometimes it seems like well God does not speaking to me like he usually does I'm not hearing in a supernatural voice like maybe I have in the past but remember even in the times when he is silent his silence speaks volumes because he is already spoken in his word and sometimes he wants us to grab a hold of the word that's right in front of us and go do the word go live the word become Lord he said he don't show us prophets everything but he he causes them to make decisions for themselves because he wants you to grow in the character of Jesus Christ now but the brown said here's the mystery of this he said and when it revealed to me early this morning before daylight I went quickly to the scripture and began to look search it up I love that he said now here is the mystery of the black horse according to what it was revealed to me he has started writing him in the time of the Dark Ages that's what the Dark Horse represented the Dark Ages now listen to this it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left a time of midnight in fact you couldn't even identify a group of True Believers there were so few during this time it was literally one here one over there a little group over here there was no organized Church of True Believers during the Dark Ages everything had been taken under the control of this Antichrist system and he tells them out there in one of the church ages he said you got you have a little strength left a little strength left he said practically all hope had been taken from the true church for this fellow controlled both church and state what are they going to do now I told you that these seals are relevant to today we need to recognize this that this even happens today part of Satan's job in his power as a in this black Court's power this ability that he has to make you hopeless to make you hopeless to make it so dark remember that it wasn't just the middle the Dark Ages that were dark have you ever seen the way the angel of the Lord Drew out the church ages it was not here there was a little there was there was there was dark there was light and then it got darker and darker and then it got lighter and lighter but in the labor to see an age what happened it got dark again brother Brandon said it was a complete blackout and he only left just a little bit of light for the sake of the Bride right oh my see we live in that hour a time like that when Satan controls the church and state and you don't recognize it but it's true he controls the whole system now look look how hopeless it would have been for them who lived during that age he said all didn't agree with Catholicism was killed that's the reason he was on a dark horse he just controlled everything he gets off his red horse of going slaughtering people gets on his Dark Horse where he controls every detail of their lives that's what he still wants to do today I thank God for the message of the hour which is a message of Deliverance in a time in a time of total blackness in a timing of gross Darkness since the Bible said be gross Darkness on the people that's the age we live in Gross Darkness on on your workplace growth starting us on the schools gross Darkness on the churches but during that time he set a rise and shine for thy light has come the age that we live in oh that ought to make every one of us rejoice amen look it was just hopelessness of the Dark Ages he said Catholicism had taken over he said now watch all hope was gone that's his black horse you think he still don't ride that today hopelessness now think about that for a minute so we go on here he is on his black horse now coming forth Dark Age I couldn't do nothing without the Catholic Church snuffing it out every little Revival he stamped on it yes every little move of God he put him in prison yes threw away the key he could excommunicate them take away their their life take away their livelihood take away their money he could do whatever he wanted to yeah he was in control he says they've gotten power he said just about the time the church got set up and got empowered they smothered out everything else he said now there is your Dark Horse representing that Dark Age now all Hope's gone no hope at all everything looked dark for the little believers his balances or his scales in his hand you see calling out measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny he said see actually that is we and barley is the natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff is made from but you see he was charging for this so now watch he said what it means is that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was sending out to them so he was making them pay for Darkness it was a spirit of Darkness that in order to have any glimmer of hope now brother Madam taught us about America he said America is like a a little boy whistling going through a graveyard right makes you pay for comedy hey come on church maybe you pay for the kind of hope listen to me he's trying to do the same thing today makes you pay to have any kind of entertainment try to make you pay to have any kind of Hope in your life or other other words you're just going to work going to church going home right he's got control of everything can't seem to get my healing can't seem to get right he started making them pay making them pay for prayers charging for prayer they still do it now that Spirit still exists today you've seen it on TBN haven't you send me a 50 donation and I'll send you this book cost me 50 cents to print or I'll send you this little trinket for 50 bucks or 500 bucks whatever it is what was it paying for a hope you sold this seed you'll get something back in that layout of seeing now I believe in sowing to see you can get something back I believe in that biblical principle but but we're not listen there's no force in it that there's no there's nobody's going to come to your door and knock on your door if you don't pay your ties maybe I shouldn't have said that but nobody's gonna come knocking nobody it's voluntary right there's no Force to it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna quit praying for you because you didn't pay your tithes you didn't pay the right offering I'm not going to treat you any differently are you with me now because we don't charge for the hope of life now watch he was starting at that very time of making them pay for prayers charging for prayer they still do it no Venus what's interesting if you go if you look on the iTunes app store if you go on there and look at the app you can get a Catholic app a novena's app they still charge for it to get the good ones all right they have little novenas you can say they're free they said but if you want the good ones that'll really help get them people out of purgatory right right then you got to pay for it pay extra give me that Spirit of charging you don't charge I hope you understand this you really there was a there's a fundamental problem if we start charging for the message we don't do that don't charge for Hope of life we financed what we can't even this church we're not going to start begging you for money to build new a new church or or two or to do anything like that we're not going to beg you for money to do that if we have the money we'll do the very best that we have with the money we have but we're not going to start charging for the hope of life well brother man liking that he said they said well you know we could save the world if we had enough money he said that's not the truth nobody all God needs is a man in his hand if you just get one man in his hand he could go to the part of the world that there's a predestinated seat in and he began to it began to change that and and that one will come in at the right time so we do everything we can with what we have but we don't charge for nothing because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world the scale weighing out measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny Rider on a black horse she he was stripping his subjects of their money listen he said brother Ben you've just been typing this no I haven't he said you see where that old money taken in church comes from said get away from that stuff to build an organization now what he's what's he talking about he's not talking about offerings brother Brown instead of service wasn't complete without an offering he's talking about that getting up I've been there in denominational Church to say who will pledge 500 and and who who'll pledge a thousand and stand there and just beg and beg it was the biggest part of the service he said you see what that oh where that old money taking Church comes from get away from that stuff to build an organization a big something million dollar here he said you see what the mother of it is he was charging for that kind of a life that he was given to his subjects charging for Prayer by the priests to pray people out of purgatory charging now look that's what a novena is it's a prayer when you say it it it it gives them a little relief and if you could be good enough and say it enough and pay enough you might get them out of Torment because the Catholics do not believe that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin they believe that everybody has to go to a place Between Heaven and Hell because nobody's good enough to go to heaven and so that everybody has to go for the doctrine of purgatory come from because they realize people aren't living it well you can't live it without the spirit of Christ and the truth is we don't rely on your own Works to get into heaven anyway you rely on the blood of Jesus Christ you're justified by faith alone but the Catholic Church said well no one's going to have to get into heaven so there must be a place Between Heaven and Hell where they just stay in that state until somebody down here Works them through it because they didn't do enough work themselves and he said somebody have to charge for that bring the wealth of the world to him into himself into the church itself and he is still writing he said oh sure he is yes sir still writing but I thank God for a voice because in the middle of that darkness in the middle of that Dark Age a voice spoke out Hallelujah Revelation 6 6 I Heard a Voice sure I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts I Heard a Voice in the midst of the 4B say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now brother Branham oh my brother Branham taught us that the oil symbolizes the spirit are you still with me tonight if the Holy Spirit Leviticus 8 12 is one of the references he poured the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him zechariah's Vision where he talks about how that the oil was flowing to the golden pipes and he answered and speaking to me this is the word of the Lord unto cervable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord so this is the spirit of God you've talked about the foolish and the wise virgins Matthew 25 3 they that were foolish took their lamps took no oil with them but the wise took all in their vessels with their lamps he said now oil typifies spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation all in wine in the Bible he said is associated together always you find that if you go put oil and wine into a search engine brother Branham didn't have that he looked it up into concordance but if you took oil and wine together in a search engine and just put it together you'll find all kinds of references will come up including Joel 2 23 he said be glad then you children who died and rejoice in the Lord your God he hath given you the former Reign moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month the floors should be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil right so they would be restored now and it's that way off to the scripture he said when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints how many Saints do we have here you say oh brother Ben I'm not a saint you don't understand what a saint is a saint is a Sanctified one how many Saints do we have here you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb amen and so when it's been revealed to his Saints it's filled with oil they all get stimulated oh yeah now I know one has a different effect on some people than it does on other people but they all get stimulated he said Gloria I feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts he said well we don't need that anymore oh you don't need the stimulation of Revelation you must not feel the darkness of this age pressing in on you but I Heard a Voice it said don't hurt the don't hurt the wine don't hurt the oil amen and so he said the the truth of the promise word has been revealed they all get stimulated stimulated with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of the truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him love the way brother Brandon but it says behave himself unnormally so whichever way you would act normally you don't act normal anymore you begin I don't care who you are if you get it if you get enough of the wine you begin to behave yourself unnormally all right take some of this real quiet maybe they maybe they start talking somebody that talks all the time maybe they get real quiet maybe somebody oh start crying maybe somebody gets real joyful but it's just something it does to you it just takes you out makes you comfortable takes you out of yourself don't you see it's stimulation of Revelation he said that's right makes them behave themselves unseemingly and he says see that's what's the matter with them right now and why he said that is because people were shouting yeah huh go listen to the tape so he begins to talk about the upper room and he talked about how that when they went into the upper room he said they he said if you want a scripture for it it's Acts 2. and he said if you go into the upper room and and they begin to tell one another well I believe we've stayed here long enough we've been here seven days I think that's long enough I I think we're good message Believers so we can say it that way I think we're we're okay we just go on out and preach I think it's time we just went out and preached but he said Peter had the keys to the kingdom he said not yet boys he said wait until wait until and so so he said you stay here until you stay there until Joel's prophecy comes to pass until Isaiah's prophecy is Vindicated so you stay and you wait on the promise of God and then you begin to see the Vindication of that of what God promised in the age that you live in Isaiah 28 11 for which stammering lift and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear so what is it here would come a people where this rest would come this refreshing would come he said what is wine in the Bible refreshments this is the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord so you see wine represents stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen the fire of God fall upon them mine that begin to stimulate them I think you know I've heard it said that if you if you sing if you sing a song Run That lyric through through your brain first I wonder if we don't need to run it through our hearts the blood will never lose its power the hell ought to stimulate somebody he is our peace who has broken down every wall that ought to stimulate somebody Amazing Grace how sweet to sound it saved directs like me that ought to stimulate a response it's a revealed truth oh he didn't say it had to be some deep dark mystery but just revealed truth that's relevant for the age you live in revealed truth I see it sometimes I get so happy when I see you come to church because you are the revealed truth of the of the day I see Christ manifested in your life and I see you in the house of God and it makes me happy I begin to get stimulation because I see the revelation of God in your life when I see young people grow up and get married and start to serve God with all their heart yeah they have their ups and downs but we begin to see Christ identified in that couple what are we doing cause stimulation cause us to have joy because in all the ups and downs of Life somebody's representing the truth somebody is living the word of the hour I don't believe our services should ever be dull because if it's no you don't understand the word yeah that word that we have you don't understand the god that we serve you don't understand what time it is in the history you don't understand the darkness that's all around you but you don't understand the light that you have should never be dull there should be a stimulation of Revelation on the believer Hallelujah he said wine represents stimulation Revelation when the Holy Ghost fell they seen the fire of God fall upon them he said my that began to stimulate them the first thing you know they got so stimulated to the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by the Revelation he said my God here it is God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them they was happy about it God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them amen he said here was a man standing there saying this is that God always used a man he never used a mechanical device he used a man to stand at the word of the hour and say this this is that this is that what you are what the word said you would be and when the when you see that when you see it begin to come to pass it stimulates you God promised it amen God promised it here was revealed to them and Vindicated to them amen God promised me my children I see it as a revelation it brings joy to my heart God promised me my my healing I see it as a revelation even before the symptoms leave I see it as a revelation it brings joy to my heart when the Revelation opens up to me God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them here was a man standing there saying this is sad this is it and there it was being Vindicated by the same sign that we have today the Holy Ghost is still here Hallelujah okay Peter boldness he walks out there and he begins to preach Hallelujah he said oh you men of Judea he was scared to death before he was saying he wasn't even one of them but now he began to preach he said you crucified Christ but there's hope there's a way out he said oh how wonderful revealed revealed they become so stimulated when they seen it Vindicated he said that just always does that someone say always such that always does when I see that God promised to do a certain thing in this day he said he promised to break off these seals in this last day and you don't know the joy the glory when I seen him reveal this stand there and watch it happen he says in his search field he said he said I started to run and said I like to wake up wake up all the neighbors when he showed him early in the morning what it was why it was a promise of God being fulfilled and here I see it Vindicated made perfectly right you hear me say I feel religious he said that's what's the matter the stimulation is so bad I just about ready to go cutting up you know stimulation from Revelation they become so stimulated over the Revelation listen that they Vindicated the promise [Music] so the stimulation was part of the promise I hope you hear me now you say well it's word only it is but the word said yeah the word said that that his Spirit would fall young men shall prophesy old men shall dream to all those things the word said that we could have her healing the word said we could have joy the word said that's part of the word and the stimulation they received actually worked to fulfill the word and Vindicated the promise in them hallelujah amen oh I love it he Vindicated the promise in them now watch he said oh my they broke out the joy of stimulation to the people said they're drunk on new wine when God revealed his promise to them not only did he reveal it but he proved it yeah look at the woman at the well oh my now look look at the woman at the well and and he said then the stimulation started and and he talked about how Jesus come to her and he told her about to he told her what was wrong with her he told her the revelation of her life he revealed to her the revelation of the word and then she said I perceive you're a prophet she said when Messiah comes he's he's supposed to do these things and he said I had to speak to you and he what did she do she got some stimulated she ran that's what the Bible says he said away she went shouting yeah glory to God she didn't go like a Baptist forgive me if you're Baptist tonight man she didn't walk back here Oh Our Father you know well good message today Levi go home think about it for a while that's so wonderful wasn't that wonderful just no shook hands with somebody on that wonderful it's not what she did she ran she went away shouting and she went down through the city he said now she left her old water pot her old denomination yeah I went down there and said to the men come and see now brother Brian said if you only knew the Eastern tradition he said that's wrong for her to do that maybe we got some of them Eastern Traditions today if you knew the Eastern tradition that's wrong for her to do that he said yes to a woman of that time nobody would listen to her she should not make a commotion she should stay in the background that's what they said she should say he said no sir she she had a mark and if she would go down the street like that and act like that the men of the street would pay no attention of her but brother she had a Word of Life there she was stimulated it was like trying to put a house out on fire on a windy day he said oh there's something fan on it she was ready John Wesley told his young preachers they said well how should we preach he said you just get so on fire for God two people come from miles around to watch you burn people go look at the fire don't they you see a great big fire you stop you slow down you want to look and see what it is amen she got so on fire hey but she wasn't a preacher but she was the first one to witness the gospel in that town she'd come to them and she said come see a man who told me all the things that I ever did hey man he said you couldn't put that out that was God's fire burning she said if you don't believe it he said you just come over here where the meeting is going on I'll show it to you and so the men went out there he said he didn't now listen listen to this you'd say well if I if I saw brother Branham appear Discerning the secrets of the heart then I believe oh Church Brother Francis he did it one time never did it for the men he just did it for her you realize that entire group of Samaritans remember he said it had to come to the Jews the sign of the Messiah had to be shown to the Samaritans had to be shown at the end time to the Gentiles right but the entire group it was shown once once was enough for the Samaritans I'll say it like this once is enough for me if it had only been one time but it wasn't one time it was thousands and thousands of times today everybody's like well if you just say a word if I could just get a word of discernment for me no I believe God could do that but don't you realize what's been done he said he did it one time he didn't do it one more time but they knew something that happened to that woman she would change so they believed him brother Paul that's that's the greatest testimony of this message I was changed so they believe him you want people to believe you want your kids to believe the message I was changed so they believed him I remember the JT's not here tonight but I I remember brother JT when he was much younger I love that man I I love all of you but but JT and I have been close been through a lot and I remember his son one time Steve who passed away in a in a tragic automobile accident but their son Steve had had told me he would help me move he'd come to church for a little while and then he quit and he was helping me move and I was talking to him about his soul I said Steve I said why don't you come back to church I said we we love you and we'd like to see you back in the house of God he said you know he said I just don't want to come to us right I said I don't want to be a hypocrite I said well we're all Hypocrites on some level it's hard to live you know just legalistically you got to trust in the blood of Jesus I was telling him these things and and he's telling me he said well he said you know he said I tell you what he said I want what my dad had called him dad his steps and say I want what dad had he said because when Dad married my mom said he was a drinker he was he would he would do all those things he said but I saw the day he got saved he'd come home and everything changed he was old enough to remember everything changed he said if I ever come to Christ he said I want what dad had yeah I said God help us today if we're changed people will believe it people will believe him I believe he's in glory today I believe the Lord took him home he had a hard time had a hard time living it I believe the Lord took him home I've seen God do that many times God promised us our children he didn't say how promises they'd be there and I believe it but they knew say he knew something happened to JT because he wasn't that kind of person naturally I pray that my kids can see something happen to me I was never a drunkard I was never out there like that but I pray that they could see that the message has changed me made me a new person made me different oh I pray it's done something for you that your children can see that others can see they were still they were she was so stimulated by she was so changed about him she was changed so much that they believed him they believed on him she was so Changed by the revealing of the son of man the word that's what the revealing of the son of man is the discernment was only the sign of the son of man but the revealing of the son of man is the word is the opening of the word the fullness of the word she was so Changed by the revealing of the son of man word she was so stimulated by the message that they believed it oh you know they're not going to care about it if we don't care about it but if you care about it if you carry it with you if you become part of it if it becomes your life they care about it it'll produce something in your life Faith cometh by hearing hearing the promise of God the word of God watch it being made real because it's a seed when it's sowed it'll take life it'll produce just what it's talking about he said then what does it say to this writer in Black don't you hurt my wine and my oil and we're closing I know I've gone a little bit long on Wednesday but thank you for thank you for staying with me he said oh I've just got a little bit of it down there but there's still a little bit there amen he said now you can go on through and measure out all that kind of life that you're putting out that's up to you you're going to pay for it down there when you come across that wine in oil you leave it alone you said in other words like this if you catch some of my little flaw that's filled with my oil and wine see wine and all of the pure word and you're going to kill them because you're doing it that's what he was doing in that age he said they know where they're he said don't you force him to say hail Mary or do anything like that or some of your creeds keep your hands off of them they know where they're going for they are anointed with my oil and by being Anointed with my whole they have the wine of Joy because they know my Word of Promise I'm going to raise him up again I've thought about it before how that they would Gather in the catacombs and they would be hiding from the church not hiding from a Roman Emperor anymore but hiding from the church it must have been difficult to understand must have been difficult for him as their mothers and fathers and little babies everything else was taken and slaughtered and they gathered together in the catacombs and said and maybe you know wouldn't be like us gathering together so-and-so's not here today he's sick think about it together but John's not here today they killed him last week sister so-and-so was fed to the Lions imagine what kind of prayer requests you'd have in the early church think about it for a minute here's a little sister sitting there her husband's locked up somewhere she don't know if he's gonna be okay here's little brother and yet there was Joy Indescribable unexplainable Joy said by the bed I've been going through a lot but yet there's joy why is there Joy why is there joy unspeakable and full of Glory in a time when there's Darkness everywhere in a time when it seems like the that Beast system that Antichrist system controls everything how can you have joy because a voice spoke yeah a voice spoke into that age I'm talking about the voice of a man I will show you in just a minute a voice spoke into that age he said don't hurt the wine and oil just because you're sick doesn't mean he don't love you just because you know doesn't mean he don't love you anymore just because you have hard decisions to make doesn't mean he doesn't care He does care so he spoke into your age a word that would bring such an anointing on you that when it's because all of these things wrap up these things accumulate it's like a snowball it accumulates into our age all of the victories all of the overcoming all of the promises are accumulated in our age so we have the joy that they had when they were taken down to be to be burned at the stake how I could have joy it's kind of job they couldn't legally work they couldn't go to church legally they couldn't say that Jesus was God they couldn't be baptized if they were caught they did it anyway oh my yet they had the wine of Joy how do we know because he said touch not amen oh in the hours of my darkest struggle I'm so glad that the voice of the Lamb is spoken in my day and said touch not wine and the oil oh my he said they have the wine of Joy because they know my Word of Promise I'm going to raise them up again we find out he measured it out and charged for it exactly wheat natural life that's what they was living on symbolizing Spirit whole enjoy the wine that's spiritual life don't hurt that I'm so glad he leaves that for us you might be sick you might have troubles you might have financial trouble every other kind of trouble but he said don't touch the wine and the oil the things that really matter don't touch that did you notice that he said notice it was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil in the line oh my God who was it I Heard a Voice in the midst Hallelujah what was it the lamb he said it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said it why he's going to take his own that belongs to him he is redeemed it can I say it this way tonight he belong you belong to him you belong to him don't you touch that oil he said not the four beasts but the lamb was the one that said it there here was the voice of the Beast voice of the writer so many voices in our day the voice of Satan the voice of the voice of people the voice of the age but here was the voice of the Lamb saying don't you touch that aren't you glad for that tonight he said to the best of my understandings musicians come best of my understanding the best that I know of with all that I believe in my heart he said that's the true meaning of those three seals I want to thank God for him I'll say this that it's the Revelation he give me he gave that to me the revelation of it he said and I do believe we're living in the last days this message is not a man's idea I know I get criticized sometimes I criticize myself I read a lot I I preach a lot I just repeat what brother Brandon said this message come from the throne it didn't come it wasn't just brother Brandon's idea something he had an idea of I'm not talking about the voice of a man but there was a voice of the Lamb that spoke in the midst of the message a voice of predestination but David that we heard and somehow in spite of the darkness in spite of the failures of men in spite of the troubles that were going on all around us in spite of sickness in spite of trouble in spite of loss in spite of Darkness unexplainable unexplainable Joy but Harold say maybe you just don't grieve like other people maybe I know we grieve I know we have trouble but there's something inside there's a joy unspeakable and full of Glory Paul says we don't sorrow like others who have no hope There's Hope in the age that we live in because the lamb spoke I said don't touch the wine in the oil aren't you glad for the revelation of that third seal that's life to us message not a man's idea the message came from the throne when we realize that realize who we are that revelation will stimulate us to believe the word to live the word to rejoice in the word amen let's bow our heads together sorry I took long I well I wanted to stop at 8 20 we're right about there [Music] just so much there that we can say but I just maybe you experienced a little bit of that Darkness all these horses just ride out to the end seeing that deceiving that black horse maybe you've seen a little bit of that red horse that Force seen a little bit more of that black horse hopelessness [Music] all three of them are mixed together in a Pale Horse rides today in the fourth seal hopelessness that's what the devil wants to do to you he wants to back you into a corner and say well there's no way out you might as well just give up why would you hold to the message why even bother believing why bother living it he said brother big you never feel that way you get up in the pulpit and preach oh you you don't know many times many times almost on a weekly basis I lay there at some point and think I can't do this I just it'd be so much easier if I just give it up if I didn't bother but I hear the voice of the Lamb speaking into the darkness so don't touch the line in the oil [Music] in my darkest times in the in the hour and when it seemed like the whole world was gonna go I'm glad I have this message I'm glad I have the word of God that happened to my bible glad I have a church I can go to the midst of sickness and heartache and everything else I know some of you that are watching you you want to be in the house of God so bad and you can't be but remember he said don't touch the wine in the oil you can have the stimulation of Revelation right where you're at stimulation of Revelation that that comes in because of the holy spirit in your life the oil in your lamb why don't you just talk to him for a minute and just recognize that in your life say Lord I I believe I I'm not going to be taken in by the darkness I'm gonna let the joy of God no matter how hard it is I'm gonna let it shine through my life let it be a lamp and a light of the world that I live in Heavenly Father that's my desire tonight Lord Lord as a pastor there's so many ups and downs seems like churches go through times and ups and highs and lows Lord not live and die with the church many times but Lord I'm glad there's a reservoir there it's a reservoir of of Hope
