[47:59] nervous

[48:04] that i'll begin to wonder if they didn't
[48:06] like me but they showed up so
[48:10] but
[48:11] i sure do appreciate brother ben having
[48:13] enough faith to let me come back and
[48:16] preach to you all again i know you all
[48:17] pretty much know me and loving you and
[48:19] appreciate all you do for me and my
[48:21] family and
[48:22] i'm just going to go ahead and get into
[48:24] the word here for just a minute and like
[48:26] to pray right before we read
[48:29] if we just bow our hearts for just a
[48:30] second
[48:32] lord jesus father
[48:34] love you lord thank you god for another
[48:36] chance lord to be in your house god with
[48:38] your precious people lord
[48:40] god i thank you for those that went
[48:42] ahead and come out tonight lord that to
[48:44] support the word god knowing that i
[48:45] would be nervous lord but god they're
[48:47] not coming out to hear me lord they want
[48:50] to hear something from you father
[48:52] lord you just say anything lord just do
[48:54] it means so much more than i could ever
[48:56] do god
[48:58] lord this thought that's on my heart
[48:59] father i'm going to try to just do my
[49:01] best lord to move out of the way
[49:03] let you deliver this thought lord just
[49:04] commit it to you now in the name of the
[49:06] lord jesus christ amen
[49:09] amen if you have your bibles i'd like to
[49:12] turn to first thessalonians
[49:15] i think i actually put the 11th first
[49:17] but i want to start with the 13th i
[49:19] didn't mean the 11th so
[49:22] let's go first thessalonians 4 13
[49:27] and we'll start 13 and read all the way
[49:29] down
[49:31] just say man when you have your spots
[49:35] but i would not have you ignorant
[49:37] brethren concerning them which are
[49:39] asleep
[49:40] that you sorrow not even as others which
[49:42] have no hope for if we believe that
[49:45] jesus died and rose again even so them
[49:47] also which sleep in jesus will god bring
[49:49] with him
[49:51] for this we say unto you by the word of
[49:53] the lord that we which are alive and
[49:54] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[49:57] not prevent them which are asleep but
[49:59] abraham said that was hinder
[50:01] for the lord himself shall descend with
[50:03] from heaven with a shout with a voice of
[50:06] the archangel with the trump of god and
[50:08] the dead in christ shall rise first
[50:11] then we which are alive and remain shall
[50:13] be caught up together with them in the
[50:14] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[50:17] so shall we ever be with the lord
[50:19] wherefore comfort one another with these
[50:22] words i'd say those pretty comforting
[50:24] words
[50:26] let's go to hebrews 12
[50:28] and then we'll let you have your seats
[50:35] wherefore seeing we also arkham past was
[50:37] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[50:40] aside every weight and the sin which
[50:42] does so easily beset us let us run with
[50:45] patience the race
[50:46] that is set before us
[50:48] looking unto jesus the author and
[50:50] finisher of our faith
[50:52] who for the joy that was set before him
[50:54] endured the cross despising the shame
[50:56] and is set down at the right hand of the
[50:58] throne of god
[50:59] may the lord has blessings you may be
[51:01] seated
[51:03] i thought those were two very
[51:05] encouraging scriptures first is a
[51:08] promise something that's fixing to
[51:10] happen one of these days and actually is
[51:12] happening even now
[51:14] you know brother branham said that the
[51:16] the message was the shout that went
[51:18] forth and christ does all three while
[51:20] he's descending so the rapture is
[51:22] actually taking place that word rapture
[51:24] you won't even find in the bible it's
[51:26] just a theology term actually it's a
[51:28] catching away
[51:30] so we know that the catching away
[51:31] process is actually started right now
[51:35] and then
[51:36] we also have this great cloud of
[51:38] witnesses that prove that it can be done
[51:41] those that have received the holy ghost
[51:42] that we're not those that could be alive
[51:45] and remain that they've had to take
[51:47] their arrest but they're going to come
[51:48] up in the rapture just the same as any
[51:50] of us
[51:52] and i just want to read it says in the
[51:53] days of jesus of nazareth when he was
[51:56] here on the earth walking in flesh he
[51:59] found the people in his day seeking a
[52:01] religion
[52:02] that would bring them deliverance and
[52:03] that's kind of what i'm talking about
[52:04] here is convinced that the message is
[52:06] the truth
[52:08] he said he found people in his day
[52:09] seeking a religion that would bring them
[52:12] deliverance they wanted a religion that
[52:14] would deliver them from all their evils
[52:16] their enemies and christianity met every
[52:19] challenge they asked for
[52:21] christianity met everything they needed
[52:23] it was everything that they asked for
[52:26] it challenged every one of their needs
[52:28] but they would not receive it
[52:30] he said it's about the same way today we
[52:32] find people today like them seeking for
[52:34] a religion that will do something for
[52:36] them that will bring some reality to
[52:38] them
[52:39] and real true christianity meets every
[52:41] one of those challenges but they won't
[52:43] receive it
[52:44] he says i'm not speaking
[52:46] to the born-again church he said i'm
[52:48] speaking to the nation country in whole
[52:50] they don't seem to want it he says if
[52:52] you want anything you just can't rest
[52:54] until you get it now i wanted to
[52:55] emphasize on that if you want anything
[52:58] you just can't rest till you get it
[53:01] born again christians there's something
[53:02] there's an elect seed of god inside of
[53:04] you that you're just not going to rest
[53:06] because you know the message of the hour
[53:07] is the truth
[53:09] jesus said in the beatitude he said
[53:11] blessed are those that hunger and thirst
[53:12] for righteousness for they shall be
[53:14] filled
[53:15] if they hunger and thirst but you've got
[53:17] to hunger and thirst first
[53:19] you've got to want it first you've got
[53:21] to want christ
[53:22] not just going to church you've got to
[53:24] want christ
[53:26] he says today we're trying to give
[53:28] people
[53:29] something that they really need and they
[53:30] don't want to accept it they just don't
[53:32] want he said the attitude of the people
[53:33] hasn't changed and yet that is exactly
[53:36] what the world needs today is the
[53:37] religion of jesus christ i believe we
[53:39] have the religion of jesus christ
[53:41] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:42] that is the message of this hour
[53:45] deliverance from things that are
[53:47] fearing and dreading they have need to
[53:48] be delivered of
[53:50] in the days when he was here on the
[53:52] earth one of the reasons why they would
[53:53] not receive jesus of nazareth and
[53:55] believe him and get their deliverance
[53:57] was because it was too unusual for them
[54:00] he brought his deliverance god sent them
[54:01] deliverance and it was so unusual to
[54:04] them that they didn't want to accept it
[54:06] because it didn't come the way they were
[54:07] used to receiving religion
[54:10] you know this word to the world
[54:12] is unusual
[54:13] you go to tell somebody about elijah
[54:16] about malachi 4 and 5 luke 17 30. you
[54:20] know revelations 10 7 they might say
[54:23] what are you talking about a prophet in
[54:25] this day
[54:26] but it happened
[54:28] and there is a people that's elected to
[54:29] receive the message
[54:31] people look at you and say why do you
[54:33] dress the way you do why do you talk the
[54:34] way you do
[54:35] why do you believe for things that might
[54:37] seem out of the ordinary divine healing
[54:39] and such you know some churches don't
[54:41] even believe in that
[54:42] but there's an elect seed that believes
[54:44] god
[54:45] it's more than just going to a church
[54:48] brother brahm says are we really getting
[54:50] people to god or are we just getting
[54:52] them to the church we got to get them to
[54:54] christ
[54:55] where there's quickening power it's good
[54:57] to go to church sure but that's as far
[54:59] as you go it's not far enough
[55:02] when you come to church that's good but
[55:04] go on to christ
[55:05] from the church
[55:06] because we must receive this quickening
[55:08] power that baptism of the holy ghost is
[55:11] quickening power it's a life change
[55:13] he said if we ever expect to be in that
[55:15] general resurrection because the only
[55:17] thing that will ever bring us up
[55:19] from the dead for if that spirit that
[55:21] raised up jesus from the dead will in
[55:23] you it will also quicken make bring to
[55:25] life your mortal bodies
[55:27] what a promise
[55:30] so there's a reason we've got to receive
[55:31] this quickening power
[55:33] because we've got to get people to
[55:34] christ because there's a battle going on
[55:37] and if you don't have that quickening
[55:39] power you're sure to lose the battle
[55:41] so that everybody says come be a
[55:43] christian everything will be all right
[55:45] no sir not for a christian
[55:47] all that god live godly in christ jesus
[55:49] shall suffer persecution you're going to
[55:51] be laughed at you're going to make be
[55:53] fun of you're going to be stomped at
[55:55] kicked out made fun of if they called
[55:57] the master of the house beelzebub how
[56:00] much more will they call them of his
[56:01] disciples he said but i'll take the way
[56:03] with the lord's justifies few i've
[56:05] started with jesus and i'm going through
[56:08] i think that's the attitude of the bride
[56:10] we don't care to be laughed at we don't
[56:12] care to be scoffed at i don't care if
[56:14] people think that believing for a
[56:16] rapture seems so unusual the things the
[56:18] way that we dress the way that our women
[56:20] keep their faces clean keep the hair
[56:22] long the men the way they act around
[56:25] other people they don't crack the
[56:26] worldly jokes they have a godly life is
[56:29] because the holy ghost is inside them
[56:32] we'll take the way with the lord's
[56:33] despised few
[56:35] he said if i could only look down
[56:37] tonight here in this city for the last
[56:38] three months where i've been across the
[56:40] nation see the falling of the way of the
[56:42] churches the indifference of the pastors
[56:43] see the indifference among the people
[56:45] who come out looks like fishes and
[56:47] loaves the first thing got enough temper
[56:49] to fight a buzzsaw so indifferent nasty
[56:52] pentecostal people ministerial
[56:54] association wants me to draw me out of
[56:56] the ring just because i let a man on the
[56:57] platform that wasn't baptized the way
[56:59] they thought ought to be baptized such
[57:01] indifference he said
[57:02] if i was looking right there i'd give up
[57:04] he said but i'm glad god got a hold of
[57:06] me before the church did i found out
[57:08] about god that's right found out about
[57:11] god was real
[57:12] i think that's so important we're not
[57:14] supposed to have indifferences between
[57:15] us we're not supposed to tear each other
[57:17] down we need god to get a hold of us
[57:19] before the church
[57:21] you know people say i've been hurt by
[57:23] this message
[57:25] this message never hurt nobody this
[57:27] message was sent to deliver you this
[57:29] message was to make you free it's people
[57:31] that's hurt other people it's fanaticism
[57:33] that's hurt other people it's criticism
[57:36] but the message has not hurt anybody
[57:38] this message is christ to deliver you
[57:41] it's people that's got their eyes on
[57:43] other people that's idolized other
[57:45] people and then it tears them down
[57:47] but we need to get a hold of christ we
[57:50] need the holy ghost in our lives you get
[57:52] the holy ghost in your lives you're not
[57:53] looking to other people you're looking
[57:54] to christ you're looking to his word
[57:57] we don't need the message church to get
[57:59] a hold of us we need to be the message
[58:01] in the church
[58:02] no matter how much fanaticism there is
[58:05] there is a genuine truth and there is a
[58:07] genuine believer
[58:09] he says i want to say this on behalf
[58:12] many people not we wouldn't understand
[58:13] divine healing or critics of it we do
[58:16] not claim to be divine healers now
[58:18] there's a lot of fanaticism hooked up
[58:20] with divine healing he said there's a
[58:21] lot of fanaticism hooked up with every
[58:23] phase of anything you do in your
[58:25] churches there's people that's real
[58:27] fanatics religious fanatics but that
[58:29] don't mean that god isn't real that
[58:31] doesn't mean that there isn't a real
[58:32] true christian it only vindicates that
[58:34] there is a real one if you had a bogus
[58:37] dollar
[58:38] it'd have to be real sure fact that
[58:40] there was a real dollar
[58:41] the dollar that it was made off of is
[58:44] that right if it isn't the bogus dollar
[58:46] would wouldn't be there wouldn't be a
[58:48] real dollar the counterfeit but being
[58:50] there is a counterfeit it only speaks
[58:52] that there is a real
[58:54] and when you see somebody acting or
[58:55] pretending to be a christian it only
[58:57] means there's a real christian somewhere
[59:00] when you see someone in the practice of
[59:02] divine healing made in some fanatical
[59:04] way it only speaks that there's a real
[59:06] article somewhere that it's coming from
[59:08] that's right a pro and con negative
[59:10] positive true false in all things
[59:15] all god's children are going to suffer
[59:17] persecution
[59:19] and you know
[59:20] all god's children have been called may
[59:22] have seemed crazy may have seemed
[59:23] fanatical but they had the correct
[59:25] balance of spirit and truth you got to
[59:27] have both of them you can't just have
[59:29] spirit without truth you can't just have
[59:31] truth without spirit you have truth
[59:33] without spirit you'll be starchy but if
[59:35] you have only spirit you may seem
[59:37] fanatical it takes a balance and that's
[59:39] why the holy ghost is needed to provide
[59:41] that balance
[59:43] what we need is b is like that little
[59:44] woman with the blood issue that wanted
[59:46] to touch jesus brother ram said there
[59:48] was a little woman on that hill and
[59:50] spent all of her money with the
[59:51] physicians no doubt the physicians had
[59:53] done all they knowed how to do to get
[59:55] that woman well probably hebrew
[59:57] physicians and that was a hebrew woman
[59:59] so they had done all that they could do
[1:00:00] for that sister although that nothing
[1:00:03] would stop the blood issue
[1:00:04] which perhaps he says could have been
[1:00:06] menopause he said but she'd get so weak
[1:00:09] she could hardly get around anymore she
[1:00:11] had heard about jesus and when she seen
[1:00:12] that little boat pushing to the willow
[1:00:14] she went down to find out
[1:00:16] now listen he says a lot of critics was
[1:00:18] standing there he's not free of critics
[1:00:20] today
[1:00:21] they had known who he was they would not
[1:00:23] have been his critics
[1:00:24] but they was his critics because they
[1:00:26] didn't know who he was
[1:00:27] and that's the way with the message
[1:00:29] today so many good men and women
[1:00:31] criticize it because they don't know
[1:00:32] what it is
[1:00:34] the only way they're going to know what
[1:00:35] it is is when they see a life lived
[1:00:38] they can listen
[1:00:40] and you can preach them all day long but
[1:00:42] they need to see a life live that
[1:00:43] someone can actually live this message
[1:00:45] and if that seed is inside them
[1:00:47] something will quicken one of these days
[1:00:49] we don't ever give up on them you keep
[1:00:52] pressing for them we're not here to tear
[1:00:53] them down you know brother branham
[1:00:55] speaks just there's three types there's
[1:00:57] the unbeliever mate believer and the
[1:01:00] real believer
[1:01:02] you know but i'm not going to throw
[1:01:03] stones at the mate believer the
[1:01:04] unbeliever my goal is to get that mate
[1:01:06] believer unbeliever into being a
[1:01:08] believer i want to see him go in a
[1:01:09] rapture i don't want to see him miss out
[1:01:13] but we know that there is going to be a
[1:01:14] deception
[1:01:15] brother branham said there would be he
[1:01:17] said it'd be so close the bible speaks
[1:01:19] that would deceive the very elect
[1:01:21] that wouldn't be denominations the
[1:01:23] dominations wouldn't deceive the elect
[1:01:25] but listen to what he says in the god of
[1:01:26] this evil age brother jason our home
[1:01:29] home church our pastor he's been kind of
[1:01:31] laying in on this
[1:01:32] he said last week in matthew 24 it was
[1:01:36] the most deceiving age of all ages all
[1:01:38] the ages of deceit from the garden of
[1:01:40] eden all the way down there's never been
[1:01:42] an age so deceptive as this age false
[1:01:44] prophets will rise and show signs and
[1:01:46] wonders if possible to deceive the very
[1:01:48] elected see now just a cold formal
[1:01:51] starchy church and so forth of man-made
[1:01:53] theology that wouldn't the elect would
[1:01:55] never pay no attention to that
[1:01:58] but it's up there almost like the real
[1:01:59] thing
[1:02:00] just leaving out one word is all you
[1:02:02] have to do
[1:02:03] promise of the age a very great time
[1:02:05] christians everywhere take heed in the
[1:02:07] hour that we're living
[1:02:11] you know the prophet god says when the
[1:02:12] supernatural is displayed it does
[1:02:14] produce the three types it produces the
[1:02:16] unbeliever the believer and the mate
[1:02:19] believer you look down and you think of
[1:02:21] the time of moses there was pharaoh the
[1:02:23] unbeliever i believe it was janice and
[1:02:25] jamborees who withstood moses that make
[1:02:27] believer that could produce signs maybe
[1:02:28] even wonders but they had no word but
[1:02:31] then there stood moses with the word and
[1:02:33] he said let my people go
[1:02:35] here we had a prophet and all everyone
[1:02:37] was trying to impersonate his gifts
[1:02:39] things like that but there was a genuine
[1:02:41] prophet that said world satan you've got
[1:02:43] to let my people go there is somebody
[1:02:45] going to make the rapture
[1:02:48] but what would cause an unbeliever or a
[1:02:51] mate believer
[1:02:52] i think it's a lack of reality
[1:02:54] if you had reality if you experienced
[1:02:56] christ then you wouldn't how could you
[1:02:59] be an unbeliever or a mate believer if
[1:03:01] you could ever get a hold of who he
[1:03:02] really is and be born again
[1:03:04] you'd have to be a believer
[1:03:07] the unbeliever would denounce the
[1:03:08] message the believer might try to use it
[1:03:10] to benefit them but the believer holds
[1:03:13] on for the promise
[1:03:14] because we didn't deserve it anyhow but
[1:03:16] god chose us anyway
[1:03:18] god says jesus said no man can serve two
[1:03:21] masters rather he will hate the one and
[1:03:23] love the other or else he will hold to
[1:03:25] one and despise the other ye cannot
[1:03:28] serve god and mammon
[1:03:30] you can't hold on to two masters you've
[1:03:32] got to hold on to the lord jesus christ
[1:03:35] and i come across this quote you know
[1:03:37] speaking i'm not here to cast stones at
[1:03:39] the unbeliever the make-believer i want
[1:03:41] to get them being to be real believers
[1:03:43] brother
[1:03:44] jason a couple other ministers used it
[1:03:46] and i thought it was just powerful maybe
[1:03:47] the holy ghost was trying to tell some
[1:03:49] people things brother ram says now
[1:03:51] listen church i want to drop this in
[1:03:53] here because i believe the holy spirit
[1:03:55] told me to do it
[1:03:56] you may be sitting there some of you are
[1:03:58] i know you are disagreeing with me right
[1:04:00] now and i can call your name if you want
[1:04:02] me to
[1:04:03] talk about the eyes of a prophet i can
[1:04:05] call you out right now but listen to
[1:04:07] what he says
[1:04:08] he said i call your names you want me
[1:04:10] to so i know that but i can also see
[1:04:14] farther than that but you're going to
[1:04:15] believe it one of these days
[1:04:17] so i'm going to put this in so you
[1:04:19] understand so i can give you a little
[1:04:21] spot of grace it ain't going to be too
[1:04:23] long to some of you are going to change
[1:04:24] your mind you talk about grace talk
[1:04:27] about the holy ghost
[1:04:29] you might not believe it right now but
[1:04:31] one of these days you're going to catch
[1:04:32] it you're going to catch the vision
[1:04:34] because you're elected to catch it you
[1:04:36] can't help but catch it
[1:04:38] listen what paul says in colossians he
[1:04:40] says and you that were sometimes
[1:04:42] alienated enemies in your mind by wicked
[1:04:45] works
[1:04:46] he didn't say alienated in your soul he
[1:04:48] said by your mind
[1:04:50] you hadn't caught the revelation yet but
[1:04:52] one of these days you've got to catch it
[1:04:55] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[1:04:58] of his flesh through the death to
[1:04:59] present you holy unblameable
[1:05:02] unreprovable in his sight if you
[1:05:04] continue in the faith grounded and
[1:05:05] settled and be not moved from the hope
[1:05:07] of the gospel which you have heard which
[1:05:09] was preached to every creature which
[1:05:12] whereof paul i am made a minister
[1:05:14] so look he's saying you're not enemies
[1:05:16] of god you were enemies in your mind at
[1:05:18] one time but then you heard a voice and
[1:05:20] it called you out and it changed your
[1:05:22] life and you received christ and now
[1:05:25] you're going a whole different role
[1:05:28] you know satan
[1:05:29] one thing he'll do to you if he can't
[1:05:31] keep you he'll try to make you jealous
[1:05:33] of somebody
[1:05:34] he'll try to lie to you and say you know
[1:05:36] what god will do something for that
[1:05:37] person but he's not going to do it for
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:40] he'll fill that person with the holy
[1:05:41] ghost but he won't feel you
[1:05:43] he'll use that person to do something
[1:05:44] special but he won't feel you and you
[1:05:47] know then jealousy starts creeping in
[1:05:50] jealousy's such a cruel thing jealousy
[1:05:51] is what started death in the first place
[1:05:53] he's at the altar with cain and abel he
[1:05:55] got jealous and god even told me if
[1:05:57] you'll just listen and come the provided
[1:05:58] way you can have the same thing but he
[1:06:00] wouldn't do it and so many people do
[1:06:02] that they get jealous and they refuse to
[1:06:04] go ahead and go on with what god's
[1:06:06] telling them to do
[1:06:09] what we need to do is stop being jealous
[1:06:11] we're the bride there is no schisms in
[1:06:13] the bride that's differences divisions
[1:06:16] we're to pull for one another that's why
[1:06:18] i say the mate believer in the
[1:06:19] unbeliever i don't care who you are i'm
[1:06:20] still going to pull for you until god
[1:06:22] calls me home one of these days it's up
[1:06:24] to you to decide but i'll still pull for
[1:06:26] you
[1:06:28] speaking on down the children down in in
[1:06:31] egypt
[1:06:32] you know something's going to put you in
[1:06:34] egypt and and we're all born in sinful
[1:06:36] flesh we come to the world speaking lies
[1:06:38] you know brother brahms said that god
[1:06:40] doesn't judge you for being a sinner he
[1:06:43] judges you for staying a center he's
[1:06:45] made every provided way to get you out
[1:06:47] of that condition that you're in
[1:06:49] but so many people are satisfied with
[1:06:51] staying in egypt
[1:06:52] you know something's going to put
[1:06:54] something put you in egypt but god is
[1:06:56] trying to get you out
[1:06:57] brother rem says first let's review in
[1:06:59] genesis to see why they were down in
[1:07:02] egypt why would god's people be in that
[1:07:04] land
[1:07:05] after all god had promised right there
[1:07:06] at the beginning with abraham isaac
[1:07:08] jacob and palestine god gave them the
[1:07:10] land and said this is it
[1:07:13] and then the people to not be in that
[1:07:14] place that god provided for them he said
[1:07:16] that's the question of today also god
[1:07:19] give us pentecost he give us the book of
[1:07:21] acts he gives us the holy spirit to
[1:07:23] leading goddess he give us a land why
[1:07:25] are we out of it
[1:07:26] why is the church out of it
[1:07:28] why is the great christian church today
[1:07:30] living
[1:07:31] not living like the book of acts
[1:07:32] bringing forth the same thing he said
[1:07:34] there's some reason for it
[1:07:36] we all know that we're broke up we're in
[1:07:38] a terrible condition the most terrible
[1:07:40] condition that christianity has ever
[1:07:42] lived in is today we're on the right on
[1:07:44] the brim of a great terrific judgment
[1:07:46] laying for the church and the judgment
[1:07:49] can happen god is calling in exodus or
[1:07:51] before the judgment is happening god is
[1:07:54] calling in exodus just like he did then
[1:07:57] he said they they went down in egypt all
[1:07:59] because of the jealousy of a brother
[1:08:01] that's the reason israel was in egypt
[1:08:03] at the time of the land remember god's
[1:08:05] promise was only as long as they stayed
[1:08:07] in the land
[1:08:08] now you can see we were speaking in
[1:08:10] prayer a few moments ago why god would
[1:08:12] have to harden pharaoh's heart bring
[1:08:13] them people back to that promised land
[1:08:16] and he talks about hitler installing
[1:08:18] them being hardened so them jews could
[1:08:20] get back into their homeland which is a
[1:08:22] sign of that we are at the end israel
[1:08:24] returning back to our homeland
[1:08:27] he says
[1:08:29] and we find out by doing this
[1:08:31] that joseph was taken among his brethren
[1:08:33] the denominations and set out to himself
[1:08:35] his brothers and all the land and then
[1:08:37] there comes such a great thing we
[1:08:39] realize that israel as long as they
[1:08:40] dwelt in their dwelling place and kept
[1:08:43] up
[1:08:43] now that was one good thing to stay in
[1:08:45] that place positionally that's right but
[1:08:47] they got rid of the spirit the
[1:08:48] fundamentals today positionally know
[1:08:50] what they are but by intellectual
[1:08:52] conception of the bible there's no
[1:08:54] spirit they've rejected joseph turning
[1:08:56] them out they want to say it's nothing
[1:08:57] but a bunch of holy rollers we want
[1:08:59] nothing to do with it they've
[1:09:01] excommunicated him sold him out to the
[1:09:02] world
[1:09:03] they were out of fellowship that's the
[1:09:06] last thing we want to do is get out of
[1:09:07] fellowship
[1:09:09] now the story of this jealous brothers
[1:09:11] is certainly of great comparison with
[1:09:12] the spiritual side of it today
[1:09:14] we're all aware that it's jealousy not
[1:09:17] pure it's old dirty filthy jealousy see
[1:09:19] there's no purity and jealousy there's
[1:09:22] nothing but filthy jealousy when they
[1:09:23] see the same bible the nature of the
[1:09:25] same god that wrote the bible
[1:09:27] vindicating himself and then turned turn
[1:09:29] it down without a reason
[1:09:31] he said as i said it's dirty jealousy
[1:09:33] watching god heal the sick raise up the
[1:09:34] dead the same god that lived in the days
[1:09:36] of the apostles the same god that wrote
[1:09:39] the spiritual journey is the same god
[1:09:40] that does the same thing so that's
[1:09:42] nothing but jealousy
[1:09:45] the bride has no room for jealousy
[1:09:47] jealousy gets us out of our position
[1:09:49] jealousy causes us to bicker and fight
[1:09:51] with one another what we need to do is
[1:09:53] pull for one another
[1:09:55] but
[1:09:56] first corinthians 12 18 but now hath god
[1:09:59] set the members every one of them in the
[1:10:01] body has it pleased him for our calmly
[1:10:03] parts have no need but god had tempered
[1:10:05] the body together given more abundant
[1:10:08] honor to that which is lacked that there
[1:10:09] should be no schism division in the body
[1:10:13] but that the members should have the
[1:10:14] same care one for another and whether
[1:10:16] one members suffer all the members
[1:10:18] suffer with it or one member be honored
[1:10:21] all the members rejoice with it now ye
[1:10:23] are the body of christ and members
[1:10:26] in particulars brother rahm says
[1:10:27] sometimes we found out that brethren the
[1:10:29] precious faith as i've heard myself and
[1:10:31] they would say oh brother branham i
[1:10:32] don't believe it's any use for me to go
[1:10:34] any further i was over to hear billy
[1:10:36] graham and there was many thousands of
[1:10:38] people and i was out to hear the most
[1:10:39] noble brother or roberts and thousands
[1:10:41] of the people pack the tent it just
[1:10:43] seems like maybe a little crowd my
[1:10:45] little crowd doesn't mean too much he
[1:10:47] said but you're so wrong he said do you
[1:10:48] appreciate your finger you wouldn't what
[1:10:50] your fingers say because i'm not an eye
[1:10:52] or ear i won't act anymore he said it's
[1:10:55] no different
[1:10:57] we need to pull for one another i
[1:10:59] wouldn't want to lose my finger either
[1:11:01] we we want all the parts to be together
[1:11:03] and all the parts will be together of
[1:11:05] this bride
[1:11:07] speak romans 12 10 says be kindly
[1:11:09] affectionate one to another with
[1:11:11] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[1:11:13] another
[1:11:14] in hebrews 10 says let us hold fast the
[1:11:17] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:11:19] for he is faithful that promised let us
[1:11:21] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:11:23] love and to good works not forsaking the
[1:11:26] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:11:28] manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:11:30] another and that much more as you see
[1:11:32] the day approaching
[1:11:35] nobody can take your place no matter how
[1:11:38] little you say i'm just a housewife
[1:11:40] nobody can take your place
[1:11:43] said god and his great economy has said
[1:11:45] it so the body of christ in order till
[1:11:47] there is no one that can take your place
[1:11:50] brother brown speaks on how i would like
[1:11:51] to take brother billy graham's place and
[1:11:53] any of the ministers but we can't do it
[1:11:55] but just remember billy can't take our
[1:11:57] place
[1:11:58] see all have a place some of us
[1:12:00] evangelists prophets teachers some
[1:12:02] pastors whatever we are some housewives
[1:12:05] some mechanics some farmers whatever it
[1:12:06] is god has set you in your place so
[1:12:09] there's no need in jealousy because god
[1:12:11] has put you where he wants you and he'll
[1:12:13] take care of you if he put you there
[1:12:15] he'll take care of you
[1:12:17] we've got one enemy that's satan not
[1:12:19] each
[1:12:20] other god told but we've got something
[1:12:23] to do because god told them down in
[1:12:25] egypt i give you that land but he didn't
[1:12:27] say i'll go out and sweep it out and
[1:12:28] garnish the houses and hang up the
[1:12:30] curtains and everything you'll just move
[1:12:32] in they had to fight for every inch of
[1:12:35] ground they took
[1:12:36] and that's right fighting and take it by
[1:12:38] every inch but he said everywhere the
[1:12:40] soles of your foot lands that's
[1:12:42] possession footsteps is possession
[1:12:45] that's the same thing today divine
[1:12:47] healing belongs to us the holy spirit
[1:12:49] belongs to us it's our property but
[1:12:51] you'll fight for every inch of it yes
[1:12:53] sir but brother footsteps is possession
[1:12:56] just keep fighting take it
[1:12:58] the devil say the days of miracle or
[1:13:00] past say you're lying god said he's the
[1:13:02] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:13:04] take it over everywhere your footsteps
[1:13:06] that's possession that's right
[1:13:09] i like this story brother talk brother
[1:13:10] brown talks about old buddy robinson and
[1:13:12] i think if we just get the attitude that
[1:13:14] buddy robinson had we get a lot further
[1:13:16] with god he said old buddy robinson kept
[1:13:19] going along he wanted the holy ghost
[1:13:20] said glory to god i want the holy ghost
[1:13:22] so bad i don't know what to do he said i
[1:13:25] was plowing corn one morning with old
[1:13:27] alec his mule said alex kept stepping on
[1:13:29] the corn and i got mad at him run over
[1:13:31] there and bit him on the air
[1:13:32] talk about a temper
[1:13:35] he said alec kicked at me said i went
[1:13:36] over and sat down i looked at him
[1:13:38] standing there said i bid old alec as
[1:13:40] hard as i could said i looked over him
[1:13:41] said alec
[1:13:42] said alec i'm sorry i won't do that no
[1:13:45] more
[1:13:47] said looked around said
[1:13:49] you don't get alex seemed to look around
[1:13:51] and say you don't get no more religion
[1:13:53] than that what you got now you'd treat
[1:13:54] me that way again he said mohammad
[1:13:56] that's right he said i got down the
[1:13:58] cornrow and said good lord give me lots
[1:14:00] of knowledge and the gabled into my soul
[1:14:02] help me fight the devil as long as i
[1:14:04] have a tooth in my mouth and gum until i
[1:14:06] die
[1:14:07] he said lord if you don't give me the
[1:14:08] holy ghost when you come back to earth
[1:14:10] you're gonna find a pile of bones laying
[1:14:12] right here he said he got it
[1:14:14] i think that's the important thing he
[1:14:16] got it
[1:14:17] my goodness he had an attitude just to
[1:14:19] begin you think well i got to get right
[1:14:20] with god i've got to do this i've got to
[1:14:22] do that you ain't got to do nothing you
[1:14:24] got to surrender god
[1:14:26] he'll fill you with the holy ghost if
[1:14:27] you'll just surrender
[1:14:29] brother ram said he got it
[1:14:31] he says you want to belong in heaven
[1:14:33] that's where your affections ought to be
[1:14:35] on things above jesus said set your
[1:14:37] affections on things above not on things
[1:14:39] of the earth they're going to fail stay
[1:14:41] with god stay with realities because god
[1:14:44] is a god of reality
[1:14:48] so many though
[1:14:49] they don't receive the holy ghost
[1:14:51] because they don't think god cares about
[1:14:52] them
[1:14:53] they don't think god's watching them
[1:14:55] thank god watched over me then this
[1:14:57] situation probably wouldn't be happening
[1:14:58] to me right now probably wouldn't be
[1:15:00] going through this thing why so and so
[1:15:02] always have good things happening to
[1:15:04] them they seem to live the overcoming
[1:15:05] life here i'm sitting here trying i'm
[1:15:07] doing the best i can for god and these
[1:15:09] things are happening but god does care
[1:15:12] god might just be trying to temper you a
[1:15:14] little bit try to mold you a little bit
[1:15:16] you think about the story of job
[1:15:18] you think job had it easy
[1:15:20] he didn't have it easy at all he was put
[1:15:22] to the test
[1:15:23] brother braham says sometimes the
[1:15:24] believers are put to the test not
[1:15:26] sometimes but every time for every son
[1:15:29] that cometh to god must be chastened
[1:15:31] trial chain train remember the trials
[1:15:33] the dusty roads the hot sun of
[1:15:35] persecution but the loyalty of your
[1:15:37] heart beats the material till she's
[1:15:38] ready to go in the mold god's children
[1:15:41] is made correctly on his word for you
[1:15:43] are living examples the word of god
[1:15:45] living through them see the trial comes
[1:15:47] to shake you to put you at the very
[1:15:49] bottom to see where you stand they
[1:15:52] tested try every son that comes to god
[1:15:55] he says but when job struck that
[1:15:57] revelation that it wasn't god he was
[1:16:00] only going through his trials to make
[1:16:02] something of him
[1:16:03] it wasn't god doing it it was satan
[1:16:05] doing it he said that's the thing today
[1:16:07] he'll try to tell you satan speaking of
[1:16:09] satan he'll try to put these trials and
[1:16:12] say that you're god putting punishment
[1:16:13] upon you it isn't so no sir it's satan
[1:16:16] doing that and god's permitting it to
[1:16:18] temper you to see
[1:16:20] if you're tied to this earth by the
[1:16:21] earth cares or whether your treasures
[1:16:23] are in heaven for where your treasures
[1:16:25] is there your heart is also
[1:16:31] so we're preparing for rapture
[1:16:33] as i was speaking earlier the rapture is
[1:16:36] a process and it's even happening now
[1:16:39] and so these trials these things that we
[1:16:40] face
[1:16:42] are just things to prepare us for what
[1:16:43] we're fixing to experience
[1:16:46] just as abraham couldn't receive
[1:16:49] the promised son without a body change
[1:16:51] so can we not receive the promised son
[1:16:53] without a body change
[1:16:55] soul is redeemed but we're still in
[1:16:56] sinful flesh
[1:16:57] but we're looking towards a promise to
[1:16:59] be changed one of these days
[1:17:01] that change is only going to come
[1:17:03] through the holy ghost through being
[1:17:04] sealed by the believing the message of
[1:17:07] this hour
[1:17:10] brother branham would talk he say that's
[1:17:12] the reason i do believe when that bride
[1:17:14] is called out that elected set in the
[1:17:16] book of life there will come a sound
[1:17:18] from heaven take such a baptism of the
[1:17:20] holy spirit that that bride will take
[1:17:22] her from the earth and a rapturing get
[1:17:24] grace
[1:17:25] god promised it
[1:17:26] we've got to have
[1:17:28] that rapture in grace the only way to
[1:17:30] have it is to have that wedding ring on
[1:17:32] that wedding garment that baptism of the
[1:17:34] holy ghost is so important it's the only
[1:17:36] thing that's going to get us out of here
[1:17:39] but i like this at the end musicians
[1:17:41] would come
[1:17:44] he says this
[1:17:46] he said the other day i was standing on
[1:17:48] the street corner and i was standing
[1:17:51] there with
[1:17:52] watching the armistice day parade and it
[1:17:54] went up going up the street and i stood
[1:17:55] there with my little son joseph there
[1:17:58] come the first old war tanks come by
[1:17:59] little old tanks after that the great
[1:18:01] sherman tanks of the new war and great
[1:18:03] cannons with their muzzle blast a muzzle
[1:18:05] break and so forth there come the
[1:18:07] soldiers and the gold star mothers and
[1:18:09] there come with a float on down
[1:18:11] a float in front of a grave of the
[1:18:13] unknown soldier there's a soldier there
[1:18:15] standing there at the guard of that
[1:18:17] grave stood a marine on the other side
[1:18:19] and a sailor on the other side and there
[1:18:20] was a partition drawn and on the other
[1:18:23] side said a gold star mother she had
[1:18:24] lost her boy there stood a young wife
[1:18:26] with her head over the table crying a
[1:18:28] little ragged boy setting sideways tears
[1:18:30] running out of his face because he lost
[1:18:32] his daddy he said i thought what sadness
[1:18:34] i stand here and look see them old just
[1:18:36] a few of the soldiers left marching down
[1:18:38] there crippled and old with their
[1:18:40] uniforms but proudly displaying because
[1:18:42] they were americans he said i thought oh
[1:18:45] god one of these days there's going to
[1:18:47] come a blast from heaven and the dead in
[1:18:49] christ shall rise first them old
[1:18:50] testament saints back yonder who are
[1:18:52] waiting will blast forth and come out of
[1:18:54] there first and go into the resurrection
[1:18:56] will drop right in line going into the
[1:18:58] sky these old mortal bodies changed and
[1:19:01] made like unto his own glorious body he
[1:19:03] said what a parade that will be when we
[1:19:05] starts heavenward some of these days and
[1:19:07] the rapturing time that lays ahead old
[1:19:10] proudly displaying the blood of jesus
[1:19:12] christ upon their chest the message of
[1:19:14] god in the hour that they lived in
[1:19:16] that's the hour we're looking forward to
[1:19:18] brother and i say that's what we're
[1:19:20] still looking forward to because we're
[1:19:22] convinced the message is true and it
[1:19:24] will take place someday
[1:19:26] amen god bless you
[1:19:28] i know that was kind of choppy that's
[1:19:30] what was on my heart
[1:19:32] i just hope it makes you love him more
[1:19:33] and
[1:19:34] convinces you that this is the truth
[1:19:36] because if you haven't received the holy
[1:19:38] ghost you can receive the holy ghost
[1:19:40] god's still calling because we're still
[1:19:42] here
[1:19:43] and he's determined to get that last one
[1:19:45] in
