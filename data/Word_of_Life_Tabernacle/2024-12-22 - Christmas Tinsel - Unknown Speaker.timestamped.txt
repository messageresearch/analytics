[30:32] his Blessing to the word you may be
[30:34] seated I want to speak to you this
[30:36] morning on Christmas tinsel Christmas
[30:41] tinsil tinsil is a thread a strip or a
[30:45] sheet of metal paper or
[30:48] plastic used to produce a glittering and
[30:50] sparkling appearance in
[30:53] decoration it is also a metaphor for
[30:56] something superficially attractive or
[30:59] glamorous but of little real
[31:02] worth we uh tinsel if you've never seen
[31:05] tinsel uh that's what Christmas trees
[31:08] used to look like hope I don't get in
[31:10] trouble for showing a picture of a
[31:12] Christmas tree in the church but uh that
[31:15] that is what Christmas trees look like
[31:17] back in the day or or some of them did
[31:19] some of yall may have used that I don't
[31:21] know if you knew this but tinel the
[31:23] reason they did away with tinsil they
[31:24] haven't done away with it it's still
[31:26] available but they changed what was made
[31:28] out of it was made out of
[31:29] lead and so little kids would take it
[31:32] and and eat it I guess not not anybody
[31:35] in my family but people in some families
[31:37] do those kind of things but uh they they
[31:40] ate the lead and and and caused some
[31:42] problems and so that's why uh they don't
[31:44] make it out of lead anymore so it's
[31:46] actually very beautiful and very
[31:48] dangerous and poisonous so and and yet
[31:52] we survived somehow didn't we in the
[31:54] generation My Generation the ones before
[31:56] us drinking out the garden hose and
[31:59] things like that but tinsel is
[32:02] associated with Christmas It's
[32:04] associated with this time of year you
[32:06] there's a flashiness to it a brightness
[32:09] to it a uh there's a there's an
[32:12] attraction to it and And yet when Christ
[32:15] was born there was nothing flashy about
[32:18] it there was nothing no tinsel you could
[32:21] say to it it it probably wasn't a silent
[32:25] night when very few bursts are
[32:28] pilot the The Peasant cave that they
[32:31] were in was used as a barn would have
[32:34] been cold on an early spring night it
[32:38] would have smelled like
[32:39] animals it it wouldn't have been pretty
[32:42] it it would have been very would been
[32:44] the lowest type of a home or or dwelling
[32:47] or a stable or cave to to be born in
[32:52] they were there to pay their
[32:54] taxes which probably felt much more like
[32:57] April 15th than December
[33:00] 25th right and and and you know April
[33:02] 15th there's not much of tinsel about
[33:05] taex day that's what they were there for
[33:08] so there weren't any lights there
[33:09] weren't any trees there weren't any
[33:11] other than just natural trees there
[33:13] weren't any uh there there wasn't any
[33:15] glamour about it and yet the Angels told
[33:19] the Shepherds to Rejoice with exceeding
[33:22] great joy and and and to give him praise
[33:25] and and we find that they did that
[33:28] so it was a great moment the greatest
[33:30] moment up to that time that had ever
[33:32] been in history only superseded by his
[33:35] death on the cross and then his
[33:37] resurrection but to that time the
[33:39] greatest moment when God was born in
[33:42] flesh when God condescended into our
[33:45] world and came out of his light into our
[33:48] Darkness aren't you glad that he did
[33:50] that that's what Christmas is really
[33:53] about it wasn't December 25th but we
[33:57] know was probably born in the spring but
[33:59] it wasn't very glamorous it wasn't very
[34:02] great in Isaiah chapter 7 when the
[34:06] prophet Isaiah was talking about Chris
[34:09] or about the birth of Christ and how it
[34:12] would come the prophecy that was coming
[34:13] he was having a difficult time getting
[34:16] the Jews to believe his message because
[34:20] the times were tough and and it says
[34:23] that it came to pass in the days of ahaz
[34:25] that these two other kings came came to
[34:28] war against Jerusalem could not Prevail
[34:30] against it and and a rumor started
[34:33] during that time it was told the House
[34:35] of David saying Syria is Confederate
[34:37] with Ephraim and so they said oh the
[34:40] ephraimites and the syrians are going to
[34:42] come in and come together and then
[34:44] they'll be able to overcome us and it
[34:46] says and his heart was moved and the
[34:49] Heart of his people as the Trees of the
[34:52] wood are moved with the wind and you'll
[34:55] find over the next few verses that that
[34:58] Isaiah went to ahaz the king with the
[35:00] Lord's message that the king shouldn't
[35:02] Fear The Alliance of Israel and Ephram
[35:06] or the plan to depose Aha ahaz and
[35:09] replace him with the king of their
[35:11] choice but God said uh about that he
[35:14] said it won't happen in verse seven he
[35:17] said it shall not stand neither shall it
[35:19] come to pass so he said I know they've
[35:21] devise this but it won't happen and he
[35:24] says in five in three score and five
[35:26] years and 65 years
[35:28] Ephraim will be broken it won't be a
[35:29] people the head of Ephraim is Samar
[35:31] Ephraim was a tribe in Israel it was the
[35:34] Israelites against the judeans and he
[35:37] said the head of Samaria is Ralia son if
[35:39] you will not believe surely you shall
[35:41] not be established so in other words
[35:42] he's saying I need you to believe me and
[35:46] Isaiah knew they didn't believe and in
[35:49] verse 10 it says moreover the Lord spake
[35:51] again to ahaz saying ask a sign so God's
[35:55] trying to get him to believe the
[35:56] prophet's trying to get him to believe
[35:58] and he said ask a sign ask for me for a
[36:01] sign isn't it amazing that even they
[36:04] they they were so steeped and unbelief
[36:06] that they wouldn't even ask for
[36:08] something to prove that they that it was
[36:10] true that the word was true and so he
[36:13] said ask a sign and ask of the Lord thy
[36:16] God ask it either in the depth or in the
[36:18] height above but ahaz said I will not
[36:21] ask neither will I tempt the Lord and
[36:23] really what it was was a lack of faith
[36:26] in ahaz to believe he had such little
[36:29] faith that he wouldn't do what the Jews
[36:31] would normally do and ask for a sign
[36:33] remember Paul says that the Jews seek
[36:36] signs but he had so little faith he
[36:38] wouldn't even ask for a sign and Isaiah
[36:41] cries out he said hear you now House of
[36:43] David is it a small thing for you to
[36:46] weary men but will you weary My God
[36:50] also verse 14 therefore the Lord himself
[36:55] shall give you a sign amen now out of
[36:57] this very ordinary event was happening
[36:59] in and and is or judeans or Israelites
[37:03] being full Jews being full of unbelief
[37:06] was not a an abnormal thing it was a
[37:09] very normal thing that they would
[37:11] disbelieve God but out of this suddenly
[37:14] Isaiah drops into another channel of
[37:16] inspiration and he said the Lord himself
[37:19] will give you a sign Behold a virgin
[37:21] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[37:24] call his name Emanuel he said you won't
[37:25] believe anything the prophet say so the
[37:28] word is going to come in going to become
[37:31] flesh the word oh I love how that works
[37:34] the word breaks the silence at Christmas
[37:37] time the word breaking the Silence of of
[37:40] the prophets that had had they had
[37:42] ceased to prophesy and the word broke
[37:44] that silence now we know that he is not
[37:47] just a sign he's the super sign how many
[37:49] know that today brother the brand preach
[37:51] that to us he is the super
[37:54] sign and yet he would not come in a
[37:57] flashy way in a way of tinsel in Isaiah
[38:00] 53:1 it says who hath believed our
[38:03] report to whom is the arm of the Lord
[38:05] revealed you can see how that goes with
[38:08] with Isaiah chapter 7 who's believed us
[38:12] for he shall grow up before him as a
[38:15] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[38:17] prophesying of the Virgin birth Heath no
[38:19] form nor comeliness and when we shall
[38:22] see him there is no beauty that we
[38:24] should desire him there's no tinsil on
[38:27] the Virgin birth there was no beauty
[38:30] that people would attract people to that
[38:32] other than the word itself let me tell
[38:34] you church that's the same thing today
[38:36] the bride has to be attracted by the
[38:39] word because the tinsil is not enough to
[38:41] keep you the shininess isn't enough to
[38:43] keep
[38:44] you and many times the shininess in the
[38:47] ttin Christmas actually obscures the
[38:50] message of Christmas which is God came
[38:52] into our world Amen and yet the tinsil
[38:56] that's on the world today and the
[38:57] commercial ization of it it it it
[39:00] actually takes away from what we're
[39:02] trying to get across to the people but I
[39:04] want you children to understand and all
[39:06] of us to understand God came into our
[39:08] world that's why we still honor
[39:11] Christmas not a even a certain day but
[39:13] the fact that God came into our
[39:16] world but has nothing to do with Santa
[39:18] Claus has nothing to do with elves it
[39:21] has nothing to do with trees what it has
[39:24] to do with is God deity becoming
[39:27] wrapping himself in flesh and coming
[39:29] down into my world because without that
[39:32] happening I could never be saved I could
[39:34] never be
[39:35] right it had to take
[39:39] place he was
[39:41] God's wrapped
[39:44] gift but maybe if you'd been wrapped in
[39:47] tinsil instead of swaddling clothes
[39:51] perhaps they would have received him and
[39:53] yet even when he comes in a way that we
[39:55] could perceive would be
[39:57] get our attention many times people take
[40:01] the
[40:01] tenil and take the wrapping paper and
[40:06] throw away the
[40:08] gift in Isaiah
[40:10] 29:14 he he tells us that this was done
[40:13] on purpose he said therefore behold I'll
[40:16] proceed to do a marvelous work among
[40:18] this people even a marvelous work and a
[40:21] Wonder now watch what the Wonder would
[40:23] be for the wisdom of their wise men
[40:25] Shall Perish and the
[40:27] understanding of their prudent men shall
[40:30] be hid Jesus talks about that in Luke
[40:32] 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[40:35] spirit and said I thank thee oh Father
[40:36] Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid
[40:38] these things from the eyes of the wise
[40:41] and The Prudent and has revealed them
[40:43] unto babes even so father for so it
[40:46] seemed good in thy sight so it was God's
[40:48] purpose that the common people would
[40:50] hear him gladly it was his purpose that
[40:52] he would come at Christmas time and come
[40:54] in a way be wrapped in a way that the
[40:56] people couldn't receive it it was his
[40:58] purpose that there wouldn't be tinel on
[41:01] it but that it would be in a way that
[41:04] only those who were looking for him
[41:06] would see
[41:08] it Christmas today has lots of
[41:11] tensil people go in debt to buy things
[41:13] for people they don't even
[41:17] like right you say well nobody goes and
[41:19] gets a loan at Christmas time well
[41:20] probably some people do but they use
[41:23] credit
[41:24] cards right I'm not criticizing you if
[41:26] you use credit cards to buy Christmas
[41:28] gifts but make sure it's somebody you
[41:29] like at
[41:33] least right it's probably not a good
[41:35] idea to to borrow money to buy things
[41:38] that are going to get broken the first
[41:40] day to impress people they don't even
[41:44] know yet Christmases could be such a
[41:46] special
[41:48] time we we take the word Christmas
[41:50] brother B said it's very seldom you ever
[41:52] hear Christ's name mentioned you don't
[41:54] hear it mentioned the lights and tinsels
[41:56] all in Santa Claus not on Christ till
[41:59] people hardly know what Christmas is
[42:00] really for he talks about the
[42:02] commercialization of it he said now if
[42:04] they want to make a commercial day like
[42:06] Mother's Day or Father's Day or Son's
[42:08] Day or daughter's day that's all right
[42:11] but keep that commercial off of
[42:13] Christmas he said I've seen a sign not
[42:15] long ago said put Christ back in
[42:17] Christmas now people will tell you
[42:19] brother Brown didn't believe in
[42:21] Christmas and it's a it it's brother BR
[42:24] talks very harshly about Christmas in
[42:26] some places
[42:27] brother brandham always celebrated
[42:28] Christmas with his family and how are
[42:31] those two things how do you put those
[42:32] two things together well what he was
[42:34] upset about was the commercialization of
[42:37] it what people had made it he said they
[42:40] bring you to a Christmas what do you do
[42:42] he said they bring you to a church and
[42:44] you learn a Creed they bring you to a
[42:46] Christmas what do you do you see a Santa
[42:48] Claus they bring you to a church you see
[42:50] an organization but Christ brought them
[42:52] to the cross I loved our Sunday School
[42:54] play when the kids saying it's about the
[42:56] cross
[42:58] right that's what it's all about it's
[42:59] about the cross Christ brought them to
[43:02] the cross and when you get a real
[43:04] disciple that will point you to Christ
[43:06] Christ will bring you to the Cross where
[43:08] you are crucified with him look where
[43:10] Christmas leads you to church when you
[43:12] really get it right Christmas doesn't
[43:13] lift you up Christmas is not for a
[43:16] momentary gation or or feeling good but
[43:19] Christmas is about humbling yourself
[43:22] because Christmas was God coming down
[43:25] and becoming the lowest of the low so he
[43:27] can save you and I that was God be
[43:30] humbling himself to our world that's
[43:32] what Christmas is about and his eternal
[43:35] life he said and your life meet together
[43:38] and your life dies and you take on his
[43:41] eternal life or aren't you glad for that
[43:43] kind of a Christmas he said then you're
[43:45] a Son of God See We Don't Preach just
[43:48] Christ in a Manger although he was there
[43:50] but we preach Christ crucified the Bible
[43:52] says after that in the wisdom of God the
[43:55] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[43:57] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[44:00] save them that believe that's still how
[44:02] God Saves people is by the preaching of
[44:04] the word I don't care how out of fashion
[44:06] it is or whatever it becomes we still
[44:08] need to hear the preaching of the word
[44:10] amen the by the preaching of the word he
[44:12] chose to save those that believe for the
[44:16] Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek
[44:19] after wisdom remember that's what they
[44:20] were looking for we want a sign and then
[44:23] they had so much unbelief they wouldn't
[44:24] even look for a sign anymore he said but
[44:26] the Jews require sign the Greeks seek
[44:28] after wisdom but we preach Christ
[44:30] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[44:32] block unto the Greeks foolishness but
[44:34] unto them that's you and I this morning
[44:37] unto them which are called both Jews and
[44:39] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[44:41] wisdom of God we preach Christ crucified
[44:45] when the world wants to just make a
[44:48] Christmas show we want to see who is
[44:50] really laying there it was the word
[44:54] vilified laughed at made fun of
[44:57] made a laughing stock in the world seen
[45:00] by very few people understood by even
[45:03] fewer and yet Shepherds heralded his
[45:07] birth and Angels heralded his birth
[45:09] Christmas time was a time of
[45:11] humility was a time when God came down
[45:14] to man B you know at Christmas I think
[45:16] we all too many of us I wouldn't say all
[45:19] but too many of us lose the real value
[45:20] of what Christmas
[45:22] is he said as I noticed out here even
[45:24] the palm trees are decorated in the East
[45:27] it's always the fur tree or the
[45:29] Evergreen he said in months or weeks
[45:31] maybe a month or six weeks before
[45:32] Christmas ever begins it's always the
[45:34] tinsil and they made it a commercial
[45:36] instead of what it really means he talks
[45:39] about how Jesus was not born on December
[45:41] the 25th he said but remember whatever
[45:44] day it might be we still doesn't take
[45:47] away the sacredness of what it's
[45:48] supposed to be where Satan has robbed us
[45:52] of
[45:53] this right he wasn't trying to do away
[45:55] with Christmas but he was saying Satan
[45:57] has robbed us of this has made a great
[45:59] commercial and Santa Claus stole all the
[46:02] worship right it's become a day like
[46:05] Easter and now now Christmas and Easter
[46:08] are very similar in that you don't
[46:09] realize the word Easter people say we
[46:11] shouldn't say Merry Christmas because
[46:12] Christmas is a pagan word so it's
[46:15] Easter Easter is a pagan word but we're
[46:17] not talking about the word Easter we're
[46:20] not talking about bunny rabbits and a
[46:22] and a spring fertility or anything like
[46:24] that what we're talking about is the day
[46:27] that Jesus rose from the dead what we're
[46:30] talking about at Christmas or we know
[46:31] when he rose from the dead we don't know
[46:33] exactly when he was born but we know he
[46:35] was born sometime in the spring because
[46:37] he was a lamb and it would had to been
[46:38] for the Shepherds to be watching their
[46:40] fields their their their flocks at night
[46:43] he was a lamb that was born during the
[46:44] Spring but we don't know exactly what
[46:46] day but I'm willing to take during this
[46:49] time of darkness and shine a light that
[46:51] says he was born and it did matter and
[46:53] he's still the same yesterday today and
[46:55] forever and if you need need to meet him
[46:57] you can meet him today by humbling
[46:59] yourself at Christmas
[47:03] time he said Easter like bunny rabbits
[47:05] and pink ducks and what's that got to do
[47:07] with Easter what's that got to do with
[47:08] the resurrection of Christ it's just
[47:10] like the world today the kids on the
[47:12] street can more about daav Crockett than
[47:13] they could about Jesus Christ now I
[47:15] don't know how many of our kids could
[47:16] tell you about Davey Crockett but maybe
[47:18] we could take that an updated to Iron
[47:20] Man or somebody like
[47:23] that he said they can tell you more
[47:25] about some Outlaw some criminal of days
[47:27] gone by and they came the Prince of Life
[47:30] was born 1900 years ago he said but that
[47:33] doesn't take the real thing away from we
[47:37] Christians you see always light shines
[47:40] its best in the darkness you said
[47:42] brother Ben we should just celebrate
[47:43] Christmas I know people in the message
[47:44] and I'm not being critical of them it's
[47:46] just the way people think sometimes they
[47:49] well we'll give gifts on Thanksgiving so
[47:50] we won't have to celebrate Christmas
[47:52] that's not what brother brandom taught
[47:53] us he said the light shines its best in
[47:55] the Darkness
[47:57] right at the time of year when everybody
[47:59] else is celebrating whatever it is that
[48:01] they're celebrating Santa Claus or
[48:02] whatever but we celebrate a risen savior
[48:06] during this time we celebrate God who
[48:08] came into the world light shines its
[48:11] best in the darkness the forked
[48:13] lightning in the black cloudy skies at
[48:15] night shows there can be light in
[48:17] darkness if the Sun's shining you don't
[48:19] need the lights too much but darker the
[48:22] smaller the light the greater it will
[48:24] shine in the darkness listen what he
[48:26] says the whole world's got tinsel
[48:29] they've got tinsel there's a lot of
[48:31] shininess to the world today a lot to
[48:33] attract the attention but many times
[48:35] there's death in
[48:36] it the whole world's got tinsel but
[48:39] we've got Christ and that's what we
[48:41] ought to be letting shine in this dark
[48:43] hour that we're now living in how many
[48:45] can say Amen to that today Hallelujah we
[48:49] don't need tinsel on the church we he
[48:51] Christ
[48:52] yes what we try to do is twist it up and
[48:54] make it some great something up there
[48:56] put flour and tinsil on it we pollute it
[48:59] just like the Nations has done
[49:01] Christmas if we could get the tinsil off
[49:03] of the things and the humility back in
[49:05] the human heart if we could bring the
[49:08] humility back to Christmas of what it
[49:09] ought to be not a commercial day not
[49:13] lights and Santa Clauses but back to
[49:15] worshiping the god of creation who come
[49:18] in a stable and was born to baby God
[49:21] made flesh and dwelt among us if we
[49:23] could come back to that get away from
[49:24] the tinsil and the big things God don't
[49:27] even deal with it at all listen Church
[49:28] how many times we try to make Christmas
[49:30] a production and it makes it where
[49:32] people especially people have to pay for
[49:34] it hate
[49:35] Christmas because it becomes just a time
[49:37] when you got to give a bunch of stuff
[49:39] and and you're required if this one
[49:41] gives you a gift to give them one back
[49:43] and we should never get into that church
[49:45] do what you can for people out of the
[49:47] goodness of your heart don't do it just
[49:49] as a church many times we want to do
[49:51] more but we do what we can for people
[49:53] during this time of year but we we would
[49:55] like to do more but we do what we can
[49:57] we're not going to go in debt for it we
[49:59] just do what we can in your family
[50:01] sometimes the simpler things are better
[50:03] because Christ came in a humble way come
[50:06] on now sometimes seven Stakes are
[50:10] enough some of you know what I'm talking
[50:13] about
[50:15] [Laughter]
[50:16] now see God don't even deal with it at
[50:19] all you say well I belong to the biggest
[50:21] organization he said that takes you that
[50:23] much farther away from God you say I do
[50:26] this and that that just takes you that
[50:28] much farther you've got to humble
[50:30] yourself until you see until if you
[50:32] abide in me and my words abide in you
[50:34] then ask what you will so what we try to
[50:37] do as soon as God gives us a little
[50:38] shower of blessings we try to twist it
[50:41] all up and get dignitaries in there it's
[50:42] going to make great big names and outdo
[50:44] the other one this one starts this way
[50:46] and that way and God leaves the whole
[50:48] thing listen when we start being blessed
[50:51] we don't need to make an organization
[50:53] out of it I've seen churches do that
[50:55] they'll fellowship and they'll be free
[50:57] with people but as soon as the church
[50:58] starts building up then they they quit
[51:00] fellowshipping they quit they become
[51:03] critical of others we don't want to ever
[51:04] get that way no matter how many sit
[51:06] among us we need to get to we need to
[51:08] treat each other right we need to keep
[51:10] fellowshipping and keep reaching out and
[51:12] because that's what got us where we are
[51:15] is doing that having that kind of
[51:16] openness we need to keep that humility
[51:18] about us not build an organization the
[51:21] church isn't about me it's not about the
[51:23] deacons it's not about even any of us
[51:25] it's about him
[51:29] right he said what we need
[51:31] today oh what what do we need today it's
[51:34] a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit
[51:37] upon Hearts that's humble we need a real
[51:40] Christmas a birth
[51:43] place he said if you could realize
[51:45] you're nothing but a stable I've used
[51:47] this quote before but it's just so it's
[51:49] so pertinent in this place he said God
[51:52] didn't go to Jerusalem to shalow or
[51:53] ramoth Gilead he come to a stable that
[51:55] was polluted
[51:57] when you let God he said you become and
[51:59] realize in yourself you're nothing but a
[52:01] stinking
[52:05] stable right but welcome Hallelujah
[52:10] there's no room for him in the
[52:11] denomination anymore there's no room for
[52:13] him in the Santa Claus experience
[52:15] there's no room for him in bran no room
[52:17] for him in Gatlinburg no room for him in
[52:19] New York City but let in Hardy Arkansas
[52:22] May there be room for him in our hearts
[52:26] welcome open your doors when these great
[52:28] big places and ends are turning him away
[52:31] open your doors of the manger of your
[52:33] heart let Jehovah come into that watch
[52:35] what takes place for he is the word and
[52:38] he said if you abide in me and my word
[52:40] in you he is the word let him come into
[52:42] you and watch what takes place then ask
[52:45] what you will and it'll be done for you
[52:48] he humbled
[52:50] himself look in Luke 22 and: 42 look
[52:53] what he did he said father if thou be
[52:55] willing remove the cup for me
[52:57] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[52:59] done what does that have to do with
[53:01] Christmas it has everything to do with
[53:03] Christmas this is what he came for
[53:06] because Philippians 2:5 tells us let
[53:08] this mind be in you which was also in
[53:10] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[53:12] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[53:14] with God but made himself of no
[53:17] reputation took upon him the form of a
[53:19] servant was made in the likeness of men
[53:23] oh my being found in fashion as a man he
[53:26] humbled
[53:27] himself became obedient unto death even
[53:31] the death of the Cross wherefore God
[53:34] also hath highly exalted him and given
[53:37] him a name which is above every name at
[53:39] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[53:41] things in heaven and things and Earth
[53:43] things under the Earth that every tongue
[53:44] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[53:47] to the glory of God the
[53:49] father Jesus was the fullness of God's
[53:52] word he was the fullness of the godhead
[53:55] bodily
[53:58] and in him dwelt the fullness of God God
[54:01] lived in Jesus Christ God was in Christ
[54:05] reconciling the world to himself not Jew
[54:08] nor Gentile but God can we understand
[54:10] that today there he stood making himself
[54:15] he said how
[54:16] fitting God's own blood had to shed upon
[54:19] the ground from the innocent blood of
[54:21] Abel on down to redeem us he didn't take
[54:25] his own life he didn't hold his own life
[54:29] he said father is it possible this cup
[54:32] should pass from me but nevertheless not
[54:36] my will thine be done he give in to the
[54:39] word so brother Ben how should we act on
[54:41] Christmas time we should give in to the
[54:44] word how should we act every other day
[54:47] of the year we should give in to the
[54:51] word today we can do the same thing you
[54:54] can either take your Creeds take your
[54:55] sew and so and go wherever you want with
[54:57] it but you can say not my will but thine
[55:00] be done come back to that word of God
[55:04] take your tinsil and Christmas and do
[55:06] what you want with want it to he said do
[55:08] with it what you want to but give me
[55:10] Jesus Christ in my heart no matter how
[55:13] humble it is and how people laugh at at
[55:15] it or what of it watch its nature he
[55:17] said see if it does just like he did if
[55:19] it didn't it don't compare with this
[55:20] word leave it alone it's not Christ
[55:22] because Christ is the word then you can
[55:25] have your tinsil but Give Me Jesus
[55:27] Christ in my
[55:29] heart again he said oh brother sister
[55:31] how nice it would be if each one of you
[55:33] if each one of us me if each one of us
[55:36] could lay aside all this here Christmas
[55:38] tinsil he said quit all this swapping
[55:40] gifts and again I've explained that to
[55:43] you it's where you you get something you
[55:44] get something you expect something and
[55:47] we shouldn't be like that at Christmas
[55:48] if we don't get nothing we ought to be
[55:50] looking and see what we can get and all
[55:52] the rest of the year
[55:53] too one with another he said all the
[55:56] nonsense of the world just take off our
[55:59] pride oh come on church that's what we
[56:02] need to lay down at Christmas time lay
[56:04] down our pride lay it down and stomp the
[56:06] thing under foot and say Lord Jesus
[56:08] guide me to that Perfect
[56:10] Light watch something Supernatural
[56:13] happened you want to see the
[56:15] supernatural I think all of us could say
[56:16] Brother Bruce we want to see the
[56:18] supernatural so thankful for the
[56:19] testimony had what God's done in your
[56:21] life but we want to see the supernatural
[56:22] more and more we want to see healing we
[56:24] want to see the salvation of our young
[56:26] people we want to see God begin to move
[56:28] in a mighty way do we want the
[56:30] supernatural here's how a prophet said
[56:32] to happen to see it happen watch
[56:33] something Supernatural happen the holy
[56:36] spirit will come in a phenomenal way
[56:38] when when you humble yourself when you
[56:41] take off your pride and stomp it
[56:46] underfoot we think we're too big to
[56:49] fellowship with somebody or to come to
[56:50] the you know fellowship with at a church
[56:52] function because we got more money
[56:55] everybody else does we have to take out
[56:56] off and stomp
[56:58] it h think you're too big to to to to to
[57:02] go around and say well these other
[57:03] people man that you know they just act
[57:05] foolish in church and I'm just you know
[57:07] I always act good and I sit proper come
[57:09] on church we would have thought that the
[57:12] Bine bmus was foolish when he was
[57:14] screaming out and the disciples said
[57:16] stay still don't scream out anymore when
[57:18] he said Jesus th son of David have mercy
[57:21] on me we ought to take that Pride off
[57:23] and stomp it underfoot
[57:25] [Laughter]
[57:28] and you see Jesus answering and healing
[57:31] blind bame's eyes you'll see the the
[57:34] Holy Ghost come in a phenomenal way if
[57:37] we can over get our pride out of the
[57:39] way if you'd come to us today I wonder
[57:42] how he would come wonder how he did
[57:44] come today churches have drummer boys
[57:48] lowered from ceilings I know we all see
[57:50] the the videos and things and fake snow
[57:54] falling and rock and roll conerts and
[57:57] lights but the tensil surrounds it has
[58:00] death in
[58:01] it cuz it's not attracting you to the
[58:05] word right it's it's not it's attracting
[58:08] you to a Creed or to a denomination
[58:10] there's no humility in
[58:12] it but God has an attraction yes right
[58:16] and there's no Death In His attraction
[58:18] and yet we want to see what he's
[58:19] attracting us
[58:21] too God uses he uses gifts and miracles
[58:24] to attract folks atten attention to the
[58:27] word right that's what it's for he heals
[58:30] us he G we have good Services we feel
[58:33] the presence what's he trying to do to
[58:35] attract our attention to the
[58:36] word and brother bandam talks about his
[58:39] his early
[58:40] meetings and it's interesting the word
[58:43] he uses because if you type tinsel into
[58:46] the message you'd think that you'd find
[58:49] uh you'd find brother Bram condemning
[58:50] Christmas time tinsel around Christmas
[58:52] time but that's actually not what he
[58:54] uses it most of the time on he actually
[58:56] uses it about his own Ministry he talks
[58:59] about early on in his ministry he says
[59:01] when I first started in the great
[59:03] campaigns the meetings had a lot of
[59:05] tinsil then the meetings had a lot of
[59:08] tensil again this is not something that
[59:11] would kill you it's not something that's
[59:12] wrong but it had tensil to attract the
[59:15] people right an attraction he said again
[59:18] he said we think of Jesus Christ when he
[59:20] was here on Earth his first years of his
[59:22] ministry oh the tinsil was hanging
[59:24] everywhere he said the second year of
[59:26] his ministry they begin to accuse him
[59:29] and call him beab and so forth can you
[59:31] imagine you talk about moving fast the
[59:33] first year they all voted him in right
[59:37] they all loved him he's the prophet the
[59:40] second year he was be
[59:42] elub right the third year they killed
[59:46] him the same ones even look how
[59:49] changeable they were many of the same
[59:51] people that laid Palms down in palm
[59:53] branches down his way and cried hosana
[59:56] to the King was the same ones who cried
[59:58] crucify
[1:00:00] him the next few
[1:00:02] days
[1:00:04] look brother Brandon talks about that
[1:00:06] tinsel that was on his meetings he talks
[1:00:09] about staying at the Sam peek Hotel in
[1:00:12] Little Rock I think I I think the if you
[1:00:15] go look in the database it says sand
[1:00:17] dust or something like that but it's
[1:00:18] actually they they just didn't get it
[1:00:21] right he was staying at the Sam peek
[1:00:22] Hotel you can hear that on tape and and
[1:00:25] you can find that hotel where he was
[1:00:27] staying find pictures of it on the
[1:00:29] internet and he talked about how even
[1:00:31] the porters at the hotel were singing
[1:00:34] Only belief that's the meetings in
[1:00:36] Little Rock I'll think about that for a
[1:00:38] minute it it was just even in his own
[1:00:40] hotel he was staying in the porter
[1:00:42] saying only belie if you go to Africa
[1:00:44] today there's a can we say there's a lot
[1:00:46] of tinsel on the message in Africa even
[1:00:49] though it's a poor place but you go to
[1:00:51] Africa and you're liable to meet a
[1:00:52] message believer just about anywhere
[1:00:55] I've met him in airports and and you go
[1:00:58] in and they all belong to different
[1:00:59] churches but there just the churches are
[1:01:01] large and there's a lot of there's a lot
[1:01:03] of Revival and things going on it's that
[1:01:05] way the Philippines hundreds and
[1:01:07] hundreds of Believers thousands of
[1:01:09] Believers it's that way in Africa it's
[1:01:11] that way in South America right now in
[1:01:12] Brazil and different parts of the world
[1:01:15] but there's a lot going on because
[1:01:17] brother Brenham taught us that America
[1:01:19] was burn over right we' had our
[1:01:21] visitation turned it
[1:01:23] down but now we have a respon
[1:01:25] responsibility to get the word out to
[1:01:27] others and we've done that as message
[1:01:30] people to a great extent though there's
[1:01:32] still some parts of the world that need
[1:01:33] that but we've done that we've gotten it
[1:01:35] out and you can see the people respond
[1:01:37] to it brother Brown talked about his own
[1:01:39] Ministry he said there was no one else
[1:01:41] on the field at that day and the tensil
[1:01:43] was hanging everywhere and we was having
[1:01:46] a marvelous time he talked about the
[1:01:48] great Portland meetings very early in
[1:01:51] his ministry he said where thousands of
[1:01:52] people were gathered the streets were
[1:01:54] standing full and 60 some odd 100 on the
[1:01:57] inside he said and it pouring down rain
[1:01:59] the people standing there he said their
[1:02:01] hearts were longing hungry he said
[1:02:04] that's when no one else was on the field
[1:02:07] tinsel was on the meeting he said and
[1:02:10] they'd have to pull you through crowds
[1:02:12] and everything else with police escorts
[1:02:14] to get you in can you imagine if this
[1:02:17] church was like that and it's not but
[1:02:20] can you imagine if the if they had to
[1:02:22] actually es the police had to escort me
[1:02:24] in and out because of the people that
[1:02:26] were coming that's the way it was but it
[1:02:28] wasn't a building like this it was an
[1:02:29] arena filled with thousands of people
[1:02:32] we've talked about the great meetings in
[1:02:34] Jonesboro and other places he said a few
[1:02:36] years ago I came into Canada he said and
[1:02:38] had a meeting the tinsel was all on the
[1:02:40] meetings and people gathered to places
[1:02:43] where the newspapers had reported people
[1:02:45] driving as many as 3,000 miles by taxi
[1:02:48] cab you talk about a
[1:02:51] bill brother Bill used to be a taxi
[1:02:53] driver you imagine how much that would
[1:02:55] cost cost to take somebody 3,000 miles
[1:02:59] by
[1:03:00] taxi and he said but they came just to
[1:03:03] be in the presence of the outpouring of
[1:03:06] the
[1:03:07] spirit and yet brother Bram goes back in
[1:03:11] 1957 and says this tonight after much
[1:03:16] advertisement and trying to cooperate
[1:03:18] with everybody and showing the same
[1:03:21] spirit that we did when we first come
[1:03:23] yet it's hard to get a little group of
[1:03:25] people to fill a small Arena like this
[1:03:28] he said then you could wonder why is it
[1:03:31] that ministers hearts are
[1:03:34] alarmed right our hearts get alarmed
[1:03:36] even at Christmas time why because you
[1:03:38] see that that the T soul is not on the
[1:03:41] message right are you with especially
[1:03:43] here in the US it's not on the message
[1:03:45] but can you see beyond that can you see
[1:03:47] when he's wrapped in humility can you
[1:03:49] see him as he
[1:03:53] is he said all the ministers today
[1:03:55] having such a time with get their people
[1:03:57] out to prayer meeting on Wednesday night
[1:03:59] he said they love television programs
[1:04:01] they love Amusement Sunday they don't
[1:04:02] want to come to church on Sunday many of
[1:04:04] them they tell me the ministers that the
[1:04:06] church pews are emptying out I'm not
[1:04:08] preaching at you folks that are sick
[1:04:09] today or gone I I know sometimes always
[1:04:11] the wrong people hear the message but
[1:04:13] I'm trying to get a point here about the
[1:04:14] tinsel that went off of that
[1:04:17] age right the tinsel the churches he
[1:04:20] said the pews are emptying out because
[1:04:22] people are beginning to go the world
[1:04:23] offers so much class and so much fancy
[1:04:26] and ensil upon the things of the world
[1:04:28] and the people fall for that he said now
[1:04:31] that shows that at the beginning they
[1:04:32] had nothing to start with if you love
[1:04:34] God you couldn't wire you away from
[1:04:35] church they couldn't chain you away from
[1:04:37] it they can't hide a Believer from God
[1:04:41] but the the modern church has music and
[1:04:43] show and I'm not being critical church
[1:04:45] I'm trying not to be but we don't want
[1:04:48] that we we don't have that for we have
[1:04:50] music and wonderful music but we don't
[1:04:51] want to make it a show why do we not
[1:04:53] make it a show because we want to focus
[1:04:55] to be on the word not on what I'm saying
[1:04:58] but regardless of who stands behind the
[1:05:00] sacred desk the focus ought to be on the
[1:05:02] word because the word is Christ and
[1:05:05] Christ can make a difference in your
[1:05:06] life Christ can change you Christ can
[1:05:08] heal
[1:05:11] you instead of declarations today the
[1:05:15] preacher makes
[1:05:17] suggestions right and apologizes for the
[1:05:21] suggestion but Peter said to preach like
[1:05:24] it was the Oracles of God
[1:05:27] right they took the
[1:05:29] paper the
[1:05:31] pcil left the present laying there
[1:05:34] brother brandham calls and he was
[1:05:36] talking about in in the literal sense
[1:05:38] but he says Pharisee the foolish
[1:05:40] that's why word he used Pharisee
[1:05:43] the foolish he said he said got
[1:05:45] Christ there because he would attract
[1:05:47] the crowd remember when he invited him
[1:05:49] Jesus goes where he's invited but he
[1:05:51] said the foolish left the left the
[1:05:54] gift sitting there with washed feet and
[1:05:57] took the wrapper and the
[1:06:01] tinsil everyone wants healing and
[1:06:03] blessings but that's just the paper he's
[1:06:05] wrapped in now that's a good thing but
[1:06:08] he's just he's wrapped in that we but we
[1:06:10] want him we want to Humble ourselves to
[1:06:13] his will look brother said they want the
[1:06:16] paper sure something that's all tin so a
[1:06:18] lot of fuss they can do about it but the
[1:06:20] real gift that's on the inside of it
[1:06:22] they don't want
[1:06:23] it by the time you hung on a cross
[1:06:26] the ensil was gone from the
[1:06:28] meetings right when all the crowds would
[1:06:30] follow him around now that they they
[1:06:33] cried out crucify him they only followed
[1:06:35] him to see how he would fail where
[1:06:37] before they followed him to see a
[1:06:38] miracle and something happened with
[1:06:40] expectation now they followed him to see
[1:06:42] how he would
[1:06:43] die to watch him be killed under Roman
[1:06:47] judgment they cried out crucify him once
[1:06:50] the tsil was off there was no Beauty to
[1:06:53] make them want him
[1:06:55] don't you see why it had to be Shepherds
[1:06:57] even at his birth because others
[1:06:59] wouldn't have seen the beauty of it but
[1:07:02] Shepherds knew how to take care of
[1:07:04] lambs but the B said he they knew how to
[1:07:07] take care of lambs and he was the Lamb
[1:07:08] of God born to die for our
[1:07:11] sins I want to tell you today I believe
[1:07:14] I believe he's here today he's here in
[1:07:16] the form of the word one day we'll see
[1:07:18] him in body form but today he's here in
[1:07:20] form of the word but this message is
[1:07:22] more than tinsel and glamour it's more
[1:07:24] than healing meetings it's more than big
[1:07:25] preachers and big churches building
[1:07:27] kingdoms it's more than that the message
[1:07:29] is still Christ it always will be Christ
[1:07:33] it always will be one who come into our
[1:07:35] world and we always will worship him
[1:07:37] listen to me as long as I got any
[1:07:38] influence at all in this church I want
[1:07:40] to worship Christ I don't want it to be
[1:07:42] about a preacher I don't want it to be
[1:07:44] about something else going on I want it
[1:07:46] to be because he's here and I don't care
[1:07:49] if there's 5 here 25 we ought to be able
[1:07:51] to shout in his presence we ought to be
[1:07:53] able to rejoice in his presence we ought
[1:07:55] to be able to reach out to him and our
[1:07:56] needs be
[1:07:58] met let the tensil come off of it but if
[1:08:01] he's hanging there if though the word be
[1:08:03] crucified let me see him and say my Lord
[1:08:06] and my
[1:08:09] God
[1:08:10] Hallelujah the message is still
[1:08:13] Christ Matthew 11:28 he said come unto
[1:08:16] me all ye that
[1:08:19] labor oh church I'm not going to preach
[1:08:21] long this morning I'll leave that to
[1:08:22] brother Joel this afternoon
[1:08:26] but I want you to understand Christmas
[1:08:28] is not about the tensil and I want you
[1:08:31] to understand even deeper this message
[1:08:33] the birth of the word in our hour it's
[1:08:35] not about the
[1:08:36] tinel but it's about the presence of
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ himself the literal Life of
[1:08:41] Christ coming back on the
[1:08:44] believer he said come unto me all ye
[1:08:47] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[1:08:51] will give you
[1:08:53] rest take my yoke upon you learn of me
[1:08:57] for I am meek and lowly in heart you
[1:09:00] shall find
[1:09:02] rest your
[1:09:04] souls can you see him calling you to
[1:09:07] come through the tensil can you see the
[1:09:10] word made
[1:09:13] flesh can you see him the way he comes
[1:09:16] to you B told the story about the man
[1:09:19] who decided one year he wasn't going to
[1:09:21] put up a tree he wasn't going to do any
[1:09:23] of that he said Lord this year for
[1:09:25] Christmas I want I want you to
[1:09:27] come he said I want you to come and have
[1:09:29] dinner with me and he felt like the Lord
[1:09:32] promised him that he would he come under
[1:09:33] such
[1:09:35] expectation that he prepared a dinner
[1:09:38] for the Lord and he laid out the table
[1:09:40] and he made everything just right and he
[1:09:42] set out a plate for him and for the Lord
[1:09:45] and he set out one for he said just in
[1:09:47] case the disciples dropped
[1:09:48] by so he had his table spread and he
[1:09:52] waited and he waited and no nobody came
[1:09:55] came and he said Lord where are you and
[1:09:57] pretty soon a knock come on the door and
[1:10:00] it was a a
[1:10:02] beggar just a man with nothing he said
[1:10:05] sir he said I'm cold I don't got nothing
[1:10:07] to wear nothing to eat do you have
[1:10:10] anything you can help me with and and he
[1:10:12] said oh sure he said I'm expecting a
[1:10:14] guest he said but you can come in come
[1:10:16] eat with me while we wait on our guest
[1:10:20] so he gave him his food and there's
[1:10:22] different ways that they tell the story
[1:10:24] but was uh another person come an old
[1:10:27] woman that come by and she was fed and a
[1:10:29] little a little child that was fed as
[1:10:33] well and and they all stopped by and
[1:10:35] still he waited on Jesus to come still
[1:10:38] waiting on him to honor him and said
[1:10:40] Lord you promis you would come he began
[1:10:42] to cry be to call Lord you promised and
[1:10:44] the Lord spoke to him and said I was
[1:10:47] there didn't you see me in the beggar
[1:10:50] amen see he didn't come right in a way
[1:10:52] that he would expect him to come at
[1:10:54] Christmas time but he come wrapped in
[1:10:56] flesh church can you see Pastor tinsel
[1:10:59] and see Christ in the hearts of the
[1:11:01] people can you see him in our young
[1:11:03] people can you see him in your brothers
[1:11:04] and sisters can you see him in in the
[1:11:07] people in your family can you see
[1:11:10] Christ oh church that's where he's
[1:11:12] hiding himself today that's where he's
[1:11:14] failed
[1:11:15] today brother brandom said St Martin
[1:11:18] before he was known as St Martin he
[1:11:20] wasn't he was a Christian but he didn't
[1:11:22] wasn't a preacher
[1:11:25] and he one day he was he was a military
[1:11:28] man one day he uh he was standing there
[1:11:33] on guard and he sees an old beggar
[1:11:36] shivering and people passing by no one
[1:11:39] will give him anything to to cover
[1:11:41] himself and in the cold he might die so
[1:11:44] Martin had his heavy coat on was issued
[1:11:47] to him by the Roman army he comes and
[1:11:49] takes that coat or the army that he was
[1:11:51] in takes that coat and he his his cloak
[1:11:54] and he just takes his sword and he cuts
[1:11:56] it in two and he wraps the little beggar
[1:11:58] in that
[1:12:00] coat and that night he he goes to the
[1:12:03] messall and he sits there and takes his
[1:12:05] his his armor off and things and he's
[1:12:08] sitting there eating and all of a sudden
[1:12:10] Christ appeared to him and when he
[1:12:13] appeared to him he wasn't wearing purple
[1:12:15] robes he wasn't wearing a white robe he
[1:12:19] wasn't wearing garments of heaven but he
[1:12:21] was actually wearing the half of a robe
[1:12:25] that Martin gave to the beggar and
[1:12:27] brother Brown uses that to illustrate
[1:12:29] the fact God don't show up like we
[1:12:31] expect him to come on Church how many
[1:12:33] times do we come to the house of God and
[1:12:35] we want God to show up on our schedule
[1:12:37] and in the way we want him to come but I
[1:12:38] say we need to stop that today it's time
[1:12:41] we learn that he comes on his own
[1:12:43] schedule and he comes in his own Veil
[1:12:45] and sometimes he's a Sunday school
[1:12:47] student and sometimes he's a preacher
[1:12:49] and sometimes he said he comes in our
[1:12:52] midst sometimes he's a stranger visits
[1:12:54] us and we got to learn to see
[1:12:57] him see him at Christmas time see beyond
[1:12:59] the tinsil see beyond the struggle
[1:13:03] Beyond well I don't want to go there do
[1:13:06] that because that would be difficult can
[1:13:07] you see the word made flesh can you
[1:13:10] defend it brother brandom illustrates
[1:13:13] that he uses that St Martin's coat and
[1:13:15] then types it to his own
[1:13:18] Ministry he said what can I do in these
[1:13:21] matters
[1:13:22] then so he's talking about the word he
[1:13:25] he's preached a message called the
[1:13:26] falling apart of the
[1:13:28] world and he calls it at one place he
[1:13:30] calls it the world is again falling
[1:13:32] apart because he was told about how on
[1:13:35] Christmas time was a Christmas message
[1:13:37] brother R almost always preached a
[1:13:39] Christmas message sometimes several but
[1:13:42] he preached the falling apart of the
[1:13:43] world and when he preached that he said
[1:13:46] that at Christmas time the world was
[1:13:48] falling apart the Roman world and Christ
[1:13:50] come into that time and he typed that to
[1:13:53] the own he come in unrecognized he T
[1:13:55] that to the age that we're living in and
[1:13:57] he said what can I do in these matters
[1:13:59] then what must I do with these things
[1:14:02] that I know that's right these things
[1:14:04] has been confirmed and proved they're
[1:14:06] right what can I do what do you
[1:14:10] see he saw people begging for life
[1:14:14] looking for something what did he do he
[1:14:16] took what he'd been given are you with
[1:14:19] me now he said wrap the
[1:14:21] church he's talking about Martin's coat
[1:14:24] he said wrap the church not in a a Creed
[1:14:27] or denomination but in the blood of
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ by his word you realize
[1:14:32] what this meant Oh that ought to make a
[1:14:33] shout and this message is to us it's a
[1:14:36] wrapping of the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:14:38] his word there had to be somebody there
[1:14:41] God uses men God used the prophet to
[1:14:43] wrap Us in the blood we're Washed by the
[1:14:47] Water of the word that's the way he
[1:14:48] loves us that's how he shows his love to
[1:14:50] us he said husbands love your wives as
[1:14:53] Christ loved the church who gave himself
[1:14:55] for it and wash it by the water of the
[1:14:57] word oh church he said what can I do
[1:15:01] wrap the church not a DEC Creed or
[1:15:02] denomination but in the blood of Jesus
[1:15:04] Christ by his word so Jesus said what
[1:15:06] you've done to these you've done to me
[1:15:08] what's our main goal church I know we
[1:15:10] want to feed the hungry want to do all
[1:15:11] of that but our main goal is to wrap the
[1:15:13] people in the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:15:16] his word to make you so protected by the
[1:15:19] word where the world can fall apart and
[1:15:20] you'll still be
[1:15:22] okay Hallelujah recognize that Christ
[1:15:26] was in the people and his faithfulness
[1:15:28] to the word
[1:15:29] mattered ours matters
[1:15:32] today I wonder if we can see beyond the
[1:15:35] Christmas tinsil musicians go ahead and
[1:15:38] come I wasn't
[1:15:42] lying can you see
[1:15:45] beyond the Christmas
[1:15:47] tcil can the word be
[1:15:50] born in the manger of your
[1:15:52] heart and you see him visit
[1:15:57] I know everybody wants to condemn
[1:15:59] Christmas but Christmas sometimes isn't
[1:16:01] the problem it's our
[1:16:05] pride it's our
[1:16:08] pride right and I say if you got a
[1:16:10] problem with falling down worshiping
[1:16:11] trees you should get rid of your
[1:16:14] tree if you worship Santa Claus and I
[1:16:16] don't think we should teach our kids a
[1:16:18] story that's not true because what what
[1:16:20] do they say when we tell them about
[1:16:23] Jesus that story is true tell them the
[1:16:26] truth tell him the truth about
[1:16:28] Christmas but he
[1:16:30] came why don't we
[1:16:33] just why can't we just set aside our
[1:16:36] pride you know and and I'm just
[1:16:39] preaching to you from my heart and
[1:16:40] talking to you from my heart but as
[1:16:42] message people we took so much pride in
[1:16:44] being
[1:16:47] different and we separated ourselves
[1:16:49] said well we don't do Christmas like
[1:16:51] everybody
[1:16:53] else when it was the pride that was the
[1:16:56] problem sir all
[1:16:58] along what kept us from seeing
[1:17:03] Christ was the problem all along they
[1:17:06] put they put an attraction on it and
[1:17:08] pointed the people to a dog man and
[1:17:10] Creed but if there is any attraction
[1:17:12] today let it be the sweetness of a life
[1:17:15] of a life that's lived according to the
[1:17:17] word by the message of the hour let it
[1:17:20] be an attraction to the world that we
[1:17:21] live in and he said these signs will
[1:17:23] follow them that believe let let that be
[1:17:25] an attraction not the main thing but an
[1:17:27] attraction to the world that we live in
[1:17:29] that we can know he's alive he's the
[1:17:31] same yesterday today and forever he he
[1:17:33] was here as a baby but he's not a baby
[1:17:35] no more now he's in the manger of our
[1:17:37] heart he lives in you and I can we see
[1:17:40] him that way church can we recognize his
[1:17:42] presence worship him when he comes not
[1:17:44] be like the Pharisee that that that that
[1:17:47] took the wrapping and the Glamour and
[1:17:48] threw away the present but may we accept
[1:17:50] him and say Lord I want to wash your
[1:17:52] feet I want to worship you at Christmas
[1:17:54] time brother said we ought it ought to
[1:17:56] be a time of worship not just a
[1:17:57] celebration but a time of worship at
[1:17:59] Christmas
[1:18:00] time I pray we'd make it that with all
[1:18:04] of my heart let's pray together Heavenly
