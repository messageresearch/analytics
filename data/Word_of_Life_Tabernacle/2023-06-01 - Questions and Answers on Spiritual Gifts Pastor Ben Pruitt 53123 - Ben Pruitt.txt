Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be in your house tonight and the Lord just stand here with those of like Precious Faith who've been bought by your blood and redeemed from the earth we're so grateful for that today Lord and Lord we come to your word today wash Us by Your Word Lord wash away all the old ideas and superstitions and traditions Lord that would keep us from manifesting the word of the hour I pray that you'd help us Lord and all that we do Lord maybe there's some need represented here tonight that I wouldn't know I pray you'd move me Lord out of the way and speak directly to that need tonight or whatever kind of service we need to have Lord we submit that to you tonight and we trust you we believe that you'll do it and you'll work in the way that only you can will give you the praise and the glory and the honor for that in Jesus name amen amen God bless you this evening we're going to go to Ephesians 4 7 Ephesians 4 verses 7 and 8. I want to just answer a couple of questions actually we have five questions if we get to them all tonight and then we'll be done on the gifts I hope it's been a blessing to you there's a purpose to it and and uh you know sometimes you you come to church and you think well I'm not going to get anything out of this service and that's usually the case but if you come expecting that God can move things around to to speak directly to you then that that'll be the case as well and so how many are expecting the Lord to speak to them tonight amen God bless you Ephesians 4 7 but unto every one of us that's all of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascendeth ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men I pray the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated brother Branham taught us in in questions and answers that he said the reason we do this is to kind of find out what's on the hearts of the people and I will say this not very many people ask questions but the ones that do generally ask questions that everybody else was thinking as well I know it's hard with questions because uh a lot of times the questions the good questions that you have you forget about them you have them while the sermon's going on and then you forget about them later so if you've forgotten the question want to ask me later that'll be fine as well but maybe the question that someone else had will help you as well tonight he said I think that's very good for a pastor to give out this and then he finds out just about what the people's thinking about if they'll write their questions they have something he said I think every one of us is Duty bound to expel our thoughts to our pastors and their there's a lesson here on communication that we it's not just a one-way Street I know I get to stand up here and talk to you all the time but you do get to talk back just not during the service but you you do get to talk back you have a right to question and to ask questions with an honest heart and that don't mean that you're dumb or or you're ignorant it just means that you want to learn and so there's no such thing as a stupid question uh if we could say it that way he said we're Duty bound to expel our thoughts to our pastors and our spiritual leaders and so forth and anything that we see that so we can make everything run smooth and fine for the kingdom of God's sake so I want to get to the first one tonight was on healing and we all need healing don't we we live in bodies that need to be healed and we we touched on this on gifts of healing during uh during the series on the gifts if you want to go back and listen to that but the question was this they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover does the person who is sick have to agree slash want to be healed or is it on the faith of the anointed one praying and I think the simple answer to that is healing is based on your faith the faith of the individual being prayed for but I want to dig into that just a little bit if you'll give me some time tonight to dig into that that uh you know we believe in laying hands on the sick because in Mark 16 and 18 it says they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Jesus was asked to do this most famously in Mark 5 22 there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on Earth that she may be healed and she shall live that was where his faith was he said if you can come and lay your hands on my daughter she's going to be well but he had to have faith to ask so it's the faith of the person that's asking you can't just go lay hands on people that don't want it right and that's why many people the the point of a prayer line is not to it's not to get excited it's not to shout and yet you you would if you really understood what was taking place that you met the conditions of the Bible and but but it's because you come with a need on your heart and it may be a little thing I've taught my children that if there's a prayer line they need to go through it and there's a reason for that because there's always something that we need there's something and it may be something well I'm not as close to God as I want to be but if there's an opportunity I've taught them go go through the prayer line and and and I do it myself every time we have a prayer line I don't know if you all realize it but most of the time I will actually go through the prayer line at the end because I want to I want to participate in that I've got needs too I I've got things that I don't want hands laid on me that that don't make you a sinner don't want to have hands laid on you it means you have faith for healing so Jairus had faith and yet there's an even greater Faith than that now brother Branham said he said if he speaking of Christ was standing here right now wearing this suit he'd probably have to get one that was smaller but if he was standing here wearing this suit he could not heal you unless you believed him I like that he could not heal you Jesus could not just stand there and heal people they had to believe in fact the Bible says there was many that were not healed because of their unbelief I say Lord help me to believe help me to believe now he said he could tell you what was your trouble a lot of things like that but he couldn't heal you because he's already done it by his stripes we were healed let me believe that tonight is that right he said already over he said it's done done I like that it's done done every person he said now listen close this week I've tried to get you now he's moving towards something else he said I've tried to get you to see the greater way of doing it he said now there was a Jew one time that said come lay your hands on my daughter and she shall live and that was a Jewish custom laying on of hands but the Roman the Gentile said I'm not worthy that you come under my roof just speak the word when you see his word made manifest he said not only with me but with you he said and this is how it works now he says my faith in a gift so you want the person that's praying to have faith in what they're who they are right brother said Jesus had perfect faith in who he was and that's why he could cast The Devil out of the epileptic child right he had perfect faith in who he was he said the devil doesn't get scared at screaming and hollering and shouting he gets scared when he sees a life he sees the life oh that's the kind of life that I want he sees a Life coming and and he saw that Jesus knew who he was and so he stood there knowing who he was was able to do what the disciples could not do so but he said he hadn't he he said it's not made manifest not only with me but with you my faith in a gift your faith in the god that sent the gift and see it working between us he said that's God he said I just wish I could get that to every one of you see if your pastor lays hands on you you've got to have faith that in your pastor that he's a man of God but but I can't just that alone won't do it you got to have faith in God that there's something Supernatural something more than your pastor and then when you have hands laid on you then you can go and say hey I've come according to God's word God's word said that was more than a pastor that was God's word that said I could be healed I would be healed so now I I have to have confidence in my own life or I can't lay hands on you and believe for your healing right brother Branham dealt with that he couldn't pray for the baby because he had lied on the phone you remember the story so if you're going to pray for somebody you need to have confidence in your own life that you that that you're going to pray for that person but then on the other side it's in the faith of the person that's where really the healing gets because sometimes there could even be a man that didn't have that wasn't living right could lay hands on somebody and that person could still get healed and the reason for that is because of the person's faith now he said I wish I could get he said every one of you to see every one of you if I could only get this little group to see that he said there'll be another Pentecost happen right now if I could get you to really comprehend what it is let's go look at at the Centurion for a minute see how see how he did it because this is that greater thing that Brandon said he was trying to get the people to he said when Jesus was entering into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant laugh at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and Jesus says unto him I will come and heal him he offered to come to the house and I'll be honest with you I'm not turning that down Jesus said I'll come and heal him hey let's have the prayer line but the Centurion doesn't understand their customs right he's kind of like the people we dealt with in Egypt or something we deal with overseas they don't understand and so they just believe he's like he said well you know you're a man of authority he said Lord I'm not worthy that that has come under my roof and see my television I just made that part up he said but speak the word only I like that he said I'm not a guy I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof but speak the word see he's not bound by tradition he doesn't expect God to move in any certain way you don't believe we don't understand the power that's in that if we could come expecting God to do whatever God wants to do that on a Wednesday night he could heal the sick he could he could cleanse the leper he could he could restore the fallen on a Wednesday night on a Sunday morning on a regular service if we could just expect God even not even in church if we could expect God to move on the job see he said you don't have to be here right he said speak the word only my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth to another come and he cometh unto my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and he said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel because they had a custom of laying on of hands but this was this was greater and yet it does not do away with laying on of hands it's something we need because I'll be honest with you I need sometimes I don't have as much Faith as I should have and I need I need to I need you to help me I need I need you to I need you to agree with me and that's what laying on of hands is that's you and me agreeing and putting our faith together so brother Brandon called it a Jewish custom because it's Deuteronomy 34 9 Joshua the son of none was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands upon him he laid his hands upon him and what what he was doing he was he was sanctioning him see Moses didn't put the spirit of wisdom in Joshua but he was sanctioning the spirit that was there there's a new testament parallel with Timothy Paul said stir up the gift that's in you he said by that by he said which was given you by prophecy and the laying on of hands of the Presbytery or the elders and brother Brandon said they weren't giving him the gift because gifts and callings are without repentance but they were they were sanctioning the gift the gift had to be sanctioned and what we're doing is it gives you confidence because I'm sanctioning the word that is true I'm saying it's true you're saying it's true and we agree together right and that's why laying on of hands works because I believe it and you believe it so and so again it's it takes both but you have to have faith you have to have faith where it doesn't do any good and and so you can't convey an office to someone by laying on of hands you can only sanction the office they have from God brother Brandon says I come not to heal the sick he said I come to pray for God's sick children God heal for sick the sick is already healed but anyone knows that he said I didn't come to save the lost I come to tell the Lost are already saved if they'll just accept it have come to tell those who have been saved and once this evidence that they've got the assurance and tasted the Heavenly gifts from across Jordan Yonder as Hebrews 6 said they would but made partakers of the Holy Ghost and tasted Heavenly gifts he said now if you're sick tonight I say to you that one that I'm talking about when he died at Calvary right there the stripes across his back and the sight of God purchased your healing you are already healed and he goes on he talks about the Pentecostal group who believed in gifts giving gifts by laying on of hands and how they made that mistake he said we might recognize them and our hands on them as Paul did Timothy there to sanction it he said knowing that he the gift was in him they've seen it work he said they'd just give him the right hand to Fellowship like to bring him into the service of God he said and that's listen that's the only thing we do by laying our hands on the sickness there's no miraculous power in the hands of the person right do we all understand that there's no power in that the power is in the faith of the person but we're sanctioning that so he said that's the only thing we do by laying our hands on the sick when they're sick because Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe he said the people that believed would lay their hands on the sick as a sanction that they believed it all right so it's the exact same thing we do with deacons when we ordain deacons they're we're not we're not uh we can't we can't make them something God didn't make them ordained preachers we can't make them something God didn't make them but we're sanctioning the gift that's already there he said he said now the people that believed would lay their hands on the sick the people that believed would lay their hands on the sick and as a sanction that they believed it now the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's exactly right he said now that's under conditions if you believe it he said now I believe this God's proved it to you I believe it he said you see he manifests his word to show that it is his word so he's telling the people and this is when brother branham's in the prayer line about to begin the prayer line in perfect Faith he said he manifests this word to show you that it is his word a scripture fulfillment so brother Brandon has already been through the discernment he's discerned the hearts of some of those that sat in the audience so he said I believe this I believe God's proved his word to you he said now you believe he said when you passed by he said will you do it and and so that's how they received their healings by agreeing with him and then he laid his hands on them now if you had the same confidence when he believed the word written about himself if you had that same kind of confidence when you come through a prayer line or come and ask your pastor to pray for you or someone else to pray for you you would leave there shouting the victory that's what brother random said he said you would leave shouting because you believe it's done amen amen so it's in your faith so now the second question is more on on the line of Deliverance in a in a mental health issue who worships the demons can they be delivered by the prayers of the Bride or do they have to want Deliverance now this is this one I had to think about this one because a person without any mental faculties could not worship I don't believe they could worship a demon if they'd never had any mental faculties because you have to worship god with your body Soul and Spirit with your heart with your mind and you would have to worship a demon you would have to willfully worship you can't worship something uh in that sense I don't believe that you could worship that demon accidentally right you don't have to worry about that by the way say something would happen and you would lose your mind say all of a sudden well now I'm worshiping a demon you're not gonna you're still saved even if even if you lose your mental faculties I proved that half the time you know but you're still saved even if you're not smart praise God but you're saved even if you if you had a mental health issue but I don't believe that you could worship a demon in that condition but it would be like a child you understand a child they can't have faith for themselves but you have to have faith for them so that's different when you lay hands on a child a small child someone that's not come to the age of accountability that child up to a certain age State they can't even talk yet they can't have faith for themselves they can't understand the scripture but that's up to you and I right the same with someone who had a mental health issue now were they where this is taken from is the maniac in Portland you remember the maniac and Portland come in front of brother Branham it's a great story it comes in front of brother Branham in that great meeting and gotten out of the insane institution and he comes before brother random he says I'm going to knock you into Yesterday basically and and he comes up there and when he comes and brother Brandon said brother Brandon said he loved him and he tells us that in in the uh love and the sermon on love he said he loved him and he did not fear him but he said you'll fall over my feet right and the maniac fell over his feet and they asked him they said is is he delivered and he said no he said he worships the demon and but listen the way the way he says that he said I said no sir he worships that spirit see he said he'd bring it right back to him because he thinks he's right so in other words if you put him in his sound mind he would he because he worshiped that demon before he got sick that's what put him in that condition he'll worship it again now there's there's cases like that where a person say could get delivered of alcohol or drugs or a sexual addiction they worship that demon and it got a hold of him that demon can be cast off of them in a service right and really be cast off but that person if they worship that devil they'll go right back to it now we don't know that but brother Branham being a prophet knew that that this man worshiped that demon so you could cat he said I could cast It Off the one brother random couldn't cast to The Devil out but it was that he would go right back to it as soon as he because he thinks he's right we need to align our thoughts to the word don't we we need to come to the word amen so so I think in a mental health issue to answer the question uh I think yes they could be delivered by the prayers of the Bride for someone who'd always been that way you would pray for healing for that person and and we wouldn't know if they if they worship that demon if that's the way that they are you just pray for people and you believe that God's able to overcome any situation now now and he's able he's able to heal mental as much as he is physical how many believe that tonight we live in an age where mental health has become a real issue especially with young people and and we see it here in the church he said well that don't bother us we know we're Christians that's not true we still live in this world where those little dots of light and all that blackness and there's a mental health crisis in the world and we see it come right in the church and and I don't want to condemn you for that but there's a the scripture we believe in healing so let the doctors do what they can do I I think there's situations where a person could take medicine or do something I wouldn't condemn them for that at all I would never do that because sometimes you got to get your mind right to be able to even even accept the gospel so there's situations where you would have to take medicine or even even have somebody to talk to in counseling or something like that but always remember put your faith in God and and when that counseling contradicts the word go with God not with the counseling we have more of that than what people realize it's just the age that we live in so the third question was on Prophecy prophecy what what is prophecy a sign of to the believer these are good questions what is prophecy a sign of to the believer well I would say it's a sign of God's presence it's a sign that he's there and they take that from First Corinthians 14 22 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which belief so tongues are assigned to the unbeliever what is prophecy a sign of it's a sign to the believer it's a sign of God's presence but Branham says this I love this quote he said I can show you where God put gifts and Power in the church I want somebody to put your finger on a scripture show me where he took it out I love that where he took it back from the church it's a super sign to the believer I'm glad you asked this question because it caused me to find this quote it's a super sign to the believer that we've passed from death into life because we feel the Holy Ghost and see it working on our lives changing us from what we were to what we are now so prophecy is a sign is assigned to the believer of his presence the super side but the random said when we see any of these gifts operating in that manner now prophecy and discernment let's talk about this for just a moment this is the fourth question kind of goes with the last one what is prophecy and how does it differ from discernment now I I talked about this in in one of the in the in the uh when I talked about prophets uh prophets prophecy and a prophet but when I talked about that I didn't deal as much with the gift of Prophecy as I did with a prophet and that was on purpose and we found you remember what we found out that there's a major prophet and then there are preachers a modern day preacher is a prophet right an inspired preacher inspired speaker is a prophet but what is the difference between that and discernment that's a good question Discerning means to judge we talked about that under discernment but let's bring the two together to discern a spirit is to judge whether it's right or not so discernment is not what brother Branham was doing the gift of discernment in First Corinthians 14 as far as I can tell that is not the same thing as what brother Branham was doing when he stood up and and used his gift he called it a gift of discernment but it was the word Discerning the thought sentence of the heart does everybody understand that it was a major prophet standing there and doing that but to discern the gift of discernment is to discern between Spirits judge whether something is right or wrong so a spirit of Prophecy is to be judged by discernment a spirit of Prophecy is to be judged by two or three that has discernment before it can ever be given to the church so prophecy is inspired foretelling of a future event or in the case of a minister forth telling of the word the Bible says the spirit the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so it's foretelling of a future event some something that's not in the scripture or in the case of a minister something in the scripture foretelling of the word so we have the gift of Prophecy today we believe that but what brother Branham did was unique was absolutely unique this was more than a gift of discernment this was more than a gift of Prophecy so how would a gift of Prophecy operate itself in this in the church well it would be that the prophet would speak inspired and he would say brother Joe next week's gonna have trouble at his work he needs to watch out there's going to be some extra work he's going to get tired and he's going to run off the road and it's like he needs to watch for that there's going to be a certain thing to happen today we we almost ran into a wreck and uh somebody had a wreck there in Mountain Home at the at the intersection and so maybe the gift would say well there's going to be a wreck there and you need to not be there at a certain time that's a gift of Prophecy you say can God really do that absolutely you can but now if a gift if a prophet stood up and said in the church and said thus saith the Lord the Lord is coming well that's good but that would be a preacher that would do that that's the job of the preacher it might be inspired but it's not his job to do that it's the job of the preacher because I can stand here and say thus saith the Lord the Lord is coming and if you're qualified to preach trust me I'll use you to preach because we need all the preachers we can get but we'll stand up here and say thus saith the Lord the Lord is coming that we can say that from the scripture so that would be prophecy as well but it would be forth telling of the word so do you understand that prophecy would be something direct to the people of God so and that's different from discernment discernment is is actually it's whether the prophecy is true or not and what but whatever the Branham had was Discerning the thought sentence of the heart and the Corinthians 14 gift of discernment is nothing like that it's it's as far as I can tell simply the ability to judge between Spirits right and wrong so now the last question was on dreams and Visions because this is something we didn't cover we're divisions and dreams fall under the nine spiritual gifts are you still with me tonight this is a good question because I didn't cover this at all uh how many of you dream some people don't dream most people dream but some people don't dream at all there'll be people say well I saw a dream once when I was a kid or maybe I never saw one uh how many of you have ever seen a vision there's a few of you that have seen a vision now the Bible tells us that he said your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions as a result of the outpouring of Joel 2 28 this is scripture as a result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit uh that there would be uh at Pentecost that there would be people that would dream dreams and see Visions in a spiritual way now I'll say this most of the dreams that we dream are not spiritual at least I'll speak for myself there right right and so we have to be careful to to know the difference and and I'll it's difficult it's very difficult it's why we don't leave the church by dreams they can be helpful but that's not the primary method of leading the church and I'm gonna show that to you in just a minute now in in uh brother said there's a difference between dreams and Visions dreams is when you go to sleep Visions is when you don't go to sleep he said we're born that way the ordinary human being when he dreams it's in his subconscious and his subconscious is way away from him so his senses is active as long as he's in his first conscience so what he has to do he has to go to sleep in order for that subconscious to get close enough for him to be able to dream right that's the average first that's the way I am I don't have to sleep for long I can be I can I can go to sleep if I take a five minute nap I Dreamed a five minute dream so that's I dream every every moment I think that I've ever been asleep I've been dreaming and that's just the way it is why I know they're not all spiritual but it's just the way that I sleep but dreams is when you go to sleep Visions he said when you don't go to sleep he said and so since this is active as long as he's in his first conscience he said in this conscience you're normal he said you see taste feel smelling here but when you're in your subconscious asleep you don't have neither see taste feel smell or here by the way I found out something the other day somebody asked said why doesn't everybody ever dream about cell phones think about it I don't know if you've ever seen a dream that involved a cell phone but I I don't guess anybody ever has you don't ever dream you have them in your hand all the time you never dream about them it's interesting it's like it's another conscience but that's not gospel it's just it and boy I got you thinking didn't I if I ever if I ever dreamed a dream involved a cell phone that's what they say in this conscience you're normal he said you taste feel smell and hear see taste fill smelling here but when you're in your subconscious of sleep you don't neither see taste feel smell or hear but there's something when you dream that you return back to this conscience so you you go back and you relive some things he said there's a memory that you remember something you dreamed about years ago he said the ordinary human being is that way but when God predestinates something this subconscious is not away from here to the Seer but both Consciousness is right together and the Seer in a vision doesn't go to sleep he's still in his senses and sees it he said I was explaining that for some doctors the other day and they raised up and said marvelous never even thought of such a thing he said when I was taking a wave test which I think what he's talking about is an EEG he said he said when I was taking a wave test and they said they had never seen anything like that said well said there's something happens to you I said I I told it he said that's it exactly so they could actually see brother Brandon's brain responding to the vision that's interesting isn't it so the two Consciousness sit right close together he said it's nothing I could do he said don't make me no more than no anybody else it's just God made it that way see the dreamer is no more than one that Don't Dream It's just the way it is the one who sees Vision God just made them a certain way he said you don't go to sleep he said stand here on the platform talking to people you hear me going divisions and come back he said when I'm riding in a car with you anywhere else to tell you things that's going to happen and never fails now here's a major prophet and here's the difference in someone that just has a vision because you could right that's part of that's scriptural to have a vision but here's a major prophet it never fails right he said has anybody ever seen it fail the congregation says no no sir it can't fail it won't fail as long as it's gone he said notice right on the platform thousands before tens of thousands of people even in other languages I can't even speak he said still it don't fail it's God you see brother Branham I don't want to be careful and say this but we've seen a lot of people that act spiritual I had a preacher's kid the other day and someone who's been raised in a pastor's home he told me he said he said you know he said I asked my dad he said why is it that it's always the spiritual ones that cause the most trouble uh but you know I will say I I you know when you move in the spiritual realm you're nervous you're excitable and so that could be a real thing but it does seem like that but but brother Brown didn't have to act spiritual you'd have to let people know that he was spiritual he was spiritual he was a prophet it's just what he was he was never not a prophet he always was a prophet just like you were always a Christian you were predestined to be a Christian aren't you glad for that nothing could take that away from you uh a real preacher nothing will take that gift away from their life right that's what they are it's just who they are so he said when you uh hear a prophet Rising he said this got all the answers to every gimmick now listen to this that you can bring up remember he's not a prophet so brother Brown didn't have to put on pretend to know things he didn't know he said today they've got to know everything when you're going to have a toothache when you're going to have a tummy ache everything else tell you all about it he said that isn't the nature of our God he said watch the prophets watch Jesus in other words watch their life he talked about how Jesus only did what the father told him to do and how Paul uh was there and here he will disgrace prophet of God yet he only had one code and he wasn't going down there finding gold in the ground but yet Jesus found a coin when he needed it or told Peter where to find it but yet it wasn't something you just command but you do what God tells you to do he said now he said I do not believe there's anything that he's spoken all these years of my life I spoke to the people boy come to pass he said many people has come with dreams he's Let Me by his grace interpret for the people and he has come with dreams and with problems I was unable to interpret now think about this for a minute you think sometimes you have dreams that are strange or some dreams the prophet of God was unable to interpret I'm glad he was honest with us he said I was unable to interpret he said but I haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers I've tried to be honest and to tell you what was truth and I could only tell you if he told me and then as it come to me then I could tell you we got to be careful when we say thus saith the Lord we've got to be careful when we say the Lord told me a member of Pentecostal preacher Stan the pulpit and say I hear you Lord and you tell them take another offering it's always had to do with money therefore that when God speaks it needs to be something that's real people need to have confidence in US in our lives to be able to hear from us he said I haven't tried to introduce you to people at gimmick has all the answers I had to be honest and tell you the truth he said but I want to warn you he said in this day that we're living in there's many not saying anything against people when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word he said Jesus said there was many leopards in the Days of Elijah but only one was healed in the many years the 80 or more than Elijah lived one leper was healed many widows in the days of Elisha he was only sent to one we find out there's many things that God does he doesn't reveal to his servants and no servant is greater than his Lord he said and then God will not share his glory with nobody we need to stay humble don't we and we need to do that and he's talking about dreams he's talking about Visions but when we're spiritual we need to stay humble with that we need to stay humble with that I know that you do I'm not rebuking anybody tonight I I just want to warn Us in that way that we get we want the spirit of God to move huh we need to stay humble with that we need to make sure we recognize where we're at who we are we're Servants of God when a servant becomes a place he tries to take the place of God then God takes his life and moves him away somewhere or something he said we must remember that he said now on those visions and interpretations I cannot tell now listen I cannot tell the interpretation of a dream until I see exactly my vision what the dream was but some people always know the answer to your dream the prophet didn't right and and so the uh for me I can tell you what I think it means but if you come and ask me the interpretation of a dream I really can't tell you what it means unless I see it right and then I can tell you I don't have that gift at least I've never done that right so that's and maybe you can do that but I'd have to see it to know what it was because how could you know I knew the interpretation unless I had also could tell you what the dream was right that's what the Bible says he said now he said I see exactly my vision what the dream was many of you know you've told me your dream would not even tell at all when I saw the dream come back to me I turned around and told you there's much of it left out and then tell you what you left out of it you know that's right he said then the things that you didn't tell me like Nebuchadnezzar said how can how you if you can't tell me what I dreamed then how would I know you got the interpretation of it but he said but all these Impressions we mustn't take them and say thus saith the Lord we mustn't do that we must have a direct voice an answer from God before we can say it's God and he said not an impression not a sensation no matter how much it's pulsating right you feel that pressure to to speak but you better be careful before you say thus saith the Lord he said you might say I believe it could be this way but when you speak thus saith the Lord it's not you he said watch on the platform have you ever seen it fail thus saith the Lord is perfect never has failed and as long as it is thus saith the Lord it can't fail oh I love that now and I'm closing here but just hang with me now Joseph's dream you remember Joseph's dream Joseph Mary's fiancee his dream went that he had the angel come and spoke to him in a dream directly it wasn't in any kind of a uh it wasn't in any kind of a symbol like many times we see dreams and symbols but and and well I've had dreams I I had a dream before my dad passed away that he was passing away before we knew anything was wrong with him he's a 50 something year old man it shook me up so much I called my mother to see if there's anything wrong a few weeks later we found out he had cancer incurable cancer and uh but God does that but I I couldn't have even interpreted my own dream it just it's just what it was it is what it was and but but that's a secondary method of speaking you know brother Branham taught us that when Joseph saw that dream he said it's because there was no prophet so there was a secondary method by dream of speaking to him and that's why it was so clear he couldn't have been in the symbol because there was no Prophet to interpret it I saw a secondary method dreams is a secondary method gifts are a secondary method think about it God does it God does it but the primary way that God speaks is by the word the word is the urum and thumb or as the the old hillbilly said to use them and thumb them the use them and thumb them you'll get it after a while that's the word the urm and thumb of the lights the flash the lights and testimonies the human thumb that that that's what gifts are judged by we don't judge the word by the gift we got this as a gift by the word oh my I want you to watch something brother Branham said this will kind of wrap it all up for what we've what we've talked about First Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect has come that which is in part should be done away with he says to all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things he said well that which is perfect and we do have today someone say today we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication this is not a secondary source or a secondary method we sell the word way short and I want to say this as we close this on gifts that we we sell the word way too short this is not a secondary method this is God's primary method of speaking to his children we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child a Spike as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things you say why can't we have what the Pentecostals had let that age die let's be the bride we don't want what the Pentecostals had we want what true Pentecost had we want the reality of it we want all of it we want the gifts yes but we want the word we want the person of Jesus Christ right in our midst he's here that's what the revelation of the son of man was that's what it was so sister brother Andrew Glover over over the weekends we were supporting him in a meeting and he was preaching about the revealing of the son of man that's what it was brother Brandon's Ministry was to tell us he is here he is here when I become a man I put away childish things that he is here in the flesh amen we have thus saith the Lord how many know that the book came open what does that mean Psalms 103 3 he tells us who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases we have a message called perfect faith the perfect interpretation of the word thus saith the Lord I hope you hear me now a perfect Faith reveals the book is open on that scripture Isaiah 26 3 that will keep you in perfect peace do you need peace today do you need the the your mind to quieten down do you need some things to begin to come right for you he said that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me because he trusted in thee listen to me I'm telling you thus saith the Lord go listen to a sermon called letting off the pressure yeah the Divine interpretation of the word with Divine vindication Hallelujah Romans 8 28 are you having a problem with things not working out in your life think about it for a minute where this isn't a secondary source this is a reality when's the last time you went and took advantage of it it's the opening of the book right we know that all things work together for good to them to love God to them were the called according to his purpose you want to know what that means go to Invisible Union of the Bride where he said you never did it in the first place thus saith the Lord I could say that with confidence right Jeremiah musicians go ahead and come Jeremiah 29 11. we could go all through the scripture he said for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end how many believe that today go listen to Future home just saith the Lord amen oh Hallelujah First Corinthians 15 51 what did I say when he got done with the gifts he starts moving them towards the rapture he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised Incorruptible we shall be changed go listen to The Rapture thus saith the Lord he said the message was a shout we're already in the process of the rapture I was at brother Aaron McGarry he's preaching earlier in the year and the thought just come to me I said you know we're not we're not we're in the process of it I said it's like you're at a theme park you're on the roller coaster and it's already started you can't get off now I'm so glad of that those who are supposed to be on or on we're already on the ride we're not getting off it's already rolling the shout's already taking place that's saith the Lord or if we could have the gifts offering tonight and I'll bless my heart to have many gifts operating in the service but don't you realize here's something even beyond the gifts that we have that is clear that we can see thus saith the Lord is here book is open the promise has been manifested I'll tell you it's not believe it and live believe it and live oh but brother Ben you don't know what I'm struggling with believe it and live thus saith the Lord we have it for our age amen let's bow our heads together I'm looking forward to that change time's about up here on this Earth glad I have thus saith the Lord I'm so glad I'm not I'm not still wondering I remember what the Holiness Church was like that my dad come out of and I can remember them struggling with whether it would be pre-millennial or post-millennial or whether it would come on a white cloud or a white horse whatever that it was they were always wondering what age they were living in some thought they were able to see and some thought they weren't any ages at all they just wondered and they they guessed at it but we're not living in the age of guessing we're living in the age of Revelation an eagle come in our day and that was not a man that's see Christ coming down and speaking through a man we now have the the perfect Revelation you might struggle with that he said brother Ben how can you say that it's perfect I'm not telling you that the man was perfect but when Moses said when Moses told the people he said take the lamb strike the little of the doorpost that was thus saith the Lord and the message was perfect Moses wasn't but the message was that's the age that we live in today we've been told thus saith the Lord there was a human being that gave it but that just hides God hiding behind skin just like he's hiding behind your skin today the the message is thus said the Lord let's walk in it the Sith the Lord I'm gonna have my children are coming home thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord I'm Healed thus saith the Lord I I've been forgiven thus saith the Lord I am at perfect peace today thus saith the Lord he's promised it to me I believe it amen Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come to you Lord at the end of this of this little serious oh God we believe that you're still the same Jehovah Jireh we believe every gift Lord is in the church today we believe that Lord we also believe in you that you are here Lord

age that we live in oh God we're so grateful for that Lord I pray Lord that you'd help us to stay with us saith alone Lord that you'd help us to walk in your word Lord that you'd help us to even those

message of the hour we can see what your Prophet said about it oh God it would mean so much to us to know that we had thus saith the Lord for what we believe what we're holding on to I pray you
