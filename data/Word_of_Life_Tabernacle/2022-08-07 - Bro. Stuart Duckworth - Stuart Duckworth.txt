able to just to speak your word lord we pray we love you we thank you in jesus name we pray amen amen you love the lord this evening amen this certainly appreciated our brother ben this morning the things that were said and amen just appreciated the word of the lord amen we've been out for a few weeks it seems like we after the meetings we got sick just like like some of y'all did with with covet and and then we went into vacation and it just seems like it's been a while since we've been here but we're happy to be back in the house of the lord amen amen we weren't just laying out we amen amen certainly the the meetings still have an effect on us you know and just certainly feeling the effect of that still and and when we just love the lord amen amen we'll turn into scripture i just want to speak speak on a subject from that time in matthew 4 and 12 we'll start reading there it says now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the seacoast and the borders of zebulun and nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulun in the land of nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw a great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time began jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand you can be seated and made the lord bless his word amen and just uh just a thought that we had just a few weeks ago even while we were ministering about having an experience and how important it is to to have an experience with god and we must have a we must have an experience but we must have a a word experience a true word experience and to be able to go from that experience and to say from that from that time i was changed i was made different i mean i've been made whole something happened to me right and to be able to go forth and and have the life of christ and and live that life and do the works of christ because jesus said the works that i do shall you do also right so the church has got to continue on it if that life is in us amen we're going to live that life we're going to live a life of the word and his works his that same ministry is going to continue on through his body through the church and we'll just pick up something that brother branham said here and from a sermon and from that time and this is where i got some of the inspiration for this but he says here he says hang on one second here one second here i think i hit a copy and paste there and so we're good now we're good to go okay he said you know as a human being we all think of things from a certain time such and such a thing taking place and from that time and now many times you you meet an old man or an old woman and they like to refer back to a time that something taken place and that they can distinctively mark it out and say it was at that time and he said now i suppose there's practically all of us here tonight could call to remember remembrance of certain things has taken place at a certain time and from that time something changed such and such thing it happened at that time and from that time on it was different and he said it's a good thing that we can and he said and some of those memories and things we can think of as worthy things that changed and then there's some things that's not so worthy of thinking of and i i truly believe that everything happens for a reason i mean good or bad everything happens for a reason and i think if we can just look if we if we just look at the negative amen you're not going to see the positive if you just look at the bad amen you're not going to see you can't see what god's trying to do and so we we must see the good and look for god in everything that happens in our lives the good or the bad god can reveal himself in those things and i believe as the scripture says that he's working all things for our good he's working amen all things for the good to them that love god those that are called those that are chosen i mean and things things take place to bring the world or god's people to the condition that it or they need to be god allows things to happen amen he will allow things to happen and that brings the change that he's wanting to see right amen good good or bad negative or positive you know there's things that happen there's just things that happen and god allows these things that he's trying to bring us to a condition he's trying to he'll bring a ministry with a certain spirit with a with a certain anointing amen at a certain time amen for for a specific reason and god does everything for a purpose amen he will allow things to happen he'll send a portion of his word for each age he will send a certain type of ministry to help the people of that age and then he'll send us a specific anointing to do and to accomplish what his word requires he'll bring that he'll bring that unction he will send his word amen an anointing upon a people amen to defeat the enemy of that time amen and i believe we're we're a predestinated people tonight amen if i preach a sermon without saying predestinated i i don't know if i ever have or not but i certainly believe in it tonight i believe that we're a predestinated people and no matter what comes or goes i believe that god is on our side and i believe that we're living right now in the most glorious moment in time amen you think of of the negative and we can think here recently the effect that that covet has had and how things are so different amen some some have lost loved ones and friends some some of you have even gotten very sick you got very sick from it and we're able to recover from that by god's grace amen but in just a short amount of time the entire world has changed i mean if you could if we could really go back we could see things that were worse you know and more people died but just the global effect that this has had is it affect it's affected everyone and we can look back and say you know as time would go on we could look back and say if time would terry we could say it from that time you know things changed things were different you know people that went to church you know they quit coming to church you know it didn't mean that much to them anymore and you know you know it it's just coming to a time amen where people are rejecting god's mercy and we see these conditions and these things that god allows to come on the earth and no doubt you know no doubt there's worse things that are going to come on the earth there's things laying back man has devised a man has created within himself that coveted would not even touch that it would wipe out over over half the population why why are you saying these things because they're real because that's the time that we live in that that's what we're facing now and brother brown said man has always destroyed himself right but it's got to come to that point and i'm not trying to scare anybody tonight but it's got to come to that point and it's come to a point where god where people have rejected god's word they have rejected god's mercy and when you do that you take on his judgment right and the process we see the process of corruption of this world has become so rapid you see things that have esca it has escalated so quickly remember we know this earth is going to pass away right the heavens are going to pass away amen they're going to melt with a fervent heat amen and there's a fire that's going to come and cleanse this earth from sin that's going to come and cleanse this earth from the filth and disease that is here amen there's coming a change this earth is going to receive an experience it's going to receive an experience of baptism of fire amen just like you and i received amen that come down that holy ghost as brother ben was talking about and then it come down and it cleansed it changes it burned that away in this whole world that we're living in our past amen all these things are going to pass away they will be no more amen and we will remember we will remember no more the former things of this life because they're going to completely dissolve that fire is so fervent it's going to dissolve these things but this earth is corrupt and that but that's the condition that we're in that's where we're at amen but what a glorious time it is for the predestination for the believer brother branham says here he said lord jesus the hours are growing late it may be even later than we're thinking and and we're happy to see this hour approaching he said it's the most glorious hour that the world has ever known for the believer but for the rejecter it's the most saddest time there could ever be there could you there couldn't find they couldn't find words in the alphabet letters amen to make words he said that could express the trouble and the sorrows that lay ahead and he said neither is there words neither is there words that can be formed from our alphabet amen we as preachers we can try our best but he said there's there's not words from our alphabet that can be formed to express the blessings that lay ahead for the believer and then i say tonight amen amen stand your ground amen in your time take the word take the anointing for the hour and press the battle amen press the battle tonight there's things laying ahead for us if we could just press through we can't even think of amen the judgment the negative is so bad but the blessing is so great that's coming amen peter said seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking amen and hasting under the coming of the day of god amen we're living under an expectation and then we're looking for that for that day to come right amen and if you're looking for something you're expecting something and then we can see it the world can feel it and when there's something that has to take place amen amen the atmosphere is being charged amen amen for many it's the feeling of judgment they don't know where to go they don't know where to turn amen but for you and i hey man that's it it's a charge it's an anointing it's a feeling that we're gonna leave this place that we're gonna be raptured up out of this place amen that's the atmosphere that we're living in the expectation that we're under that's what we're looking for yes sir amen we're under a raptor rapture expectation amen and we're being charged amen by the anointed word of the hour let's look at some things that when they happen the world could never be the same and as we read in the scripture jesus hearing that john was cast into prison departed into galilee and we look at john here john the baptist they would ask john are you the messiah that is to come and he told him i'm not but john's ministry was to identify who the messiah was and that he was here and isaiah said that he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the lord making straight his past and to turn him in his ministry was to turn the hearts of the people back to god and then turn their attention and make known to them amen what was happening and about to take place amen there hadn't been a true prophet in the land for hundreds of years but out of the wilderness he came amen amen he came amen with a ministry from the word and then he came out dressed in camel's skin eating eating locusts and wild honey amen with a big old straggly beard amen dressed in and camel skin and man he wasn't much to look at but he was god's prophet and many he was god's man he was god's man and god was bringing about a change he was bringing about a change in the earth a change for the people of that day and he would use an old scraggly prophet like that amen and he would preach amen repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen he would preach there's something coming there's someone and a change is coming so you better change your ways you better repent the kingdom is coming and then you better line up with the word and then there's a kingdom there's a power coming there's a dominion coming upon this circle someone coming and he was preparing the way he was making the way he was pointing the people to that because there was a change coming the earth the world would never be the same after this man's ministry amen there's someone coming that will produce this dominion that will produce this kingdom amen one that's going to have all power in heaven and in earth amen he won't just have a word he is the word amen he's he's not just a prophet he is the word and he's going to give this kingdom he's going to give this dominion to the people amen and he will reign in their hearts he will reign in their hearts and give them power over sin he'll give them the power over the over flesh the devil he'll give him power and dominion in this life he's going to reign in your heart there's a kingdom coming and that's what he pointed the people to yes oh my what a great prophet john was and there in the jordan river he baptized them that came amen and they came and they confessed their sins but in matthew 3 7 he says but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath that is to come and there was coming a wrath if you rejected him was to take on judgment amen he said bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance see they came to see what was going on amen they came to john's baptism but they did not partake in john's baptism amen they were not able to understand they were not able to understand that he was god's messenger for their day because he did not come in the way they thought he would they weren't able to understand he didn't come with the way they had in their mind that he should come just as jesus he didn't come the way they thought he would but that's how god does it he comes in simplicity it comes in the ways that that we as men and and in our minds we can't understand it but god does it anyway and he brings forth his word he brings forth an anointing and then he brings forth amen amen amen a word amen and someone that will bring the attention upon what god is doing amen and by rejecting him as their messenger they would miss the identification of the messiah that was his ministry was to identify that jesus who jesus was that he was here that the lamb of god was here that was his ministry amen he would go on to say in matthew 3 90 said and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham so they're the holy spirit on the prophet discerning their thoughts that they had abraham to their father amen think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father amen they were thinking we don't need to partake in this baptism we don't need a man we don't need to be preached to we've got it all figured out amen they were trying to tie themselves to what abraham done and his experience but they failed to see what god was doing in their day that they had to have their own experience that they had to come to the word right and then they missed their day they missed their day they missed what god was trying to offer to them amen and he laid the ax to the root of the tree he said if a tree doesn't bring forth fruit it is cut down and it is cast into fire amen and they cut themselves off to what was coming amen when god's crying out in his word to repent amen come and lay your life down amen come amen and lay your heart before him amen don't cut yourselves off amen but how blessed we are as a people amen to be able to have your eyes open to what god is doing amen we ought to be thankful amen that that god would show that god would reveal himself to us amen that we could we could be able to come to it and man that we could be able to accept it and receive it and let it change our lives amen he said he told him i baptized with water unto repentance but there is one coming mightier than i whose shoes i'm not worthy to unloose amen he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire he's going to bring a renewing something that will burn out that old nature that that old nature out of you will set your hearts of fire he said his pain is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and man he's going to come and clean he's going to come and separate the seed amen we're not to try to separate ourselves we let god do the separating amen and his fan is in his hand and that fan is a is a shovel if you look that word up it's a winnowing shovel and you've got to get in that that bend and you've got to violently hey man get down there and work that seed and work that chat to separate it amen and he will thoroughly purge you an eye man amen we won't be purged by judgment amen but we'll be purged by the word amen god will come and do the work he'll come and do the separating he'll show who's his amen he will bring his wheat up into the garner and the chaff will be burned with an unquenchable fire amen keep life within you amen because that's what god's coming back for he's bringing the seed up amen and that's that's what the that's what john the baptist was pointing the people too he was pointing the people to that one he he wasn't trying to build his own kingdom amen but he was pointing them to the one amen that was going to have an everlasting effect and then god amen he he had six months of ministry that's all he had amen but this ministry was going to be from everlasting to everlasting it was going to be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever see a prophet can come and a prophet can go amen but the god prophet the son of man amen he has no beginning he has no end he is the word from the beginning he is melchizedek hey man i got to get a drink of water i think that was a record for me without drinking any water [Music] sorry about that amen that's who he pointed the people to amen matthew 3 and 13. will go on here then jesus cometh jesus cometh from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him yes but john forbad him saying i need to be baptized to thee why and cometh out of me amen but jesus answered and said unto him suffer to be so now for thus to become with us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him [Music] brother brown said here he said in your life is is is your life worthy of the gospel said john said lord i have need to be baptized of thee why cometh out of me both them eyes met one another a prophet and his god amen could you see wouldn't i love to stand there and watch that see them stern deep set of eyes and john peel down and find them stern deep set of eyes of jesus second cousins to one another in the flesh but jesus said john suffered to be so now for it be who with us amen with a message of this hour it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness and john thought yes he's the sacrifice and the sacrifice must be washed but voice presented and he said come on and be baptized amen amen in other words it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness amen the word came to the prophet and then he understood amen in the word of the lord comes to the prophet amen and the word came to the prophet in the water amen and and just as the sacrificial lamb had to be washed so the lamb of god had to be washed and he had to go to calvary he had to die that his kingdom that this kingdom of heaven his life amen will be able to come back and you and i he had to come to the water he didn't come to be washed from his sins but because he was the sacrifice that's how you and i come we're coming to be cleansed we're coming to be washed but him the sacrifice he had to be clean according to the scriptures amen to fulfill who he was amen [Music] this is just what was on my heart so it was becoming to him to fulfill all righteousness amen and to become something or someone there has to be a change amen you have to come to that you're a change and you and you grow to be that and then it's becoming to us and then when jesus said it's becoming to us to fulfill the word he had to become that he had to step into that amen to further into what god wanted him to be to for who he was to be as god right he had to become that he had to be changed he had to grow into that he had you had you got to come into being and then we have to develop into what god has called us to be and it's a progression it's not a one-time deal right you got to go on from the baptism of the holy ghost you got to go on it's a progression it's behooving to us as is people to fulfill everything that god has said about us everything that a prophet spoke of what abroad should be it's behooving to us to move into that amen to what the church is supposed to be amen before the return of the coming of the lord jesus amen as as we have returned amen by the pure lot to the pure word amen we as a church have been prophesied that we would welcome back the lord jesus and in the power of pentecost and man we wouldn't welcome him back with an old dead church spirit amen but there would be life in the church amen there would be an atmosphere and we would be charged amen with that atmosphere of faith that we're ready to go we're looking for that day it's becoming to us to fulfill everything so just as jesus became the lamb of god that would take away the sin of the world as he obeyed the word he became that word amen and then the heavens were opened and as the scripture goes on and john saw the spirit of god descending upon him like a dove there identifying the messiah and there is a part of john's ministry he identified him as the lamb and a voice from heaven identified him and said this is my son in whom i am well pleased amen god met his son in the water and brother branham said that heaven and the earth embrace if you'll meet god in the water if you'll meet him in the water no matter how silly it seems if you meet him in the water god will come and give you that experience he will come and meet you in the water he will give you he will speak from heaven he will identify use it you as his son you as his daughter if you obey his word god will come down and identify himself with you amen heaven and earth embraced and from that time the world would never be the same never be the same right that ministry had began the devil couldn't do nothing to stop it the world couldn't do nothing to stop it and the things that were done if they be written the world could not contain the scrolls and the things that were written that were done right somebody give me some of their voice i'll take some of it come on thank you lord well john hear jesus coming into his ministry john would say i i must decrease that he can increase amen what a what a true prophet that was sitting there baptizing all those people he he had a great ministry but he laid it aside because he recognized he was on the scene that the word was here right he said i must decrease that he must increase john would be trained his whole life for only six months of preaching and jesus would say there's no greater prophet than john amen john never tried to build nothing but he prepared the way he simply done what he was supposed to do amen amen so that god's work could be done amen it's not about us church it's not about our ministry or what we want to try to do or what we want to try to portray it's about him that he could come that he could that i could decrease that i could decrease that he could increase that he that he could beat the more amen that we can make everything about him that he could have the preeminence amen and we've had a messenger in this age we've had a messenger in this age just pointing us back to the word he didn't bring us something different but he pointed us back to the word he pointed us back to the bleeding word he told us that we had to have an experience like they had on the day of pentecost he tried to point us back to what they were in the book of acts he tried to point us back to a true experience to bring us something that would hold us amen it wasn't man's idea if it was man's ideas we'd have left long ago amen but there's something holding us we've been pointed to the lamb of god that would take away to the the sin of the world we've been pointed back to the word it wasn't nothing new but he just come and restored restored us back brought us back to what was already there amen amen he pointed us his ministry that messenger he pointed us to a god to a jesus this is the same yesterday today and forever the theme of his campaign amen where was all those critics back then the prophets left the scene and they want to criticize they want to try to run it down and no doubt there's been there's been criticism all along there's been criticism from the beginning but they couldn't say nothing while he was here amen because he was god's vindicated prophet amen it wasn't him trying to be domineering over but that was god's chosen vessel amen but i say in this hour i say in this hour amen the prophets passed off the scene john that elijah ministries passed off the scene amen that christ could come and increase in the bride amen the weaker sin in this hour amen and be the bride of jesus christ and the age of laodicea that we could take the message that we could take the anointed word of the hour and defeat the enemy to shine forth a lot and just as jesus shined forth that light in his day when he would begin his ministry there's a lot in the bride in this hour and when she outshines everyone she's not trying to be nothing other than just what god's called her to be but i tell you amen you shine wherever you go oh yeah amen amen i want that same god among us i want the god of elijah in our midst i want that god here amen elijah's passed off the scene he's done his part he said what he's had to say amen but the god of elijah is still here the god amen of abraham isaac and jacob is still here amen jehovah jesus christ the same yesterday it's still here and we as a church amen we must prepare and make a way for the move of god in this place in our homes in our lives amen and then watch your world be changed amen let that atmosphere come in amen make it a make this a place where god's welcome make your home your life a place where god's welcome amen and watch that change watch the blessing amen go forth in a time of darkness and in a time of corruption watch the blessings flow forth amen the world can never be the same from that time it could never be the same it would have an effect for thousands of years until our day into our day so we look at the life and ministry of christ jesus said i come to do the will of my father and he only did that which the father showed him to do amen he had he had all power and all all heaven and earth in him but he obeyed the father he only did what the father showed him to he only did what the word showed him to do he only did that which pleased the father and the life of christ isn't doing what you and i want to do but it's eternal life it's living for others it's about fulfilling all the righteousness of the word amen amen amen we've got to lay aside amen we got to lay aside our feelings we've got to lay aside a man of any aspirations to become the word you've got to lay everything aside and that's what that lamb nature does that's why the that's why the dove could descend upon that land because he had given up his rights he'd given up his life because it was becoming to him to do whatever the father wanted him to do matthew 4 16. the people which sat in darkness saw a great light we read this earlier and to them which sat in the region in the shadow of death lot has sprung up when jesus went forth amen he brought light with him he was the light and he would bring those he would pass by those certain ones way and he would lift them up he would come by and he would call their name he would bring them out of darkness they were many times condemned people looked it down looked upon people amen but jesus come by and brought them forth out of the shadows of darkness out of the shadows of death many times amen that's what the ministry of jesus should be in the bride amen what should be bringers of light bringers of the word bringers of that life amen to help a people a dying generation amen he called the lost he healed the sick and then he healed the brokenhearted he's the god of redemption in this hour and then he's the god of second chances do you believe that he gave me more than one or two chances he gave me many chances but he only got to give you one to be to be to be just but he gives us chance after chance opportunity after opportunity because he's the god of of second chances god is is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to the knowledge right amen his patience is amen is long-suffering amen he can make a son or daughter of god out of someone no matter the darkness they're in amen and if you're his you'll come to this light amen he will pass by your way and you'll have to come to it if you're not part of his then you'll you'll just let it go on you'll just let it go on but when the light comes by the sheep when it comes by a predestinated seed brother said they'll catch it some of us it takes years for it to really get down in there and shine where it needs to be amen but if you're his you'll accept it you'll come to that lie brother branham says here he says but there's a place where a man can come to a time that will change him forever for eternal he said and he that will come to me i will in no wise cast out said jesus and a man can come to god and his whole eternal destination has changed a man can come can meet god and it can never be the same anymore and man you can't meet god and and ever remain the same person you was if you turn away from him you'll be the worst person that you ever were but if you receive them you've got eternal life and it'll raise you up at the last day i can remember as a young man experiencing his presence i was about 12 years old i was at church camp and i think it was probably saturday night or something like that you know they had that the prayer line many times and but i can remember just coming under such a conviction and such a repentance and just there sobbing and weeping i had never never felt his presence like that before and it was something that that i don't even think when i did get saved genuinely that i even felt that but it was such an experience that it and it held with me my entire life and i i would leave there and man i felt good man i i had what i needed and you know when i i i love that church camp down there i ain't got nothing bad to say about it so i'm not even trying to go that direction you understand there's an atmosphere that's created many times in those places that that we just sometimes don't have here and that's just the way it is amen but it's designed for young people it's designed amen to to bring them into that atmosphere right and so i can remember that and i can appreciate that experience as something that stuck with me my entire life but i would go from there and you know i was going to try to serve the lord but i began to get around influences i began to get around friends and they would try to they would they would try to influence me to do certain things and it all started where it all started was music it caught my attention and it began there and from music i began if and if you ever let let the world influence you on one little thing amen if you ever let that creep in amen amen you'll be that much more easily influenced to do the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and that's what happened in my life hey man it was one thing after another something i said i would never do and then you find yourself doing it because you're hanging around those spirits you're hanging around those influences hey man but there come a time i was so hardened in my heart i was so hard and i was in such a dark place in my life amen but god had to bring me to that he had to bring me to that spot amen but there was a predestinated moment in my life there was a predestinated time that will come in each and every son and daughter of god amen and when that time comes god will come down and you'll just surrender to him and he'll come down and he'll bring the change and it'll be something that'll hold you it'll be something that'll anchor deep down inside you and there ain't nobody that can talk you out of it because nobody talked you into it brother allen it's something that god done it's something that he done and nobody can take it away and you may want to quit you may want to give up but there's something anchored down within you and then your spirit may be backslidden you may be backslidden but amen but that spirit of god has sealed you to the day of your redemption and he will bring you back amen from that condition there's a holding power within the holy ghost amen and that's what we point the people back to john pointed them to what was coming there's a holy ghost there's one that can come and baptize with the holy ghost and fire and that's what we're pointing back to tonight if you got that experience that's what we're pointing our young people to that's what we're pointing the world to there's somebody that can change right when that when that happens you can say from that time from that time you can begin to preach the kingdom everybody's a preacher everybody's a preacher enoch preached of a rapture his life testified of a rapture joel said in the last days amen i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters will prophesy old men shall dream dreams young men shall see visions amen it's here for us in this last days he's here he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that amen hey man here's something that changed we'll bring it down to a halt here we'll shut her down here's something that was changed abraham brother broom said there was a time there was a man called abraham who come down to the chaldeans he dwelt in the city where he was just a good man amen he was just an ordinary man he was getting old in 75 and his wife was 65 and abraham one day when perhaps he was out in the field hunting or whatever he was doing picking berries or whatever his jaw might have been he met god and from that time he was changed and man he could call things that was not as though they were because he had met god and then he knew the very hour and the minute that he had met god something changed him a minute god told him you'll be the father of many nations and then there would become no there would be those that would refute and dispute and and try to discuss them brother branham said he said you're believing something wrong amen but every time every he said he got stronger all the time giving praise to god any time anything negative came about the promise he just got strong or giving praise to god because he knowed that god would keep the promise and he says when a man meets god it changes his makeup it gives him a super sense the natural man only has five senses but the believer when he meets god he gets something different and then it's a super sense that'll lift him up above the shadows it'll make him believe things that's impossible to come to pass and then he still believes that they'll come to pass because god said so when a man meets god something takes place moses he had been trained in all the wisdom of egypt learned how to fight he had all the degrees amen he knowed every letter he knowed everything amen he was so smart till he could teach the egyptian scholars he could teach them what they had taught him amen but a coward there he was running on the back of the desert amen there's herding sheep for a stranger hurting a sheep for a stranger but there come a time when god met him there in the burning bush and from that time on from that time moses was changed because he met god in a burning bush he met him face to face and he couldn't be the same anymore and brother brown says when a man or a woman i don't care how how many vows you make or how many pages you turn until you meet god you can't be changed but once you meet god you're changed forever and he said not only did it not only change moses it changed israel it changed egypt it changed the world at that time because one man because one man met god and he took him at his word amen that's how important an experience is that's how important it is to have an experience with god it'll change it it'll change the ones around you amen you won't get changed by them but you'll change them amen mary he said there was a little girl one time not over 18 years or maybe not that old amen she was on a road to a well that morning to get a bucket of water down to nazareth she was a nice little girl she believed she had faith but that morning she met god and god told her something and she believed it and god and it changed the whole course of her life for that woman and it makes her immortal her name was mary the mother of our lord jesus the little lady was just an ordinary girl but she met god and from that time on something happened certainly him and the world was never the same it could never be the same from that time when god met mary when mary met god saul changed to paul just a few more here okay you can run out if you need to saul of taurus is a murderer who held the code of murders that and witnessed and give witness to the death of stephen the martyr he had letters in his pockets to go down to the head councils of the churches and arrests the people that were making too much noise shouting praising god he was a man a great man on the side of the pharisees who was a pharisee of the pharisees but one day he was on his road to damascus and he met god a light shined around him and from that time on he was no longer saul of tarsus but he was paul the humble one that meek one because he met god and it changed him and then he met that lot he met that pillar of fire aiming the same pillar of fire that moses met struck down paul and the same pillar of fire that that that come in our day was the same pillar of fire that's been all the way through the same pillar fire that met a prophet that identified with him that's the same god that was in this hour and i'll throw this in there this message has changed the world it is the last message to ever go forth we will be held responsible for it the world if they've heard it if they come in contact with it they'll be held responsible in some way i'm not trying to condemn everybody or put somebody in hell or whatever but everybody will be held responsible for this day they live in amen really us more so than anybody else we will be held responsible for what god has sent in this hour the leper at the gate all the remedies in the medicine could not heal him petrified sores had gotten so great till his hands was beyond raising up anymore in his feet he could hardly dragged him his case was hopeless but he met god one day coming out of the gate he fell down and worshipped him he said if thou will thou can make me clean and he said i will be thou clean just a simple word from the master this is a simple word to bring light to bring those out of the shadows of death and corruption and to bring him into life i mean he he didn't have no more leprosy because he met god oh my there was a blind man sitting by the side of the road and he could not see the daylight from the dark there was nothing could help him one day someone come walking out of the city of jericho and when he met god and from that time he could see his sight come to him amen the sight of light broke into his eyes and he could see again because from that time when he met jesus he was a different man he had his side and when a person meets god something happens definitely i mean you stand this evening you love the lord amen i certainly enjoyed preaching the word tonight amen i love him don't you he's done so much for me hey man we got so much to thank him for i'm not gonna sing somebody can come up here brother ben we got so much to be happy about we got so much to be thankful for amen we're a blessed people amen to know what we know yes sir amen thank you lord amen let's sing that so much to thank him for if we could brother helen if you know it amen oh i've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for [Music] of what he's done [Music] oh can you raise your hands to him now [Music] oh good to me thank you lord and i think i think of what he's done and where he probably [Music] amen do you believe that tonight amen amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer as we go to the communion service maybe you'd like to be remembered tonight by a word of prayer you'd like to lift your hand and say i want to be remembered i've got some need in my body or or maybe while the communion is going on brother branham taught us there's healing in communion so we want to remember that and also maybe you've never met god like brother stewart talked about tonight wasn't that a wonderful message my maybe you've never met him like that you say i just want to meet him tonight well that raised hand would signify that he mean you want to meet him uh you want to have that experience in your life heavenly father pray for these hands that have been raised lord those with needs in their life and their bodies whatever it is lord we believe that you're a god who meets all of our needs and we thank you for that we pray god that you just come now in this communion part of the service lord that you bless that you help lord we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever we believe lord that you are here with us tonight and you're here to meet every one of these needs we pray you do it now as we go into the communion service me there be a blessing in it for each and every one of these people we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight amen we're going to turn to first corinthians chapter 11. first corinthians chapter 11 and verse 23. we'll read the communion of scripture and go right into it isn't god good to us i think my voice left with brother stewart so i gave him mine i'm not sure it said for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood that is you as often as you drink in remembrance of me after and for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord had a man examined himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen god bless you i'm going to switch microphones here if the brothers would come lord jesus i hold in my hands the bread lord which is a type of your broken body lord that was broken for us on calvary we're so thankful lord of that lord you broke your body so that ours could be whole we're thankful lord or those that have needs in their body would you just heal them or just as they eat of the bread in remembrance of you lord may they be healed not not by the bread lord but by their faith in your in your body that was broken and your blood that was spilt we pray in jesus name amen lord jesus for the wine oh god we know that the fruit of the vine gives joy gives stimulation of revelation or maybe there'd be someone here tonight that would be nor not have the joy of the lord in their life and maybe they're going through a hard time tonight i pray god that you'd help them or that you'd help them to be lifted up in joy and strength in their life oh god lord may you just as they partake of this lord and doing what what you called them to do by the word may they feel that joy not from the wine lord but from your spirit that brings joy in their life lord as they obey your word we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you could sing something while they come [Music] my [Music] salvation [Music] him because he first loved me and purchased [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] my salvation [Music] mercy re-road my [Music] my life [Music] oh i should have fallen my soul cast down burn mercy [Music] rewrote my life [Music] god's mercy

let's stand together one more time read the scripture for the foot washing service and the way that we do this is the men will stay here in the sanctuary and the brothers will direct you to the back the ladies will go on back into the foyer and uh and have their foot washing back there we do this because jesus told us to we want to stay just as close to the word as what we can amen brings humility to us love one for the other there's no big man no big eyes and little use or all wouldn't it i just can't get over that sermon tonight i thought my how what a wonderful word you know i don't take a certain man standing in the pulpit to be a we have a wonderful word a wonderful god and so there's no big eyes or little used we're all the same in in christ jesus so it's good to have all of you here with us if you want to partake with this is the foot washing service we'll be glad to have you when we're done we'll come back in here with allen and sister mary and brother joe will come back in here and we'll have just a little time of worship and then we'll let you go just as soon as we're done amen do you love the lord tonight i believe that's why you're here revelation or john rather chapter 13. yeah just be uh be careful when you leave the ladies will be back there for a little bit it usually takes them a little bit longer than it does us so you men when you're done you can either come back in the sanctuary or exit out one of these side doors amen god bless you tonight john chapter 13 and verse 1 before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which in the world he loved them into the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a base and began to wash the disciples feet and wipe them with the tower with he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord does thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter sayeth unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not no part with me simon peter saith in him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet it's clean every wet and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed her feet and had taken his garments was set down again he said unto them know ye what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you very verily i send you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them amen let's power heads once more heavenly father we're so thankful to have been in your presence tonight and lord to know that you're here with us pray lord as we enter this part of the service that we would continue to have that presence with us lord every step of the way or then we'll gather for just a moment of worship after we pray that your spirit would be here or if there's any needs among us that those needs will be met we pray in jesus name amen god bless you the men towards this way and the ladies back at the foyer brother peter if you could turn that music on

the way and but you know jesus coming he said i am the way amen and you know so it puts things in perspective you know he was he was a man who knew who he was amen and and you know that's that's just
