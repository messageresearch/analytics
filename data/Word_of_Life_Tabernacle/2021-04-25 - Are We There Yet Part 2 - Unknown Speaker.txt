and he is time confess that jesus christ is lord is here lord this morning amen our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for what you've done for us [Music] thank you for the freedom and the spirit that we have on wednesday night lord this another service lord we believe you can be as free this morning to do what you want to do as you were in that service we thank you for that i thank you lord that you give us exactly what we need when we need it lord it's not more not less but it's exactly what we need and we're thankful for that thankful for your blessings honestly every day that allows us to be and if it's christians in a world that is against that but we thank you for that every day i pray you would bless this service this morning i pray or that you move me out of the way and just speak to your congregation today lord if there's one that has a need that i wouldn't know about god but you would know i pray god that you'd meet that need this morning and that you'd come and in the way that only you can and lord and take care of it we pray thank you for all you do we ask it in jesus name amen amen do you love him this morning amen isn't god good thank the lord i know um we had a time on wednesday night and but i you know we can be just as free in the spirit this morning and i feel that same freedom here today and just let god do what god does don't ever hold back and say well what will people think about me no just worship the lord he he's worthy of all of our praise and so we're thankful for that today amen let's turn to joel chapter 2 verse 23 while you're turning there with me this morning i uh have been in touch with some people about brother brown and brother brown was our first pastor really and when i was very young and he was a has been a great example to me over the years and he's in the hospital today and and they've done just about everything they can do for him but we know that there's a great physician do you believe that today some of y'all can testify to that here's a great physician amen i believe we could all testify that and so brother brown's there and they've done all they can do and keeping him comfortable but we believe god can still move on his behalf so be praying especially for him and for the church he's been there for probably more than 50 years and and so a man that's been there that long means a lot to that church and that community and to me and my family as well so be praying for that church and i know god hears and answers prayer amen amen so um just be praying for that situation i may or may not be here wednesday night alan's going to preach i was going to have him preach anyway but i may or may not be there y'all pray for me i'm having a hard time even talking this morning i guess it's all that shouting we did on wednesday night but we uh i may or may not be here on wednesday on wednesday because i've got a funeral this week and they're having a hard time they were going to have it on tuesday but they're having a hard time getting the body back from colorado where the man passed away and i have to travel several hours to do the funeral so if i'm not here wednesday night that'll be why and be praying for that family as well unexpectedly lost a loved one let's go to joel chapter 2 and verse 23 it says be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god amen be glad and rejoice could we do that this morning be glad then you children of zion rejoice in the lord your god for if given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors should be full of wheat and the vat should overflow with wine and oil i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the palmer worm the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning as we said last sunday the central question for the believer today for the christian today is have we been restored we could put it this way it has god kept his word is the promise true and you know there's a time there's a season for the giving of promises and then there's a season for receiving the promise and and the promise being fulfilled there's a season of planting there's a season of reaping we're not living in a season of planting we're living in a season when god fulfills the promises that he's already made so it's not that he's making promises he's made promises and he fulfills them today amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever and so the god of the promise is the god who fulfills the promise and so i could say for me we have been restored by the message of malachi 4 god did what he promised he would do now you you know the greatest argument that you can make about is the scripture true i could argue about my interpretation of scripture versus your interpretation of scripture but it really wouldn't mean that much to you because you know my opinion is as good as yours yours is as good as mine but when god interprets his word by bringing it to pass that's something different are you with me this morning that's something entirely different it's not god just me taking it and saying well this is what it means but it's god fulfilling his word but when god does that many times it goes over the minds and the eyes of the wise and the prudent it's hid from them because he promised him that he would do that he promised us he said why doesn't everybody see the message why can't everybody see what god's doing why can't everybody somebody might sit in a service like that wednesday night not feel anything not not see anything say i don't these people are crazy but you see not everybody has that access that you have like brother andrew talked about to be able to know what god's doing not everybody can feel it and they may be good people but not everybody can know it but for us it can it's a fulfillment of god's word but the very fact that some don't was prophesied right that was prophesied there has to be those that don't in fact the majority would not because he said in such an hour as you think not that's when the son of man comes that's when the son of man is revealed and so we find all to the scripture this promise of restoration a promise that god would do what he said he would do and it's kind of like the children of israel when they were waiting there there was a time when god said i'll give you a land there'll be a land flowing with milk and honey they were down in egypt for 400 years but finally there come a time when that promise began to be fulfilled and when it began to be fulfilled joshua goes into the land and he can have confidence to take the land because this is the hour of fulfillment if you look at jesus for many many years they went without a prophet they went without a miracle they went without anything they didn't have a single visitation from god that we know of for 400 years amen until god said it's time right and when god says it's time that's it right it's time you might pray for somebody for years you might you might you might struggle you might try to get them to understand you might you might get down on your knees over and over again say god why why are they not done but hold on because when god says it's time it's time amen god said it was time and all of a sudden the word that was planted a virgin shall conceive become reality a virgin conceived now you say well if god did that then it would be absolutely provable by science no because no one knew but mary joseph even had to believe it right there's no you're never going to be able to scientifically get every word and everything just right where you're just going to be able to accept it joseph had to believe it he had to believe that the angel that come to him in a dream was telling him the truth he had to believe that mary's story was true amen amen and what does that tell us today it's a personal identification you know it but everybody else don't know it all they see is the effects of it so we can say have we been restored are we there yet have we passed have we come to these stages do we see the bark on the tree and the life in the tree do we see the the leaves on the tree do we see the fruit of the tree have we been restored by the message of malachi 4. amen now jesus gives a parable in luke chapter 18. you can go read the whole thing sometime but i'll just read the last three verses to save time but he gives a parable that i've used with you before but it's the parable of the unjust judge you remember this with a woman that comes and she petitions over and over again to an unjust judge and the unjust judge finally said okay she won't quit bothering me i'll let her have what she's asking for right and what she's asking for is a restoration she's requiring a restoration she's asking him over and over avenge me and that doesn't mean get revenge for me but what it means is my property was stolen i want it back so there's a squatter on my property and somebody they've taken and and i want it back and he he gave it to her even though she didn't really have any rights because the bible says she was a widow and that tells us that she wouldn't have inherited directly right and so she's a widow and i want you to think about that and and then we find out that if you go back but there's another widow in scripture you go back to ruth ruth did inherit how did she inherit by marrying boaz right so she was no longer a widow i preached a sermon on that one time no longer a widow she's no longer a widow she she once she's married she has full restoration oh that's the age we live in church but now here's this this widow woman crying out and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect so he uses the extreme example here's a widow woman with no rights and an unjust judge right with a woman with no rights an unjust judge and he says he even heard her prayer her cry for restoration how much more amen shall not god avenge his own elect amen which cry they and i they do have rights they do have a standing in court they do have a legal right to stand there and ask for their healing ask for their salvation ask for what what they need do you believe that this morning i've got a legal right to stand and do that i've got a legal right to to require god to ask god to give me what i have need of and he said he would do it i have a right understanding i'm no longer a widow i'm not just asking for that but it's been restored to me amen and it's come to the place where now you're his wife you've been married to christ the word you're not going out there petitioning like a widow to an unjust judge you're coming to god and picking up off the shelf what you have need of you're signing your name to the check it's yours amen it's not somebody else's it's not for another age it's mine it's been restored and so he says i tell you he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth shall he find faith on the earth now brother branham picks that up and reads that entire story and the anointed ones at the end time and he picks that up and he says this he said now that's the question that's the question here's what i wanted to get to he said in revelation 10 he said in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery god ought to be finished here is the question is if you follow in that line in this hour will it be finished will i find the faith and you ask this question will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original the word now i want to tell you this morning that malachi 4 being fulfilled is more than the pro the malachi 4 prophet elijah prophet coming all right there's more to malachi 4. what does the scripture say behold i send you elijah right elijah coming is part of that fulfillment but it says he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers so if it was elijah amen amen if he was there you know if i am at home my wife knows if i've been there because there's certain things i do if i'm there and even more so there's a much more stark contrast if i'm not at home or my wife's not at home for a while and we've rarely been separated as far as being away and her being away but just i believe once she was away for a few days and and with her being out of the house for a few days the house looks much different we'll just stop there but a lot of things don't get done right because i work and do whatever you know i've got my excuses but when my wife's not there it looks much different you can tell when she's been there how would you tell if elijah had been here right if elijah was in the room how would you tell us my wife's in the room the dishes get washed the clothes get picked up you understand right she does what a wife does she fills that office oh my and if i'm in a place certain things get done there's things that you care about that's why if you put a different ceo over a company you put a new boss in there's different things they'll care about a certain person comes in that person will do certain things amen you've all been if you've ever worked in a fast food restaurant or someplace where they have a boss and the boss leaves for a while everybody acts like they want to but if the boss is in the room things are different amen oh don't you realize how would we know that malachi 4 was fulfilled how would we know that elijah come because the hearts of individuals amen me and you but joe but isaac you and i the hearts of individuals said and it's not just the emotion of it but it's the whole package you understand we can have a service like we did wednesday night and we can live like we did thursday right why because amen not by any merit of our own but god fulfilled his promise hey man you say well i can point to many others that don't but if he did it in one person amen amen he's done it only one amen only one virgin had to conceive for god to keep his promise if it was just one but i believe it's many more than one but if he did it in one person it proves that he does it amen hallelujah so if he's been here what should the room look like well the faith should be restored the bark should be back on the tree that's the question of the hour if he's been here what should our services be like if he's been here what kind of a joy should we have in our hearts if if we've been restored what kind of a people want me to be walking every day what kind of a faith should we have if it's been restored hallelujah he's been here have the hearts of the children where the children been turned back to the pentecostal fathers are we there yet luke 4 and 20. it says that he closed the book and this is jesus when he read the scripture that spoke of how the blind would receive their sight and the poor would have the gospel preached to them and all these things he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and there's a parallel in brother branham's ministry to this and you all know in birth pains when brother branham preaches that and he comes and tells us later but says the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this day is this scripture fulfilled so in this day that this scripture was to be fulfilled he was to be a certain thing messiah when messiah would come and see that's what the woman at the well recognized when the priests didn't because she had representation in heaven in a place where they don't even though they they understood more about it a scholar listen if i become a greater scholar all the language i'd have it all right they understood it and got it all wrong they knew every little letter of it and got it all wrong but there was a little woman amen amen sitting by well she's sitting there she don't have anything going for her everything's gone wrong and he begins to tell her your name is amen you belong in a certain place you you've got five husbands the one you're living with now is not your husband very bad hey man what what what is it who did that she said i perceive you're a prophet and something inside of her that representation caught an idea or a thought and said well when messiah comes amen when messiah comes he's supposed to do these things and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled amen hallelujah this day this scripture is fulfilled i am he that speaketh unto you amen now brother branham brings it down and he preaches a sermon called this day this scripture is fulfilled he brings it down into this day he said but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son amen i got to look and we may not get through much of this today but i i feel good amen isn't it good to have the freedom of the spirit in our midst amen i got to looking at the at the funeral the other day for prince philip and his great the royals that were there how different they were how they carry themselves they don't just do what other people do because they feel the burden of that maybe in some cases they're worse than other people but in public you look at them and watch how they carry themselves and think we're the royal seed of abraham we're different than the world and it's not because listen none of those people did anything to make themselves royal they were born into the family very bad they couldn't do nothing about it they had nothing to do with it they just were born in the family when you're born in the family you're supposed to act like the family acts you know if you're in the royal family they even have a dress code they even tell you what you can wear what you can't wear what time when you where you can go and where you can't go you're at the service that you're bound to do certain things at certain times of the year that's why so many people have from the outside they have such a problem with it because they realize their whole life is controlled or but church don't you realize if you're the royal seed of abraham your life is not controlled by a preacher it's not controlled by a church but it's controlled by the holy spirit where everything you do everything you say why you're the royal seed of abraham you're a royal bride to a royal promised son he said as i spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed amen there's no natural royalty in this message it's a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raise up we can believe a prophet or not but this is what he said there is to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be the royal seat of the royal faith of abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days hallelujah and the time and the place is the promise that's given to her what promise the promise of the malachi 4 restoration right because brother branham goes on to say that the time and the place is a promise to her that's he said according to malachi 4 a scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again and there is to rise one on the scene in the power of elijah that will rise on the scene a wilderness man that will come out and will have a message that will run right straight back to the word again why because it's time for the bride to come out it's time for this royal seed hey man it's time for the and this is the promise the place the time of the place is a promise that's given to her what time in what place when elijah comes then it's her time amen you know john stood there and he said i'm here preparing away i'm a decrease so that he can increase if i'm here it means he's here amen if i'm here i have to introduce him hallelujah if i'm here it means he's here thank you lord jesus if i'm here it means he's here if the elijah malachi for prophet came it means he's here the bridegroom is here oh my now look and yes there'll be a corporal body there will be a coming of the lord but you understand he's here because he he was introduced to us he introduced us to christ by the word now look and brother brown said that's the hour that we're living in now the random goes on in that sermon and begins to talk about events from his own ministry and a prophet can do that i believe we can do that god said he would he would save you and you can point back to a time in your life you say this day this scripture is fulfilled god did that god promised that he would save you from your sins god promised he would heal you and many of you can point back to a time in your life and say i know that day this day this scripture is fulfilled right he promised he would do certain things and a prophet of god stood there and looked at his own ministry and said this day this scripture is fulfilled there are certain things that have taken place and it's been vindicated in other words the the vindication is the fulfillment of it god interpreting his word by bringing it to pass and he says this these promises that was made all these promises have been vindicated and fulfilled by the god of the promise look what he says he says look hanging in washington dc tonight the picture of the angel of the lord he goes through that and then he talks about that and then he talks about the tucson vision how he's supposed to go west and he picks it back up he said how many remembers that here way before it happened there's men sitting right here in this building tonight was standing right there when it happened he said and the seven seals of the hidden mysteries of the entire bible will be opened and fulfill revelation 10 that in the seventh angels message these things should come to pass he said wait a minute brother brother ben i've been taught that a certain thing parts of that there are certain things that weren't fulfilled what did the prophet of god say he said fulfill revelations 10 the seven feels the hidden mystery of the bible will be open this day this scripture is fulfilled amen hallelujah he said where are we at in this abrahamic age what a way to put it this is an age of faith this is an age as i said of the fulfilling of promises it's not an age and so many people don't get that they don't understand it so they're worried costly but brother branham tried so hard to get that fear away from people that scare away from people you don't have to worry you don't have to make it happen you don't have to to beg it to happen it's here you can rejoice more than any other day isn't that what the scripture said rejoice be glad because he's restored amen amen he's brought back the years of the palm hormone and the cankerworm and that great army all those denominational systems god has done it amen and it's you and i get to live in that we get to live in the fulfillment of that you know it's kind of hard to sell if you walk around dark and depressed and gloomy all the time i know we go through things i go through things but look we're still human but this day this scripture is fulfilled and there ought to be part of us amen that can rejoice even in the middle of the worst struggle of our lives even in the middle of everything turning against us everybody turning against us we can rejoice amen why because we know god is fulfilling his word this is an abrahamic age this is an age of faith a perfect faith where are we he said in this great time we're standing the great hour that we're living in listen he said all the visions has been fulfilled amen all the visions has been fulfilled he goes back and tells about brother junior jackson's dream and how that they took the crowbar and he said there was a a rock like a pyramid he took the crowbar and he popped off the top of it and he pointed down in there he said look on that you remember and some of them stood there he said but the ones that didn't remain they they fell off the wayside but there was some that stayed there and looked at what had been revealed and so that that was uh junior jackson's dream and he talked about that he said i stood there a little bit till the holy spirit revealed it he said i said the entire bible as much as has been revealed to man through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name all these things has been revealed hallelujah now and he goes back and he's thinking at the time because he's going back he said but there's secrets that's hit inside because the bible is still with seven seals i must go there to find it he said that morning when those seven angels come down and blasted the earth and rocks flew every way seven angels stood there and said return back to jeffersonville from where you come from the seven seals of the seven mysteries will be open and he said here we are today he said brother ben can you get excited about god doing that so many years ago yes i still get excited about what god did when he kept his promise to abraham hallelujah when that baby was born to a 90 year old woman i still get excited about what god did amen when he opened up the red sea i still get excited about what god did when he brought a baby to bethlehem and i still get excited about what god did in tucson what god did in jeffersonville but let me tell you what makes me more excited today let me tell you what makes me more excited is to see god fulfilling his word right now in 2021 god is still fulfilling his word we can say this day this scripture is being fulfilled hallelujah why because that royal seed had to come that that pride had had to come someone's heart had to be turned back and when you begin to see hearts being turned you can say the message still works amen elijah's still doing what he came to do the message of elijah you understand amen amen you know that's why we don't mess with it but the brandon talked about that in the sermon why i believe he talked about how we don't mess with the formula you know if there's a formula that peter gave on the day of pentecost said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost had anything to that take anything away from it is death but it was just the right thing that's what god prescribed for the human race for the gentiles to be saved god prescribed that we don't want to mess with the formula that turns the hearts of the children back to the fathers right we don't want to mess with that god prescribed it we don't want to mess with this to me to mess with it but to give it out i'm a pharmacist you put it that way at the doctor amen the messenger to the age already said i had already spoke what was going to be said i'm a pharmacist all i do is look at a prescription and i find out what it says and i feel it amen and i've been specially trained i didn't go to bible school but i've been specially trained by the holy spirit to make sure that those instructions are followed amen you'd hate to have to sit there at home and and do all that by yourself but you get somebody who's specially trained and devoted to that that's what he does he goes in and he makes sure that the pharmacy gets it just right and the pill comes out just the way it's supposed to be and that's my job not to recreate a prescription but to be a pharmacist fill the prescription fill the prescription when you need healing amen fill the prescription when you need salvation fill the prescription when you need joy in your life feel the prescription i don't i can't make the medicine all i can do is fill the prescription amen but i got confidence amen because the longer i do it the more i see that when people in obedience take the prescription the way it's supposed to be taken it works and the people that tell me it don't work is the people that's never tried it people tell me that message don't work i was in the message but you never took the pill you never took the pill you never become the message you never let it become part of you you never did surrender yourself to it amen and every person that i've ever seen surrender their life surrender their home surrender their family to the message of the hour to the pill that we've been given every person that i've seen surrender themselves to that their life changes their family changes their their their whole being changes yes they're a human being yes they're just a flesh body but there's something on the inside that goes far beyond that amen hey man how could we get back it's like a junkie you know they say that some of these junkies i've never taken drugs but they say that once you take one you want to find something better find something better find something better finally you find the ultimate and then it kills you it's the overdose but they're constantly looking for that that better hit that better they're addicted to that and it's hard they won't turn around from that how would i ever turn around from what i've received from god he keeps giving it to me giving it to me give it to every time it's greater it's greater it's greater yes i have struggles yes my family's been through it there have been times i didn't obey there have been times i didn't do it right but he keeps giving and he keeps giving it every time i go to church and hear the prescription something begins to happen in my heart something begins to take place inside of me and it begins to become real oh man i'm walking around like a junkie i want more of it i gotta have more of it i gotta be in those kind of services i gotta have that kind of word i gotta listen to the message of the hour why it's me amen take it until those things seem more real than the things of this world hallelujah amen you believe he's still here today brother branham i'm telling you church you never know when the prescription might be handed out that you need might come on wednesday night might be on a sunday morning you never know when the prescription might be handed out that you need you know what and and god just gives us what we have need of and i was sitting there wednesday night i'm thinking i haven't ever in a meeting anywhere and there's just maybe 40 of us sitting here but probably less than 50 but in that service i've never felt the presence of god more than i felt right there never and i said god i believe there's some more maybe this morning just right in here as brother david said even in the quietness of the service you can sit here and just receive something from god there's more if i've ever had it i can't get that hit of it i want more there's a whole world opening up to me are you here are you with me this morning a whole world opening up to me there's more of the word there's more for me to receive notice brother branham said here we are today hallelujah understanding serpent seed he said in a few days if god willing will understand the correctness of marriage and divorce amen and all these things that god has opened every seal amen the mystery since the foundation of the world and where are we at and we've been in joy amen the presence of his blessings why god is fulfilling his word amen that is true he said this day this scripture we're doing all right let's move on now the message is so good we could stop right there in that we've had church but look at this brother branham talks about the bark or doctrine coming back on the tree so that was all the prelude my 45 minute starts now oh we won't do that but brother branham talks about that bart coming back on the tree right so that would be the the second thing that you would see the life would come in the life you only the only way you can tell that the life is in the trees by what happens on the outside right that's the only way you can tell everyone said don't judge me but that's the only way you can tell right it's because it exhibits itself but it's not just in long hair long dresses but it's in a life right and and so that life is on the inside and so there's a bark that begins to be restored and the bark is the protection or the doctrine coming back on the tree and we find that early church was not a bunch of charismatics and i don't say that against them but it's just they'll tell you they have no certain doctrine and there's nothing really that we believe one might be a somebody who who runs after this doctrine another one might run after that doctrine but they all come together and they all worship together and they all just have a wonderful time but there there might be a a woman preacher and a person standing up in shorts and people running all over the church and there's no church order no no changed life it's basically given up on the ideas god loves you like you are and i've heard this even from lately from christian musicians i was listening to a christian musician because i loved music and but they were talking about how that god loves you no matter what and i believe that i believe god loves you but he has a special love for his elect but they also talked about how that no matter you just you know life the way they present it was life is just you're human so you're going to do things so you just do them and then god loves you anyway and just when you realize that that's when you reach your nirvana when you just realize that god loves you no matter what you do right well god hates sin right he does love you but if you do certain things he's going to do what it takes to make you stop even the natural world tells us that look at the aids epi pandemic and all these things that have come on you want to go around do those things go ahead but there's coming a day there will be a payment there's coming a payday one day for those things and that's what you hate for you're not you stand here warning people don't go that way don't go that way don't go that way you tell people we don't believe in divorce why because we don't want to see we don't want to we i've seen the effects of it i know what it brings so don't go that way but you can tell people that over and over and over again and they go that way but it's not because you just want to control their life it's because you want you don't want to see them suffer that because god still keeps his word and if you do things that are against the word of god there will come a payday there is always a payday there will be a payday i don't know why i'm getting off on that this morning but you understand they'd say well just the love of god the love of god but but that wasn't the early church at all the early church believed in the love of god because that love had the power not just to leave you where you are in your sins but to change you hey man hey man paul could say some of you were adults or some of you were effeminate were or homosexual or whatever that it was but he said such were some of you amen but you've been washed but you've been cleaned amen hallelujah amen and so so we we realized that it has to change you and that's where the early church was in acts 2 42 it says they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship those that were saved on the day of pentecost didn't just go back to their regular lifestyle but they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in breaking of bread and in prayers see we have to have a day of pentecost we've got to have that moving of the spirit among us but we've got to have that continuing as well right we continue steadfastly in that if you receive something from god keep going in that don't stop you say well i got something from god i'm okay that's a dangerous place because right after a victory is where satan will always attack you right immediately after you begin to you feel that presence of god that blessing on your life satan will attack you right there immediately he'll try to tear you down try to make you think it wasn't real there was nothing to it why because he wants to destroy that in you he wants to destroy his hair and try to destroy the children why he didn't want him growing up to be the messiah right that's why he's trying to destroy you when you get something something's born in you you begin to feel the spirit of god move in your life and then all of a sudden satan tries to destroy why he don't want that to become a messiah so they continued that and that doctrine would be the foundation for everything we believe today the foundation for it yes it's been built on but it's built on that foundation the foundation of acts 2. now look brother brown said it was more than a scaffold work right the book of acts was the manifestation of what god wanted to do in a church right it's more than just a well it's a good time but it was limited to one time no it's the way a church should operate all right and and we have that plus the understanding of those things that were revealed at the end time now look uh ephesians 2 19 tells us now therefore you're no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens of the household of god you know you expect a foreigner to act like a foreigner but if you become a fellow citizen there are certain rights and responsibilities that you have right or different than what you did have you now fellow citizens with the saints of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone and paul takes that even a step farther and says this he said though we if i came back or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed stay on the foundation why because that is the bark or the protection on the tree right and brother branham even says that the worm got into the life so it could kill the bark once it got through the doctrine if he strips away the doctrine he has free access to the life and he will kill the life that's right and that's why doctrine is important what we believe matters but when i say doctrine i don't want you to get confused i don't want you to think well doctrine you know baptizing jesus name yes that is doctrine but it's more than that it's what you believe what do you believe about god what do you believe you are right it matters that you believe you're the elect of god it matters that you believe that god keeps his word right that's doctrine it matters that you believe that that these things are true if you don't believe it if you're not sure then you're on an unstable foundation you can fall over at any time it matters what you believe look brother branham said this he said as long as the word and said it would be here would operate this certain way stay right with it right if the word said that the church would be here and he's talking i think there about his own ministry if the word said it would be here that gift would be here and operate a certain way that's what you should believe right stay right with it but now if the church let's take that same principle right the word said it would be here would operate a certain way stay right with it right don't never get off no matter what anybody does how real it seems to be amen he said if it doesn't reflect in the scriptures from genesis to revelation leave it alone don't take no chances amen we're in the last days when satan is just as deceiving as he can be and brother brahma says this i love this next parrot couple of paragraphs because he said forgive me if i try to take the place of a boss i'm no boss but i feel to you like paul said back there about his congregation once you're the stars in my crown when i cross over the land over on the other side yonder and meet you in that glorified condition i want you to stand there to shine like the stars of my crown see i want you to be there i want i want to be there and i want you to be there see the thing about a preacher you have to believe in it strong enough that you want others to be there and you want to be there with them right and you believe in it strong so strongly that you believe you'll be there you want them to be there and so you tell them the truth because a lie won't get you there he said and i remember in my vision when i seen the presence of the lord or his people in that glorious land yonder i looked around i told them he said and they told me he would judge me first by the gospel that i preach and i said just exactly the way paul preached it amen and then millions of people screamed out amen we're resting on that hallelujah he said now i want it to be so and we are going to meet there someday and if we're going to meet there we want to know that we stood on what paul said we stood on the truth are we there yet now doctrinally now think about this the word is back right you're gonna have a hard time convincing me differently from that brother brother ben you haven't heard what so-and-so said the word is back why because i know it's not an opinion because it works right the word is back life is in the grain brother brown says we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication so he's talking about resting in in all these other things we don't have to rest in emotion we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication and that brings joy to us see that's the difference so we're not a bunch of charismatics running around going around and speaking in tongues and doing all kinds of things and running around living any way we want to no we know what we believe and that's why a man of god can stand up here and preach in the pulpit and while he's preaching the power of god can fall in the congregation right it's not about your work not about your music but god moves why does god do that because we have today hallelujah the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication the life is in the grain amen the bark is on the bride tree but now bring it down to an individual level is it been restored to my life is what i believe does it match what the bible says what the word the revealed word says in our hour do i imagine or am i still fighting part of it right well i believe that but you know he really didn't want us to do that whether it's dress or actions or some other way we just fight a part of it we try to live just as close as we can to the line lord know i want all of what you have for me i want that bark that covering that doctrine to protect the life now look brother said this little cankerworm began to bore himself into the bark what did he do he began to take its religion it's covering its doctrine away from it he said religion is a doctrine a doctrine that covers anything he said that's the reason our religion is by blood the blood the life is in the blood that covers the word and the life it's in the blood the blood is religion the life and the blood is what brings the results he said do you see it he said it's not covered by fig leaves adam and eve tried that one time cain did the same thing did you notice that cain brought some of the botany life too but it wouldn't work it didn't work with adam and eve it won't work today when god refused it at the beginning it's refused for eternity handmade creeds and thoughts will never take it it's god's word has to do it and the word is by blood the sacrifice of sacrifice of christ now listen here's a question are we there yet do we have a man-made religion or are we covered by the blood and a good way to know that is did we make up what we believe because if you invented it you got to stand behind it but i'm so glad that this word was invented by god he gets to interpret it how he wants to do we have a man-made religion or are we covered by the blood now look brother branham goes into an explanation here in in the restoration of the bride tree and i felt this was needful and i don't know how far we'll get into it and i'll just cut it off when we reach time we got a few more minutes can i have five more minutes now brother wendell i won't do that but the window martin would take five minutes from each hand that goes up but we won't do that but it may be a little more than five minutes so he said it's god's word has to do it and the word by the blood and brother branham says thank you for changing that god never left anything for relics and tokens he sent the holy ghost something alive he didn't preserve the temples have you ever noticed that the temples were there when the shekinah was there but when the shekinah left the temple the temple was destroyed god never left anything for relics and tokens and you can make anything a relic or token by the way it can be a preacher it can be it can be a it could be a picture it could be a piano it could be a car it could be the way you do things listen we're going to take communion next week i believe in taking communion i like doing it on a regular basis but if it becomes a relic and a token to you personally now that is a you problem right that's not the church's problem if you if you begin to worship communion that's your problem right but if it's a relic if you if you trust in that for your salvation you're in trouble well i take communion i go to church i listen to brother ben or i listen to whatever other messengers out there whatever other preacher is out there i listen to them well if that's a relic or a token that's that's not alive you understand there's got to be something that's alive that cannot be destroyed and let me tell you at some point if the lord terry's i won't be here anymore now i hope that's 50 years from now if the lord tarries that long i hope we're not here that long but if we are i hope it's 50 years from now but there will come a time i don't stand behind this pulpit and it could be tomorrow we don't know that you understand i'm not trying to scare you there's no guarantee no guarantee god don't leave anything for relics and tokens huh you lift me up too far god will take me out of the way and move somebody else in god never left anything for relics and tokens he won't do it he sent the holy ghost something that can't be killed something that cannot be destroyed but the verb said what would a nail do me any good what would the original cross he hung on what would it do me any good not a bit not to know the nail no the cross but to know him as life now we're holding on nails we're holding on to relics we're holding on places today people walk up and down in the city of jerusalem and all up and down and then different places holding the relic things that ain't got nothing to do with it another thing the thing is condemned rotten and going on so you've got to have new manna you can't make wednesday night a relic right that's in the past the poet said this is the only living time right now this is it you don't get to memorialize the past and make that all that you live for no it's right now yes you can learn from it yes you can remember it yes you can give honor to it but you don't god don't leave us nothing for relics and tokens but branham says i went to a church in rome and all these priests that died plant them in a garden and let the meat fall off the bones then they take the bones out make light fixtures put their skulls around people come in there rub them skulls to get blessings till the skulls are white and wore out he said you go into st peter's cathedral foot of peter they claim their statue has been kissed off nine or ten different times they have to mold another foot on it he said such nonsense superstitions that's all it is creeds of man-made doctrine if you can't worship god because your relic isn't there that's a problem if you can't worship god because your favorite preacher isn't there that's a problem whatever the relic is superstition it's all creeds of man-made doctrine hey man i'm not looking for a certain relic listen if i was looking for a church today i'm not looking for a certain relic for some place where i could go to church and take my family i'm not looking for a certain reality what am i looking for a living word a present truth it's the word that's preached able to change my life that's what i'm looking for not idols but living idols people that have been changed by the word that's what we look for where i want to go where the truth is preach where the spirit is free to move amen i've told you alone for that where we have no agenda no certain thing but just where the spirit of god is able to move back and forth through the congregation nothing that i don't have to i don't have to have this pulpit i don't have to have these chairs i don't have to have this building but i have to have the word amen i must have the word and if i have the word god can do what he did wednesday night he can do what he's doing this morning he can do what he's doing in our church amen and in churches around the country not just this one god can do what he's doing there can be revival because the word for our day is here the spirit is free from to move the word from my day can be manifested brother master this little fellow started destroying destroying what the cake worm got out of the bark watch what it did begin to destroy the bark what did it do he said it made a natural church for a spiritual church watch it took away the true and gave it a false he said the fruit the pome worm heat the leaf the locust seed now the bark the covering the religion the doctrine the cankerworm god where did the first doctrine come from outside the bible he said historians know where it comes from from rome exactly where it started and there they started accepting dogmas i want to look at this and then we'll speed right on to the end now look what is a dogma a dogma is a settled opinion a principle a maximum a 10 a doctrinal notion right that's dogma and this by the way is from webster's 1828 dictionary which i love i love the way he puts it he takes it from a biblical perspective because that was just the day he lived in that's a dogma the dogmas of the church the dogma is a plato it could be anybody can have a dogma right the other word you hear with that is creed what's a creed a creed is a summary of the articles of christian faith or it's that which is believed a dogma a settled opinion you know an opinion is still an opinion even if a lot of people believe it or we say a lot of people have it still an opinion right just because a lot of people hear a story doesn't make the story true that which is believed it's just what we believe a creed but now look at that we don't live by creeds and dogmas what do we live by revelation let's look at revelation revelation is the act of disclosing or discovering to others creed comes from here dogma comes from here you understand but revelation comes from him right it's not me settling on an opinion about scripture but it's god saying what he did and why he did it amen the act of disclosing or discovering to others what was before unknown to them appropriately the disclosure or communication of truth to men by god himself or by his authorized agents hallelujah the prophets and the apostles the church nominal settles for dogmas and creeds we want revelation now look it's got to be on a foundation of the apostles and prophets so whatever revelation we get from god we'll check out with the word it always will because it has to be now revelation 17 8 speaks of a bottomless pit and i won't read it to save time but it talks about the beast coming out of a bottomless pit brother branham says this he said he said it's the catholic catholic doctrine he said not on the bible he said out of a bunch of superstitions that was made up now again has the mark been restored and i want you to ask yourself this question before we close today is what i believe did it come out of my own head did i make it up or is it revelation from god and it's about anything it's not just about everything the way i worship the way i talk the way i interact with my brothers and sisters is it the way i am what i've settled on a dogma a creed or is it revelation he says it was made up of a bunch of out of a bunch of superstitions he lists some of these different doctrines where do you get that app there's no place nowhere to find it brother brown said it come out of hell the bible said so it come out of the beast the power the doctrine that it had come out of the bottomless pit the bottomless pit what is it brother branham in another sermon he said what is it the bottomless pit there's no foundation for a catholic doctrine there's no bible for catholic doctrine there's no such thing as any bible for any catholic doctrine not at all why it's a and they'll tell you they don't hide that fact like we protestants many times try to but the catholic don't hide that because they say though the church has the power to change it right now this bark eating locust takes away something and replaces it with something else from the bottomless pit so brother brother said that cake worm got to eating and eat away the bat first the baptism of water in the name of jesus christ secondly it got to eat in the baptism of the holy ghost i want to cow down as i said on this for a little while actually brother says cabbage down by the way not cow down my son corrected me on that the other day he went back and looking for brother bran was saying that and that's not what he said he said cabbage down so i'm sorry i misquoted a prophet but i did it in ignorance but i want to cabbage down on this for a minute because the cankworm takes away the baptism of the holy ghost he said because as long as you're going to have that holy ghost it's going to shed light on that word you realize what satan don't want you to have a service like we did wednesday night he don't want you to feel the presence of god in the service he don't want you to have the holy spirit in your life because that holy spirit sheds light on the word right so he said the this this worm ate away at the bark and he was eating away at the holy ghost he was trying to kill the baptism of the holy ghost he said now he said that's what the cankerworm did he said it took away the spirit and give them a piece of bread a bread that some priests made or some nun or something that's what they did that's exactly right he said go ask now go looking back in history and see if it isn't right you let that thing be shoved down your throat not only them catholics but you protestants they said many of you same thing he said the protestant instead of having the holy ghost you know what they do they come and join and shake a hand it wasn't somebody come up the road and shook a hand on the day of pentecost come but there come from heaven the sound of a rushing mighty wind you talk about revelation it wasn't a dogma or creed but it come from heaven it filled all the house where they were sitting that's right he said come down through them leaves on trees poured over the bark he said now instead of the new birth that jesus said a man must be born again they adopted joining their church come and join instead of the word the cankerworm give them a creed don't you see he said look what he's doing he's giving a natural for a spiritual can you see it can we see it this morning brother brown asked a question he said where do we have the holy ghost demonstrations in protestant churches today where do we have a pentecostal reaction in amongst protestants you say oh in the pentecostal church i beg to differ you have a lot of noise but where do we have a pentecostal reaction a pentecostal reaction would be like it was then yes and it does involve some people acting like they were drunk by the way if you've never been drunk in the spirit i highly recommend it you're worried depressed down on yourself mad at somebody get drunk on the spirit it's good stuff pretty bad i'm told that these guys are like wine you know they go and find the best stuff they can find the best vintage and they try to show it to people and say this is the best stuff and they become almost evangelist for it this is the stuff that i drink i'll tell you what i found some good stuff i found some stuff that'll make you so drunk that revelation will come down on you i found some stuff that'll make you drunk and it'll make you feel like that that you can jump through it run through a troop and jump over a wall it'll make you feel like you can do it amen you can make it why because god reveals it to you amen in that spirit with that quickening power brother branham says he says where do you have a pentecostal reaction he said i want to go over there and just eat and have a wonderful time if they're having it i want to go over there and find it he said but see you've adopted something natural he said i'm fixing to leave and you know that he said don't you never let this get out of your heart don't take the natural that's death this natural man is death anything it does is death it's subjected here for death it's the spirit that maketh the life the spirit that gives life and quickens it it's a spirit i'm going to skip through this next one and i apologize to sister joanna but i want to come down and brother branham talks about purgatory i'm going to skip way down so if you can find me otherwise we're closing in a moment anyway brandon talks about purgatory and then he talks about he said purgatory is unauthoritative word and that's he said it's no more than any other life it's contrary to god's word it's a lie brahma said i don't believe unauthoritative words this is that paragraph 293 he said how would we say oh they say this that and the other but anything that's unauthoritative don't believe it it won't do anything for you but they say it's true is it authoritative what makes it authoritative authoritative it's on the foundation he goes on to talk about the people who are baptized in jesus name if the angel said so now watch this because a lot of us if listen if we believe in brother brown was strong enough but why do you believe in brother branham because he stayed with the word he fulfilled his mission of staying with the word he was vindicated but he stayed with the word we don't have to question that go back and dig through and find out he say with the word because he did i've never found him straying from the word and if he would even in his human being he would get off maybe say something wrong the holy spirit would correct him on that we've seen that over and over god sent us a vindicated prophet with a message we can believe in right but we don't believe in unauthoritative words we if an angel brother branham talks about how all those ministers told him that if the angel the lord told you about baptism in jesus name we would believe it i wonder how many of us if if somebody come and said the angel the lord said that a certain thing was true we believe in that angel the lord huh but it's got to match up with the scripture and brother branham we read that now ago he said the angel lord never did say anything that wasn't true right so that but the angel lord didn't tell him about baptism in jesus name huh and they said if the angel of the lord had told you we would believe it but it's brother branham calls that unauthoritative words go look it up it's the angel of the lord and brother branham said that they didn't believe it because it wasn't the angel of the lord he follows up this unauthority of words with that they didn't believe it because it wasn't the angel of the lord that said it but brother brown said this is the apostolic doctrine this is the bible this is the holy spirit amen every word in it is true you just believe it and accept it he said and don't take down on it in other words don't don't weaken it by theory are you with me now we can do that to the message too if we're not careful we can we can theorize it until we weaken it down no believe what it says don't weaken it by theory don't water it down don't take down on it he said and watch every promise amen do we still believe he does that today watch every promise amen be fulfilled the manifestation of god present right now do you believe that today musicians go ahead and come are we there yet we have a vindicated message but ourselves i want us to think about that do we hold the doctrines of convenience or dogmas and creeds because we were raised a certain way or we come up with i was talking i had a great conversation after that we couldn't go to sleep but andrew and i i'm telling you we left here wednesday night went back there and worshipped and that's why we didn't come out for a while because we're sitting back there praying and worshiping because of what god did it may not mean a whole lot to some people but it means a lot to me god is able to move in our midst just he may not move that way in every service but we want him to be free we want him to be free we want him to be able to take me in and just change what i'm going to preach not you know a lot of people in pentecost a free service was not having any preaching but to me a free service is when god takes the word and anoints it and puts it right exactly where it's supposed to be but we set up till about two o'clock that morning over here at the fellowship hall we set up and talked about what the goodness of god and the things of god we got to talking about things we've been through and how he come up a certain way and that's been him a certain way and he preaches a certain way and i come up a different way and so it kind of would bent a different way but yet god i believe he uses both of us now i i hardly put myself in the conversation of that as a preacher but god uses both of us somehow he uses both of us he uses each one of you but you come up a certain way but god allowed you to come up that way but what you've got to watch is make sure that what you believe isn't just a a bunch of things that you've learned put together it isn't just your own biases and things you've been around people you've been around places you've been and you've soaked that in and you become that that's not what we want we don't want to abide in whatever we were but we want to abide in the vine abide in the word let our what we believe become the word become true because it's true not because we believe it not because it's a dogma or a creed or the church teaches it but because it's the truth of god amen and i will tell you this morning if you will stay with the word do we believe that today the promises will be fulfilled in you if you can be like martin luther when he stood there one day and said here i stand i can do no other how could he stand there like that because he had the the unction of the hour was on him and the unction of this hour is to stand there and say here i stand with the message of the hour i can do no other amen and when you do the fulfillment of the promises will be fulfilled in your life amen do we believe it today let's bow our heads heavenly father we love you thank you for your presence lord thank you for your spirit the people responding so well this morning even though i had way too much material lord i thank you i thank you that we have this much material lord oh it's something so blessing to us lord if we just reach down and pull down every out every nugget everything that you bless us so much lord i'm so grateful i don't want to let this moment pass without thanking you for what you've done maybe there's people here today that wasn't here wednesday here or perhaps they were here wednesday and they believe they received something from you lord i pray that that would continue in their lives whatever they got rid of whatever they threw out the door that that would continue as they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine may it continue to be an influence in their lives lord if they got rid of it help them not to dig it back up tell them not to go outside the church and try to find it and dig it back up and restart it again but lord may it really be settled for what forever lord i pray i pray that in our own prayer times lord as i felt through the week i just couldn't wait for this service and and lord my own prayer life even you i've anointed that and i thank you for that even more lord and what it could may continue to be so until i don't do it because i have to but because you're moving lord i pray you granted god i pray you'd move in this church in a mighty way lord may we know that what we believe doesn't come from the creed or a dog or because we've been taught a certain thing but it's because of divine revelation has come down in our day god sent a prophet in this age a prophet an elijah message to come but it come for a purpose it wasn't finished with the prophet but he come for a purpose to restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers we're so grateful for that today lord we don't want to hold on to any relic of the past lord no system a man no denominational system or mindset oh god lord we want to walk where you all we want to be exactly what you want us to be clean us out lord wash us by your word every day lord we get to come as brother branham and the part i didn't get to talks about purgatory we didn't we don't come lord and after we die go into a purgatory to be purged from our sins but we come to the house of god to hear the word and the word the blood of jesus christ cleanses us the word blood purges us from all sins we're so thankful for that today thank you for the opportunity to be washed by the water of the word thank you for your word thank you for the opportunity to worship lord we love you and we thank you for all that you do every day in jesus name hey man do you love him this morning
