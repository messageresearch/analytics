you Lord for this opportunity Lord I don't take it lightly to stand before your people and I ask Lord that you would bind my lips before I would speak anything that would not be pleasing to you Lord I

we'll be sure to give you all the glory in Jesus name amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight and if you have your Bibles let us if we could turn to First Kings uh chapter 10 First Kings chapter 10 and verse one man if I could title this tonight I would title it the greater one is here do you believe that the greater one is here I've been thinking on the uh messages that have been preached and and uh about the stronger man that brother Ben's been dealing with and and just uh uh brother Andrew last week he's in our midst and brother Stuart come in and just did a wonderful job on Sunday night and we really enjoyed that and we just uh thankful for the ministry here in the church that I get to I get to listen to and I know you had to put up with me tonight but uh it'll go quickly and we'll we'll be right on out brother Bill brother Bill shaking his head he just don't believe me just don't believe me good to see brother Bill uh last week he was in the hospital getting a pacemaker put in and it went a lot longer than they thought and man it was good to see him already back in church on a Sunday aren't we thankful For What the Lord Has Done For Us amen makes us want to just shout a little bit but let's get right into the word of the Lord First Kings 10 verse1 and when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all her questions that were that was not anything hid from the King which he told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom wiom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cut bearers and his Ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom how be it I believed not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosper ity exceedthehype the Earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here and you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word and just tonight just to lay a background this queen and she I don't know if you know if you've ever looked on a map to see how far she traveled but it was approximately it's believed to be around 1250 mil on Camel so it's a long trip and it's in it's in the Middle East there around Sudan I believe it is and Sai Arabia right there in Saudi Arabia next to the Red Sea and she travels about 1250 miles approximately uh on by by way of camel to see this man who has a gift of God just think about that because she wanted to see if it was if it was true and so she had hard questions for him and she wanted to try the gift and see if it was real but now I want you to notice something she wasn't going to see God himself and and she wasn't going to see I mean even a prophet necessarily but she wanted to try the gift that the man had and see if it was true now she was not a Believer brother brandham said she was she was an unbeliever she was just a uh she was just a a person of the day she was serving other gods she didn't serve uh the god of Solomon and so she comes from the uttermost parts of the earth and and she comes to Palestine there and she was uh all the way brother Bram said across the Sahara Desert and he said uh and he talks about it and he goes in in depth and I love the story because of the sacrifices that she made yet not a Christian and not a Believer and had no idea if what she had heard was even real when she got there but when she got there she tried to she tried the gift and she gave hard questions and and he was able to tell her every secret of her heart and everything and and he was to show amen that there was a real gift there and there was something great in in Solomon now I want you to notice that Jesus would also say that a greater than Solomon is here so when you're coming out here to see on the house of in the house of God on a Wednesday night amen it's not to see a man it's not to see even to hear the words of a prophet amen or see the gift and action of a prophet but what you're coming to see is God himself because of greater than Solomon is in the house of God a greater than Solomon is among us tonight a greater than any man or a greater than a prophet is here to reveal every secret of your heart tonight so I'm here to tell you that it's worth the effort to come out to church on a Wednesday night why because God is here to meet you and it's more than just a prophet it's more than just a king it's more listen church it's God himself that is here to meet you tonight and he knows every need every every problem you're going through every situation that may look too hard nothing is impossible with my God nothing is too hard for God and I'm I'm I'm glad to say tonight that I've seen you know we can see by video the gift in action in our day and we can hear the words of a prophet but I want to remind you that it is more than just a prophet that we're following but it is God that is moving in our day using his men using his gifts and and we're not looking for something more we're not looking for that to come again but we're looking to see that Jesus is the author and the finisher and mean it's all about him it's all about God in our day and so it's not just a man it's not just to travel that far it's not you're not giving your money to a man you're not giving your time to a man but you're giving it to God can you say amen amen so brother Brandon would talk about this and he actually talks about humility in the fifth seal and I like I I want to throw this in there just as a as a foundation he said what makes God great is because he can make himself so simple and that's what makes him great God is great and can make himself in such a simple form that the wise of this world can't find him and they just find they just can't find him because he makes himself too simple now he said watch this in itself is the The Mystery of the revelation of Jesus Christ see he said this in itself there's can be nothing greater than God can you say Amen there come on somebody there's no Prophet greater than our God there's no gift greater than our God there's nothing greater than our God and he is his work can you say amen and so brother brand would go on and he would say he said nothing greater than God you can't make anything he said as simple as he makes himself see and that's what makes him great because God has come in Simplicity in our day can you say amen amen so you could look at the at the gift that that brother brandham came with and say well was was that God no that wasn't God Amen the gift was not God God was using the man and using the man to perform a gift through the man but don't get don't mistake the man for God don't mistake the gift for God because God was using the man and God is the one that that performed the gift but but listen church it's more than that he is Among Us us he is a living God he listen the worst thing you can do is make a god of history and and try to keep him in history because if he ever was then he still is and if he ever did anything then he's still more than able to do the same thing today so brother BR would go on like this he said there isn't anything in this life satis satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you'll find the sum total of all perfection in Christ thank you Lord everything Fades into insignificance beside him he that hath the Key of David this beautiful phrase he said follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization he said here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus liken to Moses was the prophet of God and he said David was a man after God's Own Heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David he said he said now King of Kings Lord of lords God very God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the showbread reserved for priest he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ but now remember you couldn't Elevate David to Christ because he was just a type of Christ I want to get somewhere I hope you're still with me tonight in 1 John 4:4 he says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world I know we hear that phrase all the time but greater is he than the trouble you're in Greater is he than the circumstances surrounding you greater is he than the problems that are trying to overtake your life greater is he than any sickness that would come on your body I I think tonight we need to just give praise to God because he is great and he still does Miracles and he still brings us out of bondage and he still sets the captives free he is great and I believe that he is more powerful here tonight than he's ever been why because he he's he's proven himself time after time that he's if he's done it for the the children of Israel then brother Bill he can do it for us here tonight amen God does not change he is no respector of persons he doesn't just come to a prophet but he comes to the lowest of the low amen he came to Simon's house and he didn't come to the religious people in Simon's house but he revealed himself to a woman that had an ill Fame and and had done all kinds of bad things but I want you to notice something he was the greater one in the room and they failed to recognize it but the one that recognized the greatness of Jesus was the one who would re would would reap the benefits of Christ's coming and I want to say tonight if we could recognize that he is the great one there's no big eyes and no big eyes and little 's there's there you know all the spokes in a bicycle wheel of the same size but I want you to notice something there is somebody who is greater than the spoke and the will and amen he is the Hub he is the center of it all he is the whe in the middle of the whe he is Christ he is all things to the believer can you say amen he said he said he that is in you he is Christ brother brand said as John said he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world and that was Christ he is greater than all the world because he conquered the world and is the greater than all those things because he conquers it he conquered it for us can you say amen and he said we are more than conquerors through him him that loved us and gave himself for us so we are not the conquerors unless we're in him amen it's got to be through him there's got to be somebody greater he already conquered the world for us can the church say Amen tonight and he said we're more than conquerors why he said he gave himself for us that he might come back and do his Works through us to prove to us that he is the same yesterday today and forever now brother brand would go on he said in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth renounce your sickness cuz greater is he that's in you than the devil that's trying to take your life you are children of God you are the redeemed somebody ought to testify tonight I'm a Child of God I am the redeemed I am bought with a price can you say Amen am mean the blood of Jesus has covered all your past sins and mistakes if he did it for your past he'll do it for your future well can you say amen amen I think the Church of God we've looked at all the problems around us long enough let's look to to him the author and finisher of our faith I know it's easy to get critical and it's easy to get a spirit on us where we we get nothing out of church but it's time that we realize that we didn't come to see one another and we didn't come to criticize but we came to meet with him who is worthy of our time thank you so brother Brandon would go on like this he said then what about Healing The Sick sea greater is he that's in you than the sickness SE because that's an interruption interrupting the very laws of God sickness is so if You' got a sick in your life that's just an interruption in the laws of God that's not something that that was not that was not God giving you the sickness and he allowed it to come on you amen maybe just to show his glory in your life amen I wonder if sometimes the trouble we're going through maybe we we we we we gripe about the problem but what about trying to trying to get a testimony out of that problem and saying Lord I know I'm going through a trial but I believe on the other side there's going to be Victory because you're with me and you've already conquered this problem for me amen I believe tonight we need a positive testimony and leave the things of negativity in the past and press forward towards the mark of the High Calling come on somebody tonight I know that we've had a lot of negativity in our lives and I know the world is a negative place to live in but tonight if you could look to the greater one that is Among Us amen he is greater than every situation that you'll go through he's greater than the prison bars that Paul and Silas were behind amen he's greater than the bills that you can't pay he's greater than all the things that have come against you every devil that has come against your family he's greater than that here tonight amen if you could see the greater one among us then I believe all your troubles amen they'd look a lot smaller to you amen all your sickness amen you'd start to see healings come in your family why because he is greater and he is worthy of Our Praise because he's great and he does Miracles so great and and and I believe he's still doing that today you say what are you preaching tonight I'm trying to tell you that if a if a queen could travel 1,50 Mi on the back of a camel just to see a gift what are we what ought we to do today to see a living God and a living bride and among his people amen we ought to lay aside everything that would try to stop us and lay aside every sin and lay aside every little critical spirit and every kind of thing that would try to hold us from a blessing I say lay it aside tonight and put your focus back on the one who is greater can the church say amen amen because great he deserves to be worshiped when we come to church amen I I I know there's all kinds of things sometimes I'll sit there and it's too hot sometimes it might be too cold for somebody and you know what we all have our problems and we are all built different and we like things in a different way amen but it's all about him in the house of God it's all about what he can do for us amen it's a meeting place where God has chose to meet us and he's and if he and if he promised to be here then I think we need to re recognize that he is the greater one Among Us amen you can put the greatest preacher in the World Behind the pulpit but if God doesn't show up then the greater one's not there amen you can put the you can put the uh you can put the lowest preacher on the totem pole behind the pulpit I want to tell you tonight if God shows up then God can speak through I mean he can speak through anything that he wants to use he can speak through anybody he can speak to his people why because he's more than able to do whatever he wants to do because he is the greater one he is the great God Amen and I love this brother Brandon would say well well the greater is he that's in you that's the Healer that and the Creator than the devil that's interrupted the very program of your life greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see greater was he that was in Elijah greater was he that was in that was in Isaiah than he said the time was or any of those prophets because they seen past the time see greater is he that was in job even the skin worms and death in the grave because he said by a vision he said he he saw the coming of the Lord and he said My Redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon the Earth and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God see greater is he that was in job than the death greater because he said death tried to take him and couldn't do it it couldn't do it because he said I'll rise up again and he did now I want to notice I want you to notice tonight amen death might try to take you out out of this body but death can't take you out of of the body that he has prepared for you because death has already been conquered can you say amen amen you might die in this body but you can't die in the body that God has already prepared for you why because he came to overcome death hell in the grave and I want you to know tonight that it's not just about about about dying and and listen we all talk about death and and you know statistically 10 out of 10 die I didn't know if you knew that or not but unless the Rapture comes we're all going to be down there seeing Joe but I want you to notice tonight not the young ones he might go first but I want you to notice tonight that even if that should take you then death still didn't win right that's right well can you say man why because the the the devil is the author of those things amen death came by the fall and we are not in listen our theophany body the body that is waiting for us is not in a fall State oh come on somebody but that body that is waiting for us is just like his glorious body oh I wish I could preach here for a minute I believe if you'll get a revelation that no matter what happens to this body you've got one already waiting on you because the greater one went to Calvary and shed his blood so that you wouldn't have to die and go to hell am mean if the blood's over you brother Bill amen you're just as close to a new body now as you've ever been amen but that body though though it may Decay and though may lay in the grave one of these days and me that is not the finality of a Christian because we have someone something already waiting for us why because the greater one showed his works the greater one sister Janie amen he said I'll give you life Everlasting anden the greater one is in the room here tonight and if you've got a problem you don't have to wait till Sunday morning the greater one can take care of your situation the greater one why because he said he'd meet us can we just go ahead and say Lord I know you're here I may not feel you here but I know you're here and the greater one Among Us and if he's so great then we ought to just show up with such anticipation that we're going to meet the king of kings and the Lord of lords amen it's greater than meeting the president of the United States it's meeting the the the King of Kings amen it's meeting Christ himself why because he promised to be here and he does not break a promise thank you Lord he doesn't break a promise brother BR would go on he said he said it like this excuse me 1 Chronicles if you got that 1st chronicles 16 16:25 for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and also is to be feared Above All Gods can you say amen for all the gods of the people are Idols but the Lord made the heavens well the church ought to say amen amen do you realize who you're serving tonight it is not just a god a far off but it is a present tense God it is an OM omniscient God Amen he's everywhere you go amen he he knows everything you do he knows every trouble he knows every trial he knows every time you you you failed him amen but if you'll just get on your knees and say Lord I failed you but I'm coming humbly back to you he is faithful and just to forgive you why because he is the greater one Among Us it's hard for for sometimes for a human being to forgive and forget amen but once you have been forgiven he not only forgets it but he wipes it off and puts it in the sea of forget this brother Justin amen he no longer sees what you did he don't even see those past sins and the past mistakes once they're under the blood they're gone for good because the greater one can you say amen amen amen verse 27 he says it like this Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place give unto the Lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the Lord glory and strength we ought to give him glory here tonight give unto the Lord the glory do unto his name bring an offering and come before him Worship the Lord in the beauty of his Holiness well the church ought to say amen amen these are the words of God not the words of a man amen he said fear before him all the Earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved let the heavens be glad and let the Earth rejoice and let men say among the Nations the lord reth well can you say praise the Lord here tonight amen the Lord Reign is Let the Sea Roar and the fullness thereof let the field rejoice and all that therein is then shall the Trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord because he cometh to judge the Earth and I love this one oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen it's not just till tomorrow not just till the next day but if you've got a problem his mercies endure forever if you've got a situation that seems like you can't get past it he endures forever well can you say Amen tonight if you've got loved ones that are not saved his Mercy endures for forever and I believe he's here tonight and his mercies are still in enduring forever well can you say man I love this in Psalms 964 for the Lord is great can you say the Lord is great and greatly to be praised and he said he is to be feared above all gods in Psalms 868 he said among the gods there is none like unto thee Oh Lord neither are there any works like under thy Works amen so it is not the man's works but it is the Lord that is working through the man amen the Lord is speaking through man am mean it's the voice of God it's the actions of God all the time and if we could ever realize look past the humanity look past the mistakes look past all these things and realize the greater one came Among Us in our day and he it wasn't brother brandom standing there and revealing the secrets of the hearts but it was the greater one that would come on the platform and stand with him and it would discern the hearts of the people and it would never miss why because it wasn't brother brandom doing it but it was the greater one that was there with him I want to tell you tonight we're not following a man but we're following the greater one that used the man is that okay I know we're following a man but as he followed Christ remember he had to be in Christ he had to be in tune with God in order for the gift to operate and mean sometimes he would stand at the platform and he would say I'm waiting on him because I'm just as helpless as any other man well can you say Amen I'm just as helpless if he was helpless what about me what about you I mean he had to wait on the great one to come and then there would not be a sick person that would believe in the building you say people left sick people died yeah because not everybody believes anden even the queen when she went to see Solomon she had questions and she she she really didn't believe it but then she went and she saw it and she couldn't deny that God was using Solomon and I want to say today there's been many skeptic around the message but I want to tell you this God used that man and I'm not pointing to the man as infallible but I'm pointing you to a greater one who is the infallible God he never lost a battle He's been Faithful in Victory he's overcome every war he is still God the greater one Among Us I was talking about Simon's house a minute ago he was the greater one but he's unrecognized by many because he doesn't come the way you expect him to come is that okay but it changed somebody's it changed a woman's life amen who the who who everybody else said hey look even the disciples would stand there and criticize well can you say man the disciples would criticize the woman and she's the very one that recognized the greater one was in the house amen the greater ones in the house tonight amen you say well I'm looking at you brother Joel don't look at the humanity but look to the word of God because he's still the greater one Among Us right everybody still awake amen brother R said it like this and a man that's a Son of God reads the Bible and see what God was yesterday he's the same today he believes him to be the same in principle in power everything that he ever was the great Jehovah is still the same can you sayen amen it's Hebrews 138 he's he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen he's never changed and he never will change amen the same God that can discern the heart of the queen is the same God that can discern the heart of his bride here tonight thank you Lorden you say what we if we had a man here that could discern our heart no the the discerner is here come on somebody amen you we we've made it a we've made it a side show where some man's got to stand here but that's not what it's about we're not to give glory to the man but give glory to the greater one because he's came he come in humility in our day and he's still here hiding himself in a bride amen he's revealing himself in humility can you say Amen brother brand said he's the same he said a true son believes that a true son believes that brother Brandon would say it like this God is great in battles when he sent you don't be scared stand there and see God's salvation anden he said stand there there's only one who could produce salvation and that's God no one else can bring Salvation but God you say I want my children saved well you you can't just getting them to church is good that's a nice thing but God has got to come and change their life God has got to come on the inside of them or they could go down a wet Center or a dry Center and come up a wet Center amen they could come to church and sit there and split hell wide open well come on somebody it's time we realize we got to get serious with God tonight we're not just traveling to church just to see what you're wearing or who's who's there and who's not there but we're here to meet with the greater one that promised to show up and meet every single need do you say Amen tonight remember the r would say like this he said he's great he said stand there there's only one who could produce salvation he goes on down he said stand still and see the salvation of God he said Here Come the Army he said oh when I think of it here come the Army and the dust are roaring and when Moses Stood Still to see the salvation of God the great Pillar of Fire that was hanging before them had led them into this trap and moved and went over and stood between Israel and Pharaoh's Army so the same light that led the children of Israel was the same light that would blind the unbeliever oh come on somebody amen we are we are we are following a light but not everybody can follow this light because some will look at it and say well with a skeptical eye and say well that was for another day or or that can't be true and they they just don't recognize that God is always the same and he is an everpresent help and he's always here he's omniscient he's always Among Us and he's living in us and with us and through us and and why because he promised he would and if he promised it then he's still here he is the greater one Among Us right come on how do I recognize the greater one Among Us brother Joel well it only comes by the Holy Spirit leading you into all truth because the greater one is the word come on and if the let me just stop here for a second amen that's why it's so hard for the people to see because if it was a man standing here with nail scars and and he was uh you could say well he he he came back and this is the literal Jesus and he was standing here amen there'd be all kinds of Hypocrites say oh now we believe amen but he but he hid himself in simplicity so that he could actually hide himself from the wise and The Prudent but he would reveal himself to people that would learn and and babes and suches would learn why because he's not coming to that group of people and the intellectual group of people but he's coming to a bride group of people who have humbled themselves and who have not elevated themselves to smarter than everybody else and greater than every body else and and and try to elevate men as as something better than what they are no we're not here to do that tonight but we are to elevate one man and that is God himself well he is he alone is God and and and I want to tell you tonight I'm not putting down a a prophet and saying that he has no place amen he does have a place and he was a type and he had a Ministry that was a son of man Ministry and I don't deny any of those things but I want you to know tonight look past the humanity and see the greater one that was here and he still among us tonight amen cuz men can die men can fail you men can fall away men can do all kinds of things but he can never fail you amen he can never fall away he can never die because he's always with his bride can you say am man here tonight amen am man I hope this is okay but I just want you to know the greater one is here and if he's here then you need to take your troubles and your burdens to the Lord amen take take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there amen quit quit trying to go to the Lord and and say well I I just can't seem to do this on my own I I he knows you can't do it on your own that's why he went before you in battle that's why he put the pillar of fire on the other side of the Israelites why because he had to blind those who would actually try to come after him and and listen Church the the same one that was leading which is this message you say well so so and so couldn't accept it no because it blinded them but aren't you glad that you can walk in the evening light that has led you this far amen it was Jesus Christ amen it is the Jehovah of the old Jesus of the new it is the same God all the time it is him and he is worthy of Our Praise he is worthy of all things he is worthy to be adored why because he didn't leave us like he found us come on is that okay he didn't leave you brother Bill like he found you but he changed you and made you a Son of God and if you're a Son of God and I I love this not to steal brother Josh Bennett's sermon from the other night but he deal with us his sons and I want you to know he really does and sometimes when you're dealing with a son am me you have to let him fall down and get a get a bump on their knee or or fall flat on their face but when you're dealing with them like that it's not because you don't love them it's because you are trying to show them that there is someone greater and you can't walk alone you can't do this on your own but there is a God come on somebody there is a God and he's not 2,000 years away he's not 2,000 years ago and he's not so far off in the future that you can't ever see but he's an everpresent God and he is the water that is Flowing from The Rock in this day I think we need to grab a hold of that fact tonight and you would you you you would see your problems get smaller you would see your children listen Church we've held on to our children by fear of losing them that's right come on y'all okay tonight you start telling well my my kids are going to be lost if you start dealing with them like they're never going to be lost and say listen I know you're coming back I know you're coming back let us show our faith muscles once in a while and show the devil whose side we're on the greater one is still in control of it all thank you Lord thank you Lord and if he's in control of it all then let us let us just not take the burdens upon oursel and try to be God because we we can't be in that role we weren't meant to be but we were meant to be worshippers of God we were meant to take our needs to God because he's our father and we can go to him and and when you go to him in prayer don't you think he didn't listen to you amen he heard your prayer he heard your need he heard the desire of your heart and if he heard you he will answer you in his time he will answer you why because he's great enough to do it but you've got to believe that God is still able to keep his word now brother Brandon would talk about this I've read the quote and I don't actually have it with me but he said all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into his church now I want you know that the Greater Works that you do is not the Greater Works on your own but it is actually the Greater Works that he is doing through you on see that takes the humanity out of it Brother David because if we're laying hands on the sick it's not my hands it's the word of God being fulfilled that we're we're we're elevating amen it is not the man that lays the hands on you that matters it is the fact that you went in obedience and believed that the word still works are you still with me tonight amen if the word still works that's why we do what we do if the word still works that's why we gather at the house of God and if the word still works that's why that we have Altra calls because it's worked before and it's why we do it's why we lay hands on people it's why you you'll see sometimes we'll have a prayer line in a meeting amen it's not just to have the biggest prayer line the most preachers lined up and and and if you if this one didn't pray for me it's not going to work listen church it's not about the man it's about the greater one that is Among Us Changing Life and healing bodies that's the one we're looking at amen when you get your eyes on a man you're sure to fall or you're sure to be led astray but if you get your eyes on him he is the North Star you you can set your compass by him amen he is above all come on somebody amen he is greater he is mightier amen he's stronger he's better amen he's just a good good father and I'm here to tell you tonight it don't matter what you're going through in the bad times he was good in the good times he's good in the Valley he's God on the Mountaintop he's still God and I'm here to tell you tonight church that he's God in whatever your situation is I may not be able to help you in your situation but the greater one that is Among Us can bring you through no matter what you're in I want you to notice David had been through some really bad times but David could say that he is worthy of Our Praise David had been in the valley amen but in the valley that's where he was his soul was restored and then he could come out praising amen I want you to know tonight I I think that we ought to be so in tune with the fact that the greater one is here that we don't just come and sit like we normally would but when we come to the house of God we would say you know what I know the greater one is here Lord you need to come on the scene for my situation move on my behalf tonight when I feel like I can't raise my hands put your spirit in me and hold up the hands that have that have fallen down anden raise the spirits that have that have gotten down trotten and maybe the blues have set in or the depression has come on you I want you to know tonight he is worthy because he's the greater one Among Us sir thank you Lord you say well it's Wednesday night brother Joel and I don't feel it well it don't matter he didn't ask if you felt it he asked if you believed it and if you believe the greater one is among you then we might as well go ahead and just say listen I'm not trying to Hype you tonight I'm not going to do that to you on Wednesday night but I want you to know something if the greater one is here I don't care what your situation is don't you leave this building thinking that God don't care for you don't you leave this building thinking there's nothing here that can save your soul don't you leave thinking well he didn't meet with me tonight he's here and he wants you to surrender yourself so that you can see amen the great power of God Amen he wants to reveal himself to you why because he is the greater one Among Us he is he is amen he's in you brother Bill he's in brother Joe he's in sister Jackie amen he's in you the Great greater one is there but he wants fellowship with his sons thank you Lord but the greater one is here brother Rand would say he's great in battle and he would go on down he said if he is here if he is here his spirit is here come on that's what makes him then if we can surrender ourselves and get our own thoughts away just like this he talks about his microphone has no thoughts he said then another voice can speak through it he said that's the way if we can empty ourselves out there is the secret get rid of yourself well can you say Amen get rid of your own thinking get rid of your own ways and then let God moveen Amen if you came in here thinking there was going to be a certain type of service get rid of that thought and let God move amen is the church okay tonight are you still there can you say Amen so if you came here and said well I'm just going to go to church for an hour and a half and I'm going to leave get those thoughts away I ain't done yet Satan is defeated that's what brother random says here he knows he's on the earth he is going like a roaring Li it isn't long oh he's finished he said he knows this time he's going like a roaring lion but remember the Prince of Peace stands by the Great Divine one man I don't know how much Glory we can give to God tonight but I feel like that we we might as well do it while we're here here amen I I'm not here to to elevate anything but him tonight and I want you to know that I'm not I'm not trying to preach to you anything that's not in the scriptures anything that's not in the message I want to tell you that he is the greater one and the message was only to declare that he is here and if he's here nothing is impossible to them that believe can you say man and so Satan is going around like a roaring line he said it isn't long till oh he's finished he knows his time he's going around like that he said but the Prince of Peace stands by the Great Divine One the architect of my being the architect who built me what I am who built you what you are is here the very one that designed you the very one that thought up how you would look Brother David and how tall you would be amen the very one that thought of that amen the very one that came and and brother Bill he he he he made you in the very image that he knew you would be he knew exactly what you would look like and where you'd be sitting church tonight I mean he's the architect he's the one that knows every detail and every hair that you have on your head he is the great one and he knows he and he said who knows better than the architect and he's here to prove himself that he's here amen I think tonight church we we we've put God too far away and Out Of Reach but but he's actually right here brother Brandon said he's as close as my right arm anden he's right here in the building with us he would say time after time he would say if you could just see the one standing by me amen he's the greater one he's the one that can do the works amen that that that would make a every person in this building go away saying you know what I met with the King of Kings I met with the Lord of lords and I met the greater one in church tonight and all my troubles are laying at his feet and I'm going to go out the doors rejoicing and praising God that every battle is won every Victory is already taking place in my life come on church amen I think what we need tonight is more of him preached and more of him in our lives and the greater one taking control amen Jesus take the will amen let him take control of your situation let him take control because you haven't done a very good job of it yourself I haven't done a very good job of it myself but when you give it to Jesus well can you say Amen if you'll give it to him he can take control of your life amen can you say man tonight he said he's the architect he here and brother Brandon would say this and I you all know the quote I think I mentioned it already he said my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or teacher he said and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean it amen he was a human but he said but this is my Ministry SE to declare him that he is here it wasn't about brother Brandon but it was about him he didn't get up there and say look at me look at the man look at the five six man that's standing here look how big I am no it wasn't about the man it was about the the God in the man amen it was a son of man revealing the son of man as the greater one that was Among Us in our generation can you say amen amen so you know why people people they say well you follow somebody told me on the job site the other day well you're a brand ofite I said well I don't care what you call me I said I'll tell you this I said I can show you where I'm going when I die because of this message and he said well he said I'm Baptist and I said well I mean that's good amen I I I would identify as that too if I was a chicken I didn't tell him that part but you know what you know sometimes sometimes I'm okay with that name because listen the church has always been called crazy the church has always been called holy rollers and the church has always been called you know we're just a little off we're just a bunch of nuts we're just crazy amen but I'm not a I'm not a listen I'm not following the man the flesh man I'm following the greater one that he proved to be among us thank you Lord So when you say what are you I'm a Christian I'm a message believer because the message is to prove that Christ is still alive am me all the other denominations listen I don't put any of them out of heaven but I'll tell you this they're pointing you to a god that was or a God that will be we got some message people like that they're pointing you to a message that was or a message that will be but I'm here tonight to declare the same thing that a prophet declared that he the greater one is here Among Us doing the same Works doing the greater things why because it's not the man the man could leave the scene the man could die but the greater one can't die well can you say man I'm almost done so stay with me a few more minutes is that okay brother brandom said I feel so bad today when people try to make God something in a history I want to ask you something what good is a god of History if he isn't God today well can you say man what good is he he said what good is this Bible if it's something yesterday if it ain't the same today what good is the god of Moses if he isn't the same today he said he is the same God he has risen from the dead he's here to prove himself that he's still the same God well somebody ought to say Amen to that amen he said you say I have no faith to believe it but you're afraid to let loose what good does it do to put a bird that has wings in a cage am mean if he isn't out of the cage that's right his wings doesn't do any good I mean you got to have a wing in another world and he said he said that he he said in this church tonight there's enough faith to heal every person here but you're afraid to get out of the cage and get out of the cage he said now don't feed your Bo your bird more food he said you can be feed your bird ever such Orthodox food if you don't let him out of the cage what good is it going to do him that's right it ain't the your food it's tur him loose he's not a god of History altogether he's the same today how can people claim him to be something that he was and isn't now when did our God lose his power when was he ever any different what what's the use of talking about a holy ghost the apostles had that helped and blessed the people then if he won't do the same today well can you say amen he said he won't do the same today it can't make sense out of it Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the greater one his entire Ministry the greater one was proven to be there and he's not didn't die in 1965 but the greater one is still here I'm tonight church that the same God of Elijah the same God of Jesus am mean that that walked the shores of Galilee and made himself a flesh man the same God that met Paul on the road to Damascus is the same God that is in our midst tonight the same one in William brandham the same one that has sustained the church all through the Dark Ages is the same God that is here tonight to do the impossible in your life you say you don't know what I'm going through you don't know the situation I'm in I'm here to tell you encourage yourself in the word encourage yourself in the Lord because the greater one has never lost a battle come on church amen if you could recognize who he is and and and your faults listen Church they're not that big of problems if you realize how big he really is he's bigger than any problem he's bigger than anything that would try to come against you amen he is so great and he is so good too and say and you say well I deserve better no you don't even deserve life itself but you're here anyway amen we don't deserve we don't deserve to sit here in a building on a Wednesday night and worship the god that we're worshiping but he gave us the ability to do that because he sent his son and the spirit that's in you led you to the church tonight and that same spirit is what raises that hand in worship and it's the same thing that is holding on to the faith of a Rapture amen I believe it's time that we we let loose of the cage and and and get out of the cage and start flying like eagles that we are and say Lord I'm here to worship I'm here to fly into the heavenlies I'm here to love you more than I ever have before I'm here to lay down everything at your feet that would be unlike you I'm here to lay aside every weight and everything that would so easily beset me but Lord I'm here in your presence and I'm running to you amen I'm not just walking to him but I'm running after him because I know he is the greater one in my life amen I think tonight Church brother Brandon would say like this he said he said he's praying here and he said we pray now that you'll bless every person of divine presence everyone that hears this tape Lord around the world may they get away from those old Creeds and things and come and serve the Living God come and invest in it can you say am man he said like the do like the queen of the South did she come and took her three months to get to where the man was representing God excuse me to where the man was representing the the god of heaven and Solomon and she Jesus said she come from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here and we know that greater than Solomon is here the greater the great Holy Spirit himself is here working through the people how we thank you for this father and that's what I want to say tonight church if we know the greater one is here then we ought to thank him for being Among Us amen I believe the greater one is here to do the impossible in your sit situation tonight am mean I don't know what this was this message was for but it was on my heart because I know that in this world we're going to have trouble but a mean greater is he he came to overcome the world Amen he made the world he made all that there is and if he made it he can take care of it amen if he made you amen I love the song If he made the sparrow and if he if he taught to give a fish a place to swim how much more does he care for you and I here tonight why because he is the greater one Among Us as the musicians come all that God was he poured into Christ thank you Lord and He poured into Christ and Christ bled there at Calvary and when he died he gave up The Ghost and then he would actually AR raise from the dead and three days later he would conquer death hell in the grave and that ought to make somebody shout hallelujah and then he would actually he would Ascend into the heaven and he would send his Spirit back to the church and if his spirit is in you tonight tonight then remember the greater one is in you amen the greater one is not coming but the greater one is here amen he he's coming into a physical form but the greater one that's among us tonight he can take care of all of your problems all of your problems you say well if I get the Holy Ghost do I still need to go to church the Holy Ghost will make you go the Holy Ghost will make you love one another the Holy Ghost will will make you look at that problem and you say mountain move because the Holy Ghost is in me and I I have authority as a Son of God I have authority of a daughter of god sister Sandra the problem's not too big for you and your children amen God has come to do the impossible God has come to take away everything that has been made wrong in this world he has come to make all things new and to make all things right why because he's the greater one amen do you believe the greater ones among us then I want you to stand to your feet Lord and I want us to just stand here tonight and just give thanks to the one that is here amen he didn't come he didn't come listen he didn't bring us this far to leave us I love the song he didn't teach us to swim to let us drown he didn't build his home in us to move away but he built that spot in our hearts the soul of man that is in US is so that he could come and live with us and we could fellowship with our father the greater one is Among Us do you believe it tonight with every head bowed every eye closed would you put your hand up to him and say every problem in my life I Surrender everything I have I give back to you every every every obstacle everything that has come against me I'm going to give it to the greater one that is in me and he's going to take control of the situation listen church we do our part we do our we do all the things we know to do we work we go to church we we we we raise our children but you know what when we've done all we can God's got to do the rest God has to take control amen and and tonight church he wants to take control of your situation but we need to give it to him tonight I wonder if we could just put our hands up as a sign of surrender and say I surrender all I surrender everything to you tonight I Surrender everything to the greater one that is Among Us I'm sacrificing here tonight my own self and my own time to give thanks to the one who is greater than all my sins man if you just if we just sing that brother Allan oh it's already done you believe it tonight hallelujah it's already done praise the Lord the Battle Is Over the victory oh do you believe
