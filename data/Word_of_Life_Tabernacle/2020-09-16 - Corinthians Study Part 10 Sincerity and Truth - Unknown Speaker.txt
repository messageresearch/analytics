request for sister cletus eyes and i want us to especially remember brother danny and sister vicky tonight in prayer and and uh both sick and uh lord's blessed us so far it seems like every time somebody comes down with this virus it's someone that hasn't been around the church so we've been very blessed by that but we want to pray for them especially and all of our elderly as you get older it just hits you a little bit harder than it did when you were younger so let's remember them especially tonight and all those affected by that heavenly father lord we thank you for the fact that you are still a healer that you are still the same yesterday today and forever lord i pray for sister cletus tonight as lord she's turning this in this request for her eyes lord we know that you're a

them lord i i pray that you would just come and and give them a peace and assurance tonight that everything's in control we thank you lord for being the healer scientists didn't know what this was but

help us to not be afraid lord to look forward and know that you are still god even in the trials and situations of life granted father we pray thank you for all you do and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in jesus name amen amen do you love him tonight amen turn with me if you would to first corinthians chapter 5. thank you for the music this evening we appreciate amanda being here and being able to play for us tonight and it was wonderful and a very gifted family if she hadn't done that allison might have had to play so first corinthians chapter 5 and verse 8 says therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that's what we want tonight we want sincerity and not just sincerity but truth that's what we need amen pray lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening we believe and accept that the bible is the basis for all of our conduct and for those of you that are watching tonight is probably more watching than what was able to come tonight but just try to stay glued in because i believe these things are important and i wish that there was someone better able to communicate it to you but but i'm the man that has the job and so we'll try to do that tonight but the bible is our foundation this is what we base all of our doctrine on and all of our conduct on is the bible that's what it comes from and you know a lot of people will say that but we believe that and we reinforced that from uh the message of the hour because we believe that our prophet was a scriptural prophet if not we have no business listening to him but he was a scriptural prophet he was foretold in the scripture and his ministry fit exactly what the scripture said it would be and then he stayed with the word when he came and and this is what he said about it he said so the bible is perfectly true and he said that's what we stand on the bible it must be thus saith the lord he said that we do believe that god can do things it's not written in his word because he's god he does whatever he wishes but yet i like to see anything when it comes to the line of a doctrine come out of the bible because i believe that the bible is the full revelation of jesus christ the bible said that's what it is it is the revelation of jesus christ and nothing is to be added to it or anything taken from it he said so i like to stay right in what it says and what it promises if he just do what he promised that's all i care to see anyhow he said then i know i'll see him so we do not base teaching order or discipline on tradition or on contemporary thinking because the thoughts change on how people deal with things but we we base it on the word of god and the book of corinthians is interesting and i chose the book of corinthians because i felt led to do that but a lot of people wouldn't because corinthians is a book of correction and we like ephesians because that's what we aspire to be corinthians is what we don't want to be as a church yet they were a christian church but the thing about corinthians is that the corinthians were not sinners they were not ungodly in that sense though they had sin in their midst but they were not just worldly people they were christians and not only were they christians they were going to go to heaven they were a true church not a false church they just had problems and corinthians really is the book of grace if you look at it like that because correction brings grace and opportunity for grace and and it means that it's not negative but it's it's a positive thing that god always does what he says he will do and the correction worked and when correction works it's god's way of providing grace to us god's way always does work and but the bill where we get in trouble is when we don't follow his way but god's way always works we don't follow the instructions and you know whenever i get this furniture from walmart and put it together i have a really hard time remembering to follow the instructions and you get it and you think oh this is going to be easy and you start to put it together and you've got pieces missing and you realize that you've got it inside out and upside down you should have followed instructions and and so if you had followed instructions you'd had a much easier time and the truth is the end result will be the same because god will correct us but if we'd follow the instructions we'd be better off i have a lot easier time in life um first corinthians 5 and 1 let's go there and look at some of these things and i'm just going to take an in-depth look at at this chapter and and then i may never visit visit this again but i just want to take a look at it tonight while we're going through this it's an opportunity for us to see how god works in first corinthians 5 and 1 it says it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife now he said it's commonly known this particular sin was widely known both to the church and to the community so this was not hidden sin this was something that was known and yet the man continued to do it even though everybody knew it he wasn't ashamed of it he thought it was right he thought was okay because grace you know covered him but it's not okay and so fornication is uh is a broad term it's the greek word porneia which is covers adultery incest fornication but it also covers idolatry and which is interesting because the two things are always always tied together brother branham calls it unclean living that's a pretty good way to put it unclean living and so he says this particular sin that this man did that he would have his father's wife he said it's not even named among the gentiles this is so horrible that even the gentiles who will do anything won't do this and it actually existed among the gentiles in their they wrote about it but they condemned it even the romans cicero uh had called it an incredible and unheard of wickedness it was heard of it was practiced but they reprobated people who did that and and here was a christian man in a christian church saying it was okay and the world even knew it was wrong it's wrong and some things are just obviously wrong and and those things should not be mentioned among us since it comes of saints they're obviously wrong we shouldn't have to reason we get in trouble when we reason because you can reason your way out of anything but there's some things you shouldn't even have to reason about it's not okay to have another man's wife it's not okay to commit fornication it's not okay to commit adultery those things are still true and so verse two says you're puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that had done this deed might be taken away from you and so apologize their failure to deal with sin to their party spirits you go look up the words puffed up in corinthians he's talking they have this spirit of arrogance because they follow certain teachers and because of that they feel like they can get by with anything god help us never to be like that just because you listen to me preach or anybody else you probably wouldn't get that with me but but if you listen to somebody preach and say well i follow him that's my pastor that's that's the person that i follow so i'm okay it creates a tribal spirit where you get certain groups and anything goes as long as you're in the group but everybody else's group we condemn them and the truth is we have to look at it equally it doesn't matter what group you're in what denomination you're in whether you're in the message or not sin is still sin ungodliness is still ungodliness so uh paul ties this to their party spirit that you're puffed up they're they're we see that today i'm in natural politics everybody's tied to their party right immensely tied to their party and and to the point where it doesn't matter what what he does it that's that's my man that's my party that's the way they were and so paul says you're puffed up and you've not mourned but you actually exalt this hey we got sin in the church and we don't do nothing about it we're exalted we're we have grace that's the modern church today that's the whole modern church today and so paul says your full strife and contention this is adam clark the way he put it in his commentary i liked it he said you're full of strife and contention relative to your parties and favorite teachers and neglect the discipline of the church had you considered the greatness of this crime you would have rather mourned and put away this flagrant transgressor from among you and now and we'll get into that and how that that worked and why it's rarely done but in first corinthians 5 and 3 it says privately as absent in body but present and spirit have judged already so i were present concerning him that has so done this deed and i don't know paul could have had a vision that of what it was and knew all the details from that but i think paul just is kind of shaming them in a way he's prodding them into action he says i'm not even there and i've already judged this is wrong and he's not trying to hide it it is what it is and so this is wrong and so in in verse 4 he says in the name of our lord jesus christ when you're gathered together and this is important when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ when you are gathered together now you can't do this virtually it's impossible to follow the commands of scripture in corinthians 5 if you never assemble yourself with other believers just like it's impossible to do foot washing and communion completely impossible you cannot say that you follow all of the word now excuse me for being harsh but it's just the truth you cannot say i follow all of the word and never assemble with believers it can't be done right because it requires assembly when you're gathered together do this you can't do it unless you're gathered together and my spirit he said with the power of our lord jesus christ so he says i'm with you in spirit i've already judged this and when you're gathered together you have the power of our lord jesus christ and paul takes that and if you follow along in your bible you can keep your place and then go to matthew chapter 18 and you'll find where paul is grind grounded his teachings in that's terrible english but he he he ground his teachings in the teachings of jesus christ which was rooted in the law of moses and so we find this in matthew chapter 18 and verse 15. and i know you probably know this but i want to build this up to where we can get through this chapter and matthew jesus here deals with how you deal with a brother who has had a trespass against you and so it's more than just someone caught in sin but also someone who's done you wrong or someone you you might hold a grudge against you say well i'll just tell everybody that's not what you're supposed to do he says if thy brother shall trespass against he go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone all right so there's the first step between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother and guess what nobody else found out right and that's the ideal that's where we want it to be most of the time because we're going to have problems and there's going to be situations but instead of going talking to somebody else about it talk to that person and i know excuse me but i've known preachers who held grudges against other preachers for years for decades and never talked to the man and vice versa and you think how how can you hold this in your heart and never even communicate with the person and see if you can gain a brother right now he says but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established you take that from moses law verse 17 and if he shall neglect to hear them if he should neglect to hear the two or three tell it unto the church but if you neglect to hear the church let him be into thee as a heathen man and a publican verse 18 verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven this is not a negative thing but he says you have the power to agree that something will happen and it will oh what a great thing that would be tonight if we could agree we could come together and agree that that certain things will happen because he says in verse 19 again i say unto you that of two of you so he said how many people does it take the jews i think had to have ten people to have a quorum or a majority to be able to have a meeting in the synagogue but jesus said if two of you agree on earth that's touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them my father which is in heaven where two or three we've got more than that tonight two or three maybe some of you have two or three sitting in the living room watching two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them i'm in the midst of them so when paul says that it's here you're gathered together he said when you gather together and my spirit in the name of the lord jesus this is what you're supposed to do and you know in denominational churches church discipline mostly comes from headquarters and it makes it easy on everybody because you just wait for the verdict i had a friend a boss who was a catholic and and she was a good woman but you know they changed out the priest every so often and if the priest got in trouble they shipped him off somewhere else and then they put another priest in and so they just were waiting to hear what rome said what priests that rome would put there we don't do things that way it's not the new testament way because it's not the way the church was set up the church was set up where the local church had authority and brother branham talks about that in hebrews chapter five and six he said but i believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly he said yes let each church be its own choose its pastors its deacons whatever it is and that way the man in there he said has no bishop over him the holy spirit wants to speak something something to that church they don't have to ask anybody whether they could do this or do that it's the individual in contact with the holy spirit and brother branham says show me the by the bible what's greater in the bible than a local elder to a local church and that could be misunderstood because he says greater it makes you sound like the local elder is a great man that's not what he's saying he's saying there's no one above him in the depth chart it's him and christ there's not a bishop somewhere that's above the local elder in in in the hierarchy right so there's no one greater in that way not that the man's even a great man might be a simple man a poor man might barely be able to speak but there's no one above that local elder in hierarchy and so he said that's right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each church in itself he said now brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in a brotherhood like that together i believe that he said but the sovereignty of the local church now so he says when you come together you gather yourselves together first corinthians 5 and 5 to deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus now brother branham does not look at this like we sometimes do as a negative thing it sounds bad doesn't it sounds harsh delivers such a one to satan for the destruction of the flesh brother branham does not use it in a negative way most of the time and as i begin looking at this it really it really gives me some comfort because it proves that you're saved now we don't understand election like we should but it proves if you can be delivered to satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved it proves that you're saved now brother branham had a lady in 1957 jehovah gyra a lady come up before him in the prayer line and he says the lady suffers with an extremely nervous condition he said and then she's wanting prayer for her eyes to because her eyes are getting dimmer and dimmer i didn't know sister cletus was going to put that request in tonight but but that's what was happening with this lady her eyes are getting dimmer and dimmer he said they're going out at the hardening of the nerve in the eye the optical nerve is dying which is shutting off the site he said but you're all upset about something and you're weary he said i see you shake your head or something in prayer he said you even wondered sometime if you're actually saved i don't make you raise your hand but i wonder how many of us have wondered that at some point sure of course you do because the devil wants to make you think that way you wonder sometimes if you're actually saved you'd have trouble with that he said that's true he said you've doubted your experience of being saved but i'll tell you now you are i love how confident he was of it i'll tell you now you are he said but this was caused by call he said some kind of a shock that you've had some news or something that shocked you all at once and caused this he said i think it was the death of your husband last fall he said god bless your heart lady and he says something interesting he said let's move the sadness the problem is not that you're not saved you just need to move the sadness how many times the believers need to just move the sadness because you just can't stay that sadness the rest of your life right so this is a positive thing move the sadness and here he was where he ties it back and so he begins to pray for her and he said let's move the sadness everything will be all right merciful god as i stand before this dear woman knowing there's a sad spirit around her he said i ask for thy divine mercy and guidance laying my hands upon her i charge that sad spirit to leave the woman he said christ lives christ he said cannot cannot no more take a word back that he said than nothing because he's god and he knows everything before he says it he said i condemned the spirit that would harm this woman in jesus christ's name amen he said now i just want to ask you he said he's still talking to the woman he said wasn't it something about he said you were worried about backsliding or something like that something on that order he said well look let me tell about your experience amen i like this he said now look sister he said this may hurt a little bit in the audience the reason was because they were pentecostals they were armenians they didn't believe you could keep your salvation believe if you sin you lost it you had to go get it again but he said this is gonna he said now this may hurt a little bit in the audience now if you don't believe this he said i'm talking to the woman see god he said god don't run his business like that i'm so glad he don't god don't run his business like they don't save you to lose you so when he tells the corinthians turn him over to the devil so that his his flesh could be turned over the devil can be destroyed so his soul could be saved his spirit could be saved what is he saying he's saved right you can do with that what you want to and how how saved was he i don't know enough to go to heaven right and and see that's not legalism that's grace now he says now you know he said you were once saved you know that he said well if god saved you here knowing he was going to lose you down there he defeats his own purpose he said he can't lose you he said he might have to take you off the earth because of your sin like the man in the bible who was living with his own mother and they turned him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved he said but he can't lose you you're hiss amen before the world begin he ordains you to eternal life and it's the devil trying to cheat you out of it listen what he says call him a liar i think we don't call the devil enough names call him a liar jesus christ jehovah jireh listen what he says jesus christ jehovah jireh has provided a place for you this is what he tells someone go get it amen he says live happy he provided a place for you go get it so you can't lose you so this was not a negative thing he says you you have to do sometimes what looks like a negative thing because you're following the word but in the end i'll make it turn out all right verse six your glorying is not good no you not that a little eleven leaveneth the whole lump so that one member affects the whole body and he says that when one member brother branham talks about this in a total deliverance he said when one member would talk against the other member and this is that next quote when one member would talk against the other member you know that's wrong i'm trying to give esther a little more time it's her first night back there he said you know that that's wrong he said you are commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to love one another does your brother have a fault go to him first between him and you alone and then then take it before the church if if it just can't be reconciled but someone is down let's pick him up help him he said now that makes us a unified group of believers he said now when we don't obey that then we don't obey god and we displease god he said and therefore our church our people cannot prosper the church cannot go on and he makes an interesting statement he says because we are disunified together and that's kentucky english right there disunified together jesus said a little leaven leavens the whole lump and but it makes perfect sense if you think about it you're together but you're not in unity so you're disunified together and whatever the church does the church has to do it may sound like a strange statement but whatever the church does the church has to do not some other church but the church the local church first corinthians 5 and 7 says purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you're unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore he said let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and go to the next the next slide verse eight now i'm getting too fast he said therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now he's alluding to the passover and and i like the way he puts it because he says not with the old leaven not with the leaven of malice and wickedness malice is the thought of sin wickedness is the act of sin he said but with the unleavened bread with sincerity and truth that word sincerity is literally something examined by the light of the sun and it's found to be pure and unadulterated sincere you know you can tell what color your tie is if you go outside a lot of times in the light like this you can't really tell what color it is but if you go outside you'll find out it don't match we need to get in the light of the sun and find out whether we match the word or not so he said let's go with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth something that can be examined and found to be true and we don't have to hide anything verse 9 paul explains himself he said i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators this was a previous letter lost to time now and you can follow me on this but this is just the truth you know sometimes we don't like to hear things but it's just the truth and it's got to be said but not every word that the apostles and prophets wrote is scripture it's just the truth and it was not meant to be preserved as scripture the word of god was preserved so a fool would not err therein and so i believe in the continuity of the scriptures that we have what we need but we don't have every word that paul wrote but we have what scripture right and if you don't believe that then it's really hard to have any confidence in what you're reading right because you're never going to know whether it's true or not but the word of god was preserved and the bible said so a fool would not err therein so that's that i feel pretty good about that so he said i did write to you before and i told you not to company with fornicators but he said yeah all together verse 10 with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters he said for then must you need to go out of the world because he said there's fornicators covetous extortioners idolaters all around you he said but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater a or a drunkard or an extortioner which such a one know not to eat because not only does he know better but he persists he's not talking about someone who's repented talking about somebody who won't repent now to keep company is to mix socially to have fellowship with he said don't do it not with a brother you'll have to do it with the world but don't do it with the brother who refuses to obey the word now verse 12 he said for what i've what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not you judge them that are within so he says the church is your jurisdiction you've probably heard that word jurisdiction if you've ever police they have a certain jurisdiction a court has a certain jurisdiction if it's out of your jurisdiction there's nothing you can do right and the church the local church is our jurisdiction this is what we're responsible for we can help others but this is what we're responsible for we don't have to judge anything that goes on outside i don't have to spend any of my time railing against other preachers and what they do wrong right i might say something sometime but i don't have to do that i may have an opinion but that's somebody else's jurisdiction because as a pastor i am not responsible for one person that doesn't come here and pay tithes and pay their offerings and come to the house of god i'm not responsible for anybody else right and so what they do is up to them that's between them and god every man will answer to his own master the scripture says but so them that are without god judges and that takes a great off of me a load off of me because i don't have to answer for that we just have to answer for our local church now he says but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person let's look at this and i won't hold you too long tonight and we're going we're doing pretty good so far so we'll get through this tonight i think i thought maybe we'd have to break it off and continue but i think we'll get through it that's good because you don't want to hear it again but when are we required as a local church to follow first corinthians five number one when the sin is commonly reported verse one so everybody knows about it if you don't know you you're not required to do anything about it right there's probably people come and sit among us that we don't know i'm not saying there is but there could be right and there could be situations you don't know about you're not responsible for don't let someone make you feel guilty for something you don't know about you're not responsible for that just responsible for what you do know then if you want to pray and ask god god give me more wisdom give me more insight give me more help me to be more cautious and more careful and things like that but but if you don't know you can't deal with it right and the second thing is when the person in question is a brother or sister and what this leads me to believe is that a person that would be dealt with in this way would have to be coming to church right if they leave in their own volition they don't claim to be a part anymore there's nothing we can do nothing we should do right because that that person is taking themselves out from under the protection of the church right so this would be and that's why it doesn't get used very much and it shouldn't be used very much most pastors have to do this once or twice in a lifetime if at all because it's not something that you do lightly right but if it's used it should be used and it'll be effective because it's the word of god right and that's the thing whatever the word says we want to do that we want to follow that and we want to make sure we stay right with the word regardless of who the person would be if it would be me you have a responsibility if it's a deacon you have a responsibility if it's a trustee you have a responsibility the church has a responsibility to police itself when the third thing is when the person has had a space to repent and reform but refuses if the person is repenting and you say well you should kick that person out of the church now as a pastor i can ask someone not to come but i can't kick them out of the church of god you know i can't take i can't do that i could i could say it's not a good idea for you to come here but if a person is repenting we have to take that at face value you understand that there's nothing that i can do if a person is repenting but then you watch a person's life and see whether it's real the proof is in the pudding it it comes out eventually but there's times you'll have to take someone at their word and that you should and we should because in reality all we have is our faith right and all we have is our trust in one another and that that's what we say you know i you believe i'm a christian you believe i'm a man of god you believe that i'm a i'm a god called man all right you take my word for that and you should but if it's proved otherwise then you have to move on right and so now but what is the required process to do this only the local church can do it nobody else can deal with our problems right only the local church can do it and that's in you look in verse four and it shows you that paul himself could not do it he said when you were assembled together you couldn't just do it by letter right when you're assembled together then deal with it so it can only be done as a last resort after you've gone through the matthew 18 the the steps you've gone to him yourself you've done everything that you can to to make sure it doesn't get out you know if you if you blow it at first then you can't do it it's got to come through the through the procedure it's got to be done right and then only as a body and and what this means is that a pastor just by himself couldn't do it because it wouldn't be effective a church would have to do it as i said usually a person takes themselves out from under the protection of the church they just leave and then and then we pray for those people and we ask god to get a hold of their heart because we we feel that when someone leaves it shouldn't be just something that oil they left you know but someone leaves especially if they go into sin they want to go to some other church that's that's up to them but if they leave and they go and fall into sin we should do everything we can to reach that person at the same time not becoming a partaker of their sin now brother branham talked about this in practice and we'll look at this real quick before we before we go and after a little bit and and brother branham says here not long ago a good preacher friend of mine he said had a boy and that boy had been going to church his own church he said he got to a place where he started running around with a little old girl who smoked and drank and carried on and the preacher said of course that's his business right we we can't tell him what to do but now he's part of the church and he said a very bosom friend of mine and a nice boy but he got all infatuated with some young woman and she had been married had some children her husband was living he was afraid that they were going to have that boy would marry her he said so the brother was all tore up he's running with a girl that is not good for him and has already been married and that's against the word right and so he knew that and and the man being his father the pastor of the church was the boy's father he said the brother was all tore up and he said to me brother branham he said i want you to go to this certain certain boy mine i want you to talk to him i'd want brother branham to talk to my boy you know what brother branham said he said brother he said i almost called his name he said you have a better way he said don't send me if the boy is not living up and the church has saw him doing wrong then it's the thing for the church to do this business that's left with the church and the church goes over and tells him brother branham picks up this story in 1958 and actually gives us the name of the pastor and why are we not a denomination he says he went and got one of the deacons and went down to his house and the boy's name was wesley he said wesley i want to talk to you i said are you going to straighten this thing up with the church and he gave him a short two answer like that and he said remember wesley i'm the pastor of that church i'm your daddy i'm going to do what god says to i've thought about this what would that be like if it's your kid that's hard but he said i've got to do what god said do and he says he says i'm the pastor remember wesley he said i'm the pastor of that church i'm your daddy but i'm going to do what god says do he says i'm giving you that's the next next quote he said i'm giving you 30 days to make that right with that church or we'll excommunicate you from the presence of god and remember he's taking brother branham's advice he said you're my own son that's my savior said i love you he said you know i love you wesley i die right now for you but you got to come straight with god's word he said see he said i'm the pastor i'm the shepherd of that flock if you're my child or whoever you are you got to line up with god's word if you don't do it then i'm not fit to be a shepherd he said boy that's a pastor he said that's a man don't you think so i don't know if i could do that i don't know i've never had to do it you say well i know i could okay you go right ahead i don't know unless you had to do it how do you know somebody says you've lost a loved one sometimes i know just what you're going through not unless you've been through that you don't know and i don't know and so i don't know what i would do but this man was a real man and he'd think like buddy robinson prayed he said lord give me a backbone like a sawlock that's that's what we need because in order to do them right so many times i see this especially with with mothers with their children but so many times a mother's made a certain way and a mother will reach out and keep reaching out and sometimes it becomes an enabling factor and how many times have you seen a mother enable their children to do drugs and alcohol and all these things when they'd be better off if they were cut off but that's hard to do it's easier said than done but now he says uh if you don't he said boy that's a pastor that's a man don't you think so that's the man he told this boy that and heard him he said but but said what who are you gonna hurt the man or hurt your savior so he said then we went on and said he wouldn't do it and i told the church he said my own son wesley he refuses to hear me in this matter he refuses to hear the deacon and you're a witness of this brother so and so yes i am he said all right at eight o'clock next sunday four weeks from now he said if he hasn't made that right with this church we turn wesley my son over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh he said his blood the blood of jesus christ in this church protect him no longer he said that night come stood on the pulpit and said he's got two more minutes the time come he said now as my son wesley rasmussen said to this congregation he said to you almighty god we've done all we can do according to your words and instructions of your son our savior has left us he said we now i turn my boy in this church with me over to the devil for the destruction of his flesh that his soul would be saved he said that's all was said nothing went on he said for a week or two maybe a month or two he said one night old wesley took sick what is that that's god keeping his word so when he got sick he kept getting sicker he called the doctor the doctor come up and examined him he had a fever of 105 he couldn't find no reason for it just kept getting sicker the doctor said boy i don't know what's happened to you he didn't know what to do he said we'll call a specialist they called a specialist specialist come in here they took him over to the hospital examined him everything else and said i just can't tell you the boy just looks deathly his wife standing there crying everything like that and the children standing around the bed everywhere like that he said he's going that's all his pulse and respiration is just going down all the time he said call daddy he said oh yes that's the way to do it that's it call daddy now doing this doesn't mean that you won't answer a call when the person is ready to repent you have to answer that call right but but it'll you'll know if the person is really repentant they're ready they're ready i believe you'll know that and and so his daddy ran out to the hospital real quick to see him he said daddy i can't now he said but god hears my words he said i'll make everything right so he's laying on the hospital but he said but as soon as i can i'll make everything right i'll make it right yes i will yes sir brother right then his respiration began to come back to normal the following sunday he was up before the church he said i have sinned before god in the presence of this church he said i refuse to hear the pastor's words i refuse to hear the deacon he said i'm asking this church to forgive me for the evil that i've done like that he said god has spared my life i tell you he lined up right he said yeah he said that's what you got to do see he said see if you'll just do it god's way and good things will come from it but we've left this off and we want to come over here and just talk about it amongst themselves and a bunch of preachers decide what to do about it or a bunch of other people decide what to do that's not what he said brother branham even addresses that he said it's the nominational way he said for the board to get together and say we're going to deal with it that's not how it's dealt with we deal with it according to the scripture as much as we can brother branham it's interesting i couldn't find where he actually did this except one time and it's the time it's not sexual sin that caused him to do it it was when they made him god when they made brother branham god brother brown that sunday put him on notice and then the next sunday he told the church he said i put him on notice last week and he references this scripture turn them over to the devil that if they didn't repent and he said that week they come and repent you wonder how many of them repented but at least the ones that he had in his mind had repented and come to god but but he uses this scripture that's when he used it why because idolatry and fornication are tied together right and so it's the same it's the same spirit but now when you follow the word when i follow the word god will work on the individual we have to trust god to do that let god work sometimes it takes time for a year paul dealt with this corinthian church he he sent a letter and he sent timothy and then he sends titus and all this time this is going on we don't know paul doesn't tell us what happens exactly to the man other than that he repents we don't know how many hours he spent fighting it or how many days or whether he repented immediately we don't know we don't know how much of that year that it took for him to repent but we know by the next time paul wrote something had happened god kept his word and so in second corinthians 2 and 6 i love the way paul writes this because there's a balance to everything so he wrote about what they should do and then in ii corinthians 2 6 he writes back and he says sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many and and what that means is if you go back and look at the original it not everybody did it but enough people did it to make it effective what that means is that they just cut him off enough people did it to make it effective but somehow they knew he had repented i'm so glad that god still has a way of bringing us to repentance may not be exactly this way but there's some way that god will bring us to repentance second corinthians 7 11 says for behold this self same thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort now paul is speaking to the entire church but i think it's applicable to the man in question as well he said when i sent you this letter before you sorrowed after a godly sort he said what carefulness it wrought and you yay what clearing of yourselves yay what indignation yeah what fear yeah what vehement desire yay what zeal yeah what revenge in all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter huh they did good they did good why they were real christians just wrong-headed because they didn't do it as you know we we try to deal with things when it comes out but they didn't deal with it and a lot of people would write them all and say well they must not even be a real church no they didn't deal with it but when paul exposed them on it they did better late than never right there's attributes of godly sorrow look at the things paul talks about carefulness diligence to obey to the letter what paul had told them to do clearing which is self-vindication they were willing to prove that they were going to do what paul taught them to do and it also means full confession clearing what he said what what clearing of yourselves indignation is hatred of that sin you've known people probably who were smokers or alcoholics and they get to where they hate that because that's what they that's what they dealt with and so he said you have to have a hatred of that sin a fear a fear of repeating that sin or of it happening again as i've said never again there has to be a fear of that a vehement desire a desire to make things right a zeal to follow the word and revenge which is a bad word now and the old english word revenge didn't mean what it means today it meant justice justice to the offended parties they made sure everybody was made was made whole it's important you don't get just to mess with people's lives and then just just move on say well i'm sorry there has to be justice and god will see that it will be done in the right way now what that meant probably for this man was he had to give up his father his father's wife he couldn't do that anymore and he had to prove that he wasn't doing it anymore and when the people saw the depth of his sincerity paul said don't don't leave him don't hang him out there to dry and so in verse 7 of second corinthians 2 paul says so that contrary-wise you ought rather to forgive him and comfort him unless perhaps such a one would be swallowed up with over much sorrow see paul is dealing with people not robots we deal with people not robots that's why sometimes you get offended when i say something sometimes i get offended too you know you know a preacher has to be careful not to get offended by the way people look when he preaches but daryl told me he's preaching somewhere one time he knew the people wasn't going to agree with what he was going to say and he said that scripture just dropped in his heart don't be afraid of their faces it's hard you you have to you know you have to not be offended but but now we're dealing with people we're not dealing with a bunch of robots or machines we do have feelings but we come back to the word so verse 8 says wherefore i beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him let him know that you love him after repentance there's a time for this let him know now that you love him because you see what clearing what how the church has just made this right and he's made it right now go confirm your love toward him after repentance make sure he knows that you love him be sure that he shows fruits of repentance but when he does don't hold a grudge he said for this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things not just in getting rid of the sin but in bringing back the center but there's again there's a time for that don't don't push it because when you do what happens is you end up making twofold a child of hell because you proselyte somebody back into the church verse 10 to whom forgive to whom ye forgive anything i forgive also for if i forgave anything to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i had so he said i didn't do it for the sake of the man that i didn't just do it unilaterally for the sake he said but because the church forgave him i forgave him and i did that in the person of christ you're in the stead of christ in the place of christ that's the place we stand in today is the body of christ verse 11 he said lest satan should get an advantage of us for not we are not ignorant of his devices if you can't can't get you to be complicit with the sin he'll try to get you to hate somebody he'll try to get you to hold a grudge against somebody see if we do things god's way god will work on the sinner don't don't just hold it in your heart and say well i won't ever talk about it i won't ever will never go to the person about it you shouldn't talk about anybody else but go to the person until you've been to that person you don't have a right to talk about it to anybody else that's what the bible says now we need god's forgiveness don't we musicians go ahead and come the bible says if we don't forgive god won't forgive us and as individuals we do not wait god showed this to me one time and i've never forgotten it as individuals we do not wait for someone to repent to forgive them as individuals we don't wait i'm sticking my finger up there like perry green are reminding myself but he would do forgive me lord but as individuals we we have to forgive when you stand praying forgive no matter what the person does you forgive right as a church he says there's a time when you let them make sure they've filmed proof of repentance fruits of repentance before you forgive them as a church as a body does that make sense as an individual i have to forgive don't keep pulling the bell and letting the grudge sit there because as long as you let it sit there it's not going to damage the person it's going to damage you it's going to destroy you until that's you're consumed by it i've seen ministries destroyed by it i've seen people destroyed by it'll end up destroying your own testimony look at the grace of god that god shows us in this chapter isn't that wonderful here's a man who does so many bad things but god says i'm going to save him i'm going to save him that's grace let's bow our heads together you just play something softly heavenly father we love you tonight and we're so grateful for your grace lord there's a song i believe that says there's nothing greater than grace think of the way paul puts it in the visions he said with that great love wherewith he hath loved us so thankful for that love tonight lord so thankful that the times that i failed privately and publicly maybe not in a big way but just the little things you didn't just throw me away lord [Music] but you maybe made things a little hard on me until i repented it's the way you do lord you have a way of correcting us you don't punish us because but you correct us it causes us to go through the judgment seat here so we don't have to go through it there lord i wouldn't want to stand on that day is your prophet told the story of the man of the evangelist who stood there and the great light that voice spoke and said have you ever told a lie i said i thought i'd been pretty truthful but as i stood there under that great light i realized i'd told a lie i thought that i'd been pretty honest that have you ever stolen but he said i realized i'd stolen god's time and i was about to he thought i was about to hear his voice saying go away into the into the depths go into hell and all of a sudden he said the sweetest voice that i ever heard father on earth he stood for me i'm standing for him lord we believe you've stood for us help us to take advantage of that grace lord help us lord we we wouldn't want to do anything to bring a reproach on your word lord but help us to take advantage of grace when it's offered god we look at this world that we live in today look at the signs of the time all around us and this church ought to be full of people lord speaking grace [Music] we live in an hour when people are hardened lost touch with what it's like to know that they're a sinner lord may it never be so with us but may we have that assurance lord if the devil gets to beating us up and going in our minds and telling us you're not a christian you're not saved may we come back to the word and say lord i know that you saved me i know that you bought me and you didn't buy me to lose me i was yours before the foundation of the world it was in your mind and i believe lord you wouldn't have done this for me just to lose me may it be so in every one of our hearts give us confidence and assurance lord and also such a great sense of what you've done for us so we were sinners in the flesh lord we're still sinners every one of us but we rely on your grace lord we thank you for the sweet spirit that we felt tonight and i pray god that you would just move in every heart those that are watching lord i don't know what else to do i think of those that are sick tonight lord and and you know god why we've had to go through this but i believe you're still lord our healer jehovah our healer you're still the same god that the serpent when the plague of serpents come bit them lord that they could look and live may we look at your grace today and live naturally and spiritually under that dual atonement i pray you'd grant it lord we need you lord more than we ever have may we be conscious of that lord help us to be conscious of that i don't know lord i just feel such a such a burden of my heart lord i i pray god won't you won't you just come in this time and revive your work in the midst of the years we know there won't be a worldwide revival lord but we need you to move in our midst won't you just move supernaturally lord in every home lord anything that's not right we want it gone we want it out lord we want you to move in our midst anything lord we want to have an open heart an open book lord just you could go in any door and there'd be nothing there lord if there's any pride any lack of humility god take it out of us help us to reach out lord to be ones that can love follow the word and do what the word says but still have that love in our heart i pray and grant it now i pray for caleb and his family tonight lord and the situation that they're in you know i've been in that situation where it's hard to find a place to stay i pray god that you just reach out maybe they've already found a place but lord i pray they're still on the road that you just helped them lord lord to each one that's here we know there's not a day goes by something life-changing could happen we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know if we'll ever see one another again but until that day comes may we love each other like we never have before i pray you grant it now your body is your church lord we we believe you we trust you it's your bride we love you in jesus name we thank you amen amen let's stand together isn't the lord good to us please thank you lord my soul sing it to him and just worship him one moment before we go oh my rest is [Music] my [Music] my soul
