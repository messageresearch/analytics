[48:05] to see some of the folks from Christian

[48:09] here enjoyed that song sister Grace I
[48:12] didn't realize your brother was such a
[48:14] good piano player but my goodness he is
[48:16] he is really becoming a good pianist so
[48:19] that's that's wonderful me Acts chapter
[48:21] 20 and verse 19 serving the Lord with
[48:23] all humility of mind and with many tears
[48:26] and Temptations which befell me by the
[48:28] lying in weight of the Jews and how I
[48:31] kept back nothing that was profitable
[48:33] unto you but have showed you and have
[48:35] taught you publicly and from house to
[48:38] house 21 testifying both to the Jews and
[48:40] also to the Greeks repentance towards
[48:42] God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus
[48:44] Christ and now behold I go Bound in the
[48:47] spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the
[48:48] things that shall befall me there save
[48:51] that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every
[48:53] city St saying that bonds and
[48:55] afflictions abide me and I like this
[48:57] verse and we want to kind of dwell here
[48:59] today but none of these things move me
[49:02] neither count I my life dear un myself
[49:05] so that I might finish my course with
[49:07] joy and the ministry which I have
[49:09] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[49:11] the gospel of the grace of God you may
[49:14] be seated may the Lord add His blessings
[49:16] to the reading this morning if I could
[49:18] title this sermon this morning I would
[49:21] like to ask a question what is our
[49:24] absolute our absolute
[49:27] and so with that in mind I was taking
[49:30] this scripture here brother Brandon
[49:32] preaches several sermons on an absolute
[49:34] an absolute a absolute absolute I think
[49:36] there might be four actually or five of
[49:39] those sermons that he preaches and I've
[49:41] went through several of them to kind of
[49:43] get an idea of what was brother
[49:45] branham's absolute because many today in
[49:48] the message will say things like brother
[49:49] brandham is my absolute they'll say the
[49:51] message my is my absolute and you may
[49:53] even have someone say my pastor is my
[49:55] absolute' and maybe you would even have
[49:58] someone say that um my boss is my
[50:01] absolute there's all kinds of absolutes
[50:03] everyone has an absolute how many knows
[50:05] that to be true all right wake up and
[50:07] help me out if you
[50:09] can so we all have an absolute and every
[50:12] one of us are subject or we we we have
[50:16] something above us we are not the final
[50:18] say in anything and if you're looking to
[50:20] a man to be your absolute I would say
[50:22] you're looking at uh you're looking at
[50:24] at a at a at a something that can fail
[50:27] you because at the end of the day a
[50:29] human being as your absolute is not
[50:30] going to it's just not going to work out
[50:33] long term because that man will fail you
[50:35] in some way I don't care how good he is
[50:36] I don't care if he's a prophet I don't
[50:38] care who he is that man will fail you if
[50:40] he is your absolute now we'll get to
[50:43] something and stay with me if I lose you
[50:45] on that just stay with me we'll get
[50:47] we'll get around to uh maybe you'll
[50:49] agree with me when he says it himself
[50:51] now uh brother brandom says this to lay
[50:53] a foundation he calls it his foundation
[50:55] in one of the absolute sermons so I'm
[50:56] going to try to go through it just a
[50:57] little bit and he says now absolutes
[51:00] we're talking absolute you know our
[51:01] Supreme Court is an absolute we all know
[51:04] that just as a natural absolute if uh
[51:07] you can run a bill by Congress you can
[51:08] run a bill by the Senate you can run a
[51:10] bill you can have everything passed and
[51:12] then of course there's an absolute for
[51:14] that it's got to go to the president's
[51:15] desk and uh our president wouldn't know
[51:17] if he signed it or not but uh if it made
[51:19] it to his desk at least it would be in
[51:21] the front of an absolute the facts are
[51:23] that man is still an
[51:25] absolute and so uh and the next one will
[51:28] be an absolute and he'll make mistakes
[51:30] why because he's a man that's right and
[51:32] so I don't care who you put in there
[51:33] there'll be an absolute that has to make
[51:34] decisions and the decision they make may
[51:37] not be the right decision so your
[51:40] absolute that you're putting all your
[51:41] trust in could actually make a mistake
[51:44] is that okay so that's just in the
[51:47] natural so brother Brandon would go on
[51:48] down he said but there's an absolute
[51:49] certainly is why that's our nation is
[51:52] tied to that he said when that Supreme
[51:54] Court finally makes their final decision
[51:56] that's it there's no further where you
[51:58] going to go after that he said you're
[51:59] going to follow their decision and
[52:00] that's all you've got to they're the
[52:02] last word they're the amen he calls it
[52:06] and so we find that that's just the
[52:08] truth and so many times you'll see
[52:10] something that'll be real controversial
[52:12] it'll go through a court a lower court
[52:13] and then it'll go to the higher courts
[52:14] then finally it'll end up in the Supreme
[52:16] Court and then they have to make a
[52:18] decision on that you don't always agree
[52:20] with their decisions but there's a group
[52:22] on there and they the majority rules and
[52:24] and it's the same way in church you know
[52:26] there's a reason we had church today
[52:28] because of the majority of the deacon
[52:29] board says we're going to have church
[52:30] today and so when they say that that's
[52:32] the absolute and so me or nobody else
[52:35] can change that and so what we do is we
[52:37] have to have that listen church we have
[52:39] to have an authority we have to submit
[52:42] ourselves to an authority and I I don't
[52:44] mean to go slow this morning but I want
[52:45] to get this in and then I'll try to
[52:46] preach to you is that okay and so we
[52:49] have to have an authority if we don't
[52:50] have an authority on something then
[52:52] there's no Authority on the way we dress
[52:54] then there's no Authority on the way we
[52:55] have church and there's no Authority on
[52:57] the way we have Sunday school there's no
[52:59] Authority on the way that we preach the
[53:00] gospel there has to be an authority on
[53:02] all these things and we call that an
[53:05] absolute and so brother Rand would go on
[53:07] and he said we have to have an absolute
[53:09] everybody has to have one you got one
[53:11] but what I'm trying to tell you he said
[53:13] to background here and show you what
[53:15] absolutes are he said now the nation's
[53:18] Supreme Court is the nation's absolute
[53:20] that's the last thing any kind of a fuss
[53:21] they settle it what they say that's it
[53:23] there is an absolute at a ball game
[53:26] anybody ever been to a ball
[53:27] game nobody puts their hands up that's
[53:29] funny some of y'all been to ball games
[53:32] and if you've been to a ball game all
[53:34] the kids back there are being honest and
[53:36] so if you've been to an a ball game if
[53:38] you go to a baseball game you have an
[53:39] Umpire brother brandom calls them an
[53:41] Empire but they're an Umpire so you go
[53:43] to you go to a ball game and there's an
[53:45] Umpire and I guarantee you if your
[53:47] favorite team has a call go against them
[53:49] you disagree with the Umpire but if it's
[53:51] a call in favor of your team you don't
[53:54] seem to care what the Umpire says he's
[53:57] your absolute then we believe he's our
[54:00] absolute listen to what the Umpire says
[54:02] why because it's in your favor and it's
[54:04] a lot easier to agree with the absolute
[54:08] when it's something you
[54:10] like right it's a whole lot easier to
[54:13] agree with an absolute when they are
[54:14] judging in your favor so if if your
[54:17] favorite ball team is still playing and
[54:20] the referees if they're maybe they're
[54:22] paid off if they're reing the Chiefs and
[54:25] so they
[54:27] sorry had to throw that in there to see
[54:29] if brother Ben's watching but they uh
[54:32] they if your referees usually if you're
[54:35] on the opposing team then you're going
[54:37] to complain about the
[54:38] refs I do nobody else okay I don't watch
[54:43] football but yeah sometimes but you know
[54:46] basketball gamees the same way you know
[54:48] they they could they could they could
[54:50] rule something that's absolutely you're
[54:51] sitting there on on watching on TV or in
[54:54] the game and oh that man is he he's just
[54:56] not right it doesn't really matter what
[54:57] you think sitting in the top in the
[54:59] bleachers because what the absolute says
[55:02] goes now I'm trying to build a
[55:04] foundation here I hope this is okay but
[55:07] brother Brandon would talk about the
[55:08] Umpire of the ball game he said now he
[55:10] said sometimes we don't like his
[55:11] decision either but it's that way anyhow
[55:14] the Umpire his decision is the final
[55:16] word that's right no brother Ben said
[55:19] that may be false teaching sorry he said
[55:21] there is an absolute at a ball game
[55:23] that's the Umpire he said oh yeah some
[55:26] sometimes we don't like his decision
[55:28] either but anyhow the Umpire his
[55:30] decision is the final word that's right
[55:32] no matter what others says if it's a
[55:34] strike it's a strike whatever the Umpire
[55:37] says goes now he also has a boss and I
[55:40] think they put him up in New York or
[55:41] somewhere in an office and then they're
[55:43] also they have a replay review or
[55:45] whatever they've got now and they've
[55:46] messed the game up because they've tried
[55:48] to take the absolute away from the
[55:49] absolute and so then they have somebody
[55:51] else that tries to correct the absolute
[55:53] and it's just a never ending cycle but
[55:55] somebody has the final word I hope
[55:57] you're with me so far I I just want to
[55:59] lay this in here real simple and then
[56:01] we'll go somewhere else he said now
[56:02] there is an absolute now he said that's
[56:04] right certainly no matter what others
[56:06] say that that that don't have nothing to
[56:08] do with it so if you're at a ball game
[56:09] and you get mad at the Umpire or you get
[56:11] mad at the referee and you're up there
[56:14] screaming and and and acting a fool uh
[56:17] get kicked out of the game or something
[56:19] like that the facts are you just don't
[56:21] have no thought
[56:23] coming and you can scream you can yell
[56:25] and it's not going to change mind if
[56:26] anything you're going to make them mad
[56:27] and they might throw you out and they
[56:29] have the authority to do that brother
[56:31] brandom goes on and he says no matter
[56:33] what the others say and he says I don't
[56:35] go to ball games but just happen to jot
[56:37] that down an Umpire he's the absolute at
[56:39] the ball game one of them say that was a
[56:41] ball the other one say you're a liar
[56:43] just imagine and he said this is that
[56:45] way and you ought to be this way and the
[56:47] Umpire said strike see the rest of them
[56:48] take their seat and sit down it gripes
[56:51] them some but I imagine they'd Boo at
[56:53] him there down in their heart and things
[56:54] but it's a strike anyhow why he's the
[56:57] final word and the first baseman said
[56:59] you know that that passed and the other
[57:00] one say you know he said that's this and
[57:02] that's that it's that's a strike and he
[57:03] said well shut up then go back to your
[57:06] place what if there wasn't an Umpire at
[57:08] a ball game what if there wasn't an
[57:10] absolute if there was no absolute he
[57:13] said he said you'd have one another
[57:15] you're a liar and there'd be a fuss and
[57:17] he said to have a ball game you've got
[57:18] to have an absolute and he walks out
[57:20] there and no matter if you don't like
[57:21] him or what he's the absolute anyhow he
[57:24] is the absolute his word is f no matter
[57:27] what you say about it it's that way now
[57:29] he said if they didn't the whole game
[57:31] would go into chaos is that right now I
[57:33] want you to just think spiritual for a
[57:35] moment if we didn't have an absolute
[57:37] what would we have what would we tie
[57:39] ourselves to this morning what would we
[57:41] even think or what would we believe what
[57:43] would we you know every every group I
[57:45] would just like to say it like this
[57:46] every denomination has an absolute and
[57:49] some of them are some of them are all
[57:50] different things and you might have a
[57:52] you might have a group of men that's an
[57:53] absolute for this group and the majority
[57:55] of those men would vote a certain way
[57:56] and then all their preachers have to
[57:58] dress a certain way or act a certain way
[57:59] or say a certain thing or have to go to
[58:01] Seminary so long and all these things
[58:03] and you just think about it everyone's
[58:05] got an absolute and everyone even if
[58:07] they say well I don't have an absolute
[58:08] I'm just living my own life well you've
[58:09] got an absolute and so everyone's got
[58:12] one every church every denomination
[58:14] every message
[58:16] church every message person every mother
[58:19] every father every child everyone has an
[58:23] absolute and so brother brandham goes on
[58:25] down he said You' got to have somebody
[58:28] that the game is tied to and that's the
[58:30] Umpire he says when it's strike it's
[58:32] strike if he says ball it's ball
[58:33] whatever he says it goes that's it and
[58:36] if you didn't you wouldn't have no game
[58:38] he said let me show you another absolute
[58:40] is the red light aren't you glad for red
[58:42] lights and he said when it says stop it
[58:45] means stop now I wonder how many times
[58:47] we look at a red light and we just get
[58:49] irritated that it's there because it
[58:50] seems like there's no purpose but if you
[58:52] take it away you know before they put it
[58:55] there they probably thought there's a
[58:56] reason for the red light and I know
[58:58] there's a stop sign in there yall know
[59:01] what I'm talking about there's a stop
[59:03] sign in there that has no
[59:05] purpose and we'll just leave it there
[59:08] but somebody that had an absolute right
[59:10] to put it there put it there and now if
[59:13] you run that stoplight they can still
[59:14] give you a ticket or stop sign they can
[59:16] still give you a ticket why because they
[59:18] have an absolute right to do it because
[59:19] somebody had an absolute right to put
[59:21] the stop sign in a stupid
[59:23] place you can argue with the cop but
[59:25] he'd say there's a stop sign there and
[59:27] that's an absolute and you got to stop
[59:30] brother Brandon would go on down I know
[59:31] this is really simple and some of you
[59:33] are bored to death already and that's
[59:35] okay because we're going to get
[59:36] somewhere he said what kind of a city
[59:39] would it be without stop lights it's got
[59:41] to have an absolute I don't care what
[59:43] the policeman said or anybody else said
[59:45] standing there they're secondary if
[59:47] somebody can prove that you went through
[59:48] on a green light I don't care what the
[59:50] policeman said they're wrong when the
[59:52] light said go that means go that's an
[59:53] absolute you can prove that and the
[59:55] light said go go the policeman might
[59:56] have been standing somewhere the mayor
[59:58] of the city might have been standing
[59:59] there and said you had to stop but they
[1:00:02] don't have any authority over the
[1:00:04] stoplight right now he said he said you
[1:00:08] might have somebody out there saying hey
[1:00:10] get out of the way I'm in a hurry I got
[1:00:11] to go to work I'm late now I'm going
[1:00:13] through now the other one said you just
[1:00:14] think you are because I'm the one that's
[1:00:16] going this is without a stoplight and he
[1:00:18] said you just have everywhere he said
[1:00:20] you'd have a woman get out and fix her
[1:00:22] hair what if we didn't have a red light
[1:00:25] can you just imagine now I've seen them
[1:00:27] set at a red light and and I don't know
[1:00:29] what they're doing but they pull their
[1:00:30] mirror down and they're doing something
[1:00:32] when they're fixing their makeup or
[1:00:33] whatever it is and it turns green and
[1:00:35] you sit there for a few seconds before
[1:00:37] you decide you better honk the horn and
[1:00:39] you get you get irritated anybody ever
[1:00:41] done that anybody ever done that on the
[1:00:43] way to
[1:00:44] church not just me all right Pentecostal
[1:00:48] cussing or cursing or whatever they call
[1:00:50] it but you honk your horn at them
[1:00:52] because they're sitting there and
[1:00:53] they're distracted some people get on
[1:00:54] their phone and they get distracted but
[1:00:55] when the light says go you go and the
[1:00:57] people behind you have a right to honk
[1:00:58] their horn at you if you didn't
[1:01:01] go and so he said let's go brother he
[1:01:03] said he said you go on down here he said
[1:01:05] that's far enough he said when the
[1:01:06] stoplight says stop that's stop that's
[1:01:08] right he said then where where are where
[1:01:10] we are based upon is that word not on
[1:01:12] what some bunch of men said or some
[1:01:14] other bunch of men said Jesus said these
[1:01:16] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:01:18] let's go into all the world preach the
[1:01:19] gospel to Every Creature he said you
[1:01:21] know as good as education is but Jesus
[1:01:23] never required that he said as good as
[1:01:26] churches are buildings he never required
[1:01:27] that as good as hospitals was he was he
[1:01:29] said the the churches build hospitals
[1:01:31] that was right that's all right he said
[1:01:33] we appreciate that but he never required
[1:01:35] it and he said to the church preach the
[1:01:37] gospel that's an
[1:01:38] absolute he said the gospel came not in
[1:01:40] word only but through some p through
[1:01:42] Power and manifestation of the word and
[1:01:44] Paul said then go manifest the gospel he
[1:01:46] said oh my if it was that way what are
[1:01:48] we today living in a time when we got
[1:01:50] the best doctors we ever had we got the
[1:01:52] best drugs we ever practiced with he
[1:01:54] said you know that we salute those men
[1:01:56] we pray for them he said and I do and I
[1:01:58] hope you do those men who with their
[1:02:00] understanding or feeling they got two
[1:02:02] senses to work by and that's seeing and
[1:02:04] feeling and he said and and then they
[1:02:06] have hearing and he said they work by a
[1:02:08] sound of a heart or a feeling of a tumor
[1:02:10] or something or the sight of something
[1:02:12] they can see the spread of a disease or
[1:02:14] something on the face that's covering
[1:02:15] the face or the body somewhere and they
[1:02:17] work upon these things he said why
[1:02:19] because they try to take medicines and
[1:02:22] so much that it will kill it and he said
[1:02:24] and then it won't kill you and so forth
[1:02:26] and that's their business to work on
[1:02:28] that and we appreciate that that's very
[1:02:29] fine but we got the best doctors the
[1:02:31] best medicine the best hospitals and
[1:02:33] more sickness than we ever had and he
[1:02:35] said we got more unbelief than we ever
[1:02:38] had he said yes sir exactly ministers
[1:02:40] has organized themselves and got great
[1:02:42] denominations and taking and anything
[1:02:44] and so forth and just anything making
[1:02:47] the church he said he said making a
[1:02:49] church member and they went over to some
[1:02:51] Seminary like an incubator chicken and
[1:02:54] hatch them out by a grinder and brings
[1:02:55] him out like that and he said and
[1:02:57] sometimes know no more about God than a
[1:02:59] hot and tot does about Egyptian night
[1:03:01] and brings him through like that and
[1:03:03] there you are see he said oh what we
[1:03:05] need in our churches is a man that's got
[1:03:07] an absolute and I would say what we need
[1:03:10] this morning is not someone who is
[1:03:12] tossed to and fro by every wind of
[1:03:14] Doctrine but you can have an absolute
[1:03:16] and so this morning if you have an
[1:03:18] absolute you can point to the absolute
[1:03:20] and you can say it doesn't matter how I
[1:03:21] feel it doesn't matter what I think but
[1:03:23] I'm pointing to an absolute and so this
[1:03:25] morning if you've been diagnosed with
[1:03:27] cancer we have an absolute that says by
[1:03:29] his stripes we are healed amen if the
[1:03:32] doctor has told you you couldn't have
[1:03:33] children sister Millie you can point to
[1:03:35] an absolute that says all things are
[1:03:37] possible to them that believe and I
[1:03:39] would like to say this morning if you
[1:03:41] can have faith in God then your absolute
[1:03:43] is in the word of God and everything he
[1:03:45] says is your
[1:03:48] absolute we don't need an absolute that
[1:03:50] tries to put gloom and doom over our
[1:03:52] lives we need an absolute that will show
[1:03:53] the promises over the church we we don't
[1:03:55] need an absolute that tries to tell us
[1:03:57] that we don't need to go to church
[1:03:58] anymore because the Bible said that we
[1:04:01] must assemble ourselves together and
[1:04:03] that much more as we see the day
[1:04:04] approaching so what is our absolute what
[1:04:06] a man said or what the word said and so
[1:04:08] if a man would come or an angel from
[1:04:10] heaven would come and say something to
[1:04:12] you that would be outside of the word
[1:04:14] then you can let him be a cursed and let
[1:04:15] the word be your absolute amen so what
[1:04:18] is our absolute today we've had all
[1:04:20] kinds of absolutes come through in our
[1:04:22] day and try to tell you that uh that
[1:04:24] that there's a coming that there's a the
[1:04:25] coming of a prophet that's going to
[1:04:27] return and he's going to come back in a
[1:04:28] tent and he's going to preach the
[1:04:29] Mysteries but what did the Bible say
[1:04:31] about it in the days of the voice of the
[1:04:33] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:04:35] sound the mysteries of God would be
[1:04:37] finished and if the absolute says it
[1:04:39] then I believe what the absolute says I
[1:04:41] don't care what nobody else tries to
[1:04:43] tell me I believe my absolute is the
[1:04:46] word of God and so if someone tries to
[1:04:48] tell you there's a new way to have
[1:04:49] church I can point you back to a prophet
[1:04:52] and say that the message of the hour is
[1:04:54] my absolute amen somebody else could say
[1:04:56] well my absolute is not the message well
[1:04:58] the messenger's absolute was the word of
[1:05:00] God and if he said what Paul said then
[1:05:03] I'm okay saying with what he said why
[1:05:05] because what he said I'm going to hold
[1:05:07] to it because what he said is exactly
[1:05:09] what Paul taught and I'm resting on that
[1:05:12] because I'm in The Bride of Jesus
[1:05:15] Christ now he said if you in your life
[1:05:17] if you have an absolute you do things
[1:05:19] ordinarily you would not do because
[1:05:22] you're led by seeing feeling and
[1:05:26] believing and you're and you've got
[1:05:28] touch you've got sight you've got all
[1:05:29] these things that you're led by and you
[1:05:32] have to be led by something but really
[1:05:34] you have an ultimate so you could see
[1:05:36] something doesn't mean that it's right
[1:05:38] you could feel something but doesn't
[1:05:39] mean that it's right you could even uh
[1:05:42] you could even look at the word in the
[1:05:43] Bible and look through of eyes that have
[1:05:45] been bound or eyes that have not been
[1:05:47] opened and you could actually look at
[1:05:49] the word many people do in this day and
[1:05:52] you could actually have people that
[1:05:53] could look at this same Bible you look
[1:05:55] at and and believe that we should be
[1:05:56] baptized in the name of father and the
[1:05:58] son of the Holy Ghost and you they could
[1:05:59] read the same words you did what is it
[1:06:02] it is that their eyes have not been open
[1:06:04] so they don't actually have an absolute
[1:06:06] but their absolute is what a church told
[1:06:08] them the Bible
[1:06:10] meant but they don't have an absolute in
[1:06:12] the word itself they can't look to the
[1:06:14] word and say my denomination's wrong
[1:06:16] they can't look to the word and say my
[1:06:17] church is wrong listen your pastor is
[1:06:19] not your absolute I am not your absolute
[1:06:22] the deacons they're an absolute in some
[1:06:24] ways there's decision they make that are
[1:06:26] absolute but they are not your absolute
[1:06:28] when it comes to the word and man I
[1:06:30] could disagree with the deacons
[1:06:31] doctrinally and that doesn't mean I'm
[1:06:32] right and it doesn't mean they're right
[1:06:34] but what is right is the word is that
[1:06:37] okay and so you can have an absolute and
[1:06:39] you could be wrong in your
[1:06:42] absolute
[1:06:44] absolutely my background would say
[1:06:47] brother randoms are absolute and if he
[1:06:49] walked across the street a certain way
[1:06:51] we had to walk across the street a
[1:06:53] certain way if he hunted with a certain
[1:06:55] gun
[1:06:56] you had to hunt with a certain
[1:06:58] gun y'all got real quiet some of you in
[1:07:01] here they may be watching I don't
[1:07:05] care some people will elevate a man to
[1:07:09] status of
[1:07:10] absolute and while I respect the man and
[1:07:14] I'll follow the man's opinions over your
[1:07:16] opinion or my opinion he was a
[1:07:20] man that's and you don't ever make a man
[1:07:24] your absolute amen
[1:07:26] but I want to show you something that
[1:07:27] John many Look to Him and they would
[1:07:30] look to John and they would say well are
[1:07:32] you not the Messiah are you not the one
[1:07:34] that was to come no I'm just one here
[1:07:36] standing pointing to the one is to come
[1:07:39] and so he was not the Christ he was not
[1:07:42] the Messiah but he was pointing to an
[1:07:45] absolute and so I want to just point you
[1:07:47] to a man who said it's not me it's him
[1:07:52] it's not me doing the works but it's the
[1:07:53] one standing right here with me on the
[1:07:55] form now he's the one doing the works
[1:07:57] listen Church we're not following a man
[1:07:59] that said look to me as your absolute
[1:08:01] he's look he said look to me and follow
[1:08:03] me as I follow Christ and he he said
[1:08:06] look to me as your brother I'm your
[1:08:07] brother I don't have any power I don't
[1:08:09] have any Authority but he is the one
[1:08:11] that's got to come down and do these
[1:08:13] things brother brandom didn't have no
[1:08:14] right to heal you but he was standing in
[1:08:16] the presence of the one who had the full
[1:08:18] authority to heal you and I want to just
[1:08:20] go ahead and tell you today I don't have
[1:08:22] the authority to pray for you I don't
[1:08:23] have the authority to heal you but if
[1:08:25] he's here and I can lay my hands on the
[1:08:27] sick according to my absolute and you
[1:08:29] can be healed I have an absolute he had
[1:08:32] an absolute the word is our
[1:08:37] absolute right I don't have a problem
[1:08:39] with saying the message is my
[1:08:41] absolute right but I do have a problem
[1:08:44] when you say that the messenger is your
[1:08:46] absolute and you deny what the messenger
[1:08:49] said because you're elevating a man
[1:08:52] above the message that he brought and
[1:08:55] that is is completely contrary to what
[1:08:56] the messenger
[1:08:58] said I hope this is okay this morning
[1:09:01] I'll get in trouble but that's okay we
[1:09:03] won't be the first
[1:09:04] time brother brandom said especially if
[1:09:06] you have a god- center life he said
[1:09:07] you'll do things ordinarily you would
[1:09:08] not if you have an absolute he said
[1:09:10] especially if you have a god- centered
[1:09:11] life the god- centered life makes a
[1:09:13] person do things that ordinarily they
[1:09:14] would not do very odd peculiar why is a
[1:09:18] Christian life so odd and peculiar is
[1:09:20] because that they are looking to God's
[1:09:22] word which is almost foreign to the
[1:09:25] world today now you you look at a
[1:09:29] message church and you wonder why we
[1:09:30] dress the way we do when we don't
[1:09:32] technically have a book that you come in
[1:09:35] and you sign up and you take a book and
[1:09:37] you say well I'm going to wear dresses
[1:09:38] to church and I'm going to I'm not going
[1:09:40] to wear makeup and I'm not going to do
[1:09:41] this I'm all these you just don't have a
[1:09:43] a list of rules that you get when you
[1:09:45] join the church or come to the
[1:09:47] church and you wonder so why do they all
[1:09:49] dress
[1:09:51] modest because of an absolute that we
[1:09:53] all have
[1:09:55] right and so our absolute if you look in
[1:09:58] the book of Timothy there I believe it's
[1:10:00] first Timothy you talk you look at a
[1:10:02] woman's long hair long dress and and you
[1:10:05] can look at that as your absolute and
[1:10:07] you say well why does the world not
[1:10:08] dress like that if they also say they
[1:10:10] believe the same Bible we do it's
[1:10:12] because the Bible is not their absolute
[1:10:15] it is not their TI poost it is not what
[1:10:17] they're looking to to know how to dress
[1:10:19] what they're looking to is well so and
[1:10:21] so could wear pants I can wear pants so
[1:10:24] and so cut their hair or just trimmed it
[1:10:25] a little bit I can trim mine the Bible
[1:10:27] says you can't what is your
[1:10:32] absolute the Bible says to not wear
[1:10:35] garments that pertain to a man and you
[1:10:37] say well other women do it so your
[1:10:39] absolute becomes someone else instead of
[1:10:42] the
[1:10:43] Bible we don't have to have church
[1:10:44] anymore because our leaders said that we
[1:10:47] can stay home what does the word
[1:10:50] say the Bible tells us if an angel from
[1:10:52] heaven teaches anything different than
[1:10:54] what's already been preach let him be a
[1:10:56] cursed so I would say this morning that
[1:10:59] if there's someone in your life that is
[1:11:00] influencing you take it back to the word
[1:11:03] if it's influencing your dress take it
[1:11:05] back to the word if it's influencing
[1:11:07] your ability to go to church take it
[1:11:09] back to the word amen many men can rise
[1:11:11] up and say this is the truth and that's
[1:11:13] the truth but take it back to the word
[1:11:15] why because that is our absolute and our
[1:11:19] absolute we've got to tie our souls to
[1:11:21] it church we can't look around and say
[1:11:23] well I want to follow so and so I want
[1:11:25] to do what this church does no every
[1:11:27] church is Sovereign every local church
[1:11:28] is Sovereign and there's a reason why
[1:11:30] they do the things that they do they
[1:11:32] have an absolute we have an absolute and
[1:11:35] I want to say this morning it's more
[1:11:37] than my opinion it's more than what I
[1:11:39] see in the scripture but my soul is tied
[1:11:41] to the absolute there's nothing I can do
[1:11:44] to change the way I am because I'm my
[1:11:47] soul so I'm not going to dress according
[1:11:48] to the world I'm not going to get on any
[1:11:50] skinny jeans and that would look really
[1:11:53] bad and look like some sister ified
[1:11:59] Punk the faces on the front row are
[1:12:03] wonderful because my absolute is not the
[1:12:06] trend of the
[1:12:07] world my absolute is not what they're
[1:12:10] the cool kid in school is not your
[1:12:12] absolute the cool kid in school is just
[1:12:15] doing something he saw somebody else do
[1:12:18] and the I mean come on somebody I mean
[1:12:20] you know we're always looking peer
[1:12:21] pressure is a really bad thing sometimes
[1:12:24] because we're looking to PE people to
[1:12:25] know how to
[1:12:27] worship we're looking at people to know
[1:12:29] how to dress we're looking at people to
[1:12:32] know how to attend church well if they
[1:12:34] can miss church I can miss
[1:12:37] church all y'all that are streaming this
[1:12:39] morning I'm not preaching at you because
[1:12:40] you couldn't get out of your
[1:12:42] driveway listen I I I I thank the Lord
[1:12:45] there's people that still have a desire
[1:12:46] to go to church if they didn't why would
[1:12:49] you have a church building and so I do
[1:12:51] thank the Lord for that those that have
[1:12:52] a desire to be in church we have an
[1:12:54] absolute on that
[1:12:56] and my opinion of going to church
[1:12:57] doesn't really matter my opinion of
[1:12:59] going to church won't save
[1:13:01] you uh at times I've been told I'm a
[1:13:03] little bit legalistic on it I am I'll
[1:13:05] admit that I'm a little legalist I was
[1:13:07] raised that way I never miss church
[1:13:08] that's just the way I am but that
[1:13:10] doesn't mean if somebody misses Church
[1:13:11] they're going to hell for it you have an
[1:13:13] absolute I have an absolute and what
[1:13:15] we're doing is lining up to our absolute
[1:13:17] not to each other well brother Joel
[1:13:19] never misses so that puts pressure on me
[1:13:20] to go it doesn't really matter if
[1:13:22] brother Joel never misses somebody said
[1:13:23] amen in the back
[1:13:26] oh let me just go ahead and tell you
[1:13:28] something what I do brother
[1:13:30] Danny sometimes you just don't want to
[1:13:33] do because I am a human and I know you
[1:13:36] all know this by now
[1:13:38] amen everybody knows I'm human everybody
[1:13:41] knows I'm going to make mistakes
[1:13:43] everybody knows your pastor could make a
[1:13:45] mistake everybody knows you could make a
[1:13:47] mistake your husband your wife your
[1:13:50] children all of you are subject to
[1:13:52] mistakes because you're human come on
[1:13:54] now but let me just go ahead and ask you
[1:13:56] the question what about our
[1:13:58] Prophet was he
[1:14:01] human
[1:14:03] so I want to read this quote because I
[1:14:06] think this will put it in perspective
[1:14:07] for you brother Ram said what I'm trying
[1:14:08] to say don't never lose your confidence
[1:14:12] don't let Satan tell you evil about me
[1:14:14] cuz there's
[1:14:16] much is this
[1:14:18] okay he said but you keep that
[1:14:20] confidence CU if you don't it won't
[1:14:22] happen don't look to me as a man I'm a
[1:14:25] man I'm full of mistakes but look to
[1:14:26] what I'm saying about him it's him he is
[1:14:30] the one and so I want you to notice in
[1:14:33] the same quote where he's saying don't
[1:14:35] look to me I'm a man he's also saying
[1:14:37] don't lose your confidence so don't look
[1:14:40] at the mistakes of the man look at the
[1:14:42] word that he brought don't look at the
[1:14:44] mistakes of a man and mean your pastor
[1:14:46] is going to make mistakes your pastor is
[1:14:47] going to make decisions that you're not
[1:14:49] going to like I may make a decision that
[1:14:51] you don't like the deacons might make a
[1:14:53] decision you don't like but you don't
[1:14:54] look look to them as men look to your
[1:14:57] absolute which is the word of God Amen
[1:14:59] look to the message that he brought not
[1:15:01] the messenger the messenger could fail
[1:15:03] you the messenger could tell a lie he
[1:15:05] told us he could the messenger could
[1:15:07] even say things that that you know that
[1:15:09] he would come back and correct himself
[1:15:11] on tape amen he said don't look to me
[1:15:13] Look to Him am right amen so I will say
[1:15:18] today the message is my absolute amen
[1:15:21] the message is my absolute because the
[1:15:23] messenger was man enough to tell me that
[1:15:25] it wasn't him it was Christ amen if he
[1:15:28] would have come and said look at me I'm
[1:15:29] your absolute then I could have looked
[1:15:31] to the scriptures and said prophets
[1:15:33] never acted that way but because he came
[1:15:35] in a humble way because he came in
[1:15:37] humility and said don't look to me I'm
[1:15:40] your brother then I can follow a man
[1:15:41] like that because he is fully
[1:15:43] surrendered and following the word
[1:15:46] himself right so you follow a
[1:15:50] pastor but you don't look at his
[1:15:51] mistakes
[1:15:55] because the minute you start looking at
[1:15:56] the mistakes you'll find a lot of things
[1:15:58] to
[1:16:00] criticize the moment you start looking
[1:16:02] at my mistakes you'll start finding a
[1:16:05] whole lot of things to
[1:16:06] criticize and you might even be right in
[1:16:09] that and I can look at you and we can do
[1:16:11] the same thing we can sit here and have
[1:16:13] a critics Fest to where we just
[1:16:16] criticize each other and we could do
[1:16:18] that all day long and we would never run
[1:16:19] out of content or or or or material to
[1:16:22] work with we would have all day all
[1:16:25] night and into next year and we could
[1:16:26] still be sitting here criticizing each
[1:16:28] other and finding fault with one another
[1:16:30] and we could do that and we could
[1:16:32] probably justify ourselves in doing
[1:16:35] that is that okay the truth is that's
[1:16:39] just that's just the way life is that's
[1:16:41] just the way humans like to act humans
[1:16:45] like to criticize one another but if
[1:16:47] you're looking for for something to
[1:16:49] criticize you'll find something to
[1:16:50] criticize if you came to church this
[1:16:52] morning and you had something in your
[1:16:54] heart against somebody you're going to
[1:16:56] go to church you're not going to get
[1:16:57] nothing out of church you're going to
[1:16:58] sit there with your critical spirit and
[1:17:00] criticize somebody in the church because
[1:17:02] they did something you didn't like and
[1:17:04] let me go ahead and just tell you
[1:17:05] something you did something they didn't
[1:17:09] like but we all have an absolute so my
[1:17:12] absolute may not be brother
[1:17:14] Jared although he may we could we could
[1:17:16] both be going to go do something and he
[1:17:19] could say to do it this way and I could
[1:17:22] say to do it this way and I could think
[1:17:25] there's no way he's right and in the end
[1:17:27] he could be right and I could be wrong
[1:17:30] imagine
[1:17:33] that the truth of it is as a human being
[1:17:35] you're going to make a mistake if you
[1:17:37] haven't already made one
[1:17:40] today and so we find that every one of
[1:17:43] us if I'm looking to brother Stewart as
[1:17:45] my absolute he's going to fail
[1:17:48] me as much as confidence as I have in
[1:17:50] the man he's going to fail me and I can
[1:17:53] look to brother Danny who's been been a
[1:17:55] pillar in the church for a whole long
[1:18:00] time I could look to that man and if I
[1:18:02] followed him around and knew every
[1:18:03] thought knew every action of his entire
[1:18:05] life I could say the man has got a he's
[1:18:07] got
[1:18:09] faults I know you don't believe me but
[1:18:11] it's just true because he's human
[1:18:14] right some of y'all you got these Halos
[1:18:16] on your head and you're like well I
[1:18:17] don't make
[1:18:18] mistakes that's your first mistake
[1:18:22] yeah is this okay
[1:18:25] I have just went completely off the
[1:18:26] rails here but here I
[1:18:29] am so far off my notes Lord help
[1:18:31] me but we all have an absolute brother
[1:18:35] BR stays on this is the messenger the
[1:18:38] messenger your absolute he I I gu
[1:18:40] several quotes on this he says friends
[1:18:42] don't look to me I'm your brother don't
[1:18:43] pay no attention to me because I'm just
[1:18:45] IM mortal I have to die like everybody
[1:18:47] else don't you listen to me but listen
[1:18:49] to what I've
[1:18:52] said what I said is the
[1:18:56] message now there's where I can stand
[1:18:58] and say the message is my
[1:19:00] absolute because a prophet said don't
[1:19:02] look to me don't listen to me but he
[1:19:05] said listen to what I've said what I
[1:19:06] said is the message now I want you to
[1:19:08] notice something there I know this would
[1:19:10] get me in all kinds of trouble Lord help
[1:19:11] me but that don't even mean you've got
[1:19:13] to listen to every jot and tit that he
[1:19:17] said if brother brandom stuttered and
[1:19:18] said and and that was not thus sayeth
[1:19:20] the Lord right right because he was a a
[1:19:24] human yes God took a man that was humble
[1:19:27] God took a man with a a seventh grade
[1:19:30] education and made raised him up to pray
[1:19:32] for kings and monarchs and and he and he
[1:19:35] made him a great man but it wasn't
[1:19:37] because the man was great God made the
[1:19:38] man great God raised him up to be what
[1:19:41] he was see if we ever get our Focus off
[1:19:43] of who he is we start elevating men to
[1:19:46] positions that they're not allowed to be
[1:19:48] in and then the next thing you know we
[1:19:49] start looking at the man and when he
[1:19:50] makes a mistake we fall away why because
[1:19:53] our eyes were looking to something we
[1:19:55] should have never been looking at right
[1:19:57] because a man could fail you in the
[1:19:59] worst possible way a woman can fail you
[1:20:02] in the worst possible way but if you
[1:20:03] look to him he cannot let you
[1:20:07] down your marriage can fail you your
[1:20:09] church can fail you everybody can fail
[1:20:12] you but he can never
[1:20:15] fail right so that's why we don't pay
[1:20:18] any attention he said don't pay any
[1:20:19] attention to the messenger watch the
[1:20:20] message keep your eyes not on the
[1:20:22] messenger but look on the message what
[1:20:25] it said that's the thing to look to now
[1:20:28] what did the message tell us how do you
[1:20:30] know so let's just go there we're
[1:20:32] here if the messenger told us a certain
[1:20:35] way to have tongues and interpretation
[1:20:36] of the
[1:20:37] church that's my absolute your opinion's
[1:20:41] good but that's my
[1:20:43] absolute and and and so I'm going to
[1:20:45] take that over what you think why
[1:20:48] because you weren't
[1:20:49] Vindicated last I checked you didn't
[1:20:51] have a picture with with the angel of
[1:20:53] the Lord over your head
[1:20:55] that's right was it vindicating the man
[1:20:58] or the message right on now that's the
[1:21:01] question it was vindicating a man who
[1:21:04] brought the message so brother Brandon
[1:21:06] would make a statement and I didn't
[1:21:07] bring the quote but I'll just say this
[1:21:09] and you can go look it up he said he
[1:21:11] said the message and the messenger are
[1:21:13] are are one and the same or they're
[1:21:15] always the same he said you can't
[1:21:16] separate the man and the message now
[1:21:19] many people have taken that and they've
[1:21:20] run with it and they've taken it
[1:21:22] completely out of context and they'll
[1:21:24] say that well if the message is my
[1:21:25] absolute then the man's my
[1:21:28] absolute and that's not even what he's
[1:21:30] saying you can't separate the two
[1:21:32] because God predestinated a certain man
[1:21:35] to bring a certain message nobody else
[1:21:37] could bring Paul's message but Paul
[1:21:39] nobody else could bring this message but
[1:21:41] William brandham and so am I looking to
[1:21:43] him yes because he pointed me to
[1:21:48] him this is just really really strong on
[1:21:50] my heart today I wonder if sometimes we
[1:21:53] don't get our eyes I I want to just this
[1:21:55] is kind of why this came to me there's a
[1:21:58] group of people that have or someone has
[1:22:00] has has put a a magazine out and it's
[1:22:03] questioning the message and it's got the
[1:22:04] followers in there and all their
[1:22:06] mistakes and and and listen church if
[1:22:08] you're looking at mistakes in this
[1:22:09] message you're going to find them
[1:22:11] because the message is full of humans
[1:22:16] too the mistakes are not in the word
[1:22:18] it's with the people that's right and so
[1:22:20] when you see these things that are
[1:22:22] criticizing brother Brandon for for for
[1:22:24] l money I I love that one because it's
[1:22:26] just
[1:22:28] stupid the man lived humble he never
[1:22:31] made it about himself he didn't live he
[1:22:33] didn't build a huge Cathedral he didn't
[1:22:35] live in a fancy house he lived
[1:22:37] comfortably but he did not have any more
[1:22:39] than any other minister in the church at
[1:22:41] churches at that time he was not a man
[1:22:43] that that that made himself bigger than
[1:22:45] he
[1:22:46] was and so I love the humility of a
[1:22:49] prophet how about you one of the reasons
[1:22:52] I'm I'm so attracted to the man himself
[1:22:54] is because of his his humility I'm
[1:22:57] attracted to the character of brother
[1:22:59] Brandon because he never made it about
[1:23:02] himself he never pointed to himself and
[1:23:04] so when you see these articles and I
[1:23:06] just want to say this because a lot of
[1:23:07] people read this and they'll be like
[1:23:08] what about the
[1:23:09] message is it is it true are any of them
[1:23:11] things true what about the followers oh
[1:23:13] yeah there's some crazies in this
[1:23:17] message they claim to believe this
[1:23:19] message and they're just they're just
[1:23:21] nut jobs you know they're just crazy and
[1:23:24] and so and you know it it's always been
[1:23:26] that way you do you judge Jesus's
[1:23:28] Ministry by Judas
[1:23:31] no do you judge Moses's Ministry by by
[1:23:35] by all the ones that were there and you
[1:23:37] have Janice and jambus and all the
[1:23:38] impersonators and they're all right
[1:23:40] there and you have the ones even the
[1:23:42] millions that go into the to the desert
[1:23:44] with him and they all start griping and
[1:23:46] complaining and turning their backs and
[1:23:48] they're dying in the wilderness and
[1:23:49] you're like is this the message no the
[1:23:51] message is what the messenger said not
[1:23:54] what the people people were doing listen
[1:23:55] church when you're looking at the people
[1:23:56] you're saying well everybody ought to
[1:23:58] line up to it I have a hard enough time
[1:24:01] myself lining up to it and you do too
[1:24:03] the truth be told the devil fights you
[1:24:06] to live this message the devil tries to
[1:24:08] tell you it doesn't really matter about
[1:24:09] everything that he said but it really
[1:24:11] does matter what he said and somebody
[1:24:14] will line up to the
[1:24:17] message brother brandom said when he had
[1:24:18] a people that were ready to receive it
[1:24:20] he would send that message and it would
[1:24:21] strike that elected seed at that time so
[1:24:24] if the message has come then there's
[1:24:26] somebody here to line up to the
[1:24:29] message brother BR go on he said now
[1:24:31] Brethren I want to ask you something
[1:24:33] ministers not to be different not to be
[1:24:34] mean but to be honest don't you think
[1:24:37] this is a day in all this chaos that
[1:24:39] we're living in that we've got to be
[1:24:40] sure about this thing there's too many
[1:24:42] differences he said and John knew he had
[1:24:45] to be absolutely
[1:24:46] sure so he never went to his father's
[1:24:49] school there's nothing said that he went
[1:24:51] back to learn to be a priest but he went
[1:24:53] to the Wilderness and he was in the
[1:24:54] wilderness until his calling came forth
[1:24:56] and then he come around and the crowds
[1:24:58] was standing there and he was so sure
[1:25:00] that the Messiah was in his day because
[1:25:02] he was the one that was ordained to
[1:25:03] introduce this Messiah because Malachi 3
[1:25:06] said so I'll send my messenger before my
[1:25:08] face and he'll prepare the way John knew
[1:25:10] where he was standing where are you
[1:25:13] standing this morning are you standing
[1:25:15] on the message of the hour or are you
[1:25:17] looking to a man and you'll be tossed
[1:25:19] this way and tossed that way and you'll
[1:25:21] think this way and you'll think that way
[1:25:24] and one one day you believe this way and
[1:25:25] one day you believe that way but if
[1:25:27] you're tied to the message of the hour
[1:25:28] nothing can move you none of these
[1:25:31] things can move
[1:25:33] me no no no thought of death could move
[1:25:36] me from this message no thought of death
[1:25:38] no no thought of Torment could move me
[1:25:40] from this message no no no uh no world
[1:25:42] power that would put a squeeze on me
[1:25:44] could take me from this message why
[1:25:46] because I'm not following a messenger
[1:25:48] I'm following the word that he brought
[1:25:49] nothing can make me doubt this
[1:25:53] message and follow him as he followed
[1:25:56] Christ you say did he ever not no the
[1:25:58] truth is I can look back on his life and
[1:26:00] his message and there were a couple
[1:26:01] times where he said I should have done
[1:26:03] this and I disobeyed God and he
[1:26:07] corrected me for it just imagine a man
[1:26:10] of that status that would be humble
[1:26:12] enough to tell you when he made mistakes
[1:26:15] publicly I can follow that man I'd
[1:26:18] rather follow that man than a man that
[1:26:19] said he never made a
[1:26:20] mistake if he told me he never made a
[1:26:23] mistake then I would know he wasn't a
[1:26:25] prophet because if he said he never made
[1:26:27] him come on somebody you telling me that
[1:26:30] a mortal man that was born in sin shaped
[1:26:32] in iniquity could be
[1:26:34] perfect only by the blood of Jesus
[1:26:36] that's right he was just a moral like
[1:26:39] you and I I know this is hard because
[1:26:41] you know people think well you're
[1:26:42] attacking the
[1:26:43] messenger man there's nobody if you
[1:26:45] could pick one person for me to go sit
[1:26:46] down and have dinner with right now then
[1:26:48] brother brandom nobody I'd rather pick
[1:26:50] why because you talk about a man that
[1:26:53] God used you talk about a humble man you
[1:26:56] talk about a man that was so listen the
[1:26:58] man prayed and he sacrificed his life
[1:27:00] and listen I give honor to the
[1:27:03] man I I I you know I've been where you
[1:27:05] know you walk in places where men have
[1:27:07] walked you go out to Arizona you can go
[1:27:08] to the places where he was at where the
[1:27:10] sword came into his you can do all these
[1:27:11] things and you can go to Jeffersonville
[1:27:13] and walk where he walked and see where
[1:27:14] he preached and all those things that's
[1:27:16] absolutely cool to me amen I love all
[1:27:19] those things that all means something to
[1:27:21] me but brother Brandon would say it like
[1:27:23] this if you had a literal uh a vial with
[1:27:27] the blood of Jesus Christ in it it would
[1:27:30] be
[1:27:31] nothing it would have no power in
[1:27:36] it right the literal blood was nothing
[1:27:39] because you have his spirit in you you
[1:27:42] have more than a literal blood I have
[1:27:45] more than something literally that
[1:27:46] brother brandham
[1:27:47] touched I have more than that I have the
[1:27:50] message that he brought and that's what
[1:27:52] God sent to the church
[1:27:55] you still with me so
[1:27:58] far brother brandom said it like this he
[1:28:00] said John knew he had had to be
[1:28:01] absolutely sure he said uh he was so
[1:28:04] sure that the Messiah was in his day
[1:28:06] because he was the one that was promised
[1:28:08] to come no matter how many priests would
[1:28:09] say you mean to tell me the time we got
[1:28:12] up here and the daily sacrifice will be
[1:28:14] done away with he said there will come a
[1:28:16] time when the Lamb of God will come
[1:28:17] that'll take away the sacrifice standing
[1:28:19] in mud with whiskers over his face that
[1:28:21] you'd run him away from your house today
[1:28:24] I remember a brother one time he stood
[1:28:26] up and he said if John the Baptist come
[1:28:27] and stood in this Pulpit would you
[1:28:28] receive
[1:28:30] him think about that he's got whiskers
[1:28:34] he's got mud no we would
[1:28:37] not he would never get in the back
[1:28:41] door and you know we're a different
[1:28:43] Society so I guess you can figure some
[1:28:45] of that but but he doesn't but but I
[1:28:46] think you could make a point there that
[1:28:48] he doesn't have to be the best
[1:28:50] dressed he doesn't have to be the the
[1:28:53] most well spoken if that's even a phrase
[1:28:57] he doesn't have to be listen God comes
[1:28:59] in humility and he comes in Simplicity
[1:29:02] and he reveals himself the same way God
[1:29:05] is humble God is that is the nature of
[1:29:07] God if you watch how God has always come
[1:29:10] it's always been humility and if you see
[1:29:13] the way God has expressed himself you'll
[1:29:15] know that he's humble I know this is a
[1:29:17] little slow this morning but I want to
[1:29:18] lay this in here just for a moment and
[1:29:20] I've still got a little time left so
[1:29:23] don't run me off yet
[1:29:25] he said God is not in class and glamour
[1:29:28] as we try to put him in and we
[1:29:30] Pentecostal people God is in humility
[1:29:32] the church can say am there he was
[1:29:35] standing watching him and he was
[1:29:36] introducing he said and he was so sure
[1:29:39] that he was there he said there is one
[1:29:41] standing among you who you don't even
[1:29:44] know he said oh my what a rebuke there
[1:29:46] is one among you right now who you don't
[1:29:48] know he said I wonder if it might sound
[1:29:51] sacrilegious if I mimicked him for a
[1:29:52] minute maybe I'd better not he said one
[1:29:55] among you that you don't know you claim
[1:29:57] to know him but you don't galtha gotha
[1:30:01] they killed the very God that they
[1:30:02] claimed they were serving they didn't
[1:30:04] know him John said there's one among you
[1:30:05] and you don't know him and one day he
[1:30:07] looked out there and he absolutely seen
[1:30:08] a dove coming down from heaven and a
[1:30:10] voice nobody else saw it nobody else
[1:30:12] heard it but he saw it it was an
[1:30:13] absolute not Professor Jones or somebody
[1:30:15] else it was upon whom Thou shalt not see
[1:30:17] the spirit descending and remaining on
[1:30:19] one he is the one that will baptize with
[1:30:20] the Holy Ghost in fire that's the Divine
[1:30:22] Vindication of God making it so it was
[1:30:24] an absolute there was no question in
[1:30:27] John's mind there it was just exactly
[1:30:29] what God Said would take place there it
[1:30:32] was so that Dove upon that ordinary man
[1:30:34] was John's
[1:30:36] absolute now nobody else out there might
[1:30:39] have been able to look at that and say
[1:30:40] that's my absolute because they didn't
[1:30:41] have the same understanding that John
[1:30:44] had but see John had read the word and
[1:30:46] was looking for something to come and
[1:30:48] when it happened he recognized that it
[1:30:50] happened I wonder if he didn't come by
[1:30:53] this morning and we didn't recognize he
[1:30:54] was here because we weren't looking for
[1:30:59] him brother BR would go on he said don't
[1:31:01] he said now I'm going to close by saying
[1:31:03] these few words I'm not brother brandom
[1:31:04] says this he says don't you think we
[1:31:06] need an
[1:31:07] absolute can you say amen he said don't
[1:31:10] you think we need something that's
[1:31:12] real we need something that you can say
[1:31:15] this is it put your hands on it this is
[1:31:18] it now I would say that that today for
[1:31:20] me is this message that for me today is
[1:31:24] not your idea my idea your opinion my
[1:31:27] opinion but today I can say this message
[1:31:30] is it this message is my absolute this
[1:31:34] message when it says I will do what it
[1:31:37] says I'm going to hold on to why because
[1:31:39] what he said was not his own words but
[1:31:41] it was the voice of God speaking to this
[1:31:44] generation and I believe what a prophet
[1:31:47] said and so you may say well he made
[1:31:50] mistakes here and he made mistakes there
[1:31:51] he said I don't want you to remember me
[1:31:53] for those things remember I don't want
[1:31:55] to look at the man's mistakes because
[1:31:57] I'm not looking at the man when you look
[1:31:59] at a message and you see the mistakes
[1:32:01] you're looking at the wrong
[1:32:03] thing you're looking at the message
[1:32:05] you're saying I see mistakes in the
[1:32:06] message you're looking for mistakes in
[1:32:08] the message I'm looking at a perfect
[1:32:10] message brought by A Perfect God sent to
[1:32:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ to raise you
[1:32:15] up from the condition you were in is it
[1:32:17] perfect yes it's perfect because it
[1:32:19] wasn't a man's message but it's from God
[1:32:22] himself amen so if you're looking at the
[1:32:25] messenger you're going to look at a
[1:32:26] message of mistakes but if you're
[1:32:28] looking at the word that he brought
[1:32:29] you're going to see a perfect word for
[1:32:32] you I think today that's why we've got
[1:32:34] people saying did he make mistakes did
[1:32:36] he not make mistakes the truth of it is
[1:32:38] the man made mistakes he said he made
[1:32:40] mistakes but the word is not a
[1:32:44] mistake and so I'm not going to start
[1:32:47] pointing you to a man's mistakes because
[1:32:48] I'm not pointing you to the
[1:32:50] man come on somebody when you hear
[1:32:54] pastor always pointing to the mistakes
[1:32:55] what are they doing they're always
[1:32:56] pointing to the man I'm not looking at
[1:32:58] the man I'm looking at the
[1:33:02] message that might be unpopular to say
[1:33:05] but I don't really care because I
[1:33:07] believe that's what a prophet
[1:33:09] said and he says it like this he says
[1:33:13] now he says uh it's got to be scriptural
[1:33:16] and absolute how many believ that he
[1:33:18] said let me just give you a little
[1:33:20] personal thing here before I close
[1:33:22] brother brandom keeps saying he's going
[1:33:23] to close I hope that's not not the Lord
[1:33:25] telling me to he said brother or sister
[1:33:27] when I take my choice whether I wanted
[1:33:29] to remain with the Baptist Church or
[1:33:30] what it was just as good as any of the
[1:33:32] other ones a bunch of men put together
[1:33:34] which is all right but when it come to a
[1:33:37] time they had to tell me what I had to
[1:33:38] compromise with the word now that ain't
[1:33:42] he said I ain't made out of that what
[1:33:44] about us I ain't made out of
[1:33:47] compromise you ain't made out of
[1:33:49] compromise you were made to fly higher
[1:33:52] and see a little further than these
[1:33:54] denominational chickens is that all
[1:33:56] right man I told my brother the other
[1:33:58] day I had a sermon title come to me
[1:34:00] about the but the chickens that are
[1:34:01] going to be here when we leave this
[1:34:02] world we're going to look down and we're
[1:34:03] going to see Fried
[1:34:11] Chicken Lord forgive
[1:34:14] me but I'm not going to be
[1:34:17] here and
[1:34:20] so I did not preach that one and I
[1:34:22] probably won't
[1:34:24] he said now he said I ain't made out of
[1:34:26] that he said the word is first how many
[1:34:29] can say Amen to that he said they said
[1:34:31] if you don't do it he said you don't do
[1:34:33] that you can no longer belong to the
[1:34:34] Baptist Church he said I don't do it it
[1:34:36] isn't the Baptist Church that saved me
[1:34:38] it was Jesus Christ that saved me he
[1:34:40] said he is my ultimate he is my stand he
[1:34:43] is my absolute he is my ti poost can the
[1:34:46] church say amen he is my tpost there I
[1:34:50] stand where do you stand brother Joel on
[1:34:52] the word where is stand on Christ the
[1:34:55] solid rock I stand all other ground is
[1:34:58] sinking sand if you're standing on a
[1:35:00] man's opinion it's sinking sand but if
[1:35:02] you can stand on the word of God for
[1:35:04] your day all the promises lay in the
[1:35:06] word and I would say today if you need
[1:35:08] healing stand on the promise of the word
[1:35:10] and make that your absolute if you need
[1:35:12] your family to be saved stand on the
[1:35:13] promise of the word and let your family
[1:35:15] come back under the absolute Authority
[1:35:18] that your house shall be saved I want to
[1:35:20] just go ahead and tell you something
[1:35:21] today there's no reason to start doub
[1:35:24] and look at a man's mistake but start
[1:35:25] looking at the word because in the word
[1:35:28] you'll find an absolute that can change
[1:35:30] your life and change your body and
[1:35:32] change your family history I would say
[1:35:35] today start looking to the word get your
[1:35:37] eyes off a man and look to him because
[1:35:39] he is our
[1:35:43] absolute in the beginning the word was
[1:35:46] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:35:48] and so if we say he is my absolute what
[1:35:50] we can say today the word is my absolute
[1:35:53] absolute brother Danny that's our
[1:35:55] Authority is the word when the deacons
[1:35:57] get together and they decide to make a
[1:35:59] decision on who's going to do what and
[1:36:00] where and when and how what they have to
[1:36:02] always consider is what does the word
[1:36:04] say when a pastor is going to stand here
[1:36:06] and preach the gospel to you he better
[1:36:08] go back and see what the word says it
[1:36:10] may not make everybody happy but you've
[1:36:12] got to say what the word said because
[1:36:15] that is our absolute and any man that
[1:36:18] doesn't have that absolute has no
[1:36:20] business being in the Pulpit but if
[1:36:22] you've met God on the basis of his word
[1:36:24] and that has become your absolute then I
[1:36:26] would say today hold on to the absolute
[1:36:28] and preach the
[1:36:31] gospel brother B said he is my absolute
[1:36:34] he is my son he is my
[1:36:36] life he is my ti poost my North Star
[1:36:39] he's all that I could ever think to be
[1:36:41] he is that to me he's my life can the
[1:36:45] church say amen he said and he goes like
[1:36:48] this and I love how brother brandom ties
[1:36:49] his absolute to an anchor he says and
[1:36:52] before you can have faith you've got to
[1:36:54] have something to have faith in welcome
[1:36:56] the church say Amen this morning amen
[1:36:59] you've got to have faith in something if
[1:37:01] your faith is in a man your faith can be
[1:37:03] shaken if your faith is in your church
[1:37:05] your faith can be shaken if your faith
[1:37:08] is in the ship that you're riding in
[1:37:10] then you can be shaken and tossed to and
[1:37:13] fro but if you're anchored to Christ the
[1:37:15] solid rock then nothing can move you the
[1:37:18] waves can blow and the winds can blow
[1:37:20] and the waves can rock your boat but
[1:37:22] nothing can move you from from the
[1:37:23] foundation where you're anchored can the
[1:37:25] church say Amen this morning if you've
[1:37:27] got an anchor then you better hold on to
[1:37:29] that anchor this morning because all the
[1:37:32] devils in Hell may be trying to come at
[1:37:33] you and trying to get our women to start
[1:37:35] acting like the world and start making
[1:37:37] you dress different and start acting
[1:37:38] different and maybe they're trying to
[1:37:40] get us to start getting cold and formal
[1:37:42] in church but can I go ahead and tell
[1:37:43] you something none of these things move
[1:37:46] the Bride of Jesus Christ because we
[1:37:48] have an
[1:37:50] anchor so none of these things I don't
[1:37:53] care how cold the church gets nothing is
[1:37:55] going to stop me from worshiping in the
[1:37:57] house of God nothing's going to stop my
[1:37:59] praise why because I have an
[1:38:03] anchor brother Rand would go on like
[1:38:05] this he said he said you have to have
[1:38:07] faith in it in the word of the Living
[1:38:09] God what's created the powers of the
[1:38:10] almighty he said what more could we put
[1:38:12] our hopes in therefore it makes you look
[1:38:14] different act different you are looking
[1:38:17] for God to fulfill his promise and when
[1:38:19] difficulties arise like we have now it
[1:38:22] is an anchor it's something that holds
[1:38:24] you something that you are tied to it's
[1:38:27] a promise that we have been tied to the
[1:38:29] word of God is he said and just like the
[1:38:32] anchor is the absolute to the ship in
[1:38:34] the time of the storm the ship can be
[1:38:36] sailing the Sea and the anchor is out in
[1:38:38] the front of it it's he said and it rest
[1:38:40] and you people here he said close to the
[1:38:42] Sea and he was talking to the people in
[1:38:44] Houston I believe it was and he said he
[1:38:45] said with the this excess weight of this
[1:38:47] Great Mighty anchor but he said when the
[1:38:49] storms come and the Raging storms that
[1:38:51] rips up the sea and could throw the
[1:38:52] vessel into the the bank somewhere and
[1:38:54] crash it or turn it over in the shallow
[1:38:56] Waters it gets out in the deep water and
[1:38:58] lets down this great huge anchor and he
[1:39:00] said it's so fixed till it'll drag on
[1:39:02] the bottom of the sea until it hooks
[1:39:04] into the top of some unseen
[1:39:06] mountain and then let those storms rage
[1:39:09] if they want to it's got an
[1:39:12] absolute I'm so glad that we're holding
[1:39:14] on to the Unseen today and we have an
[1:39:17] absolute my absolute is not a man my
[1:39:20] absolute is not where he walked or not
[1:39:21] what he did but my absolute is the
[1:39:23] message that the man carried and I'm so
[1:39:26] glad that I'm riding on that absolute
[1:39:27] today and I'm holding on to it because
[1:39:30] in the midst of the storm he still is
[1:39:33] holding me
[1:39:35] amen you say well brother Joel brother
[1:39:37] random is my absolute well that's just
[1:39:39] fine I'd rather he be your absolute I'd
[1:39:41] rather you you know you can worship him
[1:39:43] if you want to but I'm worshiping the
[1:39:45] god that made the man come in this hour
[1:39:47] and called me out with a
[1:39:50] messag I'm worshiping the message that
[1:39:53] he brought the the word that is Christ
[1:39:57] that's who I worship that's who I choose
[1:39:59] to
[1:40:00] worship we give honor we give respect to
[1:40:03] the ministry we give respect to the men
[1:40:04] we give respect to the
[1:40:06] prophets but if you look at Moses's
[1:40:08] Ministry just for a
[1:40:10] second if the people were so anchored to
[1:40:14] Moses that when he couldn't go over the
[1:40:16] people decided to not go over but Joshua
[1:40:19] and Caleb were not anchored to the man
[1:40:22] but they were anchored to to the
[1:40:24] promise I hope you can hear me just for
[1:40:26] a moment now if you were anchored to the
[1:40:28] man you would have died there in the
[1:40:30] wilderness but if you were anchored to
[1:40:31] the promise you were going to go over
[1:40:32] and you were going to fight the good
[1:40:34] fight and you were going to overcome why
[1:40:36] because you were anchored to something
[1:40:37] more than
[1:40:40] humanity and he
[1:40:42] said hope this is okay y'all still with
[1:40:45] me y'all okay my time's almost
[1:40:48] up y'all just you can start shouting if
[1:40:51] my time's up okay The Anchor Holds
[1:40:54] somewhere when you start shouting real
[1:40:55] loud I'll just
[1:40:58] quit well nobody wants me to quit all
[1:41:01] right he said The Anchor Holds somewhere
[1:41:03] Yonder but it's tight and as the ship
[1:41:05] and the waves whip around the ship it's
[1:41:07] got an absolute because it's
[1:41:10] tied I want to focus on this for a few
[1:41:12] moments before we close he said that's
[1:41:13] the way that a man is when he's tied to
[1:41:15] Christ and to his word and believes it
[1:41:19] there's an absolute there something that
[1:41:21] holds him an AB abolute is like the
[1:41:24] North Star when you're lost he said
[1:41:26] you've lost all your directions but you
[1:41:28] can have that compass in your hand and
[1:41:30] you can actually take that Compass I
[1:41:31] don't care if you get rocked around
[1:41:33] Shook Up turned upside down you can hold
[1:41:35] that Compass out and it will always
[1:41:37] point you toward the North Star that's
[1:41:40] right so is the so the compass was
[1:41:43] pointing you to an
[1:41:45] absolute and this is my final point
[1:41:47] before we close I'm so glad today we
[1:41:50] y'all are looking at me like you're a
[1:41:52] liar
[1:41:53] I'm watching the clock we're okay the
[1:41:57] compass that came in our day was
[1:41:59] literally pointing us to the
[1:42:02] word and you're sitting there shaking it
[1:42:04] I wanted to point to something else it
[1:42:05] was always going to point to the word oh
[1:42:08] I wish my I wish that Compass would
[1:42:10] point back to me no it's going to point
[1:42:11] to the word why does my compass not
[1:42:14] Point towards a man because it was
[1:42:15] focused on the north star and the
[1:42:18] compass is always going to point you to
[1:42:20] him why because it's not about you it's
[1:42:22] not about the church it's not about the
[1:42:24] preachers it's not about the pastors
[1:42:26] it's not about the man that God used to
[1:42:28] bring this message but it's about him
[1:42:30] and the message that he brought listen
[1:42:32] Church the message is Christ that's what
[1:42:35] we're tied to that is my
[1:42:38] absolute you might see it a little
[1:42:39] different than I do I might see it a
[1:42:41] little different than you do listen
[1:42:42] that's not my absolute my my way of
[1:42:45] seeing things is not your
[1:42:46] absolute
[1:42:50] right but if we hold our Compass up
[1:42:54] and we turn it on and listen to that
[1:42:56] Compass it's always pointing back to
[1:42:59] him if you're listening to a compass
[1:43:01] that's pointing to themselves you got a
[1:43:03] broken Compass that's right brother Bram
[1:43:07] said an absolute is like the North Star
[1:43:10] and he goes on down and he says man this
[1:43:12] is a long quote I may have to quit this
[1:43:13] one he said you know the same Morning
[1:43:15] Star is the evening star also because
[1:43:16] the world just turned around but there's
[1:43:18] one star that does not move and it's
[1:43:20] centered right in the middle of the
[1:43:21] Earth and therefore it's a sh star if
[1:43:24] you know the North Star you can always
[1:43:26] find your way around but oh that's when
[1:43:28] a man is lost and he doesn't know just
[1:43:31] which way to go now he said I know a
[1:43:32] star it's more than a north north star
[1:43:35] and to be tied and see his presence no
[1:43:37] matter how you're lost or where you are
[1:43:40] you can find your way back by his
[1:43:42] guidance that's his
[1:43:45] word it's the way out of all troubles
[1:43:47] it's the way to peace how many needs
[1:43:49] peace in their life how many's in
[1:43:51] trouble
[1:43:54] you don't have to put your hand up to it
[1:43:55] but if you got trouble in your life he
[1:43:58] is the way out of all troubles it's the
[1:44:00] way to peace it's the way to success are
[1:44:03] you needing success he is the way to
[1:44:06] success you never thought about that did
[1:44:10] you he said it's the way to life itself
[1:44:13] is to follow this star the Lord Jesus
[1:44:15] and now if you are tied to the star the
[1:44:16] holy spirit is the compass that'll only
[1:44:18] point to the star a compass he said it
[1:44:21] is magnetized to that North Pole and the
[1:44:23] only way no matter how much you juggle
[1:44:25] it or in your How Deep The thickets are
[1:44:27] around how much jungle you're in How
[1:44:29] Deep The thickets are around you or how
[1:44:30] foggy it is it see the compass hand you
[1:44:33] can turn it any way you want to it'll
[1:44:35] swing right back and point to the north
[1:44:39] star and he said when we're in trouble
[1:44:42] and trusting Christ there's one thing
[1:44:44] sure the Holy Spirit Will point us to
[1:44:46] the word that will guide us to the North
[1:44:49] Star how many believes that this morning
[1:44:51] and to deliver of everything thing we
[1:44:53] have need of he is our
[1:44:57] absolute now I'm just crazy enough this
[1:45:00] morning to believe that a prophet if he
[1:45:02] said he is our absolute he is my
[1:45:07] absolute brother Brandon would say this
[1:45:10] turn from your lukewarm ways get away
[1:45:13] from all these things that's dragging
[1:45:14] you out like Hollywood these things
[1:45:17] that's dragging you like the rest of the
[1:45:18] churches return to God and get an
[1:45:21] absolute that will hold the anchor of
[1:45:23] your heart if your absolute has become
[1:45:26] Hollywood lay it aside this morning and
[1:45:28] let your absolute become the word again
[1:45:31] if your absolute has become a man then
[1:45:33] lay it aside this morning and look to
[1:45:36] the word can you say Amen if your
[1:45:38] absolute has become something other than
[1:45:40] this word I say lay it aside this
[1:45:42] morning lay aside every sin and weight
[1:45:45] that so does so easily beset you and let
[1:45:47] us run this race with patience and let
[1:45:51] us look to the one who is is the North
[1:45:53] Star and let us look this morning to the
[1:45:55] one who is our absolute and if he is our
[1:45:58] absolute then none of these things
[1:46:01] around me can move me it don't matter
[1:46:04] how the women dress it don't matter how
[1:46:06] the men dress it don't matter how how
[1:46:08] your pastor Falls or how your wife Falls
[1:46:10] or how your brother or your sister Falls
[1:46:12] away none of these things move me why
[1:46:16] because on Christ the solid rock I stand
[1:46:19] all other ground is sinking sand I'm
[1:46:22] holding on to the one who cannot fall
[1:46:25] I'm so glad this morning that it doesn't
[1:46:27] matter about the ones around me that
[1:46:29] that that might tell you this is wrong
[1:46:30] or that's wrong or the message is just
[1:46:32] listen this message ain't wrong I'm tied
[1:46:35] to this message and I'm going to hold on
[1:46:37] to it why because it's holding on to me
[1:46:40] I can't let it go and if it's my
[1:46:42] absolute this morning I'm going to do
[1:46:44] everything I can to line up to this
[1:46:48] message he said Lord Jesus this is a
[1:46:50] prayer of brother random he said your
[1:46:53] word is from old it's the beginning and
[1:46:54] the end I now with this congregation
[1:46:57] consecrate myself a new over this Pulpit
[1:46:58] today I ask for this church the Life
[1:47:00] Tabernacle is where he was at he said
[1:47:01] for a consecration settle all the
[1:47:03] differences let it all be gone bygones
[1:47:06] be bygones yes and he
[1:47:10] said Ministers of the Gospel who is
[1:47:13] worried and thought something would take
[1:47:14] place oh God we tie ourself this morning
[1:47:16] to Jesus Christ the word and determined
[1:47:20] to know nothing else but Jesus Christ
[1:47:21] and him crucified Oh north star oh holy
[1:47:25] spirit oh Compass of God come now into
[1:47:28] every heart and we consecrate ourselves
[1:47:30] to you and I want to just say tonight or
[1:47:33] this morning that if we're tied to him
[1:47:35] you can't be
[1:47:37] shaken if you're tied to him let the
[1:47:40] world do what it will it's not my
[1:47:42] absolute anyway if you're tied to this
[1:47:45] word church then when the word says
[1:47:47] something we ly to it and if the
[1:47:49] messenger said something listen I I I
[1:47:51] believe and I don't want want you to go
[1:47:53] away this morning and say was brother
[1:47:54] Joel putting down the messenger no that
[1:47:57] was God's man for the hour and that was
[1:47:59] the man that we could look to and say
[1:48:01] God sent a prophet in this day with thus
[1:48:03] sayith the Lord and he was he was sent
[1:48:05] with a message to turn our hearts back
[1:48:06] and and the man came and he did his job
[1:48:09] and he died like a mortal so that we
[1:48:12] would not look to the man but we would
[1:48:14] look to the message that he brought and
[1:48:15] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:48:17] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:48:19] mystery shall be finished we're living
[1:48:21] in a day of an open book and we can tie
[1:48:23] ourselves to that open word today you
[1:48:27] say well are we tied what are we tied to
[1:48:28] listen the denominations are saying I'm
[1:48:30] tied to a book I'm tied to the word I'm
[1:48:32] tied to the Bible they're all saying it
[1:48:34] but they don't know what they're tied to
[1:48:35] because they can't see past the seal
[1:48:38] that is holding it back from them but to
[1:48:39] our eyes that have been opened today we
[1:48:41] can see past the seal and we can say God
[1:48:44] has sent a prophet with a message and
[1:48:46] I'm tied to it this message is my
[1:48:50] absolute I wonder if we can stand
[1:48:52] together this morning I know this is I
[1:48:55] went a little over time and I know this
[1:48:57] is just a little bit cut
[1:49:00] up but what's your absolute this
[1:49:04] morning is it a man or is it the
[1:49:08] word I said this last
[1:49:13] week when Ezekiel Saw when he looked he
[1:49:19] saw a wheel in the middle of a wheel and
[1:49:22] and brother brandom said when he looked
[1:49:23] he saw the Hub and he said the Hub in
[1:49:27] the middle of the wheel was Christ and
[1:49:29] all things all the spokes everything off
[1:49:31] the Hub was tied to him and so this
[1:49:35] morning to make that wheel go around and
[1:49:38] to make ourselves tied and stay in
[1:49:41] Balance we've got to be tied to the hub
[1:49:45] the wheel in the middle of the
[1:49:47] wheel are you tied to the message this
[1:49:50] morning amen I'm not holding this
[1:49:52] message
[1:49:53] because if I was holding the message I
[1:49:55] could let
[1:49:56] go but because the message is holding me
[1:49:58] I can't let go of
[1:50:01] it I've been pointed to a man
[1:50:05] before but when I listen to the tapes he
[1:50:07] doesn't point me to a man he points me
[1:50:10] to
[1:50:12] him so what is my
[1:50:15] absolute it's
[1:50:18] Christ and if that's my absolute then I
[1:50:20] can stand here with Assurance today
[1:50:23] and say if I stay with this
[1:50:25] word then you'll see me in a
[1:50:27] Rapture why because the same word that
[1:50:30] has brought me to the message is the
[1:50:32] same word that is calling me to come up
[1:50:34] higher and the same word that is going
[1:50:37] to call me from this Earthly vile body
[1:50:39] that I'm living in it's the same word
[1:50:42] that's going to look brother Jeff we're
[1:50:43] going to look at each other one day and
[1:50:44] we're going to be the same age and we're
[1:50:46] both going to have
[1:50:50] hair you think it's a fairy tale
[1:50:53] it's an absolute
[1:50:54] truth is the rapture real it's an
[1:50:57] absolute truth is this message of fairy
[1:50:59] tale it's an absolute truth it was a
[1:51:02] revealing of Christ in our day to show
[1:51:04] you that the word is here and when the
[1:51:06] word is here all things are possible if
[1:51:09] you'll just believe it if you'll believe
[1:51:11] on the absolute this morning I would say
[1:51:13] all things are possible if you've got
[1:51:15] children that are not saved hold to your
[1:51:17] absolute if there's sickness in your
[1:51:18] body hold to your absolute amen sister
[1:51:21] Millie's blood pressure was real bad
[1:51:22] this morning she didn't know she'd get
[1:51:24] to come it was just skyrocketed crazy
[1:51:27] High when the Devil comes in like that
[1:51:29] when the enemy comes in like a flood God
[1:51:32] has raised up a standard he's raised up
[1:51:35] somebody who will hold on to an absolute
[1:51:37] and say I'm going to run with this
[1:51:39] message why because it is the word of
[1:51:42] God today it is my
[1:51:46] absolute with your heads bowed and your
[1:51:49] eyes closed
[1:51:55] brother brandom
[1:51:57] said he said don't look to me as a man
[1:52:00] I'm a man I'm full of
[1:52:02] mistakes but look to what I'm saying
[1:52:04] about him aren't you glad we had a man
[1:52:08] who could point us to the
[1:52:14] man if you have a need on your heart the
[1:52:16] altars open if you find yourself
[1:52:18] drifting at
[1:52:20] Sea we have an anchor
[1:52:23] sometimes you just need to let down the
[1:52:25] anchor and rest a
[1:52:27] while and when you're there and the
[1:52:29] anchor is
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:32] holding and you feel like you're still
[1:52:34] being tossed to and fro remember we have
[1:52:36] an anchor and the anchor is not just
[1:52:40] there when we're
[1:52:41] shouting the anchor is not just there
[1:52:44] when we feel good it is not just there
[1:52:47] in the noise but when the waves calm
[1:52:52] and you look all the time the anchor was
[1:52:55] holding and I loved how a prophet said
[1:52:58] he said the anchor he said it may have
[1:53:00] moved around but he said pretty soon it
[1:53:02] caught onto some big mountain some
[1:53:04] unseen Mountain at the bottom of the
[1:53:08] sea I'd say reach up this
[1:53:12] morning and there's an unseen hand
[1:53:14] that's willing to hold on to you if you
[1:53:16] have need of an anchor this morning with
[1:53:18] every head bowed every eye closed if you
[1:53:21] need prayer the altar is open
