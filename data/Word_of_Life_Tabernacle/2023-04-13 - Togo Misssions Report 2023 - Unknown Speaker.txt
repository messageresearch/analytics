larvae invites you to come into this place and or if we just talk about some things that you've done and or talk about or the work that's going on we we want you to be preeminent in our midst Lord if you'd have something to say you'd want to move me out of the way to say it I pray that you do that tonight humble ourselves to your word we thank you for all that you've done in Jesus name please [Music] so good to be with you tonight I want to read II Peter 1 1 2 Peter 1 and 1 brother Joel could you grab that piece of paper on my desk it has the announcements written on it I can do that [Music] and and part of that's being gone and my brain just not recovered yet we got in today about 1 30 and uh but I wanted to speak to you tonight so I may not be worth much thank you may not be worth much and them folks in Togo just about preaching me to death I'm on tape their amens and bring it back and and have it so we can we can have that like a soundtrack but um that and we're gonna bring some in boys some little 10 year old boys and have them teach y'all how to play drums huh but we pray for the Peter does a good job in all of our drummers but we're thankful thankful to be here tonight second Peter 1 and 1. Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious faith with us I love the way he addresses that through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ I pray the Lord that is blessing to the word you may be seated I've got several announcements before we get into this tonight this Sunday we'll have two Services back to our regular schedule but whether Georgia Moore is going to be here as you can tell I don't have much left to give brother George just happened to be flying in the area flying into the area so he's going to be here Sunday and I know you'll enjoy that but I'll be here just trying to recover a little bit and then this week we're gonna have something special for you and and I've been to a lot of church so we're fixing to have a little bit of church make up for some that we've missed here but Tuesday and Wednesday of this coming week we're going to have church now if you can't be here on Tuesday night be here on Wednesday night just like normal if we are going to have our regular Wednesday night service but Tuesday night brother Andrew Glover is going to be here and so I'm sure if you can be here that would be a blessing and I'm sure there'll be some visitors as well I let brother Jackson know and and brother Morris as well so well but the man so I'm sure some of the folks will will come and and so if you brother Andrew will be here Tuesday night and they're coming to pick up some chairs or that's what they're that was the excuse anyway and I told them while they were here that they needed to preach so so he's going to preach Tuesday night and then Wednesday night for our regular service and again if you can't be here on Tuesday night be here on Wednesday night and brother Josh Martin will be preaching for us so them two young men are just powerful preachers and so we'll have just a little bit of a Revival during the middle of the week and and I don't feel any pressure about that again if you're I know it's last minute and throwing it together if you're not able to be here that's that's I understand that but if you can be I'm sure it'll be a blessing to you uh then uh Saturday I believe it's for the Isaac's wedding on Saturday so uh let's try to go to that if you can I'm sure brother Isaac would appreciate some support from his home church and uh they're they're they're expecting to make this their church as a young married couple so we want to support them and that'll be it by the David Morris's on Saturday I think at one o'clock is it one o'clock or yeah one o'clock so uh try to support them in that and and I'm sure we want to do that for all our our young couples and then on the 29th we're going to have a work day here at the church so everybody say praise the Lord praise the Lord for the work day to on the 29th we'll have our spring work day try to get there's a bunch of stuff that needs to be done so if you can help us or or anytime if you want to come early or late that's fine but we're going to try to get together on the 29th to do some of the landscaping and things that need to be done amen let's get into this tonight I it was a miracle that I got to go to Togo a miracle and some of you know and some of you don't I had covid the week before I didn't know it I preached twice with it and I was sick and then I I didn't test until I was supposed to test on Thursday to go and I they canceled my test the testing location I had another test set up on Friday they canceled the test and uh so I took a self-test at home tested positive and I said well there's just no way I'm going to be able to go but then I took another self-test the next day because I preached here on Sunday took another self-testine it was negative the next day and so I said well we just don't know but I knew the other tests were more sensitive we went uh and that guy gave me a test on Monday and I got the results back and I was cleared to go so I didn't know for sure I would be able to go until Monday afternoon we didn't even pack all my stuff because I was that certain that I wasn't going to be able to go but God works in mysterious ways and and uh and I want to tell you some several things tonight and and just to let you know that we were meant to be there at the time we're there it was of the Lord that we were there and I know sometimes it's hard but but just bear with me tonight and you don't want your pastor to be gone I don't want to be gone but I think that it would be a blessing it was a blessing to them and and and that's what we wanted to do so we want to try to help somebody else we don't want to ever become too self-centered and looking at our own selves and just taking care of our own because we do want to do that that should be first but then we also want to reach out and help somebody we have been blessed and those of you who have traveled to Mission work and done things but Alan's been some places and different ones but Joel's been with me to Egypt if you've been overseas you know it's a different world especially in some of them third world countries and Togo is the second poorest country in the world right next to Haiti it's very very poor I can't even describe how poor that Togo is and yet the people of God are there and and the people are happy and and uh and they serve the Lord with all of their heart so Togo if you give me that slide that's where it's located in uh on the African Coast so you can see where we went we flew into loamy and we stayed there in the city lome is the city that's very close to the uh to the ocean and it's a city of about two million people there on the border of Ghana and and Togo uh we had eight Services over five days on Wednesday they had me scheduled in two different places at once and Brother David Shamel went with us uh at the last minute it was another thing another reason why I wasn't going to go is I didn't have anybody to go with me but the Joel needed to stay here and and uh some of the other brothers couldn't go and uh I didn't I don't like to do Mission work by myself it's not safe especially in some of those countries and Brother David Shamel offered to go with me and I am so happy that he did because they would have killed me without him being there and he preached two Services one at the beginning so I could be in one church Wednesday and he could be in another so we both got off the plane and preached on on Wednesday and then uh they uh but he was in one church and I was in another and uh in in the same city so I really appreciated him doing that that was his third sermon he had ever preached was in Africa so that was a real treat for him he'd only preached twice at his home church so he got to do that and and uh so we went to I was at brother Bernice church and if you heard me talk about brother benite before he doesn't speak English so it's hard for me to converse with him when I'm not there and don't have an interpreter but brother Benny is a wonderful wonderful man of God he's got a beautiful little church there and I'll talk to you more about that in just a minute on Thursday we went and I preached at the church in the village about 45 kilometers from uh from lome in ahato and I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right I I can't pronounce their names at all but uh and then that was a really neat little church up there brother John started that church I don't know if you if you know but John Paducah you've seen him here in the Pulpit but the John has started many churches maybe dozens of churches over the years and he it starts them gets a group of Believers going and and finds a young man that can pasture it and puts him over it and then he moves on and he still pastors his own church and that's what he's done for years he's been a missionary he's been all over Africa in almost every country in Africa with brother Robert Wilson he doesn't travel with brother Robert anymore he's just gotten too old and and he got to come into uh to America some and it softened him up it's amazing how soft we are I'm not I'm soft I I am I actually brother John I preached brother John under uh the the second night on Thursday night or no Friday night at his church first night at his church uh he had we had to trade interpreters because he was about to fall down so but it was so hot and you sweat so much but John's a big band but he told me later he said I've gotten used to it being in America or something he said it's made me soft so we had to trade out for a younger man but I kept going I'm real proud of that if you can't tell um we had our Easter convention Friday through Sunday so I preached Friday night Saturday morning uh Saturday night Sunday morning at brother John paducah's Church there in Loma he had about three or four hundred people that were there uh in in that in those services and it was a real blessing and then uh Sunday evening we went to Pastor Antoine's Church which I've been to before or five years ago but they've changed buildings and that night I was about dead and we had to sit there the way it worked they they said let's have church at five o'clock well nobody in Togo seems to have a watch that's something they seem to need his watches or maybe they don't need them because they're happy without them but they don't show up at five o'clock for a church service they show up at dark for a church service so we waited and five o'clock came and went and I couldn't have preached that service but David did that but I did get up and greet the people afterwards so we're so again I'm so grateful for him being there well the next slide uh brother that's Brother David and myself on the first day that we were there waiting at the hotel uh we get a very nice hotel there in Togo it's one that I've been to before it's where the uh the government officials and stuff stay you have to do that because it's secure they got security and guards and stuff outside it's very important on the rights Pastor John and Pastor Beni at uh pastor benin's church there in lo mein go to the next slide uh this is uh some of what we were eating while we were there um my favorite food in Togo is whole fish well this is not the time of year I guess to get that because over the Easter holidays they they served a lot of fish I was only able to eat this meal once while I was there and it wasn't honestly the best that I've ever had but the fish was really good I put a picture of of uh David's Pizza on there because he ordered pizza but he couldn't he don't speak real good french David's trying to learn French and he was trying to he was ordering pizza and I don't know what you like on your pizza but he just pointed to one and they went and got it and it had Tuna on it he don't eat fish but he ate that pizza because he was hungry it has two things he don't eat tuna and egg yolks and they had tuna and eggs and onions and olives on that pizza it was great so I enjoyed his pizza too I ate about half of it I can eat just about anywhere travel to the next slide this is how the people eat mostly there that's a Street restaurant that's fast food you can see that on the left of the man he just sets up a little stand and he cooks I'm tired of it just be honest with you and I'm I told myself I wouldn't get emotional tonight because I am tired and I'm a little bit vulnerable but I you can't unsee some things you know what you do you end up just you quit looking you just get to the point you can't look out the window anymore brother you know what I'm talking about you've been there and um you you can't look out the window and and see the way that they live you just have to ignore it in order to be able to function because it's so depressing and and I don't think anything about it it's just the way that they live but there's no sewer system no no water ventral water system uh you can't drink the water at all you can't eat anything washed in the water you can't eat and it's just very dirty very dirty public restrooms no private rooms to speak up and accept it but the churches churches and there's trash everywhere just trash everywhere and they actually fill the potholes with trash and I will never complain about a pothole again in my life because but they they've got potholes that swallow cars over there every Street's got them it's just they just keep getting bigger and you drive down you drive into the potholes and drive back up the other side and that's how big they are and uh and eventually if a pothole just gets so bad that they can't drive it anymore they just close the street off you know you just go a different route and uh so the streets are are mud or sand most of the streets that are there so it's a real problem when it rains and um but they're uh but there are people that in the churches I noticed this and it gave me brother Harvey a little bit of uh uh a little bit of encouragement for what we do here that they keep the churches up very nice and the grounds and everything there's no trash there's no uh everything's you know pristine it's dirt most of the floors brother John's got concrete floor most of the and uh I really appreciated that I noticed that this time they really keep up the churches and I think we ought to do that and do the very best we can do to keep up our church and it just made me uh it made me want to mention that to the trustees because I I think if if they can do that and we do you all do a wonderful job but it just gives me a little bit extra uh thought about that keep up and do the best we can do they dress their best to come to church is a few years ago it's the same building they've added some some different things this is just his regular Wednesday night crowd that was there I noticed the first night that I was there that the people were different covet affected Us in ways that we don't know but it didn't affect us in any way like it did them they have an authoritarian government they don't have any rights it's a dictatorship and so they didn't have the ability to to protest over what they do if they protest is they they put snipers on the rooftops and kill them until they leave and uh so they don't they don't protest anymore uh and so what they can do and they would churches afraid and so us go and give them the courage to come and uh and have meetings again and this was the first meeting that I know of there uh in that country since that happened and I I know it was among these people at least and that's pastor benin's church there on Wednesday night but that's what I noticed was the reservation at first and then the Lord really blessed us in that service but it was hard because they hadn't been together and you've got to go to church to be in Revival that's just a fact of life brother random said you can't be as good a Christian and and not go to church and and he's not saying anything prophetic there that's just the truth right right [Laughter] some of you remember this picture this is a picture that I took five years ago as you can tell I was much skinnier uh a baby and I've already given this Facebook but I thought I'd give it to those of you who don't have it tonight um I can't it's the first thing I ever did in Togo was dedicate this baby first thing first service before the service at the beginning when I started to preach held this baby and one other baby and dedicated maybe have a cleft lip it's clip it's lip we just went up and it just disappeared really bad shape and it it bothered me and my wife will tell you it's bothered me for five years I didn't know what happened to that I didn't know what if it could get any medical care I didn't know anything about it after the service Wednesday [Applause] thank you let's talk about it and um it's a by their standards it takes two hours to get there so it's a two-hour drive to go even in a nice vehicle it's a mining town they have a a mining operation that they run there the government does and and mine are the Earth so it's kind of odd they got red clay a red dirt man there and even the floors made out of that you go to the next side this is a congregation there's again the church in that church and the congregation there was they don't ever get to see anybody from America so they were very pleased to get to see that and they gathered together those are all just their local people uh if you go to the next slide and that night [Laughter] and I always enjoyed preaching that in Africa because of those are Simon's children and that's how I prayed for that baby by the way the way brother Branham prayed for the blind girl when he said that he said this assignments there actually uh anyway it may not be but maybe related but anyway he was sharp look at those clothes they dress up to go to church and dress their kids up and it's really neat to see how they love those clothes and by the way I didn't bring it tonight I have a full suit of that it's brighter colors it's purple but it's I have an African suit now and one of these days I'll work up the courage to wear before one of the differences and they come in into the office and there's a tailor there in the church David and they gave us a suit of clothes and then he gave me an extra shirt as well so I have two uh two shirts and a suit so I I can I can look just like an African it'll look just like them with that this is uh [Laughter] we did it some people are eating pay your ties and offerings and things sometimes I heard of what I use in the mission part of what I used to go on so I want to thank you for that foreign I just freaking uh that's a picture and when it rains in Togo it pours you know that's the old saying but it does it's tropical country and it was very hot temperatures compared to 106 degrees when I was there 106 humidity you're preaching in that so that's what we had to do uh probably good for me everything is true it's like a monster truck bed it's probably four foot four foot but it's well I'm serious about 10 or 12. they're getting on this bike they're they're stacking on Church they're gonna drive back in the rain I'm not I'm not saying this tonight to make you feel bad you guys do good and come to church in the pouring rain and on on Friday night and we were going to have church at 10 o'clock in the morning and uh at actually nine o'clock go to church than we do it don't go just because there's nothing else to do I could find something to do to go to church because they're hungry they want to hear the word of the Lord these people were going on Saturday morning on our way to church and I noticed pictures inside the church online so I thank you the next side you see a picture of the congregation on Saturday or Sunday at the church you can see of the inside and there's one of us preaching as well the next one catch up with me there there's a preaching and then pretty much brother Antoine's Church thank you sitting there preparing the young man Was preparing to preach and while we were there we got attacked by flies there was some kind of little black and of course it's in the open and it had rained and so all the bugs woke up and the stink the smell you don't realize the smell until it rains this is going outside of that church go to the next slide that's inside of the Antoine's Church very nice church for there but you can see the dirt floor and uh they love their drums and some of these people even drums you can take them I got some videos for them because they really won't believe in drones when I get done showing them what they do in Africa but it comes from their heart and five years ago he uh he don't drive he can't see uh very well but he he and so five years ago he drove me uh at night we ran into a building he drove me from his church back to more um this uh against on the next slide this is a Brothers I want to show you this because the little brother on the investor Bruno from Benin uh they drove six hours or came by bus six hours on Monday to see us because they want us to come to Benin at some point I've been there for them with brother Ivy and they drove all the way just to eat lunch with us and see us on Monday and so that's what we did on Monday and while we were resting getting ready to come back on Tuesday and uh so the Lord be with those Brothers those are wonderful brothers Brother Bruno is a taxi driver for a living he drives a motorbike taxi is what he does and so I wanted to include that as well why did we go we had a prayer line as well on Saturday night prayed for almost all of those people I believe there'd be miracles from that we went I already explained to you what had happened with covet the people were so afraid brother John told me he said you don't know what this means he said to be the first time in all in three years we've been able to meet because that's their life that's what they love to do it's a crucial time for Africa this was called to my attention I hope I'm not boring you tonight this was called to my attention on the flight back I we came in to pass security because you gotta go through security 15 times in Africa and none of it's any good but anyway you go through the security and finally get to the final security and you're at your gate we got through security and I looked over and there was a a preacher there that I knew who used to be a message preacher and he had preached a convention and gone on the same weekend that I preached in Togo and after 50 more than 50 trips to Africa to preach the message of those people he was now going back to Africa to persuade them to leave the message and that may not be his stated purpose but that's what he was doing there is what he does with his life now leave the message and after all of those times and I was we were on the flight with him coming back I shook his hand and uh and Brother David talked to him a little bit but it really hit me really hit me because this is a crucial time for them those people are going and they're letting it be known that uh you know their Gospel of what they're preaching and they're going into message churches because that's the context that they have and slowly [Laughter] messages [Laughter] across the Border I didn't know it it's a crucial Time Forever somebody knows what they're talking I don't say that I do but I'll say this I'll stand for this message and somebody needed to stand for this message in Africa they just really drove home to me because they're going we need to be going what do we believe in what do we believe in what do we spend our time on and again we we need to be we need to be making sure that we spend our time on the correct things so false teachers will go Paul says this can I have five more minutes thank you for bearing with me tonight Paul says for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous was awesome always after them men who should know better men with great Ministries we have a message there's a reason why we're here I need to stand for it I need to believe it you need to take sides with Jesus can I just tell you that tonight before we go we need to take signs with Jesus I listen to that tape on the way back and I want to report to try to belittle him in the side of the people that's what these men are doing today that's what the Devils tries to do to you he tries to find every little Shadow he can find to belittle the word and he is the word in this house brother Branham and I explained this to the African people the brother Brandon was not crying but the word is Christ sometimes that is because a man [Laughter] Real Men of God talk like men of God excuse me act like men of God live like men of God dude it's not just because to devour what he can why that's the reason they tried little him yes they were jealous of his ministry right belittle him make everything like they wanted the people to denounce it internet today it's not just yeah they're sending missionaries they wanted to say now this guy is nothing looky here now there you know that's not right we've been out all our life that we should Builders and here he is foreign I wish I had a voice I'd preached tonight the ones that believed him how many believe him tonight the ones that believed him and loved him and had seen his scriptural Miracle signs would not be hindered by them no sir them who believed him believed him those who loved him how many loved him tonight I'm not talking about a man I'm talking about the word that's Christ to us how many loves him and those who loved him stood by him they would not see I love this you say who say they said they wouldn't see it yeah oh God give us a backbone today he wouldn't see what others pointed out to them yes later on in that message I was listening to this on the way here tonight it really struck me you said so my young brethren you all that's going out here in these churches hold to God's word opportunity to stand there and beat it okay I don't care what the world says stay right with it yeah he said so we don't need fanaticism we have we have God and he's a living God stay true and holy and with that word God will vindicate you musicians go ahead and comes at brother Ben Howe how will God vindicate me vindicates you ultimately Our Hope Church you know each other because they won't see people because it was such a love for one another [Music] don't you love that what is it in the way of that [Laughter] the last one comes back on in reverse order I have four messengers of death four messengers of life so the brotherly the Brotherly Love Is thank you the shadow of a shadow of a shadow of something coming he said the love that you have for God that that feeling of his presence that love that you have for one another is just a shadow of a shadow [Laughter] s let me let me have that because that's what's coming there is a Rapture coming let's hold fast to the word no matter who goes against it no matter who does something different hold on it won't be much longer I can tell those people hold on [Music] [Laughter] the world that I know of in the world I want to take every opportunity [Laughter] bigger than the slot [Music] I don't know I just feel like rededicating myself tonight [Laughter] it's Africa trip he preaches a shame foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight [Music] [Laughter] she just had such a feeling for her baby [Laughter] but foreign [Laughter] disagreements [Laughter] the standing for the
