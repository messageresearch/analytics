[47:23] and I don't want to talk about marital
[47:25] love or or the love of a boyfriend or
[47:28] girlfriend or something tonight I want
[47:29] to talk about uh loving God and loving
[47:33] one another we'll talk about the
[47:34] greatest commandment Matthew
[47:37] 22:35 says then one of them which was a
[47:39] lawyer asking a question tempting him
[47:42] and
[47:43] saying he says Master which is the great
[47:46] commandment in the law so in other words
[47:49] if you put them all on a list what's the
[47:51] greatest
[47:52] one which is the great commandment in
[47:55] the law
[47:57] and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[47:58] the Lord thy God with all thy heart all
[48:01] thy Soul all thy
[48:03] mind this is the first and great
[48:07] commandment but Jesus doesn't stop there
[48:10] he says and the second is like un to it
[48:13] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[48:16] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[48:19] I pray the Lord would that his Blessing
[48:20] to the word you may be
[48:24] seated the scribes had determined that
[48:27] of the 613 Commandments in the Old
[48:31] Testament 248 were positive and 365 were
[48:37] negative and they had this debate among
[48:39] themselves of what was the great
[48:41] commandment what what was the one that
[48:44] uh would uh would be the one that uh
[48:47] could go at the top of the list
[48:49] and and it was they kind of knew what
[48:53] the greatest one was but they didn't
[48:54] know the order
[48:56] and so they ask Jesus trying to get him
[48:58] in
[48:59] trouble and when they ask him he
[49:02] responds with what's known as the Shima
[49:04] or Deuteronomy 64 I want us to go to
[49:07] that tonight Deuteronomy
[49:09] 6:4 and this is where jesus takes this
[49:12] from he says here o Israel the Lord our
[49:15] God is one Lord how many believe that
[49:18] tonight he is one Lord and thou shalt
[49:22] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[49:25] with all thy soul with all thy
[49:28] might and these words which I command
[49:31] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[49:34] Thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[49:36] thy children shall talk of them when
[49:38] thou sest in thine house when thou west
[49:41] by the way when thou liest down when
[49:44] thou risest up Thou shalt bind them for
[49:47] a sign upon thine hand they shall be as
[49:50] frontless between Thine Eyes Thou shalt
[49:52] write them upon the post of thy house
[49:55] and on the gates and the Pharisees knew
[49:59] this uh they knew that this was the
[50:02] greatest of The
[50:04] Commandments but they were tempting him
[50:06] to see if he would agree uh with them in
[50:09] that they they they put it literally
[50:12] between their eyes they put it on their
[50:14] doorpost they put it uh they put it all
[50:17] around them they knew that this was the
[50:19] great commandment they put it in a a
[50:21] little box that they fastened on their
[50:23] doorpost they wrote it out and put on
[50:25] their felies the the pouches that they
[50:28] wore on their foreheads in obedience to
[50:30] the command to keep the word always on
[50:31] their minds not sure that's exactly what
[50:34] it meant but that's what they did so
[50:36] they literally kept it on their minds
[50:38] and and and and they they it would have
[50:40] been no surprise to them that Jesus
[50:42] named that Deuteronomy 6:4 as the
[50:45] greatest commandment but then he goes on
[50:48] he doesn't stop he said the second is
[50:50] likened to it or linked to it he said
[50:53] Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor
[50:56] as thyself now I want to say tonight
[51:00] that unless you love God you can't love
[51:03] your neighbor in the right way it takes
[51:05] a special kind of love to be able to do
[51:09] it the way that God wants us to do it
[51:12] and so we have to love God first or we
[51:14] can't love our neighbor as ourselves so
[51:17] this comes from Leviticus
[51:20] 1916 which I'm going to start in verse
[51:23] 16 uh where he's talking about the way
[51:26] we treat one another and he says this he
[51:28] said Thou shalt not go up and down as a
[51:31] tail Bearer among thy people he said
[51:33] neither shalt thou stand against the
[51:35] blood of Thy Neighbor In other words he
[51:37] said Thou shalt not go up and down as a
[51:39] TA as a tail Bearer and that word is
[51:41] actually a peddler that's the Jewish
[51:43] word for for Peddler it's applied to the
[51:46] person who deals uh in information and
[51:50] so they they say something like this
[51:51] well did you hear what I heard and so
[51:53] they're always one uping somebody on
[51:55] information he said don't do that and
[51:58] then he says don't stand against the
[51:59] blood of Thy Neighbor uh in other words
[52:01] don't give a false witness he said I am
[52:04] the Lord so he's reminding them that
[52:07] that that he is God and that you
[52:08] shouldn't do these things so verse 17 he
[52:11] said Thou shalt not hate thy brother in
[52:14] thine
[52:15] heart now this is important because it's
[52:17] got to be from the heart remember when
[52:19] Jesus we've talked about forgiveness he
[52:21] said if you don't forgive from the heart
[52:24] every man sinner or Saint right brother
[52:29] bam takes that and says if you don't uh
[52:31] if you don't forgive every man sinner or
[52:33] Saint said you're in danger of
[52:34] Hellfire right and Jesus said you can't
[52:37] be forgiven if you don't forgive right
[52:40] right and so this is what he's saying
[52:42] you you shall not hate thy brother in
[52:44] thine heart you got to forgive from the
[52:47] heart and we've talked about that how do
[52:49] you know brother Ben how do I know I've
[52:50] forgiven from my heart well it just
[52:52] don't come up anymore right you're not
[52:54] rehashed ing it all the time youve
[52:56] forgiven from your heart if you do if
[52:58] the memory comes up you don't dwell on
[53:01] it anymore you've forgiven that person
[53:04] so now uh so you shall not hate your
[53:07] brother in your heart Thou shalt no no
[53:09] this is kind of a strange ter Thou shalt
[53:12] in any wise rebuke Thy Neighbor now
[53:15] there's a good one and uh I think Jason
[53:18] was you the one that said that you
[53:20] didn't like getting woke up woke up in
[53:21] the morning by your dad is he loud in
[53:23] the morning is that very loud in the
[53:24] morning that's right so you know the
[53:27] scripture says don't go he said he that
[53:30] uh protests loudly in the morning and
[53:32] and worships the Lord loudly he said
[53:34] that'll that blesses his neighbor loudly
[53:37] he said it'll be a curse to
[53:39] him so that's that's true but in this
[53:43] case he's saying rebuke your
[53:45] neighbor all right you know the Bible
[53:47] says that thou shalt in any wise rebuke
[53:51] thy
[53:52] neighbor and not suffer sin upon him
[53:56] now what he's saying is instead of
[53:58] holding it in your heart and keeping it
[54:00] against the person take care of it deal
[54:04] with the problem right right and so we
[54:06] we want to make sure that we do that now
[54:09] now he said don't suffer sin upon if you
[54:11] see something that that is going to hurt
[54:13] him then talk about it and and Proverbs
[54:16] tells us uh the same Proverbs 27:5 he
[54:19] said open rebuke is better than secret
[54:22] love right and Jesus deals with this as
[54:25] well and how it operates within the
[54:27] church setting he's dealing specifically
[54:29] with the local church I hope I'm not
[54:30] boring you tonight but just hang with me
[54:32] for a little bit but in in the local
[54:34] church Jesus talks about this Matthew
[54:37] 18:16 he he talks about how he said If
[54:40] thy brother shall trespass against thee
[54:42] so somebody did something wrong to you
[54:44] he said go and tell him his fault
[54:46] between thee and him alone if he shall
[54:48] hear thee thou H has gain thy brother
[54:51] now this does not mean that if a pastor
[54:53] is dealing with an issue that he can't
[54:55] warn the Sheep just because it's
[54:57] something he hasn't talked to the person
[54:59] about you don't always get to talk
[55:02] directly to the person that you're
[55:04] dealing with and and you say well how
[55:06] does that work well look at Paul with
[55:08] the Corinthians Paul writes a letter of
[55:10] First Corinthians to them and he
[55:12] actually tells them I heard of of those
[55:15] of the House of Khloe that there's
[55:17] contentions among you he said and and
[55:19] then he wrote and deals with the
[55:20] contentions that he's just heard about
[55:23] how can he do that and keep this
[55:24] scripture it's because he's a he's a
[55:27] pastor in a in a fiduciary he has a
[55:30] responsibility to the church to deal
[55:32] with the issues and the things uh that
[55:34] are that come up like that and so that's
[55:37] not a hindrance to that and in doing
[55:40] that but it is a a a command to us that
[55:43] if someone in the local church if
[55:45] there's a problem between me and them I
[55:47] need to go to them directly and deal
[55:49] with
[55:50] it right go and tell him his fault
[55:52] between thee and him alone if he shall
[55:54] hear thee thou H has gained thy brother
[55:56] is that wonderful but if you will not
[55:58] hear thee then take with thee one or two
[56:00] more than in the mouth of two or three
[56:01] Witnesses every word may be established
[56:04] if he shall neglect to hear them tell it
[56:05] to the church but if you won't hear the
[56:06] church let him be into the as a heathen
[56:08] man and a Publican brandom deals with
[56:10] that this way and I'm doing this for a
[56:12] reason tonight just laying a groundwork
[56:13] for what we want to say he said if I
[56:15] knew tonight that I had an enemy I may
[56:17] have I perhaps have but if I do I don't
[56:19] know just who it is if it was I sure
[56:20] wouldn't go to preach and went first and
[56:22] made that right see if I could get it
[56:24] straightened up because we're not
[56:25] supposed to have anything against anyone
[56:28] I wonder if we could live that way we we
[56:30] don't want to have anything against
[56:31] anyone we just want to maintain our our
[56:34] Clarity we want to be able to pray
[56:36] through when we're called upon to pray
[56:38] we we want to just be have a clear uh
[56:40] Avenue between us and God so we don't
[56:42] want nothing between us and our brothers
[56:44] so so he says if if I could get it
[56:46] straightened up we're not supposed to
[56:47] have anything against anyone let no one
[56:50] if we or if anything we can do let no
[56:52] one have anything against us he said and
[56:55] it don't say if you have ought against
[56:56] the brother but if the brother has ought
[56:58] against you see go to him see if he has
[57:00] the ought and that way he said why we
[57:02] live peaceful what we're doing is
[57:04] fulfilling the command of Romans 12:18
[57:07] where Paul says if it be possible as
[57:09] much as lith in you live peaceably with
[57:12] all men what he's telling you is that
[57:14] it's not possible with all men but
[57:16] everyone that it is possible with try to
[57:19] do it do your best to live at peace with
[57:22] all men and there will be some that you
[57:23] can't do it but you done your part
[57:26] right so I I want to continue then with
[57:29] Leviticus 19 cuz we didn't even get to
[57:31] loving your neighbor
[57:33] yet we got to rebuking your
[57:36] neighbor he said but Thou shalt not
[57:39] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[57:42] children of thy people that's a
[57:44] commandment
[57:45] Church said but Thou shalt love thy
[57:49] neighbor as
[57:51] thyself he said he reminds him again I
[57:53] am the Lord
[57:55] so he's telling them if you love me he
[57:58] said if you love me you'll love your
[58:00] neighbor as yourself now who is your
[58:05] neighbor and this maybe take a little
[58:07] bit different turn than what maybe we're
[58:09] expecting tonight but I just want to get
[58:10] it in here who's your neighbor Luke 10:
[58:13] 25 uh Jesus again is being asked a
[58:16] question for the wrong reasons he lawyer
[58:19] stood up and tempted him saying Master
[58:22] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[58:24] and he said unto him what is written in
[58:25] the law how readest thou and he
[58:27] answering said Thou shalt love the Lord
[58:29] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[58:31] soul with all thy strength with all thy
[58:33] mind and thy neighbor as thyself this
[58:35] lawyer got it right maybe he heard Jesus
[58:38] talk about it maybe he maybe he just
[58:40] repeating what he'd heard but he got it
[58:42] right and Jesus said to him thou has
[58:45] answered right this do and thou shalt
[58:48] live but he willing to justify himself
[58:53] said to Jesus who who is my neighbor on
[58:56] so in other words there's someone that
[58:58] he's thinking about that that he's not
[59:01] treated right and so he's trying to
[59:03] justify himself and saying well you know
[59:06] not everybody's my neighbor so Jesus
[59:09] answering said a certain man went down
[59:11] from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among
[59:14] Thieves which stripped him of his
[59:16] reignment and wounded him and departed
[59:19] leaving him half dead and by chance
[59:22] there came down a certain priest that
[59:23] way and when he saw him he passed by on
[59:26] the other side and likewise a levite
[59:28] when he was at the place came and looked
[59:30] on him and passed by on the other side I
[59:32] wonder how many of us would pass by on
[59:34] the other
[59:35] side but look what he says but a certain
[59:38] Samaritan as he journeyed came where he
[59:40] was and when he saw him he had
[59:43] compassion on him I want you to notice
[59:45] that word compassion he said he went to
[59:48] him bowed up his wounds pouring in oil
[59:51] and wine and set him on his own beast
[59:53] and brought him to an end and took care
[59:55] of him and on the marrow when he
[59:57] departed he took out two pence and gave
[59:59] them to the host and said to him take
[1:00:01] care of him and whatsoever thou spendest
[1:00:03] more when I come again I will repay thee
[1:00:06] he said which now of these three
[1:00:07] thinkest thou now he says the levite the
[1:00:10] priest or the Samaritan which one of
[1:00:13] these three was neighbor unto him that
[1:00:15] fell among the thieves and he said he
[1:00:17] that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus
[1:00:19] unto him go and do thou likewise that's
[1:00:23] a great commandment now
[1:00:25] we believe that a prophet came in our
[1:00:27] day to bring light to the current day on
[1:00:30] the scripture how many believe that a
[1:00:32] prophet was telling us how to apply the
[1:00:35] scripture in our day because I know a
[1:00:36] lot of times when we think about
[1:00:38] Brotherly Love or when we think about
[1:00:40] loving our neighbor we think about
[1:00:42] helping the the guy on the street
[1:00:44] helping the homeless and things like
[1:00:45] that and that is a part of it that is
[1:00:48] part of what we can do but it's not our
[1:00:50] main
[1:00:51] responsibility as it as it pertains to
[1:00:53] loving our neighbor because we we were
[1:00:55] it was explained to us by a prophet what
[1:00:58] this Parable means and how it applies to
[1:01:01] our day listen to this he said Jerusalem
[1:01:04] sits on a hill Jericho sits in the
[1:01:06] valley and the Good Samaritan found a
[1:01:09] man coming from Jerusalem down to
[1:01:11] Jericho when he fell among Thieves think
[1:01:13] of it he was
[1:01:15] backsliding now think about it for a
[1:01:17] minute he was not he was not somebody
[1:01:19] who just had lost his way and lost his
[1:01:22] job although it would be good to help
[1:01:24] somebody who lost his job but here was a
[1:01:27] man who was
[1:01:28] backsliding and and I think we ought to
[1:01:31] think first of a spiritual condition of
[1:01:34] a person because everything else
[1:01:36] everything else uh will change we could
[1:01:39] give I thought of that when I went to
[1:01:40] Togo and and and went to West Africa and
[1:01:43] I've looked at the people and I could
[1:01:45] start handing out money and and I could
[1:01:47] hand out money till the end of time but
[1:01:49] I've realized that I can only do so much
[1:01:50] good if you took a billion dollars and
[1:01:53] handed it out on the street in that
[1:01:54] country tomorrow would be gone and
[1:01:56] they'd be back in the same
[1:01:58] condition so helping people brother the
[1:02:00] trip is not always just just helping the
[1:02:03] the poor man on the side of the street
[1:02:04] although that would be a good thing to
[1:02:06] do it's not always even helping your
[1:02:08] friends and relatives but it's watching
[1:02:09] for an opportunity when someone is a
[1:02:12] backslider when someone is is down when
[1:02:15] someone is not doing well spiritually to
[1:02:18] try to help them to come back to the
[1:02:20] house of God right sir good so can we
[1:02:23] look at it that way way now I wonder if
[1:02:26] we really love our neighbor I wonder if
[1:02:28] we really do and and I want I want to
[1:02:30] love my neighbor I want to be well
[1:02:31] everything don't you want to be
[1:02:33] everything God wants you to be oh that's
[1:02:35] the Cry of my heart I I want to be
[1:02:37] everything that God wants me to be I
[1:02:38] don't want for a moment to just to be a
[1:02:40] Halfway Christian I don't believe this
[1:02:42] is the hour for that as brother Stuart
[1:02:44] last time he preached it's not the time
[1:02:45] to play church it's the time to be a
[1:02:47] real Christian it's a time to it's time
[1:02:49] to go home it's time for a
[1:02:51] rapture we don't have time to play with
[1:02:53] these things things some things are more
[1:02:56] important than money amen right we got
[1:02:59] to take care of our our kids and our
[1:03:00] young people some things are more
[1:03:01] important than money some's more
[1:03:03] important than uh than even work
[1:03:05] although that's important but there's
[1:03:07] some things more important and we got to
[1:03:09] realize that now now look again brother
[1:03:13] brandom says think of it he was backside
[1:03:14] and coming from the Heavenly to the
[1:03:16] cursed he said Jericho is a cursed City
[1:03:19] Jerusalem is a blessed City he was on
[1:03:22] his road backsliding when he fell among
[1:03:23] Thieves and Rob that stripped him he
[1:03:25] said and that's when you'll fall among
[1:03:26] Thieves and robbers when you start
[1:03:28] backsliding away from God just expect
[1:03:31] the enemy to be along the
[1:03:33] road right so when you get out of church
[1:03:36] when you get away from the message of
[1:03:37] the hour when you get away from God's
[1:03:39] people you begin to Backside you begin
[1:03:41] to get among Thieves and
[1:03:43] robbers now he said you know Jesus found
[1:03:46] a man one time in a parable was on his
[1:03:48] road from Jerusalem to Jericho showed he
[1:03:50] was back siding he was going up from
[1:03:53] high going down low he was a backside
[1:03:56] and he met him on the road and an enemy
[1:03:58] had beaten him and robbed him and left
[1:04:00] him half dead I love the way a prophet
[1:04:02] didn't leave any stone unturned he said
[1:04:04] that was physically alive spiritually
[1:04:07] dead yes so here was a man he was on the
[1:04:11] side of the road and the the Good
[1:04:12] Samaritan found him he was physically
[1:04:15] alive but spiritually he was dead and
[1:04:18] when he found him in that condition he
[1:04:20] didn't just leave him in that condition
[1:04:22] but he brought him to a place he can get
[1:04:24] some
[1:04:26] help amen and so he said the priests and
[1:04:30] the Levites and so forth pass him but
[1:04:32] the Good Samaritan as Jesus taught it
[1:04:33] came picked him up poured oil and wine
[1:04:36] and take him to the end notice he poured
[1:04:38] in oil and wine oil
[1:04:40] heals but wine
[1:04:43] Burns right if you had an open wound and
[1:04:47] then you poured wine into it guess what
[1:04:49] you're going to hurt yeah but what it
[1:04:51] does what it does is it burns burns out
[1:04:55] the
[1:04:56] infection it burns out the sometimes you
[1:04:58] got to tell people stuff they don't want
[1:05:00] to hear but we're trying to burn out the
[1:05:02] infection we're not trying to hurt you
[1:05:04] we're just trying to take care of that
[1:05:05] infection we don't want it to
[1:05:08] spread so we got to pour in oil that's
[1:05:11] part of it isn't it we must have the
[1:05:13] Holy Spirit in our services we must have
[1:05:16] the Holy Spirit in our preaching but we
[1:05:17] got to pour in the
[1:05:19] wine right there's got to be a word
[1:05:22] there too of stimulation revelation now
[1:05:24] the B said there's the place I want to
[1:05:26] get to you he taken him to the in and
[1:05:29] said to the caretaker take care of him
[1:05:31] yeah he give him a couple of pennies or
[1:05:33] whatever it was to pay his way and said
[1:05:36] now if he needs any more just go ahead
[1:05:38] and take care of him I'll make it right
[1:05:39] when I
[1:05:40] come and he said now you Shepherds God
[1:05:44] give you the spirit and the word to take
[1:05:47] care of these wounded ones that's been
[1:05:49] brought in and I've thought brother
[1:05:51] brother JT what what do I have to help
[1:05:54] help people with because that's the
[1:05:56] desire of my heart I want to help people
[1:05:58] but what's the best way I can help
[1:05:59] people the best thing I can do to help
[1:06:01] people although I will give to people
[1:06:03] and do and try to do the best I can in
[1:06:05] that way but the best way we can help
[1:06:07] people is with the things that we were
[1:06:09] given to help people with and what I was
[1:06:12] given as a pastor to help people with is
[1:06:14] the spirit and the
[1:06:17] word right that's what I was given come
[1:06:20] on that's the two pence aren't you glad
[1:06:23] for a prophet in this day yeah look he
[1:06:27] said it's two pence now he said if you
[1:06:29] need any more he said he'll take care of
[1:06:32] that when he comes so just feed those
[1:06:35] Sheep amen oh I hope I take that as a
[1:06:38] command tonight just feed those sheep
[1:06:40] that's my job if you want to help people
[1:06:43] now now now watch how the Good Samaritan
[1:06:45] helps them he doesn't help them by he
[1:06:48] doesn't help him by by taking him in
[1:06:50] necessarily into his own home he doesn't
[1:06:53] help him by uh by getting married to him
[1:06:56] he doesn't help him by uh by by giving
[1:06:59] him money he doesn't help him by doing
[1:07:01] any those things how does he help him he
[1:07:02] takes him to the place where he knows
[1:07:05] there's a place an in that's the church
[1:07:07] take him to the church and let the
[1:07:09] pastor pour in the oil and the wine let
[1:07:12] the pastor take the two pence of Spirit
[1:07:14] and the word and help him out see what
[1:07:16] what we're doing we we ought to we ought
[1:07:18] to be like that little girl that went
[1:07:19] out there remember the little girl that
[1:07:21] got got kidnapped by the Assyrians and
[1:07:23] she gets out by herself and and she
[1:07:25] comes to the house of a man named non
[1:07:27] the leper and she gets down there all by
[1:07:29] herself but she had a testimony she said
[1:07:32] would God you went to my church she said
[1:07:34] if you were back in my country we have a
[1:07:37] prophet where where you there's healing
[1:07:39] there's a place there and brother brand
[1:07:40] said that she invited him to church and
[1:07:42] that's the way we ought to be even at
[1:07:44] work or wherever we're at we ought to
[1:07:45] say we have a church where there's a
[1:07:47] love for people and a love for God
[1:07:49] there's a place there where you can go
[1:07:51] and you can get the help that you need
[1:07:54] yes amen see so many times we want to do
[1:07:56] it ourselves and we try to we try to
[1:07:58] meddle in so many things in people's
[1:08:00] lives and it just not a good idea just
[1:08:03] bring them to the church bring them to
[1:08:04] the pastor let him take care of it take
[1:08:07] care of him now he said we can only as a
[1:08:11] Good Samaritan bring them to the end and
[1:08:13] the Lord told the inkeeper take care of
[1:08:15] him give him so many pence and said if
[1:08:17] he wants anything give it to him when I
[1:08:19] return I'll make it good with you he
[1:08:22] said I'm sure God will do that when he
[1:08:24] makes it good with his pastors at the
[1:08:26] coming of the Lord
[1:08:29] Jesus there's coming a reckoning day and
[1:08:31] I'm glad for that I'm glad for that I'm
[1:08:34] glad there's coming a day look brother
[1:08:37] brand was at the end of a
[1:08:40] meeting at the end of a meeting and he
[1:08:42] said a Good Samaritan come by and poured
[1:08:45] oil in the wound he's talking about it
[1:08:46] the healing Revival aren't you glad for
[1:08:48] a good meeting don't you like a good
[1:08:50] meeting when you can feel the presence
[1:08:52] of God and the Good Samaritan comes back
[1:08:53] by she glad for a good church service
[1:08:55] when you just feel the presence of God
[1:08:57] and a Good Samaritan comes by but now he
[1:09:00] poured oil in the wound he said but he's
[1:09:02] took you now and he wants to go to one
[1:09:04] of the ends here the closest to you he
[1:09:07] said he's done paid the pastor to take
[1:09:09] care of you I like this he said he's
[1:09:12] paid the pastor to take care of you he's
[1:09:14] paid he received the Holy Ghost got
[1:09:16] blessings of God and health and
[1:09:18] Revelation he can just feed your soul
[1:09:20] yes sir do we believe it tonight that's
[1:09:23] the best thing we could do for people is
[1:09:24] get them to the house of God and if they
[1:09:26] won't hear the word they can't get help
[1:09:28] right brother B said how you going to
[1:09:29] get washed if you won't sit under the
[1:09:31] spout right you can't be washed if you
[1:09:33] won't sit under the word yeah and so but
[1:09:36] that's the best thing we can do to help
[1:09:38] people he said so you come down and join
[1:09:40] one of the churches it'll be the best
[1:09:41] thing you can do to keep your spirit fed
[1:09:43] and moving on Amen good he said again
[1:09:46] remember the Good Samaritan that found
[1:09:47] the man wounded he brought him to the
[1:09:49] end that's the church and he gave the
[1:09:51] man there two pence and told him if you
[1:09:53] needed anymore he'd pay him when he come
[1:09:56] so he's got two pence he's able to
[1:09:57] doctor you up if he's a man of God you
[1:10:00] believe that tonight yes if he's a man
[1:10:02] of God that stands on the word of God
[1:10:04] he's got what God give him and today
[1:10:05] people want to do away with preaching
[1:10:07] want to do away with pastors but a
[1:10:08] prophet of God said that if he's a man
[1:10:10] of God he can take care of
[1:10:13] you he's got what God give him the
[1:10:15] spirit and the word is that right he
[1:10:17] said how is it we're to Worship in
[1:10:19] spirit and in truth and the word is the
[1:10:21] truth
[1:10:22] good again the said well now I want to
[1:10:24] ask you what about you when you get all
[1:10:25] messed up in trouble don't you go to
[1:10:27] your pastor is that right you should do
[1:10:29] it now again I've never want to depry I
[1:10:32] don't want to be a part of your business
[1:10:34] but if you if you need me that's what
[1:10:35] I'm here for that's what I'm here for if
[1:10:38] you need me you got a question to ask I
[1:10:40] I'm the one to ask the question because
[1:10:43] there's something God's given me that
[1:10:45] responsibility and I may not always be
[1:10:47] right but God did give me the spirit and
[1:10:50] the word to help you out and and I trust
[1:10:52] that I trust that you got confidence
[1:10:54] enough to be able to do that now he said
[1:10:56] if you get in trouble you should go to
[1:10:57] your brother and tell him say brother I
[1:10:58] did something wrong I shouldn't have did
[1:11:00] that I pray you to help me now to pray
[1:11:01] through till I get over this thing or or
[1:11:03] help me in my troubles he said isn't
[1:11:05] that the scriptural way to do it well
[1:11:07] that's because he's your pastor he's
[1:11:08] your Shepherd he's the one who gives the
[1:11:10] food out to you to eat and he knows how
[1:11:12] to feed his sheep that God and the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit has made him oversteer over the
[1:11:15] flock to watch over them and take care
[1:11:17] of them that's what he's for oh I tell
[1:11:19] you what we ought to have confidence in
[1:11:21] the men of God that God sets in front of
[1:11:23] us right that that we're going to hear
[1:11:25] something that'll help
[1:11:26] us when when they preach the word of
[1:11:30] God and and brother Bram talked about
[1:11:32] how if a pastor sees a sheep eating Loco
[1:11:34] weed he said he'll he'll drive him away
[1:11:37] from it yeah because he he'll Jerk it
[1:11:40] away from him as quickly as possible he
[1:11:42] said and a a real Pastor a real servant
[1:11:44] of Christ will be a poor example of
[1:11:46] Christ see the sheep eat something
[1:11:48] that's going to drive him away or make
[1:11:49] him an outlaw before God a breaker of
[1:11:51] his word a breaker of his Commandments
[1:11:53] you shouldn't do that you should watch
[1:11:54] that very closely listen that's my
[1:11:56] responsibility and I've got to do that
[1:11:59] but I want to help people in the right
[1:12:00] way I want to love my neighbor don't you
[1:12:02] want to love your neighbor if you want
[1:12:03] to love your neighbor bring them to the
[1:12:05] spirit and the word bring them to the
[1:12:07] message of the hour I believe the
[1:12:09] prophet in our day was given was given
[1:12:11] two pence I believe he had the spirit in
[1:12:13] the word to give to us aren't you glad
[1:12:15] for that amen I believe we're in the end
[1:12:19] I believe we're in a place where we can
[1:12:21] be
[1:12:21] healed that's good we want to help
[1:12:24] people in the right way in Jude 20 let's
[1:12:25] look at this
[1:12:27] now Jude verse
[1:12:29] 20 but you beloved building up
[1:12:31] yourselves on your Most Holy Faith
[1:12:33] praying in the Holy Ghost keep
[1:12:36] yourselves in the love of God looking
[1:12:39] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:42] unto eternal life yeah now look so he
[1:12:45] said keep yourself in the love of God
[1:12:48] now he tells you how to do that now love
[1:12:50] God love your neighbor he's going to
[1:12:53] tell you how to love your neighbor or
[1:12:54] some have compassion making a difference
[1:12:58] you believe compassion makes a
[1:13:00] difference others save with fear pulling
[1:13:04] them out of the fire now he does he's
[1:13:05] not saying save them by making them
[1:13:08] fearful that's not what he's saying at
[1:13:10] all he's saying you be
[1:13:12] afraid you have reverence you have fear
[1:13:16] because there's some things you can't be
[1:13:18] a part of you can't be a partaker of
[1:13:21] some have compassion making a difference
[1:13:23] others saved with fear pulling them out
[1:13:26] of the fire listen if you get in fire
[1:13:28] you're flamable
[1:13:31] too right so if someone's in fire you
[1:13:34] got to pull them carefully out of the
[1:13:36] fire cuz you can't do them any good if
[1:13:39] you're in the fire with
[1:13:40] them so he said pull them out of the
[1:13:43] fire hating even the Garment spotted by
[1:13:45] the flesh make sure you don't become a
[1:13:47] partaker in these things laying in the
[1:13:49] gutter with them doesn't help them the
[1:13:51] Good Samaritan didn't lay down there
[1:13:52] with him and and that's the modern
[1:13:54] politics of the day let's just lay down
[1:13:56] there with them and be a part of what
[1:13:57] they're doing no I believe anybody can
[1:13:59] be saved but you got to want to be saved
[1:14:01] you got to be willing to go to the end
[1:14:03] and get something from
[1:14:05] God
[1:14:09] Amen now again Galatians
[1:14:13] 61 do you love the word I I just have to
[1:14:16] go always go back to the scriptures and
[1:14:18] to the message of the hour it's all I've
[1:14:20] got it's all I've got it's the spirit
[1:14:21] and the word and I trust it's enough for
[1:14:23] us amen if a man be overtaken in a
[1:14:26] fault you which are spiritual restore
[1:14:29] such a one in the spirit of meekness now
[1:14:31] watch considering
[1:14:33] thyself lest thou also be
[1:14:37] tempted and now watch verse Two Bear you
[1:14:39] one another's burdens and so fulfill law
[1:14:42] of Christ that word burdens there is
[1:14:44] varos or weights something too heavy to
[1:14:46] carry alone there are things we need
[1:14:49] help with right and it's okay to ask for
[1:14:52] help when you need help that's what
[1:14:54] we're here for it's okay to ask for help
[1:14:57] when you need help something too heavy
[1:15:00] to carry a loone verse three for if a
[1:15:02] man think himself to be something when
[1:15:03] he's nothing he deceiveth himself now
[1:15:07] watch but but now he kind of turns it
[1:15:09] around he said but let every man prove
[1:15:11] his own work and then shall he have
[1:15:13] rejoicing in himself alone and not in
[1:15:16] another for every man shall bear his own
[1:15:19] burden now that seems like a direct
[1:15:20] contradiction but in the original the
[1:15:22] two words are are completely different
[1:15:24] words the words translated B the word
[1:15:26] translated burdens in verse two is a
[1:15:29] completely different word from the word
[1:15:31] translated burden in verse 5 which the
[1:15:33] word in verse five means a a foron a
[1:15:36] pack carried by a soldier so there's
[1:15:39] something that you were designed to
[1:15:42] carry right there there's a burden of
[1:15:44] life that you were designed to carry and
[1:15:46] you can do it if you're a a husband you
[1:15:49] can be the right kind of a husband if
[1:15:52] you're a wife if you're a a child if
[1:15:54] you're a pastor whatever the burden it
[1:15:56] is of Life you've been given see before
[1:15:58] they send a soldier out to carry a pack
[1:16:00] they make sure they they they they fill
[1:16:02] it up and I've always wondered how in
[1:16:04] the world could they carry them 50 or 70
[1:16:06] pound packs on their back I'm sure
[1:16:07] you've done that brother the bill and
[1:16:08] I've always wonder why in the world
[1:16:10] would they give them something that
[1:16:11] heavy to carry but before they sent them
[1:16:13] out somebody else carried it before you
[1:16:15] did yes right somebody else had already
[1:16:17] carried that pack so God don't give you
[1:16:19] more than you can bear so there's
[1:16:21] something you can do in your life you
[1:16:23] don't have to spend all of your life in
[1:16:25] the church just having people take care
[1:16:26] of you right there's a pack that you can
[1:16:29] carry there's something that you can do
[1:16:30] and so he said every man shall bear his
[1:16:33] own fortos his own fortune his own his
[1:16:36] own pack yeah right God's given you but
[1:16:39] he said my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:16:41] light aren't you glad for
[1:16:43] that he said now now I want you
[1:16:47] to we want to be good to people don't we
[1:16:50] yeah we want to make sure we have the
[1:16:52] kind of love that that that that sticks
[1:16:56] give them something that's good yeah
[1:16:58] give them something that's right cuz we
[1:17:00] want to help people but brother brandham
[1:17:03] talked to a man named Merlin anthon and
[1:17:06] I know a little bit about this story
[1:17:08] because uh my former Pastor was personal
[1:17:11] Friends With Merlin
[1:17:13] anthon and he told me about it and
[1:17:16] brother Bram didn't know him at the time
[1:17:19] but he speaks to him directly and
[1:17:21] brother Anthony wants to be ordained as
[1:17:23] a minister in the
[1:17:25] message and he come from a group called
[1:17:27] The Salvation Army that's the ones that
[1:17:29] have the kettles and ring the bells you
[1:17:31] know outside of Walmart and brother
[1:17:34] Bandon tells him this he said now
[1:17:35] brother we know that you're coming from
[1:17:36] a great group of people Salvation Army
[1:17:39] they're great people he said but the
[1:17:41] Salvation Army does a great work out on
[1:17:43] the street we can say nothing against
[1:17:45] the Nazarene the Pentecostal Church the
[1:17:46] Salvation Army or any of them he said
[1:17:48] they're our Brethren but you see we
[1:17:50] believe we're carriers of a great
[1:17:52] message for this very hour that we're
[1:17:54] living in we've got something more to do
[1:17:59] right we've got something greater to get
[1:18:01] yeah than the Salvation Army does they
[1:18:03] do a great work we were talking about St
[1:18:05] Judes and what a great work they do for
[1:18:06] kids earlier they do a great work and if
[1:18:09] you got extra to give them that's fine
[1:18:11] but there's something about what we do
[1:18:13] as Believers we're carrying a great
[1:18:15] message there's only so many other us so
[1:18:18] we try to give and I get questions
[1:18:20] sometimes and we've got our mission
[1:18:21] report now on the back wall and our our
[1:18:24] yearly report and that's what made me
[1:18:25] think of this as we were going through
[1:18:27] that and you know we give most of our
[1:18:30] our money and our attention towards the
[1:18:32] ministry and towards bringing people in
[1:18:34] I give away more than I keep myself but
[1:18:36] I try to give it to foreign missions and
[1:18:38] I try to give it to people coming in and
[1:18:40] and and ministers that come in and help
[1:18:42] you there's a reason for that I'd love
[1:18:44] to pay all your bills I I'd love to be
[1:18:46] able to do that I I I if you have a need
[1:18:49] I you know I'm not afraid to help you
[1:18:51] I'd love to help you but but that's not
[1:18:53] primarily what I'm called to do
[1:18:55] primarily what I'm called to do is pack
[1:18:58] this message that's my that's my
[1:19:00] burden sir and that's what he told
[1:19:03] Merlin anthon to do he said he said
[1:19:06] we're not called to what Salvation Army
[1:19:08] is he says we're carriers of a great
[1:19:10] message he said you want to do that with
[1:19:13] us and brother Anthony said amen amen
[1:19:15] right now something interesting about
[1:19:16] brother Anthony he's gone to be with the
[1:19:18] Lord now he's a good man but way I
[1:19:20] understand is he never did really get
[1:19:21] over that he was always trying to always
[1:19:24] trying to do the Salvation Army thing
[1:19:26] and it just don't work in the message of
[1:19:28] the hour we're doing something different
[1:19:29] we're called to a different age they
[1:19:31] have their place and there will be
[1:19:33] rewards for that and there will be
[1:19:35] blessings for that but God called us to
[1:19:37] something else we carry a message Jesus
[1:19:41] at the pool of Bethesda and I want to
[1:19:42] get to this before I close and we'll
[1:19:44] close if you just bear with me for a
[1:19:48] moment Jesus at Bethesda brother B said
[1:19:51] he had
[1:19:51] compassion and brother Brandon was
[1:19:55] challenged by the fact that he didn't
[1:19:57] heal everybody and Jesus was challenged
[1:20:01] by the fact that he didn't heal
[1:20:03] everybody and he said in fact at his
[1:20:05] trial they brought this up against Jesus
[1:20:08] that he was uh brother brandom said that
[1:20:11] they brought this up that well you went
[1:20:12] down to Bethesda and didn't heal the
[1:20:13] sick but he did heal one
[1:20:16] man right at the pool of Bethesda but
[1:20:19] they said well you had no compassion or
[1:20:20] you would have healed them all but
[1:20:22] brother brand said people don't know
[1:20:23] what compassion is all right they mix
[1:20:26] filo love with agapo love he said it's
[1:20:28] two different loves altogether right
[1:20:31] remember when Peter and John were at the
[1:20:33] gate beautiful remember they were
[1:20:35] Pentecostal preachers they didn't have
[1:20:37] any money yeah right that's how we know
[1:20:39] they were Pentecostal preachers so
[1:20:41] they're walking down by the gate
[1:20:42] beautiful and and when they got down
[1:20:44] there and the man is out there for the
[1:20:47] purpose of getting money that he that's
[1:20:49] how he makes his living there's nothing
[1:20:50] wrong with that people give him money
[1:20:52] that's a a good thing but they had
[1:20:54] something more to give him right we want
[1:20:56] to help people when we can help them
[1:20:58] right we should we have responsibility
[1:21:00] but we also have a greater
[1:21:02] responsibility not just to help people
[1:21:04] but to carry this message and you've got
[1:21:07] inside of you eternal life how many
[1:21:09] believe that tonight we have eternal
[1:21:12] life inside of us and what we what
[1:21:13] should we be doing what should our
[1:21:15] primary job be Peter looks at the man
[1:21:18] and he fastened his eyes upon him with
[1:21:19] John and said look on us heyen he gave
[1:21:22] he un to them expecting to receive
[1:21:24] something of them and Peter said Silver
[1:21:27] and Gold Have I None but I have
[1:21:30] something I can give you and I want to
[1:21:32] tell you tonight I don't have much
[1:21:33] silver and gold but I have something I
[1:21:35] can give you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:39] of Nazareth rise up and walk amen we do
[1:21:42] have we do have the power of the of the
[1:21:46] resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] living among us do you believe that
[1:21:50] right amen now we want perfect
[1:21:54] love don't we we have to have perfect
[1:21:58] love if we're going to ever go over
[1:22:00] there right but what is that it's love
[1:22:04] God love God love your neighbor now
[1:22:10] watch 1 John 4:10 says hearing his love
[1:22:13] not that we loved God in other words we
[1:22:14] didn't love him first but that he loved
[1:22:17] us and sent his son to be the
[1:22:19] propitiation for our sins in other words
[1:22:22] he took my
[1:22:23] place that's the
[1:22:25] gospel he said beloved if God so loved
[1:22:28] us we ought also to love one
[1:22:31] another no man has seen God at any time
[1:22:34] if we love one another God dwelleth in
[1:22:36] us and his love now watch is perfected
[1:22:39] yeah in us that's right his love is
[1:22:44] perfected in us that's perfect love if
[1:22:47] you go down to verse 16 he said we have
[1:22:49] known and believed the love that God
[1:22:50] hath to us God is love and he that
[1:22:53] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[1:22:55] in him herein is our love made perfect
[1:22:59] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:23:02] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:23:05] this world there is no fear in love but
[1:23:08] perfect love casteth out fear because
[1:23:11] fear hath torment he that fearth is not
[1:23:14] made perfect in
[1:23:16] love right so fear is Phobos or Terror
[1:23:19] there's no Terror in love we don't we
[1:23:21] don't do what we do because we're going
[1:23:23] to hell or we're afraid we're going to
[1:23:25] go to hell we do what we do because we
[1:23:27] love God because he first loved
[1:23:30] us so uh brother randam taught us that
[1:23:33] then that this perfect love is something
[1:23:36] more than just human love it's a goo
[1:23:38] love or it's something it's something
[1:23:41] higher than FAL love that would cause
[1:23:42] you to just give a handout to your
[1:23:44] neighbor but it's something higher than
[1:23:46] that and actually even the way we love
[1:23:48] our neighbor is even higher than just
[1:23:51] giving them a handout but but it's
[1:23:52] giving them eternal life amen it's
[1:23:55] taking them down to the end and letting
[1:23:57] them see that there's somebody who can
[1:23:59] help them oh I trust we have that kind
[1:24:02] of Love Tonight now look brother Brown
[1:24:05] said anything that had a beginning has
[1:24:06] an end those things which have not a
[1:24:09] beginning has has an end he said did you
[1:24:12] ever think of that God the Great Master
[1:24:14] rainbow in the skies he said with the
[1:24:16] seven spirits of God R perfect love yeah
[1:24:20] he said after that comes feel your love
[1:24:22] from a goo to ailio love he said that's
[1:24:25] the love that you have for your wife I
[1:24:27] think about that I know it's Valentine's
[1:24:29] Day and everybody's ready to get out of
[1:24:30] here and go to the restaurant Ain no
[1:24:32] restaurant's open after we get done but
[1:24:34] go to McDonald's and have your
[1:24:35] Valentine's Day at McDonald's I
[1:24:38] guess but but I was thinking about this
[1:24:41] because he said that's the love you have
[1:24:43] for your wife is filio love there's a
[1:24:45] higher love than that and he explained
[1:24:48] it this way which seems almost
[1:24:50] incredible he said if some man would
[1:24:53] insult her you'd shoot his brains
[1:24:55] out that's fio
[1:24:59] love right don't try it right because a
[1:25:03] lot of us we we we have to have FAL love
[1:25:06] right we need that but we also need
[1:25:09] something more he said see because it
[1:25:11] creates a jealousy that's FAL love
[1:25:14] secondary love he said and then like if
[1:25:17] you come on down from that it gets
[1:25:19] perverted it comes then comes lust for
[1:25:21] another man's wife
[1:25:23] he said then comes filth it becomes
[1:25:24] perverted he said but all this kind of
[1:25:27] love had a beginning right it was
[1:25:29] perverted but when that real genuine
[1:25:32] love of God that I've been talking about
[1:25:33] comes into the human being by the new
[1:25:35] birth being born again it had no
[1:25:37] beginning all and it'll have no
[1:25:40] end right so even in our marriages
[1:25:42] there's something higher that keeps us
[1:25:44] together than even filio love right
[1:25:47] there's a higher commitment oh my
[1:25:49] there's a higher thing that keeps us
[1:25:51] together we're held together by the word
[1:25:53] by the love of God because we love God
[1:25:56] we love our wives because we love God we
[1:25:59] love our neighbor because we love God we
[1:26:01] spread the gospel are you with me now
[1:26:03] because we love God love flows out from
[1:26:06] us because we love God we give
[1:26:08] forgiveness we I don't forgive you
[1:26:09] because I love you I forgive you because
[1:26:12] I love God and that makes me love
[1:26:15] you right so everything flows from that
[1:26:18] genuine love of God it comes from that
[1:26:21] perfect love yes so why he said the
[1:26:23] second commandment was like the first
[1:26:26] one it was linked to it look he said but
[1:26:30] when this real genuine love of God comes
[1:26:32] a human being by the new birth being
[1:26:34] born again you realize if you've been
[1:26:35] born again you have this kind of love
[1:26:37] that I'm talking about why because
[1:26:39] you've been made a partaker of the
[1:26:41] divine nature you said but it's not
[1:26:42] showing through me you just got to yield
[1:26:44] to it you got to give into it let it
[1:26:47] grow in your life let it become what you
[1:26:50] just give into it just surrender to it
[1:26:51] it's there if you've been born again if
[1:26:54] you've got had the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:55] Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:57] in your life you've been sealed by God
[1:26:59] you have the token you have this kind of
[1:27:02] love he said but it has no beginning
[1:27:05] it'll have no end you are then a Son of
[1:27:08] God and a daughter of God your
[1:27:09] affections are in things above right gny
[1:27:12] said feel your love would make you shoot
[1:27:13] a man for insulting your wife gapo love
[1:27:16] would make you pray for his lost soul he
[1:27:20] said that's the difference yes God Bel
[1:27:23] love makes you want what is best for
[1:27:25] others yeah not always what's best for
[1:27:28] you right
[1:27:31] right tell you you young ladies we
[1:27:34] talked about dating and relationships on
[1:27:35] Sunday night if you want a man that
[1:27:38] treats you right make sure it's a man
[1:27:40] that'll put you
[1:27:41] first and and the man that'll put you
[1:27:44] first if if it wasn't right for you to
[1:27:47] be married he wouldn't marry
[1:27:49] you because he loves you more than that
[1:27:52] right brother brand said you have to
[1:27:54] love somebody to the point where if you
[1:27:56] believe they'd be happier with somebody
[1:27:58] else you'd let them
[1:28:00] go when you have that kind of a love
[1:28:04] that means you've you've tapped into
[1:28:05] something else yeah and that's what we
[1:28:08] want yeah because we live in an age when
[1:28:10] when people don't stay together no more
[1:28:12] people don't love each other anymore
[1:28:14] Valentine's Day is just a you know it's
[1:28:16] a it's a madeup holiday anyway but
[1:28:18] they're all made up holidays our
[1:28:19] birthdays are made up right so they're
[1:28:22] all made up but but it's just a made up
[1:28:24] holiday but I'll say this you know we we
[1:28:28] know the kind of love you say well I
[1:28:30] don't have a valentine but you know the
[1:28:31] kind my mom's been kind of put out
[1:28:33] because no one takes her out for
[1:28:35] Valentine's Day but but you know what so
[1:28:37] that's just an advertisement out there I
[1:28:39] guess if somebody wants to do
[1:28:40] that make sure it's
[1:28:44] right she has a son who's a
[1:28:46] pastor
[1:28:49] but but I'll say this you know you may
[1:28:52] feel bad about that but you know what
[1:28:53] kind of love a lot of people don't
[1:28:55] know are you with me tonight you know
[1:28:58] what kind of love a lot of people don't
[1:28:59] know about it's the love of Christ it's
[1:29:02] perfect love sir Soom tells us as
[1:29:05] musicians come tonight brandom tells us
[1:29:08] he said it'll take perfect love thus
[1:29:10] saith the Lord it'll take perfect love
[1:29:13] to put you in that place yeah don't you
[1:29:17] want to go now he said when he got there
[1:29:19] it was a different kind of love it
[1:29:21] wasn't it wasn't a love from a husband
[1:29:24] to a wife like we have now but it was a
[1:29:26] different kind of love you said it was
[1:29:28] far above anything we could ever think
[1:29:30] about you couldn't even describe it he
[1:29:33] said but it'll take perfect love to put
[1:29:35] you in that place that's all there was
[1:29:40] there oh what a blessing he said so
[1:29:43] whatever you do oh this is this is my my
[1:29:46] exhortation to the church tonight does
[1:29:48] this come on my heart actually last week
[1:29:51] a put these things together I the
[1:29:53] exhortation was whatever you do you lay
[1:29:56] aside everything else until you're so
[1:29:59] filled with the love of God you can even
[1:30:01] love those who hate you perfect love
[1:30:04] amen would we would we bow our heads
[1:30:06] together maybe you could pray that way
[1:30:08] Lord Jesus won't you perfect your love
[1:30:11] in me that's how he said love would be
[1:30:14] perfected John said is perfected in
[1:30:18] us and perfect love brother brand said
[1:30:21] real compassion passion was to do the
[1:30:23] will of the
[1:30:24] father so I love God
[1:30:27] first put him first want to do his will
[1:30:31] first I want things to be right first
[1:30:34] then if I really love somebody that'll
[1:30:36] flow out of that so there'll never be a
