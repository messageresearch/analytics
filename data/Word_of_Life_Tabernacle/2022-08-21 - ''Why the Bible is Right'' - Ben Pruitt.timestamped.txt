[48:56] they're going to release it from the
[48:57] hospital today
[48:58] and uh brother jt and them are there
[49:01] with her they're going to bring her home
[49:04] the lord willing today and so we thank
[49:06] god for that and god is no respecter of
[49:09] age i've seen him heal over and over
[49:11] again even
[49:12] even our elderly believers and folks in
[49:15] the church and then sister jean brother
[49:17] robert stayed home with her this morning
[49:19] uh we thought she was passing last
[49:22] sunday and i went up there and sister
[49:24] jean's a fighter she's a warrior and
[49:27] every time she gets real low and to the
[49:29] point where medically that you wouldn't
[49:31] think she'd make it and she always gets
[49:33] back up and so there's a reason for that
[49:35] and we're thankful she's still here
[49:37] still with us and
[49:39] be praying continuing to pray for that
[49:41] family
[49:42] amen first or second timothy chapter 3
[49:44] and verse 14
[49:46] but continue thou and the things which
[49:48] thou hast learned and has been assured
[49:50] of
[49:51] knowing of whom thou hast learned them
[49:54] and that from a child thou has known the
[49:56] holy scriptures
[49:57] which are able to make the wise into
[49:59] salvation
[50:01] through faith which is in christ jesus
[50:04] verse 16 is very important for us
[50:09] it says all scripture
[50:11] is given by inspiration and we've heard
[50:14] it many times that's
[50:16] the god breathe it's the expiration of
[50:18] god that word is god breathed his own
[50:22] word all scripture is given by
[50:24] inspiration of god is profitable
[50:27] for doctrine for reproof for correction
[50:30] for instruction in righteousness
[50:33] that the man of god may be perfect
[50:35] thoroughly furnished unto all
[50:38] good works i pray the lord would add his
[50:40] blessing to the word you may be seated
[50:42] this morning good to have each and every
[50:44] one of you with us today good to have
[50:46] for the white camp back with us we've
[50:48] been praying for your dad as well and
[50:50] we'll talk to you later about that and
[50:52] praying that he's doing okay good to
[50:54] have all of you with us and those that
[50:55] are missing today some are on vacation
[50:58] we miss them today but i'm sure they'll
[50:59] be watching i'm thankful that we have
[51:01] the ability to do that how to stream the
[51:03] services that they can watch i know
[51:05] you're a traveling church you've been
[51:07] traveling all summer and
[51:09] so i'm thankful that people are able to
[51:11] watch the services to keep up
[51:13] amen i believe god's doing something for
[51:16] us and
[51:17] and we're thankful for all of you i want
[51:19] you to be a part of it
[51:21] we've been talking about faith and
[51:23] we must have a foundation for faith
[51:26] there's got to be something i'm going to
[51:28] get real simple on you this morning but
[51:30] i think it'll be good for us there's got
[51:32] to be something that we base our faith
[51:35] on and we could say it this way that
[51:37] faith is
[51:39] not based on anything but what god said
[51:42] it's not based on anything but what god
[51:44] said and we've talked before how the
[51:48] uh the absolute is what god said
[51:50] right it's what god said what has god
[51:53] said
[51:54] and that is our absolute and faith is
[51:56] based on that we found that abraham
[51:59] believed god it was imputed in him for
[52:01] righteousness he believed god that was
[52:03] faith he he grabbed a hold of something
[52:05] he heard the voice of god and then he
[52:07] believed that that was god that spoke
[52:09] and then his words or his works rather
[52:12] showed that he believed that and and so
[52:15] we find that if you don't know what god
[52:17] has said
[52:18] you can't know how to please god
[52:21] how many want to please him this morning
[52:23] that should be all of our desire we want
[52:25] to please god we want to make him happy
[52:28] we we we want to not only to have a god
[52:31] that well god will forgive me but we
[52:33] want to please god and in order to
[52:35] please him we have to know how to please
[52:37] him how are we going to do that with our
[52:39] limited knowledge we cannot find what we
[52:42] need to find out by human reasoning or
[52:44] knowledge or scientific
[52:47] reasoning but we've got to be able and
[52:50] investigation won't get it for us but
[52:52] we've got to be able to actually hear
[52:55] from god himself how are we going to
[52:57] hear from god we've got to know what he
[52:59] said right how are we going to hear from
[53:01] him well he's we hear from him by his
[53:04] word which is the scriptures do we
[53:06] believe that today
[53:08] this is how we learn how to please god
[53:11] because if you don't know how to please
[53:12] him and or if it doesn't matter you
[53:14] might as well eat drink and be merry
[53:16] there's no reason to go to church or
[53:18] live for god unless you unless there's
[53:20] something to tell you well that's what
[53:22] you're doing has some fruit to it that's
[53:24] some there's going to be some beneficial
[53:26] fruit of it and so we believe that the
[53:29] bible is the foundation for all of our
[53:31] faith now uh i like the way john wesley
[53:35] put this he said he said i'm a creature
[53:37] of a day
[53:38] passing through life as an arrow through
[53:40] the air i'm a spirit coming from god and
[53:43] returning to god just hovering over the
[53:46] great gulf a few months hence i am no
[53:49] more seen i drop into an unchangeable
[53:52] eternity i want to know one thing
[53:55] the way to heaven
[53:57] oh my
[53:58] is that what you want to know today
[54:00] i want to make it i want to know how to
[54:02] get to heaven how will i know how to get
[54:04] to heaven he said god himself has
[54:07] condescended to teach the way
[54:10] he hath written it down in a book
[54:13] oh my he hath written it down in a book
[54:16] and wesley said this he said oh give me
[54:19] that book
[54:20] at any price give me the book of god if
[54:23] this is how i please god if this is his
[54:26] words to me give me that book let me let
[54:28] me count it as precious i think today we
[54:31] handle it too lightly many times give me
[54:33] that book let me take the scripture in
[54:35] whatever form it's in if it's on my ipad
[54:38] if it's in in the book form like this if
[54:41] it's on a phone let me handle it as the
[54:43] precious word of god let me handle it as
[54:46] the thoughts of god that allow me to
[54:48] live the word of god that allow me to be
[54:50] a message believer in my day i wouldn't
[54:52] have that unless i had a foundation and
[54:55] this is the foundation of all of our
[54:57] faith
[54:58] and that's why every false doctrine
[55:00] everything that comes against the word
[55:02] it always comes because there's no
[55:04] foundation of the scripture it don't go
[55:06] back to the scripture we've got to
[55:08] correct ourselves by the word all
[55:10] scripture is given by the exploration of
[55:13] god god breathed it so we could be
[55:15] corrected so we could be reproved so we
[55:17] can be built up oh do you believe that
[55:20] today
[55:22] oh we ought to love our bibles
[55:25] i'm more than a baptist or methodist
[55:27] nothing against those people i'm sure
[55:29] many of them are sincere we ought to
[55:31] love of all people we ought to love the
[55:33] bible
[55:37] give me that book
[55:40] and so we find then the bible is the old
[55:42] testament and the new testament it's
[55:44] written in two parts
[55:46] the old testament was a cloudy view
[55:50] it was types and symbols
[55:52] and the new testament was a more
[55:54] sure word of prophecy
[55:57] peter says it this way in second peter 1
[55:59] 16 he said we have not followed
[56:01] cunningly devised fables when we made
[56:04] known unto you the power and coming of
[56:05] our lord jesus christ but we were
[56:07] eyewitnesses of his majesty
[56:10] for he received from god the father
[56:12] honor and glory when there came such a
[56:14] voice to him from the excellent glory
[56:16] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[56:18] pleased
[56:19] and this voice which came from heaven we
[56:21] heard when we were with him in the holy
[56:23] mount
[56:25] and he said we have also a more sure
[56:27] word of prophecy
[56:29] so he said the fact that we saw god
[56:31] manifest his own word in his son
[56:35] right this oh my the fact that god
[56:38] manifested his word in a body of flesh
[56:40] gives us a more sure word of prophecy
[56:43] then the old testament prophets had
[56:46] that any believer at the new testament
[56:48] could look at it and see things that the
[56:50] old testament didn't reveal
[56:52] you understand that's why jesus said
[56:54] john the baptist was the greatest man
[56:56] born among women he said but even the
[56:58] least in the kingdom of heaven is
[57:00] greater than he
[57:01] why because we're able to stand on the
[57:03] shoulders of those prophets and look
[57:05] beyond look farther even than what they
[57:07] could see he said and it's like a light
[57:09] he said shining in a dark place until
[57:12] the day dawn and the day star arise in
[57:14] your hearts
[57:16] knowing this first
[57:18] that no prophecy of the scripture
[57:21] is of any private
[57:24] interpretation
[57:25] so in other words he's saying we i
[57:27] didn't have a right
[57:28] to tell you that jesus was the messiah
[57:32] just because i dreamed it up just
[57:34] because i decided it was so
[57:36] but god came from heaven and proved yes
[57:41] that he was the messiah
[57:43] we have a more sure word of prophecy god
[57:46] came and vindicated that he was oh could
[57:48] you bring that now to the message of the
[57:50] hour and see what how we're living in we
[57:52] have a more sure word of prophecy what
[57:55] the bible says god vindicated it in a
[57:57] ministry but he didn't only vindicate it
[57:59] in the ministry of william branham but
[58:01] he vindicates it in his pride today
[58:04] we have a more sure word of prophecy god
[58:07] becoming flesh the word walking in shoe
[58:09] leather
[58:11] are you with me this morning
[58:13] and so it's not of any private
[58:14] interpretation
[58:16] not for anybody to say well this is it
[58:18] or that's it but what has god done
[58:21] let us see what god has done let's find
[58:24] out what god's doing amen i believe he's
[58:27] doing something in this hour that's why
[58:28] i refuse to bow to doom and gloom about
[58:31] the church or about the bribe or about
[58:32] what god's doing in this age i refuse to
[58:35] preach a gospel of doom and gloom and
[58:37] despair but i believe that there's a
[58:39] bride on the earth who's doing exactly
[58:42] what god said they would do i believe
[58:44] there's a people you're a part of it
[58:45] this morning i believe we can see
[58:47] healing we can see salvation we can feel
[58:50] the power of god we can move in the
[58:52] mind of god and know what god wants us
[58:55] to do why because we're the bride
[58:57] we're not looking for one to come we're
[58:59] not waiting on a more sure word of
[59:01] prophecy we have a more sure word of
[59:03] prophecy
[59:04] we've seen the light of the hour the
[59:06] message of the hour
[59:08] it's not a private interpretation for
[59:10] the prophecy came not in old time by the
[59:13] will of man
[59:15] but holy men of
[59:16] god spake as they were moved
[59:20] by the holy ghost
[59:22] they were moved to speak
[59:25] now watch
[59:26] i like
[59:28] if you'll excuse me for just a moment i
[59:30] like adam clark's commentary on this
[59:33] he said the prophecy came not an old
[59:34] time in any former time with the will of
[59:37] man
[59:38] man's own searching conjecture
[59:40] calculation
[59:42] but holy men of god
[59:44] persons separated from the world devoted
[59:46] to god's service spake moved by the holy
[59:49] ghost
[59:51] so far were they from inventing
[59:53] these prophetic declarations concerning
[59:55] christ or any future event that they
[59:58] were
[59:59] he uses the greek word
[1:00:01] moved carried away
[1:00:03] that's what that word means they were
[1:00:04] carried away
[1:00:06] so they could not speak it themselves
[1:00:09] but they were so in the spirit of god
[1:00:12] that they were carried away by the
[1:00:14] vision carried away by the word that
[1:00:16] they spoke
[1:00:18] they were carried away they were moved
[1:00:20] out of themselves and out of the whole
[1:00:22] region as it were of human knowledge and
[1:00:24] conjecture by the holy ghost who without
[1:00:27] their knowing anything of the matter
[1:00:29] dictated to them what to speak
[1:00:32] what to write and so far above their
[1:00:34] knowledge were the words of prophecy
[1:00:36] that they did not even know the intent
[1:00:38] of those words
[1:00:39] but search what manner of time the
[1:00:41] spirit of christ which was in them did
[1:00:43] signify when it testified beforehand the
[1:00:45] sufferings of christ and the glory that
[1:00:46] should follow let's read that first
[1:00:48] peter 1
[1:00:49] 10. listen peter's talking about this
[1:00:51] more sure word of prophecy this
[1:00:53] salvation that we've received he said
[1:00:55] which salvation the prophets have
[1:00:56] inquired and searched diligently
[1:01:00] look they prophesied it they spoke of it
[1:01:03] and yet they looked for it
[1:01:05] they tried to find out what they were
[1:01:08] saying god
[1:01:10] i didn't even know it but we know it why
[1:01:13] god manifested his word by bringing it
[1:01:15] to pass
[1:01:18] so they searched for it who prophesied
[1:01:20] of the grace that should come unto you
[1:01:22] searching water what manner of time the
[1:01:24] spirit of christ which was in them did
[1:01:25] signify when it testified beforehand the
[1:01:28] sufferings of christ and the glory that
[1:01:30] should follow he said unto whom it was
[1:01:32] revealed
[1:01:33] not unto themselves
[1:01:35] oh i love this so he said they searched
[1:01:37] and then it was revealed to them that
[1:01:38] they didn't say this for themselves
[1:01:41] it was not to themselves but unto us
[1:01:44] they did minister the things which are
[1:01:46] now reported unto you by them that have
[1:01:48] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:01:49] holy ghost sent down from heaven which
[1:01:52] things the angels desire to look into
[1:01:54] the prophets looked at it and couldn't
[1:01:56] see it the angels looked at it and
[1:01:57] couldn't see it but when the time came
[1:02:00] god interpreted his word by bringing it
[1:02:02] to pass look the prophets didn't know
[1:02:04] malachi when he said when he said behold
[1:02:07] i send you elijah the prophet i send you
[1:02:09] elijah the prophet he did not know what
[1:02:11] he was talking about in its fullness
[1:02:13] you understand he said it
[1:02:15] and it becomes scripture
[1:02:17] it was the word of god angels looked at
[1:02:20] it prophets looked at it people
[1:02:22] ministered down to the ages and looked
[1:02:24] at it but one day god brought his word
[1:02:26] to pass yes
[1:02:28] oh don't you believe a god who could do
[1:02:30] that would bring his word to pass in
[1:02:32] your life
[1:02:33] the prophet said they said i am the lord
[1:02:36] thy god that healeth peace i'm the god
[1:02:38] that heals all thy diseases they may not
[1:02:40] have known about cancer and about covet
[1:02:42] and about all these things but you know
[1:02:44] the reality of it because you serve a
[1:02:46] god who has healed you from those things
[1:02:48] you serve a god who's brought his word
[1:02:51] to pass
[1:02:52] and don't you realize today you've got
[1:02:54] to have that
[1:02:55] you've got to have that you've got to
[1:02:56] have a god who can bring these things to
[1:02:59] pass
[1:03:00] not a god who's only a theory not a god
[1:03:02] who's only in your mind or in your head
[1:03:04] but you need a god who has brought these
[1:03:06] things to pass in your life and it gives
[1:03:08] you a confidence i've been young and i
[1:03:10] now i'm old but i've never seen the seed
[1:03:12] forsaken i've never seen them begging
[1:03:14] bread i know god's taking care of me i
[1:03:17] know god's a healer i know that what the
[1:03:19] bible said is true why because he's
[1:03:21] brought it to pass in my life
[1:03:24] i know he forgives of sin oh can you say
[1:03:27] amen to that this morning
[1:03:29] i know he's a forgiver i know he has
[1:03:31] mercy why he had mercy for me
[1:03:34] i know he loves me he loves me because i
[1:03:37] feel his love for me i know that he's a
[1:03:39] healer because he's healed me
[1:03:42] hallelujah
[1:03:44] oh my
[1:03:46] oh you're easy to preach to this morning
[1:03:47] i'm about to slow down
[1:03:51] hallelujah they ministered those things
[1:03:53] to us
[1:03:54] we'll see the example of david
[1:03:56] prophesying of christ had no idea what
[1:03:59] he was saying
[1:04:02] he said my god my god why has
[1:04:04] self-forsaken me
[1:04:06] why art thou so far from helping me and
[1:04:08] from the words of my roaring he thought
[1:04:10] he was talking about himself
[1:04:13] psalms 22 14 i am poured out like water
[1:04:16] all my bones are out of joint my heart
[1:04:18] is like wax it is melted in the midst of
[1:04:20] my bowels
[1:04:22] my strength is dried up like a pot shirt
[1:04:24] my tongue cleaveth to my jaws that has
[1:04:26] brought me into the dust of death
[1:04:28] dogs have compassed me the assembly of
[1:04:30] the wicked have enclosed me they pierced
[1:04:33] my hands and my feet
[1:04:35] and he had no idea what they were
[1:04:37] talking about
[1:04:39] what he was talking about
[1:04:41] i may tell all my bones they look and
[1:04:44] stare upon me they park my garments
[1:04:46] among them cast offs upon my vesture
[1:04:49] brother branham brings it up into the
[1:04:51] crucifixion and he says the very day
[1:04:53] that they were singing the psalm the
[1:04:55] 22nd psalm
[1:04:57] that's what they're saying at passover
[1:04:58] time
[1:05:00] they sang the 22nd psalm the very day
[1:05:02] that they did that my god my god why has
[1:05:04] that forsaken me
[1:05:06] all my bones they stare at me not one
[1:05:08] bone should be broken the very song that
[1:05:10] they were repeating in the temple there
[1:05:12] hung the sacrifice screaming the very
[1:05:14] words
[1:05:15] that david said 800 years before but
[1:05:17] they were too blind to see it oh god
[1:05:19] open our eyes today
[1:05:21] open our eyes today that we can see the
[1:05:22] word of the hour when it manifests
[1:05:24] itself
[1:05:26] they were too blind to see it
[1:05:28] he said today the very god that spoke of
[1:05:30] this age
[1:05:31] oh he's bringing it down to our day now
[1:05:33] he said he's on the scene doing exactly
[1:05:36] what he said he would do and they're too
[1:05:38] blind to see it he said that's
[1:05:39] unbelievers
[1:05:41] listen to me they didn't see that god
[1:05:43] was manifesting himself in a son of man
[1:05:45] ministry and there's many today that
[1:05:47] can't see that god has clothed himself
[1:05:49] in his bride that he's wrapped himself
[1:05:51] in his bride they can't see it but it
[1:05:53] don't make it not true it just means
[1:05:55] that they can't believe they don't have
[1:05:57] the capacity to believe but you believe
[1:05:59] this morning why do you believe because
[1:06:01] there's a seed down on the inside that
[1:06:02] makes you believe
[1:06:06] oh god open blinded eyes today
[1:06:09] to see where god is
[1:06:13] he's with us right now he's in us right
[1:06:16] now
[1:06:17] doing his work
[1:06:19] the very god that spoke of this age is
[1:06:21] on the scene doing exactly what he said
[1:06:23] he would do
[1:06:24] they're too blind to see it they walk
[1:06:25] out and say oh i can't believe stuff
[1:06:27] like that i never heard of that in my
[1:06:28] life
[1:06:29] it don't make any difference what you
[1:06:31] heard
[1:06:33] amen the bible said it would be here and
[1:06:36] it's his word
[1:06:38] listen they read the original scrolls of
[1:06:40] psalms
[1:06:41] and i just want to bring this down today
[1:06:44] where even our children could understand
[1:06:46] because you're going to hear that the
[1:06:48] bible is not accurate in its present
[1:06:50] form you're going to hear well it was
[1:06:51] translated and it was all this was done
[1:06:53] to it it's been messed with and you're
[1:06:55] going to hear that you can't have
[1:06:56] confidence in it but i want you to
[1:06:58] understand i want you to have confidence
[1:06:59] in the scriptures
[1:07:01] it's one thing and we want our children
[1:07:03] to learn the scriptures that's something
[1:07:04] that we stress that children should
[1:07:07] learn as parents we need to teach our
[1:07:09] children the scripture
[1:07:10] teach them the scripture behind
[1:07:12] everything we do at church there's
[1:07:13] something scriptural to back it up
[1:07:17] you understand that everything we do is
[1:07:18] a teaching opportunity for our children
[1:07:21] why do we get baptized why do we come to
[1:07:23] church early how do we sit in the
[1:07:25] presence of god why do we do all of this
[1:07:27] why why
[1:07:28] why does the preacher come back out like
[1:07:30] what he does and how do we give the the
[1:07:32] main focus on the word all of those
[1:07:34] things come from scripture
[1:07:36] and then a prophet came and shed light
[1:07:38] shine light on that
[1:07:41] right but we can take our children back
[1:07:42] to the scripture and i want to give you
[1:07:43] a foundation for this why do we believe
[1:07:45] in in predestination why do we what
[1:07:48] about the serpents see what about these
[1:07:49] things once they reach a certain age
[1:07:51] they begin to wonder about these things
[1:07:52] we should be able to take them to the
[1:07:54] scripture and show
[1:07:56] this is a this is the word of god
[1:07:58] and i want you kids to have confidence
[1:08:00] today i want you young people to have
[1:08:02] confidence today in the word of god if i
[1:08:04] live my life according to the word i'm
[1:08:06] going to make it
[1:08:08] it won't matter how i feel it won't
[1:08:10] matter what comes in front of me it
[1:08:11] won't matter what the unbelievers say
[1:08:15] the word of god is still true do you
[1:08:17] believe that today
[1:08:19] amen and so now
[1:08:21] but they were singing the very songs
[1:08:23] that had been the the from the scrolls
[1:08:25] that had been carefully copied word for
[1:08:27] word so much so that if they ever made
[1:08:29] one mistake in penmanship they would
[1:08:31] throw the whole thing away
[1:08:34] that's how careful they were about
[1:08:35] copying the words of moses
[1:08:37] and the and the psalms and the songs
[1:08:39] that they had and the different prophets
[1:08:41] that were written down
[1:08:42] they they were careful to preserve the
[1:08:45] old testament scriptures
[1:08:47] they committed them to memory
[1:08:49] so that they could quote the entire
[1:08:52] torah the entire books of moses before
[1:08:54] they reached 13 years of age
[1:08:57] it was a requirement to become a man to
[1:08:58] be able to quote those things
[1:09:00] and yet they stayed right there in the
[1:09:02] temple
[1:09:03] while the word itself was being
[1:09:04] manifested on the cross
[1:09:07] even being able to quote it and knowing
[1:09:08] it line by line word by word but there
[1:09:11] was something they were missing they
[1:09:12] could not see it because they were blind
[1:09:15] the bible says they were blinded for our
[1:09:17] sakes
[1:09:19] and there was god standing there
[1:09:21] revealing that word crying my god why
[1:09:23] has south forsaken me the very songs
[1:09:26] that they were singing in the temple
[1:09:27] that david had made for them years ago
[1:09:29] pertaining to christ all my bones they
[1:09:31] stare at me they pierced my hands and my
[1:09:33] feet there they were standing there
[1:09:35] singing that and the very man dying on
[1:09:37] the cross
[1:09:38] when he died the god of heaven came down
[1:09:41] like he did on mount sinai with holy
[1:09:43] fire burnt that temple veil from top to
[1:09:45] bottom tore it apart and what could they
[1:09:48] do look right out there out of the
[1:09:49] temple window on calvary there was god
[1:09:52] in plain view
[1:09:54] the sacrifice but they don't see it yet
[1:09:56] today
[1:09:58] he said god in this last day has rent
[1:10:00] those traditions away and brought the
[1:10:01] word for this age right plain and view
[1:10:04] and they still don't see it they just
[1:10:05] don't know it it's so simple
[1:10:09] now watch god interprets his word by
[1:10:11] bringing it to pass satan interprets his
[1:10:13] by reason
[1:10:14] and we talked about that last week this
[1:10:16] is how satan interprets his word is by
[1:10:19] reason
[1:10:20] the serpent said unto the woman we shall
[1:10:22] not surely die you shall not surely die
[1:10:24] now watch he he just adds a word
[1:10:28] he just adds a word
[1:10:30] he said
[1:10:31] actually he adds the word not
[1:10:34] it says you shall surely die
[1:10:36] he adds one word
[1:10:38] it changes the entire meaning
[1:10:42] right one word change the entire meaning
[1:10:45] for god doth know that in the day you
[1:10:47] eat thereof your day shall be oh your
[1:10:49] eyes should be open you should be as
[1:10:50] gods knowing good and evil now what was
[1:10:52] he telling them he was saying okay you
[1:10:54] can't trust this
[1:10:56] and this is always how he acts
[1:10:59] what he does that serpent is still on
[1:11:01] the earth today
[1:11:02] right in spiritual form and he inspires
[1:11:05] men and women to take the word and try
[1:11:07] to remove the credibility from the word
[1:11:10] to try to get you where you don't
[1:11:12] believe the bible and then he'll try to
[1:11:14] get you where you don't believe the
[1:11:14] message or the hour just to remove the
[1:11:16] credibility from it
[1:11:18] now watch what he does he takes away the
[1:11:20] credibility of the word he tries he says
[1:11:22] you shall not surely die and so in other
[1:11:24] words he said well it was mistranslated
[1:11:26] you misunderstood he said but i have
[1:11:28] secret knowledge now he could make a
[1:11:30] claim to having secret knowledge if she
[1:11:32] really knew who she was who she was
[1:11:34] talking to it was lucifer that it
[1:11:36] inhabited the serpent you understand and
[1:11:39] he he was standing there but the one who
[1:11:41] had had inhabited the serpent the one
[1:11:43] who had taken over that body was
[1:11:46] actually the one who was with god
[1:11:49] who was created by god who was the
[1:11:51] right-hand man of god in heaven
[1:11:54] and so he could claim to have prior
[1:11:56] knowledge he could say i was right next
[1:11:58] to god i was in the inner circle and you
[1:12:01] wouldn't believe the things he told me
[1:12:04] private testimonies
[1:12:08] i'm not comparing people who tell
[1:12:10] testimonies to to
[1:12:12] to satan that's not what i'm doing
[1:12:14] but you understand you don't put
[1:12:15] confidence in that
[1:12:17] put it in the word
[1:12:21] you separate brotherhood over something
[1:12:23] somebody told somebody you told somebody
[1:12:24] told somebody it might have been asleep
[1:12:26] when the person told it
[1:12:29] you don't know
[1:12:31] we don't trust that we trust what god
[1:12:33] said
[1:12:34] i got opinions i told you last week i
[1:12:36] got opinions i got certain opinions
[1:12:38] about school certain opinions about
[1:12:39] about about things that my own children
[1:12:42] and things i'll let them do and things i
[1:12:43] want but you go back to the word don't
[1:12:45] don't go back to my opinions or or
[1:12:47] somebody else's opinion go back to the
[1:12:49] word
[1:12:50] find out what the word said
[1:12:53] and i'll tell you your attitude towards
[1:12:55] the word ought to be not not some
[1:12:57] attitude of well
[1:12:58] you know the word says it but i believe
[1:13:00] god's a merciful god now if the word
[1:13:02] says it i'll just do that
[1:13:04] well the word says it but i better try
[1:13:06] to figure out maybe he meant something
[1:13:08] different you know i know brother
[1:13:08] branham taught this about the scriptures
[1:13:10] but but maybe i i can do something a
[1:13:12] little bit different that shouldn't be
[1:13:13] our attitude at all it should not be our
[1:13:15] default position to try to find a
[1:13:17] loophole or a way out remember that's
[1:13:19] what balaam did that's what balaam did
[1:13:21] try to find a loophole maybe i can go
[1:13:23] maybe it'd be good if i do this and do
[1:13:25] that and god finally granted him that
[1:13:27] permission but we don't want the
[1:13:28] permissive will of god we want the
[1:13:30] perfect will of god
[1:13:32] hey man we don't go by loophole but we
[1:13:35] say god said it i believe it
[1:13:38] and that settles it
[1:13:40] now again you have to have understanding
[1:13:42] but the understanding has to has to fit
[1:13:45] with the entirety of scripture
[1:13:47] right
[1:13:48] the light of the age
[1:13:50] how do we know it's the light of the
[1:13:52] hour well the holy ghost witnesses it
[1:13:54] yes but we don't go by feeling
[1:13:56] but it fits through the entire scripture
[1:13:59] right and you can't take baptist
[1:14:01] doctrine through the entire scripture
[1:14:03] right
[1:14:04] you can't take methodist doctrine i know
[1:14:05] i'm being bold on that but it's a fact
[1:14:09] can't take it to the whole scripture but
[1:14:10] we as message people should not be
[1:14:12] scared of any scripture in the bible
[1:14:17] to believe it because it's true it's
[1:14:19] god's word
[1:14:21] right now
[1:14:22] again satan interprets by reason he
[1:14:24] tells us he's misunderstood it was
[1:14:25] mistranslated brother brandon said and i
[1:14:28] read this last week but i want to drop
[1:14:29] it in here and then we'll move on
[1:14:31] brother brown said faith believes that
[1:14:33] god that can make me
[1:14:35] can keep that book in the order for me
[1:14:37] to live by
[1:14:39] if the god who made me is going to judge
[1:14:42] me
[1:14:42] can't keep his book in order then he's a
[1:14:44] very poor god
[1:14:46] he said i believe every word of it is
[1:14:47] the truth shouldn't that be our attitude
[1:14:49] towards it today yes sir what does this
[1:14:52] do to believe that it gives faith a
[1:14:54] perfect resting place in it
[1:14:57] and that means or whatever else is
[1:14:59] shaken my foundation can't be shaken my
[1:15:02] faith has a perfect resting place
[1:15:04] amen listen your mom and dad might fail
[1:15:06] you your church might fail you somebody
[1:15:09] else might fail you but if your faith is
[1:15:11] found in the word of god you will always
[1:15:13] endure you're not going to be saved you
[1:15:14] might fail yourself but you will not be
[1:15:17] shaken because your faith is in the word
[1:15:23] excuse me
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:30] i believe the word
[1:15:32] i fell in love with the word
[1:15:34] you know why i fell in love with the
[1:15:35] word i fell in love with the author
[1:15:39] you ever got a love letter you didn't
[1:15:40] fall in love with the love letter
[1:15:42] but you you kept it it was precious to
[1:15:45] you
[1:15:46] why because you were in love with the
[1:15:47] author
[1:15:48] this bible is precious because i fell in
[1:15:50] love with the author one day
[1:15:52] and it's precious to me
[1:15:54] and i've kept it it means something to
[1:15:56] me
[1:15:57] oh my if we could just read that bible
[1:15:59] like that if we could treat it like that
[1:16:01] it's the word of god
[1:16:03] he said i believe every word of it to is
[1:16:05] true it gives faith a perfect resting
[1:16:08] place
[1:16:09] now watch
[1:16:11] and what did the scripture say the men
[1:16:13] who wrote the old testament were holy
[1:16:15] men of god
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] it said holy men of god that doesn't
[1:16:20] mean they didn't make mistakes
[1:16:22] but the bible says they were holy men of
[1:16:23] god
[1:16:25] that wrote it
[1:16:26] and what they wrote was so inspired
[1:16:29] that they didn't even know what it meant
[1:16:32] so it was holy men of god it was
[1:16:34] inspired
[1:16:36] and then what they wrote was manifested
[1:16:38] in the life of one man
[1:16:41] all of it
[1:16:45] this is so good
[1:16:47] you know i've heard it before well you
[1:16:48] just need to learn to rejoice in the
[1:16:50] little things
[1:16:52] what if you went to your wife every time
[1:16:54] and said well i saw you before it don't
[1:16:56] mean do nothing for me now you know
[1:17:00] they say as you get older your eyesight
[1:17:02] gets dimmer so you both continue to
[1:17:04] appreciate one another you know
[1:17:06] as we get older our eyes fail but you
[1:17:07] know you you learn to love one another
[1:17:10] you learn to love one another and
[1:17:11] appreciate one another you don't stand
[1:17:13] there and say well i i've seen you
[1:17:15] before i i've seen them know you love
[1:17:17] one another so it means something to
[1:17:19] when we love the word the word means
[1:17:21] something to us
[1:17:23] now watch what they wrote was manifested
[1:17:25] in the life of one person jesus christ
[1:17:27] psalms 40 and 7 said
[1:17:30] alo i come
[1:17:31] in the volume of the book or in the
[1:17:33] entirety of the book it is written
[1:17:36] of me
[1:17:37] brother branham said he is the principle
[1:17:39] theme of the entire bible
[1:17:42] if you read the bible and don't see
[1:17:43] christ in every verse of it go back and
[1:17:46] read it again
[1:17:47] if you can't see christ in every verse
[1:17:49] of the bible then you read it again
[1:17:51] because you missed something
[1:17:54] now that's a challenge for us
[1:17:56] that's a challenge for us if we if we
[1:17:59] don't see christ in every verse of the
[1:18:01] bible we've got to go back and read it
[1:18:03] again we missed something he said the
[1:18:04] bible is christ
[1:18:06] he is the word when you read in the
[1:18:09] beginning god created there is christ
[1:18:13] now in order to believe this you got to
[1:18:14] believe he's god
[1:18:16] if you believe he's a second person you
[1:18:18] can't make every scripture christ
[1:18:23] but if you believe he is god
[1:18:28] he is the word
[1:18:29] then you see christ in every verse of
[1:18:31] the bible he said the bible is christ he
[1:18:33] is the word you read in the beginning
[1:18:34] god created there is christ from that to
[1:18:36] the amen in revelation is every word
[1:18:38] testifying of jesus christ number
[1:18:40] branham goes on to say that's why the
[1:18:42] maccabees and some of these other books
[1:18:44] that you've heard about are not in the
[1:18:46] scripture because they don't fit with
[1:18:48] the theme
[1:18:49] of jesus christ
[1:18:51] you understand they may be true they get
[1:18:53] maybe historical there may be lots of
[1:18:55] good stuff in them but they don't fit
[1:18:57] with the theme
[1:18:59] amen but everything in this bible
[1:19:02] are you hearing me this morning
[1:19:04] everything in this bible
[1:19:06] brother ben you're a fanatic praise god
[1:19:09] i'm glad to be a fan of something
[1:19:15] that's a what a what a badge of honor
[1:19:19] right in the beginning now
[1:19:21] in the beginning was the word
[1:19:23] right that's the logos the word we
[1:19:25] understand that the word was with god
[1:19:28] the word was god and the word was made
[1:19:30] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:19:33] its glory
[1:19:35] amen the glory says the only begotten of
[1:19:37] the father full of grace and truth now
[1:19:38] put that together john 1 and 1 with john
[1:19:41] 1 14.
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:44] i went through and as i began to think
[1:19:46] about this and begin to ponder this i
[1:19:48] i just from memory i began to jot down
[1:19:51] and begin to look and see
[1:19:53] what i could see every book
[1:19:56] and i think we ought to know the books
[1:19:59] of the bible
[1:20:01] well this is so elementary brother ben
[1:20:02] but but listen to me i think sometimes
[1:20:04] we forget this is important
[1:20:07] now you may not be able to recite them
[1:20:09] from memory but you ought to know the
[1:20:10] teaching from every book in the bible
[1:20:13] because every book is important
[1:20:15] you may have never read obadiah
[1:20:18] or nahum or some of those books like
[1:20:19] that but but it's important
[1:20:22] it matters in the economy of god
[1:20:25] so now and i think that's why it's
[1:20:27] important to read the whole the whole
[1:20:28] bible but now we find i begin to think
[1:20:31] about that and begin to jot down what is
[1:20:32] it where do i see christ in every book
[1:20:34] of the old testament
[1:20:36] now think about it because he fulfilled
[1:20:38] that he was the walking word
[1:20:41] right he fulfilled every book not only
[1:20:43] every book but every verse
[1:20:45] and we don't have time to go through
[1:20:46] every verse this morning
[1:20:49] but let's just look at the at the books
[1:20:51] and see what is he
[1:20:53] in genesis he's the creator
[1:20:56] in exodus he's the deliverer
[1:20:58] in leviticus he's the lawgiver
[1:21:02] i'm just writing these things down what
[1:21:03] does it mean to me how do i see christ
[1:21:05] in every part of the scripture
[1:21:07] in numbers he is the brass serpent
[1:21:10] in deuteronomy he's a prophet like moses
[1:21:13] in joshua he is jehovah's savior
[1:21:16] in judges he's the angel giving
[1:21:18] encouragement to gideon
[1:21:20] you remember he's the angel of the lord
[1:21:22] and ruth
[1:21:23] he is the kinsman redeemer
[1:21:26] in samuel kings and chronicles he's a
[1:21:29] rejected king
[1:21:31] the true king of israel
[1:21:33] in ezra and nehemiah he's the builder
[1:21:36] oh my and see how you can bring all that
[1:21:38] back to christ in esther he's the king
[1:21:41] with a scepter
[1:21:42] you realize esther doesn't even mention
[1:21:44] god
[1:21:46] the book of esther doesn't even mention
[1:21:47] god but just the life of esther
[1:21:50] was enough to be inspired by god to be
[1:21:52] placed in the scriptures because it
[1:21:55] represents god it represents a king with
[1:21:57] a scepter it represents a bride yes amen
[1:22:01] amen and so there's so many types we can
[1:22:03] preach from esther and we can see christ

[1:22:40] going to the solder he was god's servant
[1:22:43] and isaiah in jeremiah he's the root and
[1:22:46] branch of jesse
[1:22:47] calls him the branch
[1:22:49] amen in lamentations he's a weeping
[1:22:51] prophet
[1:22:53] in ezekiel he's the wheel in the middle
[1:22:55] of the wheel
[1:22:57] hallelujah brother branham tells the
[1:22:59] story of how that when he went down when
[1:23:01] jesus goes down into the hell they were
[1:23:04] into the regions of
[1:23:05] paradise he walks down he knocks on the
[1:23:07] door and they open it up and ezekiel saw

[1:23:55] prophets he is the righteous judge
[1:23:58] and the one who will not forget his
[1:24:00] people

[1:24:03] in zechariah he's the golden lamp stand
[1:24:06] the headstone and the fountain for sin
[1:24:08] so many types of christ in the book of
[1:24:10] zechariah in malachi he's the message
[1:24:16] all right what was it he said behold i
[1:24:18] send my messenger before my face he is
[1:24:20] the message that the messenger came to
[1:24:22] bring
[1:24:23] glory brother brother said the message
[1:24:25] is christ
[1:24:26] he is the message proclaimed by the
[1:24:28] messenger no wonder he could stand there
[1:24:29] and say this day this scripture is
[1:24:32] fulfilled
[1:24:33] and i'm sure you could go back and look
[1:24:34] at each one of those books of the bible
[1:24:36] and find many other types
[1:24:38] many other scriptures every verse tells
[1:24:41] us who he is
[1:24:43] and what he does
[1:24:45] this day this scripture
[1:24:47] is fulfilled
[1:24:48] i wonder if we wonder what we've got
[1:24:51] if we realize what we got what we've got
[1:24:54] i wonder if we if it inspires us
[1:24:57] with all
[1:24:58] an understanding or if we've just laid
[1:25:00] it on a shelf
[1:25:02] in the new testament now watch
[1:25:05] it's the same things again what was the
[1:25:06] new testament written by holy men of god
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:11] written under inspiration
[1:25:14] manifested
[1:25:16] in a body yes
[1:25:19] not one man
[1:25:21] but a body
[1:25:23] us
[1:25:24] yes
[1:25:26] well you shout when i talk about jesus
[1:25:31] think about it
[1:25:33] oh god
[1:25:35] how's he going to prove the new
[1:25:36] testament to be true
[1:25:38] gloria in in our bodies in our mortal
[1:25:42] flesh
[1:25:44] amen when jesus came he was the word in
[1:25:46] his fullness because the whole plan of
[1:25:48] redemption laid into him the whole plan
[1:25:50] of redemption didn't lay in moses didn't
[1:25:51] land joseph didn't lay in elijah see
[1:25:53] they were only part of the word he said
[1:25:55] pointing to it therefore after him the
[1:25:57] fullness we cannot point to something
[1:25:58] else it points back to him the word and
[1:26:01] i like i love the way the editor puts
[1:26:03] this in here he said brother branham
[1:26:04] picks up his bible
[1:26:06] he said this is the complete revelation
[1:26:09] nothing can be added or taken away from
[1:26:12] it there is the complete revelation
[1:26:15] he said all that a shadow of him to come
[1:26:18] but when he come he was the perfect
[1:26:20] hebrews 1 god in sundry times spoke to
[1:26:22] the fathers to the prophets god spoke
[1:26:24] through veils the prophets but in this
[1:26:27] last day through his son jesus christ
[1:26:29] there you are unveiled out there on
[1:26:30] calvary the son of god unveiled are you
[1:26:32] still with me this morning we've got
[1:26:34] just a little more time he said notice
[1:26:36] made alive he said and today
[1:26:38] and this is a continuation of the same
[1:26:40] quote he said today when the word is
[1:26:43] manifested in human vessels veils
[1:26:46] it's absolutely the word fulfilled in
[1:26:48] that day which comes back to god
[1:26:52] being baptized into him according to
[1:26:54] first corinthians 12 we become
[1:26:56] identified with him what is it it's
[1:26:58] manifested in a body
[1:27:00] of the bride
[1:27:03] glory
[1:27:04] now watch we are living epistles walking
[1:27:07] word the fleshly veil of the unseen god
[1:27:10] the prophets were part of the old
[1:27:11] testament word but jesus was all of the
[1:27:13] word
[1:27:14] the denominations could only live that
[1:27:16] part of the word the new testament word
[1:27:18] that they saw but we can live all the
[1:27:20] word
[1:27:21] brother branham said the mysteries was
[1:27:23] in the seven seals when these seven
[1:27:25] seals was opened that opened up the
[1:27:27] entire bible
[1:27:28] he said the seven seals they would steal
[1:27:30] with seven mysteries and in these seven
[1:27:32] seals held the someone say entire
[1:27:36] entire mystery of it
[1:27:38] and it was the book of redemption now
[1:27:41] watch new testament
[1:27:43] and it goes on to explain why the old
[1:27:44] testament was a shadow but the new
[1:27:46] testament is the reality
[1:27:48] amen that's where we live today
[1:27:52] ii peter 3 14 he said wherefore beloved
[1:27:54] seeing that you look for such things we
[1:27:56] look at the end time coming and that's
[1:27:57] what they were looking for in that early
[1:27:59] church and he said you look for these
[1:28:01] things he said be diligent that you may
[1:28:02] be found of him in peace without spot
[1:28:04] and blameless and account that the
[1:28:06] long-suffering of our lord is salvation
[1:28:08] even as our beloved brother paul
[1:28:10] also according to the wisdom given unto
[1:28:12] him hath written unto you now watch
[1:28:14] there'll be some people who believe the
[1:28:15] old testament who will tell you the new
[1:28:16] testament isn't such isn't so inspired
[1:28:19] or somehow it's been mistranslated
[1:28:22] but now watch what he's saying
[1:28:24] he said our brother paul
[1:28:25] according to the wisdom given unto him
[1:28:27] hath written unto you
[1:28:28] also in all his epistles you know all
[1:28:31] his epistles
[1:28:33] speaking in them of these things in
[1:28:35] which are some things hard to be
[1:28:37] understood
[1:28:40] it should make us feel better shouldn't
[1:28:41] it
[1:28:42] some things are hard to be understood
[1:28:44] i'm so glad for the light and the
[1:28:45] message of the hour
[1:28:47] he said which they that are unlearned
[1:28:51] ignorant
[1:28:53] and unstable
[1:28:56] don't they don't have no foundation
[1:28:58] he said rest
[1:28:59] rest w-r-e-s-t they wrestle with it
[1:29:04] their mind they're not sure but see
[1:29:06] faith if you go back to a fundamental
[1:29:07] foundation of faith but the rhetoric is
[1:29:09] unconscious
[1:29:10] see you don't have to think well i'm
[1:29:12] going to believe i'm going to believe
[1:29:12] i'm going to believe but you just
[1:29:14] believe in the word
[1:29:15] it's just unconscious you just say the
[1:29:17] word says it i believe that that settles
[1:29:19] it
[1:29:20] how many could say amen to that today
[1:29:22] the bible says it so it must be true
[1:29:25] right it's unconscious and so you don't
[1:29:27] have to think and build yourself up and
[1:29:29] work yourself up into it it's
[1:29:30] unconscious he said like crossing a
[1:29:32] bridge when you get to it you just
[1:29:33] expect it to hold
[1:29:35] start in your car in the morning some of
[1:29:37] us anyway expect our cars to start
[1:29:40] and sometimes they don't i've been there
[1:29:42] i know what that's like
[1:29:44] even with a newer vehicle they won't
[1:29:45] always start
[1:29:47] oh but thank god we have a word that
[1:29:50] will always work when the car won't
[1:29:52] start when the groceries when the
[1:29:54] money's not in the bank for the
[1:29:55] groceries when the kids are hungry when
[1:29:57] the people are sick when the family is
[1:29:59] all fighting and fussing with one
[1:30:00] another the word of god is still hold
[1:30:04] amen because it is christ and he's the
[1:30:07] same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:09] so he said they wrestle as they do also
[1:30:12] the other scriptures
[1:30:14] so he identifies paul's writing has
[1:30:16] scripture
[1:30:17] he said unto their own destruction it's
[1:30:20] not good to wrestle with the word you
[1:30:21] need to settle it
[1:30:24] be sure that what god said is true
[1:30:27] be positive listen to me young people
[1:30:29] listen to me young married couples
[1:30:31] be positive that what god said is true
[1:30:35] and build your life on that you're going
[1:30:36] to make mistakes but build your life on
[1:30:38] what god said
[1:30:40] right and if you build your life on what
[1:30:42] god said you're going to be able to make
[1:30:44] it and i think some of those have been
[1:30:46] decades and decades in the way and know
[1:30:48] what i'm talking about today you can you
[1:30:50] can testify to that and say i built my
[1:30:52] life on the word i made mistakes but i'm
[1:30:54] here i messed up but i'm here
[1:30:57] why because of my life there was a
[1:30:58] foundation when i hit i can't go too far
[1:31:00] to the bottom because there's the word
[1:31:02] there
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:06] now watch
[1:31:08] you say well what about translations we
[1:31:10] got different translations
[1:31:12] and i recognize that the king james
[1:31:14] sometimes is difficult
[1:31:16] for us to understand sometimes i'll read
[1:31:18] something and have to go look it up
[1:31:20] because of that brother branham said
[1:31:21] that he said we find now in the old
[1:31:22] testament there's many words he said in
[1:31:25] our new king james version that seems
[1:31:26] very strange
[1:31:28] we called it our new king james version
[1:31:30] i don't think he was talking about the
[1:31:31] new king james version but
[1:31:33] but the king james version was a
[1:31:35] relatively new translation in history
[1:31:38] of the bible
[1:31:39] and we think of that as old now but he
[1:31:41] said that seems very strange but for me
[1:31:43] he said the rest of you brethren could
[1:31:44] teach from any version you want to he
[1:31:46] said but i like the king james just
[1:31:48] seems more like the bible to me and if
[1:31:50] you've ever read from what they call the
[1:31:51] message version of the bible
[1:31:53] then you know that king james is a
[1:31:55] pretty good translation
[1:31:58] and they've got different versions the
[1:32:00] living bible and all those things but
[1:32:01] that it's not what's important brother
[1:32:03] branham was not king james only
[1:32:05] fundamentalist
[1:32:08] he wasn't you don't find that
[1:32:10] he he went to the greek and and the
[1:32:12] different places and found some places
[1:32:15] king james don't make it he a great
[1:32:17] example of that is in st john 14. my
[1:32:19] father's house are many mansions he said
[1:32:21] my father's house are many mansions he
[1:32:22] said one translator translated in my
[1:32:24] father's apartment or many apartments
[1:32:26] and that don't seem like it makes a
[1:32:27] whole lot of sense
[1:32:29] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:32:31] but brother ram goes back and explains
[1:32:32] that in my father's house he said a
[1:32:34] house was a household in those days
[1:32:37] and my father's house are many
[1:32:38] tabernacles and it goes on in things
[1:32:40] that are to be to explain that that's
[1:32:41] our bodies
[1:32:43] right our word bodies and so
[1:32:45] we realized then that that that new
[1:32:47] testament or that king james version
[1:32:49] rather there's things there that you
[1:32:50] have to work to understand
[1:32:53] but it's still every bit the truth
[1:32:55] right right now i like it for the same
[1:32:57] reason that he did there would be
[1:32:58] nothing wrong with reading from a
[1:32:59] different translation i like it because
[1:33:01] it sounds like the bible
[1:33:03] all of these and therefores and vows i
[1:33:06] like that because it just to me it
[1:33:07] sounds like the bible
[1:33:09] i just love the majesty of how it's
[1:33:10] written
[1:33:11] but brother branham goes into this
[1:33:13] discussion in the church age book of
[1:33:14] greek verses arab aramaic aramaic was
[1:33:17] the language of the common people
[1:33:18] probably the language that jesus spoke
[1:33:20] in most of the time because hebrew had
[1:33:22] gone out of fashion hebrew was spoken by
[1:33:24] the scholars of that day so some people
[1:33:26] believe that the bible the new testament
[1:33:28] was written first in aramaic and then
[1:33:30] translated into greek
[1:33:32] but most believe that it was written
[1:33:33] first in greek
[1:33:34] but now it was dr lomsa who made that
[1:33:37] famous brother brandon was a personal
[1:33:38] friend of his he wrote a bible called
[1:33:40] the loss of bible he said and he
[1:33:42] believed it was from aramaic he said
[1:33:44] however before we get too concerned
[1:33:46] about this he said let us read both the
[1:33:48] king james version and the translation
[1:33:49] by dr lomsa to our gratification we find
[1:33:52] the words in both amazingly the same so
[1:33:56] that there's no difference actually in
[1:33:57] content or doctrine
[1:34:00] i'm ringing a little bit up here
[1:34:02] there's no difference in content or
[1:34:04] doctrine
[1:34:05] now watch you know why he could say that
[1:34:08] he wasn't looking at it like a legal
[1:34:10] document
[1:34:13] it was looking at the theme of it
[1:34:15] it still presents christ there may be
[1:34:18] some things better translated in the
[1:34:19] aramaic some things better translated in
[1:34:21] the greek but it has the same content
[1:34:24] the same doctrine he said we may even
[1:34:26] conclude that god has allowed these
[1:34:28] newly discovered manuscripts and recent
[1:34:30] publications have already known scripts
[1:34:32] to come before us to prove the
[1:34:34] authenticity of what we already had and
[1:34:36] we find that though translators may
[1:34:38] fight each other scripts do not
[1:34:42] hallelujah
[1:34:44] and so many times the reason we think
[1:34:45] that there's a problem is because we're
[1:34:47] reading it wrong
[1:34:49] i don't know that any of you do that i'm
[1:34:50] just preaching on a level where we could
[1:34:52] all just kind of build from this morning
[1:34:55] and so the people but you watch the
[1:34:57] devil try to talk you out of it if
[1:34:58] there's something you know you should do
[1:34:59] and your flesh don't want to do it you
[1:35:01] think your flesh is above trying to get
[1:35:03] you to believe the bible's been
[1:35:05] mistranslated
[1:35:08] well i've been in a message for 50 years
[1:35:10] but you think satan won't try that if he
[1:35:12] can on you right sure if that's a
[1:35:15] weakness if you're a if you're a type of
[1:35:17] guy that's educated and you kind of you
[1:35:19] like to study and you like to do those
[1:35:20] things or a woman who likes to think and
[1:35:22] about these things and get into the word
[1:35:24] and the devil will try to use that
[1:35:26] against you to try to get you to think
[1:35:27] well it's been mistranslated there's
[1:35:29] something wrong with it but see it's
[1:35:30] because you're reading it wrong in the
[1:35:32] first place you don't read the bible
[1:35:33] like a legal document or a newspaper but
[1:35:36] in nehemiah 8 and 8 it says that the
[1:35:37] priest gave the sense read the law of
[1:35:40] god distinctly he gave the sins caused
[1:35:42] him to understand the reading it wasn't
[1:35:44] read like a legal document luke 10 and
[1:35:46] 21 in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit
[1:35:48] and said i thank the o father lord of
[1:35:50] heaven and earth that thou hast hid
[1:35:51] these things from the wise and prudent
[1:35:53] has to reveal them unto babes even so
[1:35:55] father for so it seemed good in thy
[1:35:57] sight
[1:35:58] and so he taught us read between the
[1:36:00] lines
[1:36:02] right
[1:36:03] and and that's something that other men
[1:36:05] have said as well i there's an
[1:36:06] illustration a mortimer adler wrote a
[1:36:09] book called how to read a book
[1:36:11] of course the people who needed to know
[1:36:12] how to read a book never read it
[1:36:14] but he wrote a book called how to read a
[1:36:16] book
[1:36:17] in that book he observed that the one
[1:36:18] time people read for all their worth is
[1:36:20] when they're in love
[1:36:23] and they're reading a love letter
[1:36:25] they read every word three ways
[1:36:27] they read between the lines and in the
[1:36:28] margins they read the whole in terms of
[1:36:31] the parts each part in terms of the
[1:36:33] whole they grow sensitive to context and
[1:36:35] ambiguity you know they begin to read
[1:36:37] what is he really saying here what's he
[1:36:39] saying here
[1:36:41] they perceive the color of words the
[1:36:43] order of phrases the weight of sentences
[1:36:45] they may even take the punctuation into
[1:36:47] account
[1:36:48] he said then if never before after they
[1:36:50] read carefully and in depth why because
[1:36:53] they're in love
[1:36:54] and they want to know what the what the
[1:36:56] author said
[1:36:58] oh church that ought to be us today we
[1:37:00] want to know what the author's saying
[1:37:02] let's read in depth let's look over it
[1:37:04] let's get into it let's find out what a
[1:37:06] prophet said about it let's read about
[1:37:09] it it's a love letter to us
[1:37:12] amen
[1:37:14] but the brown said that's the way you
[1:37:15] know this love book of gods
[1:37:17] amen this love book of gods he said the
[1:37:20] reason it's so complicated to people
[1:37:21] you're not in love with christ
[1:37:23] you say it contradicts itself and all
[1:37:24] this you're just not in love with the
[1:37:26] author that's all it's a love letter
[1:37:29] it's a love letter oh it's to be read by
[1:37:31] somebody who's in love and there ain't
[1:37:33] nobody on the earth in love with him but
[1:37:35] his bride
[1:37:37] are you with me today they're not in
[1:37:38] love with him they're in love with what
[1:37:39] they think he is
[1:37:41] but we're in love with him who is the
[1:37:43] word
[1:37:45] amen revelation only comes from the
[1:37:47] author itself first corinthians two and
[1:37:48] nine as it is written eye has not seen
[1:37:50] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[1:37:52] the heart of man the things which god
[1:37:54] has prepared for them that love him i
[1:37:56] may be going too fast here but you just
[1:37:57] write it down and go back or go back and
[1:37:59] listen to it or go and listen to some of
[1:38:01] the sermons brother branham preached
[1:38:03] about it he said but god hath revealed
[1:38:05] them unto us by his spirit for the
[1:38:06] spirit searches all things gave the deep
[1:38:08] things of god for what man knoweth the
[1:38:11] things of a man save the spirit of man
[1:38:12] which is in him even so the things of
[1:38:14] god knoweth no man but the spirit of god
[1:38:17] no man knows the things of god
[1:38:19] but the spirit of god now we have
[1:38:21] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:38:22] the spirit which is of god we might know
[1:38:24] the things that are freely given to us
[1:38:26] of god so it's not a dead letter we're
[1:38:28] reading it with the spirit he said which
[1:38:30] things also we speak not in the words
[1:38:31] which man's wisdom teacheth or in other
[1:38:33] words not the things that man says makes
[1:38:35] sense
[1:38:36] not men's reasoning not the words which
[1:38:39] man's wisdom teaches but which the holy
[1:38:40] ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:38:43] things with spiritual it's very
[1:38:44] important you don't compare spiritual
[1:38:46] things with carnal things
[1:38:48] you don't run the church like a business
[1:38:51] right you you don't you don't compare
[1:38:53] spiritual things with carnal things
[1:38:55] spiritual things are compared with
[1:38:56] spiritual things but the natural man
[1:38:59] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:39:00] of god but they are foolishness unto him
[1:39:02] neither can he know them because they
[1:39:04] are spiritually discerned so you got to
[1:39:06] be born again in order to fall in love
[1:39:08] with the author so you can read the book
[1:39:10] right are you with me this morning
[1:39:14] and when you have that revelation when
[1:39:15] you are born again of the spirit of god
[1:39:17] this book will line up from genesis to
[1:39:19] revelation
[1:39:20] and then the message which is the light
[1:39:22] on those scriptures not satan's false
[1:39:24] sight but god's promised life will begin
[1:39:26] to shine and it'll begin to make known
[1:39:28] unto you what god said listen revelation
[1:39:30] 10 and 7 says in the days of the voice
[1:39:32] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:39:34] to sound the mystery of god should be
[1:39:35] finished as he has declared to his
[1:39:38] servants the prophets in other words as
[1:39:39] it is written in the scriptures
[1:39:41] he said zechariah 14 7 but it shall be
[1:39:44] one day which shall be known to the lord
[1:39:46] not day in or night but it shall come to
[1:39:47] pass at evening time it shall be light
[1:39:51] not it shall be more word or a different
[1:39:52] book but it shall be light
[1:39:55] light on the scripture
[1:39:57] amen
[1:39:59] amen now we're going to get serious here
[1:40:00] because i'm out of time
[1:40:03] this isn't just any book
[1:40:06] don't mess with it
[1:40:10] i need to turn around and tell myself
[1:40:11] that
[1:40:14] don't mess with it
[1:40:17] life or death
[1:40:20] you can pull things out of there and
[1:40:22] hold people by fear
[1:40:24] destroy their lives
[1:40:27] huh
[1:40:29] you can take
[1:40:30] you can take the message out or do the
[1:40:32] same thing
[1:40:34] ruin people with it don't mess with it
[1:40:37] don't add to it that's what the devil
[1:40:38] did
[1:40:40] revelation 22 18 for i testify to every
[1:40:42] man that heareth the words of the
[1:40:43] prophecy of this book if any man shall
[1:40:45] add unto these things
[1:40:47] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[1:40:50] are written in this book
[1:40:51] and if any man shall take away from the
[1:40:53] words of the book of this prophecy
[1:40:55] god shall take away his part
[1:40:58] out of the book of life
[1:41:00] this is someone who had been a believer
[1:41:03] and had somehow gotten in his name was
[1:41:06] in the book of life
[1:41:09] was not bright you can't have taken your
[1:41:10] name taken off the lamb's book of life
[1:41:12] that part of the book of life which is
[1:41:14] reserved to the elect
[1:41:17] but but here is someone who had their
[1:41:18] name taken out of the book of life
[1:41:21] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:41:23] things which are written in this book
[1:41:25] you know what the the hard part to me
[1:41:27] brother joel is not what he says he'll
[1:41:28] take his name out of the book of life
[1:41:30] but that means that he'll have his name
[1:41:31] taken out of the holy city
[1:41:34] and he won't get to experience
[1:41:36] the the new city then he won't get to
[1:41:39] experience the wonders of heaven
[1:41:42] why because he messed with the book
[1:41:46] oh god
[1:41:50] jonathan edwards shook this nation
[1:41:52] preaching a sermon
[1:41:53] called sinners in the hands of an angry
[1:41:55] god
[1:41:58] he took his text from deuteronomy 32 and
[1:42:00] 35 he said to me belong with vengeance
[1:42:02] and recompense and he highlighted these
[1:42:05] words their foot shall slide in due time
[1:42:10] he said for the day of their calamities
[1:42:11] at hand and the things that shall come
[1:42:12] upon them make haste
[1:42:15] today the bible is mocked ridiculed torn
[1:42:17] apart
[1:42:18] manhandled
[1:42:20] don't put your hands on it
[1:42:22] it's the word
[1:42:26] god's word
[1:42:28] their foot shall sight in due time
[1:42:31] in other words he said you're walking he
[1:42:33] said if you're if you're wicked and this
[1:42:34] is the way that he put it to the people
[1:42:36] he said if you're wicked you're walking
[1:42:38] on brittle threads
[1:42:40] over hell
[1:42:43] you're walking on ropes that are giving
[1:42:45] way right as you walk on them and you're
[1:42:48] standing over hell and you're walking on
[1:42:50] those ropes and you're about to fall in
[1:42:52] their foot shall sight in due time
[1:42:56] rocked the nation with that sermon and
[1:42:57] there was a revival the great awakening
[1:42:59] is what they call it
[1:43:02] listen but the brethren said tonight my
[1:43:04] brethren your soul is over hell
[1:43:06] on a chain
[1:43:09] well it's not important what the bible
[1:43:10] says about how i dress or what i do
[1:43:13] hear me this morning
[1:43:17] your soul is hanging
[1:43:20] on a chain
[1:43:22] yes and that chain is not some
[1:43:25] theological seminary's teaching
[1:43:29] that chain is not some denomination or
[1:43:31] some creed that you're living by
[1:43:33] that chain is god's word
[1:43:36] and as i've told you recently you might
[1:43:38] go home and say well i i believe
[1:43:39] everything brother ben says i believe in
[1:43:41] my pastor i believe he's a man of god
[1:43:42] i'll take what he says listen you are
[1:43:44] not hanging over hell
[1:43:47] by a chain of my words
[1:43:51] or any other man's words
[1:43:53] but by what god said
[1:43:58] he said it's a chain
[1:44:00] you're hanging over hell with it
[1:44:03] and that's the only thing that'll carry
[1:44:05] you through
[1:44:08] oh god i want to make it don't you
[1:44:11] listen to this he said when the believer
[1:44:13] becomes a make-believer and lives on one
[1:44:16] word
[1:44:17] that's contrary to this word he cuts his
[1:44:20] fellowship with god
[1:44:23] one link
[1:44:25] broke
[1:44:27] a chain is its strongest at its weakest
[1:44:30] link or we can say it this way it's only
[1:44:31] as strong
[1:44:33] as its weakest
[1:44:34] link
[1:44:35] your faith in the word will only hold
[1:44:39] by its weakest link
[1:44:41] by the verse you believe the least
[1:44:45] are you with me now oh i believe jesus
[1:44:47] is my savior
[1:44:49] but we've got to believe all of it
[1:44:51] yes sir
[1:44:52] amen well this ought to encourage our
[1:44:54] faith today
[1:44:57] he said if there's something in the word
[1:44:58] that's puzzling to you
[1:45:00] something that you've heard different
[1:45:03] but they said oh the oh oh that was for
[1:45:05] the apostles them things was for days
[1:45:07] gone by in other words it's not for you
[1:45:09] that's for somebody else
[1:45:11] it's eve's interpreter
[1:45:13] he said when the scripture said jesus
[1:45:15] christ is the same
[1:45:17] do we believe that today
[1:45:19] yesterday today and forever don't let
[1:45:21] that be a weakness
[1:45:24] now watch this morning
[1:45:28] your life is hanging by a chain of the
[1:45:30] word only as strong as its weakest link
[1:45:32] your life then is hanging on your under
[1:45:35] on your belief that god is a healer
[1:45:38] as well as your belief that god is a
[1:45:40] savior
[1:45:41] on your faith that god still has
[1:45:45] what he says he has
[1:45:48] right your life is hanging on genesis 1
[1:45:51] 1.
[1:45:52] you created the heavens and the earth
[1:45:53] your life is hanging on ephesians 4 11.
[1:45:58] you can take any verse of it but say
[1:46:00] well we can take that out it don't
[1:46:01] matter it ceased
[1:46:03] your life's hanging on it
[1:46:06] right how can you be the bride
[1:46:09] and refuse part of the dress
[1:46:13] you see what i'm saying this one is
[1:46:14] serious i don't mean to
[1:46:16] be a downer this morning but it's
[1:46:19] serious
[1:46:20] do i believe every word or do i make
[1:46:22] excuses for myself
[1:46:25] or for somebody else
[1:46:28] he says
[1:46:29] them things was for days gone by when
[1:46:31] the scripture said jesus christ was is
[1:46:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:46:34] don't let that be a weakness listen if
[1:46:37] you if you find yourself with something
[1:46:39] you you don't understand you're puzzled
[1:46:40] about you're worried about it don't let
[1:46:42] it be a weakness
[1:46:44] don't shy away from it
[1:46:47] are you hearing me don't don't pull back
[1:46:49] and say well i i just don't really know
[1:46:51] if i should really be the kind of wife
[1:46:52] that god wants me to be i don't really
[1:46:54] know if i should really be the kind of
[1:46:55] husband the kind of child the kind of
[1:46:56] pastor the kind of deacon that he wants
[1:46:58] me to be i don't really know if what he
[1:47:00] wrote in the word about these things is
[1:47:01] really true or not maybe i should just
[1:47:03] let it slide maybe it doesn't matter if
[1:47:04] i go to church maybe it doesn't matter
[1:47:06] you see what i'm saying
[1:47:08] our life is hung by its weakest link
[1:47:11] but aren't you glad the mercy of god
[1:47:13] provided us the holy ghost that we could
[1:47:16] have his spirit that he could teach us
[1:47:18] what to do and what god meant by what he
[1:47:20] said are you hear me today
[1:47:23] he could teach us the word of god and he
[1:47:25] will not let us fall
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:28] amen but now he said don't let that be a
[1:47:30] weakness
[1:47:31] fortify it
[1:47:33] hold it
[1:47:34] wrap your life into it whatever that
[1:47:37] weak link is whatever that part of the
[1:47:38] word is it's so hard for you to
[1:47:40] understand well i just have a problem
[1:47:42] with god sending a prophet i have a
[1:47:43] problem with all these things find what
[1:47:45] that word is and fortify it
[1:47:48] don't let that be a weakness that's
[1:47:50] where satan will attack you
[1:47:54] it doesn't really matter how people live
[1:47:56] it doesn't really know
[1:47:57] find where it's a weakness
[1:47:59] and don't walk away from it don't ignore
[1:48:00] it fortify it and hold it
[1:48:02] wrap your life into it
[1:48:06] otherwise i may have a temper but god
[1:48:08] told me that the wrath of god doesn't
[1:48:10] work the righteous the wrath of man
[1:48:11] doesn't work the righteousness of god
[1:48:14] that's the word i'm going to wrap myself
[1:48:15] in that
[1:48:17] angry and sin not no don't let the sun
[1:48:19] go down on your wrath i'm gonna wrap
[1:48:21] myself in that
[1:48:23] whatever it is you could go to whatever
[1:48:24] it is in your life
[1:48:26] i'm gonna fortify that hold it
[1:48:28] because it's the only thing that'll ever
[1:48:30] take me
[1:48:31] over the flames of hell
[1:48:33] we bow our heads as musicians come this
[1:48:35] morning
[1:48:47] what do you have trouble with
[1:48:50] give it to god this morning
[1:48:53] lord i'm going to wrap myself in your
[1:48:54] word
[1:48:56] it may be hard for me to understand why
[1:48:57] a woman shouldn't wear pants
[1:49:00] shouldn't cut her hair but it's your
[1:49:02] word lord
[1:49:04] let me wrap myself into it
[1:49:08] don't let me fall lord
[1:49:11] i know by my own reasoning i'll talk
[1:49:13] myself out of heaven
[1:49:16] i'll talk myself out of eden like like
[1:49:18] eve did
[1:49:21] i'll listen to things that aren't right
[1:49:23] i'll hear things how will i know what i
[1:49:24] hear i'll hear you let me hear your word
[1:49:26] lord let me hear only your word
[1:49:32] let me hear the blessings of god but
[1:49:34] also let me hear the warning
[1:49:36] i want to be one who lives by all the
[1:49:38] word of god
[1:49:40] where i haven't forgive me lord i
[1:49:42] believe i have an advocate
[1:49:44] with the father
[1:49:46] i'd spend the rest of my life
[1:49:49] dealing with the condemnation of the
[1:49:50] past but let me move forward lord
[1:49:54] where that chain was weak let let me let
[1:49:56] that become my fortified place
[1:50:00] the place where
[1:50:03] where i used to have a problem i just
[1:50:05] said well it don't matter church doesn't
[1:50:07] matter but now that's my fortified place
[1:50:10] maybe my family did things a certain way
[1:50:12] and they all fought and fussed and
[1:50:13] argued but now peace is my fortified
[1:50:15] place
[1:50:17] where everybody's sick all the time and
[1:50:19] and others just constantly disease
[1:50:21] running in my family but let that become
[1:50:23] my fortified place
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:26] i know you'll get sick but let healing
[1:50:28] be your fortified place don't let the
[1:50:31] devil talk you out of healing because
[1:50:32] you get sick
[1:50:34] lord i'm gonna be fortified by the word
[1:50:37] there's someone here that want to raise
[1:50:38] their hand and say brother ben i want to
[1:50:39] be fortified by that word
[1:50:42] i want to be i want to that chain to be
[1:50:44] at its strongest
[1:50:46] i know i'm hanging
[1:50:48] by god's grace his word to me is his
[1:50:50] grace
[1:50:51] god bless those hands today
[1:50:53] my hand says well i want to be fortified
[1:50:55] lord help me not to reason my way out of
[1:50:57] it

[1:51:02] lord jesus
[1:51:04] i want to be so strong
[1:51:06] in the areas lord where i may have had
[1:51:09] weakness or misunderstanding
[1:51:11] let me be so strong that i can believe
[1:51:13] your word
[1:51:14] that i can hear it lord in the way it
[1:51:16] was intended to be
[1:51:18] lord may that be my fortified place
[1:51:21] as we see so many times someone who has
[1:51:23] been delivered from smoking or from
[1:51:25] drinking it becomes a strong place in
[1:51:27] their life
[1:51:28] that they are fortified there they know
[1:51:29] the danger of it
[1:51:31] oh god may it be so with each and every
[1:51:33] one of us lord if it's if it's lying if
[1:51:35] it's stealing if it's if it's just a
[1:51:39] critical spirit
[1:51:40] lord we know your word is against that
[1:51:43] may we be fortified lord may it become
[1:51:46] our a place lord if we're selfish if we
[1:51:49] don't give like we should lord and not
[1:51:51] not money but in giving of ourselves oh
[1:51:54] god
[1:51:55] may that become a fortified place in our
[1:51:57] lives
[1:51:58] lord may we believe your word wrap
[1:52:00] ourselves into it lord and we will be
[1:52:04] strong we will be solid we will be
[1:52:05] secure
[1:52:07] even though hell still lies underneath
[1:52:10] but we cannot go there we are secured by
[1:52:12] your word
[1:52:14] and by your holy spirit which is a seal
[1:52:16] until the day of our redemption

[1:52:21] i pray you bless these people
[1:52:23] lord i pray you'd reveal to these
[1:52:25] children
[1:52:26] the seriousness lord of the word and the
[1:52:28] wonder of it
[1:52:30] or it helped them to go and look and see
[1:52:33] that they could see
[1:52:36] the prophets in your word they can see
[1:52:37] brother branham in the word they can see
[1:52:39] those things oh god but help them most
[1:52:41] of all to see themselves
[1:52:44] hard to see to look in that mirror and
[1:52:46] say mama that's me
[1:52:48] that's me i was baptized i i come to
[1:52:51] christ and so now i'm a believer
