[46:39] the word you may be
[46:43] seated if the things that you own are a
[46:46] good measure of
[46:48] prosperity then you could not call
[46:51] Joseph A prosperous
[46:53] man he didn't own anything as a slave if
[46:57] you don't own property you are owned and
[47:00] so he had been sold into slavery and he
[47:04] was no longer considered a land owner or
[47:08] an owner of sheep or of cattle or able
[47:11] to inherit or do any of those things
[47:13] because he was a slave but the thing
[47:16] about Joseph is that no matter where you
[47:19] put him no matter what the conditions
[47:22] were he ended up being the winner he
[47:26] just want of them guys that just seem
[47:28] like they always ended up being the
[47:30] winner have you ever played a board game
[47:32] with somebody like that it didn't matter
[47:34] if they'd never played before or or or
[47:36] if they didn't know anything about the
[47:37] rules and you get to the end of the game
[47:40] they won and it's just always the way
[47:42] that it is you get you get through it
[47:44] and and they won and Joseph was that guy
[47:47] he just always turned up he's like a uh
[47:50] he he's like something a cat that'll
[47:52] just always land on its feet and and so
[47:55] Joseph always ended up up on his feet
[47:57] that wasn't because of his even his
[48:00] abilities as a human being but that's
[48:03] because he was chosen by God to be a
[48:06] type of Christ and we have been chosen
[48:09] by God to be uh to be Christ to be to
[48:12] represent Christ in the world that we
[48:15] live in now we know that Prosperity is
[48:18] not being a person with no opposition
[48:21] but Prosperity is being a person who
[48:24] overcomes opposition the word the word
[48:26] that Hebrew word for Prosperity is
[48:29] literally to go over or through as a
[48:32] river so in other words if there's an
[48:34] obstacle in the way if you have water
[48:38] it'll find a way or if you're coming to
[48:41] a body of water once you pass it that's
[48:44] Prosperity you've passed it but a river
[48:48] if you think about it as a river it's
[48:50] it's flowing and it's finding a way and
[48:53] anything that put that you put in its
[48:55] way if there's enough water it's going
[48:57] to overcome it so you you can build a
[49:00] dam and the water will go over it you
[49:02] can uh you can put something in this way
[49:04] it'll go around it or go under it or
[49:06] it'll cut through it no matter what's in
[49:08] its way the water prospers or it
[49:11] continues on its way that word is also
[49:14] used to attack or or to fall on it's
[49:16] used the spirit of Jehovah falling Upon
[49:20] A man so it's a it finds a way the
[49:24] spirit of God finds a way to Pro prosper
[49:27] in other words it's going to prove it's
[49:29] going to do what it was intended to do
[49:31] we know that a man or a woman and that's
[49:33] all of us here today we either men or
[49:36] women we've been chosen by God for a
[49:40] particular purpose and I believe all of
[49:41] us have that because we're chosen by God
[49:45] to be the bride our purpose will not
[49:48] fail it cannot fail because God chose us
[49:52] for that that gives me great comfort
[49:54] because many times I look at myself
[49:57] as a failure I might look at somebody
[49:58] else and say well they don't seem like
[50:00] they're able but the water finds a way
[50:04] they will be prosperous because of who
[50:06] they are not because of what uh what
[50:09] gifts they have or what kind of person
[50:11] they are but because God chose them so
[50:14] we know that I'm going to have to slow
[50:16] down here a little bit we know elaser
[50:18] was sent by Abraham with a purpose and
[50:22] his purpose was to find Isaac a wife
[50:26] and the Bible says he prospered in that
[50:28] in fact he told her family he said unto
[50:30] them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath
[50:34] prospered my way send me a way that I
[50:37] may go to my master it's that same word
[50:40] that we found a way he didn't know how
[50:41] it was going to happen in fact he got
[50:43] down on his knees he said Lord he said
[50:46] if you'll only uh let allow this certain
[50:48] things to happen and and the girl that
[50:50] comes out at a certain time and feeds
[50:52] the camels and let that be my prosperity
[50:56] and so he said said now the Lord has
[50:57] prospered my way and I want you to know
[51:00] that he was successful in bringing the
[51:02] right woman to the right man and I
[51:05] believe that in this hour we've had an
[51:06] elaser we've had somebody that stood up
[51:09] and and and and preached the message to
[51:12] us and and what he did what was he doing
[51:14] he was calling a bride and and God's
[51:17] servant was prosperous in doing that I
[51:19] don't believe he failed at his mission
[51:21] but I believe we're the result of that
[51:23] prosperity of the message
[51:28] so the reason the message is prosperous
[51:30] today is because God's servant was
[51:33] chosen to do a particular
[51:36] task we
[51:38] have prosperity in Joseph's life but it
[51:42] doesn't always look at what we would
[51:44] think of as Prosperity doesn't always
[51:45] look like that in Genesis 39 and3 it
[51:50] says his master saw that the Lord was
[51:54] with him and that the Lord made all that
[51:56] he did to prosper in his hands now think
[51:58] You' got a a big house a house full of
[52:02] slaves so there's there's all kinds of
[52:05] servants served in Piper's house he's a
[52:09] a a man who's very close to the throne
[52:12] he's a captain of the guard and so Piper
[52:15] is a very rich man a very wealthy man
[52:17] very powerful man and so he uh he he
[52:21] chose Joseph as a slave remember Joseph
[52:23] is 17 years old and he gets taken into
[52:26] into slavery he ends up in this big
[52:29] house and somehow his star rises above
[52:32] all the others because and and maybe we
[52:35] don't know how hard he worked or
[52:37] anything like that but God just caused
[52:39] what he did to prosper it says the the
[52:42] Lord made all that he did to prosper in
[52:46] his hand so in other words when Joseph
[52:49] did it it was it was more blessed than
[52:51] when somebody else did it and you may
[52:54] not realize it today but whatever you're
[52:56] doing God can prosper that it may not
[53:00] look like prosperity to others you may
[53:02] feel like you're even in a in a dead in
[53:04] job but whatever you do whatever you put
[53:06] your hand to you're a son or a daughter
[53:09] of prosperity and God can prosper that
[53:12] now he said and Joseph found Grace in
[53:15] his sight and he served him and he made
[53:18] him overseer over his house so he moves
[53:21] up into a management position in the
[53:24] company if we could put it like that and
[53:26] all that he had he put into his hand and
[53:30] it came to pass from the time that he
[53:33] had made him Overseer in his house and
[53:36] over all that he had that the Lord
[53:39] blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's
[53:42] sake oh I remember brother Stuart I
[53:45] think it was brother Ivy used to tell us
[53:47] God will bless your boss for employing
[53:49] you and I believe that's the truth that
[53:51] that when we work somewhere God will
[53:53] bless even our even our boss even the
[53:55] community that we live in even it'll be
[53:58] blessed brother Joe even a even a
[54:00] funeral home is blessed cuz you're there
[54:02] and even even wherever it is that you
[54:05] work it's blessed because you work there
[54:07] so I don't think we should hide oursel
[54:09] from the community I think we ought to
[54:11] work I think we ought to go out and and
[54:13] be a part of the community and be a part
[54:15] of of the world oh it's it's bad there's
[54:17] enough bad people out there there's
[54:18] enough people that don't pay their taxes
[54:20] there's enough people that that that
[54:22] ride in the streets there's enough
[54:23] people that steal and kill and destroy
[54:25] let's be a people who are a credit to
[54:27] the society that we live in let's be
[54:30] somebody that can be a credit if anybody
[54:32] can be a credit to society if anybody
[54:34] can be a good citizen that ought to be a
[54:37] Christian so the Lord blessed the
[54:40] Egyptians house and the blessing of the
[54:43] Lord was upon all that he had in the
[54:46] house and all that he had in the
[54:49] field and he left all that he had in
[54:53] Joseph's hand and he knew not thought he
[54:56] had save the bread which he did eat so
[55:00] in other words Joseph was
[55:03] responsible for everything in Piper's
[55:06] house and Joseph was a goodly person and
[55:10] well
[55:11] favored now we know that when you are
[55:14] prosperous in what God has done for you
[55:17] look for the devil yeah come on now
[55:20] right to try to tempt you out of that
[55:23] Prosperity right he's going to try to
[55:25] take you out of that and many times
[55:28] gifted people and talented people are
[55:30] tempted out of that by the devil and so
[55:34] but we've got to have a character to be
[55:35] able to stand that Temptation so
[55:38] remember again I keep stressing this
[55:40] point but it's important Joseph has to
[55:42] grow up during this time and when he
[55:44] first goes to Piper's house he's 17
[55:46] years old we don't know how old he was
[55:48] at the time that this happened but we
[55:51] know that he wasn't an old man because
[55:53] he was only 30 when he went to the
[55:55] throne so he was a young
[55:58] man and I don't want to pick on young
[56:00] men tonight and we're just going to go
[56:02] through this briefly and we'll move on
[56:03] cuz I got something else I want to say
[56:06] but young men are more prone to this
[56:08] temptation than old men and all the old
[56:11] men can say
[56:14] Amen wow I didn't go very
[56:18] far thank you brother
[56:20] Caleb and so when when Joseph was sold
[56:23] into slavery 17 years old so he's not
[56:25] very old
[56:27] maybe sometime in his
[56:29] 20s verse 7 it came to pass after these
[56:32] things he was
[56:34] prosperous that his master's Wife cast
[56:36] her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie
[56:38] with me that's pretty
[56:41] Brazen but it would have been normal
[56:43] behavior in
[56:45] Egypt normal isn't
[56:48] right I want you young people to
[56:50] understand that you young men what I
[56:52] want to challenge you with that whether
[56:54] you're here or sitting in the back
[56:55] wherever you normal isn't right just
[56:58] because Normal boyfriends do that to
[57:00] their girlfriends don't make it right
[57:01] for you just because Normal girlfriends
[57:04] and boyfriends or fian or everybody
[57:07] wants to do just whatever they want to
[57:08] do well I saw it on a movie well that
[57:10] don't make it right I saw some other
[57:12] message Church did it that don't make it
[57:15] right we got to abide by the word don't
[57:18] go by what's normal the world the normal
[57:21] world's going to hell the normal world's
[57:24] going to end up in the wrong place the
[57:26] normal family is broken up the normal
[57:28] person is stressed out and in chaos all
[57:31] the time I don't want to be normal I
[57:33] want to be something different from
[57:36] normal I want to challenge you young
[57:38] people don't be normal don't be like
[57:40] everybody else be like the word be like
[57:45] Christ this would have been normal
[57:47] behavior but this is not normal behavior
[57:49] he
[57:52] refused and said unto his master's wife
[57:55] behold my master WTH not what is with me
[57:57] in the house and he has committed all
[57:59] that he has to my hands so in other
[58:00] words he says I have a responsibility
[58:03] sir I have a responsibility there's none
[58:06] greater in this house than I neither ha
[58:07] he kept back anything from me but thee
[58:10] because thou are his wife how then can I
[58:12] do this great wickedness and sin against
[58:14] God so it's Integrity doing the right
[58:18] thing for the right
[58:20] reasons
[58:22] right but she didn't quit and the devil
[58:24] didn't quit yeah
[58:28] and if you're tempted you'll continue to
[58:30] be tempted and I I'll say this and cuz I
[58:33] didn't get much response for the older
[58:35] one saying it gets better and I I do
[58:38] know that it doesn't go
[58:40] away Temptation
[58:44] continues and I've seen old men that
[58:46] fall in the same way Genesis
[58:50] 3910 came to pass that she spake to
[58:52] Joseph day by day
[58:57] that he hearkened not unto her to lie by
[59:00] her or to be with
[59:02] her Oh my he didn't give in
[59:05] any right and it came to pass about this
[59:08] time that Joseph went into the house to
[59:09] do his business and watch what happened
[59:11] so the devil is going to set a trap for
[59:14] him all right cuz he can't get him to
[59:16] give in by just directly coming to him
[59:19] like that so he's going to set a trap
[59:21] for him you got to watch out for those
[59:24] traps right ID is a trap of the
[59:28] devil and and it's not good for a man to
[59:31] be idle a man needs to work and because
[59:34] idleness is a trap that the devil sets
[59:36] and even stress can be a trap right
[59:40] right and even maybe you you get in a
[59:42] fight with your wife or you get in a
[59:44] fight with somebody at work and then
[59:46] you're just all that can be a trap and
[59:47] that's when the devil tries to move in
[59:50] and tempt you in that moment now Joseph
[59:52] this trap was that there was none of the
[59:55] men of the house there within so it was
[59:56] an opportunity for something to happen
[1:00:00] or for a lie to be
[1:00:02] told right so the best way to keep our
[1:00:05] integrity again I'm not preaching on
[1:00:07] this tonight but I got to go through it
[1:00:08] because it's what I've approached in in
[1:00:10] Joseph we got to tell this part of his
[1:00:12] life too right to declare the whole
[1:00:15] gospel so the best way to keep your
[1:00:17] integrity is to limit opportunities for
[1:00:20] Temptation right and so brother Baron
[1:00:23] talks about many times he said I go to
[1:00:24] houses and there's women standing out
[1:00:26] there and I go to the house and knock on
[1:00:27] the door and a sister would come to the
[1:00:29] door come in brother Brandon if her
[1:00:30] husband's not there unless it's a case
[1:00:32] of sickness and somebody with me I don't
[1:00:34] go right right so we got to limit that
[1:00:37] and you say brother Ben who you
[1:00:38] preaching at I'm preaching at
[1:00:40] me right you say well that's pretty
[1:00:43] that's pretty strong well I recognize
[1:00:46] that I'm human and so are
[1:00:48] you right if you don't know that you're
[1:00:51] going to find it out one
[1:00:53] day I think of you know brother B talked
[1:00:56] about that was his policy and he goes on
[1:00:58] to tell ministers that it should be
[1:01:00] their policy and doing that and taking
[1:01:02] sides with Jesus Billy Graham was known
[1:01:04] for his moral Integrity the reason was
[1:01:07] is because he protected himself he had a
[1:01:10] rule that stated that the man of God
[1:01:12] will not be alone with a woman other
[1:01:13] than his wife or a relative a close
[1:01:16] relative he will not share meals with a
[1:01:17] woman alone will not counsel a woman
[1:01:19] alone will not go places with a woman
[1:01:21] alone and Mike Pence you remember here a
[1:01:23] few years ago uh he come out with that
[1:01:25] that same thing the vice president at
[1:01:27] the time and and said that was their
[1:01:29] rule in their marriage and people
[1:01:30] ridiculed him and mocked him and laughed
[1:01:32] at him but I guarantee you'll have a lot
[1:01:34] less trouble than some of these other
[1:01:36] guys right that don't have that
[1:01:39] rule see because we all have to deal
[1:01:42] with that every man especially every
[1:01:44] young man is going to deal with that but
[1:01:46] you've been G you've been called to
[1:01:48] Prosperity so I don't want this to be
[1:01:50] discouraging tonight I want you to
[1:01:52] understand you've been called to
[1:01:54] something you've been called for the
[1:01:55] river to find a way you've been called
[1:01:57] for it to overcome the obstacle and
[1:01:59] Joseph was called to that and to deal
[1:02:03] with it he said well I made a mistake
[1:02:04] deal with it and move on because you're
[1:02:06] going to be prosperous God called you to
[1:02:08] be yes all
[1:02:11] right and so so she caught him by His
[1:02:14] Garment saying lie with me and he left
[1:02:17] his garment in her hand and fled what
[1:02:21] did he do he
[1:02:23] ran and got him out
[1:02:27] you want to know how to deal with
[1:02:29] Temptation This is how to deal with it
[1:02:31] right here don't try to be a big man and
[1:02:33] say in there and say well I'll just
[1:02:35] resist the devil yeah you can resist the
[1:02:37] devil and he'll flee from you but every
[1:02:39] place in the scripture says to flee from
[1:02:41] this specific thing flee from it I lose
[1:02:45] my my mic feel like I lost my mic
[1:02:49] completely because I didn't change the
[1:02:52] battery it says flee from it now 1
[1:02:55] Corinthians 618 flee
[1:02:57] fornication 2 Timothy 2:22 flee youthful
[1:03:00] lust in other words
[1:03:03] run right run why brother brother Ben I
[1:03:08] don't need to you know I've gotten older
[1:03:09] and I can just hang out with women it
[1:03:11] don't bother me a bit
[1:03:15] flee but now I want you to understand I
[1:03:17] want our young people espe to understand
[1:03:19] it's not a sin to be
[1:03:20] tempted right and how do we know that
[1:03:23] because we have a we have a high priest
[1:03:25] which not a high priest which cannot be
[1:03:27] touched with the feeling of our
[1:03:28] infirmities but was in all points
[1:03:30] someone say all points tempted see
[1:03:33] Joseph was a
[1:03:35] type right of Christ and Christ was in
[1:03:38] all points tempted like as we are yet
[1:03:42] without sin yeah we overcome we have to
[1:03:46] overcome that's what the river does it's
[1:03:47] got to overcome and we overcome by
[1:03:50] humility oh my by humility brother BR
[1:03:54] says this he saides Jesus told us how to
[1:03:56] do it he overcome overcome means to
[1:03:59] stand the test he said that's right like
[1:04:02] all the old Saints did like Jesus did
[1:04:04] amidst all of his enemies he stood the
[1:04:06] test everything he was tested against he
[1:04:09] stood it in the very face of sickness
[1:04:11] him being oh church are you with me
[1:04:12] tonight him being Messiah he healed them
[1:04:14] in the face of death he brought it back
[1:04:16] to life in the face of Calvary his own
[1:04:18] death he defeated it by surrendering
[1:04:20] himself do you see what I'm talking
[1:04:21] about there's a way to overcome you
[1:04:23] don't have to give in it right Why by
[1:04:26] the word said you destroy this Temple
[1:04:28] I'll raise it up in three days the word
[1:04:30] said so and in the presence of death he
[1:04:32] defeated it he overcome death in the
[1:04:34] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[1:04:36] overcome hell in the presence of the
[1:04:38] Grave he overcome the grave why all by
[1:04:40] the word and humility where does
[1:04:43] humility come in brother Ben humility
[1:04:45] and understanding I'm a human being and
[1:04:47] I could mess up I could do something
[1:04:49] wrong so I'm going to overcome I'm going
[1:04:51] to keep the word that says shield around
[1:04:53] me and I'm going to believe what God
[1:04:56] Said and do what God
[1:04:58] said I'm not going to get arrogant and
[1:05:00] say it couldn't happen to
[1:05:02] me
[1:05:04] right look what he says he said in the
[1:05:07] presence of death he defeated he
[1:05:09] defeated hell he defeated everything he
[1:05:11] said there's the real man there's the
[1:05:12] one to make your example oh my look at
[1:05:16] this quote look Temptation was for him
[1:05:21] yeah he said you know that the Bible
[1:05:23] said he was tempted are are y'all
[1:05:24] listening
[1:05:26] are you young people listening
[1:05:28] Temptation was for him the Bible said he
[1:05:30] was tempted in all some say all when he
[1:05:34] was a young man he might have been
[1:05:35] tempted to cheat on his
[1:05:37] test boy got
[1:05:39] quiet you don't believe Jesus was
[1:05:42] tempted absolutely was he might have
[1:05:46] been tempted to steal
[1:05:49] candy and lie to his mother are you with
[1:05:53] me now now he never did it right yeah
[1:05:56] cuz he never
[1:05:58] sinned but he was
[1:06:00] tempted the devil tempted him are you
[1:06:03] with me now he was tempted at all points
[1:06:06] as we are yet without sin he was tempted
[1:06:09] by drinking yeah huh that's right he was
[1:06:14] tempted by
[1:06:16] women I know that's hard for us to
[1:06:18] believe but it's true it's not a sin to
[1:06:20] be tempted it's what you do with that he
[1:06:23] was tempted by everything he could be
[1:06:25] tempted by he was tempted by everything
[1:06:28] someone say everything that we are he
[1:06:31] was a man yet you couldn't put a mark on
[1:06:34] him and so brother random goes on and
[1:06:36] this is a famous quote but I think
[1:06:38] sometimes we don't read the context but
[1:06:40] this is how you recognize the devil he
[1:06:41] said overcome means to recognize the
[1:06:44] devil in every one of his tricks oh my a
[1:06:48] lot of people says there is no devil
[1:06:49] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:06:51] that there's a real devil he just as
[1:06:52] real as you are anybody a real devil you
[1:06:55] must recognize him real you must know
[1:06:56] he's a devil then the same time that you
[1:06:59] recognize him and know that he's a devil
[1:07:01] and he's against you and to overcome you
[1:07:03] must recognize that the god in you is
[1:07:06] greater and mightier how many believe
[1:07:07] that tonight he's greater and mightier
[1:07:10] than he is that the one that's in you
[1:07:12] has already overcome him he was tempted
[1:07:14] like you are he already overcome
[1:07:16] Temptation he already overcome lust he
[1:07:18] already overcome the Temptation for
[1:07:20] money he already overcome every
[1:07:22] Temptation that you face right
[1:07:26] yes and by his grace you are more
[1:07:29] someone say more you're more than a
[1:07:31] match for him there's real overcoming
[1:07:34] when you re oh God help me to recognize
[1:07:37] that I am more than a match for him when
[1:07:39] I come under the word under the word of
[1:07:45] humility There's real overcoming when
[1:07:47] you recognize you look back and say I'm
[1:07:48] doing this and I'm doing that now watch
[1:07:51] you can't look at it like this number
[1:07:53] one you're under condemnation cuz you're
[1:07:55] you're living like that but then you
[1:07:57] can't dwell on it once you've
[1:07:59] repented he said you look back and say
[1:08:02] I'm doing this and I'm doing that no
[1:08:03] you're defeated all right but there's no
[1:08:07] condemnation oh Hallelujah right aren't
[1:08:09] you glad for the blood tonight there's
[1:08:12] no condemnation to them which you're in
[1:08:13] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[1:08:15] flesh but after the spirit then you
[1:08:17] realize you've overcome yes that builds
[1:08:20] strength for the next
[1:08:23] battle don't dwell on it don't spend the
[1:08:26] rest of your life thinking about it
[1:08:28] flee
[1:08:30] run
[1:08:32] overcome you see Paul understood who he
[1:08:35] was without Christ in Romans 7:24 oh
[1:08:38] Wretched Man that I am who should
[1:08:41] deliver me from the body of this death
[1:08:43] he's talking about his own
[1:08:44] flesh verse 25 I thank God through Jesus
[1:08:48] Christ Our Lord so it's not a hopeless
[1:08:49] case it's not that you say well I've
[1:08:51] just got something in me that makes me
[1:08:53] want to steal or makes me want to uh
[1:08:55] smoke or makes me want to drink that's
[1:08:57] not what it is at all you're not a
[1:08:59] hopeless case this all of our flesh is
[1:09:01] that way all of our flesh is subject to
[1:09:03] temptation all of our flesh is able to
[1:09:06] be overcome by the enemy but I'm glad
[1:09:08] that I'm not depending on the flesh but
[1:09:10] I'm depending on the life of the spirit
[1:09:12] inside of me Oh my he said I thank God
[1:09:16] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then
[1:09:18] with the mind I serve the law of God but
[1:09:20] I understand that my flesh still serves
[1:09:22] the law of sin yeah
[1:09:25] you understand that's why a person can
[1:09:27] do things and never be the
[1:09:32] same but they could be as forgiven as
[1:09:36] everything right forgiven as anybody
[1:09:38] else but the flesh serves the law of sin
[1:09:42] but the soul is
[1:09:45] pure I'm so glad when we tie knots it
[1:09:48] can't be untied that there still could
[1:09:50] be a clear line between us and God and
[1:09:52] we're as saved as anybody else is
[1:09:55] right so on a positive side I'm glad of
[1:09:57] that but I would warn you don't don't do
[1:09:59] that because what happens is the flesh
[1:10:01] still serves the law of sin you always
[1:10:02] have that
[1:10:06] memory look he said that I know my flesh
[1:10:08] is still a sinner yeah right he said
[1:10:11] I've got to do something about it so
[1:10:13] what do he say I keep under my body
[1:10:16] bring it into subjection let by any
[1:10:18] means when I preach to others I myself
[1:10:21] should be a cast away oh if Paul had
[1:10:23] that kind of humility let me have that
[1:10:24] kind of humility
[1:10:30] Paul had the Holy Ghost how many believe
[1:10:33] that I've heard people say well if you
[1:10:35] have the Holy Ghost you'll you'll you
[1:10:37] just automatically never give in to
[1:10:39] Temptation
[1:10:40] okay that's not
[1:10:43] overcoming you say how how do you know
[1:10:45] that well brother brandham had the Holy
[1:10:47] Ghost in fact he said it this way I you
[1:10:50] all already looking at it he said I've
[1:10:52] had the Holy Ghost for years I think he
[1:10:54] was right about that I'll take his word
[1:10:57] for it he said you can't look at a woman
[1:10:59] her half-dressed
[1:11:01] he said I carry a little cross in my car
[1:11:03] many of you seen it somebody said to me
[1:11:05] are you a Catholic where do the
[1:11:06] Catholics ever get an option on the
[1:11:07] cross the cross means Christian he said
[1:11:11] the other day Friday wife and I was
[1:11:12] going to the store I don't mean to harp
[1:11:13] on this as we went down the street I
[1:11:14] just kept turning my head one way or the
[1:11:16] other for naked women he said I promis
[1:11:18] God one way for the other he said naked
[1:11:21] women so he'd see one he'd have to turn
[1:11:22] his head he said I promised God I was a
[1:11:25] blind man if he'd heal my eyes I'd look
[1:11:27] at the thing that was right I keep a
[1:11:29] little cross hanging in my car when I
[1:11:31] see such a that I look at the cross and
[1:11:33] I say oh God that's my refuge I'm not
[1:11:36] looking at my own self I'm looking at
[1:11:37] the cross that's my
[1:11:40] refuge now we know that when Joseph did
[1:11:43] the right thing as we're moving along
[1:11:46] now it didn't go well for
[1:11:49] him You' have thought he'd been
[1:11:52] rewarded for for overcoming
[1:11:55] but he immediately gets thrown back in
[1:11:58] the pit back into prison yeah have his
[1:12:01] Liberty taken away after he's gained all
[1:12:04] that he's gained during this time it's
[1:12:06] all stripped away from him and he finds
[1:12:09] himself in prison falsely accused of
[1:12:12] assaulting a woman that was assaulting
[1:12:15] him and he ended up in prison oh my I'll
[1:12:19] say this he was falsely accused he was a
[1:12:21] type of Christ how many times are we
[1:12:23] falsely accused maybe once in a while
[1:12:26] mostly we did
[1:12:29] it come on
[1:12:33] church mostly we did it but I'm so glad
[1:12:36] for the grace of God that that's not the
[1:12:38] end of the story right that's not the
[1:12:41] end come on church that's not the end I
[1:12:43] don't believe in legalism without hope I
[1:12:45] believe in Holiness but I don't believe
[1:12:47] in legalism without hope I believe
[1:12:49] there's hope for the vest sinner in the
[1:12:51] blood of Jesus Christ as brother brand
[1:12:53] told the story of the woman who who had
[1:12:56] so dirty that they wouldn't even touch
[1:12:58] her and they they rode her out on a rail
[1:13:00] and tarred and feathered her and and and
[1:13:02] she had done so many unspeakable acts
[1:13:04] the woman in Oklahoma and he said told
[1:13:06] the story he said a preacher stood up
[1:13:08] among all the religions of the world he
[1:13:09] said which of your religions can clean
[1:13:11] the hands of Lady mcabe and they all sat
[1:13:15] there and he said he said he jumped up
[1:13:17] and clicked his heels and he said my the
[1:13:19] he said My Religion my gospel he said
[1:13:22] will not only clean her hands it'll
[1:13:23] clean her heart and make her so she
[1:13:25] never did it in the first
[1:13:27] place oh I believe in a god like
[1:13:31] that here you find the almost perfect
[1:13:34] type of Christ was sitting in a
[1:13:36] prison falsely accused Jesus was
[1:13:40] too but there was prosperity in the
[1:13:44] prison it says Joseph's Master took him
[1:13:46] and put him into the prison a place
[1:13:47] where the king's prisoners were bound
[1:13:49] and he was there in the prison but the
[1:13:51] Lord was with Joseph and showed him
[1:13:55] Mercy aren't you glad he showed you
[1:13:57] mercy and gave him favor in the sight of
[1:14:00] The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper
[1:14:02] of the prison committed to Joseph's hand
[1:14:04] all the prisoners that were in the
[1:14:06] prison and whatsoever they did there he
[1:14:08] was the doer of it you realize what it
[1:14:11] is no matter where Joseph is he's in
[1:14:13] charge no matter listen Church you're
[1:14:15] not a victim of your circumstances
[1:14:17] you're not a victim of the economy
[1:14:19] you're not a victim of what people say
[1:14:21] about you you're not a your your type is
[1:14:23] Christ it's Joseph no matter where he
[1:14:26] went he was an overcomer he went to hell
[1:14:28] and overcame hell he went to the Grave
[1:14:31] overcame the grave listen if brother
[1:14:33] brother Bill if one of these days you
[1:14:35] pass on remember you're an overcomer
[1:14:37] you'll come up before we
[1:14:39] do oh church we are not bound you say
[1:14:42] well I'm getting old and I can't do
[1:14:44] nothing no more but there's coming a
[1:14:45] resurrection Satan can't put you in a
[1:14:48] place you can't get out of he can't
[1:14:50] block up the river he can't bring he
[1:14:52] can't shut you down come on now
[1:14:56] oh hope we can understand that today I'm
[1:14:58] a testimony that I wonder how many other
[1:15:00] testimonies we got here tonight Satan
[1:15:02] can't keep me down I belong to God I'm a
[1:15:05] son of prosperity
[1:15:07] sir good
[1:15:12] yes the Bible says The Keeper of the
[1:15:15] prison looked not to anything that was
[1:15:17] under his hand look how similar the
[1:15:18] story is Joseph lied on put in prison he
[1:15:21] ends up in the same spot he was
[1:15:26] that that and because the Lord was with
[1:15:28] him that which he did the
[1:15:29] Lord made it to prosper different jobs
[1:15:32] same
[1:15:33] story different circumstances same
[1:15:37] story are you with me
[1:15:40] now Joseph was a son of prosperity a
[1:15:43] type of Jesus Christ brother brand said
[1:15:45] remember he was a son of prosperity he
[1:15:47] said everything he did prospered whether
[1:15:49] it was prison wherever it was to come
[1:15:50] out right and hasn't he promised for his
[1:15:53] children that he'd make everything work
[1:15:56] together for the good he said whether it
[1:15:58] was sickness prison house death Sorrows
[1:16:00] whatever it was it would work for the
[1:16:02] good to them that loved him he promised
[1:16:05] it it must be so it's got to be there he
[1:16:07] said it's figurative spoke to us in him
[1:16:10] oh there's a great Revelation there when
[1:16:12] he when he overcame he was speaking to
[1:16:15] us you can overcome Oh my he said I'm I
[1:16:19] live so that you could live also
[1:16:22] overcome death Hell In The Grave he said
[1:16:24] he had to KY Keys why did he have the
[1:16:25] keys so we could unlock it for
[1:16:29] us it spoke to us in him he was the
[1:16:32] perfect image of God I'm going to go
[1:16:34] back to Psalm 1 we've dealt with that a
[1:16:36] little bit but I want to go back
[1:16:37] there look at a little
[1:16:40] differently he said blessed is the man
[1:16:42] that walketh not in the counsil of the
[1:16:44] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:16:46] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:16:47] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:16:50] of the Lord in his law do he meditate
[1:16:53] day and night he loves the word
[1:16:55] oh that God would put a love for the
[1:16:57] word back in our hearts again oh that we
[1:16:59] could we could recogn as message people
[1:17:01] we ought to love the word like nobody
[1:17:02] else
[1:17:04] yes his Delight is in the law of the
[1:17:07] Lord in his La do he meditate day and
[1:17:08] night and he shall be like a tree
[1:17:11] planted by the rivers of water remember
[1:17:13] we talked about being planted
[1:17:15] predestinated to be there planted by the
[1:17:18] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:17:20] fruit and his season his Leaf also shall
[1:17:23] not wither and whatsoever ever he doeth
[1:17:26] shall
[1:17:28] prosper Hallelujah whatsoever he doeth
[1:17:31] he so he's not limiting it to Joseph
[1:17:33] he's saying every one of you have the
[1:17:35] ability to prosper whatever you do come
[1:17:38] on church it's a Wednesday night I know
[1:17:40] but whatever you do he said I've given
[1:17:41] you the ability to prosper in
[1:17:45] it he said Joseph he said think of that
[1:17:49] Perfect Tree David looked back and saw
[1:17:51] it he said a standing by the rivers of
[1:17:53] water he bringeth forth his leaves in
[1:17:55] his season in his fruit it shall not be
[1:17:56] cast it won't wither whatsoever he doth
[1:17:59] shall prosper he was the son of
[1:18:00] prosperity Joseph was a type of him he
[1:18:03] was the antitype of Joseph everywhere
[1:18:05] Joseph went it prospered same thing with
[1:18:08] Jesus his word watch where he takes it
[1:18:11] what prospers the word remember what he
[1:18:14] we read about Joseph he said until his
[1:18:16] the day his word came the word of God
[1:18:18] tried him right the word of God tried
[1:18:21] him but his word was what was prosperous
[1:18:25] right hallelujah what was prosperous in
[1:18:27] his life was the vision what was
[1:18:29] prosperous in his life was the word what
[1:18:31] is prosperous in your life you may not
[1:18:33] you may not have a lot of money but what
[1:18:35] prospers in your life you're going to
[1:18:37] make it to that place why because he
[1:18:40] planted you Hallelujah by the rivers of
[1:18:42] water he placed his word in you he said
[1:18:45] you're not going to fail you're going to
[1:18:46] make it yes
[1:18:48] sir
[1:18:52] right Hallelujah he said same thing with
[1:18:55] Jesus his my word will prosper and it
[1:18:57] won't return to me void it'll accomplish
[1:19:01] that which I purposed it for he said he
[1:19:03] was the word the word was sent to the
[1:19:05] Earth by God and it will
[1:19:08] accomplish exactly someone say exactly
[1:19:13] what God sent it
[1:19:15] for Hallelujah listen to this there's a
[1:19:18] there's a tie between prosperity and the
[1:19:20] word and I want to kind of enter into
[1:19:21] that because maybe Sunday morning we'll
[1:19:23] talk about the value of the word and the
[1:19:25] things that we've been given and and and
[1:19:28] the word that we have the word itself
[1:19:30] what that is because he says you keep
[1:19:33] therefore the words of this Covenant and
[1:19:35] do them that you may prosper in all that
[1:19:37] you do there's a tie between the word
[1:19:40] and prosperity listen to me young people
[1:19:43] if you'll stay with the word if you'll
[1:19:45] just see say well I won't do that
[1:19:46] because the word says not to and I won't
[1:19:48] do that and really what it comes down to
[1:19:51] you got to have a love for the word it
[1:19:52] won't be just a Dos or a don'ts it won't
[1:19:54] be just a law but there's something
[1:19:56] inside of you that loves the word and
[1:19:58] you say I love him I don't want to do
[1:20:00] anything that would hurt him I don't
[1:20:02] want to do anything that would be
[1:20:03] against the word so the word is the son
[1:20:06] of prosperity can we say that the word
[1:20:08] is what is prosperous the word is the
[1:20:11] son of prosperity Isaiah 556 seek you
[1:20:13] the Lord while he may be found call you
[1:20:15] upon him while he's near let the wicked
[1:20:17] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[1:20:20] his thoughts let him return to listen to
[1:20:23] me church we times we forsake the ways
[1:20:25] but not the thoughts and the thoughts
[1:20:27] will lead you back to the wrong way
[1:20:30] wrong thoughts lead the wrong ways I
[1:20:32] don't know who that's for tonight but it
[1:20:34] just occurred to my mind and I think the
[1:20:37] Lord maybe wants us to know that wrong
[1:20:39] thoughts lead to wrong ways but forsake
[1:20:41] your thoughts and let him return unto
[1:20:44] the Lord and He will have mercy upon him
[1:20:46] and to our God he will abundantly pardon
[1:20:49] yes sir for as the heavens are higher
[1:20:51] than the earth so are my ways higher
[1:20:52] than your ways my thoughts than your
[1:20:54] thoughts
[1:20:55] oh for as the rain cometh down the snow
[1:20:57] from Heaven returneth not thither but
[1:20:59] WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth
[1:21:00] in mood that it may give seed to the SE
[1:21:02] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[1:21:05] be that sh that goeth forth out of my
[1:21:07] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:21:10] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:21:12] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:21:14] were unto us oh do we believe that
[1:21:16] tonight church if he said there's going
[1:21:18] to be a Rapture that that Rapture that
[1:21:20] word is a prosperous word if he said oh
[1:21:23] church if he said we could have in that
[1:21:25] word is a word of prosperity if he said
[1:21:28] we could rejoice in the presence of God
[1:21:30] that word is a Hallelujah is a word of
[1:21:33] prosperity glory to
[1:21:38] God verse 12 for you shall go out with
[1:21:41] joy Hallelujah it'll Prosper why how you
[1:21:44] know it prospers you'll have joy in your
[1:21:46] life why the word said you can have joy
[1:21:50] and be led forth with peace you have
[1:21:52] peace the word says you can have peace
[1:21:54] the mountains and the hills shall Break
[1:21:56] Forth before you into seeing all the
[1:21:57] trees of the field shall clap their
[1:21:59] hands instead of the Thorns should come
[1:22:00] up the fur tree instead of the Briar
[1:22:02] shall come up the Myrtle tree and it
[1:22:04] shall be to the Lord for a name for an
[1:22:06] everlasting sign that shall be not not
[1:22:09] be cut
[1:22:10] off his word finds a way all right like
[1:22:15] a river seeking its bed it finds a
[1:22:20] way
[1:22:22] Hallelujah see why does my life look so
[1:22:24] crooked sometimes it just the word
[1:22:26] finding a
[1:22:30] way why did I have to come up the way
[1:22:32] that I did the word found a
[1:22:35] way
[1:22:38] Hallelujah we don't always know what
[1:22:39] Prosperity is sometimes Prosperity looks
[1:22:41] like a
[1:22:44] prison sometimes it looks like a
[1:22:48] cross Jesus died on the cross the son of
[1:22:52] prosperity had had Nails put his
[1:22:55] hands a crown of thorns on his
[1:23:00] head he did that for
[1:23:02] me Church does that get old to you I
[1:23:04] hope
[1:23:07] not he did it for
[1:23:09] me he did it for you young people he did
[1:23:12] it for you hope they don't get old hope
[1:23:14] it can still touch your heart the son of
[1:23:17] prosperity was nailed to a cross for
[1:23:20] me Jesus died on the cross when he died
[1:23:23] he was raised to the right hand of his
[1:23:24] father father just like Joseph his
[1:23:26] Earthly estate I'll think about this for
[1:23:28] a minute he didn't look very prosperous
[1:23:30] his entire Earthly estate was one
[1:23:35] robe if they had done a an accounting as
[1:23:38] we used to have to do that in the title
[1:23:39] business an accounting of an estate and
[1:23:41] figure out what all somebody owned and
[1:23:43] see what piece of land went to who when
[1:23:46] you begin to look at his accounting of
[1:23:47] his estate he had one robe
[1:23:51] right oh church one robe that he had
[1:23:54] that was Earthly what did they do with
[1:23:56] it they took it and gambled on it and
[1:23:59] split it in
[1:24:02] two and and and now he was the son of
[1:24:06] prosperity
[1:24:08] dying and saying Lord my God my God why
[1:24:11] hast Thou
[1:24:13] forsaken
[1:24:17] me the Rich Young
[1:24:20] Ruler he might have been there I don't
[1:24:22] know we know we know sometime after he
[1:24:26] met Christ we don't know when but it's
[1:24:29] spoken of Jesus spoke of it so I guess
[1:24:31] maybe before Jesus died the Rich Young
[1:24:34] Ruler
[1:24:35] died we don't know the way that it
[1:24:37] speaks of it perhaps it was by
[1:24:40] Vision but he TP he he puts the stories
[1:24:43] brother brandom always puts the Rich
[1:24:45] Young Ruler with the one who was with
[1:24:47] the rich man that in Lazarus those were
[1:24:50] the same
[1:24:51] man right so the Rich Young Ruler
[1:24:55] was still a rich ruler but he became old
[1:24:57] he he become about retirement age he
[1:24:59] said Soul take thy rest got tired of
[1:25:02] building bigger barns put all his
[1:25:03] antique cars in he
[1:25:05] said Soul take thy rest and when he was
[1:25:10] done right aren't you glad you're saved
[1:25:13] by
[1:25:15] grace he chose the wrong thing he died
[1:25:18] in prosperity his estate they probably
[1:25:21] had a long list of things that he left
[1:25:24] to his children and everybody gathered
[1:25:26] around had a big funeral and said it was
[1:25:28] a wonderful thing and Jesus died like a
[1:25:33] sinner but after three days Jesus rose
[1:25:36] and and when he ascended he went to his
[1:25:39] father and was at his father's right
[1:25:41] hand and the the rich man found himself
[1:25:45] in
[1:25:46] Hell longing for a drink of
[1:25:49] water oh church he lifted up his eyes
[1:25:53] and hell I said let me choose the
[1:25:55] prosperity of the word not the
[1:25:58] prosperity of Life yeah not the
[1:26:01] prosperity of riches but the prosperity
[1:26:03] of the
[1:26:04] word now if you think about water and
[1:26:06] I'm going to close in just a moment I've
[1:26:08] got 12 minutes left and I'm done I'll
[1:26:10] just
[1:26:11] quit I know you don't believe me but I
[1:26:15] will but in a in a desert climate
[1:26:18] proximity to the water leads to
[1:26:21] Prosperity wars were fought over well
[1:26:26] right they they fought you find that in
[1:26:27] the Old Testament many times and we find
[1:26:30] one time there was a woman who came to a
[1:26:33] well looking for a more prosperous life
[1:26:37] looking for a little bit of prosperity a
[1:26:39] little bit of water to get her through
[1:26:40] her day yeah and Jesus told her said if
[1:26:43] you knew the gift of God and who it is
[1:26:46] that said to the give me the drink you
[1:26:47] would have ask of him and he would have
[1:26:49] given the Living Water he said if you
[1:26:52] knew other words like this brother B
[1:26:54] said if if you knew how close you was to
[1:26:56] the Fountain of Life I'd give you water
[1:26:58] that you wouldn't come here to draw I'll
[1:27:00] transplant
[1:27:02] you now Jesus had a need to go by Samar
[1:27:05] Samaria because he wanted to do some
[1:27:07] gardening now remember we were planted
[1:27:09] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:27:11] world right in his thoughts where were
[1:27:15] we planted in the house of God serving
[1:27:19] God right but the devil in our flesh we
[1:27:22] were planted in a different
[1:27:24] place we're planted in the world under
[1:27:27] sin under
[1:27:28] judgment right but our real planting was
[1:27:31] in the word the inside man but the flesh
[1:27:34] was planted in the world are you with me
[1:27:37] now so Jesus brother brandom said Jesus
[1:27:40] went by her way to say this I'll
[1:27:44] transplant you yeah Hallelujah well what
[1:27:48] a great thought he come by your way
[1:27:51] Brother David and he said you were
[1:27:53] planted in my mind so I know you don't
[1:27:55] belong here he comes by Samaria and sees
[1:27:57] a woman who did not belong where she was
[1:28:00] she did not belong with all the husband
[1:28:02] she did not belong in getting water from
[1:28:05] that physical well he said I'll
[1:28:07] transplant you I'll bring you you sinner

[1:28:11] doesn't believe in it if you'll only let
[1:28:13] me pluck you up this morning he said
[1:28:15] I'll plant you by the rivers of water
[1:28:17] I'll put you in a position by the
[1:28:19] baptism of the holy spirit that you'll
