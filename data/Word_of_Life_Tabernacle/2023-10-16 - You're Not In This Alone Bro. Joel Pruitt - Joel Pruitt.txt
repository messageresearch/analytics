special blessing to us Lord move me out of the way so that I could speak to the people and and Lord that you could speak to the people Words of Life Lord Jesus you know every moment and time and how it's going to happen and exactly what's going to take place so Lord I pray this would be a special moment for your people here tonight Lord God we love you we appreciate you what you've done here among us and we ask Lord that as the word would go forth tonight that you would just open our hearts Lord bind me from anything I would say that would be un unlike you or not pleasing to you Lord I pray you be with each one of us now we ask in Jesus name amen can you say praise the Lord tonight amen sure good to be in the house of the Lord and sure enjoyed the meetings we were able to attend some of us were able to attend over the weekend and how many enjoyed that that went and it was real good and and the service this morning that was just wonderful the word of the Lord amen we're we're a blessed people Amen to have what we have in this day also I'm thankful that my wife will let me stand here today being our anniversary and uh not make me take her on some expensive vacation or something she's seen the bank account she knows that ain't gonna happen so anyway we'll we'll get right into the word if you've got your Bibles let's turn to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 15 we'll just read one verse and then you can be seated if I could title this at all tonight I I I I would title it you're not in this alone thank and uh I I think we all keep that in mind that whatever you're doing wherever you're going the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you're not in this alone he knows every bat or every every Gat that bats its eye and uh Allan I can't talk either buddy this could be good he knows every every hair on your head is numbered oh yeah some's easier than others but every hair that you ever had is numbered can you say Amen tonight well I tell you help me preach and we'll get out of here quickly my timer has already started we have a baptism this afternoon and uh we're sure thankful for the young people I I I was blessed last week I got done preaching and I I was feeling the blues and I was sitting there at the house and I got this letter sent to me and uh I ain't going to lie I started crying a little bit and uh little young lady asked me to baptize her so we're going to do that right after the service tonight and we love the Lord Lord don't we and we're servants to the people that's all we were that's all we are and if we can get ourselves out of the way we can we can hopefully help the people in some way so you're not in this alone but 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and he said hearken ye all of Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem thou and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude don't be scared of the crowds that are against you for the battle is not yours but it's God's and you may be seated tonight may the Lord add His blessings to the word and I was thinking about different people in the Bible and what they went through and you know you feel alone sometimes we just feel alone sometimes you feel like you're everything you're doing you're just by yourself you know uh sometimes you feel like you're the only person that's worshiping sometimes you feel like you're the only one saying amen sometimes you sometimes you just feel alone in life you don't feel like you got friends anymore you ever been there sometimes you just feel like everybody's against you but do you know you've always got somebody who's walking with you he's always in your corner and he's the greatest champion I know he's never lost a battle he's never left you alone in battle and he never will why because he said I will never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you and even in you I tell you what he's so close that brother brandom said he's closer than your right arm he's always near and he's always there and I thank the Lord that we don't have to look to a god that's that's a far off or or in another in another world but he's right here with us he's right here and Among Us you say I need God in my service he's right here today I believe God is here to do the impossible here in the service tonight all we have to do is say Lord I need you to help me and he's right there ready to help Lord I just need to get myself out of the way so I can see you and I heard over the weekend a brother talking about the angels that would encamp around those that would believe him and he said you can't see them but they're all around you all you have to do is call on them and they're there to help you I believe that's what we need to do tonight let the fear just fall away and let the let the doubts just fall out of the way and let's take God at his word and be a mighty Army in this day that can rise up and say I'm not in this alone you're not in this alone you're not by yourself I don't care how you feel about it you're not in this alone brother B talks about a Lily and I got to thinking about a lily you know when it's down there in the mud no doubt that Lily thinks it's all by itself it's never going to become nothing right it's just under the mud and and it it's never seen the daylight yet it don't even know what it looks like it don't even know why it's growing like it is but there's something inside of that seed that will soon become a beautiful Lily and there's something on the inside of it that's making it beautiful that's the way Christians are a lot of times we don't feel like we're ever going to become anything but there's something on the inside that says keep pressing the battle don't give up now there's there's too much ahead of you to stop now and so so the Lily just keeps going he said he said it gets to itself when it gets to the light he said when it gets to the light it blooms out and it's the most beautiful flower there is anywhere that's what a lily is I say that's what a Christian is when you finally get to the light when you finally see what God has done for you when you finally can lay down your doubt just long enough say you know what I can see that God is walking with me I can look back on the trials of my life and say he was there all the time oh come on somebody he was always there you say I've been in some pretty bad places I don't care how far you've been I don't care how low down you've been God was there the whole time think about Daniel he was in a lion's den and there was no hope of a man coming out of that Lion's Den with some hungry Lions down there but there was somebody else in the den with him think about the Hebrew children there was three of them cast into the fire but let me tell you something there was a fourth man there to deliver them out of the fire and did you know every situation you ever put in God is always there to deliver you brother bam talks about the word he said the word will always deliver his people always the word will deliver his people always and Christ is the word in this day so if you can just get Christ on the inside of your church if you could just accept the person of Jesus Christ that he's come and he sent his Spirit to the church today so that he could lead you he could guide you he said he was a comforter to you oh I hope you're hearing me tonight you say these are just words but it's a reality to the believer brother B goes on down he said he said he said that Lily he said it comes from the dirt of the Earth from the filth that's where the jewels are found wrapped up out there in this gold state of the nation where you find gold down in the dirt where do you find rubies and jewels down in the dirt he said that's where we all come from but and the world here he said he said it sees here he said I'm a prospector what does a prospector do he hunts for gold and when he does he shines it and he beats it and he smelts it he gets it ready that's what US preachers are trying to do today we're not trying to just make some big name or or or I know who I know this is so and so and and he's my best friend and and I know this preacher I've been to his church it don't matter I tell you what we're trying to do is trying to find some gold that we can beat try to polish up and not to beat the people but we can bring it into the house of God and let the Holy Spirit go to work on it not something I can do brother Stuart can't do it brother Ben can't do it your pastor can't do it but God can change the hearts of the young people he can change the heart of the old people he can make a hardened heart soft again because God can still do the impossible I don't care it's the hardest person you've ever seen a person that looks like they've gone too far God can still change that person and bring them back God can still make something out of nothing at all he said uh it goes on down here I got to skip a lot of this y'all cuz I'm long- winded and and I got to I got to get out of here in time to have a baptism so I'm I'm working on it he said 'oh there it was he said he's talking about the three whober children here and he said uh there it was he said it was a fiery furnace he said and under the trial under a test they held true to the end he said but God was there just in a spare of a moment oh yeah you believe that he's been there in a spare of a moment for you when you should have died when you should have went too far but you could only go so far because God was there to bring you back he said there he was he said there's the furnace he said but he said he delivered him he said he knew that they were prayed up their sins were confessed he know they had met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent he's only silent to test you I said he's only silent to test you are you going to call out on the name of God or are you going to say well this trial got me no sir a Believer rest in the promises of God a Believer will grab hold of that promise and say you know what I can't be defeated because I'm in God's Army and the general Captain the Great Captain has never lost a battle he's leading me he's guiding me he'll always be with me don't ever think you're alone you're not alone Daniel and I I I I was talking about Daniel there brother BR says Daniel was tested for the worship of one true God he was tested for that and you will be too come on somebody every son that cometh to God must first be tested and tried you've got to be tested he said but in the face of difficulties he stood the test he said and what did God do after it looked like the chips were down for him as they say he said he didn't know what to do they was going to feed him to the Lions he said but Daniel stayed true to the test that there is one true God and he possessed the Gate of his enemy and God had closed the mouth of the Lions I think that's what we need to do tonight quit giving into the devil and possess your Gates possess your promises of God tonight because God is not trying to kill you but the devil is when that doubt comes in and says well I'm not good enough that's not God telling you that that's the devil trying to tell you I'm not good enough I can't never preach the gospel because you know what I I've got a past I tell you what every one of you's got a past but God knows the future and God is more than able to raise of these Stones children of Abraham he's more than able to do whatever he wants because he's God it's man that limits God but God is Unlimited in his power God is Unlimited in his mercy God is Unlimited in his restoring process he's Unlimited in what he wants to do he can do whatever he wants why because he's God and if you ever get the Revelation that he's with you and he's in you then you know I'm not alone in this journey I don't care how dark the nights get I don't care how hard the days get God has never left one of his children you can look through the Bible and every time a test would come when Jonah got in the whales py when it got so bad come on somebody you say we've heard all this before well I wish you to remind yourself once in a while because sometimes we get so defeated we act like we can't do nothing about it sometimes we get those so defeated we just go around and we have the wowy wowy blues they say and you get so bad and so defeated you can't raise your hand in church no more you can't shout in church no more why because you're living in a a defeated state but if you'll ever give the trials to Jesus then you can shout a little bit and say you know what there's no condemnation holding me back no more there's no trials holding me down the chains have been broken the locks have been on unlocked tonight why because God is still in the business of setting people free don't let that denominational Spirit hold you back and say you can't Worship in church no more that's the devil trying to get after you God inhabits the Praises of his people so we need to praise him when we come to the house of God I said we need to praise him when we come to the house of God God doesn't want you to sit here and not praise him did you know he wouldn't be God Without You praising him you were created so that he could have somebody to worship him God Made You for him he's not going to leave you now he wanted you to come on somebody he wanted you to worship him so bad that he made a human being that he knew would fall and he would have to give his own son's life for but he made you so that he could be worshiped so why can't we worship him tonight why can't we give him everything we got why because he set me free from bondage he set me free from Spirits that I thought was going to take me out he set me free so why can't I be free enough to say thank you Jesus why can't I be free enough to raise my hands when the Holy Spirit tells me to why why why are we held back because of false teaching in the pulpits the devil coming in saying you can't shout no more binding the people Satan has come to bind the people but God come to loose you that's what we get when you start taking a man's complex as Doctrine when you start taking a man's idea as Doctrine I say go back to the word of God I say go back to the word of God and let the word of God change the way you worship well that was free it wasn't in my notes but I think too often we we we get kind of in this way of thinking that you know somebody's going to criticize me for the way I worship they're going to criticize you no matter what worship God they're going to criticize you for being too quiet or too loud worship God they're going to criticize you for the way your music sounds I said worship God on the instruments I say worship god with your hands I said worship god with your voice why because you're not in this alone let's give him some praise for that God didn't call us just to be another church if I wanted to go to a dead Church I'd go to a Baptist Church but it's a Living Word making the people a living prde amen see we're married to the groom the bride and the groom are one you're never alone you two have become one oh yeah we have become one we are him oh I hope you see that tonight we are him so how could you ever be alone when you are a very part of God you are a part of the body of God doesn't matter what people try to tell you I'll tell you another one Joshua brother said a great leader and only two of them that went to the promised land he said Joshua and Caleb they come to a place called Kadesh which was the center of the world at that time and he said it was a judgment seat and he said they sent out 12 Spies to look at the land and 12 of them come back 10 of them said oh it's too much of a job we just couldn't do it it wasn't people we look like grasshoppers beside of them there was Giants in the land don't you know there's some Giants in the land today we call them intellectual Giants we call them giants that are trying to bind the people well come on somebody I know some people don't like shouting in church and people responding in church well get over it because you're not worshiping me you're not worshiping brother Ben you're worshiping God and who's to say worshiping God is wrong on 10 of them said it's too much what did Joshua do he stealed the people and said wait a minute I heard this said one time that Joshua stealed the people and that meant he had him be quiet and church oh he stealed the people because they were saying we can't do it we can't do it no he was trying to tell them no you're not in this alone greater is he that is in you than the Giants on the other side he said wait a minute I like this we are more than able no matter how little I he said or how much in the minority come on somebody we may not be the biggest group in the world but we've got power behind us we've got authority to walk all over the devil in this day he said he said I don't care how much it was he said he he said what was he doing he was standing true to that promise he said I give you this land but you've got to fight for every inch of it and you're going to have to fight the Devils of intellect today that tell you that we just need a teaching meeting and we don't need the move of the spirit no more I said we got to fight that devil because every possession every promise is yours if you need a blessing in the house of God I say go into the house of God and get a blessing because Jesus is with you and where he is there's a lot of noise I know people like it quiet sometimes that's good you know hey i' I've been in Services where the quietness of the Holy Spirit comes in and it blesses me more than the shouting I'm not against that but I think sometimes when you start getting tired on a Sunday afternoon and you start feeling a little bit blue and you start feeling like you just can't take your land I think it's time that you shout and give God praise because in the valley it's time to give him some Praise In The Valley he restores my soul when it looks like I shouldn't be here he's restored me anyway because God did the restoring it wasn't a man that did it but God said you know what that's one of mine down there that's Danel Daniel down there that's my servant I'm not going to leave him down there to be Lion's food no I'm going to bring him out of that why because I want to show my Mercy to him I want to show my goodness to him he wants to do the same for you but you know what he'll stand there and he'll let you go so far and he'll let you do things that you're like you know what I'm I'm just going to go out in the world I'm going to backslide but did you know if God has ever gotten a hold of you then he'll let you go so far and then all of a sudden you feel that tug on your heart I just can't go no farther he was there all the time or you could have went as far as you wanted to that's right that's right he never left you alone I want you to know tonight church when you leave here and you have to face work on Monday morning you're not facing it alone when you leave here and you have to face Devils that are going to try to come against you and the stand you've taken for the message of the hour you're not in this alone I said we're not fighting this battle by ourselves because the battle is not yours but it's God's battle when a lustful Spirit would try to come against you and try to take you young people out you're not in this alone you can't fight this battle on your own well come on somebody I said you can't fight this battle on your own but Jesus is with me when the storm clouds gather I I like the song he said he's standing by your side I love it why because he said I'll never leave you did you know that's a promise to you when I see these young people getting baptized I think we've got four or five to do over the next couple weeks when these young people are getting baptized did you know when they get the holy spirit in their heart they're no longer in this alone because the comforter is going to come and he's going to lead him and guide him do they still need child training yes sir do they still need to be taught things yes do they still need teaching yes but they're not in this alone and when they get old they won't depart from it oh they might try to stray but they're going to come back because something was placed in their hearts at a young age and they can't get away from it you believe that tonight we've got to possess the Gate of our enemy and the word I think I said this but the word delivers the people I read that quote last night I didn't I didn't keep it but but there's a word here today that is a message of Deliverance come on somebody it's a message of Deliverance our young people would have no hope without a message of Deliverance I would have no hope without a message of Deliverance you would be hopeless but the message has come to deliver you from the way you were to the way you are now well I'm just going to preach to you for a minute it looked like it was hopeless for the three he Hebrew children but it wasn't hopeless because Jesus came along you know when Jesus comes Everything Changes you know when the disciples got in the boat and they went to the other side they got out there and the storms got bad and the waves got high but can I tell you something somebody was in the boat with them when the storms of life look like you can't take no more I said Jesus is with you yes sir well ought to make a Baptist or Presbyterian shout did you know if Jesus is with you then you know all hell can come against you but it has no power over you that's right Satan has nothing over you Satan has no hold on you Satan can't do anything to harm God's children more than God would allow him to do when job was sitting there on the ash Heap no doubt he had lost everything he had got into a position where he's like you know I don't think I could lose no more but he never lost his faith in God I said I'm never going to lose my faith I don't care if God would you know what God may allow things to come against me but I'm going to tell you tonight I'm standing on a promise that he will restore everything back to me I'm here to tell you we are Abraham's children we are children of the promise tonight and God has promised to not leave you so why would you ever feel alone I think it's time that we realize he's still God and he changes not I could fail you man will fail you women can fail you people can fail you life may try to fail you but Jesus will never fail you why because he's not just a friend but he's your friend and your brother and he's taken you under his wings and he's got himself into your heart he's got his spirit in there and he can never leave you nor forsake you I think if we would just recognize that tonight I know you're tired I can tell by looking at you but let me just tell you this I wish you would just give Jesus a few more minutes to say you know what I may be tired in my body but the reason I can be in church tonight is because somebody gave me a desire and it wasn't the devil that made you sit here I've told you before the devil ain't going to make you go to church at 3:00 in the afternoon after you just got your belly full on food that's right the devil is not going to let you he's not going to make you go to the house of God he's going to try to get you to run as far as you can from it you're not going to drive an hour or two hours to go to church if it's the devil motivating you come on but it's Jesus on the inside and it's showing up in your life because you're listening to the word of God that said I would never he he said he said don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't wait for them Church doors to open so I say tonight if we can just get God in our hearts then it'll solve a whole lot of problems we got going on I tell you what it'll take care of church problems Church complexes people complexes preacher complexes it'll take care of a whole lot of problems if God would get on the inside of the people well brother Joel I've got the Holy Ghost let me just go aad and tell you something some of you Old-Timers need the refilling just like the young people do I don't doubt many of you got the Holy Ghost but a refill filling is a necessary thing to keep you in the hour that we're living in I don't need the Holy Ghost yes you do and refilling and refilling after refilling because the world is going to try to make you cold and Satan's going to try to make you he's going to try to take you out this hour do you realize it's his job to come and try to kill you and destroy you it was his job to make the wav so high that the disciples even that had seen Miracle after Miracle would get afraid of a storm on the sea and Jesus was right in the boat with them and you know what they did they went and called Jesus on the scene and you know what he did he took care of it he said fear not peace be still and did you know you have the same Authority come on somebody you have the same Authority that the disciples had to call Jesus on the scene in this hour and he's so close to you that when you say Lord I can't take the storm any longer I can't take the fear any longer I can't take this I can't take this complex any longer did you know he's still in the the boat all you got to do is go say Jesus I need you in this hour I Need You In This Storm I can't handle it on my own and he's right there waiting patiently to be called on the scene he's never left you you've never been in this alone and you never will be if you've taken on Jesus Christ in your heart Thank You Lord we get into a position to where we think we think we're not worthy to have Jesus with us just repent and give it to Jesus there was a disciple on that boat that probably didn't deserve to be there maybe several of them were sitting there and they were illiterate think about it these weren't the these weren't the ones that the priest and the scribes would have called to be preachers these were not the men that would have been next in line to take the biggest church these were men that Jesus went to personally on and these men here had something more than what the scribes and the Pharisees had they had a personal relationship with Jesus and when they got in trouble come on somebody when they got in trouble they had somebody they could talk to when you get in trouble you've got somebody you can talk to when you feel like you're alone you're not in this alone when you feel like you can't go any farther he's as close as your right arm oh yeah amen let me deal with this for just a moment I've only got about five minutes left according to my timer what keeps you from calling Jesus on the scene and realizing you're not in this alone is fear right but he said fear not he told the disciples fear not Jesus is with you I am in the boat I'm still in the middle when when you were at the lowest point of your life and many of you are thinking back h l you were he was there all the time all he was waiting on was hey call Call My Name call me up I'm ready to give you whatever you have need of I'm ready to fill you with the Holy Ghost young people did you know that once you're baptized all you got to do is believe it I told you that last week don't be doubting about receiving the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is right there waiting for you to receive it did you know there's many adults that are sitting there that have been baptized and they went to Youth Camp and they're sitting there today and they think well I just never got the whole ho ghost I'm a Christian because you know what I gave my heart to the Lord I've been baptized but I'm just waiting on the Holy Ghost did you know he's there he's just waiting on you to say I've got it I accept it I believe it it's mine did you know it's yours tonight it's always been there ready for you but you've got to ask Jesus Come into my heart come in and take control fill every fiber of my being come in and take over the things that I'm trying to do on my own I'm trying to live a life on my own I'm trying to go to church and raise children on my my own but if you try to do it on your own you're going to fail miserably but if you got Jesus in the home if you got Jesus in your corner then all hell can come against you but Jesus will take over when you can't go any farther thank you Lord you're not in it alone I'd like to say this you're not a hopeless case you've not went too far fear is a liar can you say Amen to that anxiety will try to come upon you and say well I just can't do this I can't go to church and I I I just can't go around these people cuz they make me scared well I say cast that demon of anxiety out come on somebody don't feed that Devil by saying you know what I'm going to go on Facebook and make me a post and say well I'm so anxious I can't talk to you I can't even be around you why don't you start confessing positive things why don't you start saying you know what Spirit of anxiety you're defeated why don't you start saying spirit of fear you're defeated Spirit of I tell you what whatever Spirit you've been dealing with say that spirit's name and say you're defeated Spirit of cancer Spirit of sickness whatever it is you're defeated today you don't have to accept that box of rattlesnakes in your life can you say amen I said you don't have to accept what the devil's got for you why is it so hard for people to live a Christian Life and and why are people so tossed about I'll tell you what it is fear has kept them from an overcoming life fear has kept them from their victory the 10 that we're standing back here saying we can't go over let me just tell you this if that's the idea that you've got we can't take the land you'll never take the land but if you can be like Joshua and Caleb and say you know what we're more than able I've got a spirit I've got a complex and I just can't overcome but we're more than able because greater is he that is within you and he's with you all the days of your life greater is that person than any devil that tries to come against you thank you well God is still in control can you say amen God has still got it all in his hands God knows exactly what you need and he would never put more on you than you can handle you believe that tonight I was looking at David and Goliath I talked about this maybe last week or a couple months ago and you know the strength of Goliath would have never defeat or excuse me the strength of David would have never defeated Goliath right that's right if you looked at himself he was never going to overcome on his own if he would have looked in the mirror one time he might have got scared to death but did you know who was standing behind him you know who was living in him did you know the the faith he had was in an unseen God oh I wish you could brother mentioned at the tent meeting looking at the Unseen if you could just look at the Unseen tonight and realize the angels that are lying in the walls you say well that was just brother brandham saying that for the tabern no that's with every believer because the Angels encamp around those that believe I believe believe there's Angels lining every Pew here tonight I believe there's Angels sitting right next to you you know you see a bunch of empty chairs I see a bunch of angels sitting there ready to go to battle for you come on somebody they're ready on Monday morning to get up with you and do what you want but you got to call Jesus on the scene don't try to go about it yourself don't try to live an overcoming life without the Holy Ghost right say well I I I want to live like a Christian I want to dress like like a Christian I want to be a Christian but I don't really want the Holy Ghost cuz it might make me act funny you know the Holy Ghost may very well make you act funny may very well it make you act crazy I liked what a brother said the other night whose fool are you I'm a fool for Jesus it may not look like much I may not be able to do much of my own but I like to say this I'm on the Lord's Side and whoever's on the Lord's Side let him come right on over here I say whoever's on the Lord's Side let him pick pick up his sword and go to fighting every devil that's trying to come against you that's what we we're in a battle this is not a picnic brother brandom said he said I'm I don't have I've got the quote but I can't get to it he said he said I'm afraid too many ministers have made it a flowery bed of ease to come to the Lord he said no he said it's a fight and you'll fight for every inch and every piece of ground you take but did you know that you've already been promised to be an overcomer did you know if those 10 could have looked over there and seen the results they wouldn't have they would never had any fear if they could have just looked at the results of the victory they would have never had the fear but he already went and saw the future and saw you Victorious I said you're an overcoming people all you got to do is say you know what I don't know about tomorrow but I Know Who Holds my future I don't know what's going to happen to me I don't know what's going to happen to my job I don't know what's going to happen to my children but I know who holds the future and I know he's got everything in his hands oh I hope somebody's hearing me tonight you may feel like it's out of control you may feel like the world is just going in a direction and you know what you look at the news and it'll make you feel like you're nothing and you're not going to make it well what's going to happen to my children and my grandchildren and our inheritances and all this stuff I tell you what just give it to Jesus just let let him know you know what Lord this is giving me anxiety this is giving me all kinds of problems this is giving me depression but if you'll just listen to the word of God and let him soothe you with the Holy Spirit and let the comforter come in and take you control of you young people then it won't matter when the devil tries to come against you because greater is he that is on the inside of you than he that's in the world trying to overtake you can you say amen I said greater is he that is in you you may be small and stature but you're great in the power of God I said That's goes for every one of us we may not be the smartest people in the world we may not be the best speakers in the message or in the world or in any other organization but I'll tell you this if God is in you you are the greatest force that Satan is has ever met in this world you are such a mighty force that you know Satan trembles when you get out of bed in the morning Satan's scared to death of you why are we so scared of him and I'd like to say it this way just before we close I paused my timer that wasn't good just before we Clos did you know if Goliath would have known the outcome he' to run too I say tell that devil what his outcome is I said tell that devil who he is where he come from and where he's going he may not know it but he's up against the greatest army in the world we're the greatest military force in the world oh come on somebody I said we're greater than the be I don't care how many how many rockets and how many you know all these machine guns and tanks and I don't care what they've got but you're a greater force I said it's going to take a stronger win than the devil to keep us from winning this Army if we could stand together musicians come I'm out of time but I want to say this you don't have to be fearful today because God that's right has not given you the spirit of fear but he's given you the spirit of Love Can you say amen he wants you to have a sound mind he doesn't want you to have complexes and depression right come on somebody I know Satan's going to fight your mind that's where the greatest battlefields at but I believe there's an army rising up in this day can you say Amen right I look across the land you can see pestilences and you can see all kinds of things taking place but there's a bride rising up there's somebody rising up to meet the challenge of the hour there's somebody going to take control of that devil in your home and say you know what Satan you're under my feet Satan you can't stay any longer because by God's word I cast you down and I'll say it again the word of God will defeat Satan on any grounds under any condition if you take your sword of faith and you just believe the word then don't you wait for something great to happen at a great meeting or something right here on this Sunday afternoon right here on this Sunday afternoon and on Monday morning when you take the sword and you go to Jesus say you know what Lord I'm not going to be cast down I'm not going to be defeated by the devil but you have raised me up for a purpose you have called me for a Time such as this and I'm not alone but I have a force with me that's so much greater than any Force Satan's God I wonder if you can say that tonight as a confession of your faith say greater is he greater is he I'm a bride I'm raising up in this age I'm going to overcome in this day I'm not on my own powers not on my own marriage but by grace in Jesus Christ and faith in his word I'm going to overcome it all in this day can you say praise the Lord I know this was I know this was simple but sometimes I was thinking about encouragement this week and I thought you know what we need to encourage ourselves in the Lord we need to encourage one another in the Lord I say take the word of God and it will defeat the Devil all you have to do is believe

maybe people that have to be at home and not able to come to church and they think does anybody care about me does anybody love me you're not in this alone you you middle-aged man goes to work on Monday and thinks I'm all by myself in the factory but you're not in this alone what an encourage encouraging message this afternoon thank brother Joel for doing that I I know it's his anniversary today but thankful for brother Joel and his stand for the word I pick on him a lot but that's just part of how you grow up I learned that from Brother Monroe how to pick on people so had to get brother Monro while he's here but but you know that's uh that's just part of it I first time brother Joel ever preached I announced I said if the Lord could speak through a donkey he could speak through brother Joel and and um boy the Lord has really worked in brother Joel's Ministry and we're so thankful for that and his faithfulness especially to the house of God and to the church just doing what needs to be done and I don't have to ask him to do that he just does that and I appreciate that appreciate all of you who are faithful to the house of God means so much to us and I'm I'm going to be uh preaching again on Friday night at brother Bose meetings it's a little bitty Church in Dyersburg Tennessee and I'm trying to just be encouraging to him he kept asking me if I could come and and brother Joel goes over there and preaches and they just love brother Joel but I'm going to go and try to put my shoulder to the wheel and that's on Friday night I'm not staying I'll be back here on Sunday but if anybody would like to go we'd sure be glad to have you because it is a very small Church it'd be encouraging to them if anybody wants to go it's about three hours from here we're going to have um several baptisms over the next two weeks um a couple of weeks and I don't know at least two and I think there's some others that that uh that got on their heart from that service last Sunday night sometimes sometimes you just have to preach the word say this is what repent and be baptized and the young people respond to that you do that in the right atmosphere things will happen I believe God always honors his word so we're thankful for that and we're just looking forward to each one of these kids now we're going to do that today but Allan's going to sing what we do is we just continue the service in the fellowship hall for just a few minutes and uh and our our sister Ella is going to be baptized now she's asked brother Joel to baptize her and I'm thankful for that I number one that gets me out of it so but uh but no I really it's always a privilege to baptize these kids but I think that's special brother Joel she she wrote a letter and said how she'd repented God uh repented of her sins and things like that isn't that precious and and uh that's wonderful isn't it and sister ell you just serve the Lord all the days of your life and remember your not in this alone you'll you'll be okay but so what we're going to do is brother Alan's going to sing a song and then we'll just go straight to the fellowship hall and we have a baptistry set up there and uh we'll go straight there and and brother Joel will read the scripture and conduct the baptism and so we're looking forward to that amen you love the Lord let's just bow our heads for just a moment Heavenly Father Lord I I pray especially for sister Ella today Lord that you'd bless her in her life oh God we're so so thankful for your for your continuing presence in our lives Lord and maybe she'd get older and she'd look back and say well I made some mistakes and did some things that not proud of but you were always there with me Lord and I know you will be pray you'd help her to believe that fill her with the Holy Spirit Lord and just walk with her Lord and be with her Lord maybe we look at these young people want to be baptized maybe it's getting close to the end maybe maybe the reason is because they feel that tug Lord if it is oh God lord I pray it would be so take us home oh god oh we we feel a drawing a pulling to your word Lord that same pull towards your word same pull to be baptized to be filled with the holy spirit that same PLL is going to pull us on home one of these days we're looking forward to that Lord Lord I I don't want one to miss it I want every one of us to be able to make it Lord I pray that that would be the case today oh God Lord if there's a if there's an unbeliever or makeb believer Lord change them oh God to a Believer may they believe your word Lord may we stand for you Lord as we go to the baptismal service may you just may you just work with us oh God help us and help our sister and her family Lord pray you grant it now in Jesus name Amen
