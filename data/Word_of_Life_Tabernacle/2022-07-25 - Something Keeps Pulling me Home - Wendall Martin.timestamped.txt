[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] so many are taking vacations
[0:06] looking for a new place to go
[0:09] [Music]
[0:11] the stress and the strength
[0:13] has proven insane at the end of the day
[0:18] they've been lost
[0:21] they've said to themselves if i can just
[0:24] get away
[0:26] to a quiet place all alone
[0:31] and while they're looking for a way
[0:34] to get out of town
[0:36] something keeps pulling me home
[0:41] when push comes to shove and hate
[0:44] conquers love that a man and the crowd
[0:48] stands alone
[0:51] while they're barely getting by
[0:54] on a natural high
[0:57] keeps pulling me home
[1:01] some live their lives in the fast lane
[1:06] others make life such a drag
[1:09] [Music]
[1:11] some say it's a game
[1:13] where they lose everything
[1:16] some's got it all in the back
[1:20] but i've heard when you're born you
[1:23] start dying that day
[1:25] and they fear that the next graves
[1:28] they're on
[1:29] i can't worry about pushing up daisies
[1:33] that way
[1:35] something keeps pulling me home
[1:39] when push comes to shove
[1:42] and hate conquers love that a man in a
[1:45] crowd stands alone
[1:49] while they're barely getting by on a
[1:51] natural high
[1:56] something keeps pulling me home
[2:00] when push comes to shock
[2:03] and hate conquers love that a man
[2:18] something keeps pulling me on
[2:33] hallelujah
