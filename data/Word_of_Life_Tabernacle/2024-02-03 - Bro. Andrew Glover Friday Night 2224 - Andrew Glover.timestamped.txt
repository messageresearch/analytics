[1:00:40] amen if you have your Bibles tonight we
[1:00:41] want to go to the Book of Luke the 24th
[1:00:43] chapter The Book of Luke the 24th
[1:00:45] chapter Amen brother Joel something's
[1:00:47] changed in this it's not hardly working
[1:00:49] so if I could get some more volume in my
[1:00:51] ear would be great amen Luke 24
[1:00:55] in verse 49 amen you all uh amen that's
[1:00:59] good it sounds better amen Luke 2449 I
[1:01:03] know you all are very familiar with that
[1:01:05] scripture amen you love the Lord tonight
[1:01:09] amen Luke
[1:01:10] 24 in verse 49 Jesus here said behold I
[1:01:15] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:01:19] but te ye in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:01:22] you be endued with power from on high
[1:01:27] now I want to say this we're not here
[1:01:29] tonight tearing the power has already
[1:01:31] been given tear ye in the city of
[1:01:34] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:01:38] from on high I believe that's the Holy
[1:01:40] Spirit don't you I believe that's the
[1:01:42] spiritual power that ues a church now in
[1:01:45] the book of 1 Timothy the 3 chapter 1
[1:01:48] Timothy 3 and verse number 15 I want to
[1:01:52] read one scripture there in 1 Timothy
[1:01:54] chapter 3 and verse number
[1:01:57] 15 Paul here uh writing to Timothy he
[1:02:01] says now if I T long that thou mayest
[1:02:04] know how thou oughtest to behave thyself
[1:02:08] in the house of God I love this next
[1:02:10] word he uses which is the Church of the
[1:02:15] Living God Amen so we're not the Church
[1:02:17] of a dead God but we are the Church of
[1:02:20] the Living God the pillar and ground of
[1:02:24] the the truth amen the church is the
[1:02:26] pillar and the ground of the truth we
[1:02:29] ask Lord this evening to add the
[1:02:31] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:02:32] you can have your seats here this
[1:02:34] afternoon amen we thank the Lord for the
[1:02:37] reading of the word of God Amen uh from
[1:02:40] those verses of scripture tonight if the
[1:02:41] Lord would help me I want to speak to
[1:02:43] you for just a few moments on this
[1:02:45] thought the powerful Church of the
[1:02:47] Living God Amen the powerful Church of
[1:02:51] the Living God you know I I believe
[1:02:53] tonight that we're not just a church I
[1:02:55] don't believe we're just members of a
[1:02:56] building or we're here just gathered
[1:02:59] amen but I believe we're a powerful
[1:03:01] force I believe we're a powerful group
[1:03:03] of people I believe amen that we are the
[1:03:06] powerful Church of the Living God now
[1:03:08] maybe just to draw this thought from a
[1:03:10] quote brother BR says in 1957 he said
[1:03:13] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:03:14] Life he said now if the Church of the
[1:03:17] Living God which is the pillar of the
[1:03:19] truth so the Church of the Living God is
[1:03:22] the pillar of the truth he said God
[1:03:25] intended this church to be a powerful
[1:03:28] church amen God intended this church to
[1:03:31] be a powerful church he said a glorious
[1:03:34] Church a church that the whole world
[1:03:37] Amen could look upon as a bride of
[1:03:39] Christ well expected amen espoused and
[1:03:42] to live in such an atmosphere and to
[1:03:45] conduct itself in such a way that God
[1:03:48] would be proud of this church to present
[1:03:50] it to Christ amen at the coming of the
[1:03:53] lord it's should live Amen in the
[1:03:56] characteristic in the church it should
[1:03:58] be living that way amen so this is not a
[1:04:01] dead church this is not amen a gathering
[1:04:04] of a bunch of dead Believers but this is
[1:04:06] a church amen where the power of God has
[1:04:09] found a right away and he's able to
[1:04:12] express his characteristic of power now
[1:04:14] enticing Spirits brother said I am
[1:04:16] positive sure this morning amen that if
[1:04:19] men and women could only get in the
[1:04:22] position of where their soul and their
[1:04:24] thinking and their attitudes amen would
[1:04:27] be perfect in the sight of God he said
[1:04:29] that would be one of the most powerful
[1:04:31] churches amen that ever existed amen if
[1:04:35] we could get our souls and our thinking
[1:04:37] and our attitude amen perfect in the
[1:04:40] sight of God Amen then that would be one
[1:04:42] of the most powerful churches that ever
[1:04:44] existed amen again now amen just to lay
[1:04:47] a foundation here in Luke
[1:04:49] 24:49 amen from the Amplified Bible it
[1:04:52] said listen carefully amen I am sending
[1:04:54] the promise of my father the Holy Spirit
[1:04:57] upon you but you are to remain in the
[1:05:00] city of Jerusalem until you are clothed
[1:05:03] amen or fully equipped with the power
[1:05:06] from on high amen so in other words they
[1:05:09] was in a they were in a naked condition
[1:05:11] amen but when the power came the power
[1:05:14] would be more than a feeling it would be
[1:05:16] more than a sensation but it would
[1:05:18] actually become the dress wearer amen
[1:05:20] that the church was supposed to wear
[1:05:22] again the emphatic diag I love this
[1:05:24] translation amen behold I send forth the
[1:05:27] promise of my father upon you amen but
[1:05:30] remain you in the city until you are
[1:05:32] invested amen with power from on high so
[1:05:35] in other words this power is not just
[1:05:37] clothing the church amen but it is
[1:05:40] investing in the church amen and that
[1:05:42] word power is dunamis which is where we
[1:05:45] get the word Dynamite from amen so we
[1:05:47] would not be cold in icicles amen but we
[1:05:50] would be cold with dunamus amen which
[1:05:53] would be power which would be the
[1:05:55] authority of God coming in the church
[1:05:58] amen that word power is strength it is
[1:06:00] ability amen it is inherent power it is
[1:06:04] power that is residing in a thing amen
[1:06:07] by virtue of its nature it is or which a
[1:06:09] person or thing exerts and puts forth
[1:06:12] amen it is the power for performing
[1:06:14] Miracles it is moral power and
[1:06:17] Excellence of the Soul it is the power
[1:06:19] and influence which belongs to riches
[1:06:22] and wealth it is power and resources
[1:06:25] amen arising from numbers I love this
[1:06:27] one it is power amen consisting in or
[1:06:31] resting upon armies amen or forces then
[1:06:34] do you realize tonight that you're not
[1:06:36] just a church amen but you are an army
[1:06:39] am and you are a force now I say this I
[1:06:42] believe I'm speaking to a prophetic
[1:06:44] class of people amen because the Book of
[1:06:46] Joel is a prophetic book right amen and
[1:06:49] Joel prophesied in the last days amen
[1:06:52] that there would be a great Army that
[1:06:54] would raise up amen and it would be an
[1:06:56] army that would not be ashamed amen
[1:06:59] because the Vats would be full amen the
[1:07:01] oil would be overrunning church amen
[1:07:04] we're not gathered here tonight amen
[1:07:06] ashamed of who we are ashamed of what we
[1:07:08] believe ashamed of what we're going
[1:07:10] through amen we know who we are we know
[1:07:13] where we come from we know where we're
[1:07:15] standing and the power of God is resting
[1:07:18] upon the church amen I believe it I
[1:07:21] believe that you are the liberated
[1:07:22] people who have liberated by the power
[1:07:25] of God that has been equipped in you and
[1:07:28] invested in you I believe it I believe
[1:07:31] when the Bible said amen Jesus was very
[1:07:34] specific he said I behold I Sinn amen
[1:07:37] the promise of my father upon you I love
[1:07:40] that word sin it means to order one to
[1:07:43] go to a place amen appointed that he may
[1:07:46] be Amen in a state of liberty so in
[1:07:49] other words the promise of the father
[1:07:52] amen was not bringing more bondage on
[1:07:54] the church but the promise of the father
[1:07:56] was bringing Liberty in the church amen
[1:07:58] that for the first time the church amen
[1:08:01] could manifest the full potentials that
[1:08:03] they was brought up the Earth to
[1:08:05] manifest that's why Jesus said amen you
[1:08:08] shall receive power amen after that the
[1:08:11] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:08:13] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:08:15] Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria
[1:08:19] unto the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:08:21] now I know the Holy Ghost has been SC
[1:08:24] alized the Holy Ghost has been ridiculed
[1:08:26] the Holy Ghost has been belittled and
[1:08:28] put out of some Churches amen but I want
[1:08:31] to stand here tonight and say I am a
[1:08:33] firm believer amen that the holy ghost
[1:08:36] is real the Holy Ghost is power the Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost is fire amen the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:41] Deliverance amen I am still one of those
[1:08:44] act two Holy Ghost still Believers that
[1:08:47] Mees the Holy Ghost amen can fix any
[1:08:49] situation it can heal any sickness it
[1:08:52] can deliver any bondage it can save any
[1:08:55] soul I don't know what your habits are
[1:08:57] and your addictions are I didn't come
[1:08:59] there to gather all those together I
[1:09:01] come to say the Holy Ghost can break the
[1:09:03] addiction the Holy Ghost can break the
[1:09:05] habits the Holy Ghost can save the soul
[1:09:08] the Holy Ghost can heal the heart I
[1:09:10] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:13] coming in the church in the power and
[1:09:16] dynamics that it was sent to amen if we
[1:09:18] know what the Holy Ghost is then we know
[1:09:21] what the Holy Ghost is not brother Cody
[1:09:23] if we know what the Holy Ghost is and we
[1:09:25] know what it's not amen and I'll tell
[1:09:27] you what the prophet said he said the
[1:09:30] Holy Ghost is the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:09:33] in
[1:09:35] you the Holy Ghost is the spirit of
[1:09:38] Jesus Christ in you can I say it like
[1:09:41] this the Holy Ghost is the power of God
[1:09:44] that sent you amen into the heart as a
[1:09:47] witness of the spirit amen you are born
[1:09:49] again and your life is cleaned up the
[1:09:52] world is dead all the stink of it amen

[1:10:06] creation and you are born of the spirit

[1:10:11] body is submissive to his spirit and
[1:10:14] you're moving in the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:17] you're not listening to the sound of the
[1:10:19] world oh Church of the Living God Amen I
[1:10:23] think that's c m right there amen that
[1:10:25] there is a people on the Earth tonight
[1:10:28] who has died to the gods of leosa they
[1:10:31] have died to the gods of America and
[1:10:33] they have been resurrected by the
[1:10:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost they're a new
[1:10:38] creation they're a new creature amen
[1:10:41] they don't have ears for anything amen
[1:10:43] but what the spirit has to say unto the
[1:10:46] church amen I'll say this the Holy Ghost
[1:10:49] is not power from the bishop it's not
[1:10:51] power from the church it's not power
[1:10:53] from a big preacher the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:56] the power of God from on high it's not a
[1:10:59] handshake it's not a letter amen it's
[1:11:02] not a group amen it's a gift of God with
[1:11:05] power from on high to demonstrate the
[1:11:09] resurrection of the one who is sended
[1:11:11] into the Earth I love what the prophet
[1:11:13] says he said the holy spirit is an
[1:11:17] experience it is an experience of being
[1:11:21] filled and endued with power for service
[1:11:24] and I say this you're not sitting here
[1:11:26] tonight amen full of a dead experience
[1:11:29] you are not sitting here tonight amen
[1:11:32] with a secondhand experience but if you
[1:11:34] have got the same holy ghost that they
[1:11:37] received on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:11:39] you have got the literal life of Jesus
[1:11:42] Christ in your soul and it is moving you
[1:11:45] it is leading you it is controlling
[1:11:49] you believe I believe we have received a
[1:11:52] true experience
[1:11:54] amen by true power amen now you all know
[1:11:56] that I'm a firm believer and God sending
[1:11:58] a prophet amen and that prophet's word
[1:12:01] amen being an absolute to the generation
[1:12:03] that it's sent into and the prophet said
[1:12:06] the true word amen comes to the true
[1:12:08] prophet and he tells you the true word
[1:12:11] then you follow the true word and you
[1:12:13] get an experience a true experience of
[1:12:16] the word and then the true Prophet comes
[1:12:19] with the true word and you receive that
[1:12:22] true word and you receive an experience
[1:12:24] of that true word amen then that true
[1:12:27] word becomes a power in you he said
[1:12:29] because the word is made flesh in you
[1:12:32] and you got God in you amen the word
[1:12:35] revolving out of you because you are his
[1:12:38] nature his spirit is in you and you'll
[1:12:41] do the works of God Amen how many
[1:12:44] Believers have we got here tonight amen
[1:12:46] that if you are a Believer amen then
[1:12:49] Mark 16 is not in a grave it is in flesh
[1:12:52] tonight if you are a Believer John 14 is
[1:12:56] not just reserved for a prophet it is
[1:12:58] revealed in the bride if you are a
[1:13:00] Believer tonight amen then God is under
[1:13:03] obligation Amen to give you the power to
[1:13:07] perform the promise for the age you're
[1:13:09] living in now brother said if you
[1:13:11] believe God and say you believe God and
[1:13:13] haven't received the Holy Ghost then
[1:13:15] there's something wrong with your faith
[1:13:17] and I'm just going to preach a little
[1:13:18] bit tonight cuz I think it's time to get
[1:13:21] the Holy Ghost I think it's time to
[1:13:23] bring back the Holy Ghost to the pulit I
[1:13:25] think it's time to bring it back to our
[1:13:27] young people we have we have robbed our
[1:13:29] young people amen of knowing that the
[1:13:31] Holy Ghost has the ability Amen to
[1:13:34] deliver them for pornography to deliver
[1:13:36] our marriages to deliver our families
[1:13:39] but I think it's high time that somebody
[1:13:42] remember that there's a Holy Ghost and
[1:13:44] he's got a power and he's got an
[1:13:46] authority and he has the ability to
[1:13:49] change the
[1:13:51] situation I believe in the Holy ghost I
[1:13:53] don't believe in Psychology I believe in
[1:13:56] the Holy Ghost and I believe what the
[1:13:58] prophet said he said God is under
[1:14:00] obligation to give every believer that
[1:14:02] repents amen and is baptized he is under
[1:14:06] obligation to give you the baptism of
[1:14:09] the Holy Spirit you say brother Andrew I
[1:14:11] have repented I have been baptized but I
[1:14:14] have not received the Holy Ghost well
[1:14:16] can I say this amen don't you let the
[1:14:18] devil move into that area in your life
[1:14:21] and begin to interpret whether you
[1:14:23] should have it or not come on don't you
[1:14:25] let the devil move in that little area
[1:14:28] and begin to say well you've been
[1:14:29] repented and you've been baptized amen
[1:14:31] but maybe the Holy Ghost is not for you
[1:14:34] amen that devil is a liar the prophet of
[1:14:37] God said that God is more willing to
[1:14:40] give the Holy Ghost then you're willing
[1:14:42] to receive
[1:14:44] it now come on either the prophet's
[1:14:46] right or he's wrong and I believe he's
[1:14:48] right he said he's more willing to give
[1:14:50] it to you than you are to receive it
[1:14:53] amen see God's under obligation to keep
[1:14:56] his word now let's just stop here for a
[1:14:59] second and say a lot of times people are
[1:15:01] praying for a ref a refilling or a
[1:15:03] receiving of the Holy Ghost and they
[1:15:05] bypass to repentance and I tell you why
[1:15:08] the prophet of God Amen breaks this down
[1:15:10] so beautiful he says that a man cannot
[1:15:13] lay in the presence of God and a church
[1:15:15] cannot stay in the presence of God Amen
[1:15:18] under repentance unless the Holy Spirit
[1:15:21] comes down church if you want to bring
[1:15:23] the holy ghost in a meeting amen start
[1:15:25] repenting and making things right and
[1:15:28] cleaning out the ditches and cleaning
[1:15:30] out the channel oh come onen I know what
[1:15:33] I'm talking about some people don't
[1:15:35] think we need to repent no more amen but
[1:15:38] I still believe in a good oldfashioned
[1:15:41] repentance come on church amen if we got
[1:15:44] so revelated we can't even repent no
[1:15:46] more have we got so self-righteous that
[1:15:48] we can't even say God I felt wrong I
[1:15:50] said wrong I looked at something wrong
[1:15:52] amen I tell you what we're praying for
[1:15:54] Revival and we're binding the spirit of
[1:15:57] Revival by unconfessed sin and
[1:16:00] unrepented things but if we would open
[1:16:02] our hearts tonight and let a coal of
[1:16:04] fire come up off the altar amen and
[1:16:06] touch the lips of the servant it would
[1:16:09] Chang us from an unclean condition and
[1:16:11] bring us into a position with God and he
[1:16:13] could unlock the windows of heaven and
[1:16:16] he could fill every empty vessel he
[1:16:18] could seal every Empty Soul he could
[1:16:20] change every heart amen repentance then
[1:16:23] brings the holy ghost in the building
[1:16:25] and gives unction and power to start a
[1:16:28] move of God in
[1:16:30] there when you begin to repent God
[1:16:33] begins to sin
[1:16:35] Hallelujah when we begin to confess God
[1:16:38] begins to
[1:16:39] forget come on church I'm preaching to
[1:16:42] you when we begin to forget amen the
[1:16:45] blessings of God and remember the curses
[1:16:47] of God we got a problem we've got to
[1:16:50] forget the Past come on do we believe in
[1:16:53] the blood or what do we believe in the
[1:16:55] power of the blood or what I still
[1:16:57] believe the power of the blood can
[1:16:59] cleanse a man can sanctify a man and
[1:17:02] contains a man's future I still believe
[1:17:05] there's power Brother David Paul I
[1:17:07] believe there's wonderwork power in the
[1:17:09] blood of Jesus Christ I believe the
[1:17:12] blood of Jesus Christ can take a drunk
[1:17:14] and make a holy ghost filled man I
[1:17:16] believe the Holy Ghost can take a sinner
[1:17:18] and make a son or daughter of God out of
[1:17:22] him blood has got power church amen and
[1:17:25] the power of the blood is the spirit of
[1:17:28] God flowing through that blood Satan
[1:17:30] hates the preaching of repentance amen
[1:17:33] I'll tell you what the devil does when
[1:17:35] when you start preaching about
[1:17:36] repentance the devil starts trying to
[1:17:38] lock the atmosphere up and tighten
[1:17:40] things up you know why because the Bible
[1:17:43] said there were two preachers that begin
[1:17:45] to preach repentance and when they begin
[1:17:47] to preach repentance the devil come
[1:17:48] after him you know who it was it was
[1:17:50] Paul and John the Baptist amen when Paul
[1:17:53] preach repentance the devil said kill
[1:17:55] him when John the Baptist preached
[1:17:57] repentance they said put his head on a
[1:17:58] platter I'll tell you the reason why
[1:18:01] amen the devil does not want repentance
[1:18:04] amen preached in the church brother said
[1:18:06] because when you thoroughly repent and
[1:18:08] believe on the Lord and are baptized in
[1:18:11] the name of Jesus Christ you make God a
[1:18:13] liar if you don't receive the Holy
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:18] Ghost well I would try to shut that
[1:18:20] repentance up amen but I want to tell
[1:18:23] you tonight that my God is not a liar my
[1:18:26] God is not a liar have I got any acts to
[1:18:29] Believers that can witness you've been
[1:18:31] Sanctified you've repented you've been
[1:18:34] baptized amen and you got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:38] amen how many's got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:40] if you got the Holy Ghost raise your
[1:18:42] hands and let the world know I've got
[1:18:45] the Holy Ghost and if you ain't got the
[1:18:47] Holy Ghost it's a good night to receive
[1:18:50] the Holy Ghost if you ain't got the S of
[1:18:52] God
[1:18:53] upon your soul it's a good night to
[1:18:55] receive
[1:18:57] it God is not a man neither is he the
[1:19:00] son of man that he should lie amen or he
[1:19:02] should repent amen he has said it and
[1:19:05] shall he not do it he has spoken it and
[1:19:08] shall he not make it good he said these
[1:19:11] words if you repent of your sins amen
[1:19:13] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:19:16] Christ you shall receive amen the gift
[1:19:19] of the Holy Ghost brother Tom that
[1:19:21] wasn't just good for the day of cost
[1:19:23] that wasn't just good for 161 PES amen
[1:19:26] but that promise is good here
[1:19:30] tonight I know we may be at the end of
[1:19:32] the Gentile ages amen but the same God
[1:19:35] that give the holy ghost in the
[1:19:36] beginning the alpha has become the Omega
[1:19:39] and he still gives the Holy Ghost and he
[1:19:42] still fills lies and he still fills
[1:19:44] Hearts amen I declare to you tonight
[1:19:47] amen that power belongs to God power
[1:19:50] belongs to God David said in 6211 he
[1:19:54] said God has spoken once and twice have
[1:19:57] I heard this amen that power belongeth
[1:19:59] under God and 1st Chronicles 29:12 he
[1:20:02] said both riches and honor come of thee
[1:20:05] and thou reignest over all and in thy
[1:20:07] hand is power and might and in thy hand
[1:20:10] is to make great and to give strength
[1:20:13] unto all Second Chronicles 258 he said
[1:20:16] but if th will go do it be strong for
[1:20:18] the battle amen for God shall make thee
[1:20:20] fall before the enemy amen for God hath
[1:20:24] power to help and to cast down I love

[1:20:49] brother Jeff they ain't Crossing and
[1:20:51] there ain't a bunch of confusion amen
[1:20:53] you know why because the god of creation
[1:20:55] amen said by my power I will separate
[1:20:58] the sea I will separate the mountains
[1:21:01] Church of the Living God if he can
[1:21:03] separate the Atlantic from the Pacific
[1:21:05] that he can separate you from sin he can
[1:21:07] separate you from the world he can
[1:21:09] separate you from unbelief I'm talking
[1:21:12] about a God who has the power to come on
[1:21:15] the scene and separate a life and fill
[1:21:18] that life with the very life of his own
[1:21:21] life he has the power to do it amen I
[1:21:24] love Psalm 656 which by his strength he
[1:21:28] Seth fast the mountains are y'all ready
[1:21:30] for this amen being guarded with his
[1:21:33] power them mountains out there have been
[1:21:36] set fast sister Vicki by the hand of God

[1:21:42] power of
[1:21:44] God all right you know what that word
[1:21:46] gir means it means to equip it means to
[1:21:49] clothe and what did Jesus say he said
[1:21:52] you shall receive clothing you shall
[1:21:55] receive power and the same power that
[1:21:59] holds the mountains is the same power
[1:22:01] that clothes the
[1:22:03] bride my goodness the same power that
[1:22:07] separate the sea is the same power that
[1:22:10] separates the bride amen from bab and
[1:22:13] confusion the same power Church brother

[1:22:25] God who has got more power than God it's
[1:22:29] an open challenge who's got more power
[1:22:31] than God let's let a prophet answer it

[1:22:36] amen over you to take care of you he are

[1:23:07] powerful Church the powers that created
[1:23:10] the universe is watching over you come

[1:23:18] the Seas he has the power to rescue the
[1:23:21] prodical he has the power to restore
[1:23:24] those that have been taken away I'm not
[1:23:26] talking about a weak old old grandpa I'm
[1:23:29] talking about Jesus I'm talking about
[1:23:31] Elohim I'm talking about the God who
[1:23:34] stepped out on nothing and by a display
[1:23:36] of his power created
[1:23:39] everything well y'all just give me some
[1:23:41] shout room here tonight I'm talking
[1:23:44] about the powerful Church of the Living
[1:23:47] God she's not on a pillar of emotion
[1:23:50] she's not on a pillar of sensation she's
[1:23:52] not on the pillar of feelings she is on
[1:23:55] the pillar of
[1:23:58] truth it's the truth that the power of
[1:24:00] God can deliver Hallelujah said the
[1:24:03] members of this virgin bride will love
[1:24:05] him and they will have his potentials
[1:24:08] for he is their head are y'all ready for
[1:24:10] this and all power belongs to him they
[1:24:15] are subject to him as the members of our
[1:24:18] body is subject to our heads now do you
[1:24:21] realize the Propet said that God's power
[1:24:24] is not to be made a
[1:24:26] show God does not make his power a show
[1:24:31] in other words God displaces
[1:24:34] power through the characteristic of
[1:24:36] himself now in Hebrews 1:1 the Bible
[1:24:39] said God who had sun right
[1:24:41] times in diverse maners spake in time
[1:24:44] passed unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:24:47] I love these words half in these last
[1:24:50] days half in these last days days amen
[1:24:53] spoken unto us by his son whom Heth
[1:24:55] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[1:24:58] also he made the worlds who being in the
[1:25:00] brightness of his glory Hebrews 1:3 who
[1:25:02] being in the brightness of his glory and
[1:25:05] the express image of his person and
[1:25:07] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:25:11] power somebody say that with me by the
[1:25:13] word of his power amen now watch this
[1:25:16] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:25:18] he sat down on the right hand of the
[1:25:21] Majesty on High brother picks this up in
[1:25:23] the Hebrew series chapter one he said
[1:25:26] the brightness of whose Glory God's
[1:25:28] glory the express image of whose
[1:25:30] presence God's he said Express image of
[1:25:33] his person and upholding all things amen
[1:25:36] by the word there you are the word that
[1:25:39] upholds all things see Jesus said that
[1:25:42] heavens and earth will pass away amen
[1:25:45] but my word shall never pass away watch
[1:25:48] this he upholds all things see science
[1:25:52] tries to tie it down and say it's an old
[1:25:55] book it's been translated amen even the
[1:25:57] Roman Catholic Church Bishop Sheen said
[1:26:00] that it's been translated four or five
[1:26:02] different times and there's not much to
[1:26:04] it you see you couldn't live by it if
[1:26:06] you had to but he upholds all things by
[1:26:09] his word that's what I think about it he
[1:26:11] says I believe the Bible amen the word
[1:26:15] of his power he said there's power in
[1:26:18] the word I'm going to preach to you amen
[1:26:21] there's not power in your feelings
[1:26:23] there's not power in my emotions there's
[1:26:25] not power in our sensation but there is
[1:26:27] power in the word as a matter of fact
[1:26:30] heavens and earth will pass away amen
[1:26:32] but my word shall never pass
[1:26:35] away now I'm just going to preach to you
[1:26:37] for a second amen because if that power
[1:26:40] comes into you it'll move you from a
[1:26:42] weak confession to a strong confession
[1:26:44] of Hebrews the third chapter if the word
[1:26:47] of his power ever becomes the power of
[1:26:49] your life it'll transform you amen from
[1:26:52] where you are to where God has ordained
[1:26:54] you to be listen Church there's
[1:26:56] Potentials in you amen there's power in
[1:26:59] you there's Authority in you and the
[1:27:02] devil's tried to tear it down Leia's
[1:27:04] tried to tear it down amen but I believe
[1:27:07] God and God's word said they shall walk
[1:27:10] and not get weary they shall run and not
[1:27:14] paint I'm preaching to you I'm
[1:27:17] identifying to you where your support is
[1:27:19] coming from it's coming from the power
[1:27:21] of God
[1:27:22] let me say this to you amen little
[1:27:24] church you're not waiting to be equipped
[1:27:26] you're fully
[1:27:28] equipped come on I'm not looking at a
[1:27:30] church that's waiting to be equipped my
[1:27:33] Prophet tells me we are fully equipped
[1:27:36] amen can I say this amen God wants to
[1:27:38] use some of you all he wants to use you
[1:27:41] he wants to use your life he wants to
[1:27:43] use your testimony amen but you let the
[1:27:45] devil so beat that down well I can't be
[1:27:48] used because of this and that but can I

[1:28:49] when brother preaches the seals he says
[1:28:51] these words tomorrow night by the grace
[1:28:53] of God breach he says we try to break
[1:28:55] that first seal if God will break it for
[1:28:57] us and let us see what this Revelation
[1:29:00] has been it's been hid from the
[1:29:03] foundation of the world he said but
[1:29:05] before we do that sinner friend or
[1:29:07] lukewarm church member do you just have
[1:29:09] a membership in a church or do you not
[1:29:12] have a membership if you have only a
[1:29:14] membership you'd be pretty near well off
[1:29:16] without it you need a birth you must
[1:29:18] come to the blood you must come to
[1:29:20] something that just the sin away till
[1:29:23] there's no more remembrance of
[1:29:26] it oh God whatever Revelation was coming
[1:29:30] out from under those seals had the power
[1:29:33] to not only forgive the bride but to
[1:29:35] justify the bride and the prophet
[1:29:38] announces that we don't just have a
[1:29:40] covering but Brother Bruce we have a
[1:29:42] bleach amen and it's a bleach of the
[1:29:45] blood come on and the prophet of God
[1:29:47] said the bleach of this blood is going
[1:29:49] to track that sin amen all the way back
[1:29:52] to the head of the devil that caused you
[1:29:54] to do it in the first place let me say
[1:29:57] this sin shall not have dominion over
[1:30:00] this powerful Church unbelief shall not
[1:30:03] have dominion over this powerful Church
[1:30:06] come on church I'm talking about the
[1:30:09] blood can I go ahead and say it
[1:30:11] condemnation shall not have dominion
[1:30:14] over this powerful Church guilt shall
[1:30:17] not
[1:30:18] have shall not have dominion over this
[1:30:22] powerful church he did not save you to
[1:30:25] put you under the chains of condemnation
[1:30:28] he did not deliver you to make you live
[1:30:31] under the fear and the guilt and the
[1:30:33] down days of your past but he who the
[1:30:36] son has made free is free
[1:30:41] indeed I say it to you by the authority
[1:30:44] of the word of almighty God you're the
[1:30:46] sinless you're the Spotless You're The

[1:30:56] it in the first place see if you haven't
[1:31:00] made preparation yet to meet that lamb
[1:31:02] in the air then watch a Prophet by the
[1:31:05] power invested
[1:31:08] me by the power invested me by my
[1:31:12] commission given by almighty God and
[1:31:15] ministered to me by an Angel a pillar of
[1:31:17] light I charge you in the name of Jesus
[1:31:20] Christ don't you try to meet him with
[1:31:23] only a membership of a lodge or a church
[1:31:26] of this Earth come while the mediator as
[1:31:29] far as I know he's still on the throne
[1:31:32] he's making intercession because there
[1:31:34] will come a day when you want to come
[1:31:37] and there'll be no mediator can I give
[1:31:39] that devil a black eye right
[1:31:41] now come on well brother Andrew if there
[1:31:44] was Grace I would come if there was

[1:31:50] told you there was no Merc mercy and
[1:31:52] there was no Grace amen I believe
[1:31:55] there's still a mediator on the throne
[1:31:57] tonight who has the ability to forgive
[1:31:59] sin he has the ability to forget
[1:32:02] iniquity and remember them no more
[1:32:06] forever hallelu now I'm this close to it
[1:32:09] I might as well preach it was a devil
[1:32:11] that invaded this message and some wise
[1:32:14] man got the idea that Mercy was over and
[1:32:17] there's no more grace and there's no
[1:32:19] more blood but you know what amazes me

[1:32:36] face amen if there's enough Mercy for
[1:32:39] your family there's enough Mercy for the
[1:32:41] Bride of Jesus Christ if there's enough
[1:32:43] Grace for some man's idea there's enough
[1:32:46] Grace for every name that's on the
[1:32:48] Lamb's Book of
[1:32:50] Life I believe it I believe he said
[1:32:53] we've seen the hour we're living in the
[1:32:55] seven Church age and the mysteries of
[1:32:58] God become what they have with the
[1:32:59] Vindicated spirit of God showing
[1:33:01] everything that he promised in the last
[1:33:04] days now can I say this how many how
[1:33:06] many's ever been to a wedding you've
[1:33:08] been to wedding you you most of you
[1:33:10] married people here amen you remember
[1:33:12] amen when the preacher stepped back and
[1:33:14] said these words he said by the power
[1:33:16] invested in me by the state of Arkansas
[1:33:19] I Now pronounce you husband wife you
[1:33:22] know what he's doing he's referring Amen
[1:33:24] to the legal Authority he's been given
[1:33:27] to join two and make them one in other
[1:33:30] words he's already give a space for
[1:33:33] somebody to contend this union he has
[1:33:36] stopped and said if anybody sees any
[1:33:39] reason why these two should not be
[1:33:40] lawfully joined together then let them
[1:33:42] speak now or forever hold their peace I
[1:33:46] can preach it to you by Rahab do you
[1:33:48] realize Rahab was a harlot but when she
[1:33:50] got under the to token she left the life
[1:33:53] of harlotry and married a general in the
[1:33:56] army of
[1:33:58] God she married a general in the army of
[1:34:01] God y'all imagine rahab's wedding
[1:34:03] ceremony and that preacher had to stop
[1:34:05] and say does anybody have any reason
[1:34:08] amen why these two should not be married
[1:34:10] and Rahab stand there real nervous
[1:34:12] because the whole Community knew what
[1:34:14] she was the whole town knew where she
[1:34:16] was but I can hear Joshua stand there
[1:34:19] and say Rahab don't you worry when those
[1:34:22] walls fail every accuser you
[1:34:26] had when those walls fail every accuser
[1:34:30] you had was crushed beneath those walls
[1:34:34] and you have been liberated oh Church of
[1:34:38] the Living God there's another Joshua
[1:34:40] and is coming this generation through
[1:34:42] the opening of Seven Seals and has
[1:34:45] married the bride to Christ and he stood
[1:34:47] back and said is there any reason why
[1:34:50] that Christ and this bride should not be
[1:34:52] married and you was nervous and I was
[1:34:55] nervous but then we remember there was a
[1:34:57] blood and the blood had drowned all of
[1:35:01] our accusers the blood had destroyed all
[1:35:04] of our
[1:35:06] sin now you can marry this new anointed
[1:35:10] word by the power invested in me I'll
[1:35:15] say this to you there's a marriage
[1:35:17] taking place on the
[1:35:18] earth there is a marriage taking place
[1:35:22] on the earth and there's a marriage
[1:35:24] supper the lamb going to be
[1:35:26] served in the skies now can I just go
[1:35:30] ahead and preach to you if the devil
[1:35:32] could stop your marriage he can't stop
[1:35:34] your
[1:35:37] reception no y'all didn't hear that if
[1:35:40] the devil could stop your marriage he
[1:35:42] won't stop your reception if the devil
[1:35:45] couldn't stop you from marrying this new
[1:35:48] anointed word he will not stop you from
[1:35:51] from changing bodies some morning
[1:35:53] between 6: and 9 and stepping from time
[1:35:56] into eternity and this corruptible will
[1:35:59] put on incorruption and this Mortal will
[1:36:02] take on immortality and then will be
[1:36:05] brought to pass the same that
[1:36:08] death is swallowed up in
[1:36:12] Victory well devil you lose again I said
[1:36:16] devil you lose again I think we ought to
[1:36:19] shout that devil back to the hell that
[1:36:21] he come out of devil you lose
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:28] again he couldn't stop your wedding come
[1:36:31] on can't stop your
[1:36:34] reception because you're controlled by
[1:36:37] the power of the Living God now what's a
[1:36:39] prophet there's only two powers in the
[1:36:40] universe today he said that's God's
[1:36:42] power and Satan's power that's right he
[1:36:44] said every war every disorder everything
[1:36:47] that comes along is either controlled by
[1:36:50] God's power or Satan's power see because
[1:36:53] there's only two Powers there is that is
[1:36:56] the power of life and the power of death
[1:36:59] can I say this now Satan has got his
[1:37:03] power he's got it see but it's the
[1:37:07] perverted power of God it's no real
[1:37:10] power it's a perversion of God's power
[1:37:14] everything Satan has is a perversion he
[1:37:17] said so we are today sitting here and
[1:37:20] one or the other Powers is going to
[1:37:23] control us now can I say this thanks be
[1:37:26] to God that God promised brother Dave he
[1:37:29] would restore the real power to the
[1:37:32] church in other words the prophet said I
[1:37:35] will restore sayth the Lord all the
[1:37:38] years now watch a prophet's
[1:37:39] interpretation I'll send back another
[1:37:43] church in the last days I will restore
[1:37:46] that original Power again in the evening
[1:37:50] time it shall now be light so in other
[1:37:53] words the same power that was shining in
[1:37:56] the alpha went down in the Dark Ages but
[1:37:59] would be restored in the end time and
[1:38:02] the same power would be shining again in
[1:38:04] the last day church as it was in the
[1:38:07] first
[1:38:08] day can I prove it to you he said
[1:38:11] there's been so much mockery in every
[1:38:12] phase of religion but there's a real
[1:38:14] power of the holy spirit that delivers
[1:38:17] the human being from the bondage of sin
[1:38:20] there's a real power of the holy spirit
[1:38:23] that delivers the sufferer from his
[1:38:27] suffering the devil brother Jeff
[1:38:29] contended with every Power on the face
[1:38:31] of the Earth until a prophet made a
[1:38:34] declaration that the Sun that sets in
[1:38:36] the west amen that rise in the west sets
[1:38:39] in the East and he made an announcement
[1:38:41] it is it is the rising of the sun now
[1:38:45] watch a prophet I'm so sick and tired of
[1:38:46] human philosophy I want to see the real
[1:38:49] power of God demonstr straight and move
[1:38:52] among his people where that Jesus Christ
[1:38:54] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:58] proving himself that's what the world is
[1:39:01] hungering for it may get tight here for
[1:39:03] a second amen but put on your seat belt
[1:39:06] we're going to get through iten are we
[1:39:07] going to shut the door in the face of
[1:39:10] the restoration of the original Power of
[1:39:13] God because some fanaticism has rose up
[1:39:16] around it are we going to slam the door
[1:39:18] in the face of the movement of the Holy
[1:39:20] Ghost because somebody done this or
[1:39:22] somebody went this far with it I think
[1:39:24] it's time to open up the door and let
[1:39:26] the original Power come back in the
[1:39:29] church with the same signs with the same
[1:39:32] wonders with the same Miracles with the
[1:39:34] same man come on church I think it's
[1:39:37] time to let the Son of God arise in the
[1:39:40] church
[1:39:42] again now I won't back up to that day
[1:39:45] amen because I tell you what we're
[1:39:46] worried about we're too worried about
[1:39:48] fanaticism come on we're too worried
[1:39:50] about fanaticism as if if there's any
[1:39:53] fanaticism there was no real at
[1:39:55] all come on y'all know I'm telling the
[1:39:58] truth amen so now we got shout police in
[1:40:00] church and we got praise police you know
[1:40:03] they kind of sit back there when
[1:40:04] somebody starts shouting well they try
[1:40:06] to qualify their shout if somebody
[1:40:08] breaks out and starts praising God well
[1:40:10] I might as well preach on here anyhow
[1:40:12] amen somebody starts praising God we get
[1:40:15] some old praise police raise up and say
[1:40:17] now don't go too far amen don't go too
[1:40:19] far well what about the one it went far
[1:40:22] enough come on we're try come on Church
[1:40:25] we're trying to draw a line and say you
[1:40:27] can only go this so far without it being
[1:40:29] fanaticism well I pray ask you what
[1:40:32] would you have done when brother brandom
[1:40:33] stood behind the pull pit and he put his
[1:40:35] leg over the pull pit and dangled his
[1:40:38] leg from the pull
[1:40:40] pit well sister sh well I'm this close
[1:40:44] to it am but I believe we got a witness
[1:40:46] of the power of God Amen sitting right
[1:40:48] here in this building tonight I remember
[1:40:50] a few days ago there in Oklahoma amen
[1:40:52] the power of God got a hold of that lady
[1:40:54] amen and without anybody with her she
[1:40:56] was outside the building shouting and
[1:40:59] rejoicing and praising God now come on
[1:41:01] some old devil would like to say that's
[1:41:03] fanaticism but it depends on who it's
[1:41:06] happening
[1:41:08] to well give me some shout R it depends
[1:41:12] on who it's happening to if it's
[1:41:14] happening to a cold formal church member
[1:41:16] it's fanaticism but if it's happening to
[1:41:19] one of those acts to sons of God that
[1:41:22] have receed the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:41:24] refreshing from the presence of God and
[1:41:27] we ought to welcome the moving of the
[1:41:29] Holy Ghost back in our
[1:41:34] churches well brother you're going to go
[1:41:36] too far why don't we go far
[1:41:38] enough real power of the resurrected
[1:41:41] Christ amen you say you're getting way
[1:41:43] out there am I though the real power is

[1:44:20] [Applause]
[1:44:25] yes get in trouble but I'm going preach
[1:44:27] here for a
[1:44:28] second we've let too many personalities
[1:44:30] invade the pull pit instead of
[1:44:33] preachers when I've been around and I've
[1:44:35] seen and I've dealt with we thank God
[1:44:37] for all your experience but the headship
[1:44:40] to this body is the message of the
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:45] hour and if we get back in the tapes
[1:44:48] come on church I know what I'm talk
[1:44:50] about we got young people around this
[1:44:52] message it's been 10 months of Sunday
[1:44:54] since they heard the prophet but they're
[1:44:56] called up on every preacher and hey
[1:44:58] glory to God you know what it is it's a
[1:45:01] spirit of Lea where it's too hard to
[1:45:04] listen to a tape so we got to listen to
[1:45:06] some
[1:45:08] man I believe in streaming and I thank
[1:45:10] God for it amen but can we make our
[1:45:13] homes dedicated to the tapes
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:19] again brother B I'm just going to preach
[1:45:21] if that's okay cuz what happens is is
[1:45:24] you get up nothing against it but you
[1:45:25] get a bunch of people listen to one man
[1:45:27] and the way he preaches something and
[1:45:29] the way he teaches his church then they
[1:45:31] come in Ben's church and when Ben
[1:45:33] teaches it the way the prophet teach it
[1:45:35] they say well that's not the way brother
[1:45:36] so and so teaches it so then you put
[1:45:38] brother so and so in the message in a
[1:45:40] battle Amen on who's right amen but we
[1:45:43] can escape a lot of this nonsense if we
[1:45:45] would get back to saying the takes are
[1:45:47] right and the prophet is right and the
[1:45:50] message is right and everything else is
[1:45:53] wrong I don't care how I teach it Ben
[1:45:56] teaches it brother Sean teach or any
[1:45:58] other preacher teaches it if it's
[1:46:00] contrary to what a prophet Tau you fold
[1:46:03] it away and stand with a word of his
[1:46:06] power that's been Vindicated and made
[1:46:09] manifest in this
[1:46:14] generation we're not going to overcome
[1:46:16] wrong with
[1:46:18] wrong we're not going to over become
[1:46:20] false Doctrine with more false
[1:46:23] Doctrine I'm talking about the powerful
[1:46:25] church if that's
[1:46:27] okay we've let the world's understanding
[1:46:29] of what power is come in and invade our
[1:46:31] lives and literally Rob us of the truth
[1:46:34] of what power
[1:46:37] is can I take some Liberty here Pro to
[1:46:40] God said how could Satan say that man
[1:46:42] could be God speaking of Jesus a man
[1:46:44] that could take the challenge of a
[1:46:46] priest right and let a drunken Soldier
[1:46:50] spit in his
[1:46:52] face today we got the wrong conception
[1:46:55] of what power is ready for this power is
[1:47:00] overcoming oh yeah Power is overcoming
[1:47:04] returning good for evil that's real
[1:47:08] power now come on church if we're going
[1:47:11] to be sons of God manifested Messiah
[1:47:14] then let's say what a prophet said and
[1:47:16] he said according to Joel 2 in the last
[1:47:19] days there would be a restor
[1:47:21] of the real power in the True Church of
[1:47:24] God In the End Time and here a prophet
[1:47:26] says that real power is returning good
[1:47:29] for evil that you can love your enemy
[1:47:32] and do good to those that do evil to you
[1:47:35] that's real
[1:47:38] power oh brother getting pretty close
[1:47:41] ain't it David Paul that's real power
[1:47:44] that's God's power yes sir Maniacs can
[1:47:48] break chains but it takes a real man to
[1:47:51] return good for evil from his heart not
[1:47:54] because of religious duty but from his
[1:47:57] heart come on Church who said that the
[1:48:00] return of real power would be the
[1:48:02] restoration of God's power it was
[1:48:05] Malachi 4 who said in the days that the
[1:48:08] heart would turn to God the veil would
[1:48:10] be taken
[1:48:13] off do now now do we want to preach or
[1:48:15] we want to go
[1:48:16] home do we want to manifest the real
[1:48:19] power of God do we want to be a powerful
[1:48:21] church or do we want to be another
[1:48:23] fighting Church another arguing come on
[1:48:26] Church do we want to be another bunch of
[1:48:29] people 30 years down the road still
[1:48:31] fighting about something taught 50 years
[1:48:33] ago I say it's time to manifest the
[1:48:36] original Power of the Holy Ghost through
[1:48:38] the Forgiveness of
[1:48:41] God now I tell you what the Bible said
[1:48:44] the Bible said that Jesus was the son of
[1:48:46] God and a prophet said the devil said
[1:48:49] how could that man who was hanging on
[1:48:51] the cross be God has it ever dawned on
[1:48:53] you Brother David when he was hanging
[1:48:55] there he wasn't fighting with those on
[1:48:56] the
[1:48:59] ground I'm preaching to you he wasn't
[1:49:01] arguing with those on the ground he
[1:49:03] wasn't arguing with the Pharisees and
[1:49:06] shooting at the Sadducees and fussing
[1:49:08] with the Roman soldiers that was
[1:49:09] spitting in his beard but these are the
[1:49:11] words he said he said
[1:49:15] father father forgive them for they know
[1:49:19] not what
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:22] do now can we go ahead and let the
[1:49:24] rubber hit the road and preach a second
[1:49:26] that's your example brother Ben that's
[1:49:28] our example amen that Jesus hung on a
[1:49:31] cross and he manifested the power of God
[1:49:35] which is the original Power which is the
[1:49:37] real power and the way he manifested it
[1:49:40] was not pulling the nails out of his
[1:49:42] hands or taking the Thorns off of his
[1:49:44] head or or or holding putting a cover
[1:49:47] over his ribbon side but the way he
[1:49:49] manifested the power was through these
[1:49:51] words father oh
[1:49:54] yeah father forgive them for they know
[1:49:58] not what they
[1:50:01] do I know where I'm at right now father
[1:50:05] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:50:07] do in other words the same power that
[1:50:10] manifested in the head is going to
[1:50:13] manifest in the body come on now if
[1:50:16] you're returning evil for evil you're
[1:50:19] not manifesting in the original
[1:50:22] Power come on now if you're returning
[1:50:25] evil for evil you're not manifesting the
[1:50:27] powerful Church of the Living God on the
[1:50:30] Pillar of Truth you're manifesting a
[1:50:32] perverted power and anybody can do
[1:50:36] that on now I'm going to say it like the
[1:50:39] prophet said he said now watch from the
[1:50:40] pulpit I spoke a mighty scientist not
[1:50:42] long ago he said what he said here he
[1:50:44] said brother brandom there was a meter
[1:50:46] put on a Dy Saint can I preach a minute
[1:50:50] and when they were dying it slipped off
[1:50:52] in a room and her knowing nothing about
[1:50:54] it when her death struck her she wasn't
[1:50:58] afraid see she lifted up her eyes and
[1:51:01] now watch what she done when death
[1:51:02] struck her she lifted up her eyes and
[1:51:05] asked God to forgive every enemy she
[1:51:12] had she's laying on her deathbed brother
[1:51:14] Sean but there's to be a church with a
[1:51:18] restoration of the real power and here
[1:51:21] is a member of the body manifesting what
[1:51:24] the head did that day on Calvary she
[1:51:27] said father forgive every enemy I have
[1:51:29] and she thanked him for her life as she
[1:51:31] lived and when that meter was put on
[1:51:33] zero there was enough power raised from
[1:51:35] that woman Supernatural something that
[1:51:38] went from her that called onto that
[1:51:39] meter made out of the same thing as a
[1:51:41] lie detector that's your nerves he said
[1:51:43] now watch there was enough power that
[1:51:46] was coming from that woman to send a
[1:51:48] radio message around the world five
[1:51:50] times I believe it was amen of power
[1:51:53] coming off of that Dy woman he said go
[1:51:55] on beyond the moon the stars to the
[1:51:57] throne of God with that prayer of a
[1:51:59] sinner's poor heart in the hours of her
[1:52:03] death when she was laying on her death
[1:52:06] bed she wasn't fighting with her enemies
[1:52:08] she wasn't shooting at her adversaries
[1:52:10] she was laying there as a manifested
[1:52:13] display of the restoration of the
[1:52:15] original Power of God and she cried
[1:52:18] these words she said father forgive
[1:52:21] them can I tell you what the prophet
[1:52:23] said he said the re he said the
[1:52:25] perverted power it won't manifest like
[1:52:27] that he said there was a man laying
[1:52:29] there an Infidel dying with a veneral
[1:52:30] disease sent a young lady in there to
[1:52:32] get him all emotionally worked up then
[1:52:34] when he got angry with her begin to
[1:52:36] curse and take God's name in vain and
[1:52:38] the meter turned back as far as the
[1:52:39] other way as the Christian did this way
[1:52:41] he said what is it the the scientist
[1:52:43] said if God respects people who use his
[1:52:46] name in The Glorious way and believe him
[1:52:48] that much I now believe in the Lord
[1:52:51] Jesus Christ and accept him as a savior
[1:52:54] are you all hear what I'm talking about
[1:52:56] that's the power of this message a woman
[1:52:59] laying on a deathbed with an unconverted
[1:53:02] scientist could manifest the life of
[1:53:05] Jesus Christ and say father forgive him
[1:53:08] and an old Infidel laying there amen
[1:53:10] could Curse God and the scientist was
[1:53:15] converted are you hearing me well I'm
[1:53:17] going to say it it's time to get back to
[1:53:20] forgiving
[1:53:23] again I said it's time to get back to
[1:53:26] forgiving again and letting some things
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:31] go I said it's time to get back to
[1:53:34] forgiving again and letting some things
[1:53:36] go you're going to hold on to it and
[1:53:38] hold on to it till you're sub bitter oh
[1:53:41] come on I might as well plow into it I'm
[1:53:44] this close to it amen but I refuse to
[1:53:46] let the devil amen Crown my life when an
[1:53:49] old crabbed Spirit of
[1:53:52] [Applause]
[1:53:53] bitterness now I know what I'm talking
[1:53:55] about cuz I got some Elders in here
[1:53:57] right now and are pulling my guts out
[1:54:00] you know why I can say that because
[1:54:01] they've been through enough that they
[1:54:03] should be hard they should be bitter
[1:54:05] they should be evil they should be
[1:54:07] contous they should be mean but
[1:54:09] somewhere or another brother Joel they
[1:54:12] come in contact with the original Power
[1:54:15] of the Holy Ghost and it didn't just
[1:54:17] cause him to dance it didn't just cause
[1:54:19] to shout but it caused them to forgive
[1:54:22] and let the love of God come back in
[1:54:24] their life
[1:54:29] again brother and you getting way out
[1:54:31] there am I really am I really brother
[1:54:35] said watch he said those lights around
[1:54:36] the Savior and around the Saints was not
[1:54:38] just some mental conception he said it
[1:54:41] was God now this is the scientist oh God
[1:54:43] I wish I could break this down the way
[1:54:44] I'm seeing this was the scientist yeah
[1:54:47] come on brother Judah who's just seen
[1:54:50] this woman forgive and this man die
[1:54:52] cursing God and he stands between them
[1:54:55] and he he learns that God is more than a
[1:54:58] religion but he's a power he's a
[1:55:01] supernatural power and he surrenders his
[1:55:03] life to Jesus Christ now watch what he
[1:55:05] says he said he testified to brother
[1:55:07] brandom he said the power that was
[1:55:09] coming off of that woman was the same
[1:55:12] power that was around the brass serpent
[1:55:14] in the days of Israel amen oh yeah are
[1:55:19] you y'all hearing me the same power that
[1:55:22] was that was coming off that was
[1:55:24] radiating off of her was the same power
[1:55:27] brother Danny that was around the brass
[1:55:28] serpent brother B said I asked him what
[1:55:31] about the pillar of fire he said yes sir
[1:55:33] he said the only problem is they didn't
[1:55:35] have a camera back then to catch what
[1:55:37] they've caught
[1:55:39] now are y'all hearing me then that tells
[1:55:42] me that the pillar of fire is more than
[1:55:44] a decoration it's more than a picture
[1:55:47] but whatever you see in that light is is
[1:55:49] the same Radiance of power that was
[1:55:52] around the brass serpent in the
[1:55:54] days y'all got that picture have y'all
[1:55:57] got that picture the pillar of fire can
[1:55:59] you put it up there for me amen amen
[1:56:01] that picture is more than just a wall
[1:56:04] picture it's more than just a memorial
[1:56:07] it is a reflection that the original
[1:56:09] power of God has returned to the
[1:56:13] church and a prophet has brought it down
[1:56:15] so narrow to say your attitude towards
[1:56:19] that picture can determine your
[1:56:22] outcome I know what I'm talking about
[1:56:24] amen because there was a man a Baptist
[1:56:26] preacher he said he walked in one day
[1:56:29] and he saw the picture if you can't find
[1:56:31] it it's okay I know you're familiar with
[1:56:32] it here but he walked in seen the
[1:56:34] picture brother Joe the prophet of God
[1:56:36] said he just kind of snubbed in his
[1:56:38] heart a little bit and made a little
[1:56:40] laugh said that man blasphemed he
[1:56:43] blasphemed sealed his eternal Doom he
[1:56:46] said and went against God but Brother
[1:56:48] David Paul there was little one woman
[1:56:50] who was laying on her deathbed and the
[1:56:52] doctor said she was going to die of
[1:56:54] cancer and they brought that picture in
[1:56:56] the room Oh Glory to God they brought
[1:56:59] that picture in the room and Brother
[1:57:01] Bruce when they put that picture up the
[1:57:03] prophet of God said she looked at that
[1:57:05] picture and she said that's our Lord up
[1:57:08] there he said instantly she was healed
[1:57:10] of cancer and got up off of that
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:14] bed are y'all hearing me this is more
[1:57:17] than just a happy go-lucky message

[1:57:22] the Dynamics in the age we're living

[1:57:35] you've been lied on you've been
[1:57:37] scandalized you've been criticized but
[1:57:39] you got enough of the power of God in

[1:58:27] age on I have seen the power of God I'm
[1:58:30] going to just preach I'm here it's in

[1:59:27] something I could just see him hanging
[1:59:29] there and I heard these words in the
[1:59:31] back of my mind father forgive them oh
[1:59:35] on I said sister I said do you want to
[1:59:38] manifest God or do you want to manifest

[1:59:47] 2,000 years ago and he hung there and he
[1:59:50] looked in the face of the ones that put
[1:59:52] him there and he didn't scandalize them
[1:59:54] he didn't Bel them I said these were his
[1:59:57] words he said father forgive them for

[2:01:52] him are y'all hearing me I'm talking
[2:01:55] about a powerful church I'm talking
[2:01:58] about a church where unforgiveness can't
[2:02:00] stay I'm talking about a church where
[2:02:03] fears and complexes and this would hurt
[2:02:05] me and that would hurt me it cannot stay
[2:02:08] this is not the pillar for unforgiveness
[2:02:11] this is not the pillar for bitterness
[2:02:13] this is the house of God and it's the
[2:02:15] Church of the Living God I say open up
[2:02:18] the windows of Heaven tonight and
[2:02:20] release the forgiving Spirit of almighty
[2:02:23] God upon the church we got to let some
[2:02:25] things go we got to let some things go
[2:02:28] we are not a cold formal intellectual
[2:02:31] church we are a powerful church and our
[2:02:34] power is coming from the ability to
[2:02:37] manifest God in the age we're living
[2:02:42] in now I'm way out there but I'll say
[2:02:46] this in
[2:02:47] closing you want to manifest the power
[2:02:50] of God you gotta let some things
[2:02:54] go come on all right you got to let some
[2:02:58] things
[2:02:59] go that's good
[2:03:04] that's well she said and he said and
[2:03:09] they
[2:03:13] conspired but you got to let it
[2:03:17] go
[2:03:21] on can I tell you what unforgiveness is
[2:03:22] like unforgiveness is like drinking
[2:03:25] poison hope and it kills the person that
[2:03:28] hurt you all
[2:03:29] right
[2:03:33] right I know we ain't shout but devils
[2:03:35] are backing up right
[2:03:37] now unforgiveness is like drinking
[2:03:39] poison and hoping is killing the person
[2:03:42] that hurt
[2:03:43] you come
[2:03:47] on
[2:03:49] it's the truth do we believe in the
[2:03:52] power of God do we believe the power of
[2:03:55] God can still fix
[2:03:57] things what about it Hardy do we believe
[2:03:59] the power of God can still fix things do
[2:04:03] we believe the power of God can still
[2:04:05] forget the past and forgive the Past
[2:04:09] come on we're one Church we're one body
[2:04:12] with one motive and one objective and
[2:04:14] that is the message of the Hour come on
[2:04:16] our babies need to know that we can
[2:04:18] forgive
[2:04:22] come on I'm preaching to you now and I
[2:04:24] know the devil don't like it but I'm
[2:04:25] going to keep saying it because if we're
[2:04:27] not careful we're going to get so
[2:04:31] resentful we're going to get so

[2:19:16] here prophet God said you can scream and
[2:19:18] shout and jump up and down all you want
[2:19:20] to but deny this word it won't do any
[2:19:22] good you're just cranking around on the
[2:19:25] Pistons got the spark there to fire but
[2:19:27] no gasoline to fire it by it'll only
[2:19:30] work as they come together so one will
[2:19:31] sit still and the other will go up
[2:19:33] that's the only thing there is to it yes
[2:19:35] both alike both claim to be churches
[2:19:36] both claim to be bride but one has
[2:19:38] mechanics and Dynamics and it brings it
[2:19:40] to pass of what he has said is the truth
[2:19:42] when the Dynamics come and the fire is
[2:19:44] made to connect with the octane and the
[2:19:45] gasoline when that explodes it causes a
[2:19:48] combustion and that combustion moves
[2:19:50] every motion every move for he is the
[2:19:52] same yesterday today and forever that's
[2:19:54] the resurrection that's the real power
[2:19:56] of God mechanics with the Dynamics it's
[2:19:59] the spark that fires not the gas that
[2:20:02] fires it's the spark that fires the
[2:20:07] gas said brother Andrew why did you read
[2:20:09] that because I invite the spark of the
[2:20:13] Holy Ghost to strike the gas
[2:20:17] [Music]

[2:24:07] this and break the Devil's
[2:24:10] Backbone I know you thought I was
[2:24:12] preaching about a powerful church and I
[2:24:15] am but I'm preaching about manifesting
[2:24:17] the power of God through the nature of
[2:24:20] God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:24] y'all remember brother Braham talked
[2:24:25] about the angel of the Lord come to him
[2:24:26] and told Brother Neville he said brother
[2:24:27] Neville he said you know he said the
[2:24:29] angel of the Lord told him he said
[2:24:31] brother Neville he come to me and told
[2:24:32] me that all this Discerning and things
[2:24:34] that's going on he said you're he said
[2:24:36] you're hitting some he said but you're
[2:24:37] going to miss eventually and he said the
[2:24:39] angel come to me and told me to tell you
[2:24:41] stop
[2:24:42] it and brother Neville listened to him
[2:24:46] and moved on
[2:24:48] you know what brother Neville didn't
[2:24:49] hear that from he didn't hear that from
[2:24:50] 10
[2:24:52] churches or 10 other preachers wasn't
[2:24:54] talking about it and then it got to
[2:24:55] brother
[2:24:56] Neville brother BR went right to him and
[2:24:59] broke the spirit and they moved
[2:25:01] on now either we're the Church of the
[2:25:03] Living God on the pillar of truth or
[2:25:05] we're
[2:25:07] not I think it's time to get back to
[2:25:10] stop in
[2:25:12] spirit cuz gossiping leads to more
[2:25:15] unforgiveness and more hurt feeling
