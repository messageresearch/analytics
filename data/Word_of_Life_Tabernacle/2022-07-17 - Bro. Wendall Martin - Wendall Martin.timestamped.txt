[1:25:45] just make them stand the whole time you
[1:25:47] want to make them comfortable
[1:25:49] you want to you want to make them feel
[1:25:51] like they're welcome
[1:25:52] amen and so when you're entertaining the
[1:25:55] presence of the lord amen i want to tell
[1:25:58] you this is greater than just
[1:25:59] entertaining uh uh your your uncle or
[1:26:02] amen grandpa or grandma or mom and dad
[1:26:05] or your friends entertaining the
[1:26:07] presence of god is something that is
[1:26:10] that is the greatest thing that you
[1:26:11] could ever have to entertain the
[1:26:14] presence of the lord is the greatest
[1:26:18] is the greatest privilege that you could
[1:26:21] ever possess as as a human being and for
[1:26:25] sure as a christian can you say amen so
[1:26:28] what have we been doing this weekend we
[1:26:30] have been entertaining the presence of
[1:26:33] the lord
[1:26:34] hallelujah friends i think that god
[1:26:37] should feel comfortable in our homes
[1:26:39] god should feel comfortable in our
[1:26:41] churches god should feel comfortable on
[1:26:43] our jobs god should feel comfortable
[1:26:45] wherever we are we should entertain the
[1:26:49] presence of the lord now the scripture
[1:26:51] says as it was in the days of sodom so
[1:26:55] shall it be in the revealing of the son
[1:26:58] of man now there will be a revealing and
[1:27:01] there will be a receiving everyone say
[1:27:03] it with me there will be a revealing
[1:27:05] and a receiving amen now what good is it
[1:27:09] to have a revealing if there is no
[1:27:11] receiving what good is for the lord to
[1:27:14] come and there's no one there to welcome
[1:27:17] his presence brother random told us amen
[1:27:20] about the unwelcome christ amen coming
[1:27:22] to the the pharisees house he showed up
[1:27:25] like he said he would come but yet they
[1:27:28] did not entertain him amen he sat there
[1:27:32] unrecognized set there unloved sat there
[1:27:35] amen no one was entertaining him amen so
[1:27:38] saints of god i think in order for god
[1:27:42] to be welcome we must entertain him
[1:27:47] hallelujah well praise the lord amen
[1:27:49] when you're waking up in the morning
[1:27:51] time amen you the first thing that you
[1:27:53] should do is lord jesus i just want you
[1:27:56] to know that i love you amen before you
[1:27:58] leave the house you say lord i want you
[1:28:01] to go walk with me today hallelujah i
[1:28:04] want you to fellowship with me today i
[1:28:07] want you with me
[1:28:11] amen brother andrew was talking last
[1:28:13] night about the amen about the preacher
[1:28:15] standing up you know amen everyone that
[1:28:18] might be sitting there thinking what in
[1:28:20] the world are you doing hallelujah amen
[1:28:22] but you see a preacher knows
[1:28:25] that a preacher needs the presence of
[1:28:27] god
[1:28:28] there ain't nobody knows like a preacher
[1:28:30] knows amen uh to preach a sermon without
[1:28:34] the presence of the lord i mean somebody
[1:28:36] i heard somebody say you know amen i've
[1:28:39] been preaching for 50 years and i've
[1:28:40] only preached without the anointing once
[1:28:42] and i thought dear god that'd be
[1:28:44] something to have hallelujah amen ain't
[1:28:47] nobody knows how to preach what it's
[1:28:49] like to preach without god being there
[1:28:53] amen so what does a minister do he is
[1:28:56] pulling on the gift
[1:28:58] what is what is he trying to do he's
[1:29:00] wanting to get that preacher out of his
[1:29:04] aim in humanity and into the presence of
[1:29:07] god because if that preacher can ever
[1:29:09] get into the presence of god amen
[1:29:11] there's going to be virtue and healing
[1:29:13] and the supernatural and the presence of
[1:29:16] god with us oh come on now you don't
[1:29:19] want to hear me just saying you don't
[1:29:21] want to hear me just preach but you want
[1:29:24] the presence of god in our midst he may
[1:29:28] let this church be a church that god
[1:29:32] feels comfortable in where the anointing
[1:29:35] of god is right there in oh come on
[1:29:38] church but it don't just happen here in
[1:29:40] the church it'll happen right there in
[1:29:42] your home if you'll make him welcome
[1:29:47] praise the lord
[1:29:50] hallelujah but this day is a lot like
[1:29:53] the days of sodom
[1:29:54] it's a day of self abs absolute self
[1:29:57] gratification
[1:29:58] amen it's a it's a day where every man
[1:30:01] did that which was right in his own eyes
[1:30:04] he man until there was no boundaries to
[1:30:06] the sin they were discovering their
[1:30:08] sexuality and in different ways and amen
[1:30:11] they were known for their homosexuality
[1:30:13] the children were were no doubt told
[1:30:15] that they were born gender-neutral and
[1:30:17] as long as they wanted it they could
[1:30:19] have it amen it was there was no
[1:30:21] questioning of the belief system there
[1:30:23] was nothing there to a man to stand as a
[1:30:26] standard and lot senses had become so
[1:30:30] numbed until he become accustomed to the
[1:30:34] new norm amen lot become accustomed to
[1:30:38] the ways of sodom amen lot done this
[1:30:42] he meant he could rub shoulders with him
[1:30:44] and literally thank god surely he meant
[1:30:47] surely god looks upon their heart and
[1:30:49] surely god loves them amen people love
[1:30:52] god in their own way i mean they're
[1:30:54] going to their shrines and their
[1:30:56] churches are their synagogues amen
[1:30:59] they're they're going to their temples
[1:31:01] and offering their sacrifices amen are
[1:31:03] you hearing me the sodomites were
[1:31:06] worshippers too
[1:31:07] even they were worshipers amen now their
[1:31:10] worshipping wasn't as strict as as
[1:31:12] abraham they full-heartedly believed
[1:31:15] that amen that they would be accepted to
[1:31:18] amen oh yes amen there was a plenty of
[1:31:22] worship that was going on amen the
[1:31:25] scripture says amen but it was a
[1:31:28] different worship are you hearing me
[1:31:31] they did not see lot could not see
[1:31:34] abraham's way of seeing things
[1:31:37] lord could not see that sodom was fixing
[1:31:40] to burn lord could not see amen that the
[1:31:43] end was coming lot could not see the
[1:31:46] wrath of god was fixing to be poured out
[1:31:50] but it was faithful abraham who had been
[1:31:53] given a promise
[1:31:54] hallelujah amen he was all by himself
[1:31:58] amen out there in the heart desert hey
[1:32:01] man and there he is but he's waiting
[1:32:04] upon the promise of god he had been
[1:32:06] waiting for many years
[1:32:09] are you hearing me now
[1:32:10] amen but one morning amen as he was
[1:32:14] sitting out there thinking about the
[1:32:16] promise
[1:32:17] god came showing up
[1:32:20] i said god the one who gave the promise
[1:32:24] came to fulfill his word
[1:32:31] oh come on now
[1:32:33] amen oh maybe hallelujah as we as we
[1:32:35] heard last night
[1:32:37] amen brother ron had said you're going
[1:32:40] to be healed and the girl amen said it's
[1:32:43] been five years but i'm still believing
[1:32:45] for my promise how many in the building
[1:32:48] here today amen is still waiting upon
[1:32:50] your promise he says i'm gonna come i'm
[1:32:53] gonna take you home i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:32:56] bring you to myself you're gonna forever
[1:32:58] be with me there's going to be a
[1:33:01] fulfillment of that promise
[1:33:12] his attitude
[1:33:14] was that of romans 1 21
[1:33:17] because that when they knew god yeah
[1:33:20] they
[1:33:22] glorified him not as god
[1:33:25] neither were thankful
[1:33:27] but became vain and their imaginations
[1:33:29] and their foolish heart was darkened
[1:33:31] professing themselves to be wise
[1:33:34] they become fools
[1:33:36] you see the actions
[1:33:38] are direct results
[1:33:41] of the blindness
[1:33:42] of the age
[1:33:44] now i i want you to just
[1:33:46] hallelujah how many's with me here this
[1:33:48] morning
[1:33:49] you see sodom's actions
[1:33:52] are the results
[1:33:54] of their blindness
[1:33:56] their code in different hearts
[1:33:59] are the results
[1:34:01] of their blindness
[1:34:03] there's no amen there's no there's
[1:34:05] nothing within them to understand the
[1:34:08] promise or the revelation that uh that
[1:34:12] that the world is coming to an end can
[1:34:14] you say amen but there is a people who
[1:34:17] is possessing who is who has possessed a
[1:34:20] promise who is walking with god
[1:34:24] day by day
[1:34:27] hallelujah amen you might not be on the
[1:34:29] who's who you might not be a part of
[1:34:32] amen you know the big program of the
[1:34:34] community but god knows who you are
[1:34:39] oh praise the lord amen you look out
[1:34:42] there in the denominational world
[1:34:44] today just just pick any church you want
[1:34:47] to and you tell me amen where the power
[1:34:49] of god is
[1:34:50] you have you you tell me where the
[1:34:52] overcoming power is you tell me those
[1:34:54] that are that are living above sin amen
[1:34:58] where the word is becoming flesh
[1:35:00] amen can you say amen but you see isaac
[1:35:03] could only come by those amen incredible
[1:35:08] words of god abraham was living by the
[1:35:12] word of promise
[1:35:13] amen he was waiting upon the word of
[1:35:16] promise oh can you say amen
[1:35:19] amen there's nothing to change a lot
[1:35:21] there was nothing i said there was not
[1:35:23] somebody saying nothing there was
[1:35:26] nothing to change lot he meant he had no
[1:35:29] word he had no revelation he had no
[1:35:32] angel appearing he had nothing coming to
[1:35:35] him are you hearing me but there was a
[1:35:38] promise that abraham had
[1:35:41] and he was waiting upon god to fulfill
[1:35:45] his word
[1:35:48] oh hallelujah amen they might have their
[1:35:51] stage shows going amen they might have
[1:35:53] big youth groups even there might be a
[1:35:55] lot of things are going on but i want to
[1:35:58] say word of life
[1:35:59] has been given a promise
[1:36:01] all glory to god you might not be aiming
[1:36:05] much in the world's eyes but god gave
[1:36:08] you a promise and you should rejoice

[1:36:23] is not what god sees

[1:36:33] lots down there amen the mayor there he
[1:36:36] is a judge amen there he is he's he's
[1:36:39] he's highly respected but abraham amen
[1:36:43] was all by himself in the desert but you
[1:36:45] know what god did not know the angel of
[1:36:49] the lord like abraham
[1:36:52] knew
[1:36:53] that angel
[1:36:55] now praise the lord
[1:36:57] amen now the revelation of the son of
[1:36:59] man
[1:37:01] is the only thing
[1:37:03] that is going to produce change
[1:37:07] the son of man and the revealing of his
[1:37:10] word
[1:37:11] is the only thing
[1:37:15] that's going to produce a body change
[1:37:17] now you hear me sons and daughters of
[1:37:19] abraham
[1:37:21] the words of the
[1:37:23] angel

[1:37:28] and your body now y'all hearing me
[1:37:30] hallelujah there's a reason why we

[1:37:37] run all over the building and you kiss

[1:37:41] come in and sit down amen just to come

[1:37:53] and there's no notes being passed amen
[1:37:55] we're being real reverend you there's a
[1:37:57] reason why we do that kids

[1:38:08] regulations amen it's not pastor said

[1:39:29] is because
[1:39:31] she was the shock
[1:39:33] and the plant has died
[1:39:35] but life is still in the sea
[1:39:37] now brother branham said now she is now
[1:39:40] a dry chuck
[1:39:42] he says
[1:39:44] churches of yesterday
[1:39:46] it's past
[1:39:47] the spirit of god passed through her is
[1:39:49] true

[1:40:02] what she's heard can you say man but you
[1:40:05] see she's not part of that elect but
[1:40:08] abraham's seed is not to be caught up
[1:40:13] in the lot
[1:40:14] generation we're not to be caught up
[1:40:18] in the laodicea culture the laodicea
[1:40:21] culture amen is heady high-minded amen
[1:40:25] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:40:27] god
[1:40:28] can you say man amen they are cold and
[1:40:32] formal amen they have a form of
[1:40:34] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:40:37] they say i'm rich
[1:40:39] increase with goods and have need of
[1:40:42] nothing but christ is on the outside of
[1:40:45] that church well you might as well help
[1:40:47] me to preach amen but he didn't stop
[1:40:50] there he says but if there's anybody
[1:40:52] amen that can recognize my presence

[1:40:59] will identify myself my character my
[1:41:04] love my power my majesty i will come to
[1:41:08] that individual and show my power
[1:41:17] how many wants to entertain the presence
[1:41:18] of the lord

[1:41:24] bunch of hype

[1:41:50] listening to a sermon
[1:41:52] and yet their lives aren't changed
[1:41:54] how is it
[1:41:55] it's because somebody
[1:41:57] has got caught up in the culture
[1:42:00] of laodicea
[1:42:02] people's rights
[1:42:04] they're caught up in self-gratification

[1:44:52] get caught up in their culture and we
[1:44:54] fail amen that we are to see that we are
[1:44:57] to be partakers amen
[1:45:00] after coming into his body a partaker of
[1:45:02] his divine nature christ's nature in you
[1:45:06] he says how can you cheat steal and lie
[1:45:09] and backslide and proselyte and
[1:45:12] everything else with the divine nature
[1:45:14] of christ in you it's impossible amen
[1:45:17] let that soak just a few minutes here if
[1:45:20] you be a partaker in christ then you
[1:45:24] become a new creature old things have

[1:49:55] revealing

[1:50:55] times around the world and he was in all
[1:50:58] of the newspapers

[2:03:02] prophet he was a god to the people
[2:03:06] but once it left his mouth
[2:03:09] and entered into the womb of that heart
[2:03:12] then it was no longer in god it was no
[2:03:15] longer in the prophet now it's in the
[2:03:20] [Applause]
[2:03:26] believer i said praise the lord
[2:03:29] now you know why the scripture says

[2:22:58] he's learned how to yield himself
[2:23:00] come on

[2:26:53] and he would start to tell you he wasn't
[2:26:55] telling you of those things of his own
[2:26:57] right
[2:26:59] there was a
[2:27:00] transmitter and a receiver
[2:27:04] and he was simply telling what the voice
[2:27:07] was telling him to say
[2:27:09] he was simply saying what the vision was
[2:27:11] telling with him in front of him oh come

[2:27:31] not the only one with a transmitter
[2:27:35] yes sir the devil's got a transmitter
[2:27:38] and the devil will transmit jealousy and
[2:27:42] hatred and envy and strife
[2:27:45] but god will channel love and joy and
[2:27:50] peace
[2:27:51] and long suffering
[2:27:55] amen can you say man come on
[2:27:58] amen
[2:28:00] this place within your heart
[2:28:02] brother branham says your thoughts ring
[2:28:04] louder
[2:28:06] than your words
[2:28:10] the song says be careful little
[2:28:13] eyes what you see
[2:28:15] yeah awful little eyes what you see
[2:28:18] for the father up above
[2:28:20] is looking in tender love
[2:28:22] be careful little eyes what you see
[2:28:26] recognizing he's here oh yes
[2:28:29] now
[2:28:30] your spirit is actually magnetized to
[2:28:32] that spirit world
[2:28:35] spirits travel on words
[2:28:37] are you still with me
[2:28:39] your eyes and ears are the ushers to the
[2:28:41] soul of the songs and the tep vision and
[2:28:43] the internet and the text people are not
[2:28:46] aware that they're subject to spirits
[2:28:49] hallelujah
[2:28:50] but brother branham's are there in
[2:28:52] ephesians 2 and 2 it says wherein in
[2:28:54] times past you walked according to the
[2:28:55] course of this world according to the
[2:28:56] prince of the power of the
[2:28:58] air the spirit that now worketh in the
[2:29:00] children of disobedience it's a spirit
[2:29:03] that is magnetized to the
[2:29:06] evil why they're in first corinthians 15
[2:29:09] and 33 says be not deceived evil
[2:29:12] communications corrupt good manners
[2:29:16] hallelujah that's why it says in second
[2:29:18] timothy 2 and 16 amen but shun provine
[2:29:22] and vain babblings they will increase
[2:29:25] unto more ungodliness and their word
[2:29:28] will eat as death
[2:29:30] a canker
[2:29:34] and it's because
[2:29:36] we have allowed our hearts
[2:29:39] to be channeled somewhere else
[2:29:42] now i want you to think i'm bringing
[2:29:44] this into home right now yeah
[2:29:47] brother branham talks about a wandering
[2:29:49] thoughts
[2:29:52] wandering thoughts
[2:29:54] takes us from the presence of the lord
[2:29:57] yeah
[2:29:58] come on brother branham says
[2:30:01] the reason they do that is because
[2:30:04] they're not conscious that god is
[2:30:06] watching
[2:30:08] you lose the very thought of god being
[2:30:10] there listening at you
[2:30:12] come on god is putting down everything
[2:30:14] you're thinking about he knows it
[2:30:16] in his recording book your thoughts are
[2:30:18] louder in heaven than your voice is on
[2:30:22] the earth think the right
[2:30:25] thing
[2:30:27] come on now i'm trying to get to that
[2:30:28] this is my best part right here so put
[2:30:31] your neighbor and say wake up
[2:30:34] hallelujah
[2:30:37] now
[2:30:39] you can't see god
[2:30:42] but he is here
[2:30:48] did you know that brother branham says
[2:30:51] there is a difference in the appearing
[2:30:52] of christ and the coming of christ
[2:30:55] he says
[2:30:57] this is my
[2:30:58] ministry to declare him
[2:31:02] that he
[2:31:04] is
[2:31:05] here
[2:31:10] i can't see god
[2:31:12] can you see a court
[2:31:14] all right come on does that mean this
[2:31:16] ain't a microphone does it mean it's not
[2:31:18] working testing one two three it's
[2:31:20] working you can't see the chord
[2:31:22] and you can't see god
[2:31:26] but god is in that other room brother
[2:31:28] branham said he that rather rim he says
[2:31:30] he's known he is he is standing three
[2:31:32] feet from me right now
[2:31:34] you can't see him he's in that other
[2:31:36] dimension oh yeah
[2:31:38] just like you can't you we should
[2:31:40] hallelujah we should not be able to be
[2:31:42] using this microphone right now
[2:31:44] come on yeah can you say amen amen how
[2:31:47] many listens to series
[2:31:49] so that xm
[2:31:50] 65 21x 75.
[2:31:54] now here i listen to it all the way in
[2:31:56] oklahoma i i i used xm65 it's a it's a
[2:32:01] christian station
[2:32:03] for you other unbelievers y'all need to
[2:32:05] switch channels
[2:32:11] so
[2:32:12] i could i drove off into canada as far
[2:32:14] north as i could drive all the way up as
[2:32:17] far north as i could drive all the way
[2:32:19] up to red lake there in in ontario
[2:32:22] and i could steal i could still catch
[2:32:26] them 65.
[2:32:30] amen
[2:32:32] what i'm trying to say is god is here in
[2:32:34] our midst
[2:32:36] brother branham talks about that
[2:32:38] dimension
[2:32:40] he says
[2:32:42] now we don't have any reverence to god
[2:32:47] everybody just thinks he is so secured
[2:32:49] until they don't they're not reverent
[2:32:52] like god
[2:32:53] to god like they should
[2:32:55] why why do they do this
[2:32:58] because they're not conscious of his
[2:33:00] presence
[2:33:02] they're not conscious of his presence
[2:33:05] that's the reason people do that they
[2:33:06] don't recognize it they can't they can't
[2:33:09] comprehend that they're in the presence
[2:33:11] of god
[2:33:12] their minds become so perverted and
[2:33:14] taken up in the things of the world till
[2:33:16] they can't even pay attention to it
[2:33:19] they go to church sure but to realize
[2:33:21] you're in the presence of god not only
[2:33:23] in church wherever you are in the
[2:33:24] presence of god
[2:33:25] if they could do as david i put the lord
[2:33:28] always before my face
[2:33:30] therefore i shall not be moved as long
[2:33:32] as the lord is before him
[2:33:34] he could not
[2:33:35] be moved can you say amen
[2:33:38] brother in another place he says now
[2:33:39] you've got to remember god is watching
[2:33:41] you every hour he watches you when
[2:33:42] you're asleep now the reason i think
[2:33:44] that people do these things is because
[2:33:46] they're not conscious of his presence
[2:33:49] but yet he is there whether you think he
[2:33:52] is or not he sees every look that you
[2:33:55] make every move that you make he knows
[2:33:57] all about it we ought to realize that
[2:34:05] the awareness
[2:34:09] am i making sense
[2:34:12] now
[2:34:15] brother branham says there's three
[2:34:16] things here on earth there's there's
[2:34:18] there's spirits down below the spirits
[2:34:20] of hell have come to earth
[2:34:22] spirits of heaven have come to earth
[2:34:25] and they're here competing
[2:34:28] i wonder in this service here this
[2:34:29] morning
[2:34:32] how many has recognized the presence of
[2:34:34] the lord and also how many has also felt
[2:34:37] the spirit of hell that would
[2:34:39] try to bring in doubt or try to bring in
[2:34:42] a thought or try to bring in something
[2:34:46] did you know that there is a warfare
[2:34:47] going on right now
[2:34:50] did you know it's every service yes
[2:34:52] i want you to hear me now
[2:34:55] did you know that sometimes if we're not
[2:34:57] sensitive to the spirit of the lord
[2:35:00] right when god is moving
[2:35:03] we will miss our miracle right then
[2:35:08] i'm going to give you a few more quotes
[2:35:09] and then i'm closing musicians can come
[2:35:13] hallelujah you love him amen amen
[2:35:17] brother branham says you're bumping into
[2:35:19] him
[2:35:20] you're bumping into him
[2:35:22] amen
[2:35:24] he says if you believe you're in his
[2:35:26] presence
[2:35:28] and that's what's making you feel that
[2:35:30] way
[2:35:31] something's vibrating over your spirit
[2:35:33] that you know you being a christian has
[2:35:36] to be the holy ghost
[2:35:38] or if this audience would only believe
[2:35:40] like you
