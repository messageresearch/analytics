[1:20:13] hearts have been so uplifted Lord and
[1:20:17] God as we stand here behind this sacred
[1:20:19] desk this morning I'm asking the Lord
[1:20:22] that you would anoint me that you would
[1:20:24] give me the words that you would want me
[1:20:26] to say that you would bless this
[1:20:28] congregation
[1:20:30] Lord bless brother Ben and all of the
[1:20:32] laborers Lord who have made this meeting
[1:20:34] so wonderful father we thank you for
[1:20:37] your love now help us today in Jesus
[1:20:40] name we pray can the Church Say Amen
[1:20:43] and amen God bless you you may be
[1:20:47] sick amen I'd like to uh just Minister
[1:20:51] for a little bit this morning placing
[1:20:54] value upon this Rapture now brother uh
[1:20:57] Andrew preached such a wonderful message
[1:20:59] last night on the rapture
[1:21:02] and I wanted to come in this morning and
[1:21:05] maybe Iman uh really uh emphasize the
[1:21:11] value that this Rapture is now not that
[1:21:14] I could make the value the message any
[1:21:16] more valuable not that brother Andrew or
[1:21:19] your pastor could make this message any
[1:21:20] more valuable amen the value is already
[1:21:25] within this message the value is there
[1:21:29] amen but it is US placing the value upon
[1:21:34] this message can you say man uh
[1:21:37] Philippians 3 and 12 this is not as
[1:21:39] though I'd already attained amen uh
[1:21:43] either we're already perfect but I
[1:21:46] follow after that I may apprehend that
[1:21:49] for which I am apprehended of Christ
[1:21:51] amen and he's talking about pressing
[1:21:54] toward the prize for the mark of Christ
[1:21:59] Jesus can you say amen amen there in the
[1:22:02] uh it in the same verses here in the
[1:22:05] Young's literal translation it says not
[1:22:07] that I did already attain or have been
[1:22:10] able uh already been made perfect but I
[1:22:13] pursue if also I may lay hold on that
[1:22:16] for which I was laid hold of by Christ
[1:22:19] Jesus I do not reckon myself to have
[1:22:22] laid hold one thing the things behind me
[1:22:25] indeed forgetting to the things before
[1:22:28] me stretching forth to the Mark I pursue
[1:22:33] or chase for the prize of the High
[1:22:36] Calling of God in Christ Jesus can you
[1:22:39] say amen amen so in order to have amen
[1:22:43] uh in order to reach the goal there's
[1:22:47] got to be a value of the go man there's
[1:22:52] got to be a value you're not going to
[1:22:53] run for the prize unless the prize is
[1:22:56] worthy to you amen can you say Amen
[1:23:00] growing up one of the amen and most
[1:23:03] important thing that any of us to learn
[1:23:05] was the was the ability to place value
[1:23:08] on things amen now when you were a kid
[1:23:12] you were willing a man to give up your
[1:23:14] ten dollar bill for uh amen for one
[1:23:17] dollar bills amen because you didn't
[1:23:20] have the value and you couldn't see the
[1:23:23] value all you could see was one versus
[1:23:26] four but you see the one was a ten
[1:23:29] dollar bill well praise the Lord amen
[1:23:32] and so what we are doing what we have
[1:23:35] got to understand is there is a value
[1:23:39] there is a rapture
[1:23:43] oh man you and you're a kid you'll drop
[1:23:46] your you know you'll you'll Park your
[1:23:48] bike behind the you know the a vehicle
[1:23:51] and they mine and your uh uh uh
[1:23:55] things don't matter much to you because
[1:23:58] the value isn't quite there yet but once
[1:24:02] you begin to get out and work for your
[1:24:04] money and you have to buy that bicycle
[1:24:06] and then you understand the value of
[1:24:10] things amen can you say man and I I want
[1:24:14] to say the value of something is to know
[1:24:16] how to estimate the worth of something
[1:24:18] amen the relative importance of
[1:24:22] something there are specialists in
[1:24:24] certain fields that amen they're trained
[1:24:26] experts they know what they're looking
[1:24:29] at they know what they are looking for
[1:24:31] and they can quickly identify what is
[1:24:35] fake and what is real amen they can
[1:24:37] identify what is of worth and what is
[1:24:41] not of worth can you say man and it took
[1:24:44] a specialist in this last day to come in
[1:24:47] this hour to identify what was worthy
[1:24:51] and what was not worth it can you say
[1:24:55] man amen that's exactly right I I
[1:24:58] remember reading a story when I was a
[1:25:00] kid of a man that had a had an ugly Rock
[1:25:03] field and amen he he had this old field
[1:25:07] he farmed for a long time they're in
[1:25:10] Africa and a mountain but there there
[1:25:12] was a uh you know a thing going around
[1:25:16] diamonds had been discovered and he
[1:25:19] become so intrigued with these diamonds
[1:25:21] on the on the other other side of the
[1:25:24] world and a mountain and and and this is
[1:25:27] a true story he sold his farm he left
[1:25:29] his family to the uh amen the charge of
[1:25:33] his neighbors and he went out to go find
[1:25:36] his wealth amen and he he wandered all
[1:25:38] over the African continent searching
[1:25:41] looking for diamonds every every time he
[1:25:44] got there he was just constantly looking
[1:25:46] amen but this man ended up being a a
[1:25:50] very poor man amen Old Man Poor Man and
[1:25:55] in all of his search he died without
[1:25:58] finding diamonds
[1:26:00] so one day as he uh amen that the guy
[1:26:03] that that had bought his his uh old rock
[1:26:06] Farm amen he he you know he was plicking
[1:26:09] these these old rocks out of the ground
[1:26:11] and and uh uh and bringing him in and
[1:26:14] you know used him as uh you know you're
[1:26:17] stacking them in you know big old piles
[1:26:18] just trying to get rid of him so he can
[1:26:20] Farm the ground and and and he had a
[1:26:23] real pretty rock that he put on top of
[1:26:24] his mantle there and somebody had come
[1:26:26] to visit him one day and and he and he's
[1:26:28] seen the Rock and and the guy happened
[1:26:31] to know what that rock was
[1:26:34] and he looked at it and he says now uh
[1:26:37] I think this rock right here could be a
[1:26:39] diamond and the guy looks at him and
[1:26:41] says Ah no that's just an old rock I got
[1:26:44] a bunch of these rocks they man they're
[1:26:45] I I don't going to those rocks are just
[1:26:47] in the way everywhere Hallelujah he says
[1:26:50] can I take this rock with me and he
[1:26:52] takes the Rock and he has it and he has
[1:26:55] it examined amen and before you know it
[1:26:57] that old rock field ended up being the
[1:27:02] biggest diamond mine in all of the world
[1:27:08] well praise the Lord amen this guy saw
[1:27:12] his own ugly Rock Farm while go
[1:27:18] he was setting on that well glory to God
[1:27:22] there's some of you young people that's
[1:27:24] looking out in the world you can look
[1:27:26] out there what they can give you can
[1:27:28] look out there what they have to offer
[1:27:30] and you go out there looking for
[1:27:32] happiness and you've got it right here
[1:27:35] in the church I say we need to
[1:27:38] understand what with God we need to
[1:27:41] understand the value of what we've got
[1:27:43] [Applause]
[1:27:45] hallelu will praise the Lord amen yes
[1:27:49] sir you've got to know or what you've
[1:27:51] got
[1:27:53] and Jesus as a man who knows what he's
[1:27:57] got
[1:27:59] it and he finds this pearl of great
[1:28:01] price
[1:28:02] he will sell everything else he has
[1:28:06] to buy that pearl of great price
[1:28:11] praise the lord we talk about that third
[1:28:13] pull amen will use it as a cliche we
[1:28:17] begin to use it as a amen as you know
[1:28:19] just another belief but I want to tell
[1:28:22] you that is your ticket to the Rapture
[1:28:26] that is your ticket to an overcoming
[1:28:29] power
[1:28:30] is God's gift to you you need to take
[1:28:33] that thing off of the shelf and put it
[1:28:37] to work in your life
[1:28:39] amen can you say Amen reminds me of
[1:28:42] another story of a coin collector oh
[1:28:45] George Walton he's pretty famous now he
[1:28:48] man but George walking a Walton Way he
[1:28:51] loved collecting rare coins and he
[1:28:53] wasn't really a knowledgeable
[1:28:55] Professional Coin collector but but he
[1:28:58] enjoyed he prized himself in in
[1:29:00] collecting coins and and so uh a
[1:29:03] mountain he was killed in a car wreck
[1:29:05] back in 1962 and his family received his
[1:29:09] his collection of of coins and and so
[1:29:12] they're you know looking through the
[1:29:14] coins and and what he had they they they
[1:29:16] they found that that he had what they
[1:29:19] called a liberty coin it was a it was a
[1:29:22] Liberty Head nickel a man and so these
[1:29:26] Liberty Head nickels they were
[1:29:28] they were made from an 1883 to 1912.
[1:29:33] amen and so and then it was replaced by
[1:29:36] the buffalo nickel and and so they they
[1:29:39] they looked for this and amen they're uh
[1:29:43] you know they weren't supposed to be
[1:29:44] made anymore the Liberty coins but uh
[1:29:47] you know they they there was this guy
[1:29:49] that uh uh a matter of fact the the dies
[1:29:52] were supposed to be destroyed and and
[1:29:54] things but uh uh five years later amen a
[1:29:58] U.S mint employee he he found some old
[1:30:01] dice
[1:30:02] and and he may he may
[1:30:05] five of these Liberty coins
[1:30:07] amen they were double-headed it was a
[1:30:10] double-headed Liberty coin now it was
[1:30:13] shady and a mountain so now these coins
[1:30:16] were in circulation around and it had it
[1:30:19] it was it was amen it had the stamp of
[1:30:22] approval by the governor and yet the
[1:30:25] government did not approve of it and so
[1:30:26] the mint Department said no it never
[1:30:29] happened amen and and But Here There
[1:30:32] were some coins that were out there uh
[1:30:36] in circulation and so uh amount after a
[1:30:40] while amen and Walton had one of these
[1:30:43] in his collection now Walton we went and
[1:30:46] looked around and he he he took it to
[1:30:49] somebody you know and had him to you
[1:30:51] know to uh to see what it was worth and
[1:30:53] the guy said it's worthless you know
[1:30:54] there's nothing to it and so uh uh uh so
[1:30:58] Walton just put it back in his in his
[1:31:00] collection and that collection he had
[1:31:02] that little liberty headed nickel uh a
[1:31:05] double-headed nickel there for for 40
[1:31:07] years
[1:31:08] sitting in his closet sitting in his
[1:31:10] closet Hallelujah uh you know the the
[1:31:13] the the the professional said it's not
[1:31:15] worth anything and so amen but these
[1:31:18] when the family
[1:31:20] received this they begin to check
[1:31:24] Hallelujah
[1:31:28] the hands of the right fella
[1:31:32] and he looked at this thing and he says
[1:31:34] listen there's only five
[1:31:36] of these coins made
[1:31:39] the U.S government claims it's not there
[1:31:41] but it's here
[1:31:44] Hallelujah four have been found
[1:31:48] and you've got the fifth one
[1:31:51] they said well how much is this thing
[1:31:53] worth
[1:31:54] Hallelujah
[1:31:56] they sold that coin for three million
[1:31:58] over three million dollars
[1:32:03] now now this this guy because there was
[1:32:06] some bonehead that didn't know how to
[1:32:11] value that coin he threw that thing in
[1:32:15] the closet as if well it's just a good
[1:32:17] luck charm it's just well praise the
[1:32:19] Lord but it was valuable now I want to
[1:32:24] tell you the world might not understand
[1:32:25] it the world might not want it the world
[1:32:28] might say it's not much of anything but
[1:32:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ has had a
[1:32:35] profit specialist in this day
[1:32:38] and this Prophet has said this Rapture
[1:32:42] is of value
[1:32:45] it's a value we need to put our
[1:32:50] attention upon that value can you say
[1:32:54] amen amen yes what is the value of this
[1:32:59] Rapture to you now I I'm just going to
[1:33:02] preach real simple to you here for a few
[1:33:04] moments amen because Heavenly places
[1:33:07] that was the uh was the place that God
[1:33:10] is ordained the believer Adam walked in
[1:33:13] Heavenly places Adam walked with that
[1:33:16] relationship with God Adam is
[1:33:18] imperfection Adam
[1:33:20] amen and
[1:33:22] upon this
[1:33:24] God a a call for every one of us to come
[1:33:29] back to that place
[1:33:32] can you say amen amen the scripture says
[1:33:36] therein in in Ephesians 1 and 9. it says
[1:33:39] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:33:42] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:33:45] which he has purposed in himself that in
[1:33:48] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:33:50] times he might gather together in one
[1:33:54] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:33:57] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:34:00] him this is the time that God is wanting
[1:34:03] to bring the heavens
[1:34:04] and the Earth back together under their
[1:34:09] leadership and the rulership of man once
[1:34:12] again
[1:34:15] now if we don't place value on that
[1:34:18] we'll put value on our jobs
[1:34:21] we'll put value on sports
[1:34:23] we'll place value on things that really
[1:34:26] have no value but God is telling the
[1:34:29] elect listen I've come in this
[1:34:33] generation to restore you back
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:40] amen restore you back to where you once
[1:34:44] were can you say Amen Adam and Eve knew
[1:34:47] what it was like Jesus knew what it was
[1:34:49] to walk here in this flesh but also knew
[1:34:52] what it was to govern from the heavens
[1:34:54] amen Adam knew how what it was like to
[1:34:57] live in this body and to govern from the
[1:35:00] heavens and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] has been given a third pull the word of
[1:35:07] God to embrace into your soul and to
[1:35:10] produce that Rapture faith
[1:35:13] Hallelujah
[1:35:15] it's no wonder One Thing
[1:35:17] have I desired of the Lord
[1:35:20] and that will I seek after
[1:35:22] there's one thing that I'm I've desired
[1:35:24] there's one there's one thing that I've
[1:35:26] desired of the Lord and that will I seek
[1:35:29] after
[1:35:30] that I may come back did you know that
[1:35:32] that was the that was the same scripture
[1:35:34] that brother Branham used in The Rapture
[1:35:36] message

[1:35:39] have I desired of the Lord
[1:35:41] and that one thing will I seek after
[1:35:45] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:35:49] Lord forever to behold the beauty of the
[1:35:53] Lord to inquire in his Temple can you
[1:35:56] say Amen that word desire is a strong
[1:35:59] feeling of wanting something to long for

[1:40:39] value that he once had but you ever get
[1:40:43] that value back that your desire will be
[1:40:46] his desire your desire will be his love
[1:40:49] oh can you say man I say we got to get
[1:40:53] rid of everything else and get the
[1:40:56] desire back get the passion back get
[1:40:59] everything that he once was
[1:41:03] back to us
[1:41:07] I don't know we don't need a lot of
[1:41:09] marriage counseling what we need to do
[1:41:10] is fall in love again
[1:41:11] what we need well come on Church
[1:41:15] we need somebody to stand up and teach
[1:41:17] us some more stuff what we need is the
[1:41:19] value
[1:41:21] what we've got
[1:41:24] good
[1:41:27] praise the Lord
[1:41:30] see
[1:41:31] I tend to believe
[1:41:34] that what you and the world thinks
[1:41:38] is love
[1:41:40] is really an infatuation
[1:41:43] and there's nothing wrong with
[1:41:44] infatuation
[1:41:46] if you weren't infatuated with her
[1:41:49] well
[1:41:51] you'd have probably never got married
[1:41:55] but they say that the honeymoon
[1:41:59] well glory to God
[1:42:02] the honeymoon will last for about
[1:42:05] six to nine months maybe a year
[1:42:09] but when it hits that year and a half
[1:42:13] Hallelujah you get up and you used to
[1:42:16] seeing her
[1:42:17] she's looked she's used to looking at
[1:42:19] you
[1:42:20] she knows all about you knows all about
[1:42:23] your well praise the Lord
[1:42:26] and what she used to think was funny is
[1:42:28] no longer funny
[1:42:30] and what she used to think was cute or
[1:42:32] now stinking feet
[1:42:34] now we're looking at things a little bit
[1:42:37] differently it was not that was not the
[1:42:40] part of love that was an infatuation
[1:42:42] that that is that that is a little sense
[1:42:44] of feeling love is not an emotion love
[1:42:47] is an act of your will
[1:42:49] can you say man but you can keep the
[1:42:52] fire burning
[1:42:56] you can keep the feeling burning and the
[1:43:00] way you do that amen is is keep falling
[1:43:04] in love amen what you've got to do is is
[1:43:07] to send her some flowers amen what
[1:43:10] you've got to do is to put these things
[1:43:12] in motion and before you know it you are
[1:43:15] keeping your passion alive
[1:43:20] what we need in the church today is more
[1:43:23] passion what we need in the service this
[1:43:27] morning is my passion what we need in
[1:43:31] our homes is more passion for the things
[1:43:34] of God you see when you become
[1:43:36] passionate about the things of God
[1:43:38] that's all you think about when you're
[1:43:40] passionate about the things of God
[1:43:42] that's all you desire when your power
[1:43:44] come on church when you're passionate
[1:43:47] all you want is his presence
[1:43:53] well thank you thank you when you come
[1:43:56] into the church services

[1:44:01] but Mary just ain't enough

[1:44:08] that he's still got it

[1:44:13] to let him know that he's still your
[1:44:14] hunk amen hallelujah I believe God's
[1:44:18] been wanting to let that and you let you
[1:44:20] know that amen God didn't just send a
[1:44:22] prophet he sent him seven times around
[1:44:24] the world Amen God didn't just come amen
[1:44:27] and just did declare but he showed
[1:44:30] himself service after service after
[1:44:32] service what was it it was God showing
[1:44:36] himself off
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:40] it was God declaring himself real
[1:44:44] it was God bragging to his little girl
[1:44:49] can you see man
[1:44:53] brother Branham says now
[1:44:55] Shirley Jehovah has a man that he could
[1:44:57] put his hands upon

[1:53:05] empty yourself you're going to you're

[1:54:25] love him because he chose me well praise
[1:54:28] the Lord if he didn't do the chosen
[1:54:30] choosing then you you wouldn't be the

[1:54:50] it that you've begun and now here you
[1:54:52] are

[1:55:33] renew that passion again I it you know
[1:55:36] they they the the the early church was
[1:55:39] filled with the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 but
[1:55:40] by the time they got to acts 4 they were
[1:55:42] needing a refilling again and they were
[1:55:45] asking for the Lord to reveal him but
[1:55:47] praise the Lord
[1:55:49] I believe it was the shoot of my woman
[1:55:50] who had received the promise of God and
[1:55:53] she had her baby and amen but when but
[1:55:55] one day the baby died and when the baby
[1:55:59] died amen she could have just sit there
[1:56:01] amen and holding the 12 year old boy and
[1:56:04] say ah hey man my promise is dead but
[1:56:07] she didn't do that she didn't do that
[1:56:10] she said that was God's gift to me
[1:56:12] that was God's word to me can you say
[1:56:16] man what did she do she laid the baby on
[1:56:19] the prophet's back went and got her
[1:56:22] servants and said saddle up a donkey
[1:56:24] and take me to the man of God she says
[1:56:27] don't you look to the left don't you
[1:56:28] look to the right don't you look around
[1:56:30] until we get to the man of God he gave
[1:56:33] me that promise and he's going to
[1:56:35] restore that promise
[1:56:37] this is for me
[1:56:41] she had the right value
[1:56:44] are you hearing me she valued what that
[1:56:47] Prophet gave her
[1:56:50] well praise the Lord
[1:56:53] she gets up to the Prophet The Prophet
[1:56:54] says
[1:56:55] it's not well with your husband yep
[1:56:57] oh we're with you yeah
[1:57:00] oh well your boy yeah
[1:57:01] all is well
[1:57:04] Hallelujah
[1:57:06] and then all of a sudden she makes a she
[1:57:09] makes a dive for his feet
[1:57:11] and she's hanging on
[1:57:13] he says if all is well what's going on
[1:57:17] he says you are following me
[1:57:19] back
[1:57:21] we'll praise the Lord
[1:57:23] you remember the promise you gave me
[1:57:24] well let's lay him dead
[1:57:26] you remember the pro I didn't want the
[1:57:28] promise you came to me you asked me I
[1:57:31] said I am fine but you said that I amen
[1:57:35] that you were going to give me this
[1:57:36] promise oh come on Church you didn't
[1:57:39] desire this you didn't have any any hope
[1:57:42] with that but God came to you
[1:57:45] and that desire should be in your heart
[1:57:47] saying I don't care where I'm at I don't
[1:57:49] care how Fallen I feel I don't care how
[1:57:52] how you know how where I'm at my baby
[1:57:57] me that promise if we would start taking
[1:58:01] the words of God like that to our heart
[1:58:03] and say God you gave me this promise I
[1:58:07] can't do it I can't fulfill it you gave
[1:58:10] that promise and I'm looking to you to
[1:58:13] fulfill it
[1:58:18] says amen
[1:58:21] now he says well
[1:58:23] servant I want you to go down there and
[1:58:25] but her faith wasn't in the servant
[1:58:28] her faith was in the prophet
[1:58:30] in the words of God
[1:58:32] and the word brought that restoration
[1:58:34] are you hearing me
[1:58:36] because somebody placed value upon it
[1:58:39] I want you to look here
[1:58:41] I want you to really understand that
[1:58:44] this restoration that God has brought to
[1:58:47] us it's it's it's something that God has
[1:58:50] been longing to do that he's had in his
[1:58:52] plan he's had this for
[1:58:55] eons of time
[1:58:57] this
[1:58:59] stage
[1:59:02] is what God has been looking for
[1:59:05] now
[1:59:07] I think that goal
[1:59:09] is everything it's got to be everything
[1:59:11] to us I
[1:59:13] I want us to
[1:59:15] to think about
[1:59:16] how many's ever seen a
[1:59:19] you go into a maze how many has ever
[1:59:22] been in a corn maze or
[1:59:24] Maze and
[1:59:25] amen it's got all these paths and you're
[1:59:27] trying to find your way out and you're
[1:59:30] do you know the prophet of God says that
[1:59:31] religion has become a lot like one of
[1:59:33] those maze
[1:59:34] they're in the church age book he says
[1:59:36] in short Christendom has become a
[1:59:38] labyrinth or a maze
[1:59:40] he's in the faith has been split into a
[1:59:43] thousand little parts
[1:59:45] anything to get your mind
[1:59:47] our glory to God
[1:59:49] and Satan will come in and he'll bring
[1:59:50] any kind of thing he'll bring trouble
[1:59:52] into the church he'll bring trouble into
[1:59:53] the before you know you got your eyes on
[1:59:55] everything and everything and everything
[1:59:56] and everything and everything and we
[1:59:58] miss what God's doing right now
[2:00:01] oh come on yeah and when you get your
[2:00:03] mind on this and you get your mind on
[2:00:04] that and you get your mind on this and
[2:00:06] you get your mind on that you're missing
[2:00:08] the beauty of the power that God's
[2:00:09] placed within you with this third pool
[2:00:11] Ministry
[2:00:12] and so I think what we've got to do is
[2:00:14] say Lord get me out of this maze that
[2:00:16] I'm in and put me back on the straight
[2:00:18] and narrow so that I can start believing
[2:00:20] your word for exactly what it is his
[2:00:22] word is the truth yeah and he will keep
[2:00:26] his word well praise the Lord
[2:00:29] brother Branham says be simple he said
[2:00:32] just ask don't try to figure it out
[2:00:34] don't try to study it just believe it
[2:00:37] don't mentally figure it out just
[2:00:40] believe it with your soul
[2:00:43] another place he says the first conflict
[2:00:45] that ever come into the world was
[2:00:47] because that somebody was seeking after
[2:00:49] world league wisdom in the stead of a
[2:00:52] simple faith in God he says listen to
[2:00:54] this you say Dr so and so doesn't
[2:00:57] believe it that doesn't change God's
[2:00:59] word a bit remember you're not saved by
[2:01:01] wisdom you are not saved by your
[2:01:03] education you are saved by faith in
[2:01:05] Jesus Christ forget about your education
[2:01:08] and be simple in your own Doctrine so
[2:01:11] our Doctrine should always be I'm not
[2:01:13] looking to that I'm not looking to that
[2:01:15] I am looking to God's word

[2:01:55] simple
[2:01:57] there's only one way and that's Jesus
[2:02:00] Christ
[2:02:02] there's only one formula to be born
[2:02:03] again and that's water blood and spirit
[2:02:06] there's only one formula for baptism and
[2:02:09] that's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:10] Christ
[2:02:11] there's only one way to be a disciple
[2:02:13] and that is to deny yourself pick up

[2:19:49] her politics her systems is just as
[2:19:52] rotten as can be
[2:19:54] there isn't a sound bone inner
[2:19:57] inner World Systems in our politics and
[2:20:00] her religious politics whatever else one
[2:20:03] says I'm a Democrat
[2:20:05] I'm a republican I'm a Methodist I'm
[2:20:07] Baptist the whole thing is rotten to the
[2:20:09] core oh yeah there's got to be something
[2:20:12] give way yeah
[2:20:15] she can't stand if you put a George
[2:20:18] Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in
[2:20:20] every County in this United States
[2:20:23] it still couldn't come back it's beyond
[2:20:26] Redemption
[2:20:27] there's only one thing that can help her
[2:20:31] that's the coming
[2:20:33] creator
[2:20:35] she knows she must give way she's in
[2:20:37] pain and distress one don't know what to
[2:20:40] do one is looking this way one's looking
[2:20:42] that way and everything one is scared of
[2:20:45] the other one trying to do something
[2:20:46] will destroy this one one trying to
[2:20:49] contradict the other one to destroy the
[2:20:51] other
[2:20:52] until now they got it in the hands of
[2:20:54] Simple Man
[2:20:56] who could destroy the whole thing in a
[2:20:58] five minutes
[2:20:59] amen she knows she can't stand the
[2:21:02] people know she can't stand the world
[2:21:05] knows that they're going it's going to
[2:21:07] happen
[2:21:08] God said it was the whole heavens and
[2:21:12] the Earth is going to give going to be
[2:21:14] on fire
[2:21:15] it's going to be a renovation of the
[2:21:17] whole thing so A Whole New World can be
[2:21:20] born
[2:21:21] God
[2:21:22] has prophesied it can you say man
[2:21:27] aren't you glad that you've heard of him
[2:21:29] Rapture message
[2:21:32] as our brother was preaching last night
[2:21:34] oh don't let that just be another
[2:21:36] message
[2:21:39] Hallelujah
[2:21:42] God
[2:21:45] let me place value
[2:21:49] don't let me throw it in there like that
[2:21:50] Liberty nickel
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:59] let me place value
[2:22:00] [Music]
[2:22:02] I'm not just another opinion this is not
[2:22:04] just another organization
[2:22:07] folks when you start looking at this
[2:22:08] message as an organization you're
[2:22:10] missing the point
[2:22:12] this is not another organization
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:16] this is the rapture
[2:22:18] this is awaking us waking us up bringing
[2:22:22] us out of our sleep yeah that's good yes
[2:22:25] sir hearing this
[2:22:26] Shout
[2:22:28] becoming what we hear
[2:22:33] it's quite easy as brother said last
[2:22:34] night the Rapture is quite easy just
[2:22:36] just believe it
[2:22:39] the word
[2:22:41] the word tells you
[2:22:43] you're wrong
[2:22:46] just say I'm wrong
[2:22:49] it's hard folks
[2:22:52] come on
[2:22:54] I know I preached more I I I
[2:22:56] Hallelujah I'm just putting the I'm just
[2:22:58] putting the icing on top of the cake
[2:23:00] here this morning hopefully
[2:23:03] maybe a little bit of mustard
[2:23:07] that really makes it good
[2:23:13] [Music]
[2:23:17] Lord
[2:23:20] from the front to the back lord
[2:23:23] if there's anything that's hidden in me
[2:23:26] did you know the prophet of God said
[2:23:28] that the religious spirit
[2:23:30] is five times horbler
[2:23:33] I'd say that's why you put it five times
[2:23:35] horribler
[2:23:37] and any other spirit
[2:23:40] now this is a man
[2:23:42] this is a prophet it's a truth
[2:23:45] it's a prophet who dealt with such
[2:23:47] stubborn spirits
[2:23:50] he dealt with those epilepsy spirits of
[2:23:53] stubborn spirits he dealt with Spirits
[2:23:56] all the time casting these Devils out
[2:24:00] and then he stands up and says but that
[2:24:02] religious spirit is five times horbler
[2:24:08] than any other spirit
[2:24:11] you know why
[2:24:15] the religious spirit will make you feel
[2:24:16] like you're
[2:24:18] pretty important
[2:24:20] no matter what the Bible says about
[2:24:24] the religious spirit will make you feel
[2:24:25] like you're okay
[2:24:28] the fact
[2:24:31] [Music]
[2:24:34] with Goods
[2:24:36] I am rich I have need of nothing
[2:24:40] that's a religious spirit
[2:24:42] but when Jesus talked he says but I say
[2:24:45] to you
[2:24:47] you're blind
[2:24:48] you're poor you're miserable you're
[2:24:53] wretched
[2:24:55] and you don't know it
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:03] Hallelujah
[2:25:06] that's what's out there
[2:25:09] that's not what's in here
[2:25:11] that spirit is a part of the curse but
[2:25:14] you and I have been given a message to
[2:25:16] wake up
[2:25:17] can you say Amen
[2:25:19] give me passion for this message not to
[2:25:22] defend it no to live it
[2:25:27] not to stand up and make everyone else
[2:25:30] no no
[2:25:32] let this message become it's good my
[2:25:37] life yes sir let it become my attitudes
[2:25:41] let it become everything about me are

[2:25:54] you don't have to know all the ins and
[2:25:56] outs that's not important
[2:25:58] the importance is that it's having
[2:26:01] the Eternal effect
[2:26:03] Upon Our Lives you might not be able to
[2:26:05] quote the quotes you might not be a
[2:26:06] preacher you might might not even be
[2:26:08] able to memorize any of this message
