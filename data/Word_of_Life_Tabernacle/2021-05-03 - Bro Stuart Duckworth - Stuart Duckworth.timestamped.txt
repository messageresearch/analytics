[36:41] verse 1. i just certainly appreciated
[36:44] the word of the lord this morning

[36:49] amen we need that we need that
[36:51] correction i know if if nobody else
[36:53] needed that i needed that
[36:55] and certainly that is required amen
[37:00] verse 1 and behold how good
[37:04] and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[37:07] together in unity
[37:09] it is like the precious ointment upon
[37:11] the head that ran down
[37:13] upon the beard even aaron's beard that
[37:16] went down to the skirts of his garments
[37:19] and as the dew of hermann as the dew
[37:21] that descended upon the mountains of
[37:23] zion
[37:24] for there the lord commanded the
[37:25] blessing even life forevermore
[37:28] i mean you can be seated this afternoon
[37:32] we certainly just love the lord
[37:36] so we see that there is a a blessing
[37:40] amen when brethren can dwell in unity
[37:43] and david said how pleasant it is
[37:46] it is like the precious ointment upon
[37:49] the head all the way down to the
[37:51] garments of aaron the high priest
[37:54] and it is locking to the oil the holy
[37:56] spirit that anoints us
[37:58] as we come together as we come together
[38:01] to go
[38:02] in amen and partake of his blessing
[38:06] amen to be partakers of his blessings of
[38:09] his life
[38:10] amen and to be able to partake you must
[38:13] be anointed to be able to go
[38:15] behind the veil you can't just go in in
[38:18] any certain way
[38:19] amen you got to be dressed right you got
[38:21] to come according to the word you got to
[38:23] come and be anointed
[38:25] amen and not just anointed in but from
[38:27] the head
[38:28] to the feet from the top to the bottom
[38:30] to be able to go in
[38:32] into that presence into that shekinah
[38:34] where we're supposed to live
[38:36] where the blessing is amen into that
[38:38] hidden life that we heard about even
[38:40] this morning
[38:42] amen so you must be anointed to be able
[38:45] to partake of the blessing
[38:46] to partake of the life amen amen as the
[38:50] dews descended upon the mountains of
[38:52] zion there is a blessing even lie
[38:54] forevermore
[38:55] amen and there's a freshness from the
[38:57] anointing the anointing that's available
[38:59] to
[39:00] to you and i there's a freshness from
[39:01] that and there's a freshness from the
[39:04] dew that falls from heaven
[39:07] and then we look at the the oil that ran
[39:10] down
[39:10] aaron's beard from from the head amen
[39:13] through his beard even down to the very
[39:15] hymn of his skirt
[39:18] and brother branham says the anointing
[39:20] oil was made with the rose of sharon
[39:23] and the crushing of the rose brought
[39:24] forth to perfume
[39:26] and they put it on the oil that runs on
[39:29] aaron's beard plum
[39:30] to the hems of his skirt covered all
[39:33] over with the anointing oil
[39:35] amen so the oil was made with the rose
[39:37] of sharon
[39:38] you think about it there are many
[39:40] beautiful flowers like the rose i was
[39:41] talking to allison about this on the way
[39:43] there's many many beautiful flowers like
[39:46] the rose
[39:46] amen but when the rose is crushed and
[39:49] then it brings forth a sweet smelling
[39:51] savor
[39:51] there's something about the rose amen
[39:53] it's beautiful but yet when it's crushed
[39:56] it brings forth even more beauty
[39:59] and so they made the oil amen that
[40:01] anointed aaron with the crushing
[40:03] of that rose amen in this this this
[40:06] evening amen he is the rose of sam
[40:08] amen our lord jesus our great high
[40:10] priest amen
[40:11] aaron being the top amen of the great
[40:13] high priest that would go in
[40:15] that would take the blood before the
[40:16] father amen he was anointed
[40:18] and then he was anointed he was the rose
[40:20] of sharon and then he was anointed
[40:22] amen with the beauty of the lord was
[40:24] there but that beauty had to be crushed
[40:29] that beauty had to be crushed at calvary
[40:31] amen
[40:33] amen and when it was crushed brother
[40:35] burnham said it made that anointing for
[40:38] us and then so it had to be crushed for
[40:40] us to be able to
[40:41] partake of truly what it was it wasn't
[40:44] it wasn't just something beautiful
[40:46] amen but there was a there was a sweet
[40:47] smelling savor and then there was
[40:49] something there
[40:50] i mean there was an anointing
[40:53] even that that rose same in the rose of
[40:56] sharon our lord jesus was crushed at
[40:58] calvary
[40:58] eminent cross is our head amen and he
[41:01] was anointed
[41:02] and crushed at calvary and took his
[41:04] blood amen as the high priest
[41:06] before the father amen so that same
[41:08] anointing
[41:09] that was upon the head of aaron that ran
[41:11] down the same anointing
[41:12] that was on our lord jesus amen has come
[41:15] to the body
[41:16] amen it's the same anointing it's not
[41:18] something separate but it's the same
[41:20] anointing
[41:21] that went from the head all the way to
[41:23] the body amen that's that's what we
[41:25] partake of when we come together
[41:27] amen how pleasant it is for brethren to
[41:29] dwell together in unity it's like the
[41:31] precious ointment

[42:47] preserved him
[42:48] as he went into the presence of god amen
[42:51] in that oil tonight
[42:52] amen has preserved the power of god

[44:02] that shekinah
[44:03] him and to feed amen upon the original
[44:06] manna that fell amen not something that
[44:09] was kept over
[44:10] amen but there amen in the holiest of
[44:12] holies in the shekinah
[44:14] there was that man that kept over amen
[44:16] unto you and i
[44:17] mean it's a type that we can look at but
[44:19] to you and i
[44:20] it's the original holy ghost that failed
[44:22] on the day of pentecost
[44:24] amen we can partake we don't have to go
[44:26] off some
[44:27] other church age but god and this church

[44:33] can partake of
[44:34] and we don't have to live off
[44:35] yesterday's but we can have a freshness
[44:37] today
[44:40] we can have our own amen our own portion
[44:43] of the original
[44:44] amen and then it was death to go in if
[44:47] you weren't if you weren't a high priest
[44:48] but now it's death to not go in
[44:51] you've got to go in amen
[44:55] you've got to go in yourself amen you

[45:21] partake of the same holy ghost

[45:25] they don't have to live off my
[45:26] experience
[45:26] or grandma's experience or grandpa's
[45:28] experience but they can have their own
[45:30] amen because there is an original god
[45:33] has reserved this for his people
[45:37] amen but to partake we must be separated
[45:41] and then shut off from the world amen
[45:43] you've got to you've got to leave it all
[45:44] behind

[45:52] you must shut yourself in amen
[45:56] and brother brahma says here and we just
[46:00] wanted to talk about unity but i thought
[46:01] those things were so good

[46:10] when brethren can dwell together in
[46:11] unity it's locking under that oil we can

[52:20] they come together and been lifting up
[52:23] that same voice lifting up that voice
[52:25] the voice of the lord not

[52:28] voice of god the word
[52:29] to the bride amen and they shall sing
[52:31] together they shall lift that voice up
[52:33] together
[52:38] behold it is i him and he's the one

[52:47] is here
[52:48] amen to show us all things
[52:51] amen to bring things to our remembrance
[52:55] amen for the spirit of truth for it has
[52:58] come to tell us who we are
[53:01] where we came from and where we're going
[53:04] amen that's what the voice of the lord
[53:06] the spirit of truth amen to come and
[53:08] reveal
[53:08] to us what we have need of when we need
[53:11] it he don't just show us everything all
[53:13] at once but as we have need of it
[53:15] he shows us he brings these things to
[53:17] our remembrance as we have need of
[53:20] telling us who we are in the word amen
[53:23] telling us that
[53:24] what we were what we can be amen we love
[53:28] meetings and we love fellowshipping but
[53:30] we must come under
[53:31] this word i'm losing my voice
[53:34] we love those things we love to come
[53:36] together and
[53:37] fellowship with brethren amen but it's
[53:40] for a purpose
[53:41] and then to come under the word to come
[53:43] and lift up the voice
[53:45] amen that god has sent in this day not
[53:46] not not brother branham but the voice of
[53:48] god to lift up the word amen amen to
[53:51] call
[53:51] that this word could be lifted up that
[53:53] the word could be lifted up and draw the
[53:55] bride a power to call her up higher
[53:59] a true ministry of the word of the hours
[54:02] for the perfecting
[54:03] of the saints to edify and to build up
[54:08] not to constantly tear her down not to
[54:11] constantly tear down and beat her over
[54:13] the head
[54:13] but to edify and build up it will make
[54:16] us complete
[54:18] and bring a maturity and if there are
[54:21] things in our life that needs stripped
[54:23] or cut away
[54:24] or shaped the ministry is called to do
[54:26] that
[54:28] amen and god if i'm wrong or if i'm in
[54:31] heir
[54:31] god is obligated to show me that god is
[54:34] obligated to show us what is truth
[54:37] if we are his and we will accept his
[54:39] truth
[54:40] if the spirit of truth is in us and then
[54:43] the faith cometh by hearing
[54:45] excuse me faith cometh by hearing but if
[54:48] you don't ever hear the word you can't
[54:49] never come out of your ear
[54:51] you can't never be stripped you can't
[54:52] never be edified you can't never
[54:54] be perfected you can't come to the
[54:56] maturing amen but faith
[54:58] cometh by hearing hearing of the word of
[55:00] god amen
[55:01] i believe it's high time amen i believe
[55:03] it's it's way past time
[55:05] and then that we ought to put the word
[55:06] in the fourth front of every part of our
[55:08] lives
[55:09] and then we talk about it we talk about
[55:11] it and we've got it
[55:12] in every form that you can think of and
[55:14] then i believe we ought to be listening
[55:16] to the message of the hour and then we
[55:18] ought to be studying we ought to be
[55:20] praying and i'm preaching to myself here
[55:22] more than anybody
[55:23] and then we've got to we've got to guard
[55:25] those what did you talk about this
[55:27] morning
[55:28] we got to fortify those spots we got to
[55:30] fortify those weak spots amen
[55:32] and the only way we can do it the only
[55:34] way we can get closer to god
[55:36] amen is pray amen to get into the word
[55:38] amen come to church
[55:40] sit under the preaching of the word take
[55:42] the correction
[55:43] amen to say yes lord amen that's for me
[55:46] even though i fall short
[55:47] let me come up higher let me let me be
[55:50] different lord let me be what the word
[55:52] says i can be
[55:59] you love the lord
[56:05] so faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[56:08] word of god
[56:10] but if you ain't ever in the presence of
[56:12] the voice how can you hear
[56:14] we're always listening to the wrong
[56:16] voices not always
[56:20] but jesus said let every man's word be a
[56:22] lie and mind be the truth
[56:24] amen that we have received the truth of
[56:25] the hour and then we ought to put it
[56:27] before our ears as much as we can amen
[56:32] amen for we will never reach the
[56:35] potentials of the bride without it
[56:38] amen we will all have to take our stand
[56:41] upon the truth and the word
[56:43] for this hour amen not just our ideas or
[56:46] what we think about the word
[56:48] amen amen but we will have to take a
[56:50] stand upon the truth
[56:51] amen for he is the word and he has come
[56:54] in this
[56:54] hour for for a bride to be clothed
[56:58] amen in the garment of his word if we
[57:00] are truly brethren
[57:02] and non-of different natures we will
[57:03] come together in christ
[57:05] and then we will come together on the
[57:07] basis of him
[57:09] and then to lift that same voice the
[57:11] basis of what his seventh church age
[57:13] messenger has told us the basis
[57:15] of his promise and the revelation for
[57:18] the hour
[57:19] and what the bride is called to be amen
[57:22] if we can't get together on that
[57:23] i i can't walk with you amen these are
[57:26] the things that we've got to get
[57:27] together on amen
[57:28] and how can two walk together unless
[57:30] they be agreed amen amen this
[57:32] this is the goal i mean this this is
[57:34] what this is what we've got to do we've
[57:35] got to come
[57:36] under the word amen to be what god has
[57:39] called us to be
[57:41] come on that basis on that fellowship
[57:43] amen
[57:44] not not who's the greatest not not who
[57:47] can have the best meeting
[57:49] i mean that's not that's not what we're
[57:50] here for
[57:52] remember we can fellowship around the
[57:54] word the revealed word of the hour and
[57:56] what god has called the bride to be amen
[58:00] brother burnham said elect won't
[58:02] persecute
[58:03] elect but the church natural has
[58:06] always persecuted the church spiritual
[58:10] and he says here in the church age books
[58:12] in the latest in church age he said now
[58:14] we can see
[58:15] there were two vines one true and one
[58:17] false
[58:18] and now we can see why abraham had two
[58:20] sons one after the flesh
[58:22] that persecuted isaac and one after the
[58:25] promise
[58:26] and now we can see how that out of the
[58:28] same parents two boys came forth as
[58:30] twins
[58:31] one knowing and loving the things of god
[58:33] and the other knowing much of the same
[58:35] truth
[58:36] but not of the same spirit watch that
[58:38] nod of the same spirit and hence
[58:40] persecuted the child that was elect and
[58:43] god did not reprobate
[58:44] for the sake of reformation he
[58:46] reprobated for the sake of the elect
[58:48] elect cannot persecute elect
[58:50] elect cannot harm elect
[58:53] it is the reprobates that persecute and
[58:55] destroy the elect
[58:57] all those reprobates are religious they
[58:59] are smart they are of the
[59:01] of the cane line the serpent seed they
[59:03] build their battles they build their
[59:04] cities they build their empires
[59:06] all the while calling on god they hate
[59:09] the true seed
[59:10] and they will do all they can even in
[59:11] the name of the lord to destroy god's
[59:14] elect ones
[59:14] but they are needed what is the chapter
[59:17] the wheat no chaff and no wheat but at
[59:19] the end
[59:20] what happens to the chaff it is burned
[59:22] with an unquenchable fire
[59:23] and the wheat where is it it is gathered
[59:26] in this corner
[59:27] it is where he is
[59:32] one two and one false
[59:35] it knows that the flesh the natural will
[59:39] always
[59:40] persecute the spiritual
[59:43] they will try to destroy the elect
[59:48] amen one loving the things of god
[59:51] and the other one knowing much of the
[59:53] truth
[59:54] but not of the same spirit and there has
[59:57] always been that serpent seed line
[59:59] and it will be till the end they will
[1:00:02] try to destroy the elect they are
[1:00:04] kingdom builders
[1:00:05] they put themselves above god and the
[1:00:07] people of god somehow thinking
[1:00:09] they can escape judgment amen but every
[1:00:11] kingdom
[1:00:12] will be shook down every man-made
[1:00:14] kingdom that is built up
[1:00:16] will be shook down and the only thing
[1:00:18] that will be left standing
[1:00:19] is the cry as christ and his bride those
[1:00:22] that are built
[1:00:22] upon the foundation of the word those
[1:00:24] will be the only ones standing
[1:00:28] only christ and his bride will stand the
[1:00:30] true seed will always prevail
[1:00:33] but that that cane line has always been
[1:00:35] there from the beginning
[1:00:36] and it will be to the end
[1:00:40] so they hate the true seed and will do
[1:00:42] all they can to destroy that seed
[1:00:45] amen but when they try to destroy that
[1:00:47] seed it only causes it to be manifest
[1:00:51] and reveal christ in them and they can
[1:00:53] never
[1:00:54] truly destroy god's seed
[1:00:57] amen cain murdered abel because god
[1:01:00] rejected his offering and had respect
[1:01:02] unto cable
[1:01:04] cain brought forth in this wisdom he
[1:01:06] brought forth what he thought would be
[1:01:08] good enough for god
[1:01:10] what would be okay maybe this would just
[1:01:12] be all right amen he brought forth the
[1:01:14] works his works and the beauty thereof
[1:01:16] and satan has always dwelt in beauty
[1:01:19] amen but abel
[1:01:20] abel by revelation was able to see that
[1:01:23] it was
[1:01:24] more than fruit but it was a life that
[1:01:26] god required
[1:01:27] and many required blood from an innocent
[1:01:29] substitute
[1:01:30] that blood would appease god and the
[1:01:32] blood brought back that fellowship
[1:01:34] with god and then so cain murdered his
[1:01:37] half-brother
[1:01:39] amen a true brother won't murder another
[1:01:42] brother
[1:01:43] is that right cain and half brother they
[1:01:47] they were only half brothers we
[1:01:48] understand these things but a true
[1:01:49] brother will not
[1:01:50] murder another brother elect won't
[1:01:54] persecute elect
[1:01:56] elect cannot harm elect amen but the
[1:01:59] true brethren
[1:02:00] amen are in unity i mean we're on unity
[1:02:03] there's love amen
[1:02:04] among the elect
[1:02:07] you think about this seed and then that
[1:02:10] cane lineage
[1:02:11] that serpent seed has always tried to
[1:02:13] destroy the true seed
[1:02:16] and just a little story here from
[1:02:17] brother branham and i'll just kind of go
[1:02:19] through this
[1:02:20] but after calvary when jesus went to
[1:02:22] hell satan said i've got you
[1:02:24] he said i thought i had you when i
[1:02:26] killed abel
[1:02:27] i thought i had you when i killed daniel
[1:02:30] he said i
[1:02:31] surely thought i had you when i killed
[1:02:33] john the baptist and the others
[1:02:35] amen but i've got you now amen satan has
[1:02:38] always looked
[1:02:39] and tried to destroy that seed he said
[1:02:42] he told jesus
[1:02:43] now i've got you and here you are he
[1:02:45] said you're you're in my domain now
[1:02:47] this is my kingdom you're in my power
[1:02:49] and he told jesus that he died
[1:02:51] a sinner that's what satan will always
[1:02:53] try to do
[1:02:54] he'll make you try to make you doubt who
[1:02:56] you are he'll try to
[1:02:57] make you doubt what you've been through
[1:02:59] and what you've become and you've got
[1:03:00] you've become the word
[1:03:02] he'll always try to make you doubt that
[1:03:05] you're in god's will
[1:03:08] amen my brother said i can hear him say
[1:03:09] to satan i am the virgin born
[1:03:12] son of god amen my blood is still wet on
[1:03:14] the cross
[1:03:15] and then take note of that he began to
[1:03:16] tell him who he was
[1:03:18] and then he began to tell him who he was
[1:03:20] in the word what he had done what he had
[1:03:22] accomplished
[1:03:23] he began to he began to preach to satan
[1:03:25] of who he was
[1:03:26] and mary stripped satan of his power and
[1:03:28] there he defeated death hell in the
[1:03:30] grave and took the keys
[1:03:31] and he ascended and emptied out paradise
[1:03:34] of all those
[1:03:35] and then they were in paradise and then
[1:03:36] those that expressed the word
[1:03:38] for their day those are the true seed
[1:03:41] that had stood with god
[1:03:43] and there he set them free
[1:03:48] there he set them free amen
[1:03:52] satan has always tried to destroy that
[1:03:54] line
[1:03:55] i mean he will he will try to destroy
[1:03:57] you and hi
[1:04:00] he'll bring things he'll try to try to
[1:04:02] come at us amen
[1:04:05] and that same power the race him will
[1:04:08] quicken us
[1:04:09] amen they may try on this age to destroy
[1:04:11] the elect
[1:04:12] you know but she's been predestinated to
[1:04:14] victory and then she's
[1:04:16] been predestinated not to fall and then
[1:04:19] satan will try to destroy oh come right
[1:04:20] down to the end
[1:04:21] he'll try to destroy that line and
[1:04:23] remember the pride has been
[1:04:24] predestinated
[1:04:26] she's been predestinated to victory
[1:04:27] she's been predestinated to rise above
[1:04:30] this layout of cnh she's been producing
[1:04:33] a man back to the word and then back to
[1:04:35] the fullness of the word
[1:04:36] she won't be destroyed she will overcome
[1:04:41] i've always loved this quote brother
[1:04:43] branham said what
[1:04:44] and what was the holy ghost given for he
[1:04:46] said in the same holy spirit that saved
[1:04:48] the lutherans
[1:04:50] sanctified the wesleyans the that
[1:04:52] baptized the pentecostals is setting an
[1:04:54] order the coming of the lord and then
[1:04:56] when it will be so powerful that body
[1:04:58] will come
[1:04:58] into this group a church that will draw
[1:05:00] the rest of them from the grave amen
[1:05:02] just as jesus
[1:05:03] amen just as he descended and then he
[1:05:06] ascended and then he brought forth those
[1:05:08] of the past ages amen and when we
[1:05:10] when that power comes into this group
[1:05:12] amen not a group
[1:05:13] far off into the future but this group
[1:05:15] you and i when that
[1:05:16] when that fullness of that power comes
[1:05:18] in this group it'll draw the rest of
[1:05:20] them from the grave
[1:05:21] amen there will be a resurrection that's
[1:05:23] what the holy ghost was given for amen
[1:05:25] they without us
[1:05:26] cannot be made perfect even your
[1:05:30] brothers
[1:05:31] that have went on are depending on you
[1:05:33] and what about your brothers and sisters
[1:05:35] now we're we're
[1:05:36] we we need each other even those that
[1:05:38] have gone on are depending on us i'm i'm
[1:05:40] depending upon you and i you're
[1:05:41] depending upon me
[1:05:47] amen we must be united in him
[1:05:54] and he goes on to say oh elect of god
[1:05:56] beware study closely
[1:05:58] be careful work out your salvation with
[1:06:01] fear trembling rely upon god and be
[1:06:03] strong in his mind
[1:06:05] but your adversary the devil is even now
[1:06:07] going about like a roaring lion
[1:06:08] seeking whom he may devour watch unto
[1:06:11] prayer and be steadfast this is the end
[1:06:13] time
[1:06:14] both the true and false vines are coming
[1:06:16] to maturity
[1:06:17] but before the week matures those rap
[1:06:19] and terrors must be bound for the
[1:06:20] burning
[1:06:21] see they are all joining the world
[1:06:23] council of churches that is binding
[1:06:26] but soon the garnering of the wheat will
[1:06:28] come but right now the two spirits are
[1:06:30] are at work in the two vines come out
[1:06:32] from among the tares
[1:06:34] start to overcome that you may be
[1:06:35] considered praiseworthy for your lord
[1:06:38] and fit to reign and rule with him
[1:06:40] mr brother broom said what is the chaft
[1:06:42] to the wheat
[1:06:43] he said no chaff and no wheat and then
[1:06:46] the evil day in the spirit of the day
[1:06:48] is a testament of the true seed the
[1:06:51] elect being present
[1:06:52] and coming to maturity because of the
[1:06:54] evil
[1:06:55] amen it testifies it's a testament
[1:06:58] that we are here the evil of the day
[1:07:02] and how prevalent it becomes it's a
[1:07:04] testament of the true light of the true
[1:07:06] seed
[1:07:06] that is here now that is coming that is
[1:07:09] present that is coming to maturity
[1:07:11] but in the end the tears are bound
[1:07:13] together for the burning
[1:07:14] this is the binding all joining up and
[1:07:17] uniting together to make an image
[1:07:19] under the beast because that's the
[1:07:21] spirit of the day
[1:07:22] the uniting it's a uniting time brother
[1:07:25] and said that's the spirit of the day
[1:07:26] they're uniting together to make an
[1:07:28] image under that beast
[1:07:30] he said here in uniting time and time he
[1:07:33] said uniting together now trying to
[1:07:35] destroy the message
[1:07:36] how do they destroy it how could you
[1:07:38] they destroy the word of god they make
[1:07:40] it of none
[1:07:41] effect none affected by their traditions
[1:07:43] as they did back there
[1:07:45] they're in the beginning and making the
[1:07:46] word of god a known effect
[1:07:49] let me catch my breath here so we see
[1:07:52] that spirit
[1:07:54] uniting against the word uniting against
[1:07:58] what we believe to try to make it of
[1:08:01] none effect
[1:08:03] ever seeming so religious they'll take
[1:08:07] part of the word without the power
[1:08:09] without the effectiveness of it
[1:08:11] and thereby destroy and deceive
[1:08:15] amen but you and i have been called amen
[1:08:17] to take the word
[1:08:19] in its effectiveness and to project the
[1:08:21] word in its effectiveness
[1:08:22] amen that is power that it is spirit
[1:08:25] imagine that it is able to deliver those
[1:08:27] that are bound
[1:08:28] and under the disabled amen to rapture
[1:08:30] the church amen that's what i preached
[1:08:32] that's what brother ben preaches
[1:08:33] we've got what we need and then what god
[1:08:35] has given us it's able to rapture church
[1:08:38] it's able to change your body and then
[1:08:39] it's able to change amen from glory to
[1:08:42] glory
[1:08:42] it's able to make a sinner a saint it's
[1:08:45] able to make a sinner a son of god
[1:08:47] a daughter of god and we are living
[1:08:50] proof of that
[1:08:52] to a dying and dark world amen
[1:08:58] so they try to destroy it by making the
[1:09:00] word of no effect of the people by their
[1:09:01] traditions by what they think the
[1:09:03] message is
[1:09:04] by their own ideas and their own
[1:09:06] traditions
[1:09:08] instead of taking the full open revealed
[1:09:10] word amen they just take their little
[1:09:11] portion
[1:09:12] their little doctrine and they count
[1:09:13] down upon that
[1:09:16] amen and but by that which has no power
[1:09:19] and actually
[1:09:20] actually can change a life amen just
[1:09:23] preaching a doctrine
[1:09:24] it can't change anybody it ain't never
[1:09:26] changed nobody
[1:09:27] we need doctrine we need to hear these
[1:09:29] things and but this is
[1:09:31] simply having a teaching is something
[1:09:33] that you count down will never change
[1:09:35] nobody
[1:09:36] but they've got to have the gospel
[1:09:37] preached to them they've got to have the
[1:09:39] good news
[1:09:40] and then jesus christ is alive and well
[1:09:42] then he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:44] forever
[1:09:46] i'll try to hurry up here
[1:09:50] amen but they're they're being united
[1:09:52] together amen for the burning
[1:09:54] amen and that uniting brother burns said
[1:09:56] we'll be be burned with an unquenchable
[1:09:59] fire and the wheat where is it
[1:10:03] what about the the wheat the true seed
[1:10:05] it is gathered together
[1:10:07] in his garner it is where he is
[1:10:11] gathered to him and then gather together
[1:10:15] amen they're uniting the religious world
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:20] church natural they're uniting to be
[1:10:22] burned but we are uniting together to go
[1:10:25] into his garner to go where he is
[1:10:28] and i'll just read this last little bit
[1:10:30] of this quote here
[1:10:32] i don't have much left anyways can i
[1:10:34] finish it
[1:10:37] i'll read this god is uniting his bride
[1:10:39] she is coming together
[1:10:41] from the east and the west and the north

[1:11:16] word was with god and the word was god

[1:11:21] church and the bride and the word is

[1:11:25] working out
[1:11:27] the works of the bridegroom they're
[1:11:30] becoming so one

[1:29:39] that he should depart out of this world
[1:29:41] unto the father having loved his own
[1:29:42] which were in the world he loved them
[1:29:44] until the end

[1:29:52] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:29:54] all things into his hands and that he
[1:29:55] was come from god and went to god
[1:29:57] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:29:59] garments and took a towel
[1:30:01] think about that the god of heaven
[1:30:05] got down in front of his disciples and
[1:30:07] did the dirtiest job he could do
[1:30:09] because he loved him he says he loved
[1:30:12] him to the end

[1:30:15] to do it for one another then right

[1:30:19] aside his garments took a towel and
[1:30:21] girded himself after that

[1:30:34] thou knowest not now but thou shalt know
[1:30:36] hereafter
