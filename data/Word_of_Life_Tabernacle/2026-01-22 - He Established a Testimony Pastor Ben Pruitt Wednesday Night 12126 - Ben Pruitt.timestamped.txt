[17:26] a little bit. I've been changed. Key of
[17:29] G.
[17:34] I've been to the water and I've been
[17:38] baptized. I've been washed in the blood
[17:42] of the lamb.

[17:48] I once was and redeemed is now my name.
[17:56] Oh, I've been changed
[17:58] and I've been reborn now. All my life

[18:15] God has been changed.
[18:18] Though my sins were as scarlet, they're
[18:22] white as snow. I was bound, but today I
[18:27] am free.
[18:29] I was lost in the darkness, but now I'm
[18:34] found. I was blind, but now I see.
[18:40] Oh, I've been changed.

[19:49] Amen. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[19:50] praise.
[19:52] I've been trying to think of the name of
[19:54] it, but I want to add it in. I think
[19:55] it's I saw the light.
[19:58] Do you have that, Brother Robert?
[20:04] We got the backups back up tonight. So,
[20:06] we're just going to move around a little
[20:07] bit.
[20:10] I wonder so aimless life filled with
[20:14] sin.
[20:16] I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[20:22] Then Jesus came like a stranger in the
[20:26] night.
[20:27] Praise the Lord. I saw the light.
[20:33] I saw the light.
[20:36] I saw the light.
[20:38] No more in darkness.
[20:41] No more in night.
[20:44] Now I'm so happy. No sorrow in sight.
[20:50] Praise the Lord. I saw the light.
[20:55] Just like the blind man I wondered
[20:59] alone.
[21:01] Worries and fears I claimed for my own.
[21:06] Then like the blind man that God gave
[21:10] back his sight.
[21:12] Praise the Lord.
[21:15] I saw the light. Oh, I saw the light.
[21:21] I saw the light.
[21:23] No more in darkness.
[21:26] No more in night.
[21:29] Now I'm so happy. No sorrow in sight.
[21:34] Praise the Lord. I saw last verse.
[21:40] I was a fool to wander and stray.
[21:46] Straight is the gate and narrow the way.
[21:51] Now I have traded the wrong for the
[21:56] right.
[21:57] Praise the Lord.
[22:00] I saw the light.
[22:03] I saw the light.
[22:05] I saw the light.
[22:08] No more in darkness,
[22:11] no more in light.
[22:14] Now I'm so happy, no sorrow inside.
[22:19] Praise the Lord once again as the ushers
[22:23] come. Oh, I saw the light.
[22:28] I saw the light.
[22:31] No more in darkness.
[22:33] No more in light.
[22:36] Now I'm so happy. No sorrow inside.

[22:53] evening. Amen. Maybe if you just want to
[22:55] play something softly. We've only got um
[22:59] one written request tonight. Um, it
[23:02] says, "Please pray for Becky's foster
[23:04] baby, Maya. She's home and has the flu."
[23:08] So, just be praying for that. That's
[23:10] from Sister Britney. Um, I know there's
[23:12] a lot of sickness going around. So, just
[23:15] be praying for all those that are out
[23:16] and sick this evening. Amen. If you have
[23:18] an unspoken request, if you want to make
[23:20] it known by the lifting of your hand,
[23:22] ask our brother Caleb to take these
[23:24] needs for us tonight.
[23:27] Father, we thank you, Lord, for your
[23:29] mercy, your grace, Father, your presence
[23:30] in our lives. We're just so grateful for
[23:32] it. Lord, we just ask you to just feed

[24:02] tonight?
[24:11] Singing praise to
[24:15] that man
[24:17] who died on Mount Calvary.
[24:23] A little man made it possible
[24:29] that I could

[24:35] Oh,
[24:36] I love
[24:40] that man
[24:42] in the middle.
[24:48] Because I know that he first loved me.
[24:58] We're singing praise to
[25:02] that man
[25:04] who died on Mount Calvary.
[25:10] But no man
[25:12] made it possible

[25:51] who died on Mount Calvary.
[25:57] The little man made it possible
[26:02] that I could
[26:05] go free.

[26:12] for you tonight? You must sing that
[26:15] song. There's nothing like the present.
[26:17] Yes. Thank you.

[29:04] in his presence.
[29:51] Lord,
[29:53] I thirst for you.
[29:58] There is no
[30:00] one else
[30:02] who satisfies
[30:06] my soul.
[30:10] He longs for you
[30:14] like the deer
[30:17] panting for the water.
[30:24] Now
[30:26] I'll wait for you.
[30:31] Take me to
[30:33] your courts
[30:35] of glory
[30:39] and fall

[35:26] evening? Amen. I know how hard it is to
[35:29] be called on and you don't have anything
[35:31] ready. So, we really appreciate that.
[35:33] It's a It's a service. Amen. Let's try
[35:36] this. We practiced this a few weeks ago
[35:38] or maybe more. Let's try to learn this
[35:40] little chorus. It's No weapon formed
[35:42] against you shall prosper. It's a real
[35:45] easy course. So, let's let's try to sing
[35:47] this. No weapon
[35:50] formed
[35:52] against me
[35:56] shall prosper.
[36:00] It don't want to work. Say, "No weapon
[36:05] formed
[36:07] against me
[36:10] shall prosper.
[36:14] It won't work." Say, "No weapon
[36:20] horned
[36:21] against me
[36:24] shall prosper.
[36:28] It won't work. Say, "No weapon
[36:33] formed
[36:35] against me
[36:38] shall prosper.
[36:42] It won't work once again. No weapon
[36:47] formed
[36:49] against me
[36:52] shall prosper.
[36:56] It don't want to work. Say, "No weapon
[37:02] formed
[37:03] against me
[37:06] shall prosper.
[37:10] It won't work."
[37:16] I think we did okay. I think there the
[37:18] tempo was off there. I couldn't hardly
[37:20] breathe. So, amen. Amen. Let's sing this
[37:23] song just before we ask for the bin to
[37:25] come out. We'll sing this one and then
[37:26] one more. I need thee. Oh, I need thee.

[39:06] him again.
[39:09] Oh, I need
[39:13] thee. Oh,

[39:48] to
[39:51] thee.
[39:55] Amen. Let's just all stand together as
[39:57] we prepare to change over the order of
[39:59] the service.
[40:01] Let's see. Can we sing that song? Where
[40:03] he leads me, I will follow QF.

[42:02] me. I
[42:06] will follow.
[42:09] Can you say that tonight? Tell him about
[42:11] it. Where you lead
[42:17] me out,

[44:05] Heavenly Father, we're so privileged to
[44:08] be your people here tonight and to know,
[44:11] Lord, what we know that we are your
[44:13] children. We thank you for that,
[44:15] God. We thank you for grace and glory
[44:17] along the way. And Lord, we're
[44:20] undeserving of it, Father. But you
[44:22] reached down your hand for us and
[44:25] brought us out of the deep miry clay to
[44:27] be where we're where we are and to
[44:30] experience the blessing of being your
[44:32] children. And I thank you for that,
[44:34] Lord. I Lord, we surrender ourselves to
[44:36] your leadership, to your will, and to
[44:38] your way. I pray that you'd lead me by
[44:41] your word tonight. Lead these people,
[44:43] Lord. We'll give you all the praise and
[44:45] the glory and the honor. I pray if
[44:46] there's anyone sick tonight or that's
[44:49] watching or here, I pray that you'd heal
[44:52] them. I pray that you'd touch every
[44:54] heart. We pray tonight in Jesus name.

[45:10] today? 41. Is that right? Yeah. 41.
[45:14] God bless brother Harold.
[45:17] That's uh 41 the second time I think for
[45:20] brother Herald. But we sure appreciate
[45:22] Brother Herald. He you know he makes so
[45:24] much noise that we don't have to say
[45:25] much about him. But but we uh we sure
[45:28] appreciate Brother Herald and and that
[45:30] steady u steady faithfulness that he has
[45:34] in serving the Lord. And that says a
[45:37] lot. I appreciate all of you. I saw
[45:38] Sister Sander tonight and some of you
[45:40] elders are here on a on a cold Wednesday
[45:42] night. and I appreciate you being here.
[45:44] It means the world to me and and uh
[45:47] it'll inspire our young people and their
[45:50] faithfulness as well. We've got some bad
[45:52] weather coming in. You can go ahead and
[45:53] turn to Psalms chapter 78 and verse one.
[45:56] Psalms chapter 78:es 1 through um 1-8.
[46:02] We've got some bad weather coming in or
[46:03] so they say. I don't I'm not convinced
[46:05] that the weather people know entirely
[46:07] what they're talking about, but uh they
[46:09] say we've got some bad weather coming
[46:11] in. So, we're going to try to uh uh let
[46:14] you know Saturday morning probably if
[46:16] that comes in. Of course, we won't be
[46:18] able to have church like what they say,
[46:20] but there's a chance they could be
[46:21] wrong. So, they they are not infallible.
[46:24] So, we we'll let you know. We'll try to
[46:25] let you know Saturday morning. If
[46:26] there's snow on the ground, make sure
[46:28] you call before you come or if we're not
[46:31] having church, that would be on you.
[46:33] But, you can go ahead and worship by
[46:34] yourself if you can make it. But uh
[46:37] hopefully it'll all pass south of us or
[46:40] north of us or some way or another be
[46:43] able to have church. Psalms chapter 78
[46:45] verse one. Give ear oh my people to my
[46:48] law. Incline your ears to the words of
[46:50] my mouth. He said I will open my mouth
[46:53] in a parable. I will utter dark sayings
[46:56] of old which we have heard and known and
[46:59] our fathers have told us. We will not
[47:02] hide them from their children. showing
[47:05] to the generation to come the praises of
[47:09] the Lord and his strength and his
[47:11] wonderful works that he hath done. For
[47:14] he established a testimony in Jacob. And
[47:18] he appointed a law in Israel which he
[47:20] commanded our fathers that they should
[47:22] make them known to their children, that
[47:25] the generation to come might know them,
[47:28] even the children which should be born,
[47:31] who should arise and declare them to
[47:33] their children. If you go through that,
[47:35] you find he's talking about five
[47:37] generations of children. He said that
[47:40] they might set their hope in God and not
[47:43] forget the works of God, but keep his
[47:47] commandments and might not be as their
[47:50] fathers. A stubborn and rebellious
[47:52] generation, a generation that set not
[47:55] their heart a right, whose spirit was
[47:57] not steadfast with God. You may be
[48:00] seated. uh Lord add his blessing to the
[48:03] reading of the word. As if you read on
[48:05] in Psalms chapter 78, David continues
[48:08] then to begin to testify of the
[48:11] wonderful things that God has done. I
[48:13] want to take for a text tonight that
[48:14] verse 5, for he established a testimony
[48:18] in Jacob. A testimony in Jacob. A
[48:22] testimony is a powerful thing. It's uh
[48:25] it's uh something that can make a
[48:28] difference in people's lives. We saw
[48:30] that Sunday night. I appreciated brother
[48:32] Josh uh giving his testimony and like he
[48:35] did because it meant a lot to us uh to
[48:38] see somebody that had gone through that
[48:40] and uh and was actually uh come out on
[48:44] the other side and it gives you a little
[48:45] bit of hope for yourself and for your
[48:47] children and and for the people that
[48:49] we're praying for and and we appreciate
[48:52] brother Josh doing that but it got me
[48:53] thinking about the power of a testimony
[48:55] and what that means and I got to reading
[48:58] about testimonies in the scripture
[49:01] And we find that a testimony. The people
[49:03] always went back to give a testimony.
[49:05] Jacob went back to Bethl. You find him
[49:08] going back there time after time because
[49:11] that was the place of his testimony. I'm
[49:13] a little loud, I think, on my mic. I
[49:16] feel like I'm I'm screaming at everybody
[49:18] here. Uh but uh Jacob kept going back to
[49:21] Bethl and and and it was there that God
[49:24] met him and he had a vision of a ladder
[49:26] that reached up into heaven and he knew
[49:29] that something real had happened to him.
[49:30] And so I I believe we can have places
[49:33] like that where we knew that something
[49:35] real happened to us that the hand of God
[49:38] touched us. I believe all of us need
[49:40] those times and those places in our
[49:42] lives. you will find Paul, brother
[49:44] Brandon said whenever he got in a tight
[49:45] spot, he uh began to testify about his
[49:48] Damascus experience and how that that
[49:51] God met with him there on the road and
[49:54] and and it was it was comforting to him.
[49:56] It was something he could go back to. He
[49:58] says, "I know that God called me. I know
[50:01] that God made me what I am." How many
[50:03] have ever had an experience like that?
[50:04] You say, "I know that God brought me
[50:07] out. I know that I I'm going to make it
[50:09] because I know what he did for me in the
[50:11] past, he can do for me again. And and if
[50:14] he supernaturally made me what I am
[50:16] today, he can supernaturally carry me
[50:19] forward. A testimony is simply a witness
[50:22] to what God has done. We've talked about
[50:24] that before, but I want to go a little
[50:26] bit different direction with it tonight.
[50:28] There's a difference in philosophy and
[50:30] revelation, right? There's a difference
[50:33] in having a a theory about something.
[50:35] Even in science there's a difference in
[50:37] theory and observation. We know that
[50:40] that the the theory of atomic the atomic
[50:43] bomb was just a theory until an atomic
[50:46] bomb was made and and once it was
[50:49] detonated that theory become a reality.
[50:51] In fact the one they dropped on
[50:53] Hiroshima they had never even tested
[50:56] that one. They had tested the other one
[50:58] but they didn't even test the one that
[50:59] they dropped. But as soon as that
[51:01] mushroom cloud came up, they realized
[51:03] that what they had predicted actually
[51:06] come to pass maybe even more than what
[51:08] they had predicted. So the testimony is
[51:12] the reality
[51:14] to the word of God. We know that faith
[51:16] in the written word of God actually
[51:18] activates the Holy Spirit to manifest
[51:22] that word and give us a testimony. So
[51:25] first of all, you got to have faith in
[51:26] the word. You got to believe the word
[51:28] even before the testimony is there. If
[51:31] you're ever going to have a testimony,
[51:33] you've got to have faith in the word.
[51:34] You got to believe that the word's going
[51:36] to going to do what it says it's going
[51:38] to do. And then once you believe that
[51:40] word, even simple faith in the word of
[51:42] God actually produces a testimony, which
[51:46] we then tell our children, we tell our
[51:48] grandchildren, we inspire them. And what
[51:51] what are they inspired to do? They're
[51:53] inspired to read that same word and then
[51:55] to achieve a testimony for themselves to
[51:59] activate the Holy Spirit in their lives.
[52:01] See, he we're not waiting on him. He's
[52:03] waiting on us. He's waiting on us to
[52:06] believe because he can only act on what
[52:08] we believe.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; So, our testimony then points to uh
[52:15] points to the fact that that there's
[52:17] something has happened and something
[52:19] happened. And if you had the faith to
[52:20] believe, that points to your election.
[52:23] That points to the fact that God chose
[52:25] you. If you have the faith to believe,
[52:27] it means that you were foreord ordained
[52:29] to faith from the foundation of the
[52:32] world. I'm so glad for that today. So
[52:34] the faith to believe points to election.
[52:36] And in 1 Thessalonians 1:4 says,
[52:38] "Knowing, brethren, beloved, your
[52:40] election of God. For our gospel came not
[52:42] unto you in word only, but also in power
[52:45] in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance
[52:48] as you knew know what manner of men we
[52:50] were among you for your sake." Right?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; You become followers of us and of the
[52:55] Lord, having received the word in much
[52:57] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost,
[53:00] so that you are examples to all that
[53:02] believe in Macedonia and Akaya. For from
[53:05] you sounded out the word of the Lord. He
[53:07] said, not only in Macedonia and Aaya,
[53:09] but also in every place. Your faith to
[53:11] God word is spread abroad so that we
[53:14] need not to speak anything. I think
[53:16] that's the kind of church we want here
[53:17] at Word of Life Tabernacle. We want a
[53:19] people whose lives speak so loud, whose
[53:22] testimony is so great that the preachers
[53:24] don't even have to preach.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? In other words, we
[53:29] don't have to tell, well, these are the
[53:30] bride. This is the bride. This is the
[53:32] people of God. BUT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW
[53:34] this is Christians. These are these are
[53:36] Christians. There's something HAPPENED
[53:37] TO THEM EVEN BEFORE THEY hear the
[53:39] preaching of the word.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "For they themselves show of us
[53:43] what manner of entering in we had unto
[53:45] you and how you turned to God from idols
[53:48] to serve the living and true God and to
[53:49] wait for his son from heaven whom he
[53:51] raised from the dead, even Jesus which
[53:53] delivered us from the wrath to come." So
[53:56] he said, "Your your life is a
[53:58] testimony."
[53:59] Paul when he told his testimony, what
[54:02] what happened? He told it to them and
[54:05] they believed it and then they got a
[54:07] testimony.
[54:09] None of them could be Paul. And I want
[54:11] us to understand that as we talk about
[54:13] testimony, especially for our young
[54:14] people, we want you to understand that
[54:17] not everybody's testimony is going to be
[54:18] the same.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; But not everybody had to go through what
[54:21] Paul went through.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Not in fact, I don't know that that ever
[54:25] happened again.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Right? What happened to Paul only
[54:28] happened one time. I wasn't on a horse
[54:31] when I received the Holy Ghost. Right? I
[54:34] when he got my attention, it wasn't a
[54:36] physical light that shone down. I didn't
[54:38] get knocked off of a horse. I I wasn't
[54:40] on the road to Damascus to persecute
[54:42] Christians. But the same God THAT MET
[54:45] HIM THAT DAY IS THE SAME GOD THAT MET ME
[54:48] IN a basement room one day. The same God
[54:50] that met you IN WEST AFRICA. THE SAME
[54:52] GOD THAT MET YOU WHEREVER IT WAS THAT
[54:54] YOU WERE SAVED. THAT SAME GOD, HE'S
[54:57] STILL THE SAME GOD TONIGHT. HOW MANY
[54:58] believe that even on a WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
[55:00] AND YOUR TESTIMONY INSPIRES MY
[55:02] TESTIMONY.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; SO, WE TELL OUR TESTIMONY SO THAT OTHERS
[55:08] MIGHT receive their own testimony.
[55:12] In the psalm that we read, Psalm 78, the
[55:15] the singer Asaf is the one who wrote
[55:17] that song. And he tells them, he says,
[55:19] "We're going to testify how God
[55:22] delivered us from our stubbornness.
[55:25] We talked about stubbornness here a
[55:27] while back, but we're going to testify
[55:29] about how God delivered us from our
[55:31] stubbornness. How he established our
[55:33] testimony so we can have our own so each
[55:38] generation can have their own testimony
[55:40] down to the fifth generation. So, we're
[55:43] going to tell about it. So, we're not
[55:44] going to hide from our children what God
[55:47] did for us. I wonder how many of us
[55:49] could say amen to that today. not going
[55:51] to hide from my children what I've been
[55:53] through because my life IS A TESTIMONY.
[55:56] THE FACT THAT I'M HERE today is A
[55:57] TESTIMONY OF WHAT GOD'S DONE. IT'S NOT A
[56:00] TESTIMONY for the devil to say that I've
[56:02] I've I've had done some things THAT WERE
[56:04] WRONG, BUT IT'S A TESTIMONY FOR GOD. I
[56:07] DON'T DO THOSE THINGS ANYMORE.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:12] You know, God will actually use things
[56:17] in your life, problems, afflictions,
[56:20] even the stubbornness of others,
[56:23] and the hardness of people's hearts
[56:26] &gt;&gt; to produce a testimony in your life.
[56:29] That's
[56:29] &gt;&gt; right.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; He He used the stubbornness of Pharaoh
[56:34] to establish a testimony in Israel.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:39] So the Lord said to Moses, Exodus 4:21,
[56:42] the Lord said to Moses, "When thou goest
[56:43] to return into Egypt, see that thou do
[56:45] all those wonders before Pharaoh, which
[56:47] I have put in thine hand, but I will
[56:49] harden his heart that he shall not let
[56:52] the people go." Now, that's interesting,
[56:54] isn't it? He didn't say, "I'll leave it
[56:55] up to Pharaoh." He said, "I'm going to I
[56:58] I created Pharaoh for a purpose. I'm
[57:01] going to harden his heart." And and
[57:04] you'll find in the scripture that 11
[57:06] times Pharaoh's heart was hardened.
[57:10] EVERY TIME THAT GOD SENT A PLAGUE on the
[57:13] children of or on the Egyptians, Pharaoh
[57:16] nearly repented or nearly let him GO AND
[57:19] THEN GOD HARDENED HIS HEART. AND FINALLY
[57:22] HE DID LET HIM GO AND GOD HARDENED HIS
[57:24] HEART AGAIN. THEY FINALLY GET out of
[57:27] there and God hardened Pharaoh's heart
[57:29] again. Why? So a testimony could be
[57:32] established. So, I want us to understand
[57:34] this principle that sometimes God will
[57:37] harden the heart of somebody in YOUR
[57:39] LIFE TO ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY in you. I
[57:44] hope you're HEARING ME TONIGHT.
[57:45] SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH
[57:46] A DIFFICULTY in your marriage, a
[57:48] difficulty IN YOUR HOME, A DIFFICULTY AT
[57:51] CHURCH, A DIFFICULTY ON THE JOB. YOU
[57:53] THERE MIGHT BE A HARDENING OF A HEART.
[57:56] And you say, "Why, Lord, did you go
[57:57] through that? Did you make me go through
[57:59] that? Why did I have to put UP WITH
[58:01] THAT?" WELL, IT'S JUST SO HE COULD GIVE
[58:03] YOU A TESTIMONY. HE WANTED TO ESTABLISH
[58:06] A TESTIMONY. SO, HE ALLOWED PEOPLE'S
[58:08] HEARTS TO BE HARDENED. AND MAYBE you
[58:10] were poor for a while. MAYBE YOU WERE
[58:12] SICK FOR A WHILE. MAYBE YOU STRUGGLED
[58:14] FOR A WHILE. BUT THE STRUGGLE WAS FOR
[58:16] THE TESTIMONY.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; SEE, PHARAOH'S HEART HAD TO BE hardened
[58:22] &gt;&gt; so that he would pursue them
[58:25] &gt;&gt; out of Egypt. It wouldn't be enough. You
[58:29] ever think, "Why can't the devil just
[58:30] leave me alone?"
[58:34] You I felt like that a few times. Why
[58:36] don't the devil just leave me alone? It
[58:38] seems like I get a victory and I have a
[58:39] good service and I'm doing pretty good
[58:41] and ALL OF A SUDDEN, all of the SUDDEN
[58:43] I'M JUST SWEPT OFF MY FEET. HERE COMES
[58:44] THE ENEMY AGAIN. IT seemed like SOON AS
[58:46] WE WALK OUT THOSE DOORS, A LOT OF TIMES
[58:48] THE ENEMY COMES BACK. CAN ANYBODY
[58:50] TESTIFY WITH ME TONIGHT? IT SEEMS LIKE
[58:51] THE ENEMY COMES RIGHT BACK ON OUR TAIL
[58:53] AGAIN. WHY DOES HE DO THAT? GOD IS
[58:56] ESTABLISHING A TESTIMONY.
[58:58] You get sick and you get well and you
[59:00] seem like things are going good and then
[59:01] you get sick again. Or you GET A GOOD
[59:04] JOB SEEMS LIKE THINGS ARE GETTING GOOD
[59:05] AND YOU GET FIRED or or get laid off or
[59:07] something happens or you're not able to
[59:10] do it anymore. WH WHY? BECAUSE GOD IS
[59:12] ESTABLISHING A TESTIMONY. HE SAID
[59:14] THEY'LL SERVE ME NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING
[59:15] ON IN their life.
[59:19] So the testimony of the Egyptians
[59:21] drowning in the sea needed TO BE
[59:24] ESTABLISHED
[59:26] BY TWO OR three witnesses.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; So in order to do that, I'm going
[59:31] somewhere tonight. Just hang with me. In
[59:33] order to DO THAT, GOD HAD TO HARDEN
[59:35] PHARAOH'S HEART.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, we'll find Brother Random always
[59:39] tied Pharaoh to Hitler.
[59:42] HE SAID, "GOD HARDENED HITLER'S heart so
[59:45] HE COULD HAVE A testimony
[59:48] &gt;&gt; so that flag could fly over Israel
[59:50] again."
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that, church. I know
[59:52] there's a it's it's it's fashionable
[59:55] right now to bash Israel, but Israel as
[59:58] a nation is there because God hardened
[1:00:00] Hitler's heart
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; and the tender hand of Jehovah drove
[1:00:05] them back into the homeland.
[1:00:07] Oh my. There's going TO BE 144,000 OF
[1:00:10] THEM THAT'LL be saved. IT WON'T BE ALL
[1:00:12] of them, BUT 144,000 THAT'LL be saved at
[1:00:15] the end time. Elected Jews that'll
[1:00:18] receive THE SAME HOLY GHOST THAT YOU
[1:00:20] have
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; at Oh, come on, church. At the end time.
[1:00:25] Why? Because they'll be saved AS A
[1:00:26] NATION. THEY'LL BE SAVED IN A DAY. WHY?
[1:00:29] GOD'S GOING TO HAVE A TESTIMONY IN SPITE
[1:00:31] OF EVERYTHING HITLER TRIED TO DO. IN
[1:00:33] SPITE OF EVERYTHING MUSSOLINI TRIED TO
[1:00:35] DO. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU GOT THE SAME
[1:00:37] TESTIMONY TODAY. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,
[1:00:40] MAYBE THIS FAMILY MEMBER OR THAT family
[1:00:41] member or that church OR THAT PREACHER
[1:00:43] OR THAT PERSON IN YOUR LIFE, NO MATTER
[1:00:45] WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO, NO MATTER HOW
[1:00:47] MUCH THEIR HEART WAS HARDENED, GOD
[1:00:49] ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:59] Why do we go through the things that we
[1:01:01] do? He's establishing a testimony.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He wants to establish a testimony
[1:01:07] in the hearts of our young people,
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; right? Maybe maybe a different testimony
[1:01:11] than he established in our hearts, but
[1:01:13] it's still a testimony,
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; right? You may not go through what I
[1:01:16] went through, but he's establishing a
[1:01:18] testimony,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; right? Your testimony might be, Lord,
[1:01:24] let me not be stubborn like my father.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Now, that that's what he said, isn't it?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; He said that they wouldn't be stubborn
[1:01:33] like their fathers. And I think fathers
[1:01:35] who really understand would say, "Yes,
[1:01:38] Lord, I want that. I don't want my
[1:01:40] children to have to have as many hurdles
[1:01:42] as I went through."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So, I want them to have a a a different
[1:01:46] testimony. Right? And they will because
[1:01:49] of your faithfulness to God. Because you
[1:01:51] were brought out of what you were
[1:01:52] brought out of. Your children have a
[1:01:53] different testimony, but they'll still
[1:01:55] have a testimony.
[1:01:56] So in Psalm 78:5, he says, "He
[1:01:58] established a testimony in Jacob and
[1:02:01] appointed a law in Israel, which he
[1:02:02] commanded our fathers, they should make
[1:02:04] them known to their children, that the
[1:02:05] generation to come might know them, even
[1:02:07] the children which should be born, who
[1:02:09] should arise and declare them to their
[1:02:10] children, that they might set their hope
[1:02:12] in God, and not forget the works of God,
[1:02:15] BUT KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, MIGHT NOT BE
[1:02:16] AS THEIR FATHERS." A stubborn and
[1:02:19] rebellious generation, a generation that
[1:02:20] set not their heart. So in other words,
[1:02:22] where we failed, we want our children to
[1:02:24] do better. Yeah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Can we grasp that concept? We want our
[1:02:29] children TO DO BETTER, BUT HOW ARE WE
[1:02:30] GOING TO HOW ARE WE GOING TO OUR
[1:02:32] children going to do better? Well, by
[1:02:33] our example, by our testimony, BY US
[1:02:36] TELLING THEM THIS IS WHAT I WAS, BUT
[1:02:38] THIS IS WHAT I AM TODAY. DON'T BE WHAT I
[1:02:41] WAS. BE what I am.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; So, so he said we he said they didn't
[1:02:48] set their heart right. The fathers
[1:02:49] didn't. But we want the children to do
[1:02:51] that. Look how Paul puts it in 1
[1:02:53] Corinthians 10:1. He said, "Moreover,
[1:02:55] brethren, I would not that you should be
[1:02:56] ignorant, how that all our fathers were
[1:02:58] under the cloud, and all pass through
[1:03:00] the sea, and they were all baptized unto
[1:03:02] Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and
[1:03:05] did all eat the same spiritual meat, and
[1:03:08] they all drink the same spiritual drink.
[1:03:09] They drank of that spiritual rock that
[1:03:11] followed them. That rock was Christ."
[1:03:15] But with many of them, God was not well
[1:03:16] pleased, for they were overthrown in the
[1:03:19] wilderness. He said, "Now these things
[1:03:22] were our examples." This is these
[1:03:24] children's children's children's
[1:03:25] children. He's talking about he said to
[1:03:28] the intent we should not lust after evil
[1:03:30] things as they also lusted. Neither be
[1:03:32] idolattors as were some of them as it is
[1:03:34] written that people sat down to eat and
[1:03:36] drink and rose up to play. Neither let
[1:03:38] us commit fornication as some of them
[1:03:40] committed and fell in one day three and
[1:03:42] 20,000. Neither let us tempt Christ as
[1:03:44] some of them also tempted and were
[1:03:46] destroyed of serpents. Be a murmur ye.
[1:03:49] Some of them also murmured and were
[1:03:50] destroyed of the destroyers. SO WHAT'S
[1:03:53] PAUL SAYING? DON'T BE COMPLAINERS LIKE
[1:03:55] YOUR forefathers were.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; We could go somewhere with that,
[1:04:00] couldn't we?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Right? DON'T DON'T DO THAT. GOD HELPED
[1:04:04] THEM AND GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRITUAL ROCK
[1:04:06] AND SPIRITUAL MANA AND YET they
[1:04:08] complained anyway. He said, "LET'S NOT
[1:04:10] BE LIKE THAT. LET'S LEARN FROM THEIR
[1:04:12] TESTIMONY AND HAVE A BETTER TESTIMONY."
[1:04:14] YEAH.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Now all these things
[1:04:18] happened unto them for examples, and
[1:04:20] they are written for our admonition,
[1:04:22] upon whom the ends of the world are
[1:04:23] come. Wherefore let him that thinkketh
[1:04:26] he standeth and take heed lest he fall.
[1:04:28] LET YOUR TESTIMONY BE ESTABLISHED in the
[1:04:31] word of God. Let your TESTIMONY BE
[1:04:33] ESTABLISHED THAT I'M going to make it."
[1:04:35] How many can have that testimony
[1:04:37] tonight? I'm going to make it. I don't
[1:04:39] have TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES of the past.
[1:04:40] I don't have to repeat my own mistakes.
[1:04:42] I don't have to repeat the MISTAKES OF
[1:04:44] MY FATHER. I DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT THE
[1:04:45] MISTAKES OF MY GRANDFATHER. BUT I AM AN
[1:04:48] OVERCOMER. I can live a VICTORIOUS LIFE.
[1:04:51] I BELONG IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I BELONG I
[1:04:54] BELONG WITH THE SONS OF GOD SHOUTING IN
[1:04:56] THE HOUSE OF GOD PRAISING AND WORSHIPING
[1:04:58] GOD. I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DEAD COLD
[1:05:00] FORMAL RELIGION. I CAN BE ON FIRE FOR
[1:05:02] GOD. ARE YOU WITH ME TONIGHT? LET ME NOT
[1:05:04] REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF the past. Listen,
[1:05:06] I I had I was talking to a preacher here
[1:05:08] not long ago and he said, "Well, I wish
[1:05:10] things were like they were in the 70s
[1:05:12] and the 80s." I said, "I don't want to
[1:05:13] go back TO THAT. I WANT TO I want to
[1:05:15] live for now. I WANT TO SEE GOD MOVE US
[1:05:18] IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY were back
[1:05:19] then. I DON'T WANT THINGS LIKE THEY USED
[1:05:21] to be. I want to SEE THE YOUNG ONES COME
[1:05:23] UP AND BE ABLE TO WORSHIP GOD WITHOUT
[1:05:25] ALL THE FEAR AND THE CRITICISM a and the
[1:05:28] legalism that they had back then.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's good. that they can know who they
[1:05:36] are, come into full adoption in the age
[1:05:40] WHEN ALL THAT WE'RE ALL IN THE LAND
[1:05:42] WHERE ALL THE PROMISES LAY. OH, I'M GLAD
[1:05:44] THAT MY FATHERS AND MY FOREFATHERS AND
[1:05:46] PEOPLE THAT WERE OLDER THAN ME FOUGHT
[1:05:48] THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH, BUT LET ME GO
[1:05:49] ON INTO PERFECTION.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Establish a testimony.
[1:05:56] Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] God established a testimony in the life
[1:05:59] of brother Brandham.
[1:06:01] I think we're all familiar with it. But
[1:06:04] he had a supernatural birth.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; I like come and now you don't have that
[1:06:09] testimony. I don't.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham did,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:16] And and I don't need that testimony. I
[1:06:18] need to believe it
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; and then have my own testimony.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon makes this statement
[1:06:25] as he had so many supernatural things
[1:06:27] happen in his life but also made many
[1:06:29] mistakes. You say, "Brother Ben, how can
[1:06:31] you say that he was a prophet of God?" I
[1:06:33] say that because he was a human being
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; and because that's what he said. But we
[1:06:38] don't dwell on his mistakes. We look at
[1:06:41] what God did in those mistakes in spite
[1:06:45] of those mistakes and how God used him.
[1:06:47] And I say, "God, if you could use me
[1:06:48] even 100th as much as you did him in
[1:06:52] spite of my mistakes, I can have my own
[1:06:54] testimony." Are you with me now?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So, so brother Brandon says this. He
[1:06:59] said, "You help me." He he's about to
[1:07:00] tell his life story, his testimony. He
[1:07:03] said, "You help me as I start back from
[1:07:04] the beginning. When you put your hand on
[1:07:06] your poor humble servant, may all my
[1:07:09] mistakes today, may others and young
[1:07:12] boys and girls who's coming on, may they
[1:07:15] be stepping stones to bring them to
[1:07:17] thee. MAY THEY PROFIT FROM MY ERRORS of
[1:07:21] suffering that they might know you in
[1:07:24] the power of your resurrection."
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] And you know, it's just as simple as not
[1:07:29] understanding. I I didn't have the
[1:07:31] benefit of being taught the opening of
[1:07:34] the word like these children are being
[1:07:36] taught from a young age.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the benefit of being
[1:07:39] taught how we could have confidence in
[1:07:41] the fullness of the word.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's a big deal.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; But now our children are being TAUGHT
[1:07:46] THAT FROM A YOUNG AGE,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? So I want my children though I
[1:07:50] didn't have that benefit. I had to come
[1:07:51] to that myself. But I want my children
[1:07:54] to go a little bit further than I did.
[1:07:56] Are you with me now? And where I made
[1:07:59] blunders and errors maybe early on, not
[1:08:01] understanding, not knowing WHERE I
[1:08:03] STOOD, NOT HAVING THE kind of, you know,
[1:08:06] when I when we first got married and and
[1:08:09] started out, we were pastoring a church
[1:08:12] and we needed a pastor.
[1:08:15] We really did, brother JT, but we were
[1:08:16] pastoring a church and and God was with
[1:08:19] us in spite of our errors and our
[1:08:22] blunders.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? But I WANT MY MY
[1:08:26] CHILDREN AND MY grandchildren that if
[1:08:28] the Lord carries and THESE YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:08:30] I WANT THEM TO PROFIT FROM OUR ERRORS of
[1:08:32] suffering THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW YOU IN
[1:08:34] THE POWER of your resurrection. Oh God,
[1:08:36] let that be the truth. So we don't WANT
[1:08:38] OUR KIDS TO ACT JUST LIKE US. We want
[1:08:41] them to go on a higher level. Somebody's
[1:08:44] got to go in. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE THAT
[1:08:46] FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. WE WHICH ARE
[1:08:48] ALIVE AND REMAIN UNTIL THE COMING OF THE
[1:08:50] LORD SHALL NOT HINDER THEM WHICH ARE
[1:08:51] ASLEEP. I BELIEVE IT'LL BE ME. BUT IF IT
[1:08:53] DON'T COME IN MY GENERATION, DON'T LET
[1:08:55] ME GET IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER GENERATION.
[1:08:58] Brother Brham said, if I don't have the
[1:08:59] faith to bring it to pass, HE SAID, I
[1:09:01] DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY OF SOMEONE
[1:09:02] who has.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Again, he said, I want you
[1:09:07] to make my blunder stepping stones for
[1:09:08] you to Christ that you'll bypass that
[1:09:11] and especially the young people that's
[1:09:12] coming on and got life yet before them
[1:09:14] until they become of the age. He said,
[1:09:16] now you just look at my mistakes and
[1:09:18] don't try to pattern after them. But you
[1:09:20] just say now what brother Brandham did
[1:09:22] now I'm going to get past that. That's a
[1:09:23] powerful statement. How could we ever
[1:09:25] even get to what brother Brandham did?
[1:09:27] BUT HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT BEING A
[1:09:28] PROPHET. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT HAVING A
[1:09:30] SUPERNATURAL BIRTH. HE'S NOT TALKING
[1:09:32] ABOUT THAT. BUT JUST IN LIFE choosing
[1:09:33] the right thing,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; right? There was a time when brother
[1:09:37] Brandham chose not to go to the
[1:09:39] Pentecostal people when he should have
[1:09:41] went and he said it was a terrible
[1:09:43] mistake and he lost a baby and BUT HE
[1:09:45] SAID LET MY CHILDREN THESE CHILDREN MAKE
[1:09:48] A STEPPING STONE out of THAT
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE
[1:09:51] VOICE of the Lord.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Even in the mistakes God was
[1:09:58] establishing a testimony.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Is that is that what you can say
[1:10:04] tonight? even in my mistakes.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "But brother Ben, I made a
[1:10:09] terrible mistake. Don't beat yourself up
[1:10:10] too much." Because Jonah ended up in the
[1:10:13] belly of a well because he directly
[1:10:15] disobeyed God.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And it's exactly where God wanted him.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Did you know that
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; he was in the belly of a well because he
[1:10:27] directly disobeyed God? And it's exactly
[1:10:29] where God wanted and needed him to be.
[1:10:32] Right?
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And if he hadn't been in the belly of
[1:10:34] the well, Nineveh would have never
[1:10:35] believed him.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And we followed that trail before.
[1:10:41] Remember where if he if Nineveh hadn't
[1:10:44] believed, then the Assyrians would have
[1:10:46] never taken over of parts of Israel and
[1:10:49] they would have never moved the people
[1:10:50] away and brought the Samaritans in,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; right? And the woman at the well
[1:10:55] wouldn't have been there
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; because there would have been no
[1:10:58] Samaritans if Jonah hadn't disobeyed
[1:11:00] God. BUT GOD TURNED HIS DISOBEDIENCE
[1:11:03] into a testimony. That's hard for us to
[1:11:05] understand, but that's the providence of
[1:11:07] God that we should always do the right
[1:11:09] thing,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; right? We should always do the right
[1:11:12] thing. We should do the right thing for
[1:11:13] the right reasons. But even when we make
[1:11:15] a mistake, EVEN WHEN WE STUMBLE, GOD'S
[1:11:17] ABLE TO TURN THAT INTO a testimony. He
[1:11:20] said he'll even take, IT'S ASTOUNDING TO
[1:11:22] ME. HE SAID HE'LL TAKE THE PERMISSIVE
[1:11:24] WILL OF GOD TO GLORIFY THE PERFECT WILL
[1:11:27] AS IF the permissive will makes the
[1:11:29] perfect will more perfect. Think about
[1:11:31] it. It was the permissive will of God
[1:11:33] that man fell. It was a permissive WILL
[1:11:35] OF GOD THAT they did what they did in
[1:11:37] the garden AND THAT MAN FELL. THAT WAS
[1:11:39] NOT THE PERFECT WILL OF GOD FOR them to
[1:11:40] sin. But yet it was the permissive WILL
[1:11:43] OF GOD THAT GAVE US A SAVIOR. IT WAS THE
[1:11:45] PER COME ON CHURCH. It was THE
[1:11:47] PERMISSIVE WILL OF GOD. I SHOULD SAY IT
[1:11:49] LIKE THIS. That allowed the conditions
[1:11:51] where a savior was needed.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; We should always strive for the perfect
[1:11:58] will of God.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Because there will be a people that will
[1:12:02] go with that with the perfect will of
[1:12:04] God. Brother Brandon said, he said,
[1:12:06] "Brother, sister, if I ever want to be
[1:12:07] sincerious, it's now
[1:12:09] after all my mistakes is showing." He
[1:12:13] said reason I brought these messages
[1:12:14] previously that God shows there that
[1:12:15] he's merciful. He said Moses made his
[1:12:18] mistakes a great man like him. Then when
[1:12:21] Joshua come up he was going to make his
[1:12:22] too. But God said as I was with Moses so
[1:12:25] will I be with you.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Look at God two years ago he said
[1:12:29] pointing that scripture right to me. As
[1:12:30] I was with Moses so I'll be with you. He
[1:12:33] said I'll not look at your mistakes.
[1:12:35] Aren't you glad he can tell you that
[1:12:36] today?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; He said I'll not look at your mistakes.
[1:12:38] He knew that this hour was coming. Now
[1:12:40] it's here. He said see right back again.
[1:12:42] Because God never God could never get
[1:12:44] away from it. He said, "When I think of
[1:12:47] Abraham, all the mistakes he made in
[1:12:48] Moses and his mistake, but when
[1:12:50] Abraham's commentary was written, when
[1:12:52] the divine commentary was written, when
[1:12:54] Paul wrote Abraham's commentary, he
[1:12:55] never mentioned one thing about
[1:12:57] Abraham's unbelief." No, he said never
[1:12:59] was even accounted to him, he said,
[1:13:00] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:13:03] God through unbelief, BUT WAS STRONG
[1:13:05] GIVING PRAISE to God. He said, "My
[1:13:07] humble prayer is before the grace of God
[1:13:08] that's here this morning," he said, "I
[1:13:10] hope mine's wrote like that, that he
[1:13:12] won't see my mistakes. AND WHEN MY
[1:13:14] COMMENTARY IS WRITTEN, my obituary, it
[1:13:16] won't be read out that I made mistakes
[1:13:18] and done wrong." Oh, come on. AREN'T YOU
[1:13:20] GLAD FOR THE GRACE OF GOD? AREN'T YOU
[1:13:22] GLAD FOR A TESTIMONY, HE'S ESTABLISHING
[1:13:24] A TESTIMONY. HE SAID THAT WHEN I made
[1:13:26] mistakes and done wrong, but he'll only
[1:13:28] see the things I tried to do for him. He
[1:13:31] said, "May they just become?" HE SAID,
[1:13:32] "WHAT DOES THAT take the grace of God
[1:13:34] that I BELIEVE IN?" HE SAID, "AND that's
[1:13:36] where I'm SOLELY TRUSTING. FOR UPON MY
[1:13:38] OWN MERITS, I COULD NO MORE GO IN THAN
[1:13:41] NONE OF THE REST, BUT UPON THE GRACE OF
[1:13:43] GOD, I'M DEPENDING." Aren't you glad for
[1:13:45] the grace of God?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, this scripture is
[1:13:48] still true. 1 John 2:1, "My little
[1:13:50] children, these things write I unto you
[1:13:52] that you sin not."
[1:13:54] Right? It's not the it's it it's not the
[1:13:57] will of God for any man to sin.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And it's any man's sin.
[1:14:04] That's the humanity clause,
[1:14:09] right? So, it's like he puts in the bold
[1:14:12] print, I write these things unto you
[1:14:14] that you sin not.
[1:14:17] And then the humanity clause. Now, if
[1:14:19] you sin willfully and you sin because
[1:14:22] you want to, you need the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You need something to change that
[1:14:26] desire.
[1:14:28] But if you make a mistake, he said, "If
[1:14:31] any man sin, we have an advocate."
[1:14:35] In other words, an attorney,
[1:14:37] an attorney on retainer, if you would
[1:14:40] say it like that. We have an attorney
[1:14:42] with the father, Jesus Christ the
[1:14:44] righteous. Oh, aren't you glad for an
[1:14:47] advocate today?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Now, Father God, we
[1:14:50] thank you for these hands that come up
[1:14:52] for to be Christians. I believe they
[1:14:54] meant it in their hearts. I pray for
[1:14:57] them that they will not any time fail.
[1:15:01] That's the way we want it for our
[1:15:02] children, isn't it? For our young
[1:15:04] people. I PRAY FOR THEM THAT THEY WILL
[1:15:06] NOT ANY time fail. I don't want you to
[1:15:09] ever fail. But listen, he's now here's
[1:15:13] the humanity clause. And if they do
[1:15:15] fail, make quickly they have that
[1:15:17] advocate with the father which I have
[1:15:20] learned to be such a great thing.
[1:15:23] Hallelujah. FATHER THAT WHEN I MAKE ALL
[1:15:25] my mistakes, THEN I FIND OUT I HAVE AN
[1:15:28] ADVOCATE RIGHT QUICK WITH THE father
[1:15:29] through Jesus CHRIST AND I'M BROUGHT
[1:15:31] BACK INTO GRACE AGAIN. The loving hand
[1:15:34] of the LORD WIPES AWAY. THERE'S A BLOODY
[1:15:36] SACRIFICE LAYING THERE that I confess to
[1:15:39] BE MY SAVIOR. LISTEN, DON'T WALLOW IN
[1:15:41] YOUR MISTAKES. THERE'S NO SHAME IN
[1:15:44] FALLING DOWN. IT'S WHEN YOU FALL DOWN
[1:15:45] AND STAY THERE AND YOU WALLOW IN
[1:15:47] UNBELIEF. BUT GET BACK UP AND SAY,
[1:15:49] "LORD, LORD, I MIGHT HAVE MADE A
[1:15:51] MISTAKE, BUT I HAVE AN ADVOCATE WITH THE
[1:15:53] FATHER."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ben, YOU PREACHED THAT
[1:15:55] TOO MUCH. I'LL NEVER PREACH IT ENOUGH."
[1:15:57] BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES
[1:15:58] TILL THE DAY YOU DIE. YOU'RE NEVER GOING
[1:16:00] TO PERFECTLY FOLLOW THE WILL OF GOD IN
[1:16:02] THIS BODY. THAT'S WHY HE'S GOT TO GIVE
[1:16:04] YOU A NEW BODY.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:10] If you could perfectly follow the word,
[1:16:14] the letter of the law in this body, you
[1:16:16] wouldn't need a body change.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; So, a testimony has to be established. A
[1:16:24] testimony was established in Jacob. A
[1:16:27] testimony still stands today in Israel.
[1:16:30] A testimony was established in God's
[1:16:32] prophet. We know that he established a
[1:16:35] testimony in William Brandon. and and a
[1:16:37] testimony has been established in the
[1:16:40] bride.
[1:16:42] See, he come in the fullness of the word
[1:16:45] to us. Do you realize, and I don't want
[1:16:47] to,
[1:16:49] how can I put this and not sound like
[1:16:51] I'm I'm I'm demeaning because brother
[1:16:53] Brandham at any point in his life was a
[1:16:55] prophet,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; right? He was born a prophet.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; But there's things about the message
[1:17:00] that we understand today that brother
[1:17:01] Brandham didn't understand until late in
[1:17:03] his life.
[1:17:06] He didn't know what the seals were
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; until he preached them,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; right? He said, "I was about to make an
[1:17:13] awful mistake
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and then he went and preached the truth
[1:17:17] because the angel of the Lord." But we
[1:17:18] have the benefit of hindsight,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; right? That that we can stand on his
[1:17:23] shoulders,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; right? And see farther
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; even than he could at a younger age.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? Not being prophets,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; not being ANYTHING SPECIAL, JUST
[1:17:33] SOMEBODY that can read. can understand
[1:17:35] more about the mysteries of God today
[1:17:38] than even a prophet understood at a
[1:17:40] certain time because it wasn't open yet.
[1:17:42] But God came in the fullness of the word
[1:17:44] in our day. This is so important,
[1:17:47] church. HE CAME TO ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO REPEAT THE
[1:17:53] MISTAKES OF THE PAST. So we wouldn't be
[1:17:55] just another group or another
[1:17:56] denomination with another reformer,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; another Wesley or another Luther. HE
[1:18:01] CAME IN THIS HOUR WITH THE FULLNESS OF
[1:18:03] THE WORD SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A FULL
[1:18:05] THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; We could do things the right way. WE
[1:18:10] COULD LIVE THE RIGHT WAY. WE COULD
[1:18:11] BELIEVE the right thing. WE COULD WE
[1:18:13] COULD TRUST HIM IN HIS FULLNESS.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; So again, now watch. There was a written
[1:18:22] word and the people had faith in that
[1:18:24] written word and then so then they
[1:18:28] testified
[1:18:30] you know but you can testify even before
[1:18:31] it happens. You testify of what's
[1:18:34] written in the word pretty soon you'll
[1:18:35] be testifying of what God did
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; how he manifested that in your own life.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; So first they testified what was written
[1:18:42] and then they that's why God TOLD MOSES
[1:18:44] WHY CRY SPEAK.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; He said speak AND GO FORWARD. WHAT WAS
[1:18:48] IT? A TESTIMONY. GOD SAID GO, SO WE'RE
[1:18:51] GOING TO GO. AND WHEN THEY WALKED IN,
[1:18:53] THE TESTIMONY BECOME A REALITY
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and they could rejoice on the other side
[1:18:58] of the Red Sea. So God spoke through a
[1:19:01] prophet and he revealed. Now we find
[1:19:04] Revelation 10 1-7. We're going to read
[1:19:06] that just a moment, but that's the
[1:19:08] written word, but it didn't mean a lot
[1:19:11] to a lot of people.
[1:19:14] Am I going over your head for a
[1:19:16] Wednesday night? I hope not. I think
[1:19:18] this would be simple to us.
[1:19:20] Revelation 10:1-7 was the written word
[1:19:23] revealed to a prophet hidden from the
[1:19:26] public but revealed to the bride.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Revelation 10:1 I saw another
[1:19:32] mighty angel come down from heaven.
[1:19:34] Brother Brham said only Christ it could
[1:19:36] be
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; right clothed with a cloud. A rainbow
[1:19:39] was upon his head. His face as it were
[1:19:41] the sun and his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:19:44] And he had in his hand a little book
[1:19:46] open. There's a written word but it's
[1:19:48] been opened. He set his right foot upon
[1:19:50] the sea, his left foot on the earth. And
[1:19:52] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:19:54] lion roarth. When he had cried, seven
[1:19:56] thunders uttered their voices. And when
[1:19:59] the seven thunders had uttered their
[1:20:00] voices, I was about to write, and I
[1:20:01] heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[1:20:03] me, "Seal up those things which the
[1:20:05] seven thunders uttered, and write them
[1:20:06] not." I know you think I'm starting
[1:20:08] another sermon, but I'm almost done.
[1:20:11] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:20:13] sea and upon the earth, lifted up his
[1:20:15] hand. Am I doing okay, brother Josh? Are
[1:20:16] we still good on time? That's good.
[1:20:18] That's That's why he's here, Josh.
[1:20:22] It says, "THE ANGEL WHICH I SAW STAND
[1:20:24] UPON the sea and upon the earth." What
[1:20:25] did he do? Now, come on. We We know
[1:20:27] this. We've been taught this. He lifted
[1:20:28] up his hand to heaven. Why?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; He was swearing an oath.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; What was it? What is that? Giving a
[1:20:34] testimony.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; That's why when you raise your hands in
[1:20:38] church, you're not just doing what other
[1:20:39] people do, but when you raise YOUR HAND,
[1:20:41] YOU'RE DEFYING THE LAW OF GRAVITY,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Purposely giving a testimony.
[1:20:45] WHAT ARE YOU SAYING WHEN YOU SING MY GOD
[1:20:47] IS AWESOME AND YOU RAISE YOUR HAND? WHAT
[1:20:49] ARE YOU DOING? I'M HERE TO TESTIFY MY
[1:20:51] GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD. When you RAISE
[1:20:53] YOUR HAND DURING THE PREACHING, YOU'RE
[1:20:54] SAYING WHAT THE PREACHER'S SAYING, I SAY
[1:20:56] AMEN TO IT. SO BE IT. AND I RAISED MY
[1:20:58] HAND IN TESTIMONY THAT WHEN HE TALKS
[1:21:00] ABOUT HOW WHAT GOD DID IN HIS LIFE, I
[1:21:02] CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE AND
[1:21:04] SEE THE VERY SAME GOD WORKING. I'M
[1:21:06] ADDING MY OWN SWORN TESTIMONY.
[1:21:10] THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO
[1:21:11] RAISE OUR HANDS high
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; in the house OF GOD TO LIFT OUR HANDS IN
[1:21:15] THE HOUSE OF GOD IN WORSHIP. WHY?
[1:21:17] BECAUSE IT'S A SWORN TESTIMONY. THESE
[1:21:19] THINGS ARE TR THE TRUTH.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; It's our testimony.
[1:21:25] The angel, hallelujah, made had a
[1:21:28] testimony AND HE LIFTED UP HIS hand to
[1:21:30] heaven AND SWEAR BY HIM that liveth
[1:21:33] forever and ever created heaven and the
[1:21:34] things that therein are in the earth and
[1:21:36] the things that therein are in the sea
[1:21:37] and the things which are there in that
[1:21:38] there should be time no longer but in
[1:21:42] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:21:44] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:21:47] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:21:50] hath declared to his servants the
[1:21:53] prophets.
[1:21:56] So that's the written word.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Then God calls a prophet into the
[1:22:00] desert,
[1:22:02] right?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; To establish a testimony.
[1:22:09] He even told him, "Bypass your
[1:22:10] troubles." He said, "If you stay here,
[1:22:12] you'll have trouble."
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Right. You remember the boy that in the
[1:22:16] vision, Brother Brandham saw himself
[1:22:18] kicking him down the hill? the young guy
[1:22:21] from the
[1:22:23] brother Brandon was still human,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; right? And sometimes in business deals,
[1:22:27] we get that like we want to act like
[1:22:29] that. But God told Brother Brandham, he
[1:22:31] said, "Byppass your trouble. Don't do
[1:22:32] that." Said, "Go west." So God put him
[1:22:35] out in the desert. Brother Brand said it
[1:22:36] was a spiritual desert. His family
[1:22:37] suffered, right? It was it was a hard
[1:22:40] place to be out in the desert, but he
[1:22:42] was there for a reason because
[1:22:44] Revelation 10 had to be fulfilled.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So God had a
[1:22:50] testimony. He had a testimony of the
[1:22:52] written word. But now that written word
[1:22:54] was going to be manifested. There was
[1:22:57] going to be I hope you recognize what's
[1:22:59] happened in our day that that actually
[1:23:02] God came down in word form in our day
[1:23:06] and he caused himself to be seen even as
[1:23:10] the angels were there with brother
[1:23:12] Brandham. carried him away in that into
[1:23:14] the cloud and he was lifted up and when
[1:23:17] he come back to the ground again that
[1:23:18] that that cloud goes away either as it
[1:23:22] was going or as it was coming that cloud
[1:23:25] was his picture was taken
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; right I know there's been a lot of
[1:23:29] controversy about that but look the
[1:23:31] picture was taken now the Bible says
[1:23:34] that he'll make even your enemies be at
[1:23:35] peace with you and in this case brother
[1:23:37] Brandham brother Brandham was uh he he
[1:23:39] he he talked a lot about science being
[1:23:41] the enemy of God. And then Science
[1:23:44] magazine, we we see the one in Life
[1:23:46] magazine a lot, but Science magazine
[1:23:48] carried a picture
[1:23:51] of of the cloud that if you turn it to
[1:23:54] the right is the face of Christ.
[1:23:56] Right? Now, again, you say, "Well, how
[1:23:58] did it get there?" I don't know how it
[1:23:59] got there. I know it was it looked like
[1:24:01] Jesus
[1:24:02] when it was there. And the significance
[1:24:05] of it to us is that to a believer, it
[1:24:09] caused us to have a testimony, right? It
[1:24:11] was something significant to us. Now, it
[1:24:13] wasn't meant for the unbeliever. It was
[1:24:16] meant for the believer.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I believe it was God. I believe it was
[1:24:20] supernatural.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But no matter what what you might say,
[1:24:25] people have all kinds of But it's
[1:24:27] interesting to me, even the people who
[1:24:29] try to pick it apart and say it was just
[1:24:30] a rocket or anything else, what they
[1:24:33] don't realize is they're actually
[1:24:34] testifying that it was there.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Right? We didn't make this up. in their
[1:24:41] attempt. Hallelujah. So, I run across
[1:24:44] this the other day, but they gave on the
[1:24:45] internet. So, I went looking and I just
[1:24:48] typed in cloud picture 1963. And this is
[1:24:50] what comes up. So, if you pull it, if
[1:24:53] you type it in, you'll see a couple of
[1:24:55] entries and one of the first entries you
[1:24:57] see is is a website dedicated to
[1:24:59] destroying Brother Random's ministry
[1:25:02] with a picture of the cloud on the
[1:25:05] website. I about did a jig.
[1:25:09] And I don't care what they say about it.
[1:25:11] God's making his enemies testify. JUST
[1:25:14] LIKE HE HARDENED PHARAOH'S HEART.
[1:25:15] HALLELUJAH. AND HE MADE HIS ENEMIES
[1:25:17] TESTIFY THAT THE WORD WAS TRUE. HE'S
[1:25:19] GOING TO MAKE HIS ENEMIES TESTIFY THAT
[1:25:21] THE WORD IS TRUE. IT DID HAPPEN.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; AND SO IT IT SHOWED UP IN THE MAGAZINE,
[1:25:27] IN LIFE MAGAZINE, in Look magazine, in
[1:25:28] Science magazine. He made his enemies
[1:25:31] testify. Now, WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT AM
[1:25:34] I DOING TONIGHT? I'M TELLING MY CHILDREN
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; SO THEY CAN TELL THEIR CHILDREN SO THAT
[1:25:39] IF THERE'S ANOTHER GENERATION, THEY CAN
[1:25:40] TELL THEIR CHILDREN DOWN TO THE FIFTH
[1:25:42] GENERATION. LISTEN, A LOT OF US, WE'RE
[1:25:44] ALMOST IN THAT FIFTH GENERATION NOW.
[1:25:45] WE'VE BEEN TELLING OUR CHILDREN, GOD DID
[1:25:47] SOMETHING IN OUR DAY. NOW, GO GET YOUR
[1:25:49] TESTIMONY.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; GET YOUR TESTIMONY. GET FILLED WITH THE
[1:25:52] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. GOD HAS MADE
[1:25:54] A TESTIMONY IN our day.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; HE HAS ESTABLISHED A TESTIMONY IN OUR
[1:25:59] HEARTS THAT THE WORD HAS BEEN OPENED.
[1:26:01] What is it? What is it? It's our turn.
[1:26:04] Now, if you go Revelation 10:1-7, we
[1:26:06] know was fulfilled in Brother Brandham's
[1:26:08] time. But all you have to do is go to
[1:26:11] the next scripture, the next verse,
[1:26:12] Revelation 10:8.
[1:26:15] And something else happens.
[1:26:17] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:26:20] spake unto me again. Who's me? Was John.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Me was John. To put it like some of the
[1:26:28] kids would. Me was John.
[1:26:31] And who was John? A type of the bride.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And said, "Go take the little book which
[1:26:37] is open. It's either open or closed.
[1:26:40] It's open."
[1:26:42] In the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:26:43] upon the sea and upon the earth. And I
[1:26:47] went unto the angel. And said to him,
[1:26:50] "Give me the testimony."
[1:26:53] Are you with me? The written testimony.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Give me the written testimony. Give me
[1:26:58] the little book. And he said to me,
[1:26:59] "Take it and eat IT UP. IT SHALL make
[1:27:01] thy belly bitter, BUT IT SHALL BE IN thy
[1:27:03] mouth sweet as honey.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the
[1:27:06] angel's hand and ate it up, and it was
[1:27:08] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[1:27:09] as I had eaten it, MY BELLY WAS BITTER.
[1:27:11] AND HE SAID UNTO ME, "THOU." COME ON,
[1:27:13] CHURCH. SOMEONE SAY IT WITH ME. THOU,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; WHO was that? You. Me.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Right. Thou is you and me.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Me going TO TESTIFY.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; THOU GOING TO TESTIFY. I'M GOING TO
[1:27:26] TESTIFY. WHAT IS IT? IT'S MY TIME TO
[1:27:29] SPEAK. OH, COME ON. IF THERE EVER WAS A
[1:27:31] TIME FOR A PREACHER TO PREACH, THIS IS
[1:27:32] THE TIME A PREACHER OUGHT TO PREACH. NO
[1:27:34] WONDER THE DEVIL WANTS TO SHUT DOWN
[1:27:35] PREACHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WHY?
[1:27:37] BECAUSE THERE'S A TESTIMONY NOW. JUST
[1:27:39] LIKE THERE WAS BACK THEN WHEN GOD
[1:27:41] DROWNED THE EGYPTIANS IN THE RED SEA,
[1:27:43] THERE'S A TESTIMONY TODAY. GOD KEEPS HIS
[1:27:45] WORD.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; A prophet stood up. Listen,
[1:27:50] I got to finish this. I got about five
[1:27:52] more minutes. I'm done. The word
[1:27:54] testified of it. The prophet testified
[1:27:57] of it.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; But what does the scripture say? by the
[1:27:59] mouth of two or three
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; witnesses.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; So God wasn't going to have a partial
[1:28:04] testimony, but the word AND THE ANGEL
[1:28:08] AND THE PROPHET testified of the same
[1:28:10] thing.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So 2 Corinthians 13:1, Paul
[1:28:16] establishes that. He said, "This is the
[1:28:17] third time I'm coming to you. In the
[1:28:18] mouth of two or three witnesses shall
[1:28:20] every word be established." Brother
[1:28:22] Brandham said, he said, "Oh, blessed be
[1:28:24] the name of the Lord God. We're at the
[1:28:25] end time. The word, the prophet, AND THE
[1:28:28] ANGEL. ALL three of them together, one
[1:28:31] great testimony.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; The word, the prophet, and the angel
[1:28:38] testify.
[1:28:40] Now, now you say, "But how can I have a
[1:28:42] three witnesses?" Well, the word, the
[1:28:44] written word, and the prophet, and the
[1:28:47] Holy Spirit
[1:28:49] RIGHT WITHIN YOU GOT TO TESTIFY THE SAME
[1:28:51] THING. And when YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY
[1:28:53] WITH THE WORD, WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TESTIFY
[1:28:55] WITH THE PROPHET, WHAT HAPPENS? YOU
[1:28:57] ESTABLISH A TESTIMONY IN YOUR OWN LIFE
[1:28:59] THAT CAN GO ON TO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR
[1:29:01] CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. I TELL YOU, DON'T
[1:29:03] EVER GIVE UP ON THIS MESSAGE. DON'T EVER
[1:29:05] SAY IT DON'T MATTER BECAUSE THERE'S A
[1:29:06] TESTIMONY IN IT.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It'll do something for you.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; So he said, "A TRUE PROPHET WILL ALWAYS
[1:29:12] AGREE WITH THE WORD AND ANY ANGEL WILL
[1:29:14] TESTIFY TRUTH." HE SAID, "WE'RE ready
[1:29:16] for marching orders." Do you BELIEVE IT,
[1:29:18] CHURCH, BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE
[1:29:20] WITNESSES? And listen WHAT HE SAID WHEN
[1:29:22] HE STOOD THERE and and what is the
[1:29:23] attraction ON THE MOUNTAIN? HE SAID TWO
[1:29:24] OR three he SAID THREE YEARS AGO THIS
[1:29:26] WAS PROPHECY. HE SAID NOW IT'S BECOME
[1:29:28] HISTORY. WHAT WAS HE TELLING US? GOD
[1:29:31] TESTIFIED OF HIS TRUTH.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful of that church. I
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I'm done tonight. Let's just let's just
[1:29:38] rejoice in that fact AS THE MUSICIANS
[1:29:39] COME. I'M SO THANKFUL HE ESTABLISHED A
[1:29:42] TESTIMONY. I'M SO THANKFUL THAT THE WORD
[1:29:44] STILL WORKS. WHEN YOU SAY, "WELL, IT
[1:29:46] HASN'T WORKED FOR ME." IF YOU'LL BELIEVE
[1:29:48] IT, IF YOU'LL AGREE WITH THE PROPHET AND
[1:29:50] THE WRITTEN WORD, THE WORD will work in
[1:29:52] your life. THE ANGEL WILL COME DOWN AND
[1:29:54] ENFORCE THE WORD in your life. I'm so
[1:29:57] thankful he established a testimony in
[1:29:58] my life. I'm so thankful. I was
[1:30:00] listening to brother Josh's testimony. I
[1:30:02] said, Lord, THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE
[1:30:04] DOES. BROTHER JOSH DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT
[1:30:06] IT WAS THE SAME GOD THAT CALLED BROTHER
[1:30:08] BRANDHAM. THAT SAME GOD THAT SPOKE TO
[1:30:09] HIM IN THE IN THE TREE WAS THE SAME GOD
[1:30:11] PUT HIS HAND OVER BROTHER JOSH JUST OUT
[1:30:13] ON THAT DAY. WAS THE SAME GOD THAT SPOKE
[1:30:15] TO ME IN A BASEMENT. WAS THE SAME GOD,
[1:30:17] BROTHER JOE, THAT GOT YOU. THE SAME GOD
[1:30:19] THAT GAVE EVERY ONE OF US OUR
[1:30:20] TESTIMONIES.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD IS STILL THE SAME
[1:30:24] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. WE DON'T
[1:30:26] FOLLOW A NEW RELIGION. WE'VE GOT A WE
[1:30:28] GOT A NEW CASE OF THE OLD RELIGION.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW? GOD KEEPS HIS WORD.
[1:30:33] HE HAS ESTABLISHED a testimony AND WE
[1:30:35] CAN TELL OUR CHILDREN, our
[1:30:36] grandchildren, all the way down to the
[1:30:39] fifth generation what God did for us.
