[48:56] sorrow
[48:57] he's still a God that can be touched by
[48:59] the feeling of our infirmities
[49:01] today and I am come down to deliver them
[49:04] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[49:06] bring them up out of a land unto a good
[49:09] land and large unto a land flowing with
[49:11] milk and honey unto the place of the
[49:13] Canaanites and Hittites and the amorites
[49:16] and the perizzites and the hivites and
[49:18] the jebusites now therefore Behold The
[49:21] Cry of the children of Israel is come
[49:23] unto me and I have also seen the
[49:25] oppression wherewith the egyp Egyptians
[49:27] oppressed them come now therefore and I
[49:29] will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou
[49:31] mayest bring forth my people the
[49:33] children of Israel out of Egypt and
[49:36] Moses said who am I that I should go
[49:39] unto pharaoh and that I should bring
[49:42] forth the children of Israel out of
[49:43] Egypt and he said certainly I will be
[49:46] with thee and this shall be a token unto
[49:49] thee that I have sent thee when thou
[49:52] Hast brought forth the people out of
[49:54] Egypt ye shall serve god of Upon This
[49:58] Mountain shall we bow our heads Heavenly
[50:01] Father we're so grateful to be assembled
[50:03] with Believers today we're so thankful
[50:06] to be in your house Lord and have the
[50:08] opportunity to worship you and now Lord
[50:10] we just pray as we come to this part of
[50:12] the service Lord we know that your word
[50:15] is spirit and Truth Lord we ask that you
[50:18] would break to us the bread of life this
[50:21] morning we pray Lord that you would walk
[50:23] up and down the aisles and minister to
[50:25] your people father I ask that you would
[50:27] watch over me and and Lord and Lord I
[50:30] pray that you would bind my lips before
[50:32] I would speak anything unpleasing to you
[50:34] and we'll commit it into your hands in
[50:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[50:40] and amen God bless you may be seated and
[50:43] the title of the message this morning is
[50:45] it's not how you start it's how you
[50:48] finish and if I could take a subject on
[50:50] that I would also say that your past
[50:53] does not dictate your future your past
[50:57] does not dictate your future and I I see
[51:00] this Saints and my feeling this morning
[51:02] is we got a couple of issues in the
[51:05] message that I feel like really hinder
[51:07] the children of God from going forward
[51:09] in God and and one of those is
[51:11] complacency and it's When people's been
[51:14] around for a while and they've been
[51:15] serving the lord for a while and they've
[51:16] loved the Lord for a while and they and
[51:18] they get kind of in a Groove where
[51:20] they're coming to church and they're and
[51:21] they're sing and they hear the word and
[51:23] they leave and they come and they start
[51:25] and things kind of start to settle down
[51:27] for them and things kind of become
[51:29] common to you and you just kind of it's
[51:31] just another Sunday or it's another
[51:32] Wednesday and and and that complacency
[51:35] kind of sets in and and Saints we just
[51:37] can't allow complacency to set into our
[51:41] lives because when you stop going
[51:43] forward you don't stay the same you
[51:45] start backsliding and so there's never a
[51:47] point in our life after 27 years of
[51:50] serving the lord now there's never a
[51:51] point in my life where I could say I've
[51:53] arrived and I'm I'm there and I'm good
[51:55] enough amen we got to constantly be
[51:58] traveling forward we got to be better
[52:00] tomorrow than we are today and we got to
[52:02] be better the next week as we are right
[52:04] now and if you see me next year I want
[52:05] to be a better man than I am today can
[52:07] you say Amen this
[52:09] morning and the other that I see that
[52:12] really holds the Church of God back is
[52:14] forgiveness Saints the Forgiveness not
[52:17] just forgiveness of others and if you've
[52:18] been around this message very long
[52:20] somebody's done you wrong all right
[52:22] somebody's somebody's hurt your feelings
[52:24] Brother David somebody's done something
[52:25] bad bad to you somebody's took advantage
[52:27] of you or somebody's lied on you or
[52:29] Something's Happened in your life and
[52:30] somebody's done you wrong some kind of
[52:32] way and you got to forgive them and you
[52:34] got to move on but the other thing you
[52:35] got to do Saints is you got to forgive
[52:37] yourself for when you've done wrong you
[52:40] got to you got to forgive yourself
[52:42] Saints you can't just keep holding on to
[52:45] the things that you done wrong that's
[52:46] all the if the devil can point you back
[52:48] at what you used to be say he got you
[52:50] you can't go forward if you're looking
[52:52] back and you and I'm here to tell you
[52:54] today saints that you passed don't
[52:56] dictate your
[52:59] future amen and it ain't how you start
[53:02] but it's how you finish and we find
[53:04] Moses here on the run on the back side
[53:07] of the desert and Moses had tried to do
[53:09] the right thing but he tried to do it
[53:11] the wrong way he tried to do the right
[53:13] thing and he failed because he took
[53:15] matters into his own hands and Moses
[53:17] knew that he was to be a deliverer
[53:19] brother Brown said he knew that he knew
[53:20] that he was supposed to deliver the
[53:22] children of Israel but but he took
[53:24] matters into his own hands he tried to
[53:25] do the right thing at the wrong time and
[53:27] the wrong way and he slew the Egyptian
[53:30] and he was out on the backs side of the
[53:31] desert and he was feeding his
[53:33] father-in-law's sheep and and we find
[53:35] that he probably thought he was just a
[53:37] total failure that he was all washed up
[53:39] that God couldn't use him no
[53:41] more yeah now is that right Saints and
[53:45] for 40 years he'd been sitting out there
[53:47] on the back side of the desert he hadn't
[53:49] even seen nothing of God all he seen is
[53:51] a bunch of sheep on the back side of the
[53:53] desert I don't know about the back side
[53:54] of the desert but I live on the front
[53:56] side of the desert and I can tell you
[53:57] it's pretty
[54:00] bare and that's where Moses found
[54:02] himself On The Backs side of the desert
[54:04] of failure amen and he probably thought
[54:08] he'd failed he probably thought God was
[54:10] done with him he probably thought there
[54:12] was nothing left for him but one day up
[54:14] on the side of the mountain he saw a
[54:15] bush that burned but the burning didn't
[54:18] burn it up and he walked up there and
[54:20] the bush spoke to him and said I am that
[54:23] I am amen and if he was the I am he's
[54:26] still the I am he's the I am this
[54:28] morning amen he's the I am tomorrow and
[54:31] he'll always be the I am present tense
[54:33] right now
[54:34] God and the I am told him you go down
[54:37] into Egypt and you tell them thus sayith
[54:40] the Lord the I am has sent you I like
[54:42] the sound of that Saints see sometimes
[54:45] that's the way we got to do it when we
[54:46] got to make our calling and our election
[54:49] sure and when the Devil comes in against
[54:51] us we can tell him the I am has sent me
[54:54] amen I'm going to church today because
[54:56] the I am has sent me amen I'm going to
[54:58] pay my bills today cuz the I am has sent
[55:01] me and the de the devil might tell you
[55:03] you can't get better he might tell
[55:04] you're not good enough but the I am has
[55:07] sent you
[55:08] Saints oh you're insufficient you're not
[55:11] smart enough you don't have the skills
[55:12] necessary but the I am has sent me
[55:16] today
[55:18] amen you ain't got enough money to put
[55:20] gas in the car but it's Church time well
[55:23] the I am has sent you
[55:27] amen and he said go tell the Elders of
[55:30] Israel together the Lord has visited you
[55:34] and said I will bring you up out of
[55:36] Egypt to a land flowing with milk and
[55:37] honey go pull them all together and tell
[55:41] them I sent you and then he said after
[55:43] you get done with that I want you to go
[55:44] right into Pharaoh's Palace and I want
[55:47] you to tell him that the Lord God of the
[55:49] Hebrews has met with you and said to let
[55:52] his people
[55:54] go amen
[55:57] the Lord told him just bust up in the
[55:58] middle of that party brother Joel just
[56:00] the the place that they're looking for
[56:02] you they he was a wanted man in Egypt he
[56:04] was on the run from the law he said go
[56:06] back down in there bust up right in the
[56:09] middle of that party and tell him the I
[56:11] am has sent you and you come to take
[56:16] over
[56:18] amen now I I used to try to sneak into
[56:21] parties when I was out in the world ones
[56:23] that I wasn't invited to you
[56:26] and you kind of go in
[56:28] lowkey you don't want nobody to notice
[56:30] you but that's not how the Lord did this
[56:32] he said March right up in the middle of
[56:34] it and tell them that I am have sent
[56:37] you oh and listen to this he said you
[56:40] ain't just going to tell him to let the
[56:41] people go but you're going to tell him
[56:43] we going to leave and we're going to
[56:45] take your stuff with us when we go
[56:48] that's right that's right now that's the
[56:51] god that we serve today see when you
[56:55] come through a tri you don't come out of
[56:57] it the same you come out of it
[57:00] better you come out of it with more than
[57:02] you went into it with you come out of it
[57:06] stronger with more faith you come out of
[57:08] it more season you come out of it with
[57:10] more knowledge you come through it
[57:12] better than you was when you
[57:14] started God's got a way of turning our
[57:17] trials into our greatest
[57:19] blessings amen so after he did
[57:24] that he said
[57:27] when you go
[57:28] down I'm sure the Lord told him when you
[57:33] go down and you tell them to let your
[57:37] people
[57:38] go I'm sure that he ain't going to do
[57:43] it see Saints it ain't never going to be
[57:48] easy it ain't never going to be easy and
[57:51] when you claim your healing
[57:53] today or you claim your deliverance
[57:55] today
[57:56] or you claim your family today it ain't
[57:59] going to be easy amen that God can
[58:03] miraculously heal you but sometimes
[58:04] you're going to claim your healing and
[58:06] you're going to limp every step you take
[58:08] waiting on God to fulfill the promise
[58:11] but he's still a Healer Saints sometimes
[58:14] you're going to claim your family and
[58:16] they going to get worse before they get
[58:18] better but that's not your business
[58:20] Saints it's your business to believe the
[58:23] word
[58:24] today yes sir
[58:27] come on somebody
[58:30] today

[58:35] man that had probably counted himself

[58:42] us maybe we think we wasted too much
[58:45] time maybe we think we have made too
[58:48] many mistakes maybe we think we we
[58:51] haven't done enough for the Lord maybe
[58:54] we think we've wasted our life life we

[59:05] desert and he hadn't even got started

[1:02:41] good that's
[1:02:43] good that's a past but that's not our
[1:02:51] future you say well I hadn't done
[1:02:53] nothing for the Lord yeah that might be
[1:02:56] true that you hadn't done nothing for
[1:02:58] the Lord
[1:03:01] yet but a past doesn't dictate our
[1:03:06] future but we got to start
[1:03:09] somewhere might be today might be in a
[1:03:12] service like this it might be theight
[1:03:14] when we get home might call all the kids
[1:03:17] together so you know what we hadn't done

[1:03:22] Bible tonight before we go to bed we're
[1:03:24] having prayer yeah tonight we're going
[1:03:27] to take 10 minutes and hear a little bit
[1:03:29] of a tape tonight we're going to do a
[1:03:32] little devotion might start in the
[1:03:34] morning you say I'm getting up early in
[1:03:36] the morning I hadn't read my Bible like
[1:03:38] I need to but I'm starting in the
[1:03:40] morning I'm getting up early I'm gonna
[1:03:42] get up before everybody else gets up and
[1:03:44] I'm going to read my
[1:03:46] Bible I'm G to pray I'm going to start
[1:03:51] today amen and it ain't how you start
[1:03:54] it's how you finish
[1:03:56] right amen don't look at your failures
[1:03:58] look at your election see God called you
[1:04:02] God predestinated you that's why you're
[1:04:04] here
[1:04:05] today you say no I'm here cuz Mama
[1:04:07] brought me no you're here cuz God called
[1:04:09] you here there's a reason for
[1:04:13] everything I'm just here to try to
[1:04:16] pacify my
[1:04:18] spouse I'm just here cuz Mom and Daddy
[1:04:20] said I should come no you're here cuz
[1:04:23] God called you here amen and if if he's
[1:04:26] called you he's got a reason for calling
[1:04:28] you he's got something for us to do he
[1:04:31] don't call us for no reason God's ways
[1:04:33] are perfect and we're CH children of God
[1:04:36] for a reason and we got a purpose and
[1:04:38] there's something that he has for us to
[1:04:41] do now is that right Saints right now
[1:04:45] Moses had been a failure up into that
[1:04:47] point but he hadn't even got started yet
[1:04:50] and I'll tell you this we'll never find
[1:04:52] our purpose as long as we're looking at
[1:04:54] our past right he said and what's set in
[1:04:57] your hand he said no matter what it is
[1:05:00] maybe you've been a failure as a
[1:05:01] Christian maybe you have failed to go on
[1:05:04] with God Moses failed uh down in Egypt
[1:05:08] when he was born to be a deliverer to
[1:05:10] bring the children of Israel out of
[1:05:11] Egypt why because he did it himself now
[1:05:13] anytime we try to do it ourself we're
[1:05:16] going to end up
[1:05:17] failures anytime we try to clean herself
[1:05:20] up we're going to be failures anytime we
[1:05:23] try to get good enough to come to church
[1:05:25] we're going to be failures but when God
[1:05:27] cleans it up it'll stay
[1:05:33] clean good and he
[1:05:36] said he said he took it upon himself to
[1:05:39] do it and anytime you take things upon
[1:05:41] yourself and leave God out you're going
[1:05:43] to be a failure like Moses was see we
[1:05:45] got to learn how to let go and let God
[1:05:48] handle stuff don't we you know David
[1:05:50] looked out one day and seen a giant on
[1:05:52] the other side and he wasn't scared of
[1:05:54] that giant he he said today about this
[1:05:56] time I'm going to take my sword and cut
[1:05:59] your head off of your
[1:06:02] neck your shoulders is going to be
[1:06:05] headless later on today he said today
[1:06:09] about this time the birds is going to be
[1:06:11] eating your
[1:06:14] carcass because the battle isn't mine
[1:06:18] the battle is the Lord's and Saints
[1:06:20] that's the attitude we got to have today
[1:06:22] the battles that we're fighting they're
[1:06:24] not ours they're the Lords we belong to
[1:06:26] him he's the one that fights the
[1:06:29] battles he's the one that takes care of
[1:06:32] the needs we can try to fix it our best
[1:06:35] we can try to do all we can but we will
[1:06:37] fail but he can't fail the battle isn't
[1:06:41] mine the battle is the
[1:06:44] Lords
[1:06:47] yes so Moses was being called to a
[1:06:49] little something higher the Lord spoke
[1:06:52] to him and he gave him a revelation out
[1:06:55] of this burning bush and
[1:06:58] immediately as soon as God called him as
[1:07:00] soon as God commissioned him immediately
[1:07:03] Moses starts questioning himself and his
[1:07:06] own human abilities he told to Lord I
[1:07:09] Lord I don't even know your name he said
[1:07:10] well the I am a sent me he he he said
[1:07:13] they won't believe that you appeared to
[1:07:14] me he he said they they won't believe
[1:07:16] that I talked to you he said he said I
[1:07:19] can't even talk good I can't I'm so glad
[1:07:21] today saints that you ain't got to be
[1:07:23] able to talk good to make it into heaven
[1:07:27] right I'm one of the few preachers on
[1:07:29] the on the trail today that they got to
[1:07:31] have a translator to translated into
[1:07:34] English and
[1:07:41] places but that's our attitude Saints
[1:07:43] I'm not as smart as that brother I'm I'm
[1:07:45] not as good as this other brother I I

[1:07:54] much my my family's not is in order that
[1:07:56] sister over there she's got it all
[1:08:00] together but Saint your past doesn't
[1:08:03] dictate your
[1:08:04] future see that was his past that was
[1:08:07] his mistakes that was doing all that
[1:08:09] talking and that's CA he's looking at
[1:08:11] the wrong thing I've read this to you
[1:08:13] before I want to read it again brother
[1:08:15] Brown says in Jehovah Gyra he said
[1:08:17] brother stop looking at yourself and
[1:08:19] look at your
[1:08:20] sacrifice he said if you can find any
[1:08:22] fault in that all right but if you find
[1:08:24] no fault in that then you are perfect
[1:08:27] let me ask you today Saints is your
[1:08:29] sacrifice perfect today is your
[1:08:31] sacrifice perfect is Jesus Christ
[1:08:34] perfect today then the prophet of God
[1:08:37] said if Christ is perfect you're perfect
[1:08:39] cuz he didn't accept you he said God
[1:08:41] accepted Christ and Christ accepted
[1:08:46] you and you don't have to be good enough
[1:08:49] he was good enough and he made the
[1:08:51] sacrifice for you he made the price pay
[1:08:54] that you couldn't pay
[1:08:56] pay amen and he says this he said and
[1:09:00] you're dead and your life is hidden God
[1:09:02] through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:04] and all the devils in hell can't turn
[1:09:06] you out of there for you are God's
[1:09:09] Property he
[1:09:11] said amen turn to your neighbor and say
[1:09:13] you've been bought with a
[1:09:16] price that was terrible turn to your
[1:09:18] neighbor and say you've been bought with
[1:09:21] a
[1:09:22] price you've been bought with a price
[1:09:24] brother Joel you've been bought with a
[1:09:26] price meaning you're God's Property
[1:09:29] meaning you belong to
[1:09:31] him meaning he's the one look if
[1:09:34] somebody messes with one of your kids
[1:09:37] they got to deal with
[1:09:39] you come on
[1:09:41] somebody are you too religious for all
[1:09:43] that if somebody messes with one of my
[1:09:46] kids they going to mess with me amen and
[1:09:50] you're a child of God today and the
[1:09:53] battle isn't yours the battle is the
[1:10:03] Lords it's not how you
[1:10:05] start it's how you finish and I might
[1:10:08] not have started very good I wasn't
[1:10:11] raised in this
[1:10:13] message I didn't come from a message
[1:10:15] home but by the grace of God I can
[1:10:18] finish
[1:10:20] today maybe your testimony is different
[1:10:24] but maybe you've made some mistakes
[1:10:26] maybe you maybe you've had a rocky road
[1:10:28] up into this point maybe it hadn't been
[1:10:30] a clean trajectory I'll tell you life
[1:10:32] ain't clean like that there's ups and
[1:10:35] there's downs and there's good times and
[1:10:37] there's bad times there's times where
[1:10:38] you're a better Christian than you are
[1:10:40] at
[1:10:40] others right you might not started the
[1:10:44] way you want to but you can finish this
[1:10:47] race
[1:10:49] today when Moses left that burning bush
[1:10:52] that day everything was different
[1:10:55] brother Brown said in believer's
[1:10:57] position in Christ he said Moses found
[1:10:59] out the real direct will of God and time
[1:11:03] of God and the revelation of everything
[1:11:05] to do he said now try to keep him out of
[1:11:08] Egypt he said right back to Egypt he
[1:11:11] went as hard as he could go for he knew
[1:11:13] that God had promised deliverance and
[1:11:16] the time had come for deliverance see
[1:11:18] when he left that burning bush Saints he
[1:11:20] walked different and he talked different
[1:11:23] and he acted different and the things
[1:11:24] coming out of his mouth was different he
[1:11:27] looked
[1:11:29] different amen and when you meet that
[1:11:31] Pillar of Fire Saints you ain't going to
[1:11:34] be the same when God gets a hold of you
[1:11:37] you're not going to look the same you're
[1:11:38] not going to talk the same you're not
[1:11:40] going to walk the same you're not going
[1:11:42] to the same places you used to go you're
[1:11:45] not going to do the same things you used
[1:11:47] to do when people look at you they going
[1:11:49] to say there's something different about
[1:11:51] that
[1:11:53] sister amen when I I gave my heart to
[1:11:56] the Lord all of my buddies left one by
[1:12:01] one I didn't run them off they just left
[1:12:06] on their
[1:12:07] own
[1:12:11] right Amen brother Brown used another
[1:12:15] example of St Paul and he said listen to
[1:12:18] this quote here from believer's position
[1:12:19] in Christ he says Paul not by desire not
[1:12:22] by choice not by the will of man or his
[1:12:24] own human human desires but by the will
[1:12:27] of God was an
[1:12:29] apostle Paul wasn't an apostle cuz he
[1:12:31] wanted to be he was an apostle because
[1:12:34] God wanted him to
[1:12:36] be he said we need some more like that
[1:12:40] by the will of
[1:12:41] God he said he was on his road to
[1:12:43] Damascus to arrest think of it was going
[1:12:47] to arrest the very group that he was
[1:12:50] sent to be an apostle
[1:12:52] of Amen Saints it ain't how you start
[1:12:55] it's how you finish amen it ain't ain't
[1:12:58] it ain't your past that dictates your
[1:13:01] future amen he said now he said now how
[1:13:04] upside down it looks to the human
[1:13:05] element that God does things just the
[1:13:08] very things that you think you won't do
[1:13:10] might be the things that you have to
[1:13:13] do let me read it again when God does
[1:13:17] things it might be the very things that
[1:13:19] you say I'm never going to do that you
[1:13:21] got to do
[1:13:26] right I'm so glad it wasn't how Paul
[1:13:28] started he might have not have started
[1:13:31] good he started out as an enemy of the
[1:13:33] church he started out witnessing the
[1:13:35] stoning of Steven holding the coats of
[1:13:38] those that stone him he started out with
[1:13:40] with papers to go put him in jail he
[1:13:42] started out as an enemy to the church
[1:13:45] but when he got done he could say I have
[1:13:47] fought a good fight I have finished my
[1:13:50] course and I have kept the faith it
[1:13:52] ain't how you start Saints it's how you
[1:13:54] finish to
[1:13:57] day the mistakes of his past didn't
[1:14:00] dictate his
[1:14:02] future
[1:14:04] right oh my so we see how important it
[1:14:08] is to Lo know the Lord's will for our
[1:14:10] life and we want to be found working on
[1:14:13] the right things we want to be found
[1:14:15] doing the things that God wants us to do
[1:14:18] we don't want to be working thinking
[1:14:19] we're doing something for God and it not
[1:14:21] be God's Will and see you can be sincere
[1:14:25] but be sincerely wrong is that right
[1:14:29] Saints I I've been there myself I I
[1:14:31] don't even agree with myself from five
[1:14:34] years
[1:14:37] ago but I was sincere five years ago I
[1:14:41] was sincere 10 years ago but I was
[1:14:44] sincerely
[1:14:49] wrong yes sir we can be sincere but we
[1:14:54] can be sincerely wrong see people like
[1:14:55] to talk about that people like when
[1:14:58] other people are wrong oh they're
[1:15:00] sincere over at that church they're just
[1:15:02] sincerely wrong we like it when we're
[1:15:05] right and everybody else is wrong it's
[1:15:08] easier it's easier to deal with when
[1:15:10] we're right amen you can say well they
[1:15:13] they they sincere over there but they're
[1:15:15] sincerely
[1:15:17] wrong but I want to present another side
[1:15:19] to it brother Brown said in taking sides
[1:15:22] with Jesus he said God is no respect of
[1:15:25] person and he said we see a person
[1:15:27] deeply and sincere he can be sincerely
[1:15:31] wrong but if he
[1:15:33] sincerely God will lead him to the light
[1:15:40] somewhere he'll come to it cuz God is
[1:15:44] obligated to do that Saints you don't
[1:15:48] you don't that's why we can't judge on
[1:15:49] nobody we don't know if they're sincere
[1:15:52] God is obligated they might not be right
[1:15:55] right now but if they're sincere right
[1:15:57] now God will lead them to the light
[1:16:02] somewhere right they might be tied up in
[1:16:05] a mess right now their Doctrine might be
[1:16:07] a wreck right now but if they'll be
[1:16:09] sincere God will lead them to the light
[1:16:11] that's what a prophet
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:14] said
[1:16:18] amen if they'll stay
[1:16:21] sincere so it also applies to us
[1:16:25] you think well I don't know if this is
[1:16:26] right or not I don't know if I'm doing
[1:16:28] the right thing or not I don't know if
[1:16:30] it's the will of God for my life or not
[1:16:32] just be
[1:16:33] sincere Amen brother Brown said you
[1:16:36] remain neutral to it you commit it to
[1:16:39] the Lord in prayer then you see how you
[1:16:42] feel
[1:16:43] led then you
[1:16:46] wait and then you see how you feel L
[1:16:50] wait a little bit
[1:16:52] more he said then you go
[1:16:56] and he said you've committed it to God
[1:16:57] in prayer and if you've committed it to
[1:17:00] God In Prayer he said you're doing the
[1:17:01] best you
[1:17:02] can what else can you do Saints you
[1:17:05] can't just sit around paralyzed and
[1:17:07] don't do nothing because you don't know
[1:17:08] if it's the will of the Lord
[1:17:09] tonight that's good enough for the devil
[1:17:11] right there oh I don't want to do this
[1:17:13] cuz I don't want to be wrong well then
[1:17:15] you ain't going to do
[1:17:16] nothing he said but if you do it in
[1:17:19] prayer and you be sincere he said Paul
[1:17:21] started out the wrong way and he got a
[1:17:24] Macedonian call the Lord corrected the
[1:17:28] error and if we we'll follow those steps
[1:17:31] and we commit Things To God In Prayer we
[1:17:33] don't have to worry about if it's the
[1:17:35] will of the Lord or not if the Lord
[1:17:36] knows that he can speak to you and
[1:17:38] you'll follow and Obey then he you can
[1:17:41] be sincere and he'll line he'll line you
[1:17:43] up with the word he'll line you up with
[1:17:45] the
[1:17:51] lights now the Bible tells us to seek
[1:17:54] you first the kingdom of God and all the
[1:17:57] rest of it be added to us but that goes
[1:18:00] against this carnal nature that goes
[1:18:03] against this flesh that we fight this
[1:18:05] flesh wants it to be easy this flesh
[1:18:08] wants to go the path of least
[1:18:10] resistance this path this this this
[1:18:12] flesh don't want to when you're tired it
[1:18:14] don't want to
[1:18:16] pray this flesh don't even want to come
[1:18:19] to church on Sunday
[1:18:21] morning oh come on somebody I got too
[1:18:24] religious today
[1:18:25] this flesh has got to be made to come to
[1:18:28] church amen this flesh now the spirit
[1:18:30] wants to come the spirit wants to come
[1:18:33] fellowship and the spirit wants to but
[1:18:35] my mom she's not a Believer but she's
[1:18:37] been coming to church here lately and
[1:18:38] she told me she said you know it's funny
[1:18:40] on Wednesday there's always some I never
[1:18:42] feel like going to church on
[1:18:44] Wednesday that's true right and she
[1:18:47] never
[1:18:50] will but we come
[1:18:53] anyways amen
[1:18:55] we bring this flesh into subjection to
[1:18:57] that
[1:18:58] word amen so this flesh is selfish this
[1:19:02] flesh is to take the path of least
[1:19:04] resistance this flesh it caters to its
[1:19:07] own Comfort that's the flesh that we
[1:19:09] fight every day amen and And We complain
[1:19:14] Saints about everything
[1:19:19] that's I'm not talking about this church
[1:19:21] I mean other churches
[1:19:26] we turn into a bunch of hbrd
[1:19:29] jellyfish cry babies Amy man it don't
[1:19:33] matter how fast McDonald's gets the

[1:20:22] work it'll fix all that
[1:20:29] I Went Down To Jamaica and they wasn't
[1:20:30] worried about the speed of the
[1:20:34] internet yes but that's the age that we
[1:20:37] live in Rich increased in goods and the
[1:20:41] people today in this age they feel like
[1:20:43] they deserve something that they haven't
[1:20:46] earned they feel like they should be
[1:20:48] handed something a participation trophy
[1:20:52] amen you showed up good job
[1:20:56] amen feel like you deserve something
[1:20:58] feel like if they got a certain degree
[1:21:00] they should get a certain job well that
[1:21:03] that degree don't matter if you're

[1:21:13] bum with a
[1:21:16] degree they want somebody to show up for
[1:21:18] work don't

[1:21:39] hand in there
[1:21:44] though living in a basement with
[1:21:46] Pringles all over the
[1:21:48] belly that's the age that we live
[1:21:51] in other people keeping them up getting
[1:21:55] a check from the government not working
[1:21:58] and they feel fine about
[1:22:00] that right and they love to talk about
[1:22:03] their
[1:22:04] rights they feel like they got a
[1:22:07] right they feel like they owed
[1:22:10] something amen and even in religion
[1:22:12] people want him to be a savior but they
[1:22:15] don't want him to be their
[1:22:17] Lord but we got to Forfeit our
[1:22:21] rights now let me let me pull over here
[1:22:23] for a minute
[1:22:26] we we got to Forfeit our
[1:22:28] rights but I had a brother I called him
[1:22:31] asked him to preach for me one day he

[1:24:10] spit in his face and tell him I don't
[1:24:12] want
[1:24:16] them but we do forfeit our rights to the
[1:24:19] things of this
[1:24:20] world and we can't let a spirit of
[1:24:23] entitlement bleed over into our churches
[1:24:25] right we can't don't ever let it get to
[1:24:28] be I'm the one that should be doing this
[1:24:31] or that I'm the best piano player I

[1:26:43] right that's what's a matter with the
[1:26:45] church today and the great majority that
[1:26:47] the gentleness of the Lamb of God we're
[1:26:49] supposed to be
[1:26:50] lambs and we become everything else but
[1:26:53] Lambs
[1:26:55] and that's the reason as soon as we get
[1:26:57] that attitude the dove of the Holy
[1:26:59] Spirit takes her
[1:27:02] flight Saints I don't ever want to be
[1:27:04] the kind of Minister that argues over
[1:27:05] who gets a Saturday night
[1:27:08] service what does it
[1:27:11] matter what's a matter who preaches when
[1:27:14] Saints if our attitude is there to help
[1:27:17] the people it doesn't matter when we get
[1:27:18] the
[1:27:22] opportunity right so we've been in the
[1:27:24] message long enough somebody's going to
[1:27:25] do us wrong and if we get concerned
[1:27:28] about
[1:27:29] retribution if we get concerned about
[1:27:31] getting
[1:27:32] even you're
[1:27:35] derailed forgive those people and go
[1:27:38] on that's why the Lord said vengeance is
[1:27:41] mine sayith the Lord let him take care
[1:27:43] of all that we just forgive them go on
[1:27:46] you say well I I got to be asked to
[1:27:47] forgive them you don't have to have
[1:27:48] somebody to ask you to forgive them you
[1:27:51] can forgive them and move on cuz it's
[1:27:53] holding you back
[1:27:56] right let the Lord take care of that
[1:27:59] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord amen I
[1:28:02] like that amen paper back there in the
[1:28:04] sound
[1:28:08] booth another great example of how to
[1:28:10] finish was in first Kings Elijah was at
[1:28:13] the brook cherith and the Ravens was
[1:28:15] feeding him and the brook dried up and
[1:28:17] the Lord sent him down to zarap and he
[1:28:19] told him I have commanded a widow woman
[1:28:22] there to sustain thee now I want you to
[1:28:25] notice saints that when the Lord told
[1:28:26] Elijah that that widow woman didn't know
[1:28:28] a thing about
[1:28:31] it he said go down to zarapa I've
[1:28:34] commanded a widow woman to feed you now
[1:28:36] that widow woman didn't know a thing
[1:28:38] about feeding
[1:28:40] Elijah now see I want you to notice
[1:28:42] saints that even in the midst of her
[1:28:43] greatest trial God had already
[1:28:46] predetermined to bless
[1:28:49] her in her greatest trial God had
[1:28:51] already determined that she was going to
[1:28:53] win
[1:28:54] in and Saints that's what you and I also
[1:28:57] I read the back of the book and we win
[1:29:00] you're already determined to be an
[1:29:08] overcomer
[1:29:11] right God had already determined
[1:29:14] it so he goes down to
[1:29:18] zarapa and he sees the little woman
[1:29:20] Gathering sticks and he said get me
[1:29:23] something to drink
[1:29:25] and she went to get it and he said also
[1:29:27] bring me a little
[1:29:29] cake and she said as the Lord God liveth
[1:29:32] I only got this handful of meal and this
[1:29:34] little Cru of oil I was going to make
[1:29:37] some for me and I was going to make some
[1:29:38] for my son and we going to eat that and
[1:29:43] die now Saints if you ain't been there
[1:29:46] you're probably going to come
[1:29:48] there there's times in our life we're
[1:29:50] that low it ain't all mountaintops Serv
[1:29:54] in the Lord there good times and there
[1:29:56] bad times there tough
[1:29:59] times she was in the middle of her
[1:30:01] greatest
[1:30:04] trial but she had to seek first the
[1:30:07] kingdom of
[1:30:11] God and she went and did what the
[1:30:13] prophet said and the Bible said that
[1:30:17] that barrel of Mill wasted
[1:30:20] not neither did the Cru all fail
[1:30:24] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:30:25] he spake by
[1:30:27] Elijah and Saints I'm here to tell you
[1:30:29] today if we'll follow the sayings of
[1:30:31] Elijah we got plenty to eat on today
[1:30:34] too there's 1,200 barrels a meal there
[1:30:38] ain't no famine in the land of the
[1:30:40] church there's no famine in the bride
[1:30:42] there's a famine out there for the
[1:30:44] hearing of the word but the bride has
[1:30:46] got plenty to eat today there ain't no
[1:30:49] empty cruises of all there's no lacking
[1:30:51] of the spirit today the bride has
[1:30:57] plenty now the little woman she did she
[1:31:00] have to give her last cake away no but
[1:31:03] she had to be willing to give her last
[1:31:05] cake
[1:31:09] away now this little woman started out
[1:31:11] pretty rough but she finished
[1:31:15] well but we can't hold nothing back can
[1:31:19] we this the very things brother Brown
[1:31:21] said that you think you won't do that
[1:31:24] may be the very things that you have to
[1:31:28] do I'm so glad it's not how we start but
[1:31:32] how we finish I'm so glad that my past
[1:31:36] doesn't have to dictate my future I'm
[1:31:39] I'm so glad that the things that I've
[1:31:41] done wrong in my life don't stop me from
[1:31:45] achieving the purpose that God has set
[1:31:47] for me you know when Moses messed up he
[1:31:50] was still the deliverer
[1:31:54] right when Moses was a failure he was
[1:31:57] still the
[1:31:59] deliverer and when you mess up you're
[1:32:01] still a Christian today and when you
[1:32:03] when you fail you're still part of the
[1:32:05] Bride
[1:32:07] today and you still got a purpose and
[1:32:09] you still got something that you will
[1:32:13] accomplish because your past doesn't
[1:32:16] dictate your
[1:32:19] future but when we look at our lives we
[1:32:21] see it's clearly all about priorities
[1:32:24] many times we say we won't help but
[1:32:27] there'll be certain areas of our life
[1:32:29] that we're not willing to put out on the
[1:32:32] table we say oh Lord I want to be closer
[1:32:34] to you I want to do more for you I I
[1:32:38] don't want to deal with these struggles
[1:32:39] anymore but but to some part of our life
[1:32:42] we're not willing to give
[1:32:44] up it's different for
[1:32:46] everybody every one of us has got things
[1:32:48] that we're wanting to hold back we don't
[1:32:50] want to let the Lord have
[1:32:51] it maybe it's a job
[1:32:54] many people you finally get a good job
[1:32:56] you finally start earning a little bit
[1:32:58] of
[1:32:59] money but then it keeps you out of the
[1:33:01] house of the Lord on Sunday or you can't
[1:33:04] make it on Wednesday you can't make it
[1:33:06] regular like you used to you said well I
[1:33:09] Lord I'd like to be closer to you I
[1:33:10] don't feel like I feel backslid I don't
[1:33:12] feel like I'm as close to you as I need
[1:33:13] to be well you're not at church like you
[1:33:15] need to
[1:33:16] be but you're not willing to put that on
[1:33:18] the table Saints I'd rather have less
[1:33:21] money and more blessing all right
[1:33:25] yes maybe it's some kind of hobby or
[1:33:27] some kind of habit that we got and it's
[1:33:30] obviously no good for us see Saints
[1:33:33] there's not inherently things that's
[1:33:34] good or bad but there's spirits on
[1:33:36] everything and no matter what it is you
[1:33:39] can let it get a hold of you no matter
[1:33:41] what it is it carries the spirit if you
[1:33:45] watch somebody and there there ain't
[1:33:47] nothing I'm not saying I'm not preaching
[1:33:48] against this well if you watch people
[1:33:51] sometimes they'll go out and get them a
[1:33:52] motorcycle
[1:33:54] but it don't stop with the
[1:33:56] motorcycle you got to get the
[1:33:59] boots and you got to get the belt buckle
[1:34:02] you got to get the jacket and you got to
[1:34:05] get the
[1:34:07] beard oh not in this church I
[1:34:13] know or maybe it's hunting and fishing
[1:34:16] sometimes
[1:34:18] uhoh I'm in Hardy Arkansas ain't
[1:34:21] I said well brother Brown hunting and
[1:34:24] fishing well there's nothing wrong with
[1:34:25] hunting and fishing but you can do it
[1:34:26] too much if it gets to be too much of a
[1:34:29] priority where you'd rather do that than
[1:34:31] anything
[1:34:32] else is that right Saints ain't nothing
[1:34:34] wrong with Hunting Fishing there nothing
[1:34:36] wrong with riding a motorcycle but
[1:34:38] anything can become an idol to you amen
[1:34:42] sometimes it's a phone or or some kind
[1:34:44] of video game or oh my people won't talk
[1:34:48] to their kids cuz they're busy on the
[1:34:50] phone they're living their life through
[1:34:52] social media something like that there's
[1:34:54] nothing wrong with any of those things
[1:34:56] but all of it can get a hold of
[1:34:58] us amen maybe we having trouble making
[1:35:02] ends meet because we got all kinds of
[1:35:05] stuff amen maybe we got a boat and a
[1:35:07] camper and all this other stuff but we
[1:35:09] ain't got time to use it because we got
[1:35:10] to work all this overtime to pay for
[1:35:16] it we can't get to church like we need
[1:35:18] to we don't see our family like we need
[1:35:20] to and we're not willing to let it go
[1:35:27] man that's got hard preaching didn't
[1:35:31] it amen I'd rather let my family be
[1:35:36] blessed than to have some more
[1:35:42] stuff let's have the musicians come
[1:35:45] maybe it's some kind of worldly
[1:35:49] fashion you know what's not pleasing of
[1:35:51] a child of God but it's it's hard to let
[1:35:54] go of you know I'm seeing worldism creep
[1:35:57] into our
[1:35:58] message I'm seeing the things that
[1:36:00] brother Brandon preached against and
[1:36:02] they've got to be common
[1:36:04] place well Saints we don't we don't
[1:36:06] raise the we don't raise the bar up
[1:36:08] because sin's abounded the standard is
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:12] standard what was wrong when brother
[1:36:14] Brandon preached it is wrong
[1:36:16] today is that right Saints but it's got
[1:36:19] to be something whatever it is that's
[1:36:21] sucking the life out of us we got to be
[1:36:24] willing to put that out on the
[1:36:26] table and we don't let sit around and
[1:36:28] mope over that oh I've made so many
[1:36:30] mistakes I've done so many things wrong
[1:36:31] no that's our
[1:36:34] past but it can't dictate our future and
[1:36:37] you might not have started like you want
[1:36:39] to but you don't have to finish that
[1:36:41] way I'll tell you like this Jesus is
[1:36:44] worth everything that we're afraid of
[1:36:47] losing he's worth
[1:36:49] everything that we're afraid of losing
[1:36:52] can we just play he's worth everything
[1:36:54] you scared all if I give up this job I
[1:36:57] don't know what that's going to do if I
[1:36:59] get rid of this stuff in my life I don't
[1:37:01] know what that's going to do I I if I if
[1:37:04] I can't do this if I can't do that if I
[1:37:06] can't if I can't dress this way or dress
[1:37:08] that way if I can't do this or that I
[1:37:11] don't know what that's going to do he's
[1:37:12] worth everything right that we're afraid
[1:37:14] of
[1:37:15] losing but we got to put it all on the
[1:37:18] table for him today can we bow our heads
[1:37:23] sometimes God will require us to do the
[1:37:25] things that we didn't want to
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:29] do sometimes he requires us the things
[1:37:32] we said we'd never do might be the
[1:37:35] things we have to
[1:37:38] do sometimes we might have to praise him
[1:37:41] when we don't feel like it we might
[1:37:43] worship him when we don't feel like
[1:37:45] it we might we might have to get out of
[1:37:48] our comfort zone in our worship we might
[1:37:51] have to get out of our comfort zone in
[1:37:52] our prayer life life we might have to
[1:37:55] get out I'm going tell you like this
[1:37:56] Saints when it comes to worshiping the
[1:37:58] Lord God didn't halfway save us and I'm
[1:38:01] not going to halfway worship him he
[1:38:03] didn't halfway Deliver Us and I don't
[1:38:05] want to halfway praise
[1:38:07] him he gave it all for me and I want to
[1:38:11] give it all for him today if that's your
[1:38:14] desire just let the Lord know Lord I
[1:38:16] hadn't started good but I want to finish
[1:38:19] well I I've made mistakes in my past
[1:38:24] but I don't want it to dictate my future
[1:38:26] I've went all this time maybe I've been
[1:38:28] a failure maybe I've come up short amen
[1:38:31] but Moses was 80 years old and he was
[1:38:33] just getting started let me just be
[1:38:35] getting started Lord give me the chance

[1:38:39] opportunity today give me the O option

[1:45:35] youngest daughter there's with us and
[1:45:37] good to have all of them with us this
[1:45:38] morning we're going to do something we
[1:45:40] do this every year before the kids go
[1:45:41] back to school if you're a kid that's
[1:45:43] going to school home school public
[1:45:45] school wherever you're going if you want
[1:45:47] to just come on up to the front here for
[1:45:48] a few minutes and and uh parents can
[1:45:51] come if they want to if you're a school
[1:45:52] teacher I encourage you to come as well
[1:45:54] and just come on up here and gather
[1:45:55] around the front and we're going to pray
[1:45:57] with you before you go back anden this
[1:45:59] is a hard time to go to school it's a
[1:46:01] hard time on our kids and and it doesn't
[1:46:03] matter if you're public schooled or
[1:46:04] homeschooled the devil's going to find
[1:46:06] you wherever you are and he's going to
[1:46:08] try to get you and he's going to try to
[1:46:11] hurt our young people because if there
[1:46:12] is a future this is our future and I'd
[1:46:16] say it's not just our future but this is
[1:46:17] the present church that we have today if
[1:46:20] you look around we've got a lot of kids
[1:46:22] here and and we're thankful for every
[1:46:23] one of them but the devil would like to

[1:46:27] to hinder the Revival that's going on in
[1:46:29] young people so if you if you do go to
[1:46:31] school or if you're a teacher just come
[1:46:32] on up here in the front and and I want
