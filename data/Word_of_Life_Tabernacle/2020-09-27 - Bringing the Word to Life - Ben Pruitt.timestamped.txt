[33:11] reason
[33:12] amen and so we appreciate all of you
[33:14] appreciate our visitors today and
[33:16] different ones that are here and those
[33:18] many that are streaming still today and
[33:21] i pray that the lord would bless you
[33:22] richly wednesday night sister kledith
[33:25] had
[33:27] brother had told about sister mary being
[33:32] the growth not being finding more cancer
[33:34] and that was wonderful
[33:36] but there was a testimony wednesday
[33:38] night sister cletus had
[33:39] asked for prayer the previous wednesday
[33:42] for her eye
[33:43] i believe there was a little growth on
[33:44] her eye and and she said wednesday night
[33:46] as of wednesday night anyway that had
[33:48] disappeared
[33:49] and so we thank the lord for that i
[33:51] think god
[33:52] amen give him a hand
[33:56] god allows us to have these things so we
[33:59] know he is still a healer
[34:01] he's still a healer and so in spite of
[34:04] everything that's going on we know he's
[34:05] still god
[34:06] amen and the effectual fervent prayer of
[34:09] a righteous man still availeth much
[34:12] hey man why because he's still on the
[34:14] throne not because the man is
[34:16] righteous but because he is on his
[34:18] throne and amen john 6 63 it is the
[34:20] spirit that quickeneth
[34:22] or makes alive the flesh profiteth
[34:25] nothing
[34:26] the words that i speak unto you they are
[34:28] spirit
[34:30] and they are life i pray lord without
[34:32] his blessing to the word this
[34:34] morning you may be seated
[34:40] i'm just a little bit distracted because
[34:43] i i feel this
[34:45] burden this morning for what i'm going
[34:46] to say and i want to make sure that i'm
[34:48] clear
[34:49] in what i'm saying you know it's because
[34:53] of the message of the hour that we
[34:56] know that the word is of utmost
[34:58] importance in our lives
[35:00] right you know everybody can
[35:04] stress certain things and you look at
[35:06] the denominational world today and
[35:08] they stress uh social outreach or
[35:11] or um they stress uh help helping people
[35:14] and that's good
[35:16] we want to help people as well every
[35:18] every opportunity that we get we want to
[35:19] help people but
[35:21] at the same time we realize that the
[35:23] most important thing is the word
[35:26] right and so now uh and even our
[35:30] services are structured that way where
[35:31] the word takes up the majority
[35:33] of our services because we know that the
[35:35] word is so powerful and so important
[35:38] and brother branham tells us that in the
[35:39] church age book he said i wonder
[35:41] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[35:44] the word in our midst
[35:47] and i want you to think about the word
[35:48] this morning and we'll read some more of
[35:50] this quote but
[35:51] i want you to think about the word is
[35:52] more than just a
[35:54] speech but the word is a person
[35:59] the word is a person and he's alive
[36:04] right he's alive the word is the person
[36:06] who is alive and
[36:07] and so you can't remove the life from
[36:11] the word
[36:12] right because the flesh prophet is
[36:14] nothing but he said the words that i
[36:16] speak unto you they are
[36:17] spirit and they are life now brother
[36:20] bible says let me give you a thought
[36:21] here how do we pray
[36:23] he said we pray in jesus name don't we
[36:25] he said every prayer
[36:26] is in his name where there isn't any
[36:28] answer he said yet in first john 5 14 we
[36:32] are told this
[36:33] is the confidence that we have in him so
[36:36] here's the confidence that we have
[36:38] he says that if we ask anything
[36:39] according to his will
[36:41] he heareth us so he said this is the
[36:44] confidence we have is in asking
[36:46] according to his will
[36:47] well how do we know we're asking
[36:49] according to his will
[36:51] right and so he said that we have
[36:52] confidence when we know we're asking
[36:54] according to his will
[36:56] it says he heareth us and if we know
[36:58] that he hear us
[36:59] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[37:02] the petitions that we desired of him
[37:06] he said now we ask what is the will of
[37:08] god there's only one way to know his
[37:10] will and that is by the word of god
[37:13] so you might say this morning well if
[37:16] it's god's will i want to be healed
[37:18] well it is god's will right
[37:21] and when you pray for healing you always
[37:23] pray according to the will of god
[37:25] there are certain things that are in the
[37:27] word of god that are the will of god
[37:30] now you you may or may not receive your
[37:34] healing in this life
[37:35] you may be healed here you may be healed
[37:37] over there but you're going to be healed
[37:40] god's word is is calls for healing and
[37:43] so
[37:44] he said i'm the god that healeth all
[37:45] your diseases so now what is the will of
[37:47] god only one way to know his will and
[37:49] that is by the word of god
[37:51] lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth
[37:54] and it cometh to pass
[37:55] when the lord commandeth it not so if
[37:58] the lord didn't command it if the lord
[38:00] didn't will it it won't come to pass
[38:02] he said there it is if it isn't in the
[38:04] word you can't have it
[38:06] that'd be a good lesson for us to learn
[38:08] wouldn't it if it isn't
[38:10] in the word you can't have it and so he
[38:13] says
[38:14] and he said so we can't ask unless it's
[38:16] in the word and we can't petition or ask
[38:18] unless
[38:19] it's in his name he said there it is
[38:21] again jesus the name
[38:23] is the word will you can't separate god
[38:26] in the word there won
[38:29] all right now he said now then this word
[38:32] he is left behind
[38:33] on the printed page is a part of him
[38:36] right it's a part of him when you accept
[38:39] it by faith
[38:41] into a spirit-filled life
[38:44] right that's when it's a part of him is
[38:47] when you accept it by faith into a
[38:48] spirit-filled life
[38:49] he said that his word was life and
[38:51] because this is just
[38:53] ink and paper right it's just a book
[38:58] there's a lot of other books you could
[39:00] take the same paper and print any other
[39:01] kind of book on it
[39:03] but it's the words becoming life that
[39:06] make a difference
[39:07] now so there he said and you can't
[39:10] separate that now
[39:11] he said that his word was life in john 6
[39:13] 63 but that is exactly what he is
[39:16] because he says i am the way the truth
[39:18] and the life
[39:19] and if any man have not the spirit of
[39:21] christ he is none of his he said there
[39:23] it is he is spirit and he is life
[39:25] he said that is exactly what the word is
[39:28] that is exactly what jesus is he is the
[39:31] word
[39:32] listen so when a spirit-born
[39:34] spirit-filled man
[39:35] in faith takes that word into his heart
[39:38] and places it upon his lips
[39:40] he said why that is the same as deity
[39:43] speaking
[39:45] the same as if god spoke now he says
[39:48] every mountain has to go i wonder if we
[39:52] if we're sufficiently impressed with
[39:54] that today
[39:56] are we sufficiently impressed with the
[39:58] fact that when we take the word of god
[40:01] as a spirit-filled
[40:03] spirit-born uh son or daughter of god we
[40:06] take the word into our heart and place
[40:07] it on our lips
[40:08] that's the same as deity speaking and
[40:11] every mountain has to go he said
[40:13] satan cannot stand before that man
[40:17] aren't you glad you serve a god like
[40:18] that
[40:21] now so i want to show you and i want i
[40:23] titled this this morning
[40:24] bringing the word to life because i want
[40:27] to show you that
[40:28] the holy ghost or the spirit and the
[40:29] word are one of the same
[40:31] in the sense that you can't separate the
[40:33] two
[40:35] because if you separate the two you have
[40:36] something that's not what was at the
[40:38] beginning
[40:39] you have something that's not original
[40:41] something hybrid
[40:43] now so jesus said the words that i speak
[40:46] unto you they are spirit in their life
[40:47] and
[40:48] i want us to think about that what's the
[40:50] difference between the word and the
[40:51] spirit can you have one without the
[40:53] other
[40:54] and as i said i've made plain to you
[40:56] that i believe that you can't separate
[40:58] the two
[40:59] though people attempt to do that and
[41:01] they say i have the word but if you had
[41:03] the real word you'd have the spirit you
[41:06] say i have the spirit but if you had the
[41:07] real spirit you'd have the word
[41:10] right and so that's why brother branham
[41:11] talked about a person says i'm full of
[41:12] the holy ghost but
[41:13] there's certain things you won't believe
[41:15] or obey in the word
[41:16] how can you reconcile those two things
[41:19] because the holy spirit will only
[41:21] anoint the word now now he
[41:24] said in the beginning it was not so now
[41:27] in genesis 1 and 1 it says in the
[41:30] beginning god
[41:31] created the heaven and the earth the
[41:34] earth was without form and void and
[41:36] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[41:37] and the spirit of god
[41:39] moved upon the face of the waters the
[41:42] spirit of god and that word
[41:44] moved is brooded he brooded over the
[41:47] face of the waters
[41:49] the spirit of god brooded like a
[41:52] a bird would in a nest over the
[41:56] upon the face of the waters
[41:59] and god said let there be light and
[42:01] there was light now
[42:03] the spirit of god was the word of god
[42:08] because it's the logos that come from
[42:10] god
[42:11] and the spirit of god brooded on the
[42:14] face of the waters
[42:16] and god said let there be light
[42:19] huh so the spirit spoke the word
[42:23] and when he did it brought it to life
[42:27] and life is what we need more than
[42:29] anything else
[42:31] we need that that vitality that life of
[42:34] god because
[42:35] in our own life we'll mess up
[42:38] sure we will our flesh profiteth nothing
[42:41] if jesus could say that about his flesh
[42:45] huh what about ours he was the virgin
[42:48] born son of god what about ours
[42:50] huh that was born in sin shaping and
[42:52] iniquity he said the flesh
[42:54] profiteth nothing paul puts it this way
[42:56] he says oh wretched man that i
[42:58] am so it takes life
[43:01] brother brown says if i had the spirit
[43:02] of beethoven in me he said
[43:04] i'd write songs i'd write music why
[43:06] because that's what beethoven did
[43:09] he had that that nature he had that that
[43:11] those potentials to write music
[43:13] so that's what i would do because i'd
[43:15] have his spirit and if i had the spirit
[43:17] of christ in me what would i do
[43:19] i'd do the works of christ right and so
[43:23] the spirit and the word
[43:25] come together and bring to life
[43:28] bring life into the written word now
[43:32] brother brown says he was god the logos
[43:35] the word that went out of god
[43:37] he said when it began to brood upon the
[43:39] earth and it brought forth marine life
[43:42] he said when the spirit of god the logos
[43:45] the word which god said let there be
[43:47] there went the logos which is the word
[43:50] now he takes it from john 1
[43:52] 1. in the beginning was the word word
[43:54] was with god and the word was god
[43:57] right the word was made flesh and dwelt
[43:59] among us he says later so
[44:01] so we know that the word was the logos
[44:05] which brooded over the earth but the
[44:07] bible says that the spirit of god
[44:10] moved on the face of the waters you see
[44:13] you can't separate the two
[44:16] right you can't separate the two you
[44:18] can't say well i
[44:19] i don't follow the word but i believe i
[44:21] have the holy ghost
[44:23] or you can't say i i have all the word
[44:25] but not have the holy ghost
[44:27] the two are the same are you with me now
[44:32] it's the same god now and
[44:35] he says there went the logos which is
[44:37] the word and the word begin to he said
[44:38] because all this was in the logos
[44:41] he said the whole word of god the whole
[44:43] bible
[44:44] for every age
[44:47] think about that the whole bible for
[44:49] every age was in the logos and as the
[44:51] logos began to breathe upon the earth
[44:54] he said there came marine life and
[44:56] building up bird life on up to animal
[44:58] life
[44:59] finally there came something in the
[45:00] representation or looked like the thing
[45:03] that was brewing it brooding over it god
[45:06] a man in the very image of god
[45:09] he said that man fell like the seed has
[45:11] to fall
[45:12] and then god began to brood over that
[45:14] after the fall
[45:16] he brought up a enoch he brought up
[45:18] elijah
[45:19] he brought up a moses he brought up
[45:20] prophet after prophet
[45:22] trying to restore that image again and
[45:25] finally upon the earth came the genuine
[45:27] image of god himself again which was god
[45:29] the logos
[45:30] made flesh and dwelt among us he said
[45:33] now that same logos has a part
[45:35] he's got to be a bride and the same he's
[45:38] got a bride
[45:39] he said and the same logos this word
[45:41] that cannot be tampered with
[45:43] is brooding over the churches today
[45:47] amen then people people just
[45:50] misunderstand they say well the pillar
[45:52] of fire is gone
[45:53] well that vindication of a prophet was
[45:56] one thing but we have the brooding of
[45:57] the holy spirit over the church
[45:59] we have to or there's no life
[46:03] right if the spirit cannot brood over
[46:05] the church there's no life
[46:07] so that logos that that word is still
[46:10] in the churches today brooding over the
[46:12] churches today trying to bring back the
[46:14] word
[46:15] to its full manifestation
[46:18] amen now
[46:21] whenever so whenever you see what seems
[46:23] to be a move of the spirit
[46:25] but it doesn't agree with the word
[46:28] or whenever you see what seems to be the
[46:31] word
[46:32] but it doesn't have any life in it it
[46:35] wasn't so from the beginning
[46:38] right because that was christ the logos
[46:40] the anointed word
[46:42] all right that's how he works in the
[46:44] church and that's what we have since the
[46:46] day of pentecost is christ among us now
[46:49] look it's a hybrid
[46:53] satan has perverted it from the original
[46:56] it's
[46:56] like a mule right and brother brown talk
[47:00] tells us a lot about mules
[47:02] mule has characteristics he
[47:05] he's stubborn i don't know how many of
[47:09] you have ever been around mules i've not
[47:10] been around very much but the times that
[47:12] i have you know you've seen that a mule
[47:13] has a reputation for being stubborn
[47:16] he's untrustworthy they say that a mule
[47:19] will
[47:19] wait his whole life to to kick you one
[47:22] time
[47:25] he's never tamed completely he'd just
[47:28] sit there and wait by this time so he
[47:30] can kick and mules can kick sideways
[47:33] just characteristic of a mule so they
[47:36] can hurt people
[47:37] that shouldn't you know wouldn't be able
[47:39] to be hurt by a horse
[47:41] and the mule is a hard worker and
[47:44] brother branham taught us that you can
[47:45] go find these things in the message i
[47:47] didn't bring all these quotes because
[47:48] we'd be here for hours but
[47:50] but brother branham talks about how that
[47:52] mule is a hard worker
[47:54] and he outworks the horse he outworks
[47:56] the donkey
[47:57] he just works constantly but he's
[48:01] stubborn
[48:02] and he can't reproduce
[48:06] he can't he can't reproduce himself
[48:08] again
[48:09] he is the product of something now he
[48:12] has some characteristics of the horse
[48:15] he has some characteristics of the
[48:16] donkey but he can't reproduce either one
[48:20] you can't take a mule and make a donkey
[48:22] you can't take a mule and make a horse
[48:24] and you can't take a mule and make a
[48:25] mule
[48:27] right he's the product of the
[48:29] intervention of man
[48:32] are you with me now he wasn't so from
[48:35] the beginning
[48:38] he has the word without the spirit or
[48:39] the spirit without the word
[48:41] he he's what we would call a
[48:43] denominational system he just can't get
[48:45] it all together
[48:47] he's the offspring of a male donkey and
[48:49] a female horse
[48:51] so no matter how much he looks like a
[48:52] horse his daddy is still a donkey
[48:57] right now
[49:00] you know something interesting about
[49:01] mules that i found out is they eat less
[49:03] than horses
[49:05] and people like to keep them because of
[49:07] that because they eat less
[49:10] that's true of mule believers too
[49:15] uh-huh and there are certain scriptures
[49:18] as i said because of the mule's
[49:19] characteristics
[49:20] that the mule can't fulfill look at
[49:22] genesis chapter 1 and verse 24
[49:25] god said let the earth bring forth the
[49:26] living creature after his kind
[49:29] huh let the earth bring forth the living
[49:31] creature after his kind
[49:33] cattle and creeping thing and beasts of
[49:34] the earth after his kind
[49:37] and it was so and the mule says i can't
[49:40] bring forth after my kind
[49:42] and so the mule is stuck in a constant
[49:45] state of being unable to fulfill the
[49:46] word of god
[49:49] so he just changes the rules
[49:52] are you with me now uh and this is a
[49:55] problem and go back and listen to
[49:57] brother branham as he is he talks to the
[49:58] pentecostal church and why is it so hard
[50:00] to live a christian life why some people
[50:02] can't
[50:03] seem to keep the victory all the sermons
[50:05] that brother brown preached about that
[50:06] and
[50:06] the word that was brought to us what's
[50:07] he trying to tell them there was emotion
[50:10] but no life
[50:11] or there was fundamentalism but no life
[50:14] and so the churches could only produce
[50:16] more churches there's nothing
[50:17] they couldn't do what god said do they
[50:20] could not bring forth
[50:21] after their kind they just all they
[50:23] could produce was more mules
[50:26] which is a combination of
[50:29] good and evil now
[50:33] the mule can't do that he says i know
[50:36] what the word says
[50:39] but but you don't realize i can't do it
[50:43] huh
[50:46] well it just makes you dig down don't it
[50:50] aren't you glad that you didn't you're
[50:53] not the product of a man's intervention
[50:56] right because if you were if all you
[50:58] have is so what some man told you to be
[51:01] if all you are is what somebody made you
[51:03] if i could
[51:04] form you as a pastor and preach you up
[51:07] and and bring you down make you into
[51:08] something that resembled me
[51:10] all you'd be is a mule right if i could
[51:13] take my ideas
[51:14] and put them with the message of the
[51:16] hour and somehow put that that
[51:18] together and make something out of you
[51:20] it's a mule
[51:22] huh if a pastor could take whatever
[51:24] whatever he wanted and and bring it all
[51:26] together and put that with his own ideas
[51:28] no matter how much as long as his own
[51:29] ideas are there with it
[51:31] it's a mule
[51:36] so the mule it's hard for him to live a
[51:37] christian life
[51:40] and i'll say to you today if it's hard
[51:42] for you to live a christian life
[51:44] there needs to be a birth that
[51:48] that brings that seed to life which is
[51:50] how you know that there's a thoroughbred
[51:52] christian
[51:53] there's a gene that goes back to the
[51:55] beginning why because there's something
[51:57] there
[51:57] jesus said my yoke is easy my burden is
[52:02] light
[52:06] see cults and just excuse me for being
[52:10] plain that's not in my nose but cults
[52:12] take
[52:13] the work from god and try to
[52:16] control the environment that people live
[52:19] in
[52:20] to the point where that what you are is
[52:23] the product of the cult
[52:25] they control your actions your deeds and
[52:28] everything about you
[52:29] that's not what the message of the hour
[52:31] does
[52:32] the message of the hour says here is the
[52:34] word if you can receive it
[52:37] if you can receive it here it's the word
[52:39] and what does the word do the word
[52:41] changes you from the inside it
[52:44] makes you become what you are it doesn't
[52:46] make you something that you're not so if
[52:48] you
[52:48] if you hate living like a christian if
[52:50] you just seem like you it's hard for you
[52:52] to
[52:52] well i wish i didn't have to live like
[52:54] this i wish i didn't have to keep these
[52:56] rules remember
[52:57] that that's what the mule says but
[53:00] there's got to be something inside of
[53:01] you that goes beyond that
[53:03] that said lord the flesh may hate it but
[53:05] there's something in me this is me
[53:08] this is who i am this is where i belong
[53:11] i don't want nothing else in my life but
[53:13] to sit and listen to the pure word of
[53:14] god
[53:18] now look the problem with the mule
[53:22] is that his as i said his birth as a
[53:23] result of man's interference
[53:25] mules are not known to exist in the wild
[53:29] because wild donkeys and wild horses
[53:32] don't live together but man brings them
[53:33] together
[53:35] and mules are it's interesting because
[53:38] they started breeding mules i got this
[53:40] where you could see it this is from the
[53:41] american mule museum
[53:43] because it's almost unbelievable but
[53:46] mules were first bred in in nicaea
[53:51] in turkey that's true it's where mules
[53:54] come from
[53:56] it's from nicea and i'm not trying to
[53:58] make anything spiritual out of that but
[53:59] that's the truth
[54:01] well mules spiritually come from nicaea
[54:05] from the nicene creed it's the same same
[54:08] place where they had the
[54:10] the night seeing council and so
[54:13] they reading a mule it brother branham
[54:15] says when the pentecostal church he said
[54:17] two groups they separated
[54:19] he said one wanted to stay with the word
[54:20] the written word others wanted a
[54:22] classical church he said it was during
[54:24] the time of constantine's reign and
[54:26] constantine was not a religious man he
[54:27] was even to begin with
[54:29] but he was a politician that wanted to
[54:31] unite
[54:33] so he looked at this and said well i
[54:34] like some of the things the thoroughbred
[54:36] does
[54:37] i like some of the things that the the
[54:39] pagans do
[54:41] so we'll just bring them together and
[54:42] make a meal
[54:45] he started a breeding program
[54:49] that's what he did he's making mules and
[54:52] it turns into something that's
[54:53] completely anti-word and antichrist
[54:57] because of the way he brought it
[54:58] together now because
[55:00] it takes both the word and the spirit to
[55:03] bring life
[55:04] now brother brown said he was he was a
[55:06] politician
[55:07] that wanted to unite half of rome was
[55:09] christian half of it was pagan
[55:11] so he adopted some of paganism some of
[55:13] christianity to a classical group
[55:15] and they made up their own religion
[55:18] but a made-up religion won't get you
[55:20] into heaven
[55:22] a made-up religion is not going to do
[55:23] anything for you all it's going to do is
[55:25] bring you down
[55:27] now so as i said it takes the word and
[55:30] the spirit to bring life in luke
[55:32] 1 and verse 26 let's look at this
[55:34] familiar story of mary
[55:36] as the word is about to be born in her
[55:39] and through her now in the sixth month
[55:41] the angel gabriel was sent from god into
[55:43] a city of galilee named nazareth
[55:45] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[55:47] was joseph
[55:49] the house of david and the virgin's name
[55:51] was mary
[55:53] and the angel came in unto her and said
[55:54] hail thou that are highly favored
[55:58] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[56:01] among women
[56:03] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[56:05] saying
[56:06] cast in her mind what manner of
[56:08] salutation this should be or greeting
[56:10] the angel said unto her fear not mary
[56:13] thou hast found
[56:14] favor with god she couldn't tell you how
[56:18] but she was chosen amen
[56:22] amen she was chosen before time
[56:26] to do what she did now he says
[56:29] blessed he said the lord is with thee
[56:31] blessed art thou among women
[56:33] and i backed up a little bit he said
[56:36] fear not mary for thou hast found favor
[56:38] with god verse 31 behold
[56:40] thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[56:43] bring forth a son
[56:44] and shall call his name jesus
[56:49] now it says he shall be great he shall
[56:51] be called the son of the highest the
[56:52] lord god shall give unto him the throne
[56:54] of his father david
[56:55] he shall reign over the house of jacob
[56:57] forever and of his kingdom
[56:59] there shall be no end and said mary unto
[57:02] the angel how shall this be
[57:03] seeing i know not a man there's nobody
[57:07] here
[57:08] to start the program to start putting
[57:11] the mule together
[57:13] how shall this be without the
[57:15] interference of a man
[57:17] and the angel answered and said unto her
[57:18] the holy ghost should come upon thee
[57:21] amen how are you going to have a church
[57:24] without the interference of a man
[57:26] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[57:29] the power of the highest shall
[57:30] overshadow thee
[57:32] amen he'll brood over thee he's going to
[57:35] produce something in your life he's
[57:37] going to bring life to the word
[57:40] amen he said therefore also that holy
[57:42] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[57:44] be called
[57:44] the son of god behold that cousin
[57:47] elizabeth sheath also conceived a son in
[57:49] her old age
[57:50] and this is the sixth month with her who
[57:52] was called barren
[57:53] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[57:57] amen with god nothing should be
[58:00] impossible
[58:01] and mary said i love this behold the
[58:04] handmaid of the lord
[58:06] be it unto me according to thy word
[58:13] so then the angel departed from her
[58:17] now one of the mysteries that brother
[58:19] branham brought us was that that
[58:21] happened without
[58:22] sensation she didn't feel any different
[58:29] oh if we could just recognize some
[58:30] people get all tangled up because
[58:32] they're looking for something that's not
[58:33] scriptural
[58:34] there was no sensation in this
[58:38] the sensation came later
[58:42] are you with me now the overshadowing of
[58:44] the spirit was without sensation
[58:47] but it produced a life
[58:50] she felt it only after it began to
[58:53] produce the word in her body
[58:56] but she believed it before she felt it
[59:01] and she received it before she felt it
[59:04] are you with me now brother brown said
[59:07] now mary could have waited until she had
[59:09] some kind of a sign that she was going
[59:10] to be mother
[59:12] and you could wait after the meeting's
[59:14] over until you feel that you can move
[59:16] your crippled leg just a little better
[59:18] or you could hear a little better out of
[59:20] that deaf ear
[59:21] or the cancer seemed to be that it
[59:24] wasn't bothering you so much
[59:26] he said that's not taking god at his
[59:28] word
[59:29] to take god at his word is to hear his
[59:31] word and accept it
[59:33] and start rejoicing with it
[59:37] so just because mary didn't feel
[59:39] anything doesn't mean she didn't rejoice
[59:43] are you with me now she didn't have to
[59:46] feel something to rejoice she didn't
[59:47] have to feel something to worship god
[59:49] why because the word came to her and she
[59:52] knew if the word came to her
[59:54] that that same god who brought the word
[59:56] to her would anoint that word to produce
[59:58] life
[1:00:00] amen amen so the word produced life in
[1:00:04] her now
[1:00:06] and brother brown says we could see 500
[1:00:08] rush to the altar tonight
[1:00:10] which would be a good sign then that the
[1:00:11] revival is going to break
[1:00:13] he said but we don't have to have 500 at
[1:00:15] the altar we just have to take god's
[1:00:18] word for it
[1:00:19] and start rejoicing amen
[1:00:23] so we're waiting for revival and i know
[1:00:25] that we need revival
[1:00:28] sure we do say well i don't god bless
[1:00:30] you i'm gonna come hang out with you for
[1:00:32] a couple weeks
[1:00:34] but i do all of us do from time to time
[1:00:37] we need revival
[1:00:39] we just need to sense that that brooding
[1:00:41] of the holy spirit in our midst we need
[1:00:43] we need to have that we need revival
[1:00:45] when when people
[1:00:46] just can't seem to do right and live
[1:00:48] right in things it's revival that
[1:00:50] changes those things
[1:00:51] it brings life but so we need revival
[1:00:54] not a worldwide shaking revival but a
[1:00:56] personal revival
[1:00:58] we need revival but you say well i'll
[1:01:01] get the revival when the 500 come to the
[1:01:03] altar
[1:01:04] but then when i see people start coming
[1:01:06] back to church they'd all have revival
[1:01:08] but he said before the 500 come to the
[1:01:12] altar
[1:01:13] before you begin to feel the baby move
[1:01:16] before you have any sensation before you
[1:01:18] have any any
[1:01:20] any feeling or anything like that you
[1:01:22] believe god's word
[1:01:24] god said he would do it do you believe
[1:01:25] that this morning
[1:01:27] god said he would do it if god said he
[1:01:29] would do it he will do it
[1:01:31] nothing can change that
[1:01:35] he will do it so she took god in his
[1:01:38] word and said be it unto me according to
[1:01:40] thy word
[1:01:40] he said something will happen he said
[1:01:43] that brings the word to life
[1:01:45] as we water it with praises
[1:01:48] that's why some gardens are so dry
[1:01:52] because they never get watered with
[1:01:53] praises
[1:01:55] if your life is just dry and you need
[1:01:57] you need you say i need that move of the
[1:01:59] spirit
[1:02:00] we have the word of god he said behold i
[1:02:03] show you mystery we shall not all sleep
[1:02:04] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[1:02:06] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:02:07] that's the word of god and we can be to
[1:02:09] be like mary and say
[1:02:10] be unto me according to thy word be it
[1:02:13] unto me according to thy word
[1:02:15] something will happen
[1:02:18] what brings that word brings the word to
[1:02:20] life as we water it with praises
[1:02:22] he said what makes the seed grow water
[1:02:24] what makes the word of god grow is the
[1:02:26] praises of god
[1:02:28] hallelujah amen not because
[1:02:32] we got worked up not because somebody
[1:02:35] stood here and pumped us and pumped us
[1:02:36] and bumped us but because we
[1:02:38] we accepted the word and the word says
[1:02:41] i can be born again the word says i can
[1:02:44] be healed the word says i can be
[1:02:46] i can be saved the word says my kids
[1:02:48] will be saved
[1:02:49] the word says that i make it
[1:02:54] and it doesn't matter what coronavirus
[1:02:56] says or what the world says
[1:02:57] something else says the word says
[1:03:00] i can be healed the devil says i want to
[1:03:03] die but the word says i'm healed
[1:03:05] the devil says i'm going down the word
[1:03:07] says i'm going up
[1:03:11] you with me now
[1:03:15] now brother brown says when jesus told
[1:03:18] them to wait in the upper room
[1:03:20] or the city of jerusalem until they was
[1:03:22] endured with power from on high
[1:03:24] that word fell on their ears and they
[1:03:26] was in the temple continually
[1:03:28] praising god day and night
[1:03:33] before they ever felt anything
[1:03:37] he said what was they doing watering
[1:03:39] that promise
[1:03:41] and all of a sudden there came a sound
[1:03:43] from heaven
[1:03:44] like a rushing mighty wind and it filled
[1:03:47] all the house where they were sitting
[1:03:49] he said the word was being watered and
[1:03:51] it took life
[1:03:52] and started growing he said you're
[1:03:54] wanting a revival
[1:03:56] could we say amen to that today you're
[1:03:59] wanting a revival everybody says they
[1:04:00] want one
[1:04:02] but are we willing to do what it takes
[1:04:04] to get there you're wanting a revival
[1:04:05] start watering the word the promise
[1:04:09] he said that makes me feel religious
[1:04:10] myself if you want to come out of the
[1:04:12] wheelchair
[1:04:12] start watering the word if you want to
[1:04:14] come from that cancer
[1:04:16] start watering the word amen
[1:04:21] so now so we know the holy ghost brings
[1:04:23] life to the word
[1:04:24] that is god's provided way
[1:04:28] and brother branham teaches us that and
[1:04:29] there is only one way provided by god
[1:04:31] for anything
[1:04:32] he says you are born into the kingdom of
[1:04:34] god how by the holy ghost
[1:04:36] that's god's witness he gives witness by
[1:04:38] the word of god that we've passed from
[1:04:40] death unto life because we are in the
[1:04:42] kingdom of god
[1:04:43] that's god's he said god needed a leader
[1:04:46] for the church
[1:04:48] i love this because with alan it takes
[1:04:51] some of the
[1:04:51] pressure off god needed a leader for the
[1:04:56] church
[1:04:56] he didn't educate a bishop neither did
[1:04:59] he send a high priest or a pope or no
[1:05:01] one
[1:05:01] else but he sent the holy ghost
[1:05:06] why did he send the holy ghost because a
[1:05:09] man
[1:05:09] will die and their systems die
[1:05:13] and everything else but the holy ghost
[1:05:16] is the eternal god
[1:05:18] he cannot die
[1:05:21] so if god builds the church if the holy
[1:05:23] ghost is the leader of the church then
[1:05:24] if something happened to me tomorrow
[1:05:26] the holy ghost still leads the church
[1:05:28] the leader of the church is not left
[1:05:30] leaderless are you with me now
[1:05:32] because the holy ghost is the leader of
[1:05:33] the church and what is he he's the word
[1:05:39] it's not just a feeling he's the word
[1:05:41] made flesh lit alive
[1:05:44] now he says he
[1:05:48] amen you give them an eternal leader
[1:05:53] you give them an eternal leader we look
[1:05:55] at those that have gone on look at
[1:05:56] brother branham and
[1:05:57] think well i wish i could have benefited
[1:06:00] from
[1:06:01] being near him i do i wish he was still
[1:06:04] here
[1:06:05] there's some questions i'd like to ask
[1:06:07] some things that i'd like to hear from
[1:06:08] god's prophet on
[1:06:11] but he left us with what the word
[1:06:15] when the holy spirit comes and anoints
[1:06:17] that word in our lives
[1:06:18] he gave us an eternal leader
[1:06:22] amen i can't go back to brother branham
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:25] communicate with him about the things we
[1:06:26] need to communicate with him about
[1:06:28] because that's spirit
[1:06:29] spiritualism communion with the dead is
[1:06:32] spiritualism
[1:06:33] so we can't go back and do that but we
[1:06:35] need somebody to guide us
[1:06:38] how can we guide us while we look at the
[1:06:39] word and then let the spirit anoint the
[1:06:41] word the prophet brought
[1:06:43] and the word we find in the scripture
[1:06:45] what happens he said there's something
[1:06:46] to guide them to tell them what to do
[1:06:49] how to live very bad
[1:06:52] how to meet the public you think god
[1:06:55] don't care how we meet the public how we
[1:06:57] act around people
[1:06:59] as i said a couple of sundays ago it's
[1:07:00] everybody's worth something everybody's
[1:07:02] worth a smile
[1:07:03] everybody's worth being kind to
[1:07:06] he said but what does the holy ghost do
[1:07:08] the holy ghost tells you how to meet the
[1:07:09] public
[1:07:10] how to meet the fierceness of the day
[1:07:13] how to combat sickness
[1:07:16] it's a better plan than ours brother joe
[1:07:19] joe and i had a plan to combat sickness
[1:07:21] but i don't think it worked very well
[1:07:24] he said but how to meet the fierceness
[1:07:26] of the day
[1:07:29] he knew we need to know how to meet the
[1:07:31] fierceness of the day
[1:07:33] so the prophet came and gave us the word
[1:07:37] and the holy spirit came to anoint that
[1:07:40] word
[1:07:42] and make it flesh don't have one without
[1:07:44] the other look the logos he
[1:07:46] come in word for him again so that we
[1:07:49] could see
[1:07:50] what it was like for a man to have the
[1:07:52] word
[1:07:53] to be the to become the word in his life
[1:07:56] and then we
[1:07:56] become the word now look that's our
[1:07:58] eternal leaders the holy ghost how to
[1:08:00] meet the fierceness of the day how to
[1:08:01] combat sickness
[1:08:03] how to combat this how to combat sin
[1:08:06] how we gonna overcome it
[1:08:09] it's virtually impossible in the world
[1:08:12] we have today to live
[1:08:14] without the influence of sin
[1:08:17] virtually impossible and i've talked to
[1:08:20] and especially
[1:08:21] since coming here and i not just you
[1:08:24] people are any different from any other
[1:08:25] people but just taking this position i
[1:08:27] i've realized that people can talk
[1:08:28] themselves into anything
[1:08:31] they can talk themselves into anything
[1:08:34] and so you have that influence
[1:08:36] constantly of the world telling it's
[1:08:38] okay it's okay it's okay
[1:08:40] brother branham said that that was the
[1:08:42] the demons of the euphrates river
[1:08:45] he said that would attack the bride and
[1:08:48] and we
[1:08:48] those are the ones that bring on the
[1:08:49] squeeze by the way we think about the
[1:08:52] squeeze and maybe there will be a time
[1:08:53] when we're
[1:08:54] running from the government but look
[1:08:56] when you look at running from the
[1:08:57] government what we're running from now
[1:08:59] is spirits that say it's okay
[1:09:03] go read pieces of the trumpets brother
[1:09:04] adam talks about that he said tell them
[1:09:06] it's so
[1:09:06] they tell they tell the bride it's okay
[1:09:08] you don't have to do that
[1:09:10] you don't have to live that way and see
[1:09:13] if we didn't believe in the holy spirit
[1:09:15] if we didn't believe that god could
[1:09:16] keep his church there would be no hope
[1:09:21] because the influence of the darkness is
[1:09:22] so strong
[1:09:25] there would be no way to overcome it but
[1:09:27] the holy ghost comes and teaches
[1:09:29] amen amen how to overcome these
[1:09:34] things brother brown said man has drawn
[1:09:36] all kinds of ways of joining this
[1:09:38] and creeds of this and documents of this
[1:09:40] baptisms of this
[1:09:41] every kind of sensation little quivers
[1:09:44] funny feelings
[1:09:45] everything else but it still remains the
[1:09:48] holy ghost is god's provided way for his
[1:09:51] church do we believe that today
[1:09:57] thank you for staying with me today i
[1:09:59] appreciate it
[1:10:01] look he said the holy ghost is god
[1:10:05] and god is the word the holy ghost is
[1:10:08] this word
[1:10:09] made full vindicated the holy ghost is
[1:10:13] the thing
[1:10:15] that brings this promised word to life
[1:10:20] he said you say i've had a feeling if it
[1:10:22] don't vindicate this word forget that
[1:10:24] feeling
[1:10:28] he said well you don't understand i'm in
[1:10:29] love if you're in love with somebody
[1:10:31] other than your spouse you've got a
[1:10:32] problem
[1:10:34] unless you're not married yet and then
[1:10:37] you better get married
[1:10:40] but see satan can make you feel that way
[1:10:42] your your flesh can trick you
[1:10:44] your heart even is deceitful you say
[1:10:46] i've had a feeling but if it don't
[1:10:47] vindicate this word forget that feeling
[1:10:50] they say well i've done this i've done
[1:10:52] that i've been baptized this way that
[1:10:53] way i don't care what you've done
[1:10:55] if the holy ghost is on you this word is
[1:10:58] vindicated through you
[1:11:02] well it makes the rubber meet the road
[1:11:03] doesn't it
[1:11:06] but you remember it was the prophets of
[1:11:07] baal who come out there and
[1:11:09] danced and had emotion and everything
[1:11:11] else and got all around and did it all
[1:11:13] that they did and cut
[1:11:14] themselves and everything else but
[1:11:15] couldn't produce nothing
[1:11:17] but elijah stood there with a simple
[1:11:19] prayer to god and god
[1:11:20] anointed it and god brought the fire
[1:11:22] from heaven what was it
[1:11:24] what was the difference the holy ghost
[1:11:26] vindicates the word
[1:11:29] amen the holy ghost still vindicates the
[1:11:32] word
[1:11:34] so you say well i don't feel the holy
[1:11:36] ghost believe the word
[1:11:39] amen it'll come right with it
[1:11:42] are you with me now now
[1:11:46] he says if the holy ghost is on you the
[1:11:49] word is indicated through you because
[1:11:50] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:11:51] that believed all the world
[1:11:53] and every creature amen god's provided
[1:11:56] way
[1:11:58] see it's obedience to the word
[1:12:01] that allows the spirit to dwell in the
[1:12:03] believer
[1:12:05] and bring that word to life
[1:12:09] now look you said being obedient now you
[1:12:11] think well being obedient means that
[1:12:13] i just have to find every little letter
[1:12:14] and every little thing and find out what
[1:12:15] the word teaches about short sleeves and
[1:12:18] find out what it teaches about all these
[1:12:19] things and jewelry and all these things
[1:12:21] then
[1:12:22] i'll try to make sure i follow every
[1:12:23] word that brother branham said and every
[1:12:25] word in the scripture
[1:12:27] no that's not what obeying obeying the
[1:12:28] word is when you get a revelation of
[1:12:30] something
[1:12:31] you follow it you believe it
[1:12:34] it's something that comes in your heart
[1:12:36] it can't be just something you do from
[1:12:37] the mind
[1:12:38] and being obedient to the word is
[1:12:40] realizing
[1:12:41] that you can't do it
[1:12:45] realizing you can't do it i need that
[1:12:48] that spirit that brooded over the
[1:12:50] earth i need that logos that brooded
[1:12:53] over the earth to bring
[1:12:54] the the chaos to life
[1:12:58] the earth was without form and void it
[1:12:59] was in chaotic condition just like many
[1:13:01] people's lives are
[1:13:02] but i need the word i need the holy
[1:13:04] spirit and the word together
[1:13:05] to brood over me so that i can
[1:13:09] come up i can live so what is obedience
[1:13:13] to the word okay i
[1:13:14] obey what am i going to obey i'm going
[1:13:15] to obey what peter said
[1:13:17] when he gave the prescription for how to
[1:13:19] receive christ
[1:13:21] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:13:23] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:13:24] remission of sin you shall receive
[1:13:25] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:13:29] for the promises unto you and your
[1:13:30] children to them that are far off even
[1:13:31] as many as the lord our god shall call
[1:13:33] what's he saying
[1:13:34] he's saying that that this is how you
[1:13:36] obey god
[1:13:38] not by going to church four times a week
[1:13:40] fasting and praying and doing all those
[1:13:41] things those things are wonderful but
[1:13:42] you obey god by coming according to
[1:13:44] god's provided way
[1:13:48] and obedience to the word allows the
[1:13:50] spirit to well in the believer look at
[1:13:51] jesus
[1:13:53] when he come to john in the water and he
[1:13:55] says
[1:13:57] he said john said i need to be baptized
[1:13:58] of you he said but we have to fulfill
[1:14:00] all righteousness
[1:14:04] what happens the spirit of god come down
[1:14:06] like a dove
[1:14:07] and dwelt on him now acts 1 and 4.
[1:14:15] we might ask this question why
[1:14:18] were the disciples in the upper room
[1:14:21] why were they there well it's because
[1:14:24] jesus said in acts 1 and 4 being
[1:14:26] assembled together with them commanded
[1:14:27] them
[1:14:28] that they should not depart from
[1:14:29] jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:14:31] the father which saith you have heard of
[1:14:33] me
[1:14:34] for john truly baptized with water but
[1:14:36] you should be baptized with the holy
[1:14:37] ghost not many days since
[1:14:38] so they're there in obedience to the
[1:14:40] word
[1:14:41] they received the word but the brother
[1:14:42] said it fell on their ears when they
[1:14:44] heard it they obeyed
[1:14:47] and so they were gathered there for that
[1:14:48] reason why are we here this morning
[1:14:52] now think about that why are we here and
[1:14:55] i know some many that would want to be
[1:14:56] here
[1:14:57] are not able to be here this morning but
[1:14:59] why are you here
[1:15:02] why are you here why are you watching
[1:15:03] you know you could watch a lot of things
[1:15:05] you could be on facebook and go down you
[1:15:07] want to go down facebook watch and
[1:15:08] and go through all the all the reality
[1:15:11] shows and everything else
[1:15:12] you could be watching that this morning
[1:15:15] but some of you are on facebook watching
[1:15:16] the church some of you are
[1:15:18] on youtube watching the church and you
[1:15:19] say why the service this morning why am
[1:15:21] i watching
[1:15:23] why are we here we're assembling
[1:15:25] together
[1:15:27] right this is our church nothing wrong
[1:15:30] with any other church but this is where
[1:15:31] we go in the house of god
[1:15:32] so we assemble together why
[1:15:35] because jesus the word said where two or
[1:15:39] three are gathered together in my name
[1:15:41] there am i in the midst of them
[1:15:45] amen what is it the holy ghost in you
[1:15:49] makes matthew 18 20 live
[1:15:53] hebrews 10 25 not forsaking the
[1:15:55] assembling of ourselves together as a
[1:15:56] man or some is
[1:15:57] but exhorting one another and so much
[1:15:59] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:16:01] what is it the holy ghost in us makes
[1:16:03] that word live
[1:16:06] amen now i asked you this morning when
[1:16:09] he promised them
[1:16:11] he promised them that when they were
[1:16:13] assembled together he commanded them
[1:16:14] they should not depart from jerusalem
[1:16:16] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:16:17] was that promise good
[1:16:21] did he fulfill it then i'm gonna ask you
[1:16:24] this
[1:16:24] is this promise as good as that promise
[1:16:29] if it's not then god don't keep his word
[1:16:32] huh and he said how long is this promise
[1:16:35] good to the promised unto you and to
[1:16:37] your children
[1:16:38] all that are far off even as many as the
[1:16:40] lord our god shall call he said if
[1:16:41] you'll meet together
[1:16:42] if you'll go to the upper room if you'll
[1:16:44] stay in jerusalem if you'll if you'll be
[1:16:46] there waiting
[1:16:46] i'll anoint that place with my presence
[1:16:50] with my word
[1:16:53] so we don't have to work it up or pull
[1:16:55] it down or anything else he said he
[1:16:56] would be here
[1:16:57] and i want to testify to the
[1:16:59] faithfulness of god
[1:17:02] i want to testify to the faithfulness of
[1:17:04] god i've often thought about what moses
[1:17:06] said when he took the children of israel
[1:17:07] and he said
[1:17:08] lord he said if you don't go with us
[1:17:10] don't take us up
[1:17:13] and i've often thought that way when i
[1:17:15] was preaching
[1:17:16] but i can i can attest to the
[1:17:18] faithfulness of god i remember brother
[1:17:19] brown saying that
[1:17:20] that every time he said i don't know if
[1:17:23] he'll come but i'm waiting on him he
[1:17:24] said he's never failed me yet
[1:17:27] what was that the faithfulness of god
[1:17:29] and then he would stop and say he's here
[1:17:33] and i can attest to that faithfulness
[1:17:35] because every time
[1:17:37] i've walked through the pulpit i may be
[1:17:38] sick i maybe need myself i maybe
[1:17:40] may have had problems and different
[1:17:42] things going on but every time
[1:17:44] i've stepped into the pulpit he's met me
[1:17:46] there
[1:17:49] you see you could say the same thing not
[1:17:52] because you felt it but because the word
[1:17:54] said so
[1:17:56] every time i come in sincerity
[1:18:00] and gathered myself with believers and
[1:18:02] prayed and called out to god god met me
[1:18:04] there
[1:18:06] there's not a time that he didn't meet
[1:18:09] me
[1:18:11] he may not have given me everything i
[1:18:13] wanted but he gave me what i needed
[1:18:18] is this promise as good as that promise
[1:18:23] if it isn't he's not god
[1:18:28] now he promised to bring the word to
[1:18:29] life if we believe the word enough
[1:18:32] to be obedient to it that's why brother
[1:18:35] branham if you go
[1:18:36] and study the token message brother
[1:18:38] branham over and over he says he says
[1:18:40] now
[1:18:41] he says it's not enough to believe it
[1:18:43] you think wait a minute you have to
[1:18:45] believe it
[1:18:45] he said it's not enough to believe it
[1:18:47] but just to simply say i believe it's
[1:18:49] not enough
[1:18:50] because you have to believe it enough to
[1:18:52] be obedient to it
[1:18:54] and if you really believe it you'll be
[1:18:56] obedient to it
[1:18:58] but brother branham hammers that he said
[1:18:59] to be to just say to believe it is not
[1:19:01] enough he says
[1:19:02] he's because he takes this he said the
[1:19:04] covenant
[1:19:05] by itself he said the covenant is made
[1:19:08] null and void
[1:19:09] without without the blood on the door
[1:19:14] so he said the covenant was there to the
[1:19:15] israelites they were god's people
[1:19:18] but without the token being put on the
[1:19:20] door it was stolen void
[1:19:22] it was no good
[1:19:25] now in the token sermon brother brennan
[1:19:26] said and i believe this is the one he
[1:19:28] preached
[1:19:28] after the one at jeffersonville but he
[1:19:30] said when he said you must be born again
[1:19:32] he said that don't mean jump up and down
[1:19:33] at the altar
[1:19:35] that don't mean walk back there and
[1:19:36] shake hands with the pastor
[1:19:38] i don't mean all this foolishness that
[1:19:39] we've seen done it don't mean putting
[1:19:41] your name on a church book
[1:19:42] it means death to your first being and
[1:19:45] life to the second being
[1:19:47] it means that the blood has been applied
[1:19:49] and you're identified by the life of
[1:19:51] jesus christ
[1:19:53] and if he be the vine and we be the
[1:19:54] branches the life that's in the branch
[1:19:56] is also from the vine
[1:19:58] it'll bear the fruit amen he said if
[1:20:00] that first branch come forth the
[1:20:02] branches out of that vine that wrote a
[1:20:04] book of acts behind it if that branch
[1:20:05] ever puts forth a vine puts forth
[1:20:07] another branch
[1:20:08] they'll write another book of acts
[1:20:09] behind it amen
[1:20:12] he said because it's the same life if
[1:20:14] one of your great vines out here brings
[1:20:16] forth blue grapes if it puts forth
[1:20:17] another branch
[1:20:18] it'll bring forth blue grapes he said
[1:20:20] and i tell you today we got so many
[1:20:22] grafted vines into it
[1:20:23] with denominations and creates and
[1:20:25] things yet any citrus fruit
[1:20:27] grafted in can live in that vine but
[1:20:29] it's bearing the wrong fruit
[1:20:30] he said what we need today is another
[1:20:32] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:20:38] and i watch people i've heard this
[1:20:39] quoted many times
[1:20:41] but not very many people quote what we
[1:20:43] just read in front of it
[1:20:46] he said don't mean jump up and down at
[1:20:47] the altar don't mean to walk back and
[1:20:48] shake hands with the pastor
[1:20:50] what we need today is another baptism of
[1:20:53] the holy spirit
[1:20:56] and have the real power of god that
[1:20:58] identifies the works
[1:20:59] that jesus christ promised for this day
[1:21:03] not so much as that day this day the
[1:21:05] promise that he made here
[1:21:11] he said that was what he promised there
[1:21:13] he would pour out his spirit
[1:21:15] now he has promised it again in the last
[1:21:17] days and what he would do
[1:21:20] he said strange that we can always look
[1:21:22] back
[1:21:23] remember last week's sermon we can
[1:21:25] always look back but you can never look
[1:21:26] ahead
[1:21:27] he said that's the way with man he's
[1:21:29] always saying glorifying god for what he
[1:21:31] did do
[1:21:31] praising him for what he's going to do
[1:21:33] ignoring what he's doing
[1:21:35] he said that's always the way of man
[1:21:37] it's still the same thing
[1:21:39] and then he says full obedience to the
[1:21:41] word brings god the word eternal
[1:21:44] in you and that is the token
[1:21:48] hallelujah he said when the word is in
[1:21:51] you
[1:21:52] it's christ in you
[1:21:56] i want to close in just a moment but i
[1:21:58] want to get to this
[1:22:00] see the holy spirit bringing life to the
[1:22:01] word removes tormenting fear from your
[1:22:03] life
[1:22:07] some of you have experienced that you
[1:22:10] know for some folks it's a scary thing
[1:22:11] to come to church
[1:22:14] it is i read a story
[1:22:18] once about teddy roosevelt his mother's
[1:22:21] name was midi
[1:22:23] and he was just a child he went to a
[1:22:26] church called madison square church
[1:22:29] and for a while he refused to set foot
[1:22:31] in that church without somebody right
[1:22:32] there with him
[1:22:33] he was scared to death of the church
[1:22:35] building
[1:22:37] and so his mother kept trying to find
[1:22:39] out why and he finally told her he said
[1:22:40] well
[1:22:41] he said there's something in the dark he
[1:22:43] said it's in the dark corners of the
[1:22:45] church ready to jump out at me
[1:22:47] and she said well what is it he said
[1:22:48] it's a zeal
[1:22:50] zeal z-e-a-l a seal
[1:22:55] and she said well what do you mean a
[1:22:58] zeal he said well it's probably a
[1:22:59] animal like an alligator or a dragon
[1:23:04] but she said well how did you learn
[1:23:05] about it he she said well he said well
[1:23:07] the preacher read about it
[1:23:09] out of the bible a zeal and she began to
[1:23:12] read him passages where
[1:23:13] from the concordance where it talked
[1:23:15] about zeal and finally he said oh that's
[1:23:17] it
[1:23:17] and it was john 2 17. where his
[1:23:20] disciples remembered that it was written
[1:23:21] the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
[1:23:27] lazier was going to get him
[1:23:32] some people are that scared of church
[1:23:36] as if the zeal is going to get you but
[1:23:39] that's not what we come to the house of
[1:23:41] god for
[1:23:42] amen we have a better word
[1:23:46] a more sure word of prophecy
[1:23:49] you imagine how scary it must have been
[1:23:50] in the old testament to come to god
[1:23:53] that if if the high priest didn't do
[1:23:55] everything just exactly right
[1:23:57] he walks inside the holy of holies if he
[1:23:59] didn't do they put bells on him
[1:24:02] and if he didn't walk just exactly right
[1:24:04] where the bells rung right
[1:24:06] they dragged him out
[1:24:10] what a fearful thing that it was amen
[1:24:13] but brother branham talks about the
[1:24:15] token being the sign of full obedience
[1:24:17] and he says when we receive the token
[1:24:19] now he's not saying that the sign of
[1:24:20] full obedience is fear is gone the sign
[1:24:22] of full obedience is the token
[1:24:24] he said but fear is gone
[1:24:31] why because the holy spirit has brought
[1:24:33] life to the word
[1:24:35] and the word if they don't say the zeal
[1:24:37] of thine house is beating me up you look
[1:24:38] at that
[1:24:39] oh i'm scared no what does it say it
[1:24:41] says you're my bride you're my wife i
[1:24:43] i'm
[1:24:44] i'm right there with you amen the word
[1:24:47] changes from what you perceived it to be
[1:24:51] to being something that is for you not
[1:24:54] against you
[1:24:56] are you with me now when the word comes
[1:24:58] to life in your
[1:25:00] in your heart the word begins to before
[1:25:02] you you don't come to church and just oh
[1:25:03] i hope the pastor does it
[1:25:05] doesn't touch on the thing that i'm
[1:25:07] doing i dread
[1:25:09] coming and it brings such a fear and a
[1:25:11] condemnation
[1:25:12] people come to church and just oh i'm
[1:25:14] afraid i'm afraid i can't make it i'm
[1:25:16] afraid
[1:25:17] i'm not making fun of you i know it's
[1:25:18] real but what you need is more of the
[1:25:21] life of christ
[1:25:24] what you need the brain said strive for
[1:25:26] that strive to keep that life in you
[1:25:28] because when you don't have that life
[1:25:30] you're afraid
[1:25:32] but the blood speaks better things
[1:25:37] you have all the legalism you want to
[1:25:38] the blood speaks better thanks
[1:25:42] amen amen
[1:25:45] hebrews 12 18 says for you are not
[1:25:47] coming to the mount
[1:25:49] that might be touched and that burned
[1:25:51] with fire
[1:25:52] nor into blackness and darkness and
[1:25:54] tempest
[1:25:56] and so many people come to the message
[1:25:58] that way oh i come to the word that way
[1:26:00] there's blackness there's darkness
[1:26:01] there's tempest he talks all about how
[1:26:03] bad i am
[1:26:04] but that's not what we come to are you
[1:26:07] with me now
[1:26:08] that's under the law sure it's the
[1:26:10] schoolmaster to bring us to repentance
[1:26:12] but that's not what we
[1:26:13] have come to and he said in the sound of
[1:26:15] a trumpet of the voice of words
[1:26:17] which voice they that heard and treated
[1:26:19] that the word should not be spoken to
[1:26:20] them anymore
[1:26:22] they said don't don't let him speak why
[1:26:25] did they cry that don't let god speak
[1:26:27] like moses speak why did they say that
[1:26:28] because they couldn't endure it verse 20
[1:26:32] for they could not endure that which was
[1:26:33] commanded
[1:26:35] they just couldn't live it they couldn't
[1:26:36] do it because of fear
[1:26:41] fear i won't be able to do it
[1:26:45] they couldn't do it he said if so much
[1:26:47] as a beast touched the mountain it'll be
[1:26:49] stoned or thrust through
[1:26:50] the dark how am i going to touch it
[1:26:52] here's the mountain of god
[1:26:53] but how am i going to touch it if even
[1:26:55] an animal touches it they die
[1:26:58] it's so terrible it's the sight that
[1:27:00] moses said i i exceedingly fear and
[1:27:02] quake
[1:27:03] this god's prophet who god spoke to lip
[1:27:07] to ear but he said i exceedingly fear
[1:27:08] and quake
[1:27:10] he said but you are come i hope we get a
[1:27:13] revelation of this today
[1:27:16] what as david said we're come to mount
[1:27:18] zion with joy
[1:27:20] amen he said you're coming to mount zion
[1:27:23] unto the city of the living god
[1:27:25] of the living god the heavenly jerusalem
[1:27:28] to an innumerable company of angels
[1:27:32] look at the stark contrast paul's
[1:27:34] drawing over here there's darkness
[1:27:36] there's fire there's voices that you
[1:27:38] don't understand
[1:27:39] over here is mount zion
[1:27:43] amen over here is the city of the living
[1:27:46] god
[1:27:47] over here is a heavenly jerusalem an
[1:27:49] innumerable company of angels
[1:27:52] amen he said to the general assembly
[1:27:56] in church of the firstborn amen
[1:28:00] not not a hybrid something or another
[1:28:02] the church of the firstborn
[1:28:04] which are written in heaven and to god
[1:28:05] the judge of all
[1:28:07] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:28:10] perfect
[1:28:11] hallelujah i want to be scared to come
[1:28:14] to church
[1:28:15] do i have to be scared of the word of
[1:28:16] god i don't have to have condemnation
[1:28:18] weighing me down and that cloud over me
[1:28:20] costly where i sit and weep and wonder
[1:28:22] what am i going to do there's a time for
[1:28:23] weeping but there's got to be a time
[1:28:24] where you recognize i have come
[1:28:26] to a different kind of mountain i'm not
[1:28:29] coming to the message of the hour to
[1:28:30] learn
[1:28:31] how to how to be another cult member
[1:28:33] i've come to the message of the hour to
[1:28:35] be free
[1:28:35] i've come to the message of the hour
[1:28:37] because this is the innumerable company
[1:28:39] of angels
[1:28:40] jesus is the mediator of a new covenant
[1:28:42] and a blood of sprinkling that speaks
[1:28:43] better things than that of abel
[1:28:45] what did abel's blood speak it spoke of
[1:28:47] it spoke of vengeance
[1:28:50] cried out for out for for the blood of
[1:28:52] his brother
[1:28:53] but now there's a blood that cries out
[1:28:55] for forgiveness
[1:28:57] hallelujah so you're not afraid to come
[1:29:00] around god's people you're not afraid of
[1:29:02] the spirit of god moving
[1:29:03] you're not afraid of god being in our
[1:29:05] midst why because this brooding that you
[1:29:07] feel
[1:29:07] is love to you it's love it's not hate
[1:29:10] it's not
[1:29:11] it's not rejection it's not throwing you
[1:29:13] out in hell somewhere stuff
[1:29:17] are you with me now come to an
[1:29:19] innumerable company of angels to the
[1:29:21] general assembly church of the firstborn
[1:29:23] which are written in heaven
[1:29:26] to god the judge of all to the spirits
[1:29:28] of just men made perfect
[1:29:30] to jesus the mediator of the new
[1:29:32] covenant to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:29:34] speaks better things than that of abel
[1:29:39] see first john 4 18 says there's no fear
[1:29:41] in love
[1:29:44] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:29:50] because fear hath torment he that
[1:29:53] feareth is not made perfect
[1:29:56] in love
[1:29:59] what is that perfection it's what the
[1:30:00] holy ghost brings us to
[1:30:04] brother branham talks about how we grow
[1:30:05] up into christ it's not an overnight
[1:30:08] conversion
[1:30:09] yes we are converted we can point back
[1:30:11] to a place in a time and all of that
[1:30:13] but god's growing in us the holy spirit
[1:30:15] that growing into the image of
[1:30:17] the son of man in our lives what is it
[1:30:19] growing
[1:30:21] growing into a perfect love
[1:30:25] you see when the holy spirit broods over
[1:30:27] your life
[1:30:29] what he did at the beginning he'll do
[1:30:30] for you
[1:30:33] i'm so thankful for that you may wake up
[1:30:36] in the morning there'll be chaos
[1:30:38] everywhere
[1:30:39] but as you begin to read and you begin
[1:30:41] to look you begin to realize brother sam
[1:30:45] there's there's peace here
[1:30:48] there's joy here there's order
[1:30:51] here the world may be out of order my
[1:30:54] body may feel sick the war
[1:30:56] everything around me may be spinning out
[1:30:57] of control but there's peace here why
[1:31:00] the holy spirit broods over the word
[1:31:03] to bring peace to bring joy to cast out
[1:31:06] fear
[1:31:07] amen let's let him do that
[1:31:10] amen let's buy our heads together
[1:31:13] musicians if you would come
[1:31:19] perhaps we've not
[1:31:24] allowed him to brood over us like we
[1:31:25] should
[1:31:27] we know that we have the holy spirit i
[1:31:29] believe that you do
[1:31:31] i'd never try to preach you out of that
[1:31:33] but
[1:31:34] perhaps there's something in your life
[1:31:35] that you just i realize i've been
[1:31:38] doing some things that aren't right or
[1:31:40] maybe it's just not spending enough time
[1:31:42] with him
[1:31:44] you know you think when you have more
[1:31:45] time you'll spend more time that's not
[1:31:46] always true
[1:31:48] i told myself when i have more time i
[1:31:50] don't want to get up at 5 30 every
[1:31:52] morning i'm going to go out and i'm
[1:31:52] going to walk every morning i'm going to
[1:31:54] do it
[1:31:54] but see there has to be a will to do
[1:31:56] that it has to be something there you
[1:31:59] say well i don't have the time but we
[1:32:00] find the time for what we need
[1:32:02] god help us today we need his spirit
[1:32:06] we need that brooding we can't live
[1:32:09] without it
[1:32:10] without that spirit in the word coming
[1:32:12] together and producing a life
[1:32:14] we can't live we can live without
[1:32:17] everything else
[1:32:18] i like the potlucks i like the the
[1:32:21] fellowship
[1:32:22] i want more of that and my heart longs
[1:32:24] for that but what we need
[1:32:26] is the brooding of the holy spirit
[1:32:30] i pray he would come down right now and
[1:32:32] just just just settle down over you and
[1:32:35] just begin to grow you begin to mature
[1:32:38] you begin to move you
[1:32:39] into that perfect love where there's not
[1:32:41] fear anymore
[1:32:43] not a fear being cast out well what if
[1:32:45] i'm not one of god's no
[1:32:46] no there's a love there i know
[1:32:50] i wouldn't want to cause him any harm i
[1:32:52] wouldn't want to do anything that would
[1:32:53] hurt him
[1:32:54] but i know that i have an advocate if i
[1:32:57] sin if there's something
[1:32:58] that's messed up i know god you can heal
[1:33:00] me i know you can save me i know you can
[1:33:02] bring me out of it
[1:33:03] i know you can change me i'm not like
[1:33:06] that anymore
[1:33:08] come to god out of fear come to him out
[1:33:10] of love
[1:33:11] i love you lord and i want you to move
[1:33:15] in my life

[1:33:43] sometimes we produce so much fear in
[1:33:45] people that
[1:33:46] that they're afraid to speak up when
[1:33:47] they need to
[1:33:49] that's not what it's about

[1:33:54] knock him over the head when he doubted
