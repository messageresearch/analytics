========================================

to make it work so at any time this is going to be pretty informal so at any time stop and ask me questions if you want to except for my mother but anybody else can ask me questions all right so what uh what will title this um is good and Faithful Servants so we are called to be faithful in a lot of things you know as husbands we've got to take care of our family both in spiritual aspect Health aspect and then financially as well so we're going to go over this one's kind of going to be lay the groundwork for what we're going to talk about the second class will actually be where we go over the budget so you will have homework when you leave here today so I do apologize for that but it's fun and if you need me to ever do anything for you um as far as helping you with your budget let me know and I'll do that for you so this is one of my favorite quotes it says the starting point of all achievement is desire keep this constantly in mind it says a weak desire brings weak results so just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat so if you're going to do something if you ask my wife I'm An All or Nothing guy if I'm dieting I want to throw out all the food in the house and just have healthy food so it's kind of hard to do especially if you're a married couple getting on board with a budgeting takes a very very long time so actually just to give you a little background we will talk a little bit about Dave Ramsey and his Total Money Makeover that that whole thing that he does I don't agree with with everything that Dave Ramsey says but a lot of it is good good foundational stuff for a budget me and Jen had been married maybe two two and a half years and we're going on this we're going on a cruise and and we stopped at Jeremy and Rebecca's house when they lived in Magnolia and and Jeremy's an All or Nothing guy too he's you know if he's in he's in and if he's out he's out but he had this book laying there and he kind of we got there late at night and we set up to like one or two in the morning talking about The Total Money Makeover in the budget and and so he uh so I told you I was like let's go on the cruise have fun first then come back in budget so that's what we did we went wasted and squandered and had just a wonderful time and then we come back and then we got on the budget so that was about our third year of marriage and I'll kind of once we get in the slides I'll kind of go over what all stuff we did that is helpful not helpful and going from there but we'll start with a scripture here Matthew 25 it says for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his good so if you remember in Matthew 25 the first Parable that he gives is the the wise and foolish virgins so this is the parable immediately after that he said and unto one he gave five talents to another he gave two and to another he gave one and he said to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey so then the gentleman that received the five talents went and traded with the same and made him another five talents so now he had 10 total and likewise he that received two also gained another two so he went from two to four but he received one digged in the earth and hid his Lord's money so he took the one that he was given and did nothing with it right and so after a long time the lord of the servants come and reckon with them and he that received the five talents came and brought forth another five saying Lord thou delivered unto me five talents behold I have gained beside them five talents more his lord said to him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over the few things I will make the ruler over many things enter thou unto the joy of the Lord and he that received the two the same he came and delivered unto him for I gained another two talents besides them as the Lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over the few things I will make thee rule over many things enter thou unto the joy of the Lord and so we see that what God had given or excuse me what this what this master had given them they took it and multiplied it and they multiplied it for their Master's calls so and then he which received the one Talent came to came and said Lord I knew thou art a hard man reaping where thou has not sown and Gathering where thou Hast not strawed so he knew that that his master was was was really good at making money where he didn't have to actually do any work what we would call passive income he said I was afraid and wouldn't hid that talent in the earth Lo thou Hast is thine and he given back the one Talent and his Lord answered and said unto him thou Wicked and slothful servant thou knew us that I reap where I sow not and gather where I am not strawed now ought us therefore to have put the money in the exchangers and then of my coming should have received my own usury or with usury take down the talent from him and give it unto him which the half the ten Talent now and brother Ben wanted me to lay out a kind of a scriptural basis for the for the budgeting and financing I do believe it is scriptural because everything that we deal with we're not we're not Building Wealth for greed for the love of money but the overall goal is you know for time with family you know right now I don't own my own time if I want to have a paycheck I have to go to work unfortunately they don't just pay me to sit at home I've asked for that job but they don't have one of those yet so we see that we're giving our time for our money to take care of our family so we want to get to a point where we don't have to do that now brother Brandon he says in investments in 1962 he says a fellow that's got money wants to put it to good investment of course he said a man that has let's say as much as ten thousand dollars would like to put it in some investment he said don't keep it in your pocket because you know thieves will steal it and so you don't want to do that he said if you're a good sound businessman you want to put in something that'll draw dividends you want to put it into something for user he says you know about the talents in the Bible he said so you must put it to some use that'll draw dividends out of it some good Sound business he said and then doing this you don't want to put into something that's not sound he said no man would want to do that he said a good smart businessman wouldn't think of such a thing you men wouldn't he said put it into something that one of these get rich overnight schemes and said don't know where it come from he said you better be careful about that you lose all you got he said it's a gamble he said and gambling is not good Sound business so there's my scripture my quote for the for the financial seminar for brother Ben so but we're called to be good stew words now you have to find what your financial purpose is in life just as you have to find out is what your spiritual calling is you know if you're a minister you you're there to preach if you're a songly you're there to sing if you're a deacon whatever it may be if you're a prayer Warrior you've got to find what your purpose is so back to the story of the talents now Matthew 25 and 21 is is Lord said to him well done now good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over the few things I will make the ruler over many enter thou unto the joy of the Lord so the the moral of that story to me is if you can't manage ten dollars you won't be able to manage ten thousand right that's the moral of the story and if you look at if you look at any financial studies the key is spend less than you make right if you spend more than you make you're going to go into the red that's just that's just the fact of the matter and and if you spend all you have you'll have none left over to invest or save for emergency now no one is born with the magical ability to manage money we've all got to be taught that now it's up to you as to what you're going to do with your life and your why you know why do you want to be financially stable why do you want to have money and again if you're driven by greed you may get a lot of money but you're still not going to be wealthy with your time and and all of that with your family so notice in Matthew 25 one thing I wanted you to notice is notice Who the Master gave more to he gave more to those that he knew would manage it correctly right he gave five talents to the one and they made him five he gave two to the other and it made him two he gave the least to the one that he knew would be more likely to not make him money so if you so this is something you always need to remember a man told me this a long time ago and he says if you can't manage ten dollars you can't manage ten thousand and that equates to throughout your whole entire life and money management is to be used with consistency you can say you start on a budget you follow that plan for six months and then you get everything in good shape and then you go back to your old habits then it's just going to be the same way you know you're just going to keep going through that cycle so it is a lifestyle change and it's not it's not always fun um I'm very fortunate because my wife who's not here she's watching kids is about as tight as me so we kind of get along in that aspect we didn't always At first she would be want to do it and then I wouldn't and I would want to do it and she wouldn't so there's just different things in life that you have to if you're a married couple I want to go ahead and tell you this just real quick if you're a married couple and your spouse does not agree and y'all sit down and agree to do this it will not work once the house divided against itself will not stand right so if you're going to do it you need to definitely pray get with your spouse you don't need to pray and discuss it you know as the man the the head of the household you know you want to be able to take care of your family you want to lead and guide them throughout throughout all their life um and so even setting up your children to do this because as we know marriage is difficult enough on its own right no husbands okay I'm raising my hand while it's perfect but anyways marriage is is Joel probably was the only one brother Ben's just waving his hands back and forth but marriage is tough enough without the burden of financial stress right so if you can alleviate one of those things it does make life a whole lot less stressful so you know me and Jen we've done the Dave Ramsey thing and I think we're on baby step six it's what it is you know there's seven steps and so we're on baby step six and and I will tell you this you know when you get that emergency fund built up to three to six months it's almost like you kind of have a weight lifted because even if your employer finds you even if you're a horrible worker you've three to six months you should be able to find another job right I mean you should be able to find find something else so I will tell you that it does take a lot of stress away that you just you didn't really realize was there but you're like well I've got to do this and it can even get you out of an unhappy job is which um one of the things that it did help me was when I left the funeral home going into banking it it allowed me to switch because I knew that I had that money in reserve in case I had to do anything else so it really does help now what I want to talk to you about just for a second is it's not what you make it's what you keep so somebody making 200 000 a year spending two hundred thousand dollars a year guess what they got at the end of the year zero hard easy banking math right there 200 minus 200 Zero you've got a guy making 35 000 a year and he spends 20. he's got more than the guy that made 200. simple math right so it's not what you make it's what you keep now a lot of times when you mention that from the pulpit people are like no we're supposed to give it to God and yes ties should be your first thing on your budget Ty's an offering the scripture says they robbed him in ties and offering right didn't just say ties it also said offering so those should be the two first things on your list and the good thing about that is it's easy to plan out so let's just say you spend five dollars a day five business days a week right so that's 260 days we take off the weekends that's about thirteen hundred dollars a year so I'm horrible for this um all you coffee drinkers are gonna hate me but your 13 coffees 7.50 that's about twenty four hundred dollars a year it's expensive it's the little things I think Benjamin Franklin says and I think it's later in here a small leak will sink a great ship so Allison's getting a 750 coffee Stewart's getting a 13 frap I don't know what it is that's 20 a day just on breakfast so where and I'm above no one here so I did the math one time I was getting about I've spent about nine bucks on breakfast every morning with an energy drink and a sausage biscuit or something else then I was going at lunch and spend about ten eleven dollars so that was 20 some dollars a day that I was spending in food um and not healthy food you know there's there's a lot to this financial financial piece that also deals with your health you know whenever you're whenever you're more mentally stable and you you handle your your money management it makes you look at things a little bit different and you start looking at the longevity of things and that's where you start saying well you know I've got this planned for four or five ten years you start doing things even healthier at home if you start eating at home and not eating out actually it kind of trickles down to so many different things but money management is not hard mentally the numbers thing is really easy writing it down is really easy but it's emotional you know because we are geared and I think I've told brother Ben this before but you know people will talk to you at the bank or talk to you about almost their intimate life their their their darkest Secrets but they won't talk to you about money you know like if you know it's one of the topics I've been reading some different studies and and and a lot of people that are going on on dates and stuff now they will they will talk more like they'll be if they're meeting someone for a date they'll talk more about their history of sexual partners than they will about their credit card debt or other debt that's how intimate that is and so it's something that's geared in humans and and I don't know if they've actually figured out the why that it's geared so much in us but that's a secret part that we don't want to tell anybody else and and so we've got to get over that that's the first step you've got to get over is is pride and I am a horribly that's one thing that I've always struggled with and so driving a beat up truck for the last four years has really helped that I turned my air conditioner on with a pair of pliers it has helped my pride somewhat now that and that's a good thing I and honestly you know I go back and forth on a new vehicle and if you've got a new vehicle and you've got a vehicle payment know that I'm gonna say some harsh things but don't take it out on me okay so just give me just a little bit but you know to me I started looking at that and I was like you know I can drive a really really nice truck or I can quit working about 15 years earlier I was like I'm gonna quit 15 years earlier I was like this is an easy question for me now that's not for everybody but my why was I want to be the owner of my time and I want to spend time with my family now I am not against all debt I'm a commercial loan officer I make loans all the time and and I'm not against them and I have a couple loans on businesses that I do not have to pay so I want you to be very clear if you've got a loan on something that's making you money you should do that okay now if it's a poor investment it's only going to make you money for a year but you owe four or five years on it you need to obviously study that out okay but your why will always beat your reason to quit if you have a good why so married couples again you have to agree on this unfortunately it will not work with just one and then you've got to ask yourself why do you want to be financially stable you know you you asked this to a lot of people they want more they want more right they just say I want more and I want more money I want more money well if you're not happy with what you got now why would you be happy with more so you've got to get that you've got to get to that point where you realize well what do I really want you know me I say well I want more money what I'm saying is I want more time and I know no one likes to hear this my wife's not in here I want more time to go hunting and fishing be with my boys be with my little girl I wanna that's what I want when I say I want more money that's what I want and so that's kind of what my goal is but you've got to sit down with your husband and wife and and you've got to make that decision why do you want to be financially stable and to a lot of a lot of people thinking well that's a stupid question why wouldn't I want to be financially stable well then why aren't you right not a lot of amens on that man but I want to control my time I want to be with my family and I want to also change my my generational family so my children I want them to come into this different I pray my kids do not go to college I know that sounds crazy but I really pray they don't I would love to have enough rental houses by the time they get old enough that they could take over get a tradesman's job because I believe they can afford they can make a lot more money doing that those things or they can go there out of college and they can make just as much money doing those things so but that's just my own personal personal belief there but if they say they're going to college obviously I'm going to be go for it you know I'm I'm fine with that so gratitude is the best attitude if you're not happy with what you've got you will not be happy with more of it that's what we just talked about so Hebrews 13 5 says let your conversation be without covetness and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so I think one thing you need to remember when you're when you're coming into this is that that God is first right when you're doing this with your spouse and and you're doing this uh with your family you know the reason we put ties and offering up there first um is because that's our that's our duty to God that's that's what is expected of us but there is a a universal law and the scripture teaches about it in multiple places but when you the more you give the more you receive and so there is now there's kind of a caveat to that if you're giving to receive you know like if I go and and you know I give Caleb ten dollars but I know he's gonna give me you know maybe a few arrows back that's not giving that's a trade that's all it is so if you're you know if you're giving to church and you're like okay God's gonna give me I gave 200 God's gonna give me 200 back that's a trade right you give without expecting anything in return that's the gift right that's where Jesus the gift unto us was salvation he gets he got nothing in return for that exchange now yes we get to spend we are his sons and daughters we get to spend eternity with him that that that's the exchange there but but that free gift of Salvation was nothing that you and I could do to earn it right and so we see that if you're not happy with what you've got if you're not grateful for what God has given you already why should he give you more okay so I'm just kind of laying a foundation for this class and I know it's it's a little bit back and forth and and I want to just jump into the budgeting and and the numbers and that's what I love doing but we're going to take it really really slow so so consistency is key in Proverbs it says a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother Treasures of wickedness profit at nothing but righteousness delivereth from death the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth the way the substance of the wicked he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich he that gaareth in the summer is a wise son he that sleepeth in Harvest is a son that callseth shame so many of y'all are probably familiar with you know make hay while the Sun's shining all right well that's what that last verse is is saying there you know if you're sleeping during Harvest time you're not you're not going to make any money but he that becometh poor that dealeth with the slack hands so what he's saying is you know if you're not diligent in what you're doing you will become poor and then it says but the hand of the diligent maketh he Rich so I want to make sure we look at the difference here sometimes working more does not always mean you're going to get more money you've got to be diligent with what you're making so again I go back to someone making two three four hundred thousand dollars a year if they spend two three four hundred thousand dollars a year that's still at the end of the year they have zero somebody who's making Thirty forty fifty thousand and only spending half of that they have more at the end of the year so you want to be diligent in whatever you've been given so if God's given you you know a 20 an hour job you want to be diligent with what God has given you you know first you want to pay your tithes you want to pay your offering and then from there you want to list your expenses in order of importance okay Now Dave Ramsey has this deal it's called the seven baby steps to financial peace and so step one is to save a thousand dollars I believe he calls us your rainy day emergency fund and he says I think the way he says it is is it's your rainy day fund and get ready because it's gonna rain so any of you that have had kids I have an HSA set up to where I put a certain amount in a week and it always gets really built up and I'm like oh yes I've got money for health care coverages you know and then my kids come along and it's like bam back in the basement they just they but that's what that money is for it's budgeted there for that purpose so if you've got children if you live a life you let them go outside get around other people they're going to get sick they're going to need these things so you you kind of know what you've got to plan for so Dave Ramsey's baby step number one is save a thousand dollars step number two is pay off all debt step number three is save three to six monthses of expenses for emergencies step four invest fifteen percent of your income for retirement step five save your college for your children six payoff house seven build wealth and give so you can see there's a lot of a lot of steps there now when Jen and I first started this we didn't know really how we were going to do it we didn't have a ton of debt I think we had we each had a car payment maybe a credit card maybe an ATV payment and a house payment and so that was kind of our stuff we had no kids so at that time I was talking about the bin about this in the back she worked as a as a home health nurse made plenty of money my money covered the bills we called her money the fund money and boy did we have fun with it it's been at all so you know I kind of look back and I'm like oh man I thought I'd just been smarter 10 years ago life would look so much different and so the first thing and and I love getting creative with this and I love seeing couples and people get creative with I've worked with with several different ones on this I've done it at work I've done it in church and I've just done it for people you know through the gym or wherever but the first thing is how to save a thousand dollars you know if anybody's struggling with money right now you're like oh man this is this is not going to happen you can do it I think Dave Ramsey says it really best when he says sell everything but the kids right you've got a thousand dollars worth of stuff laying around somewhere sell it you'll you'll find that whenever you lose an emotional attachment to money and items life gets a lot easier because you're you know you know you're emotionally attached to to to maybe this this item like I'm emotionally attached to my bow let's just use me for an example I'm emotionally attached to to my my hunting bow you know when you let go of that and it doesn't really become about the item but it becomes about maybe to me say the hunt the time with my children in the woods or the time by myself in the woods it becomes more about the experience than the item you know before I liked I liked being able to start my truck with the remote and get in it and drive and and do those things and it's not as fun turning my air on with a pair of pliers but now it gets me from A to B and I haven't had a payment in four five years so to me it's it when I when I remove myself from that emotional attachment to objects and Money life kind of changed a little bit now do not wait the time will never be just right start where you stand and work with whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along the way that's a quote from Napoleon Hill so you sell everything that you've got except the kids and you can maybe throw your worst one in there yard sale everything you don't need or use and I'm really bad about this um and and Jen will tell you this if I'm not using something for a few weeks I will sell it on Facebook I just I cannot stand I mean if I have metal piled up behind my barn I will drive it to the scrap yard and and get rid of it it just it bothers me if I can see it there and I'm like you know that could be 20 bucks I'm gonna take it and do that now you don't have to get that bad but at first you need to kind of go crazy you need to kind of do this with all you've got now get a side job you don't need to have pride I had I think I've had two jobs at minimum for at least the last eight years until I quit embalming two years ago but I would work my day job then I'd go and bomb at night and then all that money would be used to pay off debt or do something else with it financially for the family so you've got to get creative with this you need to sit down with your spouse come over the plan how are we going to save a thousand dollars now you know a lot of items that we that we spend money on our generation is about consumerism it's about items you get on your phone you get on Facebook what do you have ads you know Instagram what do you have ads you get on YouTube what do you have ads we are a consumer based country it's about things my little boy I was giving him an example the other day and he had somebody had bought him this or he actually bought him this video game I made him buy it and I hate video games I just want to make sure you know that and these are clean and approved by the parents but I do not like them I think they think they I think they lead to addiction down the road and so we're we're working on that right now but so there's a lot of opinions coming from Alan tonight but I'm not preaching I'm not representing the church anyway this is just me so so he has this game for fifty dollars which I'll let him buy with his own money because he needs to respect what he gets and so he's like Daddy I can sell this 15 bucks and I'll have 15 bucks like but you you net lost 35 dollars right because you had 50 in the beginning so you you gave away and wasted 35 so I've explained that to couples before you know I've bought a 30 000 car and you and a couple years later you sell it for 20 you're like oh I got the 20 back good deal but you lost 10. right so explaining that to people sometimes loses pulls that emotional attachment to that object away a little bit you know I took my bow into the the shop the other day and you know I think I can't remember what I paid for it I traded my old bow in on it and some other stuff and but he offered me 500 for it I think when I got it new is around eight nine hundred bucks I think I don't know my wife's not in here maybe a thousand I don't know if I traded in on it and so like to me all I heard was you're losing 500 really really loud in my head that's all I could hear and so when you begin to do that you begin to think a little bit more about your purchases and I've I've sat down with matney and talked to him about depreciating assets which we're not going to get into today and appreciating assets so we'll get on to that in like the third the third section but get creative I want you to save a thousand dollars as fast as you can okay so the next the next time when we come back we're going to actually do a budget I'm just gonna go over these baby steps real quick the baby step two is pay off all debt so you pay off all debt except the house you start with the smallest debt you pay it off first then you take the funds from the smallest debt you put it towards the next smallest debt this is called The Snowball Effect everybody's heard of The Snowball Effect um this is a tremendous way and a really fun way to pay off debt and I keep using the word fun but some of my favorite times was you know what gin would be budgeting money to being like okay rice and beans tonight for supper we saved eight bucks it's going to this that's some of my funnest funnest times yeah I have a different meaning of fun Joel so you start with your smallest debt so I'll give you an example and anybody who wants my slideshow can have it at any time you got credit card a balance is 375 monthly payments 30. you've got an auto loan balance 6 500 monthly payment 225. that number three is an ATV loan balance 7 800 monthly payment 199. so what you're going to do is you're going to take all your extra money after you save a thousand dollars let's say you have 300 left over than a month or a hundred you take all that and you apply it to your smallest debt you pay the minimum on everything else you don't let anything get behind and you do this until that card is paid off then the next month you have that payment in addition to whatever you have left over the month so it's two three hundred dollars you got the payment amount plus the two three hundred dollars you apply to the next one and you continue on and what happens is you're as you're freeing up that debt money the snowball gets bigger right so it's where you used to have a hundred dollars extra now you have two hundred dollars extra and then now you have three and four and five and so on and you continue to snowball down this now there are certain situations where businesses need debt I understand it um some of you self-employed guys that work for yourself sometimes the best tax write-off you got as a vehicle or equipment or maybe if it's a rental house it's a lawnmower weed eater whatever it is I understand that so you've got to take this understanding that a lot of this stuff is for W-2 employees but it works and transitions to all kinds right it transitions down through there I am I am against Consumer Debt you know I'm not a big Consumer Debt guy I don't mind business stuff because it makes you money now you make all the minimum payments on the debt except until it's all gone okay and then you roll that money into the next one so does everybody understand anybody got questions no one spoke out or through anything yeah no everybody having fun that was not wholeheartedly Stewart's like I just want to get out of here it's 30 more minutes all right so so me and Jen some fun things that we did I keep using the word fun cutting expenses to me was the funnest thing in the world and so like I like to negotiate that don't matter what it is I just like to negotiate so I would call at T with I'd not even checked with Verizon I'd be like hey I'm leaving you Verizon's got a better deal I'm out you know what if we cut your bill you know you've been a good value customer I went down through that and I lowered my monthly expenses by a couple hundred bucks you'd have thought I had won a million dollars when I got off the phone for the day but take a day sit down and do those things finding subscriptions that you've had for years I had a Napster subscription which I think it was for music I don't even know might have been a podcast thing that I'd got and it was like 13.99 a month just been there for a year then two years and I was like oh when I got rid of that it was just so much fun so you want to go through and you want to you know 13.99 what's that that's a hundred and nuts 136 something more a year 150 bucks a year you know that I could spend on something else or save and invest or give to somebody that's in need uh my biggest thing now I went back through which I talked about earlier was was food and drink and energy drink you know energy used to be like 299 now it's like 368. it's four bucks when you go get a drink and coffee according to Allison is seven seven fifty I think Jen's is around nine yeah I think Jen's around nine coffee's expensive in Asheville I don't have a lot of options so it's just just out there she does not drink that a lot she makes coffee at home so you need to go through and in your homework when we get to the very end which I may have to skip ahead but I'm going to give you the the homework you got to look at through necessary expenses and then unnecessary expenses and my unnecessary side was huge my necessary was not really that bad so but examples you know necessarily expensive you may need internet at home when I called my internet provider I actually ended up saving 105 a month and got faster speeds but you know once you set it up you just kind of leave it and you let it go and and that's where you know you look at you look at your spiritual life it's the same way you have a little thing that's nagging at you just let it go for years and finally it builds up to one big thing so it's good to fix these things cell phone company I called save money on the phone bill you know how much and one thing that I look at with people is is how much is enough all right you know how many shoes do you need how many belts do you need if you ask me how many belts you need you need one belt okay you need one belt it could be Brown and it'll fit anything it'll match anything Joel's shaking his head I have one pair of dress shoes one pair of work shoes one pair of tennis shoes and one work boots it's all I need I got two feet can't wear them more at the same time now you don't have to be as Extreme as me you got again you shouldn't be unhappy right if this causes you to be an unhappy irritable person that your spouse is like oh man I just gave a dollar in the off extra in the offering and my husband just head flew off you know like you don't want to be you want to get to that point you want to do this but that's again goes back to why are you doing this you know for me again if I could get up in the mornings and and just be with my family I think that'd be just the greatest thing I love home more than anywhere that's it's hard to get me to go away from my house I enjoy my home and so so that's my why I want to do that so if you don't have the correct wife it's just a big build build up money and drive nice cars and do those things that's fine that's a good why you should do that if you can that's fine but you've got to make sure your why is right okay you don't want to you don't want to cause stress or hardship or anything else on your family life is hard enough so um so how much is enough you need to ask yourself that question you know I think I've got I won't I won't skip ahead but you know one thing that taught me working at a funeral for nine years is you don't take it with you right that's one of the I was very fortunate I say I was very fortunate to work in the funeral home but now a lot of the remaining people they would fight over money but the one that was gone not a word about it no one woke up and said hey put the money in the casket you can't do that you can't take it with you you can't so how much is enough what is enough now again that's up to you and your wife you individually that's up to you all so there was a study I did it one time it takes a very very long time but there's a book called your money or your it's called your life or your money it was written Vicki Robinson did a review of it I can't remember who actually wrote the book but what the study did is it had you go back and track every scent that had come into your life so like I went back even when I had birthday money I would write that down and the amount of money that I had had come into my life was astronomical it was a lot more than I would have thought and then I looked at what I had left over I was like oh so you can do this the book is called your money excuse me your life or your money and there's a work there's a work program in there that says track every sin that's coming to your life and what they deal with in that book and they call it life energy um they're a little hippie-ish but it's you're trading your life energy for for for money you're trading you so when I go to work eight hours a day I'm trading eight hours of my life which if you look at my life expectancy I'm almost halfway there at 45 years left of life expectancy that's that's where I'm at so if you look at that I'm trading eight hours of that precious time and I think if you if you were to go in the funeral home you know I've never had anyone say to me I wish they made more money I wish they did this always I wish I had more time that's what everyone has said is I wish we had more time I've never had anyone come up oh man I wish you had just bought this new car with this bunny that way I wouldn't have to go through probate nobody I wish I had more time so there's a lot of neat exercises that you can do and what that does is it paints a picture for you and you can kind of see where you've been where you're at now and then you have the choice I think what's the coolest thing is you have the choice to alter your future in a good way bad way whatever way you want you have the choice to now alter that and change that trajectory of your family and again that's why I say you know with with my kids I think it's in Proverbs it says a wise man leaves an inheritance to his children's children that's a big thing to leave it to your children's children you have changed the generational wealth of your family as to where your children come into an inheritance and it's so much and and they have been taught to manage that so well that their children and you change the generational wealth of your family now The Next Step baby step three save three to six months of expenses and I put in here free at last free at last but your debt is all paid off now and you've got throwing stuff Caleb so how do you figure out how much three to six months of expenses you need you write down your expenses and you multiply it you write down your monthly expenses you multiply it times three or six again hard math that's how you figure it out now you want to take your total budget this is not just bills that are actually going to come due in the next six months you want to look at your expenses over the year right so if you've got you know an electric bill is obviously higher in July and August in Arkansas than it is in April or May so you want to go back through it is a lot of homework but you get your bills from your electric company from January to December [Laughter] you can't be talking in class to it oh is she mom quit making noises you're bothering Stewart just the way you saw sometimes gets us son-in-laws but you want to annualize it okay and then you get an average that's how you want to save your three to six months expense and now I will tell you when you get this done it will it will give you a little peace of mind that is pretty nice and it's not you know in three months three to six months expenses a lot of people think well oh my gosh that's a lot of money well if you've cut your expenses down and you're just living what you necessity what you need it's really not that much you know I look at my house payment my electric payment whatever else I've got I list those expenses out and then I want to have three to six months worth of that so that I can manage okay and again this is we're not pulling any extra money from ties we're not pulling any extra money from offerings if we're given to a family member we're not pulling we just budget those things so that we know what we're doing it's I think Dave Ramsey talks about it really best it's like your your money as soldiers and you're telling each one of them where to go and we'll get into this year when we do the second class we'll do a zero based budget and it's where and Jenny had a hard time with us and she's streaming right now but and we still we talk about this today but you tell every dollar where to go so at the end of the month every every month is zero but you you told a hundred dollars to go to savings or 115 to go to investment so but at the end of the month it's always zero you always balance to zero and I'll explain that in the in the budget class but so for like me and Jen I put an example on here so I put Ty's offering um when Jen quit working one thing that we decided to do was to continue to contribute to her retirement account which is an IRA and so let's say you have a spouse that that's working or not working and of course you've got to get to these baby steps you've got to get through this but once we got through that and she did not have to work or we got a business where she could manage that we still continued donating to her or investing in her retirement so that's a good thing to do I'm not saying it's something you have to do but the thing we the way we've got our set up as Jen has an IRA is a Roth IRA so we pay the taxes on the way in and explain some some retirement stuff so a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k you pay the taxes on the way in so you get your money tax-free now 401K you cannot would start withdrawing to 59 and a half so even if you get financially free at 50 you cannot touch your 401k for another nine and a half years an IRA the Roth IRA that we have set up after five years you can touch that money so what we have done is if we by the grace of God get to retire early before I can draw for my 401k we will pull from Jen's Ira to cover that until we can pull from my 401k so does that make that makes sense you need to set up your investment strategy for how you want your life to be in 10 years not for how it is now right so you know in 10 years you know people still be at home because I think when she graduates I'll be 50 I don't know it's not that old but 50 something 53 maybe no yeah yeah it's not that old so our typical budget is Ty's offering investco or excuse me Jen's retirement account in AC Electric then we put money into our savings we budget we put enough money into our kids saving which I'll explain that a little bit Farm life now we have term life insurance which I'll go over if you are a if you are the income producer for your household you need term life insurance what you want to do is you want to try to have 10 years worth of life insurance so I think I have maybe over a million dollar term life policy for like a 20-year Rider I have a million dollars so that so that when I die but that doesn't that's not expensive it's like 57 a month if you're healthy and good a whole life policy for that amount would cost you two 200 plus now it does it does accumulate cash and and the way they sell you a whole life policy is is you get that money back at the end but my goal is to be self-insured by the time that I'm at retirement age where I have no debt so if I died my wife would have enough money to live right so the term life for you young working guys you need term life insurance for 10 years of what you're making now so that your wife does not have to go back to work within the next 10 years she can have time to think about it deal with it um God leads a new man into her life I don't know how that works but but she's got time all right she'd have to run to the next guy that's got money right we give her options some people like that joke but you do you you do need that so then we're going down to our ATT Bill State Farm for auto groceries gas restaurants and I had on here uh rent or or home uh house payment so a lot of people were like you know you can't eat out on this budget you can if you budget for it you can do whatever you budget for and a lot of people are like this tells you all the things I can't do and actually it tells you all the things you can do and so you set guide limits and and guide rails for yourself and so I'm getting about I'm getting really really close I'm gonna speed up so it is achievable um imagine you know when your homework tonight or over the next few weeks is to go home and write out your expenses and your income so that we can come back and we can do a budget but imagine having all the money that you typically spend on bills or unnecessary expenses momentary Pleasers all that money being saved for emergencies and just imagine how much better that would be you know go home tonight and imagine that and be like you know if if something happened to me tomorrow I really wouldn't have to worry about these things for for three to six months this fund is set up to give you peace of mind completely it's not something you invest you don't take this money and put an investment that you can't get your hands on this is money you just set aside for Peace of Mind it'll make your home life better it'll make everything better now there's nothing like the peace that Christ can give you Christ gives you a peace that passes all understanding but this financial piece is an Earthly peace this journey is hard enough don't make it worse by adding unnecessary stress on yourself okay we do not save The Horde we save to protect our families and Give Peace of Minds and a troubled word world is that right brother Bynum actually said God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy he said the human heart was made to be happy and if you go and ask a lot of people what their stress is in life they will say money and even even for me you look at what inflation has done to the grocery bill of the average family over the last little bit is astronomical I bought two things of Velveeta cheese and her Mississippi mud cake this morning before church and it was 28 dollars for the you know the really nice big Velveeta cheese that some of y'all may have ate just crazy how much that costs milk five dollars four four plus for a gallon of milk so in 2020 gas was one or 2019 179 now it's 339 349 so you know during that time having this extra money and having the the little Consumer Debt or not having that it your lifestyle doesn't have to change in those Ebbs and flows of the economy so so understand that baby step four is invest 15 of your income or retirement a lot of you self-employed guys or girls you don't have the option to where your employer comes in and says you know I'm gonna match three six percent whatever you give I'm gonna match it and it is hard to go find your own investing um financial advisor um I remember me and Jen tried one time this guy just made me so mad we paid off all our debt we had a little bit of money and uh I remember he sat down with us and we want to start investing this was before I think this is right after we got back and did all these steps and and it just wasn't enough for him oh man it just kind of flew all over me you know so it is hard to find a financial advisor because they're looking for Big Ticket items but find someone if you have to get turned away two or three times you'll eventually run into someone who has your your best interests at heart so um what you want to do is take 15 of your income and invest towards retirement now remember the way these baby steps work which we'll we'll go over that in the budget list them out for you about 13 minutes you cannot move on to the next step to the previous step is done so you don't move to step three until two is done one's done you want me to four to one two and three is done so if you have an employer that that matches and I've heard a lot of people say no offense to message people and myself included but we all have this mentality that which I believe the Rapture could happen tomorrow bro Ben's getting really nervous but I've talked to so many message people who are like we don't need to invest because the Rapture is coming that's great I told brother Ben the other day I feel like I'm going to invest all my life and then as soon as I retire the Rapture is going to take place and I'm going to have all this planned out it's God's sense of humor for me which is fine either way I win right so you might as well go ahead and plan now because it would really sting to get to the end and be like oh I've got to keep I've got to keep working you got to keep working now my plan for retirement is many of you know I don't like to sit still yesterday our day off we worked all day and we enjoyed it the family did things together we and we cleaned out the cars we did these things and so you know my idea of retiring is not just to sit around and do nothing I want to be active I want to do things so when you hear this retirement phrase a lot of people think well I'm just gonna sit down and die that's not what you're that's not what you're supposed to do that's not it okay now you do not start investing until you're through baby step three and um you've got to understand when you get into investing you need a financial advisor and I'm not it so don't don't come to me with investing questions because you need someone who knows and understands the market and your age you know right now I was talking to somebody the other day an economic crash for me in the stock market is great because I buy things cheaper for the next three to five years but I'm not retiring for 10 plus so for me I can go and buy all this stuff cheaper but for somebody who's retiring in the next three to five years if they haven't pulled out and got into some fixed assets or fixed funds that's horrible for them so you need a financial advisor who's going to lead you in the right right direction they're going to look at your age look at your plan and they're going to go off of that okay I know we got off on the Weeds on that one maybe step five is safe for your kids to go to college I really do pray and I know I said it before I really pray my kids do not go to college I'm going to let them make the final decision obviously um but something neat that Jen and I do is we put um we opened some piggyback say pinky Bank savings piggyback nobody you know piggyback ride Piggy Bank savings for our kids and we put ten dollars a week in there it's budgeted so 30 a week goes to our kids now we use that money throughout the year we go to Brand Center we birthdays presents Christmas presents we have access to use that money and we do use it that's what it's there for so that's something cool we do because you know there's there's expenses that come through all the time but if you kind of just chip at it a little bit it really helps even equalize things out um my goal for my children just to tell you about I got nine minutes and I'm gonna speed through this and give you your homework my goal for my children is is to hopefully work for themselves or get you know you know if they want to be say a plumber um and they get they get that trades and they and they can work for themselves and they have the ability to make as much money as they want you know I think they say um the only business that has an infinite ability to increase profitability as an entrepreneur because they can make as much money as they want right now we know there's a limit to that but but still but that's what I would pray my kids would do and so I've already started working with my kids on what it is how to deal with money you need to talk to your kids about money they need to understand you know I talked to my Matty the other day I'm like you know when you ask me I'm going to take you to the store and you go and you go in there and you buy ten dollars worth of things I was like you know my mom worked hard for that money you know and trying to explain to them what the cost actually is it's her time that she had to go to work and earn that money and now she spent on that now if she wants to that's fine but it's not to where we always get our hand out we want things and teaching our kids because they're about to be filled with a life full of consumerism if you've been um I'm not saying anyone's been to an arcade lately but if you have what you've noticed used to you get tokens right you got tokens at the arcade you can play games with them now they've got cards they're training kids for for credit cards everything is centered around that that's what they're doing conspiracy theorist number one but you've got to teach your kids how to manage money and and I know I'm probably sound mean um but you know I want my kids to be workers too I don't want them to be lazy so going ahead and having them work now and paying them some money when they do work these things pay off down the road or I believe they will um and all of your kids are going to be different some are going to be natural Savers some are to be natural Spenders but teach your kids you know one thing I've really been working on is teaching your kids that the experience is so much greater than the thing right you know we're about to go on vacation or um the other day we went we rode over to the mountains and we just hit swimming holes all day we ate lunch cost us a little bit of money we drove the gas over there and we just hit free swimming holes on public land and that was a blast we collected rocks and teaching them it's more about the experience than us going to say Branson and spending a thousand dollars over the weekend but you've got to teach your kids that and and they see that it matters to you you know if if you're more about the items they're going to be more about the items they're going to do what you do baby step six is pay off the house um simple enough all excess cast goes to the house except for the 15 you're investing and what you have budgeted for the rest of your life and expenses baby step seven is called build wealth and give so the final step is don't be greedy when you become a person of value become a person that changes lives for the better so a quote from that book that I was talking about your money or your life he who knows he has enough is Rich so being happy with what you've got that's when you become wealthy if you live for having it all what you have is never enough so you know I was looking at I was reading the Joshua chapter one to our kids the other night before they went to bed before school and uh you know the scriptures be strong and very courageous and it goes down through there and what I never really realized you know the the two tribes and you ministers helped me out the two tribes that were getting their land on this side of Jordan right do you remember what Joshua said to them he said you're going to go cross with us and fight right and so I never really realized that and you know you get a lot of people who think and my promise is done I've been given my promise but what I love about the moral of that story is until everyone else had received their promise they had to go help right so you you older people you think well I'm done I've got my promise I've saved filled with a holy ghost I'm done well there's others that still need help fighting this fight right so so what that showed to me was like well yeah I've I've got it maybe I've got my stuff in control if you want to call Controlled Chaos but we should give and help others right so remember that five minutes I promise brother Ben so what we will do when we come back is we'll go over what's called a zero balance budget okay so what you're going to do when you go home tonight and this will actually tell who's wanting to be in the class and who's not but you'll write out your expenses you'll write out your income okay then what you're going to do is you're going to highlight your necessary expenses then you're going to underline your unnecessary expenses okay it's a little bit of work go to the bank get your bank statements pay for them if you have to whatever you got to do do it don't don't wait till tomorrow do it tonight and you're going to go through and you're going to list all this out and then I'm going to show you how to do a zero balance budget next week okay actually not sure when it is two weeks intentional spending once versus needs now money is something that you trade your life energy for you sell your time for money it doesn't matter if Ned sells his time over there for a hundred dollars and you sell it for twenty dollars an hour Ned's money is irrelevant to you the only real asset you have is your time the hours in your life that's really the only asset that we truly have you know if somebody sells their their money for or sells their time for a hundred dollars an hour and I sell it for 20 it doesn't matter that's irrelevant doesn't matter if people make more money than you doesn't matter if people make less money than you what you do with your time and your money management is between you and your spouse and God right so it's nothing that I'm going to get my nose into nothing anyone else should get their nose into but it is something you should get your nose into you should manage your money just like you manage your time and I put this in here just to kind of show you an example you know if you're if you're typical if you're 25 years old your life expectancy for a guy um is 54.8 years so it's about 480 000 hours that you have left of life expectancy if you're 30 you got 50 years if you're 40 you got 40 years so the more of that time that I can buy back now the better that I'm going to be the happier that I'm going to be so a financial plan is something that has to be intentional you have to follow it and the thing that you have to remember with budgeting is where money controlled you now you control it it's where you lived your life by how much money you had or didn't have now you live your life on a plan okay it gives you the control back okay I uh I did a little thing for y'all just before we go I added up how many vehicles me and Jen had bought from 07 to 2020 when we really got on the plan or 20 2018 sorry it's been about 227 thousand dollars on vehicles four-wheelers in about 13 years and that was just a new rig every year right new four-wheeler here new four wheeler there average car payment of 500 a month since 2000 to 2007 to 2020 is about 78 Grand so if you just had a car payment for the last few years that's what you're looking at so I factored up how much money that cost me in hours it cost me about 4 333 hours of my life to make those payments that I'll never get back so when I put in that I was like okay I get this you know you know it's 333 hours I didn't have with her thousand I didn't have Paxton two thousand I didn't have a matinee a thousand I didn't have a gin so it starts adding up I'm gonna skip through to the very end okay if you want to get with me after this we've got one minute your homework the first sheet you want to list out all your expenses I mean all if you spend money on something stupid just write down stupid expense the second sheet is you list out all your income if you work multiple jobs W2 whatever it is you list it out then you go back to the first sheet you highlight your needs underline your wants second session we'll go over how to make a zero dollar budget the next financial class will be September 17th and that's when we'll actually get into the budget and we'll actually really dig into the Weeds does anybody have any questions or any comments no is it fun all right I think I think it will it will it will change your life for the better okay all right you were dismissed until three o'clock
