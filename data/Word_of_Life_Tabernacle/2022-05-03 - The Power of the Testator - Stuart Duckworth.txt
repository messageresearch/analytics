TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen you love the lord this evening amen we just appreciate amen being able to come to the house of the lord deceiving him amen no doubt amen maybe some of us sacrifice to be here just you know maybe just driving in the rain but i believe god will god will bless his people here tonight amen if we could let's just turn the scriptures tonight to hebrews 9 and 13. i'll speak to you tonight on the power of the testator amen in understanding his will understanding amen what god has given us the inheritance amen amen hebrews 9 and 13 forth the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god amen and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death about for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for the testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth amen let's just buy our hearts before him lord we come before you tonight father lord we just a privileged people lord just to be able to come one more time lord in your presence lord just over the past several services lord you lord you've just come down in such a special way lord i can think back just even when our brother joel ministered and just lord how you you moved lord and you've you've moved among us in such a special way lord and we don't want to take that for granted god we want to thank you for that and lord may the continuity of the spirit just flow tonight lord lord may we be able to receive from the word lord may the fullness you the fullness may you come down lord manifest yourself to us lord speak to every heart every life bless your word lord we pray lord as we would talk about it as we would minister lord lord bring that which is needed to your people we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you can be seated [Music] amen i mean i believe tonight that god is able amen to supply all that we could think or ask yes amen and it's those things that are lasting and eternal value i think we should seek before all else amen jesus said seek ye therefore the kingdom of god amen and his righteousness and all these things will be added amen he said take no thought for tomorrow amen your father knows what you had in need of it you believe he knows what you have need of here tonight amen before we could even ask he already knows amen amen and if we put him first if we'll just let him be lord if we'll let him just be god tonight he'll come down and speak to us he'll come down and meet my needs he'll meet your needs amen i believe that he's rich in many things amen he he has cattle on a thousand hills and man whatever you whatever you would need of he's able to provide that but i'm thankful tonight amen of something of value that he's a god rich in mercy amen i believe that tonight amen as we reference our scripture here amen amen there's a testator amen there's a testament there there's been a will right amen and jesus tonight he is the mediator of the will the inheritance of the saints and by the death of the testator the infor the enforcement i want to say tonight of the will is in full effect amen and to understand a will or for it to have any significance your name has to be in that will yes right right your name has to be called you you have to receive a copy of that will of that testament i mean you have to be identified in the will for it to have any meaning to you yes i mean and to be identified in that inheritance you must have a connection with the testator the one that's leaving behind the inheritance the one who made the will yes amen but i want to say tonight that there's one who would try to bring an objection to the will and that is the accuser of the brethren amen he would try to make you confused amen in order to think that this inheritance this blessing is not for you amen but the bible says that we overcome him amen by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony amen our names have been identified in the will they've been identified in the book amen our names are written there before the foundation of the world amen before satan amen can bring any accusation god had already wrote it out in heaven he had already declared that you would partake in this inheritance that you will partake in this testament yes sir yes yes sir amen amen so i want to i want to say tonight i want to think tonight you know what a powerful blood we have yes amen that when there would come an objection when there would come an accusation and when we've got a blood amen we've got a blood there a power there amen amen we've got a testimony on our lips and then we've got the truth of god and when the power of god the life of god amen there to defeat the enemy to overcome him and then we look at the old testament sacrifice amen and just referencing our first scripture there every year how that blood would perfect them how they would bring a cleansing yes amen in god's eyes that was righteous and every year the individual would bring a lamb it had to be a spotless lamb the very best lamb they they would bring the very best that they had and the priest would bring that sacrifice before the mercy seat into that shekinah presence and there god would accept that because because that's what god required amen and the believer could go away clean could go away righteous before god amen and there was a sanctification there aiming then god for a time was pleased with that and when the worshiper amen he he could leave there he could leave there and know that that he he done what god required but yet he would leave there with the same desire that he came with yes sir there would be no change i mean because the nate nature of that animal could never come back upon that human even in hebrews it says but the law was a shadow of good things to come amen that sacrifice could never make never make that person perfect but we read here in john 1 and 17 for the law was given by moses but grace and truth about jesus christ amen amen brother graham said god by the prophets god by the prophets under that law they condemned us to sin and the law had no grace it had no delivering power i mean it was only what god required for a little bit i mean it just tells you that your center it don't make no way out but brother brown says hearing the master in peace he says but when jesus came on the scene he was a fulfillment he was a fulfillment of everything that god had promised he was the perfect identical image of the promise therefore all promises of the old testament was met in jesus christ amen amen we were condemned amen but he came in truth and grace amen he came i don't know what happened to my volume i guess i maybe i stepped over there and it sounded a little different amen but jesus came and man he fulfilled the law amen amen amen and he made a way for you and i mean he came in truth and grace and so our jesus is that that perfect son of god amen that god required a near kinsman amen to be able to redeem that which was lost god required in his law amen that there would be a kinsmen amen and not only that not only to redeem amen but but to be able to bring a change amen amen to be able to bring an atonement god required a blood and to bring an atonement for sin amen and i want to say it tonight tonight in him was fulfillment in him was all the fulfillment of that old testament he fulfilled that to the letter he feel that fulfilled everything that was said about him do you believe that tonight in him was fulfillment amen and in him tonight is your fulfillment amen he is in everything within him he's the truth and grace amen they could set us free they could bring a change amen well we could go away tonight amen not the same the same way we were amen but we could go away and then when we come in this presence we could go away change we could go away different yes yes because we're not under the law he fulfilled that yes amen we're under truth and grace now by jesus christ oh what a blood it is oh what a blood he brought brother ram says hear the blood of jesus christ thinking of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen a law could never do that amen somebody beating you over the head with with with what they think or some rule or regulation it could never do that amen but when he came but when he came with grace and truth i mean that brought us to a justification it brought us to a to a place of virtue yes amen a place to where where we could be unadulterated amen when we were the pure virgin word bride of jesus christ amen amen no man's idea no man beating you over the head would ever produce that only him coming down in grace and truth will bring you to that so we stand justified amen by the bleeding word amen it's a word that's got life in it amen amen the law can never deliver you amen some idea could never deliver you amen but it's a bleeding word tonight amen it's got life in it amen it'll change you it'll make you what you ought to be amen amen we stand redeemed by the blood of the lamb amen that's what he done for us amen buys by the life by his truth by his grace he's able to make you free amen that he he the perfect son of god could come down amen amen and in himself amen offer himself amen without spot offer himself and give himself for a sacrifice and accepting that and providing that he gained himself a church without spot he gave himself a church that was washed there's been clings that's been purged amen by his bleeding word that's what his objective was yes amen that was his objective he he he purchased you and i yes with his own blood amen we we are in his inheritance amen we've been washed purged clean made whole amen and coming to a perfection in him by the blood amen the blood makes you perfect yes and and there is a perfect groom if there is a perfect groom if there was if there was one that could fulfill every bit of the old testament coming that perfection coming in in what was said of him to be amen amen if there's a if there's a perfect groom there's got to be a perfect bride that's right amen matthew 5 and 48 jesus said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect amen so if he if if we're required to be perfect he's got a way got to make a way for us to be perfect right he can't just say something and and just expect for us to try to figure it out on our own or you know try to come up with some idea or or just try to try to take on some some religion and try to do our best but he's got to make a way he's got to make a way amen and when he comes in grace and truth amen by his bleeding word and then he makes a way brother branham says here he said how could you ever be perfect but in the side of a side of christ tonight every born-again christian is perfect i'm just as perfect in god as christ was you are too every every other believer for it's not my holiness it's his holiness god can't accept mine i have none but i come in christ by faith and by christ i'm in him and perfect in the sight of god so so it's possible it's possible for us to come to that amen i think that that we we get too down on ourselves sometimes we get two down on ourselves but if we'll look at ourselves through christ what god has in store for you and i yeah we can achieve that if we look at ourselves as unworthy if we listen to the accusations and the objections of the accuser we will never overcome we will never rise under the inheritance the eternal inheritance that god has got for us that he's laid out for us but god buys blood yes and i want to talk about the perfection that he performs in you but there's also perfection of maturing that takes place after that perfection comes in yes in the sight of god we stand perfect tonight if you're in christ you stand completely god sees you just as he sees jesus christ because he's looking at you through that blood through that perfect sacrifice that's how god sees you but there's got to come a maturity yes there's got to come a perfecting of the saints as it says in ephesians 4 amen then that's what the work of the ministry is for to bring bring a perfection and not beat it over your head not to try to usurp authority over over the the purchased possession of god over the people of god amen but to bring amen the word before the people amen to bring the promise of god before the people to bring to bring out what in the world your potentials can be to what my potentials can be and what god said you can be and that you can that you can have the right kind of attitude going forth that you're already perfect the work the work of justification sanctification the indwelling of the holy ghost and the ceiling the ceiling of the holy ghost sir you're perfect yes you're perfect you can you can walk in this life god can never take that back and i was talking to my daughter about baptism talking to her about the holy ghost and i tried to explain to her that the holy ghost was like god wrapping his arms around us and saying that satan this is my property and you you don't have any right or any access to this right and we've got to come to that and that is a perfection yes god sees you just as he sees christ but if you stay if we just stay in that mindset if we just just stay right there and you'll make it you'll make it but there's a perfection that's got to come there's a there's a maturing in the word there's something that god wants to bring us to you understand what i'm saying brother peter we let me get you back up here and preach buddy i appreciate our young people amen i remember having to get up and give testimonies like that it ain't easy but i think he he kind of likes doing it he's giving him a hard time everybody else does i tell him to take it easy on him amen so so there's a perfection in christ and there's a perfection that comes with the word that he's revealed to you and i yes we're perfected we're perfected by his blood and then there's a perfecting maturing and this speaking of the will and and our title under understanding the will understanding the testament and what god has left to us to be able to understand the will there has to be a maturity there you have to come to a maturity you know our children coming to baptism coming to salvation amen coming to the holy ghost and and that's their form it's their form just like it was there for you and i the oldest to the youngest it's there for everybody we have access to that tonight amen but amen but they got to come to that but if you've already come to that we got to go on up in maturity we got to move on up into christ not that not that we would try to be above anybody else amen but if i can come to maturity if i can come to an understanding amen i want to try to help somebody yes amen and i can't give i can't give nobody what i don't have myself you understand amen but but if somebody's got something i don't don't have it brother ben i expect him to tell me about it i expect to him i expect him to not hold back the whole council of god right i don't want nothing held back we don't want to hold nothing back if we can help somebody if we can lift them up if we can if we can help them along along the way a little bit that's that's what we do as mature christians we don't beat nobody over the head or trying to beat them down we're here to lift one another up is that right amen just talking about my daughter i can't give her the holy ghost brother and so we can impart eternal life but god has to give her the holy ghost i can bring her to the word yes you understand i can bring her to the understanding i i can bring her i can create a an atmosphere but ultimately it takes it takes that predestinated moment for each and every one of us amen to come to that it takes god to come down and do that yes sir you understand amen but but but that's what god wants you wants a mature church amen i i think we can i think we can handle anything i think i think we can handle the objections i think we can handle the accusations amen because because you got us you got to see your place you got to see your perfection you got to see you got to you got to see where satan's place is and then that's what's the what the word is done in this hour it's identified our position it's identified the position of the word it's identified the position of satan it's told us who he is who we are who has spoken to us in this day and it gives us an understanding and so we ought to be able to move forward with confidence and know that that there's going to be fiery darts there's going to be accusations amen but it ain't nothing but a bluff it ain't nothing but a bluff because christ is here and he's here and he's manifesting himself and abroad amen that was his goal amen and i believe that's what we ought to come to i believe that ought to be our goal is to let him come in the fullness and in his power amen and whatever he wants whatever he wants to give us because because our testing and i'll get to it a little bit our testator did not stay dead but he's alive forevermore we'll get to that in a little bit he's alive amen and there's an inheritance for you and i tonight and he wants to make sure that we know what it is amen so the fullness of the word the fullness of the word came in this day do you believe that yes everything that god had to reveal amen i believe he's revealed him yes i don't believe that we're waiting on nothing i don't believe that we're waiting on rapture and faith i i believe we got it right now and i think if if we got an enough faith to be raptured i think if we've got rapture and faith tonight i think we've got everything pretty well covered don't you if a prophet told me that that we've got rapture and faith and now i'll just i'll just take it like it is i'll take it like he said it i'm not looking for nothing else but i want to let him come and as our brother matt said i want more of it i'm not satisfied with what i had yesterday i'm not satisfied with yesterday's experience yesterday's manna amen but i believe the fullness is here and i want more of it i want less of myself and more of him amen so if the fullness amen the fullness of the word came in this day the fullness of he the godhead bodily amen that it the godhead body that it might manifest again in a people who have received it the people have received the word and many he wants to manifest that fullness again amen and as jesus fulfilled all of what was wrote and spoken of him amen his bride would be in his fullness and maturity and fulfill all the righteousness spoken of her so he fulfilled that testament jesus had an understanding of who he was he had an understanding of of what the word spoke about him and i believe if if we can come to an understanding of what god has left us of what god has given us amen amen let it go beyond just understanding but let it become life to you but we've got to have an understanding first corinthians 13 and 9 for we know in part paul's speaking here saying for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things so paul is saying that amen that that which in part is going to be done away with that that which is perfect is going to come right that there's a perfection coming and maturing amen and when a child becomes a man what did he put away amen the way he spoke yeah come on amen amen paul said when i was a child i speak as a child amen but i put that thing away i put i put away the the way i understood as a child i put those things away i put i put away the childish thinking and then he put away the way he spoke the way he understood the way he thought amen to take to take the mind of god and meant to take the perfection of god and brother branham says here's it he said and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication then when that which is part is done away with i say it's time amen that the church comes to maturity and then put away that old child is thinking put away that old childish way of speaking amen to put the word on your lips and then let the fullness of god amen realize tonight that there ain't nobody else gonna do it for you and when there ain't no preacher gonna do it for you there ain't no prophet gonna come back and do it for you remember god is requiring a church to come to perfection come to maturity and put away that childish thinking and accept the word in its fullness in this hour what the word said she could be amen i believe when we can get all of our little preconceived idea of how things should be and how everything needs to happen just this way amen you've got to die out to your own thinking you've got to take on the mind of christ and make it correct amen corinthians was the book of corrections and here paul was trying to trying to bring a correction let it bring a correction tonight to your thinking and under the way you understand the way you speak it may let it come and bring a correction amen and let it correct how you understand the way you think amen amen just say lord have your way i'm not going to try to figure it out i'm not going to try to do it on my own amen but i want your understanding i want to take on the mind of christ and just let it just let it happen according to your word he just wants a yielded vessel yeah amen we limit god by our own thoughts we limit god by our own ideas and in the message we become our own little organization become our own little little denomination if you go too far with it yeah it's hard to have your own way thank you there ain't nothing wrong with that we're all going to have a little different idea but i believe we all ought to be able to come back to the word yes we all ought to be able to come back to the word if the thing ain't just quite happening like you think it should maybe you need to let the word correct your thoughts the way you're speaking the way you're understanding come up out of that childish well i got this idea come out of that amen that's why we had to come out of of denominations and and different things you and and then a lot of us not not really me i've been in the message my whole life message church and you can develop things along the way it's pretty easy but even in those denominations people tried to carry some of those things over the message but you they had to die out to those things and as as time goes on as time goes on amen if we're not careful we'll develop our own little ideas amen we've got we've got to stay dead to ourselves paul said i gotta die daily that christ may live and die to your own thinking brother burnham said we have the perfect interpretation with divine vindication amen that ought to give us a confidence that ought to that ought to correct our thinking a little bit yeah that we can come to a place and and lay ourselves open lay ourselves open to that to that vindication to that perfect interpretation amen and if you'll stay brother brown said if you you'll stay before the presence of that son amen amen as we listen to the word as we as we as we feast on the message of the hour amen that's not we're not feeding on the the words of amen but we're feeding on the body word of the son of man we're feeding on the word amen and we're laying in the presence of the sun and when a seed lays in the presence of the sun there there it's a seed yeah it's a seed but there has to be a process it has to mature before it can go up in the corner right and we have to come to a maturing amen if we expect to make a rapture that's part of it right amen we're waiting on that last one to get sealed in i believe that but we got to come to maturity too that's right yeah we got to come to that that's what god wants in this hour yes sir amen put away the childish things put away the that old childish way of speaking put the word on your lips brother branham says here in a letter to the church and when he said i'll take up my pen and rot and i'm just going to reference a few things here and i've been hearing some of these things they've been standing out to me the same harmony that jesus had with the father amen when he only did that which pleased the father brother rem said it exists now between the groom and the bride amen and he said he shows her his word of life and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death he said if she goes down just like the seed when it's watered it will raise up again and he said here is the secret the word is in the bride as it was in mary and the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word it's been standing out to me so much i've heard brother ben reference him you know satan in life during life he'll try to confuse you you know he'll he'll try to bring a cloudiness or something but if we'll take what a prophet said that the spirit instructed him to take up the pen and rot and you identify yourself tonight as the bride of jesus christ you say tonight that i have the mind of christ i may not completely fully understand how to how to deal with this person or deal with this situation but i've been called to be the bride of jesus christ and i've been called to have an understanding i've been called to to be able to have have the word to have thus saith the lord he didn't just say that was for brother branham he said it was a letter to the church and i'm not trying to do away brother branham and i know y'all know that he didn't just say it was for the pastor or the preacher but it was for the sister for the deacon for the janitor for for for whoever can come to that maturity and realize who they are in the word amen that that you can go forth and you may not know nothing but your father in heaven he'll give you what you have need of he'll give you what you have need of you he'll he'll tell you what to say if you'll stand there in faith you may not know how to operate from day to day amen things may get so confusing so dark amen but if we'll take the promise if we'll identify with what a prophet said we could be amen that i had the mind of christ i know what god wants done and i'm going to stand today i'm going to take my glorious stand amen amen this bride she's not going to fall she's not going to fall amen i can walk with confidence amen amen satan i believe god kept that back from satan i was talking to my wife you know when you say something satan hears that then he knows about it but god reserved that in in this day and satan has always tried to destroy the seed he always thought he had him he always thought he had him he thought he had christ amen when he brought it when he went down to hell even but our lord overcame because he was ordained to overcome he was the fulfillment and the bride in this last days she's the fulfillment and she's the recipient of the covenant of the will of this last testament she's the fulfillment of the new testament [Music] and there ain't nothing he can do about it that's right but he'll bring objections he'll bring accusations amen but we will overcome him by the blood of the lamb by the perfection yes we will overcome him amen not us but christ in us yes it's his blood it's his word amen amen the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name she has thus saith the lord and he said and god quickens his word by the spirit to come to pass a seed is planted and watered and it comes to full harvest serving its purpose that's what god is an intention is today for the word not to let it fall by the wayside amendment that it might serve its purpose some some plant some water but god gives the increase we can't do nothing we can we can only throw the seed we can water it we can water with praise amen but the life-giver is god he's the one that brings the increase say man i want to be a hundredfold tonight hey man i want the word to fall on good ground amen i want it to come to its maturity in my life i don't want to sit stagnant sit still sit in an old old old condition where where i'm not growing much and you know i want to get out in the sun a little bit yeah i want a little bit of rain every now and then feed me the message of the hour let me be in a holy ghost meeting every now and then it ain't going to be that every service but every now and then lord give us some understanding give us more understanding give us more of you send the reign amen let the sea let the word of the hour fulfill its purpose in me amen yes thank you jesus hebrews 9 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament we read this before that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that we're under the first testament they which are called not receive the promise of eternal inheritance amen our inheritance won't pass away but it's an eternal inheritance first timothy 2 5 said for there is one god one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom to all to be testified in due time amen our mediator he's able to intervene on our behalf and that's his position tonight amen our testator he didn't stay dead amen but he's alive forevermore he's alive forevermore and he stands there tonight he stands there tonight intervening on our behalf even to restore us amen he has given himself a ransom amen for the price of redemption amen they're making good on your confession yes amen making good on what you put on your lips right if you can put the word on your lips he's able to make good on it i believe that tonight there he stands as a mediator amen by the blood of christ by by that blood he purged us he made a way for us and he stands there as a mediator not tonight of the new testament of the will of the covenant of the arrangement that we have with god amen what is the arrangement that we have that whatsoever you ask the father in my name that will i do jesus spoke that word he spoke that and he's there to make good on it tonight i believe that yes amen whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do ask the father what is the covenant that we have it's an unconditional covenant amen he has swore by himself that he would do it he has swore by jesus christ amen and he has sent back the holy ghost as a confirmation in its unmerited favor the grace of jesus christ to you and i yes he's the testator of that tonight he is the mediator of the will by his death bringing redemption amen from that old life amen he just didn't leave us the way we were but he changed us that they they which are called and might receive the promise of eternal inheritance amen he brought us from death under life amen that we might receive an eternal inheritance and brother branham says here when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made you before the foundation of the world that is your potential you got potentials in your denied amen it's the potential what is the potential it's the earnest of you being quickened from mortal to immortality that's the inheritance that god's given you tonight i can leave my kids 10 million dollars and that's going to pass away that's going to go away i could leave them laying houses it's all going to corrupt it's all going to pass away amen but god and when the testator amen by his blood has redeemed us and brought us to an eternal inheritance amen where my body amen i've received the earnest i received amen that what's that down payment amen that god by the holy ghost he's bringing me to a rapture he's bringing me to a body change amen if i got the holy ghost tonight i got every bit of that in me let's see eternal inheritance yes god ain't gonna change your body rapture you up and then condemn you it's an eternal inheritance don't miss it don't miss out on it yes re read the book go on going and read the book find your name there identify yourself in the word yes he says he says here in 1951 i thought this was so good he says now i try to speak to the best of my knowledge all that i know how to glorify jesus christ who has redeemed us all redeemed us from everything that the fall consists of he became against redeemer to redeem the human race back to god and then we have the earnest of our salvation that what we have now this glorious holy spirit is only the earnest of our being above sin in the rapture oh my amen it's an eternal and an eternal inheritance this holy ghost and he said what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now the earnest that you're going in a rapture it's the earnest yes we got the down payment tonight church we got the down payment of the rapture the down payment of the rapture amen is living within you walk in faith tonight walk in confidence tonight walking confidence in this world the few days that we have left amen amen let the hands are hung down let them raise up amen let the let the feeble knees the feeble the feeble bodies of the feeble minds of people understanding the feeble way of speaking let it raise up tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you've got an inheritance amen not god's not going to give it to you he's already given it to you amen by the holy ghost it's just as good as the rapture tonight amen we can partake and then we can partake of a rapturing grace of a rapturing faith and then we can stand tonight and say we are the redeemed amen we can stand tonight and identify ourselves with the greatest message that's ever struck the face of
