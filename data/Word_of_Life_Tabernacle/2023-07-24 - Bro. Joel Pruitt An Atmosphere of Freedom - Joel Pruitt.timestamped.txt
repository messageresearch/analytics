[36:14] me say I ask in Jesus name we pray
[36:17] amen amen are you happy to be in the
[36:20] house of the Lord this evening
[36:21] man it's good to good to be here I I
[36:23] think I over ate a little bit and hey
[36:28] I was eating over there and I told told
[36:30] somebody I said The more I eat the
[36:32] shorter I'm going to preach and they
[36:34] said well hey go get another plate
[36:38] well
[36:40] I'll try not to hold you long but where
[36:42] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[36:43] liberty and we want to take our Liberty
[36:45] and just have church here tonight is
[36:46] that okay amen if you have your Bibles
[36:48] turn to Galatians chapter 5 and verse
[36:51] one we'll just read one verse and then
[36:53] you'll be able to be seated Galatians 5
[36:55] and 1.
[36:56] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[36:59] wherewith Christ hath made us free and
[37:02] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[37:05] bondage may the Lord add His blessings
[37:07] you may be seated
[37:08] I want to draw your attention there to
[37:11] stand fast
[37:13] in the Liberty
[37:14] where Christ hath made us free we're not
[37:17] free because we feel free we're free
[37:19] because we serve a God who has made us
[37:21] free we are under the blood which has
[37:24] made us free and we're thankful for that
[37:26] and now we live in an age that's good
[37:28] thank you buddy in this age Satan wants
[37:32] to keep us from the presence of God how
[37:34] many knows that he will do everything he
[37:36] can to keep you from the house of God he
[37:39] will do everything he can to keep you
[37:40] from the presence of God because he
[37:42] knows that if you ever get into the
[37:43] presence of God then something will take
[37:46] place now you may not immediately accept
[37:48] God and what he has for you but you'll
[37:50] never be able to forget the presence
[37:52] that you experienced and so he wants to
[37:55] bind us by something now remember Satan
[37:57] is always wanting to bind to the people
[38:00] but that is not what God wants us to do
[38:02] God has not given us a spirit of fear he
[38:04] doesn't bind us by fear God has not
[38:05] given us a a a a an authority by a man
[38:09] to stand up here and say well you've got
[38:10] to do this at a certain time and you can
[38:12] you can come and do this and you know
[38:13] the way you worship it's not under order
[38:16] by a man that would run the church but
[38:18] it is under order by God how God is
[38:20] running the church and God has given us
[38:22] the ability to have freedom
[38:25] in worship how many believes that
[38:27] tonight
[38:28] but Satan knows that if you're ever in
[38:30] the presence of God that you lose the
[38:33] fear and the chains that he is holding
[38:36] you by and so he wants to bind You by
[38:38] something and so what he's done is he
[38:39] has given us distractions today to bind
[38:42] the people he will give you a
[38:43] distraction maybe if it's Sports they're
[38:45] in the football season and if your
[38:47] favorite team loses and and they lose to
[38:49] a team that you really don't like Satan
[38:51] will come on the scene and he'll give
[38:52] you a bad attitude or or something
[38:54] that'll that'll make you feel bad you'll
[38:56] carry that over into church if you're
[38:57] not careful because really that has no
[39:00] has no authority over your life or it
[39:02] shouldn't but what we do is we give that
[39:04] that a spot in our life we give what we
[39:07] we give the devil a place to come in and
[39:10] make us miserable Christians
[39:12] but what we should do is lay that aside
[39:14] lay aside every weight that would so
[39:16] easily beset us but press forward into
[39:19] the liberty of Christ how many believes
[39:21] that tonight we don't need to be bound
[39:23] by the things of the world I'm not
[39:24] saying you shouldn't watch sports I'm
[39:26] not saying you shouldn't do whatever in
[39:27] in the world and go to amusement parks
[39:29] where I'm not saying all that what I'm
[39:31] saying is don't let those things bind
[39:33] you and keep you from experiencing the
[39:35] presence of God because I believe that
[39:37] when you're in his presence things can
[39:39] happen God can heal you in his presence
[39:41] there is salvation in his presence and
[39:43] I'm just crazy enough to believe that if
[39:45] I bring my children to church and let
[39:47] them sit in the presence of God then God
[39:49] can change their life just like he did
[39:51] mine because if you stay home you can't
[39:53] be as good of a Christian if you go out
[39:55] here and you run run around you go to
[39:57] you can go to Every rodeo in the country
[39:58] you can go to Every ball game in the
[40:00] country and those are good things but if
[40:02] you forsake the assembling of yourselves
[40:04] on the house of God God is not ever
[40:06] going to move on those young people's
[40:08] lives but if you'll bring them here
[40:09] where the presence of God is and the
[40:12] word is being and preach then something
[40:13] can take hold of them and they can grab
[40:15] a hold of that brother I think it's time
[40:17] that freedom has come back to the house
[40:19] of God how many believes that we don't
[40:22] need to be bound by by chains of bondage
[40:24] any longer we don't want to be bound by
[40:26] the by the world any longer but we need
[40:28] to be free through Christ who has made
[40:30] us free
[40:31] take your Liberty tonight and feel free
[40:34] because we have a freedom to worship
[40:37] when we come to this country our
[40:39] ancestors come to the come to this
[40:41] country our forefathers they come over
[40:42] here because they wanted freedom to
[40:43] worship and now for some reason we are
[40:46] cycling right back around to trying to
[40:49] be back in bondage with our worship
[40:50] again well I'll tell you if God has made
[40:52] you free and you are covered by the
[40:54] blood then nobody can shut you up from
[40:56] worshiping God in the way that's called
[40:58] crazy that's how we're going to worship
[41:00] you see well I don't like them people
[41:02] standing up and screaming and shouting
[41:03] in church well if you ever got free like
[41:05] they got free then you probably couldn't
[41:07] stop screaming yourself but brother what
[41:09] we need tonight is somebody who will
[41:12] just move out of the way and say you
[41:13] know what it don't matter what I like no
[41:15] more it don't matter what what the devil
[41:17] has tried to tell me I'm going to move
[41:19] myself out of the way my flesh is not
[41:21] going to hinder this service I'm going
[41:22] to sit back and say Lord let me act
[41:24] crazy just like the rest of them
[41:27] we don't need to be sitting in the seat
[41:29] of the scornful
[41:30] a friend of mine said he said if you're
[41:32] sitting in the seat of the scornful it's
[41:33] time to change seats
[41:35] I think that's what we ought to do we
[41:36] sit there and we condemn the people who
[41:38] are getting a little excited well
[41:40] brother I think once you ever realize
[41:42] what victory is to the believer you
[41:44] can't help but get excited
[41:46] I believe there's presence in the
[41:48] presence of God there's Freedom do you
[41:49] believe that's in hype
[41:51] brother Graham talks about being in the
[41:53] pawn shop how many knows the story he
[41:55] said he said if you watch the punch you
[41:57] put your watch in a pawn shop if I can
[41:59] talk that'd be great he said and if you
[42:01] paid on the pawn Bill and and and the
[42:04] man gave you receipt and and said here
[42:06] it's paid off
[42:07] he said you've got a right to go down
[42:10] and not pay for the watch again
[42:13] but you've got a right to go show the
[42:14] receipt and go take your watch
[42:17] now if you've already been baptized
[42:19] you've already received the Holy Ghost
[42:21] and you take that receipt and you come
[42:23] to the house of God devil look you can't
[42:26] steal my joy because the joy is mine you
[42:28] can't steal my family because I've
[42:30] already paid for it that's what we need
[42:33] to do tonight we don't need to be
[42:34] sitting over here saying well I don't
[42:36] have the money to go pay for my watch I
[42:37] don't have the money to get it out of
[42:39] the pawn shop no we've already got it
[42:41] because we paid for it wow it wasn't us
[42:43] but Christ paid for it and he and he
[42:45] went ahead and paid for every one of
[42:46] your watches while he was at it he went
[42:48] ahead and paid for your life he went
[42:50] ahead and paid for your life and he said
[42:51] you know what he said you walk right in
[42:53] and take it the blessings are yours
[42:55] everything you have need of is yours
[42:58] tonight we don't have to wait for it to
[43:00] come we don't have to pay for it again
[43:01] because it's already been paid it's
[43:04] already yours every promise is already
[43:07] yours because the blood's already
[43:09] covered and under the blood you can
[43:12] worship in the way that's called heresy
[43:14] under the blood you can worship God will
[43:16] accept that worship
[43:19] I don't care if it sounds crazy I don't
[43:21] care if it looks crazy if you're under
[43:23] the blood just worship God
[43:25] just worship
[43:27] brother Graham said the devil put us in
[43:29] the pawn shop back there from Adam's sin
[43:31] but Jesus came down and paid the pawn
[43:33] Bill and he wrote it out on the word he
[43:35] said I gotta write for it Satan get back
[43:38] I got a right for it how many can say
[43:41] that tonight I gotta write for my family
[43:43] I've got a right to go down there this
[43:45] may be a miserable age to live in but
[43:47] I've got a right to be happy in it I've
[43:49] got a right to overcome laodicea why
[43:52] because I've got a ticket and I'm going
[43:54] all the way I've got a ticket called the
[43:56] Holy Ghost and you can't stop me you
[43:58] can't shut me up because I know what
[44:00] it's like to set in a dead and cold
[44:02] church but I'm not going to go back
[44:03] there no more I'm going to sit here
[44:05] until the Lord comes and I want to
[44:07] preach to you saying take your Liberty
[44:09] in Christ because he has made you free
[44:14] we need less preachers trying to tell
[44:16] you how to sit down and shut up and more
[44:17] I'm telling you take your Liberty get
[44:20] your children in here and let them
[44:21] experience the atmosphere that you got
[44:23] born in
[44:26] we're freed by Christ the word and now
[44:29] remember brother Branham goes in and he
[44:30] talks about Washed by the Water of the
[44:32] word and he says that that is actually
[44:36] the Greek word means Toulouse
[44:39] when you're Washed by the word he said
[44:41] that Greek in the Greek he said that
[44:43] means to loose he said he loosed us we
[44:46] were tied to the Earth by our sin we
[44:48] couldn't see couldn't hear had no
[44:50] conception of Heaven Or Nothing But when
[44:52] the blood came down it cut the line and
[44:55] we got loosed so you're free tonight
[44:58] you're no more in bondage but you are
[45:01] free
[45:02] through Christ because the blood cut the
[45:04] line
[45:05] I'm thankful for that tonight
[45:06] Revelations 1 and verse 5 and you'll
[45:09] you'll see where it's in the Bible here
[45:10] and this is biblical stuff we're not
[45:12] just making this up we're saying well
[45:13] brother Branham said it and it's thus
[45:14] saith the Lord no we're actually taking
[45:16] a Bible principle and a prophet would
[45:18] come and shed light on it and then then
[45:21] I can preach it to you and you can
[45:23] receive it as so and the word will
[45:25] become so real to you that it will make
[45:27] you live the word
[45:30] Revelations 1 5 Jesus Christ was the
[45:32] faithful witness and the first begotten
[45:34] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[45:36] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[45:38] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[45:42] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[45:44] God we're no longer Sinners we're no
[45:47] longer just just children but we are
[45:49] Kings and Priests unto God
[45:51] I hope you hear me tonight I wish I had
[45:53] a little wish I hadn't ate so much
[45:54] brother Harvey
[45:56] maybe I preach a little bit
[45:58] and brother Branham talks about the
[46:00] washing of the word and when he uses
[46:01] that word to loose I want you to
[46:03] understand something that was for you
[46:05] the washing of the water of the world
[46:07] when it comes upon you when you're
[46:09] Washed by the word many times I wonder
[46:11] if we sit there and and we think well
[46:13] that was a little rough on us this
[46:14] morning or or he was getting after me he
[46:16] stepped on my toes but if you let the
[46:18] word wash you it will actually release
[46:20] you from those things it will make you
[46:22] free in Christ
[46:25] we were Earthbound creatures
[46:27] but now we are to soar like eagles
[46:29] because the blood has covered us there
[46:33] is no more condemnation to us because
[46:35] we're not walking after the Flesh and
[46:37] after the things of the Earth but we are
[46:39] walking after the spirit
[46:42] brother man tells the story about the
[46:43] old crow you still with me this
[46:45] afternoon
[46:46] he tells a story about the old crow and
[46:48] he said these other crows was flying
[46:50] over this field and and they looked down
[46:52] there and they saw Johnny Crow and he
[46:54] was tied up
[46:55] and uh he said come on Johnny Crow let's
[46:58] go south and Winter's coming
[47:00] and oh he got support he couldn't hardly
[47:02] walk he was tied up out there because
[47:03] the farmer had tied him to scare the
[47:06] other crows away well if you come down
[47:07] here you're going to get tied up I guess
[47:09] was his understanding or thinking
[47:11] and so this other guy come along brother
[47:13] Bram calls him the good man
[47:15] and the good man comes along and he cuts
[47:18] that cord to the crow
[47:21] and the crow was free
[47:23] but you know what the problem was he
[47:24] didn't recognize his freedom
[47:27] and so the crow just walked in that
[47:29] Circle and walked in that Circle there
[47:31] was nothing there holding him except for
[47:32] him thinking he was bound
[47:34] he had already been freed by the good
[47:36] man I hope you're hearing me tonight
[47:38] he had already been freed by the good
[47:40] man you've already been freed by the
[47:43] good man but you've got to take your
[47:45] Liberty or you'll forever walk around
[47:47] down there criticizing everybody saying
[47:49] well they're just too emotional they're
[47:51] kind of crazy they don't have no right
[47:53] to shout buddy if you can take your
[47:55] Liberty you'll see that you can soar in
[47:57] the skies with the rest of them you'll
[47:59] quit condemning them you'll quit
[48:01] criticizing it because you're free too
[48:03] but you got to recognize your Liberty
[48:05] you've got to recognize your freedom and
[48:07] I'll tell you how to do it you get in
[48:08] the presence of God were you free one
[48:10] time and you experience how to be free
[48:13] and once you've experienced Freedom you
[48:16] can't go back to the way you were
[48:18] I'm not talking about just emotionalism
[48:20] I'm talking about freedom because the
[48:22] word has come and made you free you're
[48:25] no longer bound by a denomination you're
[48:27] no longer bound by chains of sin you're
[48:29] no longer bound oh come on somebody
[48:30] you're no longer bound to the things of
[48:32] the world but what you are is you are
[48:35] free through the blood that has come and
[48:37] cut the cord and you're no longer stuck
[48:39] there walking in a circle well I'm going
[48:41] to do the same thing you're backslitting
[48:43] and then you're back in the church and
[48:44] you're backslitting and every week is
[48:45] the same old thing you're just going in
[48:47] circles but one day he come and cut the
[48:49] cord for you now is the time to
[48:52] recognize your freedom and take a hold
[48:54] of your wings and go flying into the
[48:56] heavenlies
[48:57] we don't have to walk around in circles
[49:00] in and out of church no more we don't
[49:01] have to go in on Sunday morning and get
[49:04] a pretty good feeling and go out on
[49:05] Monday and feel like we're backsliding
[49:07] no if you're free you'll have freedom
[49:09] all week long
[49:12] because we're not bound
[49:14] by sin that once held us and so when you
[49:17] see the other birds out there flying you
[49:19] can fly with them
[49:21] you just go out there and
[49:22] brother Ram talks about the eagle one
[49:24] time in the Cincinnati Zoo
[49:26] and you know he had he had a love for
[49:28] eagles and animals and so he went in
[49:30] that zoo and he saw that eagle all he
[49:31] said just been captured and he said it
[49:34] was the most pitiful side he'd ever seen
[49:37] and one time he said well it wasn't the
[49:38] most pitiful he said the most pitiful is
[49:40] seeing a son or daughter of God that are
[49:41] chained by sins
[49:43] but he said he went in there and he saw
[49:44] this he saw this Eagle in there and had
[49:46] been captured
[49:47] and he said that bird would try to get
[49:49] out
[49:50] hit his head against the bars and he'd
[49:52] try to flop his wings and he'd hit
[49:54] something over here and he said he was
[49:55] all bloody and running down his face
[49:57] he tried to experience freedom but he
[49:59] couldn't
[50:00] he was still in bondage
[50:04] but he said
[50:06] the only thing he'd do is find himself
[50:07] knocked backward again
[50:09] and he said as he laid there on that
[50:11] floor and his weary eyes soared the
[50:12] skies
[50:13] looked up to the skies that's where I
[50:15] belong why am I still down here he said
[50:17] what a pitiful sight
[50:19] he said made not to be on the earth here
[50:22] he's a Heavenly bird his whole makeup
[50:25] was to live in the blue way above the
[50:27] haunts and cares of the world
[50:29] but he said you see that bird laying
[50:31] there and he said he could never soar
[50:33] those Skies again if he stayed in that
[50:35] bondage
[50:36] he said but by the cunningness of man he
[50:38] had been caged for life I wonder how
[50:40] many of us find ourselves that way the
[50:42] cunningness of man has bound us to
[50:44] something that we don't want to be in
[50:45] but we don't know how to get out
[50:48] he said but brethren
[50:50] to walk out here on the streets of
[50:51] Chicago and these other great cities and
[50:53] find men who were born and shaped in the
[50:55] image of God to be Sons and Daughters of
[50:57] God and to find them caged by sin and
[51:00] habits and cares of this world he said
[51:02] it's a far more pitiful shape than the
[51:03] eagle is
[51:05] and I like this part man was not made to
[51:07] be bound man is a free man
[51:10] he who the son has made free is free
[51:12] indeed
[51:14] he doesn't have to be bound like that oh
[51:16] I hope you hear me tonight you don't
[51:18] have to be bound tonight you are an
[51:20] eagle take your Liberty and fly under
[51:22] the heavenlies
[51:24] you don't have to be bound he said oh it
[51:26] would take me hours to try to express
[51:27] the feeling in my heart and the
[51:29] different things that cage men and deny
[51:31] them of their privileges
[51:32] man's in the image of God and he doesn't
[51:35] have to be a bond slave to Satan
[51:38] he wasn't made to be a slave he was made
[51:42] to be a son all of that he wasn't made
[51:46] to be a slave you were not made to be a
[51:49] slave but you were made to be a Son of
[51:51] God and have the same rights that he had
[51:55] I think we live below our privileges too
[51:57] often
[51:58] we look at the other people getting a
[52:00] blessing and well that's good for them
[52:01] but you know we're we've had some cares
[52:03] of the world that are holding us back we
[52:05] got a cage and we don't see how to get
[52:06] out of it but brother if you just ever
[52:08] surrender your life and your cares to
[52:11] God he'll get you out of that cage and
[52:13] you can fly with the other birds you can
[52:15] look at that eagle and be like hey I can
[52:17] fly higher I'm seeing more Revelation
[52:18] than I've ever seen because if you ever
[52:20] look down from an airplane and you look
[52:22] at the ground you'll see that it's a
[52:24] very different view than walking down
[52:26] the road or driving down the road and
[52:27] you're looking around and you can see
[52:29] the trees and they're taller than you
[52:30] and you can see everything else it's
[52:31] bigger and and but when you get up in a
[52:33] plane you look down well that looks
[52:34] pretty small down there your care start
[52:36] to fade away when you get in the
[52:38] presence of God and you start to Fly
[52:40] Like an Eagle
[52:42] things look different when you get into
[52:44] Heavenly places things look different to
[52:47] a Believer than they did when you were
[52:48] stuck down here in laodicea in the world
[52:51] oh brother I hope you hear me tonight I
[52:53] know this is simple but I think too
[52:54] often we get tied down and we don't know
[52:57] how to worship like we should I'm not
[52:59] here to teach you how to do calisthenics
[53:01] and certain types of Praise but if you
[53:02] ever find your Liberty you can't lay
[53:04] down no longer and take what the devil
[53:06] tells you but you'll find yourself free
[53:08] in the house of God you'll find yourself
[53:11] when you hear the preachers say well I I
[53:13] you know we don't need to have an
[53:14] experience like they did at Acts 2 we
[53:16] just need to walk around shake hands
[53:18] talk to each other and then go home and
[53:20] call it a day brother that's nonsense
[53:22] what we need is the power of the Holy
[53:25] Ghost being preached in the churches
[53:26] again and let our young people have an
[53:29] opportunity at the experience that we've
[53:31] had
[53:33] I'm not taking my kids back to a dead
[53:36] 1970s Church excuse me
[53:38] but I want them to recognize a real
[53:41] genuine outpouring of the Holy Ghost in
[53:44] their lives I'm not satisfied with the
[53:47] way it was I want it to be better for my
[53:49] kids than the way I had it
[53:54] you can go back if you want to but I'm
[53:56] not going back why would you ever want
[53:58] to go back I heard a preacher say this
[54:00] and I'll steal it he said if you're
[54:02] looking in the rearview mirror he said
[54:03] that rear view mirror is very small he
[54:06] said but if you look at the windshield
[54:07] it's very big he said if you'll get your
[54:09] eyes on that win uh rear view mirror
[54:11] brother Bram talks about your wreck he
[54:13] said if you look you've got a bigger
[54:15] view he said there's it's bigger what's
[54:17] in head uh what's ahead of you than it
[54:19] was behind you that stuff in the
[54:20] rearview mirror becomes smaller and the
[54:22] front of you if you look through the
[54:24] windshield it gets bigger and bigger and
[54:26] better and better oh the promises of God
[54:28] are so great and they're so big and
[54:30] there's so many of them but what we've
[54:32] done is we've looked back well I think I
[54:34] want to take my kids back to that I want
[54:36] to take them back to the way we used to
[54:37] have church no sir I want to take them
[54:39] to the promises of God where all the
[54:42] blessings are
[54:44] I don't think we've got time to go back
[54:46] and play Church any longer you say well
[54:48] it was better in my day it was better in
[54:50] the 60s and the 70s well I'll tell you
[54:52] what I think this is the greatest age
[54:54] that you can live in because it takes a
[54:56] lot to overcome it takes a lot of grit
[54:58] to overcome this age but we have an
[55:01] atonement we have a comforter we have
[55:03] somebody who is already on our side he's
[55:06] never lost a battle he's never lost a
[55:08] war and he's not going to start now you
[55:10] say well I'm going to take my kids back
[55:12] there because it was quiet in church
[55:13] brother you all I'll tell you what you
[55:15] lose every one of them
[55:17] I'm setting that dead cold formal
[55:19] chicken pin all you want to
[55:21] I'll tell you what I'm ready to soar the
[55:22] Eagles I'll tell you what you say well
[55:24] it's noisy in here I don't care where
[55:27] Jesus is there is a lot of noise
[55:31] I know you say I'm on one side of the
[55:33] ditch Pastor told us this morning to
[55:36] stay right there in the middle yes sir
[55:39] but I don't think being in the middle of
[55:41] the road means you have to be quiet
[55:42] [Music]
[55:44] I think you can take your Liberty and be
[55:46] right in the middle of the road
[55:48] yes sir I don't I don't think you have
[55:49] to well I hope this is okay I'm not
[55:52] going
[55:53] I don't believe I I get it there's a
[55:56] side over here that if it's a bondage as
[55:59] well
[55:59] you've got to speak in tongues every
[56:01] service you got to scream and run every
[56:03] service or you didn't get nothing
[56:06] then you gotta side over here that if
[56:08] you move or raise your hand too often or
[56:11] Get Up and Scream Hallelujah when the
[56:12] preacher is making a good point
[56:15] they'll tell you shut up
[56:17] that's another ditch but why can't we
[56:20] just have freedom to worship
[56:22] that's the balance we need is freedom to
[56:24] worship the way God has called us to
[56:27] worship
[56:28] I ain't gonna make you get up and say
[56:30] anything and we ain't gonna make you sit
[56:31] down and shut up what we want you to do
[56:33] is come to the house of God and be free
[56:35] to move according to the spirit has
[56:37] moved you
[56:38] I know there's some of the elders that
[56:40] oh they'd love to get up and worship but
[56:42] while you're young and able why don't
[56:44] you take the Liberty once in a while to
[56:46] worship God
[56:47] I tell you what I think we're
[56:49] we get ourselves
[56:51] so carnal
[56:53] we start looking can I just talk to you
[56:54] for a minute can I preach at you for a
[56:56] minute
[56:56] we get carnal I get carnal sometimes and
[56:59] I get to thinking well if I get up you
[57:01] know somebody might have a bad thought
[57:03] about me
[57:04] I can't worship maybe they'd get mad you
[57:06] know we need to leave those things at
[57:08] the door
[57:10] forget about our everyday life
[57:13] just tell the Lord about it and just
[57:14] forget about it and come right in here
[57:16] and have a conscience between you and
[57:18] God and if the word is preached you can
[57:20] respond to it in the freedom and the
[57:22] Liberty wherewith you've been called
[57:24] because you have not been called to come
[57:26] into a denomination and worship the way
[57:28] we've taught you but you've been called
[57:29] To Worship the way you feel like
[57:32] worshiping when the spirit of the Lord
[57:33] moves upon you
[57:34] I tell you what when the spirit comes
[57:36] upon you you're going to move in the way
[57:38] God moves you it may not be like God
[57:40] moves me it may not be like God moves
[57:43] this sister or this brother this sister
[57:44] but what it's going to be is however you
[57:46] worship you can't help but worship it is
[57:49] presence because he wouldn't even be God
[57:51] if you didn't worship Him
[57:54] think about it
[57:56] he wouldn't be God
[57:57] brother Brahm said God is an object of
[58:00] worship
[58:02] if you didn't worship him he wouldn't be
[58:04] God
[58:06] so what you have to do in order for him
[58:08] to be God is worship him as God and if
[58:12] you recognize who he is and how great he
[58:15] is you can't help but worship God
[58:16] because I was once bound I was once down
[58:20] there on the ground and I heard a scream
[58:22] from an eagle become over and said come
[58:24] fly with me oh I've seen things that
[58:26] I've never seen before I've heard things
[58:28] that I've never heard before you know
[58:30] what I heard tapes all my life I heard
[58:33] him and I heard him and I heard him and
[58:34] I was a hearer and a here and here but
[58:36] one day I decided I'm going to go ahead
[58:37] and put the faith that I've heard on the
[58:39] tapes into action
[58:41] and you know what will happen you'll
[58:43] start seeing changes in your children
[58:44] you'll start seeing changes in your
[58:46] church oh come on somebody
[58:49] I come up here and I'll pick on you is
[58:51] that okay can I pick on you no oh I'm
[58:55] going to anyway because you're my kid
[58:57] we moved up here and it was just a few
[58:59] months after we got here it's okay
[59:02] Lord put it on his heart to be baptized
[59:04] why because he felt the presence of the
[59:06] Lord or the service one time you tell me
[59:08] the presence of God don't matter anymore
[59:13] you can get up here and preach the
[59:14] message all you want to but if the fire
[59:15] baptisms in the Holy Ghost ain't moving
[59:17] across the people you're doing something
[59:18] wrong
[59:20] if you're standing if you're standing
[59:22] here telling them
[59:23] this is what brother Branham said this
[59:25] is what brother Graham said this is what
[59:26] brother Branham said go home
[59:27] you never gave an opportunity for the
[59:29] spirit of the Lord to work on the people
[59:31] I'm not trying to condemn anybody what
[59:33] I'm trying to tell you is you don't have
[59:34] to sit down there no longer you've got
[59:36] to move into the heavenlies where all
[59:38] things are new where there's actually
[59:40] freedom to worship
[59:42] I don't want the bondage church let the
[59:45] churches that have bondage had bondage
[59:46] but I think right here at Word of Life
[59:48] Tabernacle we need to let it be Word of
[59:50] Life
[59:52] we need to let the Living Word move
[59:54] Among Us
[59:55] we need to let the word of God stir us
[59:57] up and make us something different we're
[59:59] not good enough just going in circles
[1:00:01] I'm not going back to what I was
[1:00:03] yesterday why because the word changed
[1:00:05] me today and I'm not going back
[1:00:07] the word will move you the water of the
[1:00:10] washing of the word will make you free
[1:00:12] because it is freedom it is to loose you
[1:00:15] and to set you free oh it's not legalism
[1:00:17] legalism's over here and you're living
[1:00:19] and you say well I gotta wear a dress
[1:00:21] and I got to grow my hair out and but
[1:00:23] you don't have the Holy Ghost making you
[1:00:24] do it that's legalism but if the holy
[1:00:26] spirit is in you you can't help but live
[1:00:28] for God you live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:00:31] why because you're free to do exactly
[1:00:33] what God has wanted you to do see God
[1:00:36] moves upon a life and it makes you
[1:00:38] change it's not a force it's something
[1:00:40] in you that makes you change it makes
[1:00:42] you act different it makes your nature
[1:00:44] change oh come on somebody I know you're
[1:00:46] going to fight the flesh I know you're
[1:00:48] going to fight Satan's Eden I understand
[1:00:49] the age that we're living in is laodicea
[1:00:52] I understand those things but you are an
[1:00:54] overcomer and you are to come up higher
[1:00:56] than the world you are not to live like
[1:00:58] the world you go out here and you see
[1:01:00] them and they're dressed up and are
[1:01:02] dressed down or whatever you want to
[1:01:03] call it and they got their their blue
[1:01:05] hair and and they've got their short
[1:01:06] shorts on and you walk out they ain't
[1:01:08] got no clothes on and then they call
[1:01:10] somebody this dress decent with a nice
[1:01:12] skirt or nice dress on they call you
[1:01:14] crazy and if you look at them they are
[1:01:16] the very definition of crazy they're
[1:01:18] half naked walking on the street
[1:01:21] but see we don't serve under bondage
[1:01:25] we are the most free people on the face
[1:01:28] of the Earth
[1:01:29] I would say you as message Believers are
[1:01:33] the only free people on the face of the
[1:01:36] Earth because you're serving something
[1:01:39] we are serving a living God
[1:01:43] you're either serving a denomination
[1:01:45] or a Creed
[1:01:49] you're serving I don't care if you're
[1:01:51] Pentecostal and you shout every service
[1:01:53] if you're having to do that just to do
[1:01:55] it that's bondage
[1:01:57] I'm not saying you have to scream and
[1:01:59] holler I'm not saying you have to do
[1:02:00] anything but experience the presence of
[1:02:02] God one time
[1:02:04] and I I challenge you to sit still
[1:02:08] you say whatever service I don't feel
[1:02:09] like it well buddy we don't go by
[1:02:11] feelings and emotions around here we go
[1:02:13] by the word of the word of God and if
[1:02:15] the word can't move you you better get
[1:02:18] back in the word again get down to the
[1:02:20] altar again get you a refilling of the
[1:02:22] Holy Ghost and it don't matter who's
[1:02:23] preaching the word the word will move
[1:02:25] you in such a way that you can't sit
[1:02:27] there no longer because you say well I
[1:02:29] don't like that preacher I like this
[1:02:31] preacher he's my favorite and I'm going
[1:02:32] I'll stand up all service for him and
[1:02:34] that's good you know sometimes when you
[1:02:36] get a bunch of people together and you
[1:02:38] see how the spirit of the Lord just
[1:02:39] really moves and that's wonderful but
[1:02:41] brother don't let the word have none
[1:02:43] effect on you because it's coming from a
[1:02:45] different source
[1:02:47] if your pastor says it and not your
[1:02:50] favorite evangelist it's still the word
[1:02:52] of God
[1:02:54] can you say Amen
[1:02:56] if if a preacher that you may not like
[1:02:58] says it I'm talking about me I'm talking
[1:03:01] about you know some of these preachers
[1:03:02] that Ben has in no I'm just
[1:03:06] about Stewart he ain't here
[1:03:09] but
[1:03:10] the Ben said God could use a donkey one
[1:03:12] of the first times I ever preached
[1:03:13] that's what he said you know you didn't
[1:03:14] know that brother Jeff that's what he
[1:03:15] said you wasn't here for that
[1:03:17] yeah
[1:03:18] but God can use anybody what I'm saying
[1:03:20] is if if the word is coming from any
[1:03:23] Source if you're sitting there listening
[1:03:24] to a tape is it background noise
[1:03:27] or do those words really coming
[1:03:29] and set you free
[1:03:32] because you're free by the word
[1:03:35] Christ is the word he came down and he
[1:03:38] cut the cords remember when he went down
[1:03:41] I'm so far off my notes I don't know
[1:03:43] where I'm at but let me tell you this
[1:03:45] after he died brother Daryl made such a
[1:03:48] beautiful illustration
[1:03:49] and told the story like nobody else
[1:03:53] but after he died
[1:03:55] he goes down into hell
[1:03:58] and he said you could hear the chains
[1:04:00] breaking loose and you could hear
[1:04:03] the the the the the cuffs and things
[1:04:06] coming off the wrists and the
[1:04:07] he did that all
[1:04:09] down there in hell where he spent three
[1:04:11] days
[1:04:12] just setting the captive free releasing
[1:04:15] the bondage but you know he comes right
[1:04:18] into a service like this
[1:04:20] and he goes down and somebody's dealing
[1:04:22] with something and you say I'm bound to
[1:04:24] this Habit in the world I'm bound to
[1:04:26] this thing that's holding me
[1:04:28] you're bound to something but there's a
[1:04:30] man in here walking the aisles and he's
[1:04:32] here to set you free he's here to move
[1:04:35] you and take you out of that condition
[1:04:37] and you don't have to go back tomorrow
[1:04:39] that's the good part
[1:04:42] because who the son has set free is free
[1:04:45] indeed you don't go back tomorrow to the
[1:04:48] chains you're not free on a 72-hour pass
[1:04:50] or a 24-hour pass but you're free from
[1:04:53] here all the way to Glory or you'll
[1:04:55] never be bound again
[1:04:58] what we let behind us
[1:05:01] is our own minds
[1:05:03] and I I heard a brother speak this and
[1:05:05] it really struck my heart he said
[1:05:06] there's a war going on in here
[1:05:09] because God is telling you you've
[1:05:10] already been free and Satan is telling
[1:05:13] you constantly that you're bound
[1:05:15] it's what it is you're constantly bound
[1:05:18] to something
[1:05:20] and Satan will use something that's not
[1:05:22] even binding you but he'll try to make
[1:05:24] it mind you
[1:05:25] he'll give you a love for sports more
[1:05:29] than the love for God
[1:05:31] you may have been a holy ghost filled
[1:05:32] Christian and all of a sudden you
[1:05:33] realize hey I'd rather go watch a
[1:05:35] football game than go to church
[1:05:36] well what you've done is you've allowed
[1:05:39] him to tie you to something that is now
[1:05:42] bondage I'm not saying you're not a
[1:05:44] Christian what I'm saying is you're
[1:05:45] allowing Satan to do that because really
[1:05:48] if you could look the cord's already
[1:05:49] been broken you don't have to go back to
[1:05:52] that we're purposely going back to it
[1:05:54] but we've been freed all the time but
[1:05:56] we've never left the ground we've sat
[1:05:57] down there oh come on somebody y'all
[1:05:59] sitting in the back I'll come to you
[1:06:02] look
[1:06:04] this Crow was walking around he never
[1:06:06] knew he was free because he never soared
[1:06:09] into the sky to experience the presence
[1:06:12] of God
[1:06:13] and some of you have been free for 30 40
[1:06:15] years but you've never experienced the
[1:06:17] presence of God because you've never
[1:06:19] taken your Liberty and danced a little
[1:06:22] bit you've never taken your Liberty and
[1:06:24] shouted a little bit because that's the
[1:06:26] way you'll know that you're free when
[1:06:28] God moves upon you and there's nothing
[1:06:29] holding you back anymore
[1:06:31] I say give it a try sometime you might
[1:06:34] be surprised how good it feels
[1:06:37] but see you're walking around
[1:06:39] you're not even tired
[1:06:41] he's already set you free
[1:06:44] I'm looking at the clock because I
[1:06:45] forgot to start my timer
[1:06:48] he's already set you free
[1:06:50] but you don't recognize your freedom
[1:06:54] so tonight I wonder
[1:06:56] get on way on down here
[1:06:58] brother where I'm talking about the
[1:06:59] slaves
[1:07:00] he was in Illinois there and he walked
[1:07:02] by a museum you've heard the story you
[1:07:03] know what I'm talking about
[1:07:06] he's walking down there and he sees
[1:07:07] these these men that were slaves looking
[1:07:11] in this window
[1:07:12] and he said I believe he says it
[1:07:14] something like this
[1:07:16] tears are running down their face and
[1:07:17] they're just standing there looking in
[1:07:18] this window and he walks over to him
[1:07:20] and he said he said excuse me gentlemen
[1:07:23] what's making you cry I'd ask you this
[1:07:25] what's making you act fanatical
[1:07:27] what's making what's making you act so
[1:07:29] crazy in church
[1:07:32] brother I'm going to ask him and he says
[1:07:34] at least I'm looking at that suit there
[1:07:36] that dresser I think he called it
[1:07:39] he said that's Abraham Lincoln's he said
[1:07:41] you see that blood on there
[1:07:43] he said I've still got the marks from
[1:07:45] the slave belt around me where I was in
[1:07:47] bondage but he said that blood on that
[1:07:49] man right there set me free
[1:07:51] you know if you ever recognize that
[1:07:54] you're going to act a little crazy
[1:07:55] sometimes
[1:07:57] because it don't matter
[1:07:59] how many times you fail down here and
[1:08:01] walk in that Circle
[1:08:02] if you ever experience the heavenlies
[1:08:04] one time
[1:08:05] you'll never forget it
[1:08:07] you never come back to where you were
[1:08:10] because God has so loved you
[1:08:13] that he gave an ultimate sacrifice for
[1:08:16] you so that you don't have to live in
[1:08:18] bondage any longer
[1:08:20] we should always try to experience the
[1:08:23] presence of God because he's always here
[1:08:25] to meet you
[1:08:28] brother Graham said
[1:08:30] if that would excite a slave man by
[1:08:33] taking a slave belt
[1:08:36] by Abraham Lincoln taking the slave bet
[1:08:37] what ought the blood of Christ do to a
[1:08:39] believer
[1:08:41] and they tell us not to be emotional
[1:08:42] about it
[1:08:43] they tell us not to cry
[1:08:45] they tell you not to scream out
[1:08:49] God has done so much for me I can't help
[1:08:51] but get happy about it I can't help but
[1:08:54] experience the Liberty that he gave me
[1:08:57] because it's not something I'm working
[1:08:59] up it's not something that I have to
[1:09:01] have to force my way into but I
[1:09:03] recognize what he did and so now I just
[1:09:05] take what he did for me and I take that
[1:09:07] love and I take all the I take that
[1:09:10] forgiveness that he gave me and now I
[1:09:12] can have forgiveness for somebody else I
[1:09:13] could have love for somebody else I
[1:09:15] could have Liberty to love one another
[1:09:17] we could have Liberty to love each other
[1:09:18] why because he loved us it's liberty
[1:09:22] we're freed we're no longer in bondage
[1:09:27] well
[1:09:28] you see I don't feel that way brother
[1:09:30] let's get on our knees one time
[1:09:33] and look to Calvary
[1:09:35] and if you could ever
[1:09:37] ever
[1:09:38] recognize what he did for you you'll be
[1:09:41] the most free man and woman in the world
[1:09:43] because you'll recognize he did it so
[1:09:45] you don't have to
[1:09:49] brother man talks about a hero he talks
[1:09:51] about
[1:09:52] man in Switzerland there he said
[1:09:56] was it Arnold Von Winkler I believe it
[1:09:58] was
[1:10:00] he said
[1:10:01] he said he got over there he said
[1:10:04] he said
[1:10:06] years ago in Switzerland there were some
[1:10:07] Germans that went up into the mountains
[1:10:08] and they didn't want war these were
[1:10:10] peaceful people
[1:10:11] they go up there and
[1:10:13] he said
[1:10:15] he said they go and he said they
[1:10:17] realized it was an oncoming Army
[1:10:20] and he said these men were trained and
[1:10:22] built like bricks
[1:10:24] every man fully covered by armor
[1:10:27] and he said here's a little Swiss to not
[1:10:29] knowing what to do and finally there was
[1:10:31] a young fellow stepped up by the name
[1:10:32] name of Arnold Von Winkler at our
[1:10:34] however you pronounced Satin he said man
[1:10:37] of Switzerland
[1:10:38] this day I'm going to give my life for
[1:10:40] my nation
[1:10:41] he said this morning over across the
[1:10:43] mountain I kissed my wife goodbye and my
[1:10:45] three little children for the last time
[1:10:46] I'll never see them again and he said I
[1:10:48] want you all to look after them but this
[1:10:50] day I must give my life for Switzerland
[1:10:53] they said Arnold
[1:10:55] what will you do he said you just follow
[1:10:56] me and fight with all you've got
[1:11:01] follow the one who gave it all and fight
[1:11:04] with all you've got
[1:11:06] he looked around until he found a very
[1:11:08] deepest spot of the Spears and he raised
[1:11:10] his arms toward heaven and he screamed
[1:11:12] to the top of his voice
[1:11:13] he said Make Way for Liberty
[1:11:17] and he started running and he said he
[1:11:19] screamed again Make Way for Liberty
[1:11:21] and as he rushed towards the army with
[1:11:23] his hands up and his open booze into the
[1:11:24] spears he said more than a hundred
[1:11:26] Spears reached for him and he grabbed
[1:11:28] them with his arms and throwed them into
[1:11:29] his bosom and there he died with those
[1:11:30] Spears in his bosom but he said the
[1:11:32] heroism routed the aliens and they went
[1:11:35] to pieces and the Swiss run in with
[1:11:37] their clubs and sticks and beat the Army
[1:11:39] out of the nation
[1:11:40] it took one man
[1:11:42] to go free for a whole nation to go free
[1:11:44] it took one man
[1:11:47] for the worst sinner in the city
[1:11:49] to go free
[1:11:51] there was a maniac in the Bible
[1:11:54] but there was a man come by his way and
[1:11:56] set him free
[1:11:57] there was the worst sinner in Hardy
[1:11:58] Arkansas but there's a man that came on
[1:12:00] the scene the presence of a man had come
[1:12:03] along and he set you free you don't have
[1:12:06] to die a sinner's death no longer
[1:12:09] because you have been made free
[1:12:13] brother Graham said there never was a
[1:12:15] hero like the Lord Jesus you believe
[1:12:16] that's a night
[1:12:17] one day when Adam's race stood in the
[1:12:19] corner backed up by the powers of the
[1:12:22] devil and all great units of
[1:12:24] spiritualism and all kinds of isms had
[1:12:26] Adams Race in the corner sickness
[1:12:28] diseases every enemy of the human race
[1:12:30] had Adam's race backed into the corner
[1:12:32] but he said there was one who spoke in
[1:12:34] heaven and said I'm going down to earth
[1:12:36] to get my life for Adam's race and he
[1:12:39] came to the Earth and he found where the
[1:12:41] deepest of the spears was death he said
[1:12:43] there he rushed and grabbed the Spear of
[1:12:45] death into his Precious Heart I hope
[1:12:46] you're hearing me he said his Precious
[1:12:48] Heart of Calvary he conquered death and
[1:12:50] when he went back up into Glory he sent
[1:12:52] down the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
[1:12:55] his subjects that's you and me and he
[1:12:57] said he sent down into his subjects and
[1:12:59] he said and he said take this and fight
[1:13:01] with all your strength he said oh
[1:13:04] Brethren what man tries to pick up
[1:13:06] something else let's take what Christ
[1:13:08] sent us and fight with everything that's
[1:13:10] in us we don't have to be trained men we
[1:13:12] don't have to be trained people we have
[1:13:14] to be willing people
[1:13:16] that's what we need don't take what
[1:13:18] they're trying to educate into you don't
[1:13:20] take some mental conception of the
[1:13:22] message but take what you got and go
[1:13:24] fight with every inch of ground you can
[1:13:29] God just wants some willing people I
[1:13:31] believe there's some willing worshipers
[1:13:32] in the building tonight I believe
[1:13:34] there's somebody who wants to find their
[1:13:36] freedom in the message of the hour we're
[1:13:38] not bound by the message we are free by
[1:13:41] the message we are not bound but we are
[1:13:44] loosed by the water of the washing of
[1:13:46] the word
[1:13:48] that's what we want
[1:13:51] brother bam talked about he said there
[1:13:52] was a blessing they were they was
[1:13:53] blessing God for the Holy Ghost which
[1:13:55] had never come yet
[1:13:56] but they believed that it was because
[1:13:58] they believed that it was because God
[1:13:59] was going to keep his promise and when
[1:14:01] they kept blessing God
[1:14:04] when they kept you said it hadn't come
[1:14:06] on me yet praise God anyway it's coming
[1:14:09] have you been baptized are you coming to
[1:14:12] the house of the Lord you're doing what
[1:14:14] you know to do keep praising God you say
[1:14:16] well if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:17] you can't Praise Him
[1:14:19] it's not what a prophet said he said
[1:14:21] they kept blessing God until that
[1:14:22] atmosphere just got right
[1:14:25] and then there came a sound from heaven
[1:14:27] like a rushing Mighty Wind and filled
[1:14:29] all the house where they were setting
[1:14:31] all the atmosphere got right
[1:14:33] we don't need to shout in church the
[1:14:35] atmosphere for these children to be born
[1:14:38] again and serve God has got to be just
[1:14:41] right
[1:14:45] he said they kept blessing God
[1:14:48] and the atmosphere got just right he
[1:14:51] said oh couldn't we get an atmosphere
[1:14:53] here
[1:14:54] oh I hope you hear me now
[1:14:56] he gets personal here if you listen to
[1:14:58] it he said couldn't we get an atmosphere
[1:15:00] here that every crippled every blind
[1:15:02] every sick person everything
[1:15:05] that takes everything with all one
[1:15:07] Accord
[1:15:08] leave our fussing outside leave your
[1:15:11] back biting somewhere else come into the
[1:15:13] house of God in one Accord believing
[1:15:16] that somebody is going to be healed
[1:15:17] somebody may leave here and it'd be
[1:15:19] their last service but you need to come
[1:15:22] to the house of God and you are a
[1:15:24] creator of an atmosphere so if you don't
[1:15:26] need nothing from God at least you can
[1:15:28] do is come and create an atmosphere for
[1:15:30] somebody else
[1:15:32] do you care about the young people do
[1:15:34] you care about the other elderly people
[1:15:35] do you care about your spouse do you
[1:15:38] care about any oh come on somebody I
[1:15:40] think it's time we cared for somebody
[1:15:41] sitting next to us more than ourselves
[1:15:43] well I don't get a blessing out of
[1:15:45] services no more but if you bring an
[1:15:46] atmosphere then God can bless somebody
[1:15:49] else
[1:15:51] oh I feel good right now I think we'll
[1:15:53] preach for a minute I think it's time we
[1:15:55] quit taking our little isms and ideas
[1:15:57] and putting Christ on the outside
[1:16:00] I think it's time we come back and have
[1:16:02] an experience again you say well I got
[1:16:04] the Holy Ghost 30 years ago and I'm a
[1:16:07] pretty good Christian and a spirit
[1:16:08] American Sonia
[1:16:10] there's one baptism
[1:16:13] but there's many refillings
[1:16:17] and I think we forget that sometimes
[1:16:20] you young people say well I got the Holy
[1:16:21] Ghost already
[1:16:22] don't stop there
[1:16:25] take your freedom and your Liberty to
[1:16:26] get refilled and what we want to do you
[1:16:29] say well I've got the Holy Ghost okay
[1:16:31] then let's come here to the house of God
[1:16:32] and let's create an atmosphere where our
[1:16:35] children want to be in it
[1:16:37] you say well we got to get the music
[1:16:39] right for the young people yeah no what
[1:16:40] you need is the presence of God for the
[1:16:42] young people
[1:16:43] you don't have to have the biggest crowd
[1:16:45] for the young people you don't have to
[1:16:46] have more young people for the young
[1:16:48] people what you have to have for the
[1:16:50] young people is the spirit and the
[1:16:52] liberty of Christ where they can be set
[1:16:54] free I'll tell you what there's a lot of
[1:16:55] addictions for our youth today and it's
[1:16:57] time that we stop playing around with
[1:16:59] church and we say we come here oh well
[1:17:02] can I preach for a minute God has not
[1:17:04] given us a spirit to sit around and
[1:17:07] backed by one another and say well this
[1:17:09] these kids don't matter their party is
[1:17:11] going to grow up and they're going to
[1:17:12] have to learn on their own and you know
[1:17:13] what they did to sin and they can do the
[1:17:14] praying I get tired of that here hearing
[1:17:16] that kind of stuff you know why because
[1:17:18] somebody prayed for me
[1:17:21] Somebody Prayed For You somebody thought
[1:17:24] enough of you to keep the doors open to
[1:17:26] a church and to pray you through one
[1:17:28] time at the altar
[1:17:31] and if you haven't experienced you need
[1:17:33] to
[1:17:35] go to young people
[1:17:36] my heart goes out to him because I know
[1:17:39] what it's like to live a backslidden
[1:17:42] life I know what it's like to grow up in
[1:17:44] the message and you want something and
[1:17:46] you're sitting there and it's so dead
[1:17:47] and it's so cold that you can't go to
[1:17:49] the altar oh come on somebody
[1:17:52] I know my time's up give me five more
[1:17:54] minutes he'll give me five more minutes
[1:17:56] 5 10 15 there we go
[1:18:01] we have gotten into condition
[1:18:03] that we think well it's word only now
[1:18:05] we're just going to preach the word
[1:18:07] preach the word well
[1:18:08] what the problem is is you're not
[1:18:10] preaching the word in the power and the
[1:18:13] demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:14] because if you do it will move people to
[1:18:17] the altar we don't have to beg them but
[1:18:19] if you'll ever move if you'll ever
[1:18:21] preach the real fire baptism of the Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost and you'll ever preach the word in
[1:18:26] a passionate way
[1:18:30] I don't think we have to have teachers
[1:18:32] all over the house I think we need
[1:18:33] preachers to preach it and conviction
[1:18:35] upon the hearts of the sinners
[1:18:37] but I sit in church and it was cold and
[1:18:39] formal but let me tell you something
[1:18:40] young people will have addictions if you
[1:18:42] don't watch out
[1:18:44] and if there's no atmosphere in the
[1:18:46] church I hope you hear me now then
[1:18:49] they're going to find an atmosphere
[1:18:50] somewhere that will move them they're
[1:18:53] going to run towards something they're
[1:18:55] going to go out oh I hope you hear me
[1:18:57] now they're they're going to run towards
[1:18:59] something they're going to go after
[1:19:00] things in the world because they're
[1:19:01] going to satisfy something but if you'll
[1:19:03] ever get them in the presence of God
[1:19:05] they will never be the same or they may
[1:19:08] run out but they know what to come back
[1:19:10] to because the world can't satisfy you
[1:19:12] like Jesus can
[1:19:16] the world can't satisfy you
[1:19:19] the world can give you a time of
[1:19:21] pleasure
[1:19:22] and then you'll realize oh I'm tied to
[1:19:24] this I can't get away from it
[1:19:26] and it's bondage but in the message of
[1:19:29] the hour there's freedom
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] the church we don't need to bring
[1:19:33] bondage back to church we need to bring
[1:19:35] freedom back to the house of God
[1:19:39] said oh brother musicians go ahead and
[1:19:41] come my time is way up
[1:19:44] he said oh brother
[1:19:46] God send us an atmosphere
[1:19:49] that'll make it of one Accord
[1:19:53] in one place
[1:19:55] and let the power of God surge down
[1:19:58] through
[1:20:00] oh come on somebody
[1:20:03] let the power of God surge through the
[1:20:05] building
[1:20:07] we're gonna try to stop it around here
[1:20:09] if if the word is moving the people let
[1:20:12] the people move
[1:20:14] if the music's moving them they might
[1:20:15] get out of control but if the word is
[1:20:18] moving the people
[1:20:19] I dare you stop it
[1:20:21] because God if he's moving them let them
[1:20:24] get in an atmosphere where they can be
[1:20:26] changed
[1:20:27] we're not trying to just get a big
[1:20:28] church and and fill it up with a bunch
[1:20:30] of members we want people who have come
[1:20:32] in contact with the word of God and the
[1:20:34] presence of God has moved on their life
[1:20:36] in such a way that they can no longer
[1:20:38] stay down there in the Earthly things
[1:20:41] and they can no longer be tied to the
[1:20:43] things of the world but they can soar
[1:20:45] into the heavenlies and move up higher
[1:20:47] into the things of God why because we're
[1:20:49] not bound any longer but we're free
[1:20:52] I say we're free this evening I said
[1:20:55] we're free we don't have to worry oh
[1:20:57] come on somebody
[1:20:59] you don't have to worry about your
[1:21:00] pastor coming in here getting mad for
[1:21:01] you shouting a little bit because he
[1:21:03] believes in the freedom of the Holy
[1:21:05] Ghost if you get to dance in a little
[1:21:07] bit maybe we'll dance with you I'll tell
[1:21:09] you it's time for freedom to come back
[1:21:11] to the house of God I said we need to
[1:21:13] create an atmosphere of freedom in the
[1:21:16] house of God again
[1:21:19] he said that atmosphere gets right it
[1:21:22] opens up
[1:21:24] every clog
[1:21:26] think about it
[1:21:28] the atmosphere
[1:21:30] gets just right
[1:21:33] and it opens up every clog
[1:21:35] you know the spirits that try to come in
[1:21:37] and stop you from praising
[1:21:39] stop you from worshiping
[1:21:41] stop it from moving when the word's
[1:21:42] moving you
[1:21:44] it opens up every clog
[1:21:49] the law of God will move
[1:21:51] it moves back every clog
[1:21:55] I wonder if we could stand to our feet
[1:22:01] that last quote that I read you
[1:22:03] the brand preaches that in expectation
[1:22:05] 1954.
[1:22:06] what really struck me was oh brother
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:10] God send us an atmosphere
[1:22:13] that'll make us a one Accord and I
[1:22:14] thought I want that to be my prayer
[1:22:17] if there's something in me that's
[1:22:18] stopping you from getting a blessing
[1:22:19] Lord take it out of me
[1:22:22] if there's something in me
[1:22:25] that is hindering my brother and sister
[1:22:26] from getting a blessing
[1:22:29] move it out of me so they can be blessed
[1:22:32] I want a blessing but I want them to be
[1:22:34] blessed more than me
[1:22:36] I want to see them on fire more than me
[1:22:38] so move it out of me
[1:22:41] I want this to be a church I believe
[1:22:43] her pastor will tell you we want this to
[1:22:45] be a church
[1:22:46] where the word is preached
[1:22:48] and the people have a freedom to respond
[1:22:50] to it
[1:22:51] and we want there to be a freedom in
[1:22:53] your life so you can be changed oh do
[1:22:55] you believe it are you free this evening
[1:22:58] oh how many is free can you put your
[1:23:00] hand up and say I'm free I'm not bound
