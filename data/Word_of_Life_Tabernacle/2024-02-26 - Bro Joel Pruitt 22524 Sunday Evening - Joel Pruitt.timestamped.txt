[35:54] that that you would have me say tonight
[35:55] to these people to bring life life to
[35:57] them Lord I pray each one of the people
[36:00] sitting here today would receive what
[36:02] they have need of and Lord as your word
[36:04] Goes Forth I pray you would anoint your
[36:06] word anoint the hearers and be with us
[36:08] through the remainder of this service we
[36:09] ask in Jesus name amen amen how many's
[36:14] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[36:15] tonight amen if you could turn to
[36:18] Matthew chapter
[36:19] 12 and verse 38 Matthew 12 and
[36:25] 38
[36:31] man then certain of the scribes and the
[36:32] Pharisees answered saying Master we
[36:35] would see a sign from thee and he
[36:37] answered and said unto them an evil and
[36:40] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[36:42] sign and there shall no sign be given to
[36:45] it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for
[36:48] as Jonas was three days and three nights
[36:50] in the whale's belly so shall the son of
[36:52] man be three days and three nights in
[36:54] the heart of the Earth the men of
[36:56] Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
[36:58] generation and shall condemn it because
[37:00] they repented at the preaching of Jonas
[37:02] and behold a greater than Jonas is here
[37:05] the queen of the South shall rise up in
[37:07] judgment with this generation and shall
[37:09] condemn it for she came from the
[37:11] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[37:13] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[37:16] than Solomon is here you believe that
[37:18] tonight amen you can be
[37:21] seated Jesus is talking to these here
[37:24] the scribes the Pharisees and he he's
[37:26] talking to a group of people who were
[37:28] actually in his presence and didn't
[37:30] recognize that he was there they knew it
[37:33] was a man named Jesus but they didn't
[37:34] know who Jesus was I wonder if many
[37:37] times we're in the presence of God but
[37:38] we don't know that we're in the presence
[37:39] of God well come on somebody we know
[37:42] he's here but we don't recognize it as
[37:45] being his presence sometimes because the
[37:47] service doesn't go how he want it to the
[37:49] presence of God didn't show up no we've
[37:51] got to recognize it as the presence of
[37:53] God and so brother bandam said here and
[37:56] and it's important to be in the presence
[37:57] of God how many knows that brother brand
[37:59] says so many get the same opportunity
[38:01] today to stand in his presence as they
[38:04] did then and still because of popular
[38:07] opinion they turn it down standing in
[38:10] the presence of God so it is possible
[38:12] that you could stand in the presence of
[38:14] God and not recognize his presence it's
[38:16] possible you could stand in the presence
[38:18] of God and turn down the presence of God
[38:20] it is possible that you could actually
[38:22] be standing in the same room as Jesus
[38:25] and not know Jesus was there what can
[38:27] you say Amen it is very possible that
[38:29] you could even invite him into a service
[38:31] and not know that he showed up why is it
[38:34] it's because we don't always recognize
[38:36] how he comes he doesn't come by the way
[38:38] you may want him to come he may not come
[38:40] by the way we think he should come but
[38:42] he promised to always show up so we know
[38:45] his presence is always here now you
[38:48] could grieve his presence from you you
[38:49] could you could say things you could do
[38:51] things that would grieve his presence
[38:52] but brother brandom said he doesn't go
[38:54] far away but maybe he'll just fly off
[38:56] like a little Dove would fly away but
[38:58] you've got to recognize that if you'll
[39:00] just invite him back his presence can be
[39:03] right there again so we understand that
[39:05] recognize there there's got to be
[39:07] something in you to recognize the
[39:08] presence of God and the word recognize
[39:11] in the English is it is to identify from
[39:14] having encountered it them before and to
[39:17] know again so it's something you have
[39:19] been in in contact with and so you know
[39:22] what it feels like and when it comes
[39:25] back around again it it just feels right
[39:28] it feels like the presence of God but at
[39:30] one time in your life or another you
[39:32] have had to come in contact with the
[39:34] presence of God or you'll never know how
[39:37] it feels when he comes I remember a
[39:39] story from Brother Billy Paul he said
[39:42] that when he when he was in the room
[39:43] there in Illinois with brother Brandon
[39:45] and the angel of the Lord came in the
[39:46] room how many's heard the story you know
[39:48] what he you know what he said there and
[39:50] he and and the angel of the Lord come in
[39:51] the room and he said he never he he
[39:53] never forgot the presence of that being
[39:55] that was in the room room and that's the
[39:57] way it is today we may not see a literal
[40:00] being in the room we may not see an
[40:01] actual light in the room but the
[40:03] presence of God can still be here and I
[40:06] believe the presence of God is many
[40:07] times in our services but it goes
[40:09] unrecognized because it didn't come how
[40:12] we wanted it but I think we need to let
[40:14] go and let God have his way let go and
[40:16] let God show up any way he wants to let
[40:19] God come on the scene however he wishes
[40:21] to come on the scene let the presence of
[40:24] God have the preeminence in our services
[40:26] again let the presence of God change
[40:28] lives it may not come how you want him
[40:30] to but if he comes entertain him while
[40:32] he's
[40:33] here yeah he said now when he is not
[40:37] recognized then his power is not always
[40:40] revealed when he is not recognize no
[40:43] matter how much God Is Standing present
[40:45] you've got to believe it that's all so
[40:48] you can invite him here but if you don't
[40:50] believe he showed up he can't do you no
[40:52] good well I invited him to church but I
[40:54] didn't get what I wanted well you didn't
[40:56] believe believe that when you ask him to
[40:57] come he would actually come but see what
[41:00] he does he always keeps his appointments
[41:02] he has never failed to show up when he's
[41:05] called on the scene if you have need of
[41:07] him he can be there and and if you'll
[41:09] just call him up one time and say Lord I
[41:11] need your presence in my life then
[41:13] believe that he's going to come
[41:15] according to his word but see we call
[41:18] him on the scene Jesus we need your help
[41:20] and then we don't believe that he
[41:22] actually is going to come so that's why
[41:24] brother Brandon would say he is not
[41:26] recog when he's not recognized then his
[41:28] power is not revealed brother Brandon
[41:31] could stand there and and tell the
[41:33] people who they were what their names
[41:34] was but had brother brandham not
[41:36] recognized he was in the presence of the
[41:39] discerner then he could have never done
[41:41] that but you'll hear him stand at the
[41:42] pull pit and he'll say things like he's
[41:44] here now he recognized the presence came
[41:48] then he didn't have to worry about
[41:50] getting a name wrong or an address wrong
[41:52] the presence of God was there and that's
[41:54] the way it is today I don't have have to
[41:56] worry about what I'm preaching to you
[41:57] today if I feel the presence of God here
[42:00] and I know that he's here to vindicate
[42:02] his word it's not vindicating me and
[42:04] there's not any Vindication for any
[42:06] other preacher today V God Vindicated
[42:08] his man for the age but what we're
[42:10] standing here today we recognize the
[42:12] presence of God is here and when we move
[42:14] ourselves out of the way then God can
[42:16] show up and speak to your heart and your
[42:18] situation and whatever you have need of
[42:21] he is not going to leave you comfortless
[42:23] but he sent the Holy Spirit through the
[42:25] men of God to speak directly to your
[42:28] situation amen but what we've done is
[42:30] we've removed the presence of God and
[42:32] we've put it on a a mechanical device or
[42:35] we put it on something that that that is
[42:37] not in the word and if God's presence
[42:39] shows up it will always be according to
[42:42] his word can you say amen God is not
[42:45] going to come in another way outside of
[42:47] his word he didn't come and say well
[42:49] we're going to we're going to have
[42:50] church a certain way because we feel
[42:51] like it well outside the word of God God
[42:54] cannot vindicate the way you're doing it
[42:57] God will only vindicate the word of God
[43:00] by bringing it to pass and so when God
[43:02] shows up when his presence comes down
[43:04] now you can have an anointing you can
[43:05] feel God you could be in the Assembly of
[43:07] God church or you could be in this
[43:09] church or that church and I don't have a
[43:11] I don't say they don't feel the presence
[43:13] of God come by their way but what it is
[43:15] an anointing on the flesh but when
[43:17] there's no obedience to the word there
[43:19] right but when you come in obedience to
[43:21] the word then God can actually reveal
[43:24] his power through you by his presence
[43:27] and his word you can't take the two and
[43:29] separate them when Jesus was standing
[43:31] there he was the word and when Jesus was
[43:34] standing there he had the power in him
[43:36] see the word and the spirit were in the
[43:38] same place in the same body and so is it
[43:41] today if you are the body of Christ how
[43:43] many are today if you the body of Christ
[43:46] then the spirit and the word are in you
[43:49] and you can speak whatever you have need
[43:53] of so you got to believe it he said God
[43:56] Is Standing present you've got to
[43:58] believe it that's all the presence of
[44:00] God cannot be revealed to you if you
[44:03] don't believe it now we'll see here that
[44:04] in Matthew 16 and Matthew chapter 16:15
[44:08] Peter believed and he had a revelation
[44:11] of who Jesus Christ was now some say
[44:13] you're this some say you're that but he
[44:15] had to have a revelation of who was
[44:17] actually standing there he had to know
[44:18] who the man was this was not just a man
[44:21] but this was this was Christ this was
[44:23] this was the man that God had spoken in
[44:26] the Old Testament to come and now he had
[44:28] come the prophecy had been fulfilled and
[44:30] he said in verse 15 he said said unto
[44:33] them who do you say that I am and Simon
[44:35] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[44:36] Christ the son of the Living God and
[44:38] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[44:40] art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and
[44:43] Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[44:45] my Father which is in heaven and I say
[44:48] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[44:50] This Rock I will build my church and the
[44:52] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[44:54] it now if you'll see there it took
[44:56] Revelation to know who Jesus was he had
[44:58] to recognize who Jesus was in order to
[45:01] be blessed by Jesus blessed art thou
[45:03] Peter blessed art thou why because he
[45:06] recognized who God was and if you'll
[45:09] just recognize his presence one time
[45:11] recognize his word that has come by and
[45:13] changed your life then God is going to
[45:16] say I'm going to bless you because
[45:17] you're the Seed of Abraham I want to
[45:19] pour my blessings out on you I want to
[45:21] pour my spirit out well come on somebody
[45:23] I want to pour my spirit on you you are
[45:26] a blessed people and a blessed
[45:28] generation why because you've recognized
[45:31] who you've come in contact with it's one
[45:34] thing to know there's something
[45:35] different in the room it's another thing
[45:37] to know what that different is it's
[45:39] another thing know Jesus actually showed
[45:41] up he came on time he came when he was
[45:44] called why because you've recognized him
[45:46] as more than just a fanatic spirit in
[45:49] the room you've you've you've realized
[45:52] that it's not just a feeling anymore
[45:54] it's not just an emotion that shows up
[45:56] but it is a lifechanging God that has
[45:59] come into the room and has changed your
[46:02] life Peter was in the same presence that
[46:05] the Pharisees and the Sadducees were in
[46:07] there was unbelievers and Believers that
[46:09] stood there every congregation can be a
[46:11] believer a make believer if you're
[46:13] sitting at home by yourself that's a
[46:14] hard one to
[46:16] swallow every congregation but that'd be
[46:18] Body Soul and Spirit right so we could
[46:20] be that way I guess I guess if you were
[46:22] just one person in the middle of the
[46:23] World by yourself you could still
[46:25] fulfill that quote but he said that's
[46:27] why we have people who can sit and
[46:29] brother brand goes on here let me let me
[46:30] skip down just a little bit half my
[46:32] time's gone God doesn't always move in
[46:34] that way he said the presence of God can
[46:36] uh can cause you to do this he said and
[46:38] and once in the presence of God you get
[46:40] quieted so the presence of God is not
[46:42] always in the same way if you see what
[46:43] he's saying here this is in a hidden
[46:45] life in Christ he said once in the
[46:47] presence of God you get quieted you're
[46:48] not tossed about by everything you know
[46:50] where you're standing there's something
[46:52] that happens you know that you're a real
[46:54] Christian you know know that you've been
[46:56] in contact with somebody that loves you
[46:59] yeah Somebody Loves You somebody answers
[47:01] your prayers somebody told you you're
[47:04] going to make it somebody said you're
[47:06] mine and I won't lose one of them well
[47:08] did you hear what the pastor said this
[47:10] morning if you were elected of God you
[47:12] have a choice to make but the choice you
[47:15] make will be for God why because he knew
[47:18] the choice that you would
[47:20] make so we don't have to worry about it
[47:23] from God's point of view he don't even
[47:25] worry that you're going to be lost
[47:26] because he already knew the choices you
[47:29] would
[47:30] make thank you Lord now they they notice
[47:33] here when you're in the presence of
[47:34] Jesus something changes and something
[47:36] there is a power that is given you by
[47:38] the presence of Jesus brother brand says
[47:40] here in God's chosen place of worship he
[47:42] said look at Peter and John when they
[47:44] was questioned about healing a man at
[47:45] the gate beautiful he said they they
[47:47] perceived those priests did that they
[47:49] were both ignorant and unlearned men but
[47:51] they had taken notice that they had been
[47:54] with Jesus when you're in the presence
[47:56] of the Lord something changes even the
[47:58] countenance on your face could change
[48:00] you ever seen somebody get down at the
[48:01] altar and they went down there with an
[48:03] arrogant spirit and they get up they
[48:04] don't look so arrogant no more why
[48:06] because they've been crying they humbled
[48:08] themselves down at an altar somewhere
[48:10] they humbled themselves and I tell you
[48:12] humility will do us all some good
[48:14] because when you when you really humble
[48:15] yourself it'll change the very
[48:17] countenance on your face he said but
[48:20] they had taken notice they had been with
[48:21] Jesus because that they were doing the
[48:24] things that he did and if you're in
[48:26] contact with Jesus you will do what he
[48:28] does well come on somebody you will say
[48:31] what he said you will believe what he
[48:33] taught you to believe and you will not
[48:35] just say it with your lips but you will
[48:37] believe it with your heart and he said
[48:40] he said and he must be about the
[48:41] father's business they they knew that
[48:43] who they were because they were doing
[48:45] things that he did and he must be about
[48:46] the father's business and today it must
[48:49] be the same we must be about our
[48:52] father's business we must be doing what
[48:54] Jesus did we must he's saying what Jesus
[48:56] said well come on church God did not put
[48:58] you here just to be another person or
[49:01] just to be another church member but he
[49:02] put you here to do the same works that
[49:04] he did because why you are his body you
[49:07] are his hands you are his feet he has no
[49:09] hands but yours he has no feet but yours
[49:12] he has no mouth but yours but you are
[49:14] the body of Christ on the earth now and
[49:16] you are actually revealing Jesus Christ
[49:19] to the world you are the only presence
[49:22] of God some people ever feel why because
[49:25] you create a presence around you did you
[49:28] know that you are actually a little
[49:29] creator that that the room you walk into
[49:32] can change because of who you are
[49:34] because when you walk in somewhere you
[49:36] are not just another Christian but you
[49:38] are the Bride of Jesus Christ you have
[49:40] come in contact with the word of God you
[49:43] have come in contact with a lifechanging
[49:45] God and he has moved you from just
[49:48] another person just another church
[49:50] member to an eternal being come on
[49:52] somebody and there is actually a
[49:54] presence about you that is like the
[49:57] presence of
[49:58] God well how do we know that they knew
[50:01] they had been with Jesus because they
[50:03] did the works of Jesus so if you're
[50:05] doing the works of Jesus won't they look
[50:07] at you and say you've been with Jesus
[50:10] you're going to church like Jesus said
[50:12] you're you're doing everything he said
[50:14] to do well you say well Jesus didn't say
[50:15] it well the word is Christ and I we just
[50:18] go on down that road right there if
[50:20] Christ is his word and his word said go
[50:22] to church you're actually doing what
[50:24] Christ said by S here
[50:26] tonight you're actually doing what he
[50:28] said when you lay hands on the sick and
[50:31] they shall recover but I want to take
[50:33] you back to the beginning for a minute
[50:34] and realize you've got to believe when
[50:37] you do it that it actually works or
[50:39] there's no reason to do it in the first
[50:41] place there's no reason to invite his
[50:43] presence in to a prayer line meeting and
[50:45] say we're going to lay hands on the sick
[50:47] and they shall recover well there's no
[50:49] reason to do it if you don't believe
[50:50] he's going to show up and heal the
[50:52] people there's no reason to do it if you
[50:54] don't believe he's going to show up and
[50:56] vindicate his word to the people why
[50:58] it's not vindicating you it's not
[51:00] vindicating me but it is vindicating his
[51:02] word that was already spoken and you are
[51:05] the ones to vindicate his
[51:07] word you are prophecy fulfilled there's
[51:11] going to come a bride that won't fall
[51:13] and you are
[51:15] she brother B said you you know in the
[51:18] Old Testament to enter behind the skin
[51:20] was death to stay from behind it was
[51:22] death then to enter into his glory was
[51:24] death and now to stay away from his
[51:26] glory is death and and now listen to
[51:29] this he said now that happened of course
[51:31] at the Ring of the veil at Calvary when
[51:33] the veil was rent the old Veil now to
[51:36] stay out of his presence is death do we
[51:40] need his presence if you stay out of his
[51:42] presence it's death but to get into his
[51:45] presence I say there's life there's not
[51:47] just a little bit of life but there's
[51:49] eternal life there's fullness of joy
[51:51] there's there I'll tell you what there's
[51:53] a move of the spirit where Jesus is you
[51:55] say well how do we know Jesus is here
[51:57] did you invite him then believe he's
[51:59] here and we know he's going to show up
[52:01] because he keeps all of his appointments
[52:03] and he's always on time and he is a God
[52:06] not of yesterday not a god of history
[52:08] but he's a god of right now he's a god
[52:11] at 4:00 in the afternoon in Hardy
[52:13] Arkansas why because God has promised to
[52:16] show up why is there two or three here
[52:18] that believe he's coming is there two or
[52:20] three believe he's coming then he's got
[52:21] to be
[52:23] here well I don't feel him yet well he's
[52:25] already here but sometimes you got to
[52:27] reach out and say thank you for showing
[52:30] up on my behalf thank you for coming
[52:32] where you've been invited thank you for
[52:34] coming by my way because I needed
[52:36] healing here tonight thank you for
[52:38] coming by my way why just go ahead and
[52:40] start telling it thank you for coming
[52:42] even if you don't feel him here amen
[52:45] well I don't feel him in this service if
[52:47] you invited him believe he's coming and
[52:49] go ahead and worship him anyway because
[52:52] he promised to show
[52:54] up but you got to recognize his presence
[52:57] and you you may invite him and he may
[52:59] show up and you still don't know he
[53:01] showed up and what that is is that's the
[53:03] fact you're not in tune with the spirit
[53:06] of Christ and so we think it's got to be
[53:10] and I'm not against emotion you know
[53:11] that if you've heard me preach I I I I
[53:13] think I wish everybody here was
[53:15] running but that's not always the way
[53:19] his presence moves and it's okay it's
[53:22] okay to have a service where there's
[53:24] people sitting there and they're crying
[53:27] and there's tears running down their
[53:28] face and there's a a quiet Spirit on the
[53:31] audience that's okay if that's how he
[53:35] chooses to come we say thank you for
[53:36] showing up if he comes and it's just a a
[53:39] maybe a man standing here and maybe he's
[53:42] teaching the word to you did you know
[53:43] that's one way of him showing up because
[53:46] he is the word if the word's being
[53:49] preached how could he be away from his
[53:51] word if he is the word we're trying to
[53:53] take the spirit and the word and divide
[53:56] them divide them like stepchildren and
[53:58] we're trying to make one over here and
[54:00] one over here but let me tell you this
[54:02] God is always with his
[54:05] word if the true word is being preached
[54:07] across this Pulpit then God will stand
[54:09] here to back it up he will always
[54:11] accompany his message is that what he
[54:15] said now he said the angel of the Lord
[54:17] accompanies the message always in a time
[54:19] of decision thank you Lord now if we
[54:21] want life we know we've got to come into
[54:23] the presence of God how many know that
[54:25] to be true he said it's death to stay
[54:27] out of his presence so the opposite of
[54:30] death would be life so to stay away from
[54:33] his presence tonight is
[54:34] nothing but death oh so let us just for
[54:39] a few moments if I can I'm going to try
[54:41] to bring this down to a close but I want
[54:43] you to recognize tonight that whatever
[54:45] your situation is on life is in the
[54:48] building oh yeah whatever you feel
[54:51] tonight life is in the building however
[54:53] bad you feel life is is in the building
[54:56] do you need a touch from God life is in
[54:58] the building well come on somebody
[55:00] you've just got to believe it put your
[55:01] faith to work tonight and believe that
[55:03] he is and he will show up just like he
[55:07] said he would brother R said no man can
[55:10] be the same nothing can be the same when
[55:13] it once meets God you'll never be the
[55:16] same how many's met God here tonight
[55:19] then don't tell me that you can't make
[55:20] it you'll never be the same as what you
[55:22] were you may fall you may backslide you
[55:26] may go a million miles from the truth
[55:28] but that million miles is not too far
[55:30] for him to bring you
[55:32] back because he he's not going to lose
[55:34] you and you and I'll say this if you do
[55:37] go the presence of God will let you go
[55:40] so far and bring you right back why
[55:43] because the presence of God you've
[55:45] already been in contact with it and one
[55:47] time you may be out there sitting on a
[55:49] bar stool and the presence of God starts
[55:51] tugging at your heart and what happens
[55:53] then you recognize the presence of God
[55:56] because you've been in it before and and
[55:58] what was the definition of it it is
[56:00] something you've actually felt before it
[56:03] is recognizing it is like I know that I
[56:06] felt this before and you know it's
[56:08] something different from what the world
[56:10] offers well come on somebody you ever
[56:12] heard this rock concerts there's nothing
[56:14] about the presence of God in them
[56:16] there's nothing about the presence of
[56:17] God in country music out here today but
[56:19] when you've ever heard a song sang under
[56:21] the anointing power of God there is a
[56:24] presence of God that goes with that song
[56:26] and with that singer why because God is
[56:28] showing up to vindicate his own
[56:32] word he said God has always it's been
[56:35] that way and every time he come when
[56:37] Jesus was here the first time he said
[56:39] you whiten you garnish the walls and the
[56:41] tombs of the prophets and you put them
[56:42] in there he said see something happens
[56:45] and it passes by and God hides it from
[56:48] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[56:50] reveals it to babes such as we learn and
[56:52] Jesus thanked the father for doing such
[56:54] that's in Luke 10:21 it goes right by
[56:57] the people and they don't know
[56:59] it come on somebody the presence of God
[57:03] unrecognized come on it's the presence
[57:06] of God that can be walking right down
[57:08] your aisle to heal the sick raise the
[57:10] Dead cast out demons and you don't
[57:13] realize he's there but if you just
[57:15] recognize it and believe it you don't
[57:18] have to have fear no more you don't have
[57:20] to have worry no more you don't have to
[57:21] have complexes no more because Jesus has
[57:24] walk down your
[57:26] [Music]
[57:27] Pew it goes right by the people and they
[57:29] don't know it for instance he said the
[57:31] Catholic people they took Jonah Arc in
[57:32] France and and and and and she had led a
[57:35] revolutionary in France but she was
[57:37] really a servant of Christ and he said
[57:39] what did your church do to her burn her
[57:40] at the stake as a witch because she had
[57:42] seen visions and was spiritual and the
[57:44] Catholic Church burner as a witch and he
[57:46] said a few years afterwards they found
[57:48] out that that woman was a saint so of
[57:50] course what they did was they dug up the
[57:51] priest's body who had burned her and
[57:53] they burnt them and so and they done
[57:56] great penants and and things like that
[57:58] he said they thrown him into the river
[57:59] of course and and done great penants for
[58:00] that for digging up the priest's body he
[58:02] said now in the days of the prophets
[58:04] that what happened they did the same
[58:06] thing they didn't recognize them till
[58:09] they had already done uh come and done
[58:11] the ministry and had finished and took
[58:13] out that elected and then after they
[58:15] were gone they recognized that there had
[58:17] been a prophet among them but it was too
[58:19] late and so what it is today many times
[58:21] you'll sit in a service on a Sunday
[58:23] afternoon or a Sunday morning morning or
[58:25] Wednesday night and Jesus comes by to
[58:27] heal you Jesus comes by to save you
[58:30] Jesus comes by to give forgiveness to
[58:32] your heart and make you repent but what
[58:34] do you do you don't recognize him until
[58:36] Monday morning and then you look back
[58:38] and say hey the presence of God was
[58:40] there and I failed to move and react to
[58:43] the presence of God but I'm I don't want
[58:45] you to miss the opportunity of reacting
[58:47] to the presence of God this afternoon if
[58:50] God has put a desire in your heart for
[58:51] an alter call you go to the altar there
[58:54] don't have to be man standing here
[58:55] saying you come to the Altar and beg you
[58:57] and pull you but if God has placed that
[58:59] desire that is the presence of God
[59:02] reaching out to you and bringing you
[59:04] forward God doesn't have to make you
[59:06] come up here and stand here for healing
[59:08] he don't have to push you to do it he
[59:09] don't pull you to do it through through
[59:11] me or any other man but there's
[59:13] something on the inside of you that
[59:15] knows you need to make a move for God
[59:17] but the reason you don't do it you don't
[59:18] really believe that the presence of God
[59:21] is what's working in your life but if
[59:23] you really believe that that is the
[59:25] presence of God that is tugging at your
[59:27] heart strings then what you need to do
[59:29] is react to that promise it's
[59:31] recognizing and then acting upon what
[59:33] you recognize to be the
[59:35] truth well come on somebody you felt
[59:38] that you've set in services and God has
[59:40] moved on your heart and said you need to
[59:42] be at the altar somewhere and you didn't
[59:44] do it did you know that every time you
[59:45] don't follow the leading of the Lord
[59:47] that voice gets quieter and quieter and
[59:50] quieter and every time that you actually
[59:53] heed to that voice then it actually re
[59:55] rejuvenates you and starts making you
[59:58] more in tune with that voice and then it
[1:00:00] makes you when you might be at the altar
[1:00:01] two services in a row well that ain't
[1:00:03] going to hurt nobody we're here to serve
[1:00:05] you we're here to help you we're here to
[1:00:08] let Sinners come back to Christ we're
[1:00:10] here to preach conviction to the hearts
[1:00:12] of the people we're here to let you know
[1:00:14] there is a living God in a living body
[1:00:16] and he's here today to do what he said
[1:00:19] to
[1:00:20] do he said I will be among you if
[1:00:23] there's two or three ga he's here but
[1:00:25] you just got to call him one time and
[1:00:27] say Lord your word's there I know you're
[1:00:30] here let me recognize your
[1:00:34] presence so I would say that many times
[1:00:36] we invite him and he's already here and
[1:00:40] and that's good he goes where he's
[1:00:42] invited but I want you to recognize many
[1:00:45] times all we have to do is just
[1:00:47] recognize he's already showed up you
[1:00:50] didn't have to invite Jesus if you were
[1:00:52] standing next to him and and invite
[1:00:54] Jesus say Jesus I need you to come and
[1:00:57] and do this and do that no you were
[1:00:58] standing there just ask what you will
[1:01:01] and it can and will be done why because
[1:01:03] you're already in the presence of
[1:01:06] Jesus brother said look at the priest
[1:01:09] when they see him Express themselves
[1:01:10] exactly in the word what he was saying
[1:01:12] they said it's a be elah what was it it
[1:01:14] was there there was no seed on the
[1:01:16] inside to respond to the word that was
[1:01:18] standing there and yet they had they had
[1:01:21] read the scroll they had read the
[1:01:23] prophecy here's the one to come and yet
[1:01:25] they don't want to actually come under
[1:01:27] subjection to the presence of God why
[1:01:30] because they couldn't be the same way
[1:01:32] anymore if they'd actually come under
[1:01:34] his presence you can't be the same
[1:01:37] person when you come under his presence
[1:01:39] I I want to get rid of this bitterness I
[1:01:40] want to get rid of this hate I say come
[1:01:42] in the presence of God and in the
[1:01:44] presence of God there is Joy there is
[1:01:47] peace there is healing well come on
[1:01:49] somebody there is everything you have
[1:01:51] need of in his presence am yes sir
[1:01:55] brother B said he said uh he said there
[1:01:58] was a prostitute woman there that he had
[1:02:00] met at the gate and told her expressed
[1:02:01] this this is the woman at the well he
[1:02:03] said and he told her what she had done
[1:02:05] and said she said well sir I perceive
[1:02:07] that you are a prophet now there's a
[1:02:08] difference right there one had come in
[1:02:11] contact with the presence of God and
[1:02:13] recognized the presence of God and the
[1:02:15] others had come in contact with God
[1:02:17] although more religious and may have
[1:02:19] been living a better life but they come
[1:02:21] in Pre in in contact with the presence
[1:02:23] of God and said fanaticism we don't need
[1:02:26] such a thing in our church we don't need
[1:02:27] a little shou and spell in church well
[1:02:29] come on somebody we don't need the
[1:02:31] spirit of God moving in our church no
[1:02:32] more what is it it is one that does not
[1:02:35] recognize that is the presence of God
[1:02:38] and another one is saying Lord I I
[1:02:40] perceive you're here I know you're here
[1:02:42] to do what you promis to do and that's
[1:02:45] when you can have healing that's when
[1:02:47] you can go testify to your neighbor
[1:02:49] that's when you can go back into the
[1:02:50] City and say come see what God is doing
[1:02:53] in Hardy Arkansas we're not trying to
[1:02:55] work something up we're trying not
[1:02:56] trying to make you do something or make
[1:02:58] you go here make you go there but I want
[1:03:00] to tell you this you need to get into
[1:03:02] the presence of God and let your life
[1:03:04] come under subjection to the word of God
[1:03:07] and let All Things become new in your
[1:03:10] life Let Your Attitude Change let your
[1:03:12] spirit change well come on somebody let
[1:03:14] your nature change it'll make you when
[1:03:16] you're when you're barking at somebody
[1:03:18] and growling at somebody it'll start
[1:03:20] make you it'll make you act like a dove
[1:03:22] it'll make you act like like you like
[1:03:24] somebody when you really don't why
[1:03:26] because your Nature has changed you're
[1:03:27] no longer going after somebody trying to
[1:03:29] hurt them but you're going after
[1:03:31] somebody trying to help them and bring
[1:03:33] them back because Jesus never went out
[1:03:35] and going into all the land and doing
[1:03:37] all manner of bad things but he went
[1:03:39] into the land and did all manner of good
[1:03:40] things he went to heal the sick and rais
[1:03:42] the dead and so will you do the same
[1:03:45] works that he did if you have his
[1:03:47] presence with
[1:03:49] you that's like saying Jesus can be here
[1:03:51] and not do the same Works no if he's
[1:03:53] here and in his body he will do the same
[1:03:56] works and he is here in his body that he
[1:03:59] has chosen to be in today Jesus said
[1:04:03] Jesus excuse me Jesus turned and said I
[1:04:06] am he that speaks with you there was no
[1:04:08] such an expression as be's above from
[1:04:11] this woman that's right she left her
[1:04:14] water pot ran into the City and said
[1:04:15] come see a man who told me the things
[1:04:17] that I've done isn't this the very
[1:04:18] Messiah she recognized God showed up and
[1:04:22] did you know it was exactly according to
[1:04:23] the word of God the way he
[1:04:25] came it it was exactly according to the
[1:04:28] word of God and she recognized it to be
[1:04:30] the word of God revealing himself to her
[1:04:33] well come on somebody we have had the
[1:04:35] same Ministry a revealing of the son of
[1:04:38] man in this hour we don't have to wonder
[1:04:41] if it's right or wonder if it's wrong
[1:04:43] but if the spirit of Jesus Christ is in
[1:04:45] you it will it will back up the word of
[1:04:47] God that has come by the prophet of
[1:04:49] Malachi 4 with a great big amen why
[1:04:52] because it is thus sayith the the Lord
[1:04:54] it is a message that was sent to you you
[1:04:56] say well I don't believe it well let me
[1:04:58] go and tell you something if you'll read
[1:04:59] the scriptures the scriptures testify
[1:05:02] one to
[1:05:03] come amen if the scriptures testified of
[1:05:06] Jesus and the ones that turned him down
[1:05:08] had no seed and had no life in there to
[1:05:11] respond to him but there has to be a
[1:05:13] seed on the inside to believe what is
[1:05:16] being said to you if that woman would
[1:05:18] have been sitting there and he would
[1:05:19] have told her those things she would
[1:05:20] have said well you're a fortune teller
[1:05:22] you're a devil you come to tell me
[1:05:24] things that that that I already know I
[1:05:26] don't need to know that no but the
[1:05:27] attitude Changed by that woman she
[1:05:29] didn't no longer say I don't I don't I
[1:05:31] don't associate with you know she was
[1:05:33] one of them after that she was a woman
[1:05:36] chosen by God why because the seed was
[1:05:38] already there the belief was already on
[1:05:41] the inside but it had to be resurrected
[1:05:43] to Life by the word of God and the
[1:05:46] presence of
[1:05:47] Jesus so I say today you need the
[1:05:51] presence of God in your services again
[1:05:53] we do we need the presence of God back
[1:05:55] in the services and I believe if the
[1:05:58] word is being preached which we believe
[1:06:00] it is if the word is being preached then
[1:06:03] the presence of God will accompany the
[1:06:04] message so let's not come to church
[1:06:06] saying well I hope he shows up if the
[1:06:08] word's being preached say thank you Lord
[1:06:11] for coming by my way thank you for
[1:06:13] coming and Discerning my thought today
[1:06:15] and the word will discern your thought
[1:06:17] the word is the deserter of every
[1:06:18] situation in your life and he is here
[1:06:21] tonight to do whatever you need him to
[1:06:23] do
[1:06:26] you say well maybe if brother Brandon
[1:06:29] was here to say it no it's in you you
[1:06:31] are the bride that Jesus spoke of you
[1:06:34] are the ones that were called out by a
[1:06:36] prophet to say what a prophet said what
[1:06:39] did a prophet tell us he said in you
[1:06:41] would he said in her under your
[1:06:42] messenger in her would be the final
[1:06:45] voice to the final age and if you're
[1:06:47] speaking the same word that the prophet
[1:06:49] spoke then the same spirit that stood
[1:06:51] there and Vindicated his word will
[1:06:53] vindicate IND at your word if you're
[1:06:55] saying what he's
[1:06:56] saying I don't believe in putting your
[1:06:59] own interpretation to the message I
[1:07:00] don't believe in saying it how you want
[1:07:02] to say it I believe in saying it like a
[1:07:04] prophet said it and I'll tell you what I
[1:07:06] I believe God will honor that word and
[1:07:09] back it up with his presence every time
[1:07:12] amen sir brother said you know something
[1:07:15] another he said you know what I'm
[1:07:16] thinking friends I'm I'm not scolding
[1:07:18] the people I'll say the same I'm not
[1:07:20] scolding you he said but I want you to
[1:07:22] know one thing we got too much

[1:11:53] it is that's good if you're sitting in
[1:11:55] this building with one or two other
[1:11:57] people and you're a Believer and you
[1:11:59] believe they're Believers and I think
[1:12:00] we've got at least three Believers in
[1:12:03] here me and my brother are two of them
[1:12:06] no and my wife
[1:12:09] yes and so we enter in here if you
[1:12:11] believe there's two other believers with
[1:12:13] you you know he's
[1:12:14] here so why would you come and say well
[1:12:17] I'm not sure he'll show up tonight have
[1:12:19] you ever went to a service and and I've
[1:12:21] said this I I'll say it well I just
[1:12:23] didn't really you know it just felt like
[1:12:24] there was a bad atmosphere tonight well
[1:12:26] maybe I created that bad
[1:12:28] atmosphere you are the creator of the
[1:12:30] atmosphere you bring to church come on
[1:12:32] somebody you are the creator of the
[1:12:34] atmosphere in your home you are the
[1:12:36] creator of the way the service goes
[1:12:39] because all it takes is one person to
[1:12:41] really in get in tune with the presence
[1:12:43] of God and recognize he's here I I've
[1:12:45] heard some people in this church that
[1:12:47] just let loose sometimes and Shout a
[1:12:48] little bit and it makes me feel better
[1:12:50] well I know we don't go by feeling but I
[1:12:52] like to feel him while he's
[1:12:55] here I like to know that the presence of
[1:12:58] the Lord is here but even if I don't
[1:13:00] feel it he's still here he's an
[1:13:03] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:13:05] he's always near you whenever you have
[1:13:08] need of him call him up and tell him
[1:13:10] what you want call his name on the scene
[1:13:12] Jesus and he's always
[1:13:15] there speak his word and he is in his
[1:13:19] word there he
[1:13:21] is brother said we want to be so big and
[1:13:24] wear some kind of big turned around
[1:13:26] colar and some kind of clothes you know
[1:13:29] that makes us look so holy and
[1:13:31] Reverend there is no Holiness with
[1:13:33] us we can't be holy Holiness is of God
[1:13:39] he said certainly it ain't a holy church
[1:13:41] come on
[1:13:42] somebody my church and your church have
[1:13:44] got the same
[1:13:45] problems even those of us to go to the
[1:13:48] same church you didn't know that that's
[1:13:50] right why because sin is always trying
[1:13:53] to creep its way in how many knows that
[1:13:56] Satan is always trying to come to church
[1:13:58] we reserve a seat for him on the front
[1:13:59] corner he's the most most faithful
[1:14:02] member you've got come on he never
[1:14:05] misses a service that's right Satan is
[1:14:08] always there but you realize how we put
[1:14:10] him under our feet is by recognizing
[1:14:13] that greater is he that is with us and
[1:14:15] in us than he that comes in and tries to
[1:14:18] defeat US during our
[1:14:21] services we don't have to give in to the
[1:14:23] bluff of the devil we don't have well
[1:14:25] come on somebody let me preach for a
[1:14:27] minute before I get out of here we don't
[1:14:28] have to give in and be a defeated people
[1:14:31] when we are supposed to come before his
[1:14:34] presence with gladness with singing with
[1:14:36] joy why because we know he will show up
[1:14:40] just exactly at 10:30 on Sunday morning
[1:14:44] on we don't have to change our times to
[1:14:46] see if he'll show up at another time why
[1:14:48] God is an everpresent help he's always
[1:14:50] on time he's always here he doesn't wait
[1:14:52] for you you he's he listen he doesn't
[1:14:55] have to wait for you to to come in here
[1:14:57] and say let's bring the presence of the
[1:14:58] go of God down now I know sometimes we
[1:15:01] don't feel him like we should but if you
[1:15:02] want to feel him all you have to do is
[1:15:05] recognize he's already
[1:15:09] here it don't go by feeling he's here
[1:15:11] anyway but if but you can feel him I
[1:15:14] want to get that to you tonight you
[1:15:16] don't have to sit here miserable you can
[1:15:18] feel the presence of God brother the
[1:15:20] same you can feel him when you're
[1:15:21] driving to church on Sunday morning
[1:15:23] morning you can feel him sitting on a
[1:15:24] 3:00 service and you've ate too much but
[1:15:27] the presence of God can still come on
[1:15:29] the scene and show up brother JT you can
[1:15:32] sit there not feeling good on a Sunday
[1:15:33] afternoon what why would you sit there
[1:15:35] and do that why because you're expecting
[1:15:37] the presence of God to meet with his
[1:15:40] people so you come to church anyway
[1:15:43] brother Bill said he may not feel like
[1:15:44] getting here on a Sunday morning but he
[1:15:46] comes anyway why because God promised to
[1:15:49] be where the people of God are and where
[1:15:51] the well come on somebody we might as
[1:15:54] well come to church and have a good time
[1:15:56] because if you set it home there's a
[1:15:58] there's you and the devil and you're
[1:16:00] sitting there and you're thinking well
[1:16:01] then bunch of Fanatics down there I
[1:16:03] heard somebody shout and scream out well
[1:16:05] it'll do you some good one time to
[1:16:07] scream out and say you know what I'm
[1:16:08] just going to let loose and let God have
[1:16:11] his way why because it doesn't matter
[1:16:13] how you felt when you come it doesn't
[1:16:15] matter how you feel when you leave God
[1:16:17] showed up recognizing while he's
[1:16:21] here come on
[1:16:23] it's God in the people it's not a holy
[1:16:25] church it's not a Holy Mountain it's God
[1:16:27] in the people can you say Amen Peter
[1:16:29] referred to the Mount Transfiguration
[1:16:31] the holy Mount he said it meant the holy
[1:16:33] God was on the mountain he said look at
[1:16:34] it he said it was a holy God there the
[1:16:36] presence of God what made it holy it's
[1:16:39] the presence of God in our midst now
[1:16:41] that brings
[1:16:42] Holiness oh yeah do we need Holiness yes
[1:16:45] the presence of God will bring
[1:16:48] it he said not my Holiness sir it's a
[1:16:52] prophet who I was would say lived a
[1:16:53] really really good life lived a life
[1:16:56] above reproach lived a life worthy of
[1:16:58] the Gospel he said it's not my presence
[1:17:01] he said it's not my presence that brings
[1:17:03] Holiness it's the presence of God he
[1:17:06] said it's not yours but it's his
[1:17:08] Holiness his presence what is what
[1:17:10] brings the Holiness oh I wish I could
[1:17:12] stand I I really do I wish I could stand
[1:17:14] in the presence of brother brandham and
[1:17:16] shake his hand and talk to him but that
[1:17:18] wouldn't do you any more good than the
[1:17:20] presence that's here right
[1:17:21] now woo
[1:17:24] well I'd like to be in the presence of
[1:17:25] the literal Corporal body of Jesus that
[1:17:27] wouldn't do you no more good than the
[1:17:29] presence that's here right now I'd like
[1:17:31] to be in the presence of Paul that won't
[1:17:32] do you any more good why because a
[1:17:34] commission was sent to this brother and
[1:17:37] this brother and this brother and you
[1:17:38] sisters he didn't say who he said go lay
[1:17:41] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:17:43] when you got a kid at home sick you
[1:17:45] mothers that's you you know that's your
[1:17:46] congregation you can put your hand on
[1:17:48] them and pray for that child and they
[1:17:50] can be healed why because it's the
[1:17:51] spirit of God in you just like it is in
[1:17:54] the preacher just like it is in the
[1:17:56] pastor just like it is in any man that's
[1:17:58] ever come that's been Vindicated they've
[1:18:00] had to come with the word of God and
[1:18:02] they have come to show you that God
[1:18:05] still lives brother Ram didn't come to
[1:18:08] to to reveal his own Ministry he come to
[1:18:10] reveal the son of man was was here and
[1:18:13] it wasn't the son of man but it was a
[1:18:14] son of man revealing the son of man why
[1:18:17] but it was the same God doing the same
[1:18:19] Works through a man to show that he can
[1:18:21] still do them through
[1:18:23] you do you know that brother random
[1:18:25] didn't come in vain I'm about done give
[1:18:28] me just I have two or three more minutes
[1:18:30] you know go brother Ram didn't come in
[1:18:32] vain he didn't come to show a gift and
[1:18:34] show that God still lived and go off the
[1:18:37] scene and leave us with nothing no he
[1:18:39] left us with the word that was to
[1:18:41] restore us back to the original church
[1:18:44] that went through the land doing the
[1:18:46] same works that Jesus
[1:18:49] did Brother R didn't come to point us to
[1:18:52] a future future type of church or a
[1:18:54] future type of come on somebody he
[1:18:56] didn't come and say we're going to
[1:18:57] change everything no he's going to
[1:18:59] restore us back to the way the church
[1:19:02] was at the beginning that's right amen
[1:19:05] so you want to know how we should act
[1:19:07] let's go back and look at how Jesus was
[1:19:09] and let's look at the first church and
[1:19:11] say how should we approach God the same
[1:19:14] way they did and God will move for you
[1:19:17] the same way that he did then why
[1:19:19] because it's the same presence of God in
[1:19:21] the same way working among his
[1:19:24] people sometimes I think we just get so
[1:19:27] down and so depressed because we don't
[1:19:29] realize who's in our
[1:19:33] midst we don't always have to call him
[1:19:35] on the scene he'll show up what brother
[1:19:37] Allan say I didn't pray he said I didn't
[1:19:39] didn't didn't have time to pray well
[1:19:41] Jesus is there anyway you know I I don't
[1:19:43] believe the disciples necessarily had to
[1:19:45] go wake him up he was in the boat they
[1:19:48] knew he was there so they could go talk
[1:19:49] to him but did you know he was in the
[1:19:51] boat so nothing could harm the boat if
[1:19:54] he's here in word form nothing can harm
[1:19:57] you if he's living in
[1:20:00] you it's not a closed book it's not a
[1:20:03] sealed up mystery anymore it is an
[1:20:06] opening of the word that is revealed
[1:20:08] that Christ is in you and his word is
[1:20:11] Christ Living in his
[1:20:14] people I I'm glad we don't serve a god
[1:20:17] of a sealed book anymore but we actually
[1:20:19] know what the word
[1:20:21] says we know what he said and we know
[1:20:24] what he does this stuff is falling
[1:20:28] everywhere we know who he is we know
[1:20:31] he's going to be here and we know he's
[1:20:33] here right
[1:20:35] now let me get on down here and Skip and
[1:20:38] I'll try to let you out he said the Wise
[1:20:40] Men followed no Observatory he said the
[1:20:42] Wise Men followed a star and no
[1:20:45] Observatory knows anything about it no
[1:20:47] one else saw it at all but those wise
[1:20:49] men because it was for them to see it
[1:20:52] they saw it it was real to
[1:20:55] them and he said when the light the
[1:20:57] pillar of fire smoke Paul down on the
[1:20:59] road to Damascus he recognized that he
[1:21:01] was in the presence of God now that
[1:21:02] Hebrew would never have called any other
[1:21:04] Spirit Lord but but but the but it was
[1:21:07] the same Pillar of Fire that had led his
[1:21:09] people out of the Wilderness he
[1:21:10] recognized it I've heard about that I
[1:21:14] recognize that's the same life that was
[1:21:16] with Moses you realize there's a group
[1:21:18] of people on the earth now that
[1:21:19] recognizes the same light came to a
[1:21:21] prophet that's Paul would have
[1:21:24] recognized this messenger you're put
[1:21:27] here for a purpose to recognize the
[1:21:28] messenger that came with a message to
[1:21:31] restore you back so you can recognize
[1:21:33] who you are he said and he said Paul he
[1:21:37] recognized that he was in the presence
[1:21:38] of God he said now that he would have
[1:21:40] never never would have known that had it
[1:21:42] not been the same one that was with
[1:21:43] Moses he said who are you and he said
[1:21:46] Saul why persecutest thou me and he said
[1:21:49] I am Jesus and Jesus said I come from
[1:21:51] God and I return to God and he was at
[1:21:52] that fire that was in the burning bush
[1:21:53] that led Moses and he said he returned
[1:21:55] back to that he said now here he was on
[1:21:58] the road down to Damascus and was
[1:22:00] stricken down and all the men that were
[1:22:02] with him they never saw that Pillar of
[1:22:04] Fire and it was so real that Paul it put
[1:22:07] his eyes out and he had to be led down
[1:22:09] the street called straight in Damascus
[1:22:11] he was blind he had to be led why this
[1:22:13] light this God himself come down and put
[1:22:16] his eyes out and it was it was Jesus in
[1:22:18] the in the light form and he said he
[1:22:19] went and laid he said and and he went
[1:22:21] and laid hands on him and and uh ananas
[1:22:23] a prophet down there saw in a vision
[1:22:25] went and laid hands on him and he
[1:22:26] received the Holy Ghost and the scales
[1:22:27] fell from his eyes and he could see
[1:22:29] again he said it was so real to him till
[1:22:31] it put his eyes out and yet none of the
[1:22:33] rest of them recognized it was there Oh
[1:22:35] my he said so it is tonight there is
[1:22:38] somebody sitting right here that can
[1:22:40] bring God on the scene when the brother
[1:22:42] will know and and the other brother will
[1:22:44] know nothing about it it's recognizing
[1:22:47] God God could be there to heal one and a
[1:22:50] person sitting next to him could not
[1:22:51] even feel the heal healing power of God
[1:22:53] in the building why you've got to
[1:22:55] recognize him when he comes it's
[1:22:57] important to know when he shows up it's
[1:22:59] important to reach out and touch him
[1:23:01] when you have need of him it's important
[1:23:03] to say you know what it's not by my
[1:23:05] might it's not by my power but it's by
[1:23:07] his Spirit sayith the lord it's whatever
[1:23:09] you say it's your word that can walk
[1:23:11] down the aisles it's your word that's in
[1:23:13] my heart it's your word that can change
[1:23:15] me from just a listener of the word to a
[1:23:18] doer of the same word why because God
[1:23:21] revealing himself through you as a
[1:23:25] Believer if the musicians would come I
