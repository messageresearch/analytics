speak through me Lord so that we could help these people today thank you Lord for everyone that's come those that couldn't come I pray you would just send a special blessing to them and touch each one of us now as the word Goes Forth we pray in Jesus name amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen goodness see each and every one of youen First Kings chapter 18 if you have your Bibles First Kings chapter 18 I won't take too much time tonight brother Stewart took some of my time so I'll just cut that out I'll just cut that out of mine and and did you enjoy that this morning didn't he do a wonderful job amen we sure love brother Stuart I got to pick on him though CU I get picked on every time I go long so return evil for evil or something like that first Kings chapter 18 and verse 19 we'll start with verse 19 now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets unto Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if baale then follow him and the people answered him not a word and you could be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word and over in 1 Corinthians 11 verse1 Paul said be followers of me even as I also am Christ am of Christ and if you take that just a simple thought tonight what is leading Us and how long will you be caught or how long halt you between two opinions a lot of times we let influences cause us to question our leadership that's right and I'm not necessarily talking about local leadership I'm talking about uh what we're following in the message of the hour and what we're following today which I believe is a Vindicated message is that okay and so I want to just lay a little background here and like I said I won't hold you along tonight but just uh I want you to think about what are we following are we following just another denomination are we following just just another word because many have come with a word from the Lord and it's been false many have come with a uh you know they could with healing Ministries and and it would be false and some would come and they would point to themselves and we know if you do that then it's false and so many false prophets will arise and and you know say have not I done this and have not I done that but how do you know a true prophet and how do you know who to follow so brother brandom says it like this and we'll try to get somewhere maybe we'll tile this together if it make sense at some point he said that's the way it is of a man that's predestinated to eternal life when he sees the light of God there ain't enough organizations in the world to cluck him back into it can you say amen he said no why it's in his nature he might have been dieting with them a long time and eating their trash and socials but he comes to a place he's found something different so he knows it my sheep know my voice said Jesus and a stranger they'll not follow that might they might be following something strange but down in them there's something different let them hear the truth one time and watch them all the father has given me will come so you didn't come to the message by chance you didn't come and be and sit under this headship by chance you didn't come to the message just because your parents were in the message you say well that's what introduced me to the message well many people introduce you to the message that may fall themselves and so what that that doesn't really have anything to do with it God knew you needed this message and he knew you were predestinated for a Time such as this so so if you're sheep this afternoon and you've heard the sound of the shepherd then you can't follow another Shepherd you've heard the voice for your day and you cannot follow a strange voice can you say amen amen so I've seen I I I believe I saw this somewhere and I'm not even sure if I could find it now but there was a some people calling the sheep and they couldn't figure out the Sheep wouldn't ever respond it wouldn't come to them and the Shepherd that was over that flock went out there and called the sheep and and they just come running to him why it's some something on the inside of them that could recognize a voice for their day so we might we might hear all kinds of voices and and many of them could be close but there's nothing on the inside to respond to that voice so we know what's leading us is not what we want to follow but what is on the inside of us that is following the word for the hour and so what you'll find out today is you can't help but follow this message if there's predestination on the inside you can't help but see it because it wasn't your opinion that wanted to follow this message or your opinion of the message being right but something on the inside of you your friends can't talk you out of it Church can't talk you out of it a website can't talk you out of it we're following it because of something on the inside that is following something on the outside and it's a spiritual voice it's a it's a supernatural connection and there's no way for us to deny what is on the inside of us why because the seed is responding to the light of the hour if you plant a seed and the seed starts to grow and if if that seed you you you find out if Grass Grows and and the and the Sun Shines on it amen it'll it'll grow but then it needs the water and the water and the sun together you'll see the the water and the and the the the blood and the spirit and all these things we have to have together but if you take it from a natural thing and me if an acorn falls into the ground there's a seed of an oak tree there and it will grow why because it was it was already an oak tree amen it will become something that it was predestinated to become amen aren't you thankful for the message of predestination I'm thankful tonight that I don't have to depend on my goodness to know this message and I don't have to depend on my my family history or whether I could be in it or not or I don't have to worry about this flesh getting away why because though the devil would try to make me stumble and though the devil would try to make me fall I can't deny the message because I am the message of the hour the message is on the inside of me and it is living out through me is that okay so far today amen a stranger they will not follow brother brand would would actually quote John here he said John said Brethren there's one thing that I'm thoroughly convinced in we can tell the world from today that we're not following some kind of a quack well can you say man we're not following some false prophet some puffed up something that knows nothing but we're following God can you say man we're not following some false prophet listen this is a prophet that was so thoroughly Vindicated that even science had to say he was Vindicated and we think back and I just want to deal with this for a minute think think about intellectual faith for a moment and people say well I believe the Bible but I can't believe in a prophet and then we have more proof that this Prophet existed and we have more proof that his message is correct we have more proof of the pillar of fire being with him where was the cameras when Moses saw the burning bush come on so when you start saying well we don't have any proof of it I like to say today we do we do have proof of this message I don't need proof because I'd follow it anyway but we do have proof that God came in our day you say well I I can't believe that well then you can't believe the Bible either because it takes Faith to believe this am me it takes something on the inside of you people say well I I can believe Moses because it's written in the word what about a prophet that was that was foretold to restore all things well can you say am man tonight what about a prophet that was coming our day with a light that would follow his ministry just like Moses and just like John and he would ju and just like Paul amen and in our day we would actually be we we would be so blessed to be able to see it and hang it in the in the halls of Congress why we could because God saw fit to prove himself to this generation yes there's not going to be everybody following because not everybody's got a seed on the inside of them but if the seed is there and they've seen that God has been manifested today then they cannot turn away from it right is that okay today brother BR talks about that duck that was born in a chicken pin hey man he said that duck was he said he was a funny little fellow to them chickens kind of topheavy had a big Bill and he said you know that being he was topheavy had that bill for some purpose and he said that's the way I guess sometimes the Christians seems to be a little bit he said they're a little fanatically but he said that's there for a purpose see you know why I message people sometimes tend to be a little fanatical because there had to be something to accept a very Supernatural message that was coming on I hope that's okay today I know I know a lot of them went overboard and I know there's a lot of crazies around the message there's a lot of crazies in the Baptist Church too there's a lot of crazy people everywhere but you'll find there are there are certain uh there's a certain bunch of people in the message that you know there some of them are just crazy you know we were I hear I go off on one of my little tangents but we grew up around people where we we saw the pillar of fire more every day than anybody we saw the pill fire four five six times every morning and then throughout the afternoon and every time the AC unit would kick on we saw the pillar of fire and I'm not making fun of the pillar of fire I'm just saying we were we were we were crazy I mean and and and I got old enough to get away and I did but but you know what I'm saying is you know there's all kinds of impersonations there's all kinds of Fanatics that like to get right around the message just to try to try to prove it wrong and so what they're doing with their with their nonsense is actually bring bringing a uh they're bringing a bad light to the message and they're actually bringing a a reproach on the message well can you say amen and so what they're doing is they're they're they're over here and they go off on some limb of fanaticism and listen that's going to be around this thing that don't be looking at the Fanatics they're going to be here am mean that they're there for a purpose because there's going to be Believers make Believers and unbelievers and and I'll tell you what if you're at home alone then you might be all three because your flesh ain't converted yet but let me goe and tell you something God rich in Mercy saw fit to send a message in spite of the fanaticism in spite of the crazies that would come along and yes there's going to be all kinds of nonsense around the message why because it attracts all kinds but there will be a bride that will stay with the word and will follow thus sayth the Lord why because she has something on the inside of her that can't follow nothing else amen right so let's go on down here brother bam said that's the way with a Christian when he's born again see he comes out of a different egg that's all yeah we're just a little odd brother Bill nobody's ever accused me of being normal and I guess that's okay hey man I'm an oddball I you know we're just a little you know if you get rid of all the nuts what the what brother R say then all you got left is a bunch of yunk you know you just nothing you just you're just if without the oddballs where would we be somebody say praise the Lord for the oddballs thank you and he said he said many of them out here in these denominational churches that's genuine Ducks but they got a h leader well there's a bad place to be he said they got a hen leader that's right so they just don't get it that sounds rude he said but I don't mean it that way but he's trying to make a point now I'm getting somewhere I think but we'll get there eventually he said uh he said I'm trying to make a point he said one day she let him out a little too far behind the barn and there was some water running down behind the barn and he said a spring going out a creek and he he was going along there wondering what it's all about you know following the hint along and why he didn't even like the diet they were eating but he said it didn't look right to him and these old things that they they did it didn't seem right so after a while he happened to catch a breath and that smelled just right he said where did that come from oh that little Breath of Heaven he said catch that little breath of something that's refreshing a sermon that appeals to you that strikes down inside of you and feel the word anchor itself what can you say man he said Heavenly Sunshine he thought oh there's somehow another he said there's somehow another that breath that that I got fits my nature and he breathed it again and he said it's somewhere now you can't tell me it's somewhere I know there's something somewhere that I belong to not to this Creed see and he said you know what I mean he smelt water and his nature was a duck so a duck and the water just goes together and so when you heard this message you that that just smelled like water to you and you were a duck and you just had to be in the water I would just like to go ahead well I might be crazy it's okay but let me go aad and tell you something when I when I heard the voice of God for my day I didn't hear the voice of brother Brandon but I actually heard God speaking to my soul and something responded to the voice amen I can't help but believe it I've told you nobody can talk me out of it because nobody talked me into it and if if somebody could talk you out of this message I'm sorry to say maybe there's nothing on the inside of you and I I listen I don't I don't give up on nobody but I think we need to be careful what voices we're listening to but but if you're if you're elect you can't be deceived if you're elect there's nothing can take you out if you're elect you can fall down I love how brother Josh Bennett said it you can fall down but you can't fall away come on somebody amen this message excites the bride because we are part of this message amen it's not something a preacher preaches it's not something we just hear but it is part of us we are the message of the hour we are the message so the duck smelled water and he said he just couldn't help but go to the water and directly he got that other big whiff and he said it become a little more strong and after a while the wind began to blow like the rushing Mighty Wind you know and it began to blow the breeze right off the water to him and he couldn't stand it no longer down over the hill he went wobble wobble wobble he said you know he was going Hong Kon conon I wonder if there's not a little bit of noise around the Ducks when they find the water and he said that little Bill sticking up in the air he said he smelt water and the old hen said you fanatic get back here no good at all he done smelt the water and somebody already told you the message was fanatical and the message was wrong but you've already heard a voice and I'm so glad I heard the voice I I heard the song it said it sounded like a scriptural voice to me and it is and mean it is more than just the voice of a man but it was the voice of God to you that would accept it as such is that okay he said their Presbyterian Baptists and Pentecostals and so forth oh brother he said that's miserable a real Christian wants to get the freshness of the spirit the freshness of God in his life something that makes him a new creation and as soon as he can get to that outlet he'll drive over snowy grounds or anything else to get to it he said because he's a duck to begin with you know you wonder why in message churches you go to about any of them and you'll find people drive a long ways to get there that's right and I'm not saying any certain Church you should go to or shouldn't I'm just saying some people drive a long ways to get to church and when you see that you know they're they're doing that because I I I remember when I was driving from Hot Springs it was a little over three hours maybe three and a half hours and people would say well is there not a church good enough in hot springs for you you know and and the truth of it is you don't want to say no but the truth of it is when you when when you when you hear the word of God being preached and there's no ego about it that really is refreshing to the bride amen because it's not about me it's not about brother Stewart it's not about brother Ben it's not about this church it's about the whole body and we believe we want to see Souls saved we want to see this church grow we want to see this church more than just grow in numbers but grow in individuals we want to see the individuals become powerhouses as brother Brandon would call them amen that's that's a desire of ours and to see our young people become a mighty Army in this message but that is not the main thing the main thing is to strengthen the entire body why because there's no egos here amen it is all about the message of the hour right and so you'll see people that'll that they'll they they'll sacrifice a lot to get to church because you know maybe there's not jobs and and it's hard you know I mean it's just not easy sometimes being in the message because that's just the truth of it the fact is we're not on a picnic and we're in a Battleground and and sometimes the devil likes to fight Us in every way he can whether it's finances and whether it's sickness or you notice how the devil really makes people more sick on Sundays and he loves to fight you on Sundays and you know we had two Sundays in a row where there was snow on the ground on Sunday I tell you what the devil just loves to come on the weekend you know he's a weekend visitor and so he shows up and and he's always trying to affect a service and you know if you ever have some fault with somebody it seems like it it just happens just to be before a service or sometimes Before You Preach there's always something that somebody will rile you up about something or sometimes before you Y come on somebody maybe it's just me you know but sometimes if the devil's going to fight you he's going to do it he's going to try to affect you and then affect the whole church well come on somebody but let's focus on the word because it's true no matter how I feel it's true on my good days and it's true on my bad days it's true when I'm right and it's true when I'm wrong but it's true anyway it's all about God and this word is that okay tonight amen I believe that we need to start focusing on the main thing and keep the main thing the main thing amen amen the main thing is not me the main thing is not the pastor the main thing is him and if he's the main thing and and if he is the center of all things and I say we need to worship him when we come to the house of God and we need to realize that he is leading us and mean the Pastor might be your your local leader but ultimately he's under the leadership of the Holy Ghost and and he can only lead you as he follows Christ and I can only preach to you as I've been led to preach by by God himself listen church this is not about a man Amen brother brandham didn't come and preach his own message but he came and preached the message so that you could follow him as he followed the word why because he preached what Paul preached and he preached only what a prophet would preach anden it was the truth all the way through listen we can get all tied up about some little opinion or some little idea or we say a prophet had a personal preference on something amen you say well I don't like cherry pie well that ain't going to keep you out of the Rapture amen just because he drove a Ford doesn't mean you can't drive a Chevy but what I'm going to tell you tonight is the word was important that he brought amen then the word is still true that he brought it did not die in 1965 with a prophet but the word was always here and the word will always be here amen it was the in the beginning the Word was God and the Word was with God amen and then he became flesh and dwelt among us and then when he left he sent his spirit so that we could become the word of this hour I want to go ahead and tell you something I'm not following just another Creed but I'm following a Vindicated word that has been that that came to me and when I heard it on the inside of me I smelled the water I went running to the water I'm going to tell you tonight church I might be crazy here but I want to go and tell you something if God before me who can be against me I might be crazy but the world can call me that but in in heaven I've got a home prepared amen where the Saints abide and that's where I'm going that's where I'm going amen they might call our sisters oldfashioned they might call our brothers fanatics but I want to tell you something amen they can call you whatever they want to I've said it before I'll say it again when they call you on that one day when you're gone they're going to have to call you gone why because you're leaving in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that is the word that has been revealed to you and man we're not looking we're not looking for a new word we're not looking for a new Prophet well can you say Amen but we've already heard the voice of God and that was not William brandom's physical voice but it was God using a man and his voice to speak directly to the bride and call out a bride is that okay and I'm running out of time so let me get down here and try to get to where I'm going brother Brandon would go on down like this he said now God chose in the days of Exodus Amen in the days of Exodus he called out a group and out of that group he said I want you to notice something he only got two that went to the promised land what did he choose to take them out by politics organization he chose a prophet with a supernatural sign of a pillar of fire I want you to follow me closely here if you can amen and I and I won't hold you long I I really am being honestly serious about that and and if I lie to you forgive me and he said he chose a prophet with a supernatural sign of a pillar of fire that the people wouldn't be mistaken was the pillar of fire important for us to see yes so we wouldn't be mistaken about who our leader would be in this hour now I know some people don't like to say brother brandom's our leader Jezebel didn't like to say that she had a pastor either and I know people have taken that and went so far the other way and brother brandom's their pastor and they don't need a local Pastor I get all the nonsense listen fanaticism fanaticism and we do have local pastors and we we believe in a local Shepherd but we also know who came and who was the ultimate in our generation amen is that okay he chose a prophet with a supernatural sign of a pillar of fire that the people wouldn't be mistaken he said what the prophet said was the truth you can tell me all the mistakes you want to but a prophet came and said what the prophet said was the truth amen and so in the first Exodus that's how God showed his people who Moses was although the people didn't see the burning bush Moses comes in there with no photographic evidence of his experience he comes in there and he has no video of discernment happening he comes in there listen come come on somebody you know that it would be hard it it we got people can't follow the message now with all the Vindication and the signs and the tapes and the video and everything and you know so unbelievers are unbelievers sir but can you imagine these people you know they knew that God was going to send a deliver and they had been there for hundreds of years and and and all this time they're waiting on somebody then Moses shows up and and then he kills a man and flees out into the desert and he's gone for 40 years and so you know look at look at the hope that you would have in this he comes back as an 80-year-old man saying that he saw a bush and this bush spoke to him you talk about Fanatics come on somebody y'all like well brother Joel you going to say anything interesting today probably not so he had a second Exodus how many knows there's a Third Exodus that we're living in brother bam taught that there would be a Third Exodus he's called it and he goes on and he talks about he says he says God always is perfect in threes he said you all notice he said it's always Threes And Sevens he said seven is completion and threes is perfection first second third PLL and he said everything justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost everything he said what did he do the first Exodus he sent a prophet Anointed with a pillar of fire and he called the people out that was his first Exodus and when Israel's time was up he sent again a prophet a god Prophet with a pillar of fire John saw it descending from heaven like a dove and he said I go to God I return to God and after his death burial and Resurrection Saul of Tarsus on his road down to Damascus saw that same Pillar of Fire and him being a Hebrew well taught in the word said well Lord who are you and he said he knew it was the Lord that the pillar of fire he he said he knew it was the Lord that Pillar of Fire he was a Hebrew said who are excuse me who are you and he said I am Jesus the second Exodus he brought a he brought a prophet anointed which was his son God Prophet Moses said he would be a prophet and had the pillar of fire and done signs and wonders and that same Prophet said that whosoever believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and here he promised in the same things in The Exodus in the last days he cannot change it and by scientific proof by the witness of the Spirit by The Works of the spirit we see it today the Great Pillar of Fire moving Among Us and the signs and wonders of the resurrection of Jesus Christ calling the people from a denominationalism into the presence of Jesus Christ are you still with me to live going into a land he said there's no mistake friends it's not what I'm saying I'm just your brother but it's what God is proving to you what makes it the truth same Pillar of Fire he used for the other two he's brought it among you today and proved it by scientific now brother random goes into some detail here and I'll try to go through it quickly and he said as you know Life Magazine packed it last month he said how many was here and he goes on down he said there it is they don't know what it's all about the scientists are trying anybody got a picture of it he said it's called a cloud 26 mil high in the shape of a pyramid seven angels represent there and brought it back and brought you to the word of God under the inspiration it tells you these hours that you're coming and living in the spiritual mind will pick that up right now see and get it it's an exodus we're going to leave one of these days thanks be to God and I want to say that that was the last sign that would come to the Gentile church and the last sign that would come anden so there was a cloud listen I know there's been all kinds of discrepancies and people that don't believe in the cloud but I'd like you to go ahead and say if you're going to make that argument about the cloud I want to say that same argument for every scripture in the Bible and I'm going to go ahead and say it like this why would God vindicate a lie that's right why would God vindicate a lie but he came in this generation and Vindicated a true message and if the word is true I'm going to follow the word and if the sign's in the heaven and and and listen that picture that was taken it's still there today you can still go see it in Washington DC it's still in the archives today of the pillar of fire over brother brandom's head I know people don't like the picture because they think it's of the man but what about the Halo that was over his head that's what I'm pointing you to that was the [Applause] Vindication the vind indication was not the man the man a man can't vindicate himself Brother David but you're Vindicated by God is that okay brother brandom said I got 10 minutes I got more than 10 minutes he said the pillar of fire that called them out LED in the promised land under the anointing of a prophet a pillar of fire that they could look at LED them to the promised land under an anointed prophet and they constantly turned him down he said is that right he said now I know he goes into wanting to quit again let me skip all that he said watch it we're in a calling out come out of Babylon my people said the Angel's voice out of what confusion people say the message people are confused I would like to go ahead and tell you we're the only people who ain't amen we're the only people that know that God sent a prophet that's right I asked a brother one time he was a UPC uh super uh district superintendent of uh of Arkansas and I asked him I said what is Malachi for and he still hadn't answered me that's been 10 years ago he could at least he didn't try to put it off on Malachi 3 right I mean he at least he knew better knew that it wasn't John the Baptist but he actually didn't know is what he told me he didn't know he said maybe it could be this and maybe this and it's possible over here and look at us we get to know because God showed it to us and I don't say those people aren't saved or won't make it amen but this is a bride time this is this is bride word this is bride food amen it tastes a little different than an Apostolic Church Church it tastes just a little different than than your Baptist and your Presbyterian and your Methodist churches amen it I'm not saying there's not Christians there Amen brother brandham said they that that duck was eating the diet of the hen amen there could be a duck in there too but let me go aad and tell you something this message will call out everyone that it's intended to call out and will'll be ready for a Rapture brother brandom said it will he said the Methodist ride or the Baptist or the Catholic right come out of he said God Is Right how do you know let every man's word be a lie and mine the truth out of it what do you know he said the same Pillar of Fire the same anointing Spirit leading to the promised land notice LED them brought them out LED them to the promised land he said Israel the nation and the same God the same Pillar of Fire he said they say well that that when you when you read George J Lacy not me he said you read where George la examine that picture the head of the FBI for his fingerprint documents there is his statement some of them says a double exposed lens tens of thousands of people have looked at it with their own eyes we stood here and looked at it you've looked at it and he said it it isn't said it was an optical illusion what did Mr Lacy say am me the mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology he said it wasn't no optical illusion it was there and he said it's the same Pillar of Fire and then they said oh well that was a that was an illusion the cameras and all and for hundreds of miles of Tucson see the same people that called that Pillar of Fire a false and an illusion amen they called that cloud an illusion he said now for hundreds of miles of Tucson 6 months before it ever happened we told you by the Holy Spirit he would be going there to pick up the news because he said the writing on the outside there was a brother that had a dream and I don't have time to go into all that but he said he said now all the mysteries of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost was done explained he said now picking up the Loose Ends of that which was concealed in the Seven Seals not the seven Church ages the Seven Seals reveal the Mysteries and he said he then opened this thing up and he said he found a rock in there and white but he had never been rode on and it was a mystery and he said go to Tucson for tell it before it happen stand there north of Tucson and Witnesses standing there standing here with it when a blast come that shook the mountains off the ground almost and he said the same time a circle of light hanging Yonder in the air when the science took the pictures now 26 miles high about five times the distance of fog or anything could be and they can't find what did it he said and I love this he said it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find if you're elected and he said that seed falls upon dry grounds or upon rocks and it'll never do nothing hard Stony hearts that wants to be indifferent he said but if it'll fall upon the soft mellow ground of Faith it'll bring forth a Christian bearing the fruits of the spirit I'm so glad he found me I'm so glad that he sent his word and called me in my condition right you okay so far amen amen God Amen God vindicate God Vindicated himself in a pillar of fire in our day and the fact that the devil has come in and cause doubt Among Us and caused us to start questioning what we're following I know who we're following it's not a man it is Christ himself and so we don't look at the mistakes of men is that okay I know I wanted to come out here and just preach fun tonight but I got to preach what's on my heart is that okay he said why don't you go tell them scientists about that he said don't cast your Pearls Before Swine Jesus said not to he said I have no leadings to do it yet living right in the city there where they was calling for I thought I'd go down and he said the holy spirit said stay away it's not for them go back and tell the Tabernacle all right I want you to just notice this and I I am running out of time brother Danny told me to quit worrying about time I need to listen to you buddy he said I I love how brother brandom said it wasn't for them go back and tell the Tabernacle there was a place where he would go and store up food so that and he even says this and I know this is all taken out of everything's taken out of context in somewhere in some place and somehow he said I'm I'm storing up food so that you'll have something to eat and I believe in this day we have to be careful not to get to the opinion or the idea that we don't need to hear the tapes anymore because I absolutely believe it's essential for a Believer to hear the voice that was stored up on tape not because it's William bram's voice but the words that he spoke amen and I I just want you to know I'm not a deity guy I don't I'm not making him Jesus Christ because he said if you make me Jesus Christ you make me Antichrist but I do believe that the word of the hour is Christ himself not the man but the message and so I just go ahead and say it again today listen the devil's going to come after this message the devil didn't come after the man but the devil's coming after the message the devil don't want you to hear this message and so he'll put a seed of doubt in your mind amen that doesn't make you an believer but you need to cast down the doubts that are coming and feed on the body word of the son of man that has been revealed in your generation it's important it's imperative it's essential if there's ever been something you need to do anden you say well I hear a preacher three times a week I don't need the tapes anymore that's a mistake yes sir I hope this is okay Ben can come back and fix it all in way but I do believe that with all my heart that when you see a home that never plays the tapes and you see a home that has you know they just don't place any importance on that what you'll see is is that home begins to get cold and you won't see the young people grow up in Revival but what you'll see is a a dying and then the next thing you know people start talking them out of it well they never heard it how is this how's the how's the light ever going to strike the seed if you never see the light and so we go on down here and if that was a good preacher turn him up he said go back and tell the Tabernacle all right he said it shall come to pass if what that says comes to pass he said remember I have spoken the Lord says see before it happens see brother B goes on down here and he deal with this Third Exodus and I believe that's where we're at now he said here they are on the Third Exodus same sign same manifestation same Christ same Holy Ghost come on somebody he is the same in every detail but the Corporal body same Christ same Holy Ghost same work same God same message they can't take it they they just can't take it it's if they would if they would have known the scriptures shouldn't they have known that this Prophet was to come but they missed when Christ came the first time because they held on to to some kind of a Creed or a Dogma instead of recognizing the word of the hour that was the word made flesh for them and they missed it and today the word has been made manifest before your eyes you can't miss it if you're the elected amen there was people in Jesus's day that would catch that why because the light was walking around everywhere and those that would recognize the word that was among them would be blessed by that word and receive it and the next thing you know then when he went away I I I just love the fact that when he left Earth and he comes back in the spirit and me and Paul meets him as Saul on the road and he and he meets him there and he said I'm the one that you're persecuting I'm the one and he was what was he doing he was killing Christians but they were a part oh come on somebody they were a part of God's economy I'm the one you're persecuting I am Jesus Christ I am the word and then Paul would take the I loved what brother Stuart said this morning amen they all voted and they cast lots to to pick Mias and and they wanted to go a different route but would you notice something amen God had a man that was predestinate predestinated for the moment and predestinated for the time and he was a man that would be bold and without fear and would take the message for the church first church age amen and he didn't care what they thought of him and and and listen Church you you've got to be bold why because God has given you a word that's not going to be accepted by the masses but it's true anyway is that okay it's either it's either all of God or it's all wrong and if this message is wrong you better check your scriptures too right come on somebody I know when people leave the message they don't they don't like to hear that right but you know the truth of it is you know well if there's anything in them ones that have left they'll be back right if there's anything in them they'll be back don't be shaken by unbelief he said here they are same message same everything they had knowledge of the truth they looked and seen that it's absolutely the truth they can't deny it the magazines has test has to testify they've seen it the pictures the papers the evidence the resurrection of the Dead the doctor statements of the sick they have to say that it's him and the predictions not one of them have ever failing down through the years every one of them just exactly on the dot they can't say but what it's God but they can't accept it now brother Brandon would deal with this if I can find my spot again there brother Brandon would actually deal with this and he would you know the the Pentecostals would follow him through the signs and follow him with the Miracles and and followed him all the way up and man when it come to the opening of the word they couldn't accept it what was it they enjoyed the feeling of it they enjoyed the the healings that it brought amen but there was not anything on the inside of them to be attracted to the word I would say what is your attraction today it is Christ the word to the bride amen a feel-good emotion ain't going to be good enough for you but it is the word itself that has been recognized by something on the inside of you and you can't help but follow the light of the hour Amen brother brother brandom said the wise men still seek Him amen amen we're following the light and where the light is there's the body word under the light I would say tonight amen that the light has come and has showed us the word of the hour and we We've Come Just in Time listen Brother David you could have been in any generation but you were chosen for this time because God put something on the inside of you so that you could believe this end time message listen God wouldn't send a message if there wasn't somebody here to receive it we may not be the biggest group amen but there's more with us than be with them I've got God on my side no devil in hell can come against us and win why because we are more than enough with the word in our hearts amen the pillar of fire leading the way amen I'm so glad he found me I'm so glad that I know who I'm following what is leading me it is Christ the word nothing can move me none of these things move me amen we read that a couple weeks ago there's not going to be anything that can take me away amen from this message why because none of them things amen all the doubters can fall if they want to but that's not going to shake me amen nothing can shake a supernatural faith in a Vindicated message yes sir and so I like that in in that scripture we read he said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him yes so I would pose the question tonight not to minister questions but I believe we have the answer sir if we know who we're following today is he God come on somebody is it God I know Gabe and Millie's not here here tonight she wasn't supposed to have that baby but she's going to have that baby tomorrow you say the signs don't follow the Believers I say they still do yes sir why because God's still God and he changes not that's not a Vindication of anything except that God is still more than enough for his people amen every devil can come against you but God is still God Amen listen church I I know this has cut up and this has went all over the place tonight but let me just go ahead and tell you something we need to recognize that we are not defeated amen we know who we're following am many are going to fall away and die in the wilderness but we're following amen we're like Joshua amen he would that is the holy spirit today brother brandom said and we're following our Joshua and Caleb said give me that mountain anden the faith that we have now is more than just a faith in an intellectual gospel but it is a supernatural faith in a Vindicated message amen I say give me that mountain give me my children give me my healing well come on somebody I say give me the desires of my heart speak and go forward why because everywhere that The Souls of your feet are going to step is your possession I say keep following a message and that message is going to lead you to a Promised Land amen I believe that we're in the land of promise now where all the promises lay it's the message of the hour and I believe we've been LED here by the pillar of fire and the word is true listen the messenger might be gone but the message is still alive come on somebody and if you go by way of the Grave let your just hold that Faith up until the end that your children are going to follow this light listen Church give me that mountain it's my faith it's my message it's who I am I'm part of it I can't stay on the other side of Jordan I'm going all the way give me my mountain tonight because I know what is leading me and I know what is leading me is not going to lead me to be destroyed by Giants but what is leading me is leading me to a land of promise that is Flowing with milk and honey and what is leading me is leading me into a place where all the promises lay what is leading me today into the word of the hour is showing me that the Mysteries have been revealed amen I I just wish we could stay here for a minute but my time's up amen we are being led by something more than just a preacher well come on somebody we're being led by something more than a personality something more than just a healing evangelist but we are being led by the message that God sent himself in this generation amen it is to call you out and it is to set you aside and it is to get you prepared for a Rapture amen if anybody needs a Rapture I say the bride does because we're getting tired of being here where the devil has taken up presidence but we're going to get out of here one of these days and brother brandham said I believe that and he said Believers believe listen we're going to go see the one that we're fighting for and we're talking about and we're believing in this is not just another message but it is the last message to the last Church to get ready for a Rapture I hope you're with me tonight so far anden I'm just about done but I want you to know what when the light of God he said when you see the light of God there ain't enough organizations in the world to take it out of you listen I want to go ahead and tell you tonight if it's in you the devil can't take it out of you if you've been called to this message the devil can't make you turn aside this message I know there's going to be naysayers I know there's going to be those fall away but I can't be shaken I can't be moved I'm standing on the Rock of Ages and my faith has never been stronger in the message of the hour why I look in the mirror and I see a man with faults and failures but I'm not looking at the man's faults and the failures but I'm looking at a promised word that has coming this generation he is leading me amen and if he's leading me I can't lose that's right where he leads me I will follow my sheep know my voice amen we're following god brother brandom said and hey man musicians go ahead and come he said we're different we're oddballs there was only two went in but he tells us that a type of Caleb is the bride and Caleb heard all about how the Giants were too big and Caleb CB heard all the doubters but Caleb's Faith wasn't shaken Caleb would go over there and say give me that mountain and if you know what's leading you when you need that faith brother Bill that faith will rise up and say give me that mountain when the de when the doctors try to tell you that your lungs are so far gone that they're not going to get any better you say give me my healing why because the same God that got you 85 86 years is the same God that's going to carry you all the way home amen he's still God well come on somebody he's God and he changes not and you might as well go ahead and if the doctor gave you a bad report just go ahead and tell the doctor my healing doesn't lay in a doctor's report but my healing comes from the word that I follow give me my healing give me my Mountain give me my Deliverance if if if one of you today are fighting a devil on you and you need deliverance from it go ahead and just tell that devil you can't hold me God has given me the Deliverance well come on somebody listen church you've left the devil hold you long enough we're in the land of promise the Giants are Fallen give me that mountain today and let's stand under our feet I think that's what the bride needs to do quit letting that devil tell you you can't take the land you're in the land quit letting that devil tell you you can't cross over you've already crossed over to that land brother Bill you right now are in the land of promise Brother David we're in the land of promise amen there's nothing nothing there's no giant the Giants are scary sometimes but they can't stop us from our inheritance is that okay tonight amen how many how many need something from the Lord tonight I know I do I wonder if we couldn't just tell that devil to go back where he come from and say Lord I'm in the land of promise give me my Mountain here tonight whatever that mountain is give it back why because it's your possession it's your possession if you want to play something there I wonder if you have a need on your heart tonight just bow your heads right where you're at and just tell the Lord Lord I've left the devil keep me out of my promises long enough when you recognize what you're following and who's leading you you'll find out that you've been LED right to your promised land in the season in the season of blessings I believe it's the Bride season to be blessed I believe it's a bride season to go ahead and say give me my mountain because I know who's leading [Music] me what did he choose to take them to the promis land by was it politics or another Voice or organization he said no he chose a prophet with a supernatural sign of a pillar of fire that the people wouldn't be mistaken I'm so glad we're not mistaken of what we're following today but we're following Jesus we're following this message that is the word for our day am mean it's not outside the Bible this this is just the opening of that Bible to us aren't you glad about it just pray right there in your own way if you need to come to the altar you can amen I tonight I just wonder if we could just say Lord raise my faith to know what I'm following I'm following a message that that nobody can talk me out [Music] of I'm following a message that somebody else might try to say there's a better way there's a better message well brother Brandon didn't mean this or he didn't mean that
