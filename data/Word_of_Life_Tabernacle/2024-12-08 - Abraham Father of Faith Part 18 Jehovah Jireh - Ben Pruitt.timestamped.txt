[52:56] God bless you this
[52:58] [Music]
[52:59] morning we're going to uh go to Genesis
[53:03] chapter 22 and verse 14 we'll just read
[53:06] the one verse this morning I hope you're
[53:09] not tired of Abraham we're almost almost
[53:12] done but we just now got into the good
[53:14] part so Genesis chapter 2 and verse
[53:19] 14 we're going to speak this morning on
[53:22] Jehovah
[53:24] Gyra says and Abraham called the name of
[53:28] that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to
[53:33] this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[53:35] shall be seen Jehovah Gyra means the
[53:37] Lord sees or the Lord provides I pray
[53:40] the Lord would add his Blessing to the
[53:42] word you may be
[53:45] [Music]
[53:46] seated as we followed Abraham's life
[53:50] through his journey his entire life has
[53:52] been marked by God asking him to believe
[53:56] in impossible things and then act on
[54:00] that belief yeah so it wasn't just that
[54:03] Abraham said okay Lord I believe I agree
[54:05] with you this is true but Abraham had to
[54:08] act on what he actually believed and so
[54:14] there's a in the scriptures there's
[54:15] almost a tension presented between Paul
[54:18] and James in the New Testament on how
[54:21] Abraham was justified but they're both
[54:23] saying the same thing it's just two
[54:25] different sides of it Paul says in
[54:28] Romans 4:1 what shall we say then that
[54:31] Abraham our father if pertain to the
[54:32] flesh has found If Abraham were
[54:35] justified by works he hath where of the
[54:37] glory but not before God for what sayith
[54:39] the scripture Abraham believed God and
[54:41] it was counted unto him for
[54:43] righteousness so Paul's saying Abraham
[54:46] is not justified by his works or by his
[54:49] effort but by his faith but then James
[54:52] in James 2 20 says but wilt thou know oh
[54:56] vain man that faith without works is
[55:00] dead faith without works is dead he said
[55:04] was not Abraham Our Father justified by
[55:07] works
[55:08] yeah when he had offered Isaac his son
[55:11] upon the altar he said see us thou how
[55:14] Faith wrought with his works and by
[55:16] works was Faith made perfect and the
[55:20] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[55:22] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[55:24] unto him for righteousness and he was
[55:27] called the friend of God they're both
[55:28] using the same scripture and and it's
[55:31] not a contradiction what they're doing
[55:33] is looking at two different sides of it
[55:35] the brandom said the two men were
[55:36] talking on faith he said Paul Justified
[55:39] Abraham by what God saw in Abraham but
[55:42] James Justified Abraham by what man saw
[55:45] in Abraham so he said see Abraham
[55:49] believed God that's what God saw in him
[55:51] he believed it but then when he went to
[55:53] acting now come on Church there's a
[55:55] difference in saying you believe it and
[55:58] then acting on it and that's where we
[56:00] want to move to we want to move beyond
[56:01] the spot of just saying well I'm a
[56:03] Believer and to the point where Lord
[56:05] because I believe this is what I'm going
[56:07] to do so he said he went to acting as
[56:10] though it was already done amen he said
[56:13] that's what man saw in him so what man
[56:17] saw was Abraham going to the store and
[56:20] buying diapers for a baby that when he
[56:23] was oh my when he was a hundred years
[56:25] old know right that's what man saw
[56:27] that's works but what was the works a
[56:29] result of it wasn't because Abraham just
[56:31] decided to do that it wasn't because
[56:33] Abraham just made that up and and
[56:35] decided Well I'm going to I'm going to
[56:37] go do this no because God said so and
[56:39] Abraham believed God and that belief
[56:42] resulted in Works in his life so Abraham
[56:46] was expressing he said he said that's
[56:49] the same as this T our works Express
[56:51] what faith we have but if we're afraid
[56:53] to act on what we believe we do not
[56:54] believe it he said you've got to believe
[56:56] it Abraham's Works was expressing his
[56:59] faith he had in God's promise so man saw
[57:03] what Abraham did but God sees the motive
[57:06] God sees his faith God sees his belief
[57:09] and so God counted Works to Abraham
[57:13] before he had ever done the works
[57:15] because he was a
[57:17] Believer right so it wasn't just that he
[57:19] The Works were there they had to be
[57:21] there but it wasn't that God withheld
[57:23] his favor from Abraham until the work
[57:26] came but God said I've called you
[57:28] Abraham listen to me Church you need to
[57:30] recognize that today you say well I
[57:32] haven't done everything yet just you're
[57:33] just right and I'm not I'm not walked
[57:35] this road very long but God is not
[57:37] justifying you by what you've done he's
[57:40] justifying you by what he sees you will
[57:42] do how you respond to what to the faith
[57:45] that's in you he is justified by faith
[57:48] so God counts it already done amen he
[57:51] counts listen to me Church you realize
[57:53] God sees you already raptured he sees
[57:55] you already in a new body he sees you
[57:57] already in a perfect place he already
[58:00] sees that but what's he doing in your
[58:02] life men don't see that but what we see
[58:04] is the results of that the results of
[58:07] God's favor the results of God saying I
[58:10] know this is the person that's going to
[58:12] do it because that's who I've chosen to
[58:14] do
[58:15] it so here's a man acting as if God is
[58:19] going to keep his word oh that's a
[58:21] wonderful thing what would it do for us
[58:23] if we would act as if God was a Healer
[58:26] act as if God was a savior act as if he
[58:29] as if he keeps his word that's what
[58:31] Abraham was doing it was Faith expressed
[58:34] in Works see said it had been revealed
[58:37] to him so he believed it so and was
[58:39] acting as though it had already took
[58:41] place yeah that's pretty good isn't
[58:44] it in Genesis 22 And1 so we now we moved
[58:49] past the point and and if you find
[58:51] Abraham he's he's act he's asked to
[58:54] believe uh a series of things that are
[58:58] keep getting more and more difficult
[59:00] yeah until finally he's asked to believe
[59:03] that he's going to have a baby at 100
[59:04] years of age and he believes it and he
[59:07] receives a visitation from the angel and
[59:10] his body change but now we fast forward
[59:14] about 16 years 13 to 16 years later and
[59:18] we find out that God is going to do
[59:20] something to Abraham he's going to test
[59:24] him a little bit more right he's already
[59:26] passed the test but God's going to test
[59:28] him a little bit more it says it came to
[59:30] pass after these things that God did
[59:33] tempt Abraham that word tempt is test
[59:35] it's not tempt in the sense of trying to
[59:37] tempt to do wrong but it's to test
[59:40] Abraham the word is to test to put to
[59:42] the test in order to ascertain the
[59:44] nature of something including
[59:47] imperfections faults or other qualities
[59:50] so he's going to put it to test the way
[59:52] you would put gold to the test you don't
[59:54] put it to the test to prove that it's
[59:56] not gold you put it to the test to prove
[59:59] that it is gold right you don't put it
[1:00:02] to the test to prove listen when they go
[1:00:03] to test a truck uh like a an F-150 or
[1:00:07] whatever it is that you drive if they
[1:00:08] went to test a new truck they don't put
[1:00:10] that thing through what they put it
[1:00:12] through to to show you that it can't do
[1:00:14] it but they put it through those trials
[1:00:16] and those tests to show what it can do
[1:00:19] what it can endure that's what God is
[1:00:21] doing with Abraham he's showing him what
[1:00:23] he can endure oh Church many times in
[1:00:25] our life we look at test that's
[1:00:27] punishment it's not punishment at all
[1:00:29] it's actually rewards for faith God is
[1:00:32] bringing us to a place where I know
[1:00:34] Abraham can handle this I know he can
[1:00:37] handle it or I wouldn't put him through
[1:00:38] it in the first
[1:00:40] place so it's a it's a test of his of
[1:00:44] the qualities that's in him yes and God
[1:00:46] said I know Abraham remember a couple
[1:00:49] weeks ago he said I know him I know
[1:00:51] he'll command his family I know him I I
[1:00:54] predestined him I've elected him and so
[1:00:56] I know how he'll respond in the moment
[1:00:58] when he's put to the extreme test I know
[1:01:01] what he'll do oh I say God can have that
[1:01:03] kind of confidence in us this morning he
[1:01:05] can look at you and say I know he can
[1:01:06] endure the test whatever you're going
[1:01:08] through right now God said you can make
[1:01:09] it through it you're going to be able to
[1:01:11] make it because what because he had
[1:01:13] faith enough in you to put you through
[1:01:15] the
[1:01:16] test so he's testing
[1:01:19] Abraham and he's he's trying him and
[1:01:23] this would be his greatest test but
[1:01:26] would also be his greatest
[1:01:28] Victory brother Bram said Abraham had a
[1:01:31] V Day a victory day yeah when was it the
[1:01:34] day that he left the land of the shinar
[1:01:35] Plains he said not exactly remember that
[1:01:38] was a great test to God have God speak
[1:01:41] to him and say leave and he left yes
[1:01:44] right it was a great test he crossed
[1:01:46] over the Euphrates and come on this
[1:01:47] other side that was a good day but his
[1:01:50] main vday was up on Mount Gyra when he
[1:01:54] got up there that day when God give him
[1:01:56] the final
[1:01:58] test the final test when he had his only
[1:02:03] son he said now Abraham take him up
[1:02:06] there to that mountain and offer him up
[1:02:09] for a sacrifice see the final test is a
[1:02:12] test of willingness whether he or not he
[1:02:15] will actually take his understanding of
[1:02:19] how the promise works and and surrender
[1:02:22] that to the work there you go right his
[1:02:25] understand and that that works for all
[1:02:27] of us listen we've got to take our
[1:02:29] understanding of the way things are
[1:02:31] going to go our understanding of our
[1:02:34] future our understanding of our life
[1:02:36] come on young people you got a certain
[1:02:38] thing you you expect out of life and I'm
[1:02:40] going to marry this one I'm marry that
[1:02:42] one or I'm going to get this job I'm
[1:02:44] going to do things this way and the
[1:02:45] final test though of your faith is God
[1:02:48] saying I'm going to make you surrender
[1:02:50] that all to me
[1:02:52] yeah and I'm going to put you in a place
[1:02:54] where you don't have a clue how it's
[1:02:56] ever going to come out right and see if
[1:02:57] you'll obey my word and believe my word
[1:03:00] during that time and during that moment
[1:03:03] when it seems like there's no way it
[1:03:04] could work out are you still going to
[1:03:06] say yes Lord I'm going to follow the
[1:03:08] word I'm going to do what God Said even
[1:03:10] oh church that's the way we have to be
[1:03:12] this morning no matter what the
[1:03:14] circumstances say even if the word
[1:03:16] itself seems to be against me I'm going
[1:03:18] to say nevertheless Lord I believe your
[1:03:22] word come
[1:03:24] on good he's going to test all of
[1:03:27] Abraham's children the way he tests
[1:03:29] Abraham now he'll never ask you to offer
[1:03:31] up one of your children thank the Lord
[1:03:34] CU we'd be trying to choose which one to
[1:03:35] offer up wouldn't
[1:03:40] we that's terrible the one you thought
[1:03:42] of right there that's terrible you
[1:03:47] know but that's not what God's doing but
[1:03:49] the BR said that was a type in his
[1:03:51] shadow yeah what does he want he wants a
[1:03:54] sacrifice of us yeah right right we got
[1:03:57] to die to
[1:03:58] ourselves now look he said Abraham take
[1:04:02] him up on the Mountain offer him up for
[1:04:04] a sacrifice I've made you a father of
[1:04:06] Nations here is the only thing that
[1:04:09] you've got to make you father of Nations
[1:04:12] is through this son yes sir so in
[1:04:14] Abraham's understanding the only way the
[1:04:17] promise could ever be fulfilled was
[1:04:19] through Isaac he said I want you to kill
[1:04:23] him oh you see it destroy everything
[1:04:27] destroy the very
[1:04:30] purpose see a lot of times the dreams
[1:04:32] and the plans that you have for Life
[1:04:34] you've got plans and you've got dreams
[1:04:36] and sometimes God makes you go through
[1:04:38] some things that causes you even to not
[1:04:41] even be able to understand how that's
[1:04:42] ever going to work out and it's not that
[1:04:44] he wants to destroy your dream but he
[1:04:46] wants you to realize that it's not you
[1:04:48] that did it but it's him that did it and
[1:04:51] if oh church if God gave you the dream
[1:04:53] God's able to get you to the place where
[1:04:56] it can be
[1:04:57] fulfilled right and you got to leave
[1:04:59] what the in between up to God so now he
[1:05:03] said destroy the very purpose here you
[1:05:05] are Abraham you're about 115 years old
[1:05:07] now you waited for 25 years for the baby
[1:05:11] yeah and now the boy is 15 or 16 years
[1:05:13] old I want you to take him up and kill
[1:05:16] him so that I can make you a father of
[1:05:19] Nations he said Abraham never
[1:05:22] moved oh I want that kind of Faith don't
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] he never quivered at the word of God
[1:05:30] said yes Lord here I go yes Lord here I
[1:05:35] go picked up the wood and took Isaac
[1:05:38] right up to the top of the hill just
[1:05:40] exactly in obedience why he put the
[1:05:44] Commandment of God first listen to what
[1:05:47] God tells him in Genesis 22:2 he said
[1:05:49] take now thy son thine only son look how
[1:05:53] God presents this to him I want you to
[1:05:55] take everything you've got all your
[1:05:57] hopes all your dreams whom thou lovest
[1:06:01] and get thee into the land of Mariah and
[1:06:03] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:06:05] upon one of the mountains which I will
[1:06:07] tell thee
[1:06:09] of and and the lack of conversation yes
[1:06:13] after this is amazing to me like wait a
[1:06:18] minute shouldn't shouldn't god let's
[1:06:20] have it
[1:06:24] talk come
[1:06:26] right I mean I got
[1:06:29] questions right you asked me to
[1:06:31] sacrifice Isaac Lord give me a
[1:06:33] revelation help me to understand
[1:06:35] Revelation doesn't always doesn't always
[1:06:37] come the way we think it should right he
[1:06:40] doesn't always tell us ahead of time or
[1:06:42] warn us ahead of time what we're about
[1:06:45] to go through but what he does he says
[1:06:48] follow me follow me obey my
[1:06:51] word don't quit going to church don't
[1:06:54] quit doing what's right yeah don't quit
[1:06:56] living for God you're going to go
[1:06:57] through some things it's not going to
[1:06:59] work out the dream listen to me church
[1:07:01] so many people give up because they have
[1:07:03] big dreams and then they go get to
[1:07:05] follow those dreams and they hit a test
[1:07:06] and they say well the Lord must not have
[1:07:07] wanted me to do it
[1:07:09] nonsense If Abraham had done that he
[1:07:11] would have never achieved anything he'
[1:07:14] have never been the father of Faith but
[1:07:15] he's the father of Faith because he hit
[1:07:17] up against obstacle after after obstacle
[1:07:20] and he said I know the word is still
[1:07:22] true I know what God told me is still
[1:07:24] accurate listen can can we do that
[1:07:26] church we've hit obstacle after obstacle
[1:07:28] with our families obstacle after
[1:07:30] obstacle here at the church what are we
[1:07:31] going to do with it are we going to are
[1:07:33] we going to just turn back and say well
[1:07:35] it's too hard it's hard to be a message
[1:07:37] believer in this hour it's hard to live
[1:07:39] for God it's hard to be a cre or are we
[1:07:40] going to say I'm Abraham's seed I was
[1:07:43] called to do it I was called to be a
[1:07:46] believer right I got a text yesterday
[1:07:49] from somebody was going through some
[1:07:50] things and and he told me he said I've
[1:07:51] gone through this and I've gone through
[1:07:53] that and I've been through that but in
[1:07:54] the middle of that text he wrote me and
[1:07:56] he said I know I'm a son of Abraham I'm
[1:07:58] a Child of God I'm a seed of God I said
[1:08:00] that's the right attitude to have that's
[1:08:03] the right attitude to have you don't
[1:08:04] have to deny what you're going through
[1:08:05] but I know I'm a Seed of Abraham I know
[1:08:08] God's going to keep me I don't have to
[1:08:09] have a conversation about why yeah I
[1:08:12] just know he's going to do it amen amen
[1:08:17] amen and he said I you know we would
[1:08:20] have said maybe I've got questions yeah
[1:08:23] but not
[1:08:23] Abraham why his Faith was expressed in
[1:08:27] his
[1:08:28] Works Abraham rose up early in the
[1:08:30] morning and saddled his ass and took two
[1:08:33] of his young men with him and Isaac his
[1:08:34] son and caved the wood for the burnt
[1:08:36] offering and Rose up and went into the
[1:08:38] place of which God had told him see
[1:08:43] faith is not always doing great things
[1:08:46] simple obedience is Faith yes sir simple
[1:08:51] obedience is Faith right I'm going to do
[1:08:53] what God Said period yes obedience let's
[1:08:57] look at that for just a moment before we
[1:08:58] go a little bit further into Jehovah gy
[1:09:00] Deuteronomy 4:30 says when thou art in
[1:09:03] Tribulation and all these things that
[1:09:04] come upon thee even in the latter days
[1:09:07] now God's giv Israel a promise he's
[1:09:10] saying look you you're going to go after
[1:09:12] other gods you're going to stray you're
[1:09:13] going to do all of these things he said
[1:09:15] but when you're in Tribulation when all
[1:09:18] these things even in the latter days oh
[1:09:21] my he's still this is still a promise
[1:09:22] that's good for Israel because there's
[1:09:24] going to be 100 44,000 Jews that'll do
[1:09:27] this they'll turn back to God but he
[1:09:29] said even in the latter days if thou
[1:09:31] turn to the Lord thy God and shallal be
[1:09:33] obedient unto his voice he said all I
[1:09:35] want you to do is obey
[1:09:37] me he said for the Lord thy God is a
[1:09:40] merciful god he will not forsake thee
[1:09:43] neither destroy thee nor forget the
[1:09:44] Covenant of thy fathers which he weing
[1:09:46] to him listen you don't need to obey a
[1:09:48] preacher you don't need to obey a uh you
[1:09:50] don't need to obey a boss necessarily
[1:09:52] you don't need to obey any of these
[1:09:53] things you need to obey God
[1:09:56] first don't you don't have to be extra
[1:09:58] about it y'all know what I mean by that
[1:10:02] you don't have to walk around say Lord
[1:10:05] I'm going to obey you here it is just
[1:10:07] obey just do what God says well praise
[1:10:11] God let's have a let's have you know

[1:10:14] everything and that's good that's that's
[1:10:16] awesome we have little celebrations with
[1:10:17] our families and stuff but but you don't
[1:10:19] have to have an obedience celebration
[1:10:21] call a party live stream it this is my
[1:10:23] obedience
[1:10:26] you know like we do we take the picture
[1:10:28] of the Bible and and and the co coffee
[1:10:30] cup for some for some reason that goes
[1:10:32] together and you said and said I'm
[1:10:34] obeying God I'm reading my Bible and
[1:10:36] praying listen we don't have to do that
[1:10:37] it might encourage somebody else if we
[1:10:39] did but we don't have to do that God
[1:10:41] knows when we
[1:10:43] obey we don't need to be extra right you
[1:10:46] don't have to be super spiritual I'm not
[1:10:49] against spirituality at all if God
[1:10:51] speaks to you that's wonderful I believe
[1:10:53] God does speak to people I believe these
[1:10:54] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:10:56] right we believe that but you but listen
[1:11:00] to obey God we obey what he's already
[1:11:02] told us right it's not necessarily what
[1:11:05] he's going to tell us in the future but
[1:11:07] the things we already know that's the
[1:11:09] things that we've got to obey sir he
[1:11:11] said for the Lord thy God is a merciful
[1:11:12] god he will not forsake thee neither
[1:11:14] destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of
[1:11:16] thy fathers which he swear unto them
[1:11:18] Isaiah 1:18 says come now let us reason
[1:11:21] together sayith the Lord though your
[1:11:23] sins be as Scarlet they shall be as
[1:11:26] white as snow isn't this a beautiful
[1:11:28] word picture he said though they be red
[1:11:30] like Crimson they shall be as wool yes
[1:11:34] oh my it's I used to sing that a lot as
[1:11:36] a young person and I was trying to make
[1:11:38] sure I was where I needed to be with God
[1:11:40] I sing that old uh old altar hymn old
[1:11:43] altar call song whiter than snow or
[1:11:46] Jesus I long to be perfectly whole wash
[1:11:48] me and make me whiter than snow oh
[1:11:51] Church it still rings in my heart today
[1:11:53] I want to have this in my heart though
[1:11:55] my sins were red as Crimson they are
[1:11:58] like wool though they be as Scarlet
[1:12:00] they'll be white as snow he said if you
[1:12:03] be willing and obedient yeah that's
[1:12:08] pretty good isn't it he didn't say you
[1:12:11] know if you'll do this jump through this
[1:12:12] hoop you know follow this ministry go
[1:12:15] out no if you just be willing and
[1:12:17] obedient yes you shall eat the good of
[1:12:19] the land but if you refuse and rebel you
[1:12:22] should be devoured with the sword for
[1:12:23] the mouth of the Lord has spoken it
[1:12:26] remember Saul and I'm just going through
[1:12:27] these things quickly Saul was very
[1:12:29] religious when he went down and and
[1:12:31] killed the amalekites then he had all
[1:12:32] the animals spared and made a sacrifice
[1:12:35] and Samuel went down there and said hey
[1:12:37] what what is this bleeding of sheep out
[1:12:39] he he said well I fully obeyed the Lord
[1:12:41] he said well then what's the what's the
[1:12:43] beeding ship he said oh that's for a
[1:12:44] religious purpose that's for a sacrifice
[1:12:47] right and Samuel said at the lord it's
[1:12:49] great Delight in burnt offerings and
[1:12:51] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:12:53] the Lord told to obey is better than
[1:12:56] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:12:59] rams we find that Jesus was obedient as
[1:13:02] as in the type of Jehovah Gyra we find
[1:13:05] Isaac was obedient not just Abraham but
[1:13:08] Isaac was obedient yes to Abraham's word
[1:13:10] Jesus was obedient in Romans 5:18
[1:13:13] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:13:16] judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:13:18] condemnation even so by the
[1:13:20] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:13:23] upon all men to justification of life
[1:13:26] for as by one man someone say one man
[1:13:29] one man's Disobedience many were made
[1:13:32] Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall
[1:13:36] many be made righteous what was it
[1:13:38] simple obedience the son obeying the
[1:13:41] father's will you say well he had to no
[1:13:44] he didn't but there was nothing in him
[1:13:46] to disobey but but he did have his own
[1:13:49] way he could have disobeyed but there
[1:13:51] was something he was the son of God and
[1:13:53] you're Sons and Daughters of God join
[1:13:55] hers with Christ he said just the same
[1:13:57] as Abraham passed the test Jesus passed
[1:14:00] the test oh I I just love that like he
[1:14:03] he was willing to be led up the hill and
[1:14:04] laid on the cross but he knew where he
[1:14:06] was going right oh my sir oh my see
[1:14:11] Isaac didn't know what the end would be
[1:14:13] but he was just obedient you don't know
[1:14:15] what the end would be but Jesus knew
[1:14:17] yeah he was going to the Cross he said
[1:14:19] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:14:22] done Philippians 2:5 said let this mine
[1:14:24] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:14:27] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:14:29] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:14:31] made himself of no reputation yeah and
[1:14:34] took upon him the form of a servant was
[1:14:37] made in the likeness of men and being
[1:14:39] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[1:14:41] himself became what's that word obedient
[1:14:45] unto death even the death of the Cross
[1:14:48] where God also hath highly exalted him
[1:14:51] and given him a name which is above
[1:14:53] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:14:55] Jesus every knee should bow oh I believe
[1:14:57] it ought to be true today of things in
[1:14:59] heaven and things in Earth and things
[1:15:00] under the Earth that every tongue should
[1:15:02] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:15:05] glory of God the Father what is that
[1:15:07] it's an obedience that he had listen to
[1:15:10] me church do you realize that when you
[1:15:12] come to God the only way to receive his
[1:15:15] spirit in you is to be obedient amen and
[1:15:18] that's the sign when you come in
[1:15:20] obedience to the full word that is the
[1:15:22] sign that the the spirit of Christ is in
[1:15:24] you because the obedient one is on the
[1:15:27] inside look at Paul's words he's saying
[1:15:29] Adam the old man was
[1:15:31] disobedient Adam the flesh is Naturally
[1:15:34] by Nature disobedient are you with me
[1:15:36] now but but Jesus was obedient right
[1:15:40] glory to God oh I want to be like that
[1:15:43] how can you be like him by receiving his
[1:15:45] Spirit the literal Life of Christ on the
[1:15:47] inside of you by the token the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost full obedience he said to the word
[1:15:53] brings God the word eternal in you and
[1:15:55] that is the token you'll find that in
[1:15:58] several places brother BR says full
[1:16:00] obedience to the full word of God oh I
[1:16:03] love that today sir listen he said
[1:16:05] you've got to die to yourself in your
[1:16:06] thoughts and fully obey the word full
[1:16:08] obedience to the full word listen Church
[1:16:12] it is not our job to provide the
[1:16:15] lamb it's not our job to do that it's
[1:16:18] our job to
[1:16:19] obey we can't be our own lamb we can't
[1:16:22] to be obedient for us to death is not to
[1:16:24] be Obed to the death on the cross
[1:16:26] because if we died on the cross it
[1:16:27] wouldn't atone for sin because we're not
[1:16:29] the perfect one but he already did that
[1:16:32] so obedience for us is to acknowledge
[1:16:34] what he did and say Lord I'm going to
[1:16:36] follow you I'm going to follow you in
[1:16:38] baptism I'm going to follow you in in in
[1:16:40] Christian Living I'm going to follow you
[1:16:42] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:16:44] going to follow you in sanctification
[1:16:46] yeah I'm going to follow you in
[1:16:48] obedience
[1:16:50] yes see and and Adam don't want to obey
[1:16:53] and you'll always fight that yeah but
[1:16:55] Jesus
[1:16:56] obeys the word he is the
[1:16:59] word he provides the
[1:17:02] lamb he told Abraham he said I want you
[1:17:04] to take all that you've achieved and
[1:17:07] give it back to me and Abraham was
[1:17:10] obedient remember Abraham had sent
[1:17:12] ishmail away so all of his hopes and all
[1:17:15] of his dreams were in Isaac but God said
[1:17:18] go so Abraham
[1:17:21] went and on the Third Day verse 4
[1:17:23] Genesis 224
[1:17:25] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:17:28] place a far off he was brother random
[1:17:33] says I believe 75 to 100 miles from
[1:17:37] civilization it's a long ways from where
[1:17:40] Abraham was to where Abraham made the
[1:17:45] sacrifice it's the it's where he made
[1:17:48] the sacrifice is actually Mount Mariah
[1:17:50] in Jerusalem and where he was was many
[1:17:52] miles away in Genesis 225 Abraham said
[1:17:56] unto his young men abide you here with
[1:17:58] the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder
[1:18:00] and worship I love this and come again
[1:18:05] to you right oh my look at the faith
[1:18:09] that this man had he said I and the lad
[1:18:11] will go and come again
[1:18:13] now sometimes you've got to rely not on
[1:18:16] a specific promise of God see
[1:18:19] everybody's wanting a specific word but
[1:18:21] sometimes you got to rely on the nature
[1:18:23] of God right
[1:18:25] that's good right Abraham is not relying
[1:18:28] on the specific promise although there's
[1:18:30] a promise the overarching promise the
[1:18:32] big promise is he'll have a he'll have a
[1:18:35] son right so Isaac got to live one way
[1:18:38] or the other right but he's not just
[1:18:41] relying on the promise he's relying on
[1:18:42] the nature of God right what what what
[1:18:44] is the nature of God God keeps his word
[1:18:47] God don't change his mind are you with
[1:18:50] me now the nature of God is that somehow
[1:18:53] this is going to work out
[1:18:55] for my good all things someone say all
[1:18:57] things work together for good to them
[1:18:59] that love God are called according to
[1:19:00] his purpose what is he doing he's saying
[1:19:03] he's saying you you've got to rely
[1:19:05] sometimes on the fact that God is good
[1:19:08] and he loves you and that's enough
[1:19:11] brother brand said when the uh during
[1:19:13] the Dark Ages when they were there and
[1:19:15] they their babies were being cut out of
[1:19:17] of Mother's woms and the mother left to
[1:19:19] die trying to get the the dad to recant
[1:19:21] their faith and many times they were
[1:19:23] tortured and put on the rack and and
[1:19:26] given poison or waterboarded and things
[1:19:28] like that put through many many
[1:19:30] different tortures that they were put
[1:19:31] through and if you go and read that
[1:19:33] think how did they stand through that
[1:19:34] well God told them he told Jesus told
[1:19:37] them and when he spoke to the church age
[1:19:39] he said he said I know yeah he just said
[1:19:42] I know he didn't say I'll fix it he
[1:19:45] didn't say I'll get you out of it he
[1:19:47] just said I know and brother B takes
[1:19:48] something the church H book and he said
[1:19:50] it's a good it's a n that he knows yeah
[1:19:53] it's Oh my he didn't have to didn't
[1:19:54] intervene because that was the age they
[1:19:56] lived in they were suffering but it's
[1:19:58] enough that he knows and if he knows
[1:20:00] come on church if I'm in his will if I'm
[1:20:03] walking in the way God called me to walk
[1:20:05] I'm in the house of God but I don't feel
[1:20:06] good I'm in the house of God but my
[1:20:08] finances aren't right I'm in the house
[1:20:10] of God but things aren't going exactly
[1:20:11] like they said they would but I'm in his
[1:20:13] will I'm doing what he told me to do and
[1:20:15] so I'm believing today that me and the
[1:20:17] lb's going to go and me and the lad will
[1:20:20] come again somehow it's going to work
[1:20:22] out somehow things are going to get
[1:20:24] better
[1:20:25] come on church every one of us ought to
[1:20:27] be like that I may not understand why
[1:20:29] but I will not fall into depression I
[1:20:32] will not let over anxiety overwhelm my
[1:20:34] life because I know it's going to work
[1:20:36] out I know it's going to be okay not
[1:20:38] because of anything not because somebody
[1:20:40] spoke in tongues over me come on church
[1:20:42] not because of that but because the word
[1:20:44] of God is still true and he's the same
[1:20:46] yesterday today and forever and the
[1:20:47] nature of God is to provide for my needs
[1:20:51] amen amen good good come on now Abraham
[1:20:55] said I and the lad will go and come
[1:20:56] again in another translation it says
[1:20:59] Abraham said to his servants you stay
[1:21:00] here with the donkey and I and the boy
[1:21:03] will go up there yes sir we will
[1:21:06] worship and then we will return to you
[1:21:10] yes sir oh my it puts it pretty plain
[1:21:11] doesn't it sir Hebrews 11:17 by faith
[1:21:15] Abraham when he was tried offered up
[1:21:18] Isaac and he that had received the
[1:21:21] promises look look at the tension that
[1:21:23] Paul creates here with these words he
[1:21:25] that had received the promises offered
[1:21:28] up the results of the
[1:21:34] promises there's so much
[1:21:36] here right because sometimes to stay
[1:21:39] with the word it seems like the Revival
[1:21:42] dies yeah come on now H so Abraham says
[1:21:46] well if I stay with the word the Revival
[1:21:47] is going to die come on but I got to
[1:21:49] trust God for the Revival and stay with
[1:21:52] the word
[1:21:54] right you don't you don't you don't
[1:21:57] change the word for a temporary Revival
[1:21:59] I think I've told you before but listen
[1:22:00] if you're going Downstream if you're if
[1:22:03] you're struggling against a current you
[1:22:04] know you're while you're oring while
[1:22:06] you're rowing going against the current
[1:22:09] it's hard you get fatigued you feel
[1:22:12] stressed cuz you're going against the
[1:22:14] current but when you let go you have a
[1:22:16] temporary
[1:22:18] Revival you feel better but where are
[1:22:20] you going many people when they leave
[1:22:23] church they think well you know it's
[1:22:25] easier you know many times when you I I
[1:22:27] don't mean to harp ites but many times
[1:22:28] you stay home from church say well it's
[1:22:30] just easier if we don't go on Wednesday
[1:22:31] nights it's easier if we don't do that
[1:22:33] and I know people are G for different
[1:22:34] reasons I'm not preaching at you this
[1:22:36] morning I'm just saying in general you
[1:22:38] know it's easier if we just let it go
[1:22:40] that's right sure it is but look where
[1:22:43] you're going right that's right it's
[1:22:46] easier if we don't do everything we know
[1:22:48] to do but look where look where you're
[1:22:50] headed yes it's easier just let our kids
[1:22:52] go and be like kids in the world it's
[1:22:54] easier to say nothing to them if they
[1:22:55] don't dress appropriately or act
[1:22:57] appropriately it's easier just to let it
[1:22:59] go but look where you're going come on
[1:23:01] now
[1:23:02] yeah oh church we need to stay with the
[1:23:05] word even if it seems to kill all of our
[1:23:07] hopes and dreams we say Lord your word
[1:23:09] is
[1:23:10] true we'll trust you for the outcome yes
[1:23:14] look what he says he had received the
[1:23:16] promises offered up his only begotten
[1:23:17] son auma would said that in Isaac shall
[1:23:20] thy seed be called a county that God was
[1:23:26] able there's a great Revelation
[1:23:29] there what did the Hebrew children say
[1:23:31] we don't know if God's going to deliver
[1:23:34] us but we know he's able so we won't bow
[1:23:38] to your image come on church we won't be
[1:23:41] L to see we won't fall into lukewarmness
[1:23:44] why not because we we say well God's
[1:23:46] going to God's going to fill up my bank
[1:23:47] account God's going to do that no we're
[1:23:49] not doing it because of that we're doing
[1:23:50] it because we believe that the God who
[1:23:52] made the promise is able somehow how to
[1:23:54] keep the promise we don't know how he's
[1:23:57] going to do it we don't know when the
[1:23:59] Rapture is going to happen we don't know
[1:24:00] how it's going but we know this our
[1:24:02] bodies are going to change one day it's
[1:24:05] going to take place right we account
[1:24:07] that God's able to raise us up listen to
[1:24:09] me church that's what we've got to do in
[1:24:11] our hour we've been asked to believe
[1:24:12] almost an impossible thing that a body
[1:24:14] could change back into a young body
[1:24:16] again into a perfect body it seems like
[1:24:19] an impossible thing but God said I want
[1:24:20] you to believe it and we've got to be
[1:24:22] able to account that God is able to
[1:24:24] raise us up even from the
[1:24:27] dead good
[1:24:29] Hallelujah why could he count that he
[1:24:31] said from when also he received him in a
[1:24:34] figure so in other words look look at
[1:24:36] Abraham's faith and where it's drawing
[1:24:38] from he says I was
[1:24:42] dead church for every intent and purpose
[1:24:45] I could not produce there you go a word
[1:24:49] child and every one of us could say Amen
[1:24:52] to that we were all dead in in shaping
[1:24:55] in iniquities come to the world speaking
[1:24:56] Li for all inten we could not produce
[1:24:59] the right thing all of us were there are
[1:25:03] you with me now he said I was dead but
[1:25:06] one I didn't stay Dead one day the angel
[1:25:09] of the Lord spoke to me and and I became
[1:25:11] alive and I my body change happened I I
[1:25:14] changed something's different about me I
[1:25:16] was able to have this boy and because of
[1:25:18] that I realized if I was dead and he
[1:25:21] raised me from the dead he can raise my
[1:25:23] dreams from the dead he can ra he can
[1:25:24] raise my family for are you with me now
[1:25:26] he can save my friends he can save my
[1:25:29] family he can save my children why he
[1:25:31] saved
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:34] me he didn't save you because you were
[1:25:36] good he didn't save you because it
[1:25:37] wasn't difficult amen so well they've
[1:25:41] gone too far so at all of us every one
[1:25:44] of us had gone too far everybody wants
[1:25:46] to use that say well we've gone too far
[1:25:47] Adam's race had gone too far but there
[1:25:50] was one found worthy in Revelation chap
[1:25:52] 5 to open the book and the loops of
[1:25:56] seals right no one was worthy to bridge
[1:25:59] the gap to come across that Chasm
[1:26:01] brother brandom talks about the bridge
[1:26:02] no one was worthy to do that we were on
[1:26:04] one side God was on another but the lamb
[1:26:06] opened the
[1:26:09] book bloody lamb who
[1:26:11] died for us Jehovah Gyra God will
[1:26:17] provide
[1:26:18] Hallelujah so his expectation of a
[1:26:21] resurrection was based on his own
[1:26:23] Resurrection
[1:26:25] our expectation for our loved ones is
[1:26:28] based on what God has done for us right
[1:26:31] we they have to be save themselves we
[1:26:33] can't save them but our expectation for
[1:26:35] them is based on what God did for
[1:26:38] us and so we need to think about what
[1:26:40] God did for us and then have that same
[1:26:43] faith for our children for our
[1:26:45] grandchildren for those that we love
[1:26:47] listen he said did Abraham fear no sir
[1:26:50] right Abraham said this I am fully
[1:26:52] persuaded that he is able to raise him
[1:26:55] up from the dead for I received him as
[1:26:58] one from the dead and if that
[1:27:01] commandment of God told me to do this
[1:27:03] and I stayed true to it and it paid off
[1:27:05] to have given me the son God is able to
[1:27:08] raise him from the dead from which I
[1:27:10] received him as a figure verse 6 Genesis
[1:27:13] 226 Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:27:15] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[1:27:17] he took the fire in his hand and a knife
[1:27:20] and they went both of them together and
[1:27:22] here they go to church
[1:27:25] and Isaac's okay for a little while and
[1:27:26] then brother brand said you started to
[1:27:27] get
[1:27:29] suspicious CU Isaac knows what it takes
[1:27:31] to have
[1:27:34] church there's a lot of extra things we
[1:27:37] we we struggle with technology so much
[1:27:39] because none of us are very
[1:27:40] technologically able I found that Hardy
[1:27:43] is a technological
[1:27:46] desert and so we have a very difficult
[1:27:49] time don't we brother Robert all of us
[1:27:50] do very difficult that's that's the
[1:27:52] preacher included we've had to things up
[1:27:54] we've done remarkably well for the size
[1:27:56] of congregation we have to be able to do
[1:27:58] what we do and I know I know those that
[1:27:59] are streaming today are thankful for
[1:28:01] that those of you when you have to stay
[1:28:03] home but my own wife's at home sick
[1:28:05] today and and and it's I'm thankful that
[1:28:08] we're able to do it so it's a it's a but
[1:28:11] you don't have to have that to have
[1:28:15] church right none of that has to be
[1:28:18] there it's not a
[1:28:21] necessity right this microphone is nice
[1:28:24] but it's it's not a necessity yeah the
[1:28:27] pews are nice but they're not even a
[1:28:29] necessity we can sit on the
[1:28:33] floor well maybe for some of us could we
[1:28:36] could all sit some of us couldn't get
[1:28:40] up but it's a it's a you know it's not
[1:28:43] Necessities they didn't have none of
[1:28:45] that in the early
[1:28:47] church what's the necessity the
[1:28:50] necessity is the fire yeah
[1:28:54] and the
[1:28:55] wood something for the fire to burn and
[1:28:58] the
[1:28:59] lamb and you talked about that the word
[1:29:01] and the spirit have to be there right
[1:29:05] one not one without the other but both
[1:29:07] together because the logos he said my
[1:29:09] words are life so when you preach the
[1:29:11] true word you have this the spirit of
[1:29:13] God is there he anoints that word right
[1:29:15] so the word and the spirit have to be
[1:29:17] there and he says we're having a pretty
[1:29:19] good
[1:29:20] service
[1:29:22] yeah but where's the
[1:29:26] lamb oh Church would be a great question
[1:29:28] to ask wouldn't it we're having a pretty
[1:29:30] good service but where's the lamb sir
[1:29:33] I'll say this and just as a way of kind
[1:29:35] of just putting it in here uh at the
[1:29:37] risk of kind of shoving it in a square
[1:29:39] peg to a round hole but listen listen
[1:29:42] Jesus always needs to be present in our
[1:29:44] preaching Christ needs to be there the
[1:29:47] lamb needs to be we need to preach
[1:29:49] Christ when when listen when you when
[1:29:52] all the couns doesn't work and the
[1:29:53] things that you're going through and it
[1:29:55] seems like everything's wrong and every
[1:29:57] nothing's going right and it seemed like
[1:29:58] nobody has the answers preach Christ
[1:30:01] because Christ has the answer listen
[1:30:03] young people if you look to him he's got
[1:30:05] the answer for everything you have need
[1:30:06] of he is Jehovah Gyra he is our provider
[1:30:11] he is the provided lamb oh Church listen
[1:30:15] they he said where's the
[1:30:17] lamb listen something was missing and
[1:30:20] Abraham said my son God will provide
[1:30:22] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[1:30:26] they went both of them together he said
[1:30:29] here's the wood and here is all
[1:30:30] everything the fire where is the Lamb
[1:30:32] for the burnt offering listen to that
[1:30:34] old daddy without a quiver in his voice
[1:30:35] he said my son oh church God will
[1:30:38] provide for himself the sacrifice his
[1:30:42] only son going to the slaughter but yet
[1:30:44] that faithful old heart had knew that
[1:30:46] God can't lie that's the Seed of Abraham
[1:30:48] today how can it be brother Brandon God
[1:30:50] will provide for himself how is it going
[1:30:53] to I don't know but he's Jehovah
[1:30:56] Gyra Genesis 22:9 they came to the place
[1:30:59] which God had told him of and Abraham
[1:31:02] built an altar there and laid the wood
[1:31:03] in order yeah maybe took a little bit
[1:31:05] longer with the pre-service than he
[1:31:06] normally did you know said God you need
[1:31:09] to show
[1:31:12] up or else all of my dreams are going to
[1:31:15] die
[1:31:16] today I'm sure he was
[1:31:20] desperate what was it full obedience
[1:31:24] full obedience he bound Isaac his son
[1:31:29] and laid him on the altar upon the wood
[1:31:31] I'll be honest with you if I went to
[1:31:33] have church and we just built an altar
[1:31:35] of stones here in the middle and I told
[1:31:36] Peter Peter and Peter saw the fire he
[1:31:39] saw the wood and I start to bind him I'd
[1:31:43] have a difficult time doing
[1:31:48] it I don't know what happened to you but
[1:31:55] dad you're crazy isn't it amazing that
[1:31:57] Isaac being a type of Christ laid
[1:32:01] himself
[1:32:03] down when his 115 year old father that
[1:32:07] old that that boy didn't this it be good
[1:32:09] for some of you young people that boy
[1:32:10] didn't stand there oh that old man don't
[1:32:11] know nothing he's
[1:32:13] crazy the
[1:32:15] teenager laid himself on the Altar and
[1:32:18] said God I I don't understand it I don't
[1:32:21] understand why dad's making this
[1:32:22] decision but I I trust you
[1:32:25] Lord oh Church yeah Abraham stretched
[1:32:29] forth his hand took the knife to slay
[1:32:30] his son and the angel of the Lord called
[1:32:33] unto him out of heaven and said Abraham
[1:32:35] Abraham and he said here am I sir he
[1:32:39] said lay not thine hand upon the lamb
[1:32:41] neither do thou anything unto him for
[1:32:43] now I know that thou fearest God seeing
[1:32:46] thou Hast not withheld thy son thine
[1:32:48] only son from me right yeah and Abraham
[1:32:51] lifted up his eyes and looked and lo and
[1:32:53] behold behind him a ram caught in a
[1:32:57] Thicket by his horns he just had to look
[1:32:59] away from his present situation and look
[1:33:02] around see what God was about to do what
[1:33:04] was he looking for listen he said God he
[1:33:07] he said God won't make you so he said
[1:33:08] well there must be a sacrifice somewhere
[1:33:10] if Isaac's not going to be offered there
[1:33:12] must be a a ram caught in the bushes
[1:33:15] amen caught on a Thicket and behold
[1:33:18] behind him a ram caught the thicket by
[1:33:19] his horns and Abraham went took the RAM
[1:33:21] and offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:33:23] in the stad of his son and Abraham
[1:33:24] called the name of that place Jehovah
[1:33:26] Gyra as it has said to this day in the
[1:33:28] Mount of the Lord it shall be
[1:33:31] seen yes lamb was provided as it was
[1:33:36] many years later on that same

[1:34:09] Redemptive names of Jehovah found in the
[1:34:12] scripture Exodus 1526 I'll move through
[1:34:15] these quickly but you may want to write
[1:34:16] them down this is uh Jehovah Rafa he
[1:34:19] says I put none of these diseases upon

[1:35:07] nii Jehovah ni oh my Jehovah Jehovah had
[1:35:13] all of these compound names and this one
[1:35:16] is Jehovah n now go back to that go back
[1:35:22] to the to the slide if you will brother
[1:35:24] Robert I'm sorry I lost my place for
[1:35:26] just a minute go back to the side with
[1:35:29] the all the names on
[1:35:34] it I'm getting

[1:36:05] righteousness oh my in Jeremiah that's
[1:36:07] in Jeremiah 23
[1:36:10] six now brother bandam says this he said
[1:36:12] now God his attitude towards the people
[1:36:15] from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in
[1:36:19] these seven Redemptive names so the name
[1:36:24] is God's attitude towards you it's God's
[1:36:28] it's who he is right it's telling us
[1:36:31] that's what a name does it says who he
[1:36:32] is and this is who he is and if you
[1:36:36] remember how many remember FF Bosworth
[1:36:39] we may talk a little bit more about him
[1:36:40] tonight to the with the young people but
[1:36:42] FF Bosworth was a a man who believed in
[1:36:45] Divine Healing he wrote Christ the
[1:36:47] Healer and when he was about 70 years
[1:36:48] old he and brother bram's pths crossed
[1:36:52] and you remember that brother brandham
[1:36:53] was challenged to a debate in Houston
[1:36:55] Texas by Baptist preacher about Divine
[1:36:57] Healing yeah and FF Bosworth answered
[1:37:00] the challenge brother Randon wouldn't do
[1:37:01] it but he was there and so FF Bosworth
[1:37:05] is making a case during that debate he
[1:37:07] makes this case he says if he is our
[1:37:10] sacrifice our Gyra he is our Rafa he is
[1:37:14] our healer yes sir if he is our healer
[1:37:17] yes sir he is sh he is with us amen if
[1:37:22] he is our peace if or if he's with us he
[1:37:25] is our
[1:37:26] peace right if he is our peace he is our
[1:37:29] Banner our
[1:37:31] Victory if he's our Victory he's our
[1:37:34] Shepherd if he's our Shepherd he's our
[1:37:38] righteousness so he challenged the
[1:37:40] Baptist P which of those seven
[1:37:41] Redemptive names was not in Christ he
[1:37:44] said well all of them were in Christ
[1:37:46] well if they were in Christ that's what
[1:37:48] he is to
[1:37:50] us that's what oh church that's what he
[1:37:53] is all seven Redemptive names were
[1:37:55] wrapped up in Christ and that's Church
[1:37:59] Christ is God's attitude towards his
[1:38:05] people good so now what happened at that
[1:38:08] debate remember that's the debate where
[1:38:11] the pillar of fire appears over brother
[1:38:12] bram's head when he comes up to pray
[1:38:15] remember what happened in all the other
[1:38:17] they took all the pictures of the Man
[1:38:19] how he wanted to put his finger in his
[1:38:20] face and things like that they all
[1:38:22] failed none of the pictures turned out
[1:38:24] but one and that's the famous picture of
[1:38:26] the pillar of fire was authenticated to
[1:38:28] be light that struck the lens right the
[1:38:31] only uh authenticated Supernatural photo
[1:38:34] that's ever been taken that we know of
[1:38:36] that was authenticated in that manner so
[1:38:38] it was a supernatural light what was it
[1:38:41] God in the pillar of fire and all of
[1:38:44] those attributes of the seven Redemptive
[1:38:46] names are in that Pillar of
[1:38:50] Fire right what did Paul what did you
[1:38:53] tell Paul he said I am the one he said
[1:38:55] I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest what was
[1:38:57] he a pillar of
[1:38:59] fire Hallelujah so if they were all in
[1:39:02] Christ and the and Christ was the pillar
[1:39:04] of fire and the pillar of fire is was
[1:39:06] with brother brandham you say well he
[1:39:08] was with brother brandham one day he has
[1:39:09] got to come back for the Brom no but the
[1:39:11] brandom taught us the pillar of fire is
[1:39:13] not just with him the pillar of fire is
[1:39:15] in you that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:39:18] then if all that Christ was was wrapped
[1:39:21] up in those seven Redemptive names oh
[1:39:22] Church then all that Christ was he is
[1:39:25] your healing he is your peace he is your
[1:39:27] salvation he is your Victory he is all
[1:39:29] of these
[1:39:33] things so all all those compound names
[1:39:37] now look he said in all those compound
[1:39:38] names they were everyone met in Jesus
[1:39:40] Christ he was Jehovah
[1:39:43] Gyra he was Jehovah RFA the Healer he
[1:39:45] was Jehovah the banner Jehovah the
[1:39:46] buckler Jehovah the peace Jehovah the
[1:39:48] shepherd all those compound Redemptive
[1:39:51] names was applied to Lord Jesus couldn't
[1:39:53] apply one and take the other one away
[1:39:55] yes if they was not applied he was not
[1:39:57] Jesus the son of God they're
[1:39:59] Inseparable and you can't separate God's
[1:40:01] compound names and if one of them was
[1:40:03] applied to Jesus all of them someone say
[1:40:05] all all them was applied to Jesus so if
[1:40:08] he's God's provided sacrifice for sin
[1:40:10] he's God's provided atonement for
[1:40:13] healing sir oh can we believe that today
[1:40:16] sir you that are sick can we believe
[1:40:18] that if he's God's provided sacrifice
[1:40:20] for sin he's God's provided atonement
[1:40:22] for healing the same yesterday today and
[1:40:24] forever listen to me church he was
[1:40:27] righteousness to a woman caught in
[1:40:29] adultery look what he was when he was
[1:40:30] here he was he was her righteousness she
[1:40:33] wasn't righteous she was caught in the a
[1:40:35] but he was righteous he was a Shepherd
[1:40:38] to Peter when he said Satan desires to
[1:40:40] sift you like wheat but I prayed for you
[1:40:42] he was Victory to a man possessed by a
[1:40:45] legion of demons is he your Victory this
[1:40:47] morning he was aace to the disciples in
[1:40:50] the storm when he was laying there
[1:40:52] asleep and they out to wake him up and
[1:40:54] he gets up and says oh you have little
[1:40:55] faith and he rebukes the storm and says
[1:40:57] peace be still what was he Jehovah
[1:41:00] peace oh Church Jehovah peace he was
[1:41:05] present for the woman at the well he was
[1:41:08] there he was healing to the woman that
[1:41:09] touched the H of His
[1:41:11] Garment and because the reason he's all
[1:41:13] of that is he is our provided
[1:41:18] sacrifice the Bible says he is the
[1:41:21] propitiation for our sins
[1:41:23] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:41:26] sins of the whole world he is the same
[1:41:30] today can we just glorify him for just a
[1:41:32] minute more Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:35] yesterday today and forever what was
[1:41:38] Jehovah Gyra it was the final Revelation
[1:41:41] that Abraham would receive was that God
[1:41:43] was sufficient in his sacrifice God was
[1:41:45] providing a sacrifice listen that's what
[1:41:48] God wants to bring you to is a complete
[1:41:50] Reliance and Trust on the one who
[1:41:52] provides es and he provides all of these
[1:41:56] things was Abraham fully obeying God and
[1:41:59] God fully revealing himself to
[1:42:01] Abraham what did he say God has provided
[1:42:04] the lamb I won't question it that's more
[1:42:06] than enough for me amen now we know that
[1:42:09] all of the other things that God
[1:42:12] is are
[1:42:14] secondary to the substitute to Jehovah
[1:42:16] Gyra yeah right because if he's not
[1:42:20] Jehovah Gyra he's none of the other
[1:42:21] things right but if he is Jehovah Gyra
[1:42:24] he's all of the other
[1:42:27] things amen and that's why I say let's
[1:42:30] preach Christ that's important and I
[1:42:33] believe Christ is the message of the
[1:42:35] hour the bleeding word that's why we
[1:42:37] preach the message of the hour around
[1:42:38] here we believe Christ is the message of
[1:42:40] the hour that's what we preach we preach
[1:42:42] Christ and this message didn't take me
[1:42:44] away from Christ this message brought me
[1:42:46] to a view of Christ where I understood
[1:42:48] who he
[1:42:49] was we were last night we were with the
[1:42:52] kids over in Branson we went to that uh
[1:42:55] Miracle of Christmas show and part of
[1:42:57] that that they do is trinitarian I don't
[1:42:58] know if the kids caught it but I'm sure
[1:43:00] they did cuz it was pretty obvious but
[1:43:02] they have Jesus standing there I don't
[1:43:04] know if you've seen the play they have
[1:43:05] Jesus standing there with his back to
[1:43:07] the audience and the father's speaking
[1:43:09] out of this with a big booming voice out
[1:43:10] of a big fire cloud and then the Holy
[1:43:13] Spirit you can't see him because he's a
[1:43:15] spirit and they're all there and and and
[1:43:18] God's telling Jesus he said now I want
[1:43:19] you to become a baby and go down the
[1:43:22] womb of Mary
[1:43:24] and then go and that's the way they
[1:43:25] understand
[1:43:26] it but the
[1:43:31] message right you realize what the
[1:43:32] message has done for us really Joel and
[1:43:35] I we didn't mean to be bad but we
[1:43:37] laughed about it we're sitting there
[1:43:39] chuckling because it's so so awkward man
[1:43:41] it's like really do I have to you
[1:43:44] know you go down and die for him I'm
[1:43:46] going to stay up here safe
[1:43:48] and it's not the way it was God came
[1:43:52] down yes
[1:43:55] so in their view God didn't didn't
[1:43:57] condescend the father condescended and
[1:43:59] or the son condescended but God stayed
[1:44:00] up there and the Holy Spirit didn't
[1:44:01] really have anything to do till
[1:44:04] later he just kind of floating around I
[1:44:07] heard trinitarian one time preaching on
[1:44:08] the Trinity he said the holy spirit is
[1:44:10] the Divine eavesdropper he said he just
[1:44:12] EES drops on the conversations going on
[1:44:14] in the throne room and then he go it's
[1:44:15] laughable isn't it but why why are we do
[1:44:18] we believe something different we're not
[1:44:20] under Superstition no more we're not
[1:44:22] hell under Roman theology we're not held
[1:44:25] under Babylonian ideas what do we
[1:44:27] believe we believe that God came down at
[1:44:29] Christmas time whenever that was we
[1:44:31] believe that God came down and came into
[1:44:33] a Manger God wrapped himself in flesh
[1:44:37] people want to complicate that or
[1:44:38] whatever but what it was was Jehovah
[1:44:40] Gyra coming down providing himself a
[1:44:43] lamb becoming the lamb you see how much
[1:44:47] greater of a story it is when God
[1:44:49] himself right
[1:44:51] becomes the lamb
[1:44:55] God has provided a lamb and he is more
[1:44:58] than enough for me yes everything else
[1:45:02] is secondary to that I believe he's all
[1:45:04] those other things but if he took my
[1:45:06] place he can provide my healing he can
[1:45:08] provide everything else that I have need
[1:45:10] of listen to me someone had to take our
[1:45:12] place someone had to die so we could
[1:45:14] live but once he has revealed himself to
[1:45:17] me as a savior or to you as a savior
[1:45:19] then all these other things are it's
[1:45:21] just natural and easy for him to do so
[1:45:24] can you imagine now
[1:45:26] listen if you just put yourself in
[1:45:28] Abraham's place for a
[1:45:30] minute he was about to kill his
[1:45:33] boy you talk about a a mixed emotion
[1:45:38] change the Bible don't say he shouted or
[1:45:40] danced or whatever but I think we'd all
[1:45:42] respond in a pretty relieved
[1:45:47] way if we were about to lose
[1:45:50] everything come on have you ever been
[1:45:52] there we were about to lose everything
[1:45:54] and
[1:45:56] suddenly in the ticket yes sir he
[1:45:59] catches a glimpse sir of something that
[1:46:03] will
[1:46:04] work
[1:46:05] Hallelujah it wasn't church he didn't
[1:46:08] catch a glimpse of an old disease broken
[1:46:10] down lamb it was just caught by the
[1:46:12] Thorns yes Church our lamb was not some
[1:46:17] some disease some kind of lamb that had
[1:46:20] sinned and something like that what was
[1:46:21] he was perfect he was sinless but he was
[1:46:23] caught by the Thorns the Thorns were on
[1:46:26] his ra he was caught there in the
[1:46:27] thicket by the Romans there you go he
[1:46:30] was placed by God yes oh church he he
[1:46:34] placed his own body there he surrendered
[1:46:37] himself to the will of the father placed
[1:46:38] his own body on the cross sir even felt
[1:46:43] the separation said my God my God why
[1:46:45] hast Thou forsaken me what was he doing
[1:46:48] but can you imagine you can you imagine
[1:46:50] the relief that Abraham felt when he
[1:46:52] looked at said there's my lamb well
[1:46:55] that's the same way I feel every time I
[1:46:57] look at my own sins every time I look at
[1:46:59] my own needs that I have and I see him
[1:47:01] there I see him there on the calvary I
[1:47:03] see him caught amen no wonder brother
[1:47:05] brand kept a crucifix nearby he kept one
[1:47:08] his car had one hanging in the church
[1:47:09] what was it I see my lamb I see what God
[1:47:13] has provided and I know he is Jehovah
[1:47:17] Gyra I see my lamb you imagine how
[1:47:21] Abraham felt now can you imagine how
[1:47:22] Isaac felt when he was loosed from his
[1:47:27] bonds amen you said can you imagine
[1:47:29] mother B yes I can because one day when
[1:47:32] the lamb when God provided a sacrifice
[1:47:34] for me when I realized what he had done
[1:47:36] for me my Bonds were
[1:47:38] loosed oh church I couldn't have paid
[1:47:40] for my own sins Isaac's death wouldn't
[1:47:42] have meant nothing it was just Abraham
[1:47:44] being obedient but there was a provided
[1:47:46] lamb oh Church of me laying myself down
[1:47:49] to him was just obedience but one day I
[1:47:51] caught a glimpse of who he was
[1:47:54] and he is God's provided
[1:47:57] lamb
[1:48:00] hallelujah oh my if you're a Christian
[1:48:04] today you were released just like
[1:48:09] Isaac you were released just like
[1:48:13] Barabas somebody took your
[1:48:16] place Hallelujah I wonder when we see
[1:48:18] him on the cross I'm not trying to stir
[1:48:20] up your emotions but it ought to mean
[1:48:22] something to us Church it all means I
[1:48:24] know I've been criticized for that
[1:48:26] somebody told me and said well you you
[1:48:27] preach 2,000 year old theology I pray
[1:48:30] it's fresh every day I pray I can still
[1:48:33] put my hands on the head head of the
[1:48:35] Lamb feel it quiver feel it shake feel
[1:48:38] the life go from it into me yeah it
[1:48:41] takes that to be a Christian yeah how
[1:48:43] does it make you feel when you see him
[1:48:44] on the cross and you realize that's the
[1:48:47] lamb yes that died for my sins good
[1:48:51] brother BR tells us that all emphasis
[1:48:53] should be laid on him yes right you want
[1:48:57] to know what the emphasis ought to be it
[1:48:58] shouldn't be our church it shouldn't
[1:48:59] even be the gifts or or the preacher or
[1:49:02] anything else what should the emphasis
[1:49:03] be on him the
[1:49:06] lamb oh Church like the serpent on the
[1:49:09] pole he was lifted up like the brass
[1:49:11] Serpent and and he said look and live
[1:49:13] and all we have to do is look and
[1:49:15] believe for Heath made him to be sin for
[1:49:18] us who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:49:20] the righteousness of God in him
[1:49:24] Hallelujah Jehovah the Lord my
[1:49:28] righteousness the world sees no Beauty
[1:49:30] in that a person who doesn't realize
[1:49:32] they need a lamb sees no Beauty in a
[1:49:34] lamb caught in the thicket but Abraham
[1:49:37] saw the beauty in it because it was a
[1:49:39] release Hallelujah Isaac saw the beauty
[1:49:42] in it because it was a release from his
[1:49:44] bonds the world sees no Beauty in him
[1:49:47] but look and live Isaiah 53 And1 who has
[1:49:49] believed our report to whom is the arm
[1:49:51] of the Lord revealed for he shall grow
[1:49:53] up before him as a tender plant as a
[1:49:55] root out of dry ground Heath no form nor
[1:49:58] cless so when we shall see him there is
[1:50:00] no beauty that we should desire him he
[1:50:02] is despised and rejected of men a Man of
[1:50:04] Sorrows and coined with grief and we hid
[1:50:06] as it were our faces from him he was
[1:50:08] despised we esteemed him not surely
[1:50:11] Heath borne our griefs and carried our
[1:50:13] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:50:15] smitten of God and Afflicted but he was
[1:50:19] wounded come on church does it mean
[1:50:21] something to you this morning he was
[1:50:23] wounded for our transgression brother
[1:50:24] the BR said every one of us ought to be
[1:50:26] able to put our names there he was
[1:50:28] wounded for Ben through his
[1:50:29] transgression he was BR forb fruits
[1:50:31] iniquities the chastisement of my peace
[1:50:33] was upon him and with his stripes I am
[1:50:41] healed brother brand tells us a
[1:50:44] story about a woman who went into the
[1:50:46] fire for her daughter many of you
[1:50:49] remember it maybe the young ones haven't
[1:50:50] heard it there was a
[1:50:53] a a girl that was coming home from
[1:50:55] college on the train and she was riding
[1:50:58] home and and she got home as she got
[1:51:02] close to home she was riding with a
[1:51:04] friend and her friend looked out on the
[1:51:06] platform waiting she saw a woman who was
[1:51:09] disfigured in her
[1:51:11] face and she says oh my that woman is
[1:51:14] disfigured she said I can't imagine
[1:51:17] whose mother you know that would be I
[1:51:19] can't imagine I'd be so
[1:51:21] embarrassed if that was my
[1:51:24] mother and of course a little girl sit
[1:51:26] beside her she felt the peer pressure of
[1:51:27] that you know and she well I I don't
[1:51:30] know
[1:51:30] her so she gets up on the platform they
[1:51:33] both get up on the platform and the
[1:51:35] mother comes for her daughter and she
[1:51:36] says Hey here I am here I am she was
[1:51:38] going on like she would ignore
[1:51:41] her and the porter was letting the bags
[1:51:45] out the guy would pick up the bags he
[1:51:46] saw it he jumped up on a
[1:51:49] box he said wait a minute he said that
[1:51:53] should aren't you ashamed to be
[1:51:55] ashamed of this woman he said let me
[1:51:58] tell you a story he said one day when
[1:52:01] this little girl was young here she is
[1:52:03] about 20 years old when she was young
[1:52:05] said when she was just a baby said the
[1:52:07] house that they were living in caught on
[1:52:09] fire the kitchen caught on fire the baby
[1:52:11] was upstairs sleeping and she was
[1:52:13] outside putting uh wet laundry on the
[1:52:15] line and said when that house caught on
[1:52:18] fire when she turned around by the time
[1:52:19] she turned around that grease fire had
[1:52:21] grown
[1:52:22] and all she could think to do was take
[1:52:24] that wet laundry and put it over her
[1:52:26] face grap it over herself and run in to
[1:52:30] protect herself and grab the baby but
[1:52:32] coming out she didn't protect herself
[1:52:34] she took that blanket and wrapped it
[1:52:36] around the baby to protect the baby and
[1:52:39] carried her carried her out he said and
[1:52:41] that set baby now this 20-year-old girl
[1:52:43] how can you be ashamed of love like that
[1:52:47] listen to me Church the world may say
[1:52:49] there's nothing to it they may say the
[1:52:50] message is just a bunch of old folies
[1:52:52] may say we're a bunch of holy rollers
[1:52:54] but Christ took my place how can I be
[1:52:57] ashamed of love like that I would have
[1:52:59] been disfigured I would have been there
[1:53:01] I would have be the one that should have
[1:53:03] died I should have been crucified but he
[1:53:05] took my place how can I not love him
[1:53:08] with all of my heart how can I not give
[1:53:10] him everything that I
[1:53:13] have oh he said brother when I see God
[1:53:16] the god of Heaven forfeited his throne
[1:53:18] his Beauty and all that he was to be
[1:53:19] born on the top of a manure pile be
[1:53:21] wrapped in swaddling cloth to be made
[1:53:23] fun of by his signs and his wonders to
[1:53:25] be called a devil should I be ashamed of
[1:53:27] him no sir let the classic world do what
[1:53:30] they want to to me he's a super sign the
[1:53:32] Holy Ghost In Me screams out it might
[1:53:34] make me act funny and be a crazy man by
[1:53:36] this world but I cannot deny him who's
[1:53:38] done so much for me he took my place in
[1:53:40] death he took my place in Calvary he
[1:53:42] done all these things he condescended
[1:53:44] from heaven from the pearly white
[1:53:45] Thrones to become a man to taste my
[1:53:47] suffering to go through my temptation to
[1:53:49] know how to be the right kind of a
[1:53:50] mediator in me to lead me into God gu me
[1:53:52] to eternal life and through his poverty
[1:53:55] I made Rich through his death I'm given
[1:53:57] life eternal life don't deny him don't
[1:54:00] be ashamed of him musicians go ahead and
[1:54:02] come don't don't be ashamed of him but
[1:54:04] Embrace him say yes my dear Lord give to
[1:54:07] me like they did on the day of
[1:54:09] Pentecost give to me the Holy Ghost pour
[1:54:12] it into my heart I don't care what the
[1:54:14] teenagers say I don't care what the
[1:54:16] world says I'm not looking to them I'm
[1:54:18] looking to you I wonder if we can say
[1:54:20] that today look what Paul right he said
[1:54:22] God forbid that I should glow and Sav in
[1:54:25] the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:54:27] whom the world is crucified to me and I
[1:54:30] un to the
[1:54:34] world a man named Isaac was I'm just
[1:54:36] going to read this to you I know it's an
[1:54:38] old old song and hard to sing Isaac was
[1:54:41] was inspired by Paul's words to write
[1:54:43] this When I Survey the Wondrous Cross on
[1:54:46] which the prince of Glory died my
[1:54:48] richest gain I count but loss and poor
[1:54:51] contempt
[1:54:52] on All My Pride forbid it Lord that I
[1:54:55] should boast saving the death of Christ
[1:54:57] my God all the vain things that charm me
[1:55:00] most I sacrificed him to his blood do
[1:55:03] you see the link the sacrifice we
[1:55:06] sacrifice all our dreams all our hopes
[1:55:07] everything to him I am crucified to the
[1:55:10] world and the world to me see from his
[1:55:14] head his hands his feet sorrow and love
[1:55:16] flow mingled down did there such love
[1:55:18] and sorrow meet or Thorn Thorns composed
[1:55:21] so rich the crown I love this last verse
[1:55:24] we the whole realm of nature mind were
[1:55:27] that were present far too small love so
[1:55:30] amazing So Divine demands my soul my
[1:55:34] life my
[1:55:36] all oh
[1:55:38] Church don't be ashamed of him let him
[1:55:42] pour His holy spirit down into your soul
