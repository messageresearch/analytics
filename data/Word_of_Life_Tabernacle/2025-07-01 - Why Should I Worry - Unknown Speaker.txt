========================================

[Music] The storms were raging. The waters around them were trled that night. Fear filled their hearts. They felt they would die. They failed to remember the master was nigh. He spoke the word and the winds all stood still. Even the waters oyed his will and he calm their storms like he will mine if I just remember that he lives inside. So why should I worry? Why should I fear? When this very same Jesus, he is always so near. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. [Music] We read in the Bible how he walked with them, brought light to their darkness when the way grew so dim. How great it would be to have his footsteps in mind, to walk with the master. [Music] all of the time. And when trials come and death seems so nice, just call on the master. He'll be there on time. And when sickness comes and my body's in pain, all I have to do is call on his name. So why should I worry? Why should I fear when this very same Jesus, he is always so near? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by.
