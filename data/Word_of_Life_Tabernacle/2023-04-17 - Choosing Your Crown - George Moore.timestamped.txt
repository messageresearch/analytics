[40:12] a couple of you didn't say Amen
[40:19] Hebrews 11 32.

[40:27] Barrack and of Samson and of jephth of
[40:30] David also and of Samuel and of the
[40:33] prophets who through faith subdued
[40:36] kingdoms brought righteousness obtained
[40:39] promises stop the mouth of lions quench
[40:42] the violence of fire escaped the edge of
[40:44] the sword out of weakness were made

[41:44] should not be made perfect
[41:48] man and over in second Timothy the third
[41:50] chapter while you're turning there let
[41:52] me just ask you this question Saints
[41:54] tonight that passage a scripture that I
[41:57] just read there to you does that sound
[41:59] like a group of people that had it easy
[42:03] does it sound like a group of people
[42:05] that everything was going their way all
[42:07] the time or does it sound like a group
[42:10] of people that never had to fight or
[42:12] never had to never had to push or never
[42:14] got caught in a trap or never had a hard
[42:16] day or anything like that or or does
[42:19] that sound like a people that had to
[42:20] push and strive and try and and and do
[42:24] all they could to try to move up just a
[42:26] little higher in the kingdom of God
[42:28] right second Timothy the third chapter
[42:31] 10th verse but thou has fully known my
[42:34] Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith
[42:37] long-suffering charity patience

[43:14] thereof and we ask oh God you open our

[46:42] of different things you can have people
[46:44] in this church tonight going through a
[46:46] trial of Faith you can have people that
[46:48] that the devil's eating away at they're
[46:50] trying to make them doubt whether this
[46:51] message is even the truth or not whether
[46:53] whether it's even right or not or or or
[46:56] or or maybe better yet if you're like me
[46:58] and you're so far gone that the devil's
[47:00] just kind of give up trying to do that
[47:02] that's what he will tell you is okay the
[47:04] message is right but you're just you're
[47:06] not good enough to live the message
[47:09] so then he tries to cast doubts that
[47:11] you're able to make it wait none of us
[47:13] good enough to live in Saints but he was
[47:15] good enough I'm counting on that tonight

[49:50] people say things sometimes that are not
[49:53] true
[49:54] and and there's it's a helpless feeling
[49:56] also when when somebody said something
[49:58] about you that's not true it hurts yeah
[50:01] you know what even if it's proven out
[50:03] that hey that wasn't the case and it
[50:05] wasn't that was just a lie it still
[50:07] leaves a scar on you
[50:09] these battles and trials and tests that
[50:12] we go through from time to time they
[50:14] leave a scar on us and brother Brown

[50:18] yeah and the longer you go the more
[50:20] things can build up in your life is that
[50:23] right somebody testify with it home well
[50:26] the rest that I've been preaching for
[50:27] years and I've become an old man and an
[50:29] old veteran preacher and I had a lot of
[50:31] hard battles come on somebody that's
[50:33] ever had a hard battle amen
[50:35] and maybe I'm all scarred and cut up on
[50:38] the inside from fights she said because
[50:40] my luck that the lord gave me was not
[50:43] back to kiss the babies and to marry the
[50:45] young and bear the old but it was a
[50:46] whole of two-handed sword at the
[50:48] Battlefront against the walls of
[50:50] paganism and demonology and the powers
[50:52] of darkness and fight it with the word
[50:54] of God till I seen the enemy defeated he
[50:57] said I've been cut deep many times
[51:00] yeah and say so I'll tell you you may
[51:03] not be brother Branham but your call to
[51:05] this same word tonight amen and this
[51:07] ain't no baby kissing religion we got
[51:10] here someone called to kiss the babies
[51:12] and if you believe this message very
[51:15] long there's gonna be some trials yeah
[51:17] there's gonna be some tests
[51:18] amen the devil didn't like this message
[51:20] and he don't like you for believing it
[51:23] and there's going to be time times when
[51:26] your life where you're going to be
[51:27] persecuted with what you believe there's
[51:29] going to be trials for what you believe
[51:31] look I'll go ahead and tell you they
[51:32] didn't call me to to try to find all the
[51:35] mistakes in the message
[51:39] what the prophet said and if you believe
[51:42] that there's going to be some tests
[51:44] there's going to be some trials
[51:48] the trials of life will come the devil
[51:50] don't like this message and he don't
[51:52] like you for believing it and you're
[51:54] called to this very same word yes
[51:59] yes I don't understand how we believe
[52:01] God protected the Bible why we couldn't
[52:02] believe that God protected a message
[52:08] yeah oh come on yeah it's good all right
[52:12] no one who wants it in time brother
[52:14] Brown says this I
[52:18] sex people
[52:21] people just fail to execute good common
[52:23] sense a lot of times
[52:27] let me tell you some states there's only
[52:28] one Jesus Christ tonight
[52:31] amen now God now to Jesus Christ sent a
[52:34] prophet to this age but that Prophet was
[52:36] a man
[52:38] he was a man like you and I
[52:41] yeah amen yeah yeah now brother Brown
[52:43] said I wasn't the one that appeared down
[52:45] on the river that's right that's right I
[52:47] was only standing there when he appeared
[52:50] yeah yeah come on I'm not the one that
[52:53] performs these things and foretells
[52:55] these things that happens as perfect as
[52:57] they are I'm only the one that's near
[52:59] when he does it yeah
[53:02] oh yes
[53:03] I was only a voice that he used to say
[53:06] it it wasn't what I knew it was what I
[53:09] just surrendered myself to
[53:13] remember I said I didn't know those
[53:14] things
[53:15] I just surrendered myself to it yeah now
[53:18] you may not be brother Branham but
[53:20] that's the same thing you got to do to
[53:21] serve the Lord
[53:23] amen if you're a Sunday school teacher
[53:25] you got to surrender yourself to teach
[53:27] Sunday school if you're a musician you
[53:30] gotta surrender yourself just just to
[53:32] play a musical instrument if you're a
[53:34] preacher you got to surrender yourself
[53:35] to preach the gospel right
[53:38] right and then if you shout amen you got
[53:41] to surrender yourself to shout amen
[53:45] come on Amen if you can praise the Lord
[53:47] you've got to surrender yourself to
[53:49] praise the Lord amen if you can clap
[53:51] Hallelujah you gotta surrender yourself
[53:53] to be able to clap
[53:55] [Applause]
[53:57] we had to surrender ourselves and he
[53:59] said that I Just Surrender myself he
[54:02] spoke through he said it isn't me
[54:05] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[54:09] the manifestation of the son of man
[54:13] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[54:17] the mystery that God unfolded
[54:20] it's not a man it's God
[54:24] the angel was not the son of man he was
[54:29] the messenger from the Son of Man
[54:33] why people can't get that straight
[54:35] beyond me
[54:36] the angel was not the son of man he was
[54:40] the messenger from the Son of Man
[54:46] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[54:50] the mystery that God unfolded it's not a
[54:54] man it's God
[54:57] the angel was not the son of man he was
[54:59] the messenger from the son of man the
[55:01] son of man is Christ
[55:04] he's the one you're feeding on
[55:09] you're not feeding on a man his words
[55:12] will fail but you're feeding on the
[55:15] unfailing body word of the son of man
[55:20] thank you Lord yes come on somebody yeah
[55:23] I don't want to give you confidence
[55:25] tonight
[55:26] we're not feeding on a man's word yeah
[55:31] yeah and when you believe it like that
[55:33] Saints there's going to be some scars
[55:35] yes there's gonna be some tests when you
[55:37] hold this two-edged sword it's gonna be
[55:39] some bath you don't hold a sword unless
[55:41] you're going to battle Saints
[55:47] you're going to be under attack
[55:50] there's a lot of them say they believe
[55:52] this word but what they really mean is
[55:53] they just want to listen to a tape yeah
[55:55] but I don't want to just hear a message
[55:58] I want to live a message I want to
[56:01] produce the results the message promised
[56:05] I don't want to say I believe it's I
[56:08] want to act upon what I say I believe if
[56:11] you believe something you act upon it
[56:13] right yes
[56:15] now he says
[56:18] he says Upon This Rock I'll build my
[56:20] church and the gates of hell can I
[56:22] Prevail against you now see Satan hates
[56:25] Revelation worse than anything else
[56:28] if you follow the crowd everything be
[56:30] all right
[56:31] if you do what everybody else is doing
[56:33] all the way everything will be fine but
[56:36] if you ever get a revelation
[56:37] and you stand on the word of God that's
[56:40] when Satan notices what's going on
[56:43] he said so that's when you see why Satan
[56:46] is so against the Book of Revelation
[56:48] anything that's revealed spiritual
[56:50] Revelation Satan is against that's why
[56:53] he's so against the ministry today
[56:56] because what is it the revealing of
[56:59] Christ
[57:00] oh
[57:02] now let the church go on with his great
[57:04] denominations and organizations and its
[57:06] little flowery messages and so forth
[57:10] he said let them go on Satan won't
[57:12] bother that that's right
[57:14] they don't have no troubles he said
[57:16] right
[57:17] everybody Pats them on the back
[57:21] but when there comes a time that God
[57:24] through the Holy Ghost
[57:25] reveals Christ back in the church with
[57:29] power and demonstrations of Healing The
[57:32] Sick and making signs that he said would
[57:35] follow the Believers come to pass then
[57:38] Satan turns over in his bed right yeah
[57:41] so so Brothers said as long as the
[57:43] church goes along dead
[57:45] everything's gonna be all right Satan's
[57:47] not going to bother that but if you let
[57:49] somebody in the church get a revelation
[57:52] yeah you let somebody in the church get
[57:55] a victory you let somebody stand up and
[57:57] shout a little bit you let somebody get
[57:59] excited about something you let somebody
[58:01] be a revelation of what God did for them
[58:04] in this day you let somebody recognize
[58:06] who they are and where they're placed at
[58:09] in the kingdom of God you let somebody
[58:11] start praising or shouting oh yeah
[58:15] you let somebody preach the gospel and
[58:17] heal the sick and do the signs and
[58:19] wonders that God said would happen then
[58:21] Satan turns over brother Branham
[58:24] he does something about it he says until
[58:26] that time Satan don't care how much
[58:28] Church you join he don't care how much
[58:30] but when Christ reveals to you that he's
[58:33] the son of God and the works that he did
[58:35] you do also you know who the you is here
[58:38] come on now you yeah
[58:40] come on yeah
[58:42] when you and it works that he did you do
[58:46] also not some other works but the same
[58:49] Works he that believeth on me Saint John
[58:51] 14 7 he that believeth on me the works
[58:54] that I do shall he do also do the same
[58:57] works and greater than this
[59:02] because Christ could not preach the
[59:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:09] direct quote here Saints Christ could
[59:12] not preach the baptism of holy ghost
[59:14] that would be greater he could not bring
[59:16] it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't
[59:18] been given yet but when Jesus came and
[59:21] sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost
[59:24] returned then they that's you could
[59:27] impart
[59:28] eternal life to the people
[59:35] that's you Saints that's who you are
[59:38] can impart eternal life unto the people
[59:41] that's the greater he said but the signs
[59:44] and wonders Jesus plainly said in Mark
[59:47] 16 go you into all the world preach the
[59:49] gospel to Every Creature out the art all
[59:51] the world how many Every Creature long
[59:53] as the gospel is being preached these
[59:55] signs shall follow them that believe
[59:58] yeah
[1:00:00] and when that becomes the Revelation
[1:00:02] brother you're near the kingdom then
[1:00:07] that's called the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:09] Christ that's in 60 if you want to look
[1:00:11] that up
[1:00:12] when you recognize who you are in the
[1:00:15] kingdom of God when you recognize these
[1:00:17] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:00:19] when you recognize
[1:00:21] that your Greater Works than this shall
[1:00:24] you do yeah
[1:00:26] yeah so if we take a good firm stand on
[1:00:28] every word there then and we believe
[1:00:30] what the Bible says there's going to be
[1:00:32] trials yeah
[1:00:34] yeah but we don't let these trials
[1:00:36] Define who we are yeah yeah we don't let
[1:00:38] these trials make us better or leave a
[1:00:40] scar to the point to where where you get
[1:00:43] cold and indifference and brother
[1:00:44] Brandon says I'm getting old I know that
[1:00:46] and each day I get a new ache and pain
[1:00:49] surely somebody can testify to that
[1:00:53] each day I get a new ache in pain every
[1:00:55] one of us do you might as well tell the
[1:00:58] truth
[1:01:01] and I thought God
[1:01:03] now look here it just dawned on me
[1:01:05] Saints when I after I got over 40. you
[1:01:08] know when you're young you think there's
[1:01:09] always time
[1:01:11] when you when you're young you think you
[1:01:13] always got tomorrow
[1:01:15] but
[1:01:16] but when you when you start to get on up
[1:01:18] there and you get to a certain point you
[1:01:20] realize you only got so many more days
[1:01:23] to serve him you only got so much more
[1:01:25] time to give there's only so many more
[1:01:27] sermons you can preach brother Ben
[1:01:29] there's only so much more time that you
[1:01:31] got that you can give to the Lord
[1:01:32] there's only so many more days in your
[1:01:34] life that you can serve
[1:01:39] and he says
[1:01:43] one of the most miserable things is to
[1:01:46] see a man or a woman who has never
[1:01:48] accepted Christ
[1:01:50] and just lived an old moss-backed church
[1:01:52] member
[1:01:53] meaner than Satan himself
[1:01:58] and to see him out there with a crab at
[1:02:00] Old Something well I'll tell you I don't
[1:02:02] believe any God never he said well
[1:02:04] that's the horriblest crown that Satan
[1:02:06] can Crown a life with
[1:02:09] so he said at mossback church member was
[1:02:13] meaner than Satan himself
[1:02:19] now let's stop right here for just a
[1:02:22] moment one of the worst things that can
[1:02:24] happen to a human being is to get a
[1:02:26] religious spirit
[1:02:28] see many times people are looking for
[1:02:31] the Holy Spirit but they get a religious
[1:02:32] spirit instead and a lot of times
[1:02:35] brother Randolph said you're so vile
[1:02:37] we're so vile in our self that God has
[1:02:40] to give us a new spirit before he can
[1:02:43] ever touch us with his holy spirit
[1:02:46] and so God gives us a new spirit but
[1:02:49] many people confuse the new Spirits with
[1:02:51] the Holy Spirit but that's just a new
[1:02:54] spirit that's just God's got to get us
[1:02:56] to a place where he can give us the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit but the new spirit is not the
[1:03:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:03] and all too often people go on and get a
[1:03:06] religious Spirits rather than getting
[1:03:08] the Holy Spirit and brother Brown says
[1:03:11] it was a religious spirit that crucified
[1:03:13] Jesus
[1:03:16] he said it's a religious people that
[1:03:18] crucifies it's the religious people that
[1:03:20] was against the true Christ it's the
[1:03:23] religious prophets that was against
[1:03:24] Micaiah and it's the religious people of
[1:03:27] the day that's against the message of
[1:03:30] God
[1:03:32] oh that's true and he says I'm not so
[1:03:35] much talking about Catholicism and
[1:03:36] Baptist and Methodist I'm talking about
[1:03:38] people that's Holiness people write down
[1:03:42] these lines here
[1:03:44] amen yeah
[1:03:47] and he goes on he says don't ever
[1:03:49] underestimate Satan's power for
[1:03:51] deceiving
[1:03:52] don't you ever underestimate it he's as
[1:03:54] smooth as he can be and he talks how he
[1:03:58] talks about how Jesus and Judas was in
[1:04:01] the same church he talks about Cain and
[1:04:03] Abel being Brothers he talks about Esau
[1:04:05] and Jacob being Brothers
[1:04:07] is that right yeah
[1:04:09] and he talks about how there's a lie
[1:04:11] that Satan told Eve was 90 the truth
[1:04:16] ninety percent the truth and he says and
[1:04:19] and he said in the lie that you can tell
[1:04:21] he says how I have heard men bypass
[1:04:24] scriptures
[1:04:27] just to keep from hurting their theology
[1:04:29] yes
[1:04:32] yes amen
[1:04:33] a religious spirit it will get on
[1:04:36] somebody and cause them to bypass
[1:04:38] scriptures to keep from hurting their
[1:04:41] theology right right
[1:04:44] it's good he said but see if that part's
[1:04:46] right then this part's right let's put
[1:04:49] it together and make it fit through the
[1:04:51] whole Bible
[1:04:52] [Music]
[1:04:54] amen yeah and how we've seen the same
[1:04:57] thing today in this message where men
[1:05:00] will bypass
[1:05:03] different quotes
[1:05:06] different messages
[1:05:08] different paragraphs because it doesn't
[1:05:11] fit their dots well since we don't line
[1:05:13] up the quotes that fit our Doctrine we
[1:05:15] line up our Doctrine to print the quotes
[1:05:17] yes sir
[1:05:19] and I don't want to be offended at
[1:05:20] anything he said I want to believe
[1:05:22] whatever is said I just want to thank
[1:05:24] him for what he said
[1:05:26] but I'm not going to bypass part of the
[1:05:28] message so that it doesn't offend
[1:05:30] somebody's Doctrine yeah
[1:05:32] come on I don't want to have to skip
[1:05:34] over a bunch of quotes to make it say
[1:05:37] something that it doesn't yeah
[1:05:39] right or wrong Saints
[1:05:41] that's a religious spirit that does that
[1:05:43] yes
[1:05:46] you know people can get a religious
[1:05:48] spirit on
[1:05:50] I don't want to be around somebody like
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:52] when they get this super ultra religious
[1:05:55] spirit about them I want to be around
[1:05:58] people that's the same way every time I
[1:05:59] see them all right I I don't want to be
[1:06:02] one way at church in a different way at
[1:06:04] work and a different way at home I want
[1:06:06] to be the same man all the time I don't
[1:06:09] want to look I don't want to be up here
[1:06:11] preaching the gospel and my kids sitting
[1:06:13] in the Pew saying why won't you listen
[1:06:14] to that
[1:06:19] I wouldn't be the same man I don't want
[1:06:21] to be a different person and I don't
[1:06:23] want to get around somebody and get a a
[1:06:25] a Ultra religious spirit on me
[1:06:28] hey man where you you talk you talk to
[1:06:30] people and they get so sanctimonious and
[1:06:35] I want people to be real
[1:06:37] people be who they are
[1:06:41] oh my
[1:06:42] so we find then brother Brown says this
[1:06:45] now watch this brothers and sisters
[1:06:47] he says and I know someday I Gotta Die
[1:06:50] and he says I hope that God never lets
[1:06:52] Satan Crown me as an old crowded and
[1:06:55] different man
[1:06:57] and my wife an old nagging woman or your
[1:07:00] wife or you that way
[1:07:03] I pray brother
[1:07:05] that our lives will be crowned with the
[1:07:08] fruits of the spirit
[1:07:10] love and joy and long-suffering
[1:07:13] gentleness patience truth faith in the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost
[1:07:19] so brother Brown talks about two
[1:07:21] different kinds of crowns here yeah yes
[1:07:23] there's the crowning of Satan that he
[1:07:25] would put on a man yeah that he would
[1:07:26] put on a woman and then there's the
[1:07:28] crowning of the Holy Spirit and we got a
[1:07:31] choice today of which Crown we choose
[1:07:34] Saints do we want to be crowned a crab
[1:07:36] it old and different religious Spirits
[1:07:39] or we want to be crowned with the Holy
[1:07:41] Spirit yeah come on
[1:07:44] that's our choice
[1:07:46] if you let Satan Crown you this is what
[1:07:48] you get you'll get complexes we talked
[1:07:51] about that this morning I'm not going
[1:07:53] back into complexes but we do know that
[1:07:55] the prophet dealt with complexes we know
[1:07:57] we deal with complexes and sometimes we
[1:08:00] don't deal with our own complex
[1:08:01] sometimes it's complexes that are passed
[1:08:04] down from generation to generation and
[1:08:06] if I if we find out it's also very easy
[1:08:08] for us to build our own complexes
[1:08:11] that's a crowning on our life of the
[1:08:14] devil
[1:08:15] that's right yes
[1:08:17] another crowning that he gives us is
[1:08:19] anxiety
[1:08:22] anxiety
[1:08:23] currently 31 this is pre-coved numbers
[1:08:26] 31 percent United States deal with
[1:08:28] anxiety symptoms
[1:08:30] pre-covet I'll tell you what it didn't
[1:08:32] get no better than Kobe
[1:08:37] now we find it's caused by pressure
[1:08:39] built up on the people and the prophet
[1:08:42] said it's just a built up pressure in
[1:08:43] this age that we're living he talked
[1:08:45] about people going down the road 90
[1:08:47] miles an hour so they could stop and
[1:08:48] drink two hours before they got home
[1:08:50] it's just a pressure and you can feel
[1:08:52] the pressure when you go to Walmart you
[1:08:55] can feel the pressure when you're out in
[1:08:56] the grocery store you can feel pretty at
[1:08:58] work you feel the pressure in our homes
[1:09:00] we feel the pressure it's a pressure on
[1:09:03] the people today when you when you watch
[1:09:05] the news you can feel the pressure from
[1:09:07] that
[1:09:08] uh amen but also Saints you need to
[1:09:12] recognize anxiety that's a modern day
[1:09:14] problem
[1:09:15] now
[1:09:17] years ago people would get upset they
[1:09:19] would have stress and they would have
[1:09:21] tough times and and those type things
[1:09:22] but you never saw the anxiety that we
[1:09:26] see today it's it's everywhere today
[1:09:29] everywhere all the people it's a
[1:09:31] pressure on the people and and it's come
[1:09:34] along and it's increasing in numbers and
[1:09:37] more and more people are dealing with
[1:09:39] anxiety today no doubt there's people in
[1:09:42] this church tonight that deal with
[1:09:43] anxiety in their lives
[1:09:46] yeah that's true now I'll tell you
[1:09:49] something since you saw a big increase
[1:09:51] of it along about the time that this
[1:09:54] thing showed up
[1:09:58] come on breach
[1:10:01] oh you're meddling now preacher
[1:10:07] how long about the time since this thing
[1:10:09] here has become our God
[1:10:12] I'm on preach
[1:10:15] anything that we put ahead of the Lord
[1:10:17] becomes an idol to us is that right
[1:10:19] Saints
[1:10:22] anything that we put ahead of the Lord
[1:10:24] now I I was reading doing some research
[1:10:26] the other day
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:29] you know you find if people leave home
[1:10:32] and and they're coming to church and uh
[1:10:34] and they left their Bible at home they'd
[1:10:37] say
[1:10:38] well it's all right I'm just going to
[1:10:39] church
[1:10:41] and they come on
[1:10:43] but if they left home and they realized
[1:10:45] they left this thing
[1:10:48] yeah they'll be late for church
[1:10:51] because they're gonna turn around go
[1:10:52] back and get it
[1:10:53] right or wrong says
[1:10:57] this thing is it's just gotten a hold of
[1:11:00] everybody you know I travel a lot and I
[1:11:01] I watch people in the airports and so
[1:11:04] forth nobody talks to anybody anymore
[1:11:06] it's if you look across the airport
[1:11:08] almost a hundred percent of the people
[1:11:10] are staring at their phone
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:17] right or wrong since
[1:11:19] and it ain't just kids either
[1:11:21] it's not just young people
[1:11:23] it's young people it's it's middle-aged
[1:11:26] people it's open it's everybody
[1:11:28] it's everywhere
[1:11:31] now
[1:11:32] there was a study done a University
[1:11:34] study and I'm gonna read this to you it
[1:11:36] says increasing evidence suggests that
[1:11:39] the negative effects of smartphone use
[1:11:41] might also extend into the realm of
[1:11:44] Mental Health
[1:11:46] problematic smartphone use compulsive or
[1:11:50] excessive could worsen symptoms of
[1:11:53] anxiety and depression
[1:11:57] huh
[1:11:58] research has found that some individuals
[1:12:01] experience intense anxiety when
[1:12:05] separated from their phones
[1:12:11] intense anxiety when separated from it
[1:12:19] y'all go ahead and get quiet
[1:12:28] anxiety symptoms been separated from and
[1:12:30] some even exhibit
[1:12:32] withdrawal-like symptoms
[1:12:34] like you're coming off a drug
[1:12:38] withdrawal-like symptoms if they can't
[1:12:40] check their device
[1:12:43] given these findings it's possible that
[1:12:46] certain forms of smartphone use could
[1:12:48] cause or worsen symptoms of mental
[1:12:50] illness
[1:12:52] the researchers found that smartphone
[1:12:54] use was in fact associated with symptoms
[1:12:58] of anxiety and depression as well as
[1:13:02] increased experience of stress
[1:13:05] the more participants use their
[1:13:07] smartphones the more likely they were to
[1:13:10] experience symptoms associated with
[1:13:13] these disorders and Report being
[1:13:15] stressed
[1:13:17] now brother George is not up here
[1:13:20] preaching to get rid of your smartphone
[1:13:22] tonight
[1:13:26] but I would ask everyone to examine
[1:13:29] your life
[1:13:32] examine how you're using it yes
[1:13:35] examine what it's doing to you yeah yeah
[1:13:38] is it a look I can take this phone and I
[1:13:41] can read my Bible on it
[1:13:43] I can take this phone and I can listen
[1:13:46] to the message of the hour on it
[1:13:48] I can take this phone in Tucson Arizona
[1:13:52] and I can find out what brother Ben's
[1:13:55] preaching on in Hardy Arkansas
[1:13:59] yes
[1:14:04] but I can also open up a world of Filth
[1:14:09] oh that's right I can let it consume my
[1:14:13] time yeah
[1:14:14] yeah I can let it take away from my
[1:14:16] family
[1:14:17] where my children are around I can let
[1:14:19] it preoccupy me so that I don't spend
[1:14:21] the time investing in my children
[1:14:24] I can let it take my attention away from
[1:14:27] other pressing matters I can I can
[1:14:29] disappear into a hole
[1:14:32] and not deal with the things that's
[1:14:33] right in front of me
[1:14:35] amen I'll tell you Saints
[1:14:39] think about the feeling you get
[1:14:43] when your phone is in your pocket and
[1:14:45] it's on vibrate
[1:14:46] and it goes off
[1:14:49] and you can't check it
[1:14:52] yeah
[1:14:54] that's true come on now it's happened to
[1:14:57] some of y'all in church here tonight
[1:15:05] some of y'all checked your phones
[1:15:06] tonight while you've been in church I
[1:15:07] know you have
[1:15:12] yes it's almost
[1:15:14] consuming
[1:15:17] oh I got a text or something
[1:15:20] somebody called me I wonder who it was
[1:15:24] yeah you know that the phones have been
[1:15:26] designed since a lot of people don't
[1:15:27] know this
[1:15:28] your phone if you don't pick it up and
[1:15:30] check it every so often will notify you
[1:15:33] of something yeah
[1:15:35] to make you pick it up
[1:15:38] it don't like to it's like it's just
[1:15:39] like a child it wants your attention
[1:15:45] that's true
[1:15:48] you set it down for a while and see if
[1:15:50] you don't start getting notifications on
[1:15:51] it
[1:15:53] it's designed that way and I'll tell you
[1:15:55] that will kill your prayer life
[1:15:58] if you're trying to pray with the phone
[1:16:01] in the same room Give It Up
[1:16:03] because if that if you're in prayer and
[1:16:06] that phone vibrates
[1:16:08] you can't think about the prayer anymore
[1:16:13] yeah
[1:16:14] and that's God's time Saints that's
[1:16:18] God's time that you're doing there
[1:16:19] you're taken away from God's time
[1:16:23] leave it in another room or something
[1:16:25] thanks
[1:16:27] this is right around and I say that I
[1:16:30] know this ain't shouting material but
[1:16:33] it causing anxiety amongst the people
[1:16:35] yeah
[1:16:36] it's anxiety when when you when you
[1:16:39] can't check it like you want to it's
[1:16:42] anxiety yeah then when you can check it
[1:16:45] the things that you see are getting us
[1:16:48] worked up yeah
[1:16:49] yeah if you're looking at the news look
[1:16:51] I can tell you don't have to look at the
[1:16:52] news I'll tell you it's all bad
[1:16:54] yes but now here's some good news right
[1:16:57] here
[1:17:00] but if you're looking at CNN or you're
[1:17:02] looking at Fox News or you're looking at
[1:17:04] it's all bad
[1:17:06] and then we're getting ourselves worked
[1:17:08] up but we're getting ourselves stressed
[1:17:09] out worried about what's happening
[1:17:11] Saints yeah
[1:17:16] other smartphone symptoms include poor
[1:17:19] cognitive ability and sleep it actually
[1:17:21] impacts your sleep quality
[1:17:25] thank you
[1:17:25] inability to communicate in face-to-face
[1:17:28] interactions
[1:17:30] now Saints I have seen people be in the
[1:17:33] same room and instead of talking to one
[1:17:36] another they'll text each other
[1:17:39] in the same room
[1:17:44] decrease productivity anxiety driven by
[1:17:48] social media
[1:17:49] and then also obviously accidents on the
[1:17:52] road
[1:17:55] now
[1:17:56] this social media aspect is another can
[1:17:59] of worms that kind of goes along with
[1:18:00] that
[1:18:01] but we find in many times that people uh
[1:18:04] watching social media now again I'm not
[1:18:06] saying brother George is saying not to
[1:18:08] have smartphones he's not saying not to
[1:18:10] have social media I'm saying question
[1:18:12] what it's doing to you yeah yeah and if
[1:18:14] it's more of a hindrance that it is a
[1:18:16] help maybe you need to back off a little
[1:18:17] bit
[1:18:18] but people tie their self-worth to how
[1:18:22] many likes they get on social media yeah
[1:18:25] come on
[1:18:27] people look at social media and they
[1:18:29] compare their life to it many times and
[1:18:31] those things aren't real
[1:18:33] yeah nobody's trusting their real life
[1:18:34] on social media right
[1:18:40] amen it's one of the crownings of the
[1:18:43] devil says it's it's it's it's anxiety
[1:18:46] it's it's depression it's all these
[1:18:49] things that the devil is trying to Crown
[1:18:50] on its complexes all of that it's all
[1:18:53] tied in together and you find 21 million
[1:18:56] diagnosed cases cases of depression in
[1:18:59] the U.S each year pre-covet numbers it
[1:19:03] didn't get any better during covet you

[1:19:07] anxiety he'll Crown you with complexes
[1:19:09] he'll Crown you with depression he'll
[1:19:11] Crown you with hard feelings

[1:19:17] the devil will Crown your life with hard
[1:19:20] feelings and it'll choke the Holy Spirit
[1:19:22] out of your life

[1:19:27] people towards people in our family
[1:19:28] towards people in our church towards
[1:19:31] people we don't even know in some cases
[1:19:33] and it'll build up and Trump the Holy
[1:19:36] Spirit out of a lie
[1:19:37] he'll Crown you with emotional scars
[1:19:40] he'll cram you with temper now brother
[1:19:42] Brown said temper causes cancer
[1:19:45] he'll Crown you with worry brother Brown
[1:19:47] said worry also causes cancer
[1:19:51] worry also causes Amnesia he said yeah
[1:19:55] now Amnesia is what happens when a
[1:19:57] person forgets who they are
[1:20:01] yeah and when you spend your time a
[1:20:03] brother said something to me about that
[1:20:04] earlier when you spend your time

[1:20:41] without the trials I've been through I
[1:20:43] wouldn't be here tonight
[1:20:46] right God used those trials to push me
[1:20:50] and place me and take me where he wanted
[1:20:53] me
[1:20:55] right is that right thanks God uses
[1:20:58] trials for you

[1:21:01] trials praise the Lord
[1:21:04] it's working for your goods
[1:21:07] yes so look God's Prophet had to deal
[1:21:10] with these things we have to deal with
[1:21:12] these things
[1:21:14] Hey Brother Brown talks about one of the
[1:21:16] most horrible things was to see a man or
[1:21:19] woman constantly complaining he said
[1:21:22] he said I've always thought God keep me
[1:21:24] from it it weakens Faith all the time
[1:21:26] when we complain it weakens our faith
[1:21:30] all the time
[1:21:33] and he said you know as I get older each
[1:21:35] one of us we're going to get something
[1:21:36] happen and something happened and I know
[1:21:39] these little things are going to keep
[1:21:40] accumulating yeah yeah these trials yeah
[1:21:43] yeah these Stars
[1:21:45] as we get older they keep accumulating
[1:21:48] yes
[1:21:50] they keep building up and build up and
[1:21:52] build up
[1:21:54] and he says but I just think one of the
[1:21:56] most horrible things is for Satan to
[1:21:59] Crown someone's life
[1:22:01] a cram at old man or a woman you see I
[1:22:04] hope that thou don't get to that place I
[1:22:06] hope that I can bear it my burdens
[1:22:09] and get to a spot to where I want my
[1:22:12] life crowned with the glory of God
[1:22:16] his long suffering yes gentleness peace
[1:22:20] meekness and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:22:23] yes and he talks about how one of the
[1:22:25] main things that's always bothered him
[1:22:26] was a nervous condition and he said he
[1:22:29] got real weary and he feel like nobody
[1:22:31] cared for him
[1:22:33] uh he said none of that is true yeah
[1:22:36] yeah all of us have got to a place to
[1:22:39] where we think nobody cares about us
[1:22:41] nobody cares for me everybody's nobody
[1:22:43] nobody loves me he said none of that is
[1:22:46] true right
[1:22:51] right rest assured denied those Saints
[1:22:53] God does not want you dealing with these
[1:22:55] things yeah God doesn't want you dealing
[1:22:58] with anxiety right he doesn't want you
[1:23:00] dealing with depression he doesn't want
[1:23:02] you dealing with complexes he doesn't
[1:23:04] want you dealing with the root of
[1:23:05] bitterness in your life God doesn't want
[1:23:07] that for us y'all believe that's not
[1:23:08] Saints
[1:23:09] say brother Brown said God don't want
[1:23:12] you to be frowning God wants you to be
[1:23:15] happy
[1:23:17] the human heart was made to be happy
[1:23:20] worry will cause cancer temper will
[1:23:23] cause cancer don't ever be upset he said
[1:23:25] just walk in his love knowing that
[1:23:29] you're walking in him and nothing can
[1:23:33] harm you
[1:23:35] yeah thank you Lord
[1:23:37] anxiety is not God's will for you
[1:23:40] depression is not God's will for you
[1:23:43] right right complexes are not God's will
[1:23:45] for you hard feelings are not God's will
[1:23:48] for you
[1:23:49] amen the root of bitterness is not God's
[1:23:51] will for you God's will is for you to be
[1:23:54] happy
[1:23:56] is that what he said Thank You Lord
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:03] and the only way we can be happy tonight
[1:24:05] the only way we can live this life
[1:24:09] is by the Holy Spirit living through us
[1:24:13] oh yes
[1:24:14] now brother Brown talked about those
[1:24:16] Gentiles or not brother brand of the
[1:24:18] Romans the second chapter talks about
[1:24:20] those Gentiles Paul talking about it
[1:24:21] that that that we're living a law
[1:24:25] without living the law yeah yeah they
[1:24:27] were Gentiles
[1:24:29] and they had a set of laws that they had
[1:24:31] to obey uh the the Jewish people did but
[1:24:34] the Gentiles weren't under those laws
[1:24:37] but their nature by their nature they
[1:24:40] were just living that law
[1:24:42] right yeah why because it was on the
[1:24:45] inside
[1:24:47] is that right thanks
[1:24:49] It Was Written in their hearts Paul said
[1:24:51] yeah he said their conscience was
[1:24:53] bearing witness their thoughts that the
[1:24:55] meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
[1:24:57] another he said he said for when the
[1:25:00] Gentiles which have not the law do by
[1:25:03] Nature the things contained in the law
[1:25:06] they're just nature
[1:25:09] is that right Saints now the Bible says
[1:25:12] that when the spirit of Truth has come
[1:25:14] he'll guide you in all truth
[1:25:17] so don't tell me you got the Holy Spirit
[1:25:19] and living a filthy life
[1:25:20] because the Holy Spirit won't leave
[1:25:22] somebody to live a filthy life
[1:25:24] don't say you got the holy spirit
[1:25:26] because you because you listen to a tape
[1:25:29] yeah
[1:25:30] don't say you got the holy spirit
[1:25:31] because you believe the message all
[1:25:34] right across a bunch of Baptists that
[1:25:36] said they believed
[1:25:38] but they didn't have the Holy Spirit
[1:25:39] they didn't even know what he was
[1:25:41] talking about
[1:25:43] he said oh I believe the message I got
[1:25:44] it no
[1:25:46] no
[1:25:48] they asked brother Branham that
[1:25:50] come on he said they said brother Brown
[1:25:52] do our grandchildren hurt our children
[1:25:54] do they he said do they have to have the
[1:25:56] Holy Spirit or if they just believe the
[1:25:59] message of the hour is that enough
[1:26:01] said they got to come the same way you
[1:26:04] did
[1:26:07] people say oh I believe the message will
[1:26:08] believe in the message and receiving the
[1:26:10] Holy Ghost is two different things
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:17] now people that have the Holy Ghost make
[1:26:19] mistakes
[1:26:21] people that had Holy Ghost are perfect
[1:26:22] but what the Holy Ghost does is put a
[1:26:25] desire in a Believer to feed on the
[1:26:27] things of God
[1:26:29] and if you have a desire the more desire
[1:26:31] you have defeat on the things of God the
[1:26:34] more Godly you will become yes oh yes
[1:26:40] now the prophet clearly explained this
[1:26:42] he said the new birth is a mystery to
[1:26:44] the people
[1:26:45] they can't understand it they don't know
[1:26:47] what they mean but they have they
[1:26:49] belittled it to bring it down they said
[1:26:50] well just because you believe something
[1:26:51] he said the Devils believe the same
[1:26:53] thing and tremble yeah it isn't what you
[1:26:57] believe it's what God has actually done
[1:27:01] yeah
[1:27:03] amen yeah yeah Saints the holy spirit is
[1:27:06] the answer
[1:27:08] the Holy Ghost is the answer to
[1:27:10] complexes the Holy Ghost is the answer
[1:27:13] to anxiety the Holy Ghost is the answer
[1:27:16] to depression the Holy Ghost is the
[1:27:20] answer to the root of bitterness
[1:27:23] thank you Lord it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:27:25] to sweeten our life yes amen now you can
[1:27:28] have the Holy Spirits and still have
[1:27:31] these things crop up in your life that's
[1:27:33] why we got to have baptism after baptism
[1:27:37] of the Holy Spirit yes that's why we got
[1:27:39] to have a re-baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:43] a re-filling of the Holy Spirit you
[1:27:46] can't stop Saints you can't get it once
[1:27:49] and be done
[1:27:51] because these things continue to
[1:27:53] accumulate yes
[1:27:56] so it's a it's a daily process I Die
[1:27:59] daily
[1:28:01] a daily process of dying out to the
[1:28:04] things of the world dying out to sin
[1:28:06] dying out to complexes on a daily
[1:28:09] process of filling back up yeah
[1:28:13] with the things of God
[1:28:15] amen
