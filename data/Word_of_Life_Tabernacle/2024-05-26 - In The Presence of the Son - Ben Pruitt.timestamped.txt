[55:15] it's important for me to understand and
[55:17] so I maybe you'll receive something from
[55:19] it as well and so I want to preach in
[55:22] the presence of the Sun in the presence
[55:25] of the Sun the o n son Joel 223 be glad
[55:30] then you children of Zion and rejoice in
[55:33] the Lord your God how many can Rejoice
[55:35] this morning in the Lord he said for
[55:38] Heath given you the former Reign
[55:41] moderately he will cause to come down
[55:43] for you the rain the former rain and the
[55:46] latter rain in the first month the flo
[55:50] should be full of wheat the fat shall
[55:53] overflow with wine and
[55:55] oil I love that I will restore to you
[55:59] the years that the Locust ha eaten the
[56:01] cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer
[56:03] worm my great Army which I sent among
[56:06] you you shall eat in plenty and be
[56:09] satisfied and praise the name of the
[56:12] Lord your God that has dealt wondrously
[56:14] with you and my people are you his
[56:17] people this morning my people shall
[56:20] never be ashamed the Lord would add his
[56:23] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[56:25] this morning
[56:30] one of the Bible's simplest and yet most
[56:33] important types is the grain of wheat
[56:36] grain of
[56:37] wheat and to understand the type of the
[56:40] grain of wheat I think we have to
[56:42] understand it in a Biblical mindset as
[56:45] they would have understood it when Jesus
[56:48] first spoke it to them and as they would
[56:50] have understood it in the land of Israel
[56:52] brother brandom says this about that he
[56:54] said as a boy preacher I used to try to
[56:56] wonder what these Parables meant he said
[57:00] I never could understand it just right
[57:03] until once I visited the Eastern
[57:05] countries he said the Bible is a Eastern
[57:08] book and we're trying to understand it
[57:10] by a western understanding he said when
[57:13] you go east it becomes a different book
[57:15] to you because it's wrote in the light
[57:17] of Eastern knowledge and so we have to
[57:20] understand it in that light now Israel
[57:23] has an interesting climate because crofs
[57:25] are actually grown in Israel in the
[57:28] winter and harvested in the spring so
[57:31] it's much like our wheat today our
[57:34] winter wheat that we have that would
[57:35] actually be planted in November or
[57:38] December and then come up in May and
[57:40] June and that's the way their wheat crop
[57:42] would be and also their barley crop
[57:44] barley takes a little less time to grow
[57:47] so barley would be harvested around the
[57:49] time of Passover and that would be the
[57:51] very beginning of the wheat Harvest as
[57:53] well and then the wheat Harvest wouldn't
[57:55] end until
[57:56] right after Pentecost and so th those
[57:59] were uh it's a different uh mindset than
[58:02] what we would have like we would think
[58:04] about Harvest being a time in the fall
[58:06] when the air is crisp and and people are
[58:08] drinking apple cider and we're having
[58:10] fall festivals and things like that but
[58:13] that's actually not the time when uh
[58:16] when they would Harvest something they
[58:17] would Harvest this is important this
[58:19] morning they would harvest in the very
[58:21] hottest part of the year as the sun was
[58:24] reaching its full strength that was when
[58:27] they would Harvest their crops now
[58:29] there's three things are you are we all
[58:31] awake this morning the storms didn't
[58:33] keep you up all night all right there's
[58:35] three things that are required to have a
[58:38] crop of wheat that's the seed right the
[58:41] rain all right and the
[58:44] sun those three things are required in
[58:47] order to have a crop of Wheat and we
[58:49] know that the seed has got to be planted
[58:52] in the ground and so Jesus tells us that
[58:55] in John 12:2 for verily verily I say un
[58:58] you except a corn of wheat fall in the
[58:59] ground and die it abides alone but if it
[59:02] dies it bringeth forth much fruit so
[59:06] it's meant to produce more uh more in
[59:09] number but exactly the same in
[59:11] characteristic as it was when it was
[59:14] planted so the seed was planted with him
[59:17] in burial raised with him with Christ on
[59:20] the third day and then displayed in its
[59:22] maturity on the day of Pentecost right
[59:25] so it was displayed in its maturity in
[59:27] Christ as a as a first fruits and then
[59:30] it was displayed in Pentecost as Bread
[59:33] on his table and so that bride at
[59:35] Pentecost was a mature bride all right
[59:39] yet it was not the end state that he
[59:41] desired because there had to be a
[59:43] gentile bride and we know that the 120
[59:46] were Jews right so there had to be a
[59:49] gentile bride you were in his mind
[59:52] before the foundation of the world and
[59:54] I'm so glad to hear that today I'm so
[59:55] glad to know that it gives me great
[59:57] comfort and Assurance I don't just say
[59:59] that to make you feel good we say that
[1:00:01] because the Bible says that because a
[1:00:03] prophet taught us
[1:00:05] that so the seed then had to be planted
[1:00:08] in burial raised on the third day
[1:00:10] displayed in
[1:00:11] maturity so the bride at Pentecost was
[1:00:14] not the end state that he desired but
[1:00:16] you are the end state if we can say it
[1:00:18] that way of what he desired you and I
[1:00:22] are what he wanted to see the whole time
[1:00:24] now we know that that had to be buried
[1:00:27] it was meant to be buried brother B said
[1:00:29] it was buried in a Roman Cathedral it
[1:00:31] was buried during the Dark Ages during
[1:00:33] we could say the winter time it was
[1:00:35] planted and it began to sprout in
[1:00:37] Luther's time 500 years ago God takes
[1:00:41] his time right so this is a long-term
[1:00:44] crop right we get in a hurry but God
[1:00:46] don't get in a hurry sir right God has a
[1:00:49] longterm Vision he's got a longterm
[1:00:51] you're looking at tomorrow you're
[1:00:53] looking at your bank account you're
[1:00:54] looking at what's happening you're
[1:00:55] looking at at this the the job that you
[1:00:57] need you're looking at this side or the
[1:00:58] other but God's taking a Long View he's
[1:01:02] been growing this crop for a long time
[1:01:04] but the allien is not going to fail
[1:01:06] right there's not going to be a crop
[1:01:08] failure in this age there there may have
[1:01:10] been crop failures in other ages there
[1:01:12] may have been life that passed on
[1:01:14] through but this is the end State this
[1:01:16] is the very end of what he wanted at the
[1:01:20] beginning so now it had to begin to
[1:01:24] sprout and and We Know by where W time
[1:01:26] it looked like a wheat
[1:01:27] plant you can go out there and say we
[1:01:29] got a crop of wheat but you didn't
[1:01:32] really have any Wheat at all you had a
[1:01:34] stalk you had a you had a sprout but you
[1:01:37] didn't have wheat and then it be to
[1:01:39] sprout but yet there was life there that
[1:01:42] would become wheat but now by by West's
[1:01:45] time it become a wheat plant the time of
[1:01:47] the Pentecostal Revival of 1906 it had
[1:01:50] formed a husk that looked like a wheat
[1:01:54] seed that went into the
[1:01:57] ground I want to ask you a question I
[1:02:00] posed this question before but what
[1:02:02] would the church at the end time look
[1:02:05] the most like of all of the preceding
[1:02:08] churches all right it think about it
[1:02:11] there's a stalk there's a tossle there's
[1:02:13] a husk what is the church going to look
[1:02:16] the most like a Pentecostal church right
[1:02:20] right cuz the church that went in the
[1:02:21] ground had to Die the shuck looks like
[1:02:24] that it's not the week
[1:02:26] right but it looks like the wheat and
[1:02:29] conversely the wheat looks like it yeah
[1:02:32] so the bride will not look like a
[1:02:33] babtist denomination right come on right
[1:02:36] you you wouldn't be deceived by that
[1:02:38] right no one would be deceived by that
[1:02:40] but what was the deception coming
[1:02:41] Pentecost because it was almost like the
[1:02:44] real right because they shouted and you
[1:02:46] shout and they have they worship and you
[1:02:48] worship and and and they have gifts and
[1:02:50] you have gifts but that's the deception
[1:02:53] that comes so you say well let's just go
[1:02:54] back and be Lutheran again no I want the
[1:02:57] real thing on I want the gifts I want
[1:02:59] them in order but I want the gifts I I
[1:03:01] want the worship I want in order but I
[1:03:04] want the worship I don't want to ever
[1:03:05] lose my
[1:03:06] worship I don't want to ever lose the
[1:03:08] powerful preaching of the word I don't
[1:03:10] want to ever lose the power of the Holy
[1:03:12] Ghost that can come down and change your
[1:03:14] life
[1:03:15] instantly yes sir we're not Baptist
[1:03:19] right we're not methodists we're not
[1:03:21] Pentecostals right but we've we but we
[1:03:24] look more like
[1:03:26] a Pentecostal church right right because
[1:03:30] that's the age we're living in is the
[1:03:32] time of the grain now everybody
[1:03:34] understand that right you can argue with
[1:03:36] me about it
[1:03:37] later now so H it formed a husk looked
[1:03:43] like a grain of wheat but it was
[1:03:44] not but then what has to happen now
[1:03:47] that's the seed but in order for that
[1:03:48] all to take place in order for it to
[1:03:51] become the wheat there had to be rain
[1:03:54] all right right right so the first part
[1:03:56] there had to be a seed right you're the
[1:03:59] seed of God but to order to make you
[1:04:02] what God wants you to be order for you
[1:04:04] to manifest the the the thing that the
[1:04:07] code that God has put in your life the
[1:04:08] DNA that he's put down on the inside you
[1:04:11] know there's DNA inside of you that come
[1:04:13] from your parents you look like a Shamel
[1:04:14] or you look like a prud God help us you
[1:04:17] know you
[1:04:18] look you look like that it's just DNA
[1:04:20] that's coated down on the inside of you
[1:04:22] but you realize that in the seat of God
[1:04:25] there's actual DNA coded in there that's
[1:04:28] that spiritual DNA that actually makes
[1:04:30] you look like Christ and as it matures
[1:04:33] and as it grows out it actually makes
[1:04:35] you look like Jesus did look like a
[1:04:37] Christian so so now we find that it
[1:04:40] takes rain to do that to bring that out
[1:04:42] of your life and rain falls on the just
[1:04:47] and the
[1:04:48] unjust and it's the same rain right rain
[1:04:52] is the holy spirit falling on the Earth
[1:04:55] yesen
[1:04:56] amen I'm glad for the rain we need the
[1:04:59] rain right and we've had a rain in our
[1:05:02] day I want to talk about that for a
[1:05:03] moment deal with that because I have to
[1:05:04] in order to get where I want to go this
[1:05:06] morning I appreciate you being patient
[1:05:08] with me in Joel chapter 2 we haven't
[1:05:11] started preaching yet in Joel chapter 2
[1:05:13] verse 23 he said be glad then you
[1:05:15] Children Of Z rejoice in the Lord your
[1:05:17] God he has given you the former Reign
[1:05:19] moderately that doesn't mean in measure
[1:05:21] it means Faithfully he's given you the
[1:05:23] former Reign Faithfully as he said he
[1:05:25] would
[1:05:26] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:05:27] the rain the former rain and the latter
[1:05:30] rain in the first month right so he said
[1:05:32] you're going to have an extra blessing
[1:05:34] you've had a former Reign but here at
[1:05:36] the end time you're going to have the
[1:05:37] former reain and the latter rain
[1:05:40] together right brother the brandom
[1:05:41] taught us that the former rain brother
[1:05:44] brandham brought it out he said that's
[1:05:45] the Greek or the Hebrew word Mor which
[1:05:48] is or Mora which is teacher or teaching
[1:05:50] rain the teaching rain as they would
[1:05:53] call it it's the rain that began when
[1:05:55] that when that first began to sprout it
[1:05:57] needed a rain on it so it didn't die
[1:05:59] immediately just like when you plant a
[1:06:01] flower you need to water it right you
[1:06:03] need rain on it when they would plant
[1:06:05] their crops they needed that beginning
[1:06:06] rain because the sun would would would
[1:06:09] cause it to wither and die so they
[1:06:11] needed a rain and it's a teaching rain
[1:06:14] because it happens during the infancy of
[1:06:16] the plant everybody with me so far so
[1:06:19] the teaching rain is what brought it up
[1:06:22] what brought it up it's a rain of the
[1:06:23] Holy Spirit but it's in teaching yeah
[1:06:26] so the promise uh and and the latter
[1:06:29] rain and the former rain coming together
[1:06:31] that word that latter rain is actually a
[1:06:33] word that it's for strengthening and
[1:06:35] maturing
[1:06:36] crops and it's opposed it's opposite the
[1:06:40] spring rain latter rain is literally a
[1:06:43] type of the king's favor I like that
[1:06:46] it's a type of the king's favor that
[1:06:48] there would be a lad rain and especially
[1:06:50] a former Reign and a latter Reign
[1:06:51] together at the end time so the promise
[1:06:53] was that both Reigns would fall all
[1:06:55] together in the harvest season producing
[1:06:57] a bumper crop and people can say what
[1:07:00] they want to but if the word of God is
[1:07:02] right you're a bumper
[1:07:05] crop you're not a halfway crop you're
[1:07:08] not somebody that's stuck in the past
[1:07:10] somewhere and unable you're not somebody
[1:07:11] we have to beat constantly to try to get
[1:07:13] you to obey but you're a bumper crop if
[1:07:15] you're the Bride of Jesus
[1:07:17] Christ something's happening in your
[1:07:21] life so so it's a it produces a bumper
[1:07:25] crop now
[1:07:26] now brother B says if you want a church
[1:07:29] start with the word of
[1:07:31] God oh Lord help us today he said if you
[1:07:35] want a life of God start with the word
[1:07:38] of God you young people you want a life
[1:07:40] of God you want a life that you where
[1:07:42] you'll walk with God where you won't be
[1:07:44] deceived by the devil what do you do
[1:07:45] start with the word of God if you want a
[1:07:49] life of God start with the word of God
[1:07:51] accept the word of God in its fullness
[1:07:54] all right every measure of it except the
[1:07:58] word of God oh my except all that the
[1:08:01] word is in its fullness every measure of
[1:08:03] it he said and if that is the fullness
[1:08:05] of God in you I like that he said then
[1:08:08] the rain that's falling sir will produce
[1:08:12] exactly what's in your
[1:08:16] garden right so if you're a wheat seed
[1:08:19] The rain that's falling will produce a
[1:08:21] wheat seed if you're a tear the rain
[1:08:24] that's falling will produce a tear but
[1:08:27] oh my if you're the genuine wheat it'll
[1:08:31] produce the Life of Christ to the people
[1:08:33] around you and they won't have to wonder
[1:08:36] but they'll look at your life and they
[1:08:37] say they've been with Jesus they love
[1:08:39] like Jesus they they talk like Jesus
[1:08:42] they walk like Jesus they the the signs
[1:08:45] follow them they believe they they're
[1:08:46] they're they're Jesus on the
[1:08:48] Earth are you with me now if it's the
[1:08:52] fullness of God in you it'll bring out
[1:08:54] it'll produce exact what's in your
[1:08:56] garden now I'm just hitting the
[1:08:58] highlights to this you can go study it
[1:09:00] yourself if you study the former and the
[1:09:02] latter rain but I got to explain this
[1:09:03] before we can go any further brother
[1:09:05] brandom says that he tells us that the
[1:09:07] Billy Graham and the Pentecostals and
[1:09:08] the word were all sown in the
[1:09:11] world so the the intellectual Faith was
[1:09:14] sown the Pentecostal Faith was sown that
[1:09:17] seed was swn and he said the word was
[1:09:20] sown amen right now he said what's the
[1:09:23] matter now he talking about the world
[1:09:26] she's now waiting for the latter rain
[1:09:28] that's when she produces her fruits and
[1:09:31] the kind of seed you have planted in
[1:09:32] your field will be the kind of crop you
[1:09:34] will
[1:09:35] reap if the denomination wants more
[1:09:37] members that's what they're going to
[1:09:39] get he said that's what they've gotten
[1:09:42] the Pentecostal wants more Pentecostals
[1:09:43] that's what they're going to
[1:09:45] get right but the
[1:09:47] word oh this gives me great
[1:09:50] confidence see I don't have to
[1:09:53] produce the Life of Christ in you all I
[1:09:56] have to do is preach the word because
[1:09:59] when the word is preached under the
[1:10:01] anointing of the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:10:03] produce the word in you because it's
[1:10:06] already in you to become that the
[1:10:09] Pentecostals want more Pentecostals but
[1:10:11] the word is going to produce Sons and
[1:10:13] Daughters of God he said that's coming
[1:10:16] too oh we seing the fruit of
[1:10:19] denominationalism we've seen what it's
[1:10:21] become but we've also seen the fruit of
[1:10:24] the word
[1:10:26] are you with me so
[1:10:28] far so brother R talks about the latter
[1:10:31] rain movement how many have ever heard
[1:10:32] of the latter rain movement in
[1:10:34] Pentecost I I I'll speak to the resue
[1:10:37] some of you Elders raise your hand but
[1:10:39] you don't see them much anymore the
[1:10:41] latter rain Amy simple mcferson was
[1:10:43] latter
[1:10:44] rain and so believe she was four square
[1:10:46] but she was part of that movement all
[1:10:47] the it was a movement that began it
[1:10:50] began in Van in Vancouver at brother
[1:10:53] brandom's meeting when he had it in 19
[1:10:55] 47 some people I believe from Edmonton
[1:10:58] or somewhere came to Vancouver and they
[1:11:00] saw uh the the power of brother Brand's
[1:11:03] meeting at that time this is even before
[1:11:05] we had tapes and they saw the power of
[1:11:07] God the rain that was falling on that
[1:11:10] meeting and they looked at that and said
[1:11:12] well praise God you know it's time so
[1:11:15] what they did is they went and started a
[1:11:18] denomination went and found a group of
[1:11:20] people and they all got together started
[1:11:21] praying and asking for gifts and things
[1:11:23] and they got them yeah but but brother
[1:11:26] Brandon said it wasn't the right thing
[1:11:29] at the right time what it actually did
[1:11:32] is produced another organization but
[1:11:35] brother said it fizzled out and died
[1:11:38] because it wasn't the hour for
[1:11:40] organization it was the hour for the
[1:11:42] word but it was produced out of brother
[1:11:44] bram's meetings they produced brother
[1:11:47] Bram said it was the right
[1:11:49] rain on the wrong
[1:11:52] seed the right rain on on the wrong
[1:11:56] seat brother man said the two
[1:11:58] denominational kinds you understand the
[1:12:00] two denominational kinds will unite
[1:12:01] together and go to Sodom that's the
[1:12:03] Billy Graham and the Oral Roberts he
[1:12:05] said but the word will stay with the
[1:12:08] elected the Royal seat right he said as
[1:12:11] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:12:12] be in the coming of the son of man so
[1:12:16] brother Randon refers to his ministry
[1:12:18] and he talks about the latter rain move
[1:12:20] they didn't they didn't comprehend that
[1:12:22] God was doing something but he was doing
[1:12:23] something through a prophet it wasn't
[1:12:25] just making somebody a prophet it wasn't
[1:12:28] just gift falling the congregation but
[1:12:30] God was doing something in a prophet and
[1:12:32] through a prophet and so brother BR
[1:12:34] refers to his ministry as the former
[1:12:36] latter Reigns in uh in 1960 in
[1:12:38] discernment of spirit he said the former
[1:12:40] Reign running first the first rain we've
[1:12:42] had here comes the latter rain coming
[1:12:44] over the former rain coming over the
[1:12:46] latter rain East and West meeting
[1:12:48] together both Reigns falling together he
[1:12:52] said Divine Healing plus the angel of
[1:12:54] God revealing the secrets of the hearts
[1:12:57] and bringing everything to pass oh he
[1:13:00] said it looks like trueborn children of
[1:13:01] God would see
[1:13:02] that so watch you had a Divine Healing
[1:13:05] you had you had the angel revealing the
[1:13:08] secrets of the hearts the first and
[1:13:09] second poles and it it was the rain
[1:13:12] falling together he said you it looks
[1:13:15] like trueborn children of God would see
[1:13:18] that yeah but now they missed it now
[1:13:21] look the teaching rign came and the the
[1:13:25] latter rain came in the same season
[1:13:27] right right but they missed the teaching
[1:13:30] rain and wanted the latter rain right
[1:13:33] right they they didn't get the teaching
[1:13:35] rign and really it was both together and
[1:13:38] it comes in this message just just just
[1:13:40] to tell you where I'm going this message
[1:13:43] fulfilled that scripture of the former
[1:13:45] and latter Reign I've got to quote on
[1:13:47] that after a while now both Reigns
[1:13:49] falling together now the B said in other
[1:13:51] words it'll be a teaching rain and a
[1:13:52] harvest rain now we've had the teaching
[1:13:54] rain and we're ready now for the Harvest
[1:13:56] rain he said you know the first rain is
[1:13:58] when you plant the seed that starts your
[1:13:59] crop growing just before it matures
[1:14:01] there comes another crop that's what
[1:14:03] they call the Harvest rain you said we
[1:14:04] know when it is the spring rains and
[1:14:06] then the rains about June it makes your
[1:14:08] crop that's Harvest Time so what would
[1:14:11] happen is that the seed would be planted
[1:14:14] in the winter and it would come up and
[1:14:17] it would actually reach a place a time
[1:14:19] of harvest and when it reached a time of
[1:14:22] harvest in the spring in the late spring
[1:14:25] would actually be another rain and what
[1:14:26] was the purpose of that rain if they
[1:14:28] didn't get the the ladder rain the
[1:14:30] Harvest rain that the crop would
[1:14:33] actually never become a bumper crop
[1:14:36] right it would just be another crop
[1:14:38] right right but in order for it to be a
[1:14:40] bumper crop the rain had to fall
[1:14:42] together right so if you got extra rain
[1:14:45] oh my extra rain in the harvest season
[1:14:49] would produce a bumper crop because what
[1:14:51] it would do is those those wheat seeds
[1:14:54] would then soak up that moisture right
[1:14:57] and have enough
[1:14:59] moisture oh Church to make it through
[1:15:03] the dry time all right because the heat
[1:15:05] of the sun was fixing to come over the
[1:15:08] sun was about to be revealed in its
[1:15:10] fullness and for that time there needed
[1:15:13] to be a former and a latter rain so oh
[1:15:15] my so that during the hot time during
[1:15:18] the dry time the the the seed would
[1:15:21] still be in Revival if you can crack it
[1:15:23] open it's still growing it's still has
[1:15:25] moisture it still has life why sir it
[1:15:28] had the former and the latter
[1:15:30] rain right are you with me
[1:15:33] now amen now he said about
[1:15:38] June said makes your crop he said and
[1:15:43] and now the rain we find out was the
[1:15:45] spirit and now we left off he said where
[1:15:47] I gave my thoughts of what a whole thing
[1:15:49] will be so that is I believe the rain
[1:15:50] has been brought the rain the reason
[1:15:52] we're quietening down the grounds SED
[1:15:55] over you can't find anywhere hardly but
[1:15:57] what's been seed went out through radio
[1:16:00] television tape word everything it seed
[1:16:02] the country down it planted seeds now
[1:16:05] what seeds was planted he said you
[1:16:07] cannot get nothing else from it but what
[1:16:09] seeds that was
[1:16:11] planted listen if you don't lay in the
[1:16:13] word you're not going to become the
[1:16:16] word you can't get nothing from it but
[1:16:19] what seeds was planted he see can you
[1:16:21] understand now it'll be the seeds that's
[1:16:22] planted he said now the spirit will fall
[1:16:25] but it'll bring a harvest of the seed
[1:16:29] that it falls
[1:16:30] on he said now again he said now we said
[1:16:33] this is spoken word of the Original Seed
[1:16:35] he said we said in the last days Joel
[1:16:36] told us the other part of the scriptures
[1:16:37] listen close now there would be a former
[1:16:39] and latter rain in the same season he
[1:16:41] goes through all that and in fact
[1:16:43] brother BR said there was a communist
[1:16:44] Reign a Roman Reign a Roman Revival A
[1:16:47] Reign is a Revival a communist Revival a
[1:16:50] Roman Revival he said there's a revival
[1:16:52] going on what is it a sewing you said
[1:16:54] you don't hear very much of Billy Graham
[1:16:56] no more what about Ora what about the
[1:16:57] rest of them you know the great Revival
[1:16:59] fire not burning what is it it's the end
[1:17:01] time seed sign words say been swn what
[1:17:03] is it denomination will reap
[1:17:04] denomination makes some Confederate
[1:17:07] themselves together this parts from the
[1:17:09] end time sign seed he said but the word
[1:17:11] of God has been sewed also and when the
[1:17:13] spirit of God begins to fall the word of
[1:17:16] God will live in the people come on oh
[1:17:20] that's my prayer today I pray Lord won't
[1:17:22] you live in my life
[1:17:25] amen he said and that false bride that's
[1:17:28] committed adultery out there brought
[1:17:29] herself into Creeds and sold out her
[1:17:30] birth rights will reap what a
[1:17:32] confederation of church is to be B bound
[1:17:35] and burned like the thorns and thistles
[1:17:37] but where the word of God has been sewed
[1:17:39] into the people's heart oh I pray this
[1:17:41] would be a place where the word of God
[1:17:43] would be sowed into the hearts of people
[1:17:45] he said where the word of God has been
[1:17:46] swn in the people's heart it will reap a
[1:17:48] bride for Christ as certain as I'm
[1:17:50] standing
[1:17:53] here my brother random tells us that
[1:17:56] 1906 Pentecost was not the final
[1:17:58] quickening was not the latter rign
[1:18:01] because they never had a teaching rign
[1:18:03] right right so it couldn't be the latter
[1:18:05] rank because they were both falling the
[1:18:06] same
[1:18:07] season he said this age started just
[1:18:09] after the turn of the 20th century as it
[1:18:11] was to be the age in which the true
[1:18:12] church would return to being the bride
[1:18:14] she was at Pentecost we know there must
[1:18:17] have necessity of necessity the return
[1:18:19] of dynamic power yeah right see demons
[1:18:22] have power and people acknowledge it
[1:18:24] right right the devil's got power and
[1:18:26] people acknowledge it well the bride
[1:18:28] also has
[1:18:30] power right to overcome the power of the
[1:18:32] enemy it's got to it must of necessity
[1:18:35] be a returned because there's never been
[1:18:37] more power of the devil and God did not
[1:18:39] leave you
[1:18:40] powerless yes sir right without a word
[1:18:43] to to produce power in your life so the
[1:18:46] Believers sense this in their spirits
[1:18:48] and begin crying to God because they
[1:18:49] recognize the age they were living in
[1:18:51] they were begin crying to God for a new
[1:18:53] outpouring such as was in the first Cent
[1:18:55] what seemed to be the answer came as
[1:18:57] many begin to speak in tongues manifest
[1:18:58] gifts of the Spirit it was then believed
[1:19:00] this was indeed the long awaited
[1:19:01] restoration it was not the latter rain
[1:19:04] can come only after the former rain
[1:19:06] which is the spring or teaching rain and
[1:19:08] again this is true also in your life
[1:19:11] what we do for the children when we
[1:19:13] teach them the word of God is Not
[1:19:16] unimportant right there's got to be a
[1:19:18] teaching a sewing you Sunday school
[1:19:20] teachers you're sewing yeah right as a
[1:19:23] pastor I'm sewing in the hearts of young
[1:19:24] young people what are we doing we're
[1:19:26] sewing because there's going to be a
[1:19:27] harvest in that life and there's got to
[1:19:29] be because of the age we live in there's
[1:19:31] got to be I believe there could be a
[1:19:32] sewing rain and immediately a lad rain
[1:19:35] quickening to the Holy Ghost but there's
[1:19:37] got to be a sewing a teaching or growing
[1:19:40] up but they had not received the
[1:19:42] teaching Reign now uh and he said how
[1:19:44] could this be the real thing when the
[1:19:45] teaching Reign did not
[1:19:47] come so now again brother bam taught us
[1:19:51] he remember he said that was a teaching
[1:19:53] Reign for the denomination Billy Graham
[1:19:55] or Roberts but not for
[1:19:58] us right we were taught by the message
[1:20:00] of the
[1:20:01] hour so he talked about the Judas and
[1:20:04] Jesus and the mixture that was there he
[1:20:05] said but what about the true seed it
[1:20:07] will happen just as we've said the
[1:20:09] people of God are being made ready by
[1:20:11] the word of truth from the messenger of
[1:20:12] this age in
[1:20:15] her now do we really believe we're
[1:20:17] her we say that that way in this age I
[1:20:20] know that sounds strange but we are her
[1:20:22] yeah right we are the bride yeah we are
[1:20:25] either are or we aren't right can you
[1:20:27] believe that you are I believe the bride
[1:20:30] has the capacity to know who she is can
[1:20:33] you believe that you are in her will be
[1:20:36] the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[1:20:39] will bring the people right back to
[1:20:41] where they were at the beginning he said
[1:20:42] that is thus sayeth the
[1:20:45] Lord hallelujah he quotes the
[1:20:48] scripture that we read about the former
[1:20:50] latter Reign now he said it says God is
[1:20:52] going to restore the Lutheran age did
[1:20:54] not restore rest the church it started a
[1:20:56] Reformation the Western age did not
[1:20:57] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[1:20:59] restore but God has to restore for he
[1:21:02] cannot deny his word he said this is not
[1:21:04] the resurrection of the church it's the
[1:21:06] restoration God will take the church
[1:21:09] right back to Pentecost to the beginning
[1:21:11] he talked about why it needed to be
[1:21:13] restored because of the caterpillar and
[1:21:15] because of the the worms that that come
[1:21:17] up and eaten away at its joy and eating
[1:21:19] away at all these things that he talked
[1:21:20] about he said that poor little root and
[1:21:22] stalk is going to be restored God isn't
[1:21:24] plant a new church but he's going to
[1:21:26] bring his original planting back to
[1:21:28] Original
[1:21:29] Seed he said he is doing it as stated in
[1:21:32] verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign
[1:21:35] next will come the Harvest rain or
[1:21:37] rapturing
[1:21:39] faith oh my church do you realize where
[1:21:41] we're
[1:21:42] at we've had a teaching
[1:21:45] rain we've also had a harvest rain we're
[1:21:48] living in it what is it you see what can
[1:21:51] it be what's rapturing Faith the B will
[1:21:54] take the seven Thunders to wake her up
[1:21:56] and see people try to separate the word
[1:21:58] from the spirit you can't do it right
[1:22:00] it's the same thing the spirit lives in
[1:22:04] the
[1:22:05] word hallelujah when Jesus come on the
[1:22:07] earth the spirit indwelt him the spirit
[1:22:10] is living in the word today come on and

[1:24:47] that
[1:24:49] Hallelujah this is the hour for
[1:24:52] that Hallelujah this is rapturing Faith
[1:24:55] remember they fall in the same season
[1:24:57] yes what is the latter rain well brother
[1:24:59] BR explains this someone asked him the
[1:25:02] question because we were all mixed up on
[1:25:04] it do you know how many questions in
[1:25:08] questions and answers if you go listen
[1:25:10] to those tapes 1 2 3 and four 1964 if
[1:25:13] you go listen to questions and answers
[1:25:14] how many of those questions could be
[1:25:15] solved would have been if they had
[1:25:17] understood the opening of the word
[1:25:20] right right they just didn't understand
[1:25:23] right and I'll be honest with you some
[1:25:24] of the questions that got asked they
[1:25:25] like boy I'd like to ask a
[1:25:28] question can we just take but he you
[1:25:30] know little things do matter to people
[1:25:33] it does matter in our lives it's all the
[1:25:35] opening of the
[1:25:36] word but but yet you know there were
[1:25:39] some questions there that that that they
[1:25:41] just didn't understand and this is one
[1:25:42] of them you said will the bride before
[1:25:44] Jesus comes will she have all the power
[1:25:46] of the Holy Ghost to perform Miracles
[1:25:47] rais dead and so on is in the latter
[1:25:48] rain or is this latter rain for the
[1:25:51] 144,000 Jews he said they said well
[1:25:54] ministers have this or are we just
[1:25:55] waiting for the coming brother brand
[1:25:57] explains he's a
[1:25:59] typologist he says this he said and this
[1:26:01] is a long answer so you'll have to go
[1:26:03] read it for yourself he said I believe
[1:26:04] you're seeing the last thing that will
[1:26:06] happen to the church before the Rapture
[1:26:08] he said that's exactly I believe it the
[1:26:09] Reign is
[1:26:11] over where are we at
[1:26:14] church think about it I don't want you
[1:26:17] to take that wrong you say well no more
[1:26:18] Holy Ghost okay I can just go out and do
[1:26:20] what I want to do that's that's not what
[1:26:21] he's
[1:26:22] saying but the rain's coming
[1:26:26] the reain is over and so where are we at
[1:26:29] and so brother BR talked about how the
[1:26:31] last sign was Luke
[1:26:33] 17:30 right he talked about how he was
[1:26:35] not allowed to preach the trumpets
[1:26:36] because that was to the Jews he said the
[1:26:38] things that the people's been looking
[1:26:40] for the Pentecost was for miracles he
[1:26:41] said that's where that'll take place
[1:26:43] under them he said that's Elijah and
[1:26:44] Moses now I believe in miracles but what
[1:26:47] they were doing is they were following
[1:26:49] Miracles following signs we don't follow
[1:26:51] signs signs follow us We Don't Preach
[1:26:54] signs signs happen when we preach the
[1:26:57] word right and that's part of the word
[1:26:59] but it's not all the word right right so
[1:27:02] the we just preach the word whatever we
[1:27:03] have in our heart and God brings it to
[1:27:06] pass so now watch what's happening he
[1:27:09] said the things that the people's been
[1:27:10] looking for the Pentecost is for
[1:27:11] miracles that'll take place under them
[1:27:13] as Elijah and Moses he explains what the
[1:27:15] two prophets do he said we're just to
[1:27:17] wait on the coming of the Lord just wait
[1:27:19] keep your Lambs trimmed all filled full
[1:27:21] of oil pray up every every hour all
[1:27:25] right he said not every day every hour
[1:27:29] just keep ready be ready now watch what
[1:27:32] he says you want to sign you want you
[1:27:35] want to know what you're supposed to be
[1:27:36] doing brother man am I supposed to be
[1:27:37] speaking in tongues am I you may am I
[1:27:39] supposed to be running the aisles I hope
[1:27:41] you do
[1:27:42] yeah we can use a little more aisle
[1:27:44] running around here all
[1:27:47] right brother Ben you're crazy I'd like
[1:27:49] to see people happy in the Lord I'd be
[1:27:51] honest with you but that's not what
[1:27:52] we're seeking right what's not we pre we
[1:27:55] preach the word then if people get happy
[1:27:58] enough to run the hours God bless them
[1:27:59] as long as they're happy about the word
[1:28:01] and the promise of the word being
[1:28:03] fulfilled in their life praise God for
[1:28:04] it yeah right but brother bam explains
[1:28:08] all of this and and he said pray up
[1:28:10] every hour not every day every hour just
[1:28:13] keep ready be ready be
[1:28:16] sweet well we miss that didn't
[1:28:19] we in all our Readiness we just kind of
[1:28:22] cut that out all right
[1:28:25] come on Church be
[1:28:28] sweet what's the prophet trying to tell
[1:28:30] us there's something coming the Danny I
[1:28:32] think some people caught this part of
[1:28:33] the message and and some people just
[1:28:35] never caught it because they forgot to
[1:28:37] be sweet they forgot to treat their
[1:28:39] neighbor right and that was part of what
[1:28:41] would take place brother Brandon said
[1:28:43] you don't he said you don't because if
[1:28:44] you he said if you if you begin to
[1:28:46] promote gifts and push people to have
[1:28:47] gifts he said you'll have you'll have
[1:28:49] false gifts show up he said but what you
[1:28:51] do is get a church so in unity and so in
[1:28:53] love with another and so much in the
[1:28:55] power of the spirit he said gifts can't
[1:28:57] help but flow in a church like that
[1:29:00] that's
[1:29:01] true be sweet and watching and he quotes
[1:29:06] our Lord is coming back to Earth again I
[1:29:07] love that old song he said that's it
[1:29:10] that's the hope of the church yes sir
[1:29:12] this
[1:29:13] hour brother Ben that doesn't fit with
[1:29:15] my theology well you know if the message
[1:29:18] doesn't fit with our theology we need to
[1:29:19] change our
[1:29:22] theology brother brandom almost always
[1:29:24] prefaces his teaching on the wheat with
[1:29:26] the fact that this revival that had been
[1:29:29] going on in his ministry had lasted a
[1:29:30] number of years without forming an
[1:29:32] organization and he contrast it with the
[1:29:35] latter rign organization we talked about
[1:29:36] a minute ago and so the things I'm going
[1:29:38] to read to you are on that as we
[1:29:41] continue to talk about this rain then
[1:29:42] we'll get to the sun now he said why he
[1:29:44] said it's the weed age friends so he's
[1:29:47] explaining why did the shck have to pull
[1:29:49] away some of you wonder why did your
[1:29:51] friends have to disbelieve the message
[1:29:53] and for for some of you that woke you
[1:29:58] up why did they why did why did they
[1:30:00] fall to a website why did they go I
[1:30:03] thought they were a good Christian I
[1:30:05] thought they believed in a prophet and
[1:30:07] one day you wake up and they're living
[1:30:08] like the world again and they're out
[1:30:11] there in the world you think what
[1:30:12] happened to them well what happened to
[1:30:14] them it's the time that we're living in
[1:30:16] yeah and I will say this some of those
[1:30:19] people may come back but it just proved
[1:30:21] it wasn't in them yet yet is a good word
[1:30:25] it hasn't happened yet Paul said I did
[1:30:28] it in ignorance he knew who Jesus was
[1:30:31] but he said I did it in ignorance why he
[1:30:32] never been born again yet so it just
[1:30:35] hadn't come yet not saying it couldn't
[1:30:37] come not saying you couldn't be be born
[1:30:39] again it just hadn't happened yet if you
[1:30:41] denied the message of the hour right
[1:30:43] right it hasn't happened yet but now he
[1:30:46] he said it lasted a number of years he
[1:30:48] said why do they have to pull away why
[1:30:50] it's the weat age friends it's the weat
[1:30:53] there's a Ministry on the earth it's
[1:30:54] just like the one that went to the
[1:30:55] ground back Y at the beginning a real
[1:30:58] Pentecostal
[1:30:59] experience Hallelujah the next week
[1:31:02] brother Brandon preaches Harvest time
[1:31:04] later on he preaches the seed is not air
[1:31:06] with the shut anointed ones at the end
[1:31:08] time and you go and listen to those
[1:31:10] sermons he's explaining how the rain
[1:31:11] falls on everybody it's not a different
[1:31:14] rain but it only brings out what it is
[1:31:18] so he's explaining the rains for
[1:31:19] everyone only the wheat respond as wheat
[1:31:22] and he talks about how the he was
[1:31:24] standing there at the national park and
[1:31:26] he was talking about how they were about
[1:31:27] to pour down the the fire out of over
[1:31:29] the waterfall I believe they still do it
[1:31:31] today they did it for years but they
[1:31:33] would pour it down you could see it and
[1:31:35] he talked about that and he said that
[1:31:37] his family was standing there looking up
[1:31:39] he said all of a sudden a man cried out
[1:31:42] and said and said all things are ready
[1:31:44] yeah he said and a man standing beside
[1:31:46] him said Let the Fire
[1:31:48] Fall and brother random took something
[1:31:50] from that and he tells that story he
[1:31:52] said all these promises he talked about
[1:31:54] the promise of Malachi 4 the former
[1:31:56] latter reign in the same season all
[1:31:58] these promises through the scriptures
[1:32:00] been given we're looking upward right
[1:32:03] watch he said at the true bride Across
[1:32:04] the Nation this hour looking up Church
[1:32:07] he's coming one of these days just to
[1:32:09] sure as he come the first time he's
[1:32:11] coming again get everything ready
[1:32:13] separate yourself from Shu lay before
[1:32:16] the sun keep looking up be under
[1:32:21] expectation what do you expect God to do
[1:32:24] oh my come on Church you're expecting
[1:32:27] something now or nothing if you come
[1:32:30] expecting nothing that's
[1:32:32] expecting right if you come expecting a
[1:32:35] bad day you come expecting ill from your
[1:32:38] neighbor you come expecting well that
[1:32:40] preacher is going to preach at me again
[1:32:41] it probably
[1:32:43] happen that's just the truth but if you
[1:32:46] expect to say Lord I'm expecting the
[1:32:48] fire to fall all right I'm expecting to
[1:32:51] become more like Jesus Christ that's
[1:32:53] exactly what you'll
[1:32:55] get brother Bron in the day he said that
[1:32:58] God has poured out his Spirit from on
[1:32:59] high great signs and wonders are to
[1:33:01] accompany the ministry of this day right
[1:33:04] he said
[1:33:06] this is the he said when the former and
[1:33:09] latter Reign are falling together right
[1:33:12] yeah and we know that there's supposed
[1:33:14] to be great signs and wonders he said
[1:33:17] which in many great denominations this
[1:33:19] is turned down right but I'm very
[1:33:22] thankful he said for these open doors oh
[1:33:25] God let me keep my doors open to the to
[1:33:28] the power of this
[1:33:29] message this I want I'm very thankful
[1:33:32] for open doors that I've had to go into
[1:33:34] and the inspiration is given to young
[1:33:36] men like your pastor has caus him he
[1:33:38] said as I'm beginning to get old and
[1:33:40] know that my days are numbered and know
[1:33:42] now that these young men can take this
[1:33:43] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:46] Lord oh church I believe there's a
[1:33:49] generation now those young men become
[1:33:51] old men but there's still young men that
[1:33:53] are sweeping on the message yes sir
[1:33:57] hallelujah hallelujah he said he said to
[1:34:00] sweep it to the coming Lord that's he
[1:34:03] said that's the former the lad rain fell
[1:34:04] in the same
[1:34:05] season and these young men are to take
[1:34:08] that message and sweep it to the coming
[1:34:10] of the Lord now again without the latter
[1:34:14] rain you can't be ready for a
[1:34:16] Rapture so we know that the latter Reign
[1:34:18] has
[1:34:19] come now brother Rand says it's such a
[1:34:23] time as this that the messenger of
[1:34:24] Malachi must come then the latter rain
[1:34:26] will come a mount carel Showdown so po
[1:34:28] part of this latter
[1:34:29] rain is the Harvest right it's just
[1:34:32] right there it's the Harvest it produces
[1:34:35] the
[1:34:36] Harvest it will come a Mount Carmel
[1:34:38] Showdown he said watch John was the
[1:34:41] Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the
[1:34:42] former rign was rejected by the
[1:34:44] organization of his day Jesus came and
[1:34:46] had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the
[1:34:48] second Forerunner of Christ will SE for
[1:34:50] the latter rain so John in his Showdown
[1:34:53] he he was rejected by the organizations
[1:34:55] of his day and what did he do he sowed a
[1:34:59] teaching Reign for the ministry of
[1:35:02] Christ right and brother Brandon typ
[1:35:04] said he to the Divine Healing was a
[1:35:06] teaching Reign for the coming of the son
[1:35:08] of man
[1:35:09] ministry right so there's a teaching
[1:35:11] Reign and a harvest rain so Jesus had a
[1:35:14] mount Transfiguration Showdown so there
[1:35:16] had this message didn't just bring to us
[1:35:18] John the Baptist all right the
[1:35:19] Forerunner but also brought
[1:35:22] Christ oh Church if you just we just
[1:35:24] receive it today it also brought Christ
[1:35:27] and we know Christ will come in a
[1:35:28] Corporal body how many believ that today
[1:35:30] well that's how many Believers we have
[1:35:31] right he said Believers believe that
[1:35:34] you'll come in a Corporal body but we've
[1:35:35] had a word coming of Christ an appearing
[1:35:38] of Christ where he's come and he showed
[1:35:40] us who he is and he's come in his power
[1:35:42] in the word to produce a word bride at
[1:35:45] the end time yes sir we've been married
[1:35:47] to him now look we all know these things
[1:35:49] now he said Jesus will be the showdown
[1:35:51] between the denominations and creeds he
[1:35:53] said for you will come to back up his
[1:35:55] word take his bride in the Rapture the
[1:35:57] first Showdown was Mount Carmel the
[1:35:58] second was Mount Transfiguration the
[1:36:00] third will be Mount Zion amen aren't you
[1:36:02] glad we're at that Showdown today that's
[1:36:05] where we are right there the shouts
[1:36:08] already come we're living in the time of
[1:36:12] the Rapture now look the former and
[1:36:14] latter rain fell together produced
[1:36:15] rapturing Faith what does this mean
[1:36:18] we're living in the final
[1:36:20] stage after the last sign and the latter
[1:36:23] rain now here's my message this
[1:36:25] morning boy you got quiet I didn't say
[1:36:29] my message would be
[1:36:31] long no more rain doesn't mean no more
[1:36:35] Revival all
[1:36:39] right because when the latter rain
[1:36:42] fell it was so much rain falling
[1:36:46] together oh sister Fritz gets it she
[1:36:49] it's so much rain falling together that
[1:36:52] it just Stills up the seed with
[1:36:56] moisture so the the shut gets dry it's
[1:36:58] got to so the rain from Heaven has to
[1:37:01] quit falling on the general population
[1:37:04] and so the shut dries up the stalk dries
[1:37:07] up oh my the husk dries up but the wheat
[1:37:10] seed is
[1:37:12] maturing it's maturing the sun does not
[1:37:15] burn it up because the moisture of the
[1:37:17] lter rain is inside the
[1:37:19] sea oh Church listen it don't matter how
[1:37:22] dead they get it don't matter you say
[1:37:24] well we got to go the world's dead we
[1:37:25] might as well be dead too no this bride
[1:37:27] will'll be in Revival we've been in
[1:37:29] Revival why the former and the latter
[1:37:31] rain fell
[1:37:34] together church so much rain in this
[1:37:39] message so much power in this me so much
[1:37:42] spirit in this
[1:37:43] messag glory to
[1:37:46] God it just filled us
[1:37:50] up come on all the life went out of the
[1:37:52] stock
[1:37:54] went out of the husk went out of the
[1:37:55] tossel goes right down that little bitty
[1:37:58] grain it's forming into what he wanted
[1:38:00] it to be right oh my now see the sun has
[1:38:05] to come out all right we've had the
[1:38:07] former rain the latter rain the former
[1:38:09] and the latter ran together now the sun
[1:38:12] is the word and it's got to come in its
[1:38:16] strength at this time of year if we can
[1:38:18] say it that way it had to come in its
[1:38:20] strength cu the harvest season if you
[1:38:22] look outside be just about this time of
[1:38:24] year what happens it may storm today we
[1:38:27] might have a rain tomorrow it's going to
[1:38:29] be
[1:38:31] hot it's just that time of
[1:38:34] year you the Heat and the humidity are
[1:38:37] going to come why because it's that time
[1:38:39] of year and it was this time of
[1:38:43] year when the seed would be harvested
[1:38:47] because it received this final spring
[1:38:49] rain and then in June if you look at a
[1:38:52] precipitation map now brother Joel was
[1:38:55] in Egypt and Joel being Joel he just
[1:38:57] assumed things work over there like they
[1:38:59] do
[1:39:00] here and remember the something was
[1:39:03] outside or I think they well they had
[1:39:05] bread out on tables and brother Joel
[1:39:08] said well what if it rains and our
[1:39:10] interpreter told us it don't
[1:39:12] rain you're in
[1:39:14] Egypt you're in the Sahara Desert he
[1:39:17] said oh it rains once a year and you can
[1:39:20] predict it once a year it rains and then
[1:39:22] when it rains that's all the rain you
[1:39:23] get and the rest of the rain every day
[1:39:25] the sun comes up every day it goes down
[1:39:29] here comes the sun again well that's way
[1:39:31] it feel sometimes isn't it it's every
[1:39:33] day you're baking you're baking but if
[1:39:34] you're the
[1:39:35] bride the the the oh my the wheat has
[1:39:38] the ability to retain so much
[1:39:41] moisture that it's still growing during
[1:39:43] the Harvest time it's still growing In
[1:39:45] the Heat of that sun yes
[1:39:48] sir oh
[1:39:50] church now look everything else has to
[1:39:54] die but the wheat just becomes more what
[1:39:57] it
[1:39:58] is and when the when the word comes in
[1:40:00] its strength the the shut can't take it
[1:40:03] it pulls back the the stalk begins to
[1:40:05] begins to crumble and begins to fall
[1:40:07] apart there's no rain in Bethlehem go
[1:40:09] look it up no rain in Bethlehem in June
[1:40:11] bethlehem's the wheat basket but the
[1:40:13] crops are maturing under the direct
[1:40:16] heat brother B so we know that this weed
[1:40:18] has come to the same process every
[1:40:19] nature works the same he said now Lord
[1:40:21] when we see the Shu now pulling away
[1:40:23] from the grain going worldly oh God he
[1:40:26] said grant that those grains he said the
[1:40:29] Shu has to pull away so the grain can
[1:40:31] get in the presence of the Sun the
[1:40:34] presence the son has a presence the word
[1:40:37] has a presence the word has a has a has
[1:40:39] an atmosphere the word has does
[1:40:42] something in your life it's not just a
[1:40:43] word letter but it's a reality of God
[1:40:47] the word the sun has to has to begin to
[1:40:50] bake you has to begin to make you to
[1:40:51] what you want to be what he wants you to
[1:40:53] be so the Shu has to pull away he said

[1:43:41] Grain in the presence of the sun to
[1:43:43] ripen the grain to a golden ripen for
[1:43:46] the master all right he said why is it
[1:43:49] pulled away it caused
[1:43:52] heartaches
[1:43:54] tears sure it does you don't want to see
[1:43:57] the shuck pull away it was comforting
[1:43:59] right to have the
[1:44:01] numbers it was comforting when they all
[1:44:03] went to church with you and everything
[1:44:04] was good but the Shu began to pull
[1:44:08] away what did it pull away for oh my it
[1:44:13] causes heartaches and tears they don't
[1:44:14] they don't lay that they don't lay
[1:44:16] before the Su in but the S so n to be
[1:44:19] rip into the true Full Gospel to
[1:44:21] manifest everything say everything that
[1:44:24] Jesus Christ promised in the Bible
[1:44:27] that's all of it he said there is
[1:44:28] raising up a body today among the
[1:44:32] people GL to God again he said what is
[1:44:35] it the husk for away from the wheat now
[1:44:38] the wheat must be that way again to lay
[1:44:42] in the presence of the sun to turn to a
[1:44:44] Full Gospel golden grain for the
[1:44:48] master won't you believe it again he
[1:44:51] said who is this anyhow
[1:44:53] who is it could it be a man could it be
[1:44:56] a church could it be a denomination it's
[1:44:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:45:01] and forever he said Do you believe him
[1:45:03] what is it it's the grain becoming grain
[1:45:06] in the presence of the
[1:45:08] sun again he said but the wheat has to
[1:45:11] lay in the presence of the sun to ripen
[1:45:13] and that's what we're here for friend
[1:45:15] stay in the presence of the sun till our
[1:45:18] little group of people here till it
[1:45:21] becomes so ripe to Christ it becomes
[1:45:24] Bread on his
[1:45:26] table oh church I want to be in your
[1:45:28] house I don't want to be Bread on your
[1:45:30] table Lord ought to be our
[1:45:34] desire we he when he sits down to eat he
[1:45:37] don't want a table full of full of bugs
[1:45:40] and worms and and and and if you sit
[1:45:44] down the and the bread's full of mold he
[1:45:47] wants fresh
[1:45:49] bread he wants bread from wheat that was
[1:45:52] ripe
[1:45:53] yeah oh Church stay in the presence of
[1:45:57] the son do you become Bread on his
[1:46:00] table said Satan will do anything he can
[1:46:02] to get you out of
[1:46:04] that look he said we're living when
[1:46:06] there has been stalk tossle shuck almost
[1:46:08] like the wheat but the wheat is inside
[1:46:11] the shook the Shu has just supported the
[1:46:13] wheat kept the hot sun from burning it
[1:46:17] all right and now the denomination is
[1:46:19] pulling away from it so it can lay in
[1:46:21] the presence of the Sun to get right he
[1:46:25] said so we're in there won't be no more
[1:46:26] organizations rise up this is the end of
[1:46:31] it I know you've thought about this you
[1:46:35] know in your mind you know you maybe not
[1:46:36] but you think like this the thing what's
[1:46:39] what's the thing that's the matter with
[1:46:40] the message
[1:46:42] today and I
[1:46:45] know when I lean over the pulpit that's
[1:46:47] when I really begin to preach come on
[1:46:50] but we know actually it's because
[1:46:53] because I'm fat and I need a place to
[1:46:54] lean
[1:46:57] on but we know I don't even know what we
[1:47:00] know
[1:47:03] now you know I know there's people that
[1:47:05] say what's the matter with the message
[1:47:07] today brother Brandon says it you
[1:47:08] probably read ahead of me anyway he said
[1:47:10] the thing that's the matter with the
[1:47:13] message today and I know people say well
[1:47:15] I know what it is they got drums in the
[1:47:17] church and that's what's the matter with
[1:47:18] the message all right come on now thing
[1:47:22] that's the matter with the message today
[1:47:23] is there just too many people having too
[1:47:25] many kids you know it's
[1:47:28] just I'm just trying to make you
[1:47:30] laugh the things matter with the message
[1:47:32] today is them men wearing beards I mean
[1:47:34] that's just they'd be clean shaving like
[1:47:37] a prophet said you know all right not
[1:47:40] preaching that but I've heard it
[1:47:42] preached the thing that's the matter
[1:47:44] with the message today is we don't
[1:47:46] measure the skirts to the girls when
[1:47:47] they come in no that's not what the
[1:47:48] prophet
[1:47:51] said what did he say he said the thing
[1:47:55] that's the matter with the message today
[1:47:57] is those who obtain it in their hearts
[1:48:00] must lay in the presence of the son to
[1:48:03] get ripened right Hallelujah you can
[1:48:07] pick up the message and then let the sun
[1:48:09] bake all the greenness out of you making
[1:48:12] matured Christians see what I mean he
[1:48:14] said God is coming soon to receive his
[1:48:16] church and we must have that type of
[1:48:18] Christians for him to receive the wheat
[1:48:21] has got to get
[1:48:24] right he said so what does it have to do
[1:48:26] now what does the wheat have to do after
[1:48:29] the shuck is pulled away what does the
[1:48:31] wheat have to do lay in the presence of
[1:48:34] the sun to be ripened that's exact the
[1:48:37] word to be ripened into your heart to
[1:48:40] bring forth and live what we're talking
[1:48:43] about we've talked about it for years
[1:48:45] it's time to live
[1:48:49] it we talk about Fellowship for years
[1:48:52] let's do it yeah all right we've talked
[1:48:54] about loving one another for years let's
[1:48:55] do it all right we talked about stopping
[1:48:57] our gossip for years let's do it are you
[1:49:00] with me now let's let the greenness get
[1:49:02] out of
[1:49:04] us don't try to hammer what some
[1:49:06] Churches doing down the road let's let's
[1:49:08] let's get the greenness baked out of
[1:49:14] us live what we're talking about
[1:49:16] Pentecost for the BRS that only
[1:49:17] sheltered the message give it an open
[1:49:19] door until it gets scattered then the
[1:49:21] shuck will pull away
[1:49:23] and the wheat will lay in the presence
[1:49:24] of the sun to ripen he said there won't
[1:49:26] be another denomination he said always
[1:49:29] it pulls away from it it can't be no
[1:49:31] more it's a wheat now but we're plenty
[1:49:36] green some of you live through that time
[1:49:39] and you
[1:49:40] know I see our elders saying amen
[1:49:42] because they knew we were they were
[1:49:44] plenty green could I go out here and say
[1:49:47] today some of us because we're younger
[1:49:48] maybe we haven't had the time and
[1:49:49] seasoning we're plenty green right
[1:49:54] maybe there's an elder here with just a
[1:49:55] little bit of greenness left in
[1:49:57] them plenty
[1:50:01] green we're still here aren't we then we
[1:50:04] must be a little bit
[1:50:06] green plenty green he said we haven't
[1:50:09] got Oh my he said that's right I have to
[1:50:12] lay in the presence of the sun now watch
[1:50:14] what for so we can become word
[1:50:20] Fighters look at your enemy tell them I
[1:50:23] love you you
[1:50:25] know heard that the other night look so
[1:50:28] we could oh so we could so we' really
[1:50:30] arm ourself with the word that's not
[1:50:31] what he said to be mellowed up all right
[1:50:35] you know you're always looking at that
[1:50:36] person say one day they'll mellow out
[1:50:37] and then they never do you
[1:50:39] know he's 80 years old he still hasn't
[1:50:43] mellowed well we all do that don't we
[1:50:45] say well he'll mellow out
[1:50:47] someday but look we're plenty green but
[1:50:50] it takes the presence of the sun to
[1:50:52] Mellow us up
[1:50:53] to be mellowed up what does that mean it
[1:50:55] means to fight less not more fight the
[1:50:57] devil but not fight each
[1:51:01] other you said brother Ben why you
[1:51:03] preach on that so much because brother
[1:51:04] brandom did and I read a lot of
[1:51:10] quotes all right all right how do we
[1:51:12] know it's plenty green brother brandom
[1:51:14] how will we know if we're green is it is
[1:51:17] a lack of signs in the church lack of
[1:51:19] gifts left of Miracles I might be part
[1:51:21] of it but look he we're plenty green we
[1:51:24] haven't got the
[1:51:27] sincerity oh I think every one of us had
[1:51:30] to repent right now from the pulpit to
[1:51:33] the PE we haven't got the sincerity the
[1:51:37] sacredness the thing we ought to have in
[1:51:38] our midst to know that the spirit of the
[1:51:40] Living God moving in his word and
[1:51:42] showing us the things yes
[1:51:46] yet he said but brother
[1:51:48] Ben I wasn't there during the former
[1:51:51] noat rain I missed the rain how can I be
[1:51:54] but you didn't miss the
[1:51:56] rain the Revival's still ongoing there's
[1:51:59] still a Revival for you you didn't miss
[1:52:02] the rain there's still water for you
[1:52:04] during this time the message is still
[1:52:06] the latter rain it'll still produce the
[1:52:08] rain come
[1:52:10] on every other part dried up and dead
[1:52:13] but not you I preached it to you many
[1:52:15] times but I think of the time when
[1:52:16] Caleb's daughter he gave her a Southland
[1:52:19] he gave her a part of the ne desert
[1:52:20] she's part of that desert where there's
[1:52:22] nothing can grow and she's like she
[1:52:24] didn't sit there and complain and say
[1:52:25] well my father gave me land I can't even
[1:52:27] produce a crop on but she went to her
[1:52:29] father and she said you've given me a
[1:52:31] desert land she said give me also
[1:52:33] Springs of water give me water and I'll
[1:52:36] make crops grow give me water and I'll
[1:52:38] produce oh that we could be like that we
[1:52:40] live in a harvest time we live in a dry
[1:52:42] time but give me water and I'll produce
[1:52:44] a crop for you
[1:52:47] Lord give me also Springs of
[1:52:50] water good
[1:52:53] brother brandom says this he said God at
[1:52:55] this little altar of every heart present
[1:52:58] here and around the nation May the
[1:53:02] waters May the waters from under the
[1:53:05] altar of God now look this isn't rain
[1:53:08] falling on the general population but
[1:53:11] Waters from the altar of God he still
[1:53:13] has water for you gush out this morning
[1:53:16] upon your church water it Lord For The
[1:53:19] Season's just about to be finished
[1:53:22] give it life the Waters of life that it
[1:53:24] might be able to lay in the presence of
[1:53:26] the sun to be ripened for your great
[1:53:28] Garner you say well that's all past the
[1:53:30] rain is coming gone but don't you
[1:53:31] realize that does not give you an excuse
[1:53:34] there is no excuse for a dead Church
[1:53:37] there's no excuse for people that don't
[1:53:39] amen God's word no excuse for people
[1:53:42] that don't believe in the signs and
[1:53:43] wonders of God there's no excuse for
[1:53:45] people that don't preach no more come on
[1:53:47] I'm tired of the excuses let's live the
[1:53:49] word let the waters come under the altar
[1:53:52] of life flow out into the presence of
[1:53:55] the
[1:53:55] sun Hallelujah let the water from the
[1:53:59] altar of God gush out this morning upon
[1:54:01] your church water it Lord The Season's
[1:54:03] about to be finished give it life the
[1:54:05] Waters of life that it might be able to
[1:54:07] lay in the presence of the sun to be
[1:54:09] ripened for your great Garner he said
[1:54:11] father I pray for them but the stalk
[1:54:14] must dry so I cannot pray for it it must
[1:54:17] die so it is dead but I oh God what part
[1:54:20] are you today you say well we're dead
[1:54:22] were're supposed to be dead he said the
[1:54:23] stalk is dead I can't pray for it it
[1:54:27] must die but I pray for the wheat Lord
[1:54:29] that's forming into the body of Christ
[1:54:32] Grant Lord that the fresh waters of God
[1:54:35] will keep its cheeks bathed with tears
[1:54:37] of joy and understanding until the
[1:54:40] combine comes to take it home oh grant
[1:54:42] that in our church Lord grant that in
[1:54:44] every Church of the message at the tears
[1:54:46] of understanding and Joy would keep our
[1:54:49] keep our cheeks bathed watered
[1:54:52] Hallelujah until the combine
[1:54:54] comes to take it
[1:54:57] home he said I believe the church is
[1:54:59] beginning to hear the message I just got
[1:55:01] a few more minutes and we'll
[1:55:03] close and begin to understand but
[1:55:05] friends listen we've got to lay in the
[1:55:08] presence of the sun we got to be ripened
[1:55:10] our faith isn't ripe intellectually
[1:55:13] we're hearing the message that God has
[1:55:14] given us and seeing the signs that he
[1:55:16] showed us and proving it by the Bible
[1:55:18] it's there oh how the church needs to
[1:55:22] lay in his
[1:55:23] presence till what till it gets so hard
[1:55:26] everything just bounces off of
[1:55:29] it till it becomes like the stalk where
[1:55:33] it's dry and it falls
[1:55:35] apart till it tenders up what what a
[1:55:41] paradox sir that during the Harvest Time
[1:55:44] the driest time the lay of c and
[1:55:46] age the wheat becomes more
[1:55:50] tender Hallelujah
[1:55:52] tenderness is associated with rain and
[1:55:55] water not with sun but the heat of the
[1:55:58] Sun the open word actually produces a
[1:56:01] tenderness because the latter rain has
[1:56:04] come and lives in the
[1:56:06] bride he said his presence till it
[1:56:08] tenders up you know he said and get
[1:56:11] sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe
[1:56:16] down how many how long has it been see
[1:56:18] you just pray Lord make me sweet
[1:56:23] made me so sweet that my husband won't
[1:56:24] have to lie about
[1:56:27] it made me so sweet my wife won't have
[1:56:30] to lie about it may me so sweet that the
[1:56:32] church will know there's something
[1:56:34] inside of me yes I'll fight when the
[1:56:36] time comes to fight I'll fight the enemy
[1:56:38] but make me sweet
[1:56:41] Lord make it to where I'm so tender that
[1:56:44] people who say things about me and it'll
[1:56:45] just bounce off and I can still minister
[1:56:48] to those people
[1:56:52] yes God help me
[1:56:53] today that's a challenge
[1:56:56] church but every one of us know people
[1:56:58] you say but but you know what you do if
[1:56:59] you cut them off if you treat them badly
[1:57:01] you can't minister to them no more no
[1:57:04] matter who was right and who was wrong
[1:57:08] right that person's worth ministering
[1:57:11] to even if they don't like
[1:57:16] you sometimes in speaking the message
[1:57:18] brother the B said you get harsh have to
[1:57:20] break it in like that because you you
[1:57:22] got to clinch a nail to make it hold but
[1:57:24] when the church once gets it all right I
[1:57:27] recognize we haven't all got it yet
[1:57:29] sometimes we still have to clinch that
[1:57:30] nail but when the church once gets it
[1:57:33] the elected is called out and separated
[1:57:36] then in the presence of God brother R
[1:57:38] just told the story of going beyond the
[1:57:41] curtain of time he said nothing but
[1:57:43] perfect love will enter there how many
[1:57:45] remembers the story I'm closing you
[1:57:47] remember the story nothing but perfect
[1:57:48] love L her there and he saw them all
[1:57:50] with in perfect love and he touched said
[1:57:52] Lord he said whatever you do lay down
[1:57:54] everything and get perfect
[1:57:56] love and he's told that story again and
[1:58:00] he said I know it'll be something like
[1:58:02] the people was there when it takes its
[1:58:08] Rapture believe it's time for that
[1:58:10] perfect love to come in the church
[1:58:12] believe it's here we just need to Tender
[1:58:15] up it's
[1:58:18] sweet brother in now Church we're
[1:58:20] teaching now but remember when you leave
[1:58:21] here start moving out out of the Shu he
[1:58:23] said you're going to the grain but lay
[1:58:24] in the presence of the son don't add
[1:58:26] what I've said don't take away what I've
[1:58:28] said because I speak the truth as far as
[1:58:30] I know it as the father has given to me
[1:58:32] don't add to it just say what I said
[1:58:34] amen the thing of it is just tell the
[1:58:37] people to come seek the Lord Jesus and
[1:58:39] then you yourselves lay right in his
[1:58:42] presence just make love to him what are
[1:58:45] we supposed to be doing not dead and dry
[1:58:47] but in this harvest season make love to
[1:58:50] him that's worship oh Lord Jesus Son of
[1:58:55] God I love you tender My Heart Lord take
[1:58:59] away all the filth and the love of the
[1:59:01] world and let me live holy in this
[1:59:03] present world before you you see how he
[1:59:06] repeats it over and I'm doing this for
[1:59:08] reason he said tender me up sweeten me
[1:59:10] up he didn't say we need more knowledge
[1:59:12] more this more that tender me up let me
[1:59:14] lay in the presence of the message not
[1:59:17] in so much the word of it the letter of
[1:59:20] it but the presence of it
[1:59:23] amen so that word bakes out of me every
[1:59:26] bit of every bit of malice and
[1:59:28] bitterness
[1:59:32] Strife
[1:59:34] Hallelujah he said take away all the
[1:59:36] filth and the love of the world let me
[1:59:37] live holy in this present world before
[1:59:38] you tender My Heart Lord he said laying
[1:59:41] out now it's got to lay in the presence
[1:59:42] of the sun to ripen into the Glorious
[1:59:44] grain like the one that went in the
[1:59:45] first real Church went down he said that
[1:59:49] went down first to come right back
[1:59:50] musicians go ahead and come coming right
[1:59:52] back up to the stalk to come out another
[1:59:54] church when the combine comes to pick it
[1:59:55] up the life that went down in Luther the
[1:59:58] life that went down in Methodist the
[2:00:00] life that went down in the Pentecostal
[2:00:02] will come into the grain it'll all go
[2:00:05] right into the Grain and go out forming
[2:00:08] the perfect body of Jesus Christ but
[2:00:12] again he said in one of the last sermons
[2:00:13] he ever preached modern events are made
[2:00:15] clear by prophecy I've went through
[2:00:17] these in chronological order in the last
[2:00:19] two years of his life he said but what's
[2:00:21] the matter with the wheat now you can't
[2:00:24] it must lay in the presence of the sun
[2:00:28] to ripen before the
[2:00:31] combine picks it
[2:00:33] up I know sometimes we think well I'm
[2:00:36] laying in the presence of sun I listen
[2:00:37] to tapes that's part of it but that's
[2:00:39] not all of it got to lay in the presence
[2:00:42] of it you got to get in the spirit of it
[2:00:45] the atmosphere of it how do you know
[2:00:48] wheat is
[2:00:49] ripe you go out here on a wheat fi
[2:00:52] somewhere how do you
[2:00:54] know is it when it stands up straight
[2:00:57] and well I'm wheat now looks good don't
[2:01:01] it when it's up I cat you know look
[2:01:03] around I'm wheat now that's not when
[2:01:04] it's
[2:01:06] ripe that doesn't tell you it's ripe how
[2:01:09] you know wheat is
[2:01:10] ripe it gets so heavy because of the
[2:01:14] former rain that's com and the latter
[2:01:16] rain that's come and the sun that's on
[2:01:18] it the fullness of the word it becomes
[2:01:21] so so heavy and so
[2:01:24] humble that it actually bows itself to
[2:01:27] the
[2:01:28] Earth and when you see the wheat the
[2:01:31] head of that wheat bowing over humbling
[2:01:34] itself that's when you know there's no
[2:01:37] greenness left in it because it's gotten
[2:01:39] more and more like the the maturity of
[2:01:42] what went into the ground and as it
[2:01:44] becomes more like him it takes on his
[2:01:46] nature and it begins to Bow itself oh
[2:01:49] church he said he said know you what
[2:01:51] I've done to you he said do this to one
[2:01:53] another wash one another's feet that's
[2:01:55] more than just going back here in the
[2:01:56] room and washing our brother our
[2:01:57] sister's feet but it's actually treating
[2:02:00] one another like the body and the Bride
[2:02:02] of Jesus Christ like you actually were
[2:02:05] the bride of Christ because you are as
[2:02:08] we see the seed become so heavy let it
[2:02:11] bow itself what is it doing it's
[2:02:14] worshiping we preach on that last week
[2:02:16] it's worshiping it's prostrating itself
[2:02:18] before the father that's when you know
[2:02:21] it begins to Worship in spite of its
[2:02:23] difficulties in spite of its trouble in
[2:02:26] spite of what's went on through the week
[2:02:27] in spite of what somebody did to it it
[2:02:29] worships anyway oh church if we can ever
[2:02:32] get that heavy with the moisture of the
[2:02:34] latter rain the former rain and the sun
[2:02:37] that's come on we could get that heavy
[2:02:39] and that humble and we could begin to
[2:02:40] worship god with everything that we have
[2:02:43] you say well I didn't come to church
[2:02:44] today to worship I come to receive you
[2:02:46] have received he give you salvation he
[2:02:49] give you your health he give you
[2:02:51] everything you have have now worship him
[2:02:54] it's time for the seed to Bow itself
[2:02:57] this is King lamb worship time if there
[2:02:59] ever was a time to worship at the end of
[2:03:01] a service after the word has been
[2:03:02] preached today that
[2:03:04] day because now is the time when the
[2:03:08] wheed is ripe begins to worship could we
[2:03:10] stand together would you bow your heads
[2:03:13] with
[2:03:16] me Hallelujah
[2:03:26] this is when God deals with hearts I
[2:03:27] hate to see it Church where it's just a
[2:03:29] burden on my heart I know here and every

[2:03:32] something else but this is when God
