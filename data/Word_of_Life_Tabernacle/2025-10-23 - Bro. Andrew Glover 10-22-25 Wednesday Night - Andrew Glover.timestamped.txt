[39:04] I felt kind of bad about that, but the
[39:05] Lord I think just arranged it. He said
[39:07] he was coming tonight. So I said, "Well,
[39:09] why don't you preach then?"
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I knew a bunch of our folks
[39:13] would be gone hunting, but we've got
[39:14] several folks from Brother Mats. Thank
[39:16] you all for coming tonight. And uh, you
[39:19] know, on a Wednesday just makes you feel
[39:20] special when you see fellowship like
[39:22] that. I know you just got done with
[39:23] meetings and it's hard to go to five or
[39:26] six services in a row and then show up
[39:28] on Wednesday night. But thank you for
[39:30] coming. You're real troopers. And uh,
[39:32] it's good to have Sister Mariah and
[39:33] Malachi and
[39:35] is it Haven? I tried. Isn't it Haven? I
[39:38] have to. My wife's doing this. So good
[39:41] to have them. Haven hasn't been to
[39:42] church here yet. So glad to have that
[39:45] addition. And uh she's somebody's got
[39:47] her back there. It's good to have each
[39:49] one of you. Uh Malachi fell and hurt his
[39:52] leg, but the Lord's healing and helping
[39:54] him. And going to get that cast off
[39:56] soon. So we just love the uh brother
[40:00] Andrew and his family, the Glover
[40:02] family. And it just I remember a
[40:04] Wednesday night a few years ago when we
[40:06] were really needing a breakthrough and
[40:08] the Lord just come through. Maybe a
[40:10] crowd's probably much smaller than this
[40:11] one tonight and but the Lord just really
[40:14] moved in a mighty way and he can do
[40:16] that. He has a way of doing that.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; So, you just present your need before
[40:20] him. I know there's real needs
[40:22] healthwise and uh some folks that called
[40:24] me today and said they were unable to be
[40:26] here because of sickness and things and
[40:28] we just believe the Lord's going to heal
[40:30] them tonight. And those that had to stay
[40:32] in the stream and even those that are in
[40:34] the deer woods, God can go down where
[40:36] they're at, too. So, we sure appreciate
[40:39] all of you. As brother Andrew comes, uh
[40:42] remember our fall festival on Saturday.
[40:43] And y'all are welcome to come. Anybody
[40:46] that's able or wants to come and and
[40:48] fellowship with us. Won't be no church
[40:49] on Saturday. Just uh uh food and
[40:52] fellowship and games and things like
[40:54] that. And then on Sunday, Brother Shawn
[40:56] Martin will be with us. And we're
[40:58] looking forward to seeing him and his
[41:00] family uh this weekend. Amen. Let's sing
[41:03] that again. Pour your spirit out as
[41:04] brother Andrew comes. Pour your spirit
[41:08] out on me.
[41:11] Oh, make it your prayer tonight.
[41:15] Oh, saturate
[41:19] my thirsty soul.
[41:23] Come and fall aresh on me.
[41:28] Fill my cup again.
[41:33] Fill my heart and make me whole.
[41:40] Oh Lord, I need you now.
[41:47] [Applause]
[41:48] [Music]
[41:53] on me.
[41:56] Fall just like the rain.
[42:01] Saturate
[42:03] my thirsty soul.
[42:07] Come and fall aresh on me.
[42:12] Fill my heart again.
[42:17] Fill my heart
[42:20] &gt;&gt; and make me whole.
[42:25] I need
[42:27] you now.
[42:29] Pour your spirit out.
[42:35] Amen. How many believes this evening
[42:36] he's able to do that? Amen. There's one
[42:39] thing about our Lord. If you're if
[42:41] you're hungering and thirsting for more
[42:42] of him, prophet of God told us there's
[42:45] an evidence there's more of him for us
[42:46] to receive. And
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe here tonight there's
[42:49] a amen group of believers here tonight
[42:51] that has not come full of themselves,
[42:53] but they've come empty and amen with a
[42:56] lot of room to receive more of him. I
[42:58] tell you, I all I want is more of him.
[43:00] Amen. And I was listening the other day
[43:02] to an old sermon there of brother Biscll
[43:04] preaching years ago and he was talking
[43:06] about some visitors there in the
[43:08] service. I believe they were from Uganda
[43:10] and uh they would stand up while he was
[43:12] preaching and they would use this
[43:13] certain phrase and he said they just say
[43:15] it and sit back down. And he said, "Come
[43:17] to find out it meant 3* 7." And he said,
[43:20] so he went to him after service and he
[43:21] said, "What does this little phrase you
[43:23] all are using mean?" And they said, "It
[43:25] means keep it coming. Keep it coming."
[43:27] And amen. And he uh got to preach and he
[43:29] stopped and he said, "Lord, keep it
[43:30] coming." And I I believe that's the way
[43:32] the bride is in this hour. Amen. We're
[43:34] just asking, Lord, keep that revelation
[43:36] coming and the power of God moving. And
[43:38] Amen. It is a real honor to be here
[43:40] tonight with you. We want to thank you,
[43:42] brother Ben, for this opportunity to be
[43:44] here tonight and speak to the church.
[43:45] And amen. Always enjoy coming this way
[43:47] and seeing our friends here and being
[43:49] with brother Ben, his family, and
[43:51] brother Joel. And amen, as it is Haven's
[43:54] first time to Hardy. So, amen, we're
[43:55] we're thankful to have her here with us
[43:57] tonight. And do want to uh thank you all
[43:59] on behalf of our pastor there, Brother
[44:01] Matt, and the Saints at Grace Tabernacle
[44:03] for the support of the meetings last
[44:05] week. And brother Ben, we do appreciate
[44:06] you bringing the assembly down there.
[44:08] And I know you all believe this missed
[44:10] your Wednesday night to come be with us,
[44:11] and that means more to us than you
[44:13] realize. And we really appreciate that.
[44:15] and appreciate the the arm of fellowship
[44:17] and Amen. Good to see all the folks here
[44:19] with us tonight from the church that
[44:21] came and Amen. I I know uh there's a lot
[44:24] a lot of folks may be out tonight, but
[44:26] there's one thing I do know. I know that
[44:28] we're two or three are gathered in his
[44:30] name that he made a promise he would
[44:32] come and be with them. And amen, it is
[44:34] sure good to be here tonight. Good to
[44:35] see you, Sister Karine. God bless you.
[44:37] Amen. How how'd you get here? Did you
[44:39] drive or Amen.
[44:42] Amen. That's a we was in a meeting one
[44:44] night. in Louisiana. And I asked her how
[44:46] she got there and she said, "Well, I
[44:47] drove." Amen. Or ask me how I got there.
[44:50] And I said, "Well, I drove." So, every
[44:51] time we see each other now to meet, we
[44:53] just say, "How'd you get there?" Amen.
[44:55] But it it's sure good to see Sister
[44:56] Karine. We sure love and appreciate her
[44:58] and brother Phil. And Amen. We want
[45:00] tonight before we open the word, maybe
[45:02] just bow our hearts for a word of
[45:03] prayer. I know it's a a Wednesday
[45:05] evening, but I know the Lord is mindful
[45:07] of all the needs among us. And maybe you
[45:09] just slip your hands up and say, "Lord,
[45:11] come by my way tonight. I I know he's
[45:13] mindful of every need." and he'll speak
[45:14] to every heart. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[45:17] as we've gathered here on this Wednesday
[45:19] afternoon, Father, we've not gathered
[45:21] here to be seen or to be heard, but
[45:24] Lord, we've gathered here to do one
[45:25] thing, and that is to lift up the name
[45:27] that is above every name, and that is
[45:29] your name, the Lord Jesus Christ. For
[45:32] Lord, at that name, Lord, demons have to
[45:34] flee. At that name, Lord, spirits are
[45:37] broken. Father, at that name, sick
[45:39] bodies become well. Father, at that
[45:42] name, empty vessels are filled with your
[45:44] very presence and spirit. So Lord, we've
[45:46] come here tonight to speak the name of
[45:48] Jesus. Lord, you see every hand that was
[45:51] raised here tonight. And Lord, behind
[45:53] that hand, there is a need. Now, Father,
[45:56] I pray that your great anointing would
[45:58] come among us tonight. And Lord, we'll
[46:00] be sure to lay aside the cares of life
[46:02] and the situations, oh God. And and
[46:05] Lord, we'll be sure to entertain your
[46:06] anointing, Lord. For Father, it's the
[46:09] anointing that destroys the yoke of the
[46:11] enemy. And Lord, I'm asking you, Lord,
[46:13] may you come by this way tonight in a
[46:15] special way. Father, as you have seen,
[46:17] Lord, those that may not be here
[46:19] tonight, some at home sick, dear God, or
[46:21] maybe we'll go back and hear this
[46:23] sermon. I pray, Lord, that you would
[46:24] reach a hand of deliverance down to
[46:27] them, Lord. Maybe in their body right
[46:29] now suffering with symptoms, oh God.
[46:31] Lord, we rebuke those symptoms in the
[46:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May they
[46:35] leave the body of the believer, Father.
[46:37] And Lord, we pray tonight that you would
[46:39] come among us in the preaching of your
[46:41] word. Lord, may you may you give us
[46:43] wisdom and revelation tonight in your
[46:45] word. And we'll be sure, Lord, to give
[46:47] thee all the praise, all the honor, and
[46:49] all the glory. It's in the wonderful
[46:51] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[46:53] Christ. We pray. And all the believers
[46:55] says,
[46:56] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. If you have your Bibles
[46:59] tonight, we want to go to the book of
[47:00] Hebrews, the 10th chapter. The book of
[47:02] Hebrews, the 10th chapter. Amen. It is
[47:05] is an honor to to be here tonight.
[47:07] Really enjoyed that song service and
[47:09] Amen. just the presence of the Lord.
[47:11] Hebrews the 10th chapter uh tonight. We
[47:13] want to look here in Hebrews 10 and also
[47:15] Hebrews 11. Uh those of you from home
[47:18] are going to have to forgive me. Uh you
[47:20] might hear this a second time, but amen.
[47:22] In Hebrews 10 and verse number uh 35,
[47:26] Paul here writing, he says, "Now cast
[47:30] not away therefore your confidence." I I
[47:33] love how Paul makes that personal. He
[47:35] don't say, "Cast not away confidence."
[47:38] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Cast not away therefore
[47:39] your confidence."
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. Which hath great
[47:44] recompense of reward. Also want to turn
[47:47] over to Hebrews 11 and verse number six.
[47:50] Hebrews 11 and verse number six.
[47:53] Paul again here writing in the great
[47:55] heroes of faith chapter in Hebrews 11
[47:58] and 6. He says, "Now without faith it is
[48:01] impossible to please him."
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; "For he that cometh to God must believe
[48:06] that he is."
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; And that he is a rewarder of them that
[48:11] diligently seek him. Amen. He is a
[48:15] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[48:18] him. We ask the Lord this evening to
[48:20] bless the reading of his word. As you
[48:21] can have your seats here tonight from
[48:23] those uh verses of scripture, if I would
[48:26] take a title tonight, I want to talk to
[48:27] you for a few moments on this. There's a
[48:30] reward coming. Amen. There's a reward
[48:33] coming. 1963, the prophet of God is
[48:36] preaching, God doesn't call man to
[48:38] judgment without first warning him. He
[48:40] said, now there is a coming blessing
[48:43] just as the same as there is a coming
[48:45] wrath. He said, oh, we have to be
[48:47] looking for one of it tonight. You
[48:49] either have to be looking, amen, for the
[48:52] wrath to fall upon you and for
[48:54] destruction or either you have to be
[48:56] looking for the resurrection of the Lord
[48:58] Jesus. He said the same God that
[49:00] promised one promise the other. So there
[49:03] is a promise, amen, of a coming wrath
[49:05] which will bring a destruction. But then
[49:08] there is a promise of the resurrection.
[49:10] Now I I've just recently been studying
[49:12] and speaking here out of Hebrews 10 on
[49:14] casting not away, amen, your spiritual
[49:17] confidence. And when you when you look
[49:18] there at that spiritual confidence, it
[49:20] is a deep unwavering belief and trust in
[49:24] the higher power in divine wisdom. He
[49:27] says now that resides in one's own soul.
[49:30] It means to provides inner strength and
[49:32] resilience to navigate life's
[49:34] challenges. Amen. Spiritual confidence
[49:37] is not pride or arrogance. Amen. But it
[49:40] is a humble conviction that is rooted in
[49:43] one's connection. Amen. to something
[49:45] that is greater than oneself. Amen.
[49:48] Spiritual confidence leads to peace and
[49:50] love and a fearless approach, amen, to
[49:53] life's uncertainties. I I wonder how
[49:56] many tonight could testify that life is
[49:58] full, amen, of uncertainties. Whether,
[50:01] Amen, it's in the natural life or in the
[50:03] spiritual life, the world we're living
[50:05] in, Amen, is full of uncertainties. I I
[50:08] think it's powerful there that another
[50:10] meaning of spiritual confidence is
[50:12] actually, Amen. spiritual revelation. So
[50:15] when one has amen, a spiritual
[50:18] confidence, they have a spiritual
[50:20] revelation. Now I love there what Paul
[50:22] says. He says, "Cast not away." Amen.
[50:25] Therefore your spiritual confidence or
[50:28] your confidence because there is a
[50:29] recompense of reward. When you look
[50:31] there at that recompense of reward, it
[50:34] is a repayment. Amen. Or a compensation
[50:37] that is given as a reward. And it is
[50:40] often for good actions, faithfulness, or
[50:42] service. Amen. Amen. I want to begin
[50:45] tonight by saying this. We are not
[50:47] serving God simply. Amen. For a reward.
[50:50] Brother Brandon said, "If I am condemned
[50:52] when I come up before the judgment seat
[50:54] of God at the end time, if it is planned
[50:56] that way and I have to stand in his
[50:58] presence and he points his majestic
[51:01] finger at me and says, "Depart from me."
[51:03] He said, "Now, if I keep this same
[51:05] attitude that I have now," he said, "and
[51:08] I be in hell, I will still love him."
[51:11] See? Amen. He's just. I deserve to go
[51:13] there at the first place. And if I knew
[51:16] that I was going to be condemned and
[51:18] know now that I would be condemned at
[51:20] the end after I worked for him a 100
[51:22] years from now, amen, I would still
[51:25] desire to work for him. He said, "If
[51:28] there would be no heaven and if there
[51:30] would be no reward, I still want to be a
[51:33] Christian." Amen. I don't know about
[51:35] you, but that's my testimony tonight.
[51:37] Amen. If there's no heaven and there's
[51:39] no reward, Amen. I still want to be a
[51:42] Christian. He said, "It's just a perfect
[51:44] satisfaction. It's something." Amen.
[51:46] That peace, it just passes all
[51:48] understanding. He said, "I wouldn't
[51:50] trade it for nothing. I've tried
[51:52] everything that I was big enough to do
[51:54] and a lot of things I wasn't big enough
[51:56] to do." He said, "I tried anyhow, but
[51:59] I've never met anything that filled me
[52:01] to perfection." Amen. Nothing had ever
[52:04] touched the borders until one night.
[52:06] Amen. Jesus Christ come in this poor
[52:08] Irish heart of mine. Amen. And it made
[52:11] me a different person. Amen. I wonder
[52:13] how many can testify that same Jesus.
[52:16] Amen. Came into my heart. And when he
[52:19] come into my heart, he filled me. Amen.
[52:21] With the perfect satisfaction of his
[52:23] presence. And there's nothing the devil
[52:25] can do. Amen. To change the love of God
[52:28] that has been revealed unto my heart. My
[52:31] when I think about God's rewards, I I'm
[52:34] happy to announce to you tonight. Amen.
[52:36] They are not temporary.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God gives a reward, it's
[52:41] an eternal reward. The prophet of God
[52:44] said, "All too little time, amen, is
[52:46] spent on laboring for the eternal
[52:48] rewards of God." He said, "The
[52:50] recompense of God is too lightly
[52:53] esteemed." If we believe in the reality
[52:55] of the resurrection of the body and an
[52:58] eternal kingdom of substance, then we
[53:00] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[53:02] treasures that are available to the
[53:05] faithful saints. Amen. That's my desire
[53:08] is not just to be a church member. Amen.
[53:10] My desire is not just to go to church
[53:12] and amen punch a religious time clock.
[53:15] Amen. But my desire is to be a faithful
[53:17] servant unto God. Now, if I'm going to
[53:19] be faithful, that means the devil's
[53:21] going to be after me. Amen. If you're
[53:23] going to be faithful, that means the
[53:25] devil is going to be after you. And the
[53:27] prophet of God would show us, amen, that
[53:29] Satan is not only working, amen, but
[53:32] he's working overtime. Amen. What he's
[53:34] trying to do is he's trying to knock the
[53:37] spiritual confidence out of you, amen,
[53:39] that God has instilled in you. In 1959,
[53:43] brother Re's preaching on Elijah the
[53:45] prophet and he says, "Now watch after
[53:47] your Mount Carmel." Amen. You're going
[53:49] to have a juniper tree. Whenever a man
[53:52] has a blessing and the power of God
[53:55] pours down and does something for you,
[53:58] he said, "Look out." Amen. Satan is on
[54:00] that track. Amen. How many can testify
[54:03] of that? Have a good Sunday. Amen. But
[54:05] watch that Monday. Amen. Amen. Have a
[54:07] good Wednesday, but watch that Thursday.
[54:09] He said, just remember the next day.
[54:11] Amen. It's going to be a hard thing.
[54:14] Amen. Because he's going to do
[54:15] everything he can. Amen. To knock that
[54:18] confidence out of you that the Holy
[54:20] Spirit instilled in you the day before.
[54:23] Now, it is very important to note, amen,
[54:26] who is instilling the confidence. Right.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; If a preacher instills the confidence,
[54:32] then a preacher can take it away. But my
[54:35] Bible says in Romans 15:13, Amen. that
[54:38] the God of hope would fill you. Amen.
[54:40] With all joy and peace and believing
[54:43] that you may abound in hope, amen,
[54:45] through the power of the Holy Ghost.
[54:47] Listen, this is not just a preacher
[54:49] showing up on Sunday and showing up on
[54:52] Wednesday feeding you with the things of
[54:54] God. But this is the Holy Ghost of the
[54:56] Bible. Amen. coming down in
[54:58] manifestation and power. Amen. Filling
[55:01] your life with joy and peace and glory.
[55:04] My I say the Holy Ghost has instilled.
[55:07] Amen. The confidence in you. Amen. I
[55:10] love that word instill. It means to
[55:12] gradually but firmly establish. Amen. An
[55:16] attitude or an idea. Amen. In a person's
[55:19] mind, amen. I say the Holy Spirit is
[55:21] here tonight. He is here to instill in
[55:24] our hearts the faith that was once
[55:26] delivered unto the saints. I love what a
[55:29] prophet said. He said, "I pray God that
[55:31] you will instill in our hearts," Amen.
[55:34] the power of the resurrected Jesus. He
[55:36] said if the sick person can ever meet
[55:38] God, that no matter how crippled you
[55:41] remain, how sick you remain, how blind
[55:44] you remain, you ever meet God, Amen,
[55:46] there's something that sinks into you,
[55:49] Amen, that you don't see any more of the
[55:52] circumstances, but you look at what God
[55:54] said. Amen. God could ever get a way
[55:56] down to the cares of life into your
[55:59] heart and instill a faith there. He
[56:02] said, "Then there's nothing in the world
[56:04] will ever shake you from it." Listen,
[56:06] that's a God of God I'm talking about.
[56:08] Amen. You may be sick. You may be broke.
[56:11] You may be crippled. But if the Holy
[56:14] Ghost ever establishes, Amen. Confidence
[56:16] in your heart. Amen. The symptoms won't
[56:19] change it. Hey, the troubles won't
[56:21] change it. Amen. Cloudy days won't
[56:23] change it. Cuz it's not coming from a
[56:25] man. It's coming from the God of
[56:27] Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. And he has
[56:30] instilled in your heart, amen, an
[56:32] attitude and a confidence. My, it's
[56:36] spiritual warfare when a man meets God.
[56:38] Now, amen. You all realize this is not
[56:40] something, Amen. the devil's going to
[56:42] let you easily hold on to. Amen. The
[56:45] devil's not going to easily let you hold
[56:47] on to your spiritual confidence. If you
[56:50] ever get it, you're going to fight to
[56:51] keep it. Yes, sir.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Well, can I preach? If you ever get it,
[56:56] you're going to fight to keep it. But
[56:57] that's why Paul would say in Hebrews
[56:59] 3:14, he says we are made partakers of
[57:02] Christ. That if we hold the beginning of
[57:05] our confidence, amen, steadfast unto the
[57:08] end. So it's not enough just to have it
[57:10] when you start, but you got to hold it
[57:13] steadfast until the end. See, look what
[57:15] brother Brandon said. He said, I think
[57:17] it's come to a time that when we've got
[57:19] to know how we stand. How can you do
[57:22] anything unless you got faith in what
[57:24] you're doing? How can you do it? You got
[57:26] to have faith. And that's my purpose of
[57:29] doing this with the church here is to
[57:31] give the believers faith and confidence
[57:34] in what they're standing for because
[57:37] it's the word of the Lord. He said that
[57:39] as long as to the scripture, it is
[57:41] sovereignly placed from Genesis into
[57:43] Revelation, back and forth, amen, up and
[57:46] down. Now listen at a prophet, he's not
[57:48] just throwing you a sermon. Amen. He's
[57:50] not just making you feel good, but he's
[57:53] taken the Bible from Genesis unto
[57:55] Revelation. Amen. From the top to the
[57:58] bottom. Amen. And he's given you a place
[58:00] to stand. And that would make a way no
[58:02] way for the devil to move in there.
[58:05] Amen. Then you got perfect confidence.
[58:07] That's why the devil hates this message
[58:10] is because this message opens the Bible
[58:13] and makes it a new book and it gives you
[58:15] a place to stand where no devil can whip
[58:18] you. Hey, I think it's time to let that
[58:20] devil know who we are. We're not a bunch
[58:23] of church members. We're not a bunch of
[58:25] religious folks. We are the sons and
[58:27] daughters of God that have been baptized
[58:29] with the Holy Ghost and fire and have
[58:31] been given a place to stand by the
[58:33] positionally scriptural or placing of
[58:36] the word of God. My, when I think about
[58:38] that, there's some people here tonight
[58:40] that knows where they're standing.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. I say this. Amen. I don't
[58:45] believe you're a group of people tonight
[58:46] that guesses where you're standing on
[58:48] water baptism. Amen. I don't think
[58:50] you're a group of people tonight. Amen.
[58:52] That guesses where you're standing on
[58:54] predestination or guesses where you're
[58:56] standing on the Godhead. Prophet of God
[58:58] said, "You ever notice how Satan how he
[59:00] hates two books of the Bible more than
[59:02] all others." Amen. Through liberal
[59:04] theologians and persuades, he is always
[59:08] attacking the book of Genesis and the
[59:10] book of Revelation. It is in both of
[59:12] these books that we find Satan's origin,
[59:15] his awful ways and his destruction. He
[59:18] said that is why he attacks them. He
[59:21] hates to be exposed. And in those books,
[59:24] he is exposed for exactly what he is.
[59:27] That's why Jesus said, Amen, that Satan
[59:30] has no part in me, Brother Brian, and I
[59:33] have no part in him. Amen. The devil
[59:36] would like to prove that different, but
[59:38] he cannot. Amen. So he does all that he
[59:41] can to destroy the confidence in the
[59:44] word. And when the church listen but
[59:47] when the church will disbelieve Satan
[59:49] and will believe the spirit's revelation
[59:52] of the word then the gates of hell
[59:55] cannot prevail against her. Listen, when
[59:58] you quit believing the devil and start
[1:00:00] believing the spirit of truth, it will
[1:00:03] release a confidence in your heart that
[1:00:05] no matter what tomorrow holds, no matter
[1:00:08] what next week holds, I got a revelation
[1:00:10] in my soul of who holds my future and
[1:00:14] come hell or high water, I'm going to
[1:00:16] make it by the grace of God.
[1:00:19] My to think tonight, amen, that Satan is
[1:00:21] trying to knock that confidence out
[1:00:23] because he knows there's a reward coming
[1:00:27] to the confidence.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Now listen, there's no reward coming to
[1:00:31] our feelings.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; There's no reward coming to emotions,
[1:00:35] but there's a reward coming to the
[1:00:38] confidence. You read in Genesis 15:1,
[1:00:41] the Bible says, "After these things,"
[1:00:43] Amen, "The word of the Lord came unto
[1:00:45] Abram in a vision." And here's what it
[1:00:47] said. It said, "Fear not, Abram. I am
[1:00:51] thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:00:53] reward."
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; My my my. So, there we find that the
[1:00:58] source of Abraham's confidence was
[1:01:00] coming from the word.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram picks this up and he reads
[1:01:04] and he says, "I am thy shield."
[1:01:07] Now, if God is your shield, then how's
[1:01:10] the devil going to hit you?
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If God is your shield,
[1:01:14] then how is the devil going to hit you?
[1:01:17] Amen. You got to quit letting the devil
[1:01:19] make you an easy target. Amen. If God is
[1:01:21] your shield, Amen. Then how can the
[1:01:24] devil get to you? He said, see, I am
[1:01:26] your shield and your exceeding great
[1:01:28] reward. Who is I am? Amen. The Lord,
[1:01:32] your exceeding great reward. Now, I want
[1:01:35] you to notice here, Brother Ben, there
[1:01:37] is a shield and then there's a reward.
[1:01:40] There is a shield and there's a reward,
[1:01:43] which is signifying there's a battle,
[1:01:45] amen, between the time of the promise
[1:01:47] and the reward that comes to that
[1:01:49] promise. But in Ephesians 6:16, Paul
[1:01:52] says, "Above all, amen, taking the
[1:01:55] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[1:01:58] able, amen, to quench some of the fiery
[1:02:01] darts." Amen. A few of the fiery darts,
[1:02:04] three of the fiery darts. Paul said
[1:02:07] you'll be able to quench all the fiery
[1:02:09] darts. Amen. Of the wicked, Amen. Now,
[1:02:12] you know what a shield is, don't you?
[1:02:14] Amen. A shield, Brother David, is a
[1:02:16] large oblong, Amen. four cornered
[1:02:19] shield. Amen. Now, come on, folks. Amen.
[1:02:22] It don't take a scientist to realize
[1:02:24] that there are four gospels in the
[1:02:26] Bible, which if you believe all four,
[1:02:28] it'll make you a full gospel believer.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I love what a
[1:02:35] prophet said. He said, "I got a uniform
[1:02:37] on and I'm in the army of the Lord."
[1:02:39] Amen. I'm fighting the foes of the
[1:02:41] wicked, but I'm dressed. You might not
[1:02:43] be able to see it, but I know it's
[1:02:45] there. Amen. I feel it. the armor of
[1:02:47] God. He said, "The full gospel in my
[1:02:50] heart?" Well, glory to God. If you got
[1:02:53] the full gospel in your heart, Amen.
[1:02:55] What devil can take you out? What spirit
[1:02:58] can bind you? What demon can discourage
[1:03:01] you? I'm talking about a people who have
[1:03:03] been shielded with the faith of almighty
[1:03:06] God. Hallelujah. He said, "Our armor is
[1:03:09] on the inside of us." Amen. I love what
[1:03:12] he says in the true Easter Seal. He
[1:03:14] says, "Above all things," Amen. Take the
[1:03:16] shield of faith and move forward. Come
[1:03:21] on, church. You can't lay here, Abraham.
[1:03:23] Amen. There's a battle, but there's a
[1:03:25] reward coming. Amen. There's a battle,
[1:03:27] but there's a reward coming. And I tell
[1:03:29] you tonight, church, you may be in a
[1:03:31] battle tonight. Amen. But put on the
[1:03:33] shield of faith. Get the sword of the
[1:03:36] spirit in your hand. Get your feet shine
[1:03:38] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:03:40] peace and move forward.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there's going to be a
[1:03:45] reward, Amen. then there's got to be a
[1:03:48] rewarder.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; If there's going to be a reward, brother
[1:03:51] Joel, there's got to be somebody that's
[1:03:54] going to be the rewarder. In Hebrews
[1:03:57] 11:6 in the Amplified Bible, Paul says,
[1:03:59] "Without faith, it is impossible." That
[1:04:02] means to walk with God and to please
[1:04:05] him. For whoever comes near to God,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:04:09] Whoever comes near to God must
[1:04:12] necessarily believe that God exists.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I like to preach all
[1:04:18] night on that. Amen. If you ever come
[1:04:20] near to God, Brother Job, the first
[1:04:22] thing you got to do is acknowledge that
[1:04:25] God exists
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; and that he rewards those who will
[1:04:29] earnestly and diligently seek him.
[1:04:32] Brother said, "Now this in the first
[1:04:33] sermon, I love it that's ever recorded
[1:04:35] on tape. Faith is the substance. 1947 he
[1:04:39] said this is the keynote to the
[1:04:41] scripture faith. See he that cometh to
[1:04:44] God must believe that he is and that he
[1:04:48] is a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:04:51] seek him. Listen, God don't set you out.
[1:04:54] Amen. Seeking something without there
[1:04:57] being a reward to the desire you're
[1:04:59] seeking for. Brother said, "Maybe that's
[1:05:01] why that sickness is on you. That God
[1:05:04] has to educate you to a place that he
[1:05:07] is." Amen. A rewarder of those who
[1:05:09] diligently seek him. Maybe that's what
[1:05:11] your faith has given to you. That's why
[1:05:13] the sickness come upon you to test your
[1:05:16] faith. Then you can walk out here in
[1:05:18] Phoenix or Douglas or wherever you're
[1:05:20] from and you can say, "I know. I know.
[1:05:25] Nobody can tell me I know he's a
[1:05:27] healer." Well, I don't think we got to
[1:05:29] go to Phoenix. I don't think we got to
[1:05:31] go to Douglas tonight. I believe there's
[1:05:33] some Holy Ghost filled believers right
[1:05:35] here in Hardy, Arkansas that can walk
[1:05:38] out on the streets of Hardy. You can
[1:05:40] walk out on the streets of Black Rockck.
[1:05:42] You can walk out on the streets of
[1:05:43] Mammoth and you can say, "I know my God
[1:05:46] is a healer. I know my God is a savior.
[1:05:49] I know my God is a deliverer because I
[1:05:52] met him and he imparted a revelation in
[1:05:55] my soul."
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My only way you can say I
[1:05:59] know is by experience.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That's the only way you
[1:06:03] can say I know is by an experience.
[1:06:06] That's why Paul said that no man can say
[1:06:10] that Jesus is the Lord.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; But by the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I just got to say what a prophet
[1:06:18] said. He said, "Every man that will come
[1:06:20] to Christ and will believe that he is."
[1:06:23] Now, I wish I was a singer right now.
[1:06:24] I'd sing my buddy Josh Bennett song. God
[1:06:27] is God. Amen. You got to come to God and
[1:06:30] you got to believe God is.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; What good does it do to believe God was?
[1:06:35] Come on. Amen. How would I help you
[1:06:36] tonight if I come here and I only
[1:06:39] believe, Sister Vicki, that God was and
[1:06:41] God used to do something and God used to
[1:06:43] move and God used to heal? How would I
[1:06:46] help the church if I come here tonight?
[1:06:48] Amen. Believing God will be in the
[1:06:50] millennium, but I didn't come here
[1:06:51] tonight believing just God was or
[1:06:53] believing just God will be. But I came
[1:06:56] here tonight with a full assurance in my
[1:06:58] heart that God is a savior. Hallelujah.
[1:07:01] God is a healer. And no matter what
[1:07:04] you're facing tonight, God is more than
[1:07:06] able to walk in on the condition and
[1:07:08] change it because he's an everpresent
[1:07:11] God.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; My you got to believe that he is
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of those who
[1:07:19] seek him. You got to give up your sins.
[1:07:22] Remember said, "And throw open your arms
[1:07:24] to God." Now listen, you can have. Ain't
[1:07:28] that powerful? You can have not
[1:07:31] something that looks like it.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Some imitation of it,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; but a genuine heart full
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; of the real baptism
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; like it fell on the day of Pentecost.
[1:07:47] Now listen, the faith of God that has
[1:07:50] been instilled in a believer's heart is
[1:07:53] what's causing them to expect things.
[1:07:56] See, that's what Job said in Job 5'8. He
[1:07:58] said, "I would seek unto God, and unto
[1:08:01] God would I commit my cause,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; which doeth great things."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Brother David, are you a witness? God
[1:08:07] doeth great things.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, unsearchable.
[1:08:12] Amen. Marvelous things without number. I
[1:08:15] love what a prophet says. He says, "God
[1:08:18] will do great things for you if you'll
[1:08:20] only believe."
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; But you must believe that he is
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; and that he's a rewarder of those who
[1:08:28] diligently seek him. Now, I got to say
[1:08:30] what brother said here. He said, "You
[1:08:32] can't sit half dead
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and believe some kind of a cold doctrine
[1:08:36] and then expect to get something from
[1:08:38] God."
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You've got to believe that he
[1:08:42] is and that he's a rewarder of those who
[1:08:45] diligently seek him. Well, I feel like
[1:08:47] shouting tonight. Amen. Thank God,
[1:08:49] brother Danny. We're not gathered in the
[1:08:51] house of God. Amen. Under a thermometer
[1:08:54] 40 below zero. Amen. Pumping cold and
[1:08:56] bombing fluid. But there is a fire in
[1:08:59] the house of God. There is a reality
[1:09:01] burning in the soul of every believer
[1:09:03] here tonight that whatever you expect,
[1:09:06] God is able to do it.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I don't think it's
[1:09:10] time to cool off. If you're cooling off,
[1:09:13] I think it's time to move closer to the
[1:09:14] fire. Amen. If worldlyism is creeping in
[1:09:17] your life, I think it's time to move
[1:09:19] closer to the fire of God and let the
[1:09:21] fire of God burn it out. Amen. If Oh,
[1:09:24] God. Can I preach? If unbelief is
[1:09:27] creeping into your confession, I think
[1:09:29] it's time to get back close to the fire
[1:09:31] and let the fire of God melt the icicles
[1:09:34] of unbelief off of your confession where
[1:09:37] you can stand with a testimony that'll
[1:09:39] shake the shingles off of the roof. God
[1:09:41] is a savior. God is a healer. God is a
[1:09:46] Holy Ghost.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it. Amen. I
[1:09:50] believe what a prophet said. He said,
[1:09:52] "It's become such a place till the
[1:09:54] spirit of God has been grieved."
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And any church,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; that's brother Brandon right here,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; "That denies the supernatural,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; it'll die as sure as I'm standing in
[1:10:09] this pullpit,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; any church
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; that denies the supernatural." Now, I
[1:10:17] could I could preach there for a second.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't deny your version of the
[1:10:21] supernatural.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; But denies the Bible supernatural.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Now watch a prophet. Because Satan
[1:10:29] introduce the idea that the supernatural
[1:10:32] isn't real.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Now I got a question for you.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram asked questions. Is that
[1:10:38] okay?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "How do you know unless you
[1:10:41] taste and see?"
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "See, and know that he's
[1:10:47] the rewarder of those
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; who would diligently seek after him, not
[1:10:51] those who stand back and criticize."
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I just got to say it, folks.
[1:10:56] Criticizing will cause you to lose
[1:10:57] faith.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; If there's anything that'll start drying
[1:11:00] up your faith as a believer is when an
[1:11:03] old critical devil gets on you and you
[1:11:05] start criticizing everything and
[1:11:07] everybody and every song and every
[1:11:08] preacher. Oh, God. Amen. Reverson said
[1:11:11] if we lose faith, he said, then we'll
[1:11:13] never get a prayer answered by God. For
[1:11:16] he that cometh to God must first believe
[1:11:18] that he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:11:21] diligently seek after him. So if we lose
[1:11:24] faith, then our prayers are anulled. He
[1:11:27] says we get nowhere. So it's all that we
[1:11:29] can think of this morning is to hold on
[1:11:32] to faith. Amen. If you was with me last
[1:11:34] Wednesday, you heard it. Stand strong in
[1:11:37] the battle of faith. You got to hold on
[1:11:39] to faith. Then if we lose faith, amen,
[1:11:42] all our hopes is gone. Now listen,
[1:11:44] church, the minute faith dies is the
[1:11:47] minute hope begins to dry up.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm telling the truth. Amen.
[1:11:52] See, but if we lose faith, now watch
[1:11:54] this. And if we lose faith, then all our
[1:11:57] spiritual reality is gone.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; For you cannot have faith in things you
[1:12:02] see, for the things you see are all
[1:12:05] perishable. Amen. So if you put your
[1:12:07] faith in perishable things, then you're
[1:12:10] going to perish with the things you put
[1:12:12] your faith in. But my Bible says the
[1:12:15] things that are not seen, amen, are real
[1:12:17] and are eternal.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; My then I can tell you tonight, the new
[1:12:21] birth is the only way for God to bring
[1:12:25] spiritual reality into a human being.
[1:12:28] You cannot have faith until you're born
[1:12:30] again. Statue of a perfect man, bottom
[1:12:32] of the pyramid, can't get nowhere
[1:12:33] without the foundation of faith.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. I know a
[1:12:37] lot of guys teach statue of a perfect
[1:12:39] man. But let's come back to the way
[1:12:40] brother Brandham taught it. He taught a
[1:12:42] new birth and then he taught add to your
[1:12:44] virtues.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I know a lot of people then and I'll
[1:12:48] just say it very plainly and move on.
[1:12:50] But I I I feel liberty to say it.
[1:12:52] There's a birth and there's an adoption,
[1:12:54] folks.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's it.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Ram taught. Amen.
[1:12:58] Now, there's a people on the earth
[1:13:00] that's been born again.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; See, that's the thing about it. There's
[1:13:04] a people on the earth that's been born
[1:13:06] again. Listen. That will see. Is
[1:13:09] everybody okay?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; That will see the spiritual and little
[1:13:14] realities of the body change.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not you fighting for
[1:13:18] nothing.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; This is not you confessing the promises
[1:13:22] of God over sick loved ones and over
[1:13:25] your family and over your health and
[1:13:27] over your church in vain. There's a
[1:13:29] reward coming to that confession.
[1:13:31] There's a reality coming to that desire.
[1:13:34] Brother Ben said, "Oh," he said, "Oh, I
[1:13:36] want to see him." How many says, "Oh, I
[1:13:38] want to see him. I want to see the hour
[1:13:41] that I could look and see all these old
[1:13:44] bodies transformed and see them changed
[1:13:47] in a moment, in a twinkle." Listen,
[1:13:49] folks, that's not a pipe dream. That's
[1:13:51] not an imagination. That is a spoken
[1:13:54] word of God that will have a fulfillment
[1:13:57] in a body of flesh.
[1:13:59] Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; If that isn't so, then we're the most
[1:14:02] foolish people.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow
[1:14:07] you die. Amen. See, you're just like an
[1:14:09] animal. You die and go to the dirt and
[1:14:12] that's all.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Now listen now. And then I'll say this.
[1:14:15] Amen. I I there's an immortal soul
[1:14:18] living in you.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's let me back up a
[1:14:24] second. I feel that hovering there.
[1:14:25] There is a birth
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and there is an adoption.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; And that's in the adoption series. And
[1:14:30] and I thank God for for men of God like
[1:14:32] brother Ben that'll preach it way
[1:14:33] brother Ram said it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's one of our points of fellowship
[1:14:36] is a man will just read what brother Ram
[1:14:38] said and preach it.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; We don't need no elder to get all high
[1:14:42] and mighty and correct the way brother
[1:14:43] taught it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; See there's an immortal soul. Let me
[1:14:47] move on. There's an immortal soul living
[1:14:49] in you, brother. We have done heard from
[1:14:52] heaven. Come on.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask y'all this. How are you
[1:14:55] here on a Wednesday night, church?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Some of you all are
[1:15:00] going through things right now that you
[1:15:02] don't even feel like being here.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; But you're here anyhow.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; You're going through changes and
[1:15:08] situations and and structural changes
[1:15:11] and all kinds of things happen, but
[1:15:13] you're here anyhow.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you why? Because the
[1:15:17] prophet said, "We've done heard from
[1:15:19] heaven. We've done seen it proven. We
[1:15:22] know that he is and we know that a
[1:15:25] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:15:27] him. You say, "Brother Andrew, how does
[1:15:30] a believer hear from heaven?" I wondered
[1:15:32] that same thing, Brother Joel, when I
[1:15:34] got over in the book of Matthew about
[1:15:36] the 16th chapter and the 17th verse. And
[1:15:39] the Bible said Jesus answered and said
[1:15:42] unto him,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:15:47] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; For flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:15:53] unto thee, but my father which is in
[1:15:56] heaven.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Now come on church. How many will agree
[1:15:59] the father was in Jesus? In the
[1:16:02] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:16:04] with God and the word was God and the
[1:16:08] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:16:10] Then all that was in God he poured into
[1:16:13] Christ. Then whatever was in heaven was
[1:16:16] in Jesus in flesh on the earth. Oh
[1:16:19] church of the living God. Amen. Heaven
[1:16:21] was in Jesus. Amen. When they heard
[1:16:24] Jesus speaking, they were hearing from
[1:16:26] heaven. They were not hearing from the
[1:16:28] local rabbi. They were not hearing from
[1:16:30] the local seminary. They were hearing
[1:16:32] from heaven. Oh, can I say it to you the
[1:16:34] way I believe it? I believe heaven was
[1:16:37] speaking. And I believe heaven is
[1:16:38] speaking today. And I want to tell that
[1:16:41] devil, heaven has a voice and heaven has
[1:16:44] an audience.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. And I am a part of
[1:16:49] the audience of heaven.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Heaven has spoken. Oh, brother. Is it
[1:16:54] beautiful about Job? He said Satan
[1:16:56] thought he could twist him around a
[1:16:58] little bit and he could cuff him up and
[1:17:00] make him do it. Amen. But you see Job
[1:17:03] with his perfect revelation of God and
[1:17:07] who God was. Now, now how many say,
[1:17:09] "Lord, give me a perfect revelation of
[1:17:11] who God is." Amen. Lord, fill me with a
[1:17:15] perfect revelation of who God was and
[1:17:18] who God is. But listen, Job's revelation
[1:17:21] went beyond that. You know what a
[1:17:23] prophet said? He had a perfect
[1:17:25] revelation of how God loved him.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Hey, I tell you, sometimes,
[1:17:33] Amen. All your quotes and scriptures on
[1:17:35] the Godhead won't defeat the devil on a
[1:17:37] bad day. Amen. Sometimes all your quotes
[1:17:40] and all your theology on predestination
[1:17:43] won't defeat the devil on a bad day. But
[1:17:45] when you can reach way down in the
[1:17:47] depths of your soul and begin to draw
[1:17:50] from the perfect revelation that is
[1:17:52] dwelling in your soul, God loves me.
[1:17:55] It'll put every devil in hell on the
[1:17:57] run. The world may be again me. The
[1:18:00] church may be against me. My friends may
[1:18:02] be against me. But oh, the love of God,
[1:18:06] God loves me.
[1:18:10] He loves me when the sick people that's
[1:18:13] in the building tonight that's crippled
[1:18:15] or you that have the need of God when
[1:18:17] you can get that type of revelation.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Oh church, that's a type of revelation I
[1:18:22] want is a perfect revelation because a
[1:18:26] perfect revelation produces a perfect
[1:18:29] confidence. Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get that type of
[1:18:34] revelation that you are justified,
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; when you are actually justified in
[1:18:40] asking the thing you're asking for and
[1:18:43] you believe that he is a rewarder of
[1:18:46] those that diligently seek after him,
[1:18:49] are y'all ready for this? Then there's
[1:18:51] nothing, oh God. Then there is nothing,
[1:18:55] amen, that can ever separate you from
[1:18:58] the faith that's anchored to you.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God, church. That ought to make
[1:19:03] you shout hallelujah. When the perfect
[1:19:06] revelation of the love of God ever
[1:19:08] strikes the soul of a bornagain human,
[1:19:11] that is more than just a church
[1:19:13] anchoring to you. It's more than your
[1:19:15] pastor anchoring to you, but it's faith
[1:19:18] anchoring to your life. Oh my. Can I go
[1:19:21] ahead and say it, brother Joel? That's
[1:19:23] how you get out of every trouble. That's
[1:19:25] how we overcome every situation. It's
[1:19:28] because we're not anchored to the
[1:19:29] church. Brother David, the church might
[1:19:31] change. Amen. Preachers might change.
[1:19:34] Moves and the message might change. But
[1:19:36] if the faith of Abraham ever anchors to
[1:19:39] the soul of a believer, no matter how
[1:19:41] low they'll go, they'll feel a tug, but
[1:19:44] it'll be a faith tug. It'll be the faith
[1:19:46] of God pulling them out of the
[1:19:48] situation.
[1:19:51] Oh, I feel the pull, brother David.
[1:19:54] Hallelujah. I feel the pull of it
[1:19:56] tonight. I feel it, Brother Jonah. I
[1:19:59] feel the pull of the faith of God
[1:20:01] saying, "You can make it. You can
[1:20:03] overcome. You can rise above it all."
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you talking
[1:20:11] about?" that after you recognized that
[1:20:14] the very word of God was eagle food, you
[1:20:17] left the other thing, you have been
[1:20:20] formed into the living image
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; of the living God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, you heard from your theophony.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Can I say it? Brother Peter, you heard
[1:20:33] from your reward.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You heard from your reward.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. What's keeping
[1:20:41] you in the battle of faith? What's
[1:20:44] keeping you positioned against old age
[1:20:46] and against sickness and against
[1:20:48] disease? Is because we've already heard
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; from our theophony which is not made
[1:20:55] with hands eternal in the heavens. It's
[1:20:58] a glorified body. It's a glorified
[1:21:01] condition. When I feel like shouting
[1:21:03] that devil plun back to hell where he
[1:21:05] come from, I may look like I'm falling
[1:21:07] apart. I may look like every devil's
[1:21:09] piled up on me, but devil just stand
[1:21:11] back cuz I'm hearing from my theophony.
[1:21:14] I'm feeling a tug from another dimension
[1:21:17] and it's pulling me up high power.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Can I just tell you
[1:21:23] tonight? Amen. Confidence has been
[1:21:26] instilled in you by your own theophony.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I know that might be a hard one to
[1:21:31] swallow, but you know what a prophet
[1:21:33] said? He said, "Your theophony is a
[1:21:36] glorified body."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Just think of it.
[1:21:41] Your glorified body is right here.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Is right here at the tabernacle. Now,
[1:21:50] the presence of the Holy Spirit, which
[1:21:53] is your glorified condition in Christ
[1:21:56] right now, you're glorified. Why don't
[1:21:59] you turn loose of your voice right now
[1:22:01] and testify against that devil and say
[1:22:04] right now in the presence of God, I'm
[1:22:07] already glorified.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "You can't prove that." I can.
[1:22:12] Romans 8, those he justified, he also
[1:22:15] glorified. Can I say what a prophet
[1:22:17] said? And your own glorified body.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Cast not away your confidence.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. your own glorified body.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; It's a direct quote. Is right here
[1:22:31] standing near you right now in Christ
[1:22:34] Jesus to give you strength like a charge
[1:22:38] going into a battery. The Holy Spirit is
[1:22:41] in you. It's to charge your body to give
[1:22:44] you new strength. Oh, I don't know about
[1:22:46] you tonight, but I raise my hand,
[1:22:48] Brother Caleb, and say, "Lord, I can use
[1:22:50] some new strength on a Wednesday night.
[1:22:53] Lord, come by my heart. Come by my pew.
[1:22:56] Amen. Hook up my theophony to my body
[1:22:59] and send some new strength into me.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It's here to charge your body, to give
[1:23:06] you new strength to heal you from the
[1:23:08] sickness that you got and to make you
[1:23:10] well.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Herald, this perfect
[1:23:14] revelation is coming from none other
[1:23:16] than our Lord Jesus Christ. And I want
[1:23:18] to say to you tonight, if Job under the
[1:23:20] blood of bulls and goats could have a
[1:23:23] perfect revelation of how God loved him,
[1:23:26] then what about a believer who is under
[1:23:28] the creative perfect blood of almighty
[1:23:31] God? I think if anybody got a right to
[1:23:33] shout and if anybody got a right to
[1:23:36] rejoice and if anybody got a right to
[1:23:38] praise God unrestricted and unlimited is
[1:23:42] the bride of Jesus Christ. We've done
[1:23:45] heard from heaven.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] Oh my. You say, "Preacher, you're
[1:23:50] getting way out there." Well, you know
[1:23:51] what Paul said? He said, "God commendeth
[1:23:53] his love towards us."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; In that while we were yet sinners,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; if we' ever get a revelation of that,
[1:24:02] we' change the way we approach new folks
[1:24:04] coming in.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's free of charge.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We quit belittling them, making
[1:24:14] fun of them.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:17] Come on.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz one time that was you.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Free of charge. Okay.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring out.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Right, brother Bruce.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. We We We ready just to
[1:24:31] Well,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; We We expect them to come clean.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I've been fishing since I was a kid.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And I ain't never cleaned a fish I
[1:24:41] didn't catch first.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. Every fish I ever
[1:24:45] caught, I cleaned it after I caught it.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes them fish can take a
[1:24:53] while to clean.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; See, but much more than being now
[1:24:59] justified by his blood, we shall be
[1:25:02] saved from wrath through him.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Look here in 1 John 4:10. here in his
[1:25:07] love. Not that we love God, but that he
[1:25:10] loved us
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; and sent his son to be the propitiation
[1:25:15] for our sins.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Sometimes you got to
[1:25:19] remember before you had your confidence,
[1:25:21] you had your sins, and we had our
[1:25:23] iniquities and we had our mistakes and
[1:25:25] our failures. And
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; come on, y'all might as well loosen up
[1:25:29] and preach a second. But God who is rich
[1:25:31] in mercy made a way to redeem us from
[1:25:34] our sins and our iniquities and to set
[1:25:37] us in a place of justification. We love
[1:25:40] him because he first loved us. You know
[1:25:43] what the prophet said? He said if the
[1:25:45] church has lost its divine revelation of
[1:25:47] the love of God, it becomes a mock and a
[1:25:51] stalk and a stumbling block to the
[1:25:53] world.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Now I just got to say what the Bible
[1:25:56] says. For the mountains shall depart and
[1:26:00] the hills be removed.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But I I'm so thankful for this, brother
[1:26:04] Ben.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; But my kindness shall not depart from
[1:26:07] thee.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Neither shall the covenant of my peace
[1:26:13] be removed.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Saith the Lord that hath mercy on me.
[1:26:18] Look in Ephesians 3:17. That Christ may
[1:26:21] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[1:26:24] being rooted and grounded in the law.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; But you being rooted and grounded in all
[1:26:29] your codes in it.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You being rooted and grounded in love.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If we don't get the
[1:26:36] love of God in the heart of a believer,
[1:26:38] then they're only doing things out of
[1:26:40] dos and don'ts and not from love.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Good. Come on.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to say what a
[1:26:50] prophet said.
[1:26:52] When a man experiences the depth of God
[1:26:54] in his life, it's an actual personal
[1:26:57] experience
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God indwelling him.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And his mind is illuminated by the
[1:27:03] wisdom and the knowledge of God through
[1:27:05] the word.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; But the depth of Satan will be in that
[1:27:09] he will attempt to destroy this.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He will as always attempt to make a
[1:27:15] substitute
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; for this reality of God. How will he do
[1:27:19] it? He will take away the knowledge of
[1:27:21] the truth of God.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He will.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He will destroy the word by putting
[1:27:25] forth his own. Yay hath God said.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Can I bring it on down?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And he will then substitute the personal
[1:27:34] Christ in our spirit.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:39] So, Satan hates the thought of there
[1:27:41] being a people in the land with the
[1:27:44] perfect revelation of who God is.
[1:27:47] Come on.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; His love for them
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; and that he's their rewarder.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; See what what the Bible says in 2
[1:27:55] Chronicles 15:7. Be ye strong,
[1:27:58] therefore, and let not your hands be
[1:28:00] weak.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; For your work shall be rewarded.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Look what David says in Psalms 18:20.
[1:28:07] The Lord rewarded me according to my
[1:28:09] righteousness. According to the
[1:28:11] cleanness of my hands hath he recompense
[1:28:14] me. in Psalms 103 and verse 10, he hath
[1:28:17] not dealt with us after our sins,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; nor rewarded us according to our
[1:28:24] iniquities. For as the heaven is high
[1:28:27] above the earth, so great is his mercy
[1:28:30] toward them that fear him. And as far as
[1:28:33] the east is from the west, so far hath
[1:28:37] he removed our transgressions from us.
[1:28:40] Well, if anybody got a righteous shout
[1:28:43] is those who've been redeemed by the
[1:28:46] hand of the Lord. You say, "Preacher,
[1:28:48] why are you shouting?" Because I know my
[1:28:50] mistakes. I know my failures. I know my
[1:28:53] humanity. I know all my stumbling blocks
[1:28:56] and all my faults and failures. But the
[1:28:58] God of Abraham has gave me a reward. And
[1:29:02] he put a sword in my hand to fight back
[1:29:04] against every devil that would try to
[1:29:06] pile my past upon me. Oh, I love what
[1:29:09] Proverbs says. Who so despiseth the word
[1:29:12] shall be destroyed.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; But he
[1:29:18] Come on.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; But he that fearth the commandment shall
[1:29:22] be rewarded.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know what Jesus said? He said,
[1:29:27] "Blessed are ye when men shall revile
[1:29:29] you and persecute you and shall say all
[1:29:32] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:29:35] my sake."
[1:29:37] Can I tell you how to handle it?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get mad and bless God. I'll meet
[1:29:41] him down on the corner of the street and
[1:29:42] I
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. You say, "Preacher, you crazy."
[1:29:52] I'm not crazy. I'm free.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm free from caring about what people
[1:29:56] think about me, about what people think
[1:29:58] about what I do, think about what I
[1:30:00] preach, think about where I go and what
[1:30:02] I say. I'm free of all that. The more
[1:30:05] they talk about me, the more I want to
[1:30:07] rejoice. The more they ridicule me, the
[1:30:09] more I want to shout. Amen. Cuz I know
[1:30:12] where my reward is coming from. It's
[1:30:14] coming from the Lord.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Rejoice for it. Great is your reward in
[1:30:19] heaven. For so persecuted they the
[1:30:21] prophets which were before you. Look at
[1:30:23] this word reward. It is used of the
[1:30:26] fruit naturally resulting from tools and
[1:30:29] endeavors. It is in both senses rewards
[1:30:32] and punishments. of the rewards which
[1:30:35] God bestows or will bestow upon good
[1:30:38] deeds and endeavors. Amen. Can I say
[1:30:40] what a prophet said in 1964? He said,
[1:30:44] "The church will never know the labor
[1:30:47] and the weary and the toil and trial
[1:30:50] that's tried to break it the message."
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; The world will never know. The church
[1:30:56] will never know the labor and the weary
[1:31:00] and toil and trial that's tried to break
[1:31:03] it the message. But God does. He said,
[1:31:06] "But my reward doesn't come from
[1:31:08] peoples."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Well, give me some shout room in the
[1:31:14] house of God. My reward doesn't come
[1:31:17] from peoples. You know what Paul said?
[1:31:20] He said, "Be not deceived, for God is
[1:31:22] not mocked. For whatsoever a man seweth,
[1:31:25] that shall he also reap. For he that
[1:31:28] sweth to the flesh shall also reap of
[1:31:31] the flesh corruption, but he that sweth
[1:31:33] to the spirit shall reap of the spirit
[1:31:36] of the everlasting. And remember, my
[1:31:38] brothers and sisters, you will reap what
[1:31:41] you sow. That's God's law. That's God's
[1:31:44] law of nature. Now, you say, "Well,
[1:31:46] can't we backslide?" Absolutely.
[1:31:48] Hebrews. Can't we backslide? Absolutely.
[1:31:50] And when you backslide, you're going to
[1:31:52] get it. Don't you worry. Abraham got it.
[1:31:55] And the rest of them got it and you'll
[1:31:57] get it. Don't you think it you get Don't
[1:32:00] you think it gives you a right to sin?
[1:32:02] It doesn't.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. We might as well preach.
[1:32:06] We're this close to it. Amen. Why are we
[1:32:08] letting up now this close to the
[1:32:10] rapture? Amen. It don't give you a
[1:32:12] righteous sin. You'll pay for everything
[1:32:14] you do. You will reap what you sow.
[1:32:19] Well, come on. You do one little sin and
[1:32:22] you'll reap a whole wash tub full.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I know a lot of good legalistic
[1:32:30] preachers.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And right now, bless God, Brother Ben,
[1:32:34] they they'd hunker down in that
[1:32:35] microphone
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; and they'd get on that. Glory to God.
[1:32:38] Hallelujah. I'm going to tell you right
[1:32:39] now, you're going to hell.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Well, read the rest of the quote,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; brother. You'll reap what you sow a wash
[1:32:48] was washed up full. But that don't mean
[1:32:50] to say you're lost.
[1:32:52] [Applause]
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. How can you be lost when you've
[1:32:56] already heard from your theophony?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; How can you be lost when the faith of
[1:33:01] God has anchored itself to you? How can
[1:33:04] you be lost when God has allowed the
[1:33:06] word to impart a revelation in your soul
[1:33:09] that you got a seat at the marriage
[1:33:12] supper of the lamb and nobody can take
[1:33:14] your place? You say, "Well, that's just
[1:33:16] giving us a right to sin." Amen. I'm
[1:33:18] going to tell you, and I'm going to say
[1:33:19] it very plainly, and I'm going to say it
[1:33:21] very straight. A predestinated seed
[1:33:24] requires a predestinated life.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; We always use that in the negative.
[1:33:33] Well, bless God, they're sowing and
[1:33:34] they're going to reap. Why don't we turn
[1:33:36] it to the positive?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; If there's a people that can sow bad and
[1:33:40] reap bad, don't you think there's a
[1:33:41] people can sow good and reap good?
[1:33:44] Don't you think what the Bible says when
[1:33:46] it said, "Let us not be weary and
[1:33:48] welloing, for in due season we shall
[1:33:50] reap if we faint not."
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You know what brother said? He said,
[1:33:53] "That's been my attitude all along. And
[1:33:55] I want to go out of this world with the
[1:33:56] same attitude, knowing that someday I
[1:33:58] shall receive a reward if I can only be
[1:34:01] faithful until that time when the
[1:34:03] rewards are given." He said, "The reward
[1:34:06] of the just
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; waits for each believer."
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love what a prophet says in
[1:34:13] Hebrews or in the fifth seal 1963
[1:34:15] paragraph 471.
[1:34:18] Are y'all ready for this?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; How many's ever had to take a stand?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; You ever had to make a stand?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet said? He said,
[1:34:29] "And the God of heaven rewards you
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; for your stand."
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; For him.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All things,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon clearly and emphatically
[1:34:38] establishes that God rewards faith.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And faith is a revelation. Now, you all
[1:34:45] know him in the message in Genesis 4.
[1:34:47] Abel and Cain come to the altar to
[1:34:49] worship.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, Brother Brandon breaks it
[1:34:51] down beautifully. He says, Cain comes up
[1:34:53] there and he lays out everything just
[1:34:55] right. And he looks at God and he says,
[1:34:56] "Can I find favor with you?"
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Brother said he wasn't an infidel.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; He was a fundamental believer. Come on,
[1:35:03] brother.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "But God through election."
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Called Abel and had a recompense to that
[1:35:09] reward.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now Abel had foresight." Isn't
[1:35:12] that powerful?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Can I Can I Can I just let
[1:35:16] you in on a little secret? Sometimes
[1:35:17] Sometimes it's real easy to get critical
[1:35:19] against somebody.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; But you don't realize they're elected by
[1:35:23] God and they have foresight.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about, right?
[1:35:29] And then it's like brother said here he
[1:35:31] said he was born to Adam which was the
[1:35:33] son of God. He said and the church today
[1:35:35] that's born of Christ the son of God has
[1:35:38] the foresight and the recompense to the
[1:35:40] reward that's going to come.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; So that's why they're not looking at
[1:35:44] what is.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; They're looking at what will be.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, they don't care what the world
[1:35:50] says.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; brother Noah. They don't care how
[1:35:52] old-fashioned they're called, how much
[1:35:54] this that or the other. We know what God
[1:35:56] said.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what we're
[1:35:59] looking to, brother Peter. I love what a
[1:36:01] prophet said. We don't look at the
[1:36:02] things that go on so much temporarily
[1:36:04] now.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; But we look to the end of the road
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; where the rewards are given.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Now, God rewards faith.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Can I can I say this to you tonight? And
[1:36:17] God's attitude is eternal.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; It never changes.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Paul said this, "Sin were compassed
[1:36:24] about with such a great cloud of
[1:36:25] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[1:36:26] weight." and the sin that disease and
[1:36:28] beset us. Let us run with race the
[1:36:30] patience with the let us run with
[1:36:33] patience the race
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; that's set before us look into the
[1:36:36] author finish of our faith the Lord
[1:36:38] Jesus Christ. Now Abraham says if we see
[1:36:41] what God did back there to those people
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; upon certain attitudes they taken
[1:36:45] towards God and then if we find out if
[1:36:47] we'll take the same attitude they did
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; we will receive the same reward that
[1:36:53] they did.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So your attitude is connected to
[1:36:58] your reward.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You can just expect because God never
[1:37:03] changes. His blessings is the same and
[1:37:06] his penalties is the same. See then
[1:37:08] there's a recompense of reward for
[1:37:10] obedience and there's a recompense of
[1:37:13] reward for disobedience. Now, now you
[1:37:15] all remember there in in 1955 Reb gives
[1:37:18] his life story there in Zurich,
[1:37:19] Switzerland. And he says, "I put down
[1:37:21] all the invitations that night among the
[1:37:23] Pentecostals for the first time." And he
[1:37:24] said, "I went home." And Amen. Now, now,
[1:37:26] can I preach to you for a second? Is
[1:37:28] that is that I got 56 seconds. Is that
[1:37:30] okay?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; I went home and I said, "I found the
[1:37:34] baptism of the Holy Spirit." And I said,
[1:37:35] "Oh my." I said, "Honey, I've got all
[1:37:37] these invitations. We're going into the
[1:37:39] evangelistic work." and she went to tell
[1:37:41] her parents and her mother was a refined
[1:37:42] type of woman, belonged to a great big
[1:37:44] church. And she said, "Now, Billy, them
[1:37:46] people are nothing but trash. There's
[1:37:48] nothing to them. You stay away from
[1:37:50] them. I don't want my girl around them."
[1:37:53] I said, "Oh, but they were real." And
[1:37:55] she said, "No, no." And I said, "But I
[1:37:58] believe they are."
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Now, my wife started crying. Now,
[1:38:02] listen. And there's where I made my
[1:38:04] fatal mistake.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:38:09] He went against what he believed.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:38:15] Now you say, "Preacher, surely you're
[1:38:18] talking about somebody besides Brother
[1:38:19] Brandham." No, I'm talking about Brother
[1:38:20] Brandham.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And And this is
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; brother Brother Danny. This is one of
[1:38:25] them hard quotes for them daddy folks to
[1:38:27] swallow.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I listened to my mother-in-law.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Instead of God.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. and forsaken the church and
[1:38:37] went on back with the Baptist people.
[1:38:39] And right away plagues hit my home. My
[1:38:42] wife took sick. My father died on my
[1:38:43] arm. My brother was killed. Everything
[1:38:45] happened just a few days a foot hit this
[1:38:47] country. Washed away the homes. My wife
[1:38:50] was in the hospital. I was on a rescue
[1:38:52] boat one night out in the water. My boat
[1:38:53] got in the current was going over a big
[1:38:55] falls. I couldn't get the motor started.
[1:38:57] But I raised up my hands.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Oh, God, don't let me
[1:39:01] drown. I'm not worthy to live. but think
[1:39:04] of my wife and baby. Listen, and I tried
[1:39:06] again and it wouldn't start. And I cried
[1:39:10] again to God. Listen, you're going to
[1:39:11] reap what you sow.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; He was reaping the benefits of listening
[1:39:17] to his mother-in-law, but he wasn't
[1:39:19] lost. Oh, God.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I tried again, and just
[1:39:23] before going over the falls, the motor
[1:39:26] started and I got to land." Are you
[1:39:29] hearing me? See, just because you make a
[1:39:32] mistake, just because you fall, don't
[1:39:35] give up.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. Just because you're reaping
[1:39:38] something you sold, don't throw away.
[1:39:41] Amen. God is faithful to his word.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I want to I want to
[1:39:47] close on this right here. I'm having to
[1:39:48] skip over a lot, but a prophet stands
[1:39:50] there and he says, "The Holy Spirit is
[1:39:52] here and will reward you if you will
[1:39:54] believe." He said, "Now, without a
[1:39:55] shadow of a doubt in my mind, I can
[1:39:57] prove infallibly if you'll believe me
[1:39:59] that sickness will leave you now, God
[1:40:02] will reward your faith." Amen. Can I Can
[1:40:04] I bring it right down to you and just
[1:40:06] say this? The unseen Christ.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Is standing among us here now.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And he's here to reward your faith.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Listen, I I I I just
[1:40:19] got to studying the other day and I know
[1:40:22] I know over the last little bit you all
[1:40:23] are not ignorant. It's been a big a big
[1:40:26] argument. Should we shout? Should we
[1:40:27] not? Should we dance? Should we not
[1:40:29] speak in tongues? Should we not? Should
[1:40:30] we? But but let's just go back to what a
[1:40:32] prophet said.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "People say, "Well, unless I
[1:40:35] receive the Holy Ghost and speak in
[1:40:36] tonesues, I don't have it." He said, "No
[1:40:38] matter how much you speak in tonesues
[1:40:39] and deny this word, you're wrong
[1:40:41] anyhow."
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; See, you don't go in by speaking in
[1:40:44] tonesues.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. You go in by keeping every
[1:40:47] word.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; That's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:51] when you believe the word of God.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "I believe in speaking in
[1:40:56] tongues. I believe you can be quick and
[1:40:58] like I said this morning, do you speak
[1:40:59] with a new tongue? I have myself. I know
[1:41:01] it's the truth. I know it's true.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; But that's not the sign that you're
[1:41:05] God's selected child."
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Many will come to me and say, "Lord, and
[1:41:09] then I prophesied and done all these
[1:41:10] great things your name." And he'll say,
[1:41:12] "Depart from me." That's right. You
[1:41:14] worker of iniquity, I never knew you.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Now listen. You speak with tongues and
[1:41:20] then refuse to be baptized in the name
[1:41:22] of Jesus Christ. Something wrong
[1:41:24] somewhere.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just bring it right on down
[1:41:29] to the message.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; See? Yes, indeed. In those things, the
[1:41:33] orders that God gives, there's something
[1:41:35] wrong. Now, just search your own
[1:41:36] conscience and see what the Bible said.
[1:41:38] Show me some place where somebody was
[1:41:40] baptized in the name of Father, Son,
[1:41:42] Holy Ghost. See, it's not there. But you
[1:41:44] see, sometimes for your conscience sake,
[1:41:47] you say, "Well,"
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; now,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Now, here I got to say what what he
[1:41:52] said.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; You say God speaks to the women about
[1:41:55] how they must do and not wear shorts and
[1:41:57] things. But you know the pastor said,
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; uh,
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? He said,
[1:42:03] "So they take the easy way."
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Now, can I leave you by saying this?
[1:42:10] There's no reward coming to those that
[1:42:12] take the easy way.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; When the pastor says something different
[1:42:19] than the word,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; That's the easy way.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; And when you take the easy way,
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You can forget the reward of the word.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm out of time, but I'll set the way to
[1:42:33] the prophet said. He said, "I was over
[1:42:34] in in the other day preaching and he
[1:42:36] said, "I was preaching trying to
[1:42:37] separate denominationalism from real
[1:42:39] Christianity." And he said, "A man was
[1:42:41] giving me kind of a short talk from a
[1:42:43] famous Pentecostal church. His name was
[1:42:44] Danny Henry. He's a movie star's cousin
[1:42:46] there." And he said, he said, "Brother
[1:42:48] Bra, I hope this don't sound
[1:42:49] sacrilegious, but that could be the 23rd
[1:42:50] chapter of Revelation." And when he
[1:42:52] started to say something else, he
[1:42:53] started speaking in tongues.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Now, three people wrote it down. Now,
[1:42:57] all three notes was the same. And it
[1:43:00] said this, "Because thou has chosen this
[1:43:03] harder way."
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You've chose it.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; You have took chose it by your own
[1:43:09] choosing. Of course, we know that was
[1:43:11] Moses had to take his choice. This is
[1:43:13] the precise and the correct way
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; because it's my way.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And what a glorious decision you've
[1:43:21] made.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Now, because of this, a large portion of
[1:43:26] heaven
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; awaits you. Hallelujah.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; And this in itself is that which will
[1:43:32] make and bring to pass
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; the tremendous victory.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; In the love divine.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you tonight? God will reward
[1:43:42] you.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Because of your stand.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; And the confidence you've taken.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, what are you getting
[1:43:49] at?" I'll tell you this. How many knows
[1:43:50] Ruth had to make a decision?
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; How many knows Ruth had to serve?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many knows Ruth's coming
[1:43:58] to rest after her decision and serving?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And I love what a prophet says. He said,
[1:44:03] "And Ruth, after resting from her
[1:44:05] serving under her decision,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Ruth was rewarded."
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; When Ruth was deciding, she knew there
[1:44:14] was a reward coming.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; There was a reward coming to that
[1:44:17] decision.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; When she was serving, she knew there was
[1:44:21] a reward coming to that service.
[1:44:23] when she was resting, she knew there was
[1:44:25] a reward coming to that rest.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said this,
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; he said, "And Ruth was rewarded by
[1:44:31] getting Boaz."
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The church is rewarded by
[1:44:35] when the coming of the Lord shall come
[1:44:37] on that bright and cloudless morning."
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, we're resting now.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; We're waiting now. But it shall come why
[1:44:46] it's redeemed."
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; As the musicians are coming tonight, I
[1:44:51] want to tell you, hold fast your
[1:44:53] confidence.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming to it.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jes.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, it's awful hot and
[1:45:01] heavy in the battle right now, but
[1:45:03] there's a reward coming."
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, heard Abraham said today, I was
[1:45:10] riding down the road. He said, "There's
[1:45:11] nothing you do for God that he don't see
[1:45:13] what you do."
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every little thing you do,
[1:45:16] remember there's a reward." Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; See, somewhere or another, you got to
[1:45:21] get your eyes off of people.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; You got to quit looking for people to
[1:45:26] pat you on the back and
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; agree with you and support you and
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; sometimes they're not going to.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, remember brother talk about that
[1:45:34] that John Ryan, he said he got his
[1:45:36] healing and he went out testifying.
[1:45:38] Church people was his big biggest
[1:45:40] critics.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Talking about I'm I can see extra extra
[1:45:44] my eyes are healed. stumbling around and
[1:45:46] bumping into walls and tripping over
[1:45:48] things.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost had come into his
[1:45:51] heart.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And Sister Karine, the Holy Ghost had
[1:45:55] instilled confidence in him.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I'm your healer.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say this to you.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming to our young
[1:46:04] people.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That take a stand for this word.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I want I want to just say it very
[1:46:10] plainly and very openly. Amen. And
[1:46:12] there's a reward coming to our young
[1:46:13] ladies
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; that bear the reproach every day of the
[1:46:17] world.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; There's a reward coming.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; There ain't no reward coming to this mix
[1:46:22] in Hollywood fashion and gospel fashion.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; But there's a reward coming to that that
[1:46:26] life that'll consecrate itself.

[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; But you got to hold fast your
[1:46:39] confidence.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir. Somebody said, "Brother
[1:46:42] Andrew, I don't know. I don't know if
[1:46:44] God remembers what I done, one of my one
[1:46:46] of my favorite testimonies." I heard one

[1:47:14] see you got this condition and you got
[1:47:16] this problem in this situation." He
[1:47:18] said, "Oh, but I also see something
[1:47:19] else." He said, he said, "Oh," he said,
[1:47:21] "I see one time there was a little girl
[1:47:23] wanted to go to church." And he said,
[1:47:25] "That little girl didn't have a dress."
[1:47:28] And he said, "And that little girl
[1:47:29] wanted to go to church so bad that she
[1:47:31] didn't have a dress." And he said, "Oh,
[1:47:32] I see. You took time out of your
[1:47:34] schedule and you sold that little girl
[1:47:36] the dress." so she could go to church.

[1:48:32] stand.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of y'all are sitting right
[1:48:35] here tonight in the fruit of reward of a
[1:48:37] stand you took for God.
[1:48:40] Amen. I believe it tonight. I want you
[1:48:41] to stand up on your feet with us this
[1:48:43] evening.
[1:48:44] Amen. I pray something's been said to
[1:48:46] bless you.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; To help you tonight. I I pray the Holy
[1:48:49] Ghost has come by your heart and
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; you felt that little tug.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; You felt that little tug of faith.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That little anchor,
[1:48:58] that pull of faith.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; I remember your stand.
[1:49:03] I remember what you done. I remember the
[1:49:05] confession. I remember the word. I
[1:49:08] remember where it was you made that
[1:49:09] stand. And and I want tonight you just
[1:49:11] say, "Lord, fill my heart."
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:49:15] revelation.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, would you would you just come by
[1:49:18] my heart tonight and just just fill it
[1:49:21] with that perfect revelation of your
[1:49:22] love of who you are and how much you
[1:49:25] love me.
[1:49:27] or the devil. May maybe you're here
[1:49:28] tonight and the devil's doing everything
[1:49:30] he can to try to knock that confidence
[1:49:32] out of you. Amen. God bless you, little
[1:49:34] buddy. He's trying everything he can to
[1:49:36] knock your confidence out. He's trying
[1:49:39] to drain the confidence of God right out
[1:49:40] of your heart.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; But you say tonight, Lord, instill it in
[1:49:43] me.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, instill it in me.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe you say, "Preacher, how in
[1:49:49] the world is this confidence coming?
[1:49:50] service after service, tape after tape,
[1:49:54] word after word, line upon line, here a
[1:49:56] little, there a little, precept upon
[1:49:58] precept, and just gradually but firmly
[1:50:00] establishing and instilling in your
[1:50:02] heart a word attitude.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I raise my hands tonight. I say,
[1:50:06] Lord, instill it in me, Lord.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, fill me with that confidence,
[1:50:11] Lord.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything shake it from me,
[1:50:13] Lord. Almighty God, we bow our hearts in
[1:50:16] your presence tonight, Lord. Father,
[1:50:19] we've stood here behind this sacred desk
[1:50:21] once again, Lord. And Lord, endeavor to
[1:50:24] declare unto your children the goodness
[1:50:25] of your grace and mercy. And Father, I
[1:50:28] know there's a group of people standing
[1:50:30] before me here tonight that's in a great
[1:50:31] battle. Lord, the devil is doing
[1:50:34] everything he can to beset the
[1:50:35] believers. But Lord, we stand up on the
[1:50:38] confession of faith tonight that Lord,
[1:50:41] your word is true. And Lord, in the face
[1:50:44] of every unbelieving spirit, your word
[1:50:46] will prevail. Now Lord, as we stand here
[1:50:48] tonight, we stand here believing that
[1:50:50] you're the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:50:52] Jacob.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, we stand here believing that
[1:50:55] you're the God that was. Lord, we
[1:50:58] believe that you're the God that shall
[1:50:59] be. But Lord, we're standing here
[1:51:01] tonight upon a present day revelation.
[1:51:04] You're the God that is.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe that you exist, Lord.
[1:51:09] Father, we believe that you're existing
[1:51:11] in every one of our situations.
[1:51:13] We believe that you're controlling every
[1:51:15] one of our lives, Lord.
[1:51:17] Now, Father, if there would be one here
[1:51:20] tonight that's lost their confidence, I
[1:51:22] pray that you would take the Holy Spirit
[1:51:24] tonight in their hearts
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; and you would refresh it, Lord. You
[1:51:28] would restore it, dear God.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Father, maybe one of them feeling a
[1:51:31] little weak in their stand.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm asking you tonight, dear
[1:51:35] God. Lord, may you shir up the stand of
[1:51:38] every believer here tonight. Father,
[1:51:41] maybe they're feeling a little weak in
[1:51:42] their faith, Lord. Lord, may you send a
[1:51:45] surge of strength into that heart
[1:51:47] tonight.
[1:51:49] Father, we're looking to you, Lord. In
[1:51:51] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:51:54] In Jesus name we pray.
[1:51:58] Oh, maybe you just raise your hands
[1:51:59] tonight and say, "Lord, while I'm in
[1:52:02] your presence, the Holy Ghost here, my
[1:52:05] glorified body right here in this
[1:52:06] tabernacle tonight, wanting to send a
[1:52:09] charge through me like a battery and
[1:52:10] give me new strength. Would you come by
[1:52:12] my heart, Lord?
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Would you come by my way right now,
[1:52:16] Lord? Would you touch me, Lord? You see
[1:52:18] this sickness? You see this condition?
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; You're the God that can make it well
[1:52:22] right now. You've already made it well.
[1:52:25] Now, Father, I'm asking you come by my
[1:52:27] way right now in the name of Jesus.
[1:52:30] In Jesus name. Let's sing it together
[1:52:32] tonight.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're crying.
[1:52:39] Saveior.
[1:52:40] [Music]
