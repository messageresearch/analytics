this Friday evening Lord father we've not gathered here for just another service or just another gathering together but Lord we've gathered here because there's a deep calling to the deep and Lord we know that when two or three gather together in your name something good always happens and Lord as we stand here tonight very humble to be in your presence and Lord humble to have this opportunity to stand Lord before this group of young people and Lord to open your word and to share things from what you've revealed in this generation now father I know the devil has done everything he can to destroy the faith of this generation father to bind them with chains of ungodliness and worldliness father Lord to get him distracted with the things of Le oosa but Lord we're so thankful tonight father to see such a group of young people standing here tonight as Overcomers in the middle of Satan's Eden Lord overcoming the go of this evil age and father I pray tonight Lord you would help us to

shortcomings Lord come by our way tonight and speak to our hearts and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen amen and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the book of St John The Book of St John the 6th chapter we want to look in the 66th verse of St John and then we're going to go to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 amen we do want to say it is an honor tonight to have brother Thomas cross here with us from over in North Carolina we was out there ministering this week and brother Thomas just jumped in and came out with us to be a part of these meetings and so we sure appreciate him coming and being here and amen I I do do appreciate these young men that are carrying this gospel the Lord just C recently called brother Thomas into the ministry and so we sure appreciate him and his stand for this word and the Book of St John the 6th chapter and in the 66th verse you love the Lord tonight amen St John chapter 6 and verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more then said Jesus unto the 12 will ye also go away and then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go now brother Ram took time to identify that Peter did not say where would we go he he said but to whom shall we go brother B said see it's not about a place it's about a person for thou Hast the words of eternal life so Peter identified that he was the one who had the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God now there was no hesitation or reservation in their Declaration of what they believed they were sure and they were confident that Jesus was the Christ and he was the son of the Living God now in in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 16 it's a very very familiar reading here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 16 amen Paul here writing he says now wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yay though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now him forth know we him no more now therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature now there is that not place but person therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold some things are become new a few things no Paul says all things are become new watch and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to him himself by Jesus Christ look and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation look at verse 19 to Wi that God was in Christ how many believes it all that was in God he poured into Christ to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them now watch and hath committed unto us the word somebody say the word the word of reconciliation so all that was in God he poured into Christ and according to Paul here all that was in Christ has been poured into the church or to the Believers who have the word of reconciliation now there now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I could amen tonight to share something here with you on my heart if I would title this tonight I want to talk to you for a few moments on ambassadors with a true word experience amen ambassadors with a true word experience you know I believe that we are following amen the greatest message that has ever hit the face of the Earth and I believe that the message of the hour has restored to us amen the fact that there is a true word experience to be had amen by every believer in the Church of the Living God I was just listening to a tape recently and the prophet of God was speaking a greater than Solomon is here I want you to hear this he said now before we approach the word he said let's approach the author how many knows uh William Booth curn he said oh he's an orator he preaches in seven different languages he said he's an English man he said he's a fine man real good man he can preach the Bible in Greek he can preach it in anything he wants to he said he preaches it in seven languages so one day he said he and I was in treport with Brother Moore and we were discussing something and he said now I had the opposite side of the argument he said and I said something or another about it to brother BR brother booth and he said but listen here young fellow now I want you to catch this listen here young fellow he said you just don't know your Bible so here brother bradam is a young man a young fellow and he looks at him and he says you just don't know your Bible he said now that may be true brother boo but I know the author real well amen he said now isn't that cute said Jack you have to love him anyhow he said I would rather know the author amen than know his book because he will reveal the book if we know the author do you realize you can carry the book and not know the author amen you can read from the book and not know the author you can memorize things from the book amen and not know the author but if you ever meet the author amen you have met the originator of the word that you're carrying and he has the power by the spirit to impart unto you amen more than just a religion but an experience from that word now when you begin to think about young people there's one that really stands out to me amen and that's a man named Daniel how many here knows Daniel the Bible says in Daniel chapter 1 verse 8 amen that Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile hisself with a portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not amen defile himself now we have to establish something here that Daniel Amen was a young man who was in Babylonian captivity and in the Book of Daniel chapter 9 and verse two the Bible said in the first year of his Reign I Daniel Amen understood by books the number of the years where of the word of the Lord came Amen to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish amen 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem Daniel said I set my face unto the Lord God Amen to seek by prayer and supplication amen with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes Ram comes along in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said now I want you to notice how Daniel yet an alien he was ousted from his people he was oued from his church he didn't have one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be saying amen but what he's saying himself in the midst of all of this amen still held on to what the prophet said amen now no church to go to nobody to fellowship with amen everybody went to Heathen temples amen and everybody worship their Idols now think about this young people Daniel Amen he never had a Friday night youth service amen he never had a youth camp amen nearly every other month amen he never had Youth fellowships and youth get togethers amen the prophet of God said no Christian songs nobody amen believe the same thing that he did amen and in 68 years now watch from a young man of about 12 or 14 years old amen he was taken down in there he said but he held true to God and understood by Jeremiah the prophet amen that the days were almost accomplished now when Jeremiah releases this message amen the only one that really called it was a young man who was named Daniel who believed what Jeremiah was saying amen concerning the future of Babylon let me say to you tonight young people amen we have not received another religion as as the message of the hour has come to us it has not come amen as a tradition or as a denomination amen but this message has come as instruction amen from almighty god listen now if God reveals something he's going to have somebody amen who will believe that message amen They will receive that message and they will manifest amen the promise of that message let me say Daniel a young man amen he lived in a day of critics the children of Israel had been taken from their Homeland they were down in Babylon amen they were sad and for some 70 years they had been down there but there was a young Prophet amen that went down there with him by the name of Daniel he said a handful of Brethren had got together and had vowed themselves to God they were not going to defile themselves amen with the Modern Trend of that day they wasn't going to fool with the king's meat they wasn't going to drink his strong drinks they wasn't going to attend his parties amen but they were going to keep themselves holy amen and dedicated to God Amen for thus it was becoming to them in other words it was becoming to Daniel Amen to stay with the word he said any true Prophet that knows the word of God Amen knows a true Prophet stays with the word he said Daniel knew that if he stayed with the word listen he knew what it was going to cost him listen Daniel didn't look at it and say oh my amen it's going to cost too much he said it was going to cost him his popularity it was going to cost him his Fellowship amen with the rest of the Brethren it was going to cost them a lot of things amen but they made an issue that they were going to pray to a certain God Amen then after they could go back and pray to any God Amen but you know something about Our God Amen is we don't compromise with God Amen there's no compromising with God Amen God just stays God he don't expect us on Sunday to be Christians amen praising him and worshiping him and on Monday wishy-washy and take it down and all kinds of faults that maybe I was wrong and ought to have done this or that amen we stay right centered Amen on God's word and we lay right to it I say God give us a young person amen that will take a hold of the message of the hour amen they won't be wishy-washy they won't just serve God Amen when they're with their friends they just won't serve God when they're at Youth Camp amen but they'll serve God on Monday and they'll serve God on Tuesday and they'll serve God on Friday amen because you have not been brought into this amen by Mommy's religion or Daddy's religion amen but God by a true word experience has birthed you into a word that has the power to defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any place under any condition listen Daniel wasn't ashamed amen of the word amen that he believed you say Daniel was different I say praise God Amen that in the middle of a of a of of can we just preach Amen in the middle of captivity there was a young man that God Amen could place his hand upon let me say Daniel was different than any other young man I believe in that age because God Amen had in invested in Daniel Amen a prophetic message amen I want to read a quote brother said Daniel was a prophet he said and the words of God Amen the Bible was invested to Daniel Amen to manifest to the people amen that God still lived when there was no church to go to when there were no songs to Be Sung when there were no youth camps to attend when there were no youth fellowships to go to amen there was a young man who had a heart and inside of that heart he had a soul and there had been a word deposited amen into that life amen to manifest to them heathens that there is a God Amen and he's not a god of wood and he's not a god of stone you say well that was Daniel I say what about you young man amen what about you young ladies amen the same God of Daniel is your god tonight and he by the message of the hour has invested his word into your soul to make a living declaration to this world my God is not dead he is a living God he can save a soul he can heal a body he can redeem a mind he can deliver a young person listen I think it's time Amen to remember we're not just ordinary Christians amen we're not just generic young people we are following a prophetic word that God has invested into our lives Daniel Amen he purposed in his heart that he would not defile amen his investment he said oh if the church amen could only do that today if the church could only purpose in your heart amen that you won't defile amen your investment with any type of the things amen that brings you into a system amen that will take you away from him listen Daniel purposed in his heart amen and what did it do amen it saved his life from the lines amen God got a hold of Daniel and Daniel purposed in his heart amen that he would not def himself amen with the things of Babylon but he would stand for Jehovah oh young people amen I want to say to you tonight amen how many will say God on this Friday night amen I want to pledge allegiance to the Lamb of God and say I will not defile myself with the modern trends of Lea come on I will not be a billboard for Hollywood I will not be a billboard for the god of sports I will not be a billboard amen for country music or rap music amen I have been called as a Daniel in this generation and God loved me enough that he invested his word into me my I know amen I know that's hard to comprehend amen I know that's a hard fault to wrap your mind around amen that God which is deity amen would invest in humanity amen if you're going to invest in something amen you want to invest in something amen that's going to give some good benefits or some good returns down the road oh Church of the Living God God Amen and when you are the highest of highs when you are God himself amen come on church that would be like that would be like Elon Musk who is a billionaire or whatever he is amen looking around and saying I think I'm going to go down here amen and invest in Dollar General come on church amen let me just let me break it down a little bit more simpler amen you take Elon Musk amen and take him downtown and find some bum Amen on the side of the road amen that's got a cardboard sign amen that says will work for food ain't never struck a lick at nothing amen and Elon says today I'm going to invest a million dollars in this man list said he's going to invest Amen in something that appears amen that's going to return benefits amen but my God Amen is not an Edwards and Jones Financial investor amen my God is not a stock market amen or trade world Amen investor but my God Amen chose the lowest of the lows amen and he invested come on Church he invested his blood into you he invested his word into you he invested his power into you listen I know when God put a seed in my soul amen it didn't look like much amen when God put a seed in your soul it didn't look like much amen but today amen God who is rich in Mercy is standing back and looking at the Devil and saying look at that young man and look at that young girl everything I invested in them amen is paying off in the hour that they're living in my goodness to think that God Amen which is deity would invest in us which is Humanity now when you think of this word invest it means to commit money in order to earn a financial return it means to make use of for future benefits or advantages it means to furnish with power or authority so when you invest in something you are Furnishing what you are investing in with your power and your Authority it means look to Grant someone control amen or authority over it means to endow with equality listen it means to cover completely do you realize the prophet of God Amen said that we are the elect of God and he said therefore being the elect of God he said in the elect of God Amen there is a fine quality amen there is a fine quality that has been given to the elect of God listen the election of God Amen has set you apart amen from the Modern Trend of Christianity the world is full of two types of Christianity remember said one of them amen is an intellectual conception he said but the other one is an experimental experience now I don't know about you amen but I don't believe in no intellectual conception amen but I believe in an experimental experience amen with not just the word amen but the author of the word amen I don't just want to carry the word amen I want to meet the author I want to know him Amen in the grace and the truth that he has been manifested in this age in B said the true word amen comes to the true Prophet amen and he tells you the true word he said if you follow that true word then you will get a true experience amen of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of God amen into you because you are of his nature amen his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God so if God invest in you he is investing his nature in you he is investing his authority in you he is investing his power in you listen just like he did Apostle Paul listen Paul knew amen that he had an experience Amen brother said here's a good lesson for us amen that experience alone isn't enough he said it's got to be amen an experience according Amen to the word of the Lord he said taking the Bible he said that's the true experience amen of every real believer who meets God Amen is you come in contact with something amen that it is so great that you become a prisoner to everything else see you get away from everything Amen to imprison yourself to this what are you imprisoning yourself to Amen to the word of God that has been invested in you amen by the god of Daniel let me say this I know it's an hour amen where there is a falling away brother said see there seems to be a falling away people not interested anymore he said they're falling away amen from the fundamental facts amen of the Bible he said they seem to be drifting let me just say this it's an hour amen when people amen they're just throwing in the towel amen young people amen just giving up they're growing weary amen and they're simply walking away and the question comes about amen how can someone do that well let me say this it's because they never had a true word experience if they ever had a true word experience it would have took them Beyond an intellectual conception into a baptism of the Holy Ghost and they would not be sealed until the next youth meeting they would not be sealed until the next Youth Camp but they would be seal healed until the day of their Redemption I say it's time Amen to open up the doors and let the sealing angel of God Amen come back in the church in the power and the authority of his seal upon the soul of an individual yes sir you say well I'm sitting in church well there's people amen sitting in church today without an experience remember said it's Such a Pity to see men women who have lived in the church they have been brought up in this crater role amen and they know the the Bible well but yet has never witnessed an experience with God he said what we need is to get back to the real heartfelt experience to know who you got faith in amen not some writings amen but the true and living God who lives now I make this statement without any reservation there is nothing young people that will take the place amen of a Bible word experience with God in your soul education will never do it denomination will never do it there will never be an organization ever substitute amen The Upper Room experience there'll never be a school that'll ever take the place of Pentecost because it can't amen not by power not by might but by my spirit sayth the Lord he said that's what we need today amen is back to the Bible experience amen Christians that are born again they are washed in the blood of the Lamb amen they are made white and they are regenerated and they have been Christ born I say oh God Amen on this Friday night amen from the oldest to the youngest amen from the puppet to the back door from the right to the left amen may God come down in our midst tonight and may He begin to search out every heart may he begin to search out every life and may He begin to see if there's a word experience on the inside of that Soul yes sir I think of what David said David said search me oh God and know my heart he said try me amen and know my thoughts how many said Lord come in this meeting tonight and search my heart amen search my life amen know my thoughts said if listen he said if the thing is up to you to receive it or to reject it he said listen it does not relay or it does not lay within whether your church accepts it it's whether you accept it see salvation is a personal work it's a personal faith it's not a universal church Faith it's a personal faith in the Lord Jesus listen I'm going to say what a prophet said he said no matter if father don't believe and mother don't believe it's what you believe come on this goes beyond what your mama believes and what your daddy believes listen it don't matter if they believe this message or not if God chose you from before the foundation of the world he put a seed in your soul listen there ain't enough devils in Hell Amen to back off a Son of God on their way to me a promise of God Hallelujah well listen it don't matter how they receive it or not he said oh people this day can't you see amen the gospel of Christ has been rejected he said I think that if that be the case that each one of us should take inventory of our own experience of our own standings with God look here and see how we stand in his sight now that really brings the rubber down to the road amen that we find out where we stand amen not in our preacher side or in our Sunday school teacher side amen or in our youth leader side or even in our Mom and Daddy's side amen but how do we stand in the sight of God in Romans chapter 3 and: 20 Paul says therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall be no flesh amen be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin in Colossians 121 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked works amen yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight I love Hebrews 13:21 he said that God would make you perfect in every good work to do his will amen working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight amen through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen in 1 John chapter 3 and: 22 he says whatsoever we ask amen we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight let me just ask you this amen is what you're wearing pleasing in his sight is the music you're listening to amen is it pleasing in his side amen is the places you're going and the relationships that you're building amen are they pleasing in his sight I don't care about the Modern Trend I don't care about Leota I don't care about the boys club or the Girls Club I care about the house of God and I think it's time we let the Holy Ghost amen come into the doors of our heart amen and search out amen the door of Pride search out the door of Faith search out the door of side oh God come into my heart tonight I don't want to leave here in good side of my daddy or mama or my preacher and being in bad side of you Lord I want to be in God's good sides I want the blessings of God Amen to cover my lie yes sir you say well it's it's time it is time brother said it's matching time he said you know that's true it's a matching time he said I'm going to tell you my brother I don't care whether my shoes match my trousers come on or my trousers match my coat come on I want my experience to match God's Bible That's the matching time if you want to match something amen then match your experience against Paul's amen that's what we need today is a matching time with Paul's faith in the Bible that's right that's our example amen don't try to match your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible if you're a saint act like a saint amen walk like a saint dress like a saint amen talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint shout like a saint be like a saint live like a saint and die like a saint and go go to heaven like a saint you say well that's a lot of saints well I'm preaching to some saints tonight and I think it's time to remember whose side are we standing in it's pleasing unto God now when you think of this word experience I I think it's a very powerful definition it is a practical contact amen with an observation of facts or events listen it is an event somebody say an event it is an event or An Occurrence amen that leaves an impression on someone it means to encounter or to undergo amen an event or An Occurrence it means to feel an emotion in other words an experience happens amen when contact is made now our Jeremiah or our prophet of this day has come in this age and he said these words he said now we're going to read some of God's word tonight and we're going to be ready for this event of his presence again Amen to bring us his word listen the presence of God Amen was coming to the Church of God Amen to bring a change in the life of the members of that church he said when we come into His presence when a man once comes into the presence of God he is changed forever if there's any change to him now there are those who could walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it he wasn't ordained to life but if he was predestinated to God as soon as that first move hits amen he know knows it and that catches fire listen I'll say this when we come into His presence we are changed amen never to be the same look all down to the ages of every Walk of Life at man amen look at Abraham you say well amen the changed life help me somebody say the changed life the changed life said will you say brother brandom the change life is just for the minister he said oh no the change life is for everybody now let me say this the power of change amen is a believer in contact with his maker said one of the doctors said I tell you the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb amen but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habits it changes his body it changes his nature amen it changes everything when a man comes in contact with God Amen the presence of God bringing his word to the church changes the heart it changes the mental it changes the attitude I know people say serving God is difficult amen but I say a true experience of the word of God in the presence of God Amen will make serving God Amen the easiest thing you ever did in your life our personal experience comes in your heart and said what does it do he said it burns all the dullness out and it gives you a new vision listen in Matthew 13:15 the Bible said this for the people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed listen their heart is wax gross their eyes or rather their ears are dull of hearing yeah this getting pretty bad shape their eyes have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes they should hear with their ears and should understand their heart yeah with their heart look and should be converted and I should heal them so brother B said what is it it's a true experience that produces a conversion he said see it's got to be a change here it is a change of heart not of this physical thing but the heart of your soul in something anchors to your thoughts the way is though you don't see that no more amen you just see the Lord Jesus you see righteousness and Holiness and Purity and love and grace that's when you have been changed listen what is a convert amen a convert means to change something over and your thoughts and your habits and your being has been changed amen from a sinner to a Christian are y'all ready for this amen the first thing you know it's in your heart he said then you express it with your lips amen and then it materializes when there's a change in the heart there will be a change in the mouth and there will be a change of the atmosphere that is materializing around you listen anything I can say to you tonight amen that is absolutely essential it is necessary it is compelling and compulsory amen that you receive the Holy Ghost In Your Heart amen that there would be a change in your mouth there would be a change in your walk there would be a change in your talk listen I say oh God fill our young people with the Holy Ghost in fire until it changes them from the top of their head yes sir to the soul of their feet now you say preacher you're getting out there I'm preaching about an experience amen and an ambassador that has one because an experience with God Amen is not it it it it is and not was essential now let me say this brother ra ask a question do your children have to have an experience to have the Holy Spirit now can I read the rest of the question if they see the end time message do they have the Holy Spirit he said everyone must have an experience your children cannot go in another way but the same way you do see they've got to be born again there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of God they're all children see they must have it they must have an experience with God Amen to go in amen just the same as you now come on I'm going preach to the the elders for a minute amen because your young people have got to have what you got come on church amen and I remember the atmosphere that was created the night I got it amen there wasn't a bunch of people sitting around amen wondering how long the preacher was going to preach amen if it was going to be too loud or too quiet amen but they were believing God in the power of His word come on church amen praise God somebody amen create an atmosphere phere amen for Ben pu to get the Holy Ghost amen somebody somewhere amen created an atmosphere amen for Joel to get the Holy Ghost amen but now there's another generation that is in the front lines of the greatest battle that has ever been fought I say from the back door to the front Pew amen God help us tonight amen God help us in our services God help us in our home churches God help us in our houses Amen to create an atmosphere that is conducive for the holy H ghost of God to come into that room and to change our lives from the inside out I'm talking about a conversion where the old becomes new and the old things are passed away sir Hallelujah I'm talking about an atmosphere where God can come in and can change the lives of our young people listen because God is calling these young people to be more than just sitters on the Pew well I'm just going to take the gloves off and preach he's calling you to be more than just the next church or or the Church of Tomorrow listen I don't believe I'm preaching to the Church of tomorrow you know why brother Danny cuz we're not promised tomorrow we're not promised tomorrow we're not even promised next week but we are promised right now come on and the prophet of God said God has called you to be Witnesses in this age that you're living in God has never been without a witness somebody is going to witness for God somewhere somebody on right somebody is going to witness for God somewhere you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be my Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth look at this word Witnesses it is those who after his example have proved the strength and the genuiness of their faith in Christ amen by undergoing a violent death now I know what you're thinking you're thinking brother Andrew you saying I got to die to be a spiritual witness no the prophet of God said amen that the new birth is a death he said but you know before you can be born amen you have to die listen and some people they die awful hard he said they kick and they ball and they scream and they carry on Amen but unless the wheat of corn falls in the ground and dies it abides alone if you want to bring forth fruit amen then die to yourself and your own manmade Theology and be born again of the spirit and the resurrection that's right listen get rid of that old Spirit of selfishness well we might as well preach get rid of that old Spirit of selfishness he said and that dryness that's in you and take on New Life get rid of that old selfishness and that old dryness amen and take on some new life now I might as well just preach amen CU I don't think a word experience amen does away amen with some flexibility of the Holy Ghost I think our young people shouldn't have to sit around and hear stories of 50 years ago and 40 years ago and 20 years ago of how the Holy Ghost fail and how the Holy Ghost done things I think we ought to build a campfire in the house of God and kick out the spirit of dryness kick out the spirit of selfishness and bring in some flexibility of the Holy Ghost I say let them shout until they enjoy the blessings of God let them Rejoice until they know there's a God who has saved their soul who has delivered their mind and who has sealed them until the day of their Redemption yes sir somebody shout hallelujah somebody shout glory to God somebody shout thank you Jesus and then get rid of that old dryness and [Applause] selfishness I'll just say this thank God was nobody looking at the clock the night you needed to get saved come on come on and thank God nobody was wondering how many notes the preacher had the not you needed a break through come on somebody listen be sure in your heart that God has separated you from the things of the world and made you a new creature listen I don't just want to know brother Joe that he separated my feet I don't just want to know that he separated my hands I want to know that he separated my heart brother Harvey I want to know that he's changed my heart he's changed my soul Hallelujah he said then go tell the people you're a Christian he said a man that's dead in Christ you can't offer him a drink you can give him this out the other but he's dead and he's hid in Christ through God and he's sealed by the Holy Spirit now then he cannot do those things because he just can't do it it's against his nature see he becomes a new creature let me just say this to you you don't just wake up one morning and decide to be a witness right you don't just wake up one morning and decide to be an ambassador all right you don't just wake up one morning and when you've tried everything else you say well you know what today I think I'm just going to go be an ambassador no you've got to be selected to be an ambassador in other words if you're going to be a Ambassador or a witness for the Lord you got to know something now come on Church you got to know something you know what Daniel said he said is such as do wickedly against the Covenant Daniel 11:32 as such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries listen but the people that do know their God shall be weak and barely making it and can't praise God and can't worship no my Bible said the people that do know their God they shall be strong and they shall do exploits look at this word know it means to know by experience it means to be acquainted with remember so when a man's really born again the spirit of God he becomes acquainted and a person personality of God is in him he said get a cleaning with God what was it amen it was spiritual Revelation that he would build his church upon listen it's after you become acquainted with God that you could take his word for anything let me just say this Satan has done everything he can Amen to hinder people from becoming acquainted with god he has tried prophecies he has tried seminaries he has tried theology amen he's tried everything he can Amen to take Daniel 11:32 out of the Bible all right now come on church amen if you were the devil and you had read the back of the book and you know there was a people who was going to know their God and by knowing their God they were going to be strong and they were going to do great exploits and the Bible said they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb their God and the word of their testimony If I Was the Devil I would do everything I could Amen to make sure that Daniel 11:32 never become more than a scripture it never become more than just a quote but it become a reality but I say tonight the devil don't have enough Amen to stop Daniel 11:32 from taking on flesh he don't have enough he don't have enough to stop amen this scripture from taking on flesh in your flesh I say there is a young people who's going to know their God and they're going to be strong sir they're going to be strong and they're going to do great exploits what are you saying I'm saying there's a people who's going to know their God Beyond just an intellectual conception job 42:5 says I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear amen but now mine eye see a the brother said see therefore no no man exactly can witness to the resurrection of Christ amen only by the Holy Spirit I love this he said sometime or another you're going to have to show what you're made out of because the devil is going to call your hand every man that professes to be a Christian remember talks about Tommy Osborne he said he was a man in brother B's meetings and he said he saw that how many ever heard brother B tell about the maniac that came and fell across his feet he said that Maniac came he said he fell across my feet remember that if you're familiar raise your hand if not I'll tell it okay he said like this he said he come up there and brother said roll him off my feet he said I'll break every bone in your body right he said okay he said all right he said I'll follow he said said but the Lord spoke and said you'll fall over my feet right said I stood there he said he come and he drew his fist back and he said when he drew his fist back he said he fell and fell across my feet exactly as the word said he would do brother said very beautiful he said the police officer come up there and he said uh sir he said would you mind to get him off my feet brother BR want to go and preach the gospel you know he said would you mind to get him off my feet and the police officer looks at brother brandom and says brother brandom is he delivered he said no he worships that spirit so brother Tommy Osburn saw that and he said brother Brandon he said what can I do to see things like like this I said now Tommy don't profess anything that you cannot back up are you with me I'm turning the corner do not profess anything that you cannot back up the devil is going to call your hand on it yes he will he will do it right away I said then if you can't back it up you know what's a coming it will be a reproach he said so be sure that you are right before you make your statement I say this today church and I I I want to turn a corner and say this if you're going to be an ambassador how many believes God's called you to be one four of you how many believes God has called you to be an ambassador you say I'm too young God didn't ask how old you were you say well I'm too little God didn't ask how big you were he called you to be an ambassador listen to me tonight friends and if God called you then God will position place you and God will cause his word amen to revolve out of you and whatever you say amen God will back up amen can I just say something to you young people don't you ever be scared of the devil don't you ever be scared of Satan or lay out of sea don't you ever be scared you know who you are you know who you believed in you know who saved your soul and you know you are an ambassador of Jesus Christ now what are you saying I'm saying an ambassador is the highest ranking person who represents his or her own government now listen in the economy of God it is while living in another country my goodness so what is an ambassador he is they are an authorized representative or messenger now do you know if you actually start studying about ambassadors that there's actually 12 different characteristics of an ambassador actually I I'm I'm I wish I had time on every one of them but I don't but they're very astounding because the first one is that this Ambassador is appointed by the King come on he don't just wake up and walk in the living room and mama say buddy you got some big muscles you could be an ambassador but he is appointed by the king listen to this amen now listen he is not voted into position that's right oh God if he's voted in then somebody can vote him out but if he is appointed they are put there by the king look at this second one they are appointed Amen to represent the state or the kingdom I love this third one they are committed only to the interest of that country I love this one they embody the state the nation or the kingdom now are y'all hearing me and ambassador okay so if you have an ambassador from America amen that goes over to China or goes over to Africa or goes over to Germany or Russia or anywhere else they go over there now listen when they go there amen they're not there representing them own selves they are there representing the country and the leadership that sent them and when they go they're actually embodying the country or the state or the nation or the kingdom in their own body look what the pro of God says he said now he embodies himself and he takes your body and he takes my body and he gives you gifts he gives me gifts and through them gifts He makes himself known listen when Daniel went down to Babylon he was not there representing the Babylonian captivity but God by Jeremiah's message had so embodied himself into Daniel that when Daniel went down there he could not drink the King's Wine he could not eat the king's meat because he had been invested by God to be an ambassador what are you saying I'm saying deity will be tabernacled in men are you hearing me the god of Heaven who has put you in Leona as his Ambassador will embody you by the power of the Holy Ghost listen when God invested in you he covered you he completely covered you he give you his power he give you his authority he give you his word and he said speak my word yes sir and I will back it up now listen what this is It's deity tabernacled in man I love this one an ambassador is totally covered by the state by the state I like this one they are the responsibility of the state yes they are totally protected by the government oh God if an ambassador from America goes to China they are totally covered sir by the protection of the country they're representing what are you saying in other words I'm saying when they go into that country if they get in trouble if they get in trouble in that country there is a kingdom oh God there is a kingdom that is backing them up that will get them out of the trouble in other words no weapon come on that is formed against thee shall prosper listen he never said it wouldn't be formed he just said it wouldn't Prosper are you hearing me he never said that the weapons wouldn't come against you he just said amen I am your shield and I am your buckle I am the sword I am the breastplate come on ambassadors it's time to quit backing up from your assignment it's time to step into position under the headship of your king and do what he's positioned you and appointed you to do you say well I've been appointed leosa you've been put here to tear down the devil's Kingdom you've been put here to overcome Leota you have been put here to walk on the head of every devil yes sir not been put here to be the overcome you've been put here to be the Overcomer sir it's the truth now I might as well just preach this one an ambassador never somebody say never becomes a citizen of the state or the kingdom to which he is assigned they never become a citizen to the kingdom or the state that they're assigned so they go in there as an ambassador from America and they never give up their message I mean their American identity and take on China's Identity or Germany's Identity or Russia's identity no because they're an ambassador I love this one they can only be recalled by the king or the president who appointed them oh my oh yeah yes so they can't just wake up one day and say you know what I'm done being Ambassador y they can't wake up one day brother Peter and decide to be an ambassador and neither can they wake up one day and decide they're not going to be one any longer can I just say it and neither did you wake up one day and decide you was going to be a Christian and neither can you wake up on a bad day and decide you're not going to be a Christian you didn't save yourself you didn't make yourself a Christian but God who is the king of this heavenly Kingdom he saved you he redeemed you he called you brother said if you are a Christian you didn't become a Christian because you wanted to but Allan you become a Christian because God elected you from before the foundation of the world to be a Christian yes sir come on Peter I'm I hate to pick on you amen but but but one day you didn't wake up and decide you know what today I'm Ben puit son you didn't walk in there and say uh Ben do you like me and he says yes Peter I like you and you said okay Daddy I'm glad you like me today I'm gonna be your son right and then a few days later here get up and say you know what I just don't feel like I'm I don't feel like I excuse me Ben am I still your son yes Peter you're still my son okay Daddy I'm in no he was his son before he was born come on come on church he was his son before he was born then there's nothing he can do to reverse what's already been done church are you hearing me it's easier amen for a mama to forget her suckling babe than for God to forget his ambassadors listen Hallelujah I may get in trouble here brother way but I'm going to say it America might forget their citizens and they might forget their soldiers when they withdraw from a country amen but when God Gets Ready Amen to take all of his ambassadors out of Leota they ain't going to be left behind they ain't going to be jumping on airplanes trying to catch a right out no they're going to know it's time to go because the mission has been accomplished yes sir are you hearing me they can only be recalled Brother David they can only be recalled by the king or the president who appointed them I like this one he has access to all the nation's wealth for the assignment so if he goes in his ambassador from America to Russia he don't go down there and get a loan from Russia to fulfill America's commission but the country that sends him come on church is the same country that will supply his every need now this is one I could preach on for about an hour he never speaks his personal position on any issue right he only says what the nation he has embody believes woo Glory I'll shout by myself in other words he never says something different than what's already been said on them tapes he never said come on Church come on Amen they never go as an ambassador and say well I think it's all right to wear shorts because that was just brother brandom's opinion no he embodies the kingdom that he is representing and he don't have a thought coming he don't have a thought coming the only thought he has is the one that's been given to him from the one that sent them he never speaks his personal position on any issue that's good that's good come on he never stands and says it's just too hard you know what he never does he never stands Brother David and says it can't be done he don't do that brother Joe he never stands and says it's impossible are you hearing me an ambassador never says that you know why because that's not the official position of the Kingdom that he's embodying the official position of the Kingdom that you're embodying is this nothing is imp possible with our God come on church he never stands there and says I can't overcome this that's not the official position the official position is greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world what are you saying preacher I'm saying ambassadors they never speak their personal position are y'all ready for this their goal is to in uence the territory for their Kingdom their whole purpose in being there is to allow I'm I'm closing on this is to allow what is embodying them to influence what's around them young people God has invested his word in you but a word experience yeah the same way he did daniiel Daniel never became a citizen of Babylon come on Church Daniel never changed what he did in Babylon come on you remember they told him said don't pray but he was an ambassador so because he was an ambassador he didn't say okay I just I just won't pray I'll just I'll just I just I'll just go over here and pray in secret you know I want I mean I want holler and and and call on the God that I believe in because the kingdom I men down here don't believe that that should be done are you hearing me yes don't believe that should be done so I tell you what I'm going to do is I'm just going to I'm just going to go over here and I'm going to close the windows and I'm going to I'm going to get real quiet over here in the corner and I'm going to pray like a Babylonian well you won't pray cuz they was heathens and they didn't right that's right and if you start trying to go to church like aay of see you won't be there cuz half of them don't go Glory are you hearing me if you start trying to act like Le oosa you're going to give up your position as an ambassador but I say tonight in closing God is calling ambassadors come on come on church God is calling ambassadors he's calling young women he's calling young men he's calling young babies he's calling people to be ambassad ERS listen he has committed to you the word of reconciliation he's calling you to change the atmosphere come on he didn't call you to become a part of that school he called you to change it on yes sir didn't call you to become a part of that job he called you to change it all he never he never he never you hearing me come on he never changes who he is can I say this to you he sent away from his home for a purpose yeah now can I can I can I get this in your heart come on he must act the same way away from his home yeah true country as he would while he was in it can I give you the rest of that no matter what the conditions [Music] are he cannot allow the conditions to change the way he conducts himself are you hearing me he cannot change the way he conducts himself based on the conditions you said brother Andrew can you prove that actually I can BR said there was a bunch of slaves in the field one day all right he said and they walked by there and and he said there was one over there he said you never had to whip him all right come on he said you never had to go over there and holler at him and tell him what to do oh we might as well preach you never had to go there and beg him to go to church you never had to go beg him to conduct himself in the house of God like a Christian ought to he never had to go beg him to change the way he was dressed you never had to go come on Church you never had to go beg him because he knew who he was so the all the the the uh the guy that bought the slaves come by and he said hey he said I want to buy that one not for sale he said why not he said you don't have to whip him you don't have to do nothing he does what he's supposed to do he said I wonder brother said the slave owner he said he looked at him he said I wonder the same thing he said so I started doing some research he said you mean you don't feed him anything different yeah you mean you don't give him a special position in church to make them you mean you mean you don't just o and a and goo and Gaga over them all the time to make Him worship God you mean they don't have no special seat you mean they don't have no special parking spot come on well we might as well preach you mean they're not singing on Wednesday night and they're still there hello yeah he said I got to wonder he said you don't feed him at the different he said no he eats with the rest of slaves yeah he said but I got to doing some research on him and I found out that way over there in the Homeland his father is the king he is the son of a king he said so no matter how far away he is from home he has not forgot he is the son of a king therefore he conducts himself brother Ben he conducts himself like a the king would conduct himself young people we're a long ways from home we have come from God we must go back to God but may I leave you with this don't forget who you are don't forget who called you

and they got him and they was taking him out on the stretcher and I was over in the corner of the little living room there uh the hall they had there in the house and I was sitting there and I was scared to death cuz I mean they were saying things that you know you just know something bad's going on you know and I never forget was they were rolling back a rolling him by take put him in the ambulance take down the hospital they said these words they said the way he looking right now he may not come back back and I just remember I just remember Standing There Brother Joel and something

14year old boy and you invested Jeremiah's message into his life and father in the time of captivity in the atmosphere of defeat in the middle of heathen worship and traditional gods and Idols Lord you had a young man named Daniel who stood there as a ambassador from the kingdom of God and testify to the word of God now father I believe I'm looking tonight at Young ambassadors Lord father I'm praying that your grace and mercy rest upon them father maybe they're going to school with people young friends that are not Believers Lord in peer pressure it's gathering around their lives and it's surrounding their minds father maybe not so much for the younger ones but the older ones in the teenage years Lord father going through high school and into college and different situations and Lord peer pressure begins to gather on them Father may they see that peer pressure is only coming because they're ambassadors they have been sent from the kingdom of light in the middle of darkness and father they are conducting themselves they are conducting themselves Hallelujah as ambassadors father I pray for strength upon them Lord I pray for your protection as the king of their lives upon them Lord father may you give them the grace Lord May the peer pressure Lord may it never push them into acting like the citizen of Le osia into acting like the children of Darkness into acting like the unbelievers the makeb Believers but oh God may your spirit preserve them Lord as ambassadors on assignment in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen maybe you just close your eyes right now raise your
