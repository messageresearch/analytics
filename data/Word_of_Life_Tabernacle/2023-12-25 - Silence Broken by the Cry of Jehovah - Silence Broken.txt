TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what was the noise the proof of life amen just like in the manger the noise was a proof that God deity had been born in human vessels again deity had been born but it wasn't just any noise come on now watch it wasn't just noise for the sake of noise but it was noise fulfilling the word of God there you go with other tongues I with with other tongues and he said with uh all these things I'll speak to my people I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh and and people begin to wonder what's going on and Peter stands up and begins to preach and he says this day these people are not drunk as you suppose but this is that this noise amen is the result of people being born yes Christ being born in the hearts of the people oh I trust that would be the case with us today we would never be a dead cold place it would never be a silent place but that way the noise could be a not just noise for the sake of the music not just noise for the s of well so and so is doing and I might as well do it too but no it's because there's a living God because he's being manifested in the hearts of the people
