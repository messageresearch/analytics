[53:45] Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord
[53:52] let's go to Romans chapter 14 and verse
[53:54] 19 also read from Psalms 34 Verse 14
[53:59] Romans 14 19 and Psalms
[54:15] 3414 Romans
[54:19] 14:19 said let us therefore follow after
[54:22] the things which make for peace
[54:27] I want to reread that because it's very
[54:30] important let us therefore follow after
[54:33] the things which make for peace and
[54:37] things wherewith one may edify another
[54:40] and then Psalms
[54:51] 34:14 says depart from Evil and do good
[54:55] seek peace
[54:57] and pursue it the Lord would that his
[54:59] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[55:01] this
[55:04] morning Paul says
[55:06] follow pursue is what that word means it
[55:09] actually means to pursue or persecute a
[55:13] person who would persecute another would
[55:15] mean they were following them they were
[55:17] would not leave them alone he said
[55:20] pursue those things which make for peace
[55:24] David says seek peace peace
[55:27] pursue
[55:29] peace Paul is telling the church he said
[55:32] don't I don't want you to argue about
[55:34] meats and that's what chapter 14 uh much
[55:37] of it is about Romans that I want you to
[55:39] argue over whether we should eat this
[55:41] meat or that meat or or things like that
[55:44] he said that's nothing he said I want
[55:46] you to follow things I want you to
[55:48] pursue things that make for peace in the
[55:52] church and and that don't cause conflict
[55:55] I want you to pursue the ingredients if
[55:58] we could put it that way of Peace in the
[56:00] church so you know a lot of people want
[56:03] peace and I've heard peace described it
[56:05] there was a a king that uh commissioned
[56:08] a a painter to paint a picture of peace
[56:11] and different painters had had painted
[56:14] uh beautiful landscapes and Still Waters
[56:17] and and uh and and pastures of idic
[56:21] scenes and and then one painter he
[56:24] painted a storm and and he painted a a
[56:28] waterfall and everything's gray and
[56:30] cloudy and the wind's blowing but in the
[56:33] Cliff of the rock there by the waterfall
[56:35] is a little bird and a little nest and
[56:38] it's shielded from the storm and it's at
[56:40] peace in the middle of storm so peace is
[56:43] not the absence of trouble but it's
[56:45] actually peace in the storm or as Paul
[56:48] puts it peace that passes understanding
[56:52] peace that passes understanding peace is
[56:55] to set at one again that which was
[56:58] separate or against itself and so we are
[57:02] made peace that's why Paul says uh peace
[57:04] was brought by the cross we were at odds
[57:07] with God and and we were against him
[57:09] there was a Chasm between us and him and
[57:11] peace is to set that back again Paul
[57:14] tells us I didn't give you the scripture
[57:16] but he said God is not the author of
[57:18] confusion but of peace and he said as in
[57:22] all the churches of the Saints he's not
[57:23] the author of confusion but of peace now
[57:28] if you want peace in the church I want
[57:29] to dig a little bit deeper than the
[57:32] church this morning I want us to look at
[57:34] peace in our homes I want us to look at
[57:37] how we pursue peace in the home because
[57:40] if we pursue peace in our home will'll
[57:43] pursue peace in the church there will be
[57:45] peace in the church and I believe we
[57:47] have peace and I'm so thankful for that
[57:49] so I'm not preaching at you today but I
[57:51] know it's a world of chaos and we we
[57:54] need to understand what it takes the
[57:56] ingredients that it takes to have peace
[57:59] in our homes and I want us to think
[58:01] about the home today and and all day
[58:03] today I want us to think about the home
[58:05] as the space that we live in not
[58:07] necessarily just our physical space but
[58:10] our our mental space our the the the the
[58:13] life that we inhabit your not just
[58:16] necessarily your house but your people
[58:19] uh your family the ones you're
[58:20] responsible for or the ones that are
[58:22] responsible for you it's your routine
[58:25] it's what you do every day it's your
[58:28] your your spouse your children it's your
[58:30] home life it's the way brother brand
[58:32] puts it home life it's the natural state
[58:35] of your relationship in your home and we
[58:37] know that without the word of God we
[58:40] know that the natural state of
[58:42] relationships and homes is
[58:45] chaos it is chaos and it takes the word
[58:49] of God to put it back into bring it back
[58:52] to peace again we find that in Genesis
[58:54] chapter 1 when the Earth was left to its
[58:57] own devices it was without form it was
[58:59] void and darkness was upon the face of
[59:01] the deep but then the spirit of God be
[59:03] to move on the face of the waters and
[59:06] then God be to speak and he said let
[59:08] there be light and it brought order
[59:10] where there was disorder and I want to
[59:12] tell you this morning that the spirit
[59:14] quickened word will bring order to your
[59:17] home the spirit quickened word will
[59:19] bring will bring peace out of chaos
[59:21] it'll bring a home that's according to
[59:23] the word instead of one that's according
[59:25] to the
[59:26] world yeah so there's no order in our
[59:29] homes or in our churches without the
[59:32] spirit quickened word right and I want
[59:35] us to notice this morning brother
[59:36] brandom begins to see a decline in home
[59:39] life what he calls home life in America
[59:42] back in the
[59:43] 50s and when we think about the 50s you
[59:46] think about almost a a time of peace and
[59:49] a time of tranquility and some of you
[59:51] lived through that time and and maybe it
[59:53] was a time when there wasn't a whole lot
[59:54] going on and and and so there was uh an
[59:57] absence of war and and and it was a time
[59:59] when kids could play out on the street
[1:00:01] and and and and weren't worried about
[1:00:03] things like we are today though there
[1:00:05] were there was trouble but not like what
[1:00:07] we have today and yet brother brandom
[1:00:09] sees something in that that the world
[1:00:12] had gotten away from something America
[1:00:14] in particular had gotten away from some
[1:00:16] things that they needed uh they needed
[1:00:18] to stay with they needed to do they had
[1:00:21] quit uh going they quit putting the
[1:00:24] ingredients of Peace in their home homes
[1:00:26] and pretty soon the peace left as well
[1:00:29] and so he begins to notice that now we
[1:00:31] know that today it is not a time of
[1:00:34] Peace it's a time of Chaos in the world
[1:00:37] how many understand that today the
[1:00:38] world's in chaos it's completely gone
[1:00:42] crazy it's gone completely insane
[1:00:45] brother B said there would come a day
[1:00:46] when it would be totally insane and
[1:00:48] we've reached that point the world is
[1:00:51] completely insane politics don't make
[1:00:53] sense churches don't make sense the
[1:00:55] world doesn't make any sense homes don't
[1:00:58] make any sense the way they order things
[1:01:00] just it just it's just
[1:01:02] crazy and who who comes up with that
[1:01:05] stuff well it's the collective Insanity
[1:01:07] of the world and brother there come a
[1:01:08] day that they'll be grouping in
[1:01:11] insanity and even the smartest people
[1:01:13] seems like the smarter they are the more
[1:01:15] insane they
[1:01:16] are right so that's the world we're
[1:01:19] living in and statistics show and I want
[1:01:22] you to understand this today statistics
[1:01:24] show that your marriage you end up
[1:01:26] broken your children will become drug
[1:01:28] addicts or perverts or something else
[1:01:30] but we are not a statistic today we're
[1:01:32] not here to just be part of the culture
[1:01:35] we're not here to be more make more
[1:01:36] Americans or more Republicans or more
[1:01:38] Democrats we're here to stand against
[1:01:40] history we're here we're going to be
[1:01:42] taken out of this world one of these
[1:01:44] days and the world's going to judgment
[1:01:46] I'm not going into tribulation I'm going
[1:01:48] into Rapture and so I need to stand for
[1:01:51] truth while we have the ability to stand
[1:01:53] for truth we as as parents we got to
[1:01:56] stand for truth as as fathers we got to
[1:01:58] stand for truth as mothers you got to
[1:02:00] stand for something and so we're we're
[1:02:03] getting far that the Gap is getting
[1:02:05] wider between us and the world but let
[1:02:06] it get as wide as it wants to get I'm
[1:02:08] going to stand for the word how about
[1:02:10] you this
[1:02:12] morning so we are not a
[1:02:15] statistic we're not that's why I don't
[1:02:17] even spend a lot of time talking to you
[1:02:19] about how bad it
[1:02:20] is because I want you to know that
[1:02:23] that's not you you're a Christian you're
[1:02:26] serving God you're you love the Lord and
[1:02:28] so that's not you're not a statistic
[1:02:30] you're you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] but we but the reason why we have peace
[1:02:35] in our homes the reason why we're
[1:02:36] different is because we have placed the
[1:02:38] ingredients that God gave us into our
[1:02:41] homes we've taken the word and done
[1:02:42] something with it now look we don't have
[1:02:45] to be a statistic Romans 12:1 says I
[1:02:47] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:02:49] mercies of God that you present your
[1:02:51] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:02:54] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:02:56] reasonable service or the least you
[1:02:58] could do and be not conformed to this
[1:03:01] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:03:04] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:03:06] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:03:09] will of God oh I want to prove that in
[1:03:12] my life don't you what is the will of
[1:03:14] God for a pastor let me prove it what is
[1:03:16] the will of God for for a lay member for
[1:03:19] a husband for a wife let us prove that
[1:03:22] in the midst of a world of
[1:03:24] chaos what should we be
[1:03:27] pursuing to have
[1:03:29] peace what are the ingredients he said
[1:03:31] pursue the things which make for peace
[1:03:35] what should we be
[1:03:37] pursuing and I think as I begin to look
[1:03:39] at the message and begin to look what
[1:03:40] brother BR says about the home life the
[1:03:43] first thing that I come across was we've
[1:03:44] got to pursue prayer in our
[1:03:48] homes I'm not talking about just prayer
[1:03:50] in the church but prayer in our
[1:03:53] homes you say well BR brother Ben you
[1:03:57] you talk about this a lot and and and
[1:03:59] you know we've heard this before it's
[1:04:01] nothing new well it probably isn't but
[1:04:03] I'll say this it'll make make the
[1:04:04] difference brother BR said how do you
[1:04:06] get closer to God read your Bible and
[1:04:08] pray so I think we need to pursue prayer
[1:04:12] pursue prayer not just have it as an
[1:04:15] afterthought or something we do for five
[1:04:17] minutes before a meal or 5 seconds
[1:04:19] before a meal but something that we
[1:04:22] intentionally do in our homes that
[1:04:25] brings PE peace to our homes Psalms 5:1
[1:04:27] says give ear to my words oh Lord
[1:04:29] consider my meditation hearken unto the
[1:04:31] voice of my cry my king and my God for
[1:04:34] unto thee will I pray my voice shalt
[1:04:37] thou hear in the morning I wonder if we
[1:04:40] can make a a commitment to that today we
[1:04:43] can say like David my voice shout th
[1:04:45] hear in the morning you're going to hear
[1:04:47] me Lord You're going to hear me you're
[1:04:49] going to hear my voice not just the
[1:04:51] pastor's voice not just somebody else's
[1:04:53] not just my wife not just my husband
[1:04:55] you're going to hear my voice in the
[1:04:57] morning in the morning will I direct my
[1:05:00] prayer unto thee and we'll look
[1:05:02] up now in the in the Bible you say well
[1:05:05] brother Ben my wife prays the the
[1:05:07] children pray before they go to school
[1:05:10] the pastor prays the preachers pray but
[1:05:12] I want to challenge us men because we
[1:05:14] tend to be the ones who are the least
[1:05:15] vocal and but we're supposed to be
[1:05:17] leaders in our home and we need to be
[1:05:20] the ones leading the
[1:05:22] prayer Bo it got
[1:05:24] quiet when we need to be the ones that
[1:05:26] are willing to pray that that that lead
[1:05:29] our homes into a place of prayer you go
[1:05:33] in the Old Testament you'll find it was
[1:05:34] always a man who made the sacrifice
[1:05:37] because he was Priest of the home and
[1:05:39] and I understand there's all different
[1:05:41] situations and you may be a widow or or
[1:05:44] at home alone by yourself and and you
[1:05:47] have every right to go to the throne of
[1:05:48] grace just like anybody else
[1:05:50] does in that situation you you're a
[1:05:53] child of God you're a daughter of God
[1:05:56] but if there is a husband in the home
[1:05:57] and he's a Believer then that believing
[1:05:59] husband ought to lead his family in
[1:06:02] prayer and you young people remember
[1:06:05] that don't be embarrassed if you're
[1:06:06] embarrassed to pray for your food in
[1:06:07] school what do you think it's going to
[1:06:09] be like when you get a home and you got
[1:06:10] to pray in the home right but you know
[1:06:14] makes a big difference it's hard you
[1:06:15] know it's hard to fuss at your wife and
[1:06:17] then pray for
[1:06:20] her you know that's right it's hard to
[1:06:23] get to to to fuss at your children and
[1:06:26] pray for them and pray with them so you
[1:06:29] we need to do that we need to be doing
[1:06:31] it on a daily basis and I we don't have
[1:06:33] laws or rules about that but you just do
[1:06:35] it and and God will make a way for you
[1:06:37] to do that if you have a desire for that
[1:06:39] it brings peace and stability to the
[1:06:41] home brother the matter of said it seems
[1:06:43] like that home life is running out into
[1:06:45] shallow water now watch he's watching
[1:06:47] this happen in a time when people other
[1:06:49] people maybe don't see it but what we
[1:06:52] have today is a result of what brother
[1:06:54] Brandon sees happening then yes sir it
[1:06:57] seems like home life is running under
[1:06:58] the shallow water used to be in a home
[1:07:00] that father the head of the house would
[1:07:01] sit down of a morning and he would speak
[1:07:03] with his family and they would all take
[1:07:05] out the old Family Bible and read just a
[1:07:07] little bit and all gather around the
[1:07:09] table and have prayer he said you don't
[1:07:11] see that no more and when the day was
[1:07:12] done and Ma had the dishes washed and
[1:07:14] they'd all Gather in and read some more
[1:07:16] of the Bible and pray before going to
[1:07:18] bed he said and home life is so
[1:07:21] neglected till the Bible is laid back
[1:07:23] till they'd have to hunt for an hour to
[1:07:24] find one in many homes in America they
[1:07:27] go to church on Sunday morning for their
[1:07:29] religion for about 20 minutes and if the
[1:07:32] pastor takes 30 minutes he's called on
[1:07:34] the board what is it he said home life
[1:07:37] is running
[1:07:38] out I can't say hello in 30
[1:07:41] minutes home life is running out you
[1:07:45] know and and I think we need to you say
[1:07:47] well brother Ben I don't think there's
[1:07:49] many things in my home that need changed
[1:07:51] well maybe not but we need to be changed
[1:07:54] and we don't pray brother said if you
[1:07:56] pray for the Lord to change things
[1:07:58] situations you pray wrong he said you
[1:08:00] pray to change
[1:08:02] yourself you pray to change
[1:08:04] yourself right that's what needs to
[1:08:06] change is
[1:08:08] yourself and so you pray because prayer
[1:08:11] changes you it changes your perspective
[1:08:14] on life it changes the way you look at
[1:08:17] one another prayer does that's why we
[1:08:20] should pray for our enemies right those
[1:08:23] who would despitefully use us those
[1:08:25] would be against us pray for them
[1:08:27] because it doesn't necessarily change
[1:08:29] them it changes you and how you view
[1:08:32] them so prayer changes the our our
[1:08:36] perspective it used to be brother B said
[1:08:38] that father and mother loved and honored
[1:08:40] and cherished one another and when she
[1:08:42] was old and gray and wrinkled up and her
[1:08:45] poor old face all drawed up and her
[1:08:47] glasses hanging down over her nose pop
[1:08:50] loved her just as well as he did when
[1:08:53] she was young and pretty
[1:08:55] like the old man said he said my
[1:08:56] eyesight has gone dim as your beauty has
[1:08:58] faded so we're just both in the same
[1:09:03] boat but you know Beauty will
[1:09:07] fade right man I'm so glad that marriage
[1:09:10] is more than that but prayer and brother
[1:09:13] Brown's talking about prayer here it's
[1:09:14] the same quote prayer changes your
[1:09:16] perspective to where you can love one
[1:09:19] another for what you are instead of what
[1:09:22] you want that person to be or what they
[1:09:24] used to be but you love them for what
[1:09:26] they are because you've changed too so
[1:09:28] it changes your perspective even of your
[1:09:30] spouse even of your children he said but
[1:09:33] today I don't mean to be critical but
[1:09:34] when she gets a little old he just swaps
[1:09:36] her for a new
[1:09:37] model it seems to be that way like
[1:09:40] swapping cars or something let me say
[1:09:42] this and I got to say these things I'm a
[1:09:44] pastor a woman should never feel that
[1:09:47] her husband is going to kick her out
[1:09:49] because she gained a little weight or or
[1:09:51] or she's got a few wrinkles she
[1:09:53] shouldn't have that worry and as
[1:09:55] husbands we need to we need to reinforce
[1:09:57] that in our
[1:09:59] wives we we need to reinforce that uh we
[1:10:02] need to we need to encourage our wives
[1:10:05] and make them understand that that
[1:10:07] that's you know they're just as
[1:10:09] beautiful today as they were the day we
[1:10:10] married them
[1:10:12] right you say brother man who you
[1:10:14] preaching at
[1:10:17] myself I I I told you before and it just
[1:10:20] gets a little bit personal but it makes
[1:10:22] my wife really embarrassed but but my
[1:10:24] wife still takes my breath away she
[1:10:26] still has that
[1:10:30] capacity it's
[1:10:33] true and there ought to be that
[1:10:35] moment and if you reach a place where
[1:10:37] just it's boring it's just boring you
[1:10:39] say well we need to go out to the world
[1:10:41] we need to go to a bar we need to go no
[1:10:43] you maybe we need to drink alcohol no
[1:10:45] what you need to do is pray what you
[1:10:47] need to do is change the way you think
[1:10:49] about things till your wife becomes
[1:10:51] beautiful again put your prayer goggles
[1:10:54] on some of you all know what I
[1:10:58] mean
[1:11:00] right why we have notes so we don't say
[1:11:03] things like that brother
[1:11:05] Joel but you need to you need to you
[1:11:08] need to look through eyes that have been
[1:11:11] anointed by
[1:11:14] prayer look BR said just something he
[1:11:18] said it seems like the real family love
[1:11:20] doesn't exist much more that just
[1:11:23] something has happened home life is
[1:11:24] running out we don't have the old
[1:11:26] American home as we used to have it long
[1:11:28] years ago this was in
[1:11:31] 1958
[1:11:35] 1958 he said but brother Ben I'm elected
[1:11:37] I don't need to pray I'm a Child of God
[1:11:39] okay you believe Jesus was the elect Son
[1:11:42] of
[1:11:44] God in fact he did no sin he was
[1:11:48] altogether lovely completely perfect
[1:11:51] sinless and he is our example in prayer
[1:11:54] he prayed more there's more examples of
[1:11:55] Jesus praying than any other character
[1:11:57] in The Bible he's our example in prayer
[1:12:01] he prayed at the beginning of the day in
[1:12:02] the middle of the day at the end of the
[1:12:04] day in Mark 135 in the morning rising up
[1:12:06] a great while before day that's the the
[1:12:09] commentator say it's about 4:00 in the
[1:12:10] morning I don't know if that's true but
[1:12:12] that's early says a great while before
[1:12:14] day he went out and departed into a
[1:12:16] solitary place and there prayed Mark
[1:12:19] 6:46 when he had sent them away he
[1:12:21] departed into a mountain to pray in the
[1:12:23] middle of the day and at night geane in
[1:12:25] the darkest moment of his life they come
[1:12:27] to a PL place which was named Gethsemane
[1:12:29] and he said to his disciples sit here
[1:12:32] while I shall
[1:12:33] pray brother Brandon was watching the
[1:12:35] breakdown of the home where people were
[1:12:38] too busy to pray he said Papa as a key
[1:12:41] to the house Mama has a key and they're
[1:12:42] both out and gone half the night the
[1:12:44] children don't know where they are and
[1:12:45] little ones are with the babysitter and
[1:12:47] that's the way life is lived he said do
[1:12:48] you know the Bible predicts all these
[1:12:50] things he said so what is it then it's
[1:12:53] that we're standing in a position
[1:12:55] watching these things run
[1:12:58] out watching these things run out now
[1:13:03] prayer again brings our body subject to
[1:13:06] the word listen even Jesus that's the
[1:13:08] way he prayed in Luke 22:40 he said when
[1:13:11] he was at the place he said to them pray
[1:13:13] that you enter not into temptation verse
[1:13:16] 41 and he was withdrawn from them by the
[1:13:18] Stones cast and kneel down and prayed
[1:13:20] saying father if thou be willing remove
[1:13:23] this cup from me nevertheless not my
[1:13:25] will but thine be done he was not
[1:13:27] praying to change the father's mind he
[1:13:29] was praying to change him yeah right
[1:13:33] this is what Paul means in 1 Corinthians
[1:13:34] 9:27 he said I keep under my body and
[1:13:37] bring it into subjection lested by any
[1:13:39] means when I have preached to others I
[1:13:42] myself should be a cast away he said I
[1:13:44] keep under my body how do you do that
[1:13:46] church you can't do that by by watching
[1:13:48] movies all the time and and going to uh
[1:13:51] going to uh entertainment all the time
[1:13:53] I'm not saying there's anything wrong
[1:13:54] with that I'm saying that's not how you
[1:13:56] bring the body under
[1:13:58] subjection right that that pleases the
[1:14:01] body it doesn't bring it under
[1:14:02] subjection what does prayer and
[1:14:05] fasting
[1:14:06] right boy got real
[1:14:09] quiet but it's still
[1:14:12] true when I preach to others he said I
[1:14:14] could be a cast away if I don't keep my
[1:14:16] body under subjection through
[1:14:19] prayer brother Brandon sees the results
[1:14:21] of prayer leaving the American Home the
[1:14:23] prayer that keeps you from temp ation
[1:14:25] and causes you to appreciate what you
[1:14:27] have as a gift from God brother Brandon
[1:14:30] said home life is uncertain he said I
[1:14:32] tell you I don't know what's happened to
[1:14:33] the moral fiber of our women divorce is
[1:14:35] on the move it's just terrible and you
[1:14:37] see where the divorce courts are crowded
[1:14:39] where girls and boys will marry and live
[1:14:41] together and have two or three kitties
[1:14:42] or something another like that and
[1:14:43] they'll separate and get out and marry
[1:14:45] another marry another marry another
[1:14:47] marry another marry another in their
[1:14:48] homes now today they don't even bother
[1:14:51] to get
[1:14:51] married I'm not trying to be hard on you
[1:14:54] I know we everybody body's got a past
[1:14:56] but thank God for the word that pulls us
[1:14:58] back to our future calls us away from
[1:15:01] our past to our
[1:15:02] future he said I was in a real a poor
[1:15:05] real poor home the other night and the
[1:15:06] man said I tell you he said I just don't
[1:15:08] know said I just don't know how I'm
[1:15:10] going to make ends meat I looked around
[1:15:11] he worked said he had a little old wife
[1:15:13] there just as true blue as could be four
[1:15:15] or five little old dirty faed kids on
[1:15:17] the floor I said boy you're a
[1:15:20] millionaire amen he said huh well
[1:15:23] brother brandom I wouldn't fut your word
[1:15:26] he said brother I ain't got a dime I
[1:15:28] said but you got something money can't
[1:15:30] buy right you got a little wife here
[1:15:32] that probably had got two dresses to her
[1:15:33] name and if she did is some some
[1:15:35] somebody give her cu the man just has a
[1:15:37] day's work now and then I said look at
[1:15:39] here but she's just as loyal as loyal
[1:15:40] can be I said there's many a
[1:15:42] multimillionaire tonight would give
[1:15:44] every penny he had to come home to a
[1:15:46] wife like that I said his wife is out
[1:15:48] with a bunch of men somewhere in a
[1:15:49] barroom somewhere cussing singing
[1:15:51] smoking night riding around things like
[1:15:53] that yet he loves her but look what he's
[1:15:55] got all of his life wrapped up in that
[1:15:57] woman look the way she's doing vice
[1:15:59] versa women to man he said there's no
[1:16:01] difference it's come time where all
[1:16:02] everything is just one conglomeration of
[1:16:04] sin little old woman at home trying to
[1:16:07] take care of her kids or husband out
[1:16:08] somewhere drunk and carrying on run with
[1:16:10] other women what would she give if she
[1:16:12] had millions of dollars to see that
[1:16:14] husband really become a man there's only
[1:16:17] one way for it to ever be Jesus Christ
[1:16:19] is the answer you want to be a real man
[1:16:21] you want to be a man that prays you want
[1:16:23] to be a man full of the Holy Ghost he is
[1:16:24] is the
[1:16:26] answer right amen he said there's no
[1:16:29] nothing can ever do any good at the end
[1:16:31] time it's Christ and him
[1:16:34] alone
[1:16:35] amen brand said we've never had a time
[1:16:37] we've had so many divorces in peace time
[1:16:39] as we got now our home life has broke up
[1:16:43] years ago it used to be that mother and
[1:16:44] dad was home at night if it wasn't for
[1:16:46] Church times or something they never let
[1:16:48] their children roam the streets run
[1:16:49] around all night long nowadays it seems
[1:16:51] to be kind of a popular opinion said oh
[1:16:54] how you just go to the home today look
[1:16:55] what it is Papa he has to hurry down to
[1:16:56] the pool room the boys are playing pool
[1:16:58] or they're bowling or something and him
[1:17:00] and M sister's at the canteen somewhere
[1:17:02] out some rock and roll party Junior's
[1:17:05] got the hot rod out seeing how many he
[1:17:06] can run down say that's about home
[1:17:10] life now let's just update that a little
[1:17:12] bit shall
[1:17:13] we huh because we don't hardly relate to
[1:17:17] that you think about it so well we don't
[1:17:19] do none of that we don't go
[1:17:21] nowhere but now Paul is gambling on
[1:17:23] sports
[1:17:26] just let that settle for a little bit
[1:17:28] you know it's still gambling even though
[1:17:30] it's
[1:17:31] Sports m's on
[1:17:34] Instagram sisters dancing on Tik
[1:17:40] Tok we used
[1:17:43] to forgive me there there was a girl on
[1:17:46] on a road that we used to drive on or we
[1:17:49] drove on to get to our house and and
[1:17:50] every day when the kids get out of
[1:17:51] school we drive past and that girl had
[1:17:53] already been dropped off and we drive
[1:17:54] past and that girl was out there dancing
[1:17:56] in the yard and I couldn't figure it out
[1:17:58] I was like you know it's fine I'm glad
[1:17:59] she's happy you know but she's out there
[1:18:02] doing cartwheels and jumping and stuff
[1:18:03] and the kid oh she's making videos for
[1:18:05] Tik
[1:18:06] Tok out in the yard and I guess somebody
[1:18:09] watches it I don't
[1:18:11] know and and you know and then Junior's
[1:18:14] on some dating site seeing how many he
[1:18:17] can run
[1:18:20] down right it just changed but it's
[1:18:23] still the same spirit right right right
[1:18:25] only we all do it from our pockets
[1:18:29] now carry our phones and everybody's
[1:18:32] sitting at home but nobody's
[1:18:37] there right now look said in the Bible
[1:18:41] oh it's a great book but it's put in a
[1:18:43] drawer somewhere until Pastor comes in
[1:18:45] or
[1:18:47] somebody and we just don't have the home
[1:18:49] life we used to have home life's so
[1:18:51] uncertain said a man nowadays getting
[1:18:53] married you young fellas you better pray
[1:18:55] a long time you better pray a long time
[1:18:59] huh we say that again you better pray a
[1:19:01] long time ask God to give you a
[1:19:04] companion you young women the same way
[1:19:06] because it's so
[1:19:07] uncertain he said in California I found
[1:19:10] out over there I think it was either 15
[1:19:11] or 20% something like that a perversion
[1:19:13] perverted people has increased in the
[1:19:15] last year or two this is in
[1:19:18] 1961 he's talking about in California
[1:19:20] how it had increased and today and I've
[1:19:23] given you this before and it seems
[1:19:24] almost unfathomable but somewhere around
[1:19:28] 75% of young people identify themselves
[1:19:31] as something other than a than a normal
[1:19:34] as we would say a straight male or
[1:19:37] female 7
[1:19:39] 34s of the
[1:19:42] people and I don't even say it's their
[1:19:44] fault it's the culture they live in it's
[1:19:48] just what they do it's what it's what
[1:19:49] gets them attention and they're starving
[1:19:52] for love starving for attention and
[1:19:54] that's what get some attention right
[1:19:56] true brother Brandon said notice in this
[1:19:58] day home life has become a situation
[1:19:59] ought to be dealt with my you little boy
[1:20:01] going out taking a rifle and shootting
[1:20:03] Papa and Mama while they're laying in
[1:20:04] bed dishonesty amongst our women and men
[1:20:07] our mothers and fathers we should never
[1:20:10] be dishonest with one another we should
[1:20:12] have everything completely clear between
[1:20:14] one and another there should be nothing
[1:20:15] we have to keep from our husbands and
[1:20:17] wives and we've said that comically
[1:20:18] about guns and bows and things like that
[1:20:21] you but you don't make purchases without
[1:20:23] your wife knowing
[1:20:25] right or at least knowing that you have
[1:20:27] her approval to do
[1:20:29] it right right if you know she wouldn't
[1:20:33] be happy with it or vice versa he
[1:20:35] wouldn't be happy with it come to an
[1:20:36] agreement before you do
[1:20:39] it boy this is this good stuff this
[1:20:43] morning I I don't say that very often
[1:20:45] brother Stuart but this must be good
[1:20:50] stuff but he said
[1:20:53] dishonesty if you hide money money you
[1:20:55] hide other
[1:20:57] things in lots of big cities the husband
[1:20:59] and wife pack secret keys or said same
[1:21:01] Keys pass keys to their apartment each
[1:21:03] one comes in eats a meal somewhere one's
[1:21:05] got a date the other one's got a date no
[1:21:07] more decency no respects at home homes
[1:21:09] in these days don't have the old fashion
[1:21:10] homes he said might too many doesn't
[1:21:12] have where the Bible's open and dad
[1:21:13] reads the chapter they kneel around the
[1:21:15] table and pray people go in and sit down
[1:21:18] and eat he said I've seen people go to
[1:21:19] the table and just start ging slopping
[1:21:21] around eating never ask the blessing
[1:21:24] I remember when I was in Africa I man
[1:21:27] brother Ivy and somebody else was there
[1:21:29] with us and and I brother Robert Wilson
[1:21:31] and I remember sitting there at the
[1:21:32] table man I was iing that food as soon
[1:21:34] as they brought it out man I started
[1:21:35] eating I'm sitting there a bunch of
[1:21:37] preachers and they looked at me I forgot
[1:21:39] to pray my kids caught me the other day
[1:21:42] but we should make time to pray because
[1:21:45] that's a blessing that we get to
[1:21:49] eat he he said I noticed one time it was
[1:21:51] out when we was living on the farm it
[1:21:53] was under a hog there was a hog under an
[1:21:55] apple tree and them apples was falling
[1:21:57] off and hitting him on the head and he
[1:21:58] eat apples all day long he never did
[1:22:01] look up to see where they was coming
[1:22:02] from where does my strength come from to
[1:22:05] work where does your strength come from
[1:22:06] to to live and and do the things that
[1:22:08] you do where do you get the strength to
[1:22:10] pick up your fork and eat that meal it
[1:22:12] come from God it didn't come from the
[1:22:13] government it didn't come from somebody
[1:22:15] else it come from
[1:22:17] God the blessings you have come from God
[1:22:20] we ought to thank him for it church we
[1:22:22] ought to love him for it he said you
[1:22:24] don't realize where food comes from you
[1:22:26] better look up and thank God for it
[1:22:28] because he was the one who gave it he
[1:22:29] said we we don't have no more security
[1:22:31] of the home send your children are
[1:22:32] school what do they teach them out there
[1:22:34] many times too many times they teach
[1:22:35] them we come from apes he said well we
[1:22:37] don't believe that and if a man's no
[1:22:39] more than an animal then eat drink and
[1:22:40] be married so that's what makes so many
[1:22:41] juvenile delinquents that's what makes
[1:22:43] so many crimes committed because if
[1:22:45] people no more than an animal it makes
[1:22:46] them act like an animal we need to teach
[1:22:49] our children at home my kids went to
[1:22:50] public school and they were younger and
[1:22:52] we since pulled them out but but they
[1:22:54] did go to public school but they already
[1:22:55] knew before they went to school how Man
[1:22:57] was
[1:22:58] created right they knew the story before
[1:23:00] they went to school and so when they
[1:23:02] went to school they dismissed that they
[1:23:04] didn't even think about that they said
[1:23:06] you wouldn't believe what they're
[1:23:07] teaching down at the
[1:23:08] school right and we know better than
[1:23:10] that why we've been taught by people we
[1:23:12] trust we've been taught the truth teach
[1:23:14] your children the truth you said we got
[1:23:16] to tell him he's a Son of God born for
[1:23:19] the kingdom of God he is somebody right
[1:23:22] come on he said this is amen he said
[1:23:24] this is just a negative a picture
[1:23:25] negative waiting for it to be developed
[1:23:27] someday and death is the only thing that
[1:23:29] can develop it he said when you die out
[1:23:31] to yourself a new picture starts on the
[1:23:33] inside and then that new creature Christ
[1:23:35] Jesus begin to show itself through and
[1:23:37] one of these days he will come and
[1:23:38] receive you up to himself then the whole
[1:23:40] thing will be changed then this negative
[1:23:42] Shadow will become a positive teach your
[1:23:44] kids that this isn't all there is but
[1:23:46] there's something more something greater
[1:23:50] they just won't follow what everybody
[1:23:51] else
[1:23:53] does uh how do we have peace in our
[1:23:55] homes well I think one of the
[1:23:57] ingredients of peace is to pursue the
[1:23:59] word look for the
[1:24:02] word Paul or David rather says order my
[1:24:05] steps in thy word let not any iniquity
[1:24:08] have dominion over me Luke 4:16 Jesus
[1:24:12] comes to Nazareth where he'd been
[1:24:13] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:24:16] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[1:24:17] and stood up for to read so his custom
[1:24:19] was to go to church and read the word
[1:24:21] and that's what we ought to do is go to
[1:24:23] church and read read the word do you
[1:24:25] believe that
[1:24:27] today I got to put my glasses on Sarah
[1:24:30] is that
[1:24:31] you my goodness it's good to have you in
[1:24:33] church this
[1:24:37] morning completely missed my sister
[1:24:39] being at church God's good to us isn't
[1:24:43] he it
[1:24:45] matters look people still go to church
[1:24:48] but it's become a
[1:24:50] striptise Sodom and Gomorrah right in
[1:24:52] the churches
[1:24:55] brother brand said home life has become
[1:24:57] uncertain said you know I seen a piece
[1:24:59] the other day in one of the journals
[1:25:00] somewhere that the American divorce rate
[1:25:02] is higher than any other nation in the
[1:25:03] world we're supposed to be a religious
[1:25:05] Nation he said yes could be that
[1:25:07] religion all right but it's not the
[1:25:09] right
[1:25:10] kind said religion is just a covering we
[1:25:12] don't want just religion we want the
[1:25:13] power of God we want a God who heals a
[1:25:16] God who saves a God who changes lives
[1:25:18] you believe he he's that kind of God
[1:25:20] today you believe he's still that kind
[1:25:22] of
[1:25:23] God sir
[1:25:26] your daughter had a liver transplant I
[1:25:27] believe the Lord Lord healed her and
[1:25:29] kept her brother the West sister
[1:25:30] glorious daughter my sister Sarah had a
[1:25:32] liver transplant she's a walking
[1:25:33] testimony of what God can do in
[1:25:35] somebody's life when she was four months
[1:25:37] old and
[1:25:39] and that's all
[1:25:43] right today she's off of medicine
[1:25:46] doesn't doesn't take any medicine I
[1:25:47] don't believe rejection medicine to this
[1:25:49] day was the first child to ever be taken
[1:25:51] off completely uh at the time that was
[1:25:53] taken off it a lot of years ago 1994
[1:25:56] when that happened think about it God's
[1:25:59] still God we don't want just religion
[1:26:01] come on we want a reality we want
[1:26:04] something that
[1:26:06] works religion is just a covering he
[1:26:08] said it's hard to tell what we make our
[1:26:09] covering out of Adam tried to make some
[1:26:11] out of fig Le it didn't work he got
[1:26:13] awful shaky when he had to come out to
[1:26:14] meet God religion doesn't mean it at all
[1:26:17] but could you think he said our divorce
[1:26:18] rate higher all the rest of the
[1:26:20] countries our divorce rate you said we
[1:26:21] find immorality on the Move in our homes
[1:26:24] said it was astounding to find out a
[1:26:25] great percent on the survey of the
[1:26:27] nation I believe was in Ohio a survey
[1:26:28] was taking Christianity he said it was
[1:26:30] alarming what a percent that did not
[1:26:32] even go to church and then about 80% of
[1:26:34] those that went to church didn't know
[1:26:35] why they went it's important to go to
[1:26:38] church but it's also important to know
[1:26:39] why you
[1:26:42] go he said well mother took us when we
[1:26:44] was a kid and we just keep on going and
[1:26:46] then another percent said they went just
[1:26:47] for all to meet their neighbors and talk
[1:26:49] a while he said well it's alarming no
[1:26:52] wonder the home life is gone any home
[1:26:54] life that's not stable see it reflects
[1:26:57] to the church because the home life's
[1:26:59] not
[1:27:00] right and so we ought to pursue the word
[1:27:03] go to church and know why we go read the
[1:27:06] word now look he said one of the great
[1:27:09] lackings of our day today in America and
[1:27:10] the rest of the world is Godly Parents
[1:27:11] has had an influence upon their children
[1:27:14] the parents of this day has got away
[1:27:15] from the principles of the scripture
[1:27:16] they went more to the Fashions of the
[1:27:18] world the churches did the same thing he
[1:27:19] said in doing that we let it loose and
[1:27:21] brought the world into the church that's
[1:27:23] the reason we have this great have he
[1:27:24] said if I say it respectfully here
[1:27:26] before these young people the reason we
[1:27:27] got so many hoods and so forth as they
[1:27:29] call it and bad characters too much of
[1:27:31] it is because the home life that they
[1:27:32] were influenced by in their earlier days
[1:27:35] he said I'm still a Believer and bring
[1:27:36] up a child in the way it should go and
[1:27:38] when it gets old it will not depart from
[1:27:42] it he said but brother Ben I'm hurrying
[1:27:45] through this morning but we're we're
[1:27:47] doing good on time but you say brother
[1:27:50] Ben I've done all this I've I I've I've
[1:27:53] set the word before my children I prayed
[1:27:55] for
[1:27:56] them there's there's other ingredients
[1:27:58] that go into making a home full of Peace
[1:28:01] you got to have
[1:28:02] love right there's got to be some joy in
[1:28:05] the home yeah right fruits of the spirit
[1:28:08] because
[1:28:09] otherwise kids aren't comfortable
[1:28:11] spouses aren't
[1:28:13] comfortable I think most of all maybe
[1:28:15] the most important because we can talk
[1:28:16] about all those things but
[1:28:21] forgiveness forgiveness
[1:28:24] see Jesus said in Mark 11:25 he said
[1:28:27] when you pray forgive right yes every
[1:28:32] time you pray
[1:28:35] forgive don't pray without
[1:28:39] forgiving that's a commandment from God
[1:28:42] When you stand praying
[1:28:44] forgive if you have ought against any
[1:28:48] brother BR says that's any say if you
[1:28:49] have a scratch of a against any sinner
[1:28:52] or Saint you're in danger of Hell Fire
[1:28:55] what brother brandom said pursue
[1:28:59] forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness is
[1:29:01] tough yeah it's tough to forgive yeah
[1:29:05] when you stand praying forgive if you
[1:29:07] have ought against any that your father
[1:29:09] also which is in heaven May forgive you
[1:29:11] your trespasses right and the problem is
[1:29:15] that is an attribute of God and it takes
[1:29:17] the Holy Ghost to do
[1:29:20] that but brother brand says this he
[1:29:23] talks about a man or a young boy I've
[1:29:25] read it to you many times but I just
[1:29:26] want to read this portion talks about a
[1:29:28] young boy that shouldn't get married he
[1:29:31] said that young boy that shouldn't get
[1:29:32] married the reason why he shouldn't get
[1:29:34] married he said is because he could not
[1:29:36] forgive he couldn't ask for forgiveness
[1:29:38] and he couldn't
[1:29:39] forgive and he talked about it he said
[1:29:41] they know it's right but it's just not
[1:29:43] in them to ask forgiveness or ask
[1:29:46] pardoning they just won't do it it's
[1:29:48] just not in them he said now the genes
[1:29:50] in the father and the mother of this boy
[1:29:52] no matter how much they're converted two
[1:29:53] remains the flesh has been interbred out
[1:29:55] to this boy therefore the boy's got a
[1:29:57] complex in him just like from his
[1:29:58] mother's family they're not forgiving
[1:30:00] they will not apologize and that's where
[1:30:02] the boy stands right and the father said
[1:30:04] my son went to the altar he was baptized
[1:30:06] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:08] and he said he said I know my son has
[1:30:10] come to Christ and I said that may be
[1:30:12] all right all the outward motions he
[1:30:13] might be identified as a Believer with
[1:30:15] the Believers but until he's regenerated
[1:30:17] born again he said I'd advise that young
[1:30:19] man to never marry a woman he'll make
[1:30:22] hell on Earth for her until that gentle
[1:30:24] sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes
[1:30:29] in without it home is going to be a
[1:30:33] place of
[1:30:34] chaos because people in a home are going
[1:30:37] to make
[1:30:38] mistakes every one of us live with the
[1:30:40] human element we are
[1:30:43] humans so we have to
[1:30:46] forgive Jesus didn't have to have
[1:30:48] forgiveness but he gave us
[1:30:51] forgiveness you imagine living a life
[1:30:54] for you never had to say you're sorry
[1:30:56] you realize Jesus lived that kind of
[1:30:59] life but he still said father forgive
[1:31:06] them Father forgive them they don't know
[1:31:08] what they're doing oh I'm so glad for a
[1:31:11] God who can forgive who not only
[1:31:14] forgives but has the capacity to forget
[1:31:16] and throw it in the sea of his
[1:31:18] forgetfulness as though it never
[1:31:19] happened in the first place oh what a
[1:31:21] mighty revelation we have in this day of
[1:31:23] of what of what justification is how it
[1:31:26] takes us away from what we were from our
[1:31:28] old sinful nature makes something new
[1:31:30] out of
[1:31:32] us good I advise that young man to never
[1:31:36] marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth
[1:31:38] for
[1:31:39] her see Jesus understood that without
[1:31:43] forgiveness from the heart this world is
[1:31:45] so
[1:31:46] broken will never
[1:31:49] survive and I want to counsel you young
[1:31:51] people and you young families you young
[1:31:53] parents unless you can
[1:31:55] forgive you'll never survive if you
[1:31:58] can't forgive your parents you'll never
[1:31:59] forgive your spouse you'll never forgive
[1:32:02] your
[1:32:03] children and it'll never be peace in the
[1:32:06] home
[1:32:07] right but he said this even even more
[1:32:10] than that he said if you do not forgive
[1:32:12] neither will your father which is in
[1:32:13] heaven forgive your
[1:32:16] trespasses so our own forgiveness hinges
[1:32:19] on us
[1:32:21] forgiving see Jesus died so we could be
[1:32:26] forgiven and without the
[1:32:28] cross you see we were in chaos against
[1:32:32] God how many believe that today how me
[1:32:34] understand that we were separated from
[1:32:36] God and without the cross we could never
[1:32:38] no amount of rules could ever bring the
[1:32:40] human race into fellowship with God they
[1:32:42] had hundreds of laws they had all kinds
[1:32:44] of things that they had set up that they
[1:32:46] did and some people even tried to live
[1:32:48] it to the letter right and yet they all
[1:32:51] failed to live it right and Paul says he
[1:32:54] was guilty of one letter of the law is
[1:32:55] guilty of the whole thing right but it
[1:32:58] took the cross it took the cross to
[1:33:00] bring forgiveness because the Human
[1:33:03] family was broken yeah and God had to
[1:33:06] give forgiveness for us to be whole
[1:33:08] again don't you realize we got to
[1:33:10] forgive one
[1:33:11] another look you you say well you see
[1:33:14] legalism will never bring peace to your
[1:33:16] home sir you're never going to have
[1:33:18] peace in your home because you said
[1:33:20] about your rules and then they break
[1:33:21] them well they're going to break them
[1:33:23] that's right and we should have rules
[1:33:25] but that's not what brings peace to the
[1:33:26] home what brings peace to the home is
[1:33:27] love and
[1:33:30] forgiveness not the
[1:33:32] rules and if we get to a place where
[1:33:35] they broke the rule we're going to cast
[1:33:36] them off how can you cast off your own
[1:33:38] flesh you can't do that yes sir you Cast
[1:33:41] Away your own family oh that gives us a
[1:33:43] great picture of God doesn't it brother
[1:33:45] Brandon said that Abraham when Abraham
[1:33:48] and Sarah and and and here MDC comes and
[1:33:51] and he speaks God in flesh and says
[1:33:53] you're going to have a baby and Sarah
[1:33:54] laughed in the tent behind Abraham
[1:33:57] brother BR said God would have smoted
[1:33:58] her dead right then but she was part of
[1:34:01] Abraham Oh my he couldn't hurt her
[1:34:04] without hurting Abraham you can't be
[1:34:05] lost if you're a child of God you belong
[1:34:07] to God I'm so glad for that
[1:34:11] today amen legalism will never bring
[1:34:14] peace to your home see more rules and we
[1:34:18] have rules we sat down and wrote out a
[1:34:19] little contract the other day
[1:34:24] told the kids this when you're going to
[1:34:25] get up and this is when we have
[1:34:27] rules but forgiveness and love is the is
[1:34:30] the grease that makes the engine not
[1:34:36] overheat and I want you to understand
[1:34:39] you forgive me for just being myself
[1:34:40] this morning but I want us to understand
[1:34:43] how he forgives us when's the last time
[1:34:46] you went to God for
[1:34:48] forgiveness this
[1:34:50] morning for most of us
[1:34:54] did he make you
[1:34:56] wait if you were really sorry did he
[1:34:59] make you wait sir if you really come to
[1:35:02] God and you said I'm sorry
[1:35:05] I I didn't Lord you know I'm stupid I
[1:35:09] didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to
[1:35:10] say that what does he do he forgives
[1:35:15] you why do we make other people wait
[1:35:19] right he doesn't make you suffer he
[1:35:21] already suffered for you
[1:35:24] he doesn't make you pay for it you
[1:35:26] realize that nothing that happens in
[1:35:27] your life is retribution from
[1:35:30] God right nothing that happens in your
[1:35:34] life is retribution from God because if
[1:35:37] God hated you and wanted to hurt you
[1:35:39] don't you realize that he would he he
[1:35:42] would be doing he would be denying his
[1:35:44] own death and the suffering he went
[1:35:47] through right he he suffered for us and
[1:35:51] if that was sufficient for our sins
[1:35:54] then he can't make us suffer for sin he
[1:35:57] can put us allow us to go through trials
[1:35:59] for our Perfection for character but he
[1:36:02] cannot make us suffer for sin right we
[1:36:04] can't suffer when he already suffered
[1:36:06] for sin and died once for
[1:36:09] all listen so what do we have to do he
[1:36:11] don't make us wait I want us to think
[1:36:13] about this for a moment before we close
[1:36:15] he doesn't make us wait and suffer he
[1:36:18] said brother believe the
[1:36:20] story accept it and be born again yeah
[1:36:24] amen he does sit there you know how we
[1:36:26] do sometimes with our spouses or our
[1:36:29] children I'm going to make him chew on
[1:36:31] that for a
[1:36:35] while make him suffer make her suffer
[1:36:38] not what he
[1:36:39] did he just wants you to believe the
[1:36:42] story accept it and be born again that's
[1:36:46] all he wants you to do today just
[1:36:47] believe it you say well I can't prove
[1:36:49] it's true nobody can just believe
[1:36:51] it I don't have any scientific proof of
[1:36:54] this message being right but it is and
[1:36:56] you say how do you know it is because it
[1:36:59] works it works in our lives it works
[1:37:01] with our children it works in our homes
[1:37:04] it works for those who have fallen to
[1:37:06] get them back up again just believe it
[1:37:09] accept it be born again he don't make
[1:37:11] you suffer for your sin right so if I
[1:37:13] come back to church I'd have to go
[1:37:15] through a period of suffering and drag
[1:37:16] myself over some Stones since when was
[1:37:18] that part of the Gospel he don't make
[1:37:21] you suffer for sin he said walk up with
[1:37:23] pure faith knowing this that God is
[1:37:26] promised and God can't lie God promised
[1:37:29] me eternal life if I believe on his son
[1:37:32] Jesus Christ I believed it and he gave
[1:37:34] me eternal life Hallelujah he said I
[1:37:36] made many mistakes still make them will
[1:37:38] always make them but when I make them
[1:37:40] the Holy Spirit tells me that's wrong
[1:37:43] then I Repent right there Lord forgive
[1:37:45] me didn't mean to do it you help me now
[1:37:48] when is the time to repent whenever you
[1:37:50] do the wrong and you know it don't make
[1:37:52] somebody wait on an apology and don't
[1:37:55] make them wait to forgive them yeah he
[1:37:57] don't make you
