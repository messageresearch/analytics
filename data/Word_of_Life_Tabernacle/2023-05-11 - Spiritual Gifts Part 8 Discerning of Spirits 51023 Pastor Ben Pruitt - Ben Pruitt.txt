Lord pray you would open up our spiritual understanding may we be Lord mature grown Christians as we walk with you until that day we walk with you all the way home we thank you for that Lord I Thank you for these people that have gathered on Wednesday night I pray a special blessing for them Lord getting your precious thing amen amen First Corinthians 12 10 and Hebrews 4 12 First Corinthians 12 10 in Hebrews 412 I wanted to say happy birthday as well to to Allison and Stuart what a blessing that they are to the church I know that they're watching tonight and it's such a blessing that they've been over the years and just stood by the leadership here in the church and and become leaders in the church I'm thankful for that I'm thankful for you young people brother Danny sometimes as we get older I'll just say it that way it's nice to have young men and women stand up and and in the position that they can fill and do those things and and uh so just say happy birthday to them and kind of need to be married to somebody who's born on the same day you was born on so that's kind of nice but it seems like somebody may have arranged that so uh and then Peter's birthday today and Peter's back there taking care of stuff he's not listening to me right now but that young man does more than what you realize for the services here when you're not able to be here a lot of what we're able to do is because of that young man and and I I give him a hard time all the time I'm hard on him Joel's hard on him and we give him a hard time all the time but Peter I want you to know I appreciate you and what you do here in the church and happy birthday 16 is a big one so that's uh boy about growing up I told him I said after today now your room is going to be clean and you're going to want to mow the yard and and things are just going to be different you know you're all grown up so amen don't you wish it worked that way even for us adults First Corinthians 12 and 10 it says to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits that's what we want to deal with tonight and then Hebrews 4 and 12 for the word of God is quick that's alive and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints and Morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you on the Discerning of spirits and discernment in general tonight the word discernment in the Greek is distinguishing distinguishing and deciding or passing sentence on distinguishing and so we have to be able to distinguish the difference between one thing and another that's what discernment is and so in in Webster in 1828 Webster defined discernment as the act of Discerning the power or faculty of the Mind by which it distinguishes one thing from another it distinguishes truth from falsehood virtue from Vice acuteness of judgment power of perceiving differences of things or ideas and their relations and tendencies so we could say it this way tonight A discerner is a judge right everybody understand that to judge so Discerning of spirits is to judge between one spirit and another right and it'll just kind of kind of walk through this tonight so we'll so we'll really get it it's so important to us because we need discernment we need discernment we need the discernment in our life that will allow us to continue to be uh to live like Christians ought to live and and that don't just come although we have discernment if we have the Holy Ghost we have Christian discernment which is one of the the types of discernment so we have discernment but we have to grow in that discernment from the time that we're born again and Paul uses that in Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 13 and I'll say this before we go there there's there's basically three types of discernment the areas of what brother Branham calls a gift of discernment and I think he's identifying that as a gift of discernment because that's what the Pentecostals would understand it as but that's to a prophet that would be a word prophet and we'll get into that in some depth tonight but that's a prophet only that would have that gift and then there's a gift of discerning of spirits and then there's Christian discernment between Good and Evil so it may not be necessarily you have a special gift but it's just something that's in you because the word is in you and you are a discerner the word is a discerner the thoughts and intense of the heart and so Paul puts it this way he said for everyone that useth milk is unskillful unskillful you don't you're not born into the church able to skillfully handle the word right that takes time and don't beat yourself up about that as we talked about Sunday that it takes time to skillfully handle the word and I've found many times that I would take the word and I'd take a certain thought on it but as I grow in my understanding and my ability brother Robert to just be able to handle the word I'll go back and look at that thought and think my there's so much more to it than what I realized before because even even without lay aside gifts and everything else you still have to grow into your discernment when it comes to the word now he said everyone that uses milk is unskilled from the word of righteousness it means he can only handle those things that that are easy right he can't he can't take any any kind of thing that would be hard to digest right right but now he said he's a babe he said but strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age that requires maturity he said even those who by reason of use you know why I don't have muscles I have muscles but not ones you can see because I don't use them enough if I would use them muscles would just come out just start to make themselves known right and discernment is the same way he said by re-faith it's the same way he said by reason of use have their senses exercised and so they that you exercise your senses you used it you you discern you think about it you you get into the word you grow in the word he said by by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil we need that today you need discernment sometimes where your kids are going to go to school and who their friends are going to be and and who you should marry and and so what car you need to buy it all kinds of different things we need spiritual that applies to our lives that's not just some some concept out here that only prophets can have we need spiritual discernment and spiritual things are spiritually discerned because Paul says the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're what spiritually discerned right now stay with me tonight and then and you're doing good on a Wednesday night he said the fair now the Pharisees Jesus said could not discern the right things he said you can discern the face of the sky and of the Earth but how is it that you do not discern this time and another place he calls it how can you not discern the sign of the time because you you discern the wrong things so we need to discern spiritual things and sober the random deals with that in a message called Discerning of spirits and he's he talks about how that many times we discern the group a man is in and who lets him preach rather than his spirit and his motive it's going to get kind of close here for a minute so just hang with me and we'll we'll get through it now he said I think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today he said we have an order from God is for the Discerning of spirit see my boss gives me an order right and he's the boss right in all things that he might have the preeminence as brother Joel preached Sunday night and so he's the boss and he gets to tell us what the order is and our order is that we should have the Discerning of spirits trying the spirit he said I believe that that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the spirit he said I do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or by the group that they are assembled with whether they be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal or whatever they are we should never judge The Man by the denomination that he belongs to you don't judge preachers in this church by the fact they go to this church or even that I approve of them but let the man's gift speak for itself right and so that's the way we should do what is the man's motive what is his objective and by Discerning that we we don't get LED astray now he said we should never judge The Man by the denomination he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has see the spirit see does he want to help people what's his motive is he building his own Ministry or is he helping the people and I'm glad we've got ministers like yeah that help the people that don't have any other motive but but that's what we want to watch for is that motive he said now he said we are to discern Spirits watch what the man has in mind what he's trying to achieve he said if the man by a gift no matter how great the gift is he said now there's so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have he said well I believe that these things are gifts I believe what we see take place as gifts and their god-given gifts but if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts and he said the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying this I would rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else he said see we must know what these things are for you now if a man comes and he has a great gift he said no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him by what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has and see and that's why you say brother being you're kind of harsh on some things and I know that I am you'd have to have been brought up the way that I was to to understand I I get cynical at times but whenever I see a man sinning promoting his own Ministry over and over and over again and he never talks about the message you don't talk it's his ministry and then if you don't believe it you're going to hell or something bad is going to happen to you so run away from that man your spiritual discernment ought to tell you this is a man that doesn't have the interest of the people at heart he's only interested in his own well-being and the continuation of his own Ministry but God could take us out of the ministry like that then where would we be so we got to be we have to be and I say God I don't say I don't say that I'm always as as I should be in that regard but I say God make make my motives tow the line because it's hard not to get ego mixed in it it's hard not to get these we're human beings we're in the flesh right we we have to we come to church in the flesh and yet we've got to lay that down to be able to minister that's why brother Brown said the gift is to get William Branham out of the way and let God do what God does so your only he said no matter how great a teacher he is he said how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that's what God told us to do he said not one time was we ever commissioned to discern the man's group but we was constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to yeah so now I want you to judge by the word and by the spirit right so it has to be the right word but that's not enough did you know that I also have to have the right motives in quoting you the word because Jesus Jesus rejected the word of the devil not because he quoted the wrong word he quoted the right word but because of who he was right he rejected because it was the devil quoting it so if the devil quotes you the word and he might sometimes you reject the fact that he quoted it because he's always going to take it out of context he's always going to misplace it misapply it right not because it's not the word he didn't get the word wrong but he got the it was the person so he was rejecting who was telling it so you don't have to just have the right word you need to have the right motives right a great example of that the word says that a word says it's not good for a man to be alone right and I could take that if I was a single man if I was an unmarried man I could take that and say well that means I need to get married and I can quote that to a girl and say okay the word says it's not good for a man to be alone and that's the word but what's his motive does he really love you is he is he interested in the family is he interested in taking care of you is there something there it's got to be more than just word you understand that there's got to be a motive behind it that's right so now that's just spiritual discernment ought to tell us that now there's a Discerning of spirits the gift of discerning of spirits along with the gift of wisdom remember it was to be used it was to be used to judge the other gifts so Discerning of spirits would actually judge whether the prophecy was right whether the tongues interpretation was right that's the purpose of it and and what it would be used for First Corinthians 14 29 is the scripture and we'll get more into that and when we get to tongues and interpretation but he said let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge but the other judge now brother Brown said we're talking about putting the gifts in the proper place in the room before the service he said before you start this he said get some Spirit of wisdom in there some discernment of spirits you see to find out he said the first thing you know you begin to notice somebody's begin to see that there's a little something wrong he said that's discernment how many of you have ever had just a feeling something was wrong you just didn't understand there was something wrong and you didn't know what it was you couldn't pinpoint it but there's just something wrong well you know sometimes that could be just you but it might be a spirit a discernment in your life and so you take it back to the word and look at the motives and discern the spirit of it are you with me so far you say well yeah remember random says he said there's a lot of difference between a prophet and a gift of Prophecy Before a gift of Prophecy really should be given in the church it has to come before two or three judges that's got the gift of discernment to say whether it can even be said he said well that's okay but my gift is different well you you you can you can live on the edges and in the exceptions but for me I'll take the word of a prophet right and I think that's what we ought to do now again God can do whatever he wants and we we we're we're happy to let God do what God wants to do right but at the same time we want to make sure we stay right with the word so brother rounds to what the church needs tonight is to know how to control these gifts he said for evil spirits you can come in and speak just the same as good spirits can speak he said you know that you must have the spirit of discernment to know that he said they had it in Bible times that's why Paul said let one judge and the people judge and so forth those gifts of Prophecy everything is supposed to be correctly put in order he said for Satan can imitate every gift that God's got every gift he can imitate it and you must know the right and wrong and by its fruits you know it that's why Paul said judge nothing before the time don't judge it on a mode don't judge a whole life on a moment right they may a bad decision a good decision but don't judge a whole life on five seconds judge it on its fruits now watch and he said watch whether it comes to pass and whether it's truth or not and that's the way you know the spirit now we know that the gifts have been restored aren't you glad for that but the restoration of gifts is not our message going to preach to you again I have a boss I have to listen to the boss the ma our message is the full word that's that's strong meat but I think we can take it tonight our message is the full word but the brown said we come into the Pentecostal age he talked about Luther and Wesley he said the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing it was fine in the age but we are going beyond that now he said we are beyond that just as sure as there is a world he said we've got to come Beyond this thing because we have done the same thing with it that they did before he's talking about the brass serpent remember what happened to the Brass serpent they it was something God used for healing and yet it become an idol and later on it had to be destroyed because the people began to worship it right right and he said they they've done that we have done the same thing with it that they did before making an idol out of it I belonged to this order of it I belong to that order of it he said God will send somebody that will smash the thing and tear it to pieces and confirm his word before word you say when is that person coming it was a prophet that came that was what the prophet was for he came and smashed that Pentecostal idea to pieces and let's not try to put it back together let it be let it lay not our message but yet we believe in the restoration of the gifts it's part of it but it's not we but we believe in the fullness of the word how many are glad for the fullness of the word tonight the fullness of the word will will correct us will keep us in the right way it is the Fallen it's Christ himself you realize the maturity of the age that you live in you don't live in a stalking you don't live in a in a tossful age you know you live in the age of the of the Original Seed the original grain that means it's all yours Joy is yours power is yours gifts are your all that's yours but you don't major on any one thing we're not looking for the restoration of one thing the bride Revival is not the restoration of gifts that has already been restored but the bride Revival is all of it amen it's restoring all of it foreign just hang with me I've I've studied this for weeks and weeks and weeks now a prophet had discernment how many know what he called discernment I mean know that our Prophet William Branham had discernment what he had happens one time to the Gentile age we went through that before but what he had was what Elisha had right now we've talked about gift of discernment we've talked about the Christians that has discernment between right and wrong but what did a prophet have now it wasn't merely a gift of discernment and this is what Elisha had when the heart of the king of Syria was troubled because somebody always knew what he was doing and every time he got the king of Israel in a trap he got out of it and he asked he said which one of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my Lord but Elisha the prophet telling the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in my bed chamber and how would Elisha know he saw it in a vision right it was a prophet this gift was known by the kings of the Earth as being true now brother Branham always goes back to Abraham on this Genesis 18 13 we're going to serve some strong meat tonight and and uh and then we'll go back to the milk for those that can't take it but I know that you can take it tonight that's why you're here on a Wednesday night but now brother Brown goes back to Abraham Genesis 18 13 the Lord said to Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh he was sitting with his back to the tent and Sarah didn't laugh audibly she laughed in her heart what was it he he knew what was in her heart the thoughts and intents of the heart what could do that remember what scripture we read in Hebrews he said the word is a discerner and it was not the other angels who had that gift of discernment it was not those who went down into Sodom but the Lord Capital Lord the king to Abraham and stayed with Abraham was the one who had the gift of discernment it was God in a body brother random talks about he he just blew it off of his hand created himself a body right it was God in flesh and he had a gift of discernment that's what we would call that's what we know it as but it was the word Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart now God does that he does that he does that even while the word is being preached you know he does that still today God does that but not in this manner what this was the reason it was public the reason it was on the platform the reason why he would he would discern the thoughts and intents of the people sitting in front of him was because it would identify the word that's what it was church we we need to grow up and recognize what God's done in our day I believe you have I believe that and so now Simon in John 1 42 and we find that brother random always uses this here Jesus the word is is Discerning the thoughts intents of the heart and he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah and then you'll be called cephas or Peter my interpretation of stone and then Nathanael comes and yeah you've heard brother Brown talk about this many many times but Nathanael comes and and Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said for him behold an Israelite indeed and with whom is no guile and Nathaniel said unto him when SnoWest thou me Jesus answered and said it to him before that Philip called thee when thouest under the Fig Tree I saw thee and watch what Nathanael says Nathanael answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou Art the son of God he identified him as the word and how many know what the son of man is the son of man is the word the son of man is not William Branham the son of man is not it's not some new messenger the son of man is the word that's what a prophet taught us and the son of man revealed himself to the ministry of William Brown so now is now Nathanael comes to him and he sees him in Nathaniel says this is you're the Son of God because he saw it in a vision and he told him the word discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart now what what do you think would have happened if all of the disciples had the gift of discernment and all of them out here operating they could they could cast out devils they could do whatever else that they wanted to do they could have great revivals but they did not have this gift and there's a reason for that because it identified the word no Nathaniel said you're the Son of God brother random says this and I read this last time it's very important he said don't say your pastor or anybody would be taking the gift of discernment your pastor has a right to lay hands on you but I'm not going to stand up here and start taking the gift of discernment and there's a reason for that that's not their calling that's not their calling to do that that's to be one in in the age this was not just a gift and that's what I want to drive in home to you today it's not to reflect on anything else because I'm only responsible for here and I want that to be the case because my brain's not big enough to take care of everybody my gift is not big enough I I want this to come to you today and and for those of you that are here and those of you that are from our church that are watching I'd say this if you're if you want to know the word for yourself what were the random thought about this it's there and I'm trying to give you just a glimpse of that today but there's many many many other quotes the brother Branham deals with this it's not just a gift I want you to understand what brother Brandon's Ministry was I think we lose sight of that sometimes and and there's a reason why and you lose sight of that because some people made it just a cult yeah right when you sit down and you got a picture and you gotta you got a piece of his floor and it's just nothing but a cult it's an idol crafted from the message as brother biscoll so eloquently put it so many years ago just just made themselves a god right and some people did that and yet sometimes when we react to that and and we back away from it so much and we don't realize God did do something in our day yeah God did something in our age there's a reason why we speak about the brown like we do because God revealed himself in that Ministry the word was the discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart and and so there's uh there's got to be something there's got to be something that uh and I heard brother biscoll actually Minister on this about 13 years ago I remember him ministering on I just went back in and found or someone sent me the uh the the video on it because I'd requested it here recently he was preaching about this and he did a really good job I think he called it the age of acceptance but he made the point that but the Brandon was always trying to move the people from The Gift of discernment over to the word because he would say the word is the discerner of the thought put that in the message information pull it up sometime you'll find it over and over and over again the word is a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart and we again we know the son of man is the word and brother Brandon talking about Abraham he said watch what this one did to the church elected Jesus called your attention to the same thing what happened in the last days when the son of man would reveal himself in human flesh the word knowing the secret of the heart you believe he still knows it today he still does but he revealed himself in a special way in this ministry to tell us that he's still a discerner of the thought sentence of the heart he said as it said it's more powerful than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts intense of the heart like all the prophets did like that's how they identified themselves as Prophets right like Jesus did himself you realize that we're under our messenger for the age [Music] I will say this when it comes to our Salvation we're level brother Branham is no different than us no different he doesn't occupy a special place in Salvation but he does occupy a special office and in office there is an order to the office God's not a communist right you have a local Pastor for a reason you can't not everybody can be your pastor right it's just the way that it is and yet yet I want you to benefit from every ministry that's out there but not everybody can be your pastor right not everybody's called with that burden to be able to do that and and the same with with the messenger not everybody can be the messenger there's one Messenger to the age and that's the day that we live in is is that messenger and I'm don't ignore me tonight because you think I'm just lifting up a man I'm not lifting up a man I'm lifting up what the word did in our day yes sir this is the word that we believe everything we do is a result of this message there's no getting around that so now brother Brown says he said it's the word knowing the secret of the heart he said it's more powerful than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts and sins of the heart like all the prophets like Jesus himself was called to be else above and rejected here again in the last days he said but the word and those prophets always was able to foretell and to discern and again you can go you can find dozens and I think there's more than a hundred actually like 170 quotes that say basically the same thing he said the word of those prophets always was able to foretell into discern he said that's the word for that day that's what identified them as Prophets that's what identified them as Prophets and remember he promised that the world would be in that condition would receive that sign again before his coming and so the best of my knowledge I mean think about the gift of discernment and again I'm doing the best I can right because the word's so much bigger than us and I'll always humble myself to that and there's so many men that know so much more than what I would know and I'm not I'm not trying to to just be humble there it's just the truth and so I I'd defer to everybody in every way except for when it comes to the plain truth of the word right because if it's just there I can't deny what the word says right and and I cannot find anywhere where there's a gift that stands reveals the secrets of the hearts except for a word prophet yeah there's just not any other that's not one of the nine spiritual gifts a nice spiritual gift of discernment which is what the Pentecostals thought brother Branham had was the Discerning of spirits to tell between good and evil and to be able to judge between the gifts so that so this was a different kind of discernment this was the sign of the Resurrection God was telling us I'm still alive hey man this he did something he had done now he does many things today that he did when he was on the Earth but this was something specific to a prophet yeah this was something specific to a prophet he still heals the sick he still raises the dead he's still we still have the spiritual gifts we still have all of these things he still does all of those things but this was specific to a prophet because it showed us Christ is is Among Us Again this was the him and his word coming coming in in a form of Son of Man and there's nothing more plain I can see than that now this was the sign of the Resurrection now if that gift could be as I said in anyone it could have been in any of the other disciples then how would the woman at the well know sir I perceive you're a prophet remember that he dealt with her in three different ways he dealt with her he said he dealt with her in the flesh realm get woman get me a drink right he dealt with her in the spirit Realm when he when he discerned the the thoughts the intents of her heart and then he dealt with her in the word realm we've gotten into that before when he when he began to tell her the he began to tell her the word and she said well we're we worship in this mountain and he said but you worship Him in spirit and in truth right and that was we've typed that the first second and third poll and but his body's Soul and Spirit and we we want to be dealt with in a word Realm but he dealt with us first in the second poll in the realm of the spirit and he discerned the spirit and he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart because the word knows the thoughts and intents of the heart and it identified that the word was present in our day that's a big deal church that's a big deal that's happened in our time that the word the same one and spoke to Abraham I'm not talking about William Branham the man I'm talking about the word the word that was with Abraham the word that was in Jesus Christ the word came in our day so now that's how the woman at the well knew now I'm so glad he came to me huh so glad the word is still a discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart and this message when I heard it that came to me that still means something means something to hear the message of the hour that's not hearing it alone is not salvation but there was a seed inside of you that was quickened to it something inside of you couldn't stay away from it something inside of you and interrupted in a new birth and you were born again you were Justified you your life you begin to sanctify your life that all of a sudden you were filled with the baptism the Holy Ghost but what was it the word working all the time because the word is all of that I've preached that to you before you can't separate the word in the spirit the atmosphere always comes with the word and so if we want the atmosphere we need to stay with the word so this is the sign that the wicked and adulterous generation sought after yeah but he said there wouldn't be a sign given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas the resurrection sign this was the sign of the revealing of the son of man Luke 17 30. even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this was the last sign we live in a late hour but the random said remember that sign of discernment is the last message to the Gentile Church he said again he said the next thing is to the Seed of Abraham they're getting their last sign of discernment just like it was in Jesus day that's the last sign to the church he said remember write it down I may be gone see if it's right or not the last biblical sign again he said God changed her body and turned them back it's a mystery that's to be revealed now in this day by the son of man see the evening message what's he talking about this was a mystery we didn't know but here he's talking but the Jeremy about Abraham and Sarah and how Sarah was was changed to a young woman because she goes down and and the King takes her as a wife it's she's an old grandma brother Brown said read between the lines it's a mystery reveal in our day she had a body change she was turned back he said and that was the last sign they seen before she was turned back what's that discernment he said before the change of the body come he said and remember Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived he said how many knows that's true that sign of discernment he said the Royal Seed of Abraham let them hear you let me tell you thus saith the Lord you're receiving your last sign he said that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks that this is the truth he said I trust that you will believe it to be the truth I want to say tonight I believe it but there's always been impersonations of that and again that's just always been the case and I'm thankful in one way that come up the way I did I went to David Terrell's meetings he's gone now but he was a person who believed brother Brandon was a prophet but he was another prophet and he was in the in the Pentecostal Apostolic realm been in his meetings I've been in different people like that used to there's not as many today but uh there were used to there was a bunch of people claiming to have signed the sign of discernment it was out there it was a whole bunch and I've noticed that it's not there anymore like people are getting away from that because it was so uh it was pretty comical actually in some cases because when they tried it was so so vague I remember Richard Roberts getting on the television and telling people someone in my television audience has a backache someone has a headache and I don't mean to make fun of that tonight but that's not what our Prophet did that's not a gift of discernment and maybe a gift of Prophecy could be could be but those things have to be judged right but it couldn't be a gift of discernment like our Prophet had because there's one to an age and it just didn't you watch the results of it now let's look at what a prophet did I want to make this positive that's where because we want to know what a prophet did look brother Brandon said he's talking specifically you know and I took this idea of well someone has a headache let's see how the prophet dealt with that he said the first place he's in discernment he says the woman is leaving me she's leaving me he's having a vision yeah he said I see her at a table she's refusing to eat because she has a stomach trouble she's at a place where there's somebody looking through into her bowels it's a doctor he said and he says she's got something wrong in the colon he calls it a stoppage or a block or something in the colon the doctor did I see it on the paper that he was riding on he said that's right that's the saith the Lord he said there's two of them consulted that he goes on look at the detail of it right there are two of them consulted that two doctors that's where I see two of them he said Do you believe me to be his prophet he said now here's another thing I see someone standing by you it's a child little fellow about 10 years old he's here with you today and suffers with a migraine headache there's your headache so that's right amen now take that handkerchief in your hand lay it on him it'll leave him he said this lady right back here suffering with headache he said God don't let her miss it oh God please miss Morton he didn't just say somebody in the building has a headache watch to see who held their head so Miss Martin believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he healed you from that headache see he wouldn't let her pass by oh I love that he won't let you pass by if there's something for you he'll make sure you get it he said I want to ask you something last night when I spoke to somebody in the building about their headache he said you had a real funny feeling and you was wondering whether that was you or not you know exact the gift is it wasn't her but she was wondering if it was her and the and the word the discerner the thoughts the intents of the heart knew that amen and said he said he was wondering if that was you or not isn't that right he said raise up your hand i'm not reading your mind but I'm telling you what you've been thinking so today he wanted to be sure that it was you he said it'll leave you now your faith has saved you you think God cares about headaches yeah God cares about even the little things in our lives look he said I see a woman I see a woman this is what bro this is what Jesus said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you I see a woman she don't even realize she's got that Faith that's some of you some of you come up for prayer and I know you'll come up and you walk up here and you say brother Ben I just don't have the faith that I need and you don't realize how much Faith you got he said she don't even realize you got that Faith she got that Faith it's a hidden faith she don't even some of you some of us need to ask God Lord help me to access that hidden faith he said she she don't even confess it She's suffering with a headache she don't even confess to have faith but she's suffering with a headache he said she's sitting here looking at me right up here Mrs singer surprised you didn't it glory to God he said now you tell your critics to answer that critics today on the internet will tell you that brother Brown memorized the prayer cards it's nonsense and it's very easily disproved because of the detail and prayer cards were the size of a business card right now look he said you sir now you believe with all your heart we're strangers to each other I've never seen you in my life listen to the level of detail he said I'll tell you now this is the first time you've ever seen me because they say well he memorized it because they came time and time again the same ones most of the people he spoke to had never been in the meeting he made a point of doing that he said you've never been in one of my meetings before this is your first time that's right and you're here suffering with something wrong in your throat you have a stomach trouble I try to discuss on your stomach he said you're nervous you used to have a job that you're ashamed of now now tell me he wrote this on his prayer card you worked at a nightclub you as an Entertainer in a nightclub so glad God don't hold our past against us that's right I said your name is Edge RH Edge is your name you know you can take some of these names and addresses and take them back and find where then people lived yeah on the internet absolutely can these are real people it's not a platform show he said your wife is here with you she's in the meeting if God will tell me what's wrong with your wife will you accept your healing too he said it's her foot that's right correct well it must have been a big prayer card he memorized he said you're not from this city you're from place you're below a big city south of a big city about 25 miles Springfield Illinois he said now go home and receive your healing and be well in the name of the Lord Jesus he said God bless you sir brother Branham I was reading and we're going to show something I'm going to show a clip and do something a little bit different tonight but as they're getting that ready but

Women two black women that stood up there and uh brother Branham uh Point's mother was a white lady that stood up with them I always wondered about that and that lady that stood up with him but you watched how brother Branham corrects that he was talking evidently she had a similar ailment and she was sitting near but brother Brown said the lady behind her and it was the the black lady that was sitting behind her and they responded to the word by shouting about someone else's healing and the angel of the Lord moved back where they were and healed them listen church we don't have to have a special service to have the word present that is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that atmosphere is here just you can just watch that and the atmosphere changes the presence of the Lord is here right now because it builds faith it shows you God was doing something in our day he doesn't have to do that again to get my attention but the random said that the people overseas understood the gift he said the people in America never did he said because they want to see it over and over again he said they'd stop rejoicing he rebuked them for stopping to rejoicing when people were just having hands laid on them they wanted they waited for a discernment and he said that they don't understand it all you have to see it is one time no God is present he's the same yesterday today and forever do we believe that he didn't die in 1965. he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's my God if you say Amen to that tonight amen do you believe him let's stand let's just
