[44:19] were Amen in him was that power to lift
[44:23] us up
[44:26] man and that word mediator
[44:29] is one who ratifies the Covenant and
[44:33] that word ratifies to sign or give
[44:36] formal consent to an agreement making it
[44:40] officially valid amen he makes it valid
[44:43] this morning amen he confirms and
[44:46] approves it he upholds it this morning
[44:49] he's there on the throne upholding amen
[44:52] the Covenant this morning do you believe
[44:54] that
[44:56] amen his blood sitting there with his
[44:58] blood amen he's there to authorize Amen
[45:01] to recognize amen and he has put his
[45:04] name on this Covenant he has signed it
[45:07] with his own blood with his own life he
[45:10] has validated the Covenant that we have
[45:12] with God has been signed with his own
[45:15] blood
[45:18] amen and our thought is kind of being
[45:20] just that what Adam lost Christ came and
[45:24] paid the price at Calvary to redeem us
[45:27] back to that which was lost amen and by
[45:31] the Holy Ghost just our thought that by
[45:33] the Holy Ghost we are sealed until the
[45:36] day of our Redemption it takes the Holy
[45:38] Ghost it's it's more than an emotion
[45:40] it's more than going to church it's more
[45:43] than just living a good life or or
[45:45] living a clean a clean Sanctified life
[45:47] but it takes the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[45:50] and I will bring you to the day of your
[45:52] Redemption that's one that's what we're
[45:54] living under that's what we're
[45:55] worshiping under that token life the
[45:58] literal life of Jesus Christ that by the
[46:01] the fullness of the word not a not a
[46:03] partial word or just a portion of the
[46:05] word but the fullness of the revelation

[46:10] that it releases the fullness of the
[46:12] Holy Ghost the fullness and the power of
[46:14] the token
[46:15] I believe that I believe that's been
[46:18] given to us in this hour that we're not
[46:20] just living under something that'll save
[46:22] us something that'll sanctify us but
[46:25] something that will bring us and seal us
[46:27] to the day of our Redemption amen we've
[46:29] gone far enough in the word now we've
[46:31] been we've received enough of the word
[46:33] that will take us on until the day of
[46:36] redemption there's no going back there's
[46:39] no going back we've come too far we've
[46:41] been given too much amen God is here to

[46:51] promise do you believe that
[46:55] amen
[46:58] so we're coming amen we're coming to the
[47:01] fullness of redemption that's been our
[47:03] thought you know on Calvary he paid the
[47:06] price of redemption but we as the end
[47:08] time people are coming to the fullness
[47:10] of redemption right for were the
[47:13] purchased possession amen he's made he's
[47:15] making Redemption claims he's sitting
[47:18] there on the throne amen he's paid the
[47:20] price amen and we'll get into it later
[47:22] he's waiting on that last one to come in
[47:24] and it's just simple things this morning
[47:26] if he wanted a deep sermon you should
[47:28] have went up to Missouri somewhere went
[47:31] over to a meeting it's going to be
[47:33] simple this morning amen but he's
[47:35] waiting on that last one he can't come
[47:38] off the throne this this morning he
[47:40] can't come off the throne we can't go in
[47:42] the Rapture until that last one has come
[47:44] in
[47:48] so we're we're living in that time of
[47:51] fullness of time a fullness of
[47:53] Redemption where the word has been
[47:55] revealed and we're living amen under the
[47:57] that time of the completion of
[48:00] redemption
[48:02] and he's the mediator
[48:04] he's still the mediator he's still on
[48:06] the throne he's still on the throne amen
[48:09] a mediator of the Covenant of that blood
[48:11] Amen to his predestinate his seed amen

[48:20] goodness his patience his Mercy it's
[48:22] long-suffering and we're having to
[48:24] endure we're having to live under that
[48:26] long suffering but you know what God
[48:28] waited on you and me He it may have
[48:31] taken years and years you know and
[48:33] there's been others before us that have
[48:34] waited and they've waited but we're
[48:36] still waiting we're still waiting on
[48:38] that last one because God's mercy
[48:40] amenity he's patient he endures
[48:43] right amen he'll not lose a one
[48:48] he'll not lose a one
[48:50] amen his Mercy endures forever
[48:53] amen he he'll not leave one behind he'll
[48:56] not lose the one amen God is here to
[48:59] stick this thing out Amen to finish this
[49:01] thing up amen that until that last one
[49:03] comes in
[49:06] God God is determined to save man
[49:10] God is determined and he'll not lose one
[49:13] seed he'll not lose one son or daughter
[49:18] amen God is determined to say man I
[49:20] believe this morning I believe that God
[49:22] is determined to bring us to the
[49:24] finishing of redemption amen into a
[49:27] Rapture amen he has given himself he has
[49:30] paid that price
[49:33] we read here but just look at the
[49:35] mediator just for just for a minute
[49:38] the cross identified in the same in all
[49:40] generations he said and when that last
[49:43] one is saved there will not be an extra
[49:45] one it'll just be so many and when that
[49:48] last one is brought in the body of
[49:50] Christ has completed the Rapture will
[49:52] come he said no so we're longing for
[49:54] that day to get out of this place where
[49:56] we're here at now for certainly a pest
[49:59] house we know that full of sickness and
[50:01] disease and disappointments and trouble
[50:03] and my who would want to stay here when
[50:06] there's such a better place to go to he
[50:08] said well so we're trying to get every
[50:10] soul saved so that Jesus can come and it
[50:13] cannot come unto that last one as her
[50:15] name on The Book of Life that was put
[50:17] there before the foundation of the world
[50:19] that when that name is called that's the
[50:22] last one he came to redeem to bring back
[50:24] and redeem is to bring back when he
[50:27] brings that last one he's sitting at the
[50:29] right hand of God tonight doing his
[50:31] mediatorial work and when that last soul
[50:33] is saved that was redeemed and seen and
[50:36] known by God before the foundation of
[50:38] the world when that last one's that last
[50:40] solar saved that closes the book it's
[50:44] over it's finished
[50:45] redemption's over
[50:47] it's over it's finished
[50:49] hey man you're just counting down the
[50:51] moments
[50:52] you're just counting down the moments
[50:54] that will go in the Rapture right
[50:57] so we're living under that time we're
[50:58] living amen where the book is about to
[51:01] be closed Where Mercy will be over right
[51:04] aren't you thankful that we've received
[51:06] Mercy this morning this whole world is
[51:09] under judgment amen though those that
[51:11] have rejected the message rejected God
[51:13] rejected whatever God they can know amen
[51:16] they're living under that judgment amen
[51:18] but we've received Mercy in this hour
[51:19] when you receive the word for your day
[51:21] you receive that Mercy when you accepted
[51:24] it when you didn't refuse it you
[51:26] accepted that Mercy that's what it was
[51:28] to you
[51:31] amen we're living on we're living under
[51:33] Redemption we're living under mercy here
[51:35] this morning
[51:36] amen
[51:39] let's look at Adam here
[51:41] and what what Christ has redeemed us
[51:43] back to amen so he's he's the mediator
[51:46] this morning he's the mediator of the
[51:48] Covenant amen and he brother Branham
[51:51] says here in Jehovah Jireh he says now I
[51:52] want you to notice when God made his
[51:55] first Covenant the Adam Covenant the
[51:57] adamant Covenant he made it between him
[52:00] and Adam and man turned around and broke
[52:02] his Covenant and every time that man
[52:05] makes a covenant with God he breaks it
[52:07] and he goes on he said and Adam and
[52:10] every man here is based on uh free moral
[52:13] agency God put within man the spirit of
[52:17] free moral agency to either accept it or
[52:21] refuse life
[52:22] to accept life or refuse not to either
[52:24] accept his provided way or take your own
[52:27] idea
[52:29] to accept his allotted word for your day
[52:31] I reject the message for the age that
[52:33] you live in
[52:34] and so God won't force you to do
[52:37] anything
[52:38] amen but God also is not willing that
[52:40] anyone should perish he wants all to
[52:43] come back to him amen but he knows who
[52:46] will and who won't
[52:49] and so because of his foreknowledge
[52:52] Brothers goes on and say he can make
[52:54] everything work according to his plan
[52:55] God knows who are his
[52:57] you believe that amen he knows those
[53:00] whose names are in the last book of life
[53:02] and they will come to life I Believe In
[53:04] Spite amen sometimes in spite of their
[53:07] free moral agency and then their own
[53:09] decisions and their own wrong decisions
[53:11] they will come to life
[53:16] Adam even in spite of his decisions he
[53:19] was still a son of God
[53:21] he calls it all him and he calls it all
[53:24] amen but they didn't they didn't go away
[53:26] into judgment and and just complete
[53:28] condemnation where they were Sons and
[53:30] Daughters of God God had to make a way
[53:32] for him amen
[53:34] so God ever remains faithful to his seed
[53:38] amen oh how he looked he looked beyond
[53:41] our faults amen he looked beyond our
[53:43] faults and and US refusing him no no
[53:46] doubt for years after years amen but he
[53:49] he kept calling it's because God's not
[53:51] willing that any should perish God's not
[53:53] going to lose a one amen so he'll he'll
[53:56] go on he'll he'll send a preacher after
[53:59] preacher a sermon after sermon tug after
[54:02] tug he'll sin every little every little
[54:04] bit of of love that he can to you
[54:07] through the word amen through through
[54:09] the the Believers around him amen his
[54:11] voice speaking to you amen through this
[54:13] day amen that word calling out to you
[54:16] telling you that your son or daughter of
[54:18] God telling you that you're different
[54:20] but you'll ignore it for years and years
[54:22] sometimes
[54:24] but it's God's mercy that he won't lose
[54:26] a horn and he won't lose a one amen
[54:29] you'll refuse it you'll refuse it but
[54:31] there'll come a time there'll come a
[54:33] predestinated time where you can't
[54:34] refuse it no more amen where God will
[54:37] come down in his Saving Grace amen by
[54:40] the Holy Ghost and he'll come down and
[54:42] he'll save you
[54:43] he'll feel you he'll clean your life up
[54:46] he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and
[54:48] only God can do that the preacher can
[54:50] preach about it Mom and Daddy can tell
[54:52] you about it but only God can come down
[54:54] and do that amen but you've got to open
[54:56] your life up to him
[55:01] amen
[55:04] amen
[55:06] Amen to live for him
[55:08] Amen to live for him in this in this age
[55:10] to live a Christian life amen amen it's
[55:13] the only way of life there is for for
[55:15] the believer amen it's the only only way
[55:18] there is
[55:23] remember he couldn't lose us
[55:25] and then so he's sitting there on on the
[55:28] throne now he still won't lose a one
[55:30] no matter how lost your loved ones are
[55:33] no matter how how bad it seems
[55:36] how much they've rejected how much
[55:38] they've refused if they're a child of
[55:40] God they'll have to come to it
[55:43] amen I believe that
[55:46] God is still expressing himself
[55:49] as a savior as a redeemer
[55:52] amen I believe I believe there's still
[55:54] Mercy don't you that's what Believers
[55:56] believe
[55:57] Amen in 1965 is this all right
[56:01] because God changed his mind
[56:03] he said not to be a savior there has to
[56:05] be something lost and God cannot
[56:07] purposely lose anything and then
[56:09] redeemeth it wouldn't be becoming to his
[56:11] Holiness and his great judgment but he
[56:13] put man on free moral agency knowing
[56:15] that man would fall in that then he be
[56:18] he became man himself in order to redeem
[56:21] man back that fell amen that's the
[56:24] reason Jesus was Emmanuel if God sent
[56:27] another person besides himself then he
[56:29] wouldn't be just amen God had to come to
[56:32] himself and take place
[56:35] and God cannot come down in spirit and
[56:38] take place he had to be made flesh and
[56:41] in that flesh of his own created son
[56:43] amen so it took a God man to redeem man
[56:48] back to God
[56:49] man lost in the beginning and it would
[56:52] take a man to get it back for you and I
[56:54] it would take the man cross Jesus amen
[56:57] God had a law and then he had a law that
[56:59] you had to have a Kinsmen Redeemer
[57:01] something was lost if an estate was lost
[57:03] it took that Kinsman amen amen it took
[57:07] that kids when that was God's law amen
[57:09] and we and we we had a sacrifice amen
[57:12] those through through time they had a
[57:14] sacrifice of that blood of that old
[57:16] sacrifice but it wasn't enough to bring
[57:18] them back it was only foreshadowing amen
[57:20] of that of that blood of that
[57:22] all-sufficient created blood that would
[57:24] come in the sun amen and it would be
[57:26] spilled on Calvary Amen in that life
[57:28] would be released back to the believer
[57:29] or what a memorial that is this morning
[57:32] amen that God would send back his life
[57:34] send back his holy ghost amen it is
[57:37] still Memorial this morning amen God's
[57:39] life amen the Holy Ghost
[57:42] his life
[57:43] ever present amen they're available for
[57:46] you and I
[57:48] mean in a took a Kinsmen it took one
[57:51] that would come and live and breathe as
[57:53] a man overcome as a man amen live but it
[57:56] would it would take God coming down in
[57:58] that flesh it would be no less than God
[58:00] but it would be it would be a God man a
[58:03] perfect man that would come and shed his
[58:05] blood amen and that life would come back
[58:08] upon you and I
[58:09] on the believer
[58:12] amen so a man lost it and it would take
[58:16] a man to get it back amen aren't you
[58:18] thankful for that man in Christ Jesus
[58:20] this morning amen he left his he left
[58:23] his lofty lofty hearts and come down and
[58:25] dwelt among men such as you and I
[58:29] you love him this morning

[58:57] a man
[58:58] and he came and defeated every sickness
[59:00] every devil as a man and he didn't use
[59:03] his power but he used the power of the
[59:06] word amen and it showed that it didn't
[59:09] take a great a great person it didn't
[59:11] take just just the fullness of power but
[59:15] if he got just a little bit of the Holy
[59:17] Ghost

[59:28] showed us how to overcome as a man he
[59:31] showed us Amen to take the word amen and

[59:35] defeat sickness it would defeat every
[59:37] enemy on any grounds

[59:45] it this morning

[59:49] my soul amen though the devil try to try
[59:52] to bring it down this morning

[1:02:27] it's not an eternal Covenant because
[1:02:29] Redemption amen when the fullness of
[1:02:32] redemption comes will no longer need
[1:02:34] that blood
[1:02:35] but while we need it it's an everlasting
