Lord Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me God but I just want to say that your grace that saved me is amazing but it's only became more amazing every day that I've served you

just want to say that thank you again trust that the word was a blessing to you amen this morning that the Lord said something to you that encouraged you amen but I hope you got empty cups today this evening hope you say Lord I Want More amen how many say that Lord I Want More believe he he has more for you Amen brother Brandon said that's that's just proof that he's got more if you want more and so I I believe that the preaching of the word of God can change lives you know just at the preaching of the word of God God is the Bible calls it the foolishness of preaching I've often thought it's because I'm a I'm just an imperfect person just like you are but somehow if I can get myself out of the way then God can edify Somebody by that imperfect clay amen and it's fullish sounding but it's the way that God ordained amen he ordained men to be vessels Amen brother B brother bandam even said that the voice of man would be the transmitter for the voice of God and so you can you can hear the voice of a man but I want to hear the voice of my father amen I just want to hear his voice amen before we read maybe we'll just bow our heads together maybe if you just have a need you just want to uplift a hand raise a hand and say Lord I'm going to represent my need here tonight I just wonder if at this moment we could just bind our faith together Lord Jesus I raise my hand up God with all of these hands Lord that are raised you see the need represented here tonight some Lord Jesus even hear sicken body Lord but yet they're here at their post of Duty we ask God that you'd give them a Special Touch tonight Lord God May healing from Jehovah come and Quicken their body even their mortal body Lord Jesus healing is the children's bread Lord and that means it's our inheritance God I pray Lord for every need that's represented in this church Lord in the in the in the families Lord in the Ministries and the God I know that there's many needs Lord Jesus I pray that you would just meet them Lord in your way for father only in your way Lord that's the best way I pray God that you would help us Lord God tonight may we just Lord just focus in on what you want us to hear Lord Jesus and we'll be careful to give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen uh this is Ruth chapter 1 we'll just begin reading I'm just going to read a few verses and then we'll um we will have you be seated I'd like to just continue on from where we were this morning and uh just carry that over and I'm going to set my my one hour timer I don't have a 45 minute timer brother Joel I'm sorry but I do have a 1 hour timer and so um we'll try to they said I cut into my my 1 hour for tonight so I only got 45 minutes so man y'all are worse than my people back home I'm just kidding I'm just kidding well the pastor told me to take my Liberty tonight amen he didn't say it like brother Frasier who would say brother you take your Liberty for about 60 minutes so he just told me to have my Liberty and so I want the Lord to have his Liberty amen I know that you uh I know that you feel the same way that I do amen let's just pick this up here again in verse one of Ruth chapter 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judea went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons the name of the man was IMC and his and the name of his wife Naomi and the two of his sons Mayon and chilion now notice how we know the story and I don't won't read the entire chapter but we know that these two men died and the Bible says in verse six then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was notice she had to leave where she was right and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return into the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her two granddaughters in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord de deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of view in the house of her husband then she kissed them and lifted up their voice and wept and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I'm too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you T for them would you would you T for them till they were grown the Bible says in verse 14 they lift up their voice and wept and orpa kissed her mother-in-law I love this but Ruth clave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and into her Gods return after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and whether thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my god notice and I just want to pick up one more thing before you're seated and he says in verse 20 and she said unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again now remember who the prophet tells us Naomi represents the Orthodox Jewish church right and so the prophet shows us that this is Naomi representing the Jewish church and Ruth representing the Gentile bride right and notice he says here you shall not call me for I went out full and the Lord ha brought me home again empty why then call you call me Naomi seeing that the Lord has testified again me against me and the almighty hath Afflicted me so Naomi returned and Ruth the moabitas her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley Harvest Lord we just ask you to bless your word one more time father may God you have your way in all things we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated notice the scripture here is that Bible says that they returned at Barley Harvest brother bham says so many things that you could look at and and we don't have time to teach on the entire story but if you just look at the story it's a story with so many types and lessons between Naomi and Ruth it's a book about a woman who gleaned and truly there's so much that you could lean out of this one little book that's right and so what you've Minister when we see this story and we preached on it today on the the the uh called out of judges and into Ruth and showed that how that these two books of judges and Ruth were actually originally bound together they were one book and you picked that up when you read the first verse and it says in the time of the judges and so you know that just as in the Book of Judges the people had gotten away from the law of Moses and judges and R that that you found there we read that today in Leviticus and now there becomes a cycle a constant Circle that just repeats over and over and the pattern of Judges is much like that roundabout you know the roundabout and I don't know if you have those here do you'all have roundabouts and traffic circles we got a lot of them back home you know the purpose of the roundabout brother Joel is to get off of the roundabout unless you're not from there and and and and you just go around and around and wondering what you do but you know it's funny but really that's how a lot of people live their life that they go around and around and around and around and after a while you get dizzy and wonder who am I what am I where am I going what's happening in my life but the message of Ruth is to get off of that roundabout and get onto the path of redemption you see in contrast to a cycle Ruth Story is all about a purpose if you could just turn me up here only on the left side is fine it's a life with a purpose because it's a line in fact it's a royal line and it's not a cycle it's actually a circle it's actually a line it's a romance in so many ways and the prophet of God says this that the Bible is a love story picks this up in kinsman redeemer and he talks about this that how that this was a romance B between Christ and his bride and in that story of Ruth you have that great story of redemp Redemption it shows the kindness of this one man who we know is a type of Our Redeemer Boaz who would take upon himself this moabit woman and Ruth and all that belonged to her notice he didn't just take her but he took everything that belonged to her and so everything that was attached to her he took with him and he redeemed every single bit of it and so brother Barham would use this story of redemption and Ruth and he would he would he would use that to preach his message the Kinsman redeem rer took this out of Naomi being a type of that Orthodox Jewish church and Ruth being a type of the Gentiles and how that this woman Ruth should have as we said never been in this story uh or in even really in the pages of the Bible but now somehow we know the story of Ruth very well in fact it's read every year at the Feast of Pentecost the Jews read the story of Ruth because it it she took such an imprint in history that her name is forever mentioned in the story of redemption and the lineage of Christ friends just think about how much grace that God has given you in your life that you could have been here on a Sunday night sitting on a bar stool somewhere some of you could have been down at the Baptist Church and maybe just cut getting out of you know uh who knows where you could have been who knows where we all would have been but somehow God has called you out of the denominations of men and out of all things listen when The Voice voice of God cried out in this generation in Revelation 17:3 it was to say come out of her come out of her my people you say out of what out of everything come out of anything the devil's put on you it's not just a coming out of a denominational idea that's wonderful but come out of any of your old ideas come out of any of your old patterns come out of any of your old habits come out of any of your old sins out of your old thinking when when when real Redemption takes place friends it's a brand new day it's a brand new life it's a brand new chance it's a it's a brand new story and God saying I don't want you to carry anything over from judges it's a brand new life and so we know that she was a stranger so much of this was how that Ruth the moabit was a stranger from the promises of God but somehow in her life God comes down and decides to rewrite her entire history and she finds herself with Naomi married to her son and then we know the story how that the son dies and and and then you see death and it's even a type you say brother Matt what is that the prophet tells us it's a type of Israel because he says I I left I came out full but now I I left full but now I'm coming back empty and the prophet tells us that that was a type of the the Orthodox Jewish Church of how that Naomi being a type how that she left she was left a widow and without a husband right hell you say who is she widowed from Jehovah and and how that she has two sons and those two sons are going to die much like Israel would be split into two kingdoms between Jobo and rabo and and and it's it's a perfect type all the way through this the prophet of God says this it's a book of Prophecy it speaks perfectly and so it shows how that she would have these two sons and and how the kingdom would be split into two and and and and how that how that through the the two sons Judah and Benjamin and how that death would happen in Canaan as we read about this morning and it was all typed here in this little story of Ruth we find that Ruth was just a nobody but she finds herself gleaning in the right field one day she made the right choice you say how did she end up there brother Matt cuz she made a clear-cut decision to not leave the word and the prophet of God said God doesn't want some jellyfish spineless no backbone don't know where to take a stand listen friends this is the age that you live to where everybody's afraid to really make a stand I'm not talking about a political stand that's nonsense I'm not talking about call coming up for some cause to rebel against but I'm talking about taking a stand for Jesus sir and everybody in this age is so wishy-washy that everybody's afraid to make a stand or really afraid to offend anybody you got to be in this age you got to be so careful how you say things and careful how you present it you know careful you don't walk on anybody's toes or I watched the man I'm not criticizing him he was a a good old you know a preacher of a of a massive church and it was somewhere in California you know he's probably a good man but he's up there behind his pull pit and he's he's so careful he wants to give a message to the transgender community and he's being so careful how he says it and you could tell the pressure he's under him and he's just trying to word it right and not not say it wrong and he's got I couldn't imagine brother to be honest I couldn't imagine he got thousands of people and there's 10,000 people you know they're streaming and they're in front of his church and he's careful and he's watching and and I just thought man thank God I'm not some hirling who has to be careful and preach what I preach or say what I say but to not offend anybody or hurt anybody's feelings or listen friends let me say like brother Bram said I was nobody uh before I found God and I'm still nobody today but I'm in God's hands and so it doesn't matter you say brother Matt what are you interested in I'm interested in preaching the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and I just say let the chips fall where they may I think we got to get back to preaching the word of God in spite of what other people think cuz you live in a world he was so careful how he danced over it and said it and he finally you could tell he he finally just breaks and says I just want to say we love you transgender people man the place just goes into a a Roar and and and you know and just Applause you can feel just everybody taking a deep breath and I thought you know what can I just say something feelings are overrated can I just say that put that on a t-shirt feelings are overrated that's right people care so much about everybody hurting everybody's feelings let me just say this to you my brother my sister this Bible was never written to to to to you know to soothe your feelings oh I'm going to preach anyway I said this Bible was never meant to be acceptable by the masses it was never meant to be re you know just just to you know to patty cake with or listen this is the most controversial book that's ever been written in existence and it didn't care about your feelings my feelings the world's feelings it's it's never made or written to be popular or accepted by people and let me just go ahead and preach further we don't need to dress this message up and try to make it more palpable for our people to hear or make it more cultured or or more refined it's always come to the ignorant and the unlearned and I just say thank God that God didn't have to come to me at some kind of intellectual way but he brother Ram said he doesn't come to the mind that's the devil's Battleground but God chose the heart of a man and when the word uh reaches the heart it doesn't bring reference to your life brother it brings transformation by the blood of Jesus and a man can walk out a sinner and walk out of that church Born Again of the spirit of God I say that's the kind of preacher that we need a a word that changes the life but you know what happens is is that we get so politically correct do you know that this is the spirit on this age that actually it would come upon this generation to where people would be so care the Bible tells you tells us this way that they would Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears that they couldn't endure sound Doctrine it's actually a prophecy of this generation that you live in today and my brother my sister look around you it's exactly where we're at everybody's trying to make it more acceptable or more reasonable you know you got to really say it that way you really got to say everything brother bham said I mean come on brother Matt I had a brother tell me that he said really brother Matt when are we going to stop saying brother brandham said I said what do you mean when are we go come on Paul said you know what you don't one of sephus and one of Apollos are you not carnal when we going to stop quoting a prophet and I said brother you told the wrong preacher that he said do we really got to say you know brother brandham said I said all right brother let me go to the Bible you know it was funny cuz when Jesus was here Jesus would say over and over that it might be fulfilled the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet when John the Baptist came on the scene he said behold I am he of who it is spoken by the prophets one crying in the wilderness when the Apostle Paul you look at what Peter Peter quoted prophets Jesus quoted prophets John quoted prophets I think you know what I'm going to say I say if they could quote a prophet I should be able to identify myself with the [Applause] prophet and you say brother Matt what what are you trying to say today I'm trying to say that it's not the time to be wishy-washy with the rest of the world and wishy-washy it's time to make a clearcut decision and say I'll not leave you I'll stay right here beside you because it would be this age that would be the age of selflove you know Jesus prophesied that and said that men would be lovers of their own self that's right I guess we all get in the mirror and go boy look at me I just no I that's not what it is you say brother Matt what does it mean to be a lover of your own self when you take your thought and exalted above the knowledge of the word that's right and people don't sit there in the mirror and look at at least I hope they don't look at themselves and think of how good they look but it's an exaltation of men's Minds in fact it would be in this age that don't you realize my brother brother my sister it is the world that you live in not your CH not listen it's the world that your children are growing up in right now is the Advent of technology and it's on an ever increasing Pace like never before it doesn't take things to come to full maturity as many years as it used to right now it happens overnight it took years for the smartphone 20 some odd years to be where it's at today but look at what's happening now with artificial intelligence overnight now they have videos that aren't real people that aren't real nothing's real it's all just generated artificial intelligence say well where where where you going with that I'm going to tell you the prophet of God told us in countdown that everything that man achieves by education it's only a type of what God's doing in the Unseen World spiritually go come on somebody that's what the prophet taught us that it was under the it was that that Discovery you know it must have been a powerful thing when they discovered the will you know I don't think it's that powerful of a discovery but I guarantee you you ride you walk around and walk from one side when they discovered the wheel buddy I guarantee it was a Revival cuz now they didn't have to walk everywhere they could ride on the wheel and brother bham said notice when they discovered the automobile engine and he said what was it it was a type of what God was doing in the natural it was only showing you what was taking place in the spiritual and about the time they were discovering the automobile engine Luther was preaching a message of the just shall live by faith and you know that you know brother Ram said beyond that you know you go from the you go from the the horse and buggy I'm sorry and then the automobile under Wesley sanctification message and then the prophet said but science didn't stop there why cuz God wasn't going to stop there either and brother bam says and about the time that they were learning the right Brothers in North Carolina were getting off of the ground he said there was a little group in isua Street in California and he said about that time they were getting off of the ground and what was it they were not Earthbound creatures anymore but they were getting up into the Heavenly atmosphere looking at Earth from a whole different view sir that's the thing that's so awesome about that airplane man you get up there and the world looks like a completely different place I didn't know that was there I didn't know that was there I didn't know how close that was together but you get up in a higher elevated View and what was that isua street Pentecost the prophet of God said it was the restoration of gifts it was a work of that wheat that wheat plant that that that was in restoration it wasn't true Pentecost but brother vam said it was a furthering of that work of restoration but I'm going to tell you what man didn't stop there because God wasn't going to stop there and the prophet of God said but God has not called you to be just in an automobile he hasn't called you just to be in a jet aircraft he said but this is the age of the as asut and he said now we we went beyond the the the atmosphere we went beyond the stratosphere and now we're spiritual astronauts you know the thing I love about an astronaut is when an astronaut sits in that rocket ship he's not no longer looking around like this his eyes are looking straight up I guarantee you that man sitting on the USS space station right now he don't care what Fox News says he don't care he didn't care when they were when covid was going on he was a thousand miles away from all of that you see what happens when you disconnect from this world all of your cares get disconnected with it and you don't look at the world different you don't look at the world the same you don't look at your problems the same you don't look at your struggles the same come on somebody help me preach tonight you don't look at the you don't look at the issues that seem so ult right now when you get in that astronaut spaceship and you take off it doesn't matter what's happened yesterday it doesn't matter what's going to happen tomorrow or in the election cycle of this year I've already in my spaceship and I'm going to go beyond the Milky Way I'm going to say goodbye to this world you look at your problems totally different and so the prophet of God said what was it it was you say brother Matt did we stop there well no actually we didn't stop there either because now you look at the age where you're in now it's not even just the age of the astronaut but now it's the age of intelligence brother shared this with me just just the other day pastor and and he sent me this a brother in his church at Senate and he said brother I put into the to the search query of this Gemini this artificial intelligence large language model and he said I just put in there give me the what was the point of brother bram's sermon Christ is the mystery of God reveal build man what it spit out was more laid out better laid out better said than any preacher probably could have ever said it showed you that it doesn't a true gift or calling of the anointing of God is not just the ability to line up this and line up that and it was so perfect it was paragraphs about man taking that 4our sermon and it put it down in such an order couldn't have you say brother Matt what do you believe well I'm just going to tell you what brother bham said in Christ is revealed in his own word brother bham says then it started right back coming back to the church the church come from the feet coming up now it's the head the head time notice the light you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see with your ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks that was the Pentecostal age but now now come on it's the eye time the seeing Time come on come on what was that c and age it was a prophet with prophetic Vision let me tell you something friends you'd be lost without a prophet's Vision I would be too I said you would be lost without a prophetic Insight even brother Brandon that was that Prophet was typed as a Watchman on the wall and that Watchman on the wall listen friends that watchman's job you know what he stood there the wall his job wasn't to wait for the enemy to be right at the castle wall and go hey guys we got to get ready they're putting ladders up here that wasn't a true Watchman but a true watchman's gift was that he had the prophetic insight to see the enemy coming from a long ways away and then he any old dummy could sit up on the wall and tell you the problem when it's at your doorstep but it takes a prophet to look at not the fruit but the seed you see anybody could take an apple and an orange and tell you it's an apple and an orange but let me give you the seeds and then you identify what it is and I'm so thankful that God sent a prophet with prophetic Insight you say why would brother Baron preach against I Love Lucy it seems so harmless I tell you why because he wasn't preaching against the fruit you say what is the fruit I tell you the fruit is what Hollywood is producing today but he was identifying as a Watchman the seed and said kick that thing out of your home don't feed on it it's modern day Babylon why because the filth you see today oh my brother my sister I'm so glad that there was a prophet in this generation who identified not the seed not the fruit but the seed of the matter but brother said what was it it was prophetic eyes eyes to see that's right and he says that was the Pentecostal age but he says now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye yeah so beyond the prophetic Vision notice the next thing is the intelligence oh yeah which is Christ himself who controls the whole body oh yes he says see down through the age we started from the foundation the first age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed then it come through the feet Luther come back out through Wesley then into the Pentecostals or tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and now there's nothing else left to come but for him himself glory to God and he say because the last thing that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence brother there ain't nothing this message missed I tell you that I'll say it again there ain't nothing that this message missed you say that ain't in the message that's cuz only because you're only seeing it from an intellectual standpoint when you see through the eyes of Revelation you realize that this message didn't miss anything listen to me my brother my sister it's seen us and this generation that we're living in of modern-day men and the world that's falling apart the prophet of God says the next thing is the elligence and we have no intelligence of our own we have no sight of our own either brother inide of outside of prophetic sight we'd be blind and groping in darkness with the rest of the world how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself and he's governed the body all the way through the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of the Bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning yes sir yes sir and notice what brother Adam shows as I showed you in countdown it was only what man was doing in the natural God was doing in the Supernatural yesy good and do you realize my brother my sister this is where we stand today oh did you notice that even it was Ruth who came into the land the Bible says at the beginning of the barley Harvest how many has has seen that before for it's real clear right here in the message brother bham actually takes that and shows you he says I don't have time maybe someone he said there's some really says it to the effect of there's some really good nuggets in there because brother Ram knew that there was a key there that when Ruth comes at the beginning of barley Harvest because remember this is the age of where the the brother bandam said that under the blowing of that six trumpet because remember brother bandam shows us in Feast of the trumpets that what the trumpets are to Israel were the seals to the Gentiles that's right and so brother bam says that everything you say brother Matt why is the world going crazy everybody's lost their mind man doesn't as we said a man doesn't know what a man is anymore and I tell you what friends that's a sad situation you say how did that happen just happen you know just just because of the El the politicians and we need to get Trump in there that won't do a bit of good come on listen I that may you may not like that but I'm just going to go ahead and say it putting Trump in there won't do a bit of good brother baram said I'll put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on every corner and it wouldn't turn this thing around say are you not looking to Trump I am I'm looking to the last Trump that's the Trump I'm wanting to hear notice here he says that notice at that because the world's going crazy you say a man doesn't know what a man is it doesn't know a bathroom to use I'll tell you why cuz the prophet of God had seven visions and if you go and look at the fifth vision of of brother brandham he tells you he prophesies where trans the transgender movement was only a fruit of the seed he was identifying when he cried out against women getting out of their place and brother bam says the man now wants to wear her clothes and she wants to wear his clothes prophet of God said I seen in that fifth Vision the moral plight of all Humanity that centered mostly around women now I'm not talking about a son daughter of God born of the Holy Ghost you are the greatest crown and Jewel in the kingdom of God but brother bam says a woman out of her place is the greatest weapon in the hands of the devil and brother man says it's centered mostly around women when he gave them the right to vote they cut off their hair and the brother said to show she was outside of her headship that's what he was identifying and I Love Lucy was the man was made to look like a dummy just a baboon just an idiot and the woman was put over top of the man listen friends you might not like it but I love it I love every I this this to me is the only thing that makes sense this makes the world I tell you what the message of the hour does to me it makes the world make sense it makes my life make makes sense too that's right and he says I seen them as she got out of her place and brother Bon points to that and says it was the moral downfall of the entire world because of that woman getting out of her place and now he says now she wants to wear his clothes the pants and he wants to wear her clothes the shorts I know it's not popular to preach on shorts anymore but Jesus said oh you fools and slow of heart to believe hello you mean there are certain people who only believe some of the prophets what the prophets said I happen to be one of those who believe all that the prophets have spoken Hallelujah and brother bam says any old man that'll put on those shorts in public is nothing more than a man I would hide behind this pull pit but there's glass there and you'd see me anyway but you say brother Matt why is it important because I'm showing you that the world you live in didn't just accidentally get here it didn't just happen to be 2024 it wasn't a president or a bad president or a good president it was a prophecy on because of Vindicated Prophet stood and said I prophesy to you in the name of the Lord this world will go completely insane and they will lose their minds and they don't even realize it that the very things they are feeding on is causing them to go insane sir because a prophet prophesied and you know brother brandham links that fourth dimension Spirit to those spirits that were bound at the river Euphrates yes he and the prophet of God says notice he says under that sick seal right because remember that sick seal is the Tribulation seal right that's right and it has a perfect fulfillment in time say brother Matt are we in the tribulation no we're not how do you know cuz I'm still here yes sir and when you get a revelation you'll realize real quick we ain't in it cuz I'm still here but brother bham says in the Feast of the trumpets that when that seal was broken and he says there in Revelations 9 youve go study that in Revelations 9 there was 200 million imagine that that's right 200 million demons standing at the river Euphrates if you ever go there into J to the land of Judea you can even look at it on a map you're going to find three rivers that came out of Eden the Nile the Euphrates and The Tigress River and if you ever ever look between the Tigers and the Euphrates that come up from the uh you know from the uh down over the Golan Heights into the land of Judea that what's on the other side of the Euphrates River naturally is Israel that's right and between those two rivers the Tigers and the Euphrates is a land called Mesopotamia where Abraham leaves and actually that's what meso means between bamia the two rivers and Abraham comes out of there's where he starts his journey right where the Jews start their Journey when he leaves her the Chans and moves into the Fertile Crescent into the land of Judea and the prophet of God said that 200 million demons were held at the river and they couldn't cross and brother bham says that those Spirits wanted to cross the river to persecute the Jews I'll tell you what Spirit those Hamas October 7th Fighters were under that's right they might not have realized it but they were under the demons at the river Euphrates that were released from that and I tell you what brother every one of these protesters and the colleges and the schools and the professors they might not realize it but they're under an anointing they're under a demonic spirit and brother bam says that they stood there on the River of Euphrates wanting to cross over they were held Revelations 9 says that they were held for a certain C hour a certain day a certain moment like Jude says they were reserved in the Blackness of Ashes until the day of judgment that's right in other words this this was not some random happening but God in history had a specific moment at a specific date at a specific hour that these 200 million Chargers demon Chargers would be released from that River and brother bham says that at the opening of that sick seal now we're not in the tribulation with the prophet of God if you follow it closely shows us that at the opening of that seal it released a pre-tribulation that's right or an amateur tribulation anointing and he says and those Spirits got on men like Hitler and Stalin and ikan and musolini come on hello they didn't even realize it brother sister do you realize Hitler didn't even realize it the people couldn't comprehend it but he leads an entire country you go back and you got artificial intelligence you can go back and hear Hitler's I'll call them sermons because that's what they were and they've now taken the voice of Adolf Hitler and they' put it in the English language but in his vocal in his tone it'll send shivers down your spine and they didn't realize it that his his words were anointing an entire country you see words have the power to become weapons right right I said words have the power to become weapons and the prophet of God says that Hitler under that pre- amateur tribulation under that amateur tribulation that God on Hitler and and melini and ikan brother bam says they were released naturally to the Jews but ecclesiastically to the church and brother Ram says released upon who the Jews and upon the bride so it would be twofold a natural releasing but also a spiritual releasing of ecclesiastical Devils you say what kind of devils cold Devils formal Devils dead Devils dead worship dead Church dead people who would try to remove the blood out of the church oh the prophet of God says when you remove the blood you're an anemic Church listen to me my brother my sister if we stop preaching the blood of Jesus our churches are just Lodges of good groups of people I say give me a blood give me the blood of the word of God an atonement that atones for my sins yes sir prophet of God said when you take the spirit of God out of Samson he was just any by any other man when you remove the spirit of God out of Israel they were like any other nation and when you take the spirit of God out of the message of the hour and you remove it from our churches the prophet said the church is nothing but the world with the name of God attached to it I say God give me the real word give me a blood give me a token God give me that literal Life of Christ wonderful yeah and the prophet of God said that notice those Spirits wanted to attack and he says but at that moment they were released you say where were they released to brother man the fourth dimension you say where is the fourth dimension brother Matt well let me me show you where the fourth dimension is cuz this is the dimension of Science and brother bam says in this room right now there's pictures and and remember this and he says there's pictures in this room can you see them can you hear them he said the voices of radio and he says but can you hear them no all you need is a transmitter and he says you put the right device down and it will only emulate or transmit what was already in the air oh my brother when you ever catch a revelation that if there's demons I've got to believe that there's also angels and ministering Spirits oh if there's a demon that can take over someone's life what about a holy ghost Hallelujah you say brother Matt where's it at it's here right now all it needs is a transmitter to say move on me oh God yes sir and brother bam says that those Spirits got on men like Stalin ikan melini Hitler and they didn't realize it they were under a six seal pre-tribulation anointing you see brother bam says that that six seal comes in threefolds it's a purging to the church the foolish virgin it's a purging to the 144,000 and it will also Purge the Earth and brother mam said it purges the fullest virgin for rejecting the message and their sin of unbelief for rejecting the message it purges the church the foolish it purges the Earth and it purges the 144,000 you say well then I guess we just missed the purging oh no brother you missed it all you see the purging that God needs to do it's not a matter of will you be purged it's a matter of when will you be purged because God released a bleach in this generation at the opening of The Seven seal it was going to purge a people of their sin of unbelief and I said God I choose to be purged now so that I don't have to be purged then Purge me oh god oh brother that's why the Holy Ghost won't let you get away with it that's why the Holy Ghost won't let you just walk the same but he'll press you he'll convict you he'll preach to you and say get up child you can't have that in your life kick that out of your home what is it it's the purging of the Holy Ghost can I say God Purge me now the prophet said that they were held back to a specific moment Hitler didn't even realize it when he was preaching those sermons it was anointing people's evil heart and brother bham says that God on men to persecute the chws the prophet of God said two very powerful things and he says it in two places that I found brother bam says God cannot destroy the world until the people get in the spirit of destruction right that's right think about that my brother my sister because when you think about it you realize what's happening right now that's right the people are literally getting Prophet says you can't have a healing service until you get in the spirit of a healing service you can't have a Revival unless you're in the spirit of Revival listen you can't even have church until you're in the spirit and brother Brenham says God can't destroy the world until the world gets in the spirit of destruction that's what's happening right now under a six seal they don't realize that fourth dimension when they're feeding on Fox and CNN and YouTube I don't care what kind of feed you want to talk about they feed on Snapchat they feed on Instagram they feed on Facebook you say brother matter there's anything wrong with those nothing's wrong so long as you don't feed on the wrong things there's a reason young people it's called a feed cuz it's feeding you something and often times I find people want to be delivered of anxiety and depression and nervousness and fear and the very thing you want to be delivered from is the very thing that people feed right they don't realize that those Spirits are causing people to lose their minds you know what's so amazing though brother Ben brother Joel what's so amazing I have never turned on a tape of God's prophet and when the tape ended I felt panicked or depressed I have never opened this Bible and the closing of the Bible I just got so much fear and so much anxiety and so much worry no actually quite the opposite now when I didn't have faith I suddenly have faith when I had fear now I have belief I say it's time to stop feeding on the wrong things and start feeding on the body word of the son of man the only thing that'll give you faith for a [Applause] Rapture and they feed and they feed and they feed and they feed yeah and they're they're losing their minds people do you realize that my brother my sister they're losing their minds thank Lord feeding upon those Spirits oh I can hear brother brandham say but those 200 million demons that were held at the river Euphrates and he said they were released Upon A people I can hear a prophet say that they first before God can destroy the world he first the people have to get in the spirit of destruction under that sick seal that they're feeding upon they don't realize it's a pre-tribulation anointing to prepare them for Destruction I just happen to believe that if a false prophet could prophesy them into a tribulation brother what would a true Prophet prophesy me too if they could feed off a sick seal and It prepares them for a tribulation then what will feed in upon a seventh seal do my brother what is God preparing us for not destruction but to get out out of this place to snatch us out of leosia and I say snatch me oh God out of this old pest house let me feed upon the body word of the son of man because some people are preparing for Destruction but some people are preparing to get out of here oh the harao the snatching oh in a moment in the twinkling of an eye brother bam said it be the last little pain you ever feel and a little sweep will come over your body I say oh my body says hallelujah my body says yes Lord even so come Lord Jesus notice this here they don't realize the very thing they're feeding upon is causing them to lose their mind that's right do you realize the very thing you're feeding on is giving you the mind of Christ oh yeah Hallelujah God I said the thing you're feeding on is giving you the mind of Jesus thank you Lord but notice this the brother bam says they get old men like Stalin ikan musolini Hitler to persecute the Jews naturally but also ecclesiastically the spirit loosed upon the bride now notice because brother brandham will show us and and and I don't want to get too teaching here today but but I I just want to show you for a moment if you you look into the because remember there'll be that everybody in the entire world will either be identified by The Sixth Seal or the seventh seal all Humanity will the entire world you'll either be identified by that Sixth Seal or that seventh seal which is the coming of Christ but we know brother Ram says that coming happens in three phases so you say when is the coming of Christ it's already begun brother say we waiting on the Rapture it's already started you say what is the body change I'm going to tell you you what the body change is the body change is my body getting what my soul already has received you are now the sons of God beloved not that you will be but you are now the Sons and Daughters of God you are reigning now with Christ on his throne and so notice brother Adam says that that under that six seal because you you watch this and you can go back and look at this for yourself in the seventh seal brother Brandon mentions that interval you remember that and he says that's the you got to watch that little interval of time because if you read your Bible you'll find that the first six seals are in Revelation six you'll find every single one of them what you won't find in Revelation 6 is the seventh seal that's right because brother baram says that there was a little interval of time and he says in that little interval of time what do you have between Revelation 6 where do you find re where do you find the seventh seal in Revelations chapter 8 brother bham says so what is reev ration 7 it is that little interval I'm taking to going to show you this just for a moment but he says in Revelation 7 and he says you have that little interval of time that's good and the prophet says what is that interval that's the 144,000 let's let's read it Revelations chapter 7 turn there quickly if you could in your Bible we just look at it for a moment you love the Lord notice this here in Revelation 7 after these things after what things Revelation 6 after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the seal notice oh boy I wish I had another hour and I don't don't worry I know I don't but notice it's the Silling Angel brother don't you know that brother Brandon says what will the Jews receive I'm not talking about all Israel I'm talking about TW what I'm talking about 12,000 out of every single tribe making up 144,000 listen all Israel is not all Israel they might all be hdic Jews ashkanazi Jews spartic Jews and the diaspora they all came back to Jerusalem and you can see them all with their top hats and acidic Jews with their beads I'm not criticizing any of them but I'm going to tell you just cuz they dressed like a Jew don't mean they're really a Jew just because they know the Hebrew language don't mean that they're a true Jew listen you might know this message from the front to the back be able to quote it from 47 to 63 I don't mean you're a true elected son of Abraham there's only one thing that makes you a son of Abraham and that's faith in the word of God yes sir yes sir yes sir and notice those Jews 144,000 the prophet says that what will those two prophets of Revelations 11 preach because brother bam says Israel will receive her prophets that's right she will Amos 3 the Lord will do nothing nothing until he first reveals it to his servants the prophets that's why it had to be a prophet that would turn the hearts of the Gentiles oh yeah back to the faith it would take the listen friends you say what's those Moses and Elijah going to do he's going to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children and what will this message do it will turn oh somebody help me preach I say if a true prophet in the Revelations 11 brother bandam says what will they receive They will receive the very same message you received you say what will happen brother Matt a Pentecostal Revival will break out in Jerusalem it broke out in the upper room one day but it's going to break out again and those 144,000 are going to be sealed why brother M because a message from a prophet bro brings some Brother Band says and feast of the trumpets it will turn them back to the genuine wi atonement well brother if it can turn the Jews back to the genine atonement what will this message do to the Gentile Church it turns us back not to a faith but the faith of the Son of God don't you realize this word is an atonement for your life that's right the message of the hour is a bleeding word here brother random say the word bled for you the word you see that's what people want to do they want to separate Jesus from his word but he is his word people say I love Jesus well you don't love him if you don't love his word that's right just give me Jesus I don't need the message just give me Jesus what are you even saying right what you're saying is is you want your version and your creation of a figment of your imagination because my Jesus is his word and notice this here those two prophets will preach to them the same message you received the prophet says that that little interval of time is that little between this Revelations chapter 7 and it's a Silling Angel saying hurt not the Earth nor the sea verse three nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their forehead and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were so 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel so notice this here because this little interval of time is what takes place in between the six seal and the seventh seal now brother bam shows and I I want to be careful that I don't get bog too bogged down here you love the Lord tonight come on because the prophet of God shows us how that Jesus fulfilled the first three feast how many know that and brother bam says what were those three first three feasts the Feast of Passover he is our Pascal l 1 Corinthians 15 he is our Passover and so notice this is so amazing that Jesus listen under the chemistry brother bham says that and we preached on it this morning that under the reformers it was the type of the inspection of the Lamb right that's right and he says that they would inspect the lamb but at the evening time the lamb had to be slain and the blood of the Lamb had to be put on the door L on the post come on and so the prophet of God says that under those reformers the chemistry notice those Jews those Jews all they had was the literal the chemistry of the blood of that lamb brother bam says they would go there every single year go kapor on the day of a atonement and the high priest would Aaron would enter in and it would it would bring it would bring atonement for the all of their children all of their families all of the husbands the wives all of their problems brother maram says so what was the token it was the life the chemistry the literal in other words when you say that what do you mean brother Matt I mean it was the actual mechanics that's right so the chemistry of that lamb the prophet say is what atoned for their sins and the brother Bon says that was a type of what God was doing under Luther and Wesley that it was it was was the mechanics oh brother and sister don't you realize why your anointing it wasn't a lion anointing that Paul was under it wasn't the it was the ox anointing that Mark was under the Book of Mark and the book but the Book of John was and the Book of Luke was the book of man and the Book of John was the book of The Flying Eagle listen friends you say how did those mothers under under the the Dark Ages take their children and a soldier would say deny Christ announce your faith or I'll shoot you and your entire family you say thank God I look at my children brother Jo I say thank God I didn't live there thank God you how many would say that thank God I didn't live there you know what though let me tell you something brother and sister you might have looked at them and think how could they do that brother Matt how could they do that they must have been superhuman super men super women brother they were just like you and they were just like me and just like you they had an impossible in front of them and just like them you have an impossible in front of you you say what's impossible to bring an over out of this darkness and out of this age in this 2024 it looks impossible how did they do it brother Matt I tell you what they couldn't have done it but under the Throne of God there was an anointing released from the throne and it was that Ox anointing and they literally you say how did they do it I'll tell you how that wasn't them doing it it was the anointing that they came under glory to God it was an anointing from the throne room of God how did Luther how did these men you look at men like Luther Charles Spurgeon Finning Knox Calvin Arthur pink read some of the writings of the Reformation you say how did these Brilliant Minds tell you how cuz brother bam said it wasn't those men it was the anointing of the face of a man and that was an anointing that was released listen don't you ever do away with that age of reformation I love it I read it I study it but I bring everything back not under the man anointing I bring it under the eagle anointing that's right because let me just say this your anointing isn't an ox and it's not a lion and it's not the Theology of a man but your anointing is an an eagle anointing and let me just say brother you will never overcome this age living under a man anointing you will never overcome this age living under some intellectual idea I'll just go further and say it's good to shout it's good to speak in tongues it's good to feel the Holy Ghost on your body but you won't always feel the Holy Ghost on your body you won't always feel like shouting you w't always feel like dancing come on somebody you might not always feel like you're up you may feel weigh down but when you get an eagle anointing it doesn't matter what you feel like brother it doesn't matter what your body feels like there's a faith down inside of your soul and notice than it was under that anointing it was under that flying eagle anointing and brother Brandon says that notice under those Harvest Passover think about that that as the Jews under the chemistry of that blood now remember God winked at it what does that mean when you wink at it means like it's okay I'll accept it because you can only serve God based upon the word that's been revealed to you and God will never hold a man accountable outside of what he's already revealed him in faith and brother Ram says that under those ages under think about that they they worshiped under the chemistry of that blood but let me give you the words of a prophet in this in this age the full power of the token life has been released to the body of Christ you don't live under a partial anointing brother you've got the whole thing you say what's it to do brother Matt what's it to do under that partial they can only live partial Christian lives but under the fullness listen you say what are you brother Matt I am the continuation Jesus was the firstborn of the new creation you are the continuation of that same life that's right yeah and brother bham says that in the evening time the token changes from the mechanics from the substance of the Lamb because as much as that Jew wanted to the problem was that the nature or the life of the Lamb could not come back on the worshipper you say oh brother then what do you believe that has to mean that under this sacrifice you don't just receive his gifts you don't just receive his knowledge you receive him and when you get him you get his gifts and when you get him you get his his knowledge when you get him you get his word because brother bandham said it is the literal life the token is the literal life I'm afraid we've majored on the wrong things brother I love the gifts of God let me say I love the miraculous can I just preach here for a moment I love Miracles I've witnessed so many in my life how could I disbelieve now I I be honest I believe anybody that would ever speak against preach against speaking in tongues is only because they never have because if you ever have very first thing I ever thought when I came out of my prayer closet after speaking in tongues for hours I thought who in the world could ever preach against that I'm not I'm not preaching on anybody I'm just saying if you ever felt God you want more of that that's right you ever witness a miracle then you say God give me more miracles but can I just say and please don't misunderstand me can I just say if I never see another miracle in my life but the nature of my lamb can come back on my heart that I will take that over anything I can see with my eyes I say God give me that literal Life of Christ give me that token Zoey life that changes who I am do we realize this was the purpose of the token in the evening time yes sir we have the former rain we have the mechanics brother now what we need is that Dynamic power say what does that Dynamic power do does make me shout it might might make you jump might make you cry might make you dance here's one thing it will do it will bring you into the very image of Jesus Christ the very nature of the Life of Christ can I go just a minute further hello is that all right brother Ben told me to take my time I've taken it as what people are saying you did Brother Matt you took it because I want to get to one point then we'll conclude because remember it was under under that under that Passover think about that my brother my sister as brother bam says that as those Jews were going to sacrifice the Pascal lamb as they did for generations and as they were sacrificing the Pascal lamb on Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on a cross they didn't know it but the prophet of God said in one moment thousands of years that's right thousands of accepting the blood of an animal ceased at that moment that's why the prophet of God in the indictment says that in one moment when the word was crucified in this generation denominations are dead and God doesn't deal with them anymore and he said that's only happened recently that's right that's why the prophet of God said they'll go to church thinking they're worshiping God and they're worshiping the devil and they don't know it as they were sacrificing that Pascal lamb the Lamb of God was hanging on a cross and did you know that as they were offering the Feast of the Feast of of of of unleavened bread Jesus was in the grave and as they were offering the Feast of first fruits he was getting up brother Hallelujah and imagine that the prophet he fulfilled all three in his ministry yes sir Passover he is our Pascal Passover Lamb thank you Lord Paul says he is the first fruits from the dead if there's a first fruit from the dead brother there must be more coming I said if there's a first fruit there must be a second and a third and a fourth and a fifth you say who are they I happen to believe it's my papa I happen to believe it's my m all I believe he was the first fruits but many of they they all the dead in Christ shall rise first but notice this the brother Ram says that notice now what do you have after now you say brother Matt what what is how does this have to do with Ruth I'll tell you how because Ruth enters Bethlehem Judea with Naomi now why was Naomi entering her Homeland well you read it because of a famine but that's why brother brandham could say that Hitler and Stalin was the tenderloving hand of Jehovah Ruth didn't know it that it was the Famine of Judges that God sent to drive her back to her Homeland and Ruth enters Bethlehem Judea at the beginning of barley Harvest now if you study that you'll know that there were bar that those first three feasts were under that barley Harvest first fruits Passover first unleavened bread and first fruits but brother bham says that notice what was Ruth doing it was a type of the spring because barley cens in spring come right and it was what was that it was her coming during the age of the spring teaching rain you say what was that spring teaching ring go look it up the prophet tells you it's Mora Mora what does it mean teaching brother bham used that to show us that the isua street Pentecost was not the true restoration of Pentecost well brother if that wasn't the TR then what is this and brother Ram says that what was that it was a restoration of gifts but the preaching the teaching rain the spring rain barley Harvest spring rain how did they even came what was that spring rain brother man it was the message of the hour it was Ruth and Naomi oh Hallelujah coming under that barley Harvest oh brother but she wasn't going to stay there that's right because it wasn't just going to be a spring Harvest she was also going to you say when did she meet Boaz go read your Bible she meets him at the threshing floor at the beginning of the wheat Harvest I'm talking about a wheat Harvest oh somebody help me preach here tonight and what did Boaz give her the beginning of that wheat Harvest he gave her six measures of barley what was it drop her a little bit of wheat drop her a little bit of of meal every now and then what was the church receiving under Luther a little bit of meal what were they receiving under Wesley a little bit more measure of meal but what were they going to come in this seventh age it wasn't going to be a meal from The Messengers it was going to be Christ [Applause] himself yes sir I looked that up brother you know what that means threshing floor when when Ruth went to the threshing floor and met Boaz I just clicked on that word I thought what is a threshing floor I'll read it straight from the my little my little study hate it says the threshing floor was where they separated the wheat from the shook come on oh glory to God it's where the winnowing took place where God said I'm no longer going to call you Church you won't be identified in judges I'm going to call you bright I'm going to make you different I'm going to separate a people unto myself and the prophet of God says notice this here I'm just going to close here I'm out of time I'm in overtime nine minutes in overtime okay the prophet of God shows us that then what happens after those first three barley Harvest Feast he has the brother bam calls in the Feast of trumpets that long Pentecostal Feast for seven sabbaths that's right from the Feast of Paso from the Feast of of from the crucifixion brother bandam says that 50 days seven weeks seven sevens there was a group of people gathered in an upper room waiting on the promise of the father and under that Feast of Pentecost when they were sacrificing the Feast of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was descending in cloven tongues and brother bham says that what would they do at that way at that at that barley Harvest I love this that they would take part of that barley and that high priest would wave that first barley you know what's so powerful about that brother Ben is that I looked that up and one of the uh Jewish historians was showing how that it wasn't bare barley he didn't just take what was that wave sheath listen friends I'll just go and tell you what I believe was the wave sheath I believe that we have the wave sheath in this hour and I believe one came to maturity does this church believe that sir I said I believe he came to maturity and he was waved you say what was that that first fruit was only an ins sign that the rest of the barley would come to fruit to come to maturity but you know what's so powerful when that priest would wave it the Bible says he would lift it and he would bring it back and he would lift it and he would bring it back and it said he was saying God I give it to you but you gave it back to me I give it to you but you gave it back to me listen friends you'll never give God anything that he doesn't give you back tfold of what You' given him and he was giving that barley and that writer said notice it wasn't just bare barley but he took it and he put the barley in a vessel come on you you see what people have done is they've worshiped The Vessel they've deified The Vessel say brother Brandon was he the way not William Mary and Brandon was not the wave sheath but the word that was in his life it was never about the vessel brother Joel it was about the word oh what did we see in this generation it wasn't just a Kentucky hillbilly it wasn't just a man who can do Miracles it was the word coming to maturity in a human vessel and if God could bring that vessel to maturity I said God anoint this vessel oh God mature this barley Lord Jesus yes sir thank you Lord it wasn't going to stay barley though because there was going to be a harvest feast and she was going to meet Boaz at wheat Harvest oh there's so much more to it brother and sister I don't have time to preach it she met him and he gives her six minutes of barley what's it what's he doing because you notice at the wheat Harvest at The Barley Harvest those first three and then you have that long Feast of Pentecost and brother bandham says that Feast of Pentecost goes all the way to the Rapture I say brother when did Pentacost stop it all it does didn't stop brother how do you know cuz I'm still here and that Pentecostal Feast goes all the way till I get my body Chang and I get out of this world oh you say brother Matt what do you believe I believe this is the fullness of Pentecost when is it the fullness when my body is changed and notice it wasn't going to be a wave sheath if you go look at Leviticus 23 that when they would offer those the wheat first fruit was not going to be just a single barley a single crop come on but go look in Leviticus 16 and Leviticus 23 what you'll find is that under that wheat Harvest there was also a wave offering thank you Lord but it wasn't a single barly brother it was a whole loaf see brother Matt what are you saying I'm saying that God never intended to bottle up everything in one man named William brandham it was never going to be about one gift and one man listen I'm thankful for that it was a oneman Ministry but God intended not just to have one man who we all look to but he wants an entire loaf of bread but you know what's so powerful is that actually under that wheat Harvest it was two loaves I looked at that in my Bible it's two loaves of bread that's right that actually under that Pentecostal wheat Feast that first fruit was two loaves of bread come on now now I don't have authority so so you take this or leave it I just say it that way you know what I believe I believe those two loaves was going to represent two women because when Boaz redeems Ruth he redeems Naomi with her and God says I'm not going to leave listen friend you say brother Matt what's happening I tell you what you turn on the news and I tell you what's happening right now two Prophets are about to appear to that little land of Judea and when the entire world surrounds her in Zechariah 13 the Bible says the entire all entire Gentile Army of all the armies of the world a United Nations Army will surround her to Encompass her I stood there in Armageddon in the valley of megiddo and I looked over that great big old field vast as far as the eye can see I told the brother with me I said can you imagine the prophet of God said that the battle that started in heaven and Satan was kicked down to the Earth ends right here in this field right here when all the armies of the worth will surround her and she's surrounded you think she surrounded Now by Iran and Hamas and you know all of these armies and everything that's happening friends you say brother Matt what do you believe I believe that the same God who protected her in the desert is the same God who fed her a Mana in the wilderness the same God who gave water out of a rock is the same God who said I'll fight for Israel be I'll come down into battle of myself you say brother M what do you believe before that ever takes place there's got to be a gentile bride that's taken out of this world Listen friends don't you realize you are in the way and God needs to remove you out of the way it's happening right now my brother my sister Here Comes little Ruth Here Comes Naomi and she's entering under that trumpet persecution famine and here she comes and here's little Ruth both identified in Redemption Lord say brother Matt what happened I'm going to tell you what happened my brother my sister a little insignificant woman who has no explanation for where she found herself and I just want to say that's my testimony how are you here I have no explanation for it brother all I can say if you've heard nothing I've said let me this say it's Grace Grace Amazing Grace oh I'm just want to say thank you God for grace that you've given to my life thank you that you gave me eyes that can see and ears that can hear because the word listen Brothers musicians could come the word that was restored in this generation I stood there in Israel last August my first time ever getting to go just right before those October 7th attacks and I I wanted to see something something I've studied for years and not recommending you study it I I just got interested in it but if you ever do a study on manuscripts and they got the original how you have the Hebrew Bible the Tanakh where did it come from because we know it was never written down Orly it was passed down David said I'll not hide them I'll tell them but there but but you notice those Hebrew manuscripts and I stood there if you ever get to get the chance to go there it'll change your life don't go right now I would recommend it not now be honest though it's hard for me not to go right now you just play something real soft just real soft and I stood there and and I wanted to see it so bad it was the it was the Israeli Museum and they have a little exhibit called The Shrine of the book oh it's so powerful stood there and and down inside of that Shrine is where they keep the Dead Sea Scrolls and it's where they keep the what they call the Aleppo codex the Aleppo codex is the it's the one of the most Dependable reliable manuscripts that they have for the Hebrew Bible book of Isaiah Book of Ruth all of these books that you have here um you know in your Old Testament and those those that Aleppo codex is from 1,000 ad and it was a it was a tribe called the mastic people the mazeres were were like the you know a sectarian but they they preserve the word and they have perfect cannot perfect you know Hebrew writing and it was dated from 1,000 a so you say what was what was the Hebrew Bible based upon writings from a thousand years after Christ and that's what made the the the Dead Sea scroll Discovery so powerful is when they that little ban Shepherd throws a rock in that cave and he hears clay jars break and he goes in there and he discovers and what what he discovers is Bible manuscripts that's right that now don't date from 1,000 ad but 300 BC third Century sorry BC that actually and what they found when they opened up the Dead Sea Scrolls and they opened up the book of Isaiah the Isaiah scroll and they compared it to 1000 ad it was a perfect match that's right because the God who created the universe can preserve his own word yes sir and he doesn't need man he doesn't need scientist he doesn't need an he don't need an education God preserves his own word and I stood there and it was so powerful because they were they were sitting there showing this you could see the entire lipo codex written out the original Hebrew manuscript and then underneath that they point to the date of the discovery of those Dead Sea Scrolls and I stood there and almost just I was so floored because they quote a scripture out of Isaiah that says behold the word will return to Zion out of Zion shall return the law yes the Torah the four first five books of of Moses and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls brother you know when it was 1947 and when Obama visits Israel Benjamin na takes him to the Shrine of the book points as you can see the picture and he's pointing to it and he says you don't let anybody tell me that this isn't our land and that we don't belong here because before God ever brought us here he first restored the word back to the people do you realize the Jews look at the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls as a supernatural Vindication that the time was right and that actually in 1947 they become a nation in 48 but in 1947 the Jews say before God could give us our homeland back he first had to restore the word back to us brother I about fainted sitting there in that Shrine of the book and my mind began to think at the moment they're discovering the Dead Sea Scrolls a whirlwind on at the time they're discovering the de at the time that that that God's moving on the heart of of of Naomi God's moving on the heart of Ruth and at the time they're discovering the word the word is beginning to be recorded on magnetic tap brother you can't make this stuff up God's got a perfect plan and at the moment the word is being restored to the Jews and Naomi is being redeemed Ruth is being redeemed with boas oh stand to your feet my brother and my sister I ain't got time to preach anymore I would to say this I believe it's real and I believe it's later than we think say brother Matt what do you believe I believe two prophets are about to appear to those 144,000 but something's got to take place before that oh yeah say what is it brother Matt listen to me my brother my sister oh my if a message from two prophets could turn the hearts of those backslid and Jews to the genuine atonement of Christ then what ought this message from a gentile Prophet it won't turn us back to traditions of Pentecost it won't turn us back to traditions of denominations it won't turn us back to traditions of men it'll turn us back to the genuine atonement of Christ Christ impersonated in his in his family bow your heads with me every head bowed every eye closed Lord thank you for your word how could we describe it Lord It's Indescribable how could we explain it Lord it sometimes seems unexplainable but one way I would describe it Lord one way I would describe that I'm here in 2024 in a midst of a world that's Fallen apart but yet there's a love for this word down inside of my soul I just say Lord it sounds too good to be true but I want to raise my hand and say thank you God thank you for eyes that can see oh you ought to tell him that my brother my sister you are to say God thank you for eyes that can see thank you for an ears that can hear thank you for a body that can praise thank you for a mouth that can worship thank you Lord God for a place we can gather and be with one another and share Lord God not just in Lord our our natural problems but share in the same promises and the same hope and the same faith in a supernatural God for Lord truly you have done a wonderful work in this generation and we just want to say thank you God that we're part of it I'd invite anybody who who's just stuck in that judges Circle I'd invite you to come out of that Circle there's a story being written and let me say this brother whether you believe it or not it's true whether you accept or not whether I preach it or not it's still the truth whether I say whether you ever get part of it it's still happening God will the the spirit of God will pass you right by I say take your moment take your opportunity and step out of that Circle of judges and get into Ruth get into this line of Redemption where stories are being Rewritten lives are being changed his trees be listen friends God can rewrite your life of failure in one moment all you got to do is stand in his presence brother bam says that five minutes speaking of Moses in the presence of God oh it it it it changed what Theology and education and Reformation couldn't do in five minutes in the presence of God changed this whole life I wonder if you want to raise your hand and say Lord let me find myself out of the Famine of this world let me find myself not feeding on that fourth dimensional curse but let me find myself feeding on this word let me feed on it day and night let me say like David it's my daily bread it's my portion it's my life oh if you need a recharge of the faith of God then say God give me a recharge of my faith oh as the prophet said I'm looking for a fresh surge of the Holy Ghost oh how many in this church would say God give me a fresh surge of the baptism of the Holy Ghost surge Lord God through my body surge through my family surge through my home surge God let the holy spirit this isn't a time to go backwards this is a time to go forward in Jesus it's a time to press on like we've never pressed before give my last dying breath Lord God let it be a breath that gives you praise and honor let me give you praise Lord with my whole life praise God oh sing it to him praise that
