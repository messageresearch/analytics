[22:07] All right. Well, with that,

[28:15] wrestled with the Lord
[28:20] and instant with a courage. Bold, I
[28:25] stood upon his holy word.
[28:30] Well, I would not be denied.
[28:35] Oh, I would not be denied.
[28:40] Until Jesus came and he made me whole, I
[28:47] would not be denied.
[28:51] Well, oh, Satan said my Lord was gone
[28:57] and would not hear. We don't believe
[29:00] that, do we? Oh, but praise the Lord,
[29:05] the work is done. How many believes
[29:08] Christ is here tonight? Oh, sing with
[29:10] all your hearts now. Well, I would not
[29:15] be denied.
[29:17] [Music]
[29:34] Heat. Heat.
[29:36] [Music]
[29:44] till Jesus came and
[29:49] oh I would not be
[29:54] one more time. Oh, I would not be
[30:00] Oh, I would not be
[30:06] till Jesus came.
[30:12] [Music]
[30:12] [Applause]

[30:18] tonight?
[30:19] Amen. So glad he put something in your
[30:22] heart that can say, "Lord, I'm going to
[30:24] get all that you've got for me." Is that
[30:26] the way you come to church tonight?
[30:28] Amen. God bless you. If you would bow
[30:30] with me for just a moment, bow your
[30:32] heads and let's just talk to the Lord.
[30:35] Heavenly Father, as we come to this
[30:37] communion service, I pray God that you
[30:39] would just move,
[30:42] Lord, have your way in every part of the
[30:44] service.
[30:45] Lord, we don't want to orchestrate it so
[30:49] and until you don't have any freedom to
[30:51] move, but we want your will to be done.
[30:54] I pray that you grant it tonight. Move
[30:56] me out of the way, Lord, that you would
[30:59] speak directly to the people, Lord, and
[31:03] they're your people. They're the
[31:04] purchase of your blood. And I pray, God,
[31:07] that you would speak directly to them.
[31:09] We thank you for doing that, Lord. God,
[31:12] you've done it for me so many times,
[31:14] spoken through a minister, through your
[31:15] prophet. Lord, I pray you do it for your
[31:18] people again tonight. Heal the sick,
[31:20] touch those that are in need. We pray in
[31:22] Jesus name.
[31:25] Amen. Thank the Lord.
[31:29] Amen.
[31:31] Amen. It's good to be here tonight.
[31:33] Romans chapter 8 verse1 15. Romans 8:15.
[31:38] just read this very quickly and just a
[31:42] little thought that we had tonight and
[31:43] then we'll go right into
[31:46] right into the communion service. I want
[31:50] to speak to you tonight on worship under
[31:51] adoption.
[31:53] Worship under adoption. Romans 8:15. For
[31:56] you have not received the spirit of
[31:59] bondage again to fear, but you have
[32:02] received the spirit of adoption.
[32:06] So you've not received a spirit of a
[32:08] slave, but you have received the spirit
[32:12] of a son or a daughter of God whereby we
[32:16] cry. So in other words, he's saying this
[32:20] is why we cry under the spirit of
[32:24] adoption. This is why we worship Abba,
[32:28] father. We call him our father because
[32:32] he we have received the spirit of
[32:35] adoption. Amen. I pray the Lord would
[32:37] add his blessing to the reading of the
[32:38] word. You may be seated.
[32:41] It is this revelation that we have of
[32:44] who we are as sons and daughters of God
[32:48] that has a direct effect on our worship.
[32:52] The revelation that we have that we are
[32:55] sons and daughters of God. And that is
[32:57] essentially what the new birth is or or
[33:00] what it does for us. Brother Brandham
[33:02] says, "I I was that eagle in the chicken
[33:05] pin." He said, "But one day," he said,
[33:07] "I realized I was not the son of Charles
[33:10] and Ella Brandom, but I was the son of
[33:12] God." And when I realized I was a son of
[33:15] God, or you were a daughter of God, he
[33:17] when we realized that, he said, "Then I
[33:19] was born again."
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Right? And and so it was that
[33:22] revelation. And so when we talk about
[33:25] the new birth, we're not talking about
[33:27] uh just having an emotional experience,
[33:30] though that's part of it. Brother Brand
[33:31] said any birth is a mess. And when you
[33:34] die to yourself, many times you got to
[33:35] die at an altar. You got to die to
[33:37] yourself. It might have been in your
[33:38] home, might have been uh in your car,
[33:41] but wherever it is, you got to die to
[33:42] yourself. And that's a mess to go
[33:45] through that time. But it's not any
[33:47] certain emotional experience or any kind
[33:50] of a of a response emotionally. But the
[33:53] reason why you worship is because of
[33:56] revelation that you have. I am a son of
[33:59] God. I realize that I'm a Christian. And
[34:02] sometimes it takes a little bit because
[34:04] a person maybe will be saved and come
[34:07] and be baptized and be saved and maybe
[34:10] even receive the baptism of the Holy
[34:11] Ghost. And yet the devil will fight them
[34:14] on this maturity of being a Christian.
[34:16] And maybe they'll grow over time. And
[34:19] one day they'll look back and realize,
[34:20] "Hey, I'm a Christian. And I've been a
[34:22] Christian for a while. I've been serving
[34:25] the Lord and doing the things that God
[34:27] has called me to do. And and uh uh I'm
[34:32] uh I've been doing that uh for for a
[34:34] while and God has called me to do that.
[34:37] And now I believe that I have been I I
[34:40] am a part of what of God's program. And
[34:43] so you begin to cry out, "Aba, Father,
[34:45] Lord, you're my God. I belong in the
[34:48] message of the hour. I'm a son of God."
[34:50] How many can say amen to that tonight?
[34:52] You you didn't belong in the world. You
[34:54] were you didn't belong in denomination.
[34:56] You didn't belong in the things of the
[34:58] world. But you belong in the house of
[35:00] God worshshiping with the people of God.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And so our worship is because of who we
[35:06] are and what we were created to do. He
[35:10] created us for worship. How many believe
[35:13] that tonight? I was created to worship
[35:17] him. And and so in Ephesians 1:5, we've
[35:21] read it several times lately, but he
[35:23] said, "He has predestinated us unto the
[35:25] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[35:28] himself according to the good pleasure
[35:31] of his will." And so we could say it
[35:33] like this. We were predestined to
[35:36] worship him, to become the sons of God,
[35:39] the daughters of God, or to recognize
[35:41] that that's what we were because you
[35:43] always were a son of God. When you
[35:45] recognize what you are, there's
[35:47] something about that that brings a
[35:49] worship. You don't want to just sit like
[35:51] a bump on a pickle, but there's
[35:52] something about that makes you makes you
[35:54] happy. It makes you glad. It makes you
[35:57] excited to know I'm not just a I'm not
[36:00] just another person in Leona. I'm not
[36:02] just another person fighting this church
[36:04] age, but I actually belong to God. I
[36:08] belong to something. You know, if you
[36:10] were adopted naturally and and maybe you
[36:13] uh you didn't realize that uh that that
[36:16] that your parents went out of their way
[36:18] to uh to choose you. You were adopted
[36:21] one day. You realize that uh you know,
[36:24] hey, they chose me to be part of this
[36:26] family and and I am a part of the
[36:28] family. Well, God did the same thing for
[36:30] you. But what you realize where I always
[36:32] was a part of the family and when you
[36:35] realize that's where I belong. That's
[36:37] who I'm a part of. those uh my my dad
[36:39] what my dad's attributes are is what I
[36:42] am. Oh God, if we just realize I'm a
[36:44] part of deity. I belong to deity. I
[36:47] belong to the message of the hour.
[36:49] Belong to Christ. What does that do for
[36:50] you? It makes it where you you can
[36:53] worship in freedom because you're not
[36:54] worried about what people say about you
[36:56] no more. I'm a son of God. I belong to
[36:58] God.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; So we were predestined to worship in
[37:03] freedom
[37:05] as sons.
[37:06] Brother Bren said, "What did he do?" He
[37:08] by fornowledge foresaw us knowing that
[37:11] he was a savior.
[37:14] Self-existence. Say, "Brother Ben, what
[37:16] does this have to do with communion?"
[37:17] Communion is worship.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; This is a part of our worship.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; We're giving this back to God. Lord, I
[37:24] can't do much. David said, "There's not
[37:25] much I can do." I'm paraphrasing, but he
[37:28] said, "There's not much I can do to to
[37:30] give to the Lord what he has given to
[37:32] me, but I can take the cup. Come on.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; I can take the cup. We can say amen to
[37:37] that. I can take communion and I can
[37:39] stand among the people of God. And he
[37:41] said, I'll pay my vows in the house of
[37:43] the Lord. That's what we're doing here
[37:45] tonight. That's why you come out on a
[37:46] Sunday afternoon. I'm going to pay my
[37:48] vows in the house of the Lord.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did he do? By
[37:53] fornowledge, he by fornowledge foresaw
[37:55] us knowing that he was a savior.
[37:57] Self-existence. There was no angels, no
[37:59] nothing. This God, Eli, Elohim, the
[38:02] self-existing one. Nothing but him
[38:04] alone. But in him was a savior. Well,
[38:07] what's he going to save? There's nothing
[38:09] lost. Knowing that even he knowed this
[38:11] great attribute in him would project
[38:12] something out yonder that he could save.
[38:15] Then when it did that by fornowledge, he
[38:17] looked down and he saw everyone that
[38:19] would accept it. And then by doing so,
[38:21] he said to save that, the only way I can
[38:23] do it will be to come down myself and be
[38:25] made flesh and take the sin of a man
[38:27] upon him and die for him that I might be
[38:29] the one that's worshiped.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; He did it all so that he could be
[38:34] worshiped.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad we worship
[38:38] him in spirit and in truth? We have the
[38:40] truth that tells us how to take
[38:42] communion and how to gather together and
[38:44] all of those things, but we don't
[38:45] worship just by letter, but we worship
[38:47] him in spirit as well. His entire
[38:51] purpose was to be worshiped. He said he
[38:53] is God, the object of worship. And his
[38:58] entire purpose was to be worshiped as
[38:59] God, our savior and redeemer, our king.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And I want many times when we preach
[39:05] about worship, people feel bad
[39:08] because I think there's not one of us
[39:10] that couldn't say, "Well, we don't
[39:11] worship God enough."
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; We're not free enough.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; I'll say this. It's not helpful to judge
[39:20] other people.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Right? Whether they worship a lot or a
[39:25] little
[39:25] &gt;&gt; that's not helpful.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Look at them say, "Well, I wish this
[39:29] church worship more." Well, you just
[39:30] start worshiping.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I I've I've expressed this to our song
[39:35] leaders and to our to worship leaders
[39:37] and to preachers even. If you worship,
[39:40] the people will worship.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Right? That that's that's what it is. Us
[39:44] worshiping that causes people to
[39:46] worship. I don't want to just be a
[39:48] person who tells people to worship. Let
[39:51] me worship and people worship with me.
[39:53] If you don't want to, that's up to you.
[39:55] But I got the spirit of adoption.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; I didn't get the spirit of fear.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; I got the spirit of adoption. Many times
[40:02] we look at other people and we judge
[40:03] what they do or what they don't do. And
[40:05] it's it's not the right spirit to have
[40:08] uh in in worship, but the right spirit
[40:10] to have is actually to say, "Lord, how
[40:13] can I worship you? What do you want from
[40:14] me? What what what do you desire from my
[40:17] heart to yours? And maybe that's sitting
[40:19] there and and crying. And maybe it's
[40:21] sitting there and thinking about the
[40:22] things of God. Maybe it's raising your
[40:24] hand. Maybe it's worshiping, shouting,
[40:26] running around the building. I don't
[40:27] know what it'll be, but it'll do
[40:29] something to you when you realize that
[40:31] you're a son or daughter of God. So, why
[40:34] are we afraid to be free? Many times
[40:36] we're afraid. It It's because many times
[40:38] of a slave mentality. We We still feel
[40:43] like sinners. We still feel in bondage
[40:46] and this this flesh is bondage to a
[40:49] certain extent.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Because Paul said and
[40:52] go read in Romans chapter 7, he said
[40:54] will be delivered from the bondage of
[40:56] this corruption. Right? He said, "Oh
[40:59] wretched man that I am, right?" And he
[41:02] was a saved man, a Holy Ghost-filled
[41:04] man, but he packed around a body of
[41:06] death.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to live very long to
[41:09] realize that you pack around a body of
[41:11] death. And many times that's what keeps
[41:12] you. It's what gets you tired on a
[41:14] Sunday afternoon. It's what keeps you
[41:16] from raising your hands. It's what keeps
[41:18] you from worship. It's what keeps you
[41:19] from the things of God. It's it keeps
[41:21] you from reading your Bible. It's this
[41:23] old flesh man. I'm glad there's coming a
[41:25] day when I'm going to be able to worship
[41:27] in complete and total freedom because
[41:29] I'm going to have a body like his
[41:30] glorious body. I tell you what, the more
[41:32] I get flesh out of the way here, the
[41:35] better I can worship him.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; The more I get this revelation, I was
[41:40] not born to be. You see, it's Benjamin
[41:42] Puit that keeps me from worshiping. But
[41:44] when I realize that's not the real me, I
[41:46] got a new name written down in glory. I
[41:48] belong to God. I was in his mind before
[41:51] the foundation of the earth. When I
[41:52] recognize that, then I can begin to
[41:54] worship freely.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Why are we afraid many times to be free?
[42:00] We don't realize maybe who we are
[42:03] &gt;&gt; or we just let that slave mentality
[42:05] creep back over us. See, the opening of
[42:08] the seal is all about worship. Yeah.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that? I know people have
[42:13] made the seals some kind of
[42:17] &gt;&gt; study
[42:19] where we know things. That's not what
[42:20] the seals was about. The seals was the
[42:24] breaking
[42:27] the the loosing
[42:29] of all creation
[42:31] from the bondage of every claim the
[42:33] devil had on them.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; That's what the opening of the seals
[42:37] was. The opening of the seals was not a
[42:40] a a textbook. It was not a study. And so
[42:43] we'll understand more about prophecy.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; But the opening of the seals was the
[42:47] releasing of Satan's claim on the earth
[42:51] &gt;&gt; when the book could not go back into the
[42:53] dirty hands of Satan. So it went back to
[42:55] the original owner. And Revelation 5 and
[42:58] verse one said, "I saw in the right hand
[43:00] of him that sat on the throne a book
[43:02] written within and on the backside
[43:04] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[43:06] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[43:08] voice, who is worthy to open the book,
[43:10] and to loose the seals thereof? And no
[43:13] man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
[43:14] under the earth, was able to open the
[43:16] book, neither to look thereon. And I
[43:18] wept much, because no man was found
[43:19] worthy to open and to read the book,
[43:21] neither to look thereon. One of the
[43:22] elders said unto me, weep not. He said,
[43:26] "This isn't the time for weeping.
[43:28] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[43:31] the root of David, hath prevailed to
[43:33] open the book, and to loose the seven
[43:35] seals thereof. I beheld, lo, in the
[43:37] midst of the throne, of the four beasts,
[43:39] in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb
[43:40] that had been slain, having seven horns,
[43:43] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[43:45] spirits of God, sent forth into all the
[43:47] earth. And he came and took the book out
[43:49] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[43:52] the throne.
[43:53] And when he had taken the book, now I'll
[43:56] just read it like some people think. The
[43:58] four beasts and the four and 20 elders
[44:00] held a seminar
[44:05] &gt;&gt; and everybody got their notebooks out
[44:06] and
[44:08] &gt;&gt; right and I'm not making fun of there's
[44:09] a time for that. There's a place for
[44:11] that.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; But that's not what they did.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't gather around the throne and
[44:15] say, "Oh, now we can really argue with
[44:18] our neighbor." You know
[44:21] when the lamb took the book, they didn't
[44:23] start a exposition or a seminar.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; What did they do? They fell down
[44:29] &gt;&gt; before the lamb
[44:31] &gt;&gt; having every one of them harps. Amen.
[44:33] They were everyone musicians.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Golden vows full of odors which are the
[44:38] prayers of the saints
[44:40] &gt;&gt; which were kept. Yeah.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; You realize the Bible says every prayer
[44:44] you ever prayed, if you're a saint of
[44:45] God, every prayer you ever prayed was
[44:48] kept.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Not one of them was wasted. They were
[44:52] kept before God. Hallelujah. Golden
[44:54] vials full of odors, which are the
[44:56] prayers of saints. And they sung a new
[44:58] song saying, "Thou art worthy to take
[45:00] the book and to open the seal." They
[45:02] wrote a song right on the spot. They
[45:04] didn't have a seminar. They didn't get
[45:05] together and argue with each other. But
[45:07] what did they do? They worshiped. Cuz
[45:10] this is what you do when you realize who
[45:12] you are. This is what you do when you
[45:14] see your name in the book. This is what
[45:16] you do. Come on, church.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; You talk about a Pentecostal revival.
[45:20] The Pentecostals worship because they
[45:22] believe the gifts had been restored.
[45:24] They believe they knew about tongues and
[45:25] things like that. We don't worship about
[45:27] gifts. We worship about the giver. We
[45:30] worship about Christ coming down into
[45:32] our age.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Ought to be much greater worship
[45:36] &gt;&gt; than anything Pentecostals could do.
[45:39] Look, they sung a new song. Said, "Thou
[45:42] art worthy."
[45:43] Hallelujah.
[45:45] And look at verse 10. And hast made us
[45:48] unto our God, kings and priests. They
[45:50] knew who they were. Why? Because of the
[45:53] opening opening of the seals.
[45:56] Hallelujah. And we shall reign. That
[45:58] revelation wasn't there before. But but
[46:01] Joel, as soon as they heard that the
[46:02] seals come open, as soon as they saw the
[46:04] lamb take the book, they said, "We know
[46:06] who we are now. You are worthy." and you
[46:08] have made us kings and priests.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; We shall reign on the earth. And I
[46:13] beheld heard the voice of many angels
[46:15] round about the throne and the beasts
[46:17] and the elders. And the number of them
[46:20] was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of
[46:24] thousands
[46:25] saying some of y'all going to get mad at
[46:28] me right here. Saying with a
[46:31] &gt;&gt; what does that say?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody just say that out loud if you
[46:34] can read.
[46:36] loud voice.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; I'm glad, you know, down here sometimes
[46:43] our ears hurt, but I think it'll be just
[46:44] perfect up there.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But what did they say with a loud voice?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Worthy. Hallelujah.
[46:54] They said
[46:57] they said, "Turn that PA all the way
[46:59] up."
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. What it says? A
[47:03] loud voice. They said with a loud voice,
[47:07] "Worthy is the lamb."
[47:10] I know it's hard for us sometimes. I
[47:12] know some people, and there are people
[47:13] who just in their nature, they're not
[47:14] loud people. And and I appreciate you
[47:16] people. I really do that aren't loud.
[47:20] But I think if you ever really get a
[47:21] revelation of who you are, there'll be
[47:23] some kind of
[47:25] some kind of response.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; The angels cried with a loud voice,
[47:31] "Worthy is the lamb." Can anyone call
[47:33] him worthy tonight? Worthy is the lamb
[47:36] that was slain to receive power and
[47:37] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[47:39] and glory and blessing. And every
[47:41] creature which is in heaven and on the
[47:43] earth and under the earth and such as
[47:44] are in the sea and all that are in them
[47:45] heard I saying blessing and honor and
[47:47] glory and power be unto him that sitth
[47:49] upon the throne unto the lamb forever
[47:51] and ever. Brother Brandham turns that
[47:52] around and he says every creature heard
[47:54] John say.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He he was that loud with
[47:59] it. Why? He saw his name in the book.
[48:02] He saw he wasn't going to be lost, but
[48:04] he was going to be redeemed.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The four beasts said,
[48:08] "Amen." And and and they must have been
[48:10] able to hear him say, "Amen."
[48:13] Or John wouldn't have wrote it. Four
[48:14] beasts said, "Amen." And the four and 20
[48:17] elders fell down and worshiped him that
[48:19] liveth forever
[48:21] &gt;&gt; and ever. But the Brandon said the 8th
[48:24] to the 14th verse of the fifth chapter
[48:25] reveals the time for the lamb to be
[48:28] worshiped both in heaven and in earth.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The time for him to be
[48:35] worshiped both in heaven and in earth.
[48:36] The seventh sealed book, the worthy
[48:38] lamb, the kinsman redeemer. And from the
[48:40] 8th verse to the 14th, angels worship
[48:43] him, elders worship him, living
[48:45] creatures worship him, and John
[48:47] worshiped him. He's a type of the bride.
[48:49] so much till he said every creature in
[48:50] heaven in the earth underneath the earth
[48:52] heard me saying blessings glory power
[48:54] wisdom might be to the lamb that worship
[48:57] time he said for the king lamb I believe
[48:59] every one of our services under the
[49:01] opening of the word under our adoption
[49:04] under the message of the hour every one
[49:05] of our services ought to be holy holy
[49:08] holy to the lamb worthy is the lamb why
[49:11] because we know who we are we know where
[49:13] we belong and if you don't know you can
[49:15] know we have a message that will reveal
[49:17] that to you the The Holy Ghost can fill
[49:19] you and help you to know who you are.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; You can't know him without the Holy
[49:25] Ghost. You can't know the message
[49:26] without the Holy Ghost. But if you ever
[49:28] get it, there'll be some response in
[49:30] your life.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Might be as simple as just saying, "Hey,
[49:36] I'm a Christian." But that'll bring a
[49:38] smile across your face.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, then that's I don't know
[49:44] what to do with you. I'll be honest.
[49:48] That ought to bring a smile to your
[49:49] face. I'm a Christian. I may be sick,
[49:50] but I'm a Christian.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; What? What are you saying? You know, a
[49:55] person could say that a few years ago
[49:56] and they'd say before the opening of the
[49:58] word, I'm a Christian, but I might be
[50:00] lost tomorrow, so I got to be afraid.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; But you realize what you're saying when
[50:05] you're saying you're a Christian under
[50:06] the message of the hour.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; You can't be lost.
[50:17] We've been here a few years and I excuse
[50:18] me for again for being emotional, but
[50:21] I've watched some of these young men and
[50:22] young women and and and and some of
[50:24] y'all grew up and and I've seen some of
[50:26] y'all baptized many of you now.
[50:29] And I've watched you come from, you
[50:32] know, maybe from bad backgrounds and
[50:34] things, different ones that are here.
[50:35] And you're sitting here listening to the
[50:37] word, feeding on the word. I've watched
[50:39] that change in your life.
[50:43] and under the message of the hour,
[50:44] recognizing that if God did that for
[50:46] you, that's for eternity. Ain't nothing
[50:50] the devil's going to be able to do. He
[50:52] may fight you. He may he may he may give
[50:54] you all kinds of trouble, but he's not
[50:56] going to be able to have you. You belong
[50:58] to God. Now, you realize what that does
[51:00] to me as a pastor to say, "My work's not
[51:02] in vain. All the preaching's not in
[51:04] vain. I know you're going to make it cuz
[51:06] you're the bride of Jesus Christ." What
[51:08] ought that ought to do to every one of
[51:10] us when we recognize I've given my heart
[51:13] to the Lord. I've been filled with the
[51:14] Holy Ghost. I am a Christian. I belong
[51:16] in the mind of God. I belong in the
[51:19] opening of the word. I belong in the
[51:21] message of the hour. I can worship about
[51:23] that no matter what's going on in my
[51:25] life.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; When I don't feel good, I can still
[51:31] worship.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; When it's a slow service, I can still
[51:35] worship.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:38] Are you with me now?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; When it's quiet, I can worship quietly.
[51:42] When it's loud, I can worship loudly.
[51:44] Whatever response he calls from me.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; It's worship time.
[51:55] I'll say this and I'm going to close
[51:56] before too long. You're not going to
[51:58] believe how fast I'm going to close.
[52:05] I'm flat wore out.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy says, "Do a little more."
[52:14] &gt;&gt; All right, Brother Jeremy.
[52:16] Many people are afraid to worship
[52:17] because we know all worship's not
[52:19] accepted.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; You want to be accepted, don't you? I
[52:23] want to be accepted.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; So, that's a lot of it is people say,
[52:26] "Well, I don't want But you remember the
[52:28] man Jesus talked about he said he who
[52:31] went away and he gave his servants gave
[52:33] one five talents one two another one he
[52:35] gave one and the one he gave five
[52:38] talents he went out and made five
[52:39] talents and and brought 10 back and the
[52:41] one he gave two he went out and made two
[52:44] and brought four back and the one who he
[52:46] gave one he said I know my master he he
[52:50] requires the right kind of worship
[52:53] &gt;&gt; can we say it that way so I just won't
[52:55] do nothing
[52:57] I just come back and bring that that he
[52:58] I'll go hide it in the earth,
[53:01] &gt;&gt; right? And bring it back. He hid it in
[53:03] the earth. He didn't do nothing with it.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he was disapproved by
[53:07] his master. Why? Because he hid it what
[53:12] God had given him. He He was afraid to
[53:14] worship. I say if God's given you
[53:16] salvation, worship under that. Whatever
[53:18] place he's led you to, if he give you
[53:21] the Holy Ghost, worship him for that. If
[53:23] he healed your body, worship him for
[53:24] that. Don't just bury it in the earth.
[53:27] Worship God. Get return thanks for what
[53:29] you've been given.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Revelation 13:8 tells us that all that
[53:35] dwell upon the earth here in the end
[53:37] times shall worship him. That's the
[53:38] antichrist, the beast whose names are
[53:41] not written in the book of life of the
[53:43] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[53:44] world. Listen. But brother Brandham in
[53:48] this adoption uh message he he tells us
[53:51] he said talks about this antichrist. He
[53:53] said he came down taken upon himself. We
[53:55] don't want to be in that group that
[53:56] worships the Antichrist. Right.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And they worship,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; right? They worship, but they worship
[54:02] wrong.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; They worship under a system, under a
[54:04] dogma, under a creed.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But but we don't do that.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; But I know people get afraid of that.
[54:10] Say, "Well, I don't want to worship
[54:11] wrong." Look what brother Brandham says.
[54:13] He came down taken upon himself. While
[54:15] he did that, he did that you he might
[54:16] save you who wants to be saved. He said,
[54:18] "By fornowledge, the infinite God who
[54:20] knows all things. He slayed the lamb
[54:22] before the foundation of the world. He
[54:23] put your name on the lamb's book of life
[54:25] and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; What he would do. So he put your name on
[54:32] there.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I just about turned around had a spell
[54:36] when I read that.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said he saw we live
[54:40] in the end time. He saw there'd be an
[54:42] antichrist. He saw there'd be a system
[54:43] of of unbelief. And yeah, they worship
[54:46] and they worship Rome. It's not
[54:48] received.
[54:49] Jesus said, "In vain do they worship me,
[54:51] teaching for doctrines of commandments
[54:52] of men, but we do not worship in vain."
[54:55] God knew the deceitfulness of Satan.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; So he put your name on there and he said
[54:59] that that Antichrist would be so
[55:01] religious, so good, such a fine fellow,
[55:03] such a smart man, such a religious man
[55:05] that he would deceive the very elected
[55:07] if it was possible. But it is.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Turn it into Joel. I'm going to beat up
[55:14] the pulpit. It is an impossible. How
[55:17] many believe that today? Do you really
[55:19] believe what the Bible it is and
[55:21] impossible because their names were for
[55:23] ordained before the foundation of the
[55:25] world? I I feel like running all over
[55:27] the building by election. He chose them
[55:29] and by predestination they know where
[55:32] they're going. He said, "There you are.
[55:33] You don't have to be afraid to worship.
[55:35] Afraid you're going to worship something
[55:37] wrong. You just believe what a prophet
[55:39] said."
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who could doubt that?" That's
[55:41] what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture.
[55:43] That's Paul's writing. That's what he
[55:44] taught his church, the church
[55:45] positionally. He said when God all of
[55:49] this in his labor pain was bringing
[55:50] forth bringing forth you know knowing
[55:53] what you would do he positionally placed
[55:56] you into his own body to be a housewife
[55:59] to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[56:01] prophet to be this or be that he placed
[56:03] you positionally and when we have come
[56:05] from the garlic lands of Egypt through
[56:07] sanctification and his baptizing in the
[56:09] promised land the promise of God is the
[56:11] Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the
[56:14] Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[56:16] till the day of your redemption. And God
[56:18] having predestinated the church, he
[56:20] said, "And all the peoples, there will
[56:21] be millions times millions will walk
[56:23] very religious and be deceived. But the
[56:26] only ones that will not be deceived will
[56:29] be those that have come over into the
[56:31] promised land who before the foundation
[56:33] of the world had their names put on the
[56:35] lamb's book of life has come over into
[56:37] the promised land and enjoying it."
[56:41] &gt;&gt; And enjoy. Let's not leave off that last
[56:43] part. The ones that will not be deceived
[56:45] are not those who are cowering down,
[56:47] hunkering down, scared to death to hear
[56:49] anybody preach, scared to death to go to
[56:51] a meeting because they might get
[56:52] deceived. But the ones, hallelujah, the
[56:55] ones who had their names put on lambs,
[56:56] put the lion is come over to the
[56:58] promised land and enjoying it. That's
[56:59] the ones that won't be deceived.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Many people are afraid you're going to
[57:03] act funny, he said.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Many people are afraid the Holy Ghost
[57:06] will make you do something you'll be
[57:08] ashamed of. Ashamed of people. Many
[57:11] people are afraid they'll cry and their
[57:12] sweetheart will see them crying. Oh no,
[57:18] mama or your neighbor
[57:20] &gt;&gt; or your boss will see you.
[57:23] There was a man named David.
[57:26] He tells about that how the he said he
[57:28] had been down the Philistine land. The
[57:30] the ark was coming back and said he had
[57:33] a little gown on him. He ran out there,
[57:34] kicked his feet in the air and jumped
[57:35] around, screamed and jumped.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Danced and jumped and danced. Come on.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And him, the king of Israel.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And his wife looked out the window and
[57:43] saw him acting so strange. She despised
[57:45] him.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; We haven't left the adoption sermon, by
[57:48] the way. That's what this is.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "The idiot, look at him out
[57:51] there. The way he's acting, throwing his
[57:52] feet up in the air, jumping around,
[57:53] acting like that, why he must be crazy."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; When he come in, she said in words like
[57:58] this, "Why you've embarrassed me? You,
[58:00] the king, my husband, out there doing
[58:01] like that, acting like that." David
[58:03] said, "Tomorrow I'll do better than
[58:04] that." Yes, sir. He said, "Don't you
[58:06] know I was dancing to the Lord. He
[58:08] crossed over." Hallelujah. He was in the
[58:11] land of the promise. He lost all self
[58:13] styles and muck of the world. He was so
[58:15] happy to know the ark was coming into
[58:16] his own city. I tell you, he said, "Some
[58:18] people's afraid to receive the Holy
[58:19] Ghost. Afraid they might speak with
[58:21] tongues." They're afraid somebody would
[58:22] say, "Now, he's one of them tongues
[58:23] guys. They're afraid to come to church
[58:25] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[58:26] Christ because they're ashamed of it."
[58:28] Somebody said, "I'll have to recall my
[58:29] tapes cuz I'd preach being baptized in
[58:31] the name of Jesus Christ." He said, "I
[58:33] ain't recalling them. I'm making more."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that's the attitude that he
[58:37] had.
[58:38] Amen. See, that's right. Making more.
[58:40] That is the Bible. If they don't like
[58:41] what we did yesterday, just watch what
[58:43] we're going to do tomorrow.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; That's the thing to do. See, just keep
[58:46] on going. There's no end to it because
[58:48] it's of the Lord. It's God.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. You don't have to
[58:55] worship like I worship, but let me
[58:57] worship in the freedom of the spirit of
[58:59] adoption.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to worship, let me worship
[59:03] under the message of the hour. Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; However, I worship.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; He said, you know what God did? He said,
[59:10] he looked down out of heaven and said,
[59:11] "David, you're a man after my own
[59:12] heart."
[59:13] &gt;&gt; David wasn't ashamed. He was a servant
[59:15] of the Lord. He loved the Lord. He was
[59:16] so happy, so overjoyed until he didn't
[59:18] think about human prestige.
[59:21] Brother Brandham talked about the sermon
[59:22] he preached that morning. And that
[59:23] morning, he preached the rejected king.
[59:26] He said, "We're so much afraid that we
[59:27] want a Saul to teach us. We want a Saul
[59:28] from some seminary to tell us how we
[59:30] must do our religion, how we must do
[59:32] it." Somebody said that that is on the
[59:33] other side of the Jordan.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; That's denominational.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; This side, the Holy Spirit leads.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Over here, you're out of that muck. Over
[59:43] here, you don't care what they think.
[59:45] Over here, you're dead and your life is
[59:47] hid in Christ and sealed by the Holy
[59:49] Ghost.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You don't care. You're living in Canaan.
[59:51] You can stand good corn.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a new creature in
[59:57] Christ Jesus. You're bound for the
[59:59] promised land. Let me hit this before I
[1:00:02] close. Some people are afraid to worship
[1:00:04] because of their past.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Like, you know, I know none of us
[1:00:14] understand the pain of another person's
[1:00:16] past.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Like, unless you walked in those shoes,
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; you don't know. And
[1:00:24] so, it's not just that I can tell you to
[1:00:26] be happy. You know,
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; well, that's good, but
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; you don't know what that person's been
[1:00:30] through.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; But I'll say this. If you really had a
[1:00:35] revelation what God did for you,
[1:00:37] your past ought to make you more
[1:00:40] of a worshipper.
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Because you know where you came from,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; And church, I I I didn't go out and sin
[1:00:53] and live in the world like that. I but I
[1:00:56] had a religious spirit and I know what I
[1:00:58] could have been and I know what my
[1:01:00] family then some of the things I come
[1:01:02] out of and had a brother tell me one
[1:01:04] time and said, "Brother Ben, you're a
[1:01:05] miracle and a pastor." And I look at
[1:01:07] that and it's true. My life is a
[1:01:09] miracle. The fact that I'm able to stand
[1:01:11] here today and and and preach to you is
[1:01:14] a miracle. And I believe there's many
[1:01:15] miracles sitting here in the building
[1:01:17] today. I got a lot of pain in my past,
[1:01:19] but he took away all my past and took
[1:01:23] away everything that I could have been
[1:01:25] and every mistake that I made. Aren't
[1:01:27] you glad for a God like that? Don't that
[1:01:29] make you want to worship? What was the
[1:01:30] opening of the seals? It was the removal
[1:01:33] of your past. Your your past was
[1:01:35] divorced from you. And when I recognize
[1:01:37] the opening of the word and I begin to
[1:01:38] see that, I become more of a worshipper
[1:01:41] than I'd ever been. Sometimes I do cry.
[1:01:43] Sometimes I do shout. Sometimes I do get
[1:01:47] excited, but it's because I know,
[1:01:48] brother JT, I know what he saved me
[1:01:51] from. I know what he brought me out of.
[1:01:53] I shouldn't have any right to be able to
[1:01:55] rightly divide the word based on what I
[1:01:57] was taught as a child, but I still God
[1:02:00] has given me the ability to be a pastor
[1:02:02] in the message of the hour. I said, God,
[1:02:04] it was all you. It didn't have nothing
[1:02:06] to do with me. It was all God. He gave
[1:02:08] me ability to understand the word. That
[1:02:10] was all him. He gave me a good wife.
[1:02:12] That was all him. Come on, church. That
[1:02:14] wasn't my own effort. That was all him.
[1:02:16] He gave me a family. That was all him.
[1:02:18] He gave us this church. That was all
[1:02:20] him. When we look at what we were, it
[1:02:22] ought to make us worship in freedom.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Look what I was. Look what he brought me
[1:02:28] to.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; I've got the scripture, but we won't
[1:02:31] read it. Luke chapter 7 tells about the
[1:02:34] woman who went to Simon's house. And
[1:02:39] Simon looks over there and he says,
[1:02:42] "See, he's not a prophet." that if he
[1:02:44] was a prophet, he wouldn't receive
[1:02:46] worship from her.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; How many Simon Pharisees do we have?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; If he was a prophet, he wouldn't receive
[1:02:53] worship from them
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; because of what they've been.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew better than anybody who
[1:02:59] she was,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He knew what she'd done.
[1:03:06] He knew Oh, God.
[1:03:09] She may not have been able to remember
[1:03:12] how many times she had failed God.
[1:03:15] How many times she'd fallen, how many
[1:03:17] times she'd done things wrong. She might
[1:03:19] have done it so much, believe she
[1:03:20] couldn't even remember anymore.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; He He knew it.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; But he also knew that as soon as she
[1:03:29] accepted his grace,
[1:03:31] she would be completely saved.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the blood that he would shed
[1:03:36] for her sins would completely wash her
[1:03:39] from every sin
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; and she would be the most righteous
[1:03:42] person in the building. That's why
[1:03:44] brother Brandham calls Simon in the
[1:03:46] Pharisee the worst sinner in the city.
[1:03:49] He's not talking about the woman. He's
[1:03:50] talking about Simon.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And so they come to Jesus and and he
[1:03:56] said and Jesus perceived their thoughts
[1:03:57] and he said he said man there was two
[1:04:00] two people. One was forgiven much and
[1:04:02] one was forgiven of a little bit. He
[1:04:04] said, "Which one loves the most?" He
[1:04:06] said, "The one who was forgiven the
[1:04:08] most." He said, "There you go."
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Don't let condemnation
[1:04:12] steal your praise. Don't let
[1:04:14] condemnation steal your joy. I know
[1:04:16] people, there's some people who say
[1:04:17] they've been saved, but they'll never
[1:04:19] take communion. Why not?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Just accept what he's done for you. You
[1:04:24] say, "Well, if I was a little bit
[1:04:25] better, I' i'd come to church. If I
[1:04:27] could quit doing this, that, or the
[1:04:28] other." Why don't you just accept what
[1:04:30] he did for you? He He's done enough. You
[1:04:33] don't have to add one bit to You don't
[1:04:35] have to uh give yourself a whooping
[1:04:37] every time you come to the house of God.
[1:04:38] Just say, "Lord, I accept what you did
[1:04:40] for me. I believe I'm a I'm a child, a
[1:04:44] son of God. I've been born into the
[1:04:45] kingdom of God. Don't matter what my
[1:04:47] past was. I'm a believer and I love
[1:04:49] you."
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; What are these things? They're
[1:04:52] scarecrows. Musicians come
[1:04:55] and we get ready to prepare for the
[1:04:56] communion service.
[1:04:59] They're scarecrows. Brother Brandham
[1:05:00] talked about how he had a garden one
[1:05:01] time and
[1:05:04] said he had this I got this written down
[1:05:06] as a scarecrow eating butter beans, but
[1:05:08] the scarecrow didn't eat butter beans.
[1:05:11] There was a groundhog. I saw the fattest
[1:05:14] groundhog in my life the other day.
[1:05:17] Looked at him and he resembled me.
[1:05:22] Had four or five chins hanging down. You
[1:05:24] know,
[1:05:26] he must have been eating some butter
[1:05:27] beans.
[1:05:29] But remember said this ground dog would
[1:05:30] come out eat butter bean. He said he
[1:05:31] made this scary. He thought it was
[1:05:33] pretty good. Scarecrow, you know, put it
[1:05:35] up there. He said the old groundhog come
[1:05:38] out there and he said the first time he
[1:05:39] saw that scarecrow, he's a little scared
[1:05:40] and he'd uh kind of shrink back from it
[1:05:44] and said but the groundhog just got to
[1:05:46] watching it. He said he realized that
[1:05:48] scarecrow stayed in the same place all
[1:05:49] the time.
[1:05:51] After a while he got to looking at it.
[1:05:53] He thought, you know what, that thing
[1:05:55] ain't real.
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:06:00] Oh, I wish we could get that revelation.
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:04] That thought the devil tries to put on
[1:06:05] you and say, "Well, you're not worthy.
[1:06:06] That thing ain't real. It's a
[1:06:08] scarecrow." That condemnation comes to
[1:06:10] your life, that thing ain't real. It's a
[1:06:12] scarecrow.
[1:06:14] That idea that once you come to the
[1:06:16] opening of the word, you just got to be
[1:06:17] quiet the rest of your life. That's a
[1:06:19] scarecrow. It's not what a prophet
[1:06:21] taught. It's just what we've made up.
[1:06:23] Just it's not real.
[1:06:26] Well, I don't want to be Pentecostal.
[1:06:28] That's a scarecrow.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; We just want to worship the Lord.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; We don't want no wild enthusiasm. What
[1:06:34] we want is a worship that God knows
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; from the depths of our heart.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That he he knows we want him to know it
[1:06:43] that we love him. So the little
[1:06:46] groundhog, he got he finally decided
[1:06:49] that was just a scarecrow. And so you
[1:06:51] know what he did? Brand said he just
[1:06:52] went on eating butter beans. He learned
[1:06:55] to ignore the scarecrow.
[1:06:59] It's always going to be there, church.
[1:07:01] But if you want the butter beans, if you
[1:07:03] want the goodness of God, you got to be
[1:07:06] willing to ignore the scarecrows and go
[1:07:08] ahead and eat. I'd say, let's eat the
[1:07:10] message of the hour. Let's eat the word
[1:07:12] that's been stored up. Let's let's eat
[1:07:15] let's partake of the good things of God.
[1:07:18] Not be afraid to do that. Would you bow
[1:07:20] your heads with me for a moment?
[1:07:23] was born to worship him in spirit
[1:07:26] and in truth. You have not received the
[1:07:29] spirit of bondage again to fear, but you
[1:07:32] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:07:35] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father."
[1:07:39] Oh God, what a promise that scripture
[1:07:42] is.
[1:07:44] Why don't we just talk to him for a
[1:07:45] moment? Heavenly Father,
[1:07:48] Lord, as we come to the the sweetness of
[1:07:51] a communion service,
[1:07:54] Lord, we thank you for what you've done
[1:07:56] for us.
[1:07:59] I thank you for healing my body. Thank
[1:08:02] you for saving my soul.
[1:08:05] Thank you for your goodness.
[1:08:08] What could I ever do to deserve that?
[1:08:10] Nothing. But Lord, I'll take the cup
[1:08:12] tonight.
[1:08:15] Oh God,
[1:08:17] Lord, if I've done anything that
[1:08:18] wouldn't be pleasing to you, forgive me,
[1:08:21] Lord,
[1:08:22] I know I have an advocate. These people
[1:08:25] have an advocate, Lord.
[1:08:28] Maybe there'd be somebody there' be some
[1:08:30] fear in their life because of things in
[1:08:32] the past. I pray you would remove that
[1:08:34] from them tonight.
[1:08:37] May they know the the love of God
[1:08:41] that overwhelms and floods out every
[1:08:44] like a mighty river floods out
[1:08:46] everything in its path.
[1:08:48] May your love come down over them today.
[1:08:51] And and they recognize they are sons and
[1:08:53] daughters of God as the four and 20
[1:08:55] elders fell down before the throne. And
[1:08:59] oh God
[1:09:01] began to worship
[1:09:04] and you have made us kings and priests.
[1:09:06] May we do the same today Lord. Lord as
[1:09:09] we come to communion service may we say
[1:09:11] Lord I thank you for your forgiveness.
[1:09:15] Thank you for your goodness. I pray,
[1:09:17] Lord, as it's already been prayed that
[1:09:18] you would heal. There would be healing
[1:09:20] in the communion line. Lord, I pray for
[1:09:23] Brother Gabe once again. Lord, I maybe
[1:09:25] he's already feeling better, but I pray
[1:09:27] God that you would just go down where
[1:09:29] he's at. And Sister Naomi, Lord, and was
[1:09:32] sick as well and different ones, Lord,
[1:09:34] that couldn't be here tonight. I pray,
[1:09:36] oh God.
[1:09:39] Lord, you said that not one of them
[1:09:41] would be lost. So, we're holding to
[1:09:44] that, Lord. We we hold you to your word
[1:09:47] today. We believe.
[1:09:50] Help our unbelief.
[1:09:52] I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
[1:09:55] I pray you'd touch every person in this
[1:09:57] building. May we know you're not just an
[1:09:59] emotion, but a reality, Lord. We can
[1:10:02] worship you for what you have done for
[1:10:03] us. For you grant it now. Thank you for
[1:10:06] all your goodness, your mercy that
[1:10:09] follows us all the days of our life.

[1:12:08] 1 Corinthians chap 11
[1:12:12] [Music]
[1:12:14] verse 23. For I have received of the
[1:12:16] Lord that which also delivered unto you
[1:12:20] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:12:22] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:12:25] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:12:26] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:12:29] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:12:33] remembrance of me.
[1:12:36] After the same manner also he took the
[1:12:37] cup when he had supper, saying, "This
[1:12:39] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:12:41] This do you as often as you drink it in
[1:12:44] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[1:12:47] eat this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:12:50] show the Lord's death till he come.
[1:12:51] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[1:12:53] bread, drink this cup of the Lord
[1:12:55] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:12:57] and blood of the Lord. But let a man
[1:13:00] examine himself, and so let him eat of
[1:13:01] that bread, drink of that cup. For he
[1:13:04] that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily,
[1:13:06] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[1:13:08] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:13:11] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:13:13] among you. Many sleep. For if we would
[1:13:16] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:13:17] judged.
[1:13:19] But when we are judged, we are chasened
[1:13:21] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:13:22] condemned with the world. Wherefore, my
[1:13:24] brethren, when you come together to eat,
[1:13:27] tear one for another, and if any man
[1:13:28] hunger, let him eat at home, that you
[1:13:30] come not together into condemnation.
[1:13:32] The rest will I set in order. I come,
[1:13:36] brothers, if you'd come.
[1:13:44] Oh, don't you love the Lord tonight?
[1:13:47] Amen.
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:57] Heavenly Father, hold in my hands the
[1:13:59] wine.
[1:14:01] Lord, it's time for your blood that was
[1:14:04] shed on Calvary. I thank you for that
[1:14:07] blood.
[1:14:09] Oh, how great a sacrifice you made for
[1:14:11] me.
[1:14:13] Lord, I pray that because your blood was
[1:14:16] shed for me and for each one here,
[1:14:19] Lord, that they've been bought by your
[1:14:22] blood, may I treat them in that way,
[1:14:23] Lord. Each one of us, may we treat one
[1:14:26] another well, Lord, because you bought
[1:14:28] each one of us in our own uniqueness,
[1:14:31] Lord. And even with our past and things
[1:14:34] that we had, but you paid for us, Lord,
[1:14:36] we belong to you. So we want to treat
[1:14:38] one another right. Lord as we hold even
[1:14:42] Lord the the the bread and Lord as type
[1:14:45] of your body Lord as we bread I pray God
[1:14:49] that you would you would it would be it
[1:14:52] was broken for us. I pray that our
[1:14:54] fellowship would not
[1:14:56] we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Lord Jesus
[1:15:01] also for the wine. I pray that you'd
[1:15:03] bless it Lord as it flows through our
[1:15:05] bodies. May we, oh God, may we receive
[1:15:08] that healing, Lord, that we so desire,
[1:15:10] body, spirit, and soul. Pray for you to
[1:15:13] grant it now in Jesus name. Amen. God
[1:15:16] bless you. This turtle will direct you
[1:15:18] as you come.
[1:15:20] [Music]

[1:26:36] on the cross of Calary.
[1:26:41] Oh, so every day my heart will praise
[1:26:45] him. Thank you, Lord. I know I'll ever
[1:26:49] be the same.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; The same.
[1:26:53] Oh,
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; and all I want to do is love him. Love
[1:26:59] his holy
[1:27:03] name.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. about to go into the footwashing
[1:27:08] service. And
[1:27:11] I uh want to say this before we read
[1:27:13] John chapter 13.
[1:27:17] I uh not very many churches do foot
[1:27:20] washing anymore. It's very very rare to
[1:27:22] do and it's a humbling experience
[1:27:26] and that's why we don't, you know, I
[1:27:28] know there's people today say, "Well,
[1:27:30] you can wash feet at home." That don't
[1:27:31] make any sense. It's about being a part
[1:27:34] of a body and it's about loving one
[1:27:37] another. And I want you to know tonight
[1:27:40] as your pastor that I love you. And I
[1:27:44] hope that you feel that. And
[1:27:49] you know
[1:27:51] we ought to have that love one for
[1:27:53] another.
[1:27:55] Brother Brandham talked about a time
[1:27:58] when the people at the tabernacle would
[1:28:01] come together and he said they'd
[1:28:04] cry because they had to leave one
[1:28:06] another on Wednesday night and had to
[1:28:09] leave one another for Sunday. I I see
[1:28:10] that in some of our kids, you know, they
[1:28:12] just really enjoy being around each
[1:28:14] other. I pray that would be the case
[1:28:16] with all of us. We don't want to we
[1:28:19] don't want to go to a church together
[1:28:21] and just be a cold bunch of people. We
[1:28:24] want to love one another. And Satan can
[1:28:27] get involved in that many times and try
[1:28:29] to do bad feelings and things, but let's
[1:28:33] just forgive one another. Just just let
[1:28:34] it go. Say, "Lord, I love I love you and
[1:28:37] I love your people. Just let it go."
[1:28:41] Human beings are
[1:28:44] We ain't much.
[1:28:46] We don't have much to brag about. None
[1:28:49] of us do. Yeah.
[1:28:53] If every one of us knew all of our
[1:28:55] failures and we displayed them out here
[1:28:56] on the screen, none of us would think
[1:28:57] much of each other.
[1:29:00] But what if we could come together and
[1:29:02] as we wash one another's feet say,
[1:29:04] "Lord, I thank you for my brother. Thank
[1:29:06] you for my sister.
[1:29:09] They may not, you know, be in my life
[1:29:11] all the time, but here at church, I get
[1:29:13] to fellowship with them, and they mean
[1:29:16] so much to me. You're going to be in
[1:29:17] heaven together one day. Might as well
[1:29:20] learn to get along." And getting along
[1:29:23] is just about not being stupid. I say it
[1:29:27] like that. I maybe I'm being a little
[1:29:30] bit free tonight, but let's not be
[1:29:33] stupid. Let's let's love one another.
[1:29:37] You young people, you get all the, you
[1:29:40] know, you get little things and you
[1:29:42] know, who wants to play what game and
[1:29:44] who wants to do this and who's who's
[1:29:47] dating who or who's going with this one
[1:29:50] and stuff like that. Let's just let that
[1:29:52] go. Love one another.
[1:29:55] Serve God with all of your heart and
[1:29:58] things will turn out okay. God's got a
[1:30:00] plan for your life. He It'll be okay.
[1:30:03] Amen. Do you love him tonight? I don't
[1:30:04] know why I said that, but maybe I'm just
[1:30:06] tired, but maybe the Lord has a way of
[1:30:09] speaking to us in our weakness.
[1:30:13] You love him tonight.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; This This is a great scripture. We just
[1:30:20] read this but John chapter 13 says
[1:30:26] said verse three Jesus knowing the
[1:30:28] father had given all things into his
[1:30:30] hands. Other words he had all the power
[1:30:34] that he was come from God went to God.
[1:30:38] What did he do with that knowledge?
[1:30:41] He riseth from supper, laid aside his
[1:30:45] garments, took a towel, and girded
[1:30:48] himself. After that, he pou water into a
[1:30:51] basin and begin to wash the disciples
[1:30:54] feet. He took the part of the footwash
[1:30:57] flunky, the lowest servant that there
[1:30:58] was.
[1:31:01] And cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter
[1:31:03] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[1:31:05] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:31:07] "What I do, thou knowest not now, but
[1:31:09] thou shalt know hereafter." Peter said
[1:31:12] unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my
[1:31:14] feet." Jesus answered him, "I if I wash
[1:31:16] thee not, thou hast no part with me."
[1:31:19] Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my
[1:31:21] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:31:23] head. Jesus saith to him, he that is
[1:31:25] washed needeth not, saved to wash his
[1:31:28] feet, and is but is clean every wit. And
[1:31:30] you are clean, but not all. For he knew
[1:31:32] who should betray him. Therefore, he
[1:31:34] said, "You are not all clean,
[1:31:38] but he washed Judah's feet, too."
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:46] After he had washed their feet, and
[1:31:48] taken his garments was set down again,
[1:31:50] he said to them, "Know ye what I have
[1:31:51] done to you? You call me Master and
[1:31:53] Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If
[1:31:56] I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:31:58] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[1:32:01] one another's feet. For I have given you
[1:32:03] an example, that you should do as I have
[1:32:06] done unto you, verily, verily, I say
[1:32:08] unto you, the servant is not greater
[1:32:10] than his Lord, neither he that is sent
[1:32:12] greater than he that sent him. If you
[1:32:14] know these things, happy are ye if you
[1:32:17] do them. I believe we could be happy
[1:32:19] tonight doing the word of God. Heavenly
[1:32:21] Father, we thank you for this time.
[1:32:25] Thank you for these people. Thank you
[1:32:27] for your blood. Thank you for
[1:32:30] Lord that you loved us first.
[1:32:33] When we were unlovable, Lord, you loved
[1:32:35] us. We thank you for that, Lord. I pray
[1:32:39] you just move, Lord, in this part of the
[1:32:41] service. May we not just rush through
[1:32:43] it, but Lord, may it be a part that we
[1:32:45] understand, Lord, we're doing this
[1:32:47] because you did this.
[1:32:50] Lord, may we look at that person that
[1:32:51] we're washing their feet as we're
[1:32:53] washing the your feet. Pray you'd grant
[1:32:56] it now. We ask you in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:32:59] God bless you. The brothers, we'll go
[1:33:02] back here. The deacons will direct you
[1:33:04] back there. The sisters in the back. God
[1:33:06] bless you tonight.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; I need
[1:33:10] thee. Oh,
[1:33:13] I need thee.
[1:33:16] Oh, do you need him tonight? Oh,
[1:33:21] every
[1:33:24] I need thee.
[1:33:28] Oh, won't you bless
[1:33:32] me now,
[1:33:35] my savior.
[1:33:40] Oh, I come
[1:33:44] to
[1:33:47] thee.
[1:33:49] Sing it one more time. Oh, I need
[1:33:54] thee. Oh,
[1:33:57] I need thee.

[1:34:38] thee. Oh
[1:34:41] I need thee.
[1:34:46] Oh,
[1:34:49] every hour
[1:34:52] I need thee.
[1:34:56] Oh, won't you bless
[1:35:00] me now,
[1:35:03] my savior?
[1:35:08] Oh, I come
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:11] to
[1:35:14] thee.
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:28] in the middle

[1:35:46] that man
[1:35:48] who died on Mount Calvary.
[1:35:54] The middleman
[1:35:56] made it possible
[1:35:59] that I could
[1:36:02] go free.
[1:36:05] Oh, I love
[1:36:09] that man
[1:36:12] in the middle.
[1:36:17] Oh, because I know
[1:36:20] he first
[1:36:22] loved me.
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:26] I'm singing praise to
[1:36:30] that man
[1:36:32] who died on Mount Calvary.
[1:36:38] The middleman
[1:36:40] made it possible
[1:36:43] I could
[1:36:46] go free.
[1:36:49] Oh, and there were
[1:36:53] a mountain.
[1:36:56] There were
[1:36:58] two thieves.
[1:37:01] There was a good man.
[1:37:05] Oh, there were two thieves.
[1:37:10] A man named
[1:37:12] Barabbus
[1:37:15] was condemned to a tree.
[1:37:19] Oh, but Jesus, he took the middle one
[1:37:24] and Barabus
[1:37:27] went free.
[1:37:30] Oh yes. Oh, I love I love the man
[1:37:36] in the middle.
[1:37:41] Oh, because I know
[1:37:45] he first
[1:37:47] loved me.
[1:37:51] singing praise to that man
[1:37:57] who died on Mount Calvary.
[1:38:02] The middleman
[1:38:04] made it possible
[1:38:07] that I could
[1:38:10] go free.
[1:38:14] When he reached
[1:38:17] down his hand
[1:38:20] for me,
[1:38:24] he had to reach
[1:38:27] all way down
[1:38:30] for me.
[1:38:34] Oh, I was lost
[1:38:37] and undone

[1:38:50] before me.
[1:38:53] I was nearing
[1:38:56] despair
[1:38:58] when he came
[1:39:01] to me there
[1:39:03] and he showed
[1:39:06] me that I
[1:39:08] could be free.
[1:39:13] Oh, then he lifted

[1:47:04] its power.
[1:47:08] Oh, the blood
[1:47:11] that Jesus
[1:47:14] shed
[1:47:17] for me.
[1:47:21] Oh, way back on Calary.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:30] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[1:47:35] Oh, from day
[1:47:38] to day.
[1:47:40] It will never
[1:47:43] lose
[1:47:46] its power.
[1:47:49] Oh, for it reaches
[1:47:53] to the highest
[1:47:57] mountain.
[1:47:58] Yes, it does.
[1:48:00] And it flows
[1:48:04] to the lowest
[1:48:07] valley
[1:48:09] for you and me.
[1:48:11] It's the blood that gives me strength
[1:48:17] from day
[1:48:19] to day.
[1:48:22] It will never
[1:48:25] lose
[1:48:27] its power.
[1:48:32] And it soothes
[1:48:35] my doubts
[1:48:38] and it calms
[1:48:40] calms my fears.
[1:48:44] Oh yes. and it dries all
[1:48:51] of my tears.
[1:48:53] It's the blood that gives me strength
[1:48:59] from day
[1:49:01] to day.
[1:49:04] It will never
[1:49:07] lose
[1:49:09] its power.
[1:49:12] Oh yes, it reaches
[1:49:16] to the highest
[1:49:20] mountain.
[1:49:23] Oh, and it flows
[1:49:27] to the lowest

[1:49:33] Aren't you glad that his blood still
[1:49:37] gives me strength
[1:49:40] from day
[1:49:43] to day.
[1:49:45] It will never
[1:49:48] lose.
[1:49:50] Oh, sing that chorus again with all your
[1:49:52] hearts. Now, let me hear you sing it.
[1:49:54] Oh, for it reaches
[1:49:58] to the highest.
[1:50:02] Oh, yes it does.
[1:50:04] Oh, I'm glad that it still flows
[1:50:08] through the lowest
[1:50:11] valley.
[1:50:14] Oh, is the blood
[1:50:18] that gives me strength
[1:50:21] from day
[1:50:24] to day.
[1:50:26] It will never
[1:50:30] I wonder if we could stand and sing that
[1:50:31] chorus again with all your hearts now.
[1:50:35] Oh yes, it reaches
[1:50:39] to the highest
[1:50:42] mountain. And aren't you glad about it
[1:50:45] here tonight? Oh, and it flows
[1:50:49] to the lowest
[1:50:53] valley.
[1:50:55] Oh yes, it's the blood that gives me
[1:51:00] strength
[1:51:02] from day
[1:51:05] to day.
[1:51:07] It will never
[1:51:10] lose
[1:51:12] its power. If you believe that here
[1:51:14] tonight, I wonder if you put a hand up
[1:51:15] and sing it one more time. For it
[1:51:18] reaches
[1:51:20] to the highest.
[1:51:23] Aren't you glad about the blood here
[1:51:24] this evening?
[1:51:26] Oh, and it flows
[1:51:30] to the lowest
[1:51:34] lowest valley for me and you. Oh, the
[1:51:38] blood still gives me strength. Yes, it
[1:51:42] does. From day
[1:51:46] to day,
