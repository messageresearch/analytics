[29:41] amen you can be seated this morning
[29:47] amen for there is one mediator between
[29:50] god and man jesus christ
[29:52] amen he's there before the father i
[29:55] believe this morning
[29:56] i mean he's there before the father as a
[29:59] mediator to bring up
[30:00] a restoration between god and man
[30:04] amen to bring a restoration of that
[30:06] relationship
[30:07] and fellowship that man had before the
[30:10] fall
[30:11] i mean he's there at the throne of mercy
[30:14] with his body
[30:15] and the blood amen as a sacrifice for
[30:18] you and i do you believe that this
[30:19] morning
[30:20] amen he's on the throne and then he's in
[30:22] control here today
[30:25] and then he's at that at that throne
[30:28] amen
[30:28] until every name that is in the lamb's
[30:31] book of life has been redeemed there
[30:34] there he will be as a mediator as an
[30:37] intercessor for you and i amen to
[30:40] to bring that relationship to god and
[30:42] man to his waiver children
[30:44] amen to for that relationship to be
[30:46] restored
[30:48] amen before the fall god would come down
[30:51] in the cool of the evening and
[30:52] and they would worship god and have
[30:54] perfect fellowship
[30:56] a minute god longs for our fellowship i
[30:58] mean that's why he created man
[31:01] amen so that he could have someone to
[31:02] fellowship with amen
[31:04] amen someone that would worship him as
[31:07] his children
[31:09] and i believe that the voice of the lord
[31:11] god is still crying
[31:13] amen to his way with children amen where
[31:15] art thou
[31:18] and then he's still there as mediator
[31:20] still upon the throne of man calling out
[31:23] him in the voice of the lord god and the
[31:25] prophet said
[31:26] he said in the church age book he said
[31:28] if i can accomplish
[31:29] one thing i will be satisfied amen to
[31:32] see
[31:33] a true see established a true spiritual
[31:36] relationship between god and man
[31:38] where people become new creations filled
[31:41] with the spirit
[31:42] amen and live according to his word amen
[31:46] that's what we've been called to in this
[31:47] day and hour
[31:48] amen not just to be a bunch of church
[31:50] goers or just to say that we believe the
[31:52] message amen but to live
[31:54] according to the word amen that god has
[31:56] provided us a message amen
[31:58] to restore us a messenger and a message
[32:00] to restore us back to the word
[32:02] amen that we can we can come to the new
[32:04] birth we can come aim unto the
[32:06] indwelling of the spirit of god
[32:08] amen something that would bring us amen
[32:10] past denominations
[32:11] pass man's idea back to the word back to
[32:14] what they had
[32:15] at pentecost amen whereas people can
[32:18] live according to his word where we can
[32:20] live
[32:20] victorious lives in this last days in
[32:23] laodicea
[32:25] amen so that was the desire of the
[32:27] prophet amen to see
[32:28] a true relationship amen established
[32:32] amen not he said not to for to ever
[32:34] think that
[32:35] i would want people to follow me or or
[32:37] come to my church or or that she would
[32:39] start a fellowship but i want he wanted
[32:41] to see that
[32:42] that relationship that true spiritual
[32:44] relationship established
[32:48] amen amen and
[32:51] he said hear his voice in this hour amen
[32:53] and yield completely to him
[32:56] that was the call of the messenger to
[32:57] hear the voice of the word
[32:59] to hear the voice of the spirit and to
[33:01] completely yield to him not to bring
[33:02] people to himself
[33:04] or to his church but to bring him to the
[33:06] word
[33:08] where the real change can take place
[33:10] amen
[33:12] amen to bring them to christ amen not
[33:15] just to get people to a church or an
[33:17] idea but to bring them to christ to a
[33:19] living god
[33:22] and there is one mediator as we read and
[33:24] we'll just look at
[33:25] at this word just for a moment and that
[33:27] word mediator is a person who attempts
[33:29] to make people involved
[33:31] in a conflict come to an agreement a
[33:34] go-between
[33:35] amenity is our goal between this morning
[33:37] he is our negotiator
[33:39] he is able to make a way amen and he
[33:41] stands between us and our troubles
[33:43] and and the things that come against us
[33:45] amen he's able to make a way this
[33:47] morning
[33:48] amen he's able as mediator amen if for a
[33:51] sinner someone that's lost someone
[33:53] that's wondering
[33:54] amen and the voice of the lord god would
[33:56] call to them he's there as a mediator to
[33:58] bring you into the fold
[33:59] even to bring you to god
[34:04] it also means that that word mediator
[34:06] means
[34:07] another word for that would be arbiter a
[34:10] person who settles a dispute
[34:12] who has ultimate authority in the matter
[34:15] amen he sits this morning
[34:17] as mediator he sits this morning as
[34:19] arbiter he's got
[34:20] all authority in every matter amen he's
[34:22] been given all authority and power
[34:25] in heaven and earth amen he is our
[34:27] absolute amen an absolute

[34:32] unlimited
[34:33] in power that's who our lord is this
[34:35] morning amen he is
[34:36] perfect within himself and he is
[34:38] unlimited
[34:40] in what he can do amen and god can do
[34:43] anything this morning but he cannot fail
[34:45] and then he cannot lie amen god can do
[34:48] many things but he cannot do that
[34:52] and then he's there's mediator to
[34:54] intervene amen and that word is to come
[34:57] between
[34:58] as to as to prevent or alter a result
[35:01] or course of events and then he's able
[35:04] to change the situation
[35:06] amen he is able to make a difference and
[35:09] he
[35:09] himself makes the difference amen when
[35:11] he comes on the scene
[35:12] and he's able to change the situation
[35:15] amen because he
[35:16] is god because he is our mediator
[35:19] he is our intercessor the one amen that
[35:21] we can go
[35:22] to by prayer that we can talk to amen
[35:25] that we can interact with
[35:26] amen not just some dead person that's
[35:28] gone on amen as catholicism will portray
[35:31] amen some dead being a man but he's a
[35:33] living god
[35:34] amen he's someone that can hear your
[35:35] voice he can hear you when you speak
[35:37] amen amen and when you begin to speak
[35:40] that's when god amen our intercessor
[35:42] jesus christ
[35:43] can act on our behalf
[35:46] amen so the scripture says he gave
[35:48] himself for a ransom
[35:50] amen and that word ransom is what is
[35:52] given in exchange for another
[35:54] as a prize of his redemption and then he
[35:57] gave himself a ransom
[35:59] and then he purchased our redemption
[36:01] with his own life
[36:02] and then he gave him himself in exchange
[36:05] for me
[36:05] and then he took my place amen and he
[36:08] was able to pay that price of redemption
[36:10] i want to say this morning amen you're
[36:12] worth more than fourteen hundred dollars
[36:14] and then you're worth more than just
[36:16] some some what the world says about you

[36:19] but we are purchased amen with the blood
[36:21] of jesus

[37:59] amen made a way through the blood he
[38:01] made a way amen to the
[38:03] through the lamb through the innocent
[38:05] one and then he's made a way for us this
[38:07] morning we can come to god we can
[38:09] approach god

[42:21] of the heavenly calling amen and we have
[42:25] a faithful high priest this morning
[42:27] that has passed into the heavens
[42:33] and brother branham says here in the
[42:34] revelation of jesus christ
[42:36] we just want to go through these things
[42:38] for a little bit he said on earth he was
[42:40] the prophet
[42:42] in glory he's the priest coming he's the
[42:44] king
[42:45] oh i like that prophet faithful witness
[42:47] of the word
[42:49] priest with his own blood before god
[42:52] and king king of saints not king of the
[42:54] world now he's king of the of saints and
[42:56] we have earthly kings over them people
[42:58] but we have a king too
[43:00] in the kingdom and that's the reason
[43:02] that we act different
[43:03] amen so he comes as prophet priests and
[43:06] king
[43:06] he comes as son of man son of god and
[43:09] the coming son of david
[43:11] he said i am he that was which is and
[43:13] shall come
[43:14] amen he's everything that you could have
[43:16] needed of this morning
[43:17] and then he's come in jesus christ and
[43:20] he's expressed his attributes and
[43:22] he's expressed himself to his people so
[43:26] his prophet
[43:27] as brother branham said he was the
[43:28] faithful witness to the word
[43:30] and in the beginning the bible says was
[43:32] the word and the word was with god
[43:34] and the word was god and the word was
[43:36] made flesh and dwelt among us
[43:38] jesus christ becoming the word amen amen
[43:41] in that son of man ministry amen in that
[43:44] form
[43:44] there he reveals himself to his church
[43:47] he makes himself
[43:48] known to his church to his elect to
[43:51] those that can receive him
[43:52] he makes himself known amen he was the
[43:56] fullness of the godhead bodily
[43:58] all that god was he that he dwelt in in
[44:01] jesus the fullness of god dwelt in him
[44:03] and god expressing his attributes
[44:06] through his son
[44:07] it was god making himself man amen that
[44:10] he could reveal and express himself
[44:12] to his people in all that god was he
[44:15] expressed
[44:16] in christ god's attributes
[44:20] being revealed being expressed in the
[44:22] son of man
[44:23] in the word amen and the word is still
[44:26] expressing itself to you and i
[44:27] am in the revealing of the word it's the
[44:29] same jesus christ
[44:30] he's the same yesterday today and
[44:32] forever it's the same god
[44:34] amen it's the same god same yesterday
[44:37] today and forever
[44:39] so here comes the son of man amen his
[44:42] prophet
[44:43] and he comes as priest and as priest he
[44:46] took his own blood and went before the
[44:48] father
[44:49] that's where he is this morning there
[44:51] amen with his own blood
[44:53] with that body amen before god amen the
[44:57] lamb of god there with his blood atoning
[44:59] and interceding
[45:00] on our behalf see god required a
[45:02] sacrifice for our sins
[45:04] for us to be able to come to full
[45:06] redemption and when the blood of bulls
[45:08] and goats would only cover
[45:09] the one who brought it until god's own
[45:12] blood would be shed
[45:13] amen and i believe this morning that
[45:15] there's power in the blood
[45:16] amen i believe that that's where the
[45:17] life is this morning and then it's not
[45:19] in our man-made
[45:21] ideology and the things that we can come
[45:23] up with amen but there's a religion this
[45:25] morning

[45:38] power in the blood this morning

[45:42] the blood of jesus the bible says speaks
[45:44] of better things
[45:45] than that of abel amen this morning it

[45:51] healing it speaks of joy this morning
[45:53] it speaks of power amen it speaks of
[45:56] life
[45:58] it speaks of greater things than the
[46:00] things of this earth the things of this
[46:02] life amen there's something greater
[46:03] amen in the blood has a voice this
[46:06] morning and it is his word
[46:08] the life is in the blood the holy ghost
[46:10] itself amen
[46:11] on calvary amen when that blood cell was
[46:14] broken in and it released the life
[46:16] of the blood in that blood that life is
[46:18] the holy ghost
[46:19] it's the literal life of jesus christ
[46:21] and by the shedding of the blood
[46:23] that has come back upon the believer
[46:30] do you believe that this morning amen i
[46:34] believe with all my heart
[46:37] there's power in the blood so there
[46:39] there the priest sits before the father
[46:41] there this morning on the throne with
[46:43] his own blood
[46:44] with his body with that sacrifice there
[46:46] he sits this morning

[47:10] amen that blood bleach when you confess
[47:12] that your sin

[48:17] victory in my life just as king david
[48:19] amen the coming king they knew that he
[48:21] was coming king and when they followed
[48:23] after david amen because david had the
[48:25] anointing amen and that's why we follow
[48:27] after the word of the lord
[48:28] in this hour and then because the
[48:30] anointing is there because it's what we
[48:32] had need of amen then we follow after
[48:34] that
[48:34] amen and that's where the victory lies

[49:50] him in the wedding supper
[49:51] our meals our melchizedek our lord jesus
[49:53] christ
[49:55] and we'll have communion with him amen
[49:58] when this world is going on in chaos
[50:00] when the tribulation set in will be
[50:02] tucked away
[50:02] safe in the arms of jesus he's the
[50:05] coming king
[50:11] amen so he's coming into power he's the
[50:13] coming king
[50:14] he's prophet priest and king
[50:18] so he come as man amen he came
[50:21] he came and god became man
[50:24] amen and god became man and he became me
[50:27] that i might become him by grace
[50:30] he became a partaker as the bible says
[50:34] in hebrews 2 and 14 it says for as much
[50:37] then as the children
[50:38] are partakers of flesh and blood he also
[50:41] himself likewise took part of the same
[50:44] that through death he might destroy him
[50:46] that had the power
[50:47] of death that is the devil and deliver
[50:49] them
[50:50] through fear of death who through fear
[50:52] of death
[50:53] were all their lifetimes subject to
[50:55] bondage
[50:56] for fairly he took not on him the nature
[50:58] of angels
[50:59] but he took on him the seed of abraham
[51:02] and wherefore in all things it behooved
[51:04] him to
[51:04] be made like unto his brethren that he
[51:07] might be a merciful and high priest
[51:10] in the things pertaining to god to make
[51:12] reconciliation for the sins of the
[51:13] people
[51:14] for in that he himself has suffered
[51:16] being tempted he is able to secure those
[51:19] them that are tempted amen so god became
[51:22] man
[51:23] and man he took not on him the nature of
[51:25] angels
[51:26] and man god didn't just come down and
[51:28] poof into a body
[51:30] and we know that god is able to do that
[51:32] but god
[51:33] came the same way jesus came the same
[51:35] way you did amen through a birth
[51:37] he came amen through a spoken word birth
[51:40] we know these things but he came
[51:41] amen he came as a baby he came as a
[51:44] child he came as a young adult
[51:46] he came as a man and meant to be
[51:48] partakers of this
[51:50] life of the life that you and i live
[51:53] amen so he himself came to be partaker
[51:57] of this same life the same
[51:58] life that we live this humanity this
[52:01] humanity
[52:02] brother brahman said in one spot he came
[52:03] and humiliated himself
[52:06] god became man so that he could know how
[52:08] you feel to know to know how
[52:10] how how it would be to go through the
[52:12] things of this life i mean
[52:14] he knows what it's like to be sick he
[52:16] knows what it's it's like to have
[52:17] trouble
[52:18] and nobody came it came amen and he was
[52:21] victorious
[52:22] he came that he might destroy him that
[52:24] had the power of death
[52:25] that is the devil he came that he might
[52:27] to overcome
[52:28] he came that he might destroy the devil
[52:30] himself the mighty
[52:32] conqueror he came and overcame for you
[52:35] and i
[52:38] amen to bring a deliverance
[52:41] so he laid down his life he gave his own
[52:44] life amen he became a partaker so that
[52:46] we
[52:47] we could be partakers of him this
[52:49] morning amen that's why he came
[52:52] that's why he came that we could be
[52:53] partakers of him amen that he could
[52:55] bridge the gap
[52:56] amen that he could bridge the gap amen
[52:58] and we could have someone
[53:00] amen a human sacrifice amen a human amen
[53:03] because the nature of an
[53:04] animal couldn't come back upon the
[53:06] believer those that made that sacrifice
[53:08] amen but when we had a kinsmen redeemer
[53:10] one like a swan that came and lived
[53:12] amen he came and had troubles he came
[53:14] and had sickness
[53:15] he came and had all these things that we
[53:17] go through amen and
[53:18] then he came and overcame and he gave us
[53:20] life amen and then that life can come
[53:22] back upon you and i
[53:24] am and we can become partakers a man of
[53:27] that divine
[53:28] nature amen we can become partakers of
[53:30] eternal life of eternal joy this morning
[53:33] amen he did that for you and i
[53:36] amen he was made like unto you and i
[53:38] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[53:41] high priest
[53:42] and the things pertaining to god and to
[53:44] bring a reconciliation
[53:46] amen and he abides now as our great high
[53:48] priest
[53:50] amen he who has overcome he amen
[53:53] amen who conquered everything for you
[53:55] and i
[53:57] you believed that this morning
[54:05] ephesians 4 8.
[54:10] catch my breath here
[54:14] ephesians 4 8 wherefore he saith
[54:18] when he ascended up on high he led
[54:19] captivity captive
[54:21] and gave gifts unto men amen so jesus
[54:24] overcame he
[54:25] he was a partaker of this life amen but
[54:28] he came
[54:29] as a man amen but he overcame and he
[54:32] ascended
[54:33] amen but what is it but that he also
[54:35] descended first into the lower parts of
[54:37] the earth
[54:38] and he that descended as the same that
[54:40] also ascended
[54:41] up far above all heavens that he might
[54:43] feel
[54:44] all things amen so he was raised for our
[54:48] justification
[54:50] amen he conquered death he he
[54:53] the same one that ascended descended so
[54:56] he
[54:56] he overcame death hell and the grave and
[54:59] then he overcame everything
[55:01] and then he stands this morning as a
[55:03] mighty conqueror and brother brahm said
[55:04] he conquered both worlds of the scene
[55:07] and the unseen eminently led captivity
[55:10] captive
[55:10] and gave gifts unto men he ascended far
[55:13] above all heavens that he might fill all
[55:14] things
[55:15] and then he ascended amen that he might
[55:17] feel all things i think that's beautiful
[55:19] that he might come
[55:20] amen and fill my life that he might come
[55:22] and fill your life
[55:23] and then he ascended amen but he didn't
[55:25] just stay there amen but he sent back
[55:27] the holy ghost
[55:28] i mean him to bring the power of god
[55:31] upon his people
[55:32] amen to anoint his church and
[55:35] and to set in his church gifts to
[55:38] represent him
[55:39] to the people amen so he came
[55:43] amen he came to anoint his people amen i
[55:46] believe this morning he's looking for
[55:48] someone that he can anoint

[55:51] power of god and with someone that he
[55:53] can have

[1:02:54] so let us hold fast our profession as we
[1:02:57] read earlier for he is the high priest
[1:02:59] of our
[1:02:59] confession so your confession it's a
[1:03:02] profession
[1:03:03] and that word means whom we profess to
[1:03:06] be ours
[1:03:07] or what one presses professes
[1:03:10] amen so whom we profess our high priest
[1:03:13] who is passing the heavens
[1:03:15] intercedes upon our confession and our
[1:03:17] revelation of who he
[1:03:19] is and what he has done amen we believe
[1:03:22] his word
[1:03:23] you believe his word you accept his word
[1:03:26] and then you confess him and when you do
[1:03:28] that when you confess it then brother
[1:03:30] braham said then god
[1:03:31] can go to acting on your behalf but not
[1:03:34] until you confess it has to come forth
[1:03:36] from your lips and when you do that he
[1:03:38] goes to interceding
[1:03:39] on your behalf he begins to work for you
[1:03:43] and i
[1:03:44] am it's our profession it's our
[1:03:46] testimony
[1:03:48] amen we we live what we believe if you
[1:03:50] believe something and then if you
[1:03:51] believe something is yours
[1:03:53] you accept it you live it you believe it
[1:03:55] that's your testimony it becomes a part
[1:03:57] of who you are
[1:03:58] i mean it's what you say it's what you
[1:04:00] do it's what you live
[1:04:01] i mean it's a declaration your
[1:04:03] profession that's a declaration of what
[1:04:05] you believe
[1:04:06] and what do we believe this morning we
[1:04:08] believe his word amen because that's
[1:04:09] what we've been called to
[1:04:10] amen those are that's what we're heir to
[1:04:13] where those are our promises
[1:04:14] and that's what god has told us and we
[1:04:16] accepted it that it's for us but it's
[1:04:18] also a declaration
[1:04:20] of whom you believe and i believe this
[1:04:22] morning he's faithful and true
[1:04:23] and that he's a faithful high priest
[1:04:25] he's faithful to his people
[1:04:27] he's not some distant god amen but right
[1:04:29] now amen he's not an impersonal god but
[1:04:31] right now
[1:04:32] and then he's governing in the affairs
[1:04:34] of men he's governing in the affairs
[1:04:36] of our lives amen he's our creator he's
[1:04:39] our sustainer in this life
[1:04:47] amen amen so our profession it's a
[1:04:50] declaration in whom we believe
[1:04:52] amen and we've got to take a stand in
[1:04:54] this hour and you've got to take a stand
[1:04:56] on what you believe and whom you believe
[1:04:58] amen amen you've got to take a stand
[1:05:00] amen we've got to stand there as a
[1:05:02] people
[1:05:02] and then when you when you believe
[1:05:04] something when you believe for something
[1:05:05] and then you've got to stand there and
[1:05:07] be unmovable
[1:05:09] because satan's going to try to shake
[1:05:10] you off of it he's going to tell you
[1:05:12] that it's not yours that it's not for
[1:05:14] you that you're not good enough
[1:05:16] not good enough but we don't have to be
[1:05:17] good enough and remember we've just got
[1:05:19] to take a stand on his word

[1:05:30] in whom we have believed
[1:05:34] amen for we're living we're living in a
[1:05:37] shaking time
[1:05:38] an unstable time it's a time of
[1:05:40] uncertainty amen but i believe we have
[1:05:42] one that we can go to we can be certain
[1:05:43] of god this morning
[1:05:45] amen we can say like paul that i know
[1:05:47] and whom i have believed
[1:05:49] and then persuaded that he is able to
[1:05:51] keep that which i have committed to him
[1:05:53] is that the god you served this morning
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:56] do you believe that this morning that
[1:05:58] he's able to keep whatever we commit to
[1:06:00] him whatever we go to him and then he's
[1:06:01] able to act on our behalf
[1:06:03] and when his works are finished
[1:06:05] everything that we have need of
[1:06:07] is in him in isaiah 53 and 4
[1:06:12] says surely he had borne our griefs and
[1:06:15] carried our sorrows
[1:06:17] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:06:19] of god
[1:06:20] and afflicted he was wounded for our
[1:06:23] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:06:25] iniquity
