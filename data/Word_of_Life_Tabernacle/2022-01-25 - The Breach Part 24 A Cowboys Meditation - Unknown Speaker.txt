doors [Music] but now he comes from here at this last seal he's no longer mediator he's king now and what does he do if he's a king he has to have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption and now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights and even those who are alive and remain till his coming shall not hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound to that last trumpet on the right seal is broken when the seventh angel is giving his message the last trumpet shall sound and that deadly christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet him in the air he claims he's come forth now to claim his his procession watch look at this my broke the seals reveal the mysteries reveal them where to the last church age the only one that's living the rest of them sleeping he said if he comes to the first watch second watch third watch all down to the seventh watch in the seventh watch there went out a command or call behold the bridegroom coming and when they did the sleeping virgin phenomenal churches said oh you know i believe i'd like to have that holy ghost have you noticed the presbyterians and episcopalians did you hear my message in phoenix to that man who's standing up in the voice and there and saying well what's the matter with this author saying holy father so and so when the bible said call no man father amen amen they're sleeping with them that's a reason but when they come forth and said yeah we believe a woman just called up another woman said you know i'm episcopalian said i i spoke in tongues of the day i believe i received the holy ghost don't tell nobody i doubt that very much you might have spoke with tongues but you said a man on fire how is he going to sit still hey could you imagine peter and james and john and i'm up in the upper room saying oh we got the holy ghost now but maybe very sticky brother through winter's doors [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's right and remember while they went to try to buy oral remember the scriptures doesn't say they got it but while they were out trying to abide there come a sound happened all those virgins that slept rose and trimmed their lamps and went into the supper is that right yeah and the rest was left for the tribulation period that's right right weeping wailing and national team that's the church not the bride the church the bride went in there's a whole difference between the church and the bride yes sir went into the wedding supper oh notice boy the seals was broke why in the last church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride see oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now what is it out of the dust the earth out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere they were placed out of out of the regions of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be you'll call and they'll answer [Applause] amen he'll call and they'll answer he come to get his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it and time is no more at that time time has run out it's finished all right he leaves the throne of to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be alive king to bring the world to judgment who has rejected his message he's not a mediator remember the old testament teaching now as we hurry when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it judgment scene i'm one of the lamb's slammed walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then he become not a lamb but a lie he and he calls for his queen that's come stand by son no you're not the saint shall judge the earth daniel said the judgment was set and the books were open and ten thousands times ten thousands of thousands minister to him king and queen and then another book which is the book of life that's for the church and the queen and the king stood there as a cowboys meditation so last night as i laid on the prairie i gazed to the stars in the skies and i wondered if ever a cowboy could drift to that suite by and by that is a road to that bright happy region but it's damn their trail so they say but the broad one that leads to perdition is posted and blazed all the way they speak of another great owner he's speaking in the terms of his catalog because they were in a roundup you can see a plane they speak of another great owner and he's never overstocked so they say he'll always make room for a sinner that'll drift on that straightener away [Applause] they say he will never forsake you and he knows every action and look for for safety we'd better get branded have our name on his great tally book far they say there will be a great roundup when cowboys like doggies will stand to be marked by the writers of judgment and prophets and seers that's posted in those every brand there's even a roundup see the boys stand out there in the rhinos and milling in that herd of cattle he'll see his own brand go by and he'll motion to the boss the boss will sit and give him the nod his pony runs right in a round around this milling cropping bunch of horns like that and cut his own cows out see they say there will be a great round up and cowboys like doggies will stand that will be marked by the writers of judgment it's posted in those every brain amen so he said i guess i will be a straight yearling just a man that's condemned our unbranded he either makes soup out of him that'll be cut in the bunch with the rusties when the boss of those riders come by see who it is the boss of the writers that's the lamb to the seven messengers who's posted in those every branch um notice here he comes leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slaying lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment that's rejected our kinsmen redeemer then is king over all why he's got the title deed of redemption and all lays within his hand i'm glad i know him then claims his inheritance that's the church the bride he claims it what does he do then he disposes of his contestant satan he throws him into a lake of fire with all those who was inspired by satan to reject his word of redemption amen he's king now mercy's still on the throne don't you reject his offer the writers know just who you are now this contestant who's giving trouble for two thousand years claiming i can do it and what i want to i still have them they're mine oh they forfeit the title back there but he's the kinsman redeemer he said he's back there making intercessions now but someday he said i'll put him in the grave but he told the church i'll bring you out but first i've got to be an intercessor knight comes forth steps out from eternity back on earth and hope for the throne of the father amen where he said as an intercessor now he comes to be king oh to rule all nations with a lot of iron judgment is set oh brother our kinsmen redeemer holds it all that's right yes sir what does he do he calls that contestant's hand satan they're mine now i've raised them up from the grave and it takes all the liars and the perverters of the word and all like that with satan and destroys them in the lake of fowler she's all over now throws them in a lake of fire oh man you know what i want i want to say something here before we close right and then we'll we'll hurry notice we're down now to the seventh verse but from the eighth verse to the 14th i want you to notice what takes place all that was in heaven and all that was in the earth just listen to this let me just read it i believe it'd be better if i just read the other book with the seventh first see and watch the sixth verse and i and i behold beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been saying having seven heads a seven horns of mean and seven eyes we just explained which are the seven spirits of god sent forth to all the earth see seven church ages the seven messengers that kept that far burning see all right and he came the lamb and took the book out of the right hand of him that's set up on the throne set up on the throne a watch and when he done that watch what taking place you talk about a jubilee man this is exactly the breaking them seals take place we're getting a half hour of silence just after this watch this and we start in we finish this up next sunday night right here and listen close now are you ready say amen listen close what took place when he did this when all creation was groaning no one knows what to do and john was weaving here come the lamb walked over and this book was in the hands of of the original owner because man had fell and lost it and no man was able to take it anymore to redeem the earth no priest pope nothing as it said but the lamb come up no mary no saint this or saying that the lamb come the bloody sand and tucked the book out of the right hand of him and set up on the throne and when they seen there was a redeemer and all the the souls on the altar when the angels when the elders when the everything seen it when this is done it lays in the future tonight he's a mediator but he's coming to this watch and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints that's those that started the altar that have prayed for long ago see they have prayed for redemption prayed for resurrection and here's these evers are pouring out the prayers before god now we've got a representative we've got a kinsman in heaven that's come forth to make his claims and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to bow your heads with me if you would just a moment for prayer heavenly father we're thankful to be able to come today though it's virtual lord but we're thankful to be able to come to your word we're thankful to be a word believing people we're thankful lord that you keep us even through trying hours lord i pray that for safety for each one of the folks that would be out there tonight and each one with the snow in the eyes i pray you bless them lord help them keep them safe on the roads if they have to go to work tomorrow lord we pray for those that are sick right now and in need lord especially with covet and these different things that have been happening lord we pray that you'd move on their behalf tonight and that you'd speak directly to them and lord we pray that you would speak to us through your word tonight lord i believe that you can do that lord if we believe that you are the same yesterday today and forever then you are the same right now as you ever were and so we thank you for that and we trust and we believe that your word that has power in it lord would go and and cut us under the the bone and the moral lord the things that we don't need lord cut that away from us tonight the things that we do need add that to us lord and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise we thank you for bringing us together again in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight it's good to uh be with you by way of internet tonight and we're gonna go right into our breach study that we've been uh working on for a while now as you heard i played just a little bit of the tape that'll be part of what we're studying on tonight i titled this a cowboys meditation and and we're going to read first if you want to stand where you're at you're welcome to do that daniel chapter 7 and verse 9 daniel chapter 7 and verse 9 and we'll stand and read the word it says this i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire oh i want to see him like that don't you a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him so there were thousand thousands or millions that ministered unto him and tens of millions who stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated the breach sermon is ultimately about the lamb the kinsman redeemer taking the book and making a transition to a lion judge king and that's what he's accomplishing during these final years of the gentile dispensation so he's changing from being a kinsmen redeemer and yet as you heard on the tape brother branham said that hasn't fully happened yet and we know that it fully takes place at the time of the rapture that's when the sanctuary becomes smokey now uh through this time he is accomplishing this and it continues on through the tribulation and the salvation of the jews into the millennium where he reigns as the son of david and finally at the white throne judgment where he stands with his queen by his side and and so we're going to go to the breach to part of what we heard tonight in paragraph 269 it says he leaves the throne to be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment so this is his purpose in leaving the throne he is bringing the world to judgment who has rejected his message he's not a mediator he said remember the old testament teaching now as we hurry when the blood went off the mercy seat what was it judgment seat and when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat once he's done that it's a judgment seat he said then he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his queen to come to stand by his side oh that's what the message is about that's what the message of the hour is is the lamb the lamb calling becoming the king as he's becoming the king to becoming that judgment that that one who will be there at the white throne of judgment he calls for the queen to stand in judgment with him to come stand by his side no he not he said that the saints shall judge the earth daniel said the judgment was set and the books were opened and ten thousand times ten thousands of thousands ministered to him king and queen he said and then another book was open which was the book of life that's for the church and the queen and the king stood there and brother branham does an interesting thing at that time and you may have heard it if you tuned in early on the tape and you can listen to it on the breach brother branham gives a cowboys meditation it's actually kind of a poem and or a song and it says this last night as i laid on the prairie i gazed to the stars in the skies and i wondered if ever a cowboy could drift to that suite by and by there's a road to that bright happy region but it's a dim narrow trail so they say but the broad one that leads to perdition is posted and blazed all the way they speak of another great owner he's speaking about the terms of his cattle life he said if he was ever in a roundup you could see it playing brother branham would have been in a roundup very similar to that when he was a young man he said they speak of another great owner he's never overstocked so they say he'll always make room for a center that will drift on that straight narrow way they say he will never forsake you and he knows every action and look for safety we better get branded have our name on his great tally book for they say there will be a great roundup when cowboys like doges will stand to be marked by the writers of judgment he said them prophets and seers that's posted and knows every brand so brother branham says if he was ever in a round up see the boss stand out there and the riders and milling in that herd of cattle he'll see his own brand go by and he'll motion to the boss brother branham types this to the messenger of the h he said he'll motion to the boss and the boss will see it and give him the knot his pony runs right in around around this milling cropping bunch of horns like that and cut his own cows out see he said they say there will be a great roundup and cowboys like dogies will stand and will be marked by the writers of judgment that's posted and knows every brand so i guess i'll be a stray yearlings a man that's condemned to die is what the man the poem is saying unbranded he said they make soup out of him he said that we'll be cut in the bunch with the rustics when the boss of those riders come by he said see who it is the boss of the writers that's the lamb to the seven messengers who has posted and knows every brand you know what a confidence that ought to give us tonight that we who have been called to the message of the hour we're the ones who have been called out who've been cut out who've been who've been corralled if we could say it that way by the messenger of the age we've been corralled by the message of the hour and we've been placed in his group he saw his brand in us other people may not have saw much the world may not see much in you tonight it may see just a few people sitting and listening on a wednesday night that are sitting and listening at home but but god saw something in you that he sent the message by your way oh we ought to be we ought to be grateful for that tonight the boss of the writer said that's mine and so the messenger's message cuts you out from the denominations and the people the regular church if we could say it that way of the day and brought you out into the message of the hour i'm so glad to be a part of the message of this day amen now the bible tells us as we'll look at this now from the scriptures as we know that brother branham was the word prophet these things must come from the scripture the bible tells us what happens at the end of the tribulation of the battle of armageddon if you have your bibles you'll turn to the book of revelation revelation chapter 20 and verse 1. revelation chapter 20 and verse 1 he says i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years oh i'm looking forward to that i want to see him bound i want to see him down how is he bound by a chain of circumstance the prophet told his team he's bound he got nobody to work through so he's bound for a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up i like that i like that i know it means to close the door but i can't wait for the devil to be shut up he said he shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season a little season verse 4 and i saw thrones and they set upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years that's us we live and reign with christ a thousand years brother branham identifies that as the bride now and verse and that's the bride all down to the ages because it speaks of those that were martyred for the word of god and he said but the rest of the dead live not the rest of the dead so there are some who don't raise at that time the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection so going by way of the grave as a believer in the in the message of the hour whatever hour it was that you were laid away in as a believer as a holy ghost-filled christian it's no detriment to you to go by way of the grave during that time but it's actually that you'll come up first and then there'll be a little group that will be alive and remain that'll complete that body at that time but it's no detriment to you that you go by way of the grave you don't lose anything you'll be in that same resurrection he said blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years they shall reign with him in other words they're going to be the ones that will sit in the throne with him now we won't take time tonight but if you read in in the rest of revelation chapter 20 from verse 7 down through verse 10 you'll find that satan is loosed and he goes and he gathers his armies and finally he's defeated and then in verse 11 i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great that means big and little rich and poor every one of them every person you've ever known every person that's ever drawn a breath will stand before the one whose face from whose faith face the earth and the heaven flees away and he said i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged according now notice judge out of those things which were written in the books according to their works so there is a group of people who are judged according to their works and it's not the bride you and i are not judged according to our works to us sin is not imputed aren't you glad brother peter that sin is not imputed to you as a believer amen aren't you glad out there on the internet streaming that sin is not imputed blessed is the man the bible says to whom the lord will not impute sin other words sin will never be charged to your account why sin has already been paid for on the cross and you're there with him amen but these are judged according to their work so i wouldn't want to go in that way with you i don't want to take a chance i want to go in while there's mercy i want to plead the blood of the lamb verse 13 of the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire and remember the book of life judas had his name written in the book of life because he told them when they went and cast out devils and come back rejoicing judas being among them he told them he said don't rejoice because you can cast out devils but rejoice because your name's in the book of life and all their names were and judas was among them but his name was taken out but your name cannot be taken out of the bride amen of that of that book amen now another group coming at that time so there's a group of people who have to be judged we'll call that the nations another group coming out of that time is 144 000 jews revelation 14 and 1 says i looked and loyal lamb stood on the mount zion and with him 140 and 4 000 having his father's name written in their foreheads 144 000 having his father's name written in their foreheads another group in matthew 25 if you look there that's the there's a group but it identifies more closely these group these people the nations that will be judged this is after interestingly it's after the parable of the foolish virgin and the parable of the talents in matthew 25 he then says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another so here he says it's not just that he's judging them for what they've done wrong but he's actually going to separate them because there's some that are sheep and some that are goats among these nations and verse 33 and he shall set he said he shall separate them one from another as the shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats verse 33 he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left the sheep on the right hand but the goats on the left we're not going to go fully into that tonight maybe we'll get into it in a future service but there's a great truth there of those that and he talked about how that they gave a drink of water to one of these little ones he said if you've done that to them you've done it to me and they didn't even know it they didn't even know that they were righteous and they made it in oh my so there'll be a group like that isn't god good he is a good god he is he's long suffering to each and every one of us now the bride does not sit in that group they sit with the king in judgment because they are in the first resurrection the foolish virgin walk in all the light that they know and they have a measure of salvation but they're not the bride they go in the tribulation period and are killed 144 000 jews are saved as a nation during that tribulation period under the ministry of moses and elijah and are killed by the antichrist system all the others are the nations which are separated by the king and queen into two groups sheep and ghosts depending on how they treated the elect bride now and those are the groups so i want to be in that first group i want to be the bride don't you now brother branham says this about that he said the church the lukewarm anything outside of the elected bride will go through the tribulation period you're either going to be in the bride or you go to the tribulation that's there's no deal there's no way to get out of that you're either going to be in the bride or you'll go through the tribulation period they will not raise in the first resurrection you have to be bribed for your day to raise in the first resurrection the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years just for ordained predestinated elected bribe god's own election you say what about that that loved one that died many years ago they didn't understand the message they didn't see it brother brown said don't count them out because they may have been sealed away in their hour they may be bribed for their day it's also possible that they could come up after in that second resurrection and actually be saved by how they treated the bride while they were living but they won't live during this time of the millennium now he says they will not raise in the first resurrection the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years just the foreordained predestinated elected bride god's own elections amen god's own elections he said who is it brother branham i don't know i can't tell you who it is but i know it's going to be there because the lord said they would oh that's what we have to hold on to church i can't tell you who it is but i know that there's going to be a bribe because god said that it would they're the ones that'll go up from the tribulation but the rest of them will go through the tribulation go down and everything will be killed notice everything will be killed before the millennium then the righteous shall come out in the millennium and live a thousand years and after the thousand years then the great white throne judgment comes and then the dead both right and wrong is raised and the books are open and the book of life was open and the saints the wife and the husband sent and judged the world and there it comes to pass the saying he'll judge all nations with a rod of iron all nations shall stand before him there and he'll judge them with the rod of iron he'll separate the sheep from the goats and say to the goats depart and the sheep come you blessed of my father notice that the jews the bride and the church are all in god's economy all of them are in god's economy he has a place for them see because brother branham taught us that he has a bunch of change in his pocket to be used for different purposes and you look at abraham and lot lot was always a hair in the biscuit he was always causing problems for abraham yet he was put there for that purpose he had a part in the economy of god and it was not a part of someone like like pharaoh that would be just his heart hardened and turned against god it was not that but it was less than what abraham was he could never be abraham and yet he was not lost he was not he was one who who would come out of sodom but yet he would go through many things now lot and abraham were very different but god made them different god made them that way thank you for that amen brother peter all these believers now brother branham said all these believers he's talking about abraham and lord he said this we could go on for hours all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket if you're at home and you're listening maybe you've got a pocket full of change we don't really carry as much change as we used to i actually throw it in my truck but in my truck in a cup holder there's a whole cup holder whole little pocket there full of change he said you pull out a bunch of chains there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollars all in coins now anymore you may not even bend over to pick up a penny but some people would my daughter melody would pick up a penny she does that sometimes she would pick up a penny and and gather it up but it's hard sometimes to even be worth picking up a penny but there's a worth there but if you saw a silver dollar you'd pick that up because it still has some worth to it but even a penny if you get enough of them has a place in the economy of god and that's why the pennies by the way are much more plentiful than the dimes than the nickels then the half dollars and the dollars the pennies are much more plentiful because it takes way more of them to do anything that's right even in the even in the church we could bring it on down to the local church we could we could bring it down to the bride as a whole but the pennies are much more plentiful don't discount the pennies because they're needed actually needed to keep the program of god going that god needs them he has a use for them they're just depending but they're god's change he said now that's what the world is in god's hand there are some people that just can have a pennies worth of it god can only use them in a penny way that's all they can buy don't reject them oh i love this he said don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because god uses pennies sometimes god uses pennies sometimes law was just a penny abraham was a silver dollar so it taken a hundred lots to make it abraham and so will it take a hundred carnal believers we'll never stand in the presence of a genuine christian that's amen that's separated from the carnal things of the world living in christ jesus where the word can flow through him so you say well if there's no difference i'll just be opinion no god made you to be more than that and i was as i've said many times the daryl ward told me years ago he said if you may only be a 10 cent preacher he said but if you're not all that you should be he said you're robbing god he said you're robbing god of five cents if you're only a nickel you're robbing god of five cents he made you to be something be all that he made you to be a hundred carnal believers could never stand in the presence of a of an abraham but yet those are needed a hundred carnal believers are needed many of them may even be there be in the book have their names in the book of life but only be a penny but thank god there's a silver dollar because no one can replace that there's got to be a silver dollar and i'll say as we've been saying recently there's got to be a bride at the end time there's got to be a people who don't make it just by the skin of their teeth god's not going to have a bunch of silver dollars out of the efficient age and silver dollars out of the thigh tyrant agent silver dollars out of philadelphia and then just a bunch of pennies and labels to see him god's got some silver dollars in laodicea that's willing to fight against the spirit of the age it's willing to not be lukewarm that's willing even if they're at home streaming they're willing to be on fire for god in their heart even if they're at the at work on the job they're willing to be on fire for god in their heart why there's something more than a penny there's something that god placed in them that's more than just a penny's worth it's a silver dollar it's meant to be a light to the world why do you christians why you ladies dress the way that you do why do you men act the way that you do because you're more than just a penny you're a silver dollar god puts something inside of you that's worth more hey man it's worth more you can only take a penny's worth he said lot was just let's go back he says he can only take a penny's worth that's all he's got he said that's all he's got so you see people that say i don't believe in divine healing he says i don't believe in those things just know that it's a penny but just let him alone he said just let him alone and he said he said i don't believe in a penny just he said i don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let him alone he said see just a penny's worth and so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone remember that's just all the farther he can go and he goes on and he kind of apologizes for that statement he said i didn't really mean that the way it sounds he says well he said i mean if he just well i belong to this and that's what we believe he said it's just a penny go ahead see just a penny he said say well the lord bless you my brother well that's what we ought to say to the penny the lord bless you how much more the silver dollar see he said he's copper he can never be silver that's it so just let it go that's why he only shows up every now and then at church he's copper he can't he can't ever be a silver dollar but let him be what he is if you if you throw him out there let him be a copper if there's any use for him at all and some people really you know they make more trouble than what it seems like they're worth but if there can be just a penny and they can sit there and smile during the service if they can just hold the door open during this or whatever it is maybe they're a penny but god made them that but you'd be surprised who the silver dollars are the silver dollars may not be who we think they are they may not always be the people that do the most in the in the house of god that may be a pennies worth to god but god may take a little woman that's sitting at home tonight that really gets in touch with god by prayer that does nothing in the church but really gets a hold of god a prayer warrior that can shake the heaven god may take a little woman like that a little family that serves god with all the heart does nothing in the church god may grab a hold of those people and actually do more with them that may be the silver dollar and there may be some preacher pennies out there but don't throw away the penny just because he's copper that's it just just let it go ahead god can use him he said oh he is using it he is using it oh my he said i'd rather see him down there in a church than to see a bar room standing there on the corner wouldn't you i wonder sometimes he said sure he said so just let it alone god can use it anyhow you say well that church started wrong that church doesn't deserve to be a church maybe it's a penny brother brandon said let it alone that church isn't what they're not on the in crowd they started in the wrong way they're a split or something else let them alone god can use it he said maybe not very much but he'll use what he can use as much as they let him use maybe they'll let him use him use them more than the pharisee will see we can't change a penny into a silver dollar you can't change a silver dollar into a penny you but let them alone don't be a part of that system now you don't become a penny you don't try to go changing all the pennies that's not what we do no we we preach the to the elect and we preach to the pennies and we preach to the dimes we preach to the half dollars we preach to the silver dollars but we don't quit preaching a silver dollar message we continue to preach that we don't go back into denominationalism let them alone don't be a part of that system they couldn't understand the word it doesn't necessarily mean they go to hell it just means they're a penny in the economy of god brother branham talks about a man who is arguing against divine healing now it's interesting because there's two classes of people there's a class of people who are apostate in the sense that they can see what the truth is from an intellectual standpoint but they turn around and walk away from it that's an apostate and they can't ever be saved frankly but a person could look right at it and not be able to see it even like paul who was blinded up to a point until god opened his eyes a person could could look right at it and not be able to see it and then some people are never able to see it but yet they're not rejecting it because because they see it and they don't want it they're rejecting it because they don't understand it some people don't that person may not necessarily be bound for hell it may be someone who's a penny let's look at this there was a man arguing against divine healing and brother branham talks about how that he he went on he said i don't believe it and he said well it's not for unbelievers and in paragraph 166 here of uh the sermon is the seventh seal in paragraph 166 he said i wouldn't believe i don't care what you could do how much evidence you can prove or anything like that i still don't believe it i said certainly it wasn't for unbelievers it was only for believers that's it what was it see he said you know right then the election is off the election is off i mean he can't be a penny but he's not a silver dollar he said don't fool with it at all don't fool with it at all jesus did the same thing he said let them alone if the blind leads the blind won't they all fall in the ditch but when he come i love this part because this is me when he come to a little prostitute when it comes to someone who was unworthy he snapped his finger he said it struck fire what was it it was an elected sea laying there that's seen it right now oh my oh what a blessing it is tonight if you can see the word of god when it's presented to you grab hold of it what a blessing that is to you he can see it right now he said when it come to peter there was elected seed laying there see and they saw it and all the fathers give half past tense given me they'll come they'll come to me oh my i love that yes sir notice the believers does believe it or if i had people here tonight we'd have a shout and spell maybe just uh my family will do that but you can have one at home i'll give you permission to do that the believers does believe it they does believe it even if there's snow on the ground they doesn't believe it amen if i can use the wrong english there if the believers does believe it the people of god are always going to believe god's word everyone else may turn it down but the believers does believe it hallelujah the unbelievers can't believe it he said so now if anybody wants to argue about the serpent seed and things and you try to show them they won't listen to it just walk away he said just leave them alone now listen he said see god don't argue neither does his children oh i wish we could underline that you got the seventh seal book at home maybe you could grab that and look at paragraph 170 and underline that put that on your refrigerator god don't argue neither does his children he said notice god's 144 thousand elected jews don't battle the beast now watch he's talking about the silver dollar now the elected here's how they are they don't bow to the beast it's denominationalism or statues or anything because in that jewish group there's the same as in the gentiles there's an elected group who 144 000 there was those under the altar that fell under hitler and eichmann but now here's an elected group 144 thousand jews that's not going to do it he said he said that anything he said though their nation is in a covenant with it at the time israel is in a covenant but here is 144 000 that's not going to do it he said that's the elected same thing it is right here in the gentile church now he said is an elected group you can't pull them in that kind of stuff they won't believe it no sir when the light once struck them that settles it right then they see it happen then see it vindicated and proved like that now watch the characteristics of this elected group aren't you glad you're one of the elect tonight watch the characteristic of this electric elected group he said they look down here in the bible see that word just going that word is going like the wheel in the middle of the wheel it was moving it was always moving that's the way the word is it's always moving it's not a god of yesterday a god of 40 years ago a god of 400 years ago or 2 000 years ago but a god of today the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the word is moving for the elect for the elect the word moose but for the others for the pennies it just it just seems like it sits real still they always look back and say well things were better in the 70s things were better when brother branham was here things were better some other time in some other place but the for the elect the word moves he said that he said he said they'd look down here in the bible and see that word just going he said well you might as well well i love this just like you quit fooling with those others you know they're not elect he said you just quit fooling with them the elect because they believe it that's all he said they though they can't explain it i love this though they can't explain it but they know they got it they know they got it see he said so as i say there's a lot of things i can't explain but i know it's real anyhow oh if we could ever get down it's not an intellectual faith being elected is not about intellectually understanding everything that goes on in the messenger or that brother branham said but being elected of god is about knowing who you are it's about saying i may not be able to explain it but i know i got it hallelujah i know it's real anyhow i know it's real i was there when it happened the bible says and i guess or the song says i guess i ought to know amen let's look at the foolish virgin real quick what about them what about the foolish virgin after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they all be lost brother branham takes that he says no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when will it be finished let's keep our balance here in these looking at the breach he said when will we finish for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth that's when it's finished the spirit of god leaves the earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky where the attorney stands to plead the case christ leaves the sanctuary his day of mediatorial is over the rapture comes that's when it happens he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth and takes the book of redemption and claims everything he redeemed there's no more mediatorial work how many understands that now just a minute will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens happens now and i can't fully explain that to you but there's a level of salvation that they enter into though they're foolish they are virgins and there's an element of salvation that they enter into but not the fullness of it so they have to go through tribulation now he said after that time she's in the state now she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason of it is because she is rejected no notice she rejected what the atonement in its fullness as i said not rejected it not going up to the border and seeing it and then turning around but actually rejecting it because you can't see it she has rejected the atonement in his fullness she's a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period that's from questions and answers number two in 1964. now again brother branham and i'm just i'm not reading these entire quotes you can go back and read the rest of them we won't have time this afternoon or this evening but just to kind of punch this real real hard really quick and then we'll we'll close but i guess i don't have to worry about holding you too much you can get up and go get a drink if you need to but but i don't want to hold my family too long now he said she uh the first thing he said the sixth seal he's talking about the sixth seal he said it was for a threefold purpose he said here was the purposes the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged over sins of unbelief and rejecting the message well if she rejected the message she's not even in the economy of god well it depends on why she rejected it i had someone heard someone say it always meant a lot to me they said everybody likes water but you don't want it thrown in your face so why did they reject it they were blinded for by something maybe actions of people in the message that they were blinded by but they were blinded by these things they were unable to be purged at during this time by the message of the hour they were not washed in the word because they were blinded for some reason they were not the elect of god so they had to be purged over sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period he said no she is not the bride but it's the church the pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart now there's the key they're really sincere in heart and god knows their heart and here they are purged during this time again he says judgment was said the books was open books was open another book was open which was the book of life he separated from there the goats from the sheep is that right that had nothing to do with the bride she was standing right there in judgment the queen and the king together he come with his saints ten thousand times ten thousand ministered to him his wife then judgment was set and then the sheep was separated from the ghosts remember the other night me bringing now watch what he comes back to this is in questions and answers on the seals and he comes back this is sunday morning after the breach he had preached the previous week and he preached the seals all down through the week and he goes back to the breach of what we read earlier remember he said the other night me bringing that little meditation so you'd understand it the cowboy meditation so when god wanted us to understand the white throne judgment he gave a poem to a cowboy we don't even know if he was saved think about it church oh isn't god good we don't even know if he was saved but he gave a poem to a cowboy and it become a cowboy meditation and brother branham heard it and god inspired him in the breach to go and recite that poem and talk about the owner and the boss of the writers so that we would understand what the judgment would be like the separating of the sheep from the goats god didn't choose a great theologian or a great bunch of a language that was high for luton language but he chose to tell a story and give a little poem about a few cows that were being rounded up that great roundup in the sky oh my god uses things like that doesn't he he said remember me bringing that little meditation so you'd understand it aren't you glad that the god who created the universe is little enough that he can come down and use things that's what jesus did he come down and he talked about little things that the people would understand he talked about sower sowing seeds he talked about the country people would understand he talked about servants and about talents and about fish and about all these other things why did he talk about those things because the common people would hear him gladly that's the same thing we have happened in our time but the message of the hour he gave that cowboy meditation so you would understand he said no he said see that's the church the people that's in denominations that are genuine christians who receives the message he said and they will never see it it don't mean they never got a book or they never heard a tape but they don't see it they can't they can't understand it it'll never they don't they don't necessarily reject it but they just don't see it it'll never be preached to them and those who said in mixed crowds who it is preached to it'll go right over the top of their heads unless their name was on the lamb's book of life oh i'm so glad my name was on the lamb's book of life because it didn't go over the top of my head i heard it i may not understand all the ins and outs but i knew that's for me i heard the scream of the eagle and i said mama that's me he said but they will be good people they'll be raised up again and given trial and be judged now listen i love this be judged by the very group that preached to them don't you know the saints will judge the earth he said they'll be preached to see they'll be preached to by the very same people witness to them of the message to come out of it they'll be preached to by the same people who witnessed some of the people that i've preached to over the years other ministers that are listening some of the people that you preached over the years some of the people that you all have witnessed to over the years and they've sat there and said well i know brother branham was a prophet but i just can't see it i just can't understand it i just can't seem to live it don't you know one day you'll preach to them again you'll preach to them and they'll be given an opportunity amen amen look see the bible says we've used this before but the bible says the spirit and the bride say come oh that we don't ever quit preaching don't let the devil tell you that it's a lie of the devil we don't ever quit preaching don't never quit preaching because the people that you preach to you'll preach to them again one day they don't receive it they laugh in your face and call you names you'll preach to them but you'll preach to those who are good to the bride as well you'll preach to them they'll be preached to you by the very same people witness to them with the message spirit and the bride say come the bride's got something to say that's why we've got to preach it it's not enough just for a prophet to say it on tape we've got to preach it because we've got to stand before our generation let me tell you this brother branham will stand before those he preached to but i'll stand before those i preach to you'll stand before those you witness to i wonder how many will be in that group of people that you witnessed to you told them about the message but they couldn't see it for some reason but they'll be given an opportunity at that time and be judged according to their works and the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come notice the bride is saying come and let him that heareth say come let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely as we've said before that should be the attitude of the bride during this hour listen to me tonight the tribulation period is a time that you don't want to be in be the worst time that the world has ever known it'll be a time of men who cry out for the rocks and the mountains to fall down on them yet they will still not repent it'll be a time when women will see visions of of locusts with long hair and they'll see it coming on them and these awful things that you see in the movies will begin to come on the earth you don't want to be here during those three and a half years if you think the last two years has been rough you ought to see the next three and a half that's coming don't be a rejecter of the atonement during this time don't be somebody who turns it down but be somebody be a believer tonight a believer believes it's just what they do they hear the message and they grab hold of it they believe it whatever a prophet said that's what i believe whatever is written in the word that's what i believe this book is me this belongs to me i'm a believer i believe it i don't want to go through that tribulation time be a believer not double not someone who sees god 40 years ago or 100 years ago but someone who sees god right now someone who sees him moving the wheel in the middle of the wheel moving in his word moving in his bride today be in that elected group because you don't want to go through the tribulation period the foolish rejecters will reject because they cannot see it the willful willful rejecters will end up in the lake of fire but the boss of the writers is coming by and he'll point out which ones have the blood tag which ones have the token and they'll be identified in the hour that we live in don't you want to be one of those would you bow your heads with me one more time have you just taken this time to to fellowship and around the word i trust that you'd have could have a time of prayer there with your families and just reflect on these things lord what does this mean to me and my family i don't want to be a rejecter i want to be a believer someone who sees it someone who grabs hold or may not understand all the ins and outs of it but i believe it there's something about me that believes it heavenly father we love you today we thank you for your word we thank you lord for your presence that we feel even talking about your word lord and i believe you've somehow ordained tonight to be like it is maybe sitting there in the quietness of their homes the people lord can grab hold of the word and there'd be just a longing let him that is the thirst come lord whether that's a penny or a silver dollar whether it's a half dollar or a dime lord whatever it is or would you help them to grab a hold of that whosoever will let him come lord as you spoke through your prophet and i heard it speaking directly to me pastor don't give up on your altar call now oh god would you help us now lord would you just make us and mold us into what you want us to be help us through the rest of the week i pray for those that are sitting at home lord in their homes i pray that your spirit would be right there with them to the very end i pray that you'd be there abundantly lord that you'd never leave them never forsake them you promised them that you wouldn't i pray that you'd help them in their jobs or at school wherever they are until we can come back together on a sunday morning we believe that you're still the same yesterday today and forever we want to preach to this generation witness to this generation of the truth that we know so someday we'll have the opportunity to speak to them again i pray you'd grant that we we ask it in jesus name heal every sick person lord touch everybody every every family lord bless them abundantly we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you that concludes our service tonight god bless you thank you for staying with us and we'll see you
