Revelation chapter 6 and verse 3. going to be uh gone on Sunday thank you for bearing with me in that every year we go over by the windows and and I guess there's quite a few folks going on vacation and things as well but Joel and I will be over there by the windows this weekend the meetings start tonight if anyone wanted to go I'm getting a little bit of a rebound up here with Peter if you could take care of that I don't know if it's if it's an overheads of these but we got too few people to have that loudest speakers you love the Lord tonight y'all hear me all right Amen brother Matt McGarry is going to be at just better but the man's going to be a Christian Tabernacle on Saturday night if anyone wants to go at six o'clock and then we'll have one service here on Sunday with brother Stewart and of course you all are welcome to stay and eat together and whatever you want to do on Sunday but we'll be back on Wednesday and we're just expecting the Lord to do great things let's uh Revelation 6 3 let's go ahead and read this evening we need to open the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see remember there were four beasts uh that corresponded to these first four seals and those four beasts were uh was an eagle an ox a uh uh it was a lion an ox and a man and an eagle and the second beast then would have been the ox or the sacrificial age as it meant that anointing met the uh the challenge of the horse rider that would come out that there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that set thereon to take peace from the earth they should kill one another there was given unto him a great sword pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated brother Branham goes back on a lengthy review if you if you've listened to the second seal brother Brown goes back on a lengthy review of the first seal and just kind of hammers that home and I think it's appropriate because that is the he's revealing the Antichrist that I would say that he still has a white horse rider today uh he said that Ryder would ride on into eternity and and then he went on to be a red horse rider a black horse rider a pale horse rider he said it's the same one on different color horses but yet he's still a white horse rider today that that still represents today in fact The Pale Horse was the uh was the accumulation of all of those ways that he uh presented himself his character in the way that he presented himself and so we see him as a deceiver today isn't he I think that's that's what he does mostly today and yet we know that he'll be a a red horse rider again as he has been he'll take his sword again that's coming on the earth in the not too distant future so brother Branham ties the second seal to Matthew 24 where it says there'd be wars and rumors of war and and he said the end is not yet and it talks at about the Fig Tree and he ties it back to Luke where it talks about the Fig Tree and all the other trees and he says this he said now we find out that there would be wars and rumors of war and now we see the Fig Tree put forth its buds and the other trees put forth their buds the method is the Baptists the Presbyterians now this has already happened remember the Fig Tree was Israel and Israel become a nation they put forth their butt the method has put forth their butt the Baptist put forth there but they they've accumulated millions of followers and and and people Christians during that time but that Revival is over in fact today they're losing people and the mainline denominations are have a hard time keeping people in church but now's a different time this is the time for the bride he said that there's a great revival going on he said now I believe that God is gathering the bride for the last hour the elect aren't you glad for that you say brother Ben I I don't know I feel like I've been gathered to anything what do you gathered to you're gathered to the word wherever the carcass is that's where the Eagles will be gathered together and that's why we're here tonight now the the Fig Tree is God you know that's the that's God's showing us that that the end time is near and and now God's Gathering the elect now he said let us now consider what John saw he said a red horse and his writer Goes Forth power given to him to slay with a great sword he said now here is my revelation of it this is Satan again it's the devil in another form and so brother Branham told us that a trumpet he said was a political disturbance but he goes here and he said you find out this man has a sword he said so he pertains not to uh he's not to National War not to Civil War but to church political war right he said now you might not think that but just watch it a minute he said notice the change of color of these horses the same writer but the change of color of horses a horse is a beast that's the power a symbol of a power he said the same system riding on another color power from innocent white to a bloody red now you may not think this is important or impact your daily life but it really does more than we realize because he's still doing this today and I think we need to understand and you're going to see this it's all of it right what did he say last week he said all has come under that Antichrist Spirit he said he would deceive all right all of it conservatives and liberals Democrats and Republicans Baptists and methodists right aren't you glad for the message of the hour this is the only safety that we have is in the word of the hour there's no safety under any political movement there's no safety under anything else it's just under the word of the hour so he said the same system riding on another color a power from innocent white to a bloody red and not realizing they're all and you see these things writing today one will say peace and another says war and it's under the Same Spirit but they even fight with one another but now anointed by The Same Spirit he said when he first started he was just a little Doctrine in amongst called the nicolaitanism of course he said it wouldn't say anything he wouldn't say anything it's just a Doctrine just a spirit amongst the people so watch how Satan gets started before he can become incarnate before it can become real it has to start as a Doctrine now I know there's a lot of people say Doctrine doesn't matter Doctrine does matter I I will say that your Doctrine Matt what you believe is true matters because before it can ever become an action in your life you you believe something wrong before it can become an action that's wrong there's something about what you believe that is wrong and so if we believe that God is faithful we believe that God is true we believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever that manifests itself in our life and also if you believe that if you believe that nothing's happening right now and the bride doesn't have any Revival and and we're waiting on something else to happen later that'll manifest in your life so Doctrine does matter he said no he said he wouldn't say anything he was just a Doctrine just a spirit amongst the people he said oh he was so innocent riding on this White Horse well you know we can have a great worldwide church we could call this The Universal Church they still do oh it's perfectly innocent it's so innocent it'll just a group of men we'll all get together for Fellowship see it's very innocent he said it's white the white horse was well there's a profound thought isn't it but it's innocent and so brother Brandon begins to talk about this and again I'm condensing a three-hour sermon into about 30 minutes so you just bear with me tonight but the White Horse was come in as a Doctrine but even then before it was a Doctrine before it even become a stated thing it was a spirit and it begins as a spirit of of classism it begins as a spirit in the church it actually begins as a clique in the church and so those of you that are here and those of you that are listening I want you to listen carefully this is why we try so hard to put make to church and cause the church to do things together to encourage the church to do things as a body because false Doctrine starts as a click it starts as one part of the church saying we're better than another part of the church or or we're different than another part of the church and we're going to kind of get off to ourselves it starts as people do the same thing pastors do the same thing churches do the same thing well the rest of these message people they're all wrong and so we'll just pull off to ourselves and have our own little thing it becomes a dangerous thing because it actually leads to a deceptive Spirit well we're the only ones that are right well if we're the only ones that are right then something is wrong right there God's got people all over the Earth do you believe that tonight he's got people all over the U.S he got people all over the world that preach this message he has to it may not be a many but in every Church there's three kinds of Believers but somebody believes that somebody is standing for the message of the hour they've got to be but it's so it starts off as a click in the church and that's why we encourage you to go to come together and to worship together and to Fellowship together and to eat together even all those things I know we can't always do it but anytime that we can we try to get people together because we don't want those things to start now but when this awful deceiving Spirit he said oh man incarnated in incarnate spirit this doctrine of spirit become incarnated to take the place of Christ into a man it must be worshiped then turning to be a worship like Christ so they begin to worship a Doctrine and then the doctrine took the form of a person and it become a worship like Christ the doctrine instead of Christ now anything that takes the instead of Christ to the Bible says there's one median in between man and God the man Christ Jesus anything that comes in between you and Christ you and God you in the word is an antichrist the doctrine instead of Christ so brother random I illustrates Sam he uses the the Latin term one of the names for the pope historically although they try to deny it today was vicarious philia Dia which is the uh the viker of Christ or instead of Christ and he said he broke that down how that you could actually break down the numbers and it breaks down to 666. how many have heard that right and that's true you can go break down the numbers and it breaks down to that now the Catholic Church would respond and you'll see people with anti-message people take the same thing and respond that you can break down just about any name into numbers now brother Branham actually answers that criticism and he said he said that's true he said my name might break down into them an unflattering number right that's true any one of our names could do that he said but I don't meet the other qualifications right he said I don't sit on Seven Hills come on right I'm not drunk with the blood of the Saints so this the vicarious Philly idea is not the if that's not what proves he's the Antichrist it's just another another little bit of grain of sand on the mountain of evidence shows us who he is right because he's manifested himself as an antichrist which the Branham taught us that it's a demon spirit in the pope to make him do that but now one day he actually becomes the Devil Himself the head demon incarnate and that becomes the Beast now and so he wears a crown brother Brandon talked about the Triple Crown which is the papal Tiara or Tiara and so and that triple crown if you go back one uh to that Crown itself you can see that it actually it actually consists of three parts and and it's a Triune office that the pope holds and his crown is is actually three crowns in one and the the Triple Crown if you go to the vaticans visit vaticancity.com you can find this is the one brother Brandon would have looked at when he was there this is the one that they put on Saint Peter's head every year and during their festival and uh and so it it says this the Triple Crown is the papal Tiara comprising the three crowns which symbolize the Pope's threefolds power as father of Kings Rector of the world and vikra of Christ so that's where brother Brandon just said he said I saw it right written just above it and talks about how he calls him he literally it's as if the pope calls himself the Antichrist but today what's happened is that something interesting has happened in the last few years since brother Branham left the scene Pope's brother Stewart have quit wearing the tiara have you ever seen a pope with one on you haven't in our lifetime because the last one to wear one was back in the 50s I believe in it's actually a picture of in black and white you can see him still wearing it but it still exists and he still claims the same authorities but they don't wear it anymore because it looks bad so they wear the little beanie on their head but they're actually still still in their coat of arms and everything else and they actually deny that vicarious FIA Ophelia Dia was ever a title for the pope but if you go back in their own literature you can find where it was it states that it's a fact I just looked at it myself this week so this is the one we find in second Thessalonians 2 4 and people say whatever they want to about the Antichrist we know who he's going to be right when he becomes incarnate he'll present himself as the Pope right because that's been the Antichrist system all along now brother Branham says who opposed or the Bible says this is the one who opposeth and exalteth himself of all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he asked God sent us in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and yet again I would warn us that that's not the only Antichrist system in the world today it all belongs to Satan right but but one day it'll be the Beast and he'll actually become uh what is commonly known as the Antichrist now uh of course brother random taught us that Satan in the Bible teaches Satan is the head of all political power how many know that tonight of every nation brother Brahm in some places says every nation but Israel right but in Matthew 4 8 the devil took him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them all the kingdoms of the world he said he said which one do you want if you go bow down to me I'll give you all of them right and so brother said talk about a person he said I'll give them to you if you'll worship me and Jesus knew that he was going to fall heir to them so brother Branham talked about that and he said all these holy rollers people say and how poor they are and everything like that he said but the meek will inherit the earth so one day you're going to fall heir to all the kingdoms of the Earth but right now it's ruled by the Antichrist spirit see you see why you have so much trouble at work I had so much trouble at home why you have so much trouble on the job why you have so much trouble with your kids you realize the age the system that we're in we're in the best country on the earth I'll I'll say that as many places as I've been I Brother David I wouldn't want to give it up for any of them but yet it's still ruled by the devil you've got to believe that to believe the word of God and so our job is not to overthrow this Kingdom or or even to make life better in this Kingdom although I believe we should do that as Citizens but our job as Christians is not to do that but our job is to what is to get ready for another kingdom because there's coming another king there's coming the one who rides on a white horse and he's coming to execute judgment and righteousness on the Earth aren't you looking forward to that day I'm glad that this is not the end and so we should never get too caught up in successes or failures or numbers or things going on around and say well well I I just feel discouraged don't be discouraged there's coming today you'll inherit the earth amen now brother Brown said when he has his head demon incarnate in the super religious man as the Bible predicts then he unites his church and state both of his own powers unite together so there's two different powers that unite together and we see a prefigure that in the pope who was both church and state and we'll see it again at the end time so the Antichrist is against the teaching of Christ or or saying that an antichrist can be anything that says the the present truth is for another age but now that Antichrist Spirit it come in among the church it slipped in and said well we don't like these holy rollers and stuff like that but now it slips in and brother Brown said you can't Crown a spirit so he had to he had to take on he had to become a pope right and then the Antichrist become the false prophet no he brother said he gets into a place so he's going to make a universal church power taking religious power you know how this nation started it started with two powers that were separated right Church power and and religious power and it started with with uh with civil power and in this nation is represented in Revelation 13 11. Revelation 13 11 this is the second beast the first Beast Remember come out of the water come out of Europe where there were people this Beast comes up out of the Earth where there are no people in the new the the new Earth the new uh part of of the world and he had two horns two horns like a lamb right they they weren't much to them separation of church and state brother Brandon taught us so the two horns were civil and ecclesiastical power and brother Bible said it'll finally end up he goes on he talks about this he said it'll end up a woman will control her but remember he said that that won't be just under civil power right that's not going to be just under civil power it has to be under religious power as well so something's got to come to unite that so he said he'll end up a woman will control her he said remember that was 30 years ago I said it and the seven things I predicted five of them has done come to pass he said they got the man right there now to bring her in that was Kennedy he said and you voted him through your politics there some of the man talks about the woman he said or perhaps the Catholic Church that would take over I don't doubt that it'll be both now again but even now before we have a woman president Satan holds every government of the Earth but no that was that civil power but brother random said he did not have ecclesiastical power yet but he started in with a demon of false teaching and that teaching become a doctrine that Doctrine becoming incarnate in a false prophet and just then he went to the right place he never went to Israel he went to nicaea Rome he said the council was held they elected ahead bishop and by doing this a United church and state together then he dropped his bow he got off his White Horse he got on his red horse for he can kill anybody that don't agree with him he said there's your seal same fellow watch him right on into eternity under with it he said see he unites both his powers together or are we blessed to know these things he unites both his powers together we find out he unites his power then when he becomes both state and church ecclesiastical then what are you going to do he said he forms his own religion we think about it being Catholic but he actually forms he formed his own religion as a Catholic church but brother Brown said in the end it'll be every religion can't we all get along right so it'll be a multicultural multi-religion it'll be it'll be a cage of every foul spirit is what it'll be but he said he forms his own religion now he can do whatever he wants to then he has the right to put to death whosoever will not agree with him that's exactly what he did he said he did that just exactly he did it to the true Saints of the Living God who kept the word and wouldn't agree with him on his dogmas he put them to death how many of you have ever heard of Saint Augustine Saint Augustine we quote Saint Augustine a lot of times and you see his name on a church the Browns that taught us that Saint Augustine rejected the Holy Ghost you go back in history in the pre-nician fathers and find that Saint Augustine rejected the Holy Ghost and he said he went back down to hippo that's the word the region that he was Bishop of he said he was the very one that signed a paper that had the Revelation from God that it was all right and pleasing God to put every person to death didn't believe with the Roman Catholic Church watch how it turned oh we want to accept the Holy Ghost no we don't want to reject it when he rejected he come right up to the border and when he rejected it he comes back with that doctrine that it's okay to put everyone to death that didn't believe the Roman Catholic Church and so brother Brown said from that time he said I'm quoting from the martyrology and you find this I've actually got a digital copy of it you'll find this in schmucker's glorious Reformation where this number comes from he said from the time of Saint Augustine of Hippo until 1586 Roman Catholic Church put 68 million Protestants to death I went just as an aside I went down here recently to a an antique store in this antique store they had all kinds of oil and gas memorabilia and they had Nazi memorabilia I've never seen so much Nazi memorabilia in my life real stuff from back there made me nervous honestly just to be around it you know you're like what kind of people are these you know but it was like real stuff from back in the second world war so it was interesting as we were looking at that I thought about this I thought what about the Catholic Church who put all these millions of people to death just like the Nazis did many many more than the Nazis did and and and you look at all the the World Systems today and people talk about communism people talk about uh Nazism and all those other things all the isms that have been but brother random talked about that purple curtain would be the worst one of all of them and it is it has been over the years I don't say we should hate Catholic people but that system you've got to understand what it is that system we don't mess with it right we we don't make it we don't want to be part of that we don't want to do anything like that whenever I see Catholicism creeping over into the message we we don't want nothing to do with that we don't want to start praying to a prophet we don't want to start we don't want to start having a headquarters that tells us when to pray and when to have church and we don't want nothing to do with that because that's that that's that Catholicism that crept in and it actually created death it was on a red horse he said was it sword red was he riding a red horse what was it the same power the same writer there's the seal they admit 68 million on the martyrology besides all those put to death outside of that he said oh mercy they're in the Dark Ages there were Millions fed to Lions slaughtered in every way because they wouldn't bow down to that Catholic dogma and so we find this and brother Brown says he said now I want you to think spiritually he said let the Holy Ghost teach you in Revelation 17 1 let's go to Revelation 17. I hope I'm not boring you tonight but let's look at Revelation 17. I know you know these things but I think it's important as we continue to kind of try to encapsulate these seals Revelation 17 1 there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great the sinneth upon many Waters he said that had to be a woman and a woman is a church he said now Waters what does that mean read the 15th verse Revelation 17 15. he says unto me the waters which I saw us where the horse sitteth our peoples multitudes Nations not just a single nation but Nations and tongues he said this church was ruling over the whole world see set upon many Waters many Waters I don't know if you noticed recently there was the pope that visited Mongolia how many saw that in the news I won't hold you much longer just hang with me for a minute Pope visited Mongolia now what was he doing in Mongolia right that's the end of the Earth right there if you've ever been to Mongolia you've been to just about every country in the world because it's just empty of people and and there's very few Catholics there but he was visiting there to make peace and to talk about peace between world religions the religions of Mongolia and the Catholic religion and I saw the headline was they gave the Pope the status of an emperor when he went in they gave him a welcome fit for an emperor and that's exactly what he wants when he goes in now so he was ruling over the whole world why would he be in Mongolia but it's the way the Catholic church is now brother Brandon talked about the iron and the clay it goes out into all the little toes it it goes into every nation it seeps its way into every nation now verse 2 with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns now I've read their Catholic Study Bible I used to own one and brother Branham references facts of our faith in the Catholic Study Bible if you go to Revelation 17 they'll tell you that's wrong they understand that that woman is wrong but they don't see it necessarily as their church but they understand that that's wrong and so he said he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scar that clothed Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns he said watch that symbol seven heads you see where it said the heads which I saw us are seven hills on which the woman said if Rome sits on Seven Hills and the woman was a Raiden purple and scarlet color decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication he said the Antichrist Spirit see teaching committing adultery with God now she's supposed to be a bride and committing an adultery just like Eve did just like the church does there and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth Babylon Rome is the second Babylon verse 6 and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus when I saw her I wondered with great admira admiration he said she was such a beautiful thing with crosses and everything on her how in the world could she be guilty of drinking the blood of the Saints it puzzled him it still puzzles people today honestly sometimes it puzzles us how's this all going to happen but yet it's going to happen he said now he's going to tell him and the angel said unto me wherefore which did thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman of the Beast that carryth her which had the seven heads and ten horns the Beast that thou thoughts was and it's not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition and they that dwell in the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast it was and it's not and yet it is they'll Wonder Oh my he said how he said when when was your name put on the book of life that Revival you attended no sir from the foundation of the world those will be the only ones that'll make it that's it I read something today just challenged me brother Stewart brother Brown says in a church age book he says you can see the thought if you can see that the thoughts of God are Eternal he said you can see many things and think about that for a minute if if you can see the thoughts of God are Eternal you can see many things you were his thoughts amen you were his thoughts you were the thoughts that he had of someone who would stand at the end time those names were written in the Book of Life and so you you can't you know look at somebody else say well they don't see it well maybe they weren't meant to see it but your eyes have been opened Jesus said blessed are your eyes because you can see oh aren't you glad you can see tonight amen when was it put on The Book of Life oh my brother Paul when was it put on The Book of Life when you when you heard about a message maybe when you were saved as a child or a young person when were you name put on the book of life before the foundation of the earth that's why you come to the message of the hour that's why you were saved that's why you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can see the thoughts of God are Eternal you can see many things Hallelujah aren't you glad to be one of those Eternal thoughts of God oh my just oh the thought of that just overwhelms me he said see the Beast one will die another one take his place he was he was not he was he was not and should go Plumb into Perdition that way it's the different popes that come he said here's the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads or seven mountains which the woman sitteth this is the wisdom the gift of wisdom we went through not long ago there are seven Kings five are Fallen one is the other has not yet come when he cometh he must continue a short space and so brother bear said the one that was the one that is was Nero he said in the Beast it was and it's not even he is the eighth and his other seven and goeth into Perdition so he had Emperors that come and win and then the popes that come and win an unbroken line but now he said Pagan Rome brought into papal Rome when the Incarnate Antichrist Spirit become incarnate was crowned it was made a Crown King of Rome both in state and church together the ten horns which I saw solicitor Ten Kings which haven't received no Kingdom as yet but received power as kings one hour with the Beast he said that's dictators dictators you said you because it says these have one mind he's have one mind and shall give their power strength to the Beast he shall make war with the lamb the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called aren't you glad to be called and chosen and faithful and he saith unto me the waters which I saw us to the horse said to their peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongues and the ten horns that I saw they shall hate The Horde to make her Destin and naked shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire for God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will you say why does these countries like North Korea Iran all these why did they even exist they're here for a purpose to give their Kingdom unto the beasts until the words of God shall be fulfilled and the woman which I saw us is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the Earth but the brainer said that's wrong Rome don't do it as a nation it does it as a church and every nation under Heaven is to Rome so they wonder if the Miracles he can do he can stop War the only thing he has to do is just say stop now look but you think he'll do it certainly not so he has the power to stop War but he doesn't his bow had no arrows at first but his great sword did he done his killing later and changed from White Horse to Red Horse the same exactly Devil with his sword but I love this this word getting ready or come to the end of this and and getting close to the end of Brother by Adam's sermon on the second seal as he's opening up the seal the lamb is opening the seal oh I love the way God hides himself in simplicity and he says this he quotes Matthew 26 52. remember when Peter grabbed his sword and cut a man's ear off and brother random says this he said don't fight it now that's tough sometimes isn't it don't fight it but we're going home listen we could never fight this system with our with guns we'll never do it some of y'all got a pretty impressive collection but you're never going to fight this red horse rider with guns it's a spiritual battle you're never going to fight it with guns but yet what's going to happen Jesus he said when when he took the sword and cut his ear off Jesus said unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they've been take to sword Shall Perish with the sword he said now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand writing red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now we shouldn't be that way should we that's not the spirit of a Christian to go out wading through the blood of those who disagree with you all right we don't want to slay the people we disagree with call them names hurt their character right that's not that's not our nature oh my oh that's not our nature at all but God will take care of it vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repay he's got a great sword he Wades through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him this writer and all these Kingdom subjects that are slaying down to the age of strong all this Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes you go back and read Fox's book of Martyrs I challenge you to do it Glory it's hard reading schmucker's glorious Revelation is a revolution or Reformation rather it's hard reading it's difficult but you find out what they did to the people especially during the Spanish Inquisition when they went in and and invented all kinds of instruments of torture killed over two million in Spain alone of Protestants killed them and for every every way that they could possibly kill him and torture them they did it and they got blood on their hands but I'm thankful that I don't have to make it up I don't have to fight but the sword of Jesus Christ will take care of it when he comes he said they took the sword now watch what the sword is they took the sword of Dogma look you see it don't matter what you believe what what's this sword made out of Dogma before it could become an action where they begin to actually crucify people it was a Dogma now you think about it every false Doctrine tries to separate you from your family I'm just being honest with you tonight and open I feel like coming down there and preaching where you are but I'd have to scatter myself all over the church but but every false Doctrine every cult has to make you separate from your family separate from everybody that disagrees with you only only come in with just a few and you know we're the only ones that's right well why did they do that why do they do that it's it's a sort of Dogma before it becomes something that actually kills it's a sort of dogmatic thinking we should not be that way we don't carry a sword of Dogma well this is what our church teaches you got to be like us or you're not going to make it it's a sort of Dogma a sort of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshipers all down Through the Ages he said to well the Millions when Christ comes with the sword he's got a sword too for it's his word that proceeds out of his mouth what do we fight with we don't fight with emotion we don't fight with sensation we don't but it's the sword the word is the sword or the sword as they call it in Oklahoma the the word is the sword and and what is it Christ comes with his word not with a literal sword but with this word think about it for a minute the word that proceeds out of his mouth he'll say every enemy there is before him go read Revelation 19. again he said you might have killed 68 million of them down to these ages send sin maybe more but Jesus said he that takes the sword will perish by it what was it a sword of Dogma they took a sword of Dogma which actually become a literal sword and he takes a sword of the word and saves him now do you realize the age we live in the Bible said the word of God is quick it's alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword what is it the word of God Satan placed United the political Powers which he held and the spiritual powers that he held together made a church that sweeps into every nation he's put Millions times Millions after he jumped off from his White Horse onto his red horse he took his sword and went forth but God said with the same thing that he perverted watch what does he kill him with think about it the same thing he perverted or tried to by false teaching that same word will rise in power coming forth from the lips of Jesus Christ and shall say him and everything before him he said there's the second seal Hallelujah he said that's thus saith the Lord that's powerful huh I was talking to a preacher on the phone today and I said if you left a sermon what would you want the effect of that sermon to be what would be the greatest effect that a sermon could have think about it for a minute I I've thought deeply about this what would be the greatest effect that someone was healed that would be wonderful wouldn't it someone you you could raise the faith of people by preaching the word of God to somebody got healed It's a Wonderful effect it's an effect of the word but yet that wouldn't be the greatest effect even someone that was saved that would be a great effect and I believe that we're saved by the preaching of the word but I got to thinking about what preaching to the church day after day and year after year what do I want to see I want to see I want to see people leave with confidence in the message of the hour that what we believe is thus saith the Lord I'm not talking about every word and and then the things that people have taught the doctrines of devils that people have taught I'm talking about the message the message of the hour we don't serve brother Abraham we don't worship brother brown but I want to I want you to leave and I want you to recognize that the message of the hour is right and if you recognize that the message if I could get into your minds that the message of the hour is real that it that it affects you in your everyday life that there's something about if I can get you to dig in it if I can get you to love it if I can get you to to press into it I believe that's the greatest effect that my preaching could have to highlight the word of the day to emphasize on the word of the day the Lord's been dealing with me about that what do we put emphasis on we ought to put emphasis on the word of the hour and if I could get the emphasis the light to shine on the word of the hour I've done my job believe the holy spirit's done his job oh I trust you leave here and you can say I heard the words of a prophet I didn't just hear the words of my pastor I heard the words of a prophet and he said that's the saith the Lord amen amen Hallelujah musicians go ahead and come brother Branham talks about the little animals at the end of the second seal talks about the little birds he said they all in in India they said they have rock walls he said they all go to those walls and they hide in the heat of the day they hide in the cool of those walls he said the sheep and the cattle will gather around the walls lay there in the shade he said but he saw a headline in the paper said the earthquake must be over said because the birds are coming back and they talked about how that during this time before an earthquake ever came that the Sheep all huddled together in the middle of the field oh isn't that where you want to be in the middle of the field huddled together he said the Sheep all huddled together the cattle all huddled together the birds flew away why because those rock walls were going to become dangerous pretty soon and they sensed that something was going to happen they were warned by Instinct there was an earthquake coming or if he could warn the birds that there's danger coming he talked about that at the end of the second seal he said get away from those denominational walls you don't know what this message has done for us it's brought us out into the open brought us into the middle of the field where we could come together we're not just another church we're Believers together get away from those walls and begin to see God move once you bow your heads with me can we can you play let me walk with you Jesus you know that one F I believe I wonder if we could just talk to him for a minute I know it's a Wednesday night but we'll have church again on Sunday but aren't you don't you want to just take a minute and say Lord I believe your word is true I believe that what you promised will come to pass I believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever I believe in thus saith the Lord I believe it came in our day I believe that we have a message we can go forth we don't have to take our own swords and fight people but the sword is the word of the Lord Lord I want to thank you for that that's my prayer tonight Lord help me to recognize help me to put the emphasis on the right thing in my life help me to place you first in my life and everything Lord that said or done Lord and as we go we get busy in life but Lord as we're praying together now oh God lord may we may we put the emphasis on the right things or we don't emphasize even a crowd or or a bun or a bunch of people who believe like we do but Lord may we look to the message of the hour the light of the day and walk in that Lord and recognize where we live the Lord is very close to the end time I pray you granted Lord I pray you'd move in every home or those that are watching tonight maybe most of the church Lord sitting there and as many sick and gone I pray you can help them tonight Lord may we receive the spirit of wisdom or to understand what's happening in our day or walk with it not to become Lord a bunch of Fighters and or just to go against something but to recognize where we live and let the word do its work in our lives I pray you'd help us thank you Lord for calling us for electing us because we can see Lord of who you are what you're doing we thank you for it Jesus name amen whenever no never make Heaven my home oh no never get my and stand with me sing it tonight with all your heart oh soul he walked with Jesus [Music] Berlin oh could you lift your hands to even just sing and make it a prayer all for without you I could never [Music] ever make Heaven I've been on the
