I'm more than just surviving because of who is our win. I'm more than overcoming. I wear a crown of grace. This world can never take it. Let the hard times hear me say it.

I just love the words of that though. Amen. Amen. White as snow. Amen. Are you ready for the word of the Lord this evening? Amen. Certainly appreciate our brother Joel's sermon this morning speaking to our hearts. Amen. Just reminding us where we stand, what we believe in and and just a good reminder and a good builder for the youth. Amen. So, just looking forward to what the Lord has for us this evening. Amen. You have a need on your heart, just place that before the Lord as the word comes forth. Amen. Let's just worship him now and tell him, "Oh, hail King Jesus." Oh, hell king Jesus. Oh, hell man. Tell him tonight now. Oh, King of Kings, Lord of Lords. He's that bright morning star. Now it's through out eternity [Music] that I'm going to praise him. And forever more. I know that I amen. Amen. You believe it this evening. Sing it now. All hail King Jesus. [Music] Oh hell. be [Music] and throughout eternity I'm going to praise him and Forever more I will reign. One more time with all your hearts. Now let me hear you sing it. All hail King Jesus. All hail I manuel. [Music] He's the king of kings. Lord of lords, bright morning star. And throughout eternity I'm going to praise him. and forever more I will reign with him. How many believes that tonight? Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord again this evening and to sing praises to his name. Amen. All hail King Jesus. Amen. We don't have nobody to worship but him. &gt;&gt; Nobody deserves worship but him. &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it. Nobody deserves it. but he deserves all of the praise and the worship. Do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going that'd be all the singing for now. Let us go ahead and go right into the word. And if you have your Bibles, Psalm chapter 1 and verse one, just want to say it was a it was an honor for me to be able to stand here this morning and and speak to you people. You you you were you were wonderful. You amened and backed me and better than I deserved. I think you might have a me better than I was preaching, but I did enjoy it. And so, uh, if you can just do that tonight, we'll try to get out on time and and, uh, I did enjoy being with you this morning. Amen. How many's looking forward to what the Lord has for you this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't do nothing in myself, but I know that if he shows up, anything's possible. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to just depend on tonight is depending on, we're depending on him this evening. If you have your Bibles there, Psalms chapter 1 and verse one, blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful. You may be seated. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word this evening. Amen. If I could take a thought this evening, it would be in the seat of the scornful. And I know we've heard the story brother talks about he was in the seat of the scornful, and we'll get to all that at some point. But I do want to say tonight, I think too many of us are found in the seat of the scornful. &gt;&gt; Well, somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we come to church and we just decide to sit in the seat of the scornful. And sometimes I think we ought to we ought to change seats. Hallelujah. Amen. I think sometimes if you find yourself in that position, Amen. It would be a good thing to just go ahead and say, you know what, I'm not coming today to to be to to to pick on things. I'm not coming today. I'm not coming to see who's there and who's not there. I'm not coming to worry about how the service goes, but I'm here to worship. And if we're here to worship, then we can get out of the seat of the scornful long enough to actually worship. And I think that's important uh for the believers to do. Brother Brandon would actually say here, he said in the Psalms, David said, "Set not the sit not in the seat of the scornful and stand in the way of the ungodly." Say, "Don't put yourself in the way of the ungodly like that and sit in the seat of the scornful, making fun of them that are right and standing around saying it was a form of godliness. But he that delightth in the law of the Lord, he loves to do it. He shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water. His leaves shall not wither, and whatever he does will prosper. It will come to pass just exactly. That's the kind of a church that God wants. Blind leaders of the blind making in these last days, scoffers coming in and so forth. So you'll see that blind leaders will cause scoffers to arise among us. Can you say amen? But but a real church will be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water. Amen. you're not shaken by the thing that happens in the next service or or the way maybe you say, "Well, the uh well, you know, everything's out of out of cater today. We've got different musicians, different song leaders, different preachers." And and I I'll say that sometimes God lets those things happen to see how are you going to respond to those things. Amen. How many is willing to come and expect something from God? No matter who's standing in the pulpit, no matter who's singing, no matter who's playing instruments. Amen. What we we didn't come to see them anyway, but we came to receive from God. Can you say amen? Amen. So, so we've got people today and and you create scoffers in the church. You create people that are just scornful and they're they're picking at one another and they're they're always uh trying to to you know just always go after something in the church. You're too loud. You're too quiet. You're too you're just something there. You're just something wrong. Everybody some some people just everything's wrong. And if I'm not careful, Amen. the preachers get there too. You start looking at who's there and you start looking who's not there and the ones that aren't backing you and the ones that are backing you. And the truth is we get in the seat of the scornful too. But but what we need to do is when we come to the house of God to get out of the seat of the scornful and come and put everything aside and worship God in the way that he's worthy of it and in the way that he deserves to be worshiped. And so brother Brandon would go on like this. He said, "Oh church of the living God, believe this the truth. Here it is. When the true spirit of God moves upon the believer, whatever the scripture says, he'll say amen." &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? It's the Holy Ghost that wrote the Bible is in him pulsating his life. &gt;&gt; What can you say amen tonight? Amen. So you say why why should the church say amen? Why should the church response respond? It's because the Holy Ghost in you is responding to the word that is being preached. &gt;&gt; Is that okay tonight? And brother Brandon would go on like this. He said he don't care who is sitting around or what anybody else says. It'll always divvy with the word. There's there there is false. It's it's gourds. It's off of the wild vine. It's a great vine. Covers all the earth, but it's death. And a lot of that's been cast among the people. But remember, meal brings it back to life. Pluck it up and set it by a goodly place, which is Jesus Christ. Whatever his word is, let it be amen to you. Then the spirit of God, then spiritual joy will flow like a river. Somebody say amen. Amen. And I believe tonight if the spiritual joy is there, Amen. And if you put aside all the things that are distracting you and all the things that maybe you say, "Well, I've got a feeling against so and so." Make those things right and let's have church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Too often we're sitting in the seat of the scornful and we sit there so long that we get used to it. &gt;&gt; We get used to being scornful. We We get used to picking at everybody and we get used to not being happy in church and we get used to Come on, church. Can you say, "Amen. Amen. You don't know what I'm going through and I don't know what you're going through." But when we come in here, we're on an even ground. Amen. We're worshiping God. We're saying amen to the word of God. What what is it? It is the Holy Ghost responding to the word that is being preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it is something. It's a spiritual joy. He said, "That will flow like a river." He said it'd be like a man, a tree that's planted by the rivers of water. His leaves shall not wither. He'll not sit in the seat of the scornful or the unbeliever or the ungodly person that lives after the things of the world, but he'll bring forth fruits in its season. What kind of fruit? If you're planted in Christ, you'll bring forth spiritual fruit. Spiritual fruits of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Ghost lives in you. And so, so I I think we've got that settled tonight that if the Holy Ghost lives in you and the word is being preached, then something on the inside of you will just raise up and say, &gt;&gt; "It's exactly right." And so the and it means so be it. If the word is right, I think it deserves our attention. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying you always have to be loud, but sometimes I I think there needs to be some response. Amen. Some some some sign of life. Can you say amen? Amen. I listen. I I know there's a lot of I just go ahead and get there. I think these are in my notes somewhere. You know, I think a lot of times we look at fanaticism and we're so scared to be fanatical that we can't even have church. We're so scared that we're going to become a Pentecostal that we won't Well, can you say amen? We've got all kinds of people trying to tell you, hey man, we don't want to we don't want to shout. We don't want to run. We don't want to because there's there's false. Yes, there's false. Yes, there's fanatics. Yes. But but but listen, there couldn't be that without the real. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; Did you know that every one of these people that are that are mimicking God and trying to and and and that in itself is a form of godliness? Even if they're shouting and speaking tongues, many of those are also a form of godliness. But they deny the power the word thereof. But if you've accepted the word, you don't have to worry about that because you're not you're listen, you're not you're you're not sitting over here just mimicking something, but you have the real thing. The skies are full of the genuine. We are full of the genuine. Can you say amen? The word is in you. Amen. The word has come to you and we ought to be so happy that we can't contain our amens in church. But what happens is we get sitting in the seat of the scornful. And in the seat of the scornful, you're always looking at something that's wrong. You're always under expectation of something bad happening or the preacher the preacher saying something that might deceive you. I want to just go ahead and give you the good news tonight. If you're the elected of God, you cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm worried if we get too emotional, we we might become Pentecostals. I tell you what, brother Brandon would preach a sermon called Why I am a holy roller. I say, "Identify me with that." If you want to listen, church, he didn't come back for a dead bride, but there's got to be a living body on the earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I think too many of us, we're just too scared. Fear has bound the people. &gt;&gt; Watch a pastor that's always preaching fear. watch the congregation get scared to death. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; They're always getting, you know, we we don't want to get we don't want to be like them and we we got to be careful with the altar calls. We got to be careful with the prayer lines and we Well, can you say amen, man? We got to be we got to be careful because we might become we might become Pentecostal or or our kids might get down here and they might start speaking in tongues or shouting. I say let it happen. I say let our kids have their revival. I say get the wet blankets off of them. Let's have church. If you get out of the seat of the scornful, you can have church, too. &gt;&gt; Well, is this okay so far? I know this is way different than this morning, but this is just on my heart. And if it's on my heart, that's all I can preach. And so, y'all just bear with me and say amen as much as you can because if the Holy Ghost is in you, the prophet said, you'll say amen. Hallelujah. And I was looking for that quote for a long time. And when I found it, I was just just almost said amen myself. I like well there's a quote that says if the Holy Ghost is in people they'll say amen. And brother Brandon would excuse me the Bible here in 2 Samuel chapter 6 and verse 12 it goes like this. It was told King David saying the Lord blessed the house of Obedom and all that pertainth unto him because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Oed Edom into the city of David with glad David with gladness. And it was so that when they that bear the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. And David danced before the Lord with all his might. And David was girded with linen ephod. And so David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet. Oh, somebody ought to say that sounds like a good time. With shouting with the sound of a trumpet. And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michael, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart. I wonder what seat she was sitting in. &gt;&gt; Sounds like the seat of the scornful to me, doesn't it? Now in verse 20, uh 2 Samuel 6 and verse 20, David returned to bless his household. And Michael the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, "How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids and of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncoverth himself." She's rebuking David now. And David said unto Michael, "It was before the Lord, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore will I play before the Lord, and I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be based in mine own sight, and of the maid servants, which thou hast spoken of, and of them shall I shall I be had in honor." Therefore, Michael, the daughter of Saul, had no child until the day of her death. I want you to notice something. because she laughed at the spirit of God on David. &gt;&gt; God saw that as a curse. &gt;&gt; Listen, church, I you can make fun of what you can make fun of me all you want to. You can make fun of what we do all you want to, but don't make fun of the moving of the spirit. You say, "Well, I know it's fanaticism." You may not know it's fanaticism. Somebody may be screaming in the spirit and you say, "Well, I've seen them do that 10 times before." Well, this time might be the real thing. Amen. I say if Come on, church. You say, "Well, brother Joel's on his Pentecostal kick again." I am a little bit. And I'll tell you why. Because you know what we've got is we've got too many people trying to say they believe the message and then trying to preach a god of the Methodist church or the Baptist church and trying to take the altars out of the church and trying to take the prayer lines out of the church and trying to take the spirit of God out of the church. But I say if the spirit of God is here, then there'll be liberty in the house of God to worship. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; We We don't need to work something up or make something happen, but we do need to have the freedom to worship God in the way that's called crazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you say, "Well, brother Joel, why would we ever want to do that?" Because he's worthy. &gt;&gt; When David when David saw the ark, he danced because it excited him that the ark was coming down the road. Amen. There was an excitement there. And I wonder if we could see that the word is being revealed again in our hearts. The the open book that's already here, it is in our hearts and we can see the message. That ought to make somebody happy. It don't sound like we got a right to be sad if we got the living God amongst us. No, we've got a right to shout. If anybody's got a right to shout, we got a right to shout. If anybody's got a right to scream out in the spirit, we got a right to scream out in the spirit. If God moves on you to do it, listen, we don't make it happen. You don't sit there and say, "Well, when the when the song gets to a certain part, I I'm going to start screaming her." No, no, no, no. But when the Lord moves upon you, when the Lord moves upon your heart, then you can dance like David. When the Lord moves upon you to say, says say amen. You ought to say amen. When the Lord move, come on, church. When the Lord moves you, then we need to be willing and able to move with the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's no reason to hold back and say, "Well, well, they'll call me a fanatic or a Pentecostal. I I don't think that matters what they call us, church." They're they're going to call you all kinds of things. They're going to say you're old uh some old fogy and you and you dress like a you you dress like a Menite and they're going to call you all kinds of things. But can I go ahead and tell you something? You're going to face a lot of criticism. We might as well have fun doing it. &gt;&gt; Ain't no reason to let the devil steal your joy in the house of God. &gt;&gt; And there you say, "Well, so and so criticized me. So and so needs to change seats. &gt;&gt; They're in the seat of the scornful. &gt;&gt; They're sitting over there laughing at the spirit of God." Listen, I understand. I I I've told you it before and I'll tell you again. I know there's fanatics and I understand all these things, but don't let that scare you from the real genuine moving of the Holy Spirit in the house of God. &gt;&gt; And ain't nobody ever accused us of being Pentecostal. We We If you accuse us of being Pentecostal, you need to come sit through an afternoon service. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon would say it like this. He said, "When I first come," he said, he's going to testify. He said, 'When I first come amongst the Pentecostal people and seen them dance on the floor. He said, 'Th that was just too much for my self-style Baptist ways. He said you know I said look you here now dancing belongs out other type of people said not religious people I hear the music go to playing the people go to crying go to shouting after a while somebody start dancing I said well I I don't want to be critical but I I'm afraid to say something against God that wouldn't be right even in his way of even in the seat of the scornful &gt;&gt; he didn't want to criticize it &gt;&gt; but he sat there in his heart thinking that couldn't be right he said but you know I can't get that and said wish I could see that in the Bible and one night I was having teaching on a chart and the second coming of Christ. And from Louisville, Kentucky come a group of people over there with some young ladies and one of them was a piano player and the other one had symbols and a washboard. Yes. He had drums in the church that night if you're counting. He had symbols and a washboard and my they was making as much music out of that as a brass band. And and he said, "So I was teaching on the second coming and and then a few days before that I'd been up to Salem, Indiana, and there was some Pentecostal people just getting acquainted with them and they were dancing and going on. I got to running uh reference and I found out then that dancing the first time I noticed it, Miriam began to dance and I thought, well, that must be from God and the devil just patterned it off of that. Well, can you say amen? I I think the devil's taken a lot of our stuff and tried to make it look like it was the world's idea. But what they did, they stole it from us. &gt;&gt; He said he said, "Then the next I noticed that David danced when he saw the ark coming down the road." See, and I thought, my that's wonderful. And I noticed the king had made a a vow one time and he vowed that he'd sacrifice the first thing that come from his house and here come his daughter and and the daughter rejoicing, dancing. I noticed how dancing was victory. And I thought, well, maybe I just hadn't got enough victory. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe just a little bit of self has to die out yet. I wonder if we could say it here tonight. Maybe we just need a little bit of self to die out tonight where we can be free in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; You wonder who's looking at you and who's talking about you and who's going to who's going to rebuke you and who's sitting in the seat of the scornful and who's not. I want to tell you, you just get out of the seat of the scornful and worship God. Come on, church. When the word has come forth, it will move the believer because of the Holy Ghost on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this. He said, "Maybe just a little bit of self has to die out." It wasn't long after that I was sitting there and I got through teaching on the second coming of Christ and know the spirit of God just taking our time moving and it was on a New Year's night. So, I'd been teaching about two hours. Now, he was teaching two hours and they were still having a good time. Somebody say amen. He said, "My tabernacle." So they was going to have a special and I believe got some folks from Louisville back there and some of them wrote a little note and put on there and said one had to play a special. Well I said come ahead. So they three or four ladies got up there and one got on the piano and she started playing there's going to be a meeting in the air and and when she started just raised up started the symbols and on this voice core and then heating the tin can. Well come on somebody. We're worried about what instruments we do have and he's got ten cans in the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he said voice core tin can. And he said, "My it got pretty good, you know." And he said, "I noticed there." Then after a while, there was a little girl jumped out on the floor there and started dancing up and down, jumping around. And here he was again. He said, "Oh, right in my own church. Here it is." He said, "Now sure," he said, "I'll get ruined for this." I kept watching her, and you know, I kept hearing here at this here in real the lady playing on that piano till I believe if there had been three or four decks of keys, she could have played them all. And she was playing this God's own son will be the leading one at the beginning of the air. and she had no more than than halfway got out of that until she'd be starting again. I thought, hm. And she just got real white in the face and her eyes closed and playing like that. I thought, say, I got to feeling pretty good. Got to patting my foot with that girl, you know. I thought, well, maybe that's just my Methodist foot anyhow. So, I started patting it a little bit, you know. And so, so, you know, it wasn't very long till I was out there with that girl dancing. Oh, come on, church. This is the prophet of God who was out on the floor dancing. And you want to criticize a move of the spirit in the house of God? Come on, church. What we've done is we've let some tradition of some man tell us we can't worship no more. But that's not what a prophet of God taught you. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And we've got we got the people so bound by fear that that that if they shouted in church, we'd probably have a deacon take them out. Or if they if they got to run in the aisles, we'd probably have to pull them in the office afterwards. I say, "Let God be God. And if the spirit of the Lord is here, let the liberty be in the house of God now." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's it." He said, 'You know, it wasn't very long I was dancing with that girl. Well, that's what it takes, isn't it? The victory. We need the victory here tonight. Just get away from self and let the Holy Spirit have the right away. Well, it said decently and orderly. It'll be decently in order. Just let it go and let the Holy Spirit. Come on, church. You want everything to be I've heard it sane and sensible. I've heard that preached time and time again. I want to go ahead and tell you what saint and sensible is. Lose your mind and get the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's sane and sensible. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, saint insensible ain't quiet. That's Methodist tradition. Sing insensible is losing your mind and letting him have his way however he wants to have his way. &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay. &gt;&gt; Queen of Sheba, she had an expectation when she was coming and she was determined. There was something inside of her moving her and the deep was calling to the deep, something calling till she was thirsting and hungering for a taste of the righteousness of almighty God. And she would pull through anything to get to it. And finally, she arrived at the gate. Now, she didn't come to stay for just one night or sit in and wait till the pastor preached a little bit and said something was against her theology, then she'd pick up her hat and go home. No, no. That's that's sitting in the seat of the scornful right there. Amen. That shows, Brother Ram talked about that shows you're raising. If you get up and go out because the preacher says something a little against your theology, I want to go ahead and tell you something that that ain't message believers. That that's not us. We don't we don't get up and fly off the handle because the pastor said something that maybe you didn't like or didn't agree with. No. Go search the scriptures. Go study for yourself. Amen. We don't fly off the handle and and get in the flesh over something and say, "Well, well, I I didn't like that sermon that the pastor preached. If you just open your heart, maybe it was exactly what you needed." &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, you're too hard. Give Just give me a little grace tonight. I'm going to try to get through it, okay? He said, "Just uh" he said she'd pick up her hat and go home. He said, "No." He said, "Uh, that shows poor raising to begin with." He said, "I don't like the way they conduct the services. I'll take my camels and turn back." She said, "I'll take my camels and turn back." No, Jesus never would have said about her what he did if she had had that attitude. &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, the devil is going to show you plenty to criticize. If you come to find fault, the devil's going to show you plenty of fault. Can the church say amen? The devil's going to show you plenty. But but if you come hungering and thirsting for God, and the angels of God will direct you to the spot to find it. Well, can you say amen? If you come hungering and thirsting, you will get what you expect. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every service you get what you expect. I I &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I know sometimes we come w and we're tired and and you're not expecting much. And I understand that. It happens to every one of us and and I understand that sometimes you you've had a bad day. And I understand all these things and and humanity gets in our way of a good service a whole lot of times. But I want you to know if you can ever just come under expectation that God's going to move for your situation, God's going to move for your children, God's going to move for your church, God's going to move in this service, God's going to heal the sick. Come on, church. God can do even the things that that are unexpected at times because what you did in your heart, you said, "Lord, I'm coming with humility. I'm coming with expectations that you are going to move on my behalf here tonight. Even when I don't feel like being in church, I know God can move on the situation that I have. Maybe there's something in your heart tonight where you say, "Well, I I I I I just don't I, you know, my family's gone or or maybe I I feel like I don't have the Holy Ghost or maybe I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost." I tell you what, all the you'll have some of them are sitting there, Brother Joel, we don't like the altar calls that you've been calling. We Well, I tell you, get out of the seat of the scornful. Maybe instead of condemning them, maybe you ought to join them once in a while. What you what you find out is if you ever get down there, you realize it's a humbling experience. It's not you don't just go to the altar just to make a show. You don't go to the through a prayer line just to make a show. Come on, church. But you're doing that because you're humbling yourself to the will of God. And if he tugs at your heart to go to the altar, don't let nothing stop you. Don't let no scornful person stop you. Don't let nobody that's sitting over there criticizing stop you. Listen, the critics ain't going to get you to heaven, but that tug on your heart will lead you and guide you into all truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this. He said, "If you come to criticize, the devil is going to show you plenty." And he goes on like this. He said, "If you come with a a sar sarcastic criticism, whatever you expect to see, that's just what you'll see." He said, "If you come expecting to be just disappointed, that that's what you'll that's what you'll get." He said, "If you come to receive, you will be expecting to receive, and you shall receive just what you expect to receive." God always does that. He sworn to his word. And the church said, So if you come tonight expecting something from God, then God's going to give you something here tonight. &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't know how any more plain to put it. But I can tell you, if you come under expectation for revival, you can have revival. &gt;&gt; If you come under expectation for God to move on your young people, God's going to move on your young people. If you come Well, can the church say amen? What what I'm telling you tonight is I'm not trying to work you up into into anything, but I'm telling you your expectations are wrong when you're sitting in the seat of the scornful because all you can do there is look, well, so and so went to the altar and maybe you should have went. So and so got prayed for. You know, I wonder what they're going through. I wonder what kind of demon they got on them. I I Come on, church. What we've done is we have we have we have started looking at everybody else's problems and we've started picking on people and how they worship. I say what we need to do is in the way that's called crazy. That's the way you need to worship God. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a message church calling you crazy. I don't care if it's the Baptist calling you crazy. I don't care who's calling you crazy. If it's crazy to the world, then I say it's probably good in the sight of God &gt;&gt; because what what what man calls good is often not very good. What what God calls good is is very different than what we call good. But I want to say tonight, Brother Brandon would say like this. If you expect to come just to find something, the devil will sure show you plenty. He will. See, you get what you expected. He goes on. He said, he said there, he said, uh, I'm expecting tonight to see the Holy Spirit come and manifest itself in power pour out in his glory up in the building here. Many receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Sinners weep their way to Calvary. Sick be healed. All manners of signs and wonders because Jesus Christ has promised it. And I believe his promise. If you believe his promise, then you come with expectations. He said, "You'll only see what you're looking for. If you come here tonight looking for Christ, you'll see him." Can you say amen? If you come here tonight, he said, "If you come here to criticize, you'll have plenty on your hand to criticize." Depends on what you're looking for. &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "Now, of everything that God has, the devil has a counterfeit." Now, we've talked about that already, but Brother Brandon tells about it here. He said, "You go and whatever you want to do, you'll find like these old dances that's of the devil. But God has a holy dance for the people." The Bible said so. He said, 'I was one of the greatest critics of that you ever seen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God was. &gt;&gt; He said, "Till God told me just what to do." And he told that story earlier. I read in the quote, he said that Miam danced in the spirit and David danced when he had the victory. And oh, many times it was all through. It was victory. It was a dancing. It was holy dancing. For instance, in the Bible, if a dreamer dreamed a dream or a prophet prophesied, they had a plate called the German thumb. The German thumb and that went over the breast of Aaron. And when they went before this plate and spoke and them lights flashed on the plate, God would sanction it that it was the truth. Is that right? He said, "If it didn't speak on there, then it was wrong." Now look, the devil come around in a pattern of that and took a crystal ball. So, I want you to know that the devil's got a crystal ball to show you, well, this is what you're doing. Or the devil's got a worldly dance to tell you, well, this is what it looks like. Come on, church. The devil's got all kinds of impersonations of speaking in tonesues. But there is a real true speaking in tonesues. &gt;&gt; There is a true. Just because there's a false $100 bill, you're still going to have a $100 bill in your pocket if you got one. You didn't start throwing away your money because there's counterfeit. &gt;&gt; Well, let's stay right here for a minute. &gt;&gt; You didn't go home and empty your cash drawers. If you do, give it to me. I could use it. &gt;&gt; If you're going to get rid of a of a of stuff because the devil's got a counterfeit, get rid of all your money. Don't tell me you got love because the devil sure counterfeited that. &gt;&gt; The devil's got all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; But why is it that we want to do away with the move of the spirit out of the church because there's a counterfeit to it. &gt;&gt; There's a real &gt;&gt; and the believers know that when the spirit of the Lord is moving you, we don't hold back and start criticizing. No, we say, "Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; I'll take whatever he's got for me. If it makes me want to shout, then I'll shout. If it makes me want to dance, then we'll dance. If it makes me want to say amen, then the church can say amen. Listen, church, we've got all this stuff that's that's counterfeit and we're so scared of it and we're so fearful of it. I say cast down fear. &gt;&gt; Cast down reasoning. Cast down all these things. Amen. I I believe it was brother Matthew McGary spoke a sermon here. He said we he said, "Have you lost your mind?" And I'll say tonight, we need to lose our minds and take on that mind of Christ that that we don't start thinking like we used to think. We don't need to start thinking, well, you know what? When you get your own mind and your own intellectual thinking, you'll have a certain service going a certain way and you'll have certain people that have got certain problems and you don't want to be around them. And you'll start, well, can you say amen? Well, I don't want to hang out with them because they they they got all kinds of problems there. And I don't want to go to this meeting over here because the young people screamed or the shouted. I don't want to go to this youth camp. Well, can you say amen what it is? You're sitting in the seat of the scornful. If you get out of the seat, you'll see God move for you, too. &gt;&gt; He's no respector of persons. He don't want to just give it to one and not the other. No, the rain falls on the just and the unjust. But what we've decided is it just falls on the unjust. No, it falls on the just, too. &gt;&gt; It falls on the just and the unjust. So, the just can't have it no more. We got to dry up. &gt;&gt; We're scared to death. We got &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord anyway. Is it is it is it true or not? &gt;&gt; And what I'm saying is there's a spirit and I'm thanking the Lord that we have a church where we can preach freely and the people receive it. I love that. I I am I'm I love you people more than you can imagine. And I I haven't preached out a lot, but the few times I have, I a lot of times I just want to go home. &gt;&gt; And because, you know, you people are pretty easy to preach to. And I I appreciate that. And I I you know, I haven't been preaching very long. And I understand I I know my limitations and and all those things. And you guys still sit here. You you knew I was preaching this afternoon and you still came back. And so I love you for that. I really do. I think more of you than I ever did. But I want to tell you this. We got to be careful to let the spirit of a cold church, formal church come in here, too. &gt;&gt; Because the devil would like nothing more than the word of God being preached across this pulpit and the people sit there and get nothing out of it. &gt;&gt; He don't care if it's being preached if the people aren't receiving it. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. He don't care if the preacher standing here and and and preaching exactly the word of God as long as the people don't catch what he's saying. And and so tonight you I know this morning was very different and and I enjoyed preaching this morning maybe a little more but tonight I feel like what we're fighting in this hour is even when the word goes forth it's a spirit of of Leodysia that's on us that you know we can move a little bit but we're lukewarm. We're not cold or hot. And I tell you that's the that that's the church that God said he would spew out of his mouth. He said you this is his words. He said you nauseate me. I don't want to be a church that nauseates God. I want to be a church that's on fire for God. Amen. He's pleased with our worship. He's pleased with the way we come to church under expectations. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me so far? Brother Brandon would go on like this. He said, he said, "The devil come around pattern patterned that and took a crystal ball." He said, "Now I wonder." He said, "You got your feet converted. You don't dance anymore out there for the world." He said, "Let's patter our feet to the Lord." He said, "As your hands converted, you don't steal anymore. Your lips are converted. You don't lie anymore. Just get Don't just" He said, "Just don't get religion in your head. get it all over you. &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds like Pentecostal preaching, but I'd say amen to it. &gt;&gt; Because we don't just need a headnowledge religion. We don't just need a religion that makes us go to church because we feel that we're obligated to go to church. We need a religion that makes us want to go to church. &gt;&gt; We need a religion that makes us want to praise God in church. The preacher shouldn't have to pull for it or pump you for it. He shouldn't have to beg you to say, "Amen." I do it out of habit. I'm not really begging, &gt;&gt; but the people respond anyway. &gt;&gt; The people respond. Listen, I hope this is okay tonight. This is on my heart. Listen, we don't want to fall into the trap of the of the of the devil that is even using message quotes and saying, "Well, we got to stabilize the ship and and we've got to be sane and sensible." All they're trying to do is get you away from the blessings that God has given his bride. &gt;&gt; Trying to use quotes to do it. &gt;&gt; And they're taking them so out of context. We are a balanced people. We are a people that we know where we stand and we are anchored to the rock. We are a ship that's not going to be moved with every wave that comes around, but we can still worship. &gt;&gt; See, you can still be anchored to Revelation and still have a good time in church. &gt;&gt; I, you know, here we go. I I I remember as a kid uh in our church, we didn't have a lot of emotion. uh you know, didn't seem like and uh and so and then I ended up in a church uh for about 10 years. They were real emotional for a while and then it kind of just died out and and the next thing you know it was so quiet in there like it's so quiet that when you hear the term you could hear a pin drop. You really could hear a pin drop at any point during the service. So So I I I've been in dead churches. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you calling them dead?" I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; if the spirit of the Lord was there, there would be some liberty to say amen. But the last time I went, when I said amen to something, there was a preacher there said something. And I went and I said, "Amen." And and people, you've heard the quote where Brother Bram said, "Somebody say amen." And everybody start looking around at him. I I've I've witnessed that. And I'm I'm here to tell you. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's a dead church. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, you don't call me a dead church." You're a dead church if that's what you got going on. You need to get them people out of that dead mully grubs and get them back into the life of God again. You say, "Well, I we got the message. We got the tapes. We you might have all those things, but what you need is to fall in love with Jesus again and worship him like you've never worshiped before. &gt;&gt; That's the truth anyway. &gt;&gt; And so people can do what they want in their church. But to you people here today, let's not fall into that. Let's not we don't want that condition. We don't want to We don't want Brother Joe when he comes back to be walking around checking for pulse. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be checking for pulse in our church. If you're checking for pulse, then there's something wrong. We need to be we need to be a lively group of people. There's listen, lively stones. And and listen, I I know there's a time where where there's teaching and I know there's a time where where it gets so somber and and I know there's been a time I've seen the spirit of the Lord move into a service and it's quiet and and I don't want to criticize that. I don't want to criticize that at all because that's just as real as the emotional side where everybody's jumping and running. It's just as real. So, we don't want to go one extreme here and one extreme there. No, we want everything that God's got for us. And so if the Lord moves in a service and and the people sit there and the Lord does nothing but move them to cry and and maybe some of them just sit there in the stillness of the moment, the Holy Spirit's just all over them and maybe it makes you not move a muscle, but that's very different than falling asleep in church. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Very different. It's very different for the sweet Holy Spirit to be sitting on somebody and the Holy Ghost just working all through them and they're quiet. It's a whole lot different than somebody come in there, fold their arms, sit in the seat of the critics and they'll tell you that somebody in the church didn't be like, "Man, them people wouldn't even clap their hands." I'm the song leader sometimes. I know exactly who don't clap their hands. But I'll tell you, you know what it is? Everybody worships different. There's some people, I won't tell you who it is in our church, but there's some people that can't clap and sing at the same time. I've told them just clap. No, nobody can hear you anyway, but just clap. But but you know, the truth of it is everybody's everybody's got different ways of worship. I don't care which way you worship. But I tell you what you got to do is worship. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what you don't want to do is is get Let me just go ahead and open up to you because I'm about out of time and I might as well just say what's on my heart. might as well do it. You know, this is my last service. This morning I had to come back and preach again, but tonight I can get out of dodge. &gt;&gt; But you know what the truth of it is? We come under we come we we come to service sometimes and even myself if you're a song leader, song leaders will know this. Sometimes you sit there and the first thing you notice is the people who are not worshiping. &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what shows you that the devil's trying to get your eyes on that &gt;&gt; because that it's true. I'm just opening it up and being honest with you. That's the first thing you see is you see the ones that it's why I said I know who don't clap because that's literally who I see first. I don't see who claps. I see who don't clap. And then I also you you'll see the ones that are singing with you and worshiping got their hands up. But but but what you really notice is the ones who don't worship. &gt;&gt; And you know what that is? That's me sitting in the seat of the scornful. &gt;&gt; That's just the truth of it. &gt;&gt; Now, how do you get out of that? Sometimes it sometimes it don't come. Sometimes I sometimes I rebuke you for not clapping or something, but but you know that's just me being stupid. I just got to grow. But but the truth of it is y'all have got a lot of grace on me and I appreciate that. But the truth of it is we can criticize one another, but we all need more of God. &gt;&gt; I can pick on I can find things in your life and you can find things in my life. We can we can we can sit there and we can just have a day picking on one another and how we worship and how we act. And listen, I don't want to pick on your worship, but I want us to all worship. &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this, if we're sitting there and and we're saying, "Well, they didn't raise their hands like they should." I you know what we could do? We could pray for people &gt;&gt; and that might do a lot of good. But the main thing that I want to get to you today is let us get out of the seat of the scornful because you ain't doing nobody no good sitting there. It's time to change seats. It's time to get out of that seat and and quit coming to church looking for the ones I'm I'm preaching to myself, too. It's time to quit looking at the ones that don't worship. It's time Let you be the firehouse for God. &gt;&gt; Let you be the revival for God. And if you're on revival, you know, a wildfire, it kind of spreads. You get one person in church that likes to likes to shout a little bit and just let's let's loosen the presence of God. The next thing you know, somebody else might do it. I know somebody will criticize and say, "Well, they never did it before, but now they're doing it." Well, maybe they felt free to do it now all of a sudden. Listen, I ain't going to criticize how you worship, but we must worship God. The true worshippers must worship God in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; I don't have any Bible that says that we can't worship on a certain time during the service or we can only worship at the end. Listen, I know there's a pattern to service and I know there's a church order, but I also have a quote that says you need to get out of order long enough to get saved. &gt;&gt; And we got some young people here that need to see God move in their lives. We got some old people here that need to see God moving in their lives. We got some people need the Holy Ghost. I don't want to see the wet blankets on our young people. I don't want to see them go through a time when the Holy Spirit moves on them to move and we've somebody sitting back behind them. Well, they're just going to the altar like they do every service. Let them go until they get something from God. &gt;&gt; Every young person needs an experience. Let them go till they get their experience. And we ain't going to do no good if we're always telling them, "Well, you went last week. You don't need to go again." No. encourage them and let them say, "Listen, if you didn't get what you went for, go right on back again. The altar is always going to be open in this church here." Why? Because we believe that an altar experience still works. &gt;&gt; We absolutely do. We still believe in prayer lines. We still believe in laying hands on the sick. We still believe in somebody getting down to the altar and crying out to God, right? All all by themselves. We still believe in all these things. Why? Because God is not the author of confusion. And he placed these things in the church not to take them out, but he left them here so that we could have access to different ways of reaching the people. Listen, if it's an altar for you and maybe another person received the same Holy Ghost in their seat, don't criticize the one at the altar. &gt;&gt; Well, I received it right in my seat. I received it in my in my closet, my prayer closet. You may have. And another person might have got in a prayer line. Another person I'm just being honest with you today, church. We we we've decided how God's got to move for our young people and how God's got to move for our old people. But I say every one of us need a new experience with God. Every one of us need to cry out, "Lord, come by my way and refill me with the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Every one of us, if you're in the seat of the scornful tonight, I say, "Get out of the seat and worship God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was up there in the woods there and he you remember the you remember that uh you remember that that big eagle that come down there and and and and he was sitting there and he had this little he had this little uh what do you call it? a brown squirrel, I believe it was. And and he had a brother Bram calls him snickler fritz actually in the quote I brought out, but uh I don't know if that's what he was a pine squirrel, maybe. Was that what he was? A pine squirrel. And he's down there and he he's making all kinds of noise, chatter, chatter, chatter. You know, days of miracles has passed. Brother Brandham said, and he would just, you know, brother Brandon was interpreting that squirrel. Hallelujah. And he was telling us what he said. And days of miracles has passed and you know, there's no more divine healing and all these things. But you know, that that comes on the minds of some of us sometimes. We don't see healing like we want to. And and I thank God for the blessings in the meeting. We see people getting healed and it really raises your faith. It really does. But but sometimes if we're not careful, even us, even even believers will sit there, well, you know, it's all drying up. It's all and we focus on the negative so much &gt;&gt; that we forget that there is a positive, that there will be a bride. &gt;&gt; We forget that there is a positive. There's another generation raising up in this message. And yes, it's it's scary at times because you think, you know, it's going to fall on our shoulders to make sure that next generation gets everything they have have need of and and we don't run them off like the previous generations have been done. &gt;&gt; A lot of people sit in the seat of the scornful for all these years and have run off generations of message people. &gt;&gt; I say it's time we stop that nonsense &gt;&gt; and we start letting our young people be young people. &gt;&gt; I know. I know some of the old-timers around here are going to tell me I'm wrong on this, but I want you to know I I I grew up different than you did. You grew up different than they did, and you do not have the same devil of technology to fight that they do. &gt;&gt; You don't have it. Well, &gt;&gt; I can I have five minutes? &gt;&gt; Okay. Because I think I'm about five over already. But you think about it. These people are growing up with stuff that they have access to that you didn't even know existed. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's the same devil." It is, but it gets worse and worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Every generation, it gets worse and worse. And that's why every generation has got to have their revival. &gt;&gt; Because the same God that saved you, Brother Bill, the same God that saved you, Brother Jeff, the same God, the same brother Danny, these elders sitting here, that same God is still able to save a young person. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he did it for you, he can do it for them. I know we're fighting a battle. I know that there's a that there's a lot against our young people, but greater is he that is in them than he that is in the world. And so I instead of criticizing the youth, what about saying, you know what, I'm going to start praying for them. I'm going to start getting down before the Lord and realizing they're fighting a battle I never fought. And I'm going to say, Lord, don't let me criticize the youth, but let me pray for them. And if they got to if they got to act like children a little bit, let them act like children. You you got to learn to crawl before you can learn to walk. &gt;&gt; Y'all okay with me so far? &gt;&gt; All right, we're just about done. Brother Brandham said he wants soldiers backbones, not wishbones. He wants somebody that's got spunk enough and spirit enough to stand up. And he said, "I saw God in that eagle there. He wasn't afraid. He wasn't a bit scared. He wasn't scared of that little of that little chatter that said the days of miracles in the past. I'm not scared of it either because I know that the word of God that I stand on is an unmovable rock. Amen. I know that what God has given us in this hour is a message that cannot be shaken from my heart. Can you say amen? And I know that if I believe this message with all my heart and I and I follow this message, then I'm not going to fall in some ditch of man-made theology and I'm not going to fall in this ditch over here of of anti-emotion or pro emotion only. No, but I'm going to stay with the word and the spirit because that's how a true worshipper worships God. And here tonight, if you're sitting in the seat of the scornful and you're laughing at those who danced and you're laughing at those who shouted, listen, I know that the devil's going to give you plenty to laugh at. But I want you to notice tonight that there's a lot of real going on in the message today. And I want to say that I've seen our young people in a prayer line and they'd lose themselves in that prayer line. You think for one minute I want to call that a devil? No, sir. I say that was the Holy Ghost on them. And and if they need if if it wasn't real that time, I'm going to be pulling for them to get it on the next time. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, that was just an emotion. I say let it let it be emotion if that's what it is. But I want you to know that the same God that give that gave it to the other one down at the other end of the line can give it to the one at this end of the line. Listen, it's not about who's who. It's not about what your name is. It's not about it's not about how old the young person is or how young they are. But God is no respector of persons. God will pour his spirit out on all flesh. But the bride knows what he wants done with his word. And the bride is going to be so stimulated by revelation that you don't see you you don't look through the eyes of the critics anymore but you actually see what God has for you through the lens of the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said he would talk to that eagle. He said he said I thought I'll just see how afraid he is. Fella, you know I could shoot you. When my voice rang out, he looked at me real close and rolled them big eyes. There was no fear. And I wanted to say tonight in closing because my time is passed up. I want to say tonight in closing, there is no fear in the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan will try to give you fear. He'll try to give you anxiety. He'll try to make you look at people and think the worst about him. &gt;&gt; But this bride knows that there is no limit to what God can do. &gt;&gt; The worst person in this building this afternoon can be saved, sealed, and delivered by God. the worst person in the building. Start looking down on one another. What you find is legalism always breeds hypocrisy. &gt;&gt; I've always been good. I've always been I've always did everything right. And you've just you've been just as vile as the worst sinner in town. &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for God's grace, where would any of us be? &gt;&gt; His grace and mercy brought us through. Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm I don't have any right to criticize somebody that God's working on &gt;&gt; because God may have them at the beginning of their journey and maybe I'm in the middle of my journey, but wherever we are, let's build each other up and get out of the seat of the scornful. &gt;&gt; Is that okay today? &gt;&gt; I know this has been kind of simple. This is what was on my heart. You can call us holy rollers. You can call us what you want to, but we know there's going to be a rapture. And all we want is those who are struggling to get on board. &gt;&gt; Overcome. You're you're not going to overcome by by running them down and running them out of the church. &gt;&gt; They're going to overcome a whole lot better sitting right here in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Joel, who you talking to today?" I'm talking to me. It ain't right for me to stand here and think evil of the people of God when his thoughts of you were good thoughts. Right. &gt;&gt; It ain't right for me or anybody else to stand here and criticize God's elect when you were literally chosen &gt;&gt; to be the greatest people on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; And I say it don't just go for me, but it goes for every one of us. You can criticize all you want to. Amen. But it don't hurt nobody but you. the people that are going that they can look beyond the critics. But I want you to know tonight, let us all get rid of our critical spirits and let's get out of the seat of the scornful and pull together in this great army of God and shout when we need to shout and say, "Young people, if you need an experience that is a Pentecostal experience, then have your experience and the old people are going to pull right along with them." &gt;&gt; If you ain't pulling for nobody else, pull for somebody else. Don't If you ain't pulling for yourself, pull for somebody else. You say, "Well, I I just don't feel like it anymore." then get on board for the rest of the people. I think our pastor preached it here last week. If you don't feel like there's anything left for you to receive, &gt;&gt; do it for somebody else. &gt;&gt; When David couldn't build the temple, sir, &gt;&gt; I believe that brother Ben said this. When he couldn't build the temple, he still made sir. &gt;&gt; He still made the nails. &gt;&gt; If that's all I can do, then Lord, let me do it and let me get out of the seat of the scornful. Let's stand as our musicians come. You love the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Has he been good to us? What do we deserve? Nothing. &gt;&gt; But what does he deserve? &gt;&gt; All of our praise. &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve life, but here we are. We didn't deserve the message, but here we are. We're unworthy. Unworthy. Anybody else feel like that? I feel unworthy to stand in this pulpit. Every time I stand here, it crosses my mind that I shouldn't be in this pulpit because I'm unworthy. But can I go ahead and tell you something? You're unworthy. I'm unworthy. But the blood has covered every one of us. And where would I be if it wasn't for the grace of God? Brother Jared, where would you be if it wasn't for the grace of God? If it wasn't for grace, none of us could sit here and feel the presence of God we feel right here tonight. I want to tell you something, church. If you're sitting there and you still got that critical spirit on you, I say it's time to repent of that thing and lay it down at the altar tonight. Let us sing all with all of our hearts. Now, if you need to come to the altar, it's always open. God bless you. You only know. I'm glad you see. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case, an empty place. If not, oh, think about his grace here tonight. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. was a hopeless case, an empty place. If not, oh precious Lord, oh precious Lord, please take my hand. Won't you lead me on and let me stand? I was a hopeless case and empty. And when you realize it was all grace, it'll make it'll make you look at your brother and sister different, won't it? Won't it make you look at him different? When you realize it took grace for you, it took grace for me. Without his grace, none of us could be here today. But aren't you thankful for the grace and mercy of God? Amen. If you've experienced that grace, I wonder if you just put a hand up to him tonight and empty. This is where we all were. If not for grace, [Music] where would I be? You only Oh, you only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case, an empty case. If not for grace, one more time. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now that he's found here today, I was a hopeless place, an empty place. If not, mercy rewrote my life. King of G. Oh mercy rewrote my life with all your hearts now. I'm glad that mercy r my life. [Music] Oh, I should have fallen. My soul cast down, but his mercy rerote my life. One more time. Oh, I'm glad his mercy rewrote my mind. Oh, it was his mercy [Music] reo my Oh, aren't you thankful for his mercy tonight? Oh yes, I should have fallen. My soul cast down but mercy rerote my life. Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight. Aren't you thankful for his mercy? Aren't you thankful for his grace? Anybody want to witness tonight of his grace and mercy? &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for that grace and mercy, none of us, &gt;&gt; none of us, Brother Bruce would be here tonight. I don't care how good you've been or how bad you've been. His grace is sufficient &gt;&gt; for all of your needs here tonight. When you think about his goodness and all that he's done for you, then how can you not cry out hallelujah? Thank God for saving me. He's worthy of it all. Can we sing that one? Worthy of it all. Do you believe he's worthy of our praise this afternoon just for a few moments? Let's worship now. Worthy of it all. Oh yes, you are. You are worthy. Oh yes, you are. Oh, for from you are all things and to you all things you deserve. Oh yes, you are worthy. You are worthy of it all, Lord. You are worthy. &gt;&gt; of it all.

I tell you, when I start singing the fast songs in the Pentecostal G, I just enjoy it. But I tell you, we we I know I know some of you got to go. I know some of you going back to school tomorrow. So, just remember our kids in prayer. Amen. And and the things that they're going to be facing in the coming school year and some of you at home. We're praying for you, too, because of your parents. And and so, we're just praying for all of you. And some of y'all still ain't got it. It's okay. That's homeschool parents for you. I say that's that that's us.
