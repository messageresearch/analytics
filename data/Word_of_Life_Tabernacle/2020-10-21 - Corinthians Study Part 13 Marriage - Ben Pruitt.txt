want the meat of the word the fresh kill of the word lord we're thankful for what you've done for us in this hour to provide fresh meat lord that we can feed on father we thank you that you always keep your word lord and you always will come down and where two or three are gathered together you said you will be in there i will be in their midst and we believe that lord we're trusting that tonight i pray god that you would control every part of the sermon tonight and everything that's heard lord perhaps if i would say something that wouldn't be right hold it from the ears of the people lord god i wouldn't want to do or say anything that would even have the wrong attitude in it lord we we want to lead people to you and not to ourselves i pray god that you would just speak to your people tonight and if there's one sick or a need you see them lord you know them and i pray god that you would just reach out maybe some that are not able to be here tonight and they're sick and maybe discouraged because they haven't been able to be here in a while but god you know about it and i pray god that you'd reach down where they're at tonight and as the word goes forth may they recognize lord that you're their healer i pray you granted now thank you for the promise of revival not in a worldwide way but lord in our own hearts father we thank you for it and we claim it and we believe what you've done for us in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to genesis 2 24. i'm going to be dealing in corinthians again but i just wanted to read this kind of to get us started genesis 2 24. i wanted to i spoke with brother andrew today with andrew glover and he's going to be with us in december still several several weeks away but wednesday december 2nd you put that on your calendar but andrew glover will be here and minister forrest will try to be here for that service uh remember the fall festival coming up on the 31st if there's anything that you want to do to help and those that are helping make sure you get with my wife and and coordinate that and i want to have communion again and i'd like to do that if we're able to on november 8th so that would be the week after we don't want to do it the same weekend as the fall festival but it'd be the second weekend in november it'd be november 8th i'd like to do communion and that day and foot washing if we can on that day so remember that i want to speak tonight on the subject of marriage you know when you preach on this the wrong people always end up convicted but we have to remember that the past is the past and i'm not here to shout at you tonight but to tell you we all make mistakes none of us are perfect but we serve a perfect god and god has a perfect order for marriage and paul deals with that in corinthians and so i must declare the whole counsel of god as a pastor and i believe that god would have that for us as we're going through this series genesis 2 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh i pray the lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this evening as i said none of us are perfect someone had said that if the pope had been married he would soon have discovered he was not infallible i found this today while i was studying on this i actually had that in my notes and i found this this is actually a region 8 news article but it was all around the world today pope francis endorsed same-sex civil unions for the first time as pontiff you know he's saying he's the biker of christ and he endorsed same-sex civil unions i don't even know how to respond to that uh it says the papal thumbs up came midway through a film that the documentary that they made so he did this quite a while back they just showed the documentary the other day and he talked about that and he says this he said homosexual people have the right to be in a family this is on that next side homosexual people have the right to be in a family they are children of god francis said in one of his sit-down interviews for the film you can't kick someone out of a family nor make their life miserable for this what we have to have is a civil union law the way that way they are legally covered and one of the main characters in the documentary is juan carlos cruz and they had hit pope francis had initially discredited him and they'd come back together and cruz who is gay said that during his first meetings with the pope in may 2018 after they patched things up francis assured him that god made cruz gay well i think we can definitively say that that was not the case god doesn't do things like that and that's the head of the world church today where are we at i sent that to a pastor and he responded back 2020. it's just the that's the time we're living in but there's a junction and brother branham tells us about those junctions he said during that time he said you look and see the things going on you realize they have to do what they do they have to do what they do and but we have to do what we do as well we have to follow the word of god and so i don't say these things to be judgmental but we've got to follow the word in every area of our life including marriage we've got to have some standard to go by we have to be able to determine right from wrong and the world can't do that today the pope can't even do it and the standard cannot be private revelations or personal testimonies because if it is then we have no standard because if the standard for marriage is what somebody told you then i have no standard right so it's got to be something the world has to be judged by something brother branham taught us that paul taught us that and if you go back to what he told timothy he told him he said the things that you've heard of me he said commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others but he said the things you've heard of me among many witnesses so not just the things you heard that i said but the things you heard me say publicly and so we've had a prophet in our day say some things publicly and he said this he said but he is going to judge the world and he's got to have some standard to judge the world by or he would be unjust to let us go now and live this life without a standard to be judged by who would be right where could you tell what was right there has to be a standard and he said in his bible and that's we still have that bible today he said in his bible he would judge the world by jesus christ and we read here that jesus is the word and hebrews 13 and 8 said he is the same yesterday today and forever so therefore he will judge the church by their attitude towards christ who is the word their attitude towards christ who is the lord let me give you an example of that when the syrophoenician woman came to jesus and jesus told her who jesus being the word told her something that would have shook most of us i think because he said he told her he said you i won't take the children's bread and give it to dogs and he was the word and he spoke to her and she said truth lord she had the right attitude she said but the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the masters table there's even mercy you might say for the little dogs so thank god for mercy tonight thank god for mercy that when we do things that are stupid we do things that are wrong there's still mercy for us but but we don't change what the word says the word is always right 100 of the time it's never wrong i think we can agree on that tonight so so he said there has to be a standard he would judge the world by their attitude towards christ was the word he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god not out of the mouth of man not out of the seminary not out of the church but out of the mouth of god man must live by that and that alone he said no man's interpretation but god's own word he said well you say there is a mistake here and i love the way brother brown puts this he said if it is god is responsible for it isn't that a good attitude to have about the word he said there's a mistake if it is god is responsible for it he brought it to me see this is what i must take right here's what he said so you can say it's a mistake but it's what god gave me so you're saying god made a mistake and as i said when you talk about these things sometimes the wrong people are convicted but don't let your past affect your ability to agree with agree with the word the word is always right and first john 1 7 said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from how many sin all sin all sin and so even sins when it comes to marriage and divorce now in first corinthians 7 1 which is where we're at in our corinthian series brother branham says now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman that word touch is to take in marriage now this is something that they wrote they had written to him and i want us to keep that in mind tonight it's important brother branham uh shows us the importance of that and we'll get to that later but he is answering questions the corinthians have given him a series of questions and the wording evidently that they use is as they spoke to him said well isn't it better not to touch a woman and so he says yeah it is good for a man not to touch a woman so and so not to take a woman in marriage that would be great but not everybody's called to that in fact very few people are now they'd written him basically in this way to see if it was okay to be unmarried and paul using their own words said yeah that's okay but there's a special calling for that there's basically four classes of people that we think of when it comes to married to marriage and that's the unmarried and the engaged and the married and widows and widowers one whose spouse has died and you're thinking well what about divorced people well if you have a living spouse you you're married to someone and we will get into that a little bit later now the scriptures do not lend credibility to any other relationship and i'll just go ahead and say that for the young people there's no such thing as a in a relationship in the bible right that's on facebook but not on the bible all right that's become a major thing now people watch each other's facebook to see if someone's in a relationship well it doesn't mean anything right and there are no partners no such thing as a partner that's a modern construct my wife's not my partner she's my wife i could be partners with joe but joe can't be my wife right i use him i know he can take it but you can be partners in a business but that's not it's just modern the way people think modern thinking uh you're single if you could put it that way unmarried until you're married right and and then you're married so that but you say well that's stupid but but listen that the culture we live in messes everything up that's the gross darkness for the caleb that we're in as a society said there would be growth darkness upon the people where the people wouldn't even understand what to call marriage so there's no such thing as friends with benefits or open marriages and stuff like that it's it's nonsense it's a perversion of god's original plan so in first corinthians 7 2 paul deals with that he says nevertheless to avoid fornication so he said it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife every woman have her own husband and wesley said this about that scripture he said yet when it is needed in order to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife his own for christianity allows no polygamy and you you think well what a brother random state marriage and divorce we'll get to that brother braham said this in the 70th week of daniel he said in the nations where they have polygamy it's a thousand times better he was saying it's a thousand times better than divorce and remarriage for no reason right that's that's the age we live in just marriage and divorce for no reason and he's saying it's a thousand times better he said yet polygamy is wrong we know but it just shows how degraded we are and and so he uses that and and we'll get into that maybe a little bit more as i said it would be better than our system of divorce and remarriage for any reason but that doesn't make it right because polygamy wasn't so from the beginning go find out what brother branham said about it divorce and polygamy puts the two together it wasn't so from the beginning and after the new covenant came into force there's no talk of polygamy in the new testament because there's a new covenant and i'll say this because i know it's been a problem here in other places in the message not here necessarily in this church but just just in the area and even where i'm from and if you need polygamy to justify sinful behavior you need to be born again you need to come into a new covenant now verse three are we all right so far i feel like i'm walking on the water but you've got to have faith to walk on the water fall but verse 3 says let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife and to the husband i love what adam clark says about this he said what miserable work has been made in the peace of families by a wife or a husband pretending to be wiser than the apostle too holy and spiritual to keep the commandments of god due benevolence that that word is interesting paul uses a great word because he doesn't degrade it to a word that the greeks or the romans would have used but he calls it due benevolence or a duty of kindness a duty of kindness husbands and wives have a duty of kindness to one another verse four the wife is not power of her own body but the husband likewise also the husband that's not power of his own body but the wife and i'm trying to be careful as i'm saying these things but you understand those of you that are adult you'll understand to use the physical needs of your spouse as a bargaining chip in marriage is wrong we don't buy or sell intimacy in marriage physical relations within the marriage are not contractual not if you do this i'll do this that's not how that works that's why he said in verse five defraud you not one the other except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting in prayer and come together again that satan tempts you not for your incontinence now again these verses are easily abused because i've known men that would abuse this and use this scripture as a hammer to demand what is due and if you do that you have bigger problems because you're one and so there has to be some agreement even in matters in the home now but in verse six paul says but i speak this by permission and not of commandment permission it would be indulgence it's the same thing that brother brown talked about when he allowed uh when he was allowed to say stay as you are and we'll get to that but paul was honest that there was no old testament scripture for it but it's something come by revelation to him and so he said i speak this by permission not of commandment and paul was dealing with real people and the thing about marriage is you can't be a legalist when it comes to marriages because everybody's everybody's different and there's always two sides to every story but there is but the word is still true right and we have to abide by it and and so i asked you know you say well i've been in a bad situation well don't quit coming to church serve god do the best you can to serve god we've been given grace in this hour to do that but don't make a bad situation worse and don't do it again right and so we're taught to do that now uh so paul says this he said i would that all men verse 7 were even as i myself being unmarried he said but every man hath this proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that so paul said i'm not going to try to make everybody like me and in first corinthians 7 8 he said i say therefore to the unmarried and widows that is good for them if they abide even as i in other words don't don't put yourself under pressure to be married right it's because it's better not to be if you can do it but very few people can right and that's what paul's saying he was content in the state where he's in where he was now brother branham talked about this he said a young man asked me the other day he said you think i ought to get married brother branham to such and such a girl and i said how much do you think of her he said oh my i just love her i said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not don't go putting away your wife because you think you can live without her either but because scripture said god hateth putting away that literally god hates divorce right now um so he said but if you live without her you better not he said but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married and so what i was trying to get to him this he said that if you love her so much he said now right now before you're married everything's just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toils and trials of life come in and i think all the married people can say amen to that i heard brother adam back there i know i won't say that i'm going to say sister becky is a saint but we'll just leave that there now he said after you get married then the toils and trials of life come in and all of us i think could testify that it's hard enough even if you do it right and then if you add the baggage of of double marriage and things like that it makes it harder it really does and i wish i could lift that from people because because you see them and you know these people are christians and they live for god and all their lives and it's such a wonderful thing that they've been saved they've been cleansed they're put away in the mind of god but yet it comes to their mind and you watch people deal with that for years and years and years you think and they know that they're saved but still i wish i wouldn't have done that but that's where brother brown said teach your children the truth you don't count it's what you did but say god god gave me grace and even not just grace to be saved but to have my family and to live together as husband and wife but don't do that thing again he said now so we have to preach the truth he said but that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another i want you to watch that that's important you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another it's important paul tells men especially dwell with them according to or peter does dwell with them according to wisdom dwell with them according to wisdom acknowledging that they're the weaker vessel and so you have to work to understand your wife right i'm still working on that most of you've been married a lot longer than i had but david i can't remember how many years you said 37 or something like that and after that many years you're still working on it we got some been married maybe more than 50 years here tonight and they're still working on it but you work to understand one another he said when you're disappointed in one another you still understand one another we'll get to that a little bit later he talks about that again in 1st corinthians 7 9 says but if they cannot contain let them marry it is better to marry than to burn and brother branham answers a question about this and i want to tell you what brother branham said about these scriptures because that's the best commentator we could we could have in this day through the opening of the word and brother brown directly addresses some of these scriptures in first corinthians seven and we won't go through all the way through the whole chapter tonight so don't worry about that he said but if they cannot contain let them married it's better to marry than to burn he said all right he said that's for just dirty living instead of a man a boy girl or something or another when they're going to get together and they know that they should get married he said go ahead and get married he said i think you'd understand what i mean don't you he said don't live just a dirty little life there because it's not right he said that's your sister in one sense where if you're a christian he said now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that will be the mother of your children that will come don't live a dirty little life around her show that you're a real christian gentleman live like a christian gentleman ought to treat her like your sister when you get married still treat her that way not the sister that you kicked around at home your sister in christ treat her like your sister he said i might answer this right now and i'm i'm so glad that brother branham continues this it's one of the things that's been a blessing to me over the years you think how could this be a blessing to you people get taught wrong and i'm glad i had the message of the hour to look into and to find these things because sometimes in churches and i try to look at it this way what would i want to be taught if i was a a believer a new believer coming up and and i was not long ago what would i want to be taught from the word of god that i could apply to my life and this is one of those things brother brandon says i might answer this right now i don't believe in filthy living amongst pentecostal people holiness people even if they're married he said i don't believe in that no sir some of this dirty stuff that's so horrible he said he said i get in here sometimes on these he said not this morning he said but i mean on times i'm out in california and different places like that i mean ministers out there were on the discernment i feel like i could turn them over my knee and give them a little gospel protoplasmic stimulation he said yes sir am i to see a man that will try to take his little wife and dirty filthy he said you understand what i mean he said i think you ought to be ashamed of yourself as a man of god he said you just be a husband be a sweetheart respect her like you always respect her he said don't pay any attention to some of these sexy books or these nonsense and this sexy books and things that you read about all this stuff and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind and we could say add internet to that today don't go by what you read or what you see on the internet you'll have a warped idea of marriage and you'll work the rest of your life trying to get that out of your head so now he said he said the bible said let not one dirty conversation come among you when you profess holiness treat that little lady like she's your little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you just be the same you'd be that gallant boyfriend i wonder if any of you been married over 50 years could be that gallant boyfriend still i've seen that i i've watched some of you i know that you still do that and and i i know i've watched probably know by the jt as well as i do any of you and i've watched them lately brother jt doing certain things to make it easier for her and she's doing certain things make it easier for him and and that's good there's a gallantry to that because you passed that that you know that maybe years ago you passed the the heat of the physical side but now you're coming to a place where you got to be a boyfriend again huh you know you understand it you got to be a gallant boyfriend and if you're that the other part will come with it now he said you don't especially when you're young and because why is women excuse me tonight but women are made to respond that's what they do that's what women do and so a lot of times a woman can be bad but you take a man that's really strong in faith and lives for god there's some things there that a man can really influence his home in a way that no one else can it's harder for a woman because she can't be the head of the house right but a man can be the head of his house and should be and he and the woman responds to that now and so he says you don't try he said none of these new things he said i know what i'm talking about i said you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine christian he said i know that sounds but you're my kids i got a right to say what i want to you say amen brother branham said you see you're my kids you live right he said you women live the right way to your husband your husband live the right way to your wives be real nice he said and respect one another your family relations and so forth like that let it be just reverently and godly and greed with among you in everything as it can be he said don't never push and shove and be dirty and vulgar so i want you to take notice of that under like that agreed with among you as much as it can be try to agree and so many times in marriage we look for disagreements we get up itching for a fight right and so the first thing that's not right we we disagree but try to come to an agreement understand one another and so brother brown says understand he said talk to your wife now that ought to be part of marriage shouldn't it that's hard to do isn't it some of you men talk to your wife it's hard for me sometimes and i'm rather what's the word locatious i don't know if i'm pronouncing that correctly i i like to to talk i can't believe that's the first word that came to mind i like to talk but it's hard sometimes to talk to your wife sometimes your wife can be the hardest person now you all are angels but i'm not sometimes your wife can be the hardest person to talk to but brother brandon said talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her you try to do the same thing to him sister in the same way understand one another understand one another real christian gentlemen a real christian ladies and brother and sister with one another always remember your god's children you're from a royal family you're a royal blood there's no better blood in the world than yours thank the lord he said and that's right a royal blood shows itself he said that's what it is it's royal oh believe that say amen he said yes sir shows what you are i'm a son of the king i'm the son of the king my wife's the daughter of the king how would i treat that king's daughter how would she treat that king's son see what i mean be real genuine if you can't open up with her who are you going to open up to if you can't be vulnerable to your wife where can you be vulnerable where are you ever going to talk about that if you can't do that to your wife now paul goes on in 1st corinthians 7 10. he said unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband now here he wants them to understand that this is the word of god god hates divorce let not the wife depart from her husband but we also live in a real world he says but and if she depart if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband let not the husband put away his wife huh that kind of goes on both sides don't it christians keep their word what did i say when i married my wife for better or worse and richer and poorer sickness and then health what i made a promise and i realized that that promise is depending on someone else you're making a promise that's depending on them in a lot of ways i'm so glad we make a promise to god he's already kept his part of the bargain she happy for that he'll never let you down but sometimes we get let down in life but but you make a promise your promise is still there he made a vow and so he says if she depart let her remain unmarried or if he reconciled her husband let not the husband put away his wife he said but to the rest speak i this verse 12 not the lord if any brother has a wife or this by permission again what he's saying if any brother hath the wife that believeth not she'd be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and these are special situations he's dealing with don't be divorced simply because he or she is an unbeliever do everything you can to stay together work to stay together everything that you can do that's why i would never counsel someone to leave somebody unless there's a situation where they'd be in danger you understand i never counsel that and but yet sometimes it happens but if she does he said the wife should remain unmarried now verse 14 for the unbelieving i think we didn't read verse 13 the woman would have the husband that believeth not if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy a person in this situation can still raise god-fearing children a great example of that is timothy in the bible paul says i recognize the faith in use the same as what was in your mother and your grandmother and his father was a greek didn't serve the lord but his mother did serve the lord and raised a child timothy who could preach the gospel so first corinthians 7 15 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart he says a brother and sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace god hath called us to peace don't force them to stay now i want to deal with this because this is where the doctrine of innocent party remarriage comes from i don't know if you've heard it put that way but among denominational circles it's called innocent party remarriage and it's a doctrine that whoever the innocent party is can get remarried the problem with that is who have you ever talked to that was divorced that wasn't the innocent party right i mean everybody's going to say they were in some way the problem as well with it is brother branham didn't teach that and paul doesn't teach it he doesn't give permission to remarry he doesn't say that he says a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases bondage to what to remain together he doesn't say anything about remarriage now in questions and answers 1962 brother branham deals directly with that he said first corinthians 7 chapter 15 verse he said now the question they asked brother branham does this mean a sister or brother is free to remarry he said no he said see you don't get his question there and what he's saying now and brother branham he presents this like a theologian you go and look back at the commentator and stuff i know he wasn't educated but brother branham knew what he was talking about because he talks about he said see you don't get his question there and what he's saying he said they're not free he said that would make a contradiction in the scripture and the scriptures don't contradict themselves at all he said now let's see he said like you can make the scripture just by reading one verse say anything you want it to say to fit your thought he said but you've got to take the thought that they're talking on i'm going to skip through this a little bit but you can go back and read the whole thing questions and answers 1962. he said see paul is writing them people saying you ask such and such a thing only he isn't just saying you ask it he's just saying that he said then there he turns around and answers them back which is contrary to what they ask he said they ask we do so and so and so and paul turns around and says something else see it looks like it's a contradiction it's not he said if you'll just read the whole verse the whole chapter you'd find out he's trying to explain what they've wrote him he said now watch his subject see and you read on down in before this on down through the chapter you find that they thought if we married a wife and i got married and i become a believer my wife wasn't a believer let me put her away oh no that isn't it you can't do that he said a brother or sister is not under bondage and and this is a skipped a paragraph he said a brother sister's not under bondage in such case that is if your companion is putting you away and wants to depart for it you don't have to just hold on to them if they're wanting to leave you and they're going to leave you for the cause of christ let them leave but you can't remarry but god has called us to peace see and and so you seek peace in a marriage you seek peace in your home god has called us to peace even if you stay together right seek peace in your home now he said see now that that you can not that you can remarry again he's already stated that but you don't have to live with an unbelieving husband or unbelieving wife if they are not willing and on down he says but now just say i brother branham i got married my wife's an unbeliever and here's a sister over here i can marry he said i'm going to leave this one and marry that one oh no no indeed your vows until death you separate there's nothing else in the world will permit you to marry in the bible until your companion is dead he said that's right there are only grounds there's no remarrying nowhere at all except a dead companion that's all he goes on down he said there's no such thing as any believer ever being reconciled to remarriage again with a living companion are you still with me now people ask what about marriage and divorce i want to read from marriage and divorce i'm going to read several paragraphs but and i apologize for reading so much but it's just we have to know what a prophet taught and i know that you know these things but we need to be reminded of these things we have to be able to accept the word as true just as basically being true and then we work from there we can't come and say well i don't think that means what it says well then what we have no grounds to work on we have no common ground to work on if you if you don't acknowledge that the bible and the scriptures are true then how do you have any uh any place for uh to to work for the mercy of god and to to ask for the mercy of god and so now in marriage and divorce brother brown says friends then i'm closing he said you can go from this so that perks your ears up doesn't it here's what you can go from brother brown just got done with a long sermon where he talked about different things and the polygamy law and all those things that were there he said you can go from this that's when this was being revealed to me said what i'm going to tell you right now so don't miss it he said no i'm speaking to our followers only who is following me and this message only not the outside every record of this before god just to this group only i believe i'm part of that group where are we at without a messenger right we we don't can't even start we just go join the baptist church or the methodist or the pentecost or whatever would fit our our view of the word but we have a messenger in our day and so we have to say what he said now this is uh brother branham says this he says to this group only now we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology then if we get ourselves in a mess again wouldn't it be because of misinterpreted theology right and not that there wouldn't be mercy but but if we get ourselves in a mess again it's misinterpreted theology he said now he said is that right that's why you women married the second time and you men because misinterpreted theology he said now i want to show you something that he told me he said and if god our creator was questioned the question when he was here on our jesus christ when his delivering prophet came forth moses down in egypt to bring the children out of egypt to put them in the promised land jesus said here that moses seen the people in this condition he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was moses found such as let him suffer god permitted moses the prophet sent to the people to grant this writing of divorcement and that's not what brother branham did but he's saying that god allowed the prophet to make a special accommodation because of the hardness of their heart because of the condition of the age right that's what god did he allowed him to make that accommodation because of of the age and if you go back and study that jesus said because of the hardness of your hearts well what was the gospel supposed to do to take out that hard heart to give us a heart of flesh so what we're going back to and the point of all this is we we don't believe in divorce no not as christians so we we serve god if and so as christians if and paul goes on into it to talk about it but if you're married don't seek to be loosed if you're single don't don't seek to be married god will provide you a wife if you need one but let it be him that does it and he will not lead you outside of the word he just can't do it the holy ghost may permit you to do something outside the word but it'll end up like balaam right because because you keep asking he may let you do it but it won't ever be right but but again we make mistakes we're not perfect but god is aren't you glad you serve a perfect god who is the word now he said god permitted moses to grant this writing of divorcement to them in first corinthians the seventh chapter the 12th and 15th verse the new testament prophet paul who met the same thing in the church and spoke this this is i not the lord right because of the divorce conditions he said it wasn't so from the beginning but moses was permitted it and god recognized it righteousness paul also had a right when he found his church in that condition he said no you believe this to be true and believe it to come from god he said and by the vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should not god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more you never said something about go and do it again you got permission now just go get married as many times as you want to start putting away your wife when god says god hates putting away what he said go on as you are that's grace that's grace because of modern conditions the world's messed up but aren't you glad for grace so think about the grace of it it's not a condemnation i know people that won't listen to marriage and divorce won't read it because they feel condemnation over it but that's not what it is at all it's grace god allowed them to go ahead and as they are let them go on as they are in sin no more he said now go with your wives and live in peace for the hours late the coming of the lord is at hand he said we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again he said i'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married god bore me witness of that on the mountain that i could say this a supernatural revelation because of the opening of the seven seals and this is a question in god's word let them go on in as they are and sin no more and then he said it wasn't so from the beginning what was the beginning one man and one woman in a lifetime contract and really adam and eve was an eternal contract because death hadn't even entered in yet so there's your eternal mate and glory now look he said and people have a question about that you know i've had people come even in a church that i pastored and and say well you may not be meant for him and he may not be meant for her but you'll find out one day you know who you're meant to be married to if you're married the person you're married to all right just get that out of your head right now well if i went for that first girl that i liked you know i'd have been better off no get that out of your head because your eternal mate is the one that god gave you and has given you grace to live with all these years aren't you it takes grace to be married amen now he said go with your wives and live in peace and but he said it wasn't so from the beginning that's right he said it wasn't so he said and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions as god's servant he said i won't call myself as prophet but i believe maybe if i wouldn't be sent for that i'm laying a ground for him when he does come he said so under the modern conditions i command you to go to your home with your wife now he said if you're happy with her live with her raise your children on the admonition of god but god be merciful to you if you ever do that again now what's he saying acknowledge that the word is true i i if i do wrong it doesn't mean that the word's not true right if i'd tell a lie god forbid that i would but if i would tell a lie i don't go in the bible and try to justify lying right but i would acknowledge the word is true and repent right and that's what we have to do the word of god is is what we have to have we've been talking about revival and what we needed to to see revival come we have to go back to the word if there's going to be revival there's got to be us coming back to terms with the word an absolute surrender to the word like a branch surrenders to the vine it's absolute it's completely the branch is completely dependent on the vine the vine does all the work it it grits all the nutrients and all the soil in the branches it's there and produces fruit but everything it has in it is pushed through it from the vine it's completely dependent that's the way we have to be on the word of god he said i am the vine you are the branches then what are we we're dependent on that word to live if i want to have a marriage that makes it in laodicea i've got to be so dependent on the word that my marriage i can look into the word to find out how i should treat my wife and what we should do as a couple see these things really matter where we live we've got to go back to the word acknowledge the word is right i wish i could change it for people i wish i could i've had people tell me i'm an exception to the rule i wish i could fix that for you wish i could make it so that you are but i can't god knows that a preacher would have to be out of his mind to come into a church and and just preach things to run people off on purpose that's not my purpose i don't want to do that but we've got to get back to the word we can't do things that the word of god does not allow and expect god to bless us we just can't do it we have to come back to the word and that's all i can say as a pastor you you can do as you wish as adults as american citizens but for me as joshua said choose you this day whom you will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the lord i wonder if you say amen to that tonight i'm going to serve the lord in my marriage now he said you teach your children to never do a thing like that he said bring them up in the admonition of god and now that you are as you are let us go now at the late evening hour that we're living in press towards the mark of the high calling in christ where all things will be possible listen to this this is the last verse i'll read first corinthians 7 16 for what noah's thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou a man whether thou shalt save thy wife what if you would be the instrument of salvation that god uses for someone who isn't exactly what they should be but god somehow you are allowed to be married for some reason for some reason and they're just not what they should be but but you might be the thing that god uses he said well how could that be what could i say well it's not what you say but it's just it's you it's how you live it's every day it's you see he said how how knowest or wife whether there shall save thy husband or how noah said oh man whether thou shalt save thy wife what if god put you in your marriage for that reason and allowed you to be there i think all of us could say this we would not be what we are today if you're a married person today you've been married for a while you would not be what you are today unless you had married that person right not unless you'd been married but you would be a different person in some way if you had not married that person maybe even if your husband or wife has passed on you could still say that i'm different today because i married that person all those years ago what did it what was it it was something about god puts you together because he he or he allowed you to come together even if it wasn't perfect but he allowed things to happen where you could be what you are today we don't understand all of that but he said all things work together for the good all that ought to give us confidence today all things work together for the good so next time you get really really mad at your wife or husband don't tell me it never happens next time you get really upset put that scripture in your mind all things maybe god put you in her life maybe god put brother joe and says joanna's life just to make her mad enough to get up for a sickness it's a private joke but you know god will do that god wants somebody that people he allowed moses to be married to a woman that would speak up huh he said well they shouldn't have been married they were not fit for each other when she was yelling and screaming at him in the tent they just wasn't a good fit for the prophet that's exactly who he needed to be brother brown said god put them together because he knew exactly what moses needed are you glad for the grace of god see i'm closing with this musicians go ahead and come we don't get married to be happy we get married to make someone else happy you love someone so much that you want that person to be happy brother brown said even if you loved them right you knew they'd be happier with someone else you let them marry someone else that's hard to take isn't it we don't get married to be happy we get married to make someone else happy let me leave you with this i don't usually close the service this way but i want to close with a challenge for those of you who are married next wednesday we'll talk about the rest of this chapter and then i don't think paul deals with marriage again really in first corinthians but i want you to this week those of you here in the church and you can do it or not do it i'm not going to make you do it but i want to challenge you to do this do something that you don't normally do that you know will make your spouse happy that's going to be hard for some of you because you just make each other happy all the time but i've already thought of a few things for myself do something this week that you don't normally do that you know will please your spouse because paul talks about in the in the part that we're going to read next he talks about how that the married man looks how to please his wife the married woman looks how to please her husband find something that you know will make your wife happy if you want ideas i've got ideas maybe just take out the garbage pick up your clothes have dinner ready maybe for a wife when he gets home or for the husband for that matter if it works out that way bring home flowers do the dishes stay off facebook there might be something you could do maybe don't go hunting i can say that because i don't want so something that the only purpose of it is to make them happy expect nothing in return then i don't want you to necessarily tell me about it although you're welcome to but ponder the results think about what life would be like if we treated each other like this all the time do something say well that person they i just can't make them happy try make an attempt i believe it'll make a difference let's bow our heads heavily father sometimes our services are different and we want them to all be the same but lord we know that you called us at different times to hear different things tonight you want us to hear about marriage i believe that lord i'm a poor subject to speak it but lord you brought a message in our day and that messenger said what paul said i'm so grateful for that lord i pray you would help us in our marriages father i think sometimes we don't realize how close that we could be to messing up and maybe even if we've been married a long time we don't realize that we're fallible [Music] we're not a pope we're not a law to ourselves we don't get to make up the god rules showed us in the word if we do certain things we'd be happy i pray you'd help us to do those things lord prophet come in our day and just give us some very simple things that we could do how we can treat one another and try to understand one another try to make one another happy pay the debt of kindness as paul puts in lord me may we do something lord and and to help our marriages lord maybe there's someone here tonight and and they not married and maybe a spouse has passed away or are gone and in some way and they they felt a little bit left out i pray god you'd help them to understand that you are their husband or you are their spouse you're the one who can fill the void lord that's there lord i i pray that we would think about it spiritually as well lord we don't want to just please a husband or a wife we want to please you lord all that we say and do and everything lord that i do as a pastor in everything that these people do lord of sheep or may they be completely willing to please you lord to expect nothing in return but what would make you happy what would make you smile that's what i want to do lord like the woman that washed your feet lord when everything seemed like it was the pharisees brought you there to mock you the lord she washed your feet because she saw a need it made you happy made you smile we're so thankful lord that we're still able to do that today i worship lord by acknowledging you in our lives every day i pray you'd grant it father and help us when we come together again to be that much closer to you because we're that much closer to one another i pray you grant it lord we ask it in jesus name amen amen let's sing this together [Music] stand with me and sing it tonight [Music] don't you just worship him a moment we've heard the word now it's time to worship a perfect dress [Music] is [Music] is have heard the message alone and all is well for there is a place of perfect rest behind the interview sorry
