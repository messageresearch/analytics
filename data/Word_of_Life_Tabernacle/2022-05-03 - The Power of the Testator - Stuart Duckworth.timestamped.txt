[1:15] how much more shall the blood of christ
[1:19] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:21] himself
[1:22] without spot to god
[1:24] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:26] serve the living god
[1:28] amen and for this cause he is the
[1:31] mediator of the new testament
[1:34] that by means of death about for the
[1:36] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:38] were under the first testament they
[1:40] which are called might receive the
[1:42] promise of eternal inheritance
[1:45] for where a testament is there must also
[1:47] of necessity be the death of the
[1:50] testator
[1:51] for the testament is of force after men
[1:54] are dead otherwise it is of no strength

[3:08] think or ask yes amen and it's those
[3:11] things that are
[3:12] lasting and eternal value i think we
[3:15] should seek before all else
[3:17] amen jesus said seek ye therefore the
[3:19] kingdom of god
[3:21] amen and his righteousness
[3:23] and all these things will be added amen
[3:24] he said take no thought for tomorrow
[3:28] amen your father knows what you had in
[3:29] need of it you believe he knows what you
[3:31] have need of here tonight amen before we
[3:34] could even ask he already knows
[3:37] amen amen and if we put him first if
[3:39] we'll just let him be lord if we'll let
[3:41] him just be god tonight he'll come down

[3:46] my needs he'll meet your needs amen i
[3:48] believe that he's rich in many things
[3:50] amen he he has cattle on a thousand
[3:53] hills
[3:54] and man whatever you whatever you would
[3:56] need of he's able to provide that but
[3:58] i'm thankful tonight amen of something
[4:01] of value that he's a god rich in mercy
[4:04] amen i believe that tonight
[4:06] amen
[4:08] as we reference our scripture here
[4:11] amen
[4:13] amen there's a testator
[4:15] amen there's a testament there there's
[4:16] been a will
[4:18] right
[4:18] amen and jesus tonight he is the
[4:21] mediator of the will the inheritance of
[4:24] the saints
[4:25] and by the death of the testator the
[4:27] infor the enforcement i want to say
[4:29] tonight of the will is in full effect
[4:33] amen and to understand a will
[4:36] or for it to have any significance your
[4:38] name has to be in that will yes right
[4:41] right your name has to be called you you
[4:44] have to receive a copy of that will of
[4:47] that testament
[4:48] i mean you have to be identified in the
[4:50] will for it to have any meaning to you
[4:52] yes i mean and to be identified in that
[4:55] inheritance you must have a connection
[4:58] with the testator the one that's leaving
[5:00] behind the inheritance the one who made
[5:02] the will yes amen but i want to say
[5:05] tonight that there's one who would try
[5:07] to bring an objection to the will and
[5:09] that is the accuser of the brethren
[5:11] amen he would try to make you confused
[5:15] amen in order to think that this
[5:16] inheritance this blessing is not for you
[5:19] amen but the bible says that we overcome
[5:21] him amen by the blood of the lamb and by
[5:24] the word of our testimony amen our names
[5:27] have been identified in the will they've
[5:29] been identified in the book amen our
[5:31] names are written there before the
[5:33] foundation of the world amen before
[5:35] satan amen can bring any accusation
[5:38] god had already wrote it out in heaven
[5:40] he had already declared that you would
[5:42] partake in this inheritance that you
[5:44] will partake in this testament yes sir
[5:47] yes
[5:48] yes sir
[5:49] amen
[5:50] amen so i want to i want to say tonight
[5:52] i want to think tonight you know what a
[5:54] powerful blood we have yes amen that
[5:57] when there would come an objection
[5:59] when there would come an accusation and
[6:02] when we've got a blood amen we've got a
[6:04] blood there a power there amen amen
[6:08] we've got a testimony on our lips and
[6:10] then we've got the truth of god and when
[6:12] the power of god the life of god amen
[6:15] there to defeat the enemy to overcome
[6:17] him
[6:19] and then we look at the old testament
[6:21] sacrifice
[6:23] amen and just referencing our first
[6:25] scripture there
[6:26] every year how that blood would perfect
[6:29] them how they would bring a cleansing
[6:32] yes amen in god's eyes that was
[6:34] righteous and every year the individual
[6:36] would bring a lamb it had to be a
[6:38] spotless lamb the very best lamb they
[6:40] they would bring the very best that they
[6:42] had and the priest would bring that
[6:44] sacrifice before the mercy seat into
[6:47] that shekinah presence and there god
[6:49] would accept that because because that's
[6:51] what god required
[6:52] amen and the believer could go away
[6:54] clean could go away righteous before god
[6:57] amen and there was a sanctification
[7:00] there aiming then god for a time was
[7:02] pleased with that and when the worshiper
[7:04] amen he he could leave there he could
[7:06] leave there and know that that he he
[7:08] done what god required but yet he would
[7:10] leave there with the same desire that he
[7:12] came with yes sir there would be no
[7:15] change i mean because the nate nature of
[7:17] that animal could never come back upon
[7:19] that human
[7:21] even in hebrews it says but the law was
[7:23] a shadow of good things to come amen
[7:26] that sacrifice could never make never
[7:28] make that person perfect
[7:31] but we read here in john 1 and 17
[7:34] for the law was given by moses but grace
[7:37] and truth about jesus christ amen amen
[7:40] brother graham said god by the prophets
[7:42] god by the prophets under that law they
[7:45] condemned us to sin
[7:46] and the law had no grace it had no
[7:49] delivering power i mean it was only what
[7:51] god required for a little bit i mean it
[7:54] just tells you that your center it don't
[7:56] make no way out but brother brown says
[7:58] hearing the master in peace he says but
[8:00] when jesus came on the scene he was a
[8:03] fulfillment he was a fulfillment of
[8:05] everything that god had promised he was
[8:07] the perfect identical image of the
[8:10] promise therefore all promises of the
[8:12] old testament was met in jesus christ
[8:15] amen amen we were condemned amen but he
[8:18] came in truth and grace
[8:20] amen he came
[8:21] i don't know what happened to my volume
[8:23] i guess i
[8:24] maybe i stepped over there and it
[8:25] sounded a little different
[8:28] amen but jesus came
[8:30] and man he fulfilled the law
[8:32] amen amen amen and he made a way for you
[8:35] and i mean he came in truth and grace
[8:37] and so our jesus is that that perfect
[8:39] son of god amen that god required a near
[8:42] kinsman amen to be able to redeem that
[8:44] which was lost god required in his law
[8:47] amen that there would be a kinsmen amen
[8:50] and not only that not only to redeem
[8:52] amen but but to be able to bring a
[8:54] change amen amen to be able to bring an
[8:56] atonement
[8:57] god required a blood and to bring an
[8:59] atonement for sin amen and i want to say
[9:01] it tonight tonight in him was
[9:03] fulfillment in him was all the
[9:05] fulfillment of that old testament he
[9:07] fulfilled that to the letter he feel
[9:09] that fulfilled everything that was said
[9:11] about him do you believe that tonight in
[9:13] him was fulfillment amen and in him
[9:15] tonight is your fulfillment
[9:18] amen he is in everything within him he's
[9:21] the truth and grace amen they could set
[9:23] us free they could bring a change amen
[9:25] well we could go away tonight amen not
[9:27] the same the same way we were amen but
[9:30] we could go away and then when we come
[9:31] in this presence we could go away change
[9:34] we could go away different yes
[9:37] yes
[9:38] because we're not under the law he
[9:39] fulfilled that yes amen we're under
[9:42] truth and grace now by jesus christ
[9:50] oh what a blood it is
[9:52] oh what a blood he brought
[9:56] brother ram says hear the blood of jesus
[9:58] christ thinking of it the dripping
[10:00] bloody word amen the blood the the word
[10:03] of god bleeding
[10:04] blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir
[10:06] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[10:09] she never sinned in the first place amen
[10:11] a law could never do that
[10:14] amen somebody beating you over the head
[10:16] with with with what they think or some
[10:18] rule or regulation it could never do
[10:20] that amen but when he came but when he
[10:23] came with grace and truth i mean that
[10:26] brought us to a justification it brought
[10:28] us to a to a place of virtue yes amen a
[10:32] place to where where we could be
[10:34] unadulterated amen when we were the pure
[10:36] virgin word bride of jesus christ amen
[10:39] amen no man's idea no man beating you
[10:42] over the head would ever produce that
[10:44] only him coming down in grace and truth
[10:46] will bring you to that
[10:49] so we stand justified amen by the
[10:52] bleeding word
[10:54] amen it's a word that's got life in it
[10:57] amen amen the law can never deliver you
[10:59] amen some idea could never deliver you
[11:02] amen but it's a bleeding word tonight
[11:04] amen it's got life in it
[11:06] amen it'll change you it'll make you
[11:08] what you ought to be
[11:10] amen amen we stand redeemed by the blood
[11:12] of the lamb amen that's what he done for
[11:14] us amen buys by the life by his truth by
[11:17] his grace he's able to make you free
[11:20] amen that he he the perfect son of god
[11:23] could come down amen amen and in himself
[11:26] amen offer himself amen without spot
[11:30] offer himself and give himself for a
[11:33] sacrifice and accepting that and
[11:35] providing that he gained himself a
[11:37] church without spot he gave himself a
[11:40] church that was washed there's been
[11:42] clings that's been purged amen by his
[11:44] bleeding word that's what his objective
[11:46] was yes
[11:49] amen
[11:50] that was his objective he he he
[11:53] purchased you and i yes with his own
[11:55] blood
[11:57] amen we we are in his inheritance
[12:00] amen
[12:02] we've been washed purged clean made
[12:04] whole
[12:04] amen and coming to a perfection in him
[12:07] by the blood
[12:09] amen the blood makes you perfect yes and
[12:12] and there is a perfect groom if there is
[12:14] a perfect groom if there was if there
[12:16] was one that could fulfill every bit of
[12:18] the old testament coming that perfection
[12:21] coming in
[12:22] in what was said of him to be amen amen
[12:25] if there's a if there's a perfect groom
[12:26] there's got to be a perfect bride that's
[12:29] right
[12:31] amen matthew 5 and 48
[12:34] jesus said be there for perfect even as
[12:37] your father in heaven is perfect
[12:39] amen so if he if if we're required to be
[12:42] perfect he's got a way got to make a way
[12:44] for us to be perfect right
[12:46] he can't just say something and and just
[12:48] expect for us to try to figure it out on
[12:50] our own or you know try to come up with
[12:52] some idea or
[12:53] or just try to try to take on some some
[12:56] religion and try to do our best but he's
[12:58] got to make a way he's got to make a way
[13:00] amen and when he comes in grace and
[13:02] truth amen by his bleeding word and then
[13:04] he makes a way
[13:08] brother branham says here he said how
[13:09] could you ever be perfect but in the
[13:11] side of a side of christ tonight every
[13:13] born-again christian is perfect i'm just
[13:16] as perfect in god as christ was you are
[13:19] too every every other believer for it's
[13:21] not my holiness it's his holiness god
[13:24] can't accept mine i have none but i come
[13:26] in christ by faith
[13:28] and by christ i'm in him and perfect in
[13:31] the sight of god
[13:34] so
[13:36] so it's possible
[13:38] it's possible for us to come to that
[13:41] amen i think that
[13:43] that we we get too down on ourselves
[13:45] sometimes
[13:48] we get two down on ourselves
[13:50] but if we'll look at ourselves through
[13:52] christ
[13:54] what god has in store for you and i yeah
[13:57] we can achieve that
[13:59] if we look at ourselves as unworthy
[14:02] if we listen to the accusations and the
[14:04] objections of the accuser we will never
[14:07] overcome we will never rise under the
[14:10] inheritance the eternal inheritance that
[14:12] god has got for us that he's laid out
[14:14] for us but god buys blood
[14:18] yes
[14:18] and i want to talk about the perfection
[14:21] that he performs in you but there's also
[14:23] perfection of maturing that takes place
[14:25] after that perfection comes
[14:29] in yes
[14:29] in the sight of god we stand perfect
[14:31] tonight
[14:32] if you're in christ you stand completely
[14:35] god sees you just as he sees jesus
[14:37] christ because he's looking at you
[14:39] through that blood through that perfect
[14:41] sacrifice that's how god sees you but
[14:43] there's got to come a maturity yes
[14:46] there's got to come a perfecting of the
[14:48] saints as it says in ephesians 4 amen
[14:51] then that's what the work of the
[14:52] ministry is for to bring bring a
[14:54] perfection and not beat it over your
[14:56] head not to try to usurp authority over
[15:00] over the the purchased possession of god
[15:02] over the people of god amen but to bring
[15:05] amen the word before the people
[15:07] amen to bring the promise of god before
[15:09] the people to bring to bring out what in
[15:12] the world your potentials can be
[15:14] to what my potentials can be and what
[15:16] god said you can be and that you can
[15:18] that you can have the right kind of
[15:20] attitude going forth that you're already
[15:24] perfect the work the work of
[15:27] justification sanctification
[15:30] the indwelling of the holy ghost and the
[15:32] ceiling the ceiling of the holy ghost
[15:34] sir you're perfect yes
[15:37] you're perfect you can you can walk in
[15:39] this life god can never take that back
[15:42] and i was talking to my daughter about
[15:43] baptism
[15:45] talking to her about the holy ghost
[15:47] and i tried to explain to her that the
[15:48] holy ghost was like god wrapping his
[15:50] arms around us
[15:52] and saying that satan this is my
[15:55] property
[15:56] and you you don't have any right or any
[15:58] access to this
[16:00] right
[16:03] and we've got to come to that
[16:05] and that is a perfection yes god sees
[16:07] you just as he sees christ
[16:10] but if you stay if we just stay in that
[16:12] mindset
[16:14] if we just just stay right there and
[16:17] you'll make it
[16:18] you'll make it but there's a perfection
[16:20] that's got to come there's a there's a
[16:22] maturing in the word there's something
[16:24] that god wants to bring us to
[16:26] you understand what i'm saying
[16:30] brother peter we
[16:32] let me get you back up here and preach
[16:33] buddy
[16:37] i appreciate our young people
[16:39] amen
[16:41] i remember having to get up and
[16:42] give testimonies like that it ain't easy
[16:45] but i think he he kind of likes doing it
[16:50] he's giving him a hard time everybody
[16:51] else does
[16:53] i tell him to take it easy on him
[16:58] amen
[17:01] so
[17:02] so there's a perfection in christ and
[17:04] there's a perfection that comes with the
[17:05] word that he's revealed to you and i yes
[17:08] we're perfected we're perfected by his
[17:09] blood and then there's a perfecting
[17:12] maturing
[17:13] and
[17:14] this speaking of the will and and our
[17:16] title under understanding the will
[17:18] understanding the testament and what god
[17:20] has left to us to be able to understand
[17:23] the will
[17:24] there has to be a maturity
[17:26] there you have to come to a maturity
[17:29] you know our children coming to baptism
[17:32] coming to salvation amen coming to the
[17:34] holy ghost and and that's their form
[17:37] it's their form just like it was there
[17:39] for you and i the oldest to the youngest
[17:41] it's there for everybody we have access
[17:44] to that tonight amen but amen but they
[17:47] got to come to that but if you've
[17:49] already come to that we got to go on up
[17:51] in maturity
[17:53] we got to move on up into christ
[17:55] not that not that we would try to be
[17:57] above anybody else amen but if i can
[18:00] come to maturity if i can come to an
[18:02] understanding amen i want to try to help
[18:04] somebody yes amen and i can't give i
[18:07] can't give nobody what i don't have
[18:08] myself
[18:10] you understand
[18:11] amen but but if somebody's got something
[18:14] i don't don't have it brother ben i
[18:16] expect him to tell me about it i expect
[18:18] to him i expect him to not hold back the
[18:21] whole council of god
[18:23] right
[18:24] i don't want nothing held back we don't
[18:25] want to hold nothing back if we can help
[18:27] somebody if we can lift them up if we
[18:29] can if we can help them along along the
[18:31] way a little bit that's that's what we
[18:32] do as mature christians we don't beat
[18:34] nobody over the head or trying to beat
[18:36] them down we're here to lift one another
[18:38] up is that right
[18:41] amen
[18:43] just talking about my daughter i can't
[18:44] give her the holy ghost
[18:47] brother and so we can impart eternal
[18:48] life
[18:49] but god has to give her the holy ghost i
[18:52] can bring her to the word
[18:54] yes you understand i can bring her to
[18:55] the understanding i i can bring her i
[18:57] can create a an atmosphere
[19:00] but ultimately it takes it takes that
[19:01] predestinated moment for each and every
[19:03] one of us
[19:05] amen to come to that it takes god to
[19:07] come down and do that yes sir you
[19:08] understand
[19:11] amen but but but that's what god wants
[19:13] you wants a mature church
[19:16] amen i i think we can i think we can
[19:18] handle anything
[19:21] i think i think we can handle the
[19:23] objections
[19:24] i think we can handle the accusations
[19:27] amen because because you got us you got
[19:30] to see your place you got to see your
[19:32] perfection
[19:33] you got to see you got to you got to see
[19:35] where satan's place is
[19:37] and then that's what's the what the word
[19:39] is done in this hour it's identified our
[19:41] position
[19:42] it's identified the position of the word
[19:44] it's identified the position of satan
[19:47] it's told us who he is who we are
[19:50] who has spoken to us in this day and it
[19:53] gives us an understanding and so we
[19:55] ought to be able to move forward with
[19:57] confidence and know that that there's
[19:59] going to be fiery darts there's going to
[20:01] be accusations amen but it ain't nothing
[20:03] but a bluff
[20:04] it ain't nothing but a bluff because
[20:06] christ is here and he's here and he's
[20:08] manifesting himself and abroad amen that
[20:11] was his goal amen and i believe that's
[20:12] what we ought to come to i believe that
[20:14] ought to be our goal is to let him come
[20:16] in the fullness and in his power amen
[20:18] and whatever he wants whatever he wants
[20:20] to give us because because our testing
[20:23] and i'll get to it a little bit our
[20:25] testator did not stay dead but he's
[20:27] alive forevermore
[20:29] we'll get to that in a little bit he's
[20:31] alive amen and there's an inheritance
[20:33] for you and i tonight and he wants to
[20:35] make sure that we know what it is
[20:40] amen so the fullness of the word the
[20:42] fullness of the word came in this day do
[20:44] you believe that yes everything that god
[20:46] had to reveal amen i believe he's
[20:48] revealed him yes i don't believe that
[20:50] we're waiting on nothing i don't believe
[20:52] that we're waiting on rapture and faith
[20:53] i i believe we got it right now
[20:56] and i think if if we got an enough faith
[20:58] to be raptured i think if we've got
[21:00] rapture and faith tonight i think we've
[21:01] got everything pretty well covered don't
[21:03] you if a prophet told me that that we've
[21:05] got rapture and faith and now i'll just
[21:08] i'll just take it like it is i'll take
[21:09] it like he said it
[21:11] i'm not looking for nothing else
[21:13] but i want to let him come and as our
[21:15] brother matt said i want more of it
[21:18] i'm not satisfied with what i had
[21:20] yesterday i'm not satisfied with
[21:22] yesterday's experience yesterday's manna
[21:25] amen but i believe the fullness is here
[21:27] and i want more of it i want less of
[21:29] myself and more of him
[21:36] amen so if the fullness
[21:39] amen the fullness of the word came in
[21:41] this day the fullness of he
[21:43] the godhead bodily amen that it the
[21:46] godhead body that it might manifest
[21:48] again in a people who have received it
[21:50] the people have received the word and
[21:52] many he wants to manifest that fullness
[21:54] again
[21:55] amen and as jesus fulfilled all of what
[21:58] was wrote and spoken of him amen his
[22:00] bride would be in his fullness and
[22:02] maturity and fulfill all the
[22:04] righteousness spoken of her
[22:07] so he fulfilled that testament
[22:10] jesus had an understanding of who he was
[22:14] he had an understanding of of what the
[22:16] word spoke about him
[22:18] and i believe if if we can come to an
[22:20] understanding of what god has left us of
[22:23] what god has given us amen amen let it
[22:26] go beyond just understanding but let it
[22:28] become life to you
[22:32] but we've got to have an understanding
[22:35] first corinthians 13 and 9
[22:38] for we know in part paul's speaking here
[22:40] saying for we know in part and we
[22:42] prophesy in part but when that which is
[22:44] perfect is come then that which is in
[22:47] part shall be done away
[22:49] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[22:52] understood as a child i thought as a
[22:54] child but when i became a man i put away
[22:58] childish things so paul is saying that
[23:00] amen that that which in part is going to
[23:03] be done away with
[23:04] that that which is perfect is going to
[23:06] come
[23:07] right that there's a perfection coming
[23:09] and maturing amen and when a child
[23:12] becomes a man what did he put away
[23:14] amen the way he spoke yeah
[23:17] come on
[23:18] amen amen paul said when i was a child i
[23:21] speak as a child amen but i put that
[23:23] thing away i put i put away the the way
[23:26] i understood as a child i put those
[23:28] things away i put i put away the
[23:31] childish thinking
[23:32] and then he put away the way he spoke
[23:34] the way he understood the way he thought
[23:37] amen to take to take the mind of god and
[23:40] meant to take the perfection of god and
[23:42] brother branham says here's it he said
[23:43] and we do have today by god's help the
[23:46] perfect interpretation of the word with
[23:49] divine vindication then when that which
[23:51] is part is done away with i say it's
[23:54] time amen that the church comes to
[23:56] maturity and then put away that old
[23:58] child is thinking put away that old
[24:00] childish way of speaking amen to put the
[24:02] word on your lips and then let the
[24:04] fullness of god amen realize tonight
[24:07] that there ain't nobody else gonna do it
[24:09] for you
[24:10] and when there ain't no preacher gonna
[24:12] do it for you there ain't no prophet
[24:13] gonna come back and do it for you
[24:15] remember god is requiring a church to
[24:18] come to perfection come to maturity and
[24:20] put away that childish thinking and
[24:22] accept the word in its fullness in this
[24:25] hour what the word said she could be
[24:29] amen
[24:30] i believe when we can get all of our
[24:32] little preconceived idea of how things
[24:34] should be and how everything needs to
[24:36] happen just this way amen you've got to
[24:38] die out to your own thinking you've got
[24:40] to take on the mind of christ and make
[24:43] it correct amen corinthians was the book
[24:45] of corrections and here paul was trying
[24:47] to trying to bring a correction let it
[24:49] bring a correction tonight to your
[24:51] thinking and under the way you
[24:52] understand the way you speak it may let
[24:55] it come and bring a correction amen and
[24:57] let it correct how you understand the
[24:59] way you think amen amen just say lord
[25:02] have your way i'm not going to try to
[25:04] figure it out i'm not going to try to do
[25:05] it on my own amen but i want your
[25:07] understanding i want to take on the mind
[25:10] of christ
[25:14] and just let it just let it happen
[25:15] according to your word
[25:18] he just wants a yielded vessel yeah amen
[25:28] we limit god
[25:30] by our own thoughts
[25:31] we limit god by our own ideas
[25:34] and in the message
[25:36] we become our own little organization
[25:42] become our own little
[25:43] little denomination if you go too far
[25:46] with it yeah it's hard to have your own
[25:48] way thank you there ain't nothing wrong
[25:49] with that we're all going to have a
[25:50] little different idea but i believe we
[25:53] all ought to be able to come back to the
[25:54] word yes
[25:56] we all ought to be able to come back to
[25:57] the word
[25:59] if the thing ain't just quite happening
[26:01] like you think it should
[26:03] maybe you need to let the word correct
[26:04] your thoughts
[26:05] the way you're speaking the way you're
[26:07] understanding
[26:08] come up out of that childish well i got
[26:11] this idea come out of that
[26:13] amen that's why we had to come out of of
[26:15] denominations and and different things
[26:17] you and and then a lot of us not
[26:20] not really me i've been in the message
[26:22] my whole life
[26:24] message church
[26:26] and you can develop things along the way
[26:28] it's pretty easy
[26:31] but even in those denominations people
[26:33] tried to carry some of those things over
[26:35] the message
[26:37] but you they had to die out to those
[26:38] things
[26:40] and as as time goes on
[26:42] as time goes on amen if we're not
[26:45] careful we'll develop our own little
[26:46] ideas amen we've got we've got to stay
[26:49] dead to ourselves paul said i gotta die
[26:51] daily that christ may live
[26:54] and die to your own thinking
[26:59] brother burnham said we have the perfect
[27:00] interpretation
[27:02] with divine vindication
[27:06] amen
[27:08] that ought to give us a confidence
[27:11] that ought to that ought to
[27:13] correct our thinking a little bit yeah
[27:16] that we can come to a place and and lay
[27:18] ourselves open
[27:20] lay ourselves open to that to that
[27:22] vindication to that perfect
[27:23] interpretation
[27:25] amen and if you'll stay brother brown
[27:26] said if you you'll stay before the
[27:28] presence of that son amen amen as we
[27:30] listen to the word as we as we as we
[27:33] feast on the message of the hour amen
[27:35] that's not we're not feeding on the the
[27:36] words of amen but we're feeding on the
[27:38] body word of the son of man we're
[27:40] feeding on the word amen and we're
[27:42] laying in the presence of the sun
[27:44] and when a seed lays in the presence of
[27:46] the sun there there
[27:48] it's a seed
[27:50] yeah it's a seed but there has to be a
[27:52] process
[27:54] it has to mature before it can go up in
[27:55] the corner
[27:57] right and we have to come to a maturing
[27:59] amen if we expect to make a rapture
[28:02] that's part of it right amen we're
[28:05] waiting on that last one to get sealed
[28:07] in i believe that
[28:08] but we got to come to maturity too
[28:10] that's right yeah we got to come to that
[28:12] that's what god wants in this hour yes
[28:15] sir amen put away the childish things
[28:18] put away the
[28:20] that old childish way of speaking
[28:22] put the word on your lips
[28:29] brother branham says here
[28:31] in a letter to the church and when he
[28:32] said i'll take up my pen and rot and i'm
[28:35] just going to reference a few things
[28:36] here
[28:37] and i've been hearing some of these
[28:38] things they've been standing out to me
[28:41] the same harmony that jesus had with the
[28:43] father
[28:44] amen when he only did that which pleased
[28:46] the father brother rem said it exists
[28:49] now between the groom and the bride
[28:52] amen and he said he shows her his word
[28:54] of life
[28:55] and she receives it
[28:57] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[29:00] not even death
[29:02] he said if she goes down just like the
[29:04] seed when it's watered it will raise up
[29:06] again
[29:07] and he said here is the secret the word
[29:10] is in the bride as it was in mary and
[29:12] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[29:14] knows what he wants done with the word
[29:18] it's been standing out to me so much
[29:20] i've heard brother ben reference him
[29:24] you know satan in life
[29:26] during life
[29:27] he'll try to confuse you
[29:31] you know he'll he'll try to bring a
[29:33] cloudiness or something
[29:35] but if we'll take what a prophet said
[29:38] that the spirit instructed him to take
[29:40] up the pen and rot
[29:42] and you identify yourself tonight as the
[29:44] bride of jesus christ
[29:46] you say tonight that i have the mind of
[29:49] christ
[29:50] i may not completely fully understand
[29:52] how to how to deal with this person or
[29:54] deal with this situation but i've been
[29:56] called to be the bride of jesus christ
[29:59] and i've been called to have an
[30:00] understanding i've been called to to be
[30:02] able to have have the word to have thus
[30:05] saith the lord
[30:06] he didn't just say that was for brother
[30:08] branham
[30:09] he said it was a letter to the church
[30:12] and i'm not trying to do away brother
[30:13] branham and i know y'all know that
[30:17] he didn't just say it was for the pastor
[30:19] or the preacher
[30:21] but it was for the sister
[30:23] for the deacon for the janitor
[30:26] for for for whoever can come to that
[30:28] maturity and realize who they are in the
[30:30] word amen that that you can go forth
[30:34] and you may not know nothing but your
[30:36] father in heaven he'll give you what you
[30:39] have need of he'll give you what you
[30:40] have need of you he'll he'll tell you
[30:42] what to say if you'll stand there in
[30:45] faith you may not know how to operate
[30:47] from day to day amen things may get so
[30:49] confusing so dark amen but if we'll take
[30:52] the promise if we'll identify with what
[30:54] a prophet said we could be amen that i
[30:56] had the mind of christ i know what god
[30:58] wants done and i'm going to stand today
[31:00] i'm going to take my glorious stand amen
[31:03] amen this bride she's not going to fall
[31:06] she's not going to fall amen i can walk
[31:08] with confidence amen amen satan i
[31:11] believe god kept that back from satan i
[31:13] was talking to my wife you know when you
[31:16] say something satan hears that then he
[31:18] knows about it but god reserved that in
[31:21] in this day
[31:23] and satan has always tried to destroy
[31:25] the seed he always thought he had him he
[31:28] always thought he had him he thought he
[31:30] had christ amen when he brought it when
[31:32] he went down to hell even but our lord
[31:34] overcame because he was ordained to
[31:36] overcome he was the fulfillment and the
[31:39] bride in this last days she's the
[31:41] fulfillment and she's the recipient of
[31:43] the covenant of the will of this last
[31:46] testament she's the fulfillment
[31:49] of the new testament
[31:50] [Music]
[31:53] and there ain't nothing he can do about
[31:55] it that's right
[32:00] but he'll bring objections
[32:02] he'll bring accusations
[32:04] amen but we will overcome him by the
[32:07] blood of the lamb
[32:08] by the perfection yes we will overcome
[32:11] him
[32:12] amen
[32:14] not us but christ in us yes
[32:19] it's his blood it's his word amen
[32:23] amen the bride has the mind of christ
[32:25] for she knows what he wants done with
[32:26] the word she performs the command of the
[32:28] word in his name she has thus saith the
[32:31] lord
[32:32] and he said and god quickens his word by
[32:34] the spirit to come to pass
[32:36] a seed is planted and watered and it
[32:38] comes to full harvest serving its
[32:40] purpose
[32:42] that's what god is an intention is today
[32:45] for the word not to let it fall by the
[32:47] wayside amendment that it might serve
[32:50] its purpose
[32:53] some
[32:54] some plant
[32:55] some water
[32:57] but god gives the increase
[32:59] we can't do nothing
[33:01] we can we can only throw the seed we can
[33:03] water it we can water with praise amen
[33:06] but the life-giver is god he's the one
[33:09] that brings the increase say man i want
[33:11] to be a hundredfold tonight hey man i
[33:13] want the word to fall on good ground
[33:15] amen i want it to come to its maturity
[33:17] in my life i don't want to sit stagnant
[33:20] sit still sit in an old old old
[33:23] condition where where i'm not growing
[33:25] much and you know i want to get out in

[33:29] little bit of rain every now and then
[33:31] feed me the message of the hour
[33:34] let me be in a holy ghost meeting every

[34:03] the new testament we read this before
[34:05] that by means of death for the
[34:07] redemption of the transgression that
[34:09] we're under the first testament they
[34:10] which are called not receive the promise
[34:13] of eternal inheritance amen our
[34:15] inheritance won't pass away but it's an
[34:18] eternal inheritance
[34:20] first timothy 2 5 said for there is one
[34:22] god one mediator between god and man the
[34:25] man christ jesus who gave himself a
[34:28] ransom to all to be testified in due
[34:30] time amen our mediator he's able to

[34:57] making good on your confession yes
[35:00] amen making good on what you put on your
[35:03] lips
[35:04] right
[35:05] if you can put the word on your lips
[35:07] he's able to make good on it i believe
[35:10] that tonight
[35:11] there he stands as a mediator
[35:16] amen
[35:17] by the blood of christ
[35:19] by by that blood
[35:21] he purged us he made a way for us and he
[35:24] stands there as a mediator not tonight

[35:32] we have with god
[35:34] amen what is the arrangement that we
[35:36] have that whatsoever you ask the father
[35:38] in my name that will i do
[35:42] jesus spoke that word he spoke that and
[35:45] he's there to make good on it tonight i
[35:47] believe that yes
[35:49] amen whatsoever you ask in my name that
[35:51] will i do ask the father what is the
[35:54] covenant that we have it's an
[35:55] unconditional covenant
[35:57] amen he has swore by himself that he
[35:59] would do it he has swore by jesus christ
[36:02] amen and he has sent back the holy ghost
[36:04] as a confirmation in its unmerited favor
[36:07] the grace of jesus christ to you and i
[36:09] yes
[36:11] he's the testator of that tonight
[36:13] he is the mediator of the will by his
[36:16] death bringing redemption amen from that
[36:18] old life
[36:19] amen he just didn't leave us the way we
[36:21] were but he changed us
[36:23] that they they which are called and
[36:25] might receive the promise
[36:27] of eternal inheritance
[36:29] amen he brought us from death under life
[36:33] amen that we might receive an eternal
[36:36] inheritance and brother branham says
[36:37] here when the spirit has found you the
[36:39] individual
[36:41] and has come upon you it is the
[36:42] potential of your eternal inheritance
[36:45] that god thought of you and made you
[36:48] before the foundation of the world that
[36:50] is your potential
[36:52] you got potentials in your denied amen
[36:54] it's the potential what is the potential
[36:56] it's the earnest of you being quickened
[36:58] from mortal to immortality

[37:08] going to go away i could leave them
[37:09] laying houses it's all going to corrupt
[37:12] it's all going to pass away amen but god
[37:15] and when the testator amen by his blood
[37:17] has redeemed us and brought us to an
[37:19] eternal inheritance amen where my body

[37:23] the earnest i received amen that what's
[37:26] that down payment amen that god by the
[37:28] holy ghost he's bringing me to a rapture
