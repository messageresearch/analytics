feel the pull or something let's just bow our heads if we could just for a moment lord we just come before you this this evening just just honored to be in your presence thank you for the service that we've had for all the mothers just want to give them honor lord and we're our honor is due god we just pray just give them a special blessing this day lord i pray now that we just make our hearts ready lord for the coming of the none of world thoughts or ideas would be injected lord but it would just be the word and would it be the word in due season or the seed would just take place and find its home or they've been following good ground that's perceptible and ready to receive god i pray just bless us lord i pray that you just move me aside again just take control of my lips my body lord that i would just be a servant just a vessel for you in jesus christ amen amen if you would turn with me to luke chapter 15 and verse 11. we'll begin reading there i'll let you let you have your seats and i'd like to this evening just if we could title it anything it would just be all he has and then we'll kind of be looking kind of lay a foundation tonight and just want to look at the prodigal son's brother actually and kind of look at him just for a little bit tonight and so luke chapter 15 and verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them as living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there he wasted his sustenance substance with righteous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would have faint filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father have bred enough to spare and i perish with hunger you can have your seats this evening and so we see that the prodigal son here he he come to the father and he asks and i know we we've heard this preached on many times and and i myself have preached on it but just kind of like to go through this just this little bible study maybe tonight and and just kind of see what the lord has in store for us did you enjoy the service this morning and i definitely did as well and just appreciate all of our mothers and and all them coming out just appreciate y'all and you know that's uh you know i really enjoyed how brother ben really broke that down you know we've got to continue even though they're educated in school but the true education starts in the home and i just that really really hit home with me you know i was i was looking at a study um i went to this training and there was they have a philosopher come out now and it's a modern day philosopher but he talked about the study of the twins i don't know if any of y'all ever heard of it but they've actually been pretty controversial lately but in the 1960s i believe they actually went and some some psychiatrists and a few other people actually went to clinics um for children to be adopted and they actually divided up twins and triplets and they studied them all through their lives and they never knew they had a twin or sibling and so now they've all found out and of course it's a pretty big fuss and and so yale university has locked up the documentation for 75 years i think is what it what it is and but anyways it was it was pretty neat some of those studies some of these twins were separated at birth and and there was there was one set they they smoked the same cigarette they drove the same car they even named their first child the same name they never met anywhere in life and so the study was genetics versus environment and and so on and so you know looking at that study there were some you know that were identical twins some that were just twins and then there were triplets and and so they began to study and see what genetics had to do with it what environment had to do with it what this had to do it so so i truly believe as as believers i believe that the holy spirit can trump all of those things is that right i believe it can trump environment i believe it can trump genetics and and so you look at that study and they were trying to figure out what really ruled but i believe as christians if there's something that can rule our lives it's the holy spirit is that right and so i just want to kind of look at this and you see the the two brothers here they grew up in the same home they grew up the same same one the same father the same mother and you see both had two different desires in the heart one wanted to get out and one wanted to stay and you see this prodigal son he went away he wasted all that he had and and but he had to come and recognize his condition is that right and i think that's the third what do they say the first step is acceptance but you've got to recognize the condition you're in you know we can't we can't blame it on this one you know we can only blame the pastor so much for our spiritual condition and then it's up to us to change that is that right and so he he began to go through his life and he began to recognize that he was still a son and now brother branham says in 1957 he says now i believe this he said i could be wrong he said i'm just a man as you are but i believe the coming of the lord is past due and he said i believe the reason that god can't come is on our condition of his church he said it's all separated and broke up and everything that could be thought of as mixed into it and he said it's got to come a time for an old-fashioned shaking down he said a settling down of the church of god he says now as we see this day he said this was a perfect type then of today so what he's saying is the the he's typing us back to it and he says first thing they had they had an ark and a prophet and an angel and he's talking about the children of israel and he said the word their prophet their angel and that sacred light followed him and he said as they came out of egypt after after moses he said god took 40 years bringing them into condition they were 40 years past because their differences and not recognizing so what pretty much brother branham is saying you know they could have went into the they could have went straight into the land that they were promised but because of their differences and not recognizing who they are they went 40 years past due now the bible says in the days of noah god was long suffering he wasn't willing that any should perish and he said as it was in the days of noah so will be in the coming of the son of man and he said i believe the coming of the lord is past due then he said for he had to wait long in noah's time he had to wait long in bringing out israel and i believe he's waiting long he said but i believe his patience is getting thin with us and so we see that as the as the prodigal son that did go away we must see that it is time for us to check up and it's time to see that that you and i have got to recognize the condition that we're in and and the good thing about about the scripture is is when the prodigal son recognized the condition that he was in he had a place to go to is that right and you know you and i as as sons and daughters of god we may get out of step every now and again as brother branham's seeing the vision he's seen the he's seen some of the bride they were getting out of stead but he screamed get back in line and i think that can happen to any of us i think when we get to a position in our life that we think we can't fall i think that's when god will cause us to fall to show that we're not in charge but he is is that right it's not that god would show his his his his power over us but he would show us that we've got to be submissive to the word but it's not by our might but it's by his is that right now i just want to lay a foundation it may take me a few minutes to get into it but we'll pray that god will give us something here near the end and now brother branham also says further on down this quote he says each age has to recognize the word for them and so that's good we've all recognized the word is that right but the next phrase comes and then fulfill the word so it's not good enough that we just recognize that the god sent a prophet god gave us the word for this day but now we've got to fulfill the word that was given to us do you believe that and it says we have the fullness of the word and we must recognize it and then must fulfill that and he said at the end of each age they would denominate around the light and forget about going on in it and so that's what was happening in each age they would get the light and then they would find a way to denominate around it and that's what's happening now in today's time you see that they've got this portion they want to denominate that right now so it shows that this must be the end of an age is that right and you know i heard a guy say one time you can drive a car from the east coast to the west coast in the dark he said you've got the headlights on the car is that right you can't see the hallway but you can see a hundred feet in front of you and i believe that's the way it is with jesus when he says walk in the light as i said i am the light walk in the light with me we must be walking with him it's not that we can see the message of the hour and then sit down and stay in and denominate around it we must continue moving until the rapture comes is that right now i see that israel marched they began to march in circles for a year because they couldn't they marched in circles for years because they could not recognize who they were they could not could not recognize what god had truly given them and and they got in the desert and they got tired of waiting on the word and then what would they do they would find something to denominate around is that right they would say well we want to we want to do this and we want to do that and i don't remember who was preaching if it was brother ben or brother stewart or brother joel but they were preaching about saul and david and it never clicked to me it never occurred to me that you know the people they cried out for saul they cried out for a king they wanted a king and it never occurred to me god had a king coming and it was david god was already raising up a david to come along and the people got ahead of god they wanted to get ahead of him and they raised up their own man is that right and wanted to do it led them into destruction but what did god do he kept his king that was coming which was david and god straightened it out do you believe that this morning or this evening i'm still preaching from this morning so brother ben said y'all might be tired y'all ate really good so i might have to wake you all up so brother joe knows i had nine years experience in the funeral home so i'm kind of good if people are quiet it doesn't bother me at all so i'm not scared of a dead person some of you all think that's funny but there is a phobia of dead people one person that couldn't hurt you and that's the one you're going to be afraid of you know it's kind of funny in god's eyes satan's been defeated and some of you are still afraid of him yes yes sir all right so he says brother graham says he goes on here he says now if you'll notice he said as it was in the days of noah and he said in the days of noah before the flood how it would be and god was not willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance and and you know i've been seeing this a lot in the quotes that i've been reading that that god was long suffering and he didn't want to see any perish and you know i have a problem with people who don't want to let other people in and yeah you know i've got a i've got a problem with people who don't want to let other people in the message because they've done this or they've done that but if you look at the spirit of god you know you look at what god does he didn't want to see any perish is that right and if you have a spirit this evening that you want to see others perish or they've maybe done you wrong and you're like well i hope they get what they deserve well if any of us got what we deserved we'd go to we'd go to hell is that right so we don't want anybody to get what they deserve we want we want to get what god has for us and that's the grace that's the long suffering of god and yeah and now brother and he goes on he says the flood stage was past due and i was reading this scripture just a little bit ago and i thought it was so neat how i was looking to see the timing that god shut the door and and if you read the scripture god said the scripture says god shut him in and i began to think about that you know it was noah that was the righteous one is that right he didn't god wasn't saving the animals he wasn't saving this one but he was looking out for noah is that right and the scripture says god shut him in and i believe that's the way he's done the bride he sealed you and i up with the holy ghost to protect us until the rapture is that right now he said noah was the righteous one and he suffered long and he said he said down in egypt it was past due he says do you get it in the anteluvian destruction now he said it was way past due and he said the destruction and judgment and coming out of egypt was past due 40 years over time but god was determined god was determined that his word would not return unto him void so we see that when god speaks something it's going to come to pass do you believe that he said he was going to keep his word he was going to keep his word he must do it in order to be god and and he says if he has to make a change of everything by grace he will do it that's the reason i say if the church does not get herself ready and i love this brother brian i'm a highlight he said that's your duty to get ready that's not the pastor's job it's not the ministry's job although that is a part of what we are called to do but it is your individual duty to get yourself ready to meet him in the air is that right because there is no man that will be able to come up at the day of judgment and say well my pastor did this or this minister did this or or i didn't understand this or i didn't do that each of you have been given grace by the gift of god that you will be there standing on your own accord not on another man's accord is that right now he says the bride has made herself ready the garments is paid for they are ready but you must wear you must be ready to wear those garments he said the church has made herself ready now and i thought it was really neat if you look at the story of eleazar taking rebecca to isaac if you begin to look at that story you see that they're going back and and they come to it and they ask your parents and i know i preached on this a while back but it just seems like i just keep going back to this but they asked they asked everybody if she could go and the parents said no let her let her tarry for a while but then they asked her and she said i will go and and so eliezer leaves and they they take her and it was so interesting to me that when they were coming back on the camels as as she was riding back with eleazar when she saw isaac off in the field she she lit off her camel's what the scripture says she said she jumped off her camel and and the scripture says it's because she asked eliezer who is this man and he said this is isaac and what did she do right then she put a veil over her face she was making herself ready for the bridegroom and so you and i know who our bridegroom is is that right we had a prophet come in this day tell us exactly who the bridegroom was tell us exactly who the bride was and then you and i have to make ourselves ready is that right yes do you love the lord this evening now we'll continue on with luke chapter 15. we'll move on to verse 18 and work our way down through this scripture no he said i will arise and go to my father and i will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and i'm no more worthy to be called thy son and make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and i am no more worthy to be called thy son and i don't know about you but i felt that way many many times and and he said but the father said unto his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and you see that he was finally ready to wear that robe because he realized that it wasn't anything by his might but it was by his father's mind is that right and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and he said bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they begin to be merry now brother branham says at the same this is recognized in your day and its message in 1964 he said at the same time the bride has recognized the evening light just begin to recognize he said the hungry pentecostals have begun to recognize that them organizations hasn't gotten anything that they're looking for they're so twisted and tore up he said see it's time of recognition he said you've got to recognize he said the world is recognized and i believe i believe brother ben has mentioned this the world is recognized this is the end time yes they they've recognized that this is the end and they're preparing themselves for destruction he says the nations has recognized science has recognized he says and the devil has recognized it's the time that he can wreck women wreck the church wreck the people he's recognized that he says but god has recognized that there's a people on earth predestinated to life so i want you to know this evening god has not forgotten about you and i is that right he said he's recognized this is the time to send his message and he did it he said the people has recognized that the bride time has realized the evening light so you see that you and i we had something as brother branham talks about the deep calling to the deep you and i were crying we were searching for something we were looking for something and whenever we heard this message something responded to that we were searching for is that right and so we can see that as the bride of jesus christ he didn't just hand us out here and throw us out into the world or throw us out as a into the pawn shop but he has always had a purpose and a plan for our lives is that right we just have to trust him the scripture says when he returns it doesn't say will he find the best church or the best dressed or the best this or the best that it says will i find faith yes amen so we've we've been given the fullness of the word we we still receive fresh manna from heaven daily and and you know the children of israel it's amazing how well i'll read it in the scripture here in a minute but how god took care of them through every trial and tribulation to prepare them to not forget that god was in charge is that right if you look at that now with what i'm about to read god is telling the people don't forget that i brought you through all these things because in good times that's when people forget is that right when everything's bad and it's somehow amazing when everything's bad or going wrong people remember how to pray but when everything's good that's when we forget to pray that's when we get lacks and i'm preaching to myself this morning when times are hard that's when we cry out to god but we have to remember as the bride of jesus christ it's our duty to be responding and worshipping him amen i want to read from deuteronomy just chapter 8 verse 1 and we'll read several verses here but he says all that all the commandments which i commanded thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee and know what was in thy heart whether thou would us keep his commandments or know so the purpose was not for god to just over overthrow himself over the children of israel but to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thy heart and and so we see that god had a purpose for everything that he did and everything that he does he has a purpose behind it and verse 3 said and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he may make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live he said thy raiment wax not old upon me neither did thy foot swell these forty years so god is saying you know i've taken care of you and what is he saying this for because he wants them to continue to trust him is that right you know if you don't take care of your children they're not going to trust you is that right if you if you tell your child this and then you go and do that and you tell your child this and you go and do something complete opposite they're not going to trust you because they're they're watching you do something other than what you're saying is that right and right you know the other day we were at the ball fields and i was looking at you know i i coached my son's little league team and and i'm always harder on my son because you know he's my son i'm with him all the time and i was watching another dad and he was coaching his son he was doing the same thing but he was being just out there and i was like god thank you for showing me this please never let me do that to my son and and because you you kind of get lost in it there for just for a few minutes and you want to take out the rest of the team's problems on this one and sometimes maybe that would happen with a pastor maybe that would happen with a minister maybe that would happen with a lay member and what we begin to do is if something goes wrong and we begin to blame this one person is that right i don't know why i'm going this direction it's not in my nose but we begin to blame that one person knowing good and well it's not anybody's fault but our own is that right and so many times in a church what we can do and what we can see is is when we begin to blame everybody else for our problems you know i i read a quote a long time ago and it said you know i i don't really i'm not too worried about anybody else's opinion unless they pay my bills or or do this or that and i know that's a little bit crude but but i don't think you should blame anything on anybody else i think we were responsible ultimately at the end of the day for how you and i live you know you can say well i was done wrong by this one or i was done wrong by that one and that's a horrible thing and i pray that you can forgive them and you can all move on but but even if they don't they don't ever apologize or they don't ever ask for forgiveness it's your duty to still forgive them is that right the power of forgiveness does not set them free it sets you free is that right so i believe that as sons and daughters of god we have the ability to be free but we have the power or the authority to set ourselves free and sometimes we just can't see that now he god goes on and he said thou shalt not also consider in thine heart that as a man shaithaness his son so the lord god chasteneth thee therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks and water of fountains and depths of the springs out of the valleys of the hills and a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of olive olive and honey and he said a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it the land whose stones are iron and who out of heels thou may dig breath now this sounds like a pretty good place you know it's like if somebody called you and said i've got a place for you to live it's free the fridge is restocked on a daily basis the the insurance is paid the electric's paid everything you need is there all you've got to do is follow the lord right and so we see that god's doing this and one thou hast eaten and art full thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good of the land which he hath given thee now in verse 11 this is very important it says be be aware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statues which i command thee this day now this is probably an odd scripture to read after the prodigal son scripture because what did he do he did everything opposite this he went away he wasted his living he went to the wrong land but as i said at the beginning we want to look at the prodigal son's brother this evening but god is dealing with his people that are about to experience really good times and he's being very very hard on them he's saying you're about to experience all this your belly will not be will not be empty your belly will be full everything you have need of you're about to be blessed greatly but he knows how people get and so he's saying in all this good time forget not what i have commanded thee and now he says then shot he says and when the herds and thy flocks multiply thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage now we were all no matter your condition if you were raised in a message church or cut your teeth on a message pew or how young you were you were raised in a house of bondage and god had to set you free god had to save your soul you know maybe somebody was out doing way worse things than you were but you still needed the same grace and the same blood that that person needed amen no one should ought to think highly of himself than the other because we all needed the same thing and that was the grace of almighty god he goes on in verse 15 he said who led you through the great and terrible wilderness wearing fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flynn he said who fed thee in the wilderness with manna and thy fathers knew not that that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do the good in thy latter end and thou shalt say in thine heart my power and my might hand and my might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth the power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he swear unto his fathers as it is this day yes and i think this applies really good to us that in our jobs and in our in our home life and the things that god gives us even in earthly possessions we should never forget that it's god who gives us each item that you and i possess is that right no matter if you're if you're rich or you're poor whatever you've got if you've got good health or bad health whatever you've got that's good in your life we cannot forget that god has given us those things now he says and i'm gonna just read two more scripts and he said it shall be if thou do all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that you shall surely perish as the nations which the lord destroyed before your face so shall you perish because you would not be obedient to the voice of the lord your god now they had the commandment in the scripture warning them not to forget about god and not to forget that there they were they were nothing without him and that he was everything and that that they should continue to walk in the light as he is in the light and and so we see that all these things are coming down to the children of israel and and god is telling them you know don't forget me in the good times don't forget me in the good times you don't just need me in the bad but remember me in the good john 8 and verse 12 says then speak jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but hat shall have the light of life so we see that we are not to come to this age and come to the end of this age and denominate around one little idea or one little thing but we've got to continue marching on in the light is that right that's why i believe god called men of god because you know brother ram said even when we get over to the other side things will continue to be unfolding throughout eternity and i believe that the word has come in its fullness and that we have the fullness of the word but i believe god brings ministers and he brings pastors and he brings different ones and and even on the tapes things are still unfolding but but god brings them for a purpose and that's to work out a better thing in our life is that right first john 1 7 it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sins now we'll jump back to the prodigal son here in luke verse 15 and chapter 25 and we'll look at his brother here and it says now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew night of the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and he asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother has come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound and the next verse that says and he was angry all right yeah so his brother's come back home and he's changed his life and now he's angry he said he would not go in now maybe this is a little bit more harsh than what some of us do but maybe sometimes we see god bless another individual in the church or in the body of the bride and we get a little jealous and say well god is doing this for them and god's doing this for them and well i'm just not even going to participate or go in with them i'm just going to i'm just going to isolate myself and pull off to the side and he said he was angry and would not go in therefore his father came out as father and entreated him and you know i love in this story you know the the father goes out to the to the son that went away and he goes out to the son that stayed home you know whenever the scripture says that we love him because he first loved us there's proof after proof after the scripture that he come searching for you and i we weren't looking for him he was looking for us and he said he said and he answered and said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment brother ben this was this was your front row this was your front row lay member right here was this guy he was he was better than joel he was here every service dressed to the nines he was a good guy right he was better than brother stewart was he was better than brother jerome he was the best church member but he got treated a little differently he thought another person got treated a little better than they ought to be treated and so we see he says when he said and yet thou never gave us me a kid that i may might make mary with my friend so he's saying you know all these years i've served you i've come to church not just sunday morning but sunday night and not only sunday night but this was a wednesday night goer right this guy was hardcore he was there if we had a special meeting or a prayer meeting he was there and he said and i i've been there all this time and now one not one time did you make mary or give me the kid and so you didn't let me celebrate with my friends we didn't throw a party and he said and verse 30 says but as soon as thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou has killed for him the fatted calf and so he's saying you know this guy that was out in the world went and lived actually with prostitutes and went and wasted all the money that you had worked hard for when he comes home you let him have a party right and verse 31 and i want you to remember it's not god's fault yeah and he said and he said unto him son thou are ever with me and all that i have is thine so i want to look this this evening if we could just on that scripture for a minute everything that his father had was his is that right he said son everything that i have is yours and i give it to you but the son failed to do one thing take authority and use what his father had given and i say is the bride of jesus christ god has given us all powers over every evil thing but you and i will sit there and set on a pew and refuse to take authority to use what god has given us but when someone comes in and they have faith to believe and god begins to work in their lives it's not our job to pucker up and say well that's not fair you've had the right since god filled you with the holy ghost to take that authority and use it for what you had needed so what the father is saying is if you needed a fatted calf it was there if you needed healing it was there it's your fault that you didn't go and get the kid and be merry with your friends so we see it in the next verse he says it was meat it was and that word meat means necessary that we should make mary and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found so i think we ought to rejoice when a son and daughter comes back to god is that right but we must never forget that whenever we're having good times as this one was he was at church he was doing this he was doing that we must never forget that we still have the authority to act on god's power is that right that if you need your family if you've got a loved one that's lost and out there you have the authority to claim the word of god and call god after that son or daughter is that right yeah so we can see that many times you know if if i was to take candy home and let's say that matthew maybe ran away and in paxton there was the candy bucket there and i'm just going to bring it down into layman's terms and and you know and man he comes home and i'm so excited to see him so i give him all this candy and he eats and he eats and he eats and paxton comes mad to me says why didn't you give me any of the candy and i can say it was there all the time yeah and i feel like there's so many believers that live below their privilege you know brother branham said we've got a checkbook with no balance on it right that there's an unlimited balance that we can write the check and it will be good when we take it to the bank i feel like sometimes we allow ourselves to maybe be sicker than we should be and maybe we allow ourselves to be depressed more than we should be or we we try to let we try to isolate ourselves and feel all alone and feel this way in that way but i want you to know you know one one trick of the devil is he likes to come in and he likes to just give you a thought and he likes you to feed that thought he will make you think that maybe maybe somebody doesn't like you or maybe somebody doesn't love you or maybe the pastor likes this one a little bit better and he'll give you that little thought and and then he doesn't have to do anything but if you feed on that thought you will feed it and you will feed it and it will grow and it will grow until it consumes you is that right and then when the lost soul comes in you can't even be excited because you're living in a dead state now we had to see that this prodigal son that was home just like the prodigal son that went away he failed to realize that he was the son right he failed to realize that all the father had was his if you read that scripture at the beginning and you look at the scripture where the prodigal sons leaves the father it says the father divided among them his living he gave the other son his living at that time and so this son had failed to use what god had given him both sons were living below their privileges now brother braham says in 56 and jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says have faith in god he said just only believe he said oh all you've got to do is believe or he says all of you ought to believe he said this is for our hour and it's encouraging if you just had faith he said jesus already done the work he said this is just his love and grace to you can't you see he said as cleopas and them walked along the way he said they walked with them all day and didn't know it but the way he did something they recognized that it was him and he said well i tried to tell you that that that when he was here on earth they would recognize the same way he says you've walked with him a long time maybe in your church and didn't know it he said but he's here he's alive he isn't dead so maybe you've been walking as cleopas and them you've been sitting in church and you've been walking right along with everybody and not even realizing that jesus christ is here in our midst and still alive today he's still with us today to perform miracles and and he's still able to do these things but you've got to have your eyes open so that you can have that authority to call on the power of almighty god now i i was i don't remember who preached on samson last i think it was either brother stewart or brother joel but whoever it was it was really neat how how you were you were preaching and and i'll begin i just jotted down a note and and i began to look at this story a little bit more but you know the philistines thought the power laid in samson yes and that's where they messed up what did they do they broke down samson and i believe the devil has failed to realize that the power is not in the bride but it's in god as that ride and we have you know as brother branham talks about the little policeman he says you know he could not stop a 300 horsepower car but he has the authority behind him of that city and that government to stop him just as you and i have the authority of jesus christ because we're joined heirs with christ is that right so everything he had a privilege to you and i have a privilege too and so you see the phyllis the philistines they begin to break down samson they plucked out his eye they shaved his head and they did all these things but they failed to realize that samson's power did not come from himself but it come from god is that right and so maybe some of you are sitting here broken today maybe some of you are down or you're just tired or you're maybe just weary along the way but i want you to know your power doesn't come from in yourself but it comes from almighty god and that's a power that will never run dry do you believe that so just whenever you know i i love that how you know the the devil thought that the power was maybe within you and i but the power was in god and god will not lose a one do you believe that yes do you love the lord this evening i made myself promise that my gift to all the mothers this evening would be not to hold you all very long so i have a timer set we were talking in the back how i like to preach on grace and i really do and it's because where much grace is given there's just much love right i needed a lot of grace and i feel like i still need grace every day and you know i i don't want to ever think too highly of myself because i can promise you this every time i've thought highly of myself my bubble has been busted publicly it's like god doesn't just let me do it on my own he's like no i'm gonna you know i'm gonna shame you in public so that you know that it's not by your own hand and you know god doesn't do that because he hates us god does that because he loves us right i see some of you smiling because some of you are probably there for most of those situations but you know one time i was a young man and i'll tell this to lighten it up because everybody is very tired and i can see it on your faces that you had too much food and just jealous i'm not really sad i'm just jealous but one time i was a young man and i they were gonna let me call out the minister and i thought it was a pretty big deal and i was kind of walking tall and this is why i don't like getting up in front of people anymore and i get up there to call out the minister's name i forgot it and i panicked old immediately and said the brother that's going to preach and then i just put the mic down and walked out of the church and it was a little church in in north carolina but god has a way of putting us putting us in our place right because none of us are higher than we are none of us ought to think higher than we are but you know the whole point behind this sermon this evening is to realize that in good conditions what do you do because it's not in bad conditions we all know what we do in bad conditions we cry out to god is that right if you look at every bad condition in the bible people are crying out to god people are searching for god but in the good conditions in the good times people fail to realize that god is still the same god is that right he's still worthy of our praise and that's something i've been wanting to work on is when i worship god even if i don't like the song or don't maybe even maybe maybe that message isn't resounding with me like it is with somebody else i should still praise him is that right even if everything's going good and everything's going okay you know i found a little note in my bible when paxton was sick and i wrote out there that you know i'm so happy and grateful that my son is now healed and that my family is happy and healthy and you know in that time i was fasting i was praying i was doing all these things and it began to really prick my i think i found that note for a reason because it kind of struck home with me that i'm not doing those things right now because things are good everybody's healthy everybody's happy and everything's going good but you know i must not forget him in those good times is that right whenever things going good with the family we ought to take that time and maybe kill an extra devil is that right maybe when the house is clean we ought to make sure that every closet is clean and every every laundry room in the attic make sure that we've got it cleaned out we don't want to just win a battle but we're here to win the war do you believe that second corinthians 5 and verse 15 it says all that he died and that he died for all and they which should live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again so it's saying that when he died for us we don't live for ourselves anymore but we live for christ is that right everything that you do even though it seems maybe maybe whenever you're working maybe brother caleb when you're painting a home you're doing this or you're doing that every every stroke of that brush everything you do ought to be glorifying god is that right it says wherefore henceforth know ye says no we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh ye now henceforth no we no we know him no more says therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and he says all things are of god who hath reconciled us him us to himself by jesus christ and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation now all of us like to say that god has reconciled us through to christ through to to jesus is that right we're reconciled us to god through jesus excuse me it's been a long time since i preached i'm getting a little tongue tied but god reconciled us unto himself through jesus christ right yeah so and then it also the very next sentence says and give us the ministry of reconciliation and i would i'd be far-fetched to say many of you grew up in the message our our theme has not been reconciliation but it's been division or been this or that or two side are you on and i think if anybody ever asked you whose side you're on you ought to say i'm on the lord's side is that right i'm not on any man's side i'm on god's side and we ought to have the ministry of reconciliation that when somebody separates we not maybe not ought to cut them off or cut their head off or cut their feet out from under them but we ought to pray to try to reconcile them back to god through who jesus christ amen not through a man not through this one or through that one but the same way that god brought us back to him through jesus christ verse 19 it says to with that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation says now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us and we pray you in christ's stead be you reconciled to god so he's talking here the men come and they preach the message of jesus christ but they say don't be reconciled to us right don't be reconciled to the ministry but to god he says for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and this word reconcile it means to call back into union and friendship the affections which we have which have been alienated to restore to friendship or or favor after estrangement reconcile men or parties that have been at variance so if god has given us the the ministry of reconciliation then our ministry ought to be and to go and get those who've left right not to further kick them out not to further push them away and it's not to grow numbers in the church but it's to call and do what god called us to do and be a witness to all those in the world is that right in laodicea yes now brother brown says in the waters of separation i've got just a few more minutes and my timer is going to go off so just bear with me and and then you can go be in a food coma with your mom and and celebrate mother's day the right way amen and so he went down to the gates he says now look to do the work of a kinsman he says he said you ministers this may not be new but for the congregation he went down to the gate and he says where all the elders of israel come in and a kinsmen now he said to redeem and he must be a near kinsman he can't just be anybody he must be a kinsmen and that's you know jesus wasn't just anybody right he wasn't just another prophet he wasn't just another person walking this earth this was the fullness of the godhead bodily in flesh is that right this was god made flesh so it wasn't just anybody coming down it wasn't an angel it wasn't this one it wasn't that one but this was jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and he come down as a near kinsman he says he must be a kinsmen he says and look he said how god being back in spirit was manifested in the flesh and took on the human form and of man to become kin folks to the human race he said to know what suffering means and to know what sickness means and what temptation means he said god become a man to become kin folks to redeem man back to himself he said oh if you can only see that you sinner tonight it will merit he said it ought to melt your heart and so you and i as believers we've seen that we've seen what god did for you and i that he come down he became flesh so that he could feel and go through the things that you and i go through ephesians 2 and 13 it says but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were afar off made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace which hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us he said see god back yonder being holy when he walked with moses as a pillar of fire on top of the mountain if any man touched that mountain he must be killed he said it was god trying to get into man's heart and you know if you look down through the scripture it was god above us god with us and then god in us it was god above us in the pillar of fire speaking there with moses it was god with us in jesus christ and then it's god in us in the form of the holy ghost is that right god did not change the power did not change nothing changed other than the distance or the form that god was in is that right and so you and i as being joint heirs with christ means that everything that christ was entitled to when it was god with us now being god in us everything that jesus had all that power you and i have access to the authority to act on that power is that right do we understand that this mor this evening the next thing god did was manifested in flesh in christ and he said god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and and he was born a man here made kin folks he said in order to pay the price of redemption he said then he was killed there in order for his spirit might be set free to come back in the form of the holy spirit and he said all that god was he emptied into christ and he said all the great eternals of god was emptied into christ and he said all that christ was he emptied into the church and he said and men and women are afraid to claim their god-given given privileges and stand upon the truth of it and i say today you and i we have the the duty to recognize who we are as the prodigal son recognized who he was in the pigpen as his brother recognized who he was even though he stayed at home he did everything right he was living below his privileges and so remember the title of the of the of the sermon is all he has and so i want you to know this evening all that god has he's given you access to it amen if you're if you're living below your if your spiritual life's not where it needs to be it's not the pastor's fault it's not god's fault he's given you everything that he has it's your it's on you and it's on your duty and so you know it's amazing to me we don't like to hear that it's our responsibility right i would love for it to be brother ben's responsibility for my spiritual walk it'd be much easier on me if he had to study if he had to do all the praying if he had to do the late nights laying in bed thinking and wondering god well you know god am i doing this right am i doing this right as a father as a leader am i doing this right but unfortunately it's not up to him he has his part to play in it as a pastor he has to bring the word and lead and guide us and as a lay member here i've put my trust that god has called him to do that and i will follow him as he follows christ is that right but it's not up to him as my spiritual walk with christ if it's good or if it's bad it's up to you and it's up to me right and so if you're living below your privilege this evening i want you to know you can live a little bit higher you can be a little bit happier you know i've always disbelieved the the the thought and the message that we should be uh people sometimes confuse humbleness with sadness yeah sure right we feel like we gotta be humble but some people just interpret that as sad yeah right that's not what it means to be humble sometimes when we get humbled we get sad right when i was humbled i got sad i was like man this is terrible i don't feel good about this you know everybody no matter who we are we like an atta boy we like a pat on the back everybody as much as i say i don't care what people think i can preach until i'm blue in the face i still care what people think i can't help but we're all human is that right let's just preach just a little bit for a few minutes tonight we're all human we care what other people think but when it comes to what you think and what god thinks guess who's that guess who's what i'm worried about gods i'm not worried about your opinion anymore after that if your opinion says well you ought to do this but god's word says you ought to do that i'm going to do what god's word says is that right so we ought never be caught between two opinions that we ought to do this or we ought to do that but we've got to find the word of god and it's got to be our anchor is that right it's got to be our our tie post that we can go back to and we can have something to go to now when i was in dallas last week and i know my time's about up and i was in dallas last week and i was talking to a young man that had lost a child at a very young age he was a nominal christian but you know he was telling me how you know how most people go through divorces at that they lost a little two-year-old in a car wreck and i was just i was just amazed by his faith it was you know probably greater than mine and he never heard of the message and or maybe that i know of that he hadn't and and so you know just listen but i said you know i'm so glad we have a hope yeah you know and i begin to think about that and study you know i wonder why the world's so crazy and why people are just just throwing out things that loose ends it's because they don't have a hope but you and i we have a hope that is sure and that is solid it's a foundation that we know is tried and true and so as believers we have such a blessing or we're so blessed that we have a hope that we can go back to and know that it's a sure thing is that right yes you know my timer went off but i'm just going to read this quote and then i'll be done and it says a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you i'll be in you even to the end of the world he says christ the same yesterday today and forever your kinsmen redeemer said god himself made flesh here on earth to take away the sins and clean out of all the way he says that he might have fellowship again with his creature and you know when i begin to look through this and musicians if you want to go ahead and come as we as we go ahead and begin to close but i begin to look at this and and i begin to study what brother branham talks about you know when he talks about the fall the whole story of redemption is so god can have fellowship with his people again you know it kind of made me feel really bad how i act sometimes at church because god whole plan was to have fellowship with me again fellowship with you and i again and sometimes i come to church and maybe i don't give it my all give it as much as i should whenever i whenever maybe we're singing or we're worshiping or the minister's preaching maybe trying to stay in tune with that and and it's hard i know what i know it's difficult but i think we ought to try and go just that extra little step as we see the end approaching we ought to join ourselves together more as that day approaches and and if you ask me about my schedule right now i don't want anybody to touch my schedule right yeah we all a little bit that way we've got we've got our life planned out and we've got all these things that's got to happen and you know i think if there's anything that should trump what's on our schedule i think it should be it should be god and for him to come back and and and give me all that he has ought to give him all that i've got and you know i begin to look at that and begin to think you know he's given me everything have i given him everything and so when i begin to look at my life and it's not that i'm giving him not giving him bad things or this but maybe even the things that i just can consume my time or or that i maybe think about or ought not to do or or this am i giving him everything because he's given me everything and i think as as as believers i begin to study this and listen to brother brain i'm talking about making ourselves ready i begin to think you know i haven't given what god has given i haven't done justice to what he's done and i'm beginning to think what i should be doing to make myself ready and you know we've come into this union with christ and we we've come to this point to where we know that the end is near i don't think there's hardly most of the nominal christians that i work with are like we didn't believe in the rapture a few years ago but we're believing in it now like this can't continue on they they know that they see it they feel the the pressing end of the age and i don't know if it's going to be one day 10 years 100 years i don't know what it's going to be but we know that the end is near if you look at the scripture you can see everything that is happening now and you look at what they're calling for in government what everybody's wanting to do you can see and feel that the end is near and so as that day approaches we ought to join ourselves together all that much the more and so if i could say anything tonight as i would just play something softly you know god has given us all that he has we ought to give him all that we have back if god's if god's given me every spiritual blessing and he's given me me given me all the rights to everything that lays in his word and he's given me the power to cast out demons the power to cast out sickness the power to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover then ought to give him my faith to believe that when he says i can do it i can do it and it's not by my might or not by my power but it's by his spirit that i know that what god says i know that it'll come to pass because it's a truth and it's a foundation that i know is true do you love the lord this evening maybe if we just bow our heads as we would pray maybe if you just have a need this evening that's on your heart if you just want to make it known while no one's looking around just make it known by the upliftion of your hand god we just come before you this evening lord i know it's just a little a little message and it was chopped up but lord first of all i just want to thank you for giving us all that you have lord i pray that i can lord that we can just dedicate our lives solely to you and lord maybe there's maybe some that went home that are listening in and god i pray you just give them a special touch this evening or we've got some that or there's some young people lord i know that wanting to be baptized god i pray you just set us on fire lord that the young people would see something in us that they would want to live like that lord that they would see us sincerely god i pray you would make me more sincere and more dedicated but i know what the business busyness of life lord things maybe i've let things creep in and things that consume my time but god i pray you just just bring me back to what what's important and what matters most lord that all that i have lord that i can give to you lord if there's some setting here tonight lord that have gifts they have things they have more that they could give to you god i pray lord you would send a fire and a desire lord for them to give that back to you and to use it the way that you would see fit god i pray for us for the people this evening lord for being attentive and just i pray for the mothers lord you would just give them a special blessing on this day and lord not just today but every day whereas the pastor spoke this morning that as they would raise the future generations god that they would put you at the
