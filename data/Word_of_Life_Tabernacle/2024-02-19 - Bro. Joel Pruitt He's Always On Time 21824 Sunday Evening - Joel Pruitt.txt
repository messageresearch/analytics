you feel tonight there's nobody like Jesus amen if you got your Bibles with you it's good to be with you this evening me how many enjoy the sermon this morning me wasn't that wonderful and uh tell you what my brother really out did himself kind made me proud I tease on tease him so much I got to tell you when he did good he did a good job this morning I enjoyed it I was blessed and I'm sure you were as well if you have your Bibles John 11 verse 21 I feel like I'm a little loud if if I'm blaring somebody out I apologize well Heaven 21 and 22 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou Wilt ask God God will give it thee and you may have your seats this evening and I I would like to if I could title a sermon tonight I would call it he is always on time and I do believe he's always on time how about you and so I was reading this here and and and you know they receive the news of of Lazarus Jesus receives the news of Lazarus dying and and uh he he you know it's his friend and he uh and he couldn't go you know he moved in he was moving in with uh Mary Martha and Lazarus he went to live with him brother bandam said and and then the ministry had called him away and then he received word that that Lazarus was sick and and so he he goes he he wants to go to his friend but he can't go just right away and and and then when he finally gets there she saidwell Lord if you had been here he wouldn't have been dead you know why cuz where Jesus is death has no rights but but Jesus wasn't there and so he dies and he said I'm glad for your sakes that I wasn't here and it looks like it was a real dark time don't you think so because you know you would think if he was sick well sure he can get healed but now he's dead and now he's not just dead one days two days three days but no he's dead brother R said corruption has set in his nose is already s in it's a bad situation I would say that it might be worse than about any situation you've been in before but when Jesus showed up he proved that there was a resurrection power in him can you say Amen so Jesus gets there and and and and he and he as a friend brother Bram said he would weep like a man he would grieve for his friend but when he gets to the grave of Lazarus he shows up and says he he says he says Lazarus come forth and the body that was ate up with skin worms had to had to had to come to life why because death knew its Master death couldn't hold him no longer why because God had spoke and when God speaks anything you can rest your soul on it that it will take place God cannot the the word can't lie and if he could do it for Lazarus he could do it for anybody but you'll see that Jesus he he goes on down here and he says uh he let me get on back to my place here he said he said when he went down he said he went to wake him he said they took Lazarus out and he had an embal they had embalmed his body I mean when you say when it's embalmed it's too far gone wouldn't you say so and just too far gone brother Joe he' agree with that if the if the body's in bombed we probably ain't going down to lay hands on them but but this one here was a different case why because Jesus was there and the point I want to drive home today is Jesus is still here well Jesus's body may not be but it is his hands are yours his feet are yours his voice is yours Jesus is still here and he's he's talking about the skin worms developed he said all hopes was gone it was The Darkest Hour the little family had ever seen he said did you ever hit that hour somebody's been there today somebody's been in a bad situation somebody's been so far gone they didn't think they'd ever come back but Jesus came along and when Jesus shows up I don't care how dark it is he is the light of the world all hopes was gone he said I've hit that in our home loved ones be taken away in darkness Darkest Hour of the little family had ever seen and then Jesus come along he usually comes when it's the darkest hour can you say Amen to that brother B said I remember the darkest hour I ever seen when I was laying Yonder and May's brother's hospital he said the doctors looked at me and said there's not an Earthly chance for you to ever be well he said two years ago said you broke yourself and your whole nervous system is is is gone he said you can't keep nothing on your stomach you never will said you're finished for life and he said there was tears rolling down down my cheeks knowing that my life was ending like that and he said I looked up and said father and about that time Jesus come along how many's ever felt that that before he said Jesus come along and he said well my he comes right at the darkest of ours he said it was the darkest of ours that the woman with the blood issue had ever seen she had spent all of her money and then Jesus come along well there is a great physician you can spend money at Mayo Clinic you can spend Mayo at the local hospital or doctor and God uses them but when it's too far gone for the doctor Jesus can show up amen well can you say amen he said and he said there was another set he said The Darkest Hour was meach Shadrach isach and Abednego he said it was The Darkest Hour they'd ever seen they were literally put into the fire that's a pretty dark hour they were literally in the fire but then a fourth man came along he said that was like un to the Son of God I believe that when Jesus shows up you say what my Situation's out of control Just Let Jesus show up one time why do we need him in our services why do we need him in our homes why do we need him when we're driving down the road because the darkest hour could be just like that but you need Jesus in the room if there's whatever a Time the world needed Jesus it's now when gross darkness is on the earth and and there's a time of insanity all around us and it looks like people are just falling farther and farther from truth I believe there's a little group of people have come in contact with Jesus you say well where is Jesus today well that's what I'd like to tell you now Jesus is his word Christ is his word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and then it was made flesh and dwelt among us and then when he went away he sent his Spirit back on the church church and that's what we have today and brother BR said the mechanics and Dynamics were here he said the mechanics the word and the spirit are here we don't have to wait on something to come it is here that's why we don't have to be scared in the darkest hour we don't have to go around and and feel like we're in a graveyard in the dark you know what it is it we don't have to be that way we don't have to wonder when Jesus is coming we we know he's coming and we're just going to live like he's coming every day let's not be scared about it let's let's just live like he's coming today let's live like he's coming tomorrow when you wake up I know he's coming I want to just walk as close as I can to the way he said it in his word oh yeah he said there was another Dark Hour he said he said uh he said when Jesus come along gyrus had a had a daughter she was 12 years old and she was already dead and then Jesus come along he said it was the darkest to Old blind barus had ever seen down there then Jesus come along he's always there at the darkest of hours I would like to tell you he's always always on time it looks like he's late it looks like there's no hope but Jesus is on time he's never missed an appointment brother random said he's never been late to an appointment he's always showed up just when he knows he's got to show up it looks like Jesus didn't come when he was told to by his friends well we wish you to come when we called you because then you you could have saved our brother we wish You' have showed up just before the situation got this bad but now I know there's no hope but just when your situation looks like it's too far gone that's when he shows up when you can't do it on your own and you need help the helper shows up well come on somebody has anybody ever been in a struggle before has anybody ever been in a valley so deep you can't see the mountain tops no more has anybody ever felt like you just want to give up God will show up in those times when it looks like you backsliding so far that that there's no way back and you've done things that you just can't you can't be forgiven of there is a way back repent and come back to God and he's always there to meet you the prodigal son comes home and he didn't have to come home and say you know I I'm one of your sons I I've been out there in the pig pin I've been pretty bad off but don't you remember me no the father was waiting he was already ready and waiting because it was a bad time and he knew that son could only go so far before he had to come home he knew he could only well you can't last too long out there he knew the funds would run out eventually and so when your money's run out and when your time looks like it's about to be cut short because you're maybe you're out of the will of God or you're doing things you shouldn't do I I know there's a way back why because I've experienced the way back and I know some people sitting here today have experienced a way back you you've gotten away from God at times but you found a way home again and that's what I want to encourage you today that when your darkest time comes Jesus will come on the scene and Jesus will show up not when you want him but when he knows he's got to be there because he's not going to lose you he's not going to lose your children why because he's always on time we don't have to worry about is he going to come when we want him did you invite him to the service this evening then he's here but if you've got a situation that you can't handle I know somebody who can when you can't handle it anymore that's the perfect time for him to show up if you can handle it you don't need him but when The Sinner when the world was so lost that there was no way back the Lambs wasn't going to work no more the goats wouldn't work no more there was no no kind of thing that would work anymore but then God had to send his son in the darkest time the world had ever seen and then there was another time the darkest world the darkest time the world had ever seen we were in an age and and it was almost complete darkness over the church and there was no more spirit in the church and then and guess what God sent a light in this age he sent a messenger just when it looked like there was nobody left to believe it and there had to be raised up somebody in this age why because there was a promise of a Rapture and there had to be somebody to believe it somebody that could live it somebody that could take the word in his fullness and make Jesus Christ Al again you can't you can't say we're we're just put here by chance no God had us here at a specific time and a specific purpose for a for a reason and the reason we're here is because somebody had to be a light in a dark time Jesus had to show up on time oh yeah the message had to come when it did on time it couldn't have come earlier and it couldn't have come later it came exactly when God wanted it that should give us hope of a Rapture and a future because the messenger comes right before all that takes place you say well we might have another seven Church ages no the final Church age has come and I believe we're now in the bright age to where all things are coming together for a Rapture oh thank you Lord brother B talks about here he said he said when Jesus had died the people were in a a state they didn't know what to do he had already told them what was fixing to happen but they didn't know why because a lot of times we hear the word but we don't don't apply it to the situation we're in because it just looks too bad he said there was a couple of name of Copus and so forth they was on the road to EMAs yeah they were going along sadhe hearted broken they were going along talking about oh how bad it was and all of a sudden someone stepped out of the bushes an ordinary man not with any with his collar turned around or any different dressing he dressed like the rest of the man he wore his hair and his beard just like the rest of them did he wasn't any different he didn't make any great different in his life didn't have Pro didn't have a didn't prove his credentials he said he wore his hair and his beard just like the rest of them did and he said he wasn't any different he didn't make any great difference there he said he he said what he did he said and that's what God wants us to be is wants our life to be our credentials that's right and he said when he began to walk along he said Brethren why are you so sad why why are you having this conversation he said oh I just love that he said there he said why why are you around here and they said why are you a stranger hanging around here he wasn't even recognized among them and he said oh I just love that he said well he he said he said the whole country is tore up and and said we're on a road going back home he said Jesus of Nazareth the prophet we thought surely he would when he come he would be the king of Israel and now he's dead and and they buried him and they they pierced him in the heart and they put him away and said even this the even this is the third day since it all happened and and he was put to death and said some women was down at the grave and seen a vision of angels and come back and and said he was alive I I I heard that and I thought well a lot of people say well a prophet thought he went behind the curtain of time and thought he saw this and thought he saw that they questioned it they doubt it really happened but we know it did happen and here he is standing there listening to their complaints about how bad it was because we've lost Jesus can't hear no more and he's standing there in the flesh he said now look how beautifully he said look at this Christ amongst the sad and brokenhearted that's where he comes and he said that's where he goes the sad and the Brokenhearted they were going along in the darkest tower that they ever ever had seen all their hopes was gone they' been put out of the church the synagogues because they believed on him and he said uh and who they had trusted was dead and some some women had come around a little story about some visions and they had seen some angels and tell his disciples that he would meet them in Galilee but he said oh they couldn't believe that they were brokenhearted and and sad and and crying and the lovely Jesus appears to the Brokenhearted and then he had to tell them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken don't you see that the scriptures are being revealed in front of you I wonder if I could ask you today do you see the scriptures being revealed right in front of you you don't have to be sad no more you don't have to worry no more because Christ has come back Among Us he oh come on Church he is living now among his people in the flesh again it's your flesh and my flesh where Christ is living now we don't have to worry no more there's no reason to be sad no more why because Jesus has appeared just on time there's another situation I'm going to hurry tonight I promise I won't hold you long brother Bill told me he said you can preach as long as you want to but when you see me walk out it's been too long I'm watching you buddy you leave leave I'm stopping First Kings 17 goes like this verse 10 1 Kings 17:10 said Elijah he arose and went down to zerath and when he came to the gate of the city there was a widow was gathering sticks and he called her and said fetch me I pray the a little water in a vessel that I may drink and I'd like you to notice the spirit of Elijah there and the spirit of Elijah on our Elijah who would go down by the spirit of the Lord and would see a little woman at the gate oh come on somebody if you can't see what we've got in this hour then I don't know what to tell you but if there is a calling on the inside of you to know that this message is correct when the word struck your heart nobody can talk you out of it and and and I'm telling you this woman here had went through hardship her food was about gone and he goes down verse 12 there if you can and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but I have a handful of meal and a barrel and an oil and a cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son we're going to eat it we're going to die come on now there's no more hope it's all over we're going to eat our spirit our our natural food and we're gone and here's the prophet who was told to go down there and ask for food and he goes and ask for it and Elijah said unto her fear not yes fear not because he said he said go and do as thou Hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son now I want you to notice here she could have went and done what was best for her come on come on somebody she could have went and did exactly what would save her son and her for another day or two but what she needed to do was obey the word of the Lord by the prophet of God she had never met the man maybe maybe she never saw a miracle done by this man but he could stand there and tell her something and something on the inside of this woman decided it was better to obey and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days God can take a a situation that looks like there's not a bit of food left in your I tell you what there's not a dollar left in your bank account there's no food in the cupboard anymore but God has not is not going to let you sit there and starve being in the will of God he his children don't beg for bread his seed don't beg for bread you you don't have to worry about it give it to Jesus he said and it came to pass after these things he said that the son of the woman fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him so now she'd already been through one situation and she had watched God move in one situation and now here comes another one now he was he survived I listened to the word of the Lord and I made it through a trial and here's another trial and and and so they get into the other trial and and now her son's dead first it was just about to be starvation now he's gone now what's she going to do she's got to believe the same word by the same source and and that's the only way we can do today Church you may get in a bad situation but if he brought you this far he can bring you through a worse trial and he'll bring you out on the other side every time and so he gets there and Elijah said what have I to do with thee Oh or she said what unto Elijah what have I to do with thee oh man of God Art Thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom now I want to go back verse 18 I want you to notice it's not always your sin that's making you go through a trial are you going to tell me about my sin and how bad I've been no that's not what he was coming to do just give me the child give me your situation quit looking back at your past look to God and give him your troubles and she said unto Elijah what have I to do with thee and he goes on in verse 19 and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he Abode and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord my God hast thou all also brought evil upon the Widow with whom I sojourned by slaying her son and he stretched himself unto the child three times and cried to the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray thee let this child's Soul come into again and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived it's a bad situation but God showed up right it's a situation I would say none of us have been in but God showed up I I don't want you to look at your situation tonight because you've never been in a situation like that you've never well come on somebody if your children are still living they've still got a chance to walk in them doors right now and come back to the Lord if it looks like you can't get over this struggle in your life if you're still sitting here in church and there's a possibility of an overcoming life when you're gone you say well how do you get save then well I I I listen Church don't ever give up hope this son was dead and he still come back Lazarus was dead he still come back I I don't care what's happened I don't care how bad it's been just call Jesus on the scene he will show up right on time sir verse 24 and the woman sent Elijah now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the Lord is in my m in thy mouth is truth all that other time she had to take him at his word without even knowing it was true you didn't know this message was true when you first heard it but something in you said I better listen to that and time after time you've overcome something why because the message is not a fairy tale it is not a lie it is not for 1947 or 1965 it is for today it is for you and me just the same as it was for a Prophet this message did not die in 1965 and it is not coming up again right before the Rapture the message is here and it is alive right now brother R talks about the woman in Memphis and he said he was going along down there and his plane had got stalled you realize your bad situation could be God working on both ends and God had stopped him there at the plane in Memphis and and then he has to go go down and he's he's humming and I think one of them or something like that and he's humming down and he and he's going down into the the Lord said just keep on walking and he goes into a part of Memphis and I've been told it's where the Bass Pro pyramid sits now in that part of Memphis but I don't know that to be facts but I'm sure the people that like Bass Pro would like that to be true and he's going down there and and he and he and and he and he finds this little house and he sees this woman laying out and this woman knew who was coming before he come so now God had stopped the plane and now here's a prophet walking down the road and sees he said a typical antama woman standing out there and he said she's leaning over the gate and said good morning Parson why because she knew he was coming do you realize that God can speak to you and your situation personally you I need a word from the Lord he can speak to you personally he told a woman who may have never been in church to look for a man wearing a certain color hat do you realize God can speak to you like that God knows your situation and he's not going to leave you in that situation if you call on his name brother bam said he knew this woman was a prayer Warrior he goes into her house and he sees she's got a boy laying there who who was certain to death he was about to die and and and she's laying there and and it wasn't so much for his his health to come back but but but she prayed for this boy and he got out and he got in a got a bad disease and now he's going to die without the Lord she wanted him to be saved that's what we want for our children I'm not so worried about you know if they get down to where they're going to die Lord I want them back but I'm going to tell you this I want their souls to be saved more than anything and this woman she had a desire on her heart she didn't say I want him raised up so he can keep living like he's living no I want my boy to be saved I want my boy to be an overcomer and brother brandom said he let her pray and he said there's a woman who had talked to God before well I wonder sometimes if if our children ever hear us talk to God like that and that gives them a hope to say you know what Mama Prayed for me I'm in a bad situation daddy prayed for me I may be in a bad situation but there there's a prayer somewhere that touched heaven and this little woman here may may not have known much but he she said I'm like that shite woman I'm just like that where's my Elijah and God showed me that you're my Elijah and so her Elijah shows up just like the Elijah in the Bible and then this boy here was about to die and she's praying and and brother bandam said that you know he said it's getting dark it's getting darker in the room oh I'm telling you I'd like to tell you today when the darkness comes that's when Jes Jesus shows up well I don't know how else and how more plain to put it some of you are sitting there saying my Situation's too bad Let Jesus show up one time he is the light you need in your darkest to your Situation's not too bad your situation ain't even the worst one that the Bible's ever talked about you want to talk about Jonah and whales belly brother BR said symptoms he had symptoms you want to talk about a situation he was in a bad situation and and you know the cartoons when I was a kid they showed Jonah in this whales belly and it looked like a cathedral in there you had rib cages over here and rib cages in a spine have you ever cut open a fish before does it look like that I would imagine he's in there all squeezed up in the guts and the blood and whatever else that whale or fish had ate and he has to find a way to turn to where he can pray right and he gets himself just in a situation where he believes he's facing the right direction sir well come on somebody sir he believes he's facing the right direction and then he's praying Lord help your stupid servant I feel that way every time I come out to preach Lord help your stupid servant I need your help I'm not getting out of this whales belly alone well what did he do he showed up just on time and work the situation out for his good and for his glory and I want you to know tonight that every situation you've ever been in is for the good of you and God he is working your situation out on both ends he oh come on somebody he doesn't want you to be down and wear a frown when you're having a bad time he doesn't want you to get yourself in such a situation that you can't be free in church no more well I tell you this all the time I'm going to tell you again God does not want you to sit there and feel like you're in chain no more because you've already been set free come on somebody you've already been free to worship you've already been freed from the W's belly you've already been freed from Death resurrection power is in you You' just got to accept it if Lazarus would have got up and said you know what I don't feel like waking up today what a bad situation that would have been when the Lord comes by your way accept what he's offering you it may not be what you want it may not be how you want it but it will be what you need exactly on time brother R said this woman here he said she got you know he talks about that woman that and he said he met that boy a couple years later down there in Memphis a little boy come up to him and said Not only am I healed but I'm saved too see The Darkest Hour looked pretty bad for the mama she just wanted a salvation but did you see what happened he not only saves but he heals he can restore and I know he can keep you children you don't have to go out in the world and have that kind of testimony come on somebody you you don't have to go out and be like well look what I did I overcome drugs and I overcome this and I overcome that you don't have to have that testimony your testimony can be I was raised in church and I found God on the front row and I was able to go to an altar one day and God saved me and God kept me and God well come on somebody you don't have to go out of the church to have a testimony the greatest testimony when you get over there and tell your friends you're going to say you know what I live through Lea there was all kinds of of of of devils all around there was all kinds of demons trying to torment me trying to Temp me but I overcame them all why because Jesus was in my boat he he doesn't want you to worry that's the thing because he's always ready to come when the situation is completely out of your control he's got it in control you might be able to manage a situation you might be able to get yourself through a certain part of life on your own and you might be like well I can do this and I can do that on my own yeah you can do a lot on your own but there's going to come a time that you've got to have Jesus and I think you need to know what it's like to call him on the scene sometimes I think we need to I think we need to know what it's like to feel his presence again because then when his presence comes you can say Lord The Situation's gotten out of control four days ago it have been nice if you have showed up but it's too far gone now but even now speak the word even now Lazarus can come forth and if a dead man can raise after 4 days your situation is not too far gone if if God can take a little meal and a little oil and make it last days after supposed to lasted one meal then God can take care of your situation but we get too much in a hurry and we get impatient with God we start saying God I want it my way I want it now I need it right now but God says just wait it ain't over yet I'm coming but it ain't over yet wait till the story has been written wait till the story's been written wait till it's all over judge nothing before it's time just wait till the other other side of your trial and you're going to look back as a blessing to you it was a trial it looked like I couldn't make it but look I made it by the grace of God it looked like my child went too far but I made it by the grace of God why because God shows up on time Jesus keeps all his appointments Jesus never left you in a situation that he couldn't get you out of that's he left you in situations you couldn't get out of that's right that's right well I can't make it on my own no you can't make it on your own but he can well I I I just don't even know if do I even have the Holy Ghost well I tell you there's a way to get the Holy Ghost I'm glad you ask all you got to do is repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and believe for it believe for it well come on somebody just believe for it and Jesus will show up on time come on well why have I waited 20 years on time he'll be there why Abraham well why have I waited on time he'll be there I heard brother I heard brother Homer say this the other day I shouldn't repeat in the bullpit probably but he said Sarah had every right to doubt he said because 10 years in Abraham come in there all dancing and happy and said how you feeling today Sarah and she said I wish you'd just go away come on you ever felt that way somebody comes into the house of God and you've had a bad day and they're shouting and dancing and you're sitting there I wish they'd sit down and shut up they need to be miserable with me come on that was free I'd heard brother Homer the other night and I've got those things running through my head right now but you know what there's a lot of Truth to that we don't always feel like the blessings of God are coming down we don't always feel like we're Children of the promise we don't always feel like a Joshua generation we don't always feel like a spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ we don't always feel that way because the flesh has feelings and it's not always good but there's more to it than how you feel there's more to it than the way you oh come on somebody there's more to it than just coming to church and feeling good but there is a word here that will change your situation when you come and sit in a service like this morning and the word is going forth you say well nobody run the aisles this morning let me just go ahead and tell you nobody needed to run the aisles to get a blessing this morning all you had to do is listen to the word of God when you go turn on a tape driving down the road there's a lot of times you probably ain't dancing while you're driving but did you know there could be a blessing right there that could change your Eternal destination there could be a word come off that tape that could tell you something that you've had a question about for years I I want you to hear me tonight church God doesn't come when you want him to but he is always going to be on time he doesn't come when when you say well I need a good service to feel better God knows what you need in that service and God's here to give you what you need in that service well I need a blessing today so Lord I need the song leader to be on I need the preacher to really be hyped today God will give you what you have need of he might be working patience in your life ask a preacher or a song leader how that feels when he's working on them you feel you're like what am I going to say as brother Danny's teing Lord what do you want me to say yeah I'll say it like this I think God's always going to show up when he's I I know God's always going to show up when he's needed oh yes not always when you feel like you need him Lord I just need your help he's there to help you but I'm talking about a dire situation when there's no hope there's no way out on your own I just can't go any farther right brother Bill was telling me he said I just didn't feel like you know I just can't walk hardly around Walmart no more well I'll tell you he don't he don't have to be like that God can heal him just like that but you know what in that trial God's going to make a blessing out of it one way or the other in your situation God is going to show up and do whatever he thinks is best for you right it's not always what's Best in our own minds that's right but I put this together tonight and I a couple days ago I was sitting there and I thought you know what every time I feel like I just can't do it on my own somebody's got to help me yeah and then I got to thinking about I just started going through stories in the Bible who has God helped when there seemed like there was no help left and there's a whole lot of them I've named a few of them here tonight there's Lazarus it's a pretty bad situ situation there was Jonah it's a pretty bad situation you been swallowed by a fish come back and tell me how that happened pretty bad three Hebrew children that's a really bad situation Jesus never left his children in a situation that he didn't bring him out of that's right he he won't do it for you either you think brother brandom said he's not an unjust God he is not going to do one thing for one person and another thing for somebody else well everything has fell apart in my life God will show up exactly when he's needed to show up well he didn't leave you know when they were standing there at the Red Sea I'm almost done I told Brother Bill 30 minutes I'm about seven minutes over I apologize you're doing all right thank you buddy he he said he said he would you know when they get to the they get to the Red Sea down there and the people started getting in a panic you brought us out of Egypt we saw your signs we saw what your Prophet could do and now you going to leave us out here to die no God never left his people but let him get down there and he let him see Pharaoh's Army coming he let you see something coming in your life that you couldn't control because he wanted to see if you would call out to God and these people know they were probably saying Lord help us and Moses would you please help us get us out of this situation because they're going to come and kill us but did you see God had the situation already planned out in his mind and knew exactly the way it was going to happen God knew the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end he knew all of it before it ever happened and God looked down there and knew that they could be across that Red Sea before Pharaoh's Army ever showed up oh thank you Lord how by the by the by the tender hand of Jehovah as we've heard so many times by the tender hand of God he can come to your situation and change the circumstances even here tonight we don't have to wait on a Prophet come on somebody we don't have to wait on another word from the Lord we don't have to wait on Prophecy to come forth the word has come and the word says you're an overcomer the word says you are the bride the word says that if he did it for one he can do it again and the word says he will not leave you without a comforter well come on somebody the word has already come and made himself manifest Among Us and the word is always right and the word is always on time well why wasn't the seals opened earlier well because God didn't have his man in place God didn't have it to be opened earlier God had a specific time and a specific place and he's got a time and place for you he's got a time and I tell you well why was I in this church why was I in that church I don't know myself but God knew why I was there there might have been some rough edges he needed to get off of you he needed to change your thinking about some things he maybe he wanted to ground you in a certain way well do you realize that everything that's happening is for your good everything the bad stuff is for your good sir if you're a child of God well I'm not a child of God well if you're not a child of God then I guess why are you here but see I don't even believe that why would you sit on a 3:00 service if you're not come on why would you come out here and hear me if you wasn't a child of God I wouldn't I may not even if I was even if I am though I am you realize that God wanted you here for a purpose amen come I don't know why you know sometimes we say things and we're like well who is it for what's it for for I don't know your situation I don't need to know your situation but I do know when the Lord gives you something you got to preach it when the Lord tells you say something it might change somebody's Eternal destination it might change somebody's way I'll tell you what there's been people that may have been sitting in the audience and thought healing is not mine no more and they've given up and then they go to church and they hear something from God not from man if you're coming here expecting something from your pastor or brother steuart and you're expecting something to be just what a man can tell you to make you feel better a man can tell you to change your outcome of your life no we can't do anything to help you in that way but when God comes and speaks through a person it can change the situation completely God CH God God uses men God always has used men and God always will use men until we're out of here God's going to use a man to tell you right God's going to use a man to preach At You Preach to you God's going to use a man to tell you what the word would say and hey I tell you I'm just here to encourage you tonight I didn't come come here to try to revelate you I know these afternoon services are tough but I want to tell you this God's got your situation in control well I need you know I need this and I need that what you need is to get out on your knees and cry out to God say Lord help my situation and you say well I I did that but I didn't get an immediate response well just let him come in let him let him do it in his own good time let him do it when he chooses to show up we don't have have to worry about anything because he's got it all in control Lord Brother Brandon we're talking about this woman and there was a love for that little woman for her son she went over and stroked his head and kissed him and said God bless momy's baby great big fellow like that dying in shame and sin and yet that Mother's Love went he was still a baby still her baby no matter how much disgraced he was and how disgraced the family it was still that love of the mother that went out for a baby he said I think of that sometimes and think if a mother could forget her suckling babe God said I can't forget you your names are engraved on the palms of my hands how many believes that tonight he said he he said remember you can't get away from it well that's that's good right there you can't even run from it God knows he said he still loves you and that's why you're here tonight he's trying to give you another chance knocking at your door my he said I got down on the floor and he prayed with her and he said it seemed like that cold sticky certainly death was on the boy and said' Annie being that you are the mother of the boy won't you pray first and that's when I told you she was a Praying Woman brother B said she was a Praying Woman but he gets on down there he said and when he prayed he said he put his hands on his feet and said Lord I don't know what he said I don't know what to say he said is this why you made me miss my airplane to come down here to pray for This Woman's boy if it is oh Lord let it be known that you're God and you'll respect her prayers and her sincerity and about that time that big fell said oh Mom that it's getting light in the room now I wonder sometimes if we come with a sincere heart and we come back to God and you know it may look like we were in a bad situation and it's been Darkness after darkness and trial after trial and we can say mama it's getting light in the room now I can see daylight again why because God showed up just on time God has come to put light on your situation in an age of total darkness I think it's time that we are not no longer the children of Darkness but we are the children of light we are not walking in darkness but there is a light that has been shown in this age we don't have to worry about the way the ages have went before us and how their Messengers would only go so far and stop no the completion of the word has been restored to the church God has restored all things to us we have need of nothing but we have need of Jesus to show up and reveal what's already been brought to us musicians come I got 22 seconds and I'm done I'm on time God will show up in your situation thank you Lord but brother brandham said he said he needs you to be sincere and he said when that woman was sincere that's when God would respect her prayers thank you Lord God will respect your prayers if you're sincere God will respect your prayers if you'll just give him oh yeah first place in your life I want us to stand together I stayed on time tonight but I want to tell you this I I want just for a few moments I want to take this opportunity if you can play something if you want to I I want to take this opportunity to ask how many every head bowed every eye closed I want to ask you have you been in a situation or are you in a situation that you don't feel you can get out [Music] of if you are where is Jesus today he's right here you say well he hasn't come when I've called him before have you called him sincerely have you said Lord I need I just need more of you I my children need to be saved my my family they're in turmoil my life my job whatever it is whatever your situation is it's not too big for God to come on the scene and change it tonight with no one looking around if you're in a situation that you need prayer tonight I want you to raise your hand I want
