[14:03] is something you can't just take a pill
[14:05] for and get over it it's it's there and
[14:07] but we have a God who still heals it and
[14:10] he heals any virus or anything that the

[14:53] we come to you as a body of Believers
[14:55] today and Lord you said we're two or
[14:57] three are gathered together in your name

[15:21] Lord even at home that are sick I pray
[15:23] God that you would just move where
[15:24] they're at today and may the spirit that
[15:26] we feel here go down where they're at

[15:40] sicknesses come and go Lord we know
[15:42] you're still the Healer we know you're

[16:22] building your new creation within us
[16:24] thank you for that we ask these things
[16:26] in your precious name amen amen God
[16:29] bless you turn with me to acts
[16:33] 7:44 kind of a a little bit different
[16:36] sermon for a Christmas
[16:39] message but maybe you'll see how it
[16:42] goes after a little while Acts chapter 7
[16:44] and verse
[16:49] 44 you bear with us many are are
[16:52] streaming this morning and we had a
[16:53] little hiccup with that and we've had to
[16:55] unplug everything plug everything back
[16:57] in and and so just bear with us if it's
[16:59] not exactly what it should be it will be
[17:01] before before very long it's just trial
[17:03] and error getting it back set back up
[17:06] Acts chapter 7 and verse 44 our fathers
[17:09] had the Tabernacle of witness in the
[17:11] wilderness as he hath appointed speaking
[17:14] unto Moses that he
[17:16] should that he should make it according
[17:19] to the fashion that he had
[17:21] seen which also our fathers that came
[17:23] after brought in with Jesus into the
[17:25] possession of the Gentiles that Jesus is
[17:28] Josh UA into the possession of the
[17:30] Gentiles whom God drave out before the
[17:32] face of our fathers unto the days of
[17:35] David who found favor before God and
[17:37] desired to find a tabernacle for the god
[17:39] of Jacob but Solomon built him a house
[17:43] how Beth the most high dwelleth not in
[17:45] temples made with hands I sayeth the
[17:47] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[17:50] my foot stol what house will you build
[17:53] me sayeth the Lord what is the place of
[17:56] my rest I pray the Lord would add his
[17:58] Blessing to to the word you may be
[17:59] seated this
[18:05] morning you can judge the kind of a
[18:08] house that a man will build on what kind
[18:10] of a man that he is or what kind of a
[18:12] family they are if you don't have much
[18:15] money you don't build much of a
[18:17] house unless you just have have the
[18:19] ability to borrow a lot of money but
[18:22] usually if you don't have much money you
[18:25] don't put in the the the solid marble
[18:28] and and the Walnut and all the the
[18:31] different exotic woods and maybe you
[18:33] build a small house would just just fit
[18:35] it'll be home for you but you build
[18:37] according to your ability you build
[18:40] according to who you
[18:41] are and so if we could think this
[18:44] morning what kind of a house would god
[18:48] build if he could build himself one and
[18:51] we know when when David wanted to build
[18:53] him a house he wanted to build him a
[18:55] house of Cedar he wanted to build him a
[18:57] house that was like house and he built
[18:59] his Palace that he built for himself and
[19:02] and Nathan the prophet said do all this
[19:04] in your heart and then he went home and
[19:06] he come back later that uh the next day
[19:09] and God had showed him a vision and he
[19:10] said tell him I took him from the Sheep
[19:12] coat and his hands have been blood he's
[19:15] been in war and all these things and he
[19:17] he won't build me a house but his son
[19:19] will build me a house but the almighty
[19:21] doesn't dwell in temples made with hands
[19:25] so here's a place that God would allow
[19:28] them to build a place place of service
[19:29] to him a place that he would bless with
[19:31] his presence but what kind of a house
[19:33] could contain
[19:36] omnipotence what kind of a temple would
[19:38] contain that and you know when we I
[19:40] began thinking about this when we did
[19:42] the repairs on the on the church here
[19:44] because as we begin to do these things
[19:47] we realize that we're not doing it for
[19:49] God God was happy with it does that make
[19:52] sense God was happy with it he would be
[19:54] happy in a brush Arbor he would be happy
[19:56] I've been in churches overseas where
[19:58] they didn't have nothing but just little
[20:00] plastic folding chairs no walls just a
[20:02] roof he's happy
[20:04] there he's happy with that God's happy
[20:07] with with those places he's happy with
[20:09] what we had we did this for
[20:11] us right we want to make it comfortable
[20:14] for God's people we want to make a place
[20:16] where we can be comfortable worshiping
[20:18] God but but God is not bound to walls
[20:23] and if he did build himself a house what
[20:24] kind of a house would that be it would
[20:26] be beyond our imagination you could
[20:28] think what would an omnipotent God do if
[20:31] you had an unlimited amount of money an
[20:33] unlimited amount of power an unlimited
[20:35] ability to speak things into existence
[20:37] what kind of a house would you live in
[20:40] the joke probably wouldn't look like
[20:41] yours or
[20:43] mine and you've been walking around
[20:45] maybe for a while and you've been
[20:47] building on your house or repairing
[20:48] things maybe over years and and me and
[20:51] brother Danny was talking about how that
[20:52] something if if you don't notice it
[20:54] maybe and then you notice that it's you
[20:56] say well I'll fix it one of these days
[20:57] and then as you live there it just keeps
[21:00] it remains broken it don't bother you
[21:03] and somebody else might come in a new
[21:04] owner might come in and and try to fix
[21:06] all that stuff but but it don't bother
[21:07] you it just stays that way because you
[21:09] don't have an unlimited amount of
[21:10] resources you don't have an unlimited
[21:13] amount of Manpower you don't have an
[21:14] unlimited ability to do that but God
[21:17] does God could have made himself any
[21:19] kind of house that he wanted to when he
[21:22] built himself a
[21:24] house he made it out of flesh and blood
[21:31] Hebrews 10:5 says wherefore when he
[21:34] cometh into the world he saith sacrifice
[21:37] and offering thou wouldest not but a
[21:40] body hast thou prepared
[21:44] me he didn't build himself a place with
[21:47] gold and like the temple that that they
[21:49] had built for him he didn't build
[21:52] himself that kind of a place he built
[21:53] himself a house out of flesh and blood
[21:56] out of Bones
[21:59] out of DNA like yours and like
[22:02] mine he built himself a house we were in
[22:06] His image and he came in the image of
[22:09] man now brother Brandon put it this way
[22:12] in Oneness he said then came Jesus he
[22:14] said now we're coming somewhere he said
[22:17] then came Jesus the expressed image of
[22:19] God the woman's seed conceived by God
[22:23] himself he said the great architect
[22:25] built himself a body
[22:29] he built himself a
[22:31] body and he didn't build himself a body
[22:34] with superhuman
[22:35] strength right he didn't build himself a
[22:38] body with the ability like Superman to
[22:40] jump over buildings or with x-ray vision
[22:44] he built himself a body that got
[22:46] headaches he built himself a body that
[22:48] got tired he built himself a body that
[22:51] looked like everybody else in that part
[22:53] of the world he built himself a body
[22:56] that was just just like any other man
[23:00] but it was God the great architect built
[23:03] himself a body and he said he didn't
[23:05] have to borrow any Timber from anybody
[23:09] from the woman or the man so brother
[23:11] random is introducing us a concept that
[23:13] God didn't have to borrow the the the
[23:16] germ or the egg or anything from the
[23:18] woman or the man in order to build
[23:20] himself a body he didn't borrow anything
[23:23] because he's a Creator he is omnipotent
[23:26] right oh that ought to make us feel good
[23:29] about the situation we're in no matter
[23:30] what it is if you're sick today and if
[23:32] you're in need you know that God built
[23:34] himself a body if he built himself a
[23:36] body he can build you a new body he can
[23:39] he can create in you Wellness he can he
[23:41] can give you your health back he's
[23:44] omnipotent he can do whatever he wants
[23:46] and so he built himself a house he
[23:47] didn't borrow any of the
[23:49] materials he didn't go around and see if
[23:51] he could well I'll see if the Pharisees
[23:53] can give me some some material for my
[23:56] word body no he he he already had the
[23:59] word was already spoken he in the volume
[24:01] of the book it was already written of
[24:02] him he didn't he didn't borrow materials
[24:04] from the
[24:05] Pharisees he didn't borrow from from
[24:08] some other religion somewhere but he
[24:10] built himself a
[24:13] house and he said he said I think of
[24:16] Steven on that day when he stood and
[24:17] said you uncircumcised and hard and ears
[24:19] you stiff necks you always resist the
[24:22] Holy Ghost he said like your fathers did
[24:24] so do you what a what a sermon that
[24:26] would have been to listen to
[24:29] I would have loved to have listened to
[24:30] Steven's sermon that day but it made him
[24:31] mad he said uh Solomon built him my
[24:34] house but how be it the the most high
[24:37] don't live in houses made with hands but
[24:38] a body has s prepared a body has St
[24:42] prepared he said he didn't have to
[24:44] borrow any Timbers anywhere Hebrews the
[24:47] 11th chapter he said in the second or
[24:49] third verse says the world was framed by
[24:51] the word of God that things were made
[24:53] out of things that don't appear amen God
[24:56] just said let there be and there was he
[24:58] didn't have to go over and say Mr Moon
[25:00] would you loan me a little Timber Mr
[25:02] star would you let me have some calcium
[25:04] he said God don't do that he said but
[25:07] you see now why that man was more than
[25:09] just a teacher as people say he is today
[25:13] he said a a philosopher or a good man or
[25:15] a prophet he was
[25:18] Emmanuel and I want you to think about
[25:20] that because we know Jesus wasn't born
[25:22] on December 25th but he know we know he
[25:24] was
[25:25] born and he was born Emmanuel
[25:30] right
[25:31] Emmanuel and it he he was the son of God
[25:34] which is Jehovah God made manifest in
[25:37] his attributes of displaying himself in
[25:40] a body that he built
[25:44] himself he built it didn't get any help
[25:48] from Joseph didn't get any help from
[25:49] Mary she just had to say be it unto me
[25:51] according to your word and God built
[25:55] himself a body and I want us this to
[25:59] encourage us because God is building
[26:00] himself a
[26:01] bride he built it
[26:04] himself he he don't need any help from
[26:06] me you don't need any help from you you
[26:09] don't need any help from the neighbor
[26:12] right You' never seen a preacher put
[26:13] back on his coat have you he never built
[26:16] himself a body made out of uh made out
[26:20] of great big
[26:22] Cathedrals right he he didn't go out and
[26:24] borrow some from the denominations and
[26:26] build himself a bride he build it
[26:27] himself
[26:29] and no amount of of legalistic teaching
[26:32] no amount of of me beating you over the
[26:34] head with something no amount of of of
[26:37] of effort that we could put forth could
[26:39] build a body for
[26:41] God God has to do that but when he does
[26:45] it he does it
[26:46] right amen amen and so brother b as it
[26:50] reflected he said the sinful nature of
[26:52] man could not do the thing that he did
[26:54] see he said so it had to be God making
[26:56] and reflecting himself in the man making
[26:59] a mirror that we might see that perfect
[27:02] man which is Christ he said there uh
[27:06] which is Christ Isaiah 7:14 says
[27:09] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[27:11] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[27:13] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[27:16] his name
[27:19] Emmanuel that's all the materials God
[27:23] needed to build him a house is his word
[27:29] think about that for a moment how did he
[27:32] make the Sun the Stars the moon all the
[27:34] things that are here how did he make the
[27:35] first atom at M atom how did he make the
[27:39] first molecule how did he do that he did
[27:42] that by his
[27:44] word right it had to be his word and if
[27:48] he did that by his word then we know
[27:51] that it does he doesn't have to borrow
[27:53] anything from anybody and this is
[27:54] sufficient the word is sufficient to
[27:57] build his body Matthew 1:20 but while he
[27:59] thought on these things behold the angel
[28:01] of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[28:02] this is Joseph he was thinking about
[28:04] putting away Mary and said the angel of
[28:06] the Lord appeared to him in a dream
[28:07] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[28:09] to take un thee Mary thy wife for that
[28:12] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[28:14] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[28:17] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[28:20] he shall save his people from their sins
[28:23] now all this was done he says that it
[28:24] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[28:27] the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[28:28] virgin shall be with child and shall
[28:30] bring forth a son they shall call his
[28:32] name Emmanuel which being interpreted is
[28:35] God With Us God With
[28:38] Us when was he God With Us when he was
[28:43] born right he had to be and why would he
[28:46] be because he was godb built he was
[28:49] built by God and God inhabited him he he
[28:51] was Emmanuel God With Us John 1:1 in the
[28:54] beginning was the word in the beginning
[28:57] was the word word the logos and the Word
[28:59] was with God and the Word was God the
[29:02] same was in the beginning with
[29:04] God all things were made by him without
[29:08] him was not anything made that was made
[29:12] so he is the word is the creator who
[29:15] built himself a house does that make
[29:17] sense the word is the creator who built
[29:20] himself a
[29:21] house now he says all things were made
[29:25] by him without him was not anything made
[29:26] that was made and then if you go to down
[29:28] to verse 14 he says the word was flesh
[29:30] and dwelt among us we beheld his glory
[29:33] the glory is of the only begotten of the
[29:35] father full of grace and
[29:39] truth now look the word was made flesh
[29:42] what word was it brother B says Jesus
[29:44] was the word he said John was the
[29:46] prophet Jesus came to him in the water
[29:48] because the word always comes to the
[29:50] prophet without failing the word comes
[29:52] to it when did when did he become the
[29:54] word when he was born Behold a virgin
[29:57] shall shall conceive that he was the
[29:59] word the word was conceived in
[30:01] Mary right he was the word when he was
[30:04] born he didn't become the word later the
[30:06] word came to the prophet in the water
[30:09] and then the spirit settled down on him
[30:11] like a dove now
[30:13] look brother B says when the Virgin
[30:15] birth came on that was a paradox you
[30:17] know a paradox is something that's
[30:19] unexplainable right and some people
[30:21] don't like the
[30:23] unexplainable right I don't particularly
[30:25] like the
[30:26] unexplainable we started hanging these
[30:30] things yesterday or the day before
[30:32] whenever we started brother Danny and
[30:33] those instructions were pretty
[30:36] unexplainable you just kind of had to
[30:38] figure it
[30:39] out and and you think it would be simple
[30:43] but it's not nothing simple it's
[30:45] unexplainable but you know there's
[30:47] things we don't understand and there's
[30:48] things we'll never understand and God
[30:50] makes it that way there's things the
[30:53] Virgin Birth come on that was a paradox
[30:56] how that God in order to make himself
[30:58] known to man became man that God the
[31:00] great spirit he said God to me was
[31:02] before there wasn't even a light there
[31:04] wasn't a meteor there wasn't an atom
[31:07] there wasn't a molecule there wasn't
[31:09] anything and everything was God he said
[31:12] yes that's how great he is he is from
[31:15] eternity through eternity always was God
[31:18] he always will be God and how the
[31:21] greatest of all life listen the greatest
[31:25] of all life become a little small germ
[31:28] in the womb of a
[31:29] woman and we think about that and we
[31:31] think well you know for me to do that
[31:34] that's beneath me to do that to do
[31:36] something maybe something menial
[31:37] something little for God but God who was
[31:41] so great that he was everything he was
[31:42] all there
[31:43] was right became a
[31:46] germ Amen in the womb of a
[31:50] woman in order to take his own law to
[31:54] pay the penalty of his of his law death
[31:58] how God was manifested in the flesh how
[32:00] the great God Of Heaven changed his
[32:02] strain come from being God to be man
[32:05] through the Virgin birth he said nobody
[32:07] can figure it
[32:08] out he said science today can can't tell
[32:11] you how that virgin birth was but God
[32:13] did it he came amen so don't let people
[32:16] tell you well I can prove to you there
[32:18] won't be a bride I can prove to you
[32:19] we're going down I can prove to you
[32:21] nothing's going to happen but I can
[32:23] prove to you there won't be a Rapture
[32:24] don't let anybody tell you that because
[32:26] they can't explain to you how no got in
[32:28] a boat and survived a flood over the
[32:29] whole earth they can't explain that much
[32:32] as they' like to try they can't explain
[32:34] to you how the children of Israel walk
[32:35] through the Red Sea on dry ground didn't
[32:37] even get their shoes wet they can't
[32:39] explain to you how a virgin conceived if
[32:42] they can't explain that to you how will
[32:43] they explain the bride to you today how
[32:45] would they explain you can't explain
[32:47] your own
[32:48] life I can't explain my own life just by
[32:51] the grace and mercy of God that's the
[32:53] only reason why we're here I can't tell
[32:55] you whether it was because of this and a
[32:57] certain the way I was raised I can look
[32:59] back and try to figure it out and it
[33:00] still don't make sense I don't really
[33:02] know why I'm here today you don't really
[33:04] know why you're here today but there's
[33:06] something inside of you that that's
[33:07] created something in you a life for you
[33:10] something that you don't want to sin
[33:11] anymore you don't want to do those
[33:13] things that you used to do why there's a
[33:14] new desire there's a new creation
[33:16] there's God built himself a
[33:19] house amen God built himself a house and
[33:23] so if you look back and you try to
[33:24] explain it you'll never figure it out
[33:26] but just trust that God knows what he's
[33:30] doing he says science today can't tell
[33:34] you how that virgin birth was but God
[33:36] did it he came no one was able everyone
[33:39] was sexually born like he said the one
[33:41] man the same as the rest of them no one
[33:43] could help the other one we was all in
[33:48] trouble and then God himself came down
[33:52] was
[33:53] born amen we were all in trouble
[33:58] I was in trouble I had ideas for my life
[34:01] but they were trouble I wanted to do
[34:03] certain things but they were trouble you
[34:05] you had certain things you wanted to do
[34:07] but it was trouble you were in trouble
[34:08] but God came himself down and was born
[34:11] not of a Jew not of a gentile but his
[34:14] blood was God he said blood comes from
[34:17] the male sex in this case it was God God
[34:19] the Creator created the blood cell in
[34:22] the womb of Mary and built himself a
[34:24] tabernacle that himself come down
[34:28] and lived in it and we're going to try
[34:31] to keep God within the four walls of a
[34:34] church you think about it you can't keep
[34:37] him in
[34:39] walls people try to say well I'm the
[34:41] only one that preaches the truth you got
[34:43] to come and hear me or you're going to
[34:44] be lost God built himself a
[34:47] house God will have a bride without spot
[34:50] or wrinkle he will present it to himself
[34:54] a glorious
[34:55] church right he does that himself that
[34:58] that's not up to me or you he does that
[35:00] himself we sure we work and we put forth
[35:02] effort and all these things but we do
[35:04] that because of what he did because he
[35:06] building himself in us God he said was
[35:08] in Christ reconciling the world to
[35:10] himself the very very word Christ means
[35:12] anointed one oh he was God God and His
[35:15] fullness dwelt in him and in him dwelt
[35:17] the fullness of the godhead bodily he
[35:19] said that was a
[35:21] paradox that was a paradox what that
[35:23] means is you can't explain it on a
[35:26] chart right that's what the word paradox
[35:29] means now
[35:31] look he says it staggered people in them
[35:35] day he said you being a man make
[35:37] yourself God it still does it he said
[35:40] but just the same it's still the same
[35:42] Paradox is carried on he was God he is
[35:45] still God he always will be
[35:48] God yes sir he is the same yesterday
[35:52] today and
[35:53] forever brother Brandon says that virgin
[35:55] birth was a mystery to the people they
[35:57] couldn't understand it and just just I'm
[36:00] working through this in the Paradox so
[36:01] we can get somewhere this morning but I
[36:03] think it's so important for us to
[36:06] understand especially at Christmas time
[36:08] he said that virgin birth was a mystery
[36:10] to the people they couldn't understand
[36:11] it just like the new birth is today the
[36:14] new birth is a mystery to the
[36:17] people they can't understand
[36:20] it they don't know what you mean and
[36:24] listen to what he says he said they have
[36:25] belittled it bring it down
[36:28] saying well just because you believe
[36:30] something and it's important to believe
[36:33] believing is the first step but what you
[36:35] believe comes out in what you do right
[36:38] and what God does in
[36:40] you right and so every time Abraham
[36:43] believed it was counted him for
[36:44] righteousness God honored that belief
[36:47] right Abraham takes a his son up to the
[36:50] altar drags him up there puts him on
[36:52] there and God honored that provided the
[36:54] lamb right Abraham believes God and and
[36:58] stays faithful for 25 years God give him
[37:00] Isaac right and so every time Abraham
[37:03] believed God and was counted him for
[37:05] righteousness but then God saw to it
[37:08] that that whatever Abraham believed
[37:10] actually took
[37:11] place right now what you believe has to
[37:14] take
[37:14] place and I don't mean it takes place
[37:17] automatically or the way people think it
[37:19] does but it happens you say I believe
[37:22] God I believe I've been saved I believe
[37:24] I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and
[37:25] something changes in your life right it
[37:28] has to he said Devils believe the same
[37:31] thing and tremble it isn't what you
[37:32] believe it's what God has actually
[37:35] done right now we we fixed that we
[37:38] painted the walls we put new chairs in
[37:39] we put new carpet in but look I could
[37:42] tell you we're going to do it and I did
[37:44] for several
[37:47] months but until you actually see
[37:51] it you know it's one thing to believe it
[37:53] it's one thing for me to believe that we
[37:54] were going to do it but until it's
[37:56] actually done there's no proof of it
[37:59] right and so the the fruit of my belief
[38:03] that we were going to be able to do it
[38:04] is that we did
[38:06] it right and that's what that's what see
[38:09] that's what God does when you believe
[38:10] then the fruit of that comes out in the
[38:12] New Birth he said it's what God has
[38:13] actually done the new birth is a birth
[38:16] he said it it was new it was a paradox
[38:18] when God brought new life to the human
[38:20] race he said to reject it is eternal
[38:22] separation to receive it is eternal life
[38:26] to receive it but the the problem is
[38:27] people get in their mind well if I could
[38:30] understand it I would receive it you'll
[38:31] never understand a virgin birth and
[38:33] you'll never understand the new birth
[38:36] you have to receive the new
[38:37] birth it's a birth it's something you
[38:40] don't don't understand it you you
[38:41] believe it and you receive it he said
[38:43] you're on the same basis as Adam and Eve
[38:45] was he said if God put you on anything
[38:48] else it would be unjust to Adam and Eve
[38:51] He said Each Adam and Eve tonight has
[38:54] got right and wrong setting before them
[38:57] you can make your choice you can take
[38:59] God's word or leave God's word you can
[39:03] take God's word or take your
[39:04] denominational Creeds about it he said
[39:07] you can take your modernistic ideas of
[39:09] what it is you can be born again and
[39:11] filled with the Holy Ghost or you can be
[39:12] church ised I love the way he put that
[39:16] you can be church ised either one you
[39:18] want to
[39:19] be I want to be filled with the Holy
[39:21] Spirit don't you see the thing is people
[39:24] can be church ised and raised their
[39:25] hands people can be churched and run the
[39:28] aisles CU that's just what the church
[39:30] does right people can be Church eyes and
[39:32] read the books and listen to the Tes
[39:34] they can be churched and do that but
[39:36] there's something about a born- again
[39:37] believer they want to do that they're
[39:39] not doing that because somebody else
[39:41] does it they're doing it because there's
[39:42] something inside of them you can be
[39:45] Church IED and sit on a Pew for years
[39:47] but one day it'll show the fruit of what
[39:49] you are but you have to be born again of
[39:51] the spirit and if you're born again of
[39:53] the Holy Spirit there is nothing that
[39:55] can remove you from that state in Christ
[39:58] nothing you might fail you might have
[39:59] problems but there is nothing that can
[40:01] take you away from
[40:03] that you can take God's word or you can
[40:05] be Church eyes you can be filled with
[40:06] the Holy Ghost you can be Church eyes
[40:08] either one you want to be Lord help me
[40:09] to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[40:13] today you can come to the world of Life
[40:15] Tabernacle and be like the Word of Life
[40:17] Tabernacle and associate with Word of
[40:18] Life Tabernacle people and just just be
[40:20] like the rest of us or you can be filled
[40:22] with the Holy
[40:23] Ghost that's that's up to us we have to
[40:26] say you say why R it up to me if he does
[40:28] it well we have to say be it unto me
[40:31] according to your
[40:32] word Lord build your house in
[40:35] me is that what we want Lord build your
[40:38] house we may have an idea what the house
[40:41] should be like but Lord build your house
[40:43] in my heart build your house don't let
[40:45] me just take it the way I want it the
[40:48] way I want to see it but Lord build your
[40:50] house in
[40:51] me amen for me he said to live is Christ
[40:54] Hallelujah he said I believe that the
[40:56] same God that fell upon on the day of
[40:59] Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of
[41:00] fire and divided himself with clothing
[41:03] tongues among his people he said it's
[41:05] here tonight it's the same God he was
[41:07] then he is today with the same Holy
[41:10] Ghost he said I know it's a paradox it
[41:12] cannot be explained he said emotions
[41:15] screaming crying and so forth cannot be
[41:17] explained you say I thought brother
[41:18] Brandon was against that he wasn't
[41:19] against that he was against those that
[41:22] didn't have it and did
[41:24] it right he said don't don't live jump
[41:26] any higher than you can live but he
[41:28] wasn't against
[41:30] jumping right so don't jump any higher
[41:33] than you can live but he said people
[41:34] don't explain emotion screaming crying
[41:37] cannot be explained but it's a paradox
[41:39] how God does
[41:40] it right and I don't know how you felt
[41:43] when you were born again maybe you
[41:44] didn't feel anything it's possible maybe
[41:48] you didn't have a great experience maybe
[41:50] it was just a moment of your life that
[41:51] things all of a sudden something settled
[41:53] in your heart maybe you were sitting in
[41:55] a church service I was in a room by
[41:56] myself
[41:57] myself a a at home at at night praying
[42:01] and and it's just at that moment that
[42:03] something come over me and and I felt
[42:06] different but then I got went out the
[42:08] next day and fought the same
[42:10] battles some people jump some people run
[42:13] some people speak in tongues it's a
[42:15] paradox how God does it and you can
[42:18] bring two people down to the Altar and
[42:19] one of them really get it one don't they
[42:22] both speak with tongues they both shout
[42:25] they both run the aisles one of them go
[42:26] for it how to Chang man and the other
[42:29] one remain a sinner and brother random
[42:31] talked about that how that Satan swed
[42:33] tears and and God seed wheat and and it
[42:36] all grew up in the same field and you
[42:37] don't know what it is until it grows
[42:40] up right but it's a paradox how God does
[42:42] it but he still does it that's the great
[42:45] thing Brother Sam he still does it he
[42:46] can still do it for you today if you've
[42:49] been Church ass he can still change you
[42:51] he can still change me whatever it is he
[42:53] can still do that amen amen as long as
[42:56] we can say be done to me according to
[42:58] your
[42:59] word
[43:01] now he said it's the Unseen God dwelling
[43:04] in the human heart making himself
[43:06] visible by vindicating his word that he
[43:10] is the same yesterday today and
[43:15] forever amen so God creating this
[43:18] omnipotent think about it building
[43:19] himself a house look and why it had to
[43:22] be Shepherds brother B said he had
[43:23] started a new creation what was it a
[43:25] creation of himself
[43:28] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[43:30] the Bible said in the beginning of the
[43:32] creation of God God was created in human
[43:35] form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt
[43:39] he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and
[43:42] Bones and lived in that
[43:45] Tabernacle so where do you think he
[43:47] wants to live
[43:49] today we can make this place nice you
[43:52] can make your home nice he wants to live
[43:54] in Flesh and Bones
[43:57] he wants to live in Flesh and Bones he
[43:59] wants to be born in the manger of your
[44:01] heart he built himself a house to live
[44:03] in it he said Tabernacle he could lived
[44:05] in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel again
[44:08] Emmanuel God With Us Emmanuel in a
[44:11] Manger God With Us God With Us he built
[44:14] himself a house to live in it so he
[44:15] could reflect his word to his subjects
[44:17] through that amen he says you know what
[44:20] God is when you see Christ you know what
[44:23] God is when you see
[44:25] Christ amen
[44:28] now let's go to 1 Corinthians
[44:31] 12:27 and then look at 2 Corinthians
[44:33] 5:17 1 Corinthians 12:27 says now ye are
[44:37] the body of
[44:39] Christ now who's going to build that
[44:42] body right who's going to build that
[44:44] body now we know how what God uses to
[44:45] build the body uses the five-fold
[44:48] ministry because he said he did right
[44:51] Ephesians 4:11 he said for the
[44:53] edification that word is the building up
[44:56] of the body that's what God does and
[44:59] that's why I believe that you know when
[45:01] you when you begin to have a a Doctrine
[45:03] and you begin to get so closed off that
[45:05] you're the only one that preaches it
[45:07] right you've got a problem because
[45:09] there's got to be at least five of
[45:13] you if you're the only one left in the
[45:15] world and some have gone to the extreme
[45:17] of saying well there's no preachers left
[45:18] at all nobody left at all well then
[45:21] you're saying that God he started
[45:24] building and the crew you got didn't
[45:26] work so he had to get rid of them just
[45:29] do it himself that's not what God
[45:32] does God does the building through human
[45:35] beings and God knew exactly who would be
[45:37] false and who would be true and who
[45:39] would remain true and everything about
[45:40] it God knew he knew everything about it
[45:43] he didn't have to ask anything about it
[45:45] God knew exactly what my Ministry would
[45:47] look like what every other Ministry
[45:48] would look like from the beginning and
[45:50] if he's able to bring me here with the
[45:51] truth he's able to bring others with the
[45:53] truth is that right he's able to do what
[45:57] he wants to do now I'm going to take it
[45:58] back
[46:00] off L my voice and I thought that would
[46:03] help but it didn't
[46:07] now he says you are the body of Christ
[46:09] and members in particular each one of
[46:12] you is a member of the body of
[46:16] Christ and and that doesn't change if
[46:18] you don't go to
[46:20] church right if you're born again you're
[46:22] a member of the of the body of Christ
[46:24] what you are is a non-working member if
[46:27] you don't fellowship with other
[46:29] believers right if you're really born
[46:31] again now that that's between you and
[46:33] God whether you be born again not want
[46:35] to fellowship with Believers but if you
[46:38] don't fellowship with Believers I'm not
[46:39] talking about those that are sick and
[46:41] out this morning I'm talking about
[46:42] people who just W go to church at all
[46:44] now why why would people not go to
[46:46] church because you if you're a part of
[46:49] the body of Christ you're a part of the
[46:50] other members of the body of Christ you
[46:52] fit
[46:53] in right somewhere you fit in
[46:57] that doesn't mean you'll get along with
[46:59] everybody because the part of you that
[47:01] that fits in is not this flesh and this
[47:05] mind the part of you that fits in is the
[47:08] part that's ordained of
[47:09] God right God ordained something in your
[47:12] life that would fit in but he didn't
[47:14] necessarily ordain all your quirks he
[47:16] said well when I find a church that goes
[47:18] along with all my little things that I
[47:20] all my little idiosyncrasies I want the
[47:23] music a certain way and the people to be
[47:25] a certain way and them to treat me a
[47:26] certain way God don't do that he builds
[47:29] himself a house the way he wants it and
[47:32] you'll fit in if you'll say be it unto
[47:34] me according to your
[47:36] word right that's true it God Will Make
[47:39] A place there's a place for you there's
[47:41] a a particular place for you
[47:45] now he says you are the body of Christ
[47:48] and members in particular 2 Corinthians
[47:49] 5:17 he said therefore If any man be in
[47:52] Christ he is a new creature the word's
[47:56] creation
[47:58] If any man being in Christ he is a new
[47:59] creation Now look Jesus was a new
[48:02] creation that was God's creation he was
[48:06] the first of the new creation we'll get
[48:08] into that in a moment he was the first
[48:10] one of a new creation he was he was
[48:12] God's first born New Creation listen he
[48:17] built himself a body that was his new
[48:19] creation and if any man be in Christ he
[48:21] is a new creation old things are passed
[48:24] away means they're dead behold all
[48:27] things are become
[48:30] new and all things are of God and I want
[48:32] you to really notice this verse all
[48:34] things are of God thank you brother Joe
[48:36] I appreciate that all things are of God
[48:39] who hath reconciled us to
[48:42] himself by Jesus Christ and have given
[48:44] to us the ministry of
[48:47] reconciliation all things are of God all
[48:49] things are created by God he said to it
[48:53] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[48:56] world to
[48:57] himself not imputing their trespasses
[49:00] unto them aren't you glad that that this
[49:02] verse is in there not imputing their
[49:05] trespasses unto them and ha committed
[49:07] unto us the word of
[49:10] reconciliation now we have the word of
[49:12] reconciliation he's given us what did he
[49:15] build his body with with the word a
[49:16] virgin shall
[49:17] conceive what's he building the bride
[49:20] with how's he going to reconcile the
[49:21] members of the Bride back to himself by
[49:24] the
[49:25] word right that's that's why we give the
[49:27] the such importance to the word of God
[49:30] he does it by his word he reconciles the
[49:33] world unto himself by the word of
[49:35] reconciliation the gospel of
[49:37] reconciliation the thing that brings to
[49:39] us is the word that that's what brings
[49:41] us back to God Amen it's the word of
[49:44] reconciliation he commits that to us but
[49:47] who did it he does it he's the architect
[49:50] he's the master
[49:52] builder then he gives it he commits that
[49:54] word of reconciliation to us
[49:58] amen 2 Corinthians
[50:00] 5:20 he said now then we are ambassadors
[50:03] for Christ we are ambassadors for Christ
[50:07] we represent Christ when an ambassador
[50:10] goes from this nation to another Nation
[50:11] he speaks for the
[50:13] US that that's that's his job that's
[50:16] what he says on the on the official
[50:18] record he may think differently but he
[50:21] speaks for the
[50:22] US right we might think differently it
[50:24] should be different but we speak for for
[50:28] God huh and Peter said let If any man
[50:30] speak let him speak as the Oracle of God
[50:33] an oracle wasn't in the in the Pagan
[50:35] world was an image that the that the God
[50:37] spoke
[50:38] through right it it was something that
[50:41] that was just given over to the to God
[50:43] to a god to speak through and we are the
[50:46] speak as the Oracles of God that God
[50:48] would actually speak through us oh that
[50:51] that you talk about a
[50:54] paradox he said for Heath made him
[50:57] him he said he let me back up we are
[51:00] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[51:02] beseech You by us so when we ask you to
[51:05] be reconciled it's as if God is asking
[51:08] you to be
[51:09] reconciled we pray you in Christ said be
[51:12] reconciled to God for Heath made him to
[51:14] be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[51:17] might be made the righteousness of God
[51:20] in
[51:21] him you think about it when he was born
[51:25] you look at how innocent baby is we've
[51:28] had several babies born lately a baby's
[51:30] completely innocent right if a baby died
[51:32] they'd go to heaven no matter how sorry
[51:34] their parents
[51:36] were right because the baby's innocent
[51:39] the baby's innocent even though there's
[51:40] that nature in there that once he's old
[51:42] enough to know right and wrong it'll
[51:44] lead him to wrong right there's a nature
[51:47] there but but he's an innocent child now
[51:49] you think about a God created
[51:52] child and he's there in the
[51:55] manger and and Mary's taking care of him
[51:58] and he's he's just a baby and he's the
[52:01] most innocent thing most perfect thing
[52:03] that's ever been born in the
[52:06] world he was the righteousness of
[52:09] God and all of his life he never lost
[52:13] that he wasn't born of sexual desire he
[52:16] didn't have that that adamic curse that
[52:18] nature in him to to make him do wrong he
[52:21] never
[52:23] sent and we and he was made sin for
[52:28] us who did nothing but sin brother the
[52:31] Joe once we were old enough to Once We
[52:34] Were old to that's all we did but he the
[52:37] heavenlies was made sin for us he had
[52:41] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[52:43] sin who was completely
[52:45] innocent that we might be made the
[52:48] righteousness of God so that before God
[52:52] we would come back as innocent as that
[52:54] baby
[52:57] as innocent as that man that hung on the
[52:59] cross that never did anything wrong that
[53:02] we might be made he was the
[53:03] righteousness of God he becom sin that
[53:05] we might be made the righteousness of
[53:08] God in him for in Christ Jesus neither
[53:12] circumcision availeth anything nor
[53:16] uncircumcision but a new
[53:20] creation that word is new creature a new
[53:24] creation that's in Galatians 6:15
[53:27] now he's they're having the argument
[53:28] should we be circumcised should we not
[53:30] he said you don't understand it's not
[53:32] this flesh he's working on he's making
[53:35] him building himself a house and that's
[53:38] where legalism gets people in trouble
[53:40] you don't understand that that's not
[53:42] what he's doing he's building himself a
[53:43] house and it comes from the inside
[53:46] out not from the outside
[53:50] in listen the Bren says in God's power
[53:54] to transform he said Jesus Christ was
[53:55] God himself self manifested because he
[53:58] was the son because he was begotten it
[54:00] was just a tabernacle for him to live in
[54:03] no man has seen God at any time with the
[54:04] only begotten of the father has declared
[54:06] him God built himself a house body to
[54:10] live in come down so that you could
[54:12] touch him 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[54:15] controversy great is the mystery of
[54:17] godliness God was manifest In the Flesh
[54:19] seen of angels believed on received up
[54:21] into heaven he said you being flesh and
[54:25] him being flesh
[54:27] then you can have Fellowship now because
[54:29] he was God God's attribute of
[54:32] love God is love he that right and Jesus
[54:35] was God's attribute of
[54:37] love and if you have fellowship with God
[54:40] you'll have love for God right you have
[54:43] to he that's what he is that's what you
[54:45] are if you're a new creation then how
[54:48] will people know that who you are
[54:50] because you have love for one
[54:52] another right that's what the Bible says
[54:55] and it says when the at of love was
[54:57] displayed which that was God himself all
[55:00] the attributes that hung on to him in
[55:02] other words all the attributes that was
[55:04] his that you could ascribe to him all
[55:07] the attributes that hung on to him come
[55:08] to him everything that was like him come
[55:12] to him all the father has given me will
[55:15] come to me sure he said they had to be
[55:17] predestinated if it wasn't you won't be
[55:21] there aren't you glad that he's the one
[55:24] building the house
[55:28] amen he said you won't be there that's
[55:30] all he said now we can
[55:32] Fellowship I love this through the
[55:34] riches of his
[55:36] word brother Caleb we ought to be able
[55:38] to take the word in fellowship with one
[55:40] another because that's how we fellowship
[55:42] with
[55:44] God we can pray we talk to God and all
[55:47] those things and we feel the spirit of
[55:48] God but it's when we begin to get into
[55:50] his word that's how we begin to really
[55:52] fellowship with God why because this is
[55:55] him and we begin to get into the word
[55:57] and we begin to read we begin to see
[55:58] what he did for us and it just brings
[56:00] something to us why why does it mean so
[56:02] much to you when once it didn't because
[56:04] you're a part of that word and you can
[56:06] fellowship with him through the riches
[56:07] of his word which you are a part of
[56:10] that's why we like going to church
[56:13] that's why we like hearing the word
[56:14] that's why it's not enough just to go
[56:16] every now and then that's why it's not
[56:17] enough just to be a Halfway Christian we
[56:19] want to have fellowship with the word
[56:21] that's why whenever we hear something
[56:22] that goes against something we're doing
[56:24] we say Lord forgive me why we want
[56:26] fellowship with the word we don't want
[56:28] to be something different we want
[56:29] fellowship with the word because that's
[56:31] the riches of his word is how we have
[56:33] fellowship with
[56:34] him because he said he was the word at
[56:36] the beginning but you're the word
[56:39] now Revelations
[56:44] 3:14 it says under the angel of the
[56:46] Church of the Le ofans write these
[56:47] things say the amen the faithful and
[56:48] true witness the beginning of the
[56:50] creation
[56:55] God I want us to look at something
[56:57] brother BR said in the church ages and
[56:58] we'll close for too awful long thank you
[57:02] for bearing with me this morning I know
[57:04] it's sometimes harder to listen when
[57:06] everything's new and and there's not
[57:08] very many people here and maybe you
[57:10] sitting at home if you know I know
[57:12] because I did it last week it's hard to
[57:14] listen at home you're sitting there and
[57:17] but I I got some good things out of the
[57:18] sermon that I listened to last weekend
[57:20] and and inspired me and so maybe it'll
[57:23] do the same thing for you today now
[57:25] brother BR says the church age book in
[57:26] the exposition of seven Church ages he
[57:28] said but now he is standing in the midst
[57:30] of the church he stands there revealing
[57:32] who he is in this last age he calls
[57:34] himself the author that's what that word
[57:36] beginning means doesn't mean the first
[57:38] one created it means the author of the
[57:40] creation of God he said this is another
[57:44] creation this has to do with the church
[57:47] so if he's the author of the creation of
[57:49] God he said this is a special
[57:51] designation designation of himself he is
[57:54] the creator of that church
[57:58] Church think about that just like he was
[58:01] the designer of that body that he lived
[58:03] in but it wasn't what anybody thought it
[58:05] would
[58:06] be right it wasn't made out of what
[58:09] people
[58:10] thought it wasn't some great
[58:14] intellectual some some man that could
[58:16] put it all together and and it was a man
[58:20] just like any other man brother Brandon
[58:22] said in one place he didn't look much
[58:24] like a leader you would wouldn't have
[58:26] picked him out to be the
[58:27] leader but he was God manifested In the
[58:31] Flesh but look but he is the beginning
[58:35] of the creation of God if he is creating
[58:37] what's he going to create he's going to
[58:38] create flesh and Bone he's going to
[58:40] create a house he's going to make
[58:41] himself a house he's going to cause you
[58:44] to have a new birth so he can have a
[58:46] house to live in but it's not going to
[58:48] be what everybody thinks you may have a
[58:50] little church here and a small one
[58:53] somewhere else and a big one over here
[58:56] you may have some that maybe don't have
[58:59] very high
[59:00] IQ thank
[59:03] god build himself a house he may wanted
[59:07] that now you can go to somebody else's
[59:08] house brother Harvey you walk in there
[59:09] and and start look I can't believe they
[59:10] use that kind of marble can't you can't
[59:13] believe they put that kind of
[59:13] countertops in they'll regret that you
[59:15] ever walk through a house and thought
[59:17] that wonder who they had installed the
[59:20] carpet you know he built himself a
[59:24] house he did it the way he want wanted
[59:26] it for his own
[59:28] purposes so he put however many we don't
[59:32] understand I don't know why there's so
[59:33] many Believers in Hardy I don't know why
[59:35] there's so many unbelievers in Hardy
[59:37] either
[59:39] but but you don't know why there's
[59:41] message people here what what sense does
[59:43] that
[59:44] make right as far as I know brother Bram
[59:46] never preached
[59:48] here you know if You' think there'd be a
[59:50] big church in Jonesboro or one in
[59:52] Memphis or one in St Louis where he
[59:55] begun his ministry
[59:57] where where would the people be why
[59:59] would God do that God does what he wants
[1:00:00] to do he builds himself a house that
[1:00:05] make sense and that's why we can't be
[1:00:06] pigheaded about it we can't be too stuck
[1:00:09] on what the way we've Envision of what
[1:00:11] God's going to do because he builds
[1:00:13] himself a
[1:00:15] house we can say you know I by faith I
[1:00:19] can buy so many chairs that we've got to
[1:00:22] stack them in the back but he's got to
[1:00:24] build himself a house does that make
[1:00:26] sense he builds the church he is the
[1:00:29] creator of that
[1:00:31] church amen and that's why the church
[1:00:34] can last the church may go through hell
[1:00:36] and back excuse me but that's that's
[1:00:38] what some of us have been
[1:00:41] through but if the church goes through
[1:00:43] that and back they're still his created
[1:00:47] church he does it he doesn't ask us how
[1:00:50] he wants us to do it if he wants to
[1:00:53] create the right kind of love the right
[1:00:55] kind of atmosphere the kind of spirit
[1:00:56] God does that we don't get it to ask as
[1:01:00] a minister we have no we have absolutely
[1:01:03] no control over our field of service I
[1:01:06] can't make myself a pastor an evangelist
[1:01:08] a prophet I can't do it I'm just am what
[1:01:11] I am right I can't do I can't be
[1:01:14] anything else I can just do what God
[1:01:17] called me to do and when God presents me
[1:01:19] with an opportunity I just have to do
[1:01:21] what God enables me to do I can't do
[1:01:23] anything else oh Church we could only
[1:01:26] understand it take some of the stress
[1:01:27] out out of it he is the creator of that
[1:01:30] church if he wants to use the materials
[1:01:33] maybe your children that have gone off
[1:01:34] and into the world and they're out there
[1:01:36] and you think how could he ever use them
[1:01:38] again if he wants to use them he'll find
[1:01:39] a way to do
[1:01:42] it he is the creator of that church
[1:01:45] he'll use the materials he wants to use
[1:01:47] he'll use the kind of preaching that he
[1:01:49] wants not the kind we
[1:01:52] want right he'll make it words hard
[1:01:56] sometimes to go to church maybe allow
[1:01:58] Satan to come in and do we know this
[1:01:59] virus come from Satan didn't come from
[1:02:01] God come from Satan but maybe God allows
[1:02:04] it just to see what we'll
[1:02:06] do right sometimes he allows it just to
[1:02:09] see what we'll do and how we'll react to
[1:02:11] it if we when we overcome it then it
[1:02:14] means something to us I'm praying for
[1:02:16] all of you today what what you're doing
[1:02:18] is you're not sick you're
[1:02:21] overcoming that's what you're doing
[1:02:23] today you're overcoming you're listening
[1:02:24] to the word you're overcoming
[1:02:26] amen now look he's the creator of that
[1:02:29] church he said the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:02:31] created his own bride doesn't he have a
[1:02:33] right
[1:02:35] to he's not going to leave it to chance
[1:02:38] he's not going to use our dating
[1:02:42] networks to match himself up he's not
[1:02:44] going to use some denominational dating
[1:02:46] service right he's not going to let the
[1:02:49] Catholics control who who gets in who
[1:02:51] doesn't or the Methodist or the Baptist
[1:02:53] or the message people you going to do
[1:02:56] that he creates himself a body he
[1:02:58] creates himself a bride he said the
[1:03:00] bridegroom created his own bride I'm so
[1:03:03] glad he did because I have that gives me
[1:03:05] hope right I may be different from
[1:03:07] someone else but God creates his own
[1:03:09] bride you may be different from someone
[1:03:11] else but God creates his own Bride As
[1:03:13] the spirit of God he come down created
[1:03:15] in the Virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:03:17] his body was born he said I want to
[1:03:19] repeat that he created the very Sals in
[1:03:21] the womb of Mary for the body he created
[1:03:23] the very Sals for the
[1:03:26] body amen he said it was not enough for
[1:03:29] the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a
[1:03:30] human ovam supplied by Mary that would
[1:03:33] have been sful mankind producing a body
[1:03:35] see man could not have any hand in it
[1:03:38] man could not have oh my it could not
[1:03:40] have any hand in it don't you realize
[1:03:42] he's creating a bride today that mankind
[1:03:44] will have no zero hand in
[1:03:47] it you won't be able to attribute it to
[1:03:50] a
[1:03:51] man you can't attribute the message to a
[1:03:54] man today
[1:03:56] you can't do it because the message
[1:03:59] people should have went nowhere because
[1:04:01] everything everybody fought with one
[1:04:03] another and there was so many doctrines
[1:04:04] and everything else but we're still here
[1:04:06] you can't attribute that to a man you
[1:04:08] can't even attribute that to
[1:04:10] ourselves God did
[1:04:12] it God made himself a bride and see then
[1:04:17] I'm not worried you know I know some are
[1:04:18] worried I and I see the same things they
[1:04:20] see I I see people falling into
[1:04:22] worldliness I see that I'm not worried
[1:04:25] about about
[1:04:26] it it bothers me I'll preach about it
[1:04:30] but I'm not worried that God's going to
[1:04:31] allow his bride to fall there does that
[1:04:34] make sense God builds himself a
[1:04:38] bride and if we begin to focus on all
[1:04:40] these things there'll always be a mixed
[1:04:42] multitude it may not be everybody it may
[1:04:44] be just a few but God built himself a
[1:04:48] bride and if I get an attitude where I
[1:04:50] can't help anybody because I'm I'm so
[1:04:52] concerned I'm so worried about it see I
[1:04:54] got to leave some things up to him Mary
[1:04:57] can't sit there and and constantly worry
[1:04:59] oh I don't feel it I don't feel it I
[1:05:00] don't feel it CU she didn't feel nothing
[1:05:02] for a long
[1:05:03] time but one day she began to feel she
[1:05:06] was
[1:05:07] pregnant that baby started to grow amen
[1:05:11] and she couldn't make it grow all she
[1:05:13] could do was
[1:05:15] eat you know that that's the best thing
[1:05:17] a mother can do for their baby is just
[1:05:20] eat you got licensed to
[1:05:22] eat now that don't continue after the
[1:05:24] baby is born
[1:05:28] but my wife I I didn't say a thing about
[1:05:32] what she I don't say much about what she
[1:05:33] eats anyway because that's dangerous
[1:05:36] but I didn't say a thing about what she
[1:05:38] ate while she was pregnant who am I to
[1:05:41] tell her what she
[1:05:42] needs right she she knows what she needs
[1:05:46] her own body has a craving for certain
[1:05:48] things because that's what the baby
[1:05:49] needs amen and the bride has a craving
[1:05:52] for a certain
[1:05:54] thing amen has a craving for the word
[1:05:57] and some God lay something on my heart
[1:05:59] not because I want to say it not for me
[1:06:01] but because the bride has a craving for
[1:06:03] a certain thing and that craving is fed
[1:06:05] by the word of
[1:06:07] God
[1:06:09] Amen Hallelujah maybe you didn't even
[1:06:11] know you wanted
[1:06:14] it all of a sudden you get to hear in
[1:06:16] the word he said that's exactly what I
[1:06:18] needed why is that because there was
[1:06:20] something inside of you that that is
[1:06:22] building God's creating himself a body
[1:06:25] and amen he said the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:06:27] created his own bride amen he said that
[1:06:30] he said that would not have produced the
[1:06:32] last atom of him it was said l a body
[1:06:34] hast thou father prepared for me God not
[1:06:37] Mary provided that body Mary was the
[1:06:41] human incubator and she carried that
[1:06:42] holy child and brought him to birth it
[1:06:44] was a God man he was the son of God he
[1:06:47] was the New Creation man and God met and
[1:06:50] join he was the first of this new race
[1:06:53] he is the head of this new race
[1:06:57] amen not a black race or a white race a
[1:07:00] god
[1:07:01] race Colossians 118 it says and he is
[1:07:04] the head of the body the church who was
[1:07:07] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:07:08] dead that in all things he might have
[1:07:12] the preeminence Ephesians 2:10 for we
[1:07:14] are his
[1:07:18] workmanship brother Mark made this
[1:07:21] Pulpit you know there's there's got to
[1:07:23] be a certain amount of of pride in that
[1:07:26] brother Mark not giving you Pride but
[1:07:28] you know you look at that say I made
[1:07:32] that I I've got a I'm not very good at
[1:07:35] working things up like that I've got
[1:07:38] this bookshelf that I put together
[1:07:40] myself at the
[1:07:42] house it's never made me want to look
[1:07:44] but Jo say I made
[1:07:47] that in fact Esther tried to move it and
[1:07:50] it come
[1:07:53] apart come home me with the pieces we
[1:07:55] sitting in the living room you don't
[1:07:57] know how many hours it took me to put
[1:07:58] that thing
[1:08:00] together but see we are his
[1:08:03] workmanship when he comes by he looks at
[1:08:05] it he says that's
[1:08:08] nice don't you want God to be able to
[1:08:10] say that about
[1:08:11] you he looks at and say it's been
[1:08:13] through a lot it's battered it's worn
[1:08:16] but but it's mine amen I've worked
[1:08:19] something in it that workmanship he's
[1:08:21] working what's he creating he's not
[1:08:22] creating better hands and a better
[1:08:24] looking face what's he creating love joy
[1:08:27] peace longsuffering amen gentleness
[1:08:30] kindness he's creating that creating it
[1:08:34] in us look we are his workmanship
[1:08:37] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:08:40] which God has before ordained that we
[1:08:43] should walk in them so yes we do good
[1:08:44] works but we do it because we've been
[1:08:46] created to do
[1:08:48] that this this Pulpit was created for a
[1:08:51] purpose we've been created to for a
[1:08:54] purpose by God we are his
[1:08:57] workmanship Ephesians 4:24 says put on
[1:09:00] the new man which after God is created
[1:09:03] after God or like God he's created in
[1:09:05] righteousness and true
[1:09:08] Holiness an exposition of seven Church
[1:09:10] ages that new creation brother BR says
[1:09:12] it's not the old creation made over or
[1:09:14] it could not be called a new
[1:09:16] creation this is exactly what what it
[1:09:19] says it is a new creation he said it is
[1:09:21] another creation distinct from the old
[1:09:24] one now listen to this no longer is he
[1:09:28] dealing by ways of the
[1:09:30] flesh now anytime we have a
[1:09:33] problem we begin to think of ways to
[1:09:36] solve it God don't deal by ways of the
[1:09:39] flesh Abraham had a
[1:09:41] problem the baby wasn't being born he
[1:09:44] told everybody they were going to have a
[1:09:45] baby had a problem and so his wife got a
[1:09:47] little antsy she said well maybe I'm not
[1:09:49] a part of
[1:09:51] it Sarah got get a little antsy so she
[1:09:53] said why don't you go take Hagar
[1:09:56] and so Abraham agreed and he went and
[1:09:57] took Hagar what happened a wild man was
[1:10:00] born what what was it brother BR said it
[1:10:03] was the seed of a slightly doubted
[1:10:05] promise he was dealing by ways of the
[1:10:08] flesh attempting to make the promise
[1:10:10] come to pass we have to be careful with
[1:10:13] that because you can try to make you say
[1:10:15] well we need more Prophecy in the church
[1:10:16] we need more tongues we need more
[1:10:17] interpretation if you try to make it
[1:10:19] come to pass it's going to end up a seed
[1:10:21] of
[1:10:22] discrepancy right he don't deal by ways
[1:10:24] of the flesh God does what he wants to
[1:10:27] do that's how he dealt with this girl he
[1:10:29] don't deal because I go and to every one
[1:10:31] of you and and set you in order and
[1:10:33] build you up no I preach the word and
[1:10:34] God does the work uh whoever's behind
[1:10:37] the pulpit with brother Allen brother
[1:10:39] Stewart one of the other ministers they
[1:10:40] preach the word God does the work he's
[1:10:43] not dealing by ways of the flesh that
[1:10:45] was how he dealt with Israel he chose
[1:10:46] Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through
[1:10:48] The Godly Isaac line he said but now out
[1:10:51] of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has
[1:10:53] purposed a new
[1:10:56] creation he has purposed a new
[1:11:00] creation and he is the first of that
[1:11:02] creation that's what Christmas is it's
[1:11:05] not just a baby and a Manger but God was
[1:11:07] born it means I can be born
[1:11:10] again amen he was created in the
[1:11:12] fullness of the attributes of God I can
[1:11:14] be created in His
[1:11:16] image amen he said he is the first of
[1:11:20] that creation he was God created in the
[1:11:21] form of man now by his Spirit he's
[1:11:23] creating many sons un to himself God the
[1:11:26] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:11:30] creation amen this is the true
[1:11:33] revelation of God this was his purpose
[1:11:37] this purpose took form through
[1:11:40] election amen that's why he could look
[1:11:42] right down he said to the last age when
[1:11:45] all would be over amen I love this he
[1:11:49] looked down to the end when all would be
[1:11:50] over the last messenger would come and
[1:11:52] go and everything was finished he looked
[1:11:54] down to that last stage and see
[1:11:56] himself in the midst of the church still
[1:12:00] in the midst of the
[1:12:01] church
[1:12:03] amen there could be Corona virus there
[1:12:05] could be War there could be rumors of
[1:12:07] War there could be political trouble
[1:12:09] there could be sicknesses there could be
[1:12:10] death there could be problems in the
[1:12:12] church it could be anything but he is
[1:12:14] still in the midst of his
[1:12:16] church well how could he look down and
[1:12:19] see himself still in the midst of the
[1:12:21] church because he is the author of this
[1:12:23] new creation of God
[1:12:25] he built it himself he knows the
[1:12:28] hurricane wind can't tear it down he
[1:12:30] knows that it it'll last remember when
[1:12:33] the man built the Titanic he said even
[1:12:34] God himself couldn't sink this ship they
[1:12:36] found out that wasn't true they found
[1:12:38] out God could sink that ship but when
[1:12:40] God built himself a body amen death
[1:12:43] itself couldn't hold
[1:12:45] him amen when he created himself a body
[1:12:48] when he built himself a tabernacle they
[1:12:50] hung him on a cross he was died so much
[1:12:52] the sun and the Stars everything else
[1:12:54] said he was dead but he rose again on
[1:12:55] the third day why because he was the
[1:12:57] Tabernacle of God God he said I will not
[1:13:01] suffer my Holy One to see corruption he
[1:13:02] would not leave his Creation in in the
[1:13:05] grave and if you are a new creation you
[1:13:08] will not remain in the
[1:13:10] grave
[1:13:12] amen hallelujah how could you remain in
[1:13:15] dead trespasses and sins and be a new
[1:13:17] creation of God you can't you can't do
[1:13:21] it he created something new something
[1:13:25] that wants to serve
[1:13:26] him
[1:13:28] amen when all is over he could look
[1:13:31] right down to the last stage and see
[1:13:34] himself
[1:13:35] still in the midst of the church as
[1:13:38] author of the new creation of God his
[1:13:40] Sovereign power brought it to pass by
[1:13:43] his own decree he elected the members of
[1:13:47] this new creation I might not have chose
[1:13:49] you you might not have chose me but it
[1:13:50] was
[1:13:52] him by his own decree he elected the
[1:13:55] members of this new creation he
[1:13:56] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:13:59] children according to the good pleasure
[1:14:02] of his
[1:14:03] will by his omniscience and omnipotence
[1:14:06] he brought it to pass I went back and
[1:14:09] found a commentary where he talks in
[1:14:11] John about how that he in the beginning
[1:14:14] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:14:15] and the Word was God the word created
[1:14:17] all things it talks about that and and
[1:14:19] the commentator looked at that and he
[1:14:20] said well he must be the
[1:14:22] father the word must be the father
[1:14:25] because you couldn't have two omnipotent
[1:14:27] beings with the power of
[1:14:30] creation amen it would have to be a part
[1:14:32] of that I said and he was a trinitarian
[1:14:34] but I thought he he's on to something
[1:14:36] he's on to something the word would have
[1:14:38] to be the father because he's omnipotent
[1:14:40] if you're on brother B talked about two
[1:14:41] omnipotence meeting but you've got to be
[1:14:43] a part of God to be
[1:14:44] omnipotent to be that omnipotent to have
[1:14:46] that seat you've got to be a part of the
[1:14:49] word are you with me this
[1:14:51] morning amen he's the only one that
[1:14:55] could do that by his omniscience and
[1:14:57] omnipotence he brought it to pass how
[1:14:59] else could he know that he would be
[1:15:01] standing in the midst of the church
[1:15:03] receiving Glory from his Brethren if he
[1:15:06] did not make
[1:15:09] sure how did he know that it would last
[1:15:13] because he made
[1:15:16] sure how did he know he would be
[1:15:19] standing in the midst of the church and
[1:15:21] there would still be a
[1:15:23] church he made sure
[1:15:26] and that's why it don't bother me you
[1:15:28] say well people people fall oh preachers
[1:15:30] preach things that are wrong some of
[1:15:31] them leave the message even but God will
[1:15:34] have a
[1:15:35] church and he'll have workmen building
[1:15:38] in that church until he
[1:15:40] comes he he built it he's sure of it you
[1:15:43] may not be sure of it but God
[1:15:45] sure amen listen he said how could he be
[1:15:50] standing how would he know that he'd be
[1:15:52] standing in the midst of the church
[1:15:53] receiving Glory from his Brethren if he
[1:15:54] did not make sure all things he knew
[1:15:58] listen and all things he worked out
[1:16:02] according to what he
[1:16:05] knew all things that's hard for us to
[1:16:08] take brother Isaac all
[1:16:12] things I've often wondered why I had to
[1:16:14] be born the way I was and come up the
[1:16:16] way I was and all things he worked
[1:16:19] out according to what he
[1:16:22] knew I wouldn't have done
[1:16:25] things the way that we've done them this
[1:16:26] this year wouldn't have done them at all
[1:16:28] the way we've done it we've done it
[1:16:30] because God works things out all things
[1:16:33] he knew he knew there would be a
[1:16:35] pandemic he knew there would we would we
[1:16:38] would be remodeling he knew things would
[1:16:40] happen the way that they did all things
[1:16:42] he worked out according to what he knew
[1:16:46] and some of you that are older can look
[1:16:47] back at your life and say all things he
[1:16:49] worked out according to what he knew and
[1:16:52] it gives you confidence you know you can
[1:16:53] you're going to make it
[1:16:56] your body might get weak and you might
[1:16:57] get you might be about one foot in the
[1:17:00] grave and one foot on a banana pill but
[1:17:02] all things he worked out amen according
[1:17:06] to what he
[1:17:08] knew don't you see he knew the devil
[1:17:10] would be here to lie steal kill and
[1:17:12] destroy he knew what age would be he
[1:17:14] wasn't surprised by what's going on he
[1:17:16] worked out according to what he knew he
[1:17:19] worked out all these
[1:17:20] things in order that his purpose and
[1:17:23] good pleasure be brought to
[1:17:26] pass Ephesians 1:11 puts it this way in
[1:17:29] whom also we have obtained an
[1:17:32] inheritance being predestinated
[1:17:34] according to the purpose of him who
[1:17:36] worketh all
[1:17:37] things how many things all
[1:17:40] things after the counsel of his own
[1:17:45] will he doesn't have to borrow materials
[1:17:48] he doesn't have to ask anybody he
[1:17:50] doesn't have to find out what the future
[1:17:53] holds
[1:17:56] he works all things after the counsel of
[1:18:00] his
[1:18:01] own
[1:18:03] will then what are
[1:18:05] you you're a creation of
[1:18:08] God then I can have confidence you might
[1:18:11] fail I might I might fail I might say
[1:18:14] something that wouldn't be exactly right
[1:18:16] and I'd have to come back and repent for
[1:18:17] that pray to God I wouldn't but I might
[1:18:19] do
[1:18:20] that I might do that I might fail you in
[1:18:22] some
[1:18:23] way but he'll work all things
[1:18:26] out Court after the counsel of his own
[1:18:33] will there was a a man we're getting
[1:18:36] close to Christmas time
[1:18:38] and was a man who invited Christ to
[1:18:40] dinner one time he was a cobbler in
[1:18:44] Germany he uh was real sincere and he
[1:18:47] thought Lord I don't have anything to
[1:18:50] give you don't have any family don't
[1:18:52] have anybody around me so I think this
[1:18:54] year
[1:18:55] instead of having treats and and party
[1:19:00] put up a tree I I just invite you to
[1:19:02] come and eat with me he didn't have
[1:19:05] anybody
[1:19:07] else so he made a roast of the lamb and
[1:19:10] made a real nice
[1:19:13] Feast said Lord we're eating at at six
[1:19:16] o'clock whatever it
[1:19:18] was that day he's cooking everything up
[1:19:22] come a knock on the door
[1:19:24] there's a little girl there that lost
[1:19:26] her way and she didn't know where her
[1:19:30] mama was and and she'd been lost and
[1:19:34] she'd come in he fed her a little bit
[1:19:35] and helped her find her mother still
[1:19:37] waiting on the Lord to show up it began
[1:19:40] to be very late and the time passed here
[1:19:42] come a a a lady an old lady that needed
[1:19:46] somewhere just to stop and rest for a
[1:19:48] while she said do you have anything to
[1:19:49] eat said well I have a guest coming over
[1:19:51] but guess I could spare a little bit and
[1:19:52] he gave her a little bit and pretty soon
[1:19:55] there come an old beggar D dressed in
[1:19:57] rags he' come knocking on the
[1:20:00] door and the man sitting inside said
[1:20:02] Lord where are you I invited you to come
[1:20:04] you said you'd come where you were
[1:20:06] invited and it may seem like a
[1:20:07] simplistic thing see sometimes we make
[1:20:09] it we make it too we make it too
[1:20:11] spiritual in some at times we do it's
[1:20:14] such a simple thing we invite him to
[1:20:17] come he he said Lord you said you would
[1:20:20] honor me with your presence I I felt
[1:20:23] your spirit and that you would come when
[1:20:26] I invited you and and yet you're not
[1:20:28] here this beggar knocked on the door and
[1:20:31] rags and he finally fed him the rest of
[1:20:33] the meal made sure he had a something
[1:20:36] warm and some food to take with him and
[1:20:39] a coat to hang on him and finally sent
[1:20:41] him out the door and he got down on his
[1:20:42] knees he said Lord you didn't come you
[1:20:45] promised he didn't come he said yes I
[1:20:47] did I was the little girl I was the old
[1:20:52] lady I was the beggar
[1:20:55] God built himself a
[1:20:57] house and came down and sat down and ate
[1:21:01] dinner three different times with the
[1:21:04] man who wanted to eat dinner with
[1:21:06] him we may think it's something little
[1:21:09] when we can do something for a member of
[1:21:11] the body of Christ someone and we don't
[1:21:13] know who that is always let me tell you
[1:21:18] something last night I was
[1:21:20] here about
[1:21:23] 5:30 and we put up cameras and stuff
[1:21:25] because I'm
[1:21:26] forgetful and there's always people
[1:21:28] stopping by and you can't give everybody
[1:21:30] that comes by something because it just
[1:21:32] gets to be too much and but I would stop
[1:21:35] it you know every once a while people
[1:21:36] people come in because it's a church
[1:21:38] they'll just walk in the
[1:21:39] door and so a lot of times I'll be in my
[1:21:42] office and somebody will come in but I
[1:21:44] was working in here on the sound system
[1:21:46] last night about 5:30 and I was getting
[1:21:48] a little mopy but Joe and him had just
[1:21:50] left they helped us clean up and I was
[1:21:52] getting a little bit mopy because I
[1:21:53] wasn't ready for day I didn't have
[1:21:56] everything prepared the way I wanted it
[1:21:57] and and I'm trying to prepare and finish
[1:22:00] setting up the sound we still didn't
[1:22:01] have it right this morning when we
[1:22:02] started we had to fix some things so I I
[1:22:06] was working on all that and Peter was
[1:22:07] here with me and a man just walked in
[1:22:10] the door as a young
[1:22:12] man and he might be listening this
[1:22:14] morning I gave him our card and and
[1:22:16] showed him how to watch the
[1:22:18] services but he and his wife had stopped
[1:22:21] by he said we've been driving by the
[1:22:22] church he said to go fishing every once
[1:22:26] in a while he said we see the church
[1:22:27] there we want to know what kind of
[1:22:29] church it was he said so I saw the light
[1:22:31] on and I thought I'd walk in and he said
[1:22:34] because it looked like you were
[1:22:36] open I said I guess we're
[1:22:40] open I got to talking to him and he
[1:22:42] didn't want money he wanted to know
[1:22:44] about God he wanted to know about about
[1:22:47] what we believed and and he'd been
[1:22:49] studying the scriptures and you could
[1:22:50] tell he he'd been studying and wanted to
[1:22:52] know those things and he asked me just
[1:22:55] out of the blue because I'd been get to
[1:22:56] talk to him about what we believed and
[1:22:58] just kind of tell him what kind of a
[1:23:00] church that we were and he told me he
[1:23:02] said I hadn't say anything about a
[1:23:04] prophet he said he said Do you believe
[1:23:06] God still has prophets I said let let me
[1:23:09] tell you about a
[1:23:11] prophet and I got to witness to the the
[1:23:13] message to someone for about 30 minutes
[1:23:15] standing back in the foyer last
[1:23:17] night well his wife waited in the
[1:23:19] car I thought God you work all things
[1:23:23] according to the counsel of your
[1:23:25] will see God might come by in a in a
[1:23:30] place in an image that we don't expect
[1:23:33] him and that might be an opportunity to
[1:23:35] minister to somebody I don't know you
[1:23:37] don't know how but somebody else knows
[1:23:39] that had no knowledge of the message
[1:23:41] last night somebody else knows
[1:23:44] today you see why it's important to keep
[1:23:46] the church open we can say it that way
[1:23:49] we can't be here all the time but we're
[1:23:50] the
[1:23:52] church we got to keep the church open
[1:23:54] see if you close yourself off and you
[1:23:56] won't talk to nobody and and you get to
[1:23:58] a point where you've been so hurt that
[1:23:59] you just stay to yourself but don't you
[1:24:01] see the church has to stay
[1:24:03] open so that if somebody comes by a
[1:24:06] beggar come and knock on the door you
[1:24:07] could give him some clothes so if a a
[1:24:09] person come wanting to know about a
[1:24:10] prophet you can tell him about a
[1:24:15] prophet you see you see what I'm saying
[1:24:17] this morning God built himself a house
[1:24:20] we're his house and he he's caused us to
[1:24:22] have this ministry this word of reconcil
[1:24:24] ation so that a new creation can be born
[1:24:27] in someone else God doesn't do anything
[1:24:30] by accident you're not here this morning
[1:24:32] by accident bow your heads with me if
[1:24:33] you will you're not here by accident
[1:24:36] today God builds himself a
[1:24:40] house you don't
[1:24:43] know you don't know why things are the
[1:24:45] way that they are I don't know why
[1:24:46] things are the way that they
[1:24:48] are but maybe that that person that you
[1:24:53] gave that furniture to those close to or
[1:24:55] maybe that was God reaching out to his
[1:24:58] children you don't know who they are you
[1:25:01] don't know who all the elect are I don't
[1:25:02] know God
[1:25:04] knows and if there's going to be a
[1:25:06] church here God will build himself a
[1:25:10] house I believe that you're born again
[1:25:12] this morning that you're Christians that
[1:25:14] new creation's been birthed inside of
[1:25:16] you if if that's the case this morning
[1:25:19] would you just ask God Lord help me to
[1:25:22] be Lord more like like you help me to be
[1:25:26] the kind of a house that's
[1:25:28] open that the door would be open so that
[1:25:30] if somebody come knocking on it this
[1:25:32] Christmas I'd be there it wouldn't be
[1:25:34] all about the the money and the presents
[1:25:36] and the things but there would just be
[1:25:37] something in my heart I'd want to give
[1:25:39] to you Lord it be something there that I
[1:25:43] could say Lord my house is open to the
[1:25:45] beggar to the old woman to the little
[1:25:47] girl I want to be able to see you in my
[1:25:49] neighbor I want to be able to see you in
[1:25:51] in the person I go to church with the
[1:25:53] person that may not be the best best
[1:25:55] singer the best person in the church
[1:25:58] maybe maybe in the past they've done
[1:26:00] things that aren't right but Lord help
[1:26:02] me to see you in that new
[1:26:05] creation Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:26:08] for meeting us here
[1:26:11] today sometimes Lord you get us out of
[1:26:13] our comfort zone so that you can just
[1:26:16] you could just come down and and speak
[1:26:19] to us
[1:26:20] directly I pray that that would be the
[1:26:22] case today
[1:26:24] Lord I I was so convicted myself last
[1:26:28] night Lord if you give me the
[1:26:30] opportunity to witness to somebody what
[1:26:32] a what an opportunity that is I've
[1:26:33] traveled thousands of miles to speak to
[1:26:36] people about the gospel about this
[1:26:38] message you gave me the opportunity to
[1:26:40] do it right here at the church last
[1:26:42] night God would you just help us to look
[1:26:44] for those opportunities and to be that
[1:26:47] house maybe not with
[1:26:49] words as someone has said preach
[1:26:52] everywhere when when you need to use
[1:26:55] words oh God would you just let our
[1:26:58] lives be a Shining Light and example of
[1:27:00] what you are May our doors always be
[1:27:03] opened may we not close them off with
[1:27:06] pride or jealousy or hurt or anger
[1:27:10] frustration may we be ready and always
[1:27:12] willing to give an answer for the hope
[1:27:14] that lays within us I pray you'd Grant
[1:27:16] it Lord we thank you for this house
[1:27:19] thank you for the place you provided for
[1:27:21] us to worship you it's not about these
