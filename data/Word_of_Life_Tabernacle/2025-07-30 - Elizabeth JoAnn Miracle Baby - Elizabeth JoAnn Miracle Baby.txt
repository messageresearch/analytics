[Music] So, as I was writing this out to try and condense it all, it really just impacted me of how many things went into this testimony. Little things that if we told it all, it would take all day, but I tried to condense it as best I could. Um, our testimony really begins um when we got married in uh 2022. I had rheumatoid arthritis. Um, and due to the medications I was on, we couldn't have a baby because of the side effects, what would happen to the baby. Um, and that really that really grieved us and there was no way for me to get off the medication because of how severe the RA was. Well, Gabe started really praying and claiming that at the July meetings, I would be healed of RA. And we went through the prayer line and God miraculously healed me. I never had to take another medication, no pain after that. Then in 2023, we were told that we would not be able to have a baby and if we wanted to try, it would take extensive um intervention from the medical field. That really broke our hearts. Well, again, it was in the spring when that we were told that. So that summer, we went through the prayer line again. We claimed our healing. We claimed our promised baby. We picked out a name and we held on to faith that we would hold our child during the journey and the wait for that cuz it is a journey. We lost two. But we rejoiced that they even existed because their lives were a testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we did get pregnant. We did have babies. During the journey of that time, there was so many things that God sent us. So many just pastors or preachers doing sermons or encouragement to help us through that time of struggle. We finally were pregnant with our Lizzy. During the pregnancy, we had a really hard time, both her and I. Satan really fought us, but God was faithful. Then she was born, and we rejoiced thinking that it was over. She we had her in our arms. She was safe. But three days later, we were in the NICU. This was the hardest three days of the whole journey. There was a point where we were in the Ronald McDonald home and Lizzie was down in her room and we were just praying and crying out to God just pleading and kind of upset after everything. Here we were and the song came back to me and the story of Isaac and Abraham and Isaac had to lay his child on the altar to give it back to the Lord knowing that he could lose that child. He had to get to that point to where he was okay in a sense of I know you'll get me through somehow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Gabe and I prayed and we just told the Lord, you know, you gave her to us and we rejoiced that we held our promised baby and if you take her, we don't know how, but we know it'll be okay. Little did we know in the room Lizzie was having one of the hardest episodes she had had and there was just this pressure to go down to her and we rushed into her room and right behind us a nurse and a doctor had come in but as soon as we stepped in the room she stabilized and it was over. she didn't have another issue that we went to the ENT and he was like she might have it, she might not, but we just praise the Lord know that she was healed that night. &gt;&gt; Again, there was just so many little things that happened and if I went into it all, it would take all day. But we just want to thank the Lord for Elizabeth Joanne and her name means God's promise or his oath and God's grace and she is a true representation of that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; His word cannot fail. because that you have said this, because that you have witnessed that you believe it, I'm going to believe this with all my heart and say, "God almighty makes you well." &gt;&gt; Cuz I know it's a scripture. It's the truth. I believe that every person comes through the line will be made totally well. &gt;&gt; Now, what do you do with it? You don't doubt it. You hold it right before you. Your token, what is your token? the Holy Spirit in your heart. You pass through that line. It has to happen. There's no wait for it. No matter how many you've been through before, this is it. This is the hour. This is the time. It's over. It's settled. Just forget you ever was sick or ever had it, ever afflicted or anything. God will take care of it for you. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it with all my
