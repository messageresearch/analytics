[15:59] going to stay on the chemo and stuff for
[16:00] six more weeks and his kidneys are not
[16:03] getting rid of the toxins in the body
[16:05] like they need to. So, he wanted to uh I

[16:11] kidneys. Amen. And just make them work
[16:14] like they should.

[16:24] years old. Uh he was born with a real
[16:26] rare heart disease. uh uh like real
[16:30] small
[16:31] arteries or something real like 3% of
[16:34] the population. Uh and he's he's uh
[16:37] battled through it, stayed strong, and
[16:39] he's about 23 years old now, but he had
[16:41] a a routine calath uh and it and it
[16:46] caused him to have a stroke.
[16:48] U and then he had a had to remove a
[16:50] blood blood clot from the right side of
[16:53] his brain. So been very groggy today.
[16:56] And they said uh just a minute ago that
[16:58] his CT had come back with no additional
[17:00] swelling. Uh he was sleepy and groggy,
[17:03] but he's left side is weak, but at least
[17:05] he's able to move it. He u he couldn't
[17:08] move it at all. They're saying there's a
[17:11] 1% chance of the clot breaking off
[17:13] during the calf. So, uh we believe the
[17:16] Lord was with him. Amen. On that. So,
[17:17] let's just continue that young man.

[33:24] the word. You may be seated. Amen. And
[33:27] so Paul here is is preaching and he's
[33:30] telling the people or he's talking to
[33:32] the people here and and he's telling uh
[33:35] not to uh not not to look to the things
[33:38] that are behind. Amen. But to reach
[33:40] forth unto the things which are before.
[33:43] How many knows that to be true? Amen. If
[33:45] you're looking in the rearview mirror, a
[33:47] prophet of God would tell us, you're
[33:48] sure to wreck up. If you're sure to
[33:50] you're sure to if you're always looking
[33:51] in the past and you're always looking at
[33:53] the things that have been or the way
[33:54] things used to be or uh or the or or or
[33:58] whether it be good or bad. If you're
[33:59] always looking in the in the rearview
[34:01] mirror, you cannot see what's in front
[34:04] of you. Amen. But we are to reach forth
[34:06] unto those things which are before. Can
[34:09] you say amen here tonight? And in the
[34:11] next verse in verse 14, he would say,"I
[34:13] press toward the mark for the prize of
[34:16] the high calling of God in Christ
[34:18] Jesus." And so there's something that
[34:21] we're pressing towards. We're pressing
[34:23] forward. Amen. Two. And we're not
[34:25] looking back. Brother Brandon would say,
[34:27] but we're looking forward to the
[34:28] breaking of a new day until there is
[34:30] something great laying ahead of us where
[34:32] the years has been the joy that we've
[34:34] been look that we've looked forward to.
[34:36] Amen. The pressing coming of the great
[34:38] light. He said, "Now we can see it
[34:40] breaking over the horizon." He said,
[34:41] "It's breaking between mortal and
[34:43] immortality. We see it breaking between
[34:45] heavens and earth from an earthbound
[34:47] sickness and troubled world into a
[34:49] bright shining day of an immortal life."
[34:52] And I mean, you can look around you. You
[34:53] can see trouble on every hand. You can
[34:55] see the the the world is totally insane.
[34:58] Can you say amen? Amen. You can look at
[34:59] the news today and see, amen, that the
[35:01] the the the wickedness of the people in
[35:04] this hour. And you can see the things
[35:05] that are going on. But I want you to
[35:07] know, we're not looking to those things,
[35:09] amen, for salvation. We're not looking
[35:11] to those things, amen, as a believer,
[35:13] but we're looking for something great
[35:15] that is to come. Amen. Those things are
[35:18] troubling. Those things are are
[35:19] perplexing of times and the things that
[35:21] are happening, but those things are not
[35:23] Amen. Those things are not the things
[35:24] that Amen. We're not looking for those
[35:26] things as a as something for the
[35:28] believer. Amen. Although we see the
[35:30] world going down, we see it getting
[35:32] darker. We see it getting worse and
[35:33] worse. Amen. But the believer is
[35:35] looking, amen, for that great shining
[35:37] new day that is coming. Amen. We are
[35:39] pressing forward to the mark. Can you
[35:42] say amen here tonight? Brother Brandon
[35:44] would say it's shalom unto the church.
[35:46] It's a it's a light time coming for the
[35:48] believers, but a gross darkness for the
[35:50] people. Amen. But now, I want you to
[35:52] notice for the for the believer to
[35:54] overcome and for the believer to to
[35:57] reach their destination, there's got to
[35:59] be a desire in order to reach what we're
[36:02] looking for. Amen. There's got to be a
[36:04] desire to attain, amen, the thing that
[36:07] we are going towards. And so when we see
[36:09] the mark, you say, "Brother Joel," Amen.
[36:11] What are we looking for? What is the
[36:12] thing ahead of us? Amen. What? It looks
[36:14] pretty bleak for the world. It is a
[36:16] bleak day for the world. It is a bleak
[36:18] time. It is a It is a time of distress
[36:20] between nations. It is a time, amen,
[36:22] where brothers against brother and
[36:24] sisters against sister and and there's
[36:26] all kinds of political agendas and
[36:28] things going on in the world. Amen. But
[36:29] there is a goal that the believer has in
[36:32] mind and that is what we are pressing
[36:34] towards. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[36:36] We are we're saddened by the things that
[36:38] happen in this earth. Amen. But those
[36:40] things are those things are are are
[36:42] prophesied to come. Amen. There would be
[36:43] a a time that would that would be so
[36:45] dark that would you wouldn't know if it
[36:47] was day or night. Amen. It would be so
[36:48] black upon the earth. Amen. But we are
[36:50] not looking as as a believer. You don't
[36:53] look and say, "Well, that's my future
[36:54] and and we're going down with this
[36:56] world." No, sir. Amen. We are going up
[36:58] as a bride of Jesus Christ. We're not
[37:00] going down. Amen. Our goal is not to be
[37:02] earthbound. Our goal is not to stay
[37:04] here. Our goal is not to be amen the
[37:07] next person that that that would be the
[37:08] the the richest man in the earth or or
[37:10] or the or have a big name here on the
[37:13] earth. But our goal is to be in a
[37:14] rapture. Can you say amen? And so,
[37:17] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[37:18] He said, "Notice." Amen. The word cannot
[37:20] deny itself. Amen. And that it is
[37:22] satisfied. It's a desire. It's a desire
[37:24] of what? What made you desire it in the
[37:27] first place? Because down in your soul,
[37:28] there was a predestinated seed which was
[37:32] eternal life, always laying in there,
[37:34] always was in there. All that the father
[37:37] has given me will come to me. There
[37:39] isn't any of them going to be lost. So
[37:42] before you knew you had a desire to
[37:44] serve God, there was a desire. Before
[37:46] you knew there was a desire to run this
[37:48] race, there was a come on church. There
[37:50] was something on the inside of you that
[37:52] actually gave you a desire to be an
[37:55] overcomer. There was something on the
[37:57] inside of you that gave you a desire to
[37:59] win. There was something on the inside
[38:01] of Paul that even when he was in a
[38:03] condition of murdering Christians and
[38:05] even when he was in a condition, amen,
[38:07] in a in a place where it didn't look
[38:09] like he could be saved, there was a
[38:10] desire that was always there, amen, to
[38:13] run the race. And there was always a
[38:15] desire there, amen, to overcome. There
[38:17] was always a desire in Paul to attain
[38:20] those things which were in the future.
[38:22] Can the church say amen? Amen. Listen,
[38:25] Paul didn't know it when he was when he
[38:26] was a sinner. Paul didn't know it when
[38:28] he was when he was in his past condition
[38:30] and in an evil state. Amen. But when he
[38:32] became when he came in contact with God
[38:35] and he came into the presence of the
[38:36] Lord. Amen. Then he could say, "I'm not
[38:38] looking for the to the things that are
[38:40] in the past. I'm not looking to the way
[38:42] I used to be. I'm not looking to the
[38:44] things that used to define me, but I
[38:46] press toward the mark. And that's what
[38:49] the believers are doing here tonight.
[38:50] Amen. You can say, "Well, look at where
[38:52] I've been." I told you last week, look
[38:54] at what I've done. Look at where I've
[38:55] been. Amen. But those things do not
[38:57] define you. Amen. In your walk with the
[39:00] Lord. Amen. Those things are just we we
[39:02] talked about it a little bit in last
[39:03] week that they are they are actually
[39:05] blocks that you can step on and and
[39:07] stone stepping stones that you can you
[39:09] can you can press towards and but when
[39:11] you start looking in the rearview mirror
[39:13] and you start looking to how you used to
[39:15] be and you start looking to the way
[39:17] things used to be. Amen. Then you start
[39:19] saying, "Well, I wish we could go back."
[39:21] The minute you go back, you're right
[39:23] back where you started and you've lost
[39:24] all your progress. But I think it's time
[39:27] as the church we quit looking to the way
[39:28] things used to be. What are things right
[39:30] now? Amen. What is my connection between
[39:33] God right now? Amen. Am I overcoming
[39:35] today? Amen. What's tomorrow going to
[39:37] look like? I don't know. But in the
[39:38] present, I can tell you that I will
[39:40] press on towards the mark. Amen. I'm not
[39:43] going to look back and say, "Well,
[39:44] brother Joel failed last year. Yes, I
[39:46] may have failed last year and I might
[39:48] fail. I may have failed yesterday. Amen.
[39:51] But tomorrow and the next day, I'm going
[39:53] to keep pressing because I know that
[39:55] there was something on the inside of me
[39:57] that gave me a desire to not give up, to
[40:00] not turn around, but to press forward.
[40:03] Amen. I think that's the thing for the
[40:04] church tonight. Amen. That we've got to
[40:06] have a desire. How many here want a
[40:08] desire? Amen. I believe you have a
[40:10] desire, but we want more. Amen. We want
[40:12] more of God. Why? Because there is more
[40:14] of God. Amen. That we can get to. Amen.
[40:17] There is more of God in my future.
[40:19] There's there there come on church.
[40:20] Amen. There's a whole lot less falling
[40:22] down in my future because why? I'm
[40:24] learning every time I fall that I can
[40:26] get back up. Amen. I'm every time I
[40:28] overcome I get stronger and stronger.
[40:30] Amen. Your body might get weaker. Amen.
[40:32] You might get down in your in your body
[40:34] but amen. But every day you are becoming
[40:36] stronger in the things of God. Why?
[40:38] Because God has placed a desire in you
[40:40] to overcome. And you will not give up.
[40:43] And you will not bow down to the things
[40:45] of the world. And you will not fall
[40:46] away. Why? Because God has placed a
[40:48] desire in you. Amen. And David would say
[40:50] like this, "One thing have I desired of
[40:52] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[40:54] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[40:56] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[40:58] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[41:00] temple." Now, that wasn't David saying
[41:02] what he wanted to do. Amen. But it was a
[41:04] desire that God had placed in him. Amen.
[41:06] And that was the thing he would seek
[41:07] after. Amen. So if God has placed a
[41:10] desire in you to be an overcomer in this
[41:12] age, then it is time that you go ahead
[41:14] and fulfill the desire and be an
[41:16] overcomer. Amen. It doesn't matter how
[41:18] Come on, church. Amen. Every time we we
[41:21] look around at all of our failings and
[41:22] every time we look around at all of the
[41:24] the the the the complexes and things and
[41:26] we start saying, "Well, woe is me." Or,
[41:28] "I wish I could just give up and give
[41:30] in." Amen. It's not time to give up.
[41:32] Amen. I believe we're closer than we've
[41:34] ever been. And I believe we're so close
[41:36] to the end time. You can see the signs
[41:38] all around us. You can see the world
[41:40] going into total chaos. And brother
[41:42] Brandham would say even in the in this
[41:44] in the 50s he would say, amen, that the
[41:46] world was totally insane. Amen. What
[41:48] about now? What about 70 years later?
[41:50] Amen. When you can see things like the
[41:52] horrific thing that happened today, come
[41:54] on church. When you see the world in
[41:56] that condition, don't lose hope. Amen.
[41:59] But look up because your redemption is
[42:01] drawing nigh. Amen. when there's wars
[42:03] and rumors of wars and maybe political
[42:05] wars and maybe there's all kinds of wars
[42:07] between come on church. Amen. Well, I'm
[42:09] I'm Democrat. I'm Republican. Amen.
[42:11] They're they're fighting amongst
[42:12] themselves. But if you're caught up in
[42:14] that, it becomes a distraction to you
[42:16] and it takes you off of course of
[42:18] reaching your ultimate goal.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I listen I I I think what
[42:23] we've done is we've become so distracted
[42:26] that when we were we see the prize in
[42:28] front of us. Amen. that we fail to see
[42:30] the that we fail to reach the goal
[42:32] because of distractions and things that
[42:34] are taking us off course.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? I'm a little
[42:38] off my notes. Let me get back on them
[42:39] here if I can. Amen. Brother Brandon
[42:41] would say it like this. He would talk
[42:43] about the the the woman, the Shounomite
[42:45] woman there in the Bible and and the the
[42:47] little boy that died and he said she
[42:50] went and got the husband that he he uh
[42:53] he said, you know, her husband is old
[42:55] and and they have no children. And so
[42:56] Elijah must have saw a vision and said,
[42:58] "Go tell her about the time of life.
[42:59] About a year from now, she'll embrace a
[43:00] child." And she did. She had a little
[43:02] boy. And then the boy died of a heat
[43:04] stroke. And and so then uh when he had
[43:06] died, she took him and laid upon him
[43:08] laid him on Elijah's bed. And what a
[43:10] place to lay him. He said, "Just exactly
[43:12] right. Laid up laid him on Elijah's
[43:14] bed." And she said to the servant,
[43:16] "Standle a mule and go forward and don't
[43:18] stop until I tell you." Now, I want you
[43:20] to notice here in the story. I've used
[43:22] this one before, but I just want to use
[43:23] this here. She knew if she could get to
[43:26] that man, she would find out the reason
[43:28] why. If God could tell him, amen, that
[43:29] the baby was coming and he would bless
[43:31] her with the blessing of God and that
[43:33] her barren womb could bear a son. Surely
[43:35] God could tell her, amen, that the man
[43:36] why he took him. And she said, "Don't
[43:38] you stop till I tell you, go to the man
[43:41] of God." Now, I want you to notice,
[43:42] amen, he was not to stop here and he was
[43:44] not to look over here and say, "Maybe
[43:46] they've got a remedy, or maybe there's a
[43:48] remedy over here, or maybe I need to
[43:50] find a new way to raise the dead." Come
[43:52] on, church. or maybe I need to stop over
[43:54] here and talk to intellectual person
[43:56] here or go over here to this bishop or
[43:58] that bishop. No, she had to get to the
[44:00] man of God. Amen. And distractions were
[44:02] not part of the journey. Amen. But she
[44:04] had to get to where she was going and so
[44:06] is it today. And there's going to be all
[44:08] kinds of men that say the days of
[44:09] miracles has passed and and there's no
[44:11] more there's no more Holy Ghost in the
[44:13] service is no more. Amen. There's no
[44:14] more anointing. Come on, church. Amen.
[44:16] There's no more anointing for you.
[44:18] There's no more healing for you. Amen.
[44:19] There's no more children coming back.
[44:21] There's no more restoration, but we know
[44:23] better because we've seen God restore.
[44:25] We've seen God raise people up and bring
[44:27] them into the newness of life. Amen. God
[44:29] is still God. And what we do is we get
[44:32] distracted and we lose focus that he's
[44:34] always been God.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If when when you see Amen. where
[44:38] you came from, I mean, you look at a
[44:40] journey, I mean, you think of Egypt and
[44:43] you think of the Israelites there in
[44:44] Egypt and and they had a journey that
[44:46] was before them. And when they would get
[44:48] there and they would actually get out
[44:49] into the wilderness, they've already
[44:51] come through. They've already come
[44:52] through all kinds of obstacles and
[44:54] they've already come through. Amen.
[44:55] Pharaoh's army trying to get them at the
[44:57] sea. Amen. They've already overcome that
[44:59] v and they had a victory on the other
[45:00] side and they were dancing and they felt
[45:02] good. Amen. But they kept looking back.
[45:04] I wish I could go back and I wish I
[45:06] could go back to where we we had we had
[45:08] three square meals a day and we could
[45:10] eat and and you know even though we were
[45:11] in bondage, we were happy. Amen. But you
[45:13] know what they failed to realize was
[45:15] ahead was a promised land. Amen. The
[45:17] same God that brought them out of Egypt
[45:19] was going to take them on a journey to
[45:21] the land of promise. Amen. But what the
[45:23] problem was there is they kept looking
[45:25] back and they kept thinking what could
[45:26] have been and they wondered in the
[45:28] wilderness for 40 years because they
[45:30] kept looking back and if they could have
[45:32] ever just got their eyes, amen, on the
[45:34] pillar of fire and quit looking at the
[45:36] things that were that were taking place
[45:38] behind them and quit looking at the
[45:39] problems here in the camp and the sin
[45:41] that was in the camp. Amen. Get your
[45:43] eyes off of that thing and start looking
[45:45] to what God has already prepared for
[45:48] you. Come on, church. Amen. You can look
[45:50] around you. You can see sin on every
[45:51] hand and you can look around at
[45:53] everybody in the church and say, "Well,
[45:54] they don't have the Holy Ghost or this
[45:55] one don't have the Holy Ghost." Amen.
[45:57] But I'm not worried about what somebody
[45:58] else has got. Amen. But what about me?
[46:00] What about my journey? Amen. Am I
[46:02] pressing the mark tonight? Am I going to
[46:05] make it? Yes, I'm going to make it
[46:07] because I'm not giving up, but I will
[46:09] press. Amen. And if Paul had to press
[46:12] and then you've got to press and if Paul
[46:14] had to press and brother Brandham had to
[46:16] press and come on church. I mean it's
[46:18] not it's not a time when you you just
[46:20] get on you you say well I'm saved and
[46:22] God's going to take me on a journey. No.
[46:24] God will take you on that journey. But
[46:26] it requires you to press towards the
[46:28] mark.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; He has already given something in front
[46:31] of you. Amen. He already placed
[46:33] something in front of you. And I believe
[46:35] with all my heart that the mark that we
[46:37] are to press in this day with the
[46:39] message that we have been given is
[46:41] nothing short of a rapture.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I press towards I want a
[46:46] bigger church or I can press towards I
[46:48] want more members or I I can press
[46:50] towards I want a better job. No, I press
[46:52] towards the mark. I press towards the
[46:54] mark. There is a prize there for you.
[46:57] Amen. There is a crown waiting for you,
[46:59] brother Bill. Amen. You've got to press
[47:01] to get there. Can the church say amen?
[47:04] What we need to do is quit looking about
[47:07] what what is the mark and what do I need
[47:08] to get to? No. Our our ultimate goal is
[47:12] a rapture in this day. There is no there
[47:14] is no uh there is no concern of if there
[47:16] will be a rapture. It's when will the
[47:18] rapture take place. It's not a matter of
[47:20] if it'll happen. We know it's going to
[47:22] take place. Come on church. But if you
[47:24] start looking back, you're doing the
[47:25] same thing they did in Luther's day and
[47:27] the same thing they did in Wesley's day
[47:29] and the same thing they did in the
[47:30] Pentecostal age. Can you say amen? But
[47:33] because when when when when Wesley came
[47:35] along and then he he brought new light
[47:37] and and Luther's the people would look
[47:39] back to what Luther had. Amen. They
[47:41] failed to walk in the light that was
[47:42] presented to them. And then when when
[47:44] when the Pentecostal message would come
[47:45] along, they would walk in Wesley's light
[47:48] and forget and and fail to walk in the
[47:50] Pentecostal message that was the partial
[47:52] restoration for that time. But then
[47:54] there would also be a time, amen, when
[47:56] there would be a fullness of the
[47:58] restoration come. And there would be
[48:00] many that would not walk therein because
[48:02] they would look back to the glare of
[48:04] another age. I mean, it wasn't real
[48:06] light, but it was glare. And it was a
[48:08] light for their time. And they could
[48:09] look in the rearview mirror and behind
[48:11] them they could see a glare maybe of a
[48:13] city. You've ever drove down the highway
[48:15] and you go through a big city. You've
[48:17] already went through it. You're on the
[48:18] other side of it. You look in your
[48:20] rearview mirror and you see the lights
[48:21] of the city back there. Amen. But what
[48:23] it is, you're you're just seeing the
[48:24] glare. You're seeing a reflection of it.
[48:26] Amen. But what what you really need to
[48:28] look at is ahead of you. Amen. You're
[48:30] not going to see another city. Let me
[48:32] tell you something tonight. Amen. If
[48:34] you're always looking to what God has
[48:36] done, amen, you're failing to see what
[48:38] God is doing. And if you're always even
[48:40] looking so far in the future, well,
[48:42] God's going to do something great. God's
[48:43] going to do something great. Let me tell
[48:45] you something. Live right now and let
[48:47] look at what God's doing in your life
[48:48] today. Amen. God is not a God a far off,
[48:51] but he is an everpresent help. Amen. He
[48:54] is a guide. He is a man. Amen. He is a
[48:56] guide that has guided you this far.
[48:58] Amen. And if if God could bring you this
[49:00] far, how many believes he can take you
[49:02] all the way home? Amen. But what has got
[49:04] to be in the hearts of the people,
[49:06] what's got to be the desire of the
[49:08] people, Amen, has got to be a desire to
[49:10] press. How many can say, "I press."
[49:12] Amen. I'm not going to give up, but I
[49:14] will press. Can the church say, "Amen."
[49:16] Here tonight, amen. I'm not going to
[49:18] stop for nobody. I'm not going to stop
[49:20] for no war. I'm not going to stop
[49:21] because the world's going down. No,
[49:23] serve. This bride will keep on pressing.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a there was a woman with
[49:29] an issue of blood and she pressed
[49:31] through the crowd because she knew if
[49:33] she could get to Jesus, it'd be all
[49:35] right. And her faith could touch him.
[49:37] And I want you to know that that same
[49:39] faith that she had is the same faith it
[49:41] takes. Amen. It's a faith that could if
[49:43] it could if it could heal your body, it
[49:45] could take you in a rapture. That's
[49:46] right. Right.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; How many believes that here tonight?
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram would say it like this. God
[49:51] sends a guide. God wants you to remember
[49:53] that he's he is a his appointed guide.
[49:56] And we must remember him. Here it says
[49:58] Jesus said, "I will not leave you, but
[50:00] I'll pray the father and he'll send you
[50:01] another comforter." And this comforter
[50:03] when he is to come was to guide us to
[50:05] all truth. And the word of God is the
[50:08] truth. Can the church say amen? And the
[50:10] word is Christ. I am the way, the truth,
[50:13] and the life. He is the word. In the
[50:16] beginning was the word. The word was
[50:17] with God. The word was God. And the word
[50:19] was made flesh and dwelt among us. Then
[50:21] if we follow the real true guide, the
[50:23] Holy Spirit. He was to tell us what he
[50:25] had seen, what he had heard, and he was
[50:27] to show us the things that is to come.
[50:29] Can the church say amen? There you are.
[50:32] He is going to show you the things to
[50:34] come. And when the churches today reject
[50:36] that, how can we ever expect to go to
[50:39] heaven? When the Holy Spirit was sent to
[50:41] us for a guide, we'll take some
[50:43] cardinal, some bishop, some general
[50:44] overseer or somebody like that to guide
[50:46] us. When the Holy Spirit was given to
[50:48] guide us, and the Holy Spirit always
[50:51] speaks of the word, I've got many things
[50:53] to tell you. He said, "You cannot
[50:54] understand it now, but when he comes,
[50:56] he'll guide you to it." Amen. Come on,
[50:58] church. That's why we can't rely on what
[51:00] we think we know or some mental
[51:02] conception of what we know. Amen. But we
[51:04] got to have the Holy Ghost as a guide.
[51:06] And he will lead you and guide you into
[51:08] all truth. Can the church say amen? He
[51:10] said that's the reason the coming of the
[51:12] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[51:14] seal, the mystery of God should be
[51:16] finished to know who God is, what he is,
[51:20] how he lives, his nature, his being.
[51:22] You're supposed to be all the way up
[51:23] here by that time. See, bring us into
[51:25] the full stature of sons and daughters
[51:27] of God. A church that's washed in the
[51:29] blood of Jesus Christ, that's bought
[51:31] without money, is paid for by the blood
[51:34] of Jesus Christ. Now, he said, "Here we
[51:36] are, a guide." And he is God's provided
[51:39] guide. Now, we're going through a
[51:41] wilderness and we're on a road somewhere
[51:43] and we can't get along without this
[51:44] guide. Can the church say amen? And he
[51:46] said, "Dare anybody to try to take a
[51:48] substitute or any other guide. If you
[51:51] do, he'll take you off the line." He
[51:53] said, "This guide knows the way. He
[51:55] knows every inch of the way. He knows
[51:58] every thought that's in your heart. He
[51:59] knows everybody that's there. He knows
[52:01] who you are and what you've done and all
[52:03] about you." Amen. Don't you want to
[52:05] trust a guide like that? Amen. He knows
[52:06] through. He knows every valley you've
[52:08] been through. Amen. He knows every trial
[52:10] you've went through. He knows every
[52:11] mistake you've made and yet he's still
[52:13] leading you. Come on, church. Amen.
[52:16] Every this God knows everything that
[52:18] you've ever done, everything that you
[52:20] will ever do. And yet, he has still
[52:22] placed before you a prize that you can
[52:25] attain. You say, "Well, I don't know if
[52:27] I can get there." Amen. He's already
[52:28] placed the desire on the inside of you.
[52:30] And he would not have placed the desire
[52:32] on the inside of you to win if you
[52:34] couldn't be a winner. Yes, sir.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; You think about it. You think about it
[52:38] in in in sports season. You think about
[52:41] it like this. When there's a goal in
[52:43] front of you, can you imagine a soccer
[52:45] player that's trying to reach this goal?
[52:47] And if he turns around and starts
[52:49] kicking the ball the other way, he's
[52:51] playing for the wrong team and you're
[52:53] sure to lose. Amen. But if he can score
[52:55] on the in the goal that's been placed
[52:57] before him, come on, church. the one
[52:59] that that the team that he's on, kick it
[53:01] in the right goal. Amen. Then he be he
[53:03] can come out victorious as a winner.
[53:05] Amen. It's just like a football team
[53:06] when they're marching down the field.
[53:08] Amen. If if the running back would get
[53:09] the ball and run the other direction,
[53:11] amen, he'd be scoring for the other
[53:12] team.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; But but come on, church. I think we've
[53:16] given too much credit to the devil.
[53:17] We've been scoring touchdowns for the
[53:19] devil long enough. It's time that we
[53:21] know who we are. We recognize what team
[53:24] we're on. Amen. we keep the goal before
[53:26] us and press towards the mark. It It's
[53:30] not time to start working for the devil.
[53:32] It's not time to start looking around
[53:34] and seeing is anybody cheering for me or
[53:36] is anybody pulling for me? No. Amen. God
[53:39] has placed you in the position he has
[53:41] placed you in so that you amen could
[53:43] attain the goal that is placed before
[53:45] you.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are we are placed there.
[53:50] Amen. If you are placed in position, if
[53:52] you are placed in a you think about it
[53:54] as a team, you think about you say,
[53:56] "Well, I'm not carrying the ball right
[53:57] now." No, but you might be blocking for
[53:59] somebody else and I'm not I I don't have
[54:01] the ball. The quarterback's got it. No,
[54:03] but you've got to hold up your end and
[54:04] catch it. Amen. There's a way to there's
[54:06] a way to score in the goal and you've
[54:08] you've got to get in the end zone. And
[54:10] the only way to do that, amen, is by
[54:12] working in the program a and the
[54:14] wheelhouse that God has called you to.
[54:16] Amen. He didn't call you, amen, to sit
[54:18] on the sidelines. Come on, church. He
[54:21] didn't call you to sit over there and
[54:22] just be a and just say, "Well, good job.
[54:24] That was nice." No, he called you to
[54:26] work in his field. He called you to be
[54:28] an overcomer. He called you to press.
[54:31] Can you say, "Amen." Amen. God has given
[54:33] this bride a desire, amen, to not just
[54:35] be a spectator, but be a participator in
[54:38] this in this game. Amen. It's not just a
[54:40] Listen, church, you've already you've
[54:42] already won. He knows you're going to
[54:44] win, but he's given you the power and
[54:47] the desire to be an overcomer in this
[54:49] hour. Can the church say, "Amen." You
[54:51] say, "Brother Joel, why do we have to
[54:53] press?" It's because God didn't push you
[54:55] in to one end of the pipe and pull you
[54:57] out the other and say, "You made it."
[54:59] No. But what he did was he put you here
[55:01] and he gave you a desire to serve God.
[55:03] And he gave you a desire, amen, to to
[55:05] seek him in his temple. And he gave you
[55:07] a desire to be an overcomer. And if
[55:09] there's a desire there, it was placed
[55:12] there by God. And then God has given his
[55:14] spirit as a guide to see you through
[55:16] every trial. Can the church say amen?
[55:18] Come on, church. What we need to do is
[55:20] realize that God did not place you here
[55:23] so that you could lose. God did not
[55:25] place you here, Amen, so that you could
[55:27] be so that you could be distracted. But
[55:29] God has placed you here to be an
[55:32] overcomer in Leodysia. Amen. He didn't
[55:34] put you in Luther's day. He didn't put
[55:36] you in Wesley's day. He didn't put you
[55:38] in the Pentecostal age. But he put you
[55:40] in the greatest of all ages so that you
[55:42] could see the coming of the Lord.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen here tonight? Is
[55:47] anybody with me? You know where I'm
[55:49] going here tonight? Amen. We've got to
[55:51] have a guide to lead us to a place where
[55:54] we can reach the goal. You've got to
[55:57] have a guide. A guide places something
[55:59] on the inside of you. Amen. a guide can
[56:01] give you uh if you go hiking or if you
[56:04] go to a place where you go to a ranger
[56:06] station or something, you can find a map
[56:07] of the trails and you can see where you
[56:10] want to go. And the only way you can do
[56:11] that, many times you would never be able
[56:13] to find it on your own. You can get out
[56:14] there and you get lost in the
[56:16] wilderness. But if you actually follow
[56:18] what the guide has given you, can the
[56:20] church say amen? Then you can reach the
[56:22] goal that you're trying to get to. But
[56:24] you'll never reach that if you're just
[56:26] wandering around. say, "Well, I wonder
[56:28] if this will work, or I wonder if this
[56:30] is the way it is, or I wonder if we
[56:32] ought to just uh I wonder if we ought to
[56:33] just quit preaching and play tapes in
[56:34] the church, or I wonder if we ought just
[56:36] go this direction or that direction. Go
[56:38] back to a Pentecostal message." No, he
[56:40] has clearly placed a path in front of
[56:42] you. And he has said, "Press the
[56:44] battle." Amen. Every devil's going to
[56:46] come against you. Amen. All hell is
[56:49] against you. But I've given you a way to
[56:51] victory. Press the battle.
[56:54] Press to the mark. Press to the mark of
[56:56] the high calling. Press on and God will
[56:59] be there. And come on, church. Amen.
[57:01] He's always been your guide. Amen. He
[57:03] was a guide when you were a baby. He was
[57:05] a guide when you were a toddler. Amen.
[57:07] He always knew you would be a son or
[57:09] daughter of God. Amen. But when you
[57:10] accepted him as your guide, Amen. You
[57:12] quit walking like a toddler and you put
[57:14] away the foolish things. Can you say
[57:16] amen? But when you became a man or you
[57:18] became a woman and when you put away
[57:20] those things and you started walking not
[57:22] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say this here. He
[57:30] said, excuse me, 1 Timothy 6 and9. 1
[57:33] Timothy 6 and9. But they that that will
[57:35] be rich fall into temptation and a snare
[57:37] and into many foolish and hurtful lust
[57:39] which drown men in destruction and
[57:41] predition. For the love of money is the
[57:42] root of all evil, which while some
[57:44] covenant after they have aired from the
[57:46] faith and pierce themselves through with
[57:48] many sorrows. But thou, oh man of God,
[57:50] flee these things, and follow after
[57:52] righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
[57:54] patience, and meekness, he said, and
[57:57] fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold
[57:59] on eternal life, whereto thou art also
[58:02] called and hast professed a good
[58:04] profession before many witnesses. Can
[58:07] you say amen? And so, Brother Brandon
[58:09] would say like this. He said now he said
[58:11] Napoleon had forgot the main thing. What
[58:13] happened to him? He died totally
[58:14] defeated. A drunken sought. Why? He
[58:16] didn't play the game right. He had
[58:17] conquered the world physically. He had
[58:19] prepared an army. He was military
[58:20] genius. He took over every nation and
[58:22] done the things that that no other man
[58:24] could have ever done or did do like him.
[58:26] But he had forgot what the real message
[58:27] was. He had taken it and got his
[58:29] military strength. But he forgot the
[58:31] strength of the Lord. Amen. Come on,
[58:33] church. Don't forget to look up to where
[58:35] your strength comes from. Amen. Don't
[58:37] forget to look to your guide and say,
[58:38] "My hope is in the Lord. My strength
[58:41] comes from the Lord." Come on, church.
[58:43] Amen. Your guide is not me. Your guide
[58:45] is not the is not the church, but the
[58:47] guide is the Holy Spirit that has been
[58:49] given to you. And every one of us have
[58:51] got to come to a place where we
[58:53] recognize we need a guide. We are in a
[58:55] place of confusion. We're in a place of
[58:57] of death. And we've got to have a guide
[59:00] to reach the goal.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We defend our rights. and we
[59:05] defend our rights as as an American. And
[59:07] we we should and Amen. But we but we def
[59:10] we fail to defend our rights as a son
[59:11] and and daughter of God. We we we fail
[59:14] to realize who we are. Amen. The devil
[59:16] comes after you and tries to tell you
[59:17] who you are and what you've done. You
[59:19] tell the devil that you know who you
[59:20] are. You know what you've done. But you
[59:22] tell him that listen, I'm not listening
[59:24] to you. I'm not listening to you, Satan.
[59:26] Amen. You've had me bound too long.
[59:28] Amen. We're an overcomer in this hour.
[59:30] Come on, church. If you know who you
[59:32] are, then the the battle is the battle
[59:34] is the Lord's. Amen. We are an overcomer
[59:37] in this time because we are looking
[59:39] forward to the things that are to come
[59:41] and forgetting the things that are in
[59:43] the past. And come on, church. When you
[59:45] look to the things that are in the past,
[59:47] you're always going to start looking in
[59:48] the past and say, "Well, what about what
[59:50] about what I did here?" Amen. What about
[59:51] this mistake that I made? Or, "Well, I
[59:53] wish we could do it like they used to do
[59:54] it in the church." Or, "I wish we had
[59:56] things like, come on, I don't even
[59:58] remember what that was like." Amen. But
[59:59] I've heard people say that. But I want
[1:00:00] to tell you something. When you keep
[1:00:02] looking in the past, I wish it would be
[1:00:03] this way. God has orchestrated things to
[1:00:06] be like they are for your good.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; I wish we could go back to the way the
[1:00:11] things were in the message. I I don't
[1:00:13] want to go back 15 years myself because
[1:00:15] it wasn't great for me. But I can tell
[1:00:16] you this. I I I press towards the mark
[1:00:19] that is in front of me. Amen. I can't
[1:00:21] look behind me because behind me is
[1:00:24] mistake after mistake and fallen down
[1:00:26] after falling down. Amen. But when I
[1:00:28] look in front of me, amen, there is a
[1:00:29] crown of righteousness. Can the church
[1:00:31] say amen? Amen. That the Lord himself
[1:00:33] has prepared for you. Amen. He did not
[1:00:35] lay, come on, church. We said it last
[1:00:37] week. He didn't go build you a mansion
[1:00:39] over there. He didn't build you a home
[1:00:40] in glory just to lose you. Amen. He
[1:00:42] didn't pick you up just to let you down.
[1:00:44] Amen. He didn't he didn't put his home.
[1:00:46] Come on, church. He didn't place a
[1:00:47] desire in you to lose you in this race.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. David, think about where David
[1:00:56] came from. David was just a shepherd
[1:00:59] boy. And when he had to face Goliath, he
[1:01:02] could look behind him and say, "Well,
[1:01:03] yeah, he he did help me, but but but
[1:01:05] maybe I'm still just a shepherd boy.
[1:01:07] Maybe maybe I don't maybe I really can't
[1:01:10] face what's in front of me." Can the
[1:01:11] church say, "Amen. Maybe I really can't
[1:01:13] overcome. Maybe maybe there's maybe
[1:01:15] there's nothing to this. Maybe maybe
[1:01:17] maybe those five stones don't mean
[1:01:18] nothing. Maybe I really can't overcome.
[1:01:21] Maybe, maybe, just maybe, there's not a
[1:01:23] possibility of me overcoming. Amen. But
[1:01:25] David didn't think like that. Amen.
[1:01:27] David picked up the five stones for
[1:01:29] Goliath and his brothers. And he said,
[1:01:31] he said, "You know what?" He said, "God
[1:01:32] was with me there." He said, "But but
[1:01:34] but he wasn't looking at his failures."
[1:01:35] I want you to notice he looked back to
[1:01:37] what God had done in a good way. I mean,
[1:01:39] he quit looking. He looked at where God
[1:01:40] brought him from, but he didn't say,
[1:01:42] "Well, maybe he'll lead me in the
[1:01:43] wilderness, or maybe he'll lead me to
[1:01:45] the bear this time, or maybe he'll lead
[1:01:46] me to No, come on, church." He didn't
[1:01:48] look at the boy that he was, but he
[1:01:50] looked at the Goliath he was facing and
[1:01:52] said, "Greater is he that Come on,
[1:01:54] church." Amen. Greater is he that is in
[1:01:56] me. Amen. He quit looking at the
[1:01:58] circumstances and he looked at in front
[1:02:00] of him was a kingdom. Amen. That was his
[1:02:03] and and God had anointed him. A prophet
[1:02:05] came by. Amen. And and with a word from
[1:02:07] the Lord that he was anointed to be
[1:02:09] king. Amen. And if he was anointed to be
[1:02:11] king, then he had to overcome the giants
[1:02:14] that he would face.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Do you know before
[1:02:18] you're ever going to get there, you're
[1:02:19] going to face giant after giant and
[1:02:21] tribulation and and not the tribulation
[1:02:23] period, but you're going to have
[1:02:24] tribulations in your life and you're
[1:02:25] going to have trouble in your life.
[1:02:27] You're going to have all kinds of things
[1:02:28] come against you. Come on, church. Every
[1:02:30] one of you are going to fight that
[1:02:32] battle. Amen. But at the end of the
[1:02:34] road, there is victory.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; There is an overcomer. How many's an
[1:02:38] overcomer here tonight? Amen. But you've
[1:02:40] got to press the battle. You've got to
[1:02:42] keep on keeping on. You got to keep in
[1:02:44] the way that the Lord has called you.
[1:02:46] Can the church say amen here tonight?
[1:02:48] Amen. Brother Brandon would say like
[1:02:49] this. He said, "Every one of you people
[1:02:51] who profess to be Christians, get
[1:02:52] yourself quiet before him. Don't let the
[1:02:54] washing hinder. Don't let the work
[1:02:56] hinder. Don't let nothing hinder. Don't
[1:02:57] let nobody know what you're doing. Just
[1:02:58] go before him." He said, "Get up in the
[1:03:00] woods somewhere. Get out on the side of
[1:03:01] the road. Go into the secret closet and
[1:03:03] close the door when the kids gets at
[1:03:05] school." He said, "Get on your knees.
[1:03:06] You've heard all kinds of voices
[1:03:08] everywhere, but just get down and stay
[1:03:10] there until those voices are silenced
[1:03:12] and you begin to lift up. He said,
[1:03:14] "It'll change you. It'll make you
[1:03:16] different." He said, "Like it did little
[1:03:17] Samuel. It'll do something to you if
[1:03:19] you'll just do it now. It'll make you
[1:03:21] what you should be. It'll make you the
[1:03:23] kind of Christian that you ought to be."
[1:03:24] Come on, church. Amen. We've been
[1:03:26] listening to all the distractions and
[1:03:27] all the voices around us, but what we
[1:03:29] need to do is keep our eyes on the
[1:03:31] prize. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:03:33] Keep your eyes ahead of you. Amen. Keep
[1:03:35] your eyes on Christ because if they get
[1:03:37] on anything else and they get on the
[1:03:39] sinking sands of the world, amen, then
[1:03:41] you're sure to go down with the world.
[1:03:42] Amen. But if you keep your eyes on him,
[1:03:44] amen, when he comes, he'll be ready for
[1:03:46] him. Can the church say, "Amen." Amen.
[1:03:48] I'll be ready when he comes. It ain't
[1:03:50] because I'm good enough, but because he
[1:03:52] has made me good enough. Amen. It's
[1:03:54] because his power, his guide. Come on,
[1:03:57] church. Amen. I want you to notice when
[1:03:59] a prophet was lost up there in the
[1:04:00] mountains, he thought he was a pretty
[1:04:02] good guide on his own. And he thought he
[1:04:04] could find his way around, but he
[1:04:05] realized that he also was immortal and
[1:04:07] he needed a guide. Come on, church.
[1:04:09] Amen. A prophet a just because he was a
[1:04:12] word prophet. And just because he was
[1:04:13] vindicated time after time does not mean
[1:04:16] that he can get by without having a
[1:04:17] guide. And neither can we in this hour.
[1:04:20] Amen. You've got to have a guide that'll
[1:04:22] lead you to the mark. Come on, church.
[1:04:25] Amen. And what you when he was up there
[1:04:26] in the mountains, he said what he did is
[1:04:28] he he reached around there and he
[1:04:30] remembered there was a line that he
[1:04:32] could get a hold of. And he said when he
[1:04:34] got a hold of that line, he knew that
[1:04:35] would lead him back to safety. And I
[1:04:37] believe tonight, Amen, the message is
[1:04:39] the line that has been given to you.
[1:04:40] Amen. How many believes you've got a
[1:04:42] lifeline in this time? Amen. The
[1:04:44] lifeline has come. And I say hold on.
[1:04:46] Hold on to that lifeline. Amen. When you
[1:04:48] get Come on, church. It don't matter if
[1:04:50] the snow's getting deeper. It don't
[1:04:52] matter if it's getting colder in the
[1:04:53] world. It don't matter what every devil
[1:04:55] that's come against you. Can you say
[1:04:57] amen? Amen. But if you hold the line,
[1:04:59] hold the line and you'll get to your
[1:05:01] destination. Amen. There's safety ahead
[1:05:03] ahead of you. Come on, church. I mean,
[1:05:05] what what you find is every devil in
[1:05:07] hell's going to try to stop you. Every
[1:05:09] storm's going to come against you. Amen.
[1:05:11] But but all the devils in hell couldn't
[1:05:14] sink the ship because Jesus was in the
[1:05:16] boat.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't do it. Why? Because
[1:05:19] they had a guide in the boat. And some I
[1:05:22] I think sometimes we just need to go say
[1:05:24] just go wake Jesus. Amen. He's still in
[1:05:27] your boat. Get down on your knees. Get
[1:05:29] up and and worship him and say, "You
[1:05:30] know what? We we've got the guide."
[1:05:33] Amen. But we need to recognize the guide
[1:05:35] is here. Amen. You're not going down
[1:05:36] with the waves. You're not going down
[1:05:38] with the sinking ship, but you are going
[1:05:40] to be an overcomer and you will reach
[1:05:42] the other side.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice in the ship, Amen.
[1:05:46] They they didn't just sail over there.
[1:05:48] Amen. But when he came, when he said,
[1:05:50] "Peace, be still." It might have been
[1:05:51] the smoothest sail they've ever had
[1:05:54] because they they immediately went to
[1:05:56] the other side. And I want you to know
[1:05:58] something. When when you're in a place
[1:06:00] where where you feel like all hell is
[1:06:03] against you and every wave has come
[1:06:05] against you, how many's ever been there?
[1:06:07] Anybody ever been to a place where you
[1:06:09] feel like you're you're sinking in
[1:06:10] quicksand and you just can't find a way
[1:06:12] out and you feel like there just no help
[1:06:14] and you had to grab a hold of whatever
[1:06:16] you could find and it was the line. It
[1:06:18] was the message of the hour. Can the
[1:06:19] church say amen? Amen. Come on, church.
[1:06:21] But what you've done is you've been
[1:06:22] distracted by the by the noise. You've
[1:06:24] been distracted by the problems. You've
[1:06:25] been distracted, Amen, by the world. And
[1:06:27] do you realize Satan has done that just
[1:06:29] to distract you. Come on, church. Every
[1:06:31] blessing that God has placed before you,
[1:06:33] you say, "Well, I messed up. The
[1:06:35] blessings are no longer there." The
[1:06:36] blessings that were placed before you,
[1:06:38] the promises that were placed before
[1:06:40] you, they're still in front of you. Come
[1:06:42] on, church. Amen. When he said, "Thy thy
[1:06:44] house shall be saved," he didn't take
[1:06:46] that away from you because you failed
[1:06:48] God. Come on, somebody. You say, "Well,
[1:06:50] I didn't raise my kids in the way they
[1:06:52] should go." Amen. But but you've come to
[1:06:53] God and you've repented. Amen. And God
[1:06:55] may make them come the long way back,
[1:06:57] but they're going to come back.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen. God didn't bring you
[1:07:02] to a place. God didn't bring you to a
[1:07:04] place of refuge and say, "I'm going to
[1:07:06] let you come in. Amen. Because of your
[1:07:07] mistakes, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:07:09] cause everybody else to perish." No,
[1:07:10] sir. God is not that way. He was not
[1:07:12] willing that any should perish. He was
[1:07:14] willing that all should come to him.
[1:07:16] Amen. If you've recognized the guide
[1:07:17] tonight, I say hold on to him. If you've
[1:07:20] recognized your position in the message
[1:07:22] of the hour, I say hold on to him. Don't
[1:07:24] give up, church. Don't give in. Don't
[1:07:26] turn around and look at somebody else or
[1:07:28] look the way it used to be. Don't look
[1:07:30] behind you, but keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight? I
[1:07:37] love in in in Philippians 3. I love I
[1:07:39] love in that 10th verse he said that
[1:07:40] that I may know him that I may know him
[1:07:43] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:07:46] the fellowship of his sufferings being
[1:07:48] made conformable unto his death. And in
[1:07:50] verse 11 he said if by any means I might
[1:07:53] attain unto the resurrection of the
[1:07:54] dead. And then he goes on, "Not as
[1:07:56] though I had already attained, either
[1:07:58] were already perfected, but I follow
[1:08:00] after if that I may apprehend that for
[1:08:04] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[1:08:06] Jesus." And then he goes on to say, what
[1:08:08] we read at the beginning, he said,
[1:08:09] "Brethren, I count not myself to have
[1:08:11] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[1:08:13] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:08:16] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:08:17] which are before." And I love the verse
[1:08:19] 14. He said, "I press." Somebody say, "I
[1:08:22] press." I press toward the mark for the
[1:08:24] prize of the high calling of God in
[1:08:27] Christ Jesus. Can I go just a little
[1:08:28] farther? He said in verse 15, "Let us
[1:08:30] therefore as many as be per as many as
[1:08:33] be perfect be thus minded. And if in
[1:08:36] anything ye be otherwise minded, God
[1:08:38] shall reveal even this unto you." He
[1:08:41] said, "Nevertheless, whereto we have
[1:08:43] already attained, let us walk by the
[1:08:45] same rule. Let us mind the same thing.
[1:08:48] Brethren, be ye followers together of
[1:08:50] me, and mark them which walk also. Uh,
[1:08:53] so as ye have for an example, and for
[1:08:56] many walk of whom I have told you often,
[1:08:59] and now tell you even weeping of the
[1:09:01] that they are the enemies of the cross
[1:09:03] of Christ, whose end is destruction,
[1:09:05] whose God is their belly, and whose
[1:09:07] glory is in their shame, who mind
[1:09:09] earthly things. For our conversation is
[1:09:12] in heaven, from whence also we look for
[1:09:15] the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Are
[1:09:17] you still with me tonight? I mean, verse
[1:09:18] 21 says, "For who shall change our vile
[1:09:21] body, that it may be fashioned like unto
[1:09:23] his glorious body, according to the
[1:09:25] working whereby he is able even to
[1:09:28] subdue all things unto himself." So I
[1:09:31] would say here, when you look at what is
[1:09:33] in front of you, come on church. Amen.
[1:09:35] It is not the ones that have caused
[1:09:37] destruction. It is not the ones, Amen.
[1:09:39] who are who their mind is on earthly
[1:09:42] things. Amen. But if your mind is stayed
[1:09:43] on Jesus and your mind is fixed towards,
[1:09:46] come on church. Amen. Towards the coming
[1:09:48] of Christ. Amen. Then you will be with
[1:09:50] him. Amen. You will be changed and
[1:09:52] you'll become just like he is. I say we
[1:09:56] shall not all sleep. But we shall be
[1:09:58] changed. Amen. I'm not looking for Come
[1:10:00] on, church. I'm not even looking for the
[1:10:02] grave. If I'm preaching in 5 years or 10
[1:10:05] years, if the coming of the Lord ain't
[1:10:06] as soon as I think it'll be, I want you
[1:10:08] to know this. I want to continue to
[1:10:10] preach that I will not sleep, but I
[1:10:12] shall be changed. I may go by way of the
[1:10:14] grave. Amen. But come on, somebody.
[1:10:15] Amen. Somebody's got to have the faith
[1:10:17] to make a rapture. And I believe
[1:10:19] according to the word of God that if I
[1:10:21] press towards that mark, we will attain
[1:10:24] that mark. We will attain what God has
[1:10:28] for us, Brother David. We will attain
[1:10:30] the things that are before us. Because I
[1:10:32] know that our best days are not behind
[1:10:34] us, but our best days are ahead of us. I
[1:10:36] don't care if there's fire and famine
[1:10:38] and fear in front of me. Amen. But I
[1:10:40] know who goes before me in battle. And I
[1:10:42] know whose side I'm on. I know who's
[1:10:44] already won the victory. Come on,
[1:10:46] church. Amen. I I know the things behind
[1:10:48] me haven't been right. I know the things
[1:10:50] behind some of you have been bad. And
[1:10:53] you say, "Well, my my future don't look
[1:10:55] so bright." It may not in in your flesh.
[1:10:57] Amen. You may have some bad days ahead
[1:10:59] of you, but greater is he that is with
[1:11:01] you. Greater is he that is in you.
[1:11:04] Greater is the comforter that has come.
[1:11:06] Greater is the guide than every demon
[1:11:08] ahead of you. You say, "I'm Can I
[1:11:11] overcome, Brother Joel?" Yes, you can
[1:11:12] overcome. What are you going to
[1:11:14] overcome? By by the blood of the lamb
[1:11:16] and by the word of your testimony.
[1:11:18] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:11:19] He said, "Don't ever have a negative
[1:11:21] testimony." Come on, somebody. Don't
[1:11:23] ever have a negative testimony. Well, I
[1:11:25] don't know if I'm going to make it. No,
[1:11:26] I'm going to make it because I'm
[1:11:27] pressing on. Amen. I'm pressing on the
[1:11:30] upward way. New heights I'm gaining
[1:11:32] every day. Come on, church. I'm still
[1:11:34] praying. I'm still pressing. I'm still
[1:11:36] laying I'm still laying up treasures on
[1:11:38] the other side. Amen. Cuz this world is
[1:11:40] not my home. I'm just passing through.
[1:11:42] But I know where I'm going. Come on,
[1:11:45] church. Do you know where you're going
[1:11:47] here tonight? Amen. Do you know without
[1:11:49] a shadow of a doubt that none of these
[1:11:52] things that are going to try to distract
[1:11:53] you are going to move you?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; I got just a couple minutes left and
[1:12:00] I'll close. you okay so far?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandham would say,
[1:12:06] "Don't let nothing hinder." And that
[1:12:08] last quote I read to you, "Don't let
[1:12:11] anything hinder."
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be a lot of
[1:12:13] distractions. There's going to be a lot
[1:12:15] of things that are going to try to stop
[1:12:16] you. There's going to be he would he
[1:12:18] would just name simple things. He said,
[1:12:20] "Don't let the washing hinder. Don't let
[1:12:22] the work hinder. Don't let nothing
[1:12:24] hinder." Somebody say, "Amen." No, he
[1:12:27] said you don't have to let nobody know
[1:12:29] what you're doing. You don't have to
[1:12:30] say, "Well, I prayed through today." I
[1:12:32] get on Facebook and announce I prayed
[1:12:34] for two hours and 12 minutes today. I'm
[1:12:36] going to overcome. Or no, I tell you
[1:12:38] what you I tell you what you're going to
[1:12:39] do. It might It might be the person that
[1:12:41] fought to pray five minutes, but you
[1:12:43] overcame. It might be the person that
[1:12:45] fought to to even get on their knees one
[1:12:47] day, say, "Lord, I I I can't even find
[1:12:49] the words to say to you." Amen. But he
[1:12:51] knew your heart that day and knew. Come
[1:12:53] on, somebody. He knew that just to just
[1:12:55] to step just to step forward and to to
[1:12:58] kneel down and and say, "Lord, I don't
[1:12:59] even know what to say to you." Amen. But
[1:13:01] you were pressing on. Can you say amen?
[1:13:04] Well, there's a battle in front of me. I
[1:13:05] don't know if I can make, but you're
[1:13:06] pressing the battle. I I don't know if
[1:13:09] Well, can you say amen? Amen. I don't
[1:13:11] know if I can make it. I don't know. I
[1:13:12] don't know if my children are going to
[1:13:14] make it, but I will keep pressing on. I
[1:13:17] will ste keep going on. I'm going all
[1:13:19] the way to be with my Lord and there's
[1:13:22] none of these things going to stop me.
[1:13:23] Come on church. When the mountain's too
[1:13:25] high in front of you. Amen. I know a
[1:13:27] mountain mover. When the valley is too
[1:13:28] deep, I know somebody who can build a
[1:13:30] bridge over troubled waters. When
[1:13:32] there's some Come on, church. Amen. I
[1:13:34] know the peacekeeper. And I know the one
[1:13:36] who can calm the storms in your life.
[1:13:38] And anybody else know who I'm talking
[1:13:39] about? Anybody else ever met him before?
[1:13:41] Amen. I know somebody who can walk on
[1:13:43] the water. So if you feel like you're
[1:13:45] sinking in the storms of life, I know
[1:13:47] somebody who can reach down and re
[1:13:48] rescue you. Aren't you glad he reached
[1:13:50] down his hand for you? Aren't you glad
[1:13:52] that the guide grabbed you when you were
[1:13:54] falling down the mountain side and he
[1:13:56] said, "Come up higher." Hallelujah.
[1:13:58] Somebody ought to say amen here tonight.
[1:14:00] Amen. Anybody ever been in a position
[1:14:01] where you needed a guide? Aren't you
[1:14:03] glad that God came looking for you? You
[1:14:05] say, "I didn't go looking for him." No,
[1:14:07] you never looked for him. But when he
[1:14:08] found you, he put a desire on the inside
[1:14:11] of you. And ever since the desire was
[1:14:13] placed there, you said, "I press. I
[1:14:16] press." Somebody said, "I press. I'm not
[1:14:19] giving up, but I press on, and I'll keep
[1:14:21] going on and on and on." Somebody ought
[1:14:23] to say, "Praise the Lord" here tonight.
[1:14:25] Amen. Come on, church. Do you know him?
[1:14:27] Do you know who he is? Do you know the
[1:14:29] mountain mover here tonight? Amen. Do
[1:14:31] you know who's in the valley with him?
[1:14:32] Amen. Do you know who's on the storms of
[1:14:34] life with you? He's still the Jehovah
[1:14:36] Gyra. Amen. He's still God. And he
[1:14:38] changes not. He's still the God of
[1:14:40] yesterday. He's still the God of William
[1:14:42] Brandham and he's still the God that is
[1:14:44] in his bride here tonight. Somebody
[1:14:46] ought to say praise the Lord and give
[1:14:48] God praise here in the building. Amen. I
[1:14:49] think if you ever recognize if you ever
[1:14:52] recognize who you are and you know that
[1:14:54] he's with you. Amen. None of these
[1:14:56] things are going to cause you to fall
[1:14:57] away. Amen. But these things are just
[1:14:59] things you look at him. You say, "Well,
[1:15:00] I know I've got a guide." Amen. Are you
[1:15:02] still holding the line here tonight? You
[1:15:04] say, "Well, I can't hold on to him." No.
[1:15:06] But he's holding you because he's the
[1:15:07] one. Amen. He reached out and he found
[1:15:09] your hand when you were just walking
[1:15:10] around praising. I he you were walking
[1:15:13] around with your hand in the air and
[1:15:15] then something grabbed a hold of you and
[1:15:16] then you held on. Say, "Lord, I'm not
[1:15:18] letting go because between me and the
[1:15:21] hand of the the hand that is holding
[1:15:23] me." Amen. It might be life or death,
[1:15:25] but I am not giving up. Amen. I believe
[1:15:28] there's a bride in this hour that says,
[1:15:29] "I'm not giving up. I'm not going down.
[1:15:32] I'm not going down in destruction, but I
[1:15:35] will be changed.
[1:15:38] Can you say amen here tonight? When my
[1:15:40] time's up, let's stand here this
[1:15:41] evening. Amen. How many How many can
[1:15:44] say, "Thank God for a guide." How many
[1:15:46] can say, "Thank you, Lord, for grabbing
[1:15:48] my hand. Thank you, Lord, for holding my
[1:15:50] hand. I can't even walk. I can't even
[1:15:52] walk without you holding my hand. The
[1:15:54] mountains were too high. The valleys
[1:15:56] were too low. There was nothing I could
[1:15:58] do, but you held on when I didn't feel
[1:16:01] like holding on." And so when he placed
[1:16:04] that desire in you, you say, "Lord, I
[1:16:07] have a desire to overcome. I have a
[1:16:09] desire to reach out to you. I have a
[1:16:12] desire to hold on." Anybody here else
[1:16:14] have have that desire in your heart? I
[1:16:16] believe you do. You wouldn't be here on
[1:16:17] Wednesday night. If you're here tonight,
[1:16:19] I believe there's been a desire placed
[1:16:20] in you to press.
[1:16:23] It ain't going to be easy, but you can
[1:16:25] press. How many here's going to keep
[1:16:26] pressing on? Don't look back. Say,
[1:16:30] "Well, it was easier back there." there.
[1:16:31] Well, it might have been a little easier
[1:16:32] back there, but look ahead. There's a
[1:16:34] promised land ahead of you. Amen. There
[1:16:37] and there'll be giants and there'll be
[1:16:39] all kinds of there's going to be all
[1:16:41] kinds of wars and and there's going to
[1:16:43] be all kinds of sin and and things that
[1:16:44] try to stop you. Amen. But just keep
[1:16:46] following the vindicated pillar of fire.
[1:16:49] Amen. It's not a it's not a man that
[1:16:50] calls himself Moses. It's not a it's not
[1:16:52] a pillar of fire that you think you
[1:16:54] might have saw, but we've got a
[1:16:55] vindication of it here, church. We're
[1:16:57] not following a maybe, but we're
[1:16:59] following a no. We're following what we
[1:17:01] know is true. We're following a
[1:17:02] vindicated God. Amen. That has made
[1:17:05] himself real to us. Aren't you thankful
[1:17:07] for him here tonight? Amen. Somebody
[1:17:09] just raise your hand and say, "I can't
[1:17:10] even walk. I can't even walk without you
[1:17:13] holding my hand." Anybody ever faced a
[1:17:16] mountain that was too high? Yes. But you
[1:17:18] got over it. And if you if you couldn't
[1:17:20] get over it, then you might have to just
[1:17:22] have the mountain mover move that
[1:17:23] mountain for you. But you know, he can
[1:17:25] still do that here tonight. How many
[1:17:27] believes you can still make it?
[1:17:30] I learned
[1:17:32] how to stand. Oh, sing it now. Well, I
[1:17:35] can't even

[1:17:47] yeah. I can't even

[1:20:40] Well, there's times I've even
[1:20:43] questioned. Even if my Lord was near.
[1:20:47] Oh, then at times that old tempter, he
[1:20:52] said, "Why not turn around?"
