[29:38] Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be
[29:41] in your house again tonight and to think
[29:44] more that you are here with us such a
[29:47] marvelous thing our Lord created the
[29:51] heavens and the earth and who rose again
[29:54] on the third day and Lord we we know
[29:57] that you're here to think that you're
[29:59] here is such a marvelous thing father I
[30:02] pray that you would just move in every
[30:04] heart speak through me God sometimes
[30:08] Lord in our weakness you're made strong
[30:11] and so Lord tonight I'm free that would
[30:13] be the case and the weakness of my flesh
[30:16] may there be something delivered Lord
[30:19] that would be a strength to the body of
[30:21] Christ I pray you'd move over every
[30:24] heart every soul we leave here Lord may
[30:26] we be able to say was good to be in the
[30:29] house of the Lord together
[30:30] where are you granted now we ask in
[30:32] Jesus name
[30:34] [Music]
[30:37] turn with me this evening if you would
[30:40] to Matthew chapter 9 Matthew chapter 9
[30:44] and verse 20 thank you for the music
[30:47] Matthew chapter 9 and verse 20 what a
[30:55] privilege it is to be in the house of
[30:57] the Lord I want to speak to you tonight
[31:01] on a different kind of touch and pray
[31:05] for me that I'll be able to deliver this
[31:07] the way that I feel it my heart
[31:10] we were we were studying on 1st
[31:13] Corinthians and we'll continue that I'm
[31:15] just gonna take a little break and
[31:16] figure out the best way to do that and
[31:18] now according how we feel lad but we
[31:22] want to look at this tonight and has
[31:23] just been on my heart for the last few
[31:25] days and behold a woman which was
[31:27] diseased with an issue of blood twelve
[31:30] years came behind him and touched the
[31:33] hem of His garment for she said within
[31:38] herself if I may but touch His garment I
[31:42] shall be whole what kind of faith is
[31:46] that I may but touch His garment I shall
[31:50] be whole but Jesus turned him about when
[31:55] he saw her he said daughter be of good
[31:58] comfort thy faith hath made thee whole
[32:01] and the woman was whole from that hour I
[32:05] pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[32:07] the word you may be seated this evening
[32:14] as I was thinking about the situation
[32:19] that we're in now and one of the things
[32:22] that's hard is that we can't touch
[32:24] people like we would like to and maybe
[32:28] some of you don't like people touch you
[32:30] and so for you it's not a problem and
[32:33] but most of us were social creatures
[32:38] not only with seeing one another and
[32:40] being able to being in each other's
[32:43] presence but also with touch we have
[32:47] five senses which is seeing hearing
[32:50] being able to taste smell and touch and
[32:55] people usually list touch as the last of
[32:57] the five senses but it's probably the
[33:01] most important sense that you have and
[33:04] every time they ask doctors or
[33:08] scientists or whatever about this what
[33:10] sense could you do without the least it
[33:13] would be touch because if you were
[33:15] unable to touch you would be unable to
[33:17] operate to be you you wouldn't be able
[33:19] to stand you wouldn't be able to feel
[33:22] pain and so you have to be able to just
[33:25] to be able to have a bearing of where
[33:27] you're at
[33:28] you touch the world that you're in if
[33:31] you'll if you're preaching you touch the
[33:34] pulpit if you're sitting there in the
[33:36] pew you you touch the Pew you know some
[33:39] part of your body knows about where it
[33:41] is and it's how you know your position
[33:44] in the world and over time it's become
[33:49] kind of a sense of how we know our
[33:51] position with one another that we touch
[33:54] if you love someone you tend to touch
[33:57] that person and when you do it you know
[34:02] how you touch them it conveys something
[34:05] and there's lots of ways that I could
[34:08] touch my wife I could slap her across
[34:10] the face I would never do that but I
[34:13] could that would be touch but she would
[34:17] understand that that I wasn't happy
[34:19] something was wrong it wasn't me because
[34:23] I did I would never do that but it would
[34:25] still be a touch or I could walk
[34:28] but lay my hand on her shoulder and that
[34:30] would mean something I could pat her on
[34:32] the back that would be a touch it would
[34:34] mean something to her over time and
[34:38] something that I thought was interesting
[34:39] on Sunday was that we had a problem or
[34:44] at least I did I don't know about y'all
[34:45] trying not to shake hands you know how
[34:48] hard that is when somebody tells you not
[34:50] to do it right and and so we're not
[34:54] supposed to shake hands and I agree with
[34:56] that right now we're not supposed to do
[34:57] that and and it's the custom as far as
[35:01] keeping everybody safe and so I was
[35:03] trying to set a good example and I'm out
[35:04] there like this I'm not afraid to shake
[35:06] your hand just trying to set a good
[35:08] example I know this brother Danny was
[35:09] walking around with his hands in his
[35:11] pockets and you know and you're trying
[35:15] not to to shake hands with one another
[35:17] that's hard isn't it and sometimes you
[35:19] do it not not even thinking because
[35:22] you're so used to doing it and I know
[35:24] that there's people that would say well
[35:26] we should just do away with that in the
[35:28] world that we live in now with so many
[35:29] diseases and things and maybe there's
[35:31] some merit to that as far as diseases
[35:33] but it got me thinking why do we shake
[35:35] hands it's because we touch one another
[35:38] it's a way that you can touch somebody
[35:41] and they know so Jane that you're you're
[35:44] there and then that you're you're real
[35:47] and and your relation to that person you
[35:50] ever shake hands with somebody that
[35:51] didn't like you you know and and so
[35:58] there's lots of ways that you can tell
[36:00] out whether somebody what their attitude
[36:03] is and you can actually affect someone
[36:05] else's attitude by walking through and
[36:08] shaking somebody's hand in in a certain
[36:10] way or not shaking their hand so a
[36:13] handshake is important handshakes always
[36:16] been a sign of a cooperation I'm we're
[36:19] sealing the deal where we're shaking
[36:22] hands and you might be thinking tonight
[36:24] where is he going with this but there is
[36:26] a point to it and it goes beyond shaking
[36:30] hands but it's always been this this way
[36:33] the game of being able to meet somebody
[36:36] and cooperate with that person even the
[36:38] North and the South would shake hands
[36:40] the surrender of the south it was a way
[36:43] of the deals been made it conveyed
[36:46] peaceful intentions the Greeks they say
[36:48] started that because as far as shaking
[36:51] hands the way we do today because when
[36:53] they would shake hands they knew they
[36:55] didn't have a weapon in the right hand
[36:56] so you shake hands to no persons not
[36:59] armed and so you have no ill-will toward
[37:03] anyone it's a sacred bond it in some
[37:07] time in the 17th century the Quakers
[37:08] because back then everybody would bow or
[37:12] tip a hat or something like that and the
[37:13] Quakers were simple folk and they said
[37:15] well we'll just shake your hand and
[37:17] that's enough for us that's the common
[37:19] thing to do and so it become a common
[37:22] greeting and it's something we still do
[37:23] today but it's it's a way of knowing
[37:27] where you stand with people now in the
[37:30] Bible in the early church and especially
[37:33] in the Jewish church they didn't
[37:35] necessarily shake hands as much as we do
[37:37] but they greeted one another with a holy
[37:39] kiss and I think if brother David got up
[37:43] and and sort of saying shake hands with
[37:45] everybody around you if he got up and
[37:46] said greet your brother with a holy kiss
[37:48] we might have some some awkwardness
[37:50] today it would be a little awkward
[37:53] because it's just not something that we
[37:55] do but in that culture that's what they
[37:57] did they shook hands with one another
[37:59] and they greeted each other rather with
[38:01] a holy kiss and they would kiss on the
[38:03] neck and brother branham deals with that
[38:05] and talks about how that they would kiss
[38:07] one another and greet one another and
[38:09] that made you feel welcome and so the
[38:11] early church used this in their public
[38:13] assemblies they had a time set aside to
[38:15] greet one another they would actually
[38:17] greet one another and so it didn't
[38:21] necessarily become abuse but it just
[38:22] become impossible as churches grew
[38:24] larger and people that had at different
[38:26] customs and things weren't used to that
[38:28] and so we've moved now to shaking hands
[38:30] brother Adam talks about this and in
[38:34] shaking hands brother Branham is very
[38:35] Pro shaking hands if you've read the
[38:38] message he your brother brand was very
[38:40] much for shaking people's hands and I
[38:42] don't say this to to make us feel bad
[38:45] because we can't right now really and
[38:47] the law they they just wouldn't like us
[38:50] doing that somebody come on got a
[38:51] picture and we are all shaking hands out
[38:53] the church they would they would send it
[38:55] into the paper and we'd get put on the
[38:56] on the news that we're not we don't care
[38:59] about people and things like that but
[39:02] brother Branham is very proud shaking
[39:05] hands and what I want to get to you is
[39:07] that it's more than just a tradition but
[39:09] it's touching someone and brother Brown
[39:13] says though I like that he said I like a
[39:14] good warm feeling don't you he said I
[39:16] hate that old cold formal way we got
[39:19] people today he said they're so far away
[39:21] from one another he said you don't care
[39:24] for one another that's what's the matter
[39:27] he said even church members get the same
[39:29] way I underline that for me even church
[39:33] members get the same way they don't care
[39:36] for one another and brother Branham
[39:39] takes just farther than and he's talking
[39:41] about how when when Marian and Elizabeth
[39:45] greeted one another they they grabbed
[39:46] gave each other a hug and and and shook
[39:48] each other's handed and they were so
[39:51] happy to see one another and he said
[39:54] that he said that's what's the matter he
[39:56] said they don't care for one another he
[39:58] said why if anybody does anything wrong
[40:00] trying to shove him down he said don't
[40:03] shove him down pick him up help him
[40:07] that's right and so you could say that
[40:11] shaking someone's hand or being near
[40:14] them being able to touch them as a way
[40:16] of saying brother I want to help you I
[40:19] want to cooperate with you I want to be
[40:22] a part and that's why streaming as good
[40:25] as it is I'm so glad we were able to do
[40:27] that during this time but it'll never
[40:28] replace live church services because
[40:31] there's something about being together
[40:32] and being able to say that and being
[40:34] able to convey to one another we're in
[40:36] this together we're fellowshiping
[40:38] together we're right here like sitting
[40:40] across the table and being able to feed
[40:42] on the Word of God and being able to say
[40:44] brother I'm with you and so brother
[40:48] brown says don't try to criticize him
[40:50] and tell somebody else go to him with
[40:52] your arms around him go to him with your
[40:55] arms around him that conveys something
[40:57] you ever seen a little child and I've
[41:00] noticed melody will go up to Joe and
[41:02] give him a hug I'm not that comfortable
[41:05] with Joe yeah
[41:07] I'd give Joe a hug but but you know what
[41:10] she just goes up to him after I was
[41:12] ranting because she she's a little she
[41:13] don't have the inhibitions that we do
[41:15] but she looks at that as you know she's
[41:18] found him to be somebody that's
[41:19] trustworthy and somebody that gives
[41:21] gifts and and so that helps a lot with a
[41:25] child but the child is willing to do
[41:28] that they'll just run up to you and hug
[41:29] someone and I think we should be more
[41:33] like that when it comes to not just a
[41:35] physical hug or a handshake but in
[41:37] bringing someone into our our world
[41:40] letting somebody into our
[41:42] vulnerabilities if you could say it that
[41:44] way
[41:44] III don't necessarily feel like I I you
[41:48] know maybe that person they don't you
[41:50] don't know him that well but we're
[41:51] soldiers together and in the army of the
[41:54] Lord and we're brothers and sisters in
[41:56] crisis and we ought to be able to break
[41:58] down some barriers in fellowship with
[41:59] one another and I'm preaching it myself
[42:05] too because I tend to be a bit formal in
[42:07] dealing with people but if you deal with
[42:09] people a lot you kind of get that way
[42:11] you get gun-shy and you don't like to
[42:14] just really open up because you get hurt
[42:16] but you have to take it's worth it to
[42:18] take the risk of getting hurt in order
[42:20] to actually have the closeness and the
[42:22] companionship and the Brotherhood that
[42:24] comes with being together so brother
[42:28] Brown says he said don't try to
[42:30] criticize him and tell somebody else go
[42:31] to him with your arms around him and
[42:33] today he said they got so afraid they
[42:35] don't want to shake hands anymore he
[42:38] said but I like a good old Methodists
[42:40] pumphandle handshake I'm not preaching
[42:44] that to convict you that's not the point
[42:46] tonight about not shaking hands because
[42:48] I'm the leader in that I won't shake
[42:50] your hand tonight either so you don't
[42:52] have to worry about that but he said you
[42:55] know one of them kind he said get right
[42:56] down and shake we missed that don't we
[43:02] why because it means something in
[43:05] Galatians 2 and 9 James and Peter and
[43:10] John received Paul and Barnabas into
[43:14] their into their fellowship as ministers
[43:17] said they gave them the right hands of
[43:19] fellowship
[43:20] that we should go into the heathen they
[43:23] into the circumcision it was a the idea
[43:25] of they would grab each other's arm and
[43:27] they would say I'm your brother and this
[43:29] goes back to an old Jewish custom in
[43:31] Leviticus 62 you can find it where it
[43:34] says that if a man lied to his neighbor
[43:36] what was delivered him to keep or in
[43:38] fellowship or or let means partnership
[43:41] who literally means taking the right
[43:43] hand if you shake somebody's hand and
[43:46] then you didn't mean it you shook
[43:48] somebody's hand and then you went and
[43:50] and misused the money or something like
[43:52] that it would be maybe to farmers
[43:54] cooperating together to businessmen
[43:56] cooperating together and and then they
[43:59] shook the hand but the one doesn't keep
[44:00] up his end of the bargain and so it was
[44:03] a terrible thing but it was called in
[44:05] fellowship in fellowship it's literally
[44:07] putting of the hand and so we still have
[44:12] that today that when a business deal is
[44:14] done you know you go buy a car that
[44:17] sales going to shake your hand 15 times
[44:19] and and we were taught in insurance
[44:24] sales
[44:25] my dad was an insurance agent he would
[44:26] go out and they taught that well you
[44:29] should always shake their hand when you
[44:31] get there when you leave because it's a
[44:33] it's a sealing of the deal if you make a
[44:35] connection with that person shakes their
[44:37] hand look them in the eye then it's
[44:39] easier for to sell them something
[44:42] because you made that connection now
[44:44] brother branham talks about this right
[44:45] hand of fellowship in the ordination of
[44:47] ministers he says that's the ordination
[44:49] I know over the Bible he said it's the
[44:51] right hand of fellowship he said all
[44:53] that gives brother McKinney the right
[44:54] hand of fellowship in this church raise
[44:56] up your hand and then he later
[44:58] instructed them to go shake his hand and
[45:00] they laid hands on him shook his hand
[45:02] and he gave him the right hand of
[45:03] fellowship brother Branham says speaking
[45:07] of new converts he said I want and he
[45:10] does this in several places he said I
[45:11] want you to look and see all that
[45:13] standing around everywhere you it's your
[45:15] eyes up he said now when these people
[45:16] sat down he said you give them the right
[45:18] hand of fellowship by shaking their hand
[45:20] because you want the new converts to
[45:22] real to know that they're a parked
[45:25] brother branham talks in a bad way about
[45:27] handshakes too and you'll find that that
[45:28] he says it's no substitute for the Holy
[45:30] Ghost right just going up and shaking
[45:33] hands to me
[45:34] in the right hand of fellowship is not a
[45:35] substitute for the baptism of the Holy
[45:37] Ghost because the one who you ultimately
[45:40] have to touch is Christ that's who you
[45:44] have to touch to be safe touching me
[45:46] will not make you saved much as we love
[45:49] you and sometimes you have known for for
[45:50] many years and I see the Andrews here
[45:52] and and I've known them and when the
[45:54] kids were little I was surpassed her
[45:56] then and and but you know knowing me
[45:59] it's not what gets you into heaven but
[46:01] it's knowing him touching me doesn't get
[46:04] you in heaven touching even a prophet
[46:06] wouldn't get you into heaven but it's
[46:07] touching him Genesis 32 and 25 we find
[46:15] an instance God touching a man now it's
[46:22] a wonderful thing for God to touch a man
[46:25] and he did this through an angel or
[46:27] theophany or body that he would make you
[46:30] had to have some form that he could be
[46:32] in to be able to touch and so we find
[46:36] that he touched the hollow of Jacob's
[46:38] fly and was out of joint we find other
[46:43] instances in the Old Testament that
[46:45] these people could be touched by the
[46:48] hand of God we find no instance in the
[46:53] Old Testament where the people could
[46:55] touch God they could be touched by God
[47:00] but there's no record that I could find
[47:02] where they touched God in fact they were
[47:06] told in Exodus 19 and 12 that thou
[47:09] should set bounds under the people
[47:11] roundabout no God speaking to Moses said
[47:13] I'm gonna come down in a thick cloud he
[47:15] said and I want you to set a boundary
[47:17] around the mountain because when I come
[47:19] down on it if they touch it they're
[47:22] gonna die I think about it's like the
[47:25] mountain of God had a had a caution tape
[47:28] around it he said don't touch it
[47:31] because if you touch that you're gonna
[47:33] die said take heed that you not go up in
[47:36] an amount or even touch the border of it
[47:40] said don't touch the border
[47:43] don't touch the border don't touch the
[47:46] hem of it earlier
[47:47] shove it whoever touches the mouth shall
[47:50] surely be put to death again he says
[47:53] there shall I hand touch it
[47:54] he should surely be stoned or shot
[47:56] through whether it be beast or man it
[47:58] shall not live on the trumpet sounded
[48:01] falling they shall come to the mountain
[48:04] now I love the fact that God wanted to
[48:10] touch his people so it wasn't enough
[48:14] just to be a spirit but he came down in
[48:17] flesh and he came down and walked among
[48:21] men and touched men and we begin to find
[48:25] instances of Christ touching people and
[48:28] you don't find that so much in the Old
[48:30] Testament where someone would do that
[48:31] though Elijah laid his body on the child
[48:33] and so there are instances of contact
[48:35] but in the New Testament this language
[48:38] starts to be used that he talks about in
[48:41] Matthew 8 3 Jesus put forth his hand and
[48:44] touched him you touch him and he said I
[48:50] will be thou clean and immediately his
[48:56] leprosy was cleansed so by one touch she
[48:59] was cleansed of his leprosy and leprosy
[49:02] is a type of sin so he could say tonight
[49:04] that sin can be cleansed with the touch
[49:06] of his hand
[49:08] one touch she touched him Matthew 18:15
[49:13] this was Peters mother-in-law she was
[49:17] laying there with a fever probably had
[49:20] some kind of virus and Jesus went up to
[49:23] her and touched her and when he touched
[49:26] her hand the fever left her he didn't
[49:30] even pray over didn't even speak
[49:33] anything to her he just touched her hand
[49:36] and she arose and ministered unto them
[49:39] some blind man come to him and the Bible
[49:42] says he touched their eyes saying
[49:44] according to your faith be it unto you
[49:49] and he must be the Messiah because
[49:52] whatever he touched something happened
[49:56] but many touched him
[50:01] but some touched him for the wrong
[50:03] reasons it matters how you touch and so
[50:07] I'm kind of taking the long way around
[50:09] and previewing our story tonight what
[50:12] we're going to talk about but many touch
[50:15] him Mary and Joseph for the first to
[50:18] touch him there as they add him as a
[50:20] baby they touched in the same way that
[50:23] for the Allens touching his child
[50:25] tonight they held him they they had him
[50:27] in their hands constantly because that's
[50:29] what you do with the baby they touched
[50:32] him but there's no record that he healed
[50:35] them they just touched his physical body
[50:38] the disciples touched him and what a
[50:42] brushed up against him would have better
[50:43] near him
[50:45] the woman of ill-fame touched his feet
[50:47] with her tears and many many touched him
[50:54] but the woman and artex touched him in a
[50:57] different way now in mark 524 it tells
[51:06] us in a little bit different telling of
[51:08] the story and it says Jesus went with
[51:11] him
[51:11] it was gyruss who he had gone with to go
[51:14] and pray for his daughter he said Jesus
[51:16] went with him and much people followed
[51:18] him and thronged him they were all
[51:21] touching him if you've ever been in a
[51:24] throng and that that biblical word is
[51:26] interesting because I can't you can't
[51:28] think of much of a comparison here in
[51:30] the States saying 6 foot apart shouldn't
[51:32] be that hard for us can we stay pretty
[51:34] far apart anyway but if you go overseas
[51:37] when you look at a jeepney full of
[51:39] people and crammed in there or you get
[51:41] on any kind of public transportation
[51:43] maybe New York City or someplace like
[51:45] that we see that kind of crowding
[51:47] together and you think my how could they
[51:50] even do that and I realized that I've
[51:52] told you before I realized that in
[51:53] Africa they don't recognize like we do
[51:55] personal space they just come right and
[51:58] you get out of the service no come on
[52:00] throng around you you feel like you
[52:02] can't breathe and it must have been the
[52:04] way it was with Jesus the people were
[52:07] throught were thronged around him they
[52:09] were they were pressed around him there
[52:11] everywhere there was people
[52:12] and he barely had room to walk people
[52:16] touching him on every side a certain
[52:20] woman which had an issue of blood twelve
[52:23] years and it suffered many things of
[52:27] many physicians and had spent all that
[52:29] she had and was nothing bettered but
[52:31] rather grew worse and she had heard of
[52:33] Jesus came and the press behind and
[52:37] touched his garment for she said if I
[52:41] may touch but it's closed I shall be
[52:45] whole and the Bible said straightway the
[52:50] fountain of her blood was dried up and
[52:51] she felt in her body that she was healed
[52:53] of that plague and Jesus immediately
[52:56] knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[52:58] out of him turned him about in the press
[53:01] right in the middle of all those people
[53:03] he turns around he stops and there's all
[53:06] the people touching him and he says who
[53:10] touched my clothes
[53:12] now that word touched when he said who
[53:15] touched me or who touched my clothes
[53:16] that word that he uses every time is
[53:18] it's a word that wasn't used commonly in
[53:21] the Greek but it was hepta my which is
[53:25] means to Kindle a fire and what it is is
[53:29] it's a purposeful touch it's a touch
[53:33] with purpose it's not just to touch by
[53:37] accident but to touch because you meant
[53:41] to right now he said somebody touched me
[53:49] purposefully and his disciple said unto
[53:52] Him thou seest the multitude thronging
[53:54] thee and say it's now who touched me and
[53:58] Jesus said and this is the way Luke
[54:01] tells it jesus said who touched me we're
[54:04] all denied Peter and they they were with
[54:07] him said master the multitudes throng
[54:09] the and Pressley they're not just
[54:10] touching you they're pushing you around
[54:14] and they're trying to get get close to
[54:18] you the multitude is touching you and
[54:20] saying Sal who touched me my brother
[54:24] branham
[54:25] explains it like this he said now we
[54:27] find out that a little woman had a blood
[54:28] issue and she pressed through the crowd
[54:32] to touch the border of his garment he
[54:35] said and now the Palestinian garment had
[54:37] an underneath garment because of dust
[54:38] getting on the legs and in a robe that
[54:40] went over that and Jesus thronged with
[54:43] the people pressing him and that little
[54:46] woman touching his garment he said if
[54:48] you if she touched your coat you'd never
[54:50] feel it physically and she turned and
[54:53] went out into the audience and Jesus
[54:55] stopped them all and said who touched me
[54:57] someone touched me he said but I
[55:00] perceived that I've gotten weak virtue
[55:03] went from me and brother Brown says it
[55:06] was a different kind of touch and he
[55:10] elaborates on this he said oh don't miss
[55:11] this he said that's where this educated
[55:14] high headed world today is missing it
[55:17] they're putting their name on church
[55:19] books but failing to touch with the
[55:23] feeling to touch with the feeling I
[55:28] think it's interesting that she never
[55:31] required in her statement of faith
[55:33] she didn't say if I can touch him and he
[55:36] feels me if I can touch him and get his
[55:39] attention she never said that she said
[55:43] if I can touch him he didn't need to
[55:47] feel it she needed to feel it and I
[55:53] think sometimes we miss this because
[55:55] there's a time we realize we don't go by
[55:58] feelings but a man that believes God can
[56:01] can feel God if we say it that way
[56:04] there's something about it we believe in
[56:06] something that is real it's not just an
[56:08] abstract thing but it's something that's
[56:10] real and there's a lot of there's a lot
[56:12] of counterfeit emotion out there today
[56:14] there's a lot of people are doing things
[56:17] that that it's just emotion it's just
[56:20] sensation but we find that if there's a
[56:24] counterfeit it's a proof there is a real
[56:27] all right if you have a counterfeit
[56:29] hundred dollar bill just of proof
[56:30] there's a real one somewhere and so
[56:33] there's a lot of emotion but people
[56:35] failing to touch with feeling
[56:39] and you know we get into that in our
[56:41] marriages brother Brown tells the story
[56:43] about how the man went and kissed his
[56:45] wife goodbye just like he always did but
[56:47] not with feeling right we come to church
[56:51] sometimes like we always do but we don't
[56:54] touch him we fail to touch him like we
[56:58] ought to and when we don't touch him we
[57:01] leave unsatisfied like that feeling when
[57:04] we don't get to shake hands with one
[57:05] another you just kind of feel
[57:09] unsatisfied because you're unable to
[57:11] touch and how many people go to service
[57:15] after service after service unable to
[57:17] touch Jesus and he's there but they just
[57:22] can't seem to appropriate the faith to
[57:24] to touch him
[57:25] failing to touch with the feeling so
[57:29] jesus said somebody had touched me for I
[57:32] perceive that virtue has gone out of me
[57:36] brother Branham again talking about him
[57:39] about this situation he said Oh Concord
[57:41] tonight God be merciful use that touch
[57:45] use that touch not I'm Methodist I'm a
[57:50] Baptist Pentecostal I'm Nazarene use
[57:54] that touch that touches him there is a
[58:00] touch that touches him so they aside
[58:06] these traditions let's touch Christ and
[58:11] how many times do we buy tradition we
[58:14] just go through the roll and I'm guilty
[58:16] of that as well as a ministry you go
[58:18] through the roll and you you do what you
[58:20] do but he said let's excuse the touch
[58:23] that touches him we'll do everything
[58:26] else and make sure that it's right if
[58:28] your car something's wrong with your car
[58:30] you'll go through it with a fine-tooth
[58:31] comb to find out what it is so you can
[58:33] fix it have it running right but
[58:35] sometimes our spiritual experience gets
[58:37] broken down and we get to a place where
[58:40] we just can't seem to touch him and when
[58:43] we get to that place we need to find out
[58:45] what's wrong go through it begin to
[58:47] begin to fill up with the word again
[58:50] begin to get in a place where we can
[58:51] touch him
[58:52] I sang but then I touch him I prayed but
[58:57] did I touch him I went to church but did
[59:00] I touch him so he said lay aside those
[59:06] traditions let's touch Christ you may
[59:10] know everything about the message all
[59:12] the innocent helps of all the different
[59:14] views that there is of the message but
[59:16] did you touch him were you able to to
[59:22] have your need met because you touched
[59:24] him because you felt the touch and as I
[59:29] said he can touch us but can you touch
[59:32] him tonight I believe we can know
[59:38] brother Branham says when Peter might
[59:39] have said these words to the Lord
[59:41] they'll think there's something mentally
[59:43] wrong look at the arms and hands
[59:45] touching you from everywhere and then
[59:48] say who touched me said he rebuked him
[59:50] for it jesus said but I felt a different
[59:54] kind of touch a real touch so if I'm
[59:59] going to come to church if I'm going to
[1:00:02] preach I wanted to have that real touch
[1:00:04] to it
[1:00:06] don't you if you if you're gonna come if
[1:00:09] you're gonna listen listen and give a
[1:00:11] part of your portion of your life to
[1:00:12] hearing the Word of God may there let
[1:00:14] there be a real touch to it it may not
[1:00:17] be something when you jump and run all
[1:00:19] over the church with something that's
[1:00:20] sincere about it something that's real
[1:00:23] something that that you just just not a
[1:00:25] middle conception of something that's
[1:00:27] alive he said I felt a different kind of
[1:00:33] touch a real touch since so many of us
[1:00:35] tonight have confessions so many of us
[1:00:38] do different things but yet there's a
[1:00:41] touch there is something that calls
[1:00:44] detention to God and God reflects
[1:00:47] himself in his child the work that he
[1:00:50] does we're supposed to do the same she
[1:00:56] is actually doing the work of Christ
[1:00:59] she is operating the gift of Christ
[1:01:04] by touching him hey Ben
[1:01:08] God was reflecting himself in her and in
[1:01:12] her life
[1:01:14] again but the round said some of some of
[1:01:17] them said why master I believe it was
[1:01:19] Peter said why the whole crowd is strong
[1:01:21] in you why that's you why everybody is
[1:01:24] touching you he said but I perceived
[1:01:26] that virtue has gone from me
[1:01:28] he got weak it's a it was a different
[1:01:32] kind of touch if we could only see that
[1:01:35] brother sister he said if you can touch
[1:01:39] him with that certain touch he said oh
[1:01:43] sick people I'm fixing to pray for you
[1:01:45] just in a few minutes he said I do
[1:01:47] believe that I have the Holy Spirit he
[1:01:50] said but no more Holy Spirit than what
[1:01:52] you've got right out there or these men
[1:01:54] has got here he said the same Holy
[1:01:58] Spirit but it's a commandment of God and
[1:02:01] if you believe that to be the
[1:02:03] commandment of God a praying for the
[1:02:04] sick and laying hands on them casting
[1:02:06] out evil spirits and the promises he has
[1:02:09] made it'll be the same thing with you
[1:02:12] you'll get what you asked for if you can
[1:02:15] believe it can we believe it tonight he
[1:02:19] said you'll get what you asked for if
[1:02:21] you can believe it it'll be the same
[1:02:24] thing with you now we could ask
[1:02:28] ourselves this question what was
[1:02:29] different about her touch what was
[1:02:33] different I notice first of all she said
[1:02:41] within herself she said if I'm in but
[1:02:45] touch His garment I shall be home why
[1:02:49] she had the faith to know that once
[1:02:52] she'd touched him she would be well when
[1:02:56] you come to him you have to believe and
[1:02:59] who he is and you have to believe in it
[1:03:02] strongly enough that you believe if I
[1:03:04] can touch him even if he doesn't
[1:03:06] acknowledge me even if I don't have
[1:03:08] maybe this great sensation but I know if
[1:03:11] I touch him hey man I can be I shall be
[1:03:16] whole
[1:03:18] she said if I touch His garment I shall
[1:03:21] be whole and she said and a woman having
[1:03:27] an issue of blood twelve years which had
[1:03:29] fit all living upon physicians neither
[1:03:31] could be healed of any so she said I can
[1:03:32] touch him and I'm just kind of going
[1:03:34] back through this to remind us why her
[1:03:36] touch was different
[1:03:37] first of all it had to be a touch of
[1:03:39] faith and now it has to be a touch that
[1:03:43] was desperate she'd come to a place
[1:03:47] where she was tired of paying doctors
[1:03:49] and she had no more money to pay them
[1:03:51] anyway you ever been there I'm sure some
[1:03:57] of you haven't and you know you get to a
[1:03:59] place where you've done everything that
[1:04:01] you can physically and you just can't
[1:04:03] move that mountain you just can't make
[1:04:06] it any different but you say well I need
[1:04:08] something what what do I have need of
[1:04:10] you need you need to touch Christ hey
[1:04:14] man you need to touch Christ and she was
[1:04:16] done with all the touching that or all
[1:04:18] the the physicians that had poked on her
[1:04:21] and prodded on her she said I need to
[1:04:23] touch Jesus and so she was desperate and
[1:04:27] she was persevering because when she'd
[1:04:30] heard of Jesus she come in the press
[1:04:32] behind and touched his garment she came
[1:04:34] in the press
[1:04:35] brotherbrother said now in that he said
[1:04:38] a little woman up on the hill maybe she
[1:04:40] spent all of her living trying with the
[1:04:42] doctors to get a cure for a blood issue
[1:04:44] she'd had it several years and so she
[1:04:48] said within herself when she seen him
[1:04:49] coming no matter what the people say I
[1:04:52] believe that the man is the son of God
[1:04:55] hey man I think we could say that
[1:04:57] tonight no matter what the people say I
[1:04:59] believe this message is true I believe
[1:05:02] he's the son of God I believe Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:06] forever no matter what the people say he
[1:05:08] didn't die in 1965 but he's still alive
[1:05:11] tonight no matter what the people say
[1:05:13] he's still a living God he's the same
[1:05:15] yesterday today and forever
[1:05:17] she said no matter what the people say I
[1:05:19] believe that man is the son of God and
[1:05:23] she pressed her way through the crowd
[1:05:25] and being a weak and anemic condition
[1:05:27] weakening as she pressed through
[1:05:30] become weaker she got weaker and she got
[1:05:32] weaker and sometimes it feels like while
[1:05:35] you're pressing that you get weak to a
[1:05:37] point where you just can't make it but
[1:05:38] remember if he give me the faith to do
[1:05:40] it he'll give you the ability to press
[1:05:42] all the way through she had to press
[1:05:45] through the crowd she said as she
[1:05:49] weakening she finally got to where he
[1:05:51] was and she maybe had to squeeze through
[1:05:54] some of them pressing her way in one
[1:05:59] place he said that she had to get
[1:06:02] through through the the founder of the
[1:06:04] Mormon Church and all of his wives in
[1:06:09] other words she had to come through
[1:06:10] maybe that doctrine she had to come
[1:06:12] through maybe a oneness Fortuna's for 3
[1:06:15] minutes whatever that it was she had to
[1:06:17] be willing to press through it she may
[1:06:20] be come through all kinds of doctrines
[1:06:21] around the message but she had to be
[1:06:23] willing with her Harvey to press through
[1:06:25] it she had to be willing though there
[1:06:27] was a lot of fanaticism and and people
[1:06:29] could point to this one that failing
[1:06:30] this one that did wrong but she pressed
[1:06:32] through it she pressed through it
[1:06:35] because she believed that God was still
[1:06:37] alive today and you're gonna have to
[1:06:40] press through some things if you want
[1:06:41] something from God if you believe that
[1:06:43] God still operates through the ministry
[1:06:45] today you're gonna have to press through
[1:06:46] all the false to get to Christ if you
[1:06:50] believe that God is still that the
[1:06:52] church still should be on fire for God
[1:06:54] then you're gonna have to press through
[1:06:55] all the deadness you gonna have to press
[1:06:58] through all the coldness to get to him
[1:07:01] hey Beth and she had to squeeze through
[1:07:05] so many times what we knew there's very
[1:07:07] little effort in it I'm not criticizing
[1:07:10] you but I'm talking about all of us is
[1:07:12] just in the human condition
[1:07:13] there's so little effort and we think
[1:07:15] well if God wanted me to do that he just
[1:07:16] let me do it
[1:07:17] but brother Brent said God can't push
[1:07:19] you through a pipe and pull you out the
[1:07:20] other end and say blessed is he that
[1:07:22] overcomes but there's got to be some
[1:07:24] effort put into it as you can say Lord I
[1:07:26] believe if I touched you I'll be well he
[1:07:30] wants you to do that brother bear said
[1:07:32] if you ever get to Christ you're gonna
[1:07:35] have to press your way to him cuz
[1:07:37] there's gonna be all kinds of people
[1:07:39] there trying to hold you back
[1:07:44] gonna be all kinds of people and I don't
[1:07:45] look at your wife or your husband or
[1:07:47] your neighbor if there's anyone near
[1:07:49] enough to look at tonight don't look
[1:07:52] around too much but you know there's
[1:07:55] people that are just there to hold you
[1:07:57] back but you can't get your eye on them
[1:08:00] can't let them stop you can't stop and
[1:08:03] get an argument with them because
[1:08:05] that'll just make you late
[1:08:08] Jesus is passing by I'm not gonna spend
[1:08:11] my time arguing with people about the
[1:08:13] proper way to do this or the right way
[1:08:14] to do that Jesus is passing by let me
[1:08:17] get to him let me find him in the throng
[1:08:19] let me find him though many others might
[1:08:21] be doing that maybe for their free kind
[1:08:23] of purpose at all but let me find him
[1:08:26] I'm here to find him what about you
[1:08:28] tonight when you come to the house of
[1:08:30] God I'm here to find Jesus I'm here to
[1:08:33] touch the hem of His garment I know I'll
[1:08:36] be well she was determined he said she
[1:08:41] was determined so she pressed her way
[1:08:43] until she touched the border of his
[1:08:46] garment he said who touched me and the
[1:08:53] discernment began to work for the
[1:08:54] Brenham said she touched him she went
[1:08:56] back and sat down on the audience and
[1:08:59] the discernment began to work he said I
[1:09:01] know somebody touched me and Luke 847
[1:09:07] says when the woman saw that she was not
[1:09:08] hit I want to tell you tonight that
[1:09:11] you're not hit maybe a Wednesday night
[1:09:13] but you're not hit from Christ I may not
[1:09:18] always and I know that I won't always be
[1:09:22] able to anticipate your need and be able
[1:09:25] to call you when you need a call or be
[1:09:27] able to do there's just going to be
[1:09:28] times I'll fail at that because I'm
[1:09:29] human and you tend to be able to impact
[1:09:32] the most of people you touch every day
[1:09:34] the people you touch the most and so
[1:09:37] your your children and those in your own
[1:09:38] house you you tend to be able to impact
[1:09:40] them more but then the people around you
[1:09:42] sometimes you it's not because you
[1:09:45] intend to but things slip your mind and
[1:09:47] you're not able to get to everybody and
[1:09:49] you think well I just you'd say well if
[1:09:51] he'd have just been able to see me if he
[1:09:53] just knew that I was here he just was
[1:09:55] was there at the right time to speak a
[1:09:57] word but the woman saw that she could
[1:09:59] not be hid from Christ you may be able
[1:10:03] to be hid from the pastor you may be
[1:10:04] able to be hid from the church you may
[1:10:07] be hid from society you may be sitting
[1:10:10] at home tonight and and you're sitting
[1:10:12] there by yourself and you feel hidden
[1:10:13] you feel like there's nobody that can
[1:10:15] see what you know what you're going
[1:10:16] through but you know he can see you the
[1:10:22] woman saw she was not hit you can't be
[1:10:24] hid from God you might as well just step
[1:10:26] out and begin to testify of what he's
[1:10:28] done she could not be hid she came
[1:10:32] trembling she must have loved to testify
[1:10:35] like my wife does she come trembling
[1:10:39] Britney hates to get up in public and
[1:10:42] and sister Mina was that way and brother
[1:10:45] Browns wife and and he would embarrass
[1:10:47] her by and the people would embarrass
[1:10:48] her and she would threaten him I sort of
[1:10:50] like before the meeting and say don't
[1:10:52] whatever you do don't let them call my
[1:10:53] name she didn't like to testify some
[1:10:56] people do and some don't this woman must
[1:10:58] have been that way she pretty shy but
[1:11:01] she felt the healing touch of God she
[1:11:05] didn't have to make the biggest
[1:11:05] commotion nobody else knew that she'd
[1:11:08] come to church that day but jesus knew
[1:11:10] it nobody else saw her in the crowd but
[1:11:14] Jesus saw her and he gave her an
[1:11:16] opportunity to come forth and give her
[1:11:18] testimony and she came trembling and
[1:11:21] falling down before him she declared
[1:11:23] unto Him before all the people for what
[1:11:26] cause she had touched him and how she
[1:11:28] was healed immediately and he said unto
[1:11:32] her daughter be of good comfort thy
[1:11:35] faith hath made thee whole go in peace
[1:11:39] and mother and I'm always points out
[1:11:40] that word whole is so so and the Greek
[1:11:42] it means more than just her body but
[1:11:46] it's her soul she'd already been healed
[1:11:50] of the problem but now she was saved hey
[1:11:54] Ben she was made whole because she
[1:11:57] touched him and the Bible tells us
[1:12:01] tonight that we have a high priest and
[1:12:04] he says it like this we have not a high
[1:12:05] priest which cannot be touched so he's
[1:12:08] saying we have a hype
[1:12:09] which can be touched we don't have a
[1:12:12] high priest like like to Aaron we don't
[1:12:15] have a high priest like like that he
[1:12:17] would bear the sins of the people and go
[1:12:18] in once a year to the to the atonement
[1:12:21] to make it at Ulmer for the sins of
[1:12:22] Israel but he couldn't be touched by
[1:12:23] their infirmity but we have a high
[1:12:26] priest who can be touched by the feeling
[1:12:29] of our infirmities and that word me say
[1:12:32] empathize with or to have empathy for
[1:12:35] but brother branham always used it in
[1:12:37] conjunction with this story this woman
[1:12:39] and the next verse says let us therefore
[1:12:43] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[1:12:46] let's come boldly unto the throne of
[1:12:49] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[1:12:52] grace to help in time of need why do we
[1:12:54] come boldly because we have a high
[1:12:57] priest who can be touched we're not
[1:13:01] there like they were at the mountain and
[1:13:02] a caution pay put around it
[1:13:05] say don't patch but we have a God who
[1:13:08] can be touched even when we can't touch
[1:13:11] one another even when we are unable to
[1:13:16] touch like we want to we're unable to do
[1:13:18] for one another like we want to but we
[1:13:21] have a god who's able to touch and we
[1:13:24] are able to touch him touch as I said
[1:13:28] matters number the Branham something
[1:13:32] you'll find if you listened to prayer
[1:13:33] lines brother Branham will say this
[1:13:35] he'll say what did she touch she said
[1:13:37] that 79 times that I found in the
[1:13:39] message what did she touch or he'll say
[1:13:42] what did he touch he said that 31 times
[1:13:45] that I found 28 times he says what did
[1:13:49] they touch you'll get down he'll go
[1:13:52] through the crowd and it'll always be
[1:13:54] people in the crowd that are away from
[1:13:57] him and he'll begin to call him out and
[1:14:01] deserve and tell them their name where
[1:14:03] they come from and all these things that
[1:14:04] he'll say what did she touch what did he
[1:14:06] touch what did they touch you see God's
[1:14:10] not limited to just up here but maybe
[1:14:14] somebody in the nursery somebody in the
[1:14:16] back room somebody that's wrestling with
[1:14:18] a baby somebody that's taking care of
[1:14:21] their children see well I shouldn't even
[1:14:22] come
[1:14:23] to church but you can touch it and so he
[1:14:27] would call him out he'd say what did
[1:14:29] they touch what did she touch what did
[1:14:30] he touch and even speaks and I want us
[1:14:37] to get this tonight as we think about it
[1:14:40] touching we want to touch Christ but we
[1:14:44] also want to touch one another
[1:14:45] and I mean in a deeper way than just
[1:14:48] physically touching one another
[1:14:49] but we want to impact one another's
[1:14:52] lives and sometimes being at a service
[1:14:56] and physically touching someone or
[1:14:59] waving at someone or saying hello
[1:15:02] impacts their life in a certain way the
[1:15:07] fact that you are at a service and I
[1:15:09] don't fully understand this but brother
[1:15:11] BAM talks about how the way one child
[1:15:13] behaves in one service in the sanctuary
[1:15:15] could be could affect the next service
[1:15:18] my children over the years have caused
[1:15:22] some bad services later but but brother
[1:15:27] Branham talks about that right brother
[1:15:28] Allen that's right I know y'all have
[1:15:32] kids so mine are getting older I can I
[1:15:35] can preach about this but it's not I'm
[1:15:38] not saying that a negative way it's just
[1:15:39] cause and effect the things we do but
[1:15:42] think about us older folks that are able
[1:15:44] to sit up and listen come to church if
[1:15:46] we come it affects the service every
[1:15:49] person who comes to a service affects
[1:15:52] that service every person who's
[1:15:56] president has some effect for good or
[1:15:59] bad or whatever it is has some effect on
[1:16:01] that service now listen to this brother
[1:16:05] Branham calls out a man in the audience
[1:16:06] he says you think you'd get over them
[1:16:08] ulcers said you was praying for that
[1:16:11] wasn't you sir he said I don't know you
[1:16:13] do I never seen you in my life he said
[1:16:17] that's right raise up your hand you're a
[1:16:19] nervous person real nervous
[1:16:21] I identify with this man sometimes back
[1:16:24] here I can't hardly think and and
[1:16:27] brother Helens seen me just Spectre a
[1:16:28] few times knows I'm nervous before
[1:16:30] church sometimes I'm nervous standing up
[1:16:34] here many times but
[1:16:36] this man was a nervous man I identify
[1:16:38] with that I know what that's like that
[1:16:40] you're a nervous person real nervous
[1:16:41] which just caused you to have ulcers
[1:16:44] he said go on and preach the word now
[1:16:47] you're a preacher anyhow he said so you
[1:16:50] go preach the word well that's wonderful
[1:16:52] but look where he goes with it
[1:16:55] he said you got your arms around your
[1:16:58] friend there so he must have put his arm
[1:17:02] around or on the back of the Pew or the
[1:17:05] seat where his friend was I come with
[1:17:08] into the meeting maybe he saw him he was
[1:17:11] struggling or something I don't know
[1:17:12] what it was but you can imagine any
[1:17:14] number of reasons why I might have had
[1:17:16] his arm around this other man and he
[1:17:21] said I see got your arms around your
[1:17:23] friend so what do you think about this
[1:17:25] sir you believe me to be his prophet or
[1:17:26] a servant you do if he were revealed to
[1:17:28] me what you want will you accept it now
[1:17:30] he's speaking to the man that the other
[1:17:31] man had his arms around he's already
[1:17:33] talked to the preacher he's pretty
[1:17:35] speaking to the other man he said of
[1:17:37] course you're wearing glasses a man your
[1:17:39] age should wear glasses
[1:17:40] praise the Lord I've gotten scripture
[1:17:43] for it or I've got message for it maybe
[1:17:50] we won't we won't make a doctrine out of
[1:17:51] that but I said a man your age should
[1:17:53] wear glasses but that's not it said your
[1:17:56] eyes are going bad you want prayer for
[1:17:59] your eyes that's what you want you've
[1:18:00] got arthritis too you want prayer for
[1:18:02] that so that's right isn't it man had
[1:18:04] some problems about the problems that a
[1:18:07] man that age probably would have right
[1:18:10] but he said that's right isn't it he
[1:18:13] said are you except you're healing now
[1:18:15] he said raise up your hand if you do
[1:18:17] it's over you can go home be well your
[1:18:20] faith has healed you he said what did
[1:18:23] they touch I want you to notice how God
[1:18:27] works because God can use you to touch
[1:18:32] him for someone else so it's like a
[1:18:37] connection you touch him and you touch
[1:18:39] your brother or your sister your wife or
[1:18:41] your children you impact their lives God
[1:18:44] can use you to touch him for someone
[1:18:47] else he said what did they
[1:18:50] you know reverently what did they touch
[1:18:52] before god I've never seen either man
[1:18:54] know nothing of them but someone was
[1:18:57] praying it was the big man there was
[1:19:00] doing the praying man identified with
[1:19:03] this quote it was the big man there was
[1:19:06] doing the prank and because he was
[1:19:09] sitting with his body around the other
[1:19:11] man as a contact
[1:19:13] that's what done it for the next man the
[1:19:17] next man wasn't even praying
[1:19:21] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:19:24] that man was praying someone was praying
[1:19:26] was the big man doing the praying and he
[1:19:28] was standing with his body around the
[1:19:30] other man is the contact that's what
[1:19:31] done it for the next man he said now ask
[1:19:34] for them hey bet
[1:19:36] they were both healed they were both
[1:19:39] called out because the big man was there
[1:19:42] now what if the big man didn't come to
[1:19:43] church well number one his friend may
[1:19:46] not have come and if he had come he to
[1:19:48] baby been sitting alone no one would
[1:19:51] have had their arm around him maybe he'd
[1:19:53] have never been called out you say these
[1:19:56] things don't matter it does matter
[1:19:57] brother branham would take a vision and
[1:19:59] it would have to be exactly the same way
[1:20:01] everything would have to be just in
[1:20:02] order the way it was or he wouldn't pray
[1:20:04] for the person until it was because the
[1:20:07] vision had to be exactly correct God
[1:20:09] knew exactly who would be here tonight
[1:20:11] and if you had your arm around someone
[1:20:14] if you were touching someone if you had
[1:20:16] some contact with someone that you
[1:20:18] helped them get here and you invited
[1:20:20] them maybe you brought them here maybe
[1:20:21] it's a member of your family but God
[1:20:23] puts you in their life for a reason and
[1:20:25] God put this man in the other man's life
[1:20:28] for a reason the big man he put him in
[1:20:30] his life for a reason because the other
[1:20:32] man needed to be healed hey babe
[1:20:36] he said now ask them God be the judge he
[1:20:39] said now does Jesus Christ remain oh ask
[1:20:43] yourself this question tonight before we
[1:20:45] close does Jesus Christ remain the the
[1:20:48] high priest that can be touched with the
[1:20:50] feeling of our infirmities hey man do we
[1:20:53] believe it tonight does he remain the
[1:20:55] high priest that can be touched with the
[1:20:57] feeling of our infirmities
[1:20:58] is he alive tonight if he's alive
[1:21:01] tonight then he's still able you're
[1:21:03] still able to
[1:21:04] touch him and you're still able to touch
[1:21:05] others hey bet your presence still has
[1:21:10] an impact your presence in the house of
[1:21:13] God your present senses in the body of
[1:21:16] Christ as a member of a local church it
[1:21:18] has something to offer
[1:21:20] why because you can touch him
[1:21:24] hey bet and you can touch others
[1:21:27] I was impacted in my life by people who
[1:21:35] touched me and maybe you perhaps you
[1:21:37] were too in some of you that are older
[1:21:39] maybe even more closely than I was but I
[1:21:43] was impacted by people who were around a
[1:21:45] prophet and they impacted my life
[1:21:48] because they knew him and maybe they
[1:21:50] didn't get everything right maybe they
[1:21:52] even messed up and didn't do the right
[1:21:54] things but there was just something
[1:21:55] they'd been near him and so there's just
[1:21:56] little tidbits that come down him and so
[1:21:59] we learned what a prophet was like and
[1:22:01] and we learned that God made himself
[1:22:04] real in our generation and God does some
[1:22:08] things for us sometimes we don't even
[1:22:09] understand and if you go to a message
[1:22:12] called the future home of the heavenly
[1:22:15] bridegroom and the earthly bride brother
[1:22:16] Branham in that wonderful message has a
[1:22:21] discernment line kind of at the end he
[1:22:23] just calls out people in the audience
[1:22:25] and there's people sitting there who
[1:22:28] were from this area and sister Alexander
[1:22:32] and sister Brown we're both I believe
[1:22:35] from this area sister Brown and not at
[1:22:36] the time but just a brown was at the
[1:22:38] time lived up by Alton Missouri mr. may
[1:22:42] brown and he said while he's speaking
[1:22:46] after he spoke sister Alexander and
[1:22:48] before he spoke to sister Brown he said
[1:22:50] what did she touch he said the same
[1:22:53] thing that woman with the blood issue
[1:22:56] touch the border of his garment not mine
[1:23:03] he speaks to sister Brown and I'm going
[1:23:07] to read it to save time but he speaks to
[1:23:09] sister Brown and he talks about how does
[1:23:12] she have sinus trouble and and she
[1:23:15] didn't come there she was kind of like
[1:23:16] that that man
[1:23:17] sitting beside the other man she just
[1:23:18] happened to be there she didn't come
[1:23:20] there for her own trouble but for a
[1:23:21] friend and she was just there at that
[1:23:24] service just happened to be there she
[1:23:26] didn't understand what he was saying she
[1:23:29] didn't bless her heart sister Brown when
[1:23:31] she was 19 years old she she had some
[1:23:33] knowledge of this message but it wasn't
[1:23:35] what maybe we would have today sitting
[1:23:38] here she was a wonderful person and I
[1:23:40] was privileged to be her pastor but she
[1:23:42] maybe didn't know those things but she
[1:23:44] touched Christ and somehow sitting out
[1:23:47] there and brother man makes his
[1:23:48] statement he said I don't know you but
[1:23:50] he does it and he called her out by name
[1:23:55] and he let her live long enough so that
[1:23:57] I could sit in her living room and
[1:23:59] listen to her tell me the story and I
[1:24:01] would sit there as her pastor at the
[1:24:03] time and listen to her tell me the story
[1:24:05] and I'm sitting there and that it just
[1:24:07] becomes such a touchstone for me because
[1:24:09] people can say well it's not true and I
[1:24:10] can say I know sister Brown to be a
[1:24:12] saint of God who told that story for for
[1:24:16] six 50 or 60 years from before she
[1:24:18] passed away at the age of 100 and I knew
[1:24:21] that she was a saint and a woman of God
[1:24:23] and so that would become something I
[1:24:25] knew that if she touched Christ through
[1:24:27] brother Brian's ministry I could touch
[1:24:30] Christ as well even though brother
[1:24:32] Branham was gone he said why did they
[1:24:34] touch what did they touch he wasn't a
[1:24:37] man but they touched the same thing that
[1:24:40] the woman with the bloody shoe touch o
[1:24:41] church what do we need to touch him with
[1:24:45] a different kind of touch we need to
[1:24:47] touch him with a touch of faith a touch
[1:24:49] of expectation a touch of desperation
[1:24:52] God let me get through until I know that
[1:24:56] other people may not know the church may
[1:24:58] not know you may not even get his
[1:25:00] attention for everybody to know but she
[1:25:03] knew and when she knew then he knew and
[1:25:07] so she touched just to him of His
[1:25:09] garment he couldn't feel it physically
[1:25:11] but it drained the strength out of him
[1:25:13] why because that virtue went out to heal
[1:25:16] her oh my if we could only touch him our
[1:25:19] services would be different if we could
[1:25:21] reach out and touch him our response to
[1:25:24] the Word of God would be different if we
[1:25:25] can reach out and touch him how he how
[1:25:27] we feel about God
[1:25:29] different just reach out grab hold of
[1:25:33] the hem of his garment they couldn't
[1:25:36] come in the Old Testament to the border
[1:25:38] of the mountain but she could come to
[1:25:41] the border of the garments of Christ and
[1:25:44] say if I can just touch it I'll be well
[1:25:48] hey Ben amen do you believe it tonight
[1:25:52] do you love him amen
[1:25:55] then if we believe that he's still the
[1:25:58] same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:00] would you just raise your hands to him
[1:26:01] tonight just touch him things aren't
[1:26:05] like we want them to be right now we
[1:26:07] want to be able to touch one another
[1:26:08] shake hands with one another but I want
[1:26:10] to know that I can still touch him I can
[1:26:13] still touch him when you reach out today
[1:26:15] you can still touch him you don't have
[1:26:16] to wait for another time you don't have
[1:26:18] to wait for another service or a
[1:26:19] high-powered evangelist to come through
[1:26:21] you can touch him right now you can
[1:26:23] touch him by faith tonight and you can
[1:26:25] know that you touched him and say um
[1:26:27] I'll be well I know I'll be well
[1:26:30] Heavenly Father we love you tonight we
[1:26:33] thank you that we're able to touch you

[1:26:44] touching you in that way I don't want to
[1:26:46] sing I don't want to congregate Lord
[1:26:48] with my brothers and sisters unless I've
[1:26:50] touched you oh god I pray father that
[1:26:53] you would just move in this little
[1:26:55] audience tonight I pray that you'd break

[1:27:04] know that you can that we can feel it so

[1:27:12] may not have been on this child and run
[1:27:14] over the building but I touch God

[1:27:18] supernatural and when I did I know that
[1:27:21] everything's gonna be okay
[1:27:23] Fred granted tonight Lord I pray you at
[1:27:27] heal every disease every sickness father
[1:27:32] in this age when diseases are flying

[1:28:10] I've touched you Lord father and if I
[1:28:13] touch you then I can touch my brother my
[1:28:15] sister and I know that you can do
[1:28:17] something for them as well I mean we all
[1:28:19] feel that way Lord Father that we can
[1:28:22] touch not just for ourselves but for
[1:28:24] those we come in contact with that we
[1:28:27] can touch them like the man did just had
[1:28:29] his arm around him
[1:28:30] Oh God may we be willing to do that
[1:28:32] doesn't matter how wrong the man may be
[1:28:35] doesn't matter doesn't matter whether
[1:28:37] the sister maybe talked about us sir
[1:28:38] something was different but God we want
[1:28:40] to be able to put our arms around him
[1:28:42] give him the right hand of fellowship
[1:28:43] shake hands with them and when the time
[1:28:45] comes Lord we can do that and put our
[1:28:47] arm around woman Oh God so that we can
[1:28:50] know they can know that we're their
[1:28:52] brother we want to help them maybe there
[1:28:55] won't be perfect and they'll fail and
[1:28:57] fall many times but they can receive
[1:28:59] something from you if I can touch you I
[1:29:02] can touch you and I can touch my
[1:29:05] children
[1:29:06] you can make everything right if I could
[1:29:10] get a hold of your heart Lord but that
[1:29:13] virtue can flow to me then I can raise
[1:29:16] my children in the right wait if that
[1:29:18] virtue can flow to me Lord then I can
[1:29:21] rain I can help the church if not I
[1:29:23] can't do anything
