the worst things Lord that we could possibly do Lord and in the end we'll live and not die we're so thankful for your grace today so thankful for your mercy Lord I pray we'd walk worthy of that vocation we've been called to I pray we dedicate this house to you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you Hallelujah Genesis CH 49 and verse 5 we'll read down through verse 7 Genesis 49 5 and S is where Jacob is blessing the 12 tribes good to have each and every one of you with with us tonight I know we got several out tonight the Via is out I haven't heard how Haley's doing but be praying for them and then U we need to be praying for all of ours that are out brother Jeremy good to see you tonight man I always does me good to see brother Jeremy back and I know um I notice Nathan and lesle were watching tonight online and want to greet them and as well and you it's hard to find work around here and sometimes you got to do what you need to do but I'm thankful for those that are faithful to listen and watch and do what they can and so we're grateful for them my mom's out sick tonight and different ones and just believe in the Lord will take care of that amen Genesis chapter 49 and verse 5 Simeon and Levi are Brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel you know this is called Jacob's blessing on the 12 tribes that's not much of a blessing is it and yet you see two boys United together doing the same thing having the same curse really given to them and they went completely different directions we want to talk talk about that tonight God bless you as uh we uh have our seats this evening I want to continue our series on the sons of Jacob we found out about Reuben that God can take a a a terrible situation a terrible mistake that Ruben made and a a passion that he had and God turned that around and actually become a benefit uh to the people of God and in the end all wrongs were made right and we find you had a place there in the land in in in the Millennium and so we're thankful that God is a god of mercy and God is a god of Grace and he doesn't change his thought towards us and and the sons of Jacob were all we could say predestined elected they were called by God they were God's chosen people and yet they messed up and and they had trouble and all of that but yet God brought them out and I'm so thankful he brings us out but the Levi I'm glad I'm going preach on Levi tonight a little bit and I'm glad that LE that that that God brought us out and and he he gave us another chance and he he's given us the ability in this hour to live above what we would naturally be and so we have not a natural allotment but a spiritual allotment and and and we have a place in the house of God we have a place in the economy of God we have a place in the things of the god in the word of God and so brother brandham talked about this and the reason I'm dealing with that uh he said there's a great lesson he said that sometime I hope to be able to bring it to son of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she Gran at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe he said the great thing all someone say all all the word of God fits right together if it doesn't fit together it's not God's word that's Misfit it's your thought in God's word your thought is misfitting to the word it all fits together so we want to get our thoughts and line them up with the word of God I'm not attempting uh to do what brother brandom wouldn't do or didn't do or preach a message he didn't preach but to take what he did say in different places and compare it with scripture the Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction and righteousness so we want to look at the scripture and that's our real meat isn't it is the word of God that's where we get our that's where we live as Christians that's what we live by so when we when we look at the scripture especially when we're looking at the Old Testament we need to remember this rule that we need to ask ourselves where is Christ in it where is Christ in it because brother Brenham tells us he is the principal theme of the entire Bible is Christ so if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse of it go back and read it again so we we want to ask ourselves as we read this as we look at these things where is Christ in it because he'll show up somewhere and he shows up everywhere because all of the Old Testament types and shadows point to him and they are all fulfilled in him they all point to him and they are all fulfilled in him just as the New Testament points to the bride and is fulfilled in the bride the Old Testament points to Christ and is fulfilled in Christ every scripture dovetails with the rest of the Bible you ever heard that term dovetail it's what they do remember how they used to make furniture they would take a piece of furniture and they would dovetail it together they would I always love to see that because that means the furniture is old because people just don't do that anymore and maybe some people do the mark might do that when he builds a piece of furniture but they would dovetail it together and it would lock together so brother brandham taught us that scripture dovetails together and he taught us if our if it doesn't our understanding is wrong but when we get our in the end what picture do we want the picture is Christ the picture is Christ now we want to deal tonight with Simeon and Levi Simeon and Levi are linked together in Jacob's prophecy yes and he said instruments of Cruelty are in their habitation and as I've already told you they're linked together but they have very different outcomes and we went over that last week we got to overcome right we got something a place we got to fight something we got to do to be able to overcome because we're all born in in sin shapen in iniquity come into the world speaking lies and yet we have a spiritual land that belongs to us something we should possess something that we've been called to do a place that we've been called to and settled in and and we got to possess that we got to become a part of that and yet Satan's going to do everything that he can to keep us away from that and so the battle is to our position it's not a battle to become sons of God we can't make ourselves sons of God but if you are a son of God you battle and you fight for your position you young men you battle for the position that God called a young man to be in this age you us older people we battle for the position that God called whether it's a pastor or or an evangelist or a song leader or or or a prayer Warrior Whatever It Is God called you and wants you to be you got to battle you got to fight for that position and you got to overcome in that position right and so every every inch of it is yours but you got to fight for every inch of it good so siming and Levi are are are are together in this blessing or this prophecy and it's a common theme to The Scriptures you look at Jacob and Esau he said I'll take one and leave one and even uh even all through the scriptures you'll find that uh he said there'll be two and one in a bed and I'll take one and leave one and and I love one and and love the other less and so there's all kinds of of examples of that in the scripture and yet this difference they were both sons they were both elected they were both called but not to the same thing so in Genesis 29:33 the Bible tells us how Simeon was born Simeon means hearing or for God has heard it's she conceived again and bear son this is Leah uh the wife of Jacob and she said because the Lord hath heard that I was hated yet therefore give me this son also she called his name Simeon Ruben had already been born and so she's saying this is my payback this is my revenge you remember there's a little bit of a war going on in the household cuz Jacob had W too many wives right anytime you have one too many wives there's war in the house on so Jac jaob had one too many wives there's war in the household so Leah says now now I've had two sons and and Rachel hasn't had any yeah so this is my revenge so this is the Lord has heard me and I have another another son and and Levi in the next verse Levi means joined it literally is adhesive glue glue and we'll we'll see how this uh matters after a while but in Genesis 29:34 she conceived again and Bar son said now this time will my husband be joined unto me it's the same idea of cleaving husband and wife cleaving to one another because I have borne him three sons therefore was his name called Levi so Levi means joined or cleaved to and Jacob when he when he's giving this this prophecy over their lives he he continues in Genesis 49:6 he says oh my soul come not thou into the secret to their assembly my honor be not thou United in other words I don't want my name associated with them I don't want to I don't want to be around them I don't want to be identified with them for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall and you can find the story we won't go into the story tonight maybe we'll get to it later but in Genesis 34 you find a horrific story of Retribution and revenge that when Dina the daughter of Jacob was taken and and and abused really by a young man there in the city yet he wanted to marry her and he tried to make it right and so what do we need to do and they said well you just have all the men of the city circumcised and they did that and then when it's it's it's pretty terrible then when they did that Simeon and Levi destroy the whole city take everybody captive it's brutal right and they did it for a reason it was redneck retribution you can say right they said and you can see some of that in Israel today you can still see a strain of that that if you kill one of ours we'll kill a million of yours right we're going to do that we're going to make it so massive that it's shock and all right you don't mess with us and so that's what it was but Jacob said it was wrong yeah and because it wasn't inspired by God it wasn't in the word right it was their own anger was their own temper are you with me now and so they destroyed an a whole city out of out of Retribution uh Genesis 49:7 cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel so they're neither one given a land or or or a territory with boundaries within the land of Israel if you look at a map and I don't have a map here tonight but if you look at a map of the tribes it looks like simeon's got a spot right in the middle of Judah and the truth is it was just certain cities that Simeon had within Judah they would always be overshadowed by ruled by and a part of Judah and you'll find that the Levites were spread of course you know more famously uh throughout the land they were not uh the Levites did not have a land at all and they ended up serving in the temple right and again both tribes under the same prophecy right under the same you know and many times we want to use our upbringing or what we come out of or what we come through sort of an excuse for the way that we are and yet you'll find two people coming under the same uh sort of set of circumstances and they end up in different places right why because of decisions that are made and and things that that are done and though they may be very similar yet they're not the same right they're not the same they're they're two different boys they're uh they have two different Futures so uh they had vastly different outcomes now the tribe of I and that's why we should never feel bad about somebody because of their family right right because you could have one person be Hitler but not everybody in the family's Hitler right like literally Hitler as people like to say today you you could have one person be a a murderer a and another boy in the same family and you could look at that maybe a serial killer and look at him and say well this and this and this what caused him but maybe his brother went through the same stuff right and he never become that and you see a difference in outcomes and maybe at the beginning you couldn't tell the difference but as they grow you begin to see what they are so the tribe of Simeon is missing from the blessing of Moses in Deuteronomy if you go to Deuteronomy you'll find all of the the tribes where Moses is blessing the tribes the tribe of Simeon is not even in there and we find that Simeon was Jacob's second oldest son his progeny uh never achieved a position of prominence in Israel before after the conquest and occupation of Canaan and they provided no judges the song of Deborah contains no references to the group you say why did that happen brother Ben because of anger now now let me get I know we're we're Wednesday night crowd tonight but but just let me be frank with you and I'm not preaching at you because as far as I know we got a fine lovely group of people that never lose their temper but we're going to talk about that tonight because it does make a difference and we'll find out what that is and what causes it now they did fight along with Judah and they were included in judah's territory again we can look at these young men these and these tribes and realize they weren't you know they weren't all bad right they they had some good parts some good things that they did and yet they were a part of Judah Joshua 19:1 says the second lot came forth to Simeon even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of of Judah out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon the part of the children of Judah was too much for them therefore the children of Simon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them you'll find that at the beginning of the Exodus Simeon had uh I think the second most numbers of people uh in their tribe and by the end of The Exodus they had the fewest were the smallest tribe and there's a reason for that we'll get to it in just a moment I hope I'm not boring you tonight are you still with me so they they lived in in the desert part of Judah they lived in the neb desert they fought constantly because they lived on the border and they lived in a part of the land where was wild it never was quite settled so we find that they did not multiply like Judah did you'll find in 1st Chronicles 4: 24- 27 it lists the sons of Simeon the grandsons and great grandson and it gets down to shemiah in 1 Chronicles 4:27 it says shemiah had 16 sons and six daughters now that's a big family 16 of scks brother Joe you got a ways to go and and so he had what is that 16 and six 24 22 thank you brother Bill I can't count either so he had 22 children and yet but it said his Brethren had not many children and neither did all their family multiply like to the children of Judah so they became a very small tribe because Simeon took the punishment of the men of Sheck into his own hands his family suffered look the Bible tells us in Romans 12:19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto wrath give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord therefore listen what we should do listen if you feel like you've been wronged if you feel like that that somebody's done something that's angered you here's what to do about it if thine enemy hunger feed him come on church if he thirst we're not talking about your family we're not of course we would if our children are thirsty we give them a drink of water before they go to bed right but if our children are thirsty we we water we give them water if our if our children are hungry we give them food if our brother or our sister are hungry or thirsty we'd help them right yes but what he say to do he said don't take Vengeance into your own hand if your enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing shalt thou Heap coals of fire on his head it may not change him it may make him worse but you are it's the the retribution is not coming from you the Vengeance isn't coming from you listen what Paul says be not overcome of evil other words don't let it consume you yeah right people do horrible things people say horrible things people make a mess out of things because they're human beings and and and this was an awful thing that the that the people of that town of sheam did to the to dinina the daughter of Jacob but he said don't be like this don't don't don't take retribution into your own hand don't be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good this is where we live church I know we like to hear great Mysteries and things and we want to hear about who we are and and and that's part of it and we want to preach that and we want to preach the blessings of God but this is where we live you've got to have a get to a place where there's no desire for Retribution but you can bless those that bless that curse you and curse or bless those that that do wrong and despitefully use you listen we got we got to be born again to do that you can't do that in yourself you can't do that according to the old man the old man always wants retribution he always wants to get back he always wants to get even it takes something else on the inside it takes a new birth yes brother brand said Satan does not tempt down in here he tempts out here in the flesh right he tempts you in your flesh in your spirit not in your soul he has no access to your soul your soul is sealed right by the blood but he tempts You In the Flesh he said for instance you go down the street tomorrow you're walking along well if I could whistle I'd whistle a song but he said singing Christian songs and he out there singing every promise in the book is mine you're so happy you know and somebody says you know you're just a hypocrite and you say well that don't bother you that don't bother you you ought to try getting a text you know you ever got a text just basically says you're a hypocrite I have multiple times and you say well why brother Ben what were you doing nothing that I could discern person just decided I was a hypocrite yeah but see it's what we do about it what are we going to do about it he said when you hear that you're just a hypocrite talking about you yeah right talking about you now that's a Temptation he said now the first thing your flesh picks that up in the ear and it suggests to the Mind get even with him now come on church I'm not the only one that deals with temptation am I yeah so you got your fingers poised over the keyboard if anybody still uses Facebook on their computer right you're sitting there like are you're like this you know got your thumbs ready boy I'm going to get back he shouldn't have said that right and you're ready to get back at them you're ready to I know this is sometimes difficult to hear church but we need to hear it come on you're you're ready to speak you're ready to to to repay H hundredfold what they did to you he said it's suggested to the Mind get even with it time it gets back here he says oh I love it this back here says vengeance is mine sayith the Lord I will repay amen sometimes we just got to give it a minute and that's what Paul's talking about when he talks about giving space to anger right giving giving it space don't don't don't don't don't don't let he said be angry and sin not Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath yeah right it takes time don't get don't don't immediately respond yeah because you respond in the flesh so and that's what makes social media so Danger ous so because it's instant and you want they want an instant response so the souls under the altar you remember we we touched on this not long ago but brother random said they could not be the bride remember why because they cried for vengeance yes he said notice they were crying out for vengeance they cannot be bride material yeah the bride turns the cheek on and cries forgive them Father they know not what they do I say God help me to be a part of that bride I know I can't put myself there but let me act like that's what I am cuz I believe that's what I am in my heart yes forgive them Father they know not what they do why because that's what he did and the bride has his Spirit on him she's flesh of his on her she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bones 1 Peter 2:21 for even here and two were you're called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example and I repeated this many times in fact the man that I learned this from died the other day and it kind of made me sad cuz it was so vivid in my mind when I heard him preach it he he said that that word example means the model of handwriting copied by a school boy and if you can go back and remember when you were young right some of you young people can remember when you were young you can remember when you were in kindergarten and you wanted to write and you didn't write well and I still don't write well but I remember what it was like to sit there and and the letters on the Blackboard were so perfect because the teacher was so good at writing it and I was terrible at writing the same letter but what would happen is she'd come up beside me and and as I tried to trace the letter she would actually take my hand and she would move the the pencil and and and and cause the outline until mine look just like hers that's what we need church we have an example set and we need the teacher to come by and and get inside out of us and move our hand move our our body to match his word it's the only way you'll ever follow his steps you're never going to do in the flesh it's got to be something on the inside that moves you Oh my he said he you he's left us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was G found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live into righteousness by whose Stripes you is anybody sick tonight by whose Stripes you were healed you were healed you're already healed you just have to believe it yes amen good brother brandham has asked a question I know this may seem like it's out of left field but it has it's it's on the same topic brother Bram has asked the question where are the spirits that went into the swine you ever think about that where'd they go they stay in the swine cuz they the swine died immediately the swine ran off the cliff and killed themselves so where are the spirits that went into the swine now brother Brandon begins to explain that it's a long explanation I won't read it all tonight but he he goes into an explanation of how this works and he tells us he said you never you never cast out a devil by the wrong attitude and he he types it to that Maniac you remember in Portland you remember he was a maniac he had no control over himself that demon controlled him and so he come to brother brandom and said I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to kill you right I'm GNA beat you up or whatever that he threatened to do and brother BR said you don't cast out a devil by the wrong attitude it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force that there is in the world he said now if you notice a devil is always hate right you young people remember that a devil is always hate I don't care if it's a preacher I don't care if it's a a politician I don't care if it's a your neighbor no matter who it is that hates people it's a devil making them do that right God don't hate right right you say well he hated Esau he loved Esau less go look up the word right he hates him in comparison to the love that he had for the elect he said you're to hate your mother and father sister and brother for his sake but you love him less then you do him then you do the word but but the devil is always hate and out now hatred a temper an uncontrollable uh vile towards someone is actually a devil we need to understand that a devil is always hate hater is of the devil he said and when people hate someone remember it is a terrible devil to despise or dislike you mustn't do that so even when we get little things between us you know you get a little something and something will happen that's just the flesh right it'll happen it happens but when you dwell on it when you keep dwell you know what's influencing you to do that right it's a devil huh that's right that's what brother brandom taught us where did the demons go that went out of the swine well he said some of them was in this man in Portland he said Demons of hate so and he said sometimes it'll come in a mild or religious form he said as long as he can keep you thinking you're saved and you're not he'd be fine with that you might be a good person he said but if he has to he said it may be like cigarettes he starts with cigarettes if that's all he needs to keep you in sin then that's what he'll do but he said if if not he'll progress to marijuana and he'll progress to drugs and he'll Pro progress to other things right it becomes a Gateway because he'll do whatever it takes to keep you from listening to the word and he taught us that Spirits never die and he said we have the spirit of Christ he said now the spirit of Elijah upon John would make John act like Elijah you remember he was out in the Wilderness and and the things that he did he acted like Elijah if the spirit of Elijah on John would make John act like Elijah the spirit of God upon you will make you act like Jesus how many want to act like Jesus how can we do that by the spirit of God he said now there's where you find the Holy Spirit that's what makes the Holy Spirit does that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes you Meek makes you humble makes you forgiving oh this is good I find it a challenge sir he said could they pull whiskers from your face if you had them there now come on I know some of y'all some of y'all got impressive looking beards could someone come up to you it's a question we need to ask ourselves and again you say well what if the answer is no you need to let the Holy Spirit have control in your life more as do I are you with me now could someone pull whiskers could they pull whiskers from your face if you had them there jerk them out and spit in your face when you had the power to call Legions of angels we weren't virgin born were we we were born in sin so there's something here that rises up against them but he didn't and we have his Spirit which is supposed to overpower our human nature he said when when you had the power to call Legions of angels could you do that for the love of the people that was spitting in your face so if you were the one spitting in my face and pulling out my beard for for for your salvation for the love that I had for you could I just let you do it and just stand there if I had the power to call Legions of angels if somebody just walked up to you and said hey you hypocrite and smacked you on one side of the face could you pray for their forgiveness I don't want to show a hands but maybe write it down take it home and study it right could you pray for their forgiveness now listen how serious it is he said that's where ATT test whether you got the Holy Spirit or not he said when somebody says something evil against someone because and he was counteracting this idea that if you speak in tongues you have the Holy Ghost right and and they teach that don't think about Paul steal people teach if you speak in tongues that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost there people who teach that but brother brother brandom tells us he said that's not the evidence he said here's a better evidence right not the only one but a better one he said could you do that when somebody says something evil against someone sometimes that claims to have the Holy Spirit I I'll get even with her if it takes me my last day he said now there's where you check about your Holy Spirit on now we're just getting right down to the road now aren't we boy I'm enjoying preaching tonight oh God help me I want to be I'm preaching at me too blessed are you when men shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name say but you go get even with him no he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so person persecuted they the prophets which were before you when someone says evil about you say something good if you can't say something good about them don't say nothing just let it go and then when you get to yourself pray for them oh my I found the closer I am to God the more I'm prayed up I am the more the more I've I I've beat down the flesh if that makes sense like Paul said I keep under my body the more that I haven't catered to the flesh the more I'm able to do this because the spirit of Christ does that brother brand tells the story again he's still answering this question where did the spirits go that left the swine and so he goes he talks about the boys that he tried to shoot you remember the story brother brandom had a temper with a capital T and he went out when he was I I can't remember how old maybe 12 years old and he went out and and some boys started teasing him and they called him a squab they called him it was a halfbreed because his I believe his mother was part Indian and so he they called him that and he got angry he run home and got his 22 rifle and he comes back and he and he uh he comes back out and he hides and waits on him going to be a prophet huh but he had a temper before he got saved right it was out of control he goes back and he he hides and waits on them and when they come along he throws a shell in and he squeezes the trigger and it don't go off and he used every shell that he had and it just spit out on the ground and he said he he got so mad he was crying maniacally he said them boys running and screaming cuz they knew he was trying to shoot him he said when they left he tried those bullets again and every one of them worked God was keeping him but what was happening was his temper was out of control and he said I knew I was saved he said when people after I got met God he said down there by the Ohio river and got the Holy Ghost he says when people tried to do that to me he said people laughed at me made fun of me called me a Holy Roller he said I I didn't have that action anymore that I used to have and it told him he said that man I knew that I was saved oh Church it'll change you it changes more than our dress it changes more than just going to church or saying I believe the message but it changes who we are he and he goes back and takes that to the demons and the swine he and he said they they said don't torment us before the time comes but if you'll cast us out look at the meanness of them the wicked wickedness he said if you're going to cast us out don't let us just go free out into the world cuz hard tell where we'll get into somebody else they were just itching to to possess something right they were just mean he said that's that we want to do we want to be in somebody we want to do something we want to do some more meanness that's the devil I'll get back with him see that's the devil I'll get even with him just remember it's your brother standing there but the devil got on him come on church every time you get there thinking I'll get even with them it's the devil God don't think like that GE and so they said let us do something mean we can make those gatherin over here suffer for this m have said the head one of them so the head demon he says let let's do some more meanness what is there around it's a desert place all there was was a herd of swine and so they said let us go down into that herd of swine Jesus said take your Leaf but come out of him Oh my he said little bitty guy like that speaking that big Legion of devils come out of him you have your Lea and they got into those Hogs and they had fits the demons had fits run them Hogs into fits and down the way they went to the river and drowned in the river choked themselves in the river is that right he said of course the Devils went out of them cuz it killed the Hogs it just run them into a fit they had a fit just like anyone you didn't expect this did you huh did you ever see a person have a temper fit that's what Simeon had that's what Levi had did you ever see a person have a temper fit well that's just what it is that's just them Devils that's what happened to them right what happened to the Devils every time you've ever thrown a fit yeah come on church one of them fit throwing swine demons huh was perched on your shoulder come out of a pig and wants to anoint you to hurt somebody come come on right we just need to recognize what it is yeah there's still around right they're still here in the atmosphere maybe in this building tonight right fent throwing swine demons want to get you to get back at your neighbor wanted to get you to retribution to have the last word God help us today yeah he said you ever see one of them have a temper fit said uh-huh he said when you see them having a temper fit he said say uh-huh I know what happened in gadera now some swine demons see we shouldn't make excuses for it Church it is never right to lose our temper you say well I I I do that well you need to pray you need to talk to God you need to repent it's not right to lose our temper whether we do it in the Pulpit or in the Pew right or as deacons or trustees or whatever it is that we are a temper fit is of the devil said well you don't know what they did they played my song in the wrong key it doesn't matter right and that's exactly what happens that's how churches get in an embro just just I said that wrong but anyway a cauldron of of uh of of of Spide and hatefulness what is it all them swine demons thousands of them that was in Legion remember they went into a whole herd of swine and brother BR said when they come many of them come together they they they cause Legion to go insane yeah right but in one person they'll come and they'll they'll just talk to you and they'll come and whisper in your ear and say get back at that brother get back at that sister oh I think it's time we took go look at the word and realize what that was and said I'm not going to be a part of that I'm a Child of God I'm a Son of God I belong I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't get retribution vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord let your Inside Man speak and speak the word brother Bron said just a few more come in there in Legion running complete complely insane yeah cuz the medical doctor will tell you that temper is the first stage of insanity on you remember that the next time you throw something in your house huh see brother Ben what are people doing nothing far as I know y'all are the calmest bunch of people there on are on the face of the Earth but remember what causes it young people when you get mad at each other have a spat just remember Y young couples when you when you get to fighting mad and start throwing things punching the wall say well message people don't do that I've patched holes before not ones I punched though what is that right it don't mean you're lost it don't mean you're not a child of God it just means you've been listening to them swine demons right but if you're not careful they'll drive you completely insane because temper is the first stage of insanity every every time you lose your temper I'm I'm I'm hammering this home because we're going to get to something here in a minute every time you lose your temper and go off on somebody it's a spirit not even swine could live with it's Insanity the Bible says wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear so to speak so to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God are yall okay still out there everybody breathing everybody all right Jonah's all right for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God being angry is normal living in that condition is not you're going to get mad sometimes you're going to get you're going to get heated up but it's not normal again the same thing as Reuben remember if you're that kind of a person you got to learn to turn the heat down right right and if you're that kind of a person like Levi or like Simeon you need to learn to turn the heat down be angry and sin not come to the water and be healed of your insanity brandom talks about it he said when the when the when the deer would be escaping The Wolves they would get bitten by the wild dogs he said they'd run for a source of water if they could get to the water they'd be okay listen to me church if you've been bitten by Temper if you've been bitten by demon of anger you got to run to the water and say Lord I'm sorry repent of that thing get to the water and let the presence of God heal you amen good we don't have to live like that The Temper carried on through look look at what Levi did now we talked about Simeon look what Levi did The Temper I don't have time to get everything about levite tonight we'll get to it maybe next Wednesday but the temper carried through to Moses who was a levite who took his own things in his own hands in Egypt right you wonder where Moses got his temper from he come by it honestly and and all he had to show for it was a stinking corpse a dead Egyptian in the sand and brother Brandon said after taking the situation in his own hand he found out he was a total failure and run from the presence of pharaoh and the presence of God was a stranger for 40 years way back and he married an Ethiopian girl and so she had a lot of temper and Moses had a lot of temper that was his trouble he said I just imagine things wasn't so peaceful back there on the back of the desert at times but God gave it to him oh wow what did God give him his wife who also had a temper yeah how do you fight fire with fire right so you he had a temper and she had a temper and and together God was working on him he said if you think you you married a woman has a little temper maybe God's trying to tame you down a little it's not only redheads that have temper is't that right someone ought to say Amen see God's trying to tame you down a little and vice versa in numbers 20 uh but I'm so glad you know Moses now watch Moses and again we have the new birth right it's a different age that we live in because we have the spirit of Christ that controls us but you watch Moses and you realize though he met the burning bush the pillar of fire and and and and it changed him and yet in the flesh he still had a flesh to deal with right he had a supernatural experience with God but he still had to deal with his flesh and so in Numbers Chapter 20 you find Moses and a Aaron gathered a the congregation together and God had told him he said Moses because the people were complaining he said about no water he said speak to the Rock speak to the Rock and bring forth water and Moses gathered the congregation together and said you talk about a sermon he said here now you rebels and preachers think they can say whatever they want to but you don't get to just say what you want to say God help us today you don't get to just act any way you want to act from the pulpit cuz you'll answer for it to God he said here now you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and listen God backed him up Moses lifted up his hand with his Rod he smoke the rock twice and the water come out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also but the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron remember who they were Levites because you believe me not to sanctify in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them brother Bram taught us that Satan tempted Moses at his weak spot and got him to break the Commandments that's what he said he said he tempted him at his weak spot and caused him to break the Commandments he said which was a type of the levite priesthood being broken because God had another priesthood greater now we're going to find Jesus in it he had another another priest said greater than the levite priesthood greater than Moses are you with me now what was it Jesus in Hebrews 6:20 tells us he was the high priest after the order of MDC not after the levite order but brother random taught us that when he showed the natural priesthood would be broken when he come against Jesus in the wilderness he said this isn't Moses right this isn't been PR this isn't some some normal man this was God in flesh what was it God was making it known that Moses wasn't God Moses was just a prophet of God and we're not God we're just the children of God but yet he said when when he come up against Jesus he realized he tried to tempt him at his weak spot his hunger and Jesus would not bow to it but he said it's also written and he defeated him by the word oh my which show that he was greater than Moses are you with me now he's greater oh my that's who we lift up today we don't preach a man we preach Jesus Christ the word the great one who with stood the Temptation and did no sin he he was MDC was greater than Levi because come on church I'm just going to hold you a few minutes longer but you you're with me I I'm sure now look MDC was greater than Levi because Levi paid tithes to MZ or or to mzc in Abraham remember Hebrews tells us that so Levi Levi though he would not have an allotment but he would be called to be a priest but yet Christ would be from a greater priesthood oh my he's greater than Levi greater than Moses and serve the Tabernacle of the Lord now in numbers 148 he talks about the tribe of Levi and I'll just introduce this to you and maybe we'll get to more of it next Wednesday the Lord willing he said for the Lord has spoken to Moses saying only Thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi neither take the Su of them among the children of Israel remember the prophecy was they would be scattered Simeon was scattered and never come to nothing yeah but Levi was scattered and God said I'm going to use now listen to me I'm going to use that temper I'm going to use that zealousness come on church I'm going to use that quickness that sharpness I'm going to use it for my purpose Hallelujah he needed somebody who would take a stand for the word so he said you're not going to have an allotment with the people of is with the children of Israel he said but thou sh appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of testimony over all the vessels over all the things that belong to it they shall encamp around the Tabernacle when the Tabernacle sets forth the levite shall take it down when the Tabernacle to be pitched the Levites shall set it up and the stranger that cometh n shall be put to death they were dispersed they were they were under that prophecy but in that they were called to serve God became their portion oh my now look at Deuteronomy chapter 33 and: 8 remember the Moses says nothing about Simeon but about Levi he said let thy thumb and thy urum be with thy Holy One whom thou did prove at Massa and with whom thou did strive at the Waters of merbah who said to his father and to his mother I have not seen him now why remember daythan and abam were reubenites remember but Kora was also there Kora was a levite and they should they could have sided with cor over Moses but they said no remember what happened when Kora and Dayan and abam left and and said who are you to be a prince Among Us and Moses said who is on the Lord's Side let him come into me and all the Levites went over to Moses right except for Kora and his family and so Moses said who said to his father to his mother have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his Brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed Thy word and kept thy Covenant he needed somebody with a Zeal now I want you to understand God don't just take all the temper out of us he don't take all the all the quickness out of us all the Zeal out of us because there's got to be somebody that'll that'll be quick to do the right thing but it's got to be controlled by the word so the children of Simeon did not controll it by the word and they become almost a nothing tribe although again they were stored in the Millennium but the children uh the children of of Levi actually become the the Serv vants of God and a type of the ministry today right why because they were sered God with all of their heart whatever they joined with remember their name meant joining whatever they joined with they joined completely with it was like glue like adhesive and when they join themselves to the Lord oh I like to see a person that'll sell out join themselves to the Lord and when this type of person joins themselves to the lord they're going to go all out right they're not going to they're not going to be a Halfway Christian they're going to serve God with all of their heart and that's what God calls into the ministry I know it's real quiet but just it takes that it takes a certain amount of zeal a certain amount of crazy come on Church a certain amount of I'm not going to look at what nobody says to take it because sometimes good men get in the ministry and they're not called for it they end up broken and bitter good men become pastors that aren't called to do it and they end up broken and bitter because they just can't handle it but God needs somebody with a Zeal I believe all of us are called to be spiritual priests and at some level we're all called to have a Zeal for God not just the preachers but every one of us are called to be Kings and Priests are you with me I got five more minutes believe it or not I have five minutes s and he said they shall teach look at verse 13 they shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law they they shall put incense before thee and a whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar bless Lord his substance and accept the work of his hands Smite through the loins of them that rise against him of them that hate him that they rise not again now why the DraStic change between Genesis and Deuteronomy God needed somebody who would be sell us for the house of the Lord see Jesus never lost his temper he didn't have no spirits that come from the swine talking in his ear and him give in to him are you with me now he never did that but yet he picked up a cat of Ninetails and drove the people from the temple now I got to I got to present to you the whole word of God tonight church we want to be like Jesus but that's also within the realm of possibility I've said before in our flesh we would sin doing that but we've got to under the the influence of the word in our Zeal not the influence of a church or a denomination or to represent ourselves but to represent the Lord look at the story of Finos and closing when the when the error of B peor be to come out and balum said we're all the same you remember that was the doctrine of balum and they come out and they begin to draw people away to them and and it come to a point where uh the uh the people were intermingling with the women from the mo Bish women and it was a great sin and a plague struck the children of Israel and one of uh well Aaron's sons Finos he took matters in his own hands just like Moses did just like Levi did he was a levite but he didn't do it to defend himself he didn't do it to defend his family he did it to save others amen are you with me now you see the balance of it sometimes you you got to get stirred church sometimes you got to wake up and realize you got to fight fight a good fight of faith and fight the battle against the enemy sometimes you got to stand for the word but you don't do it just for yourself you do it to save people's lives so Finos when the horrible sin was being committed Finos goes to a tent and he actually takes a javelin and drives it through the offending parties it's brutal it's terrible but God commended him for it why he didn't do it for himself numbers 2510 the Lord spake to Moses saying Finos the son of eler the son of Aaron the priest had turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consume not the children of Israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold I give it unto him my Covenant of Peace listen he shall have at his seat after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and he made an atonement for the children of Israel that I'm just zealous he said I know you think I'm a hard I know you think I hate women and things like that he said but I'm zealous for the church I'm zealous for the word of God I want to see things done right I'm glad we had a prophet that was zealous in our day that was willing to to to Smite that thing are you with me now I'm glad God called somebody like that and sometimes it takes that in our own lives willing just do away with sin cut it off get rid of it and serve God with all your heart was zealous you made an atonement but now watch this look how perfectly the Bible dovetails together the name of the Israelite that was slain even that was slain within the median itish woman was zimy or slain with with the medish woman was zimy the son of seu a prince of a chief house among the Simeon ites he wasn't joined with Simeon any longer in fact he was actually he was actually fighting with god with Moses with the word against the simonit now look look at the difference between the two tribes the simonit went along with the error of bpor and they almost disappeared but the Levites were zealous for the word of the Lord and though they did didn't have a land with boundaries God became their portion and we've been called to be Kings and Priests we don't have a physical land with boundaries but we have a place in God we have a word that we serve we have a spiritual offering that we can give of sacri let's be zealous about it let's be zealous with our worship let's be zealous with our with our praise let's be zealous with our preaching let's take it and say Lord I'm willing to do whatever you want me to do as means misss come the Bible says as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and this is at the end of the lean Church age he said be zealous therefore and repent brand said we don't need a Zeal for denomination we need a Zeal to say I'm wrong he said that's the Cry of the hour oh would that be our cry tonight if I've been wrong if I've let the devil influence me in some way if i' if I've lost my temper let me have a Zeal like Finos to say I'm wrong and if the sin is right here let me be willing to go into the tent and get rid of it even if it's even if it's right here as we would be in ourselves maybe maybe a type in ourselves of both Simeon and Levi and if if the sin was right here in our own flesh we'd be willing to get rid of it are you with me now that that we'd be willing to be zealous for the word of God oh I trust that God's called somebody I believe he has I believe he's called some preachers in our hour to be zealous of the word to be zealous for the message that we not just give in to whatever somebody says but they want to find out for themselves what God said listen they were both under the same blessing and it was and it was completely negative but God saw something in Levi would stand for the word and so he called Moses oh my I I want to ask you as they begin to play as we're being placed in the land who would you want to be identified with I want to be identified with Levi with the tribe of Levi though they both started the same let me have a Zeal for the word and for the right reasons not because somebody got at me on Facebook or somebody got at me on in the church and said I'm going to get them back I'm going to search the scriptures and find my retribution God hates that he hates that spirit so I've told people I don't want retribution somebody leaves here and I mean this honestly I'm not just saying it if people would see in my heart I mean this honestly if somebody leaves I don't want bad for them I want good for them I don't want retribution I want them to be so blessed in their lives because I want to see everybody make it and and if I must strike sin Let Me strike because it's because of the plague in the camp to get rid of the plague in the camp to let people live let me be zealous for the church zealous for the house of God zealous for my family come on men we got to be zealous for what God has given us to protect be zealous for the for the people God has given us say Lord I'll do what it takes I'll work what whatever you have me to do I'll do whatever it is you want me to do I want to be zealous for my children to make sure that they're raised in the house of God I want to be zealous for my family be radical be willing to be sold out completely be willing in the church to raise my hands be willing to shout if that's what you want be willing to cry if that's what you want let me be zealous not for Retribution not for personal gain not because somebody wronged me in some way but a Zeal to save people from the plague of sin Let Me Be zealous like that hope that's your desire tonight oh I want that maybe in the past you've had a temper or things have happened you know you've got the holy ghost that things are different now maybe you could let God use what he saw in you when he called you let him use it for his own Glory not to be a critic or to be bitter let him use that to better the church to keep you on edge if need be as brother Brandon said I didn't understand why I always always the target if he got a little bit off I get so nervous because God had called him for a particular hour in a time when the denominations would be have gotten off the word and God called him to to shoot straight and tell us the truth and I believe God called him for a reason let's have a Zeal for the word today I'm going to say what God said I'm going to believe the message I'm going to live for somebody else willing to forsake all others to cleave only to God to be United Like Glue with God and his message to stand for the message of there no matter what anybody says about it let me have a Zeal for it is that your desire tonight if it is with your head bowed and your eye closed would you raise your hands to him and just talk to him for a minute I know it's very different but I just couldn't get away from this and we didn't crat the service the surface of Levi and what he meant what his tribe meant but I don't want my temper to be a temper influenced by those swine demons I don't want to lose it I don't want to throw fits the devil makes you throw a fit every time it's the devil every time Lord I don't want to be that way no more I want it I want to be zealous for the house of God if I can raise my voice and and anger at my children surely I can raise my voice in Praise let me raise my voice instead of raising it at my wife or raising at my children or raising at somebody who I disagree with and have a temper fit with let me raise it in Praise say Lord You Are God let me raise it like the Levites be one that's called to to be passionate about the things of God let me do it with all my heart oh God Heavenly Father every one of us need more of you tonight I need more of you I realize Lord there's times when I got to stand I've got to Lord and I in my heart it's not my nature to just come and and come against people but Lord sometimes I have to stand for your word but oh God make me like a levite make me zealous oh God for your word make me not zealous for personal gain or to build a kingdom but Lord for your word may have a Zeal for the message of they power oh I pray you'd Quicken me Lord I pray you'd Quicken each and every one of our hearts may we have a Zeal to listen to the word may we have a Zeal to study it may we have a Zeal oh God again a burning passionate desire Lord rekindle it in us oh God till we can be like a levite that when any sin come up especially in our own hearts and minds and our own lives may we be quick to Smite it get rid of it get it out of us Lord because we want you to rule our whole being we want to be servants worthy Lord but to walk before you to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called I pray you grant it Lord oh if we're going to get angry help us to get angry at sin if we're if we're going to if we're going to get all excited about something let us do it for your word Lord let it be about your word oh God may we never make it a personal battle help us Lord help me Lord we don't want to do that we want to walk before you with a perfect heart with no inner motives or objectives other than just to serve you help us Lord help me Lord every one of us God from the pulpit to the back door we want to be more like
