[47:49] revealed from heaven against all

[47:54] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[47:58] because that which may be known of god
[48:00] is manifest

[48:04] so paul is telling us that all men are
[48:06] guilty in that way all of us had an
[48:08] opportunity in some way
[48:10] to see god and to recognize him as god
[48:13] he said for the invisible things
[48:15] of him from the creation of the world
[48:16] are clearly seen
[48:18] being understood by the things that are
[48:20] made even his eternal power in godhead
[48:23] so that they are without excuse
[48:26] because that when they knew god they
[48:28] glorified him not as god neither were
[48:30] thankful but become
[48:31] vain in their imaginations and their
[48:33] foolish heart was darkened
[48:35] professing themselves to be wise they
[48:37] became fools
[48:39] and changed the glory of the
[48:41] uncorruptable god
[48:43] into an image made like to corruptable
[48:45] man
[48:46] to birds and four-footed beasts and
[48:48] creeping things
[48:50] wherefore god also gave them up to
[48:52] uncleanness through the lust of their
[48:54] own heart
[48:55] to dishonor their own bodies between
[48:57] themselves
[48:58] and change the truth of god into a lie
[49:02] and worshiped and served the creature
[49:03] more than the creator who was blessed
[49:06] forever
[49:07] amen i pray that god would add his
[49:09] blessing to the word you may be seated
[49:12] this morning
[49:18] every false god is a manifestation of
[49:22] the imagination of the man
[49:24] who created him
[49:28] there's been many gods in history and i
[49:30] want to title this this morning
[49:32] and this afternoon idols of imagination
[49:38] just to give you a few examples of the
[49:40] many gods that have been
[49:42] in history some of the stranger ones
[49:44] there was a god
[49:46] the romans had was cardea who was the
[49:48] goddess of hinges
[49:51] literally the goddess of door hinges
[49:55] the vikings had a god called ceremony
[49:58] who was the viking god of eternal bacon
[50:02] and that's a god some of us could serve
[50:04] right there
[50:08] every the story goes that in their
[50:10] imagination they'd made up a story where
[50:13] this pig was a god and every night he
[50:16] would be slaughtered by the other gods
[50:17] and they'd eat him and he'd show up
[50:19] again the next morning
[50:20] he was the god of eternal bacon
[50:24] one that we actually is in our language
[50:28] today
[50:29] there was a roman god called terminus
[50:31] who was the god of boundaries
[50:33] and if you have an easement on your
[50:34] property on real property it
[50:36] always almost usually goes back to a
[50:38] terminus point
[50:40] and that's where that comes from he was
[50:41] the god of boundaries
[50:43] and he was always after people who would
[50:45] move mild post on the road
[50:48] and so they had a god for everything and
[50:51] the haitians
[50:52] had a god of intersections he always
[50:55] stood at the intersections of roads
[50:57] he was always creating trouble the
[51:00] greeks had a god
[51:01] that i think is probably still around
[51:03] today epimetheus was the greek god of
[51:06] excuses
[51:10] i think he's still out there somewhere
[51:15] and you know we can laugh at that
[51:17] because it's silly but come out of
[51:19] somebody's mind
[51:22] somebody had to dream this up right it
[51:24] was imaginations and the word
[51:26] imaginations comes from a
[51:28] latin word which comes from the word
[51:31] image
[51:32] it's image it's to create an image is
[51:34] what an imagination is
[51:37] it's to create an image in your mind
[51:38] that's something that's not true
[51:41] or may not be real and so your
[51:43] imagination creates you know you read a
[51:45] book and your imagination creates an
[51:47] image of what that
[51:48] book is but it's not exactly maybe what
[51:51] it is at all
[51:52] we have an imagination of it it's
[51:54] building onto the words and
[51:56] and that's what every idol is made out
[51:58] of
[51:59] imaginations whether it's a god of
[52:01] boundaries or of intersections or of
[52:03] excuses
[52:04] or or god today that we create in our
[52:06] own mind
[52:08] who we think to be the god of heaven
[52:11] jehovah
[52:12] we think to be the god of the message of
[52:14] the hour
[52:16] and i want to not be too i don't want to
[52:19] come down too hard today but because i'm
[52:21] not
[52:21] coming down on you i just want to preach
[52:23] the word i don't want to make it sound
[52:25] like i'm hammering you today but
[52:27] but we need to be careful what gods we
[52:30] create
[52:32] out of our imagination
[52:35] to make sure that they didn't leave
[52:37] anything out the greeks come up with a
[52:39] god
[52:40] it was called the unknown god
[52:43] he was the god of everything they forgot
[52:45] to mention
[52:47] it was a placeholder god it was used for
[52:49] everything they hadn't thought up yet
[52:52] and they started worshiping him after
[52:54] athens was hit by a plague and
[52:56] no matter how many animals they soldered
[52:58] because that was their answer to a
[52:59] plague
[53:00] jt if something bad happened they just
[53:01] soldered an animal i'm so glad we have a
[53:04] greater sacrifice than that
[53:06] aren't you but but they would solder an
[53:08] animal and so
[53:09] they soldered sheep and they got to
[53:10] where they slaughtered thousands of
[53:12] sheep and the plague was still there
[53:14] so they said there must be some god
[53:15] we're not satisfying
[53:17] because they would take the animal to
[53:19] the altar of the god and
[53:20] and so they took the sheep out in a
[53:22] field and they just watched them where
[53:24] they went the sheep scattered
[53:26] wherever the sheep went they they caught
[53:27] them there and they slaughtered them
[53:28] there
[53:29] and and then they built an altar to the
[53:31] unknown god
[53:33] because that's all they knew to do
[53:37] and they would hope that that act would
[53:38] appease whatever god that they'd never
[53:40] heard of whatever miscellaneous
[53:43] unspecific god
[53:46] and the romans did that as well and i've
[53:48] got a picture of that idol that they
[53:49] found or it was actually an altar
[53:52] that's an altar to the roman unknown god
[53:55] just in case they didn't want to offend
[53:57] any gods
[53:59] and paul in acts chapter 17 and verse 16
[54:02] encounters this in athens he encounters
[54:06] idolatry there and he said it said his
[54:09] spirit
[54:10] was stirred up in him and i can imagine
[54:12] paul was
[54:13] was quite a a man when he was preaching
[54:16] that
[54:16] you could tell when he was stirred up
[54:18] and and brother branham makes the
[54:20] statement that paul would be
[54:21] would be arrested today if he come and
[54:24] saw how the church operated
[54:26] the modern church and he said he would
[54:29] be arrested because
[54:31] of a people who who acted the way they
[54:34] did and
[54:35] and he would preach against that but he
[54:36] said now when he saw his spirit was
[54:38] stirred up in him when he saw the city
[54:40] wholly given to idolatry
[54:42] therefore disputed he in the synagogue
[54:44] with the jews with the devout persons
[54:46] and
[54:46] in the market daily with them that met
[54:49] him
[54:50] and so he was stirred up about it and
[54:53] and then he said then certain
[54:54] philosophers of the epicureans and
[54:56] the stoics encountered him and some said
[54:58] what will this babbler say
[55:01] because he was preaching you know he was
[55:03] he was stirred up maybe he was spitting
[55:05] a little bit and
[55:06] and he was stirred up about it and they
[55:08] said what will this babbler say
[55:10] other some he seemeth to be a setter
[55:12] forth of strange gods
[55:15] well they sure had some strange gods
[55:18] but you know they'd gotten so far away
[55:20] from god
[55:22] that they didn't recognize what the true
[55:24] god was when they saw it
[55:26] that they thought one having one god was
[55:30] strange
[55:31] worshiping one god was strange
[55:34] worshipping of god was perfect and just
[55:36] and mighty
[55:37] that that was strange and they
[55:38] worshipped these gods who were just like
[55:40] them
[55:40] we're living in that world of perversion
[55:42] today where if you worship the one true
[55:45] god you're seen as strange
[55:48] and so people are embarrassed to live
[55:50] like a christian but we
[55:51] ought to be embarrassed to live like the
[55:53] world lives
[55:55] right because they're it's strange gods
[55:57] that they're following after
[56:00] but here he said he seemeth to be a
[56:02] center forth of strange gods because he
[56:04] preached unto them jesus and the
[56:05] resurrection
[56:06] and they took him and brought him into
[56:08] erophagus
[56:09] saying may we know what this new
[56:11] doctrine whereof thou speakest
[56:13] is i'll bring in certain strange things
[56:16] to our ears we would know therefore what
[56:17] these things mean
[56:19] for all the athenians and strangers
[56:21] which were there
[56:22] spent their time in nothing else but
[56:24] either to tell or to hear some new thing
[56:27] there must be one of those around here
[56:29] somewhere
[56:32] and then paul stood in the midst of mars
[56:35] hill
[56:37] and he preached a sermon he said you men
[56:40] of athens i perceive it in all things
[56:42] you're too superstitious
[56:46] you got too many gods
[56:49] you you've let your imagination run away
[56:51] with you
[56:52] he said as i passed by and beheld your
[56:54] devotions i found an altar with this
[56:56] inscription
[56:56] to the unknown god he said whom
[56:59] therefore you ignorantly worship
[57:01] him declare i unto you amen
[57:05] he said you've been so superstitious you
[57:07] just covered all your bases that there's
[57:08] an
[57:09] unknown god let me tell you about that
[57:11] unknown god
[57:13] amen let me tell you about a god you
[57:15] don't know anything about
[57:16] or if we could just if a world could
[57:18] hear that today the world that we live
[57:20] in
[57:20] let me tell you about a god that's
[57:22] different than what the way you live
[57:24] he may be an unknown god it may seem
[57:26] strange to the world
[57:27] but it's the god of the bible amen
[57:31] amen and so the unknown god was
[57:34] ignorantly worshiped he said i'm going
[57:35] to tell you about him
[57:36] he said god that made the world and all
[57:38] things therein seeing that he is lord of
[57:40] heaven and earth
[57:41] well if not in temples made with hands
[57:45] neither is worshipped with men's hands
[57:48] now what's he saying he's not saying
[57:49] don't raise your hands he seems not
[57:50] worshipped with things
[57:52] made with men's hands he doesn't indwell
[57:56] something made with hands and you can go
[57:59] and listen to the sermon brother brandon
[58:00] preach christianity versus idolatry
[58:02] and he talks about how the idol and
[58:04] maybe we'll talk a little bit more about
[58:05] it later but the idol would
[58:07] would be there and he said one of the
[58:09] roman emperors got so
[58:11] enthused by it that he prostrated
[58:13] himself before the idol and he felt like
[58:14] the idol spoke back to it
[58:17] because he felt like his god had come
[58:19] and inhabited that
[58:20] that image but paul says god doesn't do
[58:22] that
[58:24] he doesn't inhabit images he doesn't
[58:26] inhabit pews
[58:27] he doesn't inhabit pianos or you hear me
[58:30] today
[58:31] brother remember said if an image spoke
[58:33] back then it was a devil that spoke
[58:38] but god don't inhabit images he inhabits
[58:40] people
[58:43] amen and brother madam called that being
[58:44] a living idol for god
[58:47] god comes down and indwells his people
[58:50] but now
[58:51] he dwelleth not in temples made with
[58:53] hands he's not worshiped with men's
[58:55] hands
[58:56] so he needed anything seeing he giveth
[58:59] to all
[59:00] life and breath and all things
[59:04] you remember even in the old testament
[59:05] he didn't dwell in the cherubim
[59:07] he dwelt among the cherubims
[59:11] you could have the literal ark of the
[59:13] covenant if the chicana wasn't fair it
[59:15] didn't do you any good
[59:17] he never veiled himself behind that what
[59:21] did he vail himself behind badger skins
[59:24] to show that he would veil himself
[59:25] behind human skin
[59:29] he always built himself behind a man
[59:32] now and he says
[59:35] he's not worshipped as though he needs
[59:36] anything he is made of one blood all
[59:38] nations of men why
[59:40] every one of us come from the ark
[59:44] all of us did we we can't claim one any
[59:48] better than the other all of us come
[59:49] from one of
[59:50] noah's three sons we're one blood all
[59:54] nations of men
[59:55] for to dwell in all the face of the
[59:57] earth and you know at that time all
[59:58] those people worshipped the one true god
[1:00:01] so at some point all nations have been
[1:00:05] exposed to the one true god and that's
[1:00:08] why paul can bring his indictment in
[1:00:10] romans chapter one
[1:00:11] and says they're all guilty because they
[1:00:13] should have known just by the evidence
[1:00:15] around them
[1:00:16] that god was scared but they fell from
[1:00:19] the true
[1:00:20] uh religion of god and preaching of one
[1:00:22] god and they've fallen into idolatry and
[1:00:24] we see the same thing
[1:00:26] in the church today now
[1:00:29] in the church nominal how that has
[1:00:31] fallen into idolatry now
[1:00:33] he has made a one blood all nations of
[1:00:35] men for to dwell in all the faces of the
[1:00:36] earth and has determined the times
[1:00:38] before appointed
[1:00:39] and the bounds of their habitation that
[1:00:41] they should seek the lord
[1:00:43] if happily they might feel after him and
[1:00:45] find him though he be not far from every
[1:00:48] one of us
[1:00:49] i like that they might feel after him
[1:00:51] like people that are blind he didn't
[1:00:53] not see him but they could feel after
[1:00:54] him he said but he's not far
[1:00:58] amen we're in him he says we live and
[1:01:01] move
[1:01:02] and have our being when paul says that
[1:01:05] he quotes one of their poets
[1:01:08] that that is actually the the wording of
[1:01:10] a greek poet
[1:01:12] he said as certain also of your own
[1:01:13] poets have said for we are also his
[1:01:15] offspring
[1:01:17] or as much then as we are the offspring
[1:01:19] of god we ought not to think that the
[1:01:21] godhead is like into gold or silver
[1:01:23] silver or stone this engraven by art
[1:01:26] and man's device or imagination
[1:01:31] and the times of this ignorance god
[1:01:33] winked at
[1:01:35] now commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:01:37] repent
[1:01:38] we don't worship him in imagination we
[1:01:41] worship him by revelation
[1:01:44] he reveals himself he doesn't let us
[1:01:47] just just grope around and find him in
[1:01:49] the dark anymore but he reveals himself
[1:01:51] what he is
[1:01:52] aren't you glad he's revealed himself to
[1:01:54] you
[1:01:56] and now commandeth all men everywhere to
[1:01:58] repent because he has appointed a day in
[1:02:00] which he will judge the world in
[1:02:01] righteousness
[1:02:02] by that man whom he hath ordained
[1:02:04] whereof he hath given assurance unto all
[1:02:06] men and that he raised him
[1:02:08] from the dead paul is standing there
[1:02:11] among
[1:02:11] all of the gods of of the greeks
[1:02:15] and the statues all around him and he
[1:02:17] says these are all gods of imagination
[1:02:20] god doesn't live in idols like this he
[1:02:24] doesn't dwell in stones
[1:02:26] and and wood and marble but he's a god
[1:02:29] that lives in a man
[1:02:31] amen the man christ jesus and he wants
[1:02:33] to live in you and i
[1:02:36] the true god is a god of revelation
[1:02:40] not a god of imagination
[1:02:44] in exodus 3 moses come to god and he
[1:02:46] said behold when i come to the children
[1:02:48] of israel shall say unto them the god of
[1:02:49] your fathers
[1:02:50] has sent me unto you and they shall say
[1:02:52] to me what is his name what shall i say
[1:02:54] unto them
[1:02:56] god said unto moses i am that i am
[1:03:00] i'm not what you imagined me to be i'm
[1:03:03] not what your preconceived notions of me
[1:03:05] are
[1:03:07] i'm not that's just the stories that
[1:03:08] you've heard
[1:03:10] but i am what i am
[1:03:14] i am that i am i am the present tense
[1:03:17] god who works
[1:03:20] in ways that only i can work
[1:03:23] and manifest myself god said i'm not
[1:03:27] going to leave it up to them to
[1:03:29] interpret who i am
[1:03:32] but when god come down and put his name
[1:03:35] jesus said i don't come in my own name i
[1:03:36] come in the father's name
[1:03:38] he put his name on that body of flesh it
[1:03:40] was god not not the
[1:03:41] pharisees figuring out who god was right
[1:03:45] not the not the jews not the greeks not
[1:03:47] the babylonians figuring out who god was
[1:03:49] but it was god himself
[1:03:51] who come down and says here's who i am
[1:03:55] right god come down in a supernatural
[1:03:57] way and that's the way he wants to
[1:03:59] reveal
[1:03:59] himself to us today he doesn't want us
[1:04:02] just to build a god of imagination
[1:04:05] where we assume that we know who he is
[1:04:08] and we assume that we know
[1:04:10] what he does but he wants to reveal
[1:04:12] himself for the bill to us
[1:04:13] individually until we can know aren't
[1:04:16] you glad we have a god we can know today
[1:04:18] he wants to reveal himself to each one
[1:04:20] of us individually
[1:04:22] until we can know this is my god
[1:04:25] amen this is the great i am this is and
[1:04:28] he tells him he said i'm the god of
[1:04:29] moses
[1:04:30] and i'm the rather the god of abraham
[1:04:32] isaac and jacob why
[1:04:33] because each one of them met god for
[1:04:35] himself
[1:04:37] hallelujah i am that i am i'm not going
[1:04:40] to let you define who i
[1:04:42] am but i am that i am
[1:04:45] and he says thus shalt thou say unto the
[1:04:47] children of israel i am has sent me unto
[1:04:49] you
[1:04:50] jesus identified himself the same way in
[1:04:53] john chapter 8 verse 58
[1:04:55] jesus said to them verily verily i say
[1:04:56] unto you before abraham was
[1:04:59] he didn't say i was he said i am
[1:05:04] amen before abraham was
[1:05:07] i am we used to sing a song and say oh
[1:05:10] who do you say i am
[1:05:12] whence do you say i came do you know the
[1:05:14] father and can you tell his name
[1:05:16] jesus and jesus is the fullness of the
[1:05:18] godhead don't you see
[1:05:20] amen he's the great i am if you believe
[1:05:23] that today
[1:05:25] i am i am because god
[1:05:28] was wanting was revealing himself
[1:05:31] he doesn't just leave that up to the
[1:05:33] theories of man and that's why it's so
[1:05:36] important that we stay with what god
[1:05:38] revealed
[1:05:39] what god said because when we build our
[1:05:42] own imaginations build up idols in our
[1:05:45] own imagination
[1:05:46] we end up worshiping something other
[1:05:48] than god
[1:05:50] and that something cannot cannot
[1:05:53] intervene for us because it's not real
[1:05:56] now luke chapter 10 verse 21
[1:06:00] look how god reveals himself you don't
[1:06:03] have to be the
[1:06:04] smartest man in the room and i'm glad
[1:06:06] for that
[1:06:08] you don't have to have the most money
[1:06:09] you don't have to have the best
[1:06:11] have had the best life in the past jesus
[1:06:13] come to many who
[1:06:14] had horrible lives you you
[1:06:18] may have been through a lot of things in
[1:06:19] your life but he said he didn't say he
[1:06:21] revealed himself to people like that
[1:06:23] but he said in that hour jesus rejoiced
[1:06:25] his spirit and said i thank the o father
[1:06:27] lord of heaven and earth that thou hast
[1:06:29] hid these things from the wise and
[1:06:31] prudent
[1:06:32] and hast revealed them unto babes amen
[1:06:35] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[1:06:37] sight
[1:06:38] all things are delivered to me and my
[1:06:40] father no man knoweth who the son is but
[1:06:42] the father
[1:06:43] and who the father is but the son and he
[1:06:46] to whom the son will reveal him
[1:06:48] nobody knows who he is unless he's
[1:06:52] revealed himself to you
[1:06:53] personally then he's just a god of
[1:06:55] imagination
[1:06:57] right and that's why jesus said you must
[1:06:59] be born again it's not optional
[1:07:01] you've got to be born again and that has
[1:07:04] to be the foundational doctrine of the
[1:07:05] church you must be born again
[1:07:07] because if it's not we just worship him
[1:07:09] by imagination
[1:07:10] whether we worship by a message system
[1:07:12] or a church of god or
[1:07:14] or methodist or something else it's just
[1:07:17] an imagination unless we've met him
[1:07:21] now and then jesus rejoicing in spirit i
[1:07:24] don't know what that looked like but
[1:07:27] he he was happy with something about it
[1:07:31] he was rejoicing because this is the way
[1:07:33] god had done it
[1:07:34] and he turned to his disciples and he
[1:07:36] said privately
[1:07:38] blessed are the eyes would see the
[1:07:40] things that you see
[1:07:43] i tell you that many prophets and kings
[1:07:45] have desired to see those things which
[1:07:47] you see
[1:07:48] and have not seen them and hear those
[1:07:51] things which you hear and have not heard
[1:07:52] them
[1:07:54] not because they studied the most
[1:07:58] right and i believe in study but that's
[1:08:00] not why god revealed himself
[1:08:04] he didn't reveal himself because they
[1:08:07] they had been the ones who'd been taught
[1:08:09] the best
[1:08:10] but he revealed himself to those who
[1:08:13] were babies
[1:08:15] who would learn who he knew would listen
[1:08:19] a church sometimes we just need to come
[1:08:21] to church and be babies
[1:08:23] man tell me one time an older minister
[1:08:25] in the gospel and he told me he said i
[1:08:27] don't come to your church
[1:08:28] to receive anything i just come to
[1:08:30] fellowship because i already know
[1:08:31] the message i said that's not the way to
[1:08:34] come to the house of god
[1:08:36] i don't care how old you are how long
[1:08:38] have you been how long you've been
[1:08:39] around
[1:08:40] we should come to the house of god like
[1:08:41] a baby in that way and say lord
[1:08:43] lord i want to learn today i want to
[1:08:46] learn i want to see how you will reveal
[1:08:47] yourself to me
[1:08:48] how are you when you reveal yourself to
[1:08:50] me as a healer will you reveal yourself
[1:08:52] to me as a savior
[1:08:53] when you reveal yourself to me in my
[1:08:54] trial will you unveil yourself to me in
[1:08:56] your word lord how will you reveal
[1:08:58] yourself to me today
[1:09:01] amen blessed are your eyes you see god
[1:09:03] in a way that the theologian doesn't see
[1:09:05] him you see god in a way that even a
[1:09:07] great preacher somewhere doesn't seem
[1:09:09] but you see him because he's revealed
[1:09:11] himself to you
[1:09:12] you were a baby who could learn you were
[1:09:15] elected of god and there's something
[1:09:16] inside of you you want to hear from god
[1:09:19] amen you want to understand
[1:09:22] the things of god blessed are your eyes
[1:09:26] see we know him by revelation
[1:09:28] in revelation 3 7 he speaks to the angel
[1:09:31] of the church in philadelphia he said
[1:09:32] these things saith he that is holy
[1:09:34] he that is true he that hath the key of
[1:09:36] david he that openeth and no man
[1:09:39] sheddeth and sheddeth and no man openeth
[1:09:41] brother branham says that's the open
[1:09:43] door he said i've set the open door i
[1:09:44] have the keys i'm the only one that can
[1:09:46] open it
[1:09:46] i'm the only one that can reveal it i
[1:09:49] have the keys
[1:09:50] he said is that right there's no man can
[1:09:52] come to me except my father draws him
[1:09:54] all the father has given me will come to
[1:09:56] me
[1:09:57] no man can be saved only through jesus
[1:10:00] christ
[1:10:02] we still believe that today not through
[1:10:04] any church
[1:10:05] any organization any bishop pope
[1:10:09] just through jesus christ he has the key
[1:10:12] he's the only one
[1:10:13] he said that the keys of what david the
[1:10:16] future coming millennium
[1:10:17] where he'll sit on the throne of david i
[1:10:19] have the keys of david i'll open this
[1:10:21] door and nobody can shut it
[1:10:22] nobody can open it but me and nobody can
[1:10:25] shut it to me
[1:10:27] i love that i you know
[1:10:30] you can't keep me out of god's kingdom
[1:10:35] right you can't keep me out of the
[1:10:36] millennium
[1:10:38] why he said i have the keys you can
[1:10:42] apply that you can tell me that today
[1:10:44] i can't keep you out amen
[1:10:48] i can't do it no one else can do it only
[1:10:51] christ
[1:10:51] himself has the key amen
[1:10:55] he said how can it be how can any man
[1:10:57] know he is the christ until he's
[1:10:59] revealed himself to him
[1:11:00] see he reveals himself he has the key
[1:11:03] he can open the door or leave it alone
[1:11:07] right he can do that it it's up to him
[1:11:09] to do that
[1:11:10] you can't even do that for your children
[1:11:12] you understand he has the key
[1:11:14] he can open it he can leave it alone god
[1:11:17] has that key
[1:11:18] see he said i have the key to the door i
[1:11:21] am the door i am the way
[1:11:22] i am the truth i am the light he has the
[1:11:25] key
[1:11:26] he's the only one he said i'm the alpha
[1:11:27] and the omega i am the first and the
[1:11:29] last
[1:11:30] i am the father i'm the son i am the
[1:11:32] holy ghost i
[1:11:33] am he said not i was or
[1:11:36] will be see god if i was for god if i
[1:11:39] will be it's an idol of imagination
[1:11:42] but he said i am that i am
[1:11:46] hallelujah he said that said the whole
[1:11:48] thing
[1:11:50] i am not what i was or will be i am he
[1:11:54] said that means
[1:11:55] living presence for eternity
[1:11:58] amen see i am always lost
[1:12:02] always will be i am now as i always was
[1:12:05] and always will be see he said he's just
[1:12:07] i am but she said brother ben you don't
[1:12:08] understand what's happened you don't
[1:12:10] understand what's going on
[1:12:11] he's still the great i am you don't
[1:12:14] understand how old i am he's still the
[1:12:16] great i am
[1:12:17] you don't understand my condition he's
[1:12:19] still the great i am
[1:12:21] there's a desire in your heart to do
[1:12:23] something and maybe there's a desire in
[1:12:25] your heart and you say i want to
[1:12:26] serve god in this way i want to live for
[1:12:28] god in this way but you don't see a way
[1:12:29] for it to happen
[1:12:30] just step out in faith he's the great i
[1:12:32] am
[1:12:33] he's not a god of yesterday he's not a
[1:12:35] god of tomorrow's god of today
[1:12:38] tomorrow he'll be god then too yesterday
[1:12:41] he was god then too but he's god today
[1:12:45] amen he said i am always was
[1:12:48] always will be and i am now as i always
[1:12:51] was and always will be
[1:12:54] amen oh don't you love him today
[1:12:58] amen doesn't it make your god real to
[1:13:00] you i am
[1:13:01] i'm not an idol of imagination i am the
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:04] who can heal you today i am the god who
[1:13:07] can save you today
[1:13:08] i am the god who can change you from
[1:13:10] what you heard away you
[1:13:11] i want you to be i am the god that can
[1:13:13] take the situation that's messed up and
[1:13:15] make it right
[1:13:17] i am the god that can completely
[1:13:19] supernaturally change
[1:13:20] everything about you i am hallelujah
[1:13:25] amen i'm glad you didn't leave it up to
[1:13:27] us pastors he didn't leave it up to any
[1:13:28] other man but he said i
[1:13:30] am amen
[1:13:34] and if he is that i am then the bible
[1:13:36] the word of god reveals to us who he is
[1:13:40] amen and we know that all the secrets of
[1:13:43] who god is
[1:13:44] how did he choose to reveal that in his
[1:13:46] word
[1:13:48] right in the word they're all in the
[1:13:51] bible
[1:13:52] now at the end time those secrets have
[1:13:54] been revealed
[1:13:56] amen a revelation an unveiling not a
[1:13:58] creation of something
[1:14:00] new an idol of imagination but an
[1:14:02] unveiling of what is already there
[1:14:04] the word revelation is to pull off the
[1:14:07] pull the
[1:14:08] uh the covering off of the sculpture to
[1:14:11] pull it off and
[1:14:12] show the world what it is amen and this
[1:14:15] day we have a revelation at the end time
[1:14:18] we don't have to use imaginations
[1:14:22] we don't have to use imaginations
[1:14:24] because the message of the hour come to
[1:14:26] tell us
[1:14:27] he still is the i am we don't have to
[1:14:30] use imaginations about what he is or who
[1:14:32] he is
[1:14:32] he says i am the i am and then he
[1:14:35] reveals himself in his word when he
[1:14:37] reveals himself in his word
[1:14:38] then at the end time he said seal up
[1:14:40] there's certain things that were to be
[1:14:41] sealed up to the end time but now the
[1:14:43] mysteries have been revealed
[1:14:46] right we don't have to use imaginations
[1:14:49] because the bible says in the days of
[1:14:51] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:14:54] the mystery would be finished now
[1:14:58] he said well we don't know some things
[1:15:00] now look
[1:15:02] he was revealing himself he's revealing
[1:15:06] himself
[1:15:08] and at the end time we know the things
[1:15:11] that are needed at the end time which is
[1:15:14] the whole body of christ
[1:15:15] the whole book right the whole book is
[1:15:18] open
[1:15:19] now there is something that's not
[1:15:20] written in the book and brother random
[1:15:22] calls that how and why he would come or
[1:15:23] how and when he would come
[1:15:26] that's what brother brown talks about
[1:15:27] you can go and compare the seventh seal
[1:15:29] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:15:30] revealed
[1:15:31] i don't have time to get into that this
[1:15:32] morning but everything except that has
[1:15:35] been revealed
[1:15:39] and it just makes it so plain because if
[1:15:41] you take that seven still message
[1:15:42] and i challenge you to do that if you
[1:15:44] have time go and listen to the seventh
[1:15:46] seal and then listen to christ is the
[1:15:47] mystery of god revealed
[1:15:49] now that'll take you about a week but if
[1:15:51] you listen to one sermon and then
[1:15:53] the other right after it you'll find out
[1:15:55] that brother branham answers those
[1:15:57] questions in crisis the mystery of god
[1:15:59] revealed
[1:15:59] that threefold purpose that god had he
[1:16:01] talked about there was a threefold
[1:16:02] purpose to the sixth seal threefold
[1:16:04] purpose
[1:16:04] to the seventh steel and then brother
[1:16:06] brown talks about that in christ is the
[1:16:07] mystery of god revealed
[1:16:09] and preaches in some ways his seventh
[1:16:11] seal sermon but there's one thing we
[1:16:12] still didn't know
[1:16:13] we knew we were at the end time and
[1:16:15] that's the third poll we don't know what
[1:16:16] hour he's coming in
[1:16:19] right and that's what's silent what's
[1:16:21] still hidden
[1:16:22] but everything else has been revealed
[1:16:24] he's now in plain view
[1:16:27] you don't have to wait for him to be in
[1:16:29] plain view he is now
[1:16:31] the message of the hour shining the
[1:16:33] light on the scripture that has always
[1:16:34] been there
[1:16:36] but god in a supernatural manifestation
[1:16:39] see god come to moses in a supernatural
[1:16:41] manifestation a pillar of fire and says
[1:16:43] i am that i am
[1:16:45] and god come in this age in a
[1:16:46] supernatural manifestation
[1:16:48] a pillar of fire and says i am what i
[1:16:50] have
[1:16:52] hallelujah he chooses to reveal himself
[1:16:55] not as an unknown god
[1:16:57] but that's the great i am amen and
[1:17:01] jesus chose to reveal himself in christ
[1:17:03] and now he reveals himself in his word
[1:17:07] now i say in isaiah chapter 44. just go
[1:17:10] there with me for a moment this morning
[1:17:12] and i hope it don't bore you
[1:17:14] but isaiah chapter 44 and verse 9
[1:17:18] we'll read several verses it gives us
[1:17:19] the process
[1:17:21] by which idols were made isaiah 44
[1:17:25] 9 and it speaks to us
[1:17:28] of what a folly
[1:17:32] that it is to have an idol
[1:17:36] now he says they that make a graven
[1:17:38] image are all of them vanity
[1:17:41] the delectable things shall not profit
[1:17:44] they are their own witnesses
[1:17:47] in other words they themselves the idol
[1:17:51] itself should tell you they don't see
[1:17:54] they don't know that they may be ashamed
[1:17:57] just a block of wood right that's all it
[1:18:00] is it's an idol
[1:18:02] but it had to come from somewhere where
[1:18:05] does the block of wood come from
[1:18:08] who has formed a god or molten a graven
[1:18:12] image that is profitable for nothing
[1:18:15] behold all his fellows shall be ashamed
[1:18:18] and the workmen they are of men
[1:18:20] he said let them all be gathered
[1:18:21] together let them stand up
[1:18:23] yet they shall fear and they shall be
[1:18:25] ashamed together
[1:18:26] and and isaiah's just pointing out the
[1:18:28] very thing here you got a god that
[1:18:30] you're bowing in front of
[1:18:33] and and here's the guys that made it
[1:18:37] they made him down at the god shop
[1:18:41] right you realize you could go into a
[1:18:43] denominational world today and kind of
[1:18:45] do the same thing
[1:18:47] you're bowing before creeds that were
[1:18:49] created you could point back to nicaea
[1:18:51] this is when they were made up
[1:18:55] you're going down you're bowing in front
[1:18:57] of things and you can do that even with
[1:18:58] the things of the world that we have
[1:19:00] today
[1:19:01] and people bow down to the ultra
[1:19:02] secularism they bow down to this idea of
[1:19:05] worldliness that
[1:19:06] it's got to be this way a woman has to
[1:19:08] do these certain things and a man has to
[1:19:09] do these things
[1:19:10] and you can show them where that come in
[1:19:12] it was invented
[1:19:14] huh it's not it's not something you have
[1:19:16] to fear
[1:19:17] you say well i'll be different if i
[1:19:19] dress right i'll be different from
[1:19:20] everybody else
[1:19:21] listen you'll be sane in your right mind
[1:19:26] just because everybody else does it
[1:19:27] because listen the majority of this
[1:19:29] world has always been idolaters
[1:19:32] you go back in history the most of the
[1:19:35] people have always been idolaters it
[1:19:36] doesn't make you strange to be a
[1:19:38] christian
[1:19:38] it makes you sane
[1:19:44] because these are all just idols of
[1:19:45] imagination he said
[1:19:47] these are the guys that made the idol
[1:19:49] the smith with the tongs both worketh in
[1:19:51] the coals
[1:19:53] and fashion it with hammers and worketh
[1:19:55] it with the strength of his arm
[1:19:57] he made it
[1:20:01] now examine what you believe
[1:20:05] if you made it
[1:20:08] i told somebody one time you couldn't
[1:20:10] believe that if you hadn't invented it
[1:20:14] you'd sure never get it out of the
[1:20:16] message
[1:20:19] it's if you've got a doctrine that you
[1:20:20] believe if you've got something you hold
[1:20:22] to
[1:20:23] examine it who made it
[1:20:27] was it a man was it god
[1:20:30] he said how will i know is it in the
[1:20:31] word
[1:20:33] right if it doesn't come from the word
[1:20:34] god didn't make it
[1:20:37] right now he he did it with the strength
[1:20:40] of his arms
[1:20:41] he said yeah he is hungry and his
[1:20:43] strength faileth he drinketh no water
[1:20:45] and his faint
[1:20:46] trying to get this idol made puts great
[1:20:49] effort into it
[1:20:51] the carpenter stretches out his rule he
[1:20:53] marks it with a line he
[1:20:54] fits it with planes markets it out with
[1:20:57] a compass
[1:20:58] makes it after the figure of a man
[1:21:00] according to the beauty of a man
[1:21:03] that it may remain in the house so he
[1:21:05] does kind of like what the mark does and
[1:21:07] builds things like this pulpit
[1:21:09] but see we'd never think to worship it
[1:21:11] we shouldn't worship the pulpit
[1:21:15] if we do there's a problem or the man in
[1:21:17] the pulpit
[1:21:19] right but but the pulpit you know mark
[1:21:22] made that and
[1:21:23] and he made it nice and it's beautiful
[1:21:25] but he wasn't making it for a god
[1:21:28] i meant it to be used by a man but here
[1:21:31] they were making something like this
[1:21:32] that would be nice and then bowing down
[1:21:34] in front of us and you're my god
[1:21:38] just come out of imagination he healeth
[1:21:42] him down cedars take it to cyprus and
[1:21:44] the oak
[1:21:45] which he strengtheneth for himself among
[1:21:46] the trees of the forest notice how
[1:21:48] manmade it is
[1:21:49] he even planted the tree that he got the
[1:21:51] wood from
[1:21:54] right so he he did it all he plants a
[1:21:57] certain kind of tree
[1:21:58] the rain nourishes it he said then shall
[1:22:00] it be for a man to burn so he takes part
[1:22:02] of the tree and burns it
[1:22:04] he'll take care of and warm himself he
[1:22:07] kindleth it and break his bread
[1:22:09] he maketh a god and worshipeth it
[1:22:13] so he takes and isaiah is illustrating
[1:22:15] the absurdity of it
[1:22:17] that with that same imagination that he
[1:22:20] used to create an idol
[1:22:22] he takes some of it and burns it huh
[1:22:25] he takes some of it and bakes bread with
[1:22:27] it
[1:22:31] you know we hold up our imaginations
[1:22:33] what we think
[1:22:34] way too much see that same mind that
[1:22:38] created that doctrine
[1:22:39] that same mind that created that feeling
[1:22:41] that nobody loves you nobody cares about
[1:22:43] you
[1:22:43] that complex that you have the same mind
[1:22:45] that created that also created a lot of
[1:22:47] things that you probably don't even want
[1:22:48] to tell nobody
[1:22:51] huh and that's true of all of us
[1:22:56] that's what create your dreams even at
[1:22:57] night and some of the things you
[1:22:59] you think about you wouldn't want none
[1:23:00] of us would want all of our thoughts put
[1:23:02] on these screens
[1:23:05] that same mind you do you used to do
[1:23:07] that then you create an imaginary god
[1:23:10] or an imaginary version of the word that
[1:23:13] teaches itself and and and props itself
[1:23:16] up by
[1:23:17] quotes and scriptures and other things
[1:23:19] but it's all made up
[1:23:22] god help us to stay with the word today
[1:23:28] listen he says he burneth part of it in
[1:23:30] the fire
[1:23:31] heart are there to eat his flesh he
[1:23:32] roasted roast
[1:23:36] he says and is satisfied yeah he warmeth
[1:23:38] himself and saith aha i am warm i have
[1:23:40] seen the fire.
[1:23:42] and the residue thereof he maketh the
[1:23:44] god even his graven image
[1:23:46] he falleth down unto it and worshipeth
[1:23:48] it and prayeth unto it
[1:23:49] and saith deliver me for thou art my god
[1:23:53] and he can't deliver him
[1:23:56] i was watching about the
[1:23:59] egyptian gods the other day and they
[1:24:01] made a god who was a woman
[1:24:03] who was a god of war they were so scared
[1:24:06] of this god
[1:24:08] that the the theory the theology of this
[1:24:11] god that they had was that they would
[1:24:12] keep her drunk
[1:24:14] all the time so they constantly had
[1:24:17] festivals where they would keep her
[1:24:18] drunk and
[1:24:20] they would uh constantly keep her drunk
[1:24:22] because they didn't want her to wake up
[1:24:23] and get mad
[1:24:25] right so when it come time for a war and
[1:24:28] and people were coming
[1:24:29] and the enemy was coming then they quit
[1:24:31] giving her wine
[1:24:32] and they thought she'd wake up and get
[1:24:34] mad and just destroy everything around
[1:24:35] her
[1:24:37] and and that would be uh that would be
[1:24:39] who she was why it was such an
[1:24:40] imagination
[1:24:41] because that's what that's the way they
[1:24:43] were so they thought god was like that
[1:24:46] too
[1:24:47] this particular god look deliver me
[1:24:51] they say the gods don't deliver them
[1:24:55] because they're not gods at all paul
[1:24:57] tells us that they're not gods at all
[1:24:59] but branham says that and christianity
[1:25:00] versus idolatry said they're nothing
[1:25:03] right but he said if you prostrate
[1:25:05] yourself before it
[1:25:07] a devil will speak to you
[1:25:10] right and that's where you have to be
[1:25:12] careful because you're idle the image
[1:25:14] that you've made is nothing
[1:25:16] but if you're not careful you'll give it
[1:25:18] such devotion that the devil will get in
[1:25:20] and
[1:25:20] speak to you
[1:25:24] listen he said they have not known nor
[1:25:27] understood
[1:25:28] they can't hear your cries for
[1:25:30] deliverance for he has shut their eyes
[1:25:32] that they cannot see in their hearts
[1:25:34] that they cannot understand
[1:25:36] none considereth it in his heart neither
[1:25:38] is their knowledge nor understanding to
[1:25:40] say
[1:25:41] look i burn part of it in the fire i
[1:25:43] bake bread upon the coaster of
[1:25:45] i've roasted flesh and eaten it shall i
[1:25:47] make the residue thereof an abomination
[1:25:52] shall i fall down to the stalk of a tree
[1:25:56] verse 20 he feedeth on ashes a deceived
[1:25:59] heart
[1:26:00] turned him aside what did it a deceived
[1:26:03] heart
[1:26:04] he made it out of his own imagination
[1:26:07] and he cannot deliver his soul
[1:26:09] nor sayest there not a lie in my right
[1:26:13] hand
[1:26:14] he can't ever acknowledge it because
[1:26:16] he's gone too far down the path
[1:26:18] of worship of the idol
[1:26:22] god help us today because almost
[1:26:25] anything can become an idol
[1:26:28] and that's where we have to be because
[1:26:29] i'm not preaching to another church
[1:26:31] i'm preaching to us i preach every one
[1:26:34] of my sermons to me
[1:26:37] you say brother ben who are you
[1:26:38] preaching at i'm preaching at me
[1:26:40] and then i'm preaching at you that are
[1:26:42] sitting here sure
[1:26:45] i'm preaching to you i'm preaching at me
[1:26:48] that's the only people i can preach
[1:26:49] that's all i'm responsible for
[1:26:51] right if somebody else hears it that's
[1:26:53] up to them but i'm preaching to us
[1:26:55] so whatever idol whatever imagination
[1:26:58] whatever idol that would create
[1:27:00] here's a lie in his right hand but he
[1:27:02] can't get rid of it because it would
[1:27:03] he's too embarrassed
[1:27:06] to say i was completely wrong
[1:27:10] see the man takes something that god
[1:27:12] made
[1:27:13] i want you to watch this and refashions
[1:27:16] it according to his own
[1:27:18] imagination and then enslaves himself
[1:27:22] to what he made
[1:27:25] right some of them would make a god make
[1:27:27] it idol
[1:27:28] excuse me my allergies are acting up
[1:27:30] today but he would take
[1:27:32] an idol and build it and set it up
[1:27:36] in a temple he built the idol he built
[1:27:38] the temple he invented the god
[1:27:41] right put it in the temple and then come
[1:27:45] under such a persuasion of this god
[1:27:47] that he would sacrifice his own children
[1:27:48] to it
[1:27:52] people still do that today
[1:27:56] they create a doctrine or an idea that
[1:27:59] they know
[1:28:01] they created they know they did but they
[1:28:04] can't acknowledge there's a lie in my
[1:28:05] right hand
[1:28:07] so they sacrificed their own children to
[1:28:10] a god that they created
[1:28:12] an idea that is different from the word
[1:28:18] god help us today
[1:28:23] look what the children of israel did in
[1:28:24] exodus 32
[1:28:26] when the people saw that moses delayed
[1:28:28] to come down out of the mount the people
[1:28:29] gathered themselves together unto aaron
[1:28:31] and said unto him up make us gods
[1:28:34] what a strange request
[1:28:37] they got tired of waiting when did
[1:28:40] abraham get in trouble he got tired of
[1:28:42] waiting
[1:28:43] and his wife convinced him to go in and
[1:28:45] created an ishmael
[1:28:48] that's what happens now all the time
[1:28:50] people get tired of waiting on the
[1:28:51] rapture
[1:28:52] they get tired of waiting on something
[1:28:54] real and so
[1:28:56] they create a wild man a doctrine out of
[1:28:58] it and when the people saw moses was
[1:29:00] delayed the people gathered themselves
[1:29:02] to aaron and said up make us gods which
[1:29:03] will go before us
[1:29:05] for as for this moses the man that
[1:29:06] brought us up out of the land of egypt
[1:29:08] we want not what has become of him
[1:29:10] we don't know what become of him and
[1:29:12] aaron said unto them break off the
[1:29:13] golden earrings
[1:29:14] which are in the ears of your wives of
[1:29:16] your sons and of your daughters bring
[1:29:17] them unto me
[1:29:18] and it's thought that aaron is kind of
[1:29:21] aaron's role in all this is strange
[1:29:24] because he doesn't get judged with them
[1:29:26] he obviously doesn't believe like them
[1:29:28] but he goes along with them
[1:29:31] but he he tells them break off all the
[1:29:33] golden earrings and most scholars will
[1:29:35] tell you that that's because
[1:29:36] he thought they wouldn't do it but they
[1:29:39] wanted a god
[1:29:41] and they were willing to give up
[1:29:42] something to get it
[1:29:44] so they break off the golden earrings
[1:29:45] which are in their ears and brought them
[1:29:46] to aaron
[1:29:47] these were the spoils of egypt the
[1:29:49] material things they were blessed with
[1:29:51] as a result
[1:29:52] listen they only had remember these are
[1:29:55] the things they come out of egypt with
[1:29:56] they only they wouldn't have had these
[1:29:58] things as slaves
[1:29:59] but they had them because of as a result
[1:30:02] of the supernatural message that they
[1:30:03] followed
[1:30:05] and they used those things which they
[1:30:07] had as a result of a supernatural
[1:30:09] message
[1:30:09] and created an idol with it
[1:30:14] and verse 4 says he received them at
[1:30:16] their hand
[1:30:17] and fashioned it with a graving tool
[1:30:20] after he had made it to molten calf and
[1:30:22] they said these be thy god so israel
[1:30:25] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:30:26] egypt
[1:30:29] aaron later when he's making his excuse
[1:30:31] to moses he says
[1:30:32] he says well i cast it into the fire and
[1:30:34] a calf came out
[1:30:38] it just happened to come out exactly
[1:30:40] like the one they saw in egypt
[1:30:44] isn't it funny that people's pet
[1:30:46] doctrines resemble
[1:30:48] the ones that they had in
[1:30:49] denominationalism
[1:30:53] and you take revelations of convenience
[1:30:55] where somebody's going through something
[1:30:56] and i hate it
[1:30:56] somebody goes through a problem maybe in
[1:30:58] their marriage or in some other way and
[1:31:00] it becomes a revelation of convenience
[1:31:02] all of a sudden they're enlightened
[1:31:04] as to what what the word says about this
[1:31:06] certain subject you look at it and it
[1:31:08] says it's kind of strange that it
[1:31:09] resembles what's
[1:31:10] going on in your life
[1:31:14] why because it's just an imaginary thing
[1:31:16] it doesn't stay with the word
[1:31:19] verse 5 when aaron saw it he built an
[1:31:21] altar before it
[1:31:22] and aaron made a proclamation notice
[1:31:24] what he says tomorrow is the feast to
[1:31:26] the lord
[1:31:30] tomorrow we're gonna have church like we
[1:31:31] always do
[1:31:34] this is a feast to the lord that word
[1:31:36] lord is it's jehovah that that's that's
[1:31:38] the god of israel
[1:31:40] tomorrow is the feast of the lord and
[1:31:41] tomorrow we're gonna bring our golden
[1:31:43] calf and worship the lord with it
[1:31:47] that's what he said he rose up early on
[1:31:50] tomorrow and offered burnt offerings and
[1:31:52] brought peace offerings
[1:31:53] those are religious acts that'd be like
[1:31:56] saying you come in you paid your tithes
[1:31:57] and you did your
[1:31:58] offering paid your offering you sang in
[1:32:01] the song service
[1:32:02] that's what they were doing they offered
[1:32:03] their burnt offerings they brought peace
[1:32:05] offerings
[1:32:05] that morning in the camp everything
[1:32:07] looked just like it always looked
[1:32:09] right everything looked just like it
[1:32:11] always looked and everything
[1:32:13] just seemed like it was always just the
[1:32:14] same as it always was
[1:32:16] and the people sat down to eat and to
[1:32:18] drink and rose up to play
[1:32:21] they were enjoying it
[1:32:24] after all moses wasn't there to watch
[1:32:26] them
[1:32:27] wasn't there to tell them no isn't it
[1:32:30] funny idolatry always ends up with
[1:32:32] worldliness
[1:32:34] and the reason for that is because
[1:32:36] idolatry assimilates with whatever the
[1:32:37] culture is right you find this in
[1:32:40] history
[1:32:41] the children of israel never denied
[1:32:42] jehovah they just added idols with him
[1:32:46] right they never did away with the
[1:32:47] worship of jehovah and israel never
[1:32:49] outlawed it what did they do they added
[1:32:51] bail to it
[1:32:52] they added a golden calf to it they even
[1:32:54] at one time added the brass serpent to
[1:32:56] it
[1:32:59] they built idols and and added those in
[1:33:02] because that was the culture that they
[1:33:04] lived in the world did it all the big
[1:33:06] tribes did it
[1:33:07] all the big kingdoms of the world did it
[1:33:09] can you imagine what being israel was
[1:33:10] like in that day
[1:33:11] israel was a small little group they
[1:33:13] were just a tribe and
[1:33:15] and to them they looked around on every
[1:33:17] corner
[1:33:18] were the smiths you know and they
[1:33:20] painted their steps red they
[1:33:22] were idolaters the assyrians were
[1:33:24] idolaters the babylonians were idolaters
[1:33:26] the ethiopians were all around on the
[1:33:28] egyptians
[1:33:29] that great culture that was there in
[1:33:30] that day all around them was idolatry
[1:33:33] and so they looked around and said well
[1:33:34] everybody else is doing it
[1:33:37] and idolatry when people's heart gets
[1:33:39] away from god
[1:33:41] idolatry leads them to assimilate with
[1:33:43] the world
[1:33:45] and the people sit down to eat and drink
[1:33:46] and they rose up to play just like they
[1:33:48] do it did
[1:33:49] with their idolatry
[1:33:53] just like the people who worshipped
[1:33:54] idols did
[1:33:56] they brought egyptian methods of worship
[1:33:58] into
[1:33:59] the worship of jehovah but jehovah
[1:34:02] doesn't let us choose how to worship
[1:34:04] him he chooses the place he chooses the
[1:34:08] time
[1:34:08] he chooses the person he does
[1:34:13] he chose you didn't he and he chooses
[1:34:16] the method
[1:34:19] you see the catholics never denied jesus
[1:34:21] christ being god they just added other
[1:34:23] gods
[1:34:25] the babylonians did the same thing
[1:34:28] look daniel 2 46
[1:34:32] it feels late but it's not we changed to
[1:34:34] the 10 30 service and so it's noon not
[1:34:36] feeling nervous
[1:34:37] but i really haven't been preaching that
[1:34:39] long daniel 2 46 we're doing good that's
[1:34:41] what i'm saying
[1:34:44] you're going to get some of that potluck
[1:34:48] i always hate it when i have to preach
[1:34:49] sunday night i tried to get alan and
[1:34:50] stewart to preach
[1:34:52] because i wanted to eat this afternoon
[1:34:53] but we'll eat a little bit anyway
[1:34:59] daniel 2 46 the king nebuchadnezzar fell
[1:35:01] upon his face
[1:35:03] and worshiped daniel now why would he do
[1:35:05] that because daniel
[1:35:06] just showed him what his dream meant
[1:35:09] right daniel did something none of his
[1:35:11] philosophers could do
[1:35:14] he commanded that they should offer an
[1:35:15] oblation and sweet odors unto him
[1:35:18] and the king answered unto daniel and
[1:35:19] said of a truth it is that your god is a
[1:35:22] god of gods and a lord of kings
[1:35:24] and a revealer of secrets seeing thou
[1:35:26] could
[1:35:27] reveal this secret he recognized the
[1:35:28] gift in daniel's life
[1:35:32] verse 48 then the king made daniel a
[1:35:33] great man gave him many great gifts
[1:35:36] ruler over the whole province of babylon
[1:35:38] chief of the governors over all the wise
[1:35:40] men of babylon
[1:35:42] and daniel requested of the king and he
[1:35:44] said shadrach meshach and abednego over
[1:35:45] the affairs
[1:35:46] in the province of babylon but daniel
[1:35:48] sat in the gate of the king listen
[1:35:50] i want you to hear this just because a
[1:35:52] political leader
[1:35:54] likes christianity or would even like
[1:35:58] the message
[1:35:59] don't mean that that's what they are
[1:36:03] and i'd rather have one that liked it
[1:36:04] than one that didn't
[1:36:07] it's a whole lot easier to to have one
[1:36:10] that likes it than one that don't but be
[1:36:11] wary of that too
[1:36:13] because any time a political leader ever
[1:36:16] identified closely with christianity
[1:36:20] they tried to co-opt it and turn it into
[1:36:23] something
[1:36:24] that's pagan right and this happens
[1:36:27] it corresponds in the history to
[1:36:29] constantine in in the
[1:36:31] uh in new testament times and in the
[1:36:33] time of the nigerian council
[1:36:35] in that roman system as that old rome
[1:36:37] was dying and he reinvigorated it with
[1:36:39] the christian principles
[1:36:41] and then added paganism to it but
[1:36:44] look at the next verse now daniel 2 49
[1:36:47] the next verse is daniel 3 1.
[1:36:50] nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[1:36:52] gold
[1:36:53] whose height was three score cubits and
[1:36:55] the breadth throws six cubits
[1:36:56] and he set it up in the plain of dura in
[1:36:58] the province of babylon
[1:37:02] look what he does brother brown says it
[1:37:03] this way he said i want you to notice as
[1:37:05] soon as the king
[1:37:06] saw this vision and he made it
[1:37:09] he forced every person in his kingdom in
[1:37:12] his domain
[1:37:13] to worship this image as soon as he saw
[1:37:16] it he forced every person in his kingdom
[1:37:18] to worship this image
[1:37:19] this is something by the way you can
[1:37:20] find all through the message brother
[1:37:22] branham
[1:37:23] identifies the same thing it's not just
[1:37:24] in one spot
[1:37:26] he said it's believed by scholars he
[1:37:28] said in which i do believe that a
[1:37:29] spirit-filled person would see it
[1:37:31] that he worshipped daniel is what he did
[1:37:34] he said he made an image to daniel and
[1:37:35] he called it belt to shazzar
[1:37:38] he called daniel about the shazar which
[1:37:39] is the name of his god
[1:37:41] he made an image and forced every person
[1:37:43] to worship that image
[1:37:46] he forced every person notices another
[1:37:49] another uh characteristic of idolatry
[1:37:53] is that it's a forced religion
[1:37:57] a forced religion god don't do that
[1:38:04] but now he forced everyone to in his
[1:38:07] kingdom to worship this image he made an
[1:38:09] image
[1:38:09] now he said i want you to notice that
[1:38:12] the beginning of the gentiles when god
[1:38:14] dealt with them they got haughty in
[1:38:15] their heart
[1:38:17] oh my and forced every man to worship
[1:38:19] the image of a holy man
[1:38:21] the gentile age was issued in with that
[1:38:23] he says it will go out in the same way
[1:38:26] the same way a boycott of the mark of
[1:38:27] the beast that will force people
[1:38:30] to worship images and to do things
[1:38:33] the things that we've been taught that
[1:38:35] was contrary to the word of god
[1:38:39] now notice deforest
[1:38:42] now brother branham talks about force
[1:38:44] you can go find it and i didn't i cut so
[1:38:46] much stuff out of this message today
[1:38:48] because i don't want to tire you out
[1:38:50] but brother madame i had the quote where
[1:38:51] brother random says that national force
[1:38:54] forced israel into their homeland
[1:38:58] right that's national force it was
[1:39:01] national force it will be national force
[1:39:05] and we'll put the church in the world
[1:39:06] council of churches
[1:39:09] national force will do that
[1:39:12] but national force will not put the
[1:39:14] people in the bride
[1:39:18] that's what brother branham taught so if
[1:39:20] you're waiting on something to happen
[1:39:23] on a national level that will force us
[1:39:26] to cooperate
[1:39:28] that will force us to be in the bride
[1:39:30] and to be real christians not going to
[1:39:31] happen
[1:39:35] because the truth is if you're forced
[1:39:36] you're going to do what's in your heart
[1:39:38] anyway
[1:39:40] people do as i said what they want to do
[1:39:43] right so it'll be national force that'll
[1:39:47] force
[1:39:47] or it was national force to force the
[1:39:49] jews it'll be national force it forced
[1:39:51] forces at the end time the foolish
[1:39:53] version of those into the image of the
[1:39:55] beast
[1:39:55] enforces the modern church but it's
[1:39:59] amen it's the power of god he says
[1:40:02] that puts the bride puts the people in
[1:40:05] the bride
[1:40:07] the power of god amen so we're not
[1:40:10] looking for a
[1:40:11] national power to come like
[1:40:12] nebuchadnezzar and be raise up some
[1:40:14] image
[1:40:15] to a holy man we're not looking for
[1:40:17] everybody to recognize the message is
[1:40:18] true
[1:40:19] that's not what we're looking for what
[1:40:21] are we looking for we're looking
[1:40:23] for the power of god to put every member
[1:40:26] in the bride and i believe that's what
[1:40:27] he's doing today
[1:40:30] he said brother it'll be so slick and
[1:40:32] sly until it would deceive the very
[1:40:34] elect if possible i'm talking about this
[1:40:36] worship of a holy man he said so you
[1:40:38] better purpose in your heart tonight and
[1:40:39] be filled with god's holy spirit
[1:40:41] that you'll be able to discern the right
[1:40:43] and wrong thing
[1:40:45] when the proclamation is issued
[1:40:48] why now
[1:40:52] what was the idol the idol was
[1:40:53] nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar's
[1:40:55] imagination
[1:40:58] excuse me added to a true prophet's
[1:41:02] revelation
[1:41:04] right the prophet gave him the dream and
[1:41:07] nebuchadnezzar imagined
[1:41:09] and made an image to daniel
[1:41:12] now brother brown said they was to bow
[1:41:14] before this image and to do worship to
[1:41:16] the image
[1:41:17] you notice he said in those times daniel
[1:41:19] was silent
[1:41:21] he said amen oh and he said i hope you
[1:41:23] get this daniel was silent
[1:41:25] letting them he said they had to make
[1:41:26] their own choice
[1:41:29] we have to make our choice today what
[1:41:30] will you worship
[1:41:32] will you worship an image someone
[1:41:33] created out of the message
[1:41:36] will you worship an image that you
[1:41:38] create
[1:41:39] or will you worship god the god of the
[1:41:42] bible revealed by this message
[1:41:46] the image on the pedestal might be a
[1:41:48] holy man
[1:41:49] you say could it be a prophet absolutely
[1:41:51] because it was daniel
[1:41:53] but i believe we've been taught that
[1:41:55] we've been taught better than that
[1:41:58] we know not to worship a prophet but
[1:42:01] what if the pastor's on the pedestal
[1:42:06] what if it's our own image
[1:42:11] where we put ourselves first now we're
[1:42:15] bringing it down aren't we
[1:42:16] put ourselves first in everything we do
[1:42:20] our thoughts matter more than god's word
[1:42:22] does
[1:42:23] god help us today god help me today i
[1:42:27] don't want to do that i don't want to
[1:42:28] worship an image
[1:42:30] i want to worship the god of the bible
[1:42:34] but there were three hebrew children in
[1:42:35] that day shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:42:38] and in verse 16 it says that shadrach
[1:42:41] meshach and abednego answered and said
[1:42:42] to the king oh nebuchadnezzar
[1:42:44] we're not careful to answer thee in this
[1:42:46] matter
[1:42:48] when the time comes that we have to make
[1:42:50] a decision on what to do
[1:42:51] i'm going to follow the word don't you
[1:42:53] realize your whole life is just a series
[1:42:56] of decisions that you make i'm gonna
[1:42:58] follow the word brother danny years ago
[1:43:00] you made a decision to follow the word
[1:43:01] that's why you've remained huh if you've
[1:43:04] been in the church for a long time if
[1:43:06] you've been
[1:43:06] in the message for a long time and you
[1:43:08] stayed steady at some point you had to
[1:43:09] make a decision to follow the word
[1:43:11] and at every junction whenever whenever
[1:43:13] some somebody failed or somebody let
[1:43:16] down
[1:43:16] you weren't following that man you
[1:43:17] followed the word
[1:43:20] huh are you hearing so you didn't
[1:43:22] destroy you yes it hurt but
[1:43:24] you're following the word you had to
[1:43:25] make a decision your life is a series
[1:43:28] of decisions that you make are you going
[1:43:29] to follow the word are you going to be
[1:43:31] like shadrach meshach and abednego who
[1:43:33] said
[1:43:33] we won't be careful to answer you in
[1:43:35] this matter we're not going to be
[1:43:37] careful we're not
[1:43:38] going to we're not going to spare your
[1:43:40] feelings in this
[1:43:41] we will not worship an idol if it be so
[1:43:44] our god whom we serve
[1:43:46] is able to deliver us do you believe
[1:43:48] that today he's able to deliver us from
[1:43:50] all the persecution
[1:43:51] he's able to deliver us from the burning
[1:43:53] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:43:55] of thine hand o king
[1:43:57] but if not be it known unto thee o king
[1:43:59] we will not serve thy gods
[1:44:03] hallelujah it's got to be a life or
[1:44:05] death issue
[1:44:07] it's got to be something you're willing
[1:44:08] to life or death it doesn't matter
[1:44:11] i'm going to serve god
[1:44:15] i'm sorry i feel like i'm screaming at
[1:44:16] you this morning
[1:44:21] i'm going to serve god it's hard i know
[1:44:23] it's hard it's hard on some of us
[1:44:26] some of you have been through some
[1:44:27] things
[1:44:30] some of you dealt with message people
[1:44:33] to the point where you wondered if the
[1:44:35] message was true
[1:44:38] but see not everybody that quotes the
[1:44:39] message is in the message
[1:44:41] or has the message in them
[1:44:45] some of you have dealt with family
[1:44:46] situations that are horrible
[1:44:48] i i've dealt with situations like that
[1:44:51] i know what it's like to question
[1:44:53] everything
[1:44:56] but there's got to come a moment when
[1:44:57] you say even though it's hard
[1:45:00] even though the fire's hot i'm going to
[1:45:03] serve god
[1:45:05] if nobody else does
[1:45:08] god forbid my wife wouldn't my my
[1:45:10] husband would my
[1:45:12] my family wouldn't my my church wouldn't
[1:45:13] i'm still going to
[1:45:16] i'm going to follow the word i'm going
[1:45:18] to put it first i'm going to put the god
[1:45:20] in first place in my life
[1:45:22] if that means getting up in the morning
[1:45:23] and reading and studying and praying
[1:45:25] whatever it is
[1:45:26] lord help me to put you first being
[1:45:30] known unto thee
[1:45:31] oh can we say that to the god of this
[1:45:33] evil age
[1:45:34] be it known unto the old king though
[1:45:36] you're very religious so you might
[1:45:38] it might have a trapping of religious
[1:45:40] but be it known unto the old king
[1:45:42] we will not serve thy gods nor worship
[1:45:45] the golden image which that was set up
[1:45:48] what happened god was watching

[1:45:56] how god was watching
[1:45:58] over his children that day

[1:48:12] with that i've had
[1:48:14] people talk to me tell me there was a
[1:48:15] time when i struggled and i looked even
[1:48:17] my own self i wondered if this message
[1:48:19] was true
[1:48:20] but then something on the inside grabbed
[1:48:22] hold of god
[1:48:26] oh you'll struggle satan is after you

[1:48:35] trying to take you away from the word
[1:48:37] that decision might be something about a
[1:48:38] job something about
[1:48:39] a marriage something about something
[1:48:41] else to try to take you away from the
[1:48:42] word but you're going to stay with the
[1:48:44] word
[1:48:45] you don't have to go to this church to
[1:48:46] stay with the word but you will stay
[1:48:48] with the word
[1:48:51] i'll say it this way you will go to
[1:48:52] church
[1:48:54] you have to stay with the word
[1:48:58] brother branham says he's watching what
[1:48:59] decisions we will make
[1:49:01] whether we'll stand true to the word or
[1:49:02] get away from it

[1:49:08] put forth this effort god's
[1:49:10] god he's watching i put forth this
[1:49:13] effort and i've come the house of god
[1:49:14] and i just don't feel the blessings
[1:49:15] anymore
[1:49:16] you just keep coming keep putting forth
[1:49:18] the effort
[1:49:19] because he's on his way amen when you
[1:49:22] get in the fire
[1:49:23] he'll be there as the fourth man in the
[1:49:25] fire he may not deliver you before the
[1:49:28] king he may not deliver you even at the
[1:49:29] moment you're being thrown in but right
[1:49:31] at the moment you need it
[1:49:33] at the darkest hour that's when he comes
[1:49:35] around
[1:49:36] he's watching you to see whether you'll
[1:49:38] stand true whether we'll stand true to
[1:49:40] the word or get away from it
[1:49:42] children he's still watching today amen
[1:49:46] this message did not come to give us
[1:49:48] another god to add to our imaginations
[1:49:50] but it came to declare that christ is
[1:49:52] the one and the only i am
[1:49:54] who's still alive today still the fourth
[1:49:56] man of the fire
[1:49:58] and if he is i am whatever you have need
[1:50:01] of
[1:50:02] he's here to meet that need you believe
[1:50:05] that let's power heads together
[1:50:07] musicians come
[1:50:13] this afternoon we'll deal with this and
[1:50:17] get a little more specific
[1:50:18] some of these idols that we create but i
[1:50:21] just want to
[1:50:22] just for a few minutes before we have
[1:50:24] communion but
[1:50:26] i want to just invite you to talk to him
[1:50:29] for a moment
[1:50:32] maybe the devil's been talking to you
[1:50:34] and trying to get you to quit
[1:50:37] and i'm not talking about just quitting
[1:50:38] this church i'm talking about quitting
[1:50:40] god
[1:50:42] the devil gets to talking to you like
[1:50:43] this it doesn't matter
[1:50:45] it doesn't matter all these years you've
[1:50:46] served god and then now look at you
[1:50:49] you talked to brother branham that way
[1:50:50] when his wife and his baby was saying
[1:50:53] they're dying
[1:50:55] but he's still the fourth man in the
[1:50:56] fire today
[1:50:58] he's still the great i am he's not the i
[1:51:01] was or the i will be he's i am
[1:51:05] and he's able to come into your
[1:51:07] situation today into the fire
[1:51:12] so you don't understand what i've been
[1:51:13] through but he'll come into the fire
[1:51:16] [Music]
[1:51:18] they come out they didn't smell like
[1:51:20] smoke
[1:51:22] not even a the latches of their shoes
[1:51:24] not even their shoestrings was burned
[1:51:28] you couldn't even tell that they'd been
[1:51:30] through it why because the fourth man
[1:51:32] was in the fire let him be
[1:51:34] that fourth man in the fire today let
[1:51:36] him come down and just deal with you
[1:51:38] he's a real god today he's not an idol
[1:51:40] of imagination
[1:51:41] if you built an idol of imagination cast
[1:51:44] that down today
[1:51:45] and embrace the real i am
