[33:54] sharper than a two-edged sword 1st
[33:56] Samuel chapter 17 and verse 1 I'd like
[34:00] to speak to you tonight on the challenge
[34:02] of a lifetime
[34:04] now the Philistines gathered together
[34:06] their armies to battle and we're
[34:08] gathered together at Shoko which
[34:09] belongeth to Judah and pitched between
[34:12] shoukata syke and FS the mean and Saul
[34:16] and the men of Israel were gathered
[34:18] together and pitched by the Valley of
[34:19] Elah and set the battle in array against
[34:23] the Philistines and the Philistines
[34:25] stood on a mountain on one side and
[34:28] Israel stood on a mountain on the other
[34:30] side and there was a valley between them
[34:34] went out of champion out of the camp of
[34:36] the Philistines named Goliath of Gath
[34:38] whose height was six cubits and a span
[34:41] and had a helmet of brass upon his head
[34:44] and he was armed a coat of mail the
[34:47] weight of the coat was five thousand
[34:49] shekels of brass
[34:50] he had Greaves of brass upon his legs a
[34:53] target of brass between his shoulders
[34:55] the staff of his spear was like a
[34:58] Weaver's beam and a Spears head weighed
[35:01] 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a
[35:03] shield went before him and he stood and
[35:06] cried into the armies of Israel and said
[35:08] unto them why are you come out to set
[35:10] battle in a ray I'm not I have
[35:12] Philistine and he's servants to Saul
[35:14] choose you a man for you let him come
[35:16] down to me if he'd be able to fight with
[35:19] me and to kill me then we will be your
[35:21] servants i prevail against him and kill
[35:24] him then shall you be our servants and
[35:26] serve us and the Philistine said I defy
[35:30] the armies of Israel this day give me a
[35:33] man that we may fight together I pray
[35:37] the Lord without his blessing to the
[35:38] word you may be seated this evening
[35:44] generations are defined but the
[35:46] challenges they face
[35:48] my late grandfather was born in 1923 and
[35:52] his peers he and his peers are called
[35:56] the greatest generation the reason why
[35:59] we call them that is because they faced
[36:00] impossible odds and they won and today
[36:05] we look at that those battles that they
[36:07] went through and in the Second World War
[36:08] in particular and we see how that they
[36:12] fought it we see Hitler has become
[36:14] almost a caricature a cartoon character
[36:17] and we see that the fight that they went
[36:20] through but we see it as an accomplished
[36:22] thing so we don't recognize but they did
[36:25] have to fight and many of them did have
[36:28] to die and many of them faced impossible
[36:32] odds and the ones who were there on the
[36:36] beaches of Normandy knew that the battle
[36:38] was real it wasn't made up it wasn't
[36:41] something that it was a real battle it
[36:44] was something that they would be in the
[36:46] fight of their lives the challenge of a
[36:47] lifetime
[36:48] they want it they overcome it
[36:53] it was an existential threat something
[36:57] that would take them out it was either
[36:59] us or them and and and so we even caused
[37:03] an atomic bomb to be dropped on Japan
[37:06] because it was us or them we look back
[37:08] at that now and think why did we have to
[37:10] do that but the choice was between life
[37:12] and death there were there was nothing
[37:14] else to do
[37:16] and this was the kind of challenge that
[37:19] David and the Israelites faced as he
[37:21] stood there it was a challenge between
[37:24] being a slave and being free
[37:27] between being alive or dead and I want
[37:32] to present to you tonight and just from
[37:35] my heart because I've gotten a couple
[37:38] weeks rest as you know
[37:41] but you know we've been through it and
[37:43] but but this battle that we face and I'm
[37:46] not speaking particular particularly of
[37:49] the coronavirus though that's part of it
[37:52] but the battle that we face in 2020 the
[37:55] battle that we that we face today
[37:59] it's the battle of our lifetime
[38:03] this is what we become known for
[38:06] how we approach and how we overcome and
[38:10] how we fight today is what we become
[38:13] known for and someday you'll be able to
[38:17] look back and see I was I was in the
[38:19] battle of 2020 I
[38:21] fought on those beaches I was there and
[38:25] I overcame
[38:26] by the blood of the lamb in the word of
[38:29] my testimony and
[38:31] so we can know that this is the kind of
[38:34] battle that we face today the Battle of
[38:36] Laodicea it's not a battle of well you
[38:40] can take it or leave it but you got to
[38:41] fight and you got to be willing to face
[38:45] those impossible odds and believe that
[38:47] you're able to win
[38:51] this was the nature of the challenge
[38:54] that David faced it was an absolute
[38:56] threat to their existence
[38:58] he says if I overpower him and kill him
[39:03] then you will be her slaves if I win you
[39:06] become our safes
[39:09] I'm trying not to get too wound up
[39:12] tonight but I'm pretty wound up
[39:17] I'm not very old but in my lifetime in
[39:21] the message we face many challenges
[39:24] I've seen doctrines come and go I've
[39:28] seen preachers rise and fall I've seen
[39:31] people come and go
[39:33] see men that I never thought would fall
[39:35] fall I've seen when that I always
[39:37] thought would serve God not serve God
[39:39] anymore and if you're older than I am
[39:42] today you've probably seen a lot more
[39:45] we've seen battles before but not like
[39:47] this
[39:49] and I'm speaking of the entirety of what
[39:52] we're going through today we've seen
[39:55] great preachers come and great preachers
[39:56] go we've seen churches rise and fall
[39:59] this is different because
[40:02] the nature of this challenge is personal
[40:06] as Goliath said choose a man
[40:10] the children of Israel I think it's
[40:12] interesting that they were perfectly
[40:14] willing to fight with Saul they were
[40:15] perfectly willing to to go with him and
[40:18] and fight Philistines together as a unit
[40:22] they went if you go back and look in the
[40:24] scripture and I didn't get it because I
[40:26] wanted to say focused on what I'm
[40:27] speaking about tonight but you can go
[40:29] back and look in the scripture and find
[40:30] that over and over again they defeated
[40:33] the Philistines the same through steam
[40:36] army in fact the Bible tells us that and
[40:39] you can if you're writing it down in 1st
[40:41] Samuel 1447 that wherever saul turned he
[40:45] vexed the Philistines
[40:48] that he actually fought them and
[40:50] overcame them over and over and over
[40:52] again
[40:53] and here they come again
[40:56] and I think they understood there was
[40:59] something there's something about the
[41:00] enemy that knows
[41:01] when the children of God are going
[41:04] through a hard time
[41:06] because now Saul had back Sid and he
[41:11] wasn't worried was supposed to be and he
[41:14] had not done what God told him to do and
[41:17] so now that same re that had been
[41:19] victorious over and over again but Joe
[41:21] now they become weak and
[41:24] he always comes in that weakened
[41:27] weakening time and tries to fight
[41:30] against the people of God but if they
[41:32] just hung together
[41:33] if they were just fighting together they
[41:37] could have still won I mean there's a
[41:39] reason why the Philistines didn't want
[41:41] to fight him as a whole
[41:43] because they'd already been beaten by a
[41:45] bunch of times
[41:46] they'd whooped them up one side and down
[41:48] the other so now they're they don't want
[41:50] to fight Nadezhda anymore so they said
[41:52] choose out a man
[41:55] that's the kind of battle we face today
[41:58] but then we face a personal battle
[42:00] Satan's out to get you he's out to get
[42:02] me
[42:04] he comes personally to you and tries to
[42:08] get you separated from your identity in
[42:10] the Bride of Christ and and tries to
[42:12] come directly to you and and challenge
[42:14] you as a believer and you've got to
[42:17] respond to that I have to respond to
[42:19] that
[42:21] so Goliath had been in the Philistine
[42:24] army the whole time the Bible says he's
[42:27] a man of war from his youth he was he
[42:30] was probably in those battles he
[42:33] probably fought Saul before in fact the
[42:35] Jews say that that he was there when the
[42:39] Ark of the Covenant was taken from the
[42:40] sons of Eli and they were killed they
[42:43] said a Goliath was there he was the one
[42:45] that did that
[42:47] he was a man of war from his youth
[42:50] now Satan's tactics had changed and his
[42:55] tactic now is to make each man speak for
[42:58] himself
[42:59] and
[43:00] it's Satan's strategy to divide and
[43:03] conquer us when Julius Caesar went into
[43:05] fight in Gaul a lot of people mistakenly
[43:08] think that the Roman army was just
[43:10] unbeatable but there's a reason why they
[43:13] did they always changed the odds
[43:16] they always beat everybody because they
[43:18] never fought everybody at wants so what
[43:22] they did is they went into going he they
[43:24] realized that they had many less fewer
[43:26] soldiers and were much weaker than the
[43:30] armies of God the armies of goers flit
[43:33] up and so what they would do is they
[43:36] would go in and Julius Caesar would go
[43:38] in and he would bribe one tribe and
[43:41] fight the other one and and then he
[43:45] bribed this one over here and fight this
[43:47] one
[43:48] and he did it over and over again till
[43:50] there were no tribes left he couldn't
[43:52] have faced all of them so he used to
[43:55] carrot and a stick he'd take this one
[43:56] and draw them in saying will make you
[43:58] citizens we'll do all these things all
[44:00] these promises needed fight over here
[44:02] and then when he beat these eternal and
[44:04] fought against feasts that he just had
[44:07] just given the assurances - he could not
[44:11] beat them as a whole so he devised the
[44:12] strategy to fight them one at a time and
[44:14] it worked we're all world for a thousand
[44:17] years
[44:18] because not because they were stronger
[44:21] but because they divided so they could
[44:24] conquer number the Bible says in the
[44:27] church age book he said now watch this
[44:28] carefully what did political pagan Rome
[44:31] do that was the basis of her success she
[44:33] divided and conquered that was the seed
[44:36] of Rome divide and conquer her iron
[44:38] teeth tore and devoured whom she tore
[44:41] and devoured could not rise again that's
[44:43] when she destroyed Carthage and so did
[44:45] assault he said the same iron seed
[44:47] remained in her when she arose it's the
[44:50] false church and her policies remain the
[44:52] same divide and conquer he said that is
[44:55] declared an ism and God hates it
[44:58] see what they would do is they would
[45:00] identify a chief and
[45:03] make him jealous of all the other chiefs
[45:06] and then they would put him they would
[45:09] divide him off from the rest of the
[45:10] people and then he would turn himself
[45:13] against his own and the Romans weren't
[45:16] his friends don't you see this the same
[45:18] thing the devil does today if he can get
[45:21] us to fight one another he don't have to
[45:23] do much work
[45:24] you don't have to defeat us and as
[45:27] brother Darrell Ward is quoted before
[45:29] but I think it bears quoting when
[45:30] Geronimo was where they were fighting
[45:33] against one another than the Indians and
[45:34] Geronimo said there's too few of us to
[45:37] fight one another
[45:38] there's not enough of us left to fight
[45:42] one another we're too few and so it's
[45:44] the same concept that the u.s. used
[45:46] against the American Indians as long as
[45:48] we can keep them tribal we can defeat
[45:50] them
[45:52] but see my enemy is your enemy
[45:56] David's enemy was Saul's enemy and Saul
[45:59] thought David was his enemy
[46:02] but it wasn't David that was an enemy
[46:05] was Goliath it was the Philistines they
[46:08] had a mutual enemy but the what Satan
[46:11] does is tries to divide us as much as he
[46:13] can and
[46:15] so again he names
[46:17] something in first Shane was 17 and 8 he
[46:20] stood in crying of the armies of Israel
[46:21] and said unto them why are you come out
[46:23] to set your battle in array not I have
[46:26] Philistines who he identifies who he is
[46:28] he said in ye servants to salt
[46:31] now they weren't servants of salt they
[46:35] were servants of God
[46:38] they weren't servants of Saul they were
[46:40] children of God
[46:42] how long is her identity was children of
[46:44] God they could fight together they could
[46:47] fight but he identifies them as the
[46:49] servants of Saul he said choose a man
[46:52] for you let him come down to me and the
[46:54] reason why it does that is he because if
[46:56] he can get you to put your entire
[46:57] confidence in a man in one single man or
[47:00] I'll help you hear me tonight because
[47:02] it's it's rampant today even and the
[47:05] message that people promote a man and
[47:07] then when you promote a man to a certain
[47:10] place and then that man becomes your
[47:12] salvation
[47:13] that man becomes it and so when he
[47:16] identifies services so if if Saul
[47:18] wouldn't come out and fight him then how
[47:21] could his service fight him
[47:24] if Saul got defeated then the service
[47:27] were defeated
[47:28] you understand why he does what he does
[47:30] for the marcelles mechanism to divide
[47:33] and conquer if you can defeat this man
[47:35] then you've got the people defeated
[47:37] because the people can't fight on their
[47:39] own Oh
[47:42] help us Lord
[47:44] choose your man he says let him come
[47:46] down see Satan did that to Adam and Eve
[47:49] he never tried to get them together but
[47:52] he waited to issue his challenge until
[47:53] evil us alone
[47:55] so it was an individual challenge it was
[47:58] also a challenge to bring fear and if
[48:02] there ever was a time when we're
[48:03] fighting fears today
[48:05] this is the hour when Satan brings fear
[48:08] in the minds of the people and you felt
[48:12] it you know what it's like I felt it
[48:14] when you sit there and I sit there on my
[48:17] first couple of nights and you don't
[48:20] know what's gonna happen you don't know
[48:22] what's going to take places so you're
[48:23] just sitting there about three weeks to
[48:25] go I'm sitting there I'm running this
[48:27] fever and I'm I'm getting sick and when
[48:29] got tested and I found out they had
[48:31] coronavirus and it's like a fear that
[48:33] gets on you like if someone told you you
[48:36] had cancer
[48:37] and for me and I'm not downplaying
[48:40] anyone else the symptoms kiss up for
[48:41] some people is much worse but for me it
[48:43] was like catching a bad cold but the
[48:46] fear of it was different
[48:49] the fear of it was something else and I
[48:54] actually
[48:55] was up all night you know praying that
[48:58] it didn't give it to anybody else and
[49:00] couldn't sleep because I knew that if I
[49:03] was sick and God moved marvelous settled
[49:06] I don't think we realized how much God
[49:08] has helped us
[49:10] that we were able to have church tonight
[49:14] we were able to were able to get
[49:17] together because God just intervened on
[49:19] our behalf to be able to do that but see
[49:22] this was this is glass ambition he never
[49:25] wanted to fight
[49:26] he never had any intention of fighting
[49:28] his armor was so heavy probably couldn't
[49:31] have fought much anyway a
[49:36] real good soldier looking to go ahead
[49:38] and think wait a minute you can't hardly
[49:40] move
[49:41] follow that iron and brass
[49:43] there was a valley between women and in
[49:46] the middle of the Valley of Elah there's
[49:47] a brook or like a ravine and which David
[49:51] went down into Goliath couldn't have
[49:52] even crossed it to get to him
[49:55] David had to go find him
[49:59] so he couldn't even but his idea was to
[50:02] bring fear to be so big and so massive
[50:06] that they were just power to him
[50:09] to get each and every one of them to
[50:12] stay home from the battle
[50:17] and he did it for 40 days the Philistine
[50:21] is censored for fame in 1716 that the
[50:23] Philistine drew near morning and evening
[50:25] every day he presented himself
[50:30] morning and evening he never let them
[50:32] forget
[50:34] that they were he was making this
[50:36] challenge
[50:37] every day every morning every evening
[50:39] when they woke up in the morning to ruin
[50:42] their in the evening to ruin their sleep
[50:45] every morning he made its challenge
[50:47] every evening he made his challenge you
[50:50] know I think you'd do us good and I I
[50:51] have a bad habit of this too you get up
[50:53] in the morning you read the news before
[50:55] you go to bed you read the news I think
[50:57] we ought to read the Bible and get some
[51:00] encouragement in the morning in the
[51:01] evening because glassmaking a boast he's
[51:05] making up he's challenging us today and
[51:08] he draws near morning and evening and
[51:10] presents himself he presented himself 40
[51:12] days
[51:13] now brother Branham says that three is
[51:17] God's number in his numerology God is
[51:20] known by his numbers three is perfection
[51:22] 7 is worship 24 is worship he said 40 is
[51:26] temptation
[51:28] 50 is pinnacles
[51:30] Fortius temptation Jesus was in the
[51:33] wilderness for 40 days Elijah was as
[51:35] well rain fell for 40 days and 40 nights
[51:39] joshua spied out the land for 40 days
[51:44] there was a time
[51:46] forty is a signal or a type of the time
[51:50] that it takes to be tempted to be tested
[51:54] and to decide what you're going to do
[51:56] it's a set period
[51:59] it also represents judgment I'm so glad
[52:03] of that because
[52:04] there is an end and I want us to
[52:08] understand that tonight that there is an
[52:10] end
[52:11] there is an in my wife and kids sitting
[52:13] at home wondering if they'll ever be an
[52:15] end to the quarantine
[52:17] but there is an end
[52:20] there's a set number of days
[52:26] there's a set time it will come to an
[52:29] end listen we're only here for a short
[52:31] time we're only here life it's like a
[52:33] vapor in it it appears for a little
[52:35] while and then it goes this is our
[52:36] testing time this is the challenge of
[52:39] our lifetime this is what we have to
[52:41] face this is what we're up against then
[52:43] but it's only for a time and we even go
[52:46] through periods of our life there's
[52:48] periods of temptation but God is showing
[52:50] us by these 40 sets or dove days for
[52:53] this period of 40 days
[52:55] yes it does come to an end it's long
[52:59] it's not just a day or two it's not just
[53:01] an hour - but it does come to an end
[53:04] hey man you will not tempt you beyond
[53:07] overcoming ability I
[53:09] hope you're hearing me tonight
[53:12] you know we didn't know we could
[53:14] overcome what we've overcome until we
[53:15] did it
[53:18] David believed that he could overcome
[53:21] Goliath but when he overcame when he
[53:23] come out on the other side of the valley
[53:25] had Goliath had in his hand he knew
[53:28] hey bet he knew them that he can
[53:31] overcome he knew then that it was this
[53:34] big and giant as they said it was he
[53:36] knew then that it wasn't as big it would
[53:38] not be the thing that took him out of
[53:40] this life he believed before but now he
[53:43] knew his brother Adam preached I have
[53:45] heard but now I see now I see the
[53:48] reality of it there will come a set time
[53:50] there will come a period when we can
[53:52] reach the other end of the battle we
[53:53] look back and say I know that God moves
[53:55] for me in 2020 I know that God protected
[53:59] me in 2020 I know God kept me I know
[54:01] whatever it was that I had to go through
[54:04] it was a set period of time
[54:06] and it was over
[54:09] amen
[54:11] for Samuel 1711
[54:14] let's look at the sphere that's coming
[54:16] on Saul in the children of Israel and so
[54:18] on all Israel heard these words those
[54:20] words of the Philistine they were
[54:21] dismayed greatly afraid and all the men
[54:24] of Istra when they saw the men fled from
[54:26] him and were sore afraid
[54:28] listen as we said he identified them in
[54:31] Saul's army and then he caused fear to
[54:34] strike so when he did he caused him to
[54:37] lose confidence in their ability to
[54:39] fight Oh
[54:43] they lost their confidence because they
[54:46] looked at this man and said this man
[54:47] failed so now we must fail
[54:51] but God didn't put his confidence in the
[54:53] arm of flesh
[54:55] he said he said even in the scripture
[54:57] that a man who has confidence in the arm
[54:59] of flesh it's like a heath in the desert
[55:01] he's like a tumbleweed that blows across
[55:02] the desert but a man has got his
[55:04] confidence in God it's like a tree
[55:06] planted by the rivers of water
[55:09] and so he identifies them assaults armed
[55:13] he comes to him to put their confidence
[55:14] in soul and then they lost because their
[55:17] champion the one who was hidden so
[55:18] shoulders above the rest was also afraid
[55:20] and he was a human being too and he was
[55:24] backside to boot
[55:26] now it's strange as I said that they
[55:28] didn't just keep fighting
[55:30] why not just ignore Goliath
[55:33] because you've beaten them before
[55:36] why not just fight
[55:38] glass couldn't have overcome the whole
[55:40] army
[55:43] but see it was Satan's fear tactics now
[55:47] the natural order of things and think
[55:50] with me about this for a moment the
[55:53] natural order of things was that the
[55:55] Israelites were the possessors of the
[55:57] land
[55:58] so God tells Joshua he said go be of
[56:02] good courage he said take courage be
[56:04] strong be very courageous I've given you
[56:07] the land he said every place that the
[56:08] sole of your foot tribes on he said
[56:10] that's yours
[56:11] so they they took the land they were on
[56:15] the offensive when Saul was first
[56:18] crowned King they went on the offensive
[56:20] they went into battle against the
[56:22] Philistines against the ammonites
[56:24] against the Moabites against all the
[56:25] different people they would stood him on
[56:28] every side bow and Saul back said what
[56:30] happened they become defensive and when
[56:33] they become defensive they didn't keep
[56:35] fighting but they just sit back in the
[56:38] camp too scared to fight
[56:41] see the natural order of things was for
[56:44] them to fight
[56:45] not for Goliath to be making the
[56:47] challenge but for them to be making a
[56:49] challenge to Goliath
[56:51] see had they faithfully observed the
[56:55] conditions that they had been given
[56:57] every time a new enemy had trespassed
[56:59] upon their borders they would have gone
[57:03] out against him in aggression
[57:05] that is the work of God's people excuse
[57:09] me I got something in my eyes it's what
[57:12] it is this is
[57:13] an sanitizer
[57:18] but that's an that some preachers didn't
[57:20] have to face a long time ago for the
[57:22] Harvey that's a new thing but
[57:26] aggression on the foes of God a man is
[57:28] the work of God's people that's our work
[57:30] and so when the natural order is
[57:34] reversed and when God's people are not
[57:35] aggressive when they are not on the
[57:38] offensive then they tremble at the
[57:41] aggressive on thoughts of their flow
[57:43] that should be our attitude towards evil
[57:47] are you here mate and I Church our
[57:48] attitude towards sin or how did you
[57:51] towards the enemies should never be
[57:52] defensive I'm sick and tired of sitting
[57:56] back and waiting to see what the devil
[57:58] does
[58:00] I'm tired of sitting back and waiting to
[58:02] see what the devil does to them to
[58:04] message people I'm tired of waiting to
[58:06] see what the devil does to my family I'm
[58:07] tired of waiting to see what the devil
[58:09] does put yourself there you're tired of
[58:11] waiting and seeing what the devil does
[58:13] and just reacting to everything the
[58:15] devil does in your life there's got to
[58:17] come a point where you step up and say
[58:19] hey I want to fight
[58:22] you say well there's nothing I can do I
[58:25] don't know the thing to do and I'm
[58:26] taking all these all these precautions
[58:28] and we should and we will continue to
[58:30] take every precaution that we can to
[58:32] keep everybody safe for listen it's time
[58:34] we went on the offensive it's time we
[58:37] quit just reacting to everything that
[58:38] was going on and went on the offensive
[58:40] how do we do that we do that because we
[58:42] can pray we serve an Almighty God we
[58:45] serve a God who's able we serve a God
[58:47] when I I'm shut in the house by myself
[58:49] there's nothing else I can do but pray I
[58:51] like to be able to reach out and touch
[58:53] people and shake their hand put my home
[58:55] run home but there's nothing else I can
[58:56] do but pray but it's probably the best
[58:58] way I can spend my time anyway
[59:00] are you now it's probably the best thing
[59:04] that we could do anyway is to pray and
[59:05] so the aggressive the aggressive the the
[59:09] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[59:11] availeth much we could say the
[59:14] aggressive prayer the prayer Lord as
[59:17] jay-bez says Lord and hurts my territory
[59:21] he was being aggressive he say Lord I
[59:24] don't want what somebody else has I
[59:25] don't want their land but I want
[59:26] everything that's mine
[59:29] I don't want to leave one stone unturned
[59:31] if there's something that's mine I
[59:32] wanted if healing is mine I wanted if
[59:34] salvation is mine I want it I
[59:39] know this is a little different tonight
[59:41] but I've been shut up for a couple weeks
[59:42] so
[59:45] if we do not make aggressive war
[59:48] against the enemy and we fight a
[59:52] spiritual enemy we will fight against
[59:53] flesh and blood
[59:54] we fight spiritual wickedness in high
[59:57] places
[59:58] we fight with spiritual weapons if we do
[1:00:03] not make war Satan will come in
[1:00:05] whenever you see what did David do when
[1:00:09] he made his mistake of Bathsheba it's
[1:00:10] because he did not make war against the
[1:00:12] enemy and
[1:00:13] if there's something the devil's trying
[1:00:15] to get us to do today is just to sit
[1:00:17] back and take it sit back and take it
[1:00:20] and just just sit back and let the devil
[1:00:22] do what he wants to do and run havoc but
[1:00:24] I'm here to tell you tonight I'm tired
[1:00:25] of sitting back and taking it
[1:00:29] Shambo had to get to a place you've
[1:00:31] heard the story so many dumb he had to
[1:00:32] get to a place he was tired of sitting
[1:00:34] back and taking it he said oh I've got
[1:00:36] her as an ox go but they left me an ox
[1:00:38] coat the Philistines had all the swords
[1:00:41] took him on our land of Israel and all
[1:00:43] they left him was a file to sharpen the
[1:00:44] Ox coat he said okay I'll keep the Ox
[1:00:47] code sharp and when they come around my
[1:00:50] time of year I'm gonna take the Ox coat
[1:00:51] and slay every enemy that gets in my way
[1:00:53] because I'm tired of sitting back I'm a
[1:00:56] son of God are you with me tonight you
[1:01:03] wonder why the devil just runs rampant
[1:01:06] it's because we just let him
[1:01:09] and I'm not being trying to be mean
[1:01:11] tonight y'all know that
[1:01:13] isn't that what we do when we lose why
[1:01:17] do we lose you
[1:01:18] know it's a big deal for a nation like
[1:01:21] this one to lose a war
[1:01:23] because we got everything on our side
[1:01:26] the US if we lose a war that's somebody
[1:01:31] messed up
[1:01:33] because we've got all the guns all the
[1:01:37] money all the weapons
[1:01:39] don't you realize that we're like that
[1:01:41] as children of God we've got all the
[1:01:43] weapons we've got all the guns we've got
[1:01:46] all we've got all the power of God
[1:01:48] behind us if we lose the war
[1:01:52] it won't be because of of what he did as
[1:01:57] but I he always told us he said we
[1:02:00] overcome with the blood of the Lamb in
[1:02:01] the word of our testimony the blood of
[1:02:03] the lamb is not the problem
[1:02:04] if there's a problem it's on the other
[1:02:07] end
[1:02:08] the blood of the Lamb works do we still
[1:02:11] believe that I'm trying not to get too
[1:02:13] close to you tonight the blood of the
[1:02:15] Lamb works
[1:02:17] the blood of the lamb is still the same
[1:02:19] blood that's the same powers that always
[1:02:22] did the same blood that save you can
[1:02:23] hear you the same blood that brought you
[1:02:25] out of sin can bring you into a place
[1:02:27] where you should be today the same blood
[1:02:29] and so you make those footsteps of
[1:02:31] possession that's your testimony
[1:02:34] in the Civil War I was reading a book
[1:02:37] while I was down and the book was about
[1:02:39] General Grant because you know they
[1:02:41] tried to tear down his statue here
[1:02:42] recently and so I got curious and I went
[1:02:45] back in I had read some things I had
[1:02:47] read part of his autobiography but I
[1:02:49] thought I'm gonna read this biography
[1:02:50] and they cut it up into five books I
[1:02:52] believe of his life so very detailed and
[1:02:55] I took one of those books and it was
[1:02:57] when he took over the the Army of the
[1:02:59] Potomac and he began to fight against
[1:03:02] robert e lee and what they had done from
[1:03:04] 1862 McCaleb until 1864 the army of the
[1:03:09] potomac was the greatest army that had
[1:03:11] ever been formed General George
[1:03:13] McClellan had made them into an army
[1:03:15] that was the best that could be at that
[1:03:18] time the most modern the most equipment
[1:03:20] they had the most men the most horses
[1:03:22] the most cannon everything was the best
[1:03:25] but they set back in Washington and
[1:03:28] watch General Robert Lee Lee with half
[1:03:32] the number of men
[1:03:34] running around all over Virginia and
[1:03:37] whenever he'd make a move they go try to
[1:03:39] stop him and he make a move over here
[1:03:41] they try to stop him and they'd win a
[1:03:44] battle and then withdraw
[1:03:46] and they did this for three years over
[1:03:50] and over and over again and finally
[1:03:52] finally General Grant took over the army
[1:03:55] and he said wait a minute I've got a big
[1:03:58] army I got more horses I've got more
[1:04:01] cannon there's no reason to lose and so
[1:04:05] he first won the Battle of Shiloh and
[1:04:07] when he fought at Shiloh the first day
[1:04:09] they got beat man they got beat bad in
[1:04:12] the first day after the end at the end
[1:04:14] of the day when they're surveying the
[1:04:15] wreckage and the damage and any other
[1:04:17] general would have just walked away from
[1:04:18] it cut its losses and cross back over
[1:04:21] the river and beseech General Grant knew
[1:04:23] something that the other ones the others
[1:04:25] didn't know he knew there were
[1:04:27] reinforcements coming because he'd
[1:04:29] already made plans that this was gonna
[1:04:31] be a long battle he's so many times we
[1:04:34] planned for it just being a day or a
[1:04:35] week or a month and so we get dismayed
[1:04:37] when it goes longer than that but now he
[1:04:40] knew he was in the Battle of a lifetime
[1:04:42] this was gonna make or break his
[1:04:43] reputation so he didn't just leave it to
[1:04:45] chance
[1:04:46] but what he did is he had 40,000 more
[1:04:49] soldiers on a boat headed that direction
[1:04:53] amen so at the end of the day they said
[1:04:56] boy it was a hard day wasn't it he said
[1:04:57] yeah we'll whip them tomorrow though
[1:05:00] will whip them tomorrow though why was
[1:05:03] he able to do that because
[1:05:05] because he knew oh my his army was
[1:05:09] bigger he knew he had reinforcements and
[1:05:12] and the Confederates didn't have any
[1:05:14] Church we could only realize tonight
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:17] what we have is more that's what that's
[1:05:21] what Elijah had to make his servant
[1:05:23] realize there's more with us and be with
[1:05:25] them there's angels at the position
[1:05:28] there's people there's angels standing
[1:05:31] all around you you can't see him but the
[1:05:33] brown said if you could all see with
[1:05:34] spiritual eyes he said you see angels at
[1:05:37] the position at every pew
[1:05:39] the Bible says the angel of the lord
[1:05:41] encamps around about them to fear him
[1:05:43] and
[1:05:44] so we know that that General Grant knew
[1:05:48] that there was some there's more with
[1:05:50] him than was with the enemy
[1:05:52] he was no robert e lee he was no
[1:05:55] military genius he had confidence in his
[1:05:58] army and his weapons he says and he made
[1:06:02] this strategic change he told his
[1:06:05] generals he said whatever robert e lee
[1:06:08] does we don't care about
[1:06:10] we don't care what he does we're going
[1:06:12] to Richmond
[1:06:14] and he sent back a telegram after they
[1:06:16] got beat a couple of times going to
[1:06:17] Richmond and President Lincoln asked him
[1:06:20] about it he sent back a telegram and
[1:06:22] says we'll reach he said we'll fight
[1:06:24] this battle will win this battle if it
[1:06:26] takes all summer and it did in the
[1:06:29] summer of 1864 was the worst summer of
[1:06:31] the war but they were on the winning
[1:06:33] track they were no longer being defeated
[1:06:36] every time and just going back and now
[1:06:39] they were on their way to Richmond and
[1:06:40] they weren't going to stop till they got
[1:06:41] there Oh church if we can only realized
[1:06:44] we've got a gold - we've got to go -
[1:06:47] we're gonna defeat death one of these
[1:06:49] days our
[1:06:50] generation has to defeat this somebody's
[1:06:52] got to defeat them if we're gonna defeat
[1:06:54] death we gotta set a goal we've got to
[1:06:57] set a goal and say I'm not gonna stop
[1:06:58] halfway I'm not gonna stop luck down the
[1:07:01] channel somewhere but I'm going to keep
[1:07:03] going if I have to fight it out on this
[1:07:05] line if I fall let someone else come in
[1:07:07] and stand in my place
[1:07:09] if I if I get wounded in the battle if
[1:07:12] someone else come let there be
[1:07:13] reinforcements ready because we're going
[1:07:16] to Richmond
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:20] see brother brother says what is Satan's
[1:07:22] weapon against you it's to try to get
[1:07:25] you to just believe your weapon
[1:07:27] he disarms you if he can get you to just
[1:07:31] believe your weapon is equivalent if he
[1:07:35] gets you to believe that your weapon is
[1:07:37] not strong enough he has disarmed you he
[1:07:40] said look he's disarmed you and he gets
[1:07:42] you to disbelieve that weapon when you
[1:07:44] lay that down that finishes your fight
[1:07:47] you're done hold that weapon he says
[1:07:50] don't you lay it down
[1:07:53] he says in one of the million speaking
[1:07:55] of David he says as we think of David as
[1:07:58] he was given a charge over a few sheep
[1:08:00] just a few one day a bear came in and
[1:08:02] got that one little sheep and took it
[1:08:04] out would have eaten it up like a cancer
[1:08:06] would eat up a body we're huge lion but
[1:08:09] David not too well equipped with a rifle
[1:08:11] not a swordsman but with only a
[1:08:13] slingshot he went after that she may not
[1:08:17] be too much equipped as a preacher of
[1:08:18] the Helen but I'm going after that sheep
[1:08:20] you may not be too equipped as a singer
[1:08:23] or whatever it is that you are but
[1:08:25] you're going after that she
[1:08:27] may not be the biggest Church in the
[1:08:29] message what we're going after those
[1:08:31] sheep
[1:08:32] huh he said David not you all equipped
[1:08:35] but he went after that sheep but when he
[1:08:36] found the animal that was about to kill
[1:08:39] the little sheep he's through it with
[1:08:41] the slingshot just a simple little
[1:08:42] weapon with a piece of leather and a
[1:08:44] string but he had confidence in it
[1:08:48] listen what brother branham says he's
[1:08:50] praying and he says we have no great
[1:08:52] genius among us Lord we are simple
[1:08:55] people with a simple little prayer but
[1:08:58] we are coming this morning after the
[1:08:59] father sheep that woman that has walked
[1:09:02] the streets miserably smoking cigarettes
[1:09:04] trying to find peace through the
[1:09:06] cigarette that man who has smelled the
[1:09:09] glass and tried to set it back but the
[1:09:10] enemy holds him tight that boy or girl
[1:09:13] has tried to do right that just can't
[1:09:15] find strength to break away from the
[1:09:16] wrong thing we come in the name of the
[1:09:19] Lord Jesus to claim that sheep
[1:09:22] what did Jesus do he went down any
[1:09:25] thought or he went down he left the 99
[1:09:27] he went the Good Shepherd went to seek
[1:09:29] the one
[1:09:31] doctor today we've lost our focus what
[1:09:34] are we supposed to do what he what does
[1:09:35] David supposed to do he's supposed to go
[1:09:37] down after that sheep why because he
[1:09:40] believes his weapon is equivalent he
[1:09:42] believes his weapons better than hey he
[1:09:44] believes his weapon is better than
[1:09:45] anything the world has to offer
[1:09:47] I'm going after that sheep I
[1:09:54] feel like the mouse that fell into the
[1:09:56] brewery
[1:10:01] I'm not dying up here I'm out of breath
[1:10:03] because I'm bad that's most of it
[1:10:06] just lighten it up for you a little bit
[1:10:10] the story told the mouse fell into the
[1:10:12] brewery VAT you've heard the story the
[1:10:15] cat was chasing just every up one side
[1:10:17] and down the other he fell in there and
[1:10:19] swallowed a little bit of that and he
[1:10:20] come crawling out he said where's that
[1:10:22] cat
[1:10:26] but we got something more than false
[1:10:28] bravado

[1:10:32] the Lord we've got a slingshot we've got
[1:10:35] confidence in let's go after that sheet

[1:12:31] through a battle
[1:12:33] I know what it's like to come out on the
[1:12:35] other side
[1:12:36] something just stabbed but this last six
[1:12:39] months has been a battle we've been
[1:12:41] fighting but it's time we'd come out the
[1:12:43] other side but to come out with a head
[1:12:45] not to come out with the head of the
[1:12:47] enemy and wave it in front of the people
[1:12:49] and say we got proof that we can
[1:12:50] overcome we've got proof that we don't
[1:12:53] have to sit back and take it anymore
[1:12:57] people say you might as well give up you
[1:12:59] might as well quit why quit
[1:13:02] somebody's got to do it everybody said
[1:13:05] well if you do that if you go there if
[1:13:07] you preach there to do that you you'll
[1:13:09] ruin your ministry they probably said
[1:13:10] that to David do
[1:13:12] if you go that you'll just you get
[1:13:14] messed up you get identified as somebody
[1:13:16] who wasn't able to do it no I believe my
[1:13:19] God is able to do it
[1:13:21] that one that that's going off that one
[1:13:24] that's gone in the wrong way let's go
[1:13:26] after that one
[1:13:28] God let me come back in this area for a
[1:13:31] reason I'm sorry I'm being way too
[1:13:32] personal but let's go after those ones
[1:13:35] let's go after those ones we defy the
[1:13:38] enemy he said because it's a simple
[1:13:40] thing a slingshot of Prayer but we're
[1:13:44] coming to bring that one back to the
[1:13:45] father's fault that we might give an
[1:13:48] account remember with preachers on that
[1:13:50] recently we might give an account of
[1:13:52] those things that's been committed to
[1:13:54] our hand
[1:13:56] let's go after those ones oh
[1:13:59] my but the band says may the power of
[1:14:03] God now strike faith down in the hearts
[1:14:05] of the people may that lost soul return
[1:14:07] this morning may the temptations of this
[1:14:10] life turn him away let him go may find
[1:14:13] himself safely upon the Masters
[1:14:14] shoulders being carried back to safety
[1:14:16] again
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:20] no I'm not presenting to you today that
[1:14:23] the strength of Goliath isn't real in
[1:14:26] Israel
[1:14:28] it was something that that present
[1:14:31] generation had he looked at before
[1:14:33] last that are always been there but he's
[1:14:36] saved with the pack now he stepped out
[1:14:38] in front now they knew his name
[1:14:42] now they knew what he wants and what he
[1:14:44] could do and I'm sure there were stories
[1:14:47] that begin to circulate around the camp
[1:14:49] and begin to say well Goliath is able to
[1:14:51] fight like nobody else
[1:14:53] you should have seen the king that he
[1:14:55] worked over here you should have seen
[1:14:57] the mighty men that have met the end of
[1:15:01] his sort
[1:15:03] he was so impressive to that generation
[1:15:06] that every one of them
[1:15:09] fell in fear these were not timid little
[1:15:14] men these were mighty men the Bible says
[1:15:17] that Saul picked the mightiest men in
[1:15:19] Israel to go out and fight and every one
[1:15:23] of them was scared at this giant
[1:15:25] because these stats weren't made up this
[1:15:29] was a real nine and a half foot giant
[1:15:33] they could see he killed other men
[1:15:37] they could go to hell to see well that
[1:15:39] happened and so-and-so searched he never
[1:15:40] recovered
[1:15:42] well these people that something
[1:15:44] happened to him and and they caught this
[1:15:46] and and it just destroyed the church
[1:15:47] they could look they saw the testimony
[1:15:50] from all around they could see on every
[1:15:53] side how real Goliath's sword was
[1:15:56] and it was a good excuse
[1:15:59] are you hearing me just because it was
[1:16:03] real didn't mean it didn't become an
[1:16:04] excuse
[1:16:06] and become a good excuse but it was
[1:16:08] still an excuse and as long as we keep
[1:16:11] making excuses the devil keep providing
[1:16:13] them
[1:16:19] so I said to David they were not able to
[1:16:21] go against this Philistine to fight with
[1:16:23] him for the hour but he youth and he's a
[1:16:24] man of war from his youth
[1:16:28] David wasn't he wasn't sitting there
[1:16:30] saying oh he don't have a weapon that
[1:16:32] brass isn't real it's just clay he knew
[1:16:35] it was real but he had a weapon too
[1:16:39] hey bet I know what alcohol can do I've
[1:16:43] seen it destroy homes I know what
[1:16:46] infidelity can do I know what what but I
[1:16:49] know what the devil likes to do in a
[1:16:51] church I know what gossip can do I know
[1:16:53] what legalism can do I know what the
[1:16:56] power the enemy can do but weapons - you
[1:17:00] got weapons too we know the weapon is
[1:17:03] deadly but we have deadly weapons -
[1:17:07] the Challenger today is strong he's
[1:17:09] convinced mini to give up
[1:17:11] but see what is his challenge let's look
[1:17:14] at this for just a moment because I
[1:17:15] think it's important his challenge was
[1:17:19] not just what Goliath was saying
[1:17:22] but then David had to go into Saul skin
[1:17:25] you remember and what did he do he went
[1:17:29] to South Stan's all said okay you can go
[1:17:30] fight him here's some armor
[1:17:33] you can go fight him but first become
[1:17:36] like everybody else
[1:17:39] you can go fight him but first here's
[1:17:42] some armor here's some ecclesiastical
[1:17:44] ideas
[1:17:45] here's some denomination you can fight
[1:17:49] him but just be like the rest of the
[1:17:51] church's fighting like the rest of the
[1:17:53] churches do
[1:17:55] here's some armor and so he tries to put
[1:17:58] that armor on David and it didn't fit
[1:17:59] right
[1:18:01] you can't wear it
[1:18:03] because it would've made him like
[1:18:05] everyone else I don't want to be like
[1:18:07] everyone else because everyone else is
[1:18:09] losing
[1:18:10] let me have big churches but they're
[1:18:12] losing it may have lots of music and
[1:18:15] lots of things but they're losing I
[1:18:17] don't want to be like everybody else I
[1:18:20] want to be like David if there's only
[1:18:22] one of me let me be one that can defeat
[1:18:24] my enemy
[1:18:26] there was no one like David in the army
[1:18:29] nobody like David that would walk out
[1:18:31] before an armored man like that was just
[1:18:32] a slingshot but it was exactly what
[1:18:34] would meet the challenge of that hour
[1:18:37] and Satan would like to get us with a
[1:18:39] carrot and a stick and begin to tell us
[1:18:42] what it doesn't matter be like everybody
[1:18:44] else
[1:18:44] it's a carrot and a stick here's a stick
[1:18:47] will be the coronavirus or persecution
[1:18:49] or financial trouble and here's the
[1:18:51] carrot over here just come be like
[1:18:52] everybody else you won't have to deal
[1:18:53] with it if you didn't go to church at
[1:18:56] all you wouldn't have to worry about
[1:18:57] catching it at church
[1:19:00] what is the carrot and a stick
[1:19:02] so what the devil does like I said
[1:19:04] divide and conquer they can't get you at
[1:19:07] the stick he'll get you at the carrot
[1:19:08] and the stick just becomes an excuse to
[1:19:11] eat Garet well might as well because
[1:19:14] everybody else is losing anyway no we
[1:19:17] have a God who wins every time
[1:19:20] and so but the random in the Feast of
[1:19:24] the trumpets he takes this and he talks
[1:19:25] about what's coming in our day this is
[1:19:27] the challenge of our lifetime this
[1:19:30] banana is what we have to fight not just
[1:19:33] coronavirus that's a big thing that's a
[1:19:35] giant 2020 is a giant everything in the
[1:19:38] world's happened in 2020 I saw an eagle
[1:19:40] carrying a shark the other day and they
[1:19:43] said that would be 2020 would be like
[1:19:45] that you know and that's the kind of
[1:19:47] time we have we got everything to kill
[1:19:48] you killer Hornets killer viruses
[1:19:51] everything else every day there's
[1:19:53] something new that could kill you but
[1:19:56] listen wow what is our battle our battle
[1:19:59] is Satan trying to tell us to be like
[1:20:01] everybody else
[1:20:03] but the brain says what it's done it in
[1:20:05] the cunningness he said he come in like
[1:20:07] flatteries what has he done he's
[1:20:08] bringing the Protestant ecumenical
[1:20:10] council the world churches the spirit of
[1:20:12] Antichrist upon both of them bringing
[1:20:15] them to the slaughter who's talking
[1:20:16] about that Jewish group there or the
[1:20:19] Hilary night Minh that we're driving
[1:20:20] those Jews back to their homeland
[1:20:22] talking about how they slaughtered five
[1:20:24] million Jews six million Jews but now
[1:20:28] that same spirit comes in an
[1:20:31] ecclesiastical realm gifts the bride
[1:20:34] he said bringing them to the slaughter
[1:20:37] just like they did the other in the hour
[1:20:39] to call the bride
[1:20:41] he said how lose some clothes
[1:20:45] loose in the ecclesiastical church
[1:20:48] spirit loosed upon what not upon the
[1:20:51] denominations but upon the bride
[1:20:53] but here you'll get it he said the bride
[1:20:56] will go now go through that time
[1:20:59] and
[1:21:01] so it won't be like it was for the Jews
[1:21:05] we've got a promise of that church he
[1:21:08] said all we're all going to be closed up
[1:21:09] we're all gonna have to go out in the
[1:21:10] woods no as long as the bride is here
[1:21:12] we'll be able to have Church it might be
[1:21:15] persecution and things happen or well
[1:21:17] there may be all kinds of things change
[1:21:19] but there will be a people who be able
[1:21:20] to do what God said
[1:21:23] on the surprise here there'll be a way
[1:21:26] huh together together
[1:21:28] because he said do that more as you see
[1:21:31] the Day approaching
[1:21:32] so there will be away brother Anderson
[1:21:34] before they set us up will go up
[1:21:37] so he says the bride will not go through
[1:21:40] that time the Bible says not the church
[1:21:41] will will not the bride he said
[1:21:43] ministers can't you see that brethren
[1:21:44] you say the church has to go through the
[1:21:46] persecution for the perfection of it the
[1:21:48] blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride
[1:21:49] a man who chooses a wife don't put us
[1:21:52] through a lot of punishment or I love
[1:21:53] this I love this because he doesn't do
[1:21:56] with preachers either a
[1:21:58] man who chooses a bride doesn't bring a
[1:22:00] pastor along to punish the people he
[1:22:02] chose
[1:22:05] he doesn't he doesn't choose somebody to
[1:22:07] punish him
[1:22:09] he's already found grace with her
[1:22:13] bed and if there's anything he'll keep
[1:22:16] her from every place to turn her hand so
[1:22:19] the pastor might have to preach some
[1:22:20] things are a little rough but what it'll
[1:22:22] be it'll be to keep her from turning her
[1:22:24] hand they'll keep me to keep her from
[1:22:26] getting out of step
[1:22:28] hey man it's that call the message of
[1:22:31] the hour he said by the men do you
[1:22:32] believe the message how about I wouldn't
[1:22:34] have anything to preach without the
[1:22:35] message it's still the voice for the
[1:22:38] messenger crying out get back in line
[1:22:44] hallelujah well how do you know what if
[1:22:47] I say what he said I can say get back in
[1:22:49] line I
[1:22:51] know it's I know that that's what God's
[1:22:53] saying us what he wants to tell us
[1:22:54] listen God saved me for a purpose and
[1:22:56] I'm determined I skip forward a little
[1:22:59] bit he said he said he's already found
[1:23:01] grace to do with her she has found grace
[1:23:02] with him he engages to her and if
[1:23:04] there's anything you'll keep her for
[1:23:06] every place to turn her hand his grace
[1:23:07] is so great upon them and so will it be
[1:23:09] upon the bride so it is on the bride
[1:23:12] aren't you glad for his grace today we
[1:23:14] unworthy creatures deserving of hell but
[1:23:17] his grace holds us through it look at
[1:23:20] how many lost in mind how many sinners
[1:23:22] was there in the world the hour I got
[1:23:24] saved God saved me for a purpose and I'm
[1:23:26] determined by his will to do that
[1:23:29] purpose I
[1:23:31] don't care what anyone else goes I want
[1:23:34] to do it and in the hour when I see all
[1:23:37] the churches the great glamour and and
[1:23:39] have need of nothing they say and see
[1:23:41] the miserable wretched blind he said
[1:23:44] then now notice what they would do
[1:23:46] patting you on the shoulder wanting you
[1:23:49] to compromise with them he said I was
[1:23:52] born for a purpose
[1:23:54] hey men and you go back and listen to
[1:23:56] the message of great warrior David but
[1:23:58] the RAM talks about how David was called
[1:24:00] and elected in place
[1:24:02] hey man he had already been anointed to
[1:24:04] do what he did and so he could not fail
[1:24:07] hey Ben and brother man the speech to
[1:24:10] the people and tell them you already
[1:24:11] anointed to be healed you already in
[1:24:13] order to be sane you're already in order
[1:24:15] to do that you were called if you don't
[1:24:17] you weren't called you can't do it but
[1:24:19] you're called to do it aren't you glad
[1:24:21] for that tonight
[1:24:23] they want you to compromise let me said
[1:24:25] I was born for a purpose that's to
[1:24:27] condemn that thing and to call to call
[1:24:29] it out this I do
[1:24:31] amen he said notice there she is now
[1:24:34] she's loosed
[1:24:35] listen what she used to do
[1:24:38] to call all these little loose ends
[1:24:42] say Oh else don't make any difference
[1:24:45] anyhow listen to me Church if you don't
[1:24:48] hear anything else I said tonight the
[1:24:51] real danger it's not the coronavirus and
[1:24:54] it's not maybe the obvious even false
[1:24:58] doctrines and things but it's that
[1:25:00] Devils speaking in your ear trying to
[1:25:02] tell you it doesn't matter
[1:25:03] the loose ends doesn't matter the things
[1:25:07] that a prophet restored to us don't
[1:25:09] matter anymore
[1:25:12] but its life are you with me now
[1:25:17] without this message I don't have
[1:25:19] anything
[1:25:21] and he whispers in our area pat you on
[1:25:24] the shoulder and says compromise a
[1:25:26] little bit doesn't matter you don't have
[1:25:28] to go to church to be a Christian but a
[1:25:30] Christian goes to church
[1:25:32] you don't have to and I'm not trying to
[1:25:35] condemn you I realize some of some folks
[1:25:37] have been my family sitting at home
[1:25:40] tonight watching this so I know my
[1:25:42] personal I've had to sit home you know
[1:25:45] how many times I've sent home on a
[1:25:47] Wednesday night in my life I
[1:25:49] don't know of any time until last week
[1:25:54] like I said it's a real devil it's
[1:25:58] something we have to fight we've got to
[1:25:59] fight it we're gonna do everything we
[1:26:01] can to make sure it doesn't impact us
[1:26:03] we'll do everything we can to be careful
[1:26:05] in all these things but don't let the
[1:26:06] devil tell you that it don't make a
[1:26:07] difference
[1:26:09] it does make a difference when you can't
[1:26:11] come to the house of God it does make a
[1:26:14] difference when you can't just say
[1:26:15] you'll sit there on your ear and tell
[1:26:17] you it doesn't make a difference doesn't
[1:26:19] make a difference if you don't do things
[1:26:20] like well the parent said it don't make
[1:26:22] a difference if you don't do things like
[1:26:23] the word teaches you to do don't make a
[1:26:26] difference you just put that to the side
[1:26:29] just do it how you want to do it and it
[1:26:30] becomes will worship
[1:26:33] don't make any difference it's all right
[1:26:36] surely God is a good God He loves us all
[1:26:38] but the brown said he doesn't he's
[1:26:40] taking that from Scripture that he loved
[1:26:42] Jacob and hated Esau
[1:26:45] here's so much about it being a good God
[1:26:47] he is a good god but being good he has
[1:26:50] to be just there is no goodness without
[1:26:53] justice there is no justice without no
[1:26:56] law without punishment penalty you see
[1:26:58] what's happening today everybody's
[1:27:00] calling for justice social justice but
[1:27:03] there's no penalty no law and what
[1:27:06] happens people die because of it in the
[1:27:09] real world people die because of it you
[1:27:11] can't just set up your own zone and say
[1:27:13] well there's no law here no police here
[1:27:15] why people will die you can't do that
[1:27:18] spiritual either so Thrones don't say
[1:27:20] well we'll just live according to how we
[1:27:21] want to because nobody does it right
[1:27:23] anyway we'll just sit out by ourselves
[1:27:25] you can't do that there's no law there
[1:27:27] there's no penalty there our God is a
[1:27:30] God of justice where chickenhead he's
[1:27:32] also a God of mercy and His mercy
[1:27:34] providing a way of escape for us in this
[1:27:36] hour and that way of escape is the
[1:27:38] message of the hour
[1:27:43] because you won't escape it because you
[1:27:45] sympathize with it
[1:27:46] or because you just say well I believe
[1:27:48] it but bream said that you taught us
[1:27:51] that on the token you won't escape
[1:27:52] because you say I believe it but you got
[1:27:55] it come under it you
[1:27:56] got to receive the token for yourself
[1:28:02] David said to Saul
[1:28:04] look there had to be a response I'm
[1:28:08] closing with these thoughts
[1:28:10] Satan has my soft living made it easy to
[1:28:13] get in the habit of always doing the
[1:28:16] minimum
[1:28:18] just staying in the camp
[1:28:21] not responding to the challenge
[1:28:24] everybody just set back and looked at
[1:28:27] the other fellow and said well he's not
[1:28:28] doing nothing so I'll just sit back -
[1:28:32] you ever dealt with kids
[1:28:36] you kids get about 10 or 12 years old
[1:28:38] you know what they do when you tell them
[1:28:41] clean your room well Peter didn't clean
[1:28:43] his room
[1:28:46] preach at him tonight since they're not
[1:28:48] here
[1:28:49] Esther didn't clean her room why does it
[1:28:52] matter I feel like telling them like
[1:28:55] Jesus told the disciples what is that to
[1:28:57] you
[1:28:59] what if what if he don't clean his room
[1:29:02] til the Lord comes
[1:29:06] told you to clean yours but that's what
[1:29:09] kids do that's what they were doing down
[1:29:12] in the camp of Saul he didn't go Saul
[1:29:15] didn't go Dave his brothers didn't go so
[1:29:18] we're all just gonna sit back and watch
[1:29:19] for somebody else to do it and
[1:29:22] sit back and be critical because nobody
[1:29:24] else is doing it but David shows up and
[1:29:27] hears it and says hey
[1:29:29] he said let no man's heart fail because
[1:29:31] of him thy servant will go he wants to
[1:29:36] make it personal we'll make it personal
[1:29:38] hey Ben fight with this Philistine I
[1:29:41] will fight because I will win
[1:29:45] hey Ben he took his staff in his hand
[1:29:49] and chosen five smooth Stones out of the
[1:29:51] brook and put them in his Shepherds bag
[1:29:53] which he had in a script and the sling
[1:29:55] was in his hand and the Bible says he
[1:29:57] drew near to the Philistine your eyes he
[1:30:01] had to go down into the valley sometimes
[1:30:03] to defeat the enemy you got to go down
[1:30:04] into the valley you got to go down into
[1:30:07] the valley he went down into the valley
[1:30:09] he went down to the little Brook the
[1:30:11] ravine that was there picked up five
[1:30:13] smooth stones Kapaa on the other side
[1:30:15] you know Goliath you know they say
[1:30:16] something about Giants Giants have poor
[1:30:19] eyesight
[1:30:21] what they say I guess that's what
[1:30:23] happened to me but
[1:30:24] the same condition that causes someone
[1:30:27] to be a giant ouch also causes him to
[1:30:30] have poor eyesight and so what they do
[1:30:32] it I give you see Goliath looking over
[1:30:34] and he's trying to look at he can't even
[1:30:36] see David David has the element of
[1:30:39] surprise because that glass can't even
[1:30:42] see him the very thing that made him a
[1:30:44] giant he didn't have the ability to see
[1:30:46] but you and I can see he's an ordered
[1:30:49] our eyes to see
[1:30:50] David could see him he was big enough to
[1:30:52] look at he's big enough to see and so
[1:30:56] here he comes he comes to Korean across
[1:30:58] the ravine picks up the five smooth
[1:30:59] stones that jes us from the right have
[1:31:02] talked about the FAI th he picks it up
[1:31:04] and he comes up on the other side and he
[1:31:07] begins to he begins to speak to Goliath
[1:31:10] and glass they just get close enough to
[1:31:13] me and I'll show you who's boss
[1:31:17] and David came near but not near enough
[1:31:20] to her glass could kill him but what did
[1:31:23] he do he come near enough to be seen
[1:31:26] bad and he says today you're gonna
[1:31:30] you're gonna be defeated listen brother
[1:31:33] branham puts it this way he said the
[1:31:36] spirit quickens the word he said he's
[1:31:38] the powder that sends the bullets out
[1:31:40] there with it like it was the powder
[1:31:41] when David met Goliath with a slingshot
[1:31:43] with a rock in it he only had one place
[1:31:45] to hit that was right between the eyes
[1:31:46] the only place with his whole body that
[1:31:48] wasn't covered
[1:31:49] so what did David do aim for that spot
[1:31:52] makes it easy right you don't have to
[1:31:54] sit there wonder where to hit him at
[1:31:57] he's got one spot uncovered and that's
[1:31:59] the spot that'll kill him
[1:32:01] hey bet you only had one place to hit
[1:32:04] that was right between the eyes the rest
[1:32:05] it was armored but God got in that
[1:32:07] spirit he said what was it he had five
[1:32:09] stones and a slingshot look FAI th and j
[1:32:12] esus here he comes something's fixing to
[1:32:14] happen cuz there's the word the promise
[1:32:17] and the power to sing it he said that's
[1:32:19] what we need today is a man that will
[1:32:21] take God's word with the power of the
[1:32:23] Holy Ghost behind him to press it out
[1:32:25] there and watch it come to pass
[1:32:28] he said that's God's army his word of
[1:32:31] fires army it's all dressed with the
[1:32:33] other precedence of himself in there
[1:32:35] going with us you said well it's not
[1:32:38] important God don't use men anymore
[1:32:39] listen to brother Ram says he said I'll
[1:32:42] go with you being you not Jesus speak at
[1:32:44] the father that dwelleth in you he doeth
[1:32:46] the works in his army he presents his
[1:32:50] army in the form of five officers first
[1:32:52] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:32:54] evangelists he presents notice he
[1:32:56] presents what did glass do he presented
[1:32:59] himself
[1:33:00] but God said I'm gonna put my army on
[1:33:02] the offensive
[1:33:04] hey men where they present they men they
[1:33:08] present but there's an army behind them
[1:33:12] hey man the fivefold ministry is not all
[1:33:16] of the army there's an army behind them
[1:33:17] but they be presence his army that way
[1:33:20] see that that's the public face of it
[1:33:22] that's what they're there in the front
[1:33:24] there in the battle they're the ones
[1:33:26] most likely to get hit too by the way
[1:33:30] because they're in the battle they
[1:33:32] learned in the civil war to shoot for
[1:33:34] the for the noncommissioned officers
[1:33:36] because they're the ones that were in
[1:33:37] the battle and they were trying to defy
[1:33:40] defeat them shoot them to demoralize the
[1:33:43] enemy but the man had a requirement it
[1:33:46] was kind of silly it seems like but it
[1:33:47] was did something to the men what he had
[1:33:49] to do is stand there with a sword and
[1:33:51] they may be 100 yards or 200 yards from
[1:33:54] the enemy but he stood there with a
[1:33:56] sword and he stood there and waited and
[1:33:58] as soon as the enemy come close enough
[1:34:00] he said fire and he went up and down the
[1:34:03] the line and who actually ride a horse
[1:34:05] up and down the line and tell the men to
[1:34:07] keep firing keep fighting he wasn't
[1:34:09] fighting himself what's he doing
[1:34:11] encouraging them to fight that's what
[1:34:12] we're doing tonight I'm encourage you to
[1:34:15] get on the battle line I'm encouraging
[1:34:17] you don't run away now it's not the time
[1:34:20] to run now's the time to be right in the
[1:34:21] battle he said well I have to say ho
[1:34:23] right now be in the battle be in the
[1:34:26] battle be right there if you have to do
[1:34:28] it from your couch be there if you have

[1:34:36] him steal one hour of prayer from you

[1:34:40] into a time prayer let God move in your
[1:34:43] life be let let yourself become his army
[1:34:46] he said that's his army that's his
[1:34:48] soldiers that's his commanding officers
[1:34:50] Oh with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:52] waiting out there to meet the enemy on
[1:34:55] any grounds he comes upon to meet the
[1:34:58] enemy with the Word of God listen each
[1:35:00] one backing one another app
[1:35:05] but Allen did last Wednesday night
[1:35:07] that's what brother Stewart did Sunday
[1:35:09] morning each one backing one another up
[1:35:12] but it's more than that it's a worldwide
[1:35:15] bride we're not all of the bride if we
[1:35:17] are we got problems
[1:35:19] but there's a worldwide bride of Jesus
[1:35:21] Christ in each one backs the other up
[1:35:24] hey man each one backing one another up
[1:35:26] he said with him the chief captain not
[1:35:29] out there in front up here above her
[1:35:31] back behind but in them amen the chief
[1:35:34] captain is in them that's the army
[1:35:37] vindicating what vindicating his
[1:35:39] resurrection by the proof of his works
[1:35:42] jesus said he that believeth on me the
[1:35:44] works that I do shall he do also what is
[1:35:46] it it's God in the church in these five
[1:35:49] predestinated officers backing up every
[1:35:51] word that he has said with the Holy
[1:35:53] Spirit himself in there which is the
[1:35:55] word made manifest proving his
[1:35:57] resurrection proving that he's his you
[1:36:00] say well I've known a lot of men that
[1:36:01] failed don't you realize that's just a
[1:36:03] devil trying to get you to disbelieve
[1:36:05] one word of God's
[1:36:08] coming to you to talk tried to tell you
[1:36:10] it doesn't matter it does matter
[1:36:12] every little thing matters I'm not
[1:36:15] willing to cede one inch of ground I'm
[1:36:18] not willing to cede one inch of ground
[1:36:20] if God called for a church that would be
[1:36:22] a church with a hole in the center let's
[1:36:23] be a Holiness Church God called friends
[1:36:26] that there be a church with God with the
[1:36:28] power of God in it let's be a church
[1:36:29] with the power of God God called for
[1:36:32] morality and God calls for certain
[1:36:34] things in our lives let's live that way
[1:36:37] let's top-seed one inch of ground to
[1:36:39] there well it's a difficult time don't
[1:36:41] give in to the lie of the enemy
[1:36:43] don't give in to the challenge of the
[1:36:45] day well we're all the same we're all
[1:36:46] the same we
[1:36:48] all fight the same devil bore not all
[1:36:51] the same David was anointed to do
[1:36:53] differently means come
[1:36:57] we proved his resurrection we'd back one
[1:37:00] another up
[1:37:01] david's mighty men were known as giant
[1:37:03] killers why because david was a giant
[1:37:07] killer
[1:37:07] my jesus is a giant killer
[1:37:12] so if i got to follow him i couldn't
[1:37:14] follow anybody better yeah this preacher
[1:37:18] over here my fail that one over there my
[1:37:19] fail but thank god i'm not under any
[1:37:21] other headship but the headship of the
[1:37:24] word and the word never fails
[1:37:26] are you with me tonight the word don't
[1:37:28] fail if i was under that man and that
[1:37:31] man falls where does that put me if I'm
[1:37:33] under the word the word don't fail if
[1:37:36] you're under me and I feel and I might
[1:37:39] fail at some point I might fail god
[1:37:41] forbid that I would ever fail but
[1:37:43] there'll be times when I may be what
[1:37:45] makes the wrong decision but you don't
[1:37:46] have to why because you can you can even
[1:37:50] make a better decision than your pastor
[1:37:52] does
[1:37:52] sure there'd be times where you do why
[1:37:55] because you're under headship you're
[1:37:58] under different headship we all go over
[1:37:59] the same rule book brother man who says
[1:38:01] if you don't fight according to the
[1:38:02] rules play the game according the rules
[1:38:04] you can't win you get to the end to be
[1:38:06] disapproved but we play the game
[1:38:07] according to the rules it's not up to me
[1:38:09] God already has put him on a messenger
[1:38:11] in this age God already proved it by the
[1:38:13] pillar of fire God proved it by the Son
[1:38:15] of man appearing among us then we have
[1:38:17] to stand here and fight behind him
[1:38:19] behind him our chief captain the Word of
[1:38:22] God
[1:38:22] amen do you believe it tonight you were
[1:38:25] predestined to meet the challenge David
[1:38:28] was selected called an anointed to do
[1:38:30] the job brother man said then if you
[1:38:32] were a son of God or daughter of God you
[1:38:34] were in God all the time but he knew
[1:38:36] what meant in time that you'd be planted
[1:38:37] so now you made a creature a son of God
[1:38:39] manifested son or daughter of God to
[1:38:42] meet the challenge of this hour to
[1:38:45] vindicate the true and living God of
[1:38:46] this hour the message that's coming
[1:38:47] forth and this time
[1:38:51] those are men on the beaches of Normandy
[1:38:54] their response to that challenge would
[1:38:55] define the rest of their lives they
