[24:26] to give us things because god desires to
[24:28] have a prosperous journey amen we're
[24:31] we're here to be witnesses of his
[24:33] goodness
[24:34] amen we were born to serve him and live
[24:36] for him
[24:39] amen so here
[24:40] the scripture that we read so here the
[24:42] jeremiah the prophet was commanded by
[24:45] god to stand at the gate of the city and
[24:48] ask the question is there no bomb
[24:51] is there no position
[24:53] why he asked the question why is the
[24:55] health of my people not recovered
[24:59] but it wasn't that god hadn't provided
[25:02] it because god has always provided for
[25:04] the needs of his people god has always
[25:07] given the best to his people
[25:09] but here the prophet standing at the
[25:12] gate of the city there amen trying to
[25:14] bring attention to the people of what
[25:16] god had given them and then trying to
[25:19] stir up their minds
[25:21] amen as peter said by way of remembrance
[25:24] to try to stir up their pure minds to
[25:26] awaken them
[25:27] amen to to awaken their minds to what
[25:30] god had given them to what god had
[25:32] provided
[25:34] and then the bible says that if
[25:36] if my people who are called by my name
[25:39] will humble themselves and pray and turn
[25:41] from their wicked way i will hear from
[25:43] heaven and i will heal their land
[25:46] amen so there is a healing for the
[25:48] people of god
[25:49] god has provided it
[25:51] we must humble ourselves in his presence
[25:55] in in the message balm and gilead
[25:58] brother branham says here he says the
[25:59] word why god asks that question and when
[26:03] god has made a way for people to escape
[26:05] danger to escape sickness or troubles or
[26:08] disasters provides a way of escape and
[26:11] the people turn it down refuse it then
[26:13] god asks why
[26:15] why what's the reason that you don't
[26:17] accept it
[26:19] amen and god god has always provided for
[26:23] his people amen whatever the need would
[26:25] be he gives him the very best he said in
[26:28] his word i am the lord that healeth thee
[26:30] from all thy diseases and all thy
[26:32] sicknesses i'm the god that delivers you
[26:35] from all your troubles amen and tonight
[26:37] this this evening he alone
[26:40] he alone is able amen to redeem us from
[26:42] the hand of the enemy and then he
[26:44] provides his the very best he provides a
[26:46] way of escape for his people amen but if
[26:49] we if we reject and refuse it that's not
[26:51] on him that's on us
[26:54] amen so he has provided a way of
[26:56] escaping this hour and his word and his
[26:59] grace always provides the very best
[27:02] everything that we would have need need
[27:04] of
[27:06] being his people amen in this salary
[27:08] think of what he's given us he's given
[27:10] us the greatest message that's ever
[27:12] struck the face of the earth and then
[27:13] he's brought to our attention amen that
[27:16] we are the bride amen he's brought to
[27:18] our attention that we are to be caught
[27:20] up in the rapture amen and not only that
[27:22] but he provides to us rapturing grace he
[27:26] provides to us rapturing power he
[27:28] doesn't he doesn't point us to something
[27:30] without giving us and then the power and
[27:32] that that which inside of us that which
[27:34] we would need he provides the faith he
[27:36] provides the power he provides that we
[27:39] which we would have needed to be
[27:40] raptured
[27:41] and to take a body change
[27:45] aren't you thankful for that now aren't
[27:46] you thankful for the message aren't you
[27:48] thankful for what god has provided for
[27:50] us in this hour but we as his people we
[27:52] must humble ourselves under his mighty
[27:55] hand
[27:56] amen but to refuse to reject and to
[27:59] refuse amen to serve the living god
[28:02] in this hour you would have to accept
[28:04] something false
[28:06] right
[28:07] and then there would have to be
[28:08] something else that would take that
[28:10] place because god creates in man a
[28:13] thirst
[28:14] god creates them in manna thirst to
[28:17] worship him and then to desire him and
[28:20] that thirst can never be quenched by
[28:22] false religion and the pleasures of sin
[28:24] amen those things will never bring
[28:27] healing in your life amen by god in this
[28:29] hour amen to you and i this evening he
[28:31] offers faith he offers peace he offers
[28:34] joy in the holy ghost fullness of joy
[28:37] god offers that
[28:39] amen the world can never give you that
[28:41] but god offers it to you and i am only
[28:44] the spirit of god can give you eternal
[28:46] peace and satisfaction and he alone amen
[28:50] can fulfill that desire and need we
[28:52] would have that which he placed in us
[28:54] only he himself can fulfill that the
[28:58] world will never satisfy that hunger
[29:01] though we would try though there would
[29:02] be some false religion false god it can
[29:05] never satisfy can never bring that peace
[29:07] that god can give you
[29:10] oh accept him in this hour
[29:12] amen don't refuse him don't refuse the
[29:15] cure don't re don't refuse the bomb
[29:17] don't refuse the physician the medicine
[29:19] that he's given in this hour the message
[29:21] is bomb and many sentences very best
[29:26] amen
[29:28] and just as jeremiah appointed the
[29:30] people
[29:31] to god and the and the one god who could
[29:33] bring healing a prophet in this day
[29:36] has pointed us to a living god
[29:38] to a living christ
[29:40] not some some relic
[29:43] amen not some empty relic
[29:45] amen we're not looking to an empty tomb
[29:47] tonight we're not i'm well we are
[29:49] looking to an empty tomb we're not
[29:50] looking to a dead god tonight we're
[29:52] looking to a god that they come out of
[29:55] the tomb we're looking to a god that's a
[29:56] living god
[29:58] we are looking to an empty tomb
[30:00] but even in that
[30:02] you could go to the very tomb where
[30:04] jesus was at
[30:05] you could go to that very place and
[30:07] there would be no virtue in it
[30:10] amen you could go
[30:12] you could go to sunset mountain
[30:14] you could go to all these places and we
[30:16] know what god did there we know what god
[30:19] did there but there's no virtue in that
[30:22] brother branham didn't point us back to
[30:24] those places though god though they
[30:26] would be special to us
[30:27] though those important things happened
[30:29] there amen but the god amen that that
[30:32] was there amen the god that was on the
[30:35] mountain the god that was in the tomb
[30:36] that come out of the tomb that god must
[30:38] live in you amen that god that that same
[30:41] power must be in you and i that living
[30:44] god must be in the midst of the church
[30:46] tonight he must be in our services it
[30:48] can't be some dead false religion amen
[30:50] but it's got to be life-giving it's got
[30:52] to be life-flowing
[30:55] amen so the prophet of the hour didn't
[30:57] point us to something that couldn't heal
[30:59] us some empty relic but he pointed us to
[31:01] a living god he pointed us to the god
[31:03] that could open the word in this hour
[31:05] they could open the seals and then they
[31:08] could give you an identification of who
[31:09] you are of who he is what his will is
[31:14] amen to he he he's given us his very
[31:16] best
[31:18] i feel like moses and the stuttering
[31:20] problem sometime
[31:25] we all got our problems don't we
[31:27] that water don't fall over
[31:30] amen god has given us his very best
[31:33] i believe that in this hour
[31:37] amen the prophet jeremiah wasn't
[31:40] he wasn't pointing the people to himself
[31:43] but he was he was pointing them to a
[31:44] bomb to the physician
[31:46] and the prophet in this hour didn't
[31:48] point us to himself he didn't point us
[31:49] to an empty relic but he pointed us to a
[31:52] god someone that could bring complete
[31:53] healing
[31:54] in our hearts and lives
[31:57] first timothy 3 16.
[32:00] without controversy great is the mystery
[32:02] of godliness for god was manifested in
[32:05] the flesh
[32:06] scene of angels preached on in the world
[32:09] believed on in the world and received up
[32:11] in the glory and brother branham says
[32:14] here he said god himself so now jesus
[32:17] was god's manifestation of his own being
[32:19] on earth unfolding himself into a human
[32:22] being
[32:23] to take away sin and to make a way for
[32:26] sickness to be healed
[32:28] and he said and if there is no divine
[32:30] healing there is no resurrection of the
[32:32] dead it is the earnest of your
[32:34] resurrection do you believe that tonight
[32:36] and then jesus was god's manifestation
[32:39] of his own being on earth and if there
[32:41] is no divine healing there's no healing
[32:44] for the people of god then there's no
[32:45] resurrection of these bodies
[32:48] right so healing if you believe in the
[32:50] resurrection there's healing for your
[32:51] body here tonight there's healing
[32:53] there's divine healing and divine
[32:55] healing is the very down payment
[32:57] if you've ever been healed if you've
[32:59] ever received healing it's a very down
[33:01] payment it's the earnest that god will
[33:04] resurrect these bodies that god will
[33:06] change these bodies you can get sick and
[33:08] you can get healed and you can get sick
[33:10] and you can get healed again but there's
[33:12] coming and then there's coming amen a
[33:14] complete healing of these bodies or
[33:16] we'll never be sick again amen but the
[33:18] healing that god provides it's only a
[33:20] shadow it's an earnest of what is coming
[33:24] divine healing is a down payment that we
[33:26] will be raised up one day that we will
[33:28] have a new body one like unto his own
[33:31] glorious body
[33:34] and jesus
[33:36] being the manifestation of god what he
[33:39] came in flesh to do what to make a way
[33:42] to make a way for you and i that we
[33:43] could be healed
[33:45] amen to take away sin to take away
[33:47] sickness jesus came
[33:49] god manifested himself in flesh to take
[33:52] that away for you and i
[33:54] amen so we got the down payment
[33:57] we've got the word
[33:59] we've got the down payment we've got the
[34:00] spirit of god and then the word it says
[34:02] he was wounded for my transgressions you
[34:04] got the down payment tonight
[34:06] and then you you've got you've got the
[34:08] earnest money to get what you have need
[34:10] of tonight and then go back to the word
[34:12] amen he was wounded for my
[34:14] transgressions he was bruised for my
[34:15] iniquity and then by stripes i'm here
[34:18] we've got the down payment tonight amen
[34:21] have faith tonight that healing is yours
[34:23] amen whether whether it be for your soul
[34:25] or your body your mind whatever it would
[34:27] be and then in my spirit we have the
[34:29] earnest of the body change
[34:32] amen if you have the earnest have you
[34:33] had that holy ghost within you tonight
[34:36] amen you have turned heavenward
[34:39] amen you're no longer subject to the
[34:41] world but you're subject to the word and
[34:44] if you're subject to the word you're
[34:45] beneficiary tonight you're subject to
[34:47] the power you're subject to that that
[34:49] word being manifest in you you have that
[34:52] earnest and then you have turned
[34:53] heavenward
[34:56] amen you have the earnest of the rapture
[34:58] in you tonight
[35:00] by the holy ghost
[35:03] amen and brother branham says here
[35:06] he says in baum and gillian he said
[35:08] there is a bomb in jesus tonight
[35:10] in the name of jesus christ there is a
[35:12] bomb whatever you ask the father in my
[35:14] my name that i'll do he said there's a
[35:17] balm in gilead in my name they shall
[35:19] cast out evil spirits they'll lay their
[35:21] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[35:23] he said there's a bomb in gilead if you
[35:25] cannot get rid of your drinking of your
[35:27] gambling and that evil spirit that's
[35:29] making you
[35:30] and then there's a deliverance for the
[35:32] people of god here this morning we have
[35:34] been commissioned to cast out devils and
[35:37] lay hands on the sick and what's the
[35:38] bible say and they shall recover
[35:41] amen we've been commissioned ain't meant
[35:43] to cast satan out we've been
[35:45] commissioned to cast him out of our
[35:47] homes out of the lives of our family
[35:50] we've been we've been commissioned as
[35:52] the church of god and god is here to
[35:54] back up that commission amen we've been
[35:57] commissioned to lay hands on the sick
[35:59] those that would be feeble those that
[36:01] will be near death we've been
[36:02] commissioned amen by almighty god we've
[36:05] been given the power
[36:06] amen and jesus has given us the power
[36:08] but you've got to have the faith you've
[36:10] got to have the faith you've got to have
[36:12] the man of faith the holy ghost inside
[36:14] you to make it operate amen but i
[36:17] believe we've got that man among us
[36:18] tonight i believe we've got him in our
[36:20] midst and our hearts amen if we want to
[36:22] operate the word god has commissioned us
[36:25] and god is here to honor that commission
[36:27] god has to honor his word
[36:31] he's here to back it up
[36:33] we don't have to be bound by sickness
[36:34] you don't have to live in your condition
[36:36] but god wants to raise you up church
[36:39] amen we don't have to be bound by sin
[36:40] sickness by unbelief by the spirit of
[36:43] the day by the spirit of laodicea amen
[36:45] but god has made a way to where we don't
[36:47] have to be bound
[36:50] amen
[36:52] you can be free we can be free there's a
[36:55] bomb amen for our sickness there's a
[36:58] bomb for everything that we would have
[36:59] need of amen in the sun the sun has made
[37:02] us free jesus was manifested in the
[37:04] flesh god was manifested in the flesh to
[37:06] come and make us free amen this comes to
[37:09] you tonight without money there's
[37:11] nothing that you could do to ever
[37:12] purchase it there's nothing you could
[37:14] ever do to merit it but it came without
[37:16] money it came without price it's free to
[37:18] you it's grace to you
[37:21] amen but you've got to believe it and
[37:22] accept it as for you
[37:25] amen and whom the son is made free is
[37:26] free and he's able to make you free from
[37:28] the dominion of sin and unbelief in this
[37:31] hour that you can have faith
[37:33] that you can have faith in what god has
[37:35] promised you
[37:36] i mean he's given us this his word in
[37:38] this hour
[37:40] amen
[37:42] so there's a bomb
[37:43] amen and god is our physician
[37:46] amen brother brenham said there's an
[37:48] inoculation
[37:49] this word inoculation i believe that
[37:51] there's an inoculation that has been
[37:53] provided in this hour
[37:55] and that word inoculation
[37:58] it says the action
[38:00] of immunizing someone against the
[38:02] disease by introducing infective
[38:04] material
[38:06] microorganisms or vaccine into the body
[38:10] amen so when we become inoculated or
[38:12] vaccinated and i don't care tonight
[38:14] whether you've been vaccinated you want
[38:17] to you don't want to you want to wear a
[38:18] mask you don't want to wear masks i
[38:20] don't care
[38:22] but i just thought these things were
[38:23] interesting that it lays in the message
[38:26] i just want to pick up on this thought
[38:28] for just a little bit
[38:31] so there's an inoculation
[38:33] so when we become inoculated or
[38:36] vaccinated
[38:38] a portion of that sickness
[38:40] is introduced into your bloodstream
[38:43] and it exposes you to that sickness just
[38:45] enough so your body will build a certain
[38:48] immunity to that and potentially fight
[38:51] off that certain disease that virus or
[38:53] that sickness and then we understand
[38:55] these things
[38:57] the brother random says here he said now
[38:59] medicine has to be tested
[39:01] and i thought this was interesting and
[39:03] again i don't care one way or the other
[39:05] i thought about getting it myself and
[39:07] you think not but it's just a personal
[39:10] choice
[39:12] so i'm not preaching against it or for
[39:14] it okay so you just i'm going to read
[39:16] this quote though and i thought it was
[39:17] so interesting he said first they find a
[39:19] toxin
[39:20] and that they think for that's for some
[39:22] ailment
[39:23] he said they tried on guinea pigs
[39:26] and they take the toxin after the
[39:28] science has worked on it for a long time
[39:30] and they shoot it into a little guinea
[39:32] pig and they watch his reaction and if
[39:34] it doesn't hurt the little guinea pig
[39:36] then they use it on human beings he said
[39:38] but medicine is a chance to take for
[39:40] some medicines it will help one human
[39:42] being but but it might kill another we
[39:46] understand these things that's nothing
[39:48] nothing new it might have been in that
[39:49] day
[39:50] but we understand these things one
[39:52] person could take something and it might
[39:54] not be good for somebody else
[39:57] amen so he said so you have to watch
[39:59] that he said because that sometimes you
[40:01] must be sure to know what you are doing
[40:04] and let the doctor that knows how to
[40:05] give it give it to you someone that you
[40:07] got confidence in and so so when man
[40:11] makes a medicine it can help some
[40:13] but might kill somebody else
[40:16] our bodies are different
[40:18] and we all have we we all have different
[40:20] types of reactions amen to the same
[40:22] medicine we can have different types of
[40:24] reactions and he said if you take
[40:26] something you need to have confidence
[40:28] that it will work and then it's been
[40:29] tested
[40:30] and even though even though something
[40:33] would have been tested because it's
[40:34] man-made it will never be 100 effective
[40:38] it won't work every single time amen but
[40:40] i believe tonight i believe god has
[40:42] provided an inoculation amen it is the
[40:45] ultimate remedy it's something that i
[40:47] can have full confidence in
[40:50] i mean if you're going gonna take
[40:51] something have faith in it have
[40:52] confidence in it it's 100 percent
[40:55] effective to you and i tonight that
[40:57] which god has provided there's no 99.999
[41:01] chance amen but it's 100
[41:05] amen it's 100 percent
[41:07] what god has given us in this hour
[41:11] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[41:13] the life i've got confidence in that
[41:15] i've got confidence and not in the shed
[41:17] blood of the lamb of god i've got
[41:20] confidence in the life-giving flow amen
[41:22] i believe tonight that there's power in
[41:24] the blood there's power in that
[41:26] inoculation of that life if you'll let
[41:28] it come into you there ain't no 99
[41:31] chance but it's 100
[41:33] effective it's the ultimate
[41:35] what god provided us
[41:38] it's a very creative blood of god
[41:42] amen to take away sin
[41:44] to take away sickness to take away doubt
[41:47] it's the ultimate cure
[41:49] for you and i that's what god has
[41:50] provided us that's the balm that he
[41:53] provided us
[41:56] you love the lord tonight
[41:58] it's the very creative blood of god
[42:02] brother branham says here and do you now
[42:04] believe
[42:09] he says all right
[42:11] come sir do you now believe everybody
[42:13] believe
[42:14] do you love him with all your heart do
[42:16] you believe me to be god's prophet
[42:18] i'm just a man but he's just using this
[42:21] way i see something in a bottle
[42:23] it's blood
[42:24] so this man's in a prayer line here
[42:27] he said there's one two three 4 5 6 7 8
[42:30] 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 bottles of
[42:34] blood
[42:35] it said you've had 17 blood transfusions
[42:38] your anemia is that right and you come
[42:41] from another country arkansas
[42:43] i mean we're from another country
[42:45] you didn't know that did you
[42:47] amen we're just we're we're different
[42:49] than everybody else you come from
[42:51] another country arkansas is that right

[45:15] what the matter with the church is

[47:30] that god's provided it will change your
[47:32] life
[47:33] it's been tested it's been time tested
[47:36] and this medicine is unlike anything the
[47:38] world can give but is the inoculation
[47:41] from heaven the holy ghost in fire
[47:44] and it will burn every bit of disease
[47:46] every desire for sin out of a man's
[47:49] heart
[47:51] amen
[47:54] amen brother branham says here he said
[47:55] now when doctors investigate medicine
[47:57] for their patients it's tried by a
[47:59] guinea pig but when god wanted to give a
[48:01] test for the human race he never
[48:03] inoculated a guinea pig he inoculated
[48:05] his son the lord jesus took the toxin of
[48:08] god's holy spirit and his action on
[48:10] earth proves what it was
[48:12] when they spit on him he prayed for
[48:14] their forgiveness when he was riled upon
[48:17] he rowed not back
[48:18] it showed that the toxin held when they
[48:22] killed him and he died on the cross
[48:23] bleeding and bleeding he was praying for
[48:26] their forgiveness the toxin kept good
[48:28] then finally a roman spear embalmed his
[48:30] body by smashing into his heart and
[48:33] blood and water poured out they said now
[48:35] it's gone he's give up the spirit
[48:38] his brother said the earth shook he died
[48:40] until the sun would quit shining he died
[48:43] until the stars refused to shine he died
[48:45] until the earth was so black you could
[48:47] feel it he died and went to the lowest
[48:49] regions of hell bearing our sins
[48:52] i'm going to keep reading this you could
[48:54] go you could not go deeper in hell than
[48:56] what he went
[48:57] you could not suffer harder than he
[48:59] suffered you could not die any harder
[49:02] than he died but brother on that first
[49:04] easter morning the toxin went to work it
[49:06] broke the seals of death it smashed the
[49:09] devil in the face and it rolled the
[49:11] stone and the son of the living god
[49:13] lived again he's alive forevermore the
[49:15] toxin work and god put it on his own son
[49:19] not someone else but god came himself in
[49:22] his own son to prove it that it would
[49:24] work and god was made flesh and dwelt
[49:26] among us that's how god was in christ
[49:29] god come and took the toxin himself in a
[49:32] human body that he created himself the
[49:34] son of god and he lived in that and he
[49:36] took the toxin
[49:38] and it proved that it held
[49:40] amen and i believe it if it worked for
[49:42] him it'll work for you and i it'll do
[49:44] the same for you and you and i if you'll
[49:46] take it if you won't refuse it but if
[49:48] you'll take it it'll do the same thing
[49:50] and you talk about conditions
[49:52] brother brahma said nobody could die
[49:54] harder than he died nobody could have
[49:56] sinned lower than he ascended into hell
[49:59] and think about those symptoms think
[50:00] about those conditions yet it held it
[50:02] brought him out of those conditions
[50:05] amen in the hour of temptation it held
[50:08] amen
[50:10] in the hour of persecution it held
[50:12] in the face of persecution it held in
[50:15] the face of death and hell the toxin
[50:16] worked amen it broke the seal of death
[50:19] itself
[50:20] amen it rolled that very stone back
[50:23] that toxin that power that quickening
[50:25] life
[50:26] the same quickening power that comes in
[50:28] you and i that same inoculation amen
[50:30] jesus was inoculated that with that with
[50:33] by himself
[50:34] he received the same thing
[50:36] that same quickening power
[50:38] is in you and i by the holy ghost
[50:42] it'll keep you it'll hold you
[50:44] i don't know how long i've been
[50:45] preaching

[52:10] mercy to get it and tonight if there was
[52:12] such a pill in a physical form material
[52:14] form it could be given
[52:16] he said but i'm telling you tonight
