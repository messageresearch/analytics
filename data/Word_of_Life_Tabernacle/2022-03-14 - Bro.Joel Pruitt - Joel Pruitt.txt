invite brother joel out in just a moment and as he prepares to come we know we serve an awesome god you know god can use anybody he wants to use to speak he can move in mysterious ways the bible says he does move in mysterious ways i never thought my brother would be a preacher and i sure wouldn't put him out here and we've got these other ministers that come and these others in the church wonderful men of god but look at that if god can use a donkey god can use joel [Music] right my god is awesome so glad my brother he's taking a real stand been a big help to me here in the church and so we're we're glad to have him you just get behind him you know somebody's got to give somebody had to give me an opportunity to start out and jt was instrumental in that and started years ago and others that helped me start out and so we want to get behind the word of god and just really pull tonight and believe that god's got something to speak to us he can speak when he decides to speak he can speak who lives and play amen my god [Music] when i'm broken [Music] yes [Music] we believe that let's stand together this evening brother joel come down let's sing it together oh today i am

[Music] don't you thankful for an awesome god amen he's still god amen he never changes and he's always here for us that'll be all the music thank you for that amen it's good to be in the house of the lord when he started talking about a donkey i almost come out right then i can't get too mad at him i get on him pretty good so i guess that's he probably owed that to me and if you could take your bibles and we could turn turn with me to romans chapter four let's start with verse 19. i mean god been good to you today i'll try not to hold you long i know that's probably a lie but i'll try not to my last name is pruitt so it comes natural but i try my best to let you out early today 4 19 and he says this and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to also perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also and i would like to think about that for just a moment if you would for us also it was imputed not just to abraham but to his seed and now was not written for his sake alone but also us now he says but for us also who believe if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification and over in if you would in second corinthians chapter 6 verses 7 through 10 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things how many possessors do we have here tonight amen as abraham see we possess all things and you may be seated may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word we'll read one more here genesis chapter 14. if you've got that he's talking about melchizedek here king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and that word possess and possessing there is a present tense having and holding by an absolute right an absolute right or title occupying and enjoying think about that to occupy and to enjoy your inheritance and tonight if we could just speak for just a moment i would like to speak on the possessing all promises because we as seed of abraham as a spiritual seed of abraham as a royal seed we possess things that maybe we take for granted maybe we don't understand we we live so far below our privileges here that we don't see and we don't understand maybe just how important we are spiritually speaking and is the promise that we receive the seal of the promise is the baptism of the holy ghost for that is god in the form of spirit you being his word or he he being the word in you then he comes in if you receive the word in you that holy spirit is the only thing that can make that live the word live in you the promise in you and we possess the gate of every enemy the devil and all of his tactics we possess that we can overcome that by what the word and so we see here that god promised it and it is so and you can only do it then after being tested by the word remember abraham was tested by the word and if we being his seed we will also be tested by the word and but the faith of abraham remember it actually was stronger at the end of the 25 years than at the beginning of the 25 years why because he he became stronger and stronger in faith and i believe tonight that the seed of abraham will be the same way no matter how long it takes to get what we want from god we we will become stronger in our faith and i believe that's the way it is tonight the true believer is cast out from among the people sometimes we're called fanatics and holy rollers and so forth but the meek shall inherit the earth is that right you being the meek now it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor by some standard you are meek and spirit maybe but the meeks shall inherit the earth and even the poorest christian in here the poorest the poorest person in in the natural sense if you look out here the earth you step on is your possession everything has been given to you and it doesn't matter necessarily what you drive or what you wear but it does matter if you possessed christ because once you take on christ you become the seed of abraham at that time and that is what we all must come into as a believer is to not stand back here and live so far below our privileges and say that we don't have anything or we can't possess anything but healing is yours it is the children's bread the seed of abraham could possess all things and why is that why do we why do we live so low is because we really don't know who we are and once you know who you are the seed of abraham then there's no trouble there to possess these things and we go on down it doesn't matter maybe you don't have the money to pay your rent next month and maybe you don't have the money to put shoes on your children's feet it doesn't matter really on that regard because you're still the seed of abraham you still have everything you need in christ and the meeks shall inherit the believer has a title abstract deed that's right by jesus christ he shall be the possessor of his entire universe brother branham said he was the he was the possessor of the entire universe think about that everything you think about this whole earth this whole universe the whole galaxy everything here is actually ours the people that have it now we see that satan is ruling this whole universe and everything is being run over by sin and discourse but you and i are the true possessors of all of it we go on here and how do you get how do you get the possession of this it's not something you necessarily do other than obey the word but it is an unmerited gift that god has given us and we say here everything is ours everything that we see is ours and satan will try to bluff you a little bit but you just say satan that's mine stay back possess it take it back from the devil it's yours anyway and you have a legal right to every blessing that god has ever had and if there was ever a blessing given to abraham you think about it he was giving it to his abraham walked out there and everything to the west and the east to the north and south and everything he could see every every bit of land he could see he said abraham it's all yours and your seed the scriptures here tell us it's not just imputed abraham but to you also and that's what paul was teaching us here and when brother branham came to came down here and he and he spoke on the earth and he was staying he was saying he was trying to show the people that the same god of abraham the same god of isaac was the same god of you and i because god doesn't change and his word don't change and when we walk on down through the scriptures here we realize that everything no matter how good you think you are you may not possess what you think you do or how bad you think you are maybe you possess more than you think you do and we get so carnal minded and we think about it in such a way that we miss the spiritual blessings of god because we think about it well maybe you wouldn't took a dna test and abraham wasn't there but you're still a son or daughter of abraham he's still your father just because you don't find it in the natural remember this is a spiritual seed in christ in christ is when you take on abraham's seed and that's when you can possess all things everything that we have need of can be possessed by the believer remember it is to occupy to enjoy we can have peace all these things are ours every bit of it and now if we get if we don't just get what we ask for spontaneously then sometimes our faith weakens that wasn't abraham abraham was not that way so i think maybe if we could just stop you know we pray for something and maybe god didn't say yes right away and we get scared maybe god is wanting to test your faith just a little bit maybe he does want you to have it but maybe he doesn't want you to have it right that minute just to see if you'll hold on just a little longer i remember praying and asking the lord you know if there was anything i could do and it took years before i ever actually heard back anything that was any substantial voice that i actually heard and i was sitting there and you know what my faith did weaken i wanted something i could touch or feel i wanted an emotion to come on me it's not always the emotion it's sometimes it's a still small voice and we miss it because we get so caught up in the things of the world we get so caught up in our daily lives that we miss the still small voice of god that tries to tell you what's yours and it's all right here in the bible if you just read it because everything that we need is a possession and every possession we need is ours it is ours god made a covenant with abraham and that covenant in that covenant he made with abraham remember he wasn't just making a covenant with abraham but his seed also it wasn't just isaac but in christ will thy seed be called in christ so once you take on the seed of christ you are an heir of all the spiritual blessings of god and so that's the thing right there if you don't ever come to christ if you don't ever accept what he's already done for you then sure you're not going to feel the blessings of god you're not going to feel anything good from god maybe you'll never experience the blessings of god in any way because you didn't take on the seed of god by accepting christ remember this is all free this is not something you have to buy this is not something you have to go out and seek necessarily because god already sought you out and then he put a desire in your heart so you could seek him and at that point then when you return to god and you say i i feel you and i know you're pulling in my heart strings then at that point then god has already done something in you it wasn't you saying i'm gonna go find god because i'm not good no god already sought you out and put that desire there before you had anything to do with it so it's all free the desire you have to be in church is from god the desire you have to do anything for the lord that is the desire from god and god put it there but remember satan will come in there and try to kill that joy he will try to kill that that that promise from you he'll try to make you think you're not good enough for the promise he'll try to make you think you're some little person and you're sitting in a small church in hardy arkansas and i'm not good enough or i'm not the biggest church of the message but i tell you right now you are still the royal seat of abraham you still have a place in god's economy no matter how little you are you say well my ministry's not this and it's not on this level maybe i don't have the voice to be this preacher or that preacher but you're still used of god because why god didn't say that everybody would be abraham and everybody be christ but in that sea line there will come forth a bride and there will be sons and daughters in that seed line there and that's where we need to come to when we think about these promises what promises are ours mark 16 and 17 he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with tongues they shall do these things why that is the promise acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall that's a promise you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that is a promise to you and to your children that's still a promise no matter how bad it looks and how far your children are away from you god is still god and his promises are still true regardless if you think about it that way god won't lose one of his every promise is still yours every promise in this bible is still absolutely the truth god doesn't take away a promise and god doesn't take he's not an indian giver he doesn't give you something and give something to abraham and give something to isaac and then well you're the same seed but i've taken it from you i've taken your inheritance no it's still your inheritance when the prodigal son left he was still a son just because he strayed didn't make him any less of a son and i say tonight if you strayed if you fell apart and your life looks like it's in ruins you're still a son or daughter of god has nothing to do with the circumstances abraham looked at the circumstances it would have told him to quit believing but because he quit looking at the circumstances and he saw that god was still god and he believed anyway and his seed will do the same thing i'll tell you sometimes in my life i thought i was so far gone i thought i couldn't be saved i thought maybe i'd went too far i'd crossed the line but there was something on the inside that said come back home and when i responded to that call i knew there was still something in me i knew i was still seen because god is not just a god afar off but he's a god right here and he'll speak to you sometimes in ways that you don't think he'll speak to you he might use a donkey to speak to you but god will still speak god is still god his seed is still his seed everything god placed in the church every promise that he ever placed in the church is still active tonight it's still a true promise of god when we come in when the satan comes in like a flood god will raise up a standard what is the standard we are the standard he'll raise up think about we are that seed of abraham they come right on down through christ and then christ into the church christ in you and now you through christ are the standard for the age and when you think about it in that way then we think we don't nothing satan can come against us but in that way we are more than able to withstand every gate of every enemy any time any place satan may come at you he may tell you this he may say you know what you have no talents you are no good and you're not going to help the church you might as well stay home you might as well do whatever you want to do but if god has placed you in a body stay there and stay faithful to it and do what you can for god and if you really have that call of god in your life god won't even let you sit at home because listen brother branham says it like this if god is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open so it's not you going to church it's not you dragging yourself to church it's god taking you to church think about it like this if you knew god was going to church with you every sunday would you go he is he is the very desire that makes you go he's the very desire in your heart that makes you love somebody that love is not just an emotion it is a desire and these things this possession that we have is not just a story but it is an actual fact it is something you can actually have and this is something that when you come down and you look at and you look through the ages and you see what god did to the church and you see what he did to abraham there and how he blessed him but you think about it that's a good story and it's true and it really happened but it's you too god has spoken to every one of you that you are the royal seed of abraham you are blessed among all the peoples of the earth you are that royal scene when you're sick think about it god has already provided a sacrifice just like he did for abraham the same god the same way he's already got a ram and the thicket for you because when somebody's in the hospital on their deathbed and you think well that's just the end of it no that's just the beginning of it god can god can in the instant like that provide a ram and you can be like you see these healings take place and you see surgeries that maybe a person should die and they come through them and they actually survive these things and why because god has a purpose for these things god has a reason behind it nothing happens by chance but to the royal seat of abraham god has already seen what he's done for one and everything that he did for abraham he's still going to do for you right here tonight i believe that we we sometimes healing passes by because we think we're not worthy of it but i i'll tell you tonight it's not your worthiness anyway but it's god himself that come down and gave you an abstract deed and i'll tell you what if god if somebody gave me a title to a vehicle and they said it's yours and they signed their name on it i'm going to go take it down i'm going to register it i'm going to claim it is mine and i'll tell you tonight when god came down and he gave you an abstract deed and he said it's all yours every promise in the book is yours everything you have need of every child that you have is not going to be lost every brother and sister that's out there in the world they're not going to be lost everyone that looks like it but if you have the faith of abraham he won't lose one of them you say well job lost all of them he was a perfect man but god gave him all back to him everything will be restored to you all these promises are yours everything is yours and abraham staggered not at the promises of god i wonder if we could get to a place like that ourselves but see humanity gets in our way and we start thinking about we start thinking about women the life that i have the cards i've been dealt and many times it's bad and i remember thinking as a young person i thought man i don't want to be living in the situation i'm living in and i you know a lot of times we make our situations worse by trying to fix things ourselves if we would ever get down on our knees and pray study the word of god a lot of times the answers are right here in front of us and we fail to grab a hold of them and that's the problem we run into but i tell you tonight church there is a positive gospel to the seed of abraham listen to the denominations to the world there's all kinds of doom and gloom for them and rightfully so but to you this this this thing that's going to come upon the earth all the bombs and things that's going to hit that's not on you you have nothing to be scared of because your abraham's seed and you've already been called out from among that and i believe tonight if we could ever think really hard about who we are and take the word of god and just believe for it we would quit worrying about the gas prices we quit worrying about the economy and who's president we would be we would quit thinking about all that because god's got it all in control anyway i'm not saying you got to vote for one or the other what i'm saying is quit worrying about who's there because if you really believe the prophet of god the system is crooked anyway so they're going to put in who they want to put in and so i'll say it this way we we spend so much time worrying about it it becomes a distraction to your christian walk and it becomes a place where all you can think about is the doom and gloom of the world when that worldly doom and gloom is not yours anyway but the promises is what you should think about because that is yours the inheritance is yours the things that we think so much about the world and it happens to all of us we think well you know this so-and-so is president you know groceries are going up gas is going up they're going to bomb us there's no leadership in the white house there's no leadership well i'll be honest with you there's no leadership there anyway because really there's puppet strings pulling everything but i'll say this here there's a god who's actually in control of all of it and he knows exactly who will be there on the next term and the term after that if the lord tarries he knows who's going to be there so the bride has nothing to worry about sickness is going to strike you at some point if the lord terrorists you're going to die with something why worry about it and start the process now let's just keep it let's just put it off a little longer to worry is it there there's nothing brother brandon i heard this on the tape today he said there's no merit in worry there's no healing in worry nothing we worry about things we have no control over and we start getting ourselves all worked up into a frantic emotion about the way the world is when the world don't belong to us but the whole entire universe does this world as we know it is chaos but there is another world that will be set up here and that is ours there will be no sin there will be no bad presidents maybe not at all but there will be a god there who has already is already god here and when you can really get into the atmosphere of god you can realize that we have nothing to worry about even here even on this side before we ever get to the perfect place right here in the chaos we live in god has already given us reason enough to withstand the devil he's given us a sword he's given us the spirit of truth he's given us the message of the hour he's given us everything we need and all we have to do is grab a hold of it and accept it but what we do is worry and we fuss and we fight and we get into a state of panic because of the way the world is church i tell you quit worrying about it quit getting distracted by it it's not going to help you and i know the humanity comes in and it gets a hold of us all at times but i think that's a good time to get on your knees that's a good time to read the word of god that's a good night good time to turn on a tape and change the presence of god or bring the presence of god to you change the atmosphere turn on something good turn off the news maybe a little bit there's nothing good on it it'll depress you it will actually play with your emotions people don't like emotions in church but i'll say this you can listen to the radio and your emotions will change you can watch tv and your emotions will change you can watch a movie and it will play with your emotions that's what it does but i would just sure enough like the holy ghost to take control of my emotions won't hurt nobody amen i'd rather that than the movie stars change my emotions i'd rather that than cnn or fox or c-span or whoever else i'd much rather the holy ghost change my emotions than that i would much rather come to the house of god and feel an emotional presence and love among the people than to come in and amongst a bunch of people who are worried if they're going to go in the rapture am i going to make it am i going to go through the tribulation all these things i tell you what none of these things move me we'll just put it that way because when the when the flesh is all gone and this temporary house is gone there is another one already waiting for you regardless of the state of this one you think about this there's been people that have passed on that have been crippled and there's been people that have went to be with the lord who maybe they couldn't talk or maybe they couldn't see but this is only a temporary tabernacle and question was asked to me one time why would a good god allow these things to happen to good people but they're thinking in the carnal realm they're thinking in such a and this space of time that we live in is such a short time to god it's not like it seems to us and it's so short and fleeting and fast this is just a temporary tabernacle but see abraham's seed they're not just a possessor of this body in this life but you possess things even after this life why because you're more than just a human being you are a spirit of christ in you you are a little messiah you are a creator the atmosphere you have around you is created by you this the spirit you bring to church with you is an atmosphere you created and brought to church with you you can either come to church with god or you can come to church with a bad spirit the bad spirit is going to affect the people around you maybe unless they prayed through real well but i will say this that many times we think about ourselves so much how do i look when i come to church how are my kids going to act in church is anybody going to look at me wrong is anybody going to not shake my hand or shake my hand but listen the seed of abraham comes to hear the word they come to because there's a promise in the word to them and when i know in my heart that there's a promise somebody has got a has promised me a lifetime supply of norwex or something all this other you know this the sales marketing some somebody's promised me a lifetime supply then i expect to get it in the mail every month or get my subscription or whatever i expect it but what about a promise of god that he that will heal all your diseases do you expect it to happen do you expect it or do you think it maybe it'll happen maybe it won't happen if abraham would have had that kind of faith he would have never taken isaac up in the first place to the altar never would have taken him because in that kind of faith you're getting up there and you think well maybe god won't provide iran maybe god won't do anything maybe but abraham knew that even if he died then even in death god could raise up another you imagine if you waited 25 years for your firstborn child and god told you to go take his life could we do it that's hard but that's where our faith has to go that's the trust we have to have in a living god it's not a god of yesterday he's not a god of abraham and moses and those he is a god of those but he's not just a god of that day he's not just a god that walked on earth 2000 years ago but he's also a god of now and he's the same god people try to put it back with brother branham and that's wonderful we see that god was used in brother branham's ministry but that same god using brother brandon's ministry can be used through little old you because you say well i don't have the sign in my hand and i don't have the gift of the visions and i don't have these things but you're still a seed of abraham there's not one seed listen there's not one seed that is greater than the other seed in that line because if i am a pruitt and he is a pruitt i am just as good as he is maybe i can't preach like him but i can still i'm still i still have the same rights to the same family history we have the same problems because of who we are but let me tell you like this you are just like isaac just like isaac everything that abraham promised to his son that's you you daughters of abraham you sons of abraham i think it's time we take back our blessings take back your joy take back your praise don't let nobody steal it from you don't let nobody take it from you you say but everything looks like it's falling apart just a little bit longer and it'll all be made new just a little bit longer and all the wrongs will be made right the crooked places will be made straight the message we have is a message of restoration and it came and he said i will restore all things i will restore all things back abraham's seed is here again and we still have the blessings of god we're still sons of abraham the power is still in the church satan is only a bluff we've got to step out on faith we've got to believe the word of god we've got to get to a point where we put down our doubts cast down reasoning realize who we are in god's economy because we're going to have in this life we're going to have troubles we're going to have all kinds of temptations we're going to have things in his flesh this flesh this flesh is never sanctified this flesh is never saved but there is a spirit man in here that is in christ and that person is saved so no matter what happens here if you die tomorrow of a heart attack if you're in christ you don't really die and when you realize that you have an eternal life an eternal being that's not the one you see here but it's the one on the inside and that inside man will become so big that the outside man will try to cut you will actually come under subjection to that man in a sense it'll fight it's the black dog and it's the white dog and they will always fight and they will they will always be there but in this sense right here there is a spirit man and if you feed that spirit man daily he will live and he will grow stronger and greater but if you always pull back and you quit reading your bible and you quit hearing the message of the hour and you do these things and you expect to live a christian life in a victorious life then you're missing it because when you feed the black man and your eyes excuse me your eyes are always glued to the tv and you're always thinking about things like this let me tell you this that black man will get bigger and bigger and the white man will get smaller and that spirit will get smaller but when you think about this one right here when you think about the spirit that's in you that will glow and grow because you have to feed it on god's things you have to get that thing fed daily if i went on a diet which i have and my brother did too i've lost weight he hasn't but when you go on a diet you can skip a meal here and there you can do different things and all that but if you do the same thing with your spiritual diet you're also going to lose some weight in that area and that sounds simple and it is but think about it like this if i feed if i can if i just say i'm not going to eat no more i'm not going to drink no more water i'm not going to feed myself anymore i'm going to die pretty soon you can only live so long without food and water when you do that to your spiritual life and you expect to be alive when you come to church you expect to be alive when it comes time of death you're really going to die then but if you fed your spiritual man when it comes down to the river and it's time to die you don't actually die that spiritual man has been fed so well you just step into another body and when we can feed our spiritual man like that we can feed him just as well as we do our natural flesh we can get nice and fat on the natural but can we do the same in the spiritual can we really feed ourselves i wonder if we read our bible three times a day how we do i wonder if we heard two or three tapes a day how we would act at church because this is not a dead letter this is not a dead message this is alive it is a real living thing that god has sent to us and when you have a living being inside of you and you have a living god that is feeding you then really really what you grab a hold of is not something that's dead not not word only but in the spirit also and when you see a man of god maybe that has fallen back and they get into a spot to where everything's dead and dry and they don't believe in the spirit or no emotion in the church that's whatever people can do what they want to do but let me tell you this you have starved out your spiritual being you have gotten to a point to where you don't really believe who you are because if i believe that i'm a spiritual seed of abraham then what i really believe is this that i've already inherited everything and now it's time for me to go and tend to it i've already inherited the blessings of god but i'm going to water it i'm going to feed it if i don't really believe i have that vehicle that someone has given to me then i think of it like this i'm never going to put gas in it i'm never going to go claim it and put tags on it because i don't really believe it's mine there's got to be a catch to it and maybe somebody thinks there's a catch to the blessings of god but there's no catch to it it is yours it is every bit yours the same it was abrahams you get to the point that you really believe that that the possession is yours you can enjoy it because to possess is to enjoy you can have or you can hold it with absolute title deed absolutely everything is yours a lot of times happiness is is not a something we wake up with right because we think about the things that are distracting us we think about work we think about lack of money we think about a car that maybe broke down or maybe our lack of transportation there are many things in this life that's going to go wrong but the facts are when you can really look up and see like you said where the apple's falling from you can ask god for it and god can still provide what you have need of just because you lack in this life doesn't mean you'll always lack in this life maybe god is putting you through a test maybe god is allowing something to happen so that god can really use you in a spiritual way maybe he is allowing temptations to come upon you to see if you can withstand them and maybe god is allowing things to happen like he did job go ahead satan take him but you can't touch his life and that is the same way of us satan has nothing to do with when you die god already knows to a true believer god knows the beginning from the end and when you take on christ and his word we are the royal seed we are absolutely one with christ because in christ is when you take on the royal sea and i'll try to quit i see my time's getting away from me i hope that clock is right not an hour behind oh my goodness but we need a reminder sometimes of who we are we do need a reminder sometimes that we are still the royal seat of abraham we are still god's chosen people regardless of the politics regardless of anything you're still god's chosen people so when you can get past that it'll change your attitude and your atmosphere because you're always going to have the human side that's going to beat you down but just steal away and pray ask god to take that evil spirit off of you the spirit of depression the spirit of things that might grab a hold of you and drag you away from church the sickness that gets on your bodies god is still god and he's still more than able brother brahem says it like this whatsoever you ask in the father's name i'll do it every promise in the book belongs to you when you're saved he gives you a check with his name wrote at the bottom of it don't be afraid to fill it out because the bank of heaven will recognize it if it goes through the pentecostal clearinghouse he said that's right if you've got something here on deposit yourself if you're recognized if you've got identification to show that the check belongs to you it's only for believers now if you got that identification god will recognize your check that's right no matter what you ask for any redemptive blessing belongs to you if it was redeemed it belongs to you you already have a check written out abraham's seed is already written out on it all you have to do is cash the check cash the check for your children cash the check for your brothers and sisters cash the check for your spouse cash the check for something that went wrong in your life cash the check for depression if the news is bothering you turn it off and cash god's check turn on the news of heaven hear that voice calling out to you come out of her my people be not partakers of her plagues come on over here and enjoy the blessings of god come on over here where we're fed on the true things of god leave all those things in the past that are in the past and come forward and press on towards the mark that's what we have to do as believers is quit thinking about where we've been maybe so much and i was this and i was that it's a great testimony but there's more than that because we are now sons and daughters of god we are now the royal seat of abraham and so we get past that here we see that the the pentecostal clearinghouse is what casual clears that check and they look at it and they examine that check and we see here that on the bottom of this when it says it doesn't say joel pruitt because god will never recognize that maybe but he'll recognize this he'll recognize abraham's seed because we're all the one and the same not one of us or above another just the last name and excuse me for saying this i don't mean this is slander but the last name branham does not get you to heaven it does not give you any more power than a pruitt or a white or anybody else it's wonderful to be related maybe if i was a natural king son that would be wonderful and you could take some pride in that or maybe it would be maybe if i was a president a president's son maybe i could take some pride in that but there's one thing you have to remember you are actually greater than the leaders of this earth you're greater than the than the gods of this world you are more than able because you can withstand every power every temptation not your flesh but the god in you the creator has already put a seed in there and that seed has already brought forth life and now you are now sons and daughters of god and you are abraham's seed so you don't have to worry about anything we can get past the word get past all these things that hinder us nothing will separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus nothing no politics no gas prices nothing but satan will try you in every way you know when satan when you realize one of satan's tactics and you start okay i can stand up against that one because i know satan's coming at me with a certain way he'll change his tactics and a lot of times that's how we get in a trap he quit trying to put the spirit of depression on you because you don't get depressed like you used to you're a happy child of god but then he'll bring over here and he'll make your best friend turn against you and he'll make you feel like you're no good and you're a bad friend and you're all this but listen satan is only using that to affect your spiritual walk he is trying to get you down he's trying to put a pothole in this road we're walking on but tonight church i believe that if we can ever get past this carnal flesh and you say it will always be here it will always be here it will always fight you but if you'll just feed that spirit man a little more we can overcome this we can absolutely overcome this would you stand with me as musicians come we are more than conquerors through christ that loved us we are more than able because we are the seed of abraham in christ and i know it's short and it's in his simple thought there today but i just want you to be encouraged that this world has nothing on you this flesh has nothing on you your family may look like it's in shambles it has nothing to do with your eternal destination nothing you're in now the situation you're in has nothing to do with where we're going we are the seed of abraham and just as isaac was called from abraham as the son of god you also are called a seed of abraham in abraham's seed the blessings of god still exist the word of god is still good to us because we believe everything that god promised for us i believe that god has something for every one of us today god has something that you can grab hold of there's a promise in your life and you know there are resources in heaven that we haven't even tapped into yet because we're down here living in this in this this world we live in with the distractions we have if we could ever just get past that we can really grab hold of the promises of god and we can say god i give this flesh to you and i give my life to you so that i can just make it a little closer i want to be just a little more like christ i want to walk just a little more in his love and kindness i want to be just like christ because in him i take on all the promises of abraham seed do you believe you're one of his how many abraham seed do we have in the house tonight that every promise in the bible is yours there's not one of them that satan can steal from you he'll come and knock on your door turn him away kick that box of rattlesnakes out of the way they're not yours don't take possession of an evil when god has already given you all the good things of the bible healing is still yours your children are still yours your family every one of them through faith is still yours god is still god can you bow your heads this evening lord god i hope that something was said lord it would bless someone here tonight lord god as
