[32:13] your grace think of myself and my own
[32:16] family Lord where would we be without

[32:21] being written Lord and we had control
[32:24] over what was being done Lord we messed
[32:27] up in every way that we possibly could
[32:30] we were beyond hope without God in the
[32:33] world but then mercy reached down to
[32:37] where we were Lord lifted us out of the
[32:40] miry clay we're so grateful for that God

[33:05] would say father to your people would be
[33:08] of eternal value pray you granted God

[33:43] enjoyed the song service so much tonight
[33:45] it truly is a blessing to know that
[33:49] mercy rewrote our life we're gonna read
[33:52] from job chapter 3 and verse 25 job
[33:55] chapter 3 and verse 25 thank you for
[33:58] being here tonight it's good to see all
[34:00] of you in the house of the Lord and and
[34:02] many others that are watching today is
[34:07] our 14th anniversary I think that's
[34:10] right my wife and I was 14th wedding
[34:13] anniversary so I wanted to make note of
[34:16] that and it's a great thing in life and
[34:18] God gave me a wife that would put up
[34:21] with me
[34:22] and I'm convinced but Alan there's not
[34:24] another woman in the world that would
[34:26] have done that for 14 years and so she's
[34:29] been right behind me and in my life has
[34:32] been devoted to the ministry in whatever
[34:34] way that we could and and and that's
[34:36] what we've tried to do and she's put up
[34:38] with that from the first day that we got
[34:40] married she understood that that's the
[34:42] way that was gonna be in and she's
[34:44] always been right there with me and you
[34:46] can't ask for more than that
[34:47] amen and so I'm glad to be married to my
[34:51] wife I sure married up for sure in job
[34:54] chapter 3 and verse 25 for the thing
[34:58] which I greatly feared has come upon me
[35:01] that which I was afraid of has come unto
[35:05] me I pray the Lord would add his
[35:08] blessing to the word you may be seated
[35:10] this evening I a little bit nervous
[35:16] about this because this is an odd
[35:18] subject for me but it comes from my
[35:20] heart and these this thought came to me
[35:25] and and I just couldn't get away from it
[35:27] and I want to title this how to not
[35:30] become what you hate how to not become
[35:35] what you hate because this is something
[35:38] that is very personal to me that I've
[35:40] had to deal with in my life and I think
[35:43] that maybe most of us have had to deal
[35:46] with this at some point in time one of
[35:49] the paradoxes of
[35:50] life is that the things that you are
[35:52] exposed to enough to hate or to fear are
[35:57] the very things that you are most likely
[35:59] to become does that make sense you're
[36:03] you're around something enough that you
[36:06] don't like it you know you don't like it
[36:08] but the Caleb it's it's something that
[36:10] maybe some way that you were raised and
[36:12] maybe maybe not that maybe something you
[36:14] were around a certain type of church or
[36:16] certain kind of people or maybe you come
[36:19] up in someone you knew was a liar and
[36:21] someone you knew was a thief someone you
[36:24] knew was in some other way and and if it
[36:26] was close enough to you you learn to
[36:28] hate that you learn to dislike it you
[36:31] you don't hate the person but you you
[36:33] hate the thing that they become and the
[36:35] things that they do and if we're not
[36:37] careful though longer we stare at that
[36:40] the more we deal with that the more that
[36:42] we we fight it the more we're willing to
[36:46] use whatever means necessary to overcome
[36:49] it and sometimes in battle and in
[36:52] fighting these things in our lives we we
[36:55] war so much whether on against something
[36:57] that's going on or that's happened in
[36:59] our past that we overcompensate to the
[37:01] point where we be willing to do anything
[37:03] and we would do almost any means and the
[37:08] truth is when it comes to the gospel
[37:10] when it comes to our Christian walk the
[37:12] means are never justified by the end and
[37:16] so it has to be a that we can't bring
[37:20] the gospel out of a fear or out of
[37:24] terror or out of something that is
[37:26] impure in our life the gospel has to
[37:28] come from a place of love
[37:30] even if we're fighting something we hate
[37:35] and so I've found that people that
[37:38] become focused so much on one thing that
[37:40] they get that one thing in their mind
[37:42] and this is especially true as I said
[37:44] it's very personal for me because as a
[37:47] minister you tend but the day you get so
[37:49] focused on one thing you hate that and
[37:52] you don't want to ever become that and
[37:54] so you preach at it you preach at it you
[37:56] preach at it if you're not careful you
[37:58] become what you preach because you
[38:00] stared at it so much you know all about
[38:02] it
[38:04] and you know that's true if you had a
[38:08] dad and most of us did and you know
[38:13] there's things about your dad if you'd
[38:15] be honest that you'd say I don't want to
[38:17] be like that no matter how much of a
[38:19] saint your dad was and how great that he
[38:21] was you grew up and and probably true of
[38:23] your mom as well but especially it seems
[38:25] like our dads that we say I just don't
[38:28] want to be like that I don't I don't
[38:30] want to do that in my life and so you
[38:32] try to go a different direction and if
[38:34] you're not careful you overcompensate to
[38:36] the point where you you can't drive down
[38:40] the middle of the road you're constantly
[38:41] watching that ditch and you try so hard
[38:44] to stay out of the ditch that you go in
[38:45] the other ditch and you end up just as
[38:48] bad off as you were and you become what
[38:52] you hate you see some of these are so
[38:53] bitter and so awful and you just can't
[38:56] stand the way that they are and you end
[38:58] up becoming what they are as a reaction
[39:02] what you focus on the most is what you
[39:05] become and I think we need to be careful
[39:06] that we focus on the word we focus on
[39:10] the face of Jesus Christ that we that we
[39:12] keep from looking at everything else
[39:14] around us and saying well I hate what
[39:16] this world has become I hate what the
[39:18] coronavirus has done I hate what the
[39:19] Democrats are doing or the Republicans
[39:21] are doing is something else we have to
[39:23] stay focused enough that we can see what
[39:25] is your word say and brother branham
[39:31] talks about this this verse in Jobin he
[39:34] says in the book of Job it says here job
[39:36] feared and what he feared it actually
[39:39] happened he said what brought it his
[39:42] fear that's what made it happen that's
[39:45] interesting isn't it that's what made it
[39:47] happen his faith would have kept him
[39:49] from it but his fear brought it to him
[39:53] he was scared it was going to happen and
[39:56] it did happen and I love the way puts
[40:00] this he said now if he knew it wouldn't
[40:02] happen it wouldn't happen if he'd have
[40:05] been confident in other words said it
[40:07] wouldn't happen and then it wouldn't
[40:09] happen but he said the thing which I
[40:10] feared come upon me and brother branham
[40:15] uses it and another illustration said
[40:17] enough you take
[40:17] woman shall maybe be married she and her
[40:20] husband she's scared she isn't going to
[40:22] have a baby she wants one she's so
[40:25] scared she won't have it she won't and
[40:28] I've seen this many times she's so
[40:31] scared she won't have it she won't
[40:32] because just like Joel said the things
[40:34] that I feared the most come upon me see
[40:37] but you take that same woman he said now
[40:39] he said if there's doctors was probably
[40:40] sitting by nurses you take that same
[40:42] woman let her adopt a baby she'll have
[40:44] one herself see it quietens her no he
[40:48] said if you haven't got enough faith
[40:49] he's speaking of healing
[40:51] he said if you haven't got enough faith
[40:53] to receive it right now is a miracle
[40:54] then takes the adopted baby attitude who
[40:58] or it it's mine because you promised it
[41:00] I'll go from here tonight praising you
[41:03] just the same as if I was well he said
[41:06] watch what happens you'll receive it it
[41:09] has to happen God promised it amen but
[41:14] why does that happen because he quietens
[41:16] us it's it when we when we know it's
[41:19] going to happen then it happens and when
[41:22] we know it that it won't happen it
[41:23] doesn't so we tend to come back to the
[41:27] things that we were there's a very
[41:29] graphic scripture in proverbs chapter 26
[41:31] and verse 11 it says as a dog returned
[41:34] it to his vomit so a fool returned it to
[41:36] his falling it just keeps going back in
[41:40] Peter that he quotes sad and he says dog
[41:43] - it's vomited a sound - its waller they
[41:46] just keep going back to what they were
[41:49] and how many times do you see that that
[41:52] someone will come from sin and you think
[41:55] and they hate that but then they go
[41:56] right back to it again and actually
[42:00] become again what they hate or become
[42:03] again what they preached about against
[42:06] now and again I said this is personal
[42:10] because it's directed at me because I
[42:12] want to be careful about that because
[42:14] it's so easy to go off on a tangent and
[42:17] just strike it something so much that
[42:20] you actually become just like what
[42:23] you're striking at now but the Bram
[42:28] talks about the early Pentecost he said
[42:29] come out of the denomination's he said
[42:31] that was
[42:31] Kirstin word to you the nominations they
[42:34] didn't want anything to do with it and
[42:36] just a few years later they started
[42:39] forming denominations and you think how
[42:42] did they go from that first Church say
[42:45] we don't want nothing to do with that
[42:46] but the curtains nothing at all and then
[42:48] here just a few years later here they're
[42:50] they're wanting it and they're forming
[42:52] it well it's because he said there's a
[42:54] dog goes to its vomitus out of their
[42:56] wall oh he went right back to the thing
[42:58] you were born to defeat I've seen it so
[43:02] many times with us preachers as I said
[43:04] that a preacher might recognize that a
[43:07] certain group has organizational
[43:09] tendencies and become so fearful of that
[43:12] and so focused on it that he orders
[43:13] those that he has influence over not to
[43:16] fellowship with those who have an
[43:18] organizational tendency not realizing
[43:21] that he himself has become an
[43:22] organization and and so it's it's a it's
[43:29] a reaction you want to protect what you
[43:31] have but listen it's not going to be up
[43:35] to me to protect the word it's up to God
[43:37] he fights for his word and it's up to me
[43:41] to preach the word to preach the word
[43:44] that's what I have to do and we have to
[43:45] live the word don't we we have to live
[43:47] the word but if we're not careful we we
[43:50] know what we're against but what are we
[43:53] for what are we for and I don't ever
[43:58] become known for what we're against and
[44:01] you say well message people well they're
[44:03] against shorthair on women and they're
[44:04] against pants on women and they're
[44:06] against a worldly music and they're
[44:08] against drugs they're against alcohol
[44:10] and all these things yes we are but
[44:12] that's not what we are we're for healing
[44:14] we're for grace were for salvation we're
[44:19] for going to it going to heaven go to a
[44:21] better country I'm looking forward to
[44:24] millennium I'm there's a lot of things
[44:26] that I'm for it's not just what I'm
[44:28] against now there's some things that as
[44:33] I went through this and just kind of
[44:35] bear with me because these are my own
[44:37] thoughts but I believe it compares with
[44:39] the scripture with the message but I've
[44:42] tried to put down
[44:43] some things as I said how to not become
[44:46] what you hate one way to not become what
[44:50] you hate is do not spend the rest of
[44:52] your life comparing yourself with people
[44:54] who you know are wrong you know that
[44:59] they're wrong there's no reason to go
[45:00] back and compare yourself with them
[45:03] right you come out of it for a reason
[45:06] there's no reason to just keep going
[45:08] back and watch and say well I got to do
[45:09] better than they do and you can you
[45:11] could use that with your parents or a
[45:13] church or anything else you keep going
[45:15] back to what you were thinking well they
[45:17] had their blessed life I need to be
[45:18] blessed like they are they got a new car
[45:20] I didn't need a new car like they do
[45:21] they do things a certain way we better
[45:23] do things that way no don't compare
[45:26] yourself with people you know we're
[45:27] wrong we'll never compare with the world
[45:30] will never compare with denominations
[45:32] there's some message churches will never
[45:34] compare with there's no reason to you
[45:36] know people run after folly they run
[45:39] after false doctrine they congregate
[45:41] everywhere you could set up a place if
[45:44] there's a guy on on television I've seen
[45:47] him sometimes when traveling and and
[45:49] he'll come on he's got miracle water I
[45:52] don't know if you've seen this guy or
[45:53] not but he's got water bottled up and
[45:56] then we did an investigation of this guy
[45:57] and he just getting water out of the tap
[45:59] he don't even have a church and he got
[46:02] an infomercial he sells just water to
[46:04] people 50 dollars or something like that
[46:06] for a little bottle of water and you
[46:08] take it and drink it in it's miracle
[46:10] water you got testimonies and things
[46:12] like that people flocked to stuff like
[46:15] that
[46:15] the man has made millions of dollars and
[46:18] yet you preach the truth and few people
[46:20] will come after him that's right but but
[46:24] we don't can't compare ourselves with
[46:25] that say well if I was as successful as
[46:28] he was well he's successful because
[46:30] people will follow that he doesn't
[46:33] require any kind of a Christian life or
[46:35] anything like that but there's a reason
[46:36] why the truth Strait is the gate and
[46:38] narrow is the way that leads to eternal
[46:39] life Galatians 5:26 of emulations this
[46:45] is one of the the works of the flesh
[46:48] emulations and emulations are in v's or
[46:54] emulation that is strife
[46:56] to excel at the expense of another
[47:00] strive to excel at the expense of
[47:03] another who oaring others to setup
[47:06] oneself unholy zeal fervently adopting a
[47:11] bad cause or supporting a good one by
[47:15] cruel means I said the means never are
[47:19] justified by the ends you might be able
[47:22] to keep someone in your church by cruel
[47:24] means you might be able to make someone
[47:28] toe the line by cruel means but it's
[47:30] never justified it's never justified
[47:36] inquisitions pretending to support true
[47:38] religion by torturing and burning alive
[47:40] those who both profess and practice it
[47:43] it was Adam Clark's definition of that
[47:45] emulations brother branham but Perry
[47:49] green tells the testimony her brother
[47:50] branham read this and the brothers were
[47:52] all being competitive in different ways
[47:54] and preachers out on a hunting trip and
[47:56] round 2 were told by the Perry that was
[47:59] his testimony anyway about it that he
[48:01] read him Ephesians 5 to license 5:20 and
[48:04] he said that was a competition and
[48:08] that's what the word literally means
[48:10] competition strive to excel at the
[48:13] expense of one another but see we've got
[48:16] to recognize God is sovereign God knows
[48:20] what he's doing
[48:21] let's turn to Psalm 75 5 Psalm 75 and 5
[48:26] he says lift not up your horn on high
[48:28] speak not with a stiff neck in other
[48:32] words don't don't constantly talk about
[48:35] what you have and how powerful you are
[48:38] or your position for promotion cometh
[48:42] either from the east or from the west or
[48:43] from the south but God is the judge he
[48:47] put us down one who set us up another
[48:49] and you look and say well that person
[48:51] has a better position than me it doesn't
[48:52] mean you serve God less it doesn't mean
[48:55] that you were in less it God puts up one
[48:57] sets down another promotion comes from
[48:59] God and so you might become jealous of
[49:03] someone that has a position or of
[49:05] influence but that person was set there
[49:07] by God
[49:08] God allowed them to be there and it says
[49:13] he says God put it down alone God as the
[49:16] judge he put it down one set us up
[49:17] another but like what he says in verse
[49:20] eight he said for in the hand of the
[49:22] Lord there's a cup and the wine is red
[49:25] and full of mixture and he pours out of
[49:29] the same but the dregs thereof all the
[49:33] wicked of the earth shall wring them out
[49:34] and drink them so he's saying God has a
[49:37] cup in his hand a cup of judgment a cup
[49:42] of judgment and in that hand he's saying
[49:44] to hear those that are wicked you see
[49:46] them here they they've done everything
[49:48] wrong and you compare yourself with them
[49:50] and say well I don't have a life like
[49:51] they do here I've tried to live for God
[49:54] I've tried to do the things that are
[49:56] right and here is this person that
[49:58] that's standing there and they're able
[50:00] to do whatever they want to do and get
[50:01] by with it I can't get by with nothing
[50:04] why because you're a son or daughter of
[50:05] God you don't let us get by with
[50:08] anything pretty bad it's just a good
[50:12] sign we're sons and daughters of God but
[50:15] here's someone else just gets by with
[50:17] whatever and seem like everybody's form
[50:19] and all the people fought to them and he
[50:21] said God why is my life why does it have
[50:24] to be this way well God has in his hand
[50:26] a cup of judgment and the cup is not
[50:30] mixed with water to dilute it but it's
[50:32] it's mixed with thee it's the strength
[50:34] of the wine or the strengths of the
[50:36] judgments and the dregs of it
[50:38] so that if you got the the dregs you
[50:41] would get the very worst of it the very
[50:44] worst of the cup is reserved for the
[50:46] wicked but it's in God's hands keep your
[50:53] eyes on good things David in Psalm 73
[51:00] and 2 says this as well he says but as
[51:02] for me my feet were almost gone my step
[51:07] said well nice slipped you can go back
[51:10] and read the whole chapter maybe if you
[51:12] get time but it's a good thing to look
[51:13] at he said for I was envious at the
[51:16] foolish when I saw the prosperity of the
[51:19] wicked
[51:22] I know that there are people who think
[51:24] well if I didn't have to pay my ties I
[51:25] could be like him if I didn't have to go
[51:29] to church I could have fun like they do
[51:31] and we're talking about real things
[51:33] tonight
[51:34] you know you as just a young family I've
[51:38] for the RV I paid it that I thought this
[51:41] but I have thought this if I wasn't a
[51:44] preacher life would be a whole lot
[51:45] easier it really would be and sometimes
[51:50] but the hell you think what did I sign
[51:51] up for why I spent almost every weekend
[51:56] that's 14 years of marriage studying to
[51:58] preach and I think you know we have
[52:02] taken a lot out of our family and I'm
[52:04] not complaining about it
[52:05] but I have thought that thought I
[52:07] thought you know it would have been so
[52:09] much easier if I had just decided let me
[52:11] just put that off till I'm 40 til I'm
[52:14] financially secure and everything's the
[52:16] way it should be but God didn't want it
[52:18] that way and when you get thinking that
[52:21] way you get envious at the foolish
[52:23] because you see people your age doing
[52:25] much more than you were able to do and
[52:27] having much more than you have and he
[52:30] said I was envious at the foolish when I
[52:32] saw the prosperity of the wicked when I
[52:34] thought to know this it was too painful
[52:36] for me now I skip down to verse 16 he
[52:39] said when I thought to know this it was
[52:41] too painful for me until I went into the
[52:44] sanctuary of God this is a place where
[52:48] our eyes open up this is where we get
[52:51] understanding he said I went into the
[52:54] sanctuary have gone I went to church and
[52:55] then understood I their hint surely thou
[53:00] did set them in Slippery places that
[53:04] cast us them down into destruction you
[53:08] set them in Slippery places so he's
[53:10] saying that he understood that the very
[53:13] fact that they have what they have
[53:14] becomes a trap to them the very fact
[53:19] that they're able to do what they do in
[53:21] the very fact that they don't have the
[53:22] conscience that you have you wish you
[53:25] get by with lying like somebody else
[53:27] does you wish you could get by with
[53:29] living like somebody else does but you
[53:30] can't do it why your conscience won't
[53:32] let you that that's something inside of
[53:35] you
[53:35] keeps you hold you from doing that but
[53:37] what is it it's grace to you and you set
[53:42] them he said him slip replaces brother
[53:48] branham and the masterpiece speaks of
[53:51] this group of of the bride the preview
[53:56] of the bride and he talks about the ones
[53:59] at the end were kind of getting out of
[54:01] line
[54:01] and he says they was getting back trying
[54:05] their best was getting back he said just
[54:08] get in line
[54:09] he said because here's why they were
[54:12] getting out of line he said because they
[54:13] was looking out somewhere else watching
[54:17] about that church that just went out
[54:20] into chaos well look what that church is
[54:25] doing look at that worldly Church look
[54:29] what they're becoming you better be
[54:32] careful because when they did you know
[54:36] it's hard to focus if you're marching in
[54:38] a marching man on the beat of an the
[54:40] time and they're marching onward
[54:41] Christian soldiers it was hard for them
[54:43] to cope it's hard for them to focus on
[54:45] the bandleader it's hard for them to
[54:48] focus on the time and marching the way
[54:51] that they should
[54:52] while they're looking over here they got
[54:55] distracted by that other church and it
[54:58] could have been just comparing
[55:00] themselves thinking man were nothing
[55:02] like them thank God there were nothing
[55:04] like them someone said what the message
[55:07] was true
[55:08] everybody would believe it well tell
[55:10] that at the end of Jesus ministry nobody
[55:14] stood with him he went to the cross by
[55:18] himself but it was still the truth they
[55:23] men he was the truth brother Barrett
[55:28] said they were watching about that
[55:29] church that just went out into chaos he
[55:31] said but the front ones never but the
[55:33] back ones just two or three of them kind
[55:34] of stepped down a little bit to the
[55:36] right hand side look like was trying to
[55:38] get back in line
[55:38] as they went by it gives me great hope
[55:41] the way brother Branham tells that
[55:42] because he says that they were trying to
[55:45] get back in line why that's the real
[55:47] bright
[55:49] surreal bride there they may have gotten
[55:50] their focus off it gotten distracted but
[55:52] they're trying to get back in line the
[55:57] second thing that come to my mind is I
[56:00] thought about how to not become what you
[56:02] hate is you have to remember that almost
[56:04] everyone does some things right
[56:10] something or some things and it's okay
[56:15] to say that there it's right even if the
[56:19] person is wrong and that's something
[56:22] that Bella Branham taught us is is that
[56:25] you have to stay with the word and
[56:29] because a man could have a gift and it
[56:33] was a real gift and you could be best by
[56:35] it but be false at the bottom be false
[56:39] and be wrong but yet it could be a
[56:41] wonderful thing and it's okay to
[56:43] acknowledge that there's healing that
[56:46] takes place it's okay to acknowledge and
[56:49] people say well you know I said see
[56:51] sometimes this message people we don't
[56:52] want to give the Baptist's any credit or
[56:55] the Pentecostals any creditor the
[56:56] Methodists any credit you know but
[56:58] there's some things they do right and
[57:02] it's okay to acknowledge that but we
[57:04] don't leave the word we stay with the
[57:08] word they can do whatever they want to
[57:10] they can preach whatever they want to
[57:12] but we want to say it's close to the
[57:14] word as we can but the RAM says
[57:17] everybody infant baptism he said they
[57:18] can do whatever they want to he said but
[57:19] we like to stay close to the word we
[57:23] like to say just as close to the word as
[57:24] we can and so you have to remember and
[57:27] because that'll cause you problems
[57:29] because you'll think well they they have
[57:31] success they're doing good but you got
[57:33] to remember almost everyone does
[57:34] something right even as the saying is a
[57:39] blind squirrel will find a nut every now
[57:41] and then just even if it's by accident
[57:46] so and there's sometimes people who do
[57:49] many things wrong but they're more
[57:51] successful in certain areas than we are
[57:54] God does not count success but he does
[57:56] reward them for what they do right a
[57:58] person may do nothing right but pay
[58:01] their tithes nothing right but
[58:02] go to church well thank God they go to
[58:04] church thank God they pay their tithes
[58:06] them they may do nothing else right it's
[58:09] okay to acknowledge what they do right
[58:12] and injustice 47 you know God speaks to
[58:18] Cain and came with serpent seed he was
[58:20] never gonna do the right thing but God
[58:23] says if you do well shucks they'll not
[58:24] be accepted there's an odd thing to say
[58:27] to serpent seed they said if thou doest
[58:30] well shalt thou not be accepted he said
[58:32] I'll I'll acknowledge it have you bring
[58:35] the blood I'll acknowledge it you come i
[58:38] cabled it I'll acknowledge it you see
[58:43] people that'll go places and they won't
[58:45] rejoice with people and they won't Amen
[58:48] or do things that well these people are
[58:50] wrong so I'll just sit here no no they
[58:52] may be wrong but they could have
[58:54] something right and you could be more
[58:58] wrong in your in your desire to be right
[59:00] than they are hope you're staying with
[59:05] me I I know this is kind of a little bit
[59:07] different
[59:08] I saw Philip Pett had turned in on the
[59:10] online now I was good to see that and
[59:12] Philip if you're still watching I'm it's
[59:14] good to have you tonight and Philips in
[59:15] the army and so we glad glad that he was
[59:19] able to watch if only for a little while
[59:21] but you know there's things that we do
[59:24] we want to acknowledge that people are
[59:29] able to make good decisions we want to
[59:32] base our decisions on the word and you
[59:35] know our election is not based on just
[59:38] the reaction that we get or the
[59:41] blessings we get from God brother
[59:44] Branham said that God said that his love
[59:47] was elective love the proof of his love
[59:50] is election the proof of Abel and Cain
[59:54] the difference between Abel and Cain was
[59:56] not how God reacted but it was their
[59:58] revelation and that produced a reaction
[1:00:02] and God said if Cain if you did on the
[1:00:04] same thing I would have acknowledged you
[1:00:06] too but the difference was the election
[1:00:09] gave them revelation somehow without a
[1:00:13] Bible without anything else here Abel
[1:00:15] was able to
[1:00:16] the revelation that he needed god help
[1:00:20] us today but see God's love is elective
[1:00:23] love no matter what happened his love
[1:00:26] was proven truly by the fact they were
[1:00:27] chosen unto salvation God has chosen you
[1:00:31] to salvation through sanctification of
[1:00:32] the Spirit and belief of the truth but
[1:00:34] the brem says he may commit you to death
[1:00:35] as he did Paul he may commit you to
[1:00:37] suffering as he did job
[1:00:39] that is his prerogative he is sovereign
[1:00:42] but it is all with the purpose if he did
[1:00:45] not have a purpose he would be the
[1:00:47] author of frustration and not a peace
[1:00:49] and so we get frustrated when you drive
[1:00:53] by you mean you may drive by my kids
[1:00:55] we're counting churches the other day on
[1:00:56] the way here and I think they got up to
[1:00:58] about 50 churches we drive by to come to
[1:01:02] church you think about that well you
[1:01:05] know there's here 49 others that we
[1:01:07] drove by why because we believe we we
[1:01:09] believe the truth we have the truth and
[1:01:11] and we love one another but you may
[1:01:13] drive by 100 churches but God is
[1:01:17] sovereign he chose you for that it
[1:01:19] doesn't make them any less but God chose
[1:01:21] you that God gave you revelation and God
[1:01:25] accepts what you offer amen
[1:01:28] now we find that many times what people
[1:01:32] do their things they do that are right
[1:01:34] but they tend to do the wrong things or
[1:01:38] put the focus on the wrong things and
[1:01:40] that's what the Pharisees did in Matthew
[1:01:42] 23 and 23 he says woe unto you scribes
[1:01:45] and Pharisees hypocrites for you paid
[1:01:47] tithes of mint and anise and cumin
[1:01:49] they paid tithes out of their spice rack
[1:01:53] so they would take the spices that they
[1:01:55] got and literally measure out 10% and
[1:01:58] give that to God now I don't think any
[1:02:03] of us are that diligent but that's what
[1:02:09] they would do but that's all they cared
[1:02:11] about god help us today and omitted the
[1:02:16] weightier matters of the law judgment
[1:02:17] mercy and faith these ought you to have
[1:02:22] done he says not to leave the other
[1:02:24] undone you did something right and Jesus
[1:02:26] even acknowledges to the Pharisees they
[1:02:28] did something right
[1:02:29] but they weren't right as I was thinking
[1:02:34] about this another thing was if you
[1:02:36] don't want to become what you what you
[1:02:38] hate you have to allow for the
[1:02:40] possibility that you could be wrong and
[1:02:44] I don't mean about the word the word is
[1:02:48] right a hundred times out of a hundred
[1:02:51] but my idea about the word may not be
[1:02:54] right you have to have the humility in
[1:02:59] life if you're gonna make you gotta have
[1:03:02] to have the humility to allow for the
[1:03:03] possibility you could be wrong why
[1:03:05] because God thinks differently than you
[1:03:07] do and he thinks differently than I do
[1:03:10] just because I'm behind the sacred desk
[1:03:12] doesn't mean that I have a better idea
[1:03:13] than my wife does I throw some of you
[1:03:19] but that's true it stops we have to have
[1:03:22] the humility to listen there was times
[1:03:27] when Moses wife had a better idea than
[1:03:29] he did God came looking for Moses and
[1:03:32] Moses wife had a better idea than he did
[1:03:35] and there's times that we've got to be
[1:03:38] willing to allow for the possibility
[1:03:39] that we could be wrong and I say in 55
[1:03:44] and 80 God says for my thoughts are not
[1:03:46] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[1:03:48] ways saith the Lord for as the heavens
[1:03:50] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:03:52] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[1:03:54] than your thoughts so you can say it
[1:03:57] this way the word is never wrong but I
[1:03:59] am often wrong the word hasn't been
[1:04:05] wrong since it's been written but I've
[1:04:09] been wrong today are you with me now
[1:04:14] I've known people who were absolutely
[1:04:17] positive and excuse me I don't mean to
[1:04:20] offend you whatever side of this you
[1:04:22] fall on but but I've known people they
[1:04:25] were absolutely positive that brother
[1:04:26] Branham taught that if you celebrated
[1:04:27] Christmas you were going straight to
[1:04:29] hell and they were so sure that they
[1:04:32] were right that they found out that
[1:04:33] brother Branham had won and so they
[1:04:36] believed that his children had some
[1:04:38] house that somehow swindled him into it
[1:04:43] and that they did that against his
[1:04:44] wishes and as you think just think that
[1:04:48] through you have to think and I'm not
[1:04:49] mocking anybody but I just wanted to
[1:04:51] it's just an example or an illustration
[1:04:53] how we get ideas and you know they're
[1:04:58] it's a much greater slander to say that
[1:05:00] a minister doesn't have his house in
[1:05:01] order then to say that he has a
[1:05:04] Christmas tree so you're actually making
[1:05:09] brother branham worse then then what you
[1:05:12] would if you acknowledge that it was his
[1:05:13] idea
[1:05:14] I mean people just don't they don't
[1:05:19] think about things like that and it's
[1:05:20] because people they stake out a position
[1:05:22] and they're afraid to say that they're
[1:05:24] wrong because they lose face you know
[1:05:27] how you avoid that don't go out on that
[1:05:30] limb it's okay to believe something but
[1:05:36] make sure that it's based in something
[1:05:39] and if you don't have any basis for it
[1:05:42] it's okay to have an opinion but don't
[1:05:45] stake your life on it
[1:05:47] because we could be wrong there were
[1:05:52] things when I first started preaching
[1:05:54] that I could have absolutely stood on
[1:05:56] and really thought I knew about and I
[1:05:58] found out later we're wrong brother
[1:05:59] branham did that to Benjamin Franklin
[1:06:03] was perhaps the wisest man in the world
[1:06:06] in his age but he made a habit of when
[1:06:10] talking to people I made him a great
[1:06:12] great at diplomacy because he made a
[1:06:14] habit when talking to people of saying
[1:06:16] perhaps or it could be this is the way I
[1:06:20] see it rather than saying this is the
[1:06:24] way it is because he always went around
[1:06:26] the world assuming that there was
[1:06:28] somebody who knew more than he did I
[1:06:30] think we really need to assume that
[1:06:32] about God there's somebody who knows
[1:06:36] more than we do and we have to be
[1:06:39] willing to own up to them say the Lord I
[1:06:41] know that you know more than I do about
[1:06:43] this you know brother Branham
[1:06:49] exemplified this to us and I just want
[1:06:51] to go through a couple of things I know
[1:06:52] I'm going through this slowly but I
[1:06:53] won't take too much of your time tonight
[1:06:55] but
[1:06:56] brother Bentham says in questions and
[1:06:58] answers and I love the way brother
[1:06:59] random handles questions and answers
[1:07:02] because he qualifies his answers a lot
[1:07:04] of them he says this he said if I didn't
[1:07:07] answer to suits you why maybe I could be
[1:07:09] wrong he said but it's the best of my
[1:07:12] knowledge you see this is the best of my
[1:07:14] knowledge again he said he said there's
[1:07:17] only one thing left for this United
[1:07:18] States to do he said now remember this
[1:07:19] is william branham speaking this is my
[1:07:21] idea it's only presuming just looking at
[1:07:23] it in the natural standpoint which may
[1:07:25] be a million miles off I'm not speaking
[1:07:28] of this particular thing whether it's
[1:07:29] prophecy or not but just to let you know
[1:07:31] brother Branham the way he handled
[1:07:33] questions
[1:07:34] he said just looking at on the natural
[1:07:36] standpoint maybe a million miles off he
[1:07:38] said I do believe that right there he
[1:07:39] said in the money the love of money is
[1:07:40] the root of all evil I believe that
[1:07:42] right along in there we'll start the
[1:07:43] ball rolling now see that that's that's
[1:07:45] a wonderful idea and a wonderful thought
[1:07:47] but he said I could be wrong now again
[1:07:54] and he talks about people that color
[1:07:57] their hair and I've heard all entire
[1:08:00] sermons about this in my lifetime I'm
[1:08:03] sure you have too but it's amazing how
[1:08:06] much we presume to know that a prophet
[1:08:07] didn't know and brother Branham says
[1:08:11] sister dare he said I wouldn't know what
[1:08:12] to tell you so listen I can't say for
[1:08:15] women about that putting color hair I
[1:08:16] have no scripture against that I can
[1:08:19] only stay with the scripture and I will
[1:08:20] tell you this I believe a man needs to
[1:08:23] stand on his convictions there's things
[1:08:24] I want to allow my daughters to do that
[1:08:26] I don't have any scripture for but I
[1:08:28] don't let them do it because you see
[1:08:31] what it leads into and so I try to be
[1:08:34] very careful with with my daughters
[1:08:35] especially in with my son there's some
[1:08:37] things that there's no scripture for it
[1:08:39] but I don't allow him to do it because
[1:08:40] it's leading to something it's just what
[1:08:43] I would consider worldly but I can't
[1:08:46] tell them there's any scripture against
[1:08:47] it if they get old enough to have their
[1:08:48] own family they can decide for
[1:08:50] themselves and because that's my opinion
[1:08:54] now but the scripture says they have to
[1:08:57] have long hair and said after that he
[1:08:58] said I don't know where to go said see I
[1:09:00] don't know nothing about that he says
[1:09:03] again so now I'm just telling you this
[1:09:04] for me because I have no scripture to
[1:09:06] back this up the only thing I have for
[1:09:08] the ladies about their hair is
[1:09:09] to cut it now they want to wear it
[1:09:11] that's up to them about the pin curls
[1:09:12] actually he said I don't know what they
[1:09:14] are what that is either he said unless
[1:09:16] it's these things that look like close
[1:09:17] friends they stick in their hair he said
[1:09:19] about the only thing I know of he said
[1:09:21] in the links of the sleeves I think
[1:09:23] being a Christian God would tell you
[1:09:25] what to do about those things you see I
[1:09:29] believe as a Christian person you'd know
[1:09:31] about how to do that well he's putting a
[1:09:34] lot of it back on you in me putting a
[1:09:37] lot of it back on me I believe as a
[1:09:39] Christian person you'd know about how to
[1:09:41] do that he said I don't think God cuts
[1:09:44] any certain links or whatever it is
[1:09:46] close your decent look honorable and
[1:09:48] clean speaking about the sleeves he said
[1:09:50] I think that's all right he said don't
[1:09:52] you said now that's just my opinion now
[1:09:54] this is me see because I can't back
[1:09:55] nothing else up with the scripture I'm
[1:10:00] glad he was honest with us first
[1:10:03] Corinthians 82 says this if any man
[1:10:06] think that he knoweth anything he
[1:10:09] knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
[1:10:12] so well I know this we don't know
[1:10:16] nothing yet that he ought to know but if
[1:10:18] any man love God I want to be that one
[1:10:23] that love God somebody found guilty of
[1:10:25] anything let me be found guilty of
[1:10:27] loving God if any man love God the same
[1:10:31] is known of him it's one thing to know a
[1:10:35] thing
[1:10:36] if any man think that he knoweth
[1:10:38] anything but if any man love God the
[1:10:40] same is known of God that's who I want
[1:10:43] to be known by hey Ben amen
[1:10:47] as I was thinking through these things
[1:10:49] the next one that I began to think about
[1:10:50] was we have to avoid spiritualizing
[1:10:53] carnality and this is maybe a little bit
[1:10:57] complicated but what I'm saying is that
[1:10:59] there's things that we do that's just
[1:11:01] the flesh it's just us getting in the
[1:11:04] flesh there's so much of what you do as
[1:11:07] a minister that's just a flesh and
[1:11:09] trying to decide what to do you know
[1:11:12] there's things with decisions we have to
[1:11:14] make brother Branham talked about
[1:11:16] Abraham how either had to make decisions
[1:11:17] we have to make decisions as a church
[1:11:18] sometimes you just have to decide to do
[1:11:20] something when to have when
[1:11:23] have a business meeting you know when to
[1:11:26] our far apart to put the pews when to
[1:11:29] change something there's just things
[1:11:31] that you just have to decide and
[1:11:33] sometimes that decision is up to a
[1:11:35] pastor sometimes it's up to a trustee
[1:11:37] sometimes it's up to the entire church
[1:11:38] but you just have to decide it sometimes
[1:11:40] and we have to be careful about
[1:11:43] spiritualizing our carnality then we get
[1:11:45] mad about something and don't want it to
[1:11:47] be a certain way and so we come up with
[1:11:48] a spiritual reason why it shouldn't be
[1:11:50] that way or why it should be that way
[1:11:53] and the most common example of this that
[1:11:56] I've heard in my life and I am so sick
[1:11:59] of people using this to adjust to to
[1:12:03] actually qualify their abuse and that's
[1:12:09] Jesus using the whip and I know that
[1:12:12] brother Brandon talks about it I know
[1:12:14] it's in the scripture I know that Jesus
[1:12:16] did that but you know Jesus did that and
[1:12:18] did no sin and I want to see you pick up
[1:12:21] a whip and not sin with it when you go
[1:12:25] into the temple or me if I had gone into
[1:12:31] the temple I might have just got in the
[1:12:32] flesh a little bit Jesus did it and did
[1:12:35] no sin and there's times when you got to
[1:12:40] get rough and there's times but we
[1:12:42] should never use it as just an excuse
[1:12:45] for our abusive natures Jesus was
[1:12:50] completely justified in doing that but
[1:12:52] when a lie should curse the children but
[1:12:53] the brown said that wasn't the Spirit of
[1:12:55] Christ
[1:12:58] it wasn't the Spirit of Christ God
[1:13:00] honored that prophet but was not the
[1:13:02] Spirit of Christ Acts chapter 15 and
[1:13:05] verse 36 this is an example of something
[1:13:10] that's just a carnal disagreement it's
[1:13:14] just a disagreement and it's about how
[1:13:17] to do the work of the ministry and who
[1:13:18] to do it with in X 1536 some days after
[1:13:21] Paul said some days after Paul said it
[1:13:23] unto Barnabas let us go again and visit
[1:13:26] our brethren in every city where we have
[1:13:28] preached the word of the Lord and see
[1:13:29] how they do so they're going on a
[1:13:31] missionary trip to shore up the faith of
[1:13:33] those that have those new converts let's
[1:13:36] see
[1:13:37] they're doing and Barnabas determined to
[1:13:40] take with them John whose surname was
[1:13:42] Martin if you look at the nature of
[1:13:43] Barnabas Barnabas is always trying to
[1:13:46] help somebody
[1:13:47] so Barnabas was taking him along to try
[1:13:50] to help him because the last time he
[1:13:52] went with them he got what his mom and
[1:13:54] went home and so so Barnabas thought
[1:14:00] well it'll help him if we take him with
[1:14:02] us that was his nature some men are like
[1:14:05] that
[1:14:05] Paul is only taking him thinking about
[1:14:08] the work they have to do and he says
[1:14:10] last time he wanted mom and went home we
[1:14:13] haven't got no time for that so Paul
[1:14:18] thought it not good to take him with him
[1:14:20] who departed from them from pamphlet and
[1:14:23] went not with them to the work
[1:14:25] Marvis don't you understand the last
[1:14:27] time your nephew went with us fizz's
[1:14:30] nephew Barnabas his nephew the last time
[1:14:32] he went with us he left us what makes
[1:14:35] you think he'll stick it out this time
[1:14:36] and it says and the contention was so
[1:14:39] sharp between them that they departed
[1:14:42] asunder one from the other and Barnabas
[1:14:44] took mark and still to Cyprus which is
[1:14:47] Barnabas's home country and Balto Silas
[1:14:51] he took mark and went home he used to
[1:14:53] say you'll take your your Jackson go
[1:14:55] home or whatever and take your cards and
[1:14:57] go home you won't play no more take your
[1:14:59] ball and go home
[1:15:00] he took his his mark and went home and
[1:15:05] Paul chose Silas and departed being
[1:15:09] recommended by the Brethren unto the
[1:15:10] grace of God there's something
[1:15:13] interesting about this paragraph of
[1:15:14] Scripture that's there it's just there
[1:15:16] and it doesn't ever tell us who's right
[1:15:18] and who's wrong and the writer never
[1:15:22] attempts to tell us one way or the other
[1:15:26] who's right but later on we find that
[1:15:32] Paul comment' recommended the Brethren
[1:15:35] to receive mark and this is in
[1:15:37] Colossians 4 in 10 he said Aristarchus
[1:15:39] my fellow prisoner salute excuse Marcus
[1:15:41] as Mark sister's friend to Barnabas
[1:15:43] touching whom he received Commandments
[1:15:45] and becoming do you receive him so he is
[1:15:47] mentioned as being someone that they
[1:15:50] receive so we know he's traveling again
[1:15:52] on the ministry but not with Paul
[1:15:55] Barnabas is never mentioned in the
[1:15:57] scripture again we don't know what
[1:16:00] happened to it but if you go back and
[1:16:03] look if it wasn't for Barnabas Paul
[1:16:05] wouldn't have a ministry
[1:16:07] Barnabas is the one that first drags
[1:16:09] Paul out of the desert and brings him to
[1:16:11] the Apostles and starts his ministry
[1:16:13] because Barnabas believed in it and so
[1:16:17] later on Paul gets in prison and he gets
[1:16:20] in trouble
[1:16:21] and he doesn't have anybody standing
[1:16:23] with him he talks about all these for
[1:16:24] cooking in 2nd Timothy 4 and 11 and you
[1:16:28] would think the last person he would
[1:16:29] want with him is Mark because everybody
[1:16:32] else forsook him but somehow Paul has to
[1:16:34] begun to realize either something has
[1:16:36] changed with mark or something exchanged
[1:16:38] with Paul that Paul realizes that Mark
[1:16:41] is profitable because he says only Lucas
[1:16:43] with me take mark bring him with thee
[1:16:46] for he is profitable to me for the
[1:16:48] ministry I'm glad that Paul was honest
[1:16:51] about this but again if this had been us
[1:16:54] we would have made up some kind of
[1:16:56] excuse some kind of long dissertation on
[1:16:58] lie that Luke or why that mark was right
[1:17:03] or why that Paul was right and what the
[1:17:06] spiritual reason will oppose the
[1:17:07] messenger the age and these things and
[1:17:09] here's a reason for that and we'd fight
[1:17:11] about that but it's just the flesh and
[1:17:16] God allowed it to happen for a reason
[1:17:21] some things we just do just because it's
[1:17:24] just us and we don't need to make an
[1:17:26] excuse based on well it's some spiritual
[1:17:28] thing you know there's people you could
[1:17:32] never sit under listen to preach every
[1:17:34] day I know that there are probably
[1:17:37] hundreds of people out there that could
[1:17:38] never sit and listen to me preach
[1:17:39] service after service after service you
[1:17:41] just couldn't do it
[1:17:42] you just couldn't take it and there's
[1:17:45] other people that could and you take the
[1:17:47] same minister and people one person just
[1:17:49] can't do it it's just the flesh and
[1:17:52] that's why God didn't call just one man
[1:17:54] but he calls a pastor in every local
[1:17:56] church listen
[1:18:01] but the Brenham says he was going on
[1:18:05] y'all know the story I won't go into it
[1:18:07] but in standing in the gap he tells
[1:18:08] about how he wanted to go into the
[1:18:09] wilderness be a prophet stomp out with
[1:18:12] the Word of God he said I said I don't
[1:18:15] want to be that but I don't want to have
[1:18:16] to live like that I want to do something
[1:18:17] different now the Holy Spirit had spoke
[1:18:20] to him and told him you're going to be a
[1:18:21] bum if you continue on the way you're
[1:18:23] going you're going to be a bum and
[1:18:25] brother Brent says I don't want to be a
[1:18:26] bum he said but I was told that you'd
[1:18:28] called me to be a prophet I want to live
[1:18:30] in the wilderness like the Prophet and
[1:18:32] brother Bryan was very honest here he
[1:18:34] said but I was using my own excuse so I
[1:18:36] could hunt my own good how many times do
[1:18:43] we do that and try to justify what the
[1:18:47] spiritual means but in doing so we
[1:18:49] become just like what we hate listen the
[1:18:54] last one if we're don't want to become
[1:18:58] what we hate then we have to recognize
[1:19:00] why that God put difficult people in our
[1:19:03] lives and forgive those people because
[1:19:07] there's people who are placed in our
[1:19:09] lives just to be difficult there's at
[1:19:14] least one in every church I haven't
[1:19:15] found one here yet so don't think like
[1:19:19] that but there's at least one but
[1:19:21] David's gonna raise his hand volunteer
[1:19:23] but there's at least one and every
[1:19:25] church is just difficult and then in
[1:19:28] your life somewhere you know there's
[1:19:30] somebody that's just difficult to get
[1:19:31] along with and they're put there for a
[1:19:34] reason
[1:19:34] if you know the story of Hanna in 1st
[1:19:37] Samuel chapter 1 in verse 6 the Bible
[1:19:39] says she had an adversary that was the
[1:19:41] other wife I was her husband's other
[1:19:45] wife what shows you what a bad idea
[1:19:47] polygamy was God allowed it but see it
[1:19:52] was it was a bad idea and because there
[1:19:55] was always strife in the home in here
[1:19:57] she's constantly it's an adversary says
[1:20:00] her adversary provoked her sore for to
[1:20:02] make her fret because the Lord had shut
[1:20:04] up her wound and as he did so year by
[1:20:07] year when she went up to the house of
[1:20:08] the Lord so she provoked her therefore
[1:20:11] she wept and did not eat and if you know
[1:20:12] the rest of the story that's what got
[1:20:14] her to pray
[1:20:16] and she received from God and she had a
[1:20:19] child that boy was Samuel why because
[1:20:22] she had an adversary in her life
[1:20:24] sometimes you've got to have an average
[1:20:26] so you have to recognize why God puts
[1:20:29] difficult people in your life and be
[1:20:31] willing to forgive them for me who God
[1:20:33] made them my wife's forgiving me right
[1:20:40] now for lobster
[1:20:46] you gotta recognize God puts in there
[1:20:49] sometimes God put somebody difficult in
[1:20:52] the lighthouse God allows somebody
[1:20:54] difficult to be in the governor's office
[1:20:56] God allow somebody difficult in the
[1:20:58] church why God allows it we can't focus
[1:21:02] on that person you guess if you spend
[1:21:05] the rest of your life waiting on your
[1:21:06] adversary to apologize and make things
[1:21:09] right you're gonna live a miserable life
[1:21:11] if you make every decision just faced
[1:21:14] with tunnel vision well when they
[1:21:15] apologize I'm gonna keep doing this
[1:21:17] until they apologize I'm gonna keep up
[1:21:19] my guard I'm gonna keep doing oh forget
[1:21:21] about it forget about it walk away from
[1:21:25] it you don't want to be miserable you'll
[1:21:28] become worse than your adversaries you
[1:21:30] keep it up you become an adversary to
[1:21:33] someone else and not even recognize what
[1:21:36] you're doing to yourself you're ruining
[1:21:40] ministry you ruin your family you'll
[1:21:43] ruin everything around you because
[1:21:44] you're constantly attacking your
[1:21:46] adversary and your adversary was put
[1:21:49] there for a reason mark 11:25 says when
[1:21:55] you stand praying forgive if you have
[1:21:58] aught against any and this is not based
[1:22:02] on whether they make amends personal
[1:22:06] forgiveness is not based on whether a
[1:22:08] person asks for forgiveness now there is
[1:22:13] a forgiveness when it comes to the
[1:22:15] church as a corporate body that when
[1:22:17] someone continues to live in sin and
[1:22:19] Paul said don't don't be a partaker with
[1:22:22] them and things like that there's a
[1:22:24] forgiveness the church can given and
[1:22:25] it's held back from that person until
[1:22:27] they were
[1:22:28] fit as a body what have you bind in
[1:22:31] heaven and be bound on earth but as an
[1:22:34] individual you have to forgive that
[1:22:35] person as an individual you have there's
[1:22:39] times you've got to walk away from them
[1:22:41] there's times you've got to avoid them
[1:22:43] there's time there's no reason to hang
[1:22:45] out with what's causing you problems all
[1:22:47] the time there's times you just have to
[1:22:50] get away from it as I've said to people
[1:22:53] recently there's no reason to live life
[1:22:55] miserably why would we do that
[1:22:58] why would we just continue to live
[1:23:00] miserably and say well I can't help it
[1:23:03] but listen a lot of this is on us if you
[1:23:07] when you stand praying forgive if you
[1:23:09] have ought against any that your father
[1:23:11] also which is in heaven may forgive you
[1:23:13] your trespasses listen when something
[1:23:15] bad happens to you so bad that you just
[1:23:17] can't seem to take it and you just can't
[1:23:19] seem to make it out of what you're doing
[1:23:20] remember when that horrible thing
[1:23:22] happens if you don't forgive that person
[1:23:25] you'll spend the rest of your life right
[1:23:28] there you'll never be able to move on
[1:23:33] but if you can forgive them whether they
[1:23:36] make it right or not you're gonna be
[1:23:37] okay you're gonna move on there's a big
[1:23:41] world out there there's a lot more
[1:23:42] people out there that that want to have
[1:23:44] fellowship with you that want to love
[1:23:45] you don't stay they're worried about
[1:23:48] that person that won't shake your hand
[1:23:50] you said on purpose because I know some
[1:23:53] of you I've tried so hard not to shake
[1:23:55] hands during this and it's been hard and
[1:23:58] I know I'm probably gonna offend some of
[1:24:00] you before it's over but I just I don't
[1:24:02] want to do that I want to try to be a
[1:24:04] good example but see you've got to
[1:24:06] forgive if you spend your whole life
[1:24:08] there that's you'll never get any
[1:24:10] farther oh god help us said that your
[1:24:16] father also which is in heaven may
[1:24:17] forgive you because you did things
[1:24:22] during the time that you were looking at
[1:24:24] what they did you did something as we
[1:24:27] said Sunday there was an offense against
[1:24:29] God and when you offend against God he
[1:24:32] will forgive your trespasses if you
[1:24:34] forgive others but if you do not forgive
[1:24:37] neither will your father which is in
[1:24:38] heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:24:41] there's a story I'm closing a story
[1:24:45] brother Brennan tell us about some bike
[1:24:46] riders they were in a competition to win
[1:24:48] a new Schwinn bike and you've all heard
[1:24:50] the story they were going down this this
[1:24:52] long plank and each one of them would
[1:24:55] ride a little waist and they'd fall off
[1:24:57] and then ride and he looked down like
[1:24:59] this and they'd see the bottom they fall
[1:25:01] off they'd ride and they'd get worried
[1:25:02] about what was going on they'd fall off
[1:25:04] brother Brown said they talked to the
[1:25:06] young fellow that was able to ride all
[1:25:08] the way to the end he said here's where
[1:25:10] you make your mistake fellows you're all
[1:25:12] better riders than I am but you were
[1:25:15] looking here and it made you nervous to
[1:25:19] see you were trying to balance yourself
[1:25:21] and you fell off you fell off you've got
[1:25:27] to allow some play in the wheel one
[1:25:30] thing that brother have you taught me
[1:25:32] while I would say that stood out to me
[1:25:33] over the years is he would say staying
[1:25:36] in the middle of the road requires some
[1:25:38] play in the wheel if your will if you
[1:25:41] kept a wheel straight and never moved
[1:25:44] you would go off the road you've got to
[1:25:47] go a little this way a little this way
[1:25:49] and a little this way why doesn't just
[1:25:51] stay in the middle of the road because
[1:25:52] the roads not perfectly straight and
[1:25:55] life has its twists and turns you've got
[1:25:57] to be willing for there to be some play
[1:25:59] in the wheel you can't hate yourself
[1:26:01] because of something because you had to
[1:26:03] tune up a little bit you can't hate
[1:26:06] others because they had to tune up a
[1:26:08] little bit he says it made you nervous
[1:26:12] you trying to balance yourself and you
[1:26:14] fell off he said I never looked here at
[1:26:16] all I watched the end and kept steady
[1:26:21] I've seen passengers that got so worried
[1:26:23] about who come to church and didn't come
[1:26:25] to church on a given night that it
[1:26:26] almost destroyed their ministry you
[1:26:30] can't look at what's happening today
[1:26:33] that's right you can't look at what who
[1:26:36] comes and who doesn't in this service
[1:26:37] but look at the end church were going to
[1:26:41] a rapture I'd be glad for the day we
[1:26:46] don't have to use this church tomorrow
[1:26:48] but it won't be because some government
[1:26:50] entity comes and shuts us down it'll be
[1:26:52] because we went home
[1:26:54] but the member said before they could
[1:26:56] shut us up we'll go up hey Ben hey man
[1:27:01] you were trying to balance yourself you
[1:27:02] fell off he said I never looked here at
[1:27:05] all i watched the end and kept steady he
[1:27:07] said that's what we're to do don't look
[1:27:09] to these little things now did this one
[1:27:12] do this or that one do that watch the
[1:27:15] end and keep steady Christ is coming
[1:27:18] watch the end do we still believe that
[1:27:21] but the Helen said the other night that
[1:27:23] when he was young how that he
[1:27:25] anticipated the coming of the Lord every
[1:27:26] morning when he wake up
[1:27:28] so God help us to be like that today
[1:27:30] that every morning we get up and say
[1:27:32] Lord I believe today's today I want to
[1:27:35] live today like it was like it was the
[1:27:37] last day like Christ is coming watch the
[1:27:39] end just keep steady don't notice what's
[1:27:41] going on now people get so sidetracked
[1:27:44] by the coronavirus or what the
[1:27:45] government still don't what what the
[1:27:46] politics is doing watch the end we know
[1:27:50] what's happening at the end he didn't
[1:27:52] give us every detail in the middle but
[1:27:55] we know what's happening at the end
[1:27:57] watch what's going to go on out yonder
[1:27:59] at the end time he said when we're going
[1:28:01] to have to stand and give an account for
[1:28:03] our lives he says an astounding thing he
[1:28:06] said David wasn't watching that little
[1:28:09] old Benjamite throw dirt on him he was
[1:28:12] crippled in hell he never noticed him
[1:28:15] it's hard enough to notice somebody
[1:28:17] throwing rocks at you cursing you out
[1:28:22] but he said David never noticed it he
[1:28:25] wouldn't even let the guard cut his head
[1:28:27] off he said let him alone God told him
[1:28:30] to do that God told him to curse me let
[1:28:33] him alone for David knew that someday he
[1:28:36] was returning in power that binge about
[1:28:39] would have his time those dregs in the
[1:28:43] bottom of that cup or nasty you don't
[1:28:46] want to drink what's in the bottom of
[1:28:48] the cup of the judgment of God that's
[1:28:51] what the world's going to drink that
[1:28:52] person just gets to do whatever they
[1:28:54] want to do don't get your eyes on them
[1:28:56] don't become what you hate don't stare
[1:28:58] at the monster do you become the monster
[1:29:02] but look to Christ
[1:29:05] don't become a denomination because you
[1:29:08] hate denominations well we'll keep from
[1:29:10] becoming a denomination so we won't
[1:29:11] fellowship with nobody it's wrong god
[1:29:16] help us today we need to make sure that
[1:29:19] we keep our eyes on the goal lord help
[1:29:22] me to keep your my eyes on you and
[1:29:24] nothing else
[1:29:25] amen let's bow our heads together I hope
[1:29:32] it was some help to you tonight I know
[1:29:34] it's hard sometimes to to get across
[1:29:39] what the way the Lord laid it on my
[1:29:41] heart but I know the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:42] working in your heart as well
[1:29:43] give me something to say then he gave
[1:29:45] you something to hear Heavenly Father I
[1:29:50] pray Lord that you would just move it in
[1:29:53] our hearts now as we're here at the end
[1:29:55] of the service I pray that your spirit
[1:30:00] would just begin to go in and help us to
[1:30:03] examine our own lives and father were
[1:30:06] we've not done what we should or perhaps
[1:30:09] we've stared at something so long we
[1:30:13] just hate it maybe it's the way that our
[1:30:16] parents acted or someone else did
[1:30:18] something that was wrong and we've tried
[1:30:20] so hard to avoid that so long as we keep
[1:30:23] our eyes focused on what parents did or
[1:30:26] what some pastor did what some other
[1:30:30] church does what the world is doing we
[1:30:35] can't see you Lord it's impossible to
[1:30:38] stay in the middle of the road if we're
[1:30:39] just looking down all the time
[1:30:42] the Lord you said in your word that when
[1:30:44] it come to the end times and we see
[1:30:46] these things begin to come to pass you
[1:30:49] said look up look up because everything
[1:30:53] around us is just a distraction it's
[1:30:55] just noise we need to look up so we can
[1:30:59] see the coming of the Lord the Son of
[1:31:02] man revealed the word of our day that's
[1:31:06] living in our midst
[1:31:07] help us to look up Lord with the

[1:39:46] is that the way you feel amen you know
[1:39:51] that's the easy thing every trial we
[1:39:52] come up against we know we need one
[1:39:54] thing and that's him amen you know you
[1:39:57] really enjoyed that tonight you know
[1:39:58] just see that was from really bins hard
[1:40:00] I've always went back to that that quote
[1:40:03] that I've seen you know a soldier they
[1:40:05] asked a soldier one time why fought he
[1:40:07] says not because I hate the man in front
[1:40:09] of me but it's because I love the man
[1:40:10] behind me and many times as a minister
[1:40:12] you hear him here is preaching in sin
[1:40:14] and it sounds like we're so hard against
[1:40:16] this because we love the people and God
[1:40:17] place that love and desire on our hearts
[1:40:19] to see that everybody would be saved
[1:40:21] amen and that's why we ought to be is
[1:40:23] because we love one another that we pray
[1:40:25] for each other so let's sing that song
[1:40:27] if we could just worship Him just for a
[1:40:29] moment
