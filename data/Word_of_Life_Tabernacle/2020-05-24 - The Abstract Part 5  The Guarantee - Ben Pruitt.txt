so thankful that you can do the impossible and we've seen you do the impossible in our midst and we're so grateful for that today god I pray that you would move for each one of these needs Lord that was represented by way of an uplifted hand you see every need Lord and you're able to speak to that need today by your word I pray God that your word would take the preeminence in the service Lord that we could look beyond a man or his ability or inability God that we can look to you today and we could know that you're still Lord that you're a mighty God you're able or to meet our needs you're able to speak a word that can just plan itself in our heart and be watered and grow into something that would produce the life of Christ in us I pray you'd bless each one heal every sick person Lord every one that has a need Lord we thank you Lord those that are traveling and those that Lord are streaming today and father those that are here and the visitors that we have I pray that you'd bless each one the Lord when we leave here may we be able to say that you met with us we thank you for it in Jesus name Amen hey man god bless you this morning turn with me to Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 Acts chapter 2 verses 1 through 4 enjoyed the music this morning and worship of the Lord that song the bloodline is one of my favorite songs because it's the truth you can't cross the bloodline Amen there's something that was done for us a propitiation was made for our sins and the blood is something that the devil can't do nothing about it's just shed for us and we're so grateful for that today Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 also I wanted to say that we've been attending meetings over brother IVs and you know I think sometimes we look at things wrong I I think that we should be grateful to be in an area where there's meetings and other message people and churches and places we can go and and attend meetings when we can't have them ourselves and and be able to fellowship with our brothers and sisters and I'm grateful some of you got to come and and I've been listening to good preaching the last couple days so I'm not sure if I can come up quite that quality but but the word is still the word and it's still good but we got to here for the Andrew yesterday twice and for the Andrew Glover and I talked to him about coming back he's gonna be back in the area in late June so maybe you can come by and and speak to us again so we'll be looking forward to that and and the Lord willing if everything works out and we'll have some other maybe some other brothers in for the church this summer and it's good to hear the word of the Lord no matter who's bringing it but my heart was just really thrilled by the word that we heard this weekend and we're gonna try to go back over today and we live there anyway we're going back over and try to fellowship some more in and enjoy they're gonna have a singing tonight enjoy the music but it's good to be here this morning there's no better no place I would rather be than right here with you people it just seems like home and just as much as you've given me the opportunity to speak to you over the last few months and I'm so grateful for that Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like his a fire and it said upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning good to have my mother with us she come up for the meetings and wrote over with us this morning so we thankful for that it's good to have her this morning we've been talking about the abstract and and going through it examining it to see what it is and we found as I've said multiple times I keep referring back so that we don't forget the the continuity of it we found that the original owner was God and what comes from God can go back to God always remember that because there's going to be times in your life that you feel like that you've you just should give up and that there's nothing for you that that God's given up on you and people have given up on you remember if you come from God you can go back to God nothing can happen in the in the meantime that can take you out of his hand because when I Adam lost the title deed to the earth where did it go right back in his hands so Adam and Eve forfeited the title and goes right back in his hands we found there was a lamb came that that brought a propitiation for our sins that was a propitiation for our sins that we could we could have a way back into that chain of title if we could put it that way we could have a way back into Dominion that was ours and to have eternal life and so the lamb came to do that and he clears the title by his death on the cross and so and and by by conquering and being victorious over death then he proved was and that he was one that would as cautions to 14 puts it blotted out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us we went through that how that that was the the deed or the mortgage that was on the land that piece of paper that showed our sin and showed that we had no rights and to the land and he blotted that out and he not only blotted it out but he took it out of the way and he nailed it to his cross so I want us to live this morning in in Ephesians 1 and 3 and we continue we realized that the property has got to come back in our hands if we can make it personal this morning that the title debilitating to the earth has got to come back in my hands it's got to come into possession personally and it's got to be more than just an abstract thought that that God died at Christ died for us but it's got to be a reality in our lives that the abstract that we have that Dominion and we have that ability to speak the word and that we have the ability to overcome sin that we have the ability to live a victorious life and to live the life of Christ even in a horrible age even in an age of Laodicea but the Curtis we have the ability to live for God even in this age aren't you grateful that you serve a God that that didn't just leave you and and didn't just let you figure it out on your home but he gave you his spirit so that you can live in this hour you wouldn't have to do it all on your own but you'd have him and even when when and God gave us ministers he gives us he gives us pastors he gives us evangelists he gives us church family and people but even when everybody else is gone he's still there we found that out to this time of social distancing and isolation all these things we found out God still there he's still alive he didn't go away he's still the same and he still operates the same even when it's just us now the the the conveyance had to be made and in ephesians 1 he speaks about this title if we could put it that way and how we get these these blessings from God and this this right to the blessings of the promises of God and he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that's the original owner he chose us in him that's why it's not hard for us to follow the word and to do the things the word requires because he chose us in him we're just part of it we're just part of the word it's not a a dreary thing or something well the church makes me do this or or this just no it's not illegal ISM but it's the reality of we're part of him if we're part of the word it's easy to follow the word and so we find that he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children I love the way Paul puts that that he has predestinated us unto the adoption of children so there's a purpose to our predestination it's not just to be predestinated minister to be the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself so he's bringing us back into a place where we can have we can have a special a special status an ability to stand there as sons and daughters of God even though it seems like and you know we get to use to this world can I just talk to you a minute about it we get to use to this world we get to used to being able to touch things and and not being able to move them and and things happen in our lives we can't do anything about and so we think that's just the way that it is but remember God is able to do what you can't do but God wants to work through us and so Paul says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me I can do all things I can overcome sickness I can overcome disease I can overcome old age I can overcome the world that I'm living in are you with me this morning I can overcome to hear to see it I can do all things why he lives in me and so he wants to live in me and and walk in me and work in me and he's predestinated me to do that he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so it wasn't by our wheel it was not him that runneth or or of him that wills but it's him that God chose we ought to be so thankful to just heard the message of the hour we ought to be so thankful to be able to be associated with it sure we have problems sure we have situations in life but we ought to be so thankful that we have heard the word and millions didn't hear it and then there were many that heard that couldn't respond to it they just couldn't make themselves we even maybe had family members and people that just couldn't make themselves respond to it but here you've responded to it yes you've had trouble yes you've had trials yes you've been you've had war he said yes you've spilled stressed out it down but there's something in you that responds to the word there's something in you that just once or I may have messed up I may have been things that I didn't want to do and it was a gifts to her but yet there's something in me as if the word is true the word is true amen why because he predestinated me and to the adoption of children hallelujah to the praise of the glory of His grace I love that to the praise of the glory of His grace worry and he has made us accepted in the beloved he has made us accepted in the beloved sometimes in church it seems like we just don't fit in but he has made us accepted in the beloved oh they ought to make us love one another shouldn't it he has made us accepted in the beloved not that I make brother Sam accepted but he has made you accepted not that I've made brother David accepted but he made you accepted her mister Mary any of you he's made you accepted in the beloved if he has made you accepted it didn't matter what anybody else says I'm accepted in the beloved oh we get to we're too careful about what people think and say if I read yesterday and I've been pondering this where brother Brown was going to Africa and he was going to he was going to go there but he he had a certain thing that he felt led to do and he knew what's right to do he had a vision to do it and here were these ministers that were telling him don't do that you can't do that you got to keep this obligation you can't go on the signing trip you you've got to keep this meeting him these ministers were putting pressure on him and brother Ram said even brother Bosworth who's a great man of God but he stood there and pressured brother branham said no that's not the will of God this is the will of God I said it must have even been a false vision and brother Bosworth staying there telling him that but brother Brown said what it taught him is that he couldn't trust in the arm of any flesh because for the Bosworth's believe was even the oak tree that he said under and it taught him that he could oh my he could not he could not trust any flesh but he had to trust the leadership for the Holy Ghost and I think that's where we're at this morning we need to realize he has made us accepted no matter what anybody else says I'm not gonna let and don't take this wrong but I'm not gonna let your your thoughts about me keep me out of the house of God I'm not gonna let your thoughts about me or so what else does thoughts you should let someone else's thoughts about you keep you out of the house of God but say lord help me to be help me to realize that I'm completing you I'm not complete than just with everybody else but I'm completing you and that makes me accepted in the beloved because I don't always know the will of God for your life and sometimes we speak and if you ask me a question or if I'd ask one of these brothers a question maybe an older brother say brother what do you think the will of God is he could tell me what he thinks but that may not be the will of God for me and so you have to find the will of God for yourself because you were accepted in the beloved and so we've got to be careful about that but remember someone may do something that we don't think is is right maybe not sinful but just something that we think they do something anything well we think well that's just the wrong thing to do but remember they're accepted in the beloved not us and it may prove to be that they followed the will of the Lord it may prove to me that they didn't but they're accepted in the beloved according by the grace of God are you with me this morning now he's showing us that title could not be completely lost because we are the elect children of the original owner he been he made us and he we are his children we belong to him some nothing a man could do can take us out of his hand you hear me this morning nothing a man could do or a woman could do or any our family could do anybody else could take us out of his hand we belong to him we don't belong to him plus someone else we don't belong to him plus plus all the the ministry plural him plus a church or him plus another person we belong to him we belong to him and so title could not be lost because we are a select children officiants 1:7 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace oh that's his profession he made a way for say wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself and that just brings it all away from us doesn't it that's pretty ironclad it was nice I'll be honest with you mentally I have a hard time and a lot of people do with the doctrine of election but it's the truth it's not true because I can put it together it's true because the Bible says that it is I have a hard time wrapping my mind around a God who could choose me just for starters one thing will take you to somebody else one thing for him choose brother branham he chose me I was in his mind and I have a hard time wrapping my mind around a God that could do that but yet he said he did it he has a right to do it you might look at your family or you might my kids might look at me and say how can the Walker we have a dad like that so wonderful and caring and nice or they might look at me as a how in the world we have a dad like that it's on to us all the time doesn't give us everything we want that makes us share a drink when we go to the McDonald's and awful parenting right there but you know they don't they can't help that they're my children they belong to me I'm responsible for where is children I'm thankful for the freedom of the Spirit that we feel here this morning it's just wonderful but I'm just preaching to him where his children we belong to him we don't have to worry about about whether he's gonna give up on us or not you don't give up on your children well yes we belong to him and because of that he has the ability he has the ability to make us and inform us into his will and and to cause us to come to him to put it as hired us to come to him why we belong to him we're his children he had a right to have children and his children belong to him according he said to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance he said he preached too much about Christ preached too much about the person of Jesus Christ well Paul did look what he says in whom also in him and one we're giving one all things in Christ in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated of course according to the purpose of him and worketh all things after the counsel of his own will hey man that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now I want to stop there and we'll come back into Ephesians chapter one later but brother Brent says now he said now the same thing as this if you're a son of God and if I am a son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him jerem for when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he rose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we sit together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus sometimes don't feel like heavenly places we stop talking about your fleshly position he's talking about your seed the seed he's talking about you and your spiritual condition you said in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said for we if we are sons and daughters of God we are God's children then we are attributes of God then we got eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus listened became all that word then we were a part of him then they been he said there you are that's in there he said there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the type oast of the soul Oh bye isn't that wonderful and that wonderful at the origin didn't come tell us that God sent a prophet to tell us these things that's the tide post of the soul he said listen he said there's one thing I can't do I can't brag on my ancestors he said no he said I come through an awful mess I put these notes together and in fact I didn't know my mother would be here this morning but but still it's true we can't brag on their ancestors none of us can i brag on my mom but very few others he said I can't brag on my ancestors no I come to an awful mess my father was an Irishman my mother was an half Indian he said her mother was an Indian drawed a pension he said now all of them drunks most all of them died with their shoes on fighting gunfighters and so forth I can't brag on nothing about that because my ancestors and my family tree is terrible that's a prophet of God your God pre-planned that God three planned listen to this God three planned brother bana much terrible family tree think about that for a moment he said my family tree is terrible but brother Bible said God from generations back cause one person to meet another so the brother Brandon would be a certain way Oh church he didn't just do that for a prophet he did that for you you might look at your family tree see my family tree is terrible but that's what brother Brown could say my family tree is terrible but God allowed that God caused that to happen the way that it did by his omniscience by his sovereignty he said so my family tree is terrible terrible but brother there's one thing I can brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus Oh can't we brag on him today that's what we want to brag on wanna brag preacher we don't wanna brag on the singer we don't want a bag on a church we want to back on the Lord Jesus there's one thing that I can brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus who's redeemed me hallelujah aren't you glad you've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb we can sing I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb amen why because I can brag on him and with this transforming power planted a seed by predestination and I saw it hey man whose son am I now Oh think about that for a moment whose son am I now my natural birth you might have come up under a certain image that made you a certain way of course you'd have certain attributes certain characteristics but whose son am I now I'm not bound to what my father did I'm not bound what my grandfather was I'm not bound to what my my mother's family my father's family was I'm not bailed you're not bound to what your family was but you can be a son or daughter of God fully live a Christian life you could be free from sin you can be redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I preached a sermon one time called my father's damaged jeans and it wasn't that he had jeans that holds it on button but his jeans his genetics but I wasn't just my dad's everybody all of us had item speaking thereof Adam my father Adam had was damaged and he passed on those damaged genes and there was even Sir Percy to come in the world and all the things that happened him and we find that everything was so mixed up we were without God without hope in the world but God had planted a seed down on the inside of us and one day we saw it so we can say whose son am I now hey Ben I can brag on him you know forgive me for a moment we do way too much social engineering or on the message we want a certain person to be grow up a certain way in a church maybe the third or fourth message generation believer and generation message believer and and they're gonna get married a certain person we want to engineer that and cause them to go and always everything and if everything's not always been perfect with somebody we we we greet that with suspicion but see God doesn't work like that sometimes God can bring someone and you watch and bring someone out of the world cause them to sit among us and here comes a a son of God or daughter of God and they'll come and get saved and that those people will get married and have a wonderful family God did that now not that they should marry someone in the world but God can bring someone out of the world God can bring some out of denominations God can we try to engineer it where we have the best ties players and the best ability to do certain things God doesn't do that God doesn't he did not choose you because of the size of your bank account he didn't choose you because you were you were just everything was just perfect in your life but he chose you because you were his hey men you were part of him no but the premise says I saw it whose son of mine now yeah I can brag on him and I've spent 33 years of my life bragging on him if he would spare me another 33 years I'll try to prank or on him I can brag on my ancestry hallelujah either redeem me and planted the seed of life in here let me look down upon this word sit down his spirit and said here it is speak this and it'll happen I gotta settle down I've been in meetings but the Andrew I can't look at him and I think my it's good to be young you know I'm not very old but I think I think he's 23 or something like that I think my you just run all over the plate just wait you know until you get you feel like the old man on the lawn you get off my lawn but I can still brag on him hey man I can still brag on to him but the best I've been bragging on him for 33 years I can still brag on him I first come in this area and started preaching was 20 years ago I'm still bragging on him I can still brag on him I can't brag about nothing in my own I can't brag on nothing that I've done but I can brag on him can we do that today we can brag on him hey Ben he said speak this and it will happen he said he'd come down sit this bit look let me look down upon this word send down his spirit and said here it is speak this and it will happen do that he said oh my I can brag on him Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed now watch you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise he predestinated us unto the adoption of children you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise for 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession so there's still something more to come which is the change of our bodies but the finished work is that when we receive the Holy Ghost when we are sealed by the Holy Ghost we receive the Holy Spirit of promise which is an earnest or a guarantee and that's what I want to talk about this morning his word it's a guarantee because now he's died he's paid with his blood that's what makes us a Christian that's what changed our lives we were the seed of God but it took the blood of God to cover our sins divorce take away sin to be a profession it took the blood of God to do that but now you received the Holy Spirit of promise which is a guarantee to you that you know God already knew he already knew that you'd be here he already knew that you were a Christian he already knew that she'd be saved he already knew that you could be here you already knew but what is the Holy Ghost it is the earnest of our inheritance to let you know to let me know that I could be safe let me you know because I didn't think I could to let me know that I could be healed to let me know that those redemptive blessings those promises belong to me personally and so he says that it is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession now he references the earnest also Paul does in second Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 21 he said now he which establishes us with you in Christ and hath anointed us it is God who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts that's a guarantee second Corinthians five and five now he that hath brought us he said for the self same thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit the language in the New Testament is it's never used that you earned the Holy Spirit it's always that he gave it remember that you don't earn the Holy Ghost he gives it you just have to want it he said he wants to give it to you you just have to want it you have to be willing to accept that it's surrender to it now he's given us this earnest of the Spirit now but the Bible explains that word earnest enough in a way maybe that we'd understand better than if I explained it he said now he said I'm gonna give you the earnest of your salvation he said you know what the earnest is it's a downpayment he said like if I wanted to buy a boat from one of you Indian brethren went out and said how much you want for the boat you say two thousand dollars I'd say well I'll tell you what I'll do I'm gonna give you fifty dollars to hold it for me until next week he said will you do it hold it for me I'll do it brother Brown then you'd give me a receipt I'll give you fifty dollars no you can't sell that boat because I got first bid on it he said that's the earnest that I'm gonna get the boat it belongs to me well now God came back and said go up there to Jerusalem and wait I'm gonna send you the earnest of your salvation and they were all up there all in one Accord noticed in one place and suddenly there came the earnest come down from heaven like a rushing mighty wind it filled all the house where they were sitting so I want you to notice that the earnest guarantees four things four things the first being that's a chain of title is complete if you don't understand that that's just the list of deeds that go back to the original owner and is redeemed by Christ at the cross that chain of title it comes back in him and we inherit in him right so that chain of title is complete is also the guarantee that all liens have been extinguished everything's paid off they can't come back and say they have a claim on it anymore the sinners over that it's done you can't remind it you know people get in a contest sometimes and they begin to dislike one another and they begin to bring up things about each other's past and if they're Christians God doesn't remember any of it we can't fight each other based on what unrepentant sin because it's over it's done and that's for all of us but we have to repent a sly said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is it it's a it's an earnest to come to you when for repentance comes and you're in godly sorrow you have for repentance of your sins then he comes and steals you with the Holy Ghost now repenting is turning around from what you were and you are willfully surrendering yourself to God something in you now you couldn't do that unless you get out of seat in you had to be something in you to be able to do that and some people fight that all of their lives but it's just you willfully laying your life down I am crucified with Christ everything yes I live but not me Christ lives in me so it's laying down who you are and letting the the liens be extinguished in your life allow him to clear the title repentance comes before the Holy Ghost now look number three is that your rights or his rights can be enforced in you once the titles been cleared there's a guarantee the chain of title goes all the way back the liens have been extinguished and rights can be enforced before I have the guarantee I might wonder I might think well what if there's something there and so I would be afraid to go to court and enforce my right to the title of the land but now I'm not afraid why the abstract came I got it in the mail I looked at I said hey it's mine I can trace it all the way back I didn't do it but I own it I didn't buy it but it's mine are you with me now I didn't buy it I didn't have anything do with it but here the abstract comes down I've repented of my sins here comes the abstract doubt in my life and it shows me it's a guarantee that I cannot go back I cannot go to hell Amen I can't die eternally if I go to sleep in this life always again and it's a guarantee that every right to redemptive blessings can be enforced whatever I own I can walk on it whatever I own whatever the land says the devil can't take it from me and you could take that however that it fits your life now it's also a guarantee that resurrection is assured and some of you all as you grow older and and I think all of us as we get closer to the end we need to realize this this is our guarantee no amount of knowledge guarantees you a resurrection no amount of going to church guarantees you a resurrection and nobody believes in going to church more than I do nobody believes you go to church more than I do I've been out on a Sunday out or not in church I'm gonna say this to brag but it's just the way I was raised I've been out of church maybe two or three times in my life on a Sunday and and during those times you makes you feel bad and I am just the way I was raised and I understand it doesn't save me though it has nothing to do with my resurrection but I want to do it to honor his resurrection but our resurrection is the shirt not by going to church not by being a good person but because of the seal ready bet it's guaranteed to us some of y'all get a chance to go back and listen to that sermon the brother Andrew preached it at Living Word Tabernacle yesterday and he talked about how it seals in and it seals out not only seals you in but it seals the devil out I look and so and these things I had before that I had studied early so we could go to the meeting but I'm just so I was just so blessed by it and so our resurrection is a shirt but the Bible says it this way the resurrection is sure hey babe it's a guarantee and we have the earnest of it now as the Holy Spirit comes in and identifies us as God's redeemed person sister Vicky you can say I'm God's redeemed person I've been identified God put his stamp on me put a seal on me as tag on me I belong to him the scripture and the Bible talks about when when I gather my jewels and the idea there is is of God going through and I think I've spoken about it to you before but it's God going through all the jewels and picking out the ones that are his and putting them in his own corner in his own box in his own pile saying these are mine he identifies those that are his by the Holy Ghost hey Ben aren't you glad you can be identified in the earnest of your inheritance you don't have to worry you don't have to be afraid wonder am I going to go to heaven is gonna be a Resurrectionist I'm getting older is there going to be a resurrection if I if I go by way of the grave am I gonna make it the resurrection is sure it's a guarantee because we have the earnest of it now as the Holy Spirit comes in and identifies us as God's redeemed person he said when you receive the Holy Ghost you're sealed till the journey is over hallelujah you're sealed till the journey is over but the brand uses the analogy of a train which it's hard for us to understand because many of us know anything to do with trains now but some of the older folk man understand better but a train would be sealed a boxcar would be sealed up to its destination no one had a right to break that feel and your soul has been sealed you didn't seal your body filled your soul your soul has been sealed to your destination aren't you happy about it today if I'm guaranteed you know some of you have more faith in Amazon you do in God Amazon has a two day guarantee if you've got Prime I think it is got a two day guarantee some of y'all shop on Amazon I know you do got a two day guarantee sometimes that don't arrive in time does it better Joe sometimes the Amazon package doesn't get there when it's supposed to but there's a there's a guarantee and and you feel like you have an assurance that's going to happen and if it doesn't happen I found myself during the height of the coronavirus thing when there was all kinds of pressures going on I was impatient with Amazon because anything we ordered we didn't go out to Walmart so much we ordered it off Amazon like some of you probably did and so you order off of there and get it shipped to your home and if it didn't show up in two days because of the shipping delays that were going on and problems with the supply chain it kind of makes you a little angry I'll just be honest you you you had a guarantee two days it's supposed to be there and then they set it on your porch and if somebody feels you you get mad but it just sit there all day you know but look and then you do the chores you have a right to it you paid for it but how much more should we be assured that the delivery that the package of our soul that was sealed by the Holy Ghost will be delivered to its destination all of you if you traveled you probably lost luggage I've lost luggage I saw cartooning the other day that had a this irate customer that was was telling the airline what to do and where to go it and they're just acting up and here the the lady he doesn't know it behind the counter there's a button that says send the bags to Timbuktu and so as this customer is just being irate and the lady just pushes the button and the bags go to Timbuktu and that's why baggage gets lost a bit and we know that's not right why does it get lost because even the best supply chains don't always work even the best made plans fail and so you've experienced that and we get used to instant gratification but sometimes even the most guaranteed thing in life will fail we found that out recently that sometimes we can't guarantee anything but we can guarantee this that if he sealed you hey bet it doesn't matter if your mind goes it doesn't matter if you lose everything it doesn't matter Church it doesn't matter if you make a mistake it doesn't matter what happens God sealed you until the day of your redemption and he put a desire in you he knew you would overcome it's not that he he just pushes you through life or makes you overcome but he put something in you that's an overcomer he put something in you that there would be trials there would be struggles there would be thanks but he created you in such a way and he may cause you to come in such a way and he put his seal in you so that his spirit could overcome in you you are an overcomer we already when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry you don't have to worry sit well if we do the wrong thing we make a mistake we're gonna we're not gonna make it the package it's gonna reach its destination that package won't be open until it gets in this presence hey babe we can be assured there won't be nobody else there won't be no preachers hands on there won't be no people's hands on it but it'll be sealed until the day of our redemption are you with me now if you were sealed 60 years ago it still holds to its final destination 40 years ago it still holds yesterday it still holds to guarantee you've sealed till the journey is over that is your token that you hold it shows that your fare has been paid Hey you see he leaves his name on it and makes you a joint heir so you can't mess it up look it's in him that is she said your token that you hold that shows that your fare has been paid you are a redeemed character Satan has no business with you none whatever just pick up your token your ticket show him my healing is paid for my trip to glory Hey it's paid for amen and then we find that the manifestation of the word in our midst is a guarantee that his promises are true we have a guarantee people look at the message of something well it could be true and it could not be no it's a guarantee it's the fulfillment of prophecy God came down put his foot on the land of the sea we believe that there's an open book it's a fulfillment of prophecy Christ came down in our generation and there was the son of man ministry to all these things we look at even the discernment all those things was gone fulfilling his word yes William Branham was a man yes he made mistakes but God was fulfilling his word and it's a guaranteed us that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever but we take it even farther because you could look at that and say well that happened years ago but look at it today his manifestation in her midst today is a guarantee to us that he's still alive the fact that he sealed you the fact that he healed you the fact that he saved you the fact that he brought you to this place is a guarantee you he's been better to you than you've been to him he's been better to me than I've been to him you're sealed he said that is your token that you hold the shows that your fare has been paid I love the way he puts this you are a redeemed character he bet and somebody said well you're just a character that's true but I'm a redeemed character I may not do things like every other character but I'm a redeemed character and I have a redeemed character you're redeemed character Satan has no business with you I remember no business no business if he's on the door it's not your business be knocking not yours he delivers a package nope I got my sealed package not yours not mine I have no business for Satan I don't want anything to do with him that's what Paul said I keep under my body bring it under subjection listen having preached to others i myself would be disapproved because I don't want anything to cause Satan to have an involvement in my life are you with me now Satan has no business with you none whatever just pick up your token and show him my healing is paid for hey man my trip to glory is paid for now I want to take a closer look at the day that the abstract came back you they were all in anticipation and they were told in Luke 24:49 he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so they were waiting for something to happen they had to wait for that time now brother Ram teaches us in the message we don't tarry for the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is already here we don't tarry for it because it's already here but they waited for it what were they waiting on titled to be cleared although that work to be finished to be completed and now here they were on the day of Pentecost 50 days later they're waiting they go down there and wait until the day of Pentecost in and they wait there for 10 days and they were tearing waiting on the return of the abstract the price has been paid the the land has been conveyed it's already done finished but they still had to wait what were they waiting on the personal guarantee each one of them would receive a personal guarantee that the land not only belonged to Christ but that it belonged to them that the work was effective and we can't under sell the importance of the token or oversell the importance of the token we have to make sure that we understand how important this is because without it we have no guarantees with it we are completely assured of a guarantee now this was God's appointed time that the token would come I want to tell you today that the day of the token is here brother band said that in the feast of the trumpets or he talks about and I want to go through this kind of back up a little bit he talks about how that the Holy Ghost was bound but it had to be loosed and I think this is important because a lot of people misunderstand and think that while we're waiting on something we're not waiting on a return of the abstract they waited we don't have to we're here and we're not waiting on those things to be restored back to us they're here the message is here everything we have need of is here well then if we're waiting it's a personal thing we need to be assured ourselves of the Holy Ghost we need to be sure but we don't have to wait on God to do that we don't have to wait on God to have revival in our hearts we don't have to wait on something for there to be a church that's on fire for God we can have that now we got to wait on somebody to come by some man to come by so we can be healed we can have it today as the scripture says today is the day of salvation before the round talks about those demons that were bound with Euphrates River he said while this group down here has got 2,000 he said bound at the river Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000 years I think was 200,000 thousand or something like that and said it's been bound for 2,000 years also he said that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under martyred him back there and under the church edges has been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creed's and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because a man-made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back that's what the Bible said now I would ask you today is it still bound it can't be bound today or God sinning Malachi's for revelations in 7 was ineffective and that's where you go back to what I preached here how long ago he said well I find faith when I return and brother mentor said that was will Malachi 4 be fulfilled will revelation 10 seven Luke 17 30 be fulfilled we can look back on and say it has been fulfilled so he said she's coming back that's what the Bible said the third seal were the remnants of the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again wake her up notice the language Jesus wake her up see ya he'll send it he promised it and the people after that day we're looking for a great revival many of them still are now you find a generation that's raised up that don't even think they need revival in fact you'll find the melodic aromatics believe there's been a Great Awakening what they have now is a great revival I think it brings a bad name on revival because you look at any revival that ever happened any Great Awakening in this nation or any other nation when it happened it changed places they say that when the message of Wesley would reach a city that every the bar rooms would close and the city would clean up and the prostitutes everything else would be gone why because the message reached that city it was an awakening and we find that there hasn't been a Great Awakening like that and in this stay and but there was an awakening now look he said there hadn't been a bride revival but we're looking for it now but then he says in recognizing your day and his message he talks about I don't have time to read it all but he talks about how that brother more and then we're crawling out we need a prophet to return and he says why did they do that why did they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they've not recognized the awakening of the bride what about us have we recognized the awakening of the bride because if we recognize that we'd wake up I believe we're awake today but look if you're sleeping if you find yourself back slit if you fight it's not God's fault it's not to follow the message it's on me it's on you we find herself in a dry time we just need to get to the water the waters available hey Ben we find her just waiting like they did at the at the pool of a sinner they were waiting for the moving of the water not realizing that denominational pool would never be stirred again but Jesus come walking through there to the elected and said will you be whole do you want to be well amen and I believe he's done the same thing with the message of the hour today that he comes and wade through all the sea of people and he comes to your house and he comes to your house and he says do you want to be well you want to be well and something in you says yes take up your bed and walk hey Ben you don't have to be bound anymore why because there's been an awakening of the bride hallelujah they've not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a Christian they feel the pole of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you he said that's the same thing they did in the old days they was believing in the coming Messiah they believed that there would be a forerunner come but it was right on them and they didn't know it they didn't recognize it Oh church we got to recognize our day of visitation if God is moving in our mist if God is doing something we've got to be willing to let him do it let him do it let him move let him come in let him just sweep over your heart don't let prejudices or pride or some kind of indifference in your life some kind of malaise in your life caused you to miss the movement of God but if God is moving however simple it may seem it may be just the presence that we feel and maybe just we recognize God is there's an awakened gulf doing something let's move with it let's be a part of it let's recognize the awakening of the bride because the awakening is already here so right on them they didn't know what they didn't recognize it this as I said it's a token time but the bread and said the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days are you still with me this morning he said then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time said you get as the token never come into existence until the evening time I'll be honest with you I struggled with that with that quote for years and finally come to understand what he was talking about but I struggled with it because her abstract came back on the day of Pentecost but he said the token never come into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we live in is that this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me he said this is the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going he was only in his 50s but he recognized it he said this is the evening time for me this is evening to have our message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied are you hearing me this morning this is the guarantee that all that we've been talking about is true this is how we enforce our rights apply the token he said I told you lie Sunday I had something I wanted to talk to you about this is it the time when you can't just can't play with it and if you go back to that sermon I spent I don't know how many maybe 50 sermons on it talking about the token how that and going through that that sermon word by word with the church it and brother IVs and we went through it and as we went through it I began to realize this was urgent too brother Branham this was urgent he was seeing something in his own church that they just weren't catching it like they should they weren't catching this the token has to be applied he said I told you last Sunday had something I wanted to talk to you about the time when you just can't play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now because we can see that the Raps is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish look what's happened just over the last few days over the last few months we can see that the wrath is about ready to pass through the land as I said Wednesday night God has a cup a cup full of the wrath of his indignation a cup and that cup he said the wicked will drink the dregs of it it'll be that foul-tasting strongest part of the cup will be what the wicked will drink it's coming it may not look like it now but it's coming and we see the signs of it all around us if it's ever going to be done if we're ever gonna get serious with God if we're ever gonna get down to business with God it's now now it's not the time to give up on church now it's not the time to give up on go to the house of God now it's not the time to give up on worshipping God now it's not the time to give up after we've been through the coronavirus say well it doesn't matter anymore it does matter now's not the time to get up on us to give up while assembling together now it's not the time to give up on the preaching of the word now it's the time to stand up and be the bride that we're supposed to be now it's token time now it's the time that we stand up and say if it's ever gonna be done it's got to be done now Shamgar got so weak that he that he thought he just couldn't make it anymore he looked this little family so weak he said if it's ever gonna be done it's gonna be done now hey man he picked up a dog's coat said now is the time to do it now's the time to change my life now's the time to rededicate things now it's the time to take advantage of the blood lambs been provided there's been there's a blood ready there's there's food there for you to eat in your homes Oh a lamb a blood was placed on Rose a lamb there was blood there but they had to apply it they had to eat the lamb to have strength for the journey it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now because we can see that the wrath is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish I want you to notice also before we close the attitude of the believers toward one another at this time when the token came when the we say it this way the abstract returned they got the guarantee says they were all with one Accord in one place he said brother Ben when you go to quit preaching about this when we're all in one Accord in one place and I'm preaching it myself too but they were able to put aside their differences than they had differences enough to come together and say we need something we need to come together to create an atmosphere so that we can have what we need they were all in one Accord in one place I'm gonna preempt Peter back there I know that he's thinking that's a Honda Accord and it's not I was gonna hear that joke on the way home I know that's true but it's one Accord now what does that mean the definition of that and also the word in acts 1:14 which says though these all continued with one Accord in prayer and in supplication with women and Mary the mother of Jesus with his brethren they were all there the hundred and twenty it means with one mind with one Accord with one passion one passion have you ever been to a car show where they have these beautiful antique cars show cars you know those people don't have much in common although there's a bunch of rednecks usually at those places but there's rich people poor people there's middle-aged people old people young people and they're all there and and they all come together and iron out their differences and choose a winner among themselves which might be hard to do because each one thinks they want each one thinks they have the best but they all come together because they value something they have a passion for something they have a passion so they are come in one place so that they can share that passion so that they can they can come together and share the passion that they have how much more should believers be able to come together and put aside petty differences enough to fit together in the presence and in the coolness of the of the Tree of Life under the under the leaves that have been provided for the healing of the nations and the fellowship of the brother how much more should we be able to come together and sit down under the Tree of Life and say brother I have the same need that you do I have the same passion that you do I want to see my kids safe I want to see them receive the token I want to I want to see the law streets I wouldn't see the coming of the Lord so we have a passion that's alike you're from different places you come and drive for miles some of you from down in Arkansas and some from up in Missouri drive an hour or more to come to church I know what that feels like right now but you do it and you've done it maybe four years why there's a passion there's a passion in you something you want to keep the word alive in your heart so you come to church even if everything's it's not like you think it ought to be one may feel like the music should be this way one may feel like it should be this way one may feel like the preacher should be like this or one may feel like you should be like this but the passion is the same the passion comes and it pulls us together I have a passion to see don't you see that's what the Ephesus church lost when they drifted away they lost their passion for Holy Ghost meetings they lost their passion for the word they lost their love for God cooled off here that their love was was firm they were with one mind with one Accord with one passion don't you see that's what keeps you together it has a married couple and the passion that you have in a marriage than the natural passion will ebb and flow it will it'll come and go there'll be times you don't even want to see one another why do you stay together not just because of the heartbeat that's uttered the first time you saw her not because just you liked the way he smelled when you met him not because they were so handsome because what keeps the passion alive then in an old couple the Curtis have been married a long time some of the rest you've been married a long time what keeps the passion alive what keeps the passion what is the passion the passion is not the attraction the passion is your desire for one another not for the body but for the person you were meant to be together and you wanted to create something with this person it would be cold to home and you wanted to stay together for the rest of your life why that's a passion and many times we look at the other passion and say well that's gone what am I gonna do no there's got to be a passion for more than that and it comes down to the Christian has to have a passion for their husband or their wife that'll actually reach on out into eternity I have a passion that my wife and I will be there one day I have a passion for my children that they'll be there one day goes beyond natural feeling but there's a passion that I have to see us be together on that day a passion that we have with one Accord with one passion as a church a passion we have to see that God move in our midst but the banner said it as the days go closer and closer and the narrowing of the path we want to go closer together you see in this age of social distancing we've even had to separate people in the pews and different things but he said we want to go closer together we want to get closer together my said we must be just one one body we must move together move together forgetting one another sins and our differences and just sticking closer and closer and closer as we see that day approaching assembling ourselves together all with one Accord and one heart where do people get their brother branham didn't believe in church we see the Day approaching it's a days grow closer and closer we assemble ourselves together with one Accord in one heart and if a brother or sister gets out of the way in any way don't do nothing but pray for that person and in love always considering one another don't never let one of you get away hear me Church no never let one of you get away well they were insignificant they didn't mean anything no never let one of you get away that's incumbent on all of us not just on the preacher don't ever let one of us get away if we can help we do everything we can like Abraham to go after our lost brother don't never let one of you get away stay together if you can our lost sister if you and add more to it constantly all the time it's a mandate we have in this hour stay together and if you can I'd like to write the words on little on the wall stay together and if you can't add more to it constantly all the time Philippians 2 1 if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels or heart and mercies fulfil you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind that nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others they tell me that the Romans had a Romans or the Greeks wanted I don't remember which but they had a formation called the turtle and in that formation they would put their shield up but they wouldn't put it up in front of themselves they would put it up in front of their brother so that each man or their fellow their fellow warrior each man was responsible for his fellow so that each sheetal was in front of the net so you had to hope you had to you had to have the best wishes for the one standing beside you because the shield was him and that shield could move like a turtle with protection above and on each side but see there's one standing maybe towards the middle he's got his shield up here to protect from arrows from above he's got to rely on these people around him huh you realize that's what a preacher does a preacher stands and protects against this and he relies on deacons and trustees and housewives and people to stand around it people to stand around in and hold their shields up and if my brother gets hurt I don't want to leave his his place void I want to see that place filled brother branham speaking of that light that come in 1933 on the river he said do you know what brought these things to pass he's it was because brother Branham was who he was yes but he said this is what brought it to pass he said when I first started and the Lord appeared to me down on the river and told me that and but the veil saw that he said I believe in a paper in Canada many years ago where the angel of the Lord appeared on the river down there was on Associated Press mr. glide over local minister while baptizing he's sitting you know what did that when we had the tent meeting just across the street I listened he said this is what did that when we had the tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about 2,500 people ministers come from everywhere and said brother come here minute I was just a boy just a kid he said how do you keep those people in one Accord they love one another till I haven't seen people love one another he said that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon that godly brotherly love for one another he said I seen them even shake hands with one another my they were brave he said I've seen them shake hands with one another I'll shake your hand from here right now after preaches I may not want to see you have to church oh he said that I see that I've seen them shake hands with one another leaving the place and cry like babies to leave one another they loved one another that well and I could go to their house to visit them at times he said the Bible is saying open why did they have the love because they were dedicated at home huh I could go to their house to visit them and times the Bible was saying open it staying with tears coming at night time where fathers and mothers are gathered together and their little children around on the floor kneeling around and fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying I'd stand at the door and wait and wait and wait they even stopped praying I'll just sit down on the steps and start praying myself waiting for them he said they loved one another they loved one another we used to stand sing that old song blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love the fellowship of kindred - like - that above when we asunder party gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and I hope to meet again he said I say this was great joy in my heart to Christ many of them are sleeping around in these grave smart tonight waiting for that great resurrection that guaranteed resurrection there'll be some that I pastored years ago that I'll see and I won't recognize them maybe but they'll have to tell me who they are because when I know him they were nine-year they were a hundred but they went on to be with the Lord but they have a guarantee they'll raise again many they were sleeping around these graves bark tonight he said waiting for that great resurrection where we'll meet together again he said that not that spirit ever depart from this place listen to me that not that spirit ever depart from this place what spirit the spirit of love that brought about a meeting where some people would want to be baptized where God could vindicate his word and that manifestation of the Word of God was a vindication and a guarantee that God keeps his word I'm sorry I know I'm holding you long but just let me finish this quote he says I don't care he said if it ever does then I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the Word of God the Spirit of God has grieved away he said when we can have all things in fellowship in common love one another then God will work with us the only want him to work with us they knew they needed him jesus said go there and stay until you endued with power from on high don't we need God to work with us and brother brother said and we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really humble a church that really loves caught drop in up there at that Tabernacle one time and watch them hey man look at the care they have for one another the respect when the gospel is being preached how Reverend how everything is just an order yes he said then they can look and see what time we're living hey he said well make a look at the coronavirus they can look at something else to see what time no they can look at our law for one another and the care in respect we have for one another and it's a timepiece to show them what hour we're living in he said you'll see the Spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders things will be taking place he said if the thing is working together it's telling the time are you hearing me if the thing is working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then time has stopped see every one of us are essential to every church service whether we can be here or not whether things happen and maybe we can't we can't be here but God makes us essential if we're a part of the body we're essential to every service we've got to be praying we've got to be looking forward we've got to be doing things and helping and everything that we can when we're here we ought to just come with such an expectation of God in our heart why we're essential if it's not working together it's not telling the time but if it's working together it's telling the time if it isn't working time has stopped it won't tell the time no more he said so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time well we're living in I'll leave you with this love one another above everything that's the prophet of God speaking no matter what the devil tries to say you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let that stay that way he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target it brings some critic or unbeliever in sit him down cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poisonous stuff he'll start through the church with it I'm so grateful we've had some come sit among us since I'm so grateful there's not someone coming in as a critic but it's people coming in with love I'm grateful for that I'm grateful for that people just want a place to go to church I think God let more come they want to go have a place to go to church and worship God but sometimes there'll be a critic come in and he'll shoot everything yes to bring in to make his target it brings some credit sit him down cause him to fellowship he said he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff you know starts to the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man he'll be saved too or that won't matter ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another
