greatness of god cannot be overstated and we're so thankful for that tonight because there's nothing that is out of your reach nothing that you can't do and so we rest in that understanding tonight of the greatness of who you are and what you want to do with your people and through your people i pray that you move in this service lord that you just have complete control over my mouth and lord of what i'm saying over the years ears lord that you would have complete control in this service move me aside speak directly to your people tonight and we believe that you will heal every sick person touch everyone that's watching lord that couldn't be here tonight and i pray you'd bless them bless each one we pray we ask these things in your precious name amen amen do you love the lord this evening i know i asked you that a lot but i trust the answer will always be from the heart yes yes we love the lord amen genesis 49 27 and acts chapter 9 and verse 1 as we continue speaking on breaking the family curse we're finally getting down to the breaking part we've talked a lot about the curse and we're going to talk a little bit more about that but there is a way to break it but it's not by human effort but by the grace of god genesis 49 27 while you're turning there i uh had been listening to paradox the message brother branham preached in december 1961 and if you get a chance to go listen to that this week if you're just looking for a tape or or a sermon to listen to and get a chance to listen to that i think he'd do you some good he preached it several times but particularly the one that he preached there in jeffersonville in december 1961 i while listening to that i was inspired to something else completely different from this that we may speak on on sunday morning so it would go with that as well and then on sunday afternoon i i want to take a little time and explain to you maybe more in a sermon than just telling you but why we're are going uh on this mission trip that we plan on going out on on the end of the month and why we're doing it and and you know you do things and sometimes it's hard you can't explain everything but i i know that uh whenever we leave we don't want to be gone for long we like to be here with you but there are other sheep which are not of this fold and so we want to reach out as well when we have that opportunity and when the lord leads us to do that and and i believe that will be a blessing to you as well so we'll kind of try to explain ourselves on uh um well i will anyway i won't let joel have that opportunity but i'll do that anyway on sunday i'll be preaching to you a lot this month and you just pray for me and then next month i won't be preaching to you much at all because we'll be gone to egypt and then when we come back we'll have those meetings so remember the meetings july 14th through 17th and and be praying for those a lot of people coming in i've rented i know several folks have rented airbnbs and stuff in the neighborhood and and are coming in to be with us and so we're happy uh the lord willing will have those meetings and just be as best hosts we can be and also but we want to receive a blessing too and so i'm looking forward to that right after we get back all right uh we reading from genesis 49 27 benjamin shall raven as a wolf benjamin shall raven as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil and then acts chapter 9 and verse 1 and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul so why persecutest thou me he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening it came off i was trying to get the cap off the bottle i'm not very smart sometimes lighten up this evening a little bit can you all smile at me my goodness that's a tough crowd are you all tired tonight well we'll try to get you out of here for too long i know these boys have been on this roof are tired today i brother isaac i feel so sorry for you i'm sorry i called joel yesterday and he said oh i'm in the truck watching the guys work i said yes but how it is the scripture said benjamin will raven and that word means to terror to rend as a wolf a few years ago in 2017 there was some attacks in israel by wolves of the same type that would have been in that day that they would have been talking about woes in israel and there are still was in israel today and they were attacking human beings they were actually attacking uh infants and babies they were they would they would scout out an area a wolf pack would scout out some people who were camping or some bedouins in the desert or something like that and they would begin to watch them and they would try to make off with the infants or the babies that were there and it became increasingly common and they began to realize that the animals were not playing and they were not feeling threatened but they were actually hunting for small humans they realized they recognized them as prey and that's not normally that's not normal for animals usually even a snake will actually will only defend itself when threatened they won't hunt humans normally but a wolf if they're in the right frame of mind will do that and and actually they found that a wolf will the nature of a wolf is to kill anything that is weak it's to attack anything weaker than it is and so they found in yellowstone national park that sometimes there'll be a herd of elk and they'll get in the deep snow and they'll be walking through the deep snow and trying to trying to make it to be the middle of the winter and they're just about dead tired all of them and and the wolves will find them and they they'll kill what they need to eat and then they'll keep killing and they'll slaughter an entire herd of elk rather than just kill what they need like most animals would and the reason for that is because the nature of a wolf is if it perceives weakness it'll go after it now we know that's not the nature of a christian because christ the spirit of christ is to help those that are weak how many know that tonight but that's the nature of of a wolf and that was the nature of the benjamin the nature that run in this family's train if we could see it that way was to attack was to was to rend was to tear and when they smell blood like a shark wheel a wolf is like that they get excited by blood and they go after another weak animal and as long as they perceive them to not be a threat they'll kill them and so that's the nature that drove king saul if we go back to the to the old testament that drove king saul to persecute david you'll find after we left saul that he had he tried to uh throw a javelin at david and and jonathan came back and interceded to saul for david and he said hey he's never done anything to you you've got no reason to be like this around him and so saul said you know that's true and he repented of what he did and i believe saul was sincere in that yeah but he just had this nature and y'all bear with me tonight i i'm having a little bit of a problem with congestion so i'm trying tonight just as hard as i can that's why i didn't wear a tie too i know you're shocked but but i can't i have to be able to breathe so it's one or the others so but it's the nature that drove king saul to do this and so jonathan intercedes to saul and saul being i think sincere he says well let's let's get david back in and he repented of what he did and so in first samuel 19 6 saul hearken unto the voice of jonathan and saul swear lord liveth he shall not be slain and jonathan called david and jonathan showed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as end times past and verse 8 and there was war again now watch everything was okay for a while until there was another war and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him so so saul king saul looks at this and he says now here they are here he goes again he's going out and having these big meetings and doing these things and i just can't stand that and so he began to get jealous again and and he said and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he said in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of saul's presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night now if we could fast forward now think about this we fast forward a thousand years now let that sink in for a minute it's more than a a thousand years later see time doesn't change the strain in a family and that's why you have a child sometimes and he looks different maybe like little henry looks a little bit different from the parents and you look at that and think where did that come from and and then as a child you begin to look at them and you begin to realize well i knew great uncle so and so or maybe i'll talk to my mother sometimes she'll say you know you look like your great-uncle or great-great-uncle that i never met and but i look more like them than i do like my father because some of those genes skip generations and come on down and that's why every generation has to have their own revival right you don't you don't pass on christian genes to your children right they have to be the gene of god themselves and i believe that they are but that's not passed on naturally they have to receive the holy ghost just like we do they've got to sit in an atmosphere just like we did they've got to be be born by the spirit of god they've got to have a revival and that's why i'm never against the revival among the young people because every generation's got to have it they've got to have it we had to have it they have to have it and so but when you have a strain and a family you can't say well eventually we'll get over it someday it'll just it'll just pass on out well maybe it will and maybe it won't because some of these genes that are so strong and a family will just continue on down until finally they'll pop up years and years later and you'll see things in your children that maybe you didn't even struggle with but other people in your family did so eventually we'll get over it doesn't work there's got to be a paradox in your life a paradox in your life nothing else will break the curse but a paradox brother adam in in the message paradox he begins and he begins to explain i only have one quote tonight but it's quite lengthy but he said according to webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true it's something that seems incredible but it's true therefore a paradox then would be the same as a miracle right now now let's back up for a minute what happened saul king's soul persecuted david and that same spirit a thousand years later caused saul who was named after king saul you watch what you name your children right because it does matter and i don't think a child necessarily has to be named a biblical name but you name them something good right you don't want to name them something that that's bad and because brother branham said it mattered you say well i can prove to you it didn't matter well brother brown said it does so i'll i'll take his word on that and and he explained that there was much meaning in that in the name elvis and ricky and names like that and and so and today we've got all kinds of names but uh but now uh a paradox then has got to happen now he they named him after king saul and and here he was brought up and all of these things and we'll go through that in just a little bit and yet he does the same thing that king saul did without even trying to he doesn't have to try to do that he's got that same spirit those same genes that same he's a benjamite it's still carrying on all those years later don't think you're just gonna let it say well i got this little thing in my life but someday someday it'll be gone i'll get old i'll uh something there'll be something that'll take it away no deal with it take care of it now because it's not just gonna gonna get better hey man if there's sin in your life deal with it if there's bitterness in your heart deal with it that's why the scripture says today is the day of salvation don't wait till tomorrow deal with it right now deal with it if you have an unbelieving spirit if there's something in you questioning the message of the hour don't wait till you become a preacher don't wait until you until you become a deacon deal with it now make sure you have that crisis moment make sure you meet god on the backside of the desert now you need to deal with it because just putting it off it only gets worse now a paradox again has been he said would be the same as a miracle a paradox when something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind it's altogether incredible but yet it's proven true now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained he said a miracle is something that happens you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth he said now people today a lot of modernists believe the days of miracles are past they don't believe there is such a thing as a miracle yet i believe that the world is full of miracles i wonder what our life would be like if we looked at the world like that the world is full of miracles he said i believe the paradox is constantly he said for instance i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ how many born-again members of the body of christ do we have he said every amen that includes you that includes me every member of the born-again body of christ is a paradox in themselves amen he said i believe each one of you methodist and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth well i don't want to ever be like that i want to be a church on fire not a formal church he said it has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is the perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle amen so he goes further he said unless that happens you cannot be a christian there must be a paradox for you to become a christian because no one can change your spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of god and i've been dealing with some things even as a pastor and some things in my own mind and my own heart and i've been dealing with some things and as i begin to think about them by the day i begin to realize that there's some things that i can't change outside of being able to deal within the word if a person is not able to deal within the boundaries of the word then that you can't really change the way that they're thinking and on some level counseling you can counsel someone but if they're not born again that counseling can only go so far it can only help so much at some point you reach a point where you just can't do any more because you can't change the spirit in a man you can't make them do right or a woman or a boy or a girl you can't make you can't change them you can sit there and tell them and as a pastor you can tell them somebody even that you have confidence in but if they're convinced that it's not right or that it is right they may have confidence in you and they'll sit there and you'll tell them this is what you need to do and you just won't do it because there you can't change the spirit but if a person gets the new birth they'll follow the word right and then you can guide them they'll be guided to be able to be led by the ministry and so sometimes and brother john beduca was here with us and brother john's a good pastor he he deals with his church in that way and and he was telling me he said you know he said there's some times that you just have to pray he said there's some things that you can't talk somebody out of when somebody gets a spirit on him he said sometimes you just need to pray and pray earnestly for that person and so that that's many times true because and sometimes if we get the deal and sometimes you get deal with your children you think well i i'm just there's nothing i can say and that's probably true there's nothing i can say there's nothing i can do but you can pray and prayer doesn't maybe change things today it might but it might change things 20 years from now if the lord carries amen so prayer does change things just not in our timetable because god knows when the right season is for that seed to come to light so no one can change a spirit in a man and give him new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it it's a miracle now you think about it i've been in i've been in churches i've been in places here in other places where you preach your heart out and there's people there you know need to receive it and they don't get it and then there's other times you'll preach and it seems like it's just not much there but someone will come and give their heart to the lord and maybe many will come and several come and one will be give their hearts to the lord and and you look at it you realize something really happened in that person's heart and life and what what is it what is that it's god changed their life god brought them to an altar only god can give them new life we can preach it but only god can give them new life but it's god's method to preach the gospel that's the only way we can spread it is by preaching the gospel that's god's method is to preach the gospel maybe we'll deal with that on sunday night that's god's method of working that's what he does he didn't say that he would save the world by the internet do you know that he never said he would save the world by he never said he would go and go into all the world and and and type out sermons even give out books or tracks he said preach the word preach the gospel to every creature in power and demonstration so now but now it's some things you just can't change on your own but if the power of god could ever come down when the time is right it'll change and so you always so some people would react to that in a way because i know how some people think you know and and sometimes i'd like to think this way too but you can't afford to and that's kind of like well if i can't if i can't affect what time people change then i'll just wait and i won't really do anything i'll just keep keep doing this and just treading water until the time comes but that's not what we do we don't just tread water but we give every effort every time because we don't know right that's much effort on a wednesday night it's on a sunday morning as much effort as when there's 20 people when there's 100 people as much effort as when they're whatever it is whatever whether we're preaching here overseas or somewhere else i don't put any less into a sermon any less steady time to preach to you on a wednesday night than i would to go preach about the tim's or preach some other church that has a larger congregation i don't put any more effort into that in fact i put less in because you've heard it before but it's just the truth wherever i want that opportunity see we can be birthed by the word and those of you who have a new birth you can be refilled with the holy ghost you can be helped by the spirit of god you can be helped by the preaching of the word but we've got to keep our our shoulders to the wheel right so no man can no one can change the spirit of man give him a new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it it's a miracle how that god can take a man's faking and his ways and his life and everything aren't you glad god changed everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it he said for instance a few days ago and i've used this illustration of this story before but i just wanted to read it the way that he said it here he said a few days ago i was called in on a scene and now this is the same quote we're just continuing on he said on a scene or on a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl a very fine little girl out of a fine family it was actually brother branham's family the boy was his nephew i believe he said this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he actually stood the girl up on a date he was i believe he was going to take her to church and he didn't take her he took someone else he said he did something wrong to the little girl and much has promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it watch that amen if a person can be confronted by the word and not apologize that's a problem and i don't care if it's your kids that confront you because sometimes they do dad you know better than act like that it don't matter if it's the church confronting the pastor or the kids confronting or the pastor preaching the word and you hearing it if you're confronted with the word you realize lord help me i know i don't do that but i know it's true or i know i do that but i know i shouldn't do that and and then you you apologize you repent of that but it's a sign there's something wrong when we're confronted with it we know it's right but we won't do it he said now it's he said it's not easy to do sometimes and now he said it wasn't in him to do it the father mother called me to the scene said we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy he said no it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest he said therefore the boy was a christian as far as a believer he had repented and had been baptized at his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had he said you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it listen yeah i i try to avoid hard subjects on wednesday nights on purpose listen if our lives don't cope with the word that's the evidence of the holy ghost that we can say amen to every word and if we're if we're confronted with it and we evade it or we we walk away and just shake our head and say well i'm not going to do that because i don't feel good doing that and it's not me there's something wrong either we never had the holy ghost or the holy ghost has lost its influence in our life because of backsiding either one of those circumstances are dangerous we need to come back to the fountain church i do many times i do now look he said i believe and he said uh no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shouting whatever you might lay it upon which is all right i believe in all that too brother branham did he said but unless your life copes with your testimony you haven't got it he said because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is jesus said by their fruit you shall know them he said now this young fellow's parents his mother is german we probably have germans in here i know we have germans in here tonight people of german heritage he said his mother is german he said no reflection on the german but there is a strain in that family he said and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face he said this girl's sister the mother this boy her sister so this boy's mother's sister his aunt he's talking about her now he said i've come down the street many mornings this young lady be setting out in the yard and i'd say good morning to you and she'd just look at me and i'd stop and i'd say sure a fine morning he said she would just stand look right at you an intelligent woman and i'd say come up to see us sometime she'd just stand and look he said well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way he said now the father of the boy is strictly an irishman that was brother branham's side of the family he said moody and high tempered high strung he said his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted i like the way he put that one other out of the family converted he said this father and mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they now now remember this is important he said they were both christians and they brought this young men up in the way of the lord so they didn't do wrong sometimes we over blame ourselves is that a word overblaming we give ourselves excess blame right the child has to receive the holy ghost for themselves you got to promise that they would be there right what happens in between you don't know all right there's no promise of that but you have a promise they would be there because you and your house will be saved i'm holding to that promise aren't you amen but now here this boy he said this young man his father mother both christians they brought the young man upright now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along their very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa must have not been a nice kid he said but the girls the mother's family lives close to he started to say i think the tabernacle he says a fine church he said but do you think they'd ever come over there no he said they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning he said they just won't do it it's just not in them oh my you realize what a serious thing that is church that's not what i'm preaching on tonight but you realize if that if that's something that you deal with you have a hard time doing that you need to overcome that because it'll keep you from the holy ghost it'll keep you from church it'll keep you from loving the people of god he said now the genes and the father and the mother of this boy said no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh someone say the flesh okay pop quiz what what good is there in the flesh what did paul say nothing there is nothing good about the flesh well i'm predestinated not the flesh we go back and talk about that if you want to we can we can preach about it or we can study it and study it out but it's not the flesh it's inner man huh it's the inner man there's a that's a new creation that's born again that can't fall right but the flesh there's nothing good in the flesh and so nothing good and nothing good come together and have a child right because you don't have them in the spirit all right they're born after the flesh we don't have spoken word children so the children are born what are they nothing good oh my that's just hurting you with them little babies when they're so sweet but they'd go to heaven like that it's when they get older you know but when them genes start to manifest themselves now look now he said he said therefore he said the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands and i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up now look this was this was a boy was raised right went to a prophet's church part of a prophet's family did not have the holy ghost yeah right and so it looks like a minor thing that's a minor thing and maybe if it was our kid we'd defend him and that's what the parents did by the way defended their son but we defend him but yet a prophet of god could look at that and i won't be looking at you and telling you oh you don't have the holy ghost because it's more difficult for me i can only look at the outside fruits brother branham could actually look at the motives or the the thoughts he could he could perceive the thoughts of the boy's heart and he could see why he did what he did more so than what i could see right but only god knows the heart but brother brown could see being a prophet more than what i could see and yet if you have those fruits in your life there's something wrong right that would make you stubborn and not not apologize and do things like that that are harsh to people and not not make it right and so he said i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting brother branham's family he said now look at your family to the mother he said there are a bunch of people just sit there won't speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you aren't you glad for the blood of jesus christ it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers you're sweet kind and forgiving what does that and your tree he said part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost he said that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you hey man i said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth i said how moody and high tempered and high strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ in you i said now that same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ water baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he has regenerated born again i've advised listen where he takes this i'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in he said then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother yet in his intellectuals he is trying his best to overcome it he can't do it you realize with our family tree joel if we could just look back at ours us being married to our wives as long as we've been proves that something's taken place proves to us anyway you don't know all my family but just being able to get along with your wife is not something that comes automatically in the pruitt family tree but why are we so different they say well do you have problems absolutely i used to say because we fight very little my wife and i we fussed very little but i used to be able to say i'd never had a a fight with my wife never never had a fuss with my wife and i've i've never never hit my wife i don't mean that kind of fight you got to watch what you say from the pulpit but i mean just verbally just just getting angry i could there was one time i could say i'd never been angry with my wife and that's not true anymore but it was probably months after we got married and well no i did get angry on our honeymoon i forgot about that sorry about that hun it was months later before i got angry again i used to say we never fight and that's i realize that's kind of portraying an image that's not exactly true because we'd still do that but there's a dominating force you know how hard it is for me to say i'm sorry it's hard it's difficult to tell people i need help very difficult but jt told me years ago he said ben you're more personal in the pulpit than you are out of it i said that's generally true because under the anointing sometimes you you expose yourself a little bit more than what what you would and to the people but i'll tell you this it's difficult for me naturally to do that but it's the power of god that grabs a hold of my human nature and bridles my tongue and bridles my temper are you hearing me bridle you you experience that you know what that's like you're about to say it by the joe and you're about to do something you're about to say something and the holy spirit comes in or maybe you do say it but you're angry and you don't sin because you repent amen aren't you glad for a god like that but i would say this if you're a young person especially if things run in your family you're gonna have to fight that don't just assume that it's right this is the way things are done fight that be different now brother brown said he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god he said i've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of a holy ghost revival after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the pulpit preaching the same thing he once hated it's a paradox how that god can take the unbeliever and make a believer out of him now we're getting to saul tonight he said i wonder if a man thinks that miracles has passed i wonder what kind of a scientific medicine you could give such a person to change that disposition in them to take that hatred and malice and strife out there is no one can explain it he said but it's a paradox because it's a miracle of god when a man has changed from the person that he is to a new creature in christ jesus he becomes a new creation he is no more what he used to be he is absolutely a new creation can you say amen to me tonight amen to the word amen saul of tarsus was born around 10 a.d and lived around 57 years he was born in tarsus 961 miles from jerusalem born a roman citizen he had social status and wealth he was in the upper echelon of what we would call the society of that day at least in the upper middle class he gives us a glimpse of his life in philippians chapter three and verse five circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin hebrew of the hebrews it's touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless how many men of that day could even say that history tells us that he was under gamaliel for eight years and in jerusalem and then he returned to tarsus for a while which is why he missed the ministry of jesus he was then either elected to the sanhedrin council or was being groomed for that position as one of the brilliant young men that was coming in in the upper echelon of jewish society and in acts 22 and 3 he said i am verily a man which i'm a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and you know his parents had wealth and money because they transported him all the way paid for him to go to school all the way in jerusalem which was in that time a very very long journey and he was taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers was zealous toward god as ye all are this day speaking to those jewish people he said i persecuted this way into the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women it's also the high priest to bear me witness what a testimony paul was yes he's standing there as paul who was saul the persecutor he's standing there and say the high priest knows that he gave me letters he said in all the estate of the elders that would be the sanhedrin council from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto unto jerusalem to be punished listen to me that this man could be converted is truly a paradox see the but what's the difference now think about it we've went all through the life of saul and we've looked at him and how that family strain come out and it comes out a thousand years later in in saul of tarsus same family strain how is he ever going to end up any differently how is he going to avoid that oh my let me bring it down how are you ever going to avoid that how are you ever going to end up any differently how am i ever going to end up any differently listen the difference was the cross on this side of the cross saul of king saul could not overcome his benjamin heritage could not the difference was not the time only in that the time in that time christ was crucified on the cross rose again on the third day amen and the fact i hope you hear me tonight church the fact of a risen jesus christ made the difference between saul king saul and saul of tarsus one came bc in 1000 bc one came in a.d that made all the difference think about it they were both men of god they both went to heaven but our goal here as the bride of jesus christ is not just to make it by the skin of our teeth to heaven right our goal is to be good stewards of the mysteries of god we're not put here on the earth just to make it by the skin of our teeth we're put here to be good stewards of the mysteries of god to be a church that is just like that first church to be the representation of god on the earth today to be what god called us to be to be the overcomer of the lay of the sea and age that's what you and i were called to do and if there's going to be something that overcomes that makes us overcome our past that causes us to overcome our family history if there's going to be something to do that it's going to take the cross no matter how educated in the message you might become no matter how how good you are no matter how well you were raised no matter what family you were born to no matter who your pastor is what your last name is the difference is the cross the difference today is the same as it was then you've got to meet christ yourself and that will make all the difference saul of tarsus is just as stubborn as king saul just as bloodthirsty just as violent so how do you say that he said it in first timothy 1 15 he said this is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief he wasn't being humble look what he says next how be it for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering amen once paul was converted he realized the very first time that he ever was stubborn against god the very first time that he ever threw one of them people in prison the very first time he ever run down the people of god the very first time he ever condemned christ and condemned the way of the people of god and condemn christianity he realized he should have been struck down then but something grabbed a hold of him something waited on him amen something kept him through that time what was it the long-suffering of god amen he said for a pattern he said he might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern amen paul was the pattern for who to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting paul is the pattern not only for the messengers of the age but also to every believer today amen do you believe that today he's a pattern of grace we don't have to be bound by our family history we don't have to be bound by the curse that the devil laid on us we don't have to be bound to what our genes say we should be yes sir we don't have to be that we're something more brother steward we're the bride of jesus christ amen we've come to a different place hallelujah we've come to a a grace and not a law a place where we can find help in time of need a place where there's a mediator a place where we have an attorney who was also the judge a rigged court and saw amen could stand before god and god said you never did it in the first place oh my we find saul as a young man standing and watching the stoning of stephen we won't go through all through this tonight we'll just kind of touch the high points and and finish on this and then we'll maybe get back into it in acts 6 and 9 he said then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and the cyrenians and the alexandrians and them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen you bible students you mark that cilicia celestia that is the place where tarsus is that's what saul's country and so they had their own church their own synagogue of like-minded well-educated if we could say hellenistic jews is what they were called they were jews who were educated as greeks and yet followed the law to the letter they were well educated and so they became the ones who disputed with stephen it was paul's church where he went to church those would have been his closest friends stephen at that point begins to preach he was a deacon he began to preach one of the greatest sermons ever ever recorded he starts out and he goes all through the history ends up calling them wided walls and a few other things and he gets down to the end of that sermon and the bible says when they heard these things in acts 7 54 they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth i've never preached a sermon that hard yet i've had people gnash their teeth but not on me thank goodness verse 55 but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven he didn't respond back in kind but he saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul saul never tried to hide that by the way he never tried to hide what he did they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with the loud voice of the lord lay not this sin to their charge when he had said this he fell asleep i love the beauty of that he's being stoned but he fell asleep and saul was consenting to his death what that word means is that he was in favor of it he wanted it to happen he didn't pick up the stone but he was that was his church that did it and he put his stamp of approval on it and even went as far as to say i'll hold your coat well you stone him saul being destined perhaps to be the high priest or or be a great man like gamaliel in the in the sanhedrin of that day he couldn't do it himself but he put stephen to capital punishment by consenting to his death maybe if he'd spoke up maybe if he'd have stood in his defense like gamaliel did later for peter and john maybe if paul had done that there wouldn't have been a first christian martyr named stephen but he stood there as saul of tarsus consenting to the death of stephen it says and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem this pack of wolves began to go after the weak they were all scattered except except the apostles and devout men carried stephen to his burial made great lamentation over him as for saul he made havoc of the church if you go and you can look up on the internet and you can see how wolf will go down that line of elk and you can see the dead elk just laying there not eating just killed wreaked havoc entering into every house hailing men and women committed them to prison the word havoc means he injured the church he arrived like a wolf he slashed and he cut he did everything he could to defeat the gospel aren't you glad the gospel cannot be defeated how did this man become the apostle to the gentiles a messenger of grace remember go back if you were listening if you were here or if you watched some time ago we read where king saul said he was the least of the tribe of benjamin you remember that when they come to him they ask him to be king he said he said i'm the least of the tribe of benjamin my family is is the smallest it's the least of the whole tribe i'm the least the benjamites are the least of the tribes and i'm the least of the least and remember how he said that that become a something in his mind that he felt that way and was good as long as god could use it but then he become arrogant in it because he felt like he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and and yet he had this insecurity which become an arrogance because it was overcompensated for because he could never overcome that well saul of tarsus had that same insecurity but now watch something got a hold of him because he comes back in first corinthians 15 9 says i am the least of the apostles watch i'm not me to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god people would just like to take one quote or one scripture could shut the door so we don't have to listen to paul but look at the next verse but by the grace of god you know there's some scriptures that fit certain people malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 fit certain people we can find ourselves in there and and yet they've mostly fit one person this fits all of us this fits all of us because paul was the pattern of grace amen he said i was i'm not mean to be called an apostle remember that was where that was where saul was and god used him for a while like that and then he got arrogant he said but by the grace of god i am what i am how do you overcome insecurity how do you overcome arrogancy this is the right balance no false humility no insecurity no arrogance or pride disgrace amen by the grace of god i am what i am how many can say amen to that tonight by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain he said i'm not going to deny what god's done in my life i don't care how bad you feel about yourself how much you feel like you're the least of the preachers or or the least of the deacons or the least of the churches you got to recognize the grace of god has done something in your life you may have the least family you may have the worst track record in the past but the grace of god has done something in your life and you should be able to raise up and say by the grace of god i am what i am and the late and the grace that he bestowed upon me was not in vain because i recognized myself to belittle i recognized myself to not be able to do it on my own and so i labored more abundantly than they all but even when i labored it was not me but the grace of god which was with me amen amen that's the gospel amen there's the right balance no false humility no insecurity no arrogance musicians go ahead and come just grace we went through this and i don't know we we're nearly done we may be done but how does that strain ever get broken by the grace of god and that grace is expressed in your life as a new birth and that new birth makes you act like a christian makes you do things beyond your own abilities you say i somehow i've labored more abundantly than all of them but it wasn't me i won't deny what god's done in my life but it wasn't me brother branham said it that way he said i i won't deny what an angel said to me at the river i won't deny what he said he said i'm no prophet he said i won't deny what he said amen i'm the least of all amen take it down now our prophet he said i'm the least of all the preachers not even a preacher he said but one day he said if you make it to heaven he said you'll find me there he said when you hear he said you see a little cabin down by the river he said and you see you hear amazing grace how sweet the sound he said i made it by grace hallelujah let's bow our heads together heavenly father was so grateful for the grace of the almighty god so grateful for the for the times when we were beyond hope oh god [Music] yet even in that moment as we said sunday night there was a place for us at the table [Music] saul didn't realize it's all of tarsus but there was a place for paul the apostle already at that great table but that meeting in the air it was already a place made he didn't know it but one day he began to realize what you'd done for him and when he realized that he he just couldn't hold back even though they stoned him and they persecuted him and he was shipwrecked and left for dead yet he found himself one time in the prison been beaten laying there in the muck in the darkness of the inner prison [Music] sitting there with silas with stalks on his feet and he began to sing a song of rejoicing because no matter what happened to paul he was no longer solved no matter how many times he got sick and how many times he got weary and how many times he was troubled no matter what happened to him what he went through he was no longer saul it was paul the apostle he could stand there and say i am what i am by the grace of god help us to recognize that today lord help us to know that and though our feet may be in stalks of prison we begin to sing at midnight raise our voice lord to you raise our worship to you lord we may be the least of all the preachers the least of all the churches the least of all the people but we can't deny what you've done in our lives we can't deny that you are a great god you are not bound by our weaknesses but you lord make a way there's room there for you to begin to move we thank you for that lord i pray that you move in every heart lord if there's one that hasn't overcome hard help them to know that it's only the by the cross will they overcome only by your grace will they be able to do that and i pray lord that they would take advantage of that help us to be humble or to listen or not to be stubborn oh god help me lord i recognize lord even in my own family there's a trait of that we can be stubborn oh god help me not to be like that save me from myself lord i find when i when i'm fighting when i begin to rank my enemies in order i always put myself at the top lord because i'm my greatest enemy before anything else it's me lord standing in the need of prayer i pray lord that every one of us would recognize that today lord and that we would bow to your omniscience we can't overcome on our own but lord if we can recognize the devil by your word and speak the word back to him lord we can overcome in this evil hour that we live in lord we thank you for your overcoming power thank you for the blood thank you for grace thank you for what you've done in each one of our lives lord as maybe memories tonight go back and see what we were what we would have been but by the grace of god there go lord what are we now lord that gives us grace for others who maybe fell along the way lord they're not beyond your grace today just as saul of tarsus was not beyond becoming paul the apostle lord you hold us to what what we need and we thank you for that what you need from us i thank you for that i pray you bless these people keep us constantly in your grace we pray in jesus name amen thank you lord jesus [Music] oh don't you want to just worship him a minute church oh he's so good [Music] i know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen let's stand and sing it one more time with all your heart now oh [Applause] [Music] just take off the tiredness for a moment tonight he's worthy of it he's worthy of our praise just give it to him for a moment let him have a few minutes you gave the bank a few minutes today you gave your work several hours you you gave eating a few minutes give him a few minutes today give him a few minutes let him work in your life let the word soak in tonight [Music] hallelujah oh i'm so grateful lord by the power of your love hallelujah [Music] oh bring me near you [Music] thank [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you lord jesus give him a hand of praise tonight hey man joel ah i'm not giving up can we do that can we try that tonight amen hey man are you ready to keep going hey man doesn't the word give you strength to keep going amen i shall overcome i'm not giving up i'm going to make it amen well i'm not giving up oh i'm not turning around by the grace of god i wear a shining ground someday i keep holding on to that nail scar handle through this veil of tears ridiculous times i even questioned even if my lord was near that old tempter he says why not turn around well you can't get any farther because you're just losing ground oh but i'm not giving up hey man take that oh i keep holding on oh [Music] second verse now before we go oh would you mind to tell me why is it that old devil they just won't let god's children be you see he has purposed and determined to get it right in the way and turn us from the way of life and lead our souls to stop doing your message i'm not giving up hallelujah [Music] oh yes i'm not turning round oh by the grace of god i'll wear a shining crown someday thank you lord oh i'm not turning right hallelujah i have a grace of god i'll wear a shining crown someday oh but i'll keep holding on [Music] to that nail scarred hand no i'm not giving up no
