willing lord to say what you'd have me to say i pray you'd grant it bless these people lord may we not leave the same condition that we came in i pray we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you tonight turn with me if you would turn with me to matthew chapter 12. thank you brother alan matthew chapter 12 and verse 39 matthew chapter 12 and verse 39 i want to tell you that if you're not here tonight you'll want to watch this and not because i'm preaching but it'll give you a better idea of where we're going maybe in in the future on wednesday night uh maybe just for the next couple of services i don't know yet but i want to talk to you about jonah and we're going to talk to you about about jonah's life as a prophet and what he did and what he said and what the lord did through him and we'll deal with that maybe for a few services so you want to listen to tonight so you kind of get a background for where we're going just going to lay the foundation tonight matthew 12 and 39 says but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here i want you to realize tonight that the men of nineveh were gentiles non-elect think about it but the men of israel were the elected nation of god and he said the men of nineveh the non-elect will rise in their with this generation and condemned this generation who were supposedly the elect of god and because they repented this generation didn't oh my what a thought tonight god bless you may be seated i'll start preaching before i let you be seated that wouldn't be a good thing the name jonah has become kind of a bad word to the modern age and even in ancient times sailors who read this story if they had someone in the boat that was considered kind of a jinx and was clumsy they'd call him a jonah and they'd kick him out and get rid of him and so there was an element that was identified with jonah as being somebody who was bad somebody who uh had disobeyed god and he did that and somebody who moved away from god and he did that and yet jesus did not did not talk of him did not speak of him in that way at all but jesus spoke of him as a sign and showed his life in a bigger picture that his life was actually a sign of the son of man and that it was a sign of the resurrection and so he said i'm going to show you he said i'm going to there's a generation that'll be seeking after a sign there won't be a sign given to it except for the sign of the prophet jonah and then we know that we can tie that to our h that that was the sign of the resurrection of a living jesus christ that came in our day through a prophet named william branham that we actually saw that god had that jesus raised from the dead and he proved it in our generation and so in that way jonah was a precursor or a preview of our day now again it's become kind of a bad word but brother branham kind of always takes up for jonah in most of it but then he also identifies where jonah ran from the presence of god and if you'll go and listen to that sermon a man running from the presence of god you begin to see that that there was jonah who was doing wrong yet in the bigger picture god was using him as a sign of something else so i want you to know tonight that jonah's ministry teaches us if you're writing this down or if you can keep this in your mind it teaches us about purpose and providence purpose and providence you have a purpose in your life now it also teaches us about perfect will and permissive will how many have ever heard of that before perfect will and permissive will there's a difference in purpose and providence there's a difference in perfect will and permissive will but i want to start up front tonight with telling you that we should never seek the permissive will of god there has there was a day when god winked at that ignorance but now he calls all men to repent this is the hour when there's going to be a bride who's in the perfect will of god in our day how many believe that today we're supposed to be in the perfect will of god and yet we can see in our lives sometimes we've done things that we've made mistakes and we've done things and we can find that even in those times brother branham said he makes his his permissive will glorify his perfect will and i've put it this way in the past but it's always struck me that somehow his permissive will made his perfect will more perfect now i don't understand that because i'm not god oh but aren't you glad that you serve a god who is so great that when you disobey him and you do the things that you weren't supposed to do that ought to give us comfort tonight that even his permissive will is so great that he can actually use it to make his perfect will more perfect to glorify his perfect will oh my what a god we serve tonight amen i just love getting into the word don't you because these things really reassure us and build us up now jesus identified his life as a sign brother branham says god never changes he said he always does it in the same way he said the coming of a prophet is a sign you got to catch up with me joel this is joel's first night running the slides he says the coming of a prophet is a sign that god is ready to speak the coming of a prophet is a sign that god is ready to speak see the pentecostals in our day saw the sign of a prophet but didn't recognize that god was ready to speak so now but we realize that prophets don't always know what their sign exactly means especially not early in their ministry they don't always understand it even the greatest prophets did not fully understand their own life and impact and i want you to know tonight that it's okay if you don't fully understand what god's doing in your life you don't see the big picture right because it changes every day you don't know and you you know that but it gave from recently that brother gabe was praying about something that looked like it was completely wrong and it looked like that the will of the lord had moved in a different direction and then suddenly it turned around that's the way our lives are we we don't know what we don't know brother jt we would have never guessed that we'd have ended up here right you'd never guess that this would things would happen the way they have and we don't know we don't always know and that's okay you're just acting out the drama you don't have you don't have the road map that he has you don't have necessarily all see all the parts like he does he's in a higher position he's able to see it and a prophet in our day could look and see some of those things but in your own life as an individual many times you don't understand what god is doing but he still does it anyway amen amen even though you don't understand he realized david when he stood there and he said my my bones they stare at me he said they pierced my hands and my feet he thought he was talking about himself he thought they said this is a strange thing to say he did not understand but god still did it anyway he didn't understand why he went through what he went through but god was showing something in his life jonah may perhaps didn't even understand why he was swallowed by a whale why you had to go through what he went through but god used it anyway for his own glory amen amen so the greatest prophets don't always understand their own life and impact how are we going to and when you try to figure everything out and figure out your impact in the world and your place in the world you need to know your place but you need to know your place in its simplicity when you try to figure everything out and you try to dwell on what's going to happen tomorrow constantly you end up in trouble because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow you're trying to arrange the will of god and god knows more than you do that's what jonah was doing he's trying to change what he knew god told him to do he's trying to make it into something else but that never works now i want you to know and i want us to think tonight like jonah would have thought so in order to to fully understand him i think to maybe be more sympathetic towards him we'd have to think like he thought and in order to think like he thought it may not be too hard for some of us because we think a lot like the the jews did in one way and that's that they understood that they were the elect they understood that they were god's people now remember they were elect as a nation we were elected as individuals but they understood that they were god's people they knew that we know that today in deuteronomy 7 and 6 moses told him he said thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth boy that sounds pretty good don't it walk around to the moabites and the and the and and the amalekites and all the other heights that were out there and say i'm an israelite god told me that i was special god told me i was i was a special people we're a special people we're above all the people that are upon the face of the earth but he goes on to explain it he said the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you are the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers that the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god why aren't you glad he's faithful today know that the lord is faithful which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations and repeateth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face so they could see this and see we're special people these ninevites are are non-elect they're not god's people we are so israel was abraham's natural seed i just realized joel that that quote wasn't on the sides i was giving you a hard time about amen israel was joel's good for me because it's comic relief while i'm preaching israel was abraham's natural seed let me understand that tonight we're the spiritual seed of abraham i know this elementary but we're going somewhere building something abraham was god's man right abraham come out and and he was just an idol maker his father was an idol maker and had a god shop and abraham walked in he was just a normal uh guy just of the earth he was a gentile he wasn't anything special but god called abraham he called abraham he was god's man and in genesis 12 1 the lord said to abram get thee out of that country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation now notice he doesn't say now if you do this to do everything right i'll make him be a great nation and if you will if you'll do this i'll do this no he says get out of your country because i will make it be a great nation i will bless thee make thy name great thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families to the earth be blessed and abraham must have thought this is a pretty good deal amen now brother branham says god had a covenant with adam the first man on the earth and that covenant was on conditions if you do so and so i'll do so and so adam would have had something to do now listen in order to keep the covenant alive before god he'd had something to do he had to walk in god's ways keeping all of his word not breaking one word now doesn't that sound familiar because we're to do that we're supposed to do that but the covenant is not conditioned on that god said i will make you a bride that will not fall i will make you a bride that will keep my word that will not break one word he said i will have a bride oh that gives me confidence today it's not up to me or any other preacher to preach you into a level of being that that's what he said he would do by the message of the hour hey man so we just preach his word and keep moving on because it's his promise that he has to keep he's obligated to keep his promise now notice he said so you're keeping all of his word not breaking one word but then he made another covenant that was with abraham this covenant was not on conditions but was unconditionally god gave the covenant to abraham no strings tied to it at all now think about that for a minute no strings no strings abraham if you go to church three times a week and jump up and down and shout and holler and run the isles that's not what he said no strings oh my we don't do those things because we have we do it to fulfill our part of the covenant that's not what it's about we don't have meetings to well we've got to have so many meetings a year and run around so many places a year so that we can fulfill our part no we do that because we love god because we want to do the perfect will of god we don't want to be in the permissive will of god we want to be in his perfect will so we strive to keep his perfect will but it's because he made an unconditional covenant with us and jonah would have understood this i'm the elect my people we were made an unconditional covenant now look he said not no strings tied to it at all unconditional not i not he said i i will i have i've already done it now israel was very very aware of this deuteronomy 10 and 14. behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens i want you to notice this because one of the things about the book of jonah and i'm thinking faster than what i can what i can speak here but some one of the things about the book of jonah is that the book of jonah tells us that god cares about more than just us he cares about things that go on among the non-elect right and so sometimes he will make it hard on the elect for the benefit of the non-elect now that seems difficult for us that is difficult for us to understand but sometimes god will make life harder you can see it all through the scripture on the elect for the benefit of the non-elect he cares about even the non-elect it's not that he doesn't care and this is what moses is saying deuteronomy 10 14 behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord thy god lord thy god the earth also with all that therein is so he said it all belongs to me the elect the non-elect it's all mine does that make sense it's all under my command he could put he can do to it whatever he wanted to but brother brandon said it was like a woman that took a piece of cloth and was sewing he said she would take a pattern put it over the cloth and cut out the pattern he said from the same material amen this part would be the chosen the elect and the rest of it would be the rest the part that was cast off so now they were aware again of this and he said but he said the lord owns the earth he owns everything only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord had chosen me to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth david put it this way in psalms 33 12 blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he had chosen for his own inheritance he has a right to do that god has a right to have kids see it that way to choose who he wants to be his own children just like you do but now being chosen by god you would think that the israelites would have things easy and if you look at the history of the jews of the uh of the israelite people you'll find that they had things maybe more difficult than any other group of people that's ever lived on the face of the earth they're hated everywhere they go and the jews have always understood that being chosen was a blessing but also a burden it was a great honor a source of respect and honor but also a great responsibility because it was their job to to reflect god who the true god was to the world right he come to abraham into his seat and said all these all these other folks are worshiping gods many gods great spirits sons moons all these other things but i'm going to reveal to you what if god come to you and he said i'm going to reveal to you how to really worship me now that would not be a source of pride that would be a great that would be a great responsibility a great responsibility because now it would be incumbent on you whether people knew who god was and how god was represented on the earth and sometimes they failed miserably at that because when they were supposed to be representing jehovah they went after many other gods when they were supposed to be representing jehovah they messed up and they they they served other gods and they went after and god time and time again had to bring them back they were his chosen people but he had to he had to bring plagues and he had to bring sicknesses and he had to bring he had to bring all kinds of things on him all kinds of judgments on his own people to try to get them back in line and yet they would never be forsaken until finally in paul we get an understanding and i don't have time to go back and and look at all of these scriptures but just to kind of give you an overview tonight and then we'll get into it but in paul we have an understanding that not all israel is israel that there's a remnant always even in elijah's time there's a remnant who's not bowed their knee to baal so we find that even among them there was there was we could say an elect and an intellect even among them there was some who would serve god and some who wouldn't but now we have the fact that they are calling themselves the chosen people of god that puts a certain responsibility on them we have responsibility today responsibility to carry the message we don't talk about that much anymore we talking i don't know how to do this without sounding like i'm complaining because i'm not but we talk a lot about what the message does for us we should the message changed my life this message the revelation that this message brought to me makes me different changes me heals me amen are you with me now amen it it i don't know what it did for you but i could shout all night about what this message did for me changed my family lineage broke the curses off my family this message did a lot for me but i wonder sometimes if we kind of turn that around and realize there's a responsibility that comes with it saying i'm a message believer and i was i guess on this trip to egypt i guess i was kind of overwhelmed by that on some level because i'm like if i have an opportunity to go to those who have never heard but there's some people in our community that have never heard amen but if i have opportunity then if they're receptive and that's the difference many times over here is that people are so blinded by denominationalism and things that they're just they're just not receptive to the gospel but if i do have that opportunity and i don't say that you should go out like jehovah's witnesses and beat the doors down but i do have a if i have an opportunity i have a responsibility right so i'm not going necessarily knocking on all the doors and hardy have you heard about the message and say well yeah that was so-and-so's group you know but you know that's not what it is as much as when i have opportunity to live before the people in such a way that they would understand that god is reflecting himself has revealed himself to me do i do that i have a responsibility to do that that's why i don't take off being a christian on vacation amen right that's why we don't stop being christians when we leave the church right because we have a responsibility i am an ambassador for the message of the hour i'm an ambassador for the word that god sent in our hour which is this word made alive and made relevant to my day oh god shown the light on the part of the word that would be that would show me what to do and and how to act and the revelation i could have for my day to change my body one day that election is a responsibility jonah had that responsibility god wasn't going to come down to the king of nineveh directly right now listen he wasn't going to come down directly to the king of nineveh and say now you repent he could have but that's not how god does things if god wants to save the non-elect or even for some purpose hidden in his own heart to cause a temporary reprieve to come on a nation from judgment now think about it how is he going to do that he does it through the elect he doesn't do it through the non-elect he does it through the elect so there's somebody that god wants to heal you realize god wants to heal some people who are not non-elected right and just for his own purposes he wants to heal a person right we don't know why we can't explain it maybe one day we'll understand but he wants to heal somebody amen who's the non-elect you understand he does sometimes over the bed surely he wouldn't sometimes he does now how is he going to do that how is he going to do that he's not going to do that through the non-elect as much as he will through the elect now god does things in all kinds of different ways he heals in all kinds of different ways but sometimes many times most of the time he wants to use the elect for the benefit of the non-elect even when it's hard on the elect to do it now think about it if god wanted to heal somebody or he wanted to help somebody or he wanted to present the gospel to somebody just so they could reject it and he chose to do it through you what if that person was your enemy i want you to think about it tonight what if that person was your enemy maybe your husband or your wife or your family or somebody you don't even know other than that you know they didn't do a good job on your car or they swindled you out of some money or they're a nation who's against what your nation stands for or they come from another political party what if god wanted to use you for the herald to save a democrat now think about it for a minute what if god wanted to use you to to cause and again not that you would could make them elect they may not be may or may not be we don't know who is and who isn't you couldn't make them elect but what if god wanted to move through us as a little church to affect people who are both the elect and the non-elect some who are not elect what if he wanted to use us and yet we when we go through life we make so many enemies that's what jonah did nineveh was the enemy of israel god said i don't care about your grudge i don't care about your unforgiveness i don't care about the fact that they destroyed your land and come in and marched over them and even was prophesied to do it again jonah being a prophet would know that they would do that one day he said i don't care about that go preach to nineveh see jonah didn't want to give nineveh a chance oh god and it was a life-and-death kind of issue because jonah knew as long as nineveh had a chance of being a nation as long as judgment was forestalled for nineveh then they had an opportunity to come against israel and fulfill the prophecy written about them that they would come into israel and destroy it there's a lot more here than what we realize now look there are civilizations that lasted for hundreds of years with no judgment for worshiping false gods and yet israel couldn't get by with it hardly at all and jonah knew that nineveh was predestinated i i went and and read i've been reading a a book of bible characters and this is a writer from 1800 sometimes probably 150 years ago but i thought he was perceptive about this he said nineveh as jonah new was predestinated and prepared and prophesied of god to be the fast coming scourge in the cruel prison house of the conquered and captive israel and such was the power and the policy of nineveh and such was the sin and the weakness of israel that jonah could look for not one atom of hope for his country unless it was in the great and insufferable wickedness of nineveh and then the swift and sure judgment of god against nineveh it was in jonah's best interest that nineveh not have a reprieve from judgment he was actually happy with the wickedness of nineveh because it meant they would be judged quickly or he felt like they would they were his enemy and rightfully so but he lacked the bigger picture he liked the perspective of the prophet isaiah who come on the scene after jonah died but isaiah said this he said oh assyrian the rod of mine anger so jonah sees the assyrians as his enemy ninevites the assyrians the assyrian nation nineveh was the capital and jonah sees him as an enemy of god but isaiah sees him as a rod in the hand of god he said and the staff in their hand is mine indignation i will send him against an hypocritical nation against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil to take the prey to tread them down like the mire of the streets how be it he meaneth not so in other words he's not doing it because he has any special hatred for the jews he said neither does his heart think so he don't think he's a bad person the ninevites don't they didn't plan on doing it but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few so nineveh the nineveh began to be power-hungry the ninevites the assyrians began to be power-hungry begin to spread their empire they didn't even know why they were doing it but isaiah said it was a rod in the hand of god and the prophet come and told us a similar thing about the russians in this hour he said don't fear communism it's a tool in the hand of god so now it's in his heart why is it in his heart to go against ukraine now think about it because he's a tool in the hand of god so the jews could see that nineveh or the assyrians would end up destroying them but there was more to the prophecy in isaiah 10 12 wherefore it shall come to pass when the lord hath performed his whole work i love that don't give up until the lord has performed his entire work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria in the glory of his high looks therefore thus saith the lord god of host o my people that dwelleth in zion be not afraid of the assyrian now what did the prophet do in our day i could bring you the quotes but you know what he said don't fear russia don't be afraid of communism don't be afraid of the assyrian isaiah said see god's been doing that speaking through prophets for thousands of years it'd do us well to take heed to him and listen amen he said be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger and their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him he said judgment's coming to him according to the slaughter of million at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day his burden should be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from authentic and the yoke shall be destroyed not because of your natural ability to withstand him but because of the anointing oh god i hope we can understand this in a spiritual way tonight yoke is not destroyed because you realize that all these other nations or maybe other churches you say well they're doing wrong and so in my natural ability i'm going to go out there and i'm going to defeat these other things that are wrong you'll find that you end up just like jonah in the permissive will of god but now what did he say the yoke will not be destroyed by some man going out there and and preaching at it the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing when god says it's time it'll be time amen when god says it's time for freedom that'll be the time see we don't do things in a political way many times we think well if we could get together and and we could join together we could we we could vote and we could make the church different we could do this differently we could do that differently but that's not what god does see i'm not worried about you saying are you worried about coven are you worried some people never come back i'm not worried about that i believe that god's people go to church but i'm not worried about that but i it's important that we don't get bogged down i have to be careful to not get bogged down as a pastor in the minute details of what's happening right now because there's a bigger picture the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing if there's a down time there will be an uptime if there's a valley there'll be a mountain are you with me now church if there's a revival there'll be a desert but that desert we dig ditches right we learn that we dig ditches in the desert to get ready for another revival it's just it's just the nature of life it's just the way it is amen so isaiah understands the big picture that jonah doesn't seem to see god may have you preached to your enemies and his and bless them before he destroys them that's not the way we like to handle things is it bless god you touch my property i'll take you to court i know how we are here in arkansas i know how i am blessed god you mess with me i'll see that everybody knows about it maybe god wants to use you to preach grace to them to your enemies to people who maybe won't receive it or will only receive it for a time and then backslide because he just wants to he wants to show something new see what god really wanted to do was show something in jonah are you are you with me he wanted to give jonah you want to make jonah a sign of the resurrection how is he going to do that by sending him to preach grace to his enemies oh god help us today i've got just a few more minutes and you hang with me well if we can stop it i can pick it up next wednesday night now jonah 1-1 let's look at it it says now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of imitate saying now this is not the first time jonah prophesied we'll go back maybe next week and pick up the first time what made jonah famous was a prophecy actually against the assyrians that actually expanded the borders of of israel and he was a very famous during that time for that reason verse two he said arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me it's their time now we heard that and i'm going back to the the book that i read for just a moment if you'll just bear with me but jonah's heart beat high with hope that nineveh was now so near her destruction and if only all possibility of her repentance and reformation could be kept back from nineveh for 40 days he just had to keep it from him for 40 days you wonder why he went to tarshish he was just going far enough away out of the way where he couldn't get to nineveh in time think about it say well i just went the long route lord i was going just with the long route but he wanted the 40 days to be up before he showed up because he knew how merciful god was now watch he said then all might be well with jonah and with his four doomed people so in other words if if nineveh was destroyed that's great for israel but with such a god as his god was stoner had no security oh my with a god so given to mercy at the first sign of repentance in a sinner jonah felt that israel was not safe till nineveh was completely destroyed and forever blotted out so he says if i go and preach that to them if i go and warn them if i alarm them if they repent and turn them to god then it were better i were dead perish my prophets place perish the presence of god and all rather than that i should take a single step to preach repentance to nineveh so jonah becomes a prophet who flees from the presence of god i've seen pastors do this i've seen church members do this they begin they shut themselves up they flee from the presence of god they don't show up at meetings anymore they don't come they don't come to the house of god anymore they're setting themselves up in the hopes that their enemies will be destroyed not realizing that god may want to use them as the method not of the enemy's destruction but of mercy to the enemies see god would have a prophet later that would preach nineveh's destruction named nahum he would have a prophet that would preach of the destruction of nineveh but jonah wasn't that prophet jonah would preach repent in 40 days it was a hard message in 40 days you'll be destroyed but it was during jonah's time it was meant for them to repent so they could be around to go smite israel god knows what he's doing he just doesn't always do what we want him to do god would want to use you to help heal a person i can't tell you how many times i've prayed for people in my life that i knew they were they weren't for me i knew that the first opportunity that they would get they would try to do something to hurt me or hurt my family and yet you pray for them as sincerely as you do anybody else god may want them to be healed just so they can be around long enough to hurt you that's that's stuff we don't want to think about it is it that's that was nineveh god may want to use you to provide healing and repentance to someone just so they'll be around long enough to come and stab you in the back later but it doesn't matter if it's in the perfect will of god and at some point in our lives we have to surrender ourselves and say lord if it's your perfect will that's what i want amen when you shut up to choose between preaching in nineveh or making his bed in the belly of hell it displeased jonah exceedingly he was very angry and he chose to go to the belly of hell he knew god would come after him but he did not want nineveh to repent you say that's bad of jonah but i want you to kind of sympathize with him what if we were sent to russia and the nation repented just long enough to send nuclear war on this country to save them long enough to destroy us that's basically what happened with nineveh see it displeased jonah exceedingly that the lord had not destroyed it were you still with me tonight and and he was very angry and sometimes that happens and i'm following this line of thinking now not only between contending and competing nations but between contending and competing churches now we're going to bring it a little closer to home sometimes we hear like jonah that another church is prospering and we hear that another church or another church hears that we are doing well and it's not good news boy i'm getting somewhere tonight we're just digging deep amen i've preached long enough that i love it when it gets real quiet that's the difference by the way the only difference in a preacher has been preaching a long time one's been preaching a short time is a preacher's been preaching a long time loves it when it gets real quiet not all the time but just when you hit when you hit on something we hear that another church is doing well on the mission field we're we hear that another church and i'm paraphrasing this but this is the thought that again that this man had in the book that i read and i just before we move on i just wanted to kind of dwell on this for a moment but now you know it gets to the place where it would be better for the heathen to perish than that another church would be prosperous in the mission field because we got a problem with said church or said preacher and we would rather that the heathen perish then they be prosperous so we run from the presence of god i know preachers like that god help me not to be one of them i will say the temptation is there sometimes i look at what everybody else does and discount it say well they they are against me they must not be doing anything for god but that's not the attitude that jesus had at all see jonah still gets angry he never forgives you if you have any good to say of any other church than his own or of any party in his own church than his own party till you come down to this if you have any good to say of any man but himself what if the song leader or the deacon or the sunday school teacher or the pastor or the evangelist that replaces you does well what do you do with it think about it what if somebody goes someplace that you went and does better than you did do we have enough of the spirit of christ that we can say lord your work's being done it might be difficult for me but your work's being done this is especially hard on pastors as they get older i've watched this because it becomes more of a i can't do what i used to do and i'm afraid that i'm going to lose my position because now i see that younger men are coming along i say god send them god send them if they can send them from my position to where i can go back to work praise god and i'm trying to be honest as i can about that yes it would hurt but if god wants it let that i want that to be the perfect will of god amen i want brother joel with allen by the steward and though alan and steward are not younger than me really and not much less experienced in many ways but but they're they're not inferior in any way i don't believe in their preaching but yet god called me to this place in this position but if they come from my my office if god wills it praise god are you with me now i'm being really personal with this but think about it your job what you do in the church well bless god i used to do the cleaning and somebody else does it i used to used to do the video and somebody else does that i used to do this and somebody else does it and we grudgingly we look at that and say well if they do well am i going to be able to be happy about that we should be but see jonah was so unhappy because he was afraid god would forgive them that he rose up to flee into tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joplin he found a ship going to tarshish tarshish so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord he would rather run from the presence of god than see nineveh repent but again the sovereign god who sees all things who owns all things doesn't care about our personal grudges about our petty differences he might bless the person who hates you save the person who you despise let me read this and we'll close musicians go ahead and come we've got lots of notes left but we'll pick it up next wednesday he said you've heard that has been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hates you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust do we really believe that he sends rain on the evil and on the good equally and we know that because he's been sending rain on jonesboro we've been sending rain on memphis and something we've missed out on but we'll get some too he sends rain on the just and the unjust people who you've had personal problems with sometimes will come to church here at meetings that we hold i don't this didn't happen okay just it's hypothetical but people you have a personal grudge against might come and be blessed at a meeting that you worked to put on what are you going to do with that lord it's in your hands he sends rain on the evil and on the good on the elect and the non-elect on the just and the unjust and sometimes he uses us to bring the water to bring the rain on people that hate us god elijah prophesied rain he brought the drought and then he brought the rain god used elijah to prophesy the rain that would come to ahab to save his neck and keep him his king and elijah went off in the wilderness sat under a juniper tree and felt sorry for himself until god got a hold of him comforting him for a while and they said you're not the only one there's more out there could we bow our heads together i didn't intend for this to end this way we had some really good things ahead but i can't keep going maybe just as a little preview you know brother branham was almost jonah he said i wanted to go up into the wilderness be a man a manly man be a real prophet god said you're not that kind of prophet he said you need to get the heart for the people again i wonder if that's us in whatever position that we hold whether you're watching tonight or whether you're here maybe you just need to have a heart for the people again say god help me to be that way don't let me be like joan and run from the presence of the lord but in this age i want to be in your perfect will oh god god didn't let brother branham fall into that permissive will and just be a prophet in the wilderness he he brought him back to the people god help us to do that amen heavenly father as i feel your presence here tonight and conviction as well lord not conviction so much for the people but for me lord we want others to do good when they do us good but sometimes you want others to do good who will do us harm not only who have done us harm but who will do us harm we don't understand that lord but it fits in your providence and your purpose help us to surrender to that lord we don't know what tomorrow holds but you do help us to rest in the assurance that we are your elect that somehow you'll get us out of the messes that we create in life oh god many times i've created messes even by my own words and my own actions but lord somehow you turned it for your own benefit lord somehow you in your book it's written that i'm a virtuous bride clean not spotted by the things of the world a bride who will not fall remember that bride today i pray you'd help these people to realize that lord each one of them lord is a member of that bride that will not fall [Music] sometimes lord as we go through life god wants us to speak to that person who may be non-elect who may hurt us and have hurt us in the past or will hurt us in the future but through us he wants to provide healing to them i pray we would be submissive to that lord and we just let it be you have a way of bringing out of that what you want it to be i pray you grant it lord before you help these people maybe maybe there's some here have been heard in the past by things that have been wrong but lord sometimes you want to use us to help those very people who hurt us you did that lord that was your character you wanted to show that display that jonah but jonah ran but you showed there would be one who would not run but he would say not my will but time be done and he would be raised on the third day though he was put to death by wicked hands oh god we're so grateful for that today lord so grateful that though you were put to death by wicked hands yet you did not run but you rose again on the third day and showed the the reality of what jonah was in type we had a prophet in this day who did not run but he stayed where you in his position come back to the people and preach the opening of the word we're so grateful for that lord i pray you'd help us to be a people like that you stay in our position don't run recognize we're the predestined children of god but that doesn't make us lord just something special or different but it makes us responsible to the world that we live and i pray grant it now bless these people heal those that are sick lord i know that you will i know that you want to god and you said you wanted to heal us you wanted to save us you want to give us the holy ghost more than we want it and we're so grateful for that today lord we pray that you bless each one now as we worship you and we thank you for what you've done in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight brother joel come let's stand together thank you lord thank you lord [Music] is [Music] praise the lord is over [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music]
