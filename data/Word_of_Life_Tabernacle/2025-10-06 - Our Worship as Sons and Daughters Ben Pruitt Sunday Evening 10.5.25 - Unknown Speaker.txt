It was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Alas, and did my savior bleed? And did my sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred head for such a world as I Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart roll away. Oh, it was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Was his for crimes that I have done. He grown upon the tree. Amazing pity, grace unknown and love beyond degree. Well, at the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light. As the burden of my heart go away. Well, it was there by faith. I received my sight. And now I am happy all the day. will light the sun in darkness hide and shut his glories in. When Christ the mighty maker died for men the creature sin. Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart go away. It was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Oh, the smite I hide my blushing face. While Calary's cross appears, dissolve my heart in thankfulness and melt my eyes to tears. Well, at the cross. I'll sing it now. And first roll away. It was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Aren't you thankful for the cross? Amen. Let's stand together. I don't have any written requests for specials. Did anybody want to sing that I missed? No. All right. Well, with that, sometimes you just can't hardly buy a special and other times you get more than you can handle. But uh we're thankful for what the Lord has done for us today. How many enjoyed the message this morning? Wasn't that wonderful? Yes. [Music] Let's try this one here. Well, there's a light in the window and a table spread of splendor. Someone standing by the open door. Well, I see the Crystal River, but I must be near forever. But I've never been this homeick before. [Music] So see the bright lights shine. It's just about home time. Well, I can see my father standing at the door. Well, this world has been a wilderness, but I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this home before. Well, I can see the family gathering, sweet faces, all familiar. Well, no one's old or feeble anymore. Oh, this lonesome heart is crying. I'm going to spread my wings for flying. Well, I've never been this home sick before. So see the bright light shine. It's just about hold time. Well, I can see my father standing at the door. Well, this world has been a wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this whole sick before.

Oh well, this world is in the wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this home. Sing that second verse again now. Well, I can see the family gathering, sweet faces, all familiar. Oh, no one's old or feeble. Aren't you looking forward to that day? Oh yes. Oh, this lonesome heart is crying. I'm going to spread my wings for flying. Cuz I've never been this home sick before. [Music] Just see the bright light shine. It's just about home time. Well, I can't see. Oh yes, at the door. Well, this world has been a wilderness and I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been this whole sick before. Give him another hand clap of praise if you love him. Amen. Are you ready for the word of the Lord tonight? And we're going to just speed it up and sing it fast as he comes out. I would not be denied in the key of C. Amen. I tell you what, I don't mind bringing him out on a fast song. Maybe he'll preach fast and get out get out of here fast. I guess I better not say that. But uh Amen. Tell you what, we enjoy being in church. You know, I know we get tired and body, but aren't you thankful that we know why we come. It's not just to check a check a box, but we're here to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And because of him, all things are possible here tonight. If you have a need on your heart, as the word goes forth, just hold that need. Amen. Just just hold on to it. I believe that we will not be denied here this evening in this service. So, let's just worship him. Pull on the word of God as our pastor comes now. Well, when pains of death seized all my soul unto the Lord, I cried. Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Well, I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. Till my Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Well, as Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled with the Lord and instant with a courage. Bold, I stood upon his holy word. Well, I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. Until Jesus came and he made me whole, I would not be denied. Well, oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and would not hear. We don't believe that, do we? Oh, but praise the Lord, the work is done. How many believes Christ is here tonight? Oh, sing with all your hearts now. Well, I would not be denied. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] till Jesus came and oh I would not be one more time. Oh, I would not be Oh, I would not be till Jesus came. [Music] [Applause] Oh, aren't you glad you would not be tonight? Amen. So glad he put something in your heart that can say, "Lord, I'm going to get all that you've got for me." Is that the way you come to church tonight? Amen. God bless you. If you would bow with me for just a moment, bow your heads and let's just talk to the Lord. Heavenly Father, as we come to this communion service, I pray God that you would just move, Lord, have your way in every part of the service. Lord, we don't want to orchestrate it so and until you don't have any freedom to move, but we want your will to be done. I pray that you grant it tonight. Move me out of the way, Lord, that you would speak directly to the people, Lord, and they're your people. They're the purchase of your blood. And I pray, God, that you would speak directly to them. We thank you for doing that, Lord. God, you've done it for me so many times, spoken through a minister, through your prophet. Lord, I pray you do it for your people again tonight. Heal the sick, touch those that are in need. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. Amen. It's good to be here tonight. Romans chapter 8 verse1 15. Romans 8:15. just read this very quickly and just a little thought that we had tonight and then we'll go right into right into the communion service. I want to speak to you tonight on worship under adoption. Worship under adoption. Romans 8:15. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption. So you've not received a spirit of a slave, but you have received the spirit of a son or a daughter of God whereby we cry. So in other words, he's saying this is why we cry under the spirit of adoption. This is why we worship Abba, father. We call him our father because he we have received the spirit of adoption. Amen. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word. You may be seated. It is this revelation that we have of who we are as sons and daughters of God that has a direct effect on our worship. The revelation that we have that we are sons and daughters of God. And that is essentially what the new birth is or or what it does for us. Brother Brandham says, "I I was that eagle in the chicken pin." He said, "But one day," he said, "I realized I was not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom, but I was the son of God." And when I realized I was a son of God, or you were a daughter of God, he when we realized that, he said, "Then I was born again." &gt;&gt; Right? And and so it was that revelation. And so when we talk about the new birth, we're not talking about uh just having an emotional experience, though that's part of it. Brother Brand said any birth is a mess. And when you die to yourself, many times you got to die at an altar. You got to die to yourself. It might have been in your home, might have been uh in your car, but wherever it is, you got to die to yourself. And that's a mess to go through that time. But it's not any certain emotional experience or any kind of a of a response emotionally. But the reason why you worship is because of revelation that you have. I am a son of God. I realize that I'm a Christian. And sometimes it takes a little bit because a person maybe will be saved and come and be baptized and be saved and maybe even receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And yet the devil will fight them on this maturity of being a Christian. And maybe they'll grow over time. And one day they'll look back and realize, "Hey, I'm a Christian. And I've been a Christian for a while. I've been serving the Lord and doing the things that God has called me to do. And and uh uh I'm uh I've been doing that uh for for a while and God has called me to do that. And now I believe that I have been I I am a part of what of God's program. And so you begin to cry out, "Aba, Father, Lord, you're my God. I belong in the message of the hour. I'm a son of God." How many can say amen to that tonight? You you didn't belong in the world. You were you didn't belong in denomination. You didn't belong in the things of the world. But you belong in the house of God worshshiping with the people of God. &gt;&gt; And so our worship is because of who we are and what we were created to do. He created us for worship. How many believe that tonight? I was created to worship him. And and so in Ephesians 1:5, we've read it several times lately, but he said, "He has predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will." And so we could say it like this. We were predestined to worship him, to become the sons of God, the daughters of God, or to recognize that that's what we were because you always were a son of God. When you recognize what you are, there's something about that that brings a worship. You don't want to just sit like a bump on a pickle, but there's something about that makes you makes you happy. It makes you glad. It makes you excited to know I'm not just a I'm not just another person in Leona. I'm not just another person fighting this church age, but I actually belong to God. I belong to something. You know, if you were adopted naturally and and maybe you uh you didn't realize that uh that that that your parents went out of their way to uh to choose you. You were adopted one day. You realize that uh you know, hey, they chose me to be part of this family and and I am a part of the family. Well, God did the same thing for you. But what you realize where I always was a part of the family and when you realize that's where I belong. That's who I'm a part of. those uh my my dad what my dad's attributes are is what I am. Oh God, if we just realize I'm a part of deity. I belong to deity. I belong to the message of the hour. Belong to Christ. What does that do for you? It makes it where you you can worship in freedom because you're not worried about what people say about you no more. I'm a son of God. I belong to God. &gt;&gt; So we were predestined to worship in freedom as sons. Brother Bren said, "What did he do?" He by fornowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior. Self-existence. Say, "Brother Ben, what does this have to do with communion?" Communion is worship. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; This is a part of our worship. &gt;&gt; We're giving this back to God. Lord, I can't do much. David said, "There's not much I can do." I'm paraphrasing, but he said, "There's not much I can do to to give to the Lord what he has given to me, but I can take the cup. Come on. &gt;&gt; I can take the cup. We can say amen to that. I can take communion and I can stand among the people of God. And he said, I'll pay my vows in the house of the Lord. That's what we're doing here tonight. That's why you come out on a Sunday afternoon. I'm going to pay my vows in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did he do? By fornowledge, he by fornowledge foresaw us knowing that he was a savior. Self-existence. There was no angels, no nothing. This God, Eli, Elohim, the self-existing one. Nothing but him alone. But in him was a savior. Well, what's he going to save? There's nothing lost. Knowing that even he knowed this great attribute in him would project something out yonder that he could save. Then when it did that by fornowledge, he looked down and he saw everyone that would accept it. And then by doing so, he said to save that, the only way I can do it will be to come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of a man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worshiped. &gt;&gt; He did it all so that he could be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad we worship him in spirit and in truth? We have the truth that tells us how to take communion and how to gather together and all of those things, but we don't worship just by letter, but we worship him in spirit as well. His entire purpose was to be worshiped. He said he is God, the object of worship. And his entire purpose was to be worshiped as God, our savior and redeemer, our king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want many times when we preach about worship, people feel bad because I think there's not one of us that couldn't say, "Well, we don't worship God enough." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We're not free enough. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'll say this. It's not helpful to judge other people. &gt;&gt; Right? Whether they worship a lot or a little &gt;&gt; that's not helpful. &gt;&gt; Look at them say, "Well, I wish this church worship more." Well, you just start worshiping. &gt;&gt; I I've I've expressed this to our song leaders and to our to worship leaders and to preachers even. If you worship, the people will worship. &gt;&gt; Right? That that's that's what it is. Us worshiping that causes people to worship. I don't want to just be a person who tells people to worship. Let me worship and people worship with me. If you don't want to, that's up to you. But I got the spirit of adoption. &gt;&gt; I didn't get the spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; I got the spirit of adoption. Many times we look at other people and we judge what they do or what they don't do. And it's it's not the right spirit to have uh in in worship, but the right spirit to have is actually to say, "Lord, how can I worship you? What do you want from me? What what what do you desire from my heart to yours? And maybe that's sitting there and and crying. And maybe it's sitting there and thinking about the things of God. Maybe it's raising your hand. Maybe it's worshiping, shouting, running around the building. I don't know what it'll be, but it'll do something to you when you realize that you're a son or daughter of God. So, why are we afraid to be free? Many times we're afraid. It It's because many times of a slave mentality. We We still feel like sinners. We still feel in bondage and this this flesh is bondage to a certain extent. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Because Paul said and go read in Romans chapter 7, he said will be delivered from the bondage of this corruption. Right? He said, "Oh wretched man that I am, right?" And he was a saved man, a Holy Ghost-filled man, but he packed around a body of death. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to live very long to realize that you pack around a body of death. And many times that's what keeps you. It's what gets you tired on a Sunday afternoon. It's what keeps you from raising your hands. It's what keeps you from worship. It's what keeps you from the things of God. It's it keeps you from reading your Bible. It's this old flesh man. I'm glad there's coming a day when I'm going to be able to worship in complete and total freedom because I'm going to have a body like his glorious body. I tell you what, the more I get flesh out of the way here, the better I can worship him. &gt;&gt; The more I get this revelation, I was not born to be. You see, it's Benjamin Puit that keeps me from worshiping. But when I realize that's not the real me, I got a new name written down in glory. I belong to God. I was in his mind before the foundation of the earth. When I recognize that, then I can begin to worship freely. &gt;&gt; Why are we afraid many times to be free? We don't realize maybe who we are &gt;&gt; or we just let that slave mentality creep back over us. See, the opening of the seal is all about worship. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that? I know people have made the seals some kind of &gt;&gt; study where we know things. That's not what the seals was about. The seals was the breaking the the loosing of all creation from the bondage of every claim the devil had on them. &gt;&gt; That's what the opening of the seals was. The opening of the seals was not a a a textbook. It was not a study. And so we'll understand more about prophecy. &gt;&gt; But the opening of the seals was the releasing of Satan's claim on the earth &gt;&gt; when the book could not go back into the dirty hands of Satan. So it went back to the original owner. And Revelation 5 and verse one said, "I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. One of the elders said unto me, weep not. He said, "This isn't the time for weeping. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. I beheld, lo, in the midst of the throne, of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb that had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, now I'll just read it like some people think. The four beasts and the four and 20 elders held a seminar &gt;&gt; and everybody got their notebooks out and &gt;&gt; right and I'm not making fun of there's a time for that. There's a place for that. &gt;&gt; But that's not what they did. &gt;&gt; They didn't gather around the throne and say, "Oh, now we can really argue with our neighbor." You know when the lamb took the book, they didn't start a exposition or a seminar. &gt;&gt; What did they do? They fell down &gt;&gt; before the lamb &gt;&gt; having every one of them harps. Amen. They were everyone musicians. &gt;&gt; Golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the saints &gt;&gt; which were kept. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You realize the Bible says every prayer you ever prayed, if you're a saint of God, every prayer you ever prayed was kept. &gt;&gt; Not one of them was wasted. They were kept before God. Hallelujah. Golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seal." They wrote a song right on the spot. They didn't have a seminar. They didn't get together and argue with each other. But what did they do? They worshiped. Cuz this is what you do when you realize who you are. This is what you do when you see your name in the book. This is what you do. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You talk about a Pentecostal revival. The Pentecostals worship because they believe the gifts had been restored. They believe they knew about tongues and things like that. We don't worship about gifts. We worship about the giver. We worship about Christ coming down into our age. &gt;&gt; Ought to be much greater worship &gt;&gt; than anything Pentecostals could do. Look, they sung a new song. Said, "Thou art worthy." Hallelujah. And look at verse 10. And hast made us unto our God, kings and priests. They knew who they were. Why? Because of the opening opening of the seals. Hallelujah. And we shall reign. That revelation wasn't there before. But but Joel, as soon as they heard that the seals come open, as soon as they saw the lamb take the book, they said, "We know who we are now. You are worthy." and you have made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; We shall reign on the earth. And I beheld heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders. And the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying some of y'all going to get mad at me right here. Saying with a &gt;&gt; what does that say? &gt;&gt; Everybody just say that out loud if you can read. loud voice. &gt;&gt; I'm glad, you know, down here sometimes our ears hurt, but I think it'll be just perfect up there. &gt;&gt; But what did they say with a loud voice? &gt;&gt; Worthy. Hallelujah. They said they said, "Turn that PA all the way up." &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. What it says? A loud voice. They said with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb." I know it's hard for us sometimes. I know some people, and there are people who just in their nature, they're not loud people. And and I appreciate you people. I really do that aren't loud. But I think if you ever really get a revelation of who you are, there'll be some kind of some kind of response. &gt;&gt; The angels cried with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb." Can anyone call him worthy tonight? Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitth upon the throne unto the lamb forever and ever. Brother Brandham turns that around and he says every creature heard John say. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He he was that loud with it. Why? He saw his name in the book. He saw he wasn't going to be lost, but he was going to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The four beasts said, "Amen." And and and they must have been able to hear him say, "Amen." Or John wouldn't have wrote it. Four beasts said, "Amen." And the four and 20 elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever &gt;&gt; and ever. But the Brandon said the 8th to the 14th verse of the fifth chapter reveals the time for the lamb to be worshiped both in heaven and in earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The time for him to be worshiped both in heaven and in earth. The seventh sealed book, the worthy lamb, the kinsman redeemer. And from the 8th verse to the 14th, angels worship him, elders worship him, living creatures worship him, and John worshiped him. He's a type of the bride. so much till he said every creature in heaven in the earth underneath the earth heard me saying blessings glory power wisdom might be to the lamb that worship time he said for the king lamb I believe every one of our services under the opening of the word under our adoption under the message of the hour every one of our services ought to be holy holy holy to the lamb worthy is the lamb why because we know who we are we know where we belong and if you don't know you can know we have a message that will reveal that to you the The Holy Ghost can fill you and help you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You can't know him without the Holy Ghost. You can't know the message without the Holy Ghost. But if you ever get it, there'll be some response in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Might be as simple as just saying, "Hey, I'm a Christian." But that'll bring a smile across your face. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, then that's I don't know what to do with you. I'll be honest. That ought to bring a smile to your face. I'm a Christian. I may be sick, but I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; What? What are you saying? You know, a person could say that a few years ago and they'd say before the opening of the word, I'm a Christian, but I might be lost tomorrow, so I got to be afraid. &gt;&gt; But you realize what you're saying when you're saying you're a Christian under the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You can't be lost. We've been here a few years and I excuse me for again for being emotional, but I've watched some of these young men and young women and and and and some of y'all grew up and and I've seen some of y'all baptized many of you now. And I've watched you come from, you know, maybe from bad backgrounds and things, different ones that are here. And you're sitting here listening to the word, feeding on the word. I've watched that change in your life. and under the message of the hour, recognizing that if God did that for you, that's for eternity. Ain't nothing the devil's going to be able to do. He may fight you. He may he may he may give you all kinds of trouble, but he's not going to be able to have you. You belong to God. Now, you realize what that does to me as a pastor to say, "My work's not in vain. All the preaching's not in vain. I know you're going to make it cuz you're the bride of Jesus Christ." What ought that ought to do to every one of us when we recognize I've given my heart to the Lord. I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. I am a Christian. I belong in the mind of God. I belong in the opening of the word. I belong in the message of the hour. I can worship about that no matter what's going on in my life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When I don't feel good, I can still worship. &gt;&gt; When it's a slow service, I can still worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; When it's quiet, I can worship quietly. When it's loud, I can worship loudly. Whatever response he calls from me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's worship time. I'll say this and I'm going to close before too long. You're not going to believe how fast I'm going to close. I'm flat wore out. &gt;&gt; Brother Jeremy says, "Do a little more." &gt;&gt; All right, Brother Jeremy. Many people are afraid to worship because we know all worship's not accepted. &gt;&gt; You want to be accepted, don't you? I want to be accepted. &gt;&gt; So, that's a lot of it is people say, "Well, I don't want But you remember the man Jesus talked about he said he who went away and he gave his servants gave one five talents one two another one he gave one and the one he gave five talents he went out and made five talents and and brought 10 back and the one he gave two he went out and made two and brought four back and the one who he gave one he said I know my master he he requires the right kind of worship &gt;&gt; can we say it that way so I just won't do nothing I just come back and bring that that he I'll go hide it in the earth, &gt;&gt; right? And bring it back. He hid it in the earth. He didn't do nothing with it. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he was disapproved by his master. Why? Because he hid it what God had given him. He He was afraid to worship. I say if God's given you salvation, worship under that. Whatever place he's led you to, if he give you the Holy Ghost, worship him for that. If he healed your body, worship him for that. Don't just bury it in the earth. Worship God. Get return thanks for what you've been given. &gt;&gt; Revelation 13:8 tells us that all that dwell upon the earth here in the end times shall worship him. That's the antichrist, the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Listen. But brother Brandham in this adoption uh message he he tells us he said talks about this antichrist. He said he came down taken upon himself. We don't want to be in that group that worships the Antichrist. Right. &gt;&gt; And they worship, &gt;&gt; right? They worship, but they worship wrong. &gt;&gt; They worship under a system, under a dogma, under a creed. &gt;&gt; But but we don't do that. &gt;&gt; But I know people get afraid of that. Say, "Well, I don't want to worship wrong." Look what brother Brandham says. He came down taken upon himself. While he did that, he did that you he might save you who wants to be saved. He said, "By fornowledge, the infinite God who knows all things. He slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world. He put your name on the lamb's book of life and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan. &gt;&gt; What he would do. So he put your name on there. &gt;&gt; I just about turned around had a spell when I read that. &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said he saw we live in the end time. He saw there'd be an antichrist. He saw there'd be a system of of unbelief. And yeah, they worship and they worship Rome. It's not received. Jesus said, "In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines of commandments of men, but we do not worship in vain." God knew the deceitfulness of Satan. &gt;&gt; So he put your name on there and he said that that Antichrist would be so religious, so good, such a fine fellow, such a smart man, such a religious man that he would deceive the very elected if it was possible. But it is. &gt;&gt; Turn it into Joel. I'm going to beat up the pulpit. It is an impossible. How many believe that today? Do you really believe what the Bible it is and impossible because their names were for ordained before the foundation of the world? I I feel like running all over the building by election. He chose them and by predestination they know where they're going. He said, "There you are. You don't have to be afraid to worship. Afraid you're going to worship something wrong. You just believe what a prophet said." &gt;&gt; He said, "Who could doubt that?" That's what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church, the church positionally. He said when God all of this in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you know knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or be that he placed you positionally and when we have come from the garlic lands of Egypt through sanctification and his baptizing in the promised land the promise of God is the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption. And God having predestinated the church, he said, "And all the peoples, there will be millions times millions will walk very religious and be deceived. But the only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the promised land who before the foundation of the world had their names put on the lamb's book of life has come over into the promised land and enjoying it." &gt;&gt; And enjoy. Let's not leave off that last part. The ones that will not be deceived are not those who are cowering down, hunkering down, scared to death to hear anybody preach, scared to death to go to a meeting because they might get deceived. But the ones, hallelujah, the ones who had their names put on lambs, put the lion is come over to the promised land and enjoying it. That's the ones that won't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Many people are afraid you're going to act funny, he said. &gt;&gt; Many people are afraid the Holy Ghost will make you do something you'll be ashamed of. Ashamed of people. Many people are afraid they'll cry and their sweetheart will see them crying. Oh no, mama or your neighbor &gt;&gt; or your boss will see you. There was a man named David. He tells about that how the he said he had been down the Philistine land. The the ark was coming back and said he had a little gown on him. He ran out there, kicked his feet in the air and jumped around, screamed and jumped. &gt;&gt; Danced and jumped and danced. Come on. &gt;&gt; And him, the king of Israel. &gt;&gt; And his wife looked out the window and saw him acting so strange. She despised him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We haven't left the adoption sermon, by the way. That's what this is. &gt;&gt; He said, "The idiot, look at him out there. The way he's acting, throwing his feet up in the air, jumping around, acting like that, why he must be crazy." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When he come in, she said in words like this, "Why you've embarrassed me? You, the king, my husband, out there doing like that, acting like that." David said, "Tomorrow I'll do better than that." Yes, sir. He said, "Don't you know I was dancing to the Lord. He crossed over." Hallelujah. He was in the land of the promise. He lost all self styles and muck of the world. He was so happy to know the ark was coming into his own city. I tell you, he said, "Some people's afraid to receive the Holy Ghost. Afraid they might speak with tongues." They're afraid somebody would say, "Now, he's one of them tongues guys. They're afraid to come to church and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because they're ashamed of it." Somebody said, "I'll have to recall my tapes cuz I'd preach being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ." He said, "I ain't recalling them. I'm making more." &gt;&gt; I'm glad that's the attitude that he had. Amen. See, that's right. Making more. That is the Bible. If they don't like what we did yesterday, just watch what we're going to do tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's the thing to do. See, just keep on going. There's no end to it because it's of the Lord. It's God. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. You don't have to worship like I worship, but let me worship in the freedom of the spirit of adoption. &gt;&gt; If I'm going to worship, let me worship under the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; However, I worship. &gt;&gt; He said, you know what God did? He said, he looked down out of heaven and said, "David, you're a man after my own heart." &gt;&gt; David wasn't ashamed. He was a servant of the Lord. He loved the Lord. He was so happy, so overjoyed until he didn't think about human prestige. Brother Brandham talked about the sermon he preached that morning. And that morning, he preached the rejected king. He said, "We're so much afraid that we want a Saul to teach us. We want a Saul from some seminary to tell us how we must do our religion, how we must do it." Somebody said that that is on the other side of the Jordan. &gt;&gt; That's denominational. &gt;&gt; This side, the Holy Spirit leads. &gt;&gt; Over here, you're out of that muck. Over here, you don't care what they think. Over here, you're dead and your life is hid in Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You don't care. You're living in Canaan. You can stand good corn. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're a new creature in Christ Jesus. You're bound for the promised land. Let me hit this before I close. Some people are afraid to worship because of their past. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Like, you know, I know none of us understand the pain of another person's past. &gt;&gt; Like, unless you walked in those shoes, &gt;&gt; you don't know. And so, it's not just that I can tell you to be happy. You know, &gt;&gt; well, that's good, but &gt;&gt; you don't know what that person's been through. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But I'll say this. If you really had a revelation what God did for you, your past ought to make you more of a worshipper. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because you know where you came from, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And church, I I I didn't go out and sin and live in the world like that. I but I had a religious spirit and I know what I could have been and I know what my family then some of the things I come out of and had a brother tell me one time and said, "Brother Ben, you're a miracle and a pastor." And I look at that and it's true. My life is a miracle. The fact that I'm able to stand here today and and and preach to you is a miracle. And I believe there's many miracles sitting here in the building today. I got a lot of pain in my past, but he took away all my past and took away everything that I could have been and every mistake that I made. Aren't you glad for a God like that? Don't that make you want to worship? What was the opening of the seals? It was the removal of your past. Your your past was divorced from you. And when I recognize the opening of the word and I begin to see that, I become more of a worshipper than I'd ever been. Sometimes I do cry. Sometimes I do shout. Sometimes I do get excited, but it's because I know, brother JT, I know what he saved me from. I know what he brought me out of. I shouldn't have any right to be able to rightly divide the word based on what I was taught as a child, but I still God has given me the ability to be a pastor in the message of the hour. I said, God, it was all you. It didn't have nothing to do with me. It was all God. He gave me ability to understand the word. That was all him. He gave me a good wife. That was all him. Come on, church. That wasn't my own effort. That was all him. He gave me a family. That was all him. He gave us this church. That was all him. When we look at what we were, it ought to make us worship in freedom. &gt;&gt; Look what I was. Look what he brought me to. &gt;&gt; I've got the scripture, but we won't read it. Luke chapter 7 tells about the woman who went to Simon's house. And Simon looks over there and he says, "See, he's not a prophet." that if he was a prophet, he wouldn't receive worship from her. &gt;&gt; How many Simon Pharisees do we have? &gt;&gt; If he was a prophet, he wouldn't receive worship from them &gt;&gt; because of what they've been. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew better than anybody who she was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He knew what she'd done. He knew Oh, God. She may not have been able to remember how many times she had failed God. How many times she'd fallen, how many times she'd done things wrong. She might have done it so much, believe she couldn't even remember anymore. &gt;&gt; He He knew it. &gt;&gt; But he also knew that as soon as she accepted his grace, she would be completely saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the blood that he would shed for her sins would completely wash her from every sin &gt;&gt; and she would be the most righteous person in the building. That's why brother Brandham calls Simon in the Pharisee the worst sinner in the city. He's not talking about the woman. He's talking about Simon. &gt;&gt; And so they come to Jesus and and he said and Jesus perceived their thoughts and he said he said man there was two two people. One was forgiven much and one was forgiven of a little bit. He said, "Which one loves the most?" He said, "The one who was forgiven the most." He said, "There you go." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Don't let condemnation steal your praise. Don't let condemnation steal your joy. I know people, there's some people who say they've been saved, but they'll never take communion. Why not? &gt;&gt; Just accept what he's done for you. You say, "Well, if I was a little bit better, I' i'd come to church. If I could quit doing this, that, or the other." Why don't you just accept what he did for you? He He's done enough. You don't have to add one bit to You don't have to uh give yourself a whooping every time you come to the house of God. Just say, "Lord, I accept what you did for me. I believe I'm a I'm a child, a son of God. I've been born into the kingdom of God. Don't matter what my past was. I'm a believer and I love you." &gt;&gt; What are these things? They're scarecrows. Musicians come and we get ready to prepare for the communion service. They're scarecrows. Brother Brandham talked about how he had a garden one time and said he had this I got this written down as a scarecrow eating butter beans, but the scarecrow didn't eat butter beans. There was a groundhog. I saw the fattest groundhog in my life the other day. Looked at him and he resembled me. Had four or five chins hanging down. You know, he must have been eating some butter beans. But remember said this ground dog would come out eat butter bean. He said he made this scary. He thought it was pretty good. Scarecrow, you know, put it up there. He said the old groundhog come out there and he said the first time he saw that scarecrow, he's a little scared and he'd uh kind of shrink back from it and said but the groundhog just got to watching it. He said he realized that scarecrow stayed in the same place all the time. After a while he got to looking at it. He thought, you know what, that thing ain't real. [Music] Oh, I wish we could get that revelation. [Music] That thought the devil tries to put on you and say, "Well, you're not worthy. That thing ain't real. It's a scarecrow." That condemnation comes to your life, that thing ain't real. It's a scarecrow. That idea that once you come to the opening of the word, you just got to be quiet the rest of your life. That's a scarecrow. It's not what a prophet taught. It's just what we've made up. Just it's not real. Well, I don't want to be Pentecostal. That's a scarecrow. &gt;&gt; We just want to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't want no wild enthusiasm. What we want is a worship that God knows &gt;&gt; from the depths of our heart. &gt;&gt; That he he knows we want him to know it that we love him. So the little groundhog, he got he finally decided that was just a scarecrow. And so you know what he did? Brand said he just went on eating butter beans. He learned to ignore the scarecrow. It's always going to be there, church. But if you want the butter beans, if you want the goodness of God, you got to be willing to ignore the scarecrows and go ahead and eat. I'd say, let's eat the message of the hour. Let's eat the word that's been stored up. Let's let's eat let's partake of the good things of God. Not be afraid to do that. Would you bow your heads with me for a moment? was born to worship him in spirit and in truth. You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." Oh God, what a promise that scripture is. Why don't we just talk to him for a moment? Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the the sweetness of a communion service, Lord, we thank you for what you've done for us. I thank you for healing my body. Thank you for saving my soul. Thank you for your goodness. What could I ever do to deserve that? Nothing. But Lord, I'll take the cup tonight. Oh God, Lord, if I've done anything that wouldn't be pleasing to you, forgive me, Lord, I know I have an advocate. These people have an advocate, Lord. Maybe there'd be somebody there' be some fear in their life because of things in the past. I pray you would remove that from them tonight. May they know the the love of God that overwhelms and floods out every like a mighty river floods out everything in its path. May your love come down over them today. And and they recognize they are sons and daughters of God as the four and 20 elders fell down before the throne. And oh God began to worship and you have made us kings and priests. May we do the same today Lord. Lord as we come to communion service may we say Lord I thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for your goodness. I pray, Lord, as it's already been prayed that you would heal. There would be healing in the communion line. Lord, I pray for Brother Gabe once again. Lord, I maybe he's already feeling better, but I pray God that you would just go down where he's at. And Sister Naomi, Lord, and was sick as well and different ones, Lord, that couldn't be here tonight. I pray, oh God. Lord, you said that not one of them would be lost. So, we're holding to that, Lord. We we hold you to your word today. We believe. Help our unbelief. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I pray you'd touch every person in this building. May we know you're not just an emotion, but a reality, Lord. We can worship you for what you have done for us. For you grant it now. Thank you for all your goodness, your mercy that follows us all the days of our life. Jesus name Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord I need. Sing that to him again. He's all I need. Oh he's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all He's all I need. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he all &gt;&gt; Oh, his presence is here tonight, church. &gt;&gt; He is all I need. &gt;&gt; Jesus is all Hallelujah. I need I worship you. Could we raise our hands and sing it? I worship you. &gt;&gt; I will I worship [Music] you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In spirit and in truth. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; I worship you. &gt;&gt; Oh I worship [Music] you in spirit and in truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We go to the communion service tonight. 1 Corinthians chap 11 [Music] verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you. Many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tear one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together into condemnation. The rest will I set in order. I come, brothers, if you'd come. Oh, don't you love the Lord tonight? Amen. [Music] Heavenly Father, hold in my hands the wine. Lord, it's time for your blood that was shed on Calvary. I thank you for that blood. Oh, how great a sacrifice you made for me. Lord, I pray that because your blood was shed for me and for each one here, Lord, that they've been bought by your blood, may I treat them in that way, Lord. Each one of us, may we treat one another well, Lord, because you bought each one of us in our own uniqueness, Lord. And even with our past and things that we had, but you paid for us, Lord, we belong to you. So we want to treat one another right. Lord as we hold even Lord the the the bread and Lord as type of your body Lord as we bread I pray God that you would you would it would be it was broken for us. I pray that our fellowship would not we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Lord Jesus also for the wine. I pray that you'd bless it Lord as it flows through our bodies. May we, oh God, may we receive that healing, Lord, that we so desire, body, spirit, and soul. Pray for you to grant it now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. This turtle will direct you as you come. [Music] He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. Oh, I will worship him. I will worship him in spirit and in truth. Oh, I will worship him. [Music] I will worship him in spirit [Music] and [Music] Jesus breaks every feder. [Music] Jesus breaks every fedter. Oh Jesus breaks every fetter [Music] for he sets me free. Oh, I will ever ever praise him. [Music] I will ever ever praise him. Oh, I will ever I will ever praise him. him for he sets me free. [Music] Oh, in moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus. [Music] In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. [Music] Singing I love you, Lord. singing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. I love you. [Music] Oh, shut in with God in a secret place. there in the spirit beholding his face. And we're gaining new power to run in this race. I love to be shut in with God. Oh, sometimes hallelujah, [Music] sometimes praise the Lord, sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord. Lord. Oh, sometimes hallelujah. [Music] Sometimes praise the Lord. Sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord. Oh, sometimes hallelujah [Music] and sometimes praise the Lord. Sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord. Lord. Oh, sometimes hallelujah. Sometimes praise you, Lord. Sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord. Lord, I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. All my days have been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hands. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. And all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am aable, oh I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in the darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. And I have lived in the goodness of God. Oh, all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so. So good with every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh yes. And all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. [Music] With every breath that I am able, oh I will sing of the goodness of God. Sing it again. All my life, oh my life, &gt;&gt; you have been faithful. Oh, thank you Lord. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh yes, I will sing of the goodness. Oh yes we will. I will sing of the goodness of God. And all I want to do is love him. So glad I feel his love for me. Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of calary. [Music] &gt;&gt; So every day my heart will praise him. Oh, &gt;&gt; I know I'll ever be the same. &gt;&gt; Can we say that tonight? &gt;&gt; And all I want to do is love him. love his holy name. &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time. We're singing, "All I want to do is love him. So glad I feel his love for me. Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. Oh, so every day my heart will praise him. Thank you, Lord. I know I'll ever be the same. &gt;&gt; The same. Oh, &gt;&gt; and all I want to do is love him. Love his holy name. &gt;&gt; Amen. about to go into the footwashing service. And I uh want to say this before we read John chapter 13. I uh not very many churches do foot washing anymore. It's very very rare to do and it's a humbling experience and that's why we don't, you know, I know there's people today say, "Well, you can wash feet at home." That don't make any sense. It's about being a part of a body and it's about loving one another. And I want you to know tonight as your pastor that I love you. And I hope that you feel that. And you know we ought to have that love one for another. Brother Brandham talked about a time when the people at the tabernacle would come together and he said they'd cry because they had to leave one another on Wednesday night and had to leave one another for Sunday. I I see that in some of our kids, you know, they just really enjoy being around each other. I pray that would be the case with all of us. We don't want to we don't want to go to a church together and just be a cold bunch of people. We want to love one another. And Satan can get involved in that many times and try to do bad feelings and things, but let's just forgive one another. Just just let it go. Say, "Lord, I love I love you and I love your people. Just let it go." Human beings are We ain't much. We don't have much to brag about. None of us do. Yeah. If every one of us knew all of our failures and we displayed them out here on the screen, none of us would think much of each other. But what if we could come together and as we wash one another's feet say, "Lord, I thank you for my brother. Thank you for my sister. They may not, you know, be in my life all the time, but here at church, I get to fellowship with them, and they mean so much to me. You're going to be in heaven together one day. Might as well learn to get along." And getting along is just about not being stupid. I say it like that. I maybe I'm being a little bit free tonight, but let's not be stupid. Let's let's love one another. You young people, you get all the, you know, you get little things and you know, who wants to play what game and who wants to do this and who's who's dating who or who's going with this one and stuff like that. Let's just let that go. Love one another. Serve God with all of your heart and things will turn out okay. God's got a plan for your life. He It'll be okay. Amen. Do you love him tonight? I don't know why I said that, but maybe I'm just tired, but maybe the Lord has a way of speaking to us in our weakness. You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; This This is a great scripture. We just read this but John chapter 13 says said verse three Jesus knowing the father had given all things into his hands. Other words he had all the power that he was come from God went to God. What did he do with that knowledge? He riseth from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel, and girded himself. After that, he pou water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet. He took the part of the footwash flunky, the lowest servant that there was. And cometh he to Simon Peter, and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter." Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "I if I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, he that is washed needeth not, saved to wash his feet, and is but is clean every wit. And you are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore, he said, "You are not all clean, but he washed Judah's feet, too." [Music] After he had washed their feet, and taken his garments was set down again, he said to them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done unto you, verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. I believe we could be happy tonight doing the word of God. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this time. Thank you for these people. Thank you for your blood. Thank you for Lord that you loved us first. When we were unlovable, Lord, you loved us. We thank you for that, Lord. I pray you just move, Lord, in this part of the service. May we not just rush through it, but Lord, may it be a part that we understand, Lord, we're doing this because you did this. Lord, may we look at that person that we're washing their feet as we're washing the your feet. Pray you'd grant it now. We ask you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. The brothers, we'll go back here. The deacons will direct you back there. The sisters in the back. God bless you tonight. &gt;&gt; I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Oh, do you need him tonight?
