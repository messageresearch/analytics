we'll start reading in verse 19 and read down through verse 25 James 1 19. then we have good Services last weekend I know some of y'all are just recovering but I've had so many good testimonies of of the meetings and how brought people closer to the Lord and and people closer to each other and fellowship and so grateful for that and but we just believe the Lord is going to continue to work let's make this morning another time when we can be brought closer to the Lord and and he can just work in our lives we believe he can do that today amen where two or three are gathered together he said I yeah I will be in the midst amen I believe that he's here this morning and if he's here anything is possible he's able to meet our needs amen James chapter 1 and verse 19 he said wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to Wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word it's just able to save your souls but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is likened to a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I'd like to preach this morning if I would title the message it would be identifying your present character in the mirror of God's word I I heard a story about a missionary who had a mirror and he he took his this mirror and he was using it to shave with he was in a a tropical island somewhere and and he used this mirror hung on a tree to shave and uh the people there the natives they'd never seen a mirror and one day a witch doctor a female witch doctor came by the camp where he was and and she saw that mirror and she said I want to buy that off of you I want to trade for that and she let him know I want that mirror and and he said well I I don't want to give that up that's what I used to shave with but she kind of pressed him a little bit let him know that it'd be good for his health if she got that mirror and and so he gave it to her and she takes that mirror and brother Bill she she grabbed it grabbed it off of the tree she takes it and just just smashes it on the ground and what had happened is she'd seen herself in the mirror and she was all painted up and and pierced and and like she was and and when she she smashed it on the ground she said there she said you'll never make me ugly again and the truth is she just finally saw herself for what she was we need to pass out the mirrors don't we and let people if people can only see what they really are but but that's difficult to do now we know that brother Branham taught us that the mirror is God's word he uh the Bible he he talked about how that the little boy had never seen a mirror and he went down to his aunt's house there in the city and he goes down and he sees a mirror and at the end of the hallway and he looks there's little boys standing there and he looks at me and he gets to wave and the little boy waved and uh he moved and little boy moved and finally he turned around he looked at his mother he said Mama he said that's me and he said that's the way we ought to be with the word of God that we can look in the mirror of God's word and identify our present character in that mirror that we ought to be able to see that the word matches what we are and what we do not just in church not just the this message did not come to restore us back to a church religion or restore us back where we can see that our services are a mirrored by gods or they should be but it's more than that it's a it's a reality in our everyday life that on Monday I can I can look in the mirror of the word and see I'm still a Christian on Tuesday on Wednesday all through the week I'm still a child of God and the mirror reflects my character shows me what I am in reality and so brother Brown in identification if you go in and listen to that I'd encourage you to do that he preaches this in 1963 preaches it several times but the one he preached in 1963 in January he said now let us look in God's mirror word and identify our present character not identify our church or identify the pastor or identify the people we're with or or even our own family but to identify ourself to identify me in the mirror of God's word do I match up am I what I should be I think every one of us ought to be willing to do that today now the problem with human nature is that we we don't want to look squarely in a mirror because the only way to get an accurate reflection see sometimes mirrors lie and the reason a mirror would lie is because of the angle at which you approach it or the amount of light that's on it or some object that would get in the way so if the mirror is the right mirror then you have to recognize that that the mirror is is an accurate reflection but it could be held in the wrong way and so many times what we do you know what you do and you take a selfie if some of you do that if you what you do is you take your phone and and you lift it up way up like this and you look down and try to get it where it won't show the double chin and and and you're taking you you you turn it like you've seen people do that and and only in our age you know there'll be there'll be a beautiful natural Vista in front of them and and creeks and mountains and things there'll be somebody like this you know they're not looking at what God made they're looking at them so well they are but they're looking at themselves and but they're they got it they want to check look the mirror they gotta turn it just right and make it just right where they're able to see themselves but they don't want to really want to see what they really are but what they're really viewing is is what what they want people to think that they are instead of what they are now they have the same mirror the same camera that you have but if you if you've ever been around Esther Esther can take some pictures she likes to take candid photos of people just random people she's probably got some of you all and and she does that to my mother every week she takes photos of a mom and sends them to her through the week and it just it might be you eating or the stewards experience that you know might be you sitting down in kind of an awkward Manner and and she does it she does it to me when I'm sleeping if I fall asleep in my chair or whatever that that is she she takes a picture of that and really that's what we really are that's the way we looked but you don't like that picture do you that's right there's a reason why we haven't had a family picture in about 10 years we've decided we don't like the way we're aging now come on it was the time I like to look in the mirror but not now look but the mirror if it's God's word it must be held in such a way that the reflection is accurate yeah yeah that's why we have pastors that's why we have ministry that's why we have evangelists that's why we hold meetings because we want somebody we take the mirror take that selfie away from you let somebody else hold the mirror in front of us so we can see I need that you need that in our age God called a prophet to hold the mirror just right so we can see it in the correct lighting so we can see exactly what the word was so now we want to identify our true character so to get an accurate reflection you got to stand squarely before a full-length mirror in the proper light and look at the mirror now so it can't be a rough surface now a mirror has to be smooth there's a reason for that because if it's rough it'll it'll disperse the light rays because the mirror is just reflecting the Rays of light so a perfectly Steel Lake with nothing in it could be could you could see yourself in it but a lake that that's choppy and and the waves are going you can't see yourself in that Lake because the lights being scattered instead of reflecting so sometimes we need to calm down and get still and we need to recognize we need to just take an honest look in God's mirror so brother random tells us he said we we see in God's mirror not in your church mirror now in God's mirror and see if you could qualify in your life as being the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ so now and the only way we can do that by the way is by the blood of Jesus so you got to be able to look at yourself let him hold the mirror and look at yourself in the proper way but the Bible says it tells us about the nature of man it says there's a way that seems right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death if you if you were to take a hundred different opinions you get a hundred different answers of what's right and what's wrong but today we go that's the reason we have the word God won't judge us by my opinion he won't judge us by Brother Joel's opinion brother Stewart's opinion or any of you brothers or sisters he won't do that but he judges Us by the mirror of the word so there's a way that seems right but the end they're over the ways of death proverbs 30 12 there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes oh we see that today don't we they think they're virtuous they think they're righteous yet they're not washed from their filthiness so men have this consistent inability to examine themselves Jesus dealt with this with the Pharisees in Matthew 7 and 3. he said why behold us thou the moat that word means the the speck or the Splinter that is in thy brother's eye but consider us not the beam the rafter the log that is in your own eye right so you can behold and you can you see it and that word behold means to look at from afar so you're way off you're not close to the situation you really don't know that much about it but you got an opinion about it anyway and you're able to look out and see oh there's a speck yeah there's a speck but in reality you don't know if there is one or not because you got an old beam in your own eye and even if you could go to that person now watch what he says next how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye in other words the brother is going to say well you can't see you wanna you wanna do surgery on me you want to take a pair of tweezers and grab the speck out of my eye and you've got a log in your eye yeah I'm gonna find me the old same physician here yourself I'm gonna find me a person that doesn't have a speck I'll tell you the only one that never had a speck was Jesus Christ yes sir how are you going to say to your brother let me pull out the people people can't tell they can't see themselves they see the spec yeah yeah far off in somebody else's eye in another church right in another place in the pastor of the trustees or the deacons or some other family or maybe in their wife or their husband but what about the log what about the the rafter the beam in your own eye yeah Jesus says Thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine owner it's good that you want to help people but make sure that you can see clearly before you go to picking specks out of your brother's eye So and I've seen it so much and I I just preaching to you this morning as a pastor would and and just so that we'll understand well you get criticized sometimes and and it's just that's going to come you can't do anything without criticism and brother Branham said that Jesus walked unconscious of criticism and he said he never did pay any attention it didn't change the critics he said didn't change what Jesus did right they say that was the difference in General Grant and and the other Union Generals that went against Lee the other Union Generals were always trying to figure out what league was doing and and General Grant just said well we got more men we got more equipment we got more time we're gonna we're gonna just do what we do and we'll forget about General Lee we'll just do what we do and he ended up defeating him and and so that's what we've got to do but you get criticism and I know we have meetings and things and I know there's people that think we're fanatical they need to come to church sometime and and see I don't think we're fanatical enough we could we could handle a little bit more praise a little bit more worship a little more Hallelujah we can handle a little bit more hey I'll be honest with you I I think uh if you get out of control we'll we'll let you know but people get critical because they're just going to find something to criticize and and but they fail to see and if we're not careful we'll do the same thing you see because our own beam we can't see it yeah people critical of fanaticism in the eye of another church but can't see that their own flock is suffering yeah yeah right losing your you lose your young people you got no move of the spirit at all and they're going out and becoming homosexuals and everything else listen it's a real thing and you're going to criticize somebody because they love God somebody because they worship somebody but you didn't know you don't know what that person come out of you don't know what their past is you don't know what they've overcome to be in the house of God I mean you may have been always a Christian you may have always done everything just right but as long as I'm in this flesh in this body I worship God with all of my heart and the reason is because I know what I was I know what I can save me from I know what he's kept me from the Native and I'm not going to be afraid to worship it all right you can be critical all you want to but I don't want to be in the house for the critic I don't want to sit in the seat of the scoring fail to see people suffering and dying yeah well they're Fanatics I'd rather be a fanatic for Christ and sit and die but again it's easy for us for for everybody to get that to get that that beam in your eye start looking for specks expecting your eye was just them old dirty glasses you ever done that your glasses get dirty I Can See Clearly Now can't see much at all a speck in the eye I don't like to wear glasses I did I put it off to us almost 30 years old wearing glasses finally couldn't put it off any longer I couldn't see road signs no more and I finally quit you know I missed a few exits and I finally quit finally gave up and went to the went to the doctor but every once in a while there's a speck on your eye and you think my goodness my goodness why don't they wash those windows laughs I remember I sat in church for years and complained I complained for years in fact we bought a bigger screens in the church I was going to because I thought that you you couldn't read the screen those too small I thought it was blurry and I got glasses it's like praise God now I can see but it's hard to evaluate ourselves it's hard to look at herself it's easy to look at somebody else and say well hey they need to lose weight he's too emotional he's not emotional enough he he's a fanatic he's cold but it's hard to look at yourself yeah the round said a good road is built the highest part is in the center because it lets all the trash wash off both sides he said when a man really comes to Christ he's got his eyes centered on Christ if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a little bit cold he'll get on this other side and be just a cucumber over on that side see his intellectual but the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you keep you warm and moving and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit to move just as the spirit moves not dealing not after just as the spirit moves again he talked about a lot of rain Brethren that had pulled off from the main group he said that's right different with the group of Brethren that pulled off here not long ago from The Way of Light he said they just couldn't see the phenomena being done unless they made themselves a group so they gathered up in Canada made a group of people that they were going to give out and make Apostles and Prophets out of one another and things he said it fell right through and it always will he said they feel that because if they are he said they don't listen he said they so condemned the other things till they go Plum on the other side he said there's one side that's highly intellectual cold and indifferent they deny everything there and the others get on the other side on the other side with a radical bunch of emotion that deny the word but you know the problem was never the emotion the problem was denying the word he said but the real true church stays right in the middle of the road he said if you notice it's got the Bible knowledge of what God Said and it's spiritual enough to be warm in his heart and it's just the road but you better be looking right in the mirror and it'd be held right yeah yeah that's why we don't want to Discount what the message says all right God called that man for a reason there's a reason why president said what he said you know just lightly take lightly what brother Brandon said because he God called him to hold the mirror he wasn't even the mirror but he was called to hold it in a way we could see what this age ought to be and how to apply the word to the life of a believer in this age now the foolish man and you just let me preach for a minute this morning I appreciate your patience but I I just want to get this off my heart I'm not preaching at you but I just want us to be to to always examine ourselves to know where we're at the foolish man doesn't need anyone to straighten his mirror he's a law in his own eyes and he's got everything just so oh you know I don't want nobody to tell me what to do I've had people tell me that I I can't take any instruction I don't want any and be honest with you you can't force them to do it all right you can't make them take instruction you can't make them listen and so you just back off and you just let them go because a person's got to find out for themselves but but the foolish man you know it's a foolish thing to do to not take counsel right it's a foolish thing to not accept accept things when it's a right thing you know it's one thing to take counsel from somebody who's uh who's done everything wrong but it's another thing if you see somebody that they've succeeded in a certain area you want to take counsel from them they say the biggest obstacle to making money in business is people trying to reinvent the wheel they're trying to redo it and they said what you ought to do is go find somebody who's done it before because there's nothing new Under the Sun and so if you find somebody who's been successful as a principal somebody you've been successful as a teacher somebody's been successful are you with me now somebody's been successful as a pastor somebody who've been successful in their marriage find that person and talk to them right because that's the person that ought to be able to know and and maybe they're holding maybe they can hold a mirror in the right angle and so but a foolish man doesn't need anybody he won't let nobody come up to him and say well hey you know that angle you're holding that don't show you just right he just said oh my I'm I'm thin I'm beautiful oh praise God the way I worship God is just right say well God doesn't accept all worship that's right they don't he don't accept your will worship he doesn't accept you worshiping just the way you want to that's true he doesn't he doesn't accept you worshiping outside the blood but God don't God don't accept your your hypocrisy and legalism either well the way I do it man it's just right God help us today you know you know ultimately the reason that people have I'm just preaching this morning you know why people believe most of what they believe because they believe it why is that true you know you've been told I I was told lots of things by my mother and you know she told me if I if I held my face that way and stay that way you've been told that if you if you sit too close to the screen you'll you'll go blind you know and lots of things and that may be true I there's probably some some element of truth but if you really go get down to it it's true and you know why your mama told you why because I said so that's why hahaha if I say the Earth is flat and I pay your bills and give you your cereal in the morning and and fix you dinner at night as long as I'm cooking for you and what I say goes right but we can't be that way when it comes to the word and because of every every fool is right in his own eyes that's what the Bible says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he's at hearken the Thunder counsel is wise and that's I know people don't want somebody tell them what to do but that's our job as ministers not to reinvent the mirror not to hold up something else but to take the mirror of God's word and just point it right at the people right that's my job it's to take it and just hold it right here where you can see that's Harold Bailey in the word that that's Glenn in the word that's me in the word we don't want to always hear that and the minister don't always want to hold it that way it's got to be done we could look at I always told people I'd Rather somebody told me if I had a a wardrobe malfunction my collar was turned up if my button came off something like that somebody please come tell me yeah because I can't see myself standing up here right so I always did that for brother Ivey if he come out with his collar turned up like that you know and he'd come out and everybody's sitting there going like this you know you can't look at that's hard isn't it that's tough hope I got it down it came out like that and I just walk up behind him and turn it down there's a reason for that I'd Rather somebody fixed it just just move my mirror that's why we ought to pray when we come to the house of God move that mirror where where I can see myself because I'm not good at looking and finding what's wrong with me but I know that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and he's gonna sometimes I think I'm not going to make it sometimes I think I've done too much I've done too many bad things but the word is a discerner the thought sentence of the heart and the word knows there's a seed on the inside that's going to make it there's a seed that's going to be there there's that you were there before in the mind of God before the foundation the word knows you're not good at holding up the mirror but he is so brother Branham takes his identification he said we can look at different ages and see ourselves if we looked honestly we could look at I don't have time to go through all the quotes this morning but if we could be with Cain or Abel we could be with Noah or the scientists yeah so he says you you identify a character in The Bible That's how you look in the mirror you identify a character in The Bible and see how your image fits that character how your character fits their character would you be Abraham with Abraham or lot would you be with Esau or Jacob Moses or Nathan we can look at that in hindsight and say well with Moses because Nathan got swallowed up but what about before he got swallowed up right with Esau or with Jacob rather because we know what the end of Esau was but what you would you have been with Jacob before would you have been with Abraham when he went up in the plane of mammary and nothing seemed to be going right and law is down there partying having a good time become the mayor of the city who would you spend your time with who would you stand with oh we need to take sides with Jesus today so brother Brown would use all those types and but then he taught us that the perfect example that we ought to be looking at because all of those men had flaws all of those women had flaws but now Jesus is the perfect example for all of us to be able to see in the mirror and see what kind of a character we ought to have he said now Jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into God's mirror we should see ourself identified with him he said that is a perfect example your pastor will never be a perfect example the church will never be a perfect example but when I concede the word made flesh that is a perfect image of what God wanted all right do you believe that today amen and he said and when we he said when we seen it when he seen that his creation had fallen I love this you need to go listen to the sermon I don't have time to to give it justice this morning brother Brown preaches identification he preaches about Christ he said when he seen that his creation had fallen he said now his own loving character molded himself into the person of Christ so the atmosphere of Christ was a result of the character of God Elohim poured himself into Christ and the character or the atmosphere of Christ but the man talks about how each one of us in that sermon he talks about each one of us are a Dynamo he said we're a Dynamo we create an atmosphere around us and so the atmosphere that we create is a result of our character atmosphere is character expressed you ever thought about that it's hard to put on a right atmosphere that's right because atmosphere is character expressed the atmosphere of the world today is the character of Satan expressed he could not create it but he but he perverts it into an atmosphere and it shows us the character of Satan but the atmosphere in the Garden of Eden shows us the character of God right well there's no death no suffering none of that and so it shows us his character but now what God was Oh my he molded himself into the person of Christ that was God's character on display God's atmosphere on display and brother Brandon taught us that's why he had to be born of a virgin he could not come by sexual desire because the the he said even as good as those other women were he could not even be the egg could not even be from the woman you understand what I'm saying this one he could not it had to be all God he said because it would have been any part of the women he said Sarah was a good woman and all these other women were good women but it could not be part of them because if it had been part of them but the dead he didn't he would have expressed some part of him would have expressed the character of Sarah or the character of Rebecca or the character of any of these other women but when he came he did not express the character of Joseph he did not express the character of Mary he did not express the character of the disciple but he expressed the character of God himself God pouring himself into a life that's why when people tell me he said where brother Daryl Ward last Saturday morning did such a marvelous job preaching about Christ's suffering and what he did for us people say well we're beyond that how are we beyond God himself how are we beyond the character of God himself expressed to us how could we ever get beyond that had a person one time leave this church and tell me they didn't go here to church but they came on Sunday and they left and they told somebody well said he don't uh he don't preach and I don't think he bad towards them just the way they're geared but that he Don't Preach modern day he don't pre he Don't Preach where we're at today he just preaches 2 000 years ago well if you can't see what he did for you 2 000 years ago you can't see what he's doing for you right now because he's the same yesterday today and forever he expressed his character for a reason Paul said I will read it just won't be thinking I'm not robbery but making himself equal to God he said see his own character molded that kind of a person he said no one could ever do that but God and he said that explains to us John 3 16. for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life he said I used to think that the father was angry with me but Jesus loved me and I find out through the same person right God so loved he said he was that great attribute of God Called Love he was in one place he said he was the very heart of God and it was expressed in a person he said god Jehovah overshadowed a virgin and created the blood cell and when that was born it was the son of God in other words it was a tabernacle it was a dwelling place where Jehovah could live among his people and express himself what he was now if there had been any part of me in that expression I would have made life a little bit easier I'm just being honest with you because of Human Experience right we try to make life easier on our children as we rightfully should but it's our Human Experience right that's taught us that we we in our Human Experience we've learned I'd rather not do without I'd rather have have things I'd rather live in a certain way and so there had been any expression of the character of been through it in Christ he would have not come the way he came oh God he would not have done what he did if there had been any don't you see why we work all of our Lives posted I keep under my body and bring it under subjection unless having preach to others I myself become a Castaway because if there was any part of Jeremy Erskine in that in that flesh of Jesus Christ he would not have manifested right then if he wants to manifest himself back the other way what do we have to do we Hope Church we've got to get to the place where there's no part of us just still expressing our old gift our old man is still there but Paul said I keep it down I keep it under it's still prickly it's still awful but what do we have to do we have to express his word oh my I would want the best I would want the brightest to be there to record my birth if I was going to be born and be God he chose Shepherds listen he chose a Manger he says he said what an example how that the holy God made manifest and then notice what he did he took the place of the servant to wash feet can we hold up the mirror for a minute this morning just look at it honestly honestly he said he took the place of a servant to wash feet and spoke that the birds have nests and the foxes have dents but I don't have a place to lay my head and we get so worried about having things and having money and all these things I don't say you we should take care of our children we should make as much money as we can I'm all for it I'm all for it because the better the people live the better the ministry can live I'm all for that but I'd rather see you love God with all of your heart I'd rather see if you might be poor as a church mouse I might have to pay tithes to you for you to come to church and you might be so poor that you can't hardly make it I'd rather see you poor and living for God I'd rather see you poor and love in your family I'd rather see you poor and live in the way God wants you to live that's what he did we have comfortable I have a comfortable home you have comfortable homes I've got nice cars you didn't huh said what an example he said how would our life reflect to his and he made the example of what we should do I don't say you shouldn't have nice things but don't let that be all of your choices don't let all of your choices just reflect the carnal urge to become a greater Hunter a greater fisherman have a drive a nicer car have a better have a better home don't let everything that you do reflect that but let it be the Inner Man of the Heart Lord how can I build my character I'm not going to deliberately do something to hurt my family but how can my character become the character of Christ how can I be molded into more humble take suffering in the right way how can I be humbled into that character he said we should see him when you look in the mirror we should see him when we look in the mirror he says see Christ the mirror of his word how he did that for love he said now you study that character a little bit and then look at yourself and I look at myself but that's what he was that's who he was that's why he was I love that that's what he was that's who he was that's why he was to save you yes he become you that you might become him or have we lost our sense of of all in the presence of that statement he become you that you might become him he took your load of sin therefore when we come to meet him we will not have to stand we could not stand in the presence of God there's no way for us to do it but when we stand in him he's already recognized that sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he recognized it there was no blemish on him yet he suffered Temptation like any other man yet he was scorned he was made fun of he was persecuted from the hour he was born until he died and yet he returned good for evil let me be that way Lord he was first you from the hour he was born until the hour he died but he always returned good for evil you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you a church cannot do that can you hear me this morning a church cannot do that a Creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that and education cannot do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying Outlet God in by the grace of Christ mold this type of character in you that you become him and your life and his is the same then you are Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah let's look some more in the mirror you know the Bible teaches us he was our example in humility yeah everyone thinks they're humble laughs all right let's just be honest very few people very few people you know every time I get thinking about my own humility I'm proud of it why do you want I humbled myself man it's the truth just the way we are everybody thinks but does our humility match what you see in the mirror you said but but you don't understand where I came from or what was done to me no that's not what we're supposed to match we don't want any part of us in it does our humility match what we see in the mirror are we arrogant I'm Amazed and how arrogant people can be after being stupid look at Saul in the Bible King Saul he walks up there and the prophet stands in front and said you've not done what God told you to do the King Saul stood there and said I've done everything before a man he knew was a Vindicated Prophet the only reason he was King is because that man was prophet yeah and yet he stood there and said I got no faults look at King David when a man come up and said and Nathan tells him the story about the about the one who stole the lamb and King David said he ought to die [Music] look at the arrogance of that you ought to die God had mercy on David the prophet stuck his finger in his face and said you're the man oh God everybody thinks they're humble but does our humility match what we see in the mirror Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you let this mind being you which was also in Christ Jesus if you ever wanted to think like Einstein I imagined when I was young that I could do that now I can't even remember my wife's name sometimes and that's not because I've had more than one I've only had one but when I was young I I thought because I had a big head I had a big brain I couldn't find out it wasn't the same let this mind not the mind of Einstein not the mind of of somebody some great scientist or not the mind of some preacher not the mind of some great man but this mind the mind of Jesus yes this mind which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God is not robbery to be equal with God in other words he knew who he was but he made himself of no reputation brother random taught us the man who invented the the false knee has a reputation the man who invented the the the false hip the fake hip has got a a reputation because he did something good for Humanity but the man who made the original one made himself of no reputation he took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men yeah yeah that's a humble thing when you're God to become a man yeah and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also has highly exalted him given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow things in heaven things and Earth things under the Earth every time she confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father I want you to notice how Jesus did Ministry he didn't push himself on people I didn't say give me a job let me preach right I'm not preaching any of my preachers here because God knows y'all y'all always willing to give up the pulpit but so I'm not preaching at you but that's the way we ought to be sometimes you know you want something you want to be seen Jesus didn't didn't push himself look what he did in Mark 7 31. are you still with me this morning I I don't want to wear you out I can always quit Mark 7 31 again departing from the coast of Tire I mean quit this sermon I'm not gonna quit all together somebody like praise is the Lord he said again departing from the coastal tire and sight on you come into the Sea of Galilee through the midst of the coast of decapolis and they bring unto him one that was death and I had an impediment in his speech and they beseeched him to put his hand upon him he's deaf and he can't speak well because he can't hear huh and he took him aside from the multitude put his fingers in his ears and he spit and touched his tongue he he said brother man God don't accept all worship y'all have been prayer lines and such and people people are people are getting too emotional explain to me why Jesus spit and touched the tongue of this man and why he only did it once and didn't do it again why are you spitting the clay that time and put clay in a man's eyes and told him to go wash and the man had to stumble down to the pool asking for directions until he went and washed himself in the pool and then he could see yeah explain that God does what he wants to right we got to let God do what he wants yeah what we don't want is a form of worship whether it's a form of emotion or a form of anything else we want God to be able to do what God wants to do spitting touch this time what I don't fit covert protocols at all looking up to heaven he sighed that is be opened and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain you know sometimes I have to take a baby because her tongue is tied God did a surgery miraculous on this man and it says he speak plain and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it I don't have time to go through all the scriptures this morning but you could go and look in the New Testament and Jesus is constantly saying one thing don't tell nobody over and over and over and I'll be honest with you the human part of me when I see God doing something supernaturally and doing something wonderful like what he's done for you and I think we should testify I'm not against testifying but that it helps us because we are human right it helps us because we are human but God you know when he come on the earth he he was constantly telling the people don't tell it uh and he wasn't it wasn't because he didn't want him to worship he wanted them to come and worship what the oh God he didn't want the people he didn't want the people to you realize that Jesus did not want the people to make him an idol that's a hard statement for us to hear Jesus did not want the people to make that flesh an idol and that's only when they come to him said great Master he said don't call me great why you call me great there's one great and that's God don't tell nobody about it today we want to make prophets Idols we want to make pastors Idols we want to make people idols Jesus didn't want that perfect flesh to be an idol yeah he said don't tell nobody about it look at his humility and he wasn't doing that to put on he wasn't doing that because he's thinking well if I tell him not to tell then they'll tell and then it'll seem more you know more generic and be more like it really happened that more organic that that's not what he was doing it was from his heart now look and they were beyond measure astonished so people were saying he had done all things well I like that response to the move of the Holy Ghost I like that response to what God does I don't understand why he spit on his on his finger and touches the lip to the man's lips I don't understand why he's spit in the sand and touch the Man's eyes with Clay I don't understand why he raised the dead in one instance and in another instance he did it a different way and in another instance he did it another way why would one place he sends everybody out and in another place he does it publicly I don't understand but he does all things well oh my can we say him into that today whatever he's done in my life he did well make it both the Deft of here and the dumb to speak and now the disciples weren't like this the disciples he gave him power to overcome devils right they were working under that Authority he gave them in Luke 10 17 and 70. remember they went out and cast out devils and healed the sick and the seventy returned again with joy oh praise God even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and Jesus I love this because I detect a little bit of humor in verse 18. because Jesus knew who he was and these 70 come back said we can do the same thing you can Jesus my goodness why look at all this look at this we're casting out Devils all over the place and and he said you know I saw Satan as lightning fall from Heaven I said boy you guys are powerful one place brother Brandon said you you told him he said you you shook the devil you shook that he really did tell you what boys man well if I could only have a Ministry like yours you know yeah you shook the devil your healing campaigns but there's more to it I think than even that because if you've been to look at you begin to realize that he said I'll be held Satan fall Satan fell from his position Jesus condescended and came down Satan had to be removed oh God Jesus voluntarily took the lowest place he said Jesus told the people he said when you go his disciples said when you go to a feast he said don't sit in the top spot because you think you're the most important person he said because there might be somebody more important than you and I want to say this in all of our services in all of our meetings there's somebody more important than the preacher there's somebody who is Christ the word because he said when you go to the feast he said don't take the top spot because there might be somebody and you'll be embarrassed when you get removed out of that seat oh God oh God but but they were always because they didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't have not that carnal nature was shining through even though they had power with God but they didn't have the Holy Ghost and it didn't control their lives and so he's teaching them a lesson now brother Branham when he deals with this scripture I've beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven he says this he said see Satan was the original Archangel of God he once dwelt in the heaven he once was the greatest person in the heavens outside of God he was God's right hand man to Fellowship he got puffed up in his heart isn't that just the way that people get today let God just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him he gets to be a know-it-all he gets to start an organization or he's got something that's different why aren't that fallen from Heaven o Lucifer he said God has a hard time trying to get somebody he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until God calls him to do something he said a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man and not be an angel or a god well I thank God for this message of the hour because we we had a Prophet come in our day that was all God blessed him above he had a Ministry like no other but yet he kept himself a man he kept himself a man it would not be called an angel or a god said as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do yeah what me and mine brother Daryl I'm praying for brother Daryl he's had booked him today he's doing a little bit better today watch brother Daryl Ward Serve the People of God and and just really give his body sacrifices his bodies people of God but he he told me something years ago and I heard him repeat it to a young preacher this weekend and really it's true it's good advice he said there's two dangerous times in your ministry that when you first start and then when God begins to use you those are dangerous times because you begin to think you're somebody yeah well look at that I did good you know you got to have confidence in what you're doing you got to know that you're called right but it's a dangerous place because when God begins to use you then you begin to think oh well I'm so much better than I was maybe it's just your season all right that well I'm a better preacher maybe it's just your season I was talking about the David earlier you know our lives are like this and we see what our lives are you forgive me for just a minute you see what our lives are and then you see there's a little maybe you change one thing maybe you went to McDonald's one time change that right one thing about one day but but maybe instead of being who you are you're quadriplegic it had a wreck right yeah you change one little thing yeah yeah I've told you the story how one time I got a job because I looked in my my spam email folder and have been sitting there for months a job offer and I've been sitting that whole time griping about my job wanting a different job and it was all the time in my email folder right but me just happened to check it because usually I just hit the delete button and that day I happened to check it and it changed the course of my life right and it changed the course of my family see things we look at little things just little bitty things can make such a difference and that's why we always ought to look up and see when we're sitting there under that apple tree that's what's talked about we don't want to just sit there and eat the apples we want to look up and see where's it coming from there's one little difference in your life for the day you don't know just a millisecond of difference how many times have you almost gotten a wreck or almost to this or maybe you did and it changed you or maybe you had and I look at pastors that have had cancer or heart trouble or something like that and you look at how it changes their Ministry and I think that's that I'm not immune to that right things can change one little moment one little time brother Ben preaches from that time and he talks about how from that time everything changes one more wrong decision or one little right decision and you don't have that much to do with it but you don't realize what it's leading to right I think I believe we ought to be thankful today I believe we ought to worship today I believe we're blessed today to be where we are to be what we are brother Branham talked about this one that wanted me and me and mine he said that's the wrong attitude God's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more he blessed the little of the man will become oh help me Lord he said you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself God will bring a base he that will humble himself God will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as God will be big in you oh I say God be big in me today be big in my family be big in the church be big I can't be big enough to make the meet the challenge of the hour God be big in me Jesus knew they were in danger when they come up there and they said all the devils are subject to us and a few days later they would all desert him and then Judas would even betray him look what he said in verse 19 behold I give it to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you I said praise God he said notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven he was King Of Heaven yet he didn't have a place to lay his head his name in heaven was all-powerful but on Earth it was cursed spies it was our example and humility with our example in suffering we'll dwell in this for just a minute and we'll go he said servants first Peter 2 18 be subject to your masters with all fear or respect not only to the good and gentle but also to the fro word that word forward is the word scolios is where you get scoliosis crooked right so in other words he's saying there's going to be bosses that are crooked praise God it's just gonna happen but he's dealing with and he deals with bosses in different places now God will allow you to have at times crooked perverse harsh employers but God forbid that we would be that right now he brother Brown said this I wonder tonight if many people here and listening tonight he said hasn't cheated their neighbor just a little bit done a little crooked deal he said I pray that if that be the case you'll hear the tinkling of that money till it sends you to your knees of repentance well brother Ben how did you get on that we if we have the character of Christ if we see ourselves in the mirror of the word he would rather he be defrauded than to defraud someone else he would rather himself be used than to use someone else oh God see we should be honest even if we suffer for it a man who will take advantage of another man from personal gain is a man who needs to be born again and that works for employers and employees because if you get if you become an employee for somebody and and you just wanna you just want to sit there and do nothing and not work then you'll have to answer for to God for that but if you become an employer of someone and you think well this is the way I'm going to get rich is by employing especially a brother or a sister God help us that we would think that way about people who work for us because a man who will take advantage of another man from personal gain is a man who needs to be look in the mirror again say it that way because he didn't do that I've seen pastors that were willing to take advantage of people financially God forbid God forbid that I would get more than I give are you with me now I'm just making myself an example not to you but an example of uh uh in the sense of how I should act look I want to be I want to be one who gives more than I get because God's been so good to me he's been so good to me let me be one who is even if people do me wrong I don't give that back I'm not going to abuse you because you abused me yeah yeah Lord help me to understand how lucky I am are you with me this morning help me to know help me to see in the mirror and see how blessed I am and see that I'm a blessed man I may have had troubles but I'm a blessed man I refuse to gripe constantly sometimes I gripe but every time I begin to cry I begin to think Lord you and your word I could have been anything but you would by Your Word have molded me and and brought me into a place where I never dreamed I could be in spiritually speaking Lord I want to stay there help me to stay there I owe it all to you I'm a blessed man can you say Amen to that today we're a blessed people he said this is think worthy of a man for conscience toward God and that's doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do God forbid that we as ministers would leave a name of being a con man for for decades God forbid huh I still hear about it ministers they've even passed on or ones that claim to believe this message I'm not talking about anybody sitting here people that claim to believe this message and they they passed on and and then you come back and look or maybe they're they're still living but they're getting older and you look at their life and just one con after another God forbid just preaching to you this morning if I have to be walked on let me be walked on this is think worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief that's hard for me to preach that way church not my nature but I want to make sure I want to make sure that we understand we should not take that from people we should not take that and what I mean what I mean by that is you don't have to give it back to them but you don't have to sit there and be swindled either huh if if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully what glory is it if will you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently or they slap you around because you're false but when you do well and suffer for it because sometimes you will you take it patiently this is acceptable with God and this is much harder than it sounds you try to bring people together you get criticized on every side but why keep doing it we're going to do it again we'll keep doing it why keep doing it because it's right yeah right he said for even hearing too where you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps that word example is I've preached it to you before it's the model of handwriting copy by Schoolboy here's the handwriting you see it up on the wall the perfect example of what it ought to be but I never could do that but the Bailey never could write just like what they wanted me to write but I remember as a kindergartner when when the my teacher come down and she took my hand and she wrote it looked just like what was on the board why because I just gave myself into the hand of the teacher that's what we need to do today that's the only way that we can express the character of Christ let us give ourselves into the hand of the teacher where he can write the perfect example what we ought to be who did no sin neither was guile that's deceit treachery oh God I read this I said Lord let me be without Kyle as a pastor let the deacons be without God the trustees the congregation let us not be a people who do things for an ulterior motive let us be as people who do things for the right reasons because it's the right thing to do he said let love Romans 12 9 let love be without the simulation in other words let it be let it be truthful let it be honest let it not be fake unfined he said the end of the Commandment is out of a pure heart of a good conscience of Faith unfeigned or not not a fake Faith but a real faith but random sit there in that token he said it's a positive token that your lamb died you received a token upon yourself his very life is in you there is no make-belief there is no put on there is no impersonation it's there you know what the world knows that the token is there you don't have to hold the mirror up like this and say Well when I'm in church I I'm a Believer I have the token but what about at home put it right in front of you look squarely at it yeah look at the example in the mirror verse 23 who when he was reviled oh this is hard reviled not again publicly or privately right right how do you know that brother Ben because Judas none of the other disciples knew who Jesus was or Judas was he didn't revile publicly he could have called James and John aside and say well come here you know what he told him he said one of you is a devil just so they would know that he knew they had no clue who it was do you have to move the mirror a little bit would I have to move the mirror a little bit to look like Jesus let me go a little bit farther does the man in the mirror more like Jesus and we're like Judas Judas sought Revenge yeah Jesus embarrassed Judas when he the woman's feet was washed Jesus mildly rebukes him it embarrassed him he said from that time he began to seek he began to seek to destroy him yeah because he didn't like the preaching of the word he couldn't look in the mirror that Jesus died for his enemies yeah said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he said to his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed can you place yourself there with him I don't believe we can without the Holy Ghost we're not able to change ourselves but the Bible says we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord our change into that same image oh I'm so glad for the changing power of the Holy Ghost I'm so glad when I come in the presence of God he said we're changed from glory to glory people say well it's just word only no that's not what the Bible says we're changing to the image of the word by the glory from glory to glory the glory is the Shekinah Glory the presence of the pillar of fire he said even by the spirit of the Lord we must be like him we must be like him how we must receive the Holy Ghost
