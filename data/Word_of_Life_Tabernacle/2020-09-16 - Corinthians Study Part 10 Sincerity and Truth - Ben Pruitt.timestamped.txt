[27:51] amen amen do you love him
[27:54] tonight amen
[27:58] turn with me if you would to first
[28:00] corinthians chapter 5.
[28:05] thank you for the music this evening we
[28:07] appreciate amanda being here and being
[28:08] able to play for us tonight and
[28:10] it was wonderful and
[28:14] a very gifted family if she hadn't done
[28:17] that
[28:17] allison might have had to play so
[28:22] first corinthians chapter 5 and verse 8
[28:26] says therefore let us keep
[28:29] the feast not with old leaven
[28:33] neither with the leaven of malice and
[28:35] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[28:38] of sincerity
[28:39] and truth and that's what we want
[28:41] tonight we want sincerity
[28:43] and not just sincerity but truth
[28:46] that's what we need amen pray lord
[28:49] without his blessing to the word you may
[28:50] be seated this evening
[28:56] we believe and accept that the bible is
[28:58] the basis for all of our conduct
[29:02] and for those of you that are watching
[29:03] tonight is probably more watching than
[29:05] what was able to come tonight but
[29:08] just try to stay glued in because i
[29:10] believe these things are important and i
[29:12] wish that there was someone
[29:14] better able to communicate it to you but
[29:16] but i'm the man that has the job and
[29:19] so we'll try to do that tonight but the
[29:21] bible is
[29:23] our foundation this is what we base
[29:27] all of our doctrine on and all of our
[29:30] conduct on
[29:31] is the bible that's what it comes from
[29:34] and you know a lot of people will say
[29:35] that
[29:36] but we believe that and we reinforced
[29:39] that
[29:40] from uh the message of the hour because
[29:42] we believe that our prophet
[29:43] was a scriptural prophet if not we have
[29:46] no business listening to him
[29:48] but he was a scriptural prophet he was
[29:50] foretold in the scripture and his
[29:52] ministry
[29:53] fit exactly what the scripture said it
[29:55] would be and then he stayed with the
[29:57] word when he came
[29:59] and and this is what he said about it he
[30:00] said so the bible is perfectly
[30:03] true and he said that's what we stand on
[30:06] the bible
[30:08] it must be thus saith the lord he said
[30:10] that we do believe that god can do
[30:12] things it's not written in his word
[30:13] because he's god
[30:15] he does whatever he wishes but yet i
[30:17] like to see anything when it comes to
[30:18] the line of a doctrine come out of the
[30:20] bible
[30:20] because i believe that the bible is the
[30:22] full revelation of jesus christ
[30:25] the bible said that's what it is it is
[30:27] the revelation of jesus christ and
[30:29] nothing is to be added to it
[30:31] or anything taken from it he said so i
[30:33] like to stay right in what it says and
[30:35] what it promises if he just do what he
[30:37] promised
[30:38] that's all i care to see anyhow he said
[30:41] then i know i'll see him so we do not
[30:44] base teaching
[30:45] order or discipline on tradition or on
[30:48] contemporary thinking
[30:50] because the thoughts change on how
[30:53] people deal with things but we we base
[30:56] it on the word of god
[30:58] and the book of corinthians is
[31:01] interesting and i chose the book of
[31:02] corinthians
[31:04] because i felt led to do that but a lot
[31:06] of people wouldn't because corinthians
[31:08] is a book of correction
[31:10] and we like ephesians because that's
[31:12] what we aspire to be
[31:14] corinthians is what we don't want to be
[31:15] as a church yet they were a christian
[31:17] church
[31:18] but the thing about corinthians is that
[31:21] the corinthians were not
[31:23] sinners they were not ungodly in that
[31:25] sense though they
[31:27] had sin in their midst but they were not
[31:29] just
[31:30] worldly people they were christians and
[31:33] not only were they christians they were
[31:34] going to go to heaven
[31:37] they were a true church not a false
[31:40] church
[31:41] they just had problems and corinthians
[31:45] really is the book
[31:46] of grace if you look at it like that
[31:48] because correction brings grace
[31:50] and opportunity for grace and and it
[31:53] means that it's not
[31:54] negative but it's it's a positive thing
[31:57] that god
[31:58] always does what he says he will do and
[32:02] the correction worked and when
[32:05] correction
[32:05] works it's god's way of providing grace
[32:08] to us
[32:10] god's way always does work and
[32:14] but the bill where we get in trouble is
[32:15] when we don't follow his way
[32:17] but god's way always works we don't
[32:20] follow the instructions and
[32:22] you know whenever i get this furniture
[32:24] from walmart and put it together
[32:26] i have a really hard time remembering to
[32:28] follow the instructions
[32:30] and you get it and you think oh this is
[32:32] going to be easy and you start to put it
[32:34] together and you've got pieces missing
[32:35] and you realize
[32:36] that you've got it inside out and upside
[32:38] down you should have followed
[32:39] instructions and
[32:41] and so if you had followed instructions
[32:43] you'd had a much easier time
[32:45] and the truth is the end result will be
[32:47] the same because god will correct us
[32:50] but if we'd follow the instructions we'd
[32:52] be better off
[32:54] i have a lot easier time in life
[32:58] um first corinthians 5 and 1 let's go
[33:00] there
[33:02] and look at some of these things and i'm
[33:04] just going to take an in-depth look at
[33:06] at this chapter and and then i may never
[33:10] visit visit this again but i just want
[33:12] to take a look at it tonight while we're
[33:14] going through this it's an opportunity
[33:16] for us to see how god works in
[33:19] first corinthians 5 and 1 it says it is
[33:21] reported commonly that there is
[33:22] fornication among you
[33:24] and such fornication as is not so much
[33:26] as named among the gentiles
[33:28] that one should have his father's wife
[33:31] now he said it's commonly known this
[33:32] particular sin was widely known both to
[33:34] the church and to the community
[33:37] so this was not hidden sin this was
[33:39] something that was known and yet
[33:40] the man continued to do it even though
[33:44] everybody knew it he wasn't ashamed of
[33:46] it he thought it was right he thought
[33:48] was okay
[33:49] because grace you know covered him but
[33:52] it's not okay
[33:54] and so fornication is uh
[33:57] is a broad term it's the greek word
[33:59] porneia which is
[34:00] covers adultery incest fornication
[34:03] but it also covers idolatry and which is
[34:06] interesting because the two things are
[34:07] always
[34:08] always tied together brother branham
[34:11] calls it unclean living
[34:13] that's a pretty good way to put it
[34:15] unclean living
[34:16] and so he says this particular sin that
[34:19] this man did that he would have his
[34:21] father's wife he said it's not even
[34:23] named among the gentiles
[34:24] this is so horrible that even the
[34:25] gentiles who will do anything
[34:28] won't do this and it actually existed
[34:32] among the gentiles
[34:33] in their they wrote about it but they
[34:35] condemned it even the romans
[34:37] cicero uh had called it an incredible
[34:41] and unheard of wickedness it was heard
[34:42] of it was practiced but
[34:44] they reprobated people who did that and
[34:47] and here was
[34:48] a christian man in a christian church
[34:49] saying it was okay
[34:51] and the world even knew it was wrong
[34:53] it's wrong and some things are just
[34:55] obviously wrong and
[34:58] and those things should not be mentioned
[35:00] among us since it comes
[35:02] of saints they're obviously wrong we
[35:04] shouldn't have to reason
[35:06] we get in trouble when we reason because
[35:08] you can reason your way out of anything
[35:09] but there's some things you shouldn't
[35:10] even have to reason about
[35:12] it's not okay to have another man's wife
[35:14] it's not okay to commit fornication it's
[35:16] not okay to commit adultery
[35:18] those things are still true and so verse
[35:21] two says you're puffed up
[35:23] and have not rather mourned that he that
[35:25] had done this deed might be taken away
[35:27] from you and
[35:28] so apologize their failure to deal with
[35:30] sin to their party spirits you go look
[35:32] up the words puffed up in corinthians
[35:34] he's talking
[35:35] they have this spirit of arrogance
[35:38] because they follow
[35:39] certain teachers and because of that
[35:41] they feel like they can get by with
[35:42] anything
[35:44] god help us never to be like that
[35:47] just because you listen to me preach or
[35:48] anybody else you probably wouldn't get
[35:50] that with me but
[35:51] but if you listen to somebody preach and
[35:52] say well i follow him that's my pastor
[35:55] that's
[35:55] that's the person that i follow so i'm
[35:57] okay it creates a tribal spirit
[36:01] where you get certain groups and
[36:03] anything goes as long as you're in the
[36:04] group
[36:06] but everybody else's group we condemn
[36:08] them
[36:09] and the truth is we have to look at it
[36:11] equally it doesn't matter what group
[36:12] you're in what denomination you're in
[36:13] whether you're in the message or not
[36:15] sin is still sin ungodliness is still
[36:18] ungodliness so
[36:20] uh paul ties this to their party spirit
[36:23] that you're
[36:24] puffed up they're they're we see that
[36:26] today i'm in natural politics
[36:28] everybody's
[36:29] tied to their party right immensely tied
[36:33] to their party
[36:34] and and to the point where it doesn't
[36:36] matter what what he does it that's
[36:38] that's my man that's my party
[36:40] that's the way they were and so paul
[36:42] says you're puffed up and you've not
[36:43] mourned
[36:44] but you actually exalt this hey we got
[36:46] sin in the church and we don't do
[36:48] nothing about it
[36:49] we're exalted we're we have grace
[36:53] that's the modern church today
[36:56] that's the whole modern church today
[36:59] and so paul says
[37:02] your full strife and contention this is
[37:04] adam clark the way he put it in his
[37:06] commentary i liked it he said you're
[37:08] full of strife and contention relative
[37:10] to your parties and favorite teachers
[37:12] and neglect the discipline of the church
[37:14] had you considered the greatness of this
[37:16] crime you would have rather mourned and
[37:17] put away this flagrant transgressor from
[37:19] among you
[37:21] and now and we'll get into that and
[37:24] how that that worked and why it's rarely
[37:26] done but in first corinthians 5 and 3
[37:29] it says privately as absent in body but
[37:32] present and spirit have judged already
[37:34] so i were present concerning him that
[37:36] has so done this deed
[37:37] and i don't know paul could have had a
[37:39] vision that
[37:41] of what it was and knew all the details
[37:43] from that but i think paul just
[37:45] is kind of shaming them in a way he's
[37:46] prodding them into action he says i'm
[37:48] not even there and i've already judged
[37:51] this is wrong and
[37:54] he's not trying to hide it it is what it
[37:56] is and so this is wrong
[37:58] and so in in verse 4 he says in the name
[38:01] of our lord jesus christ when you're
[38:02] gathered together and this is important
[38:05] when you are gathered together in my
[38:07] spirit with the power of our lord jesus
[38:10] christ
[38:11] when you are gathered together now you
[38:14] can't do this virtually
[38:17] it's impossible to follow the commands
[38:19] of scripture in corinthians 5
[38:22] if you never assemble yourself with
[38:24] other believers just like it's
[38:25] impossible
[38:27] to do foot washing and communion
[38:30] completely impossible
[38:32] you cannot say that you follow all of
[38:34] the word now
[38:35] excuse me for being harsh but it's just
[38:38] the truth you cannot say
[38:39] i follow all of the word and never
[38:41] assemble with believers
[38:44] it can't be done right because
[38:48] it requires assembly when you're
[38:50] gathered together
[38:51] do this you can't do it unless you're
[38:53] gathered together
[38:54] and my spirit he said with the power of
[38:56] our lord jesus christ so he says i'm
[38:57] with you in spirit
[38:59] i've already judged this and when you're
[39:01] gathered together you have the power of
[39:03] our lord jesus christ and paul
[39:06] takes that and if you follow along in
[39:07] your bible you can keep your place and
[39:09] then go to matthew chapter 18
[39:11] and you'll find where paul is grind
[39:14] grounded his teachings
[39:15] in that's terrible english but he he
[39:18] he ground his teachings in the teachings
[39:21] of jesus christ which was rooted in the
[39:23] law of moses
[39:25] and so we find this in matthew chapter
[39:27] 18 and verse 15. and i know you probably
[39:29] know this but i want to
[39:30] build this up to where we can get
[39:32] through this chapter
[39:34] and matthew jesus here deals with
[39:37] how you deal with a brother who has had
[39:41] a trespass against you and so it's more
[39:44] than just someone caught in sin but also
[39:46] someone who's done you wrong or someone
[39:50] you you might hold a grudge against you
[39:51] say well i'll just tell everybody that's
[39:53] not what you're supposed to do
[39:56] he says if thy brother shall trespass
[39:58] against he go and tell him his fault
[40:00] between thee and him alone
[40:04] all right so there's the first step
[40:05] between thee and him alone
[40:07] if he shall hear thee thou hast gained
[40:08] thy brother and guess what nobody else
[40:10] found out
[40:13] right and that's the ideal that's where
[40:16] we want it to be
[40:17] most of the time because we're going to
[40:18] have problems and there's going to be
[40:21] situations but instead of going talking
[40:23] to somebody else about it talk to that
[40:24] person
[40:26] and i know excuse me but i've known
[40:28] preachers who held grudges against other
[40:30] preachers
[40:31] for years for decades and never talked
[40:33] to the man
[40:35] and vice versa and you think how how can
[40:37] you hold this in your heart and never
[40:40] even communicate with the person
[40:42] and see if you can gain a brother
[40:45] right now he says but if he will not
[40:47] hear thee then take with thee one or two
[40:49] more
[40:50] that in the mouth of two or three
[40:51] witnesses every word may be established
[40:53] you take that from moses law verse 17
[40:56] and if he shall neglect to hear them
[40:59] if he should neglect to hear the two or
[41:00] three tell it unto the church
[41:02] but if you neglect to hear the church
[41:04] let him be into thee as a heathen man
[41:05] and a publican
[41:07] verse 18 verily i say unto you
[41:09] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[41:10] be bound in heaven
[41:12] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[41:14] loosed in heaven
[41:15] this is not a negative thing but he says
[41:18] you have the power to
[41:20] agree that something will happen and it
[41:21] will
[41:24] oh what a great thing that would be
[41:25] tonight if we could agree
[41:29] we could come together and agree that
[41:32] that certain things will happen because
[41:33] he says in verse 19 again i say unto you
[41:35] that of two of you
[41:37] so he said how many people does it take
[41:40] the jews i think had to have ten people
[41:42] to have a quorum or a majority
[41:44] to be able to have a meeting in the
[41:46] synagogue but jesus said if two
[41:48] of you agree on earth that's touching
[41:51] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[41:53] done for them
[41:54] my father which is in heaven where two
[41:58] or three
[41:59] we've got more than that tonight two or
[42:02] three maybe some of you have two or
[42:04] three sitting in the
[42:05] living room watching two or three are
[42:07] gathered together in my name
[42:10] there am i in the midst of them
[42:14] i'm in the midst of them so when paul
[42:16] says that
[42:17] it's here you're gathered together he
[42:20] said when you gather together and my
[42:21] spirit in the name of the lord jesus
[42:24] this is what you're supposed to do
[42:28] and you know in denominational churches
[42:30] church discipline mostly comes from
[42:32] headquarters
[42:33] and it makes it easy on everybody
[42:35] because you just wait for the verdict
[42:38] i had a friend a boss who was a catholic
[42:40] and and she was a good woman but
[42:42] you know they changed out the priest
[42:44] every so often and if the priest got in
[42:46] trouble they shipped him off somewhere
[42:47] else
[42:49] and then they put another priest in and
[42:52] so they just were waiting to hear what
[42:53] rome
[42:54] said what priests that rome would put
[42:56] there
[42:57] we don't do things that way it's not the
[42:58] new testament way
[43:00] because it's not the way the church was
[43:02] set up the church was set up where the
[43:04] local church had authority and brother
[43:05] branham
[43:06] talks about that in hebrews chapter five
[43:07] and six he said but i believe in the
[43:09] supreme authority of the local assembly
[43:11] he said yes let each church be its own
[43:14] choose its pastors its deacons whatever
[43:16] it is
[43:17] and that way the man in there he said
[43:18] has no bishop over him the holy spirit
[43:20] wants to speak something
[43:21] something to that church they don't have
[43:23] to ask anybody
[43:25] whether they could do this or do that
[43:26] it's the individual in contact with the
[43:28] holy spirit
[43:31] and brother branham says show me the by
[43:32] the bible what's greater in the bible
[43:34] than a local elder to a local church and
[43:35] that could be misunderstood because he
[43:37] says greater it makes you sound like
[43:38] the local elder is a great man that's
[43:40] not what he's saying he's saying there's
[43:42] no one above him in the depth chart it's
[43:44] him and christ
[43:46] there's not a bishop somewhere that's
[43:48] above the local elder in in
[43:50] in the hierarchy right so there's no one
[43:54] greater in that way not that the man's
[43:55] even a great man might be a simple man a
[43:57] poor man
[43:58] might barely be able to speak but
[44:00] there's no one above that local elder in
[44:02] hierarchy
[44:03] and so he said that's right yes sir the
[44:05] sovereignty of the local church each
[44:06] church in itself
[44:08] he said now brotherhood that's wonderful
[44:11] all churches ought to be in a
[44:12] brotherhood like that together
[44:15] i believe that he said but the
[44:17] sovereignty of the local church
[44:20] now so he says when you come together
[44:23] you gather yourselves together
[44:24] first corinthians 5 and 5 to deliver
[44:26] such a one unto satan for the
[44:28] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[44:30] may be saved
[44:31] in the day of the lord jesus now
[44:34] brother branham does not look at this
[44:37] like we sometimes do as a negative thing
[44:40] it sounds bad doesn't it sounds harsh
[44:44] delivers such a one to satan for the
[44:46] destruction of the flesh
[44:47] brother branham does not use it in a
[44:50] negative way
[44:51] most of the time and as i begin looking
[44:54] at this it really it really gives me
[44:56] some
[44:56] comfort because it proves
[45:00] that you're saved
[45:05] now we don't understand election like we
[45:07] should but it proves if you can be
[45:09] delivered to satan
[45:10] for the destruction of the flesh that
[45:12] the spirit may be saved it proves that
[45:14] you're saved
[45:18] now brother branham had a lady in 1957
[45:21] jehovah gyra a lady come up before him
[45:23] in the prayer line and he says
[45:25] the lady suffers with an extremely
[45:26] nervous condition
[45:28] he said and then she's wanting prayer
[45:29] for her eyes to
[45:31] because her eyes are getting dimmer and
[45:32] dimmer i didn't know sister cletus was
[45:34] going to put that request in tonight but
[45:36] but that's what was happening with this
[45:37] lady her eyes are getting dimmer and
[45:39] dimmer
[45:40] he said they're going out at the
[45:41] hardening of the nerve in the eye the
[45:42] optical nerve is dying
[45:44] which is shutting off the site he said
[45:45] but you're all upset about something and
[45:47] you're weary
[45:48] he said i see you shake your head or
[45:50] something in prayer he said you even
[45:52] wondered sometime
[45:53] if you're actually saved
[45:56] i don't make you raise your hand but i
[45:58] wonder how many of us have wondered that
[46:00] at some point
[46:02] sure of course you do because the devil
[46:04] wants to make you think that way
[46:07] you wonder sometimes if you're actually
[46:08] saved you'd have trouble with that
[46:11] he said that's true he said you've
[46:13] doubted your experience of being saved
[46:16] but i'll tell you now you are
[46:20] i love how confident he was of it i'll
[46:22] tell you now you are
[46:25] he said but this was caused by call he
[46:28] said some kind of a shock that you've
[46:30] had some news or something
[46:31] that shocked you all at once and caused
[46:33] this he said i think it was the death of
[46:35] your husband last fall
[46:36] he said god bless your heart lady and he
[46:39] says something interesting he said let's
[46:40] move the sadness
[46:42] the problem is not that you're not saved
[46:44] you just need to move the sadness
[46:49] how many times the believers need to
[46:51] just move the sadness
[46:52] because you just can't stay that sadness
[46:54] the rest of your life
[46:56] right so this is a positive thing move
[46:59] the sadness and here he
[47:00] was where he ties it back and so he
[47:02] begins to pray for her
[47:04] and he said let's move the sadness
[47:07] everything will be all right merciful
[47:08] god as i stand before this dear woman
[47:10] knowing there's a sad spirit around her
[47:12] he said i ask for thy divine mercy and
[47:14] guidance
[47:15] laying my hands upon her i charge that
[47:17] sad spirit
[47:18] to leave the woman he said christ lives
[47:22] christ he said cannot cannot no more
[47:25] take a word back
[47:26] that he said than nothing because he's
[47:29] god
[47:30] and he knows everything before he says
[47:32] it he said i condemned the spirit that
[47:33] would harm this woman
[47:35] in jesus christ's name amen he said now
[47:38] i just want to ask you
[47:40] he said he's still talking to the woman
[47:42] he said wasn't it something about he
[47:44] said you were worried about backsliding
[47:46] or something like that something on that
[47:48] order
[47:49] he said well look let me tell about your
[47:51] experience
[47:53] amen i like this he said now look sister
[47:57] he said this may hurt a little bit in
[47:58] the audience the reason was because they
[47:59] were pentecostals they were
[48:01] armenians they didn't believe you could
[48:04] keep your salvation
[48:05] believe if you sin you lost it you had
[48:08] to go get it again
[48:10] but he said this is gonna he said now
[48:12] this may hurt a little bit in the
[48:13] audience now if you don't believe this
[48:15] he said i'm talking to the woman see god
[48:17] he said god don't run his business like
[48:19] that
[48:22] i'm so glad he don't god don't run his
[48:25] business like they don't save you to
[48:27] lose you
[48:30] so when he tells the corinthians turn
[48:31] him over to the devil so that his
[48:33] his flesh could be turned over the devil
[48:35] can be destroyed so his soul could be
[48:37] saved
[48:38] his spirit could be saved what is he
[48:39] saying he's saved
[48:43] right you can do with that what you want
[48:46] to and how how saved was he i don't know
[48:48] enough to go to heaven
[48:51] right
[48:55] and and see that's not legalism that's
[48:57] grace
[48:59] now he says now you know he said you
[49:02] were once saved you know that
[49:04] he said well if god saved you here
[49:07] knowing he was going to lose you down
[49:08] there
[49:09] he defeats his own purpose he said he
[49:12] can't lose you
[49:14] he said he might have to take you off
[49:16] the earth because of your sin
[49:18] like the man in the bible who was living
[49:20] with his own mother and they turned him
[49:21] over to the devil for the destruction of
[49:23] the flesh
[49:24] that the soul might be saved he said but
[49:27] he can't lose you
[49:29] you're hiss amen
[49:32] before the world begin he ordains you to
[49:34] eternal life
[49:36] and it's the devil trying to cheat you
[49:38] out of it
[49:39] listen what he says call him a liar
[49:44] i think we don't call the devil enough
[49:46] names
[49:48] call him a liar jesus christ jehovah
[49:52] jireh
[49:53] listen what he says jesus christ jehovah
[49:56] jireh
[49:56] has provided a place for you
[50:00] this is what he tells someone go get it
[50:03] amen he says live happy he provided a
[50:07] place for you go get it
[50:10] so you can't lose you so this was not a
[50:12] negative thing he says
[50:13] you you have to do sometimes what looks
[50:16] like a negative thing because
[50:18] you're following the word but in the end
[50:20] i'll make it turn out all right
[50:24] verse six your glorying is not good no
[50:27] you not that a little eleven leaveneth
[50:28] the whole lump so
[50:30] that one member affects the whole body
[50:33] and he says that when one member brother
[50:36] branham talks about this in a total
[50:37] deliverance he said when one member
[50:38] would talk against the other member
[50:41] and this is that next quote when one
[50:44] member would talk against the other
[50:45] member you know that's wrong i'm trying
[50:47] to give esther a little more time it's
[50:48] her first night back there
[50:50] he said you know that that's wrong he
[50:53] said you are commanded to pray for one
[50:55] another
[50:56] not to talk against one another but to
[50:58] love one another
[51:01] does your brother have a fault go to him
[51:03] first
[51:05] between him and you alone and then
[51:08] then take it before the church if if it
[51:10] just can't be reconciled but
[51:12] someone is down let's pick him up help
[51:14] him
[51:16] he said now that makes us a unified
[51:18] group of believers
[51:20] he said now when we don't obey that then
[51:22] we don't obey god and we displease
[51:25] god he said and therefore our church our
[51:27] people cannot prosper
[51:28] the church cannot go on and he makes an
[51:32] interesting statement he says because we
[51:33] are disunified together
[51:36] and that's kentucky english right there
[51:39] disunified together jesus said a little
[51:42] leaven leavens the whole lump and
[51:44] but it makes perfect sense if you think
[51:46] about it you're together but you're not
[51:48] in unity
[51:49] so you're disunified together
[51:52] and whatever the church does the church
[51:54] has to do
[51:56] it may sound like a strange statement
[51:58] but whatever the church does
[52:00] the church has to do not some other
[52:03] church
[52:04] but the church the local church first
[52:07] corinthians 5 and 7 says purge out
[52:08] therefore the old leaven
[52:10] that you may be a new lump as you're
[52:12] unleavened for even christ our passover
[52:13] is sacrificed for us
[52:16] therefore he said let us keep the feasts
[52:17] not with old leaven neither with the
[52:19] leaven of malice
[52:21] and go to the next the next slide verse
[52:23] eight
[52:24] now i'm getting too fast he said
[52:26] therefore let us keep the feasts not
[52:28] with old leaven neither with the leaven
[52:29] of malice and wickedness but with the
[52:30] unleavened bread
[52:32] of sincerity and truth now he's alluding
[52:34] to the passover
[52:36] and and i like the way he puts it
[52:37] because he says not with the old leaven
[52:39] not with the leaven of malice and
[52:40] wickedness malice is
[52:42] the thought of sin wickedness is the act
[52:44] of sin he said but with the unleavened
[52:47] bread with sincerity and truth that word
[52:49] sincerity is literally
[52:50] something examined by the light of the
[52:52] sun and it's found to be pure
[52:56] and unadulterated sincere
[53:00] you know you can tell what color your
[53:01] tie is if you go outside
[53:03] a lot of times in the light like this
[53:05] you can't really tell what color it is
[53:08] but if you go outside you'll find out it
[53:09] don't match
[53:12] we need to get in the light of the sun
[53:14] and find out whether we match the word
[53:16] or not
[53:18] so he said let's go with the unleavened
[53:20] bread of sincerity and truth
[53:22] something that can be examined and found
[53:24] to be true
[53:25] and we don't have to hide anything verse
[53:29] 9
[53:29] paul explains himself he said i wrote
[53:31] unto you in an epistle not to company
[53:33] with fornicators
[53:34] this was a previous letter lost to time
[53:37] now
[53:38] and you can follow me on this but this
[53:41] is just the truth
[53:42] you know sometimes we don't like to hear
[53:44] things but it's just the truth
[53:46] and it's got to be said but not every
[53:48] word that the apostles and prophets
[53:49] wrote is scripture
[53:52] it's just the truth and it was not meant
[53:54] to be preserved as scripture
[53:57] the word of god was preserved so a fool
[53:59] would not err therein
[54:00] and so i believe in the continuity of
[54:02] the scriptures that we have what we need
[54:03] but we don't have every word that paul
[54:05] wrote
[54:07] but we have what scripture right
[54:11] and if you don't believe that then it's
[54:12] really hard to have any confidence in
[54:14] what you're reading
[54:16] right because you're never going to know
[54:17] whether it's true or not but the word of
[54:19] god was preserved and the bible said so
[54:21] a fool would not err therein
[54:23] so that's that i feel pretty good about
[54:25] that
[54:26] so he said i did write to you before and
[54:28] i told you not to company with
[54:29] fornicators but
[54:31] he said yeah all together verse 10 with
[54:34] the fornicators of this world or with
[54:35] the covetous or extortioners or with
[54:37] idolaters
[54:38] he said for then must you need to go out
[54:40] of the world
[54:42] because he said there's fornicators
[54:43] covetous extortioners idolaters all
[54:45] around you
[54:49] he said but now i have written unto you
[54:51] not to keep company
[54:53] if any man that is called a brother be a
[54:55] fornicator or covetous or an idolater a
[54:57] or a drunkard or an extortioner
[54:59] which such a one know not to eat
[55:03] because not only does he know better but
[55:04] he persists
[55:06] he's not talking about someone who's
[55:08] repented talking about somebody who
[55:10] won't repent
[55:12] now to keep company
[55:15] is to mix socially to have fellowship
[55:18] with
[55:19] he said don't do it not with a brother
[55:21] you'll have to do it with the world
[55:23] but don't do it with the brother who
[55:26] refuses
[55:27] to obey the word now verse 12 he said
[55:30] for what i've
[55:30] what have i to do to judge them also
[55:32] that are without do not you judge them
[55:34] that are within so he says the church is
[55:36] your jurisdiction
[55:38] you've probably heard that word
[55:38] jurisdiction if you've ever
[55:41] police they have a certain jurisdiction
[55:43] a court has a certain jurisdiction
[55:45] if it's out of your jurisdiction there's
[55:46] nothing you can do
[55:49] right and the church the local church is
[55:51] our jurisdiction
[55:53] this is what we're responsible for we
[55:56] can help others
[55:58] but this is what we're responsible for
[56:01] we don't have to judge anything that
[56:02] goes on outside
[56:04] i don't have to spend any of my time
[56:07] railing against other preachers and what
[56:09] they do wrong
[56:11] right i might say something sometime but
[56:15] i don't have to do that
[56:17] i may have an opinion but that's
[56:18] somebody else's jurisdiction
[56:21] because as a pastor i am not responsible
[56:23] for one person that doesn't come here
[56:25] and pay tithes and pay their offerings
[56:27] and come to the house of god
[56:29] i'm not responsible for anybody else
[56:32] right and so what they do is up to them
[56:34] that's between them and god
[56:36] every man will answer to his own master
[56:38] the scripture says
[56:40] but so them that are without god judges
[56:42] and that takes a great
[56:44] off of me a load off of me because i
[56:45] don't have to answer for that
[56:48] we just have to answer for our local
[56:49] church now
[56:51] he says but them that are without god
[56:53] judgeth therefore put away from among
[56:54] yourselves
[56:56] that wicked person let's look at this
[57:01] and i won't hold you too long tonight
[57:02] and we're going we're doing pretty good
[57:03] so far so we'll get through this tonight
[57:05] i think
[57:07] i thought maybe we'd have to break it
[57:08] off and continue but i think we'll get
[57:09] through it
[57:10] that's good because you don't want to
[57:11] hear it again but
[57:14] when are we required as a local church
[57:17] to follow first corinthians five
[57:21] number one when the sin is commonly
[57:22] reported verse one
[57:25] so everybody knows about it if you don't
[57:27] know you you're not required to do
[57:28] anything about it
[57:30] right there's probably people come and
[57:31] sit among us that we don't know
[57:34] i'm not saying there is but there could
[57:35] be right
[57:37] and there could be situations you don't
[57:38] know about you're not responsible for
[57:40] don't
[57:40] let someone make you feel guilty for
[57:41] something you don't know about
[57:44] you're not responsible for that just
[57:46] responsible for what you do know
[57:47] then if you want to pray and ask god god
[57:49] give me more wisdom give me more insight
[57:51] give me more
[57:52] help me to be more cautious and more
[57:54] careful and things like that but but if
[57:56] you don't know you can't deal with it
[57:59] right and the second thing is when the
[58:00] person in question is a brother or
[58:02] sister
[58:02] and what this leads me to believe is
[58:04] that a person that would be dealt with
[58:05] in this way would have to be coming to
[58:07] church
[58:09] right if they leave in their own
[58:10] volition they don't claim to be
[58:12] a part anymore there's nothing we can do
[58:15] nothing we should do
[58:17] right because that that person is taking
[58:20] themselves out from under the protection
[58:21] of the church
[58:23] right so this would be and that's why it
[58:24] doesn't get used very much and it
[58:26] shouldn't be used very much
[58:28] most pastors have to do this once or
[58:30] twice in a lifetime
[58:32] if at all because it's not something
[58:35] that
[58:36] you do lightly right
[58:39] but if it's used it should be used and
[58:41] it'll be effective because it's the word
[58:42] of god
[58:44] right and that's the thing whatever the
[58:47] word says
[58:47] we want to do that we want to follow
[58:49] that and we want to make sure we stay
[58:51] right with the word
[58:52] regardless of who the person would be if
[58:55] it would be me
[58:55] you have a responsibility if it's a
[58:58] deacon you have a responsibility if it's
[59:00] a trustee
[59:01] you have a responsibility the church has
[59:03] a responsibility to police
[59:05] itself when
[59:09] the third thing is when the person has
[59:10] had a space to repent and reform but
[59:12] refuses if the person is repenting
[59:15] and you say well you should kick that
[59:16] person out of the church now as a pastor
[59:19] i can ask someone not to come
[59:21] but i can't kick them out of the church
[59:23] of god
[59:25] you know i can't take i can't do that i
[59:28] could i could say it's not a good idea
[59:29] for you to come here
[59:30] but if a person is repenting we have to
[59:32] take that at face value
[59:35] you understand that there's nothing that
[59:36] i can do if a person is repenting
[59:39] but then you watch a person's life and
[59:41] see whether it's real
[59:43] the proof is in the pudding it it comes
[59:46] out eventually
[59:47] but there's times you'll have to take
[59:49] someone at their word
[59:51] and that you should and we should
[59:54] because in reality all we have is our
[59:57] faith
[59:58] right and all we have is our trust in
[1:00:00] one another and that that's what we say
[1:00:02] you know i you believe i'm a christian
[1:00:04] you believe i'm a man of god you believe
[1:00:05] that i'm a
[1:00:06] i'm a god called man all right you take
[1:00:08] my word for that
[1:00:10] and you should but if it's proved
[1:00:13] otherwise
[1:00:14] then you have to move on right and
[1:00:17] so now but what is the required process
[1:00:19] to do this only the local church can do
[1:00:21] it
[1:00:22] nobody else can deal with our problems
[1:00:26] right only the local church can do it
[1:00:28] and that's in you look in verse four and
[1:00:30] it shows you that
[1:00:31] paul himself could not do it he said
[1:00:33] when you were assembled together
[1:00:36] you couldn't just do it by letter right
[1:00:38] when you're assembled together
[1:00:40] then deal with it so it can only be done
[1:00:43] as a last resort after you've gone
[1:00:45] through the matthew 18 the
[1:00:47] the steps you've gone to him yourself
[1:00:49] you've done everything that you can
[1:00:50] to to make sure it doesn't get out
[1:00:54] you know if you if you blow it at first
[1:00:56] then you can't do it
[1:00:57] it's got to come through the through the
[1:00:59] procedure it's got to be done right
[1:01:01] and then only as a body and and what
[1:01:04] this means is that a pastor just by
[1:01:06] himself couldn't do it
[1:01:07] because it wouldn't be effective a
[1:01:10] church would have to do it
[1:01:12] as i said usually a person takes
[1:01:14] themselves out from under the protection
[1:01:15] of the church they just leave and then
[1:01:17] and then we pray for those people and we
[1:01:20] ask god to get a hold of their heart
[1:01:21] because we
[1:01:22] we feel that when someone leaves it
[1:01:25] shouldn't be just something that oil
[1:01:26] they left you know but someone leaves
[1:01:28] especially if they go into sin they want
[1:01:30] to go to some other church that's that's
[1:01:31] up to them
[1:01:32] but if they leave and they go and fall
[1:01:33] into sin we should do everything we can
[1:01:35] to reach that person
[1:01:37] at the same time not becoming a partaker
[1:01:39] of their sin
[1:01:42] now brother branham talked about this in
[1:01:44] practice and we'll look at this real
[1:01:46] quick before we
[1:01:47] before we go and after a little bit and
[1:01:49] and brother branham says here not long
[1:01:51] ago a good preacher friend of mine
[1:01:53] he said had a boy and that boy had been
[1:01:55] going to church his own church
[1:01:57] he said he got to a place where he
[1:01:58] started running around with a little old
[1:02:00] girl who smoked and drank and carried on
[1:02:02] and the preacher said of course that's
[1:02:04] his business right
[1:02:06] we we can't tell him what to do but now
[1:02:09] he's part of the church
[1:02:11] and he said a very bosom friend of mine
[1:02:13] and a nice boy but he got all infatuated
[1:02:15] with some young woman and
[1:02:16] she had been married had some children
[1:02:18] her husband was living he was afraid
[1:02:20] that they were going to have that boy
[1:02:21] would marry her
[1:02:23] he said so the brother was all tore up
[1:02:25] he's running with a girl
[1:02:27] that is not good for him and has already
[1:02:30] been married
[1:02:31] and that's against the word right and so
[1:02:35] he knew that and and the man being his
[1:02:37] father the pastor of the church was the
[1:02:38] boy's father
[1:02:40] he said the brother was all tore up and
[1:02:41] he said to me brother branham he said i
[1:02:43] want you to go to this certain certain
[1:02:44] boy mine i want you to talk to him
[1:02:47] i'd want brother branham to talk to my
[1:02:48] boy
[1:02:50] you know what brother branham said he
[1:02:52] said
[1:02:53] brother he said i almost called his name
[1:02:55] he said you have a better way
[1:02:57] he said don't send me if the boy is not
[1:03:01] living up and the church has saw him
[1:03:03] doing wrong then it's the thing for the
[1:03:04] church to do this business
[1:03:07] that's left with the church and the
[1:03:09] church goes over and tells him
[1:03:12] brother branham picks up this story in
[1:03:13] 1958 and actually gives us the name of
[1:03:15] the pastor
[1:03:17] and why are we not a denomination he
[1:03:19] says he went and got one of the deacons
[1:03:21] and went down to his house and the boy's
[1:03:22] name was wesley he said wesley i want to
[1:03:24] talk to you
[1:03:25] i said are you going to straighten this
[1:03:26] thing up with the church and he gave him
[1:03:28] a short two answer like that and
[1:03:30] he said remember wesley i'm the pastor
[1:03:31] of that church i'm your daddy
[1:03:33] i'm going to do what god says to i've
[1:03:36] thought about this
[1:03:37] what would that be like if it's your kid
[1:03:39] that's hard
[1:03:42] but he said i've got to do what god said
[1:03:44] do and he says
[1:03:46] he says i'm the pastor remember wesley
[1:03:48] he said i'm the pastor of that church
[1:03:49] i'm your daddy but i'm going to do what
[1:03:50] god says do he says i'm giving you
[1:03:52] that's the next next quote he said i'm
[1:03:54] giving you 30 days to make that right
[1:03:56] with that church
[1:03:57] or we'll excommunicate you from the
[1:03:58] presence of god and remember he's taking
[1:04:01] brother branham's advice
[1:04:03] he said you're my own son that's my
[1:04:04] savior said i love you he said you know
[1:04:07] i love you wesley i die right now for
[1:04:08] you
[1:04:09] but you got to come straight with god's
[1:04:10] word he said see he said i'm the pastor
[1:04:13] i'm the shepherd of
[1:04:14] that flock if you're my child or whoever
[1:04:16] you are you got to line up with god's
[1:04:17] word
[1:04:18] if you don't do it then i'm not fit to
[1:04:20] be a shepherd
[1:04:21] he said boy that's a pastor he said
[1:04:24] that's a man don't you think so
[1:04:27] i don't know if i could do that
[1:04:30] i don't know i've never had to do it you
[1:04:33] say well i know i could okay
[1:04:39] you go right ahead i don't know unless
[1:04:40] you had to do it how do you know
[1:04:43] somebody says you've lost a loved one
[1:04:44] sometimes i know just what you're going
[1:04:46] through not unless you've been through
[1:04:47] that
[1:04:50] you don't know and i don't know and so
[1:04:54] i don't know what i would do but this
[1:04:56] man was a real man and he'd think like
[1:04:58] buddy robinson prayed he said lord give
[1:04:59] me a backbone like a sawlock
[1:05:03] that's that's what we need because
[1:05:06] in order to do them right so many times
[1:05:08] i see this especially with with mothers
[1:05:10] with their children but so many times a
[1:05:12] mother's made a certain way
[1:05:14] and a mother will reach out and keep
[1:05:15] reaching out and sometimes it becomes an
[1:05:17] enabling factor
[1:05:18] and how many times have you seen a
[1:05:20] mother enable their children to
[1:05:22] do drugs and alcohol and all these
[1:05:24] things when they'd be better off
[1:05:26] if they were cut off but that's hard to
[1:05:29] do it's easier said than done
[1:05:33] but now he says uh if you don't
[1:05:36] he said boy that's a pastor that's a man
[1:05:38] don't you think so that's the man he
[1:05:39] told this boy that and heard him he said
[1:05:40] but
[1:05:41] but said what who are you gonna hurt the
[1:05:42] man or hurt your savior
[1:05:44] so he said then we went on and said he
[1:05:46] wouldn't do it and i told the church he
[1:05:47] said my own son wesley he refuses to
[1:05:50] hear me in this matter
[1:05:51] he refuses to hear the deacon and you're
[1:05:52] a witness of this brother so and so
[1:05:54] yes i am he said all right at eight
[1:05:56] o'clock next sunday four weeks from now
[1:05:59] he said if he hasn't made that right
[1:06:00] with this church we turn wesley my son
[1:06:02] over to the devil for the destruction of
[1:06:04] the flesh he said his blood the blood of
[1:06:06] jesus christ in
[1:06:07] this church protect him no longer he
[1:06:10] said that night come stood on the pulpit
[1:06:11] and said he's got two more minutes
[1:06:13] the time come he said now as my son
[1:06:15] wesley rasmussen said to this
[1:06:16] congregation
[1:06:17] he said to you almighty god we've done
[1:06:19] all we can do according to your words
[1:06:21] and instructions of your son our savior
[1:06:23] has left us
[1:06:24] he said we now i turn my boy in this
[1:06:26] church with me over to the devil for the
[1:06:28] destruction of his flesh
[1:06:29] that his soul would be saved he said
[1:06:31] that's all was said nothing went on
[1:06:33] he said for a week or two maybe a month
[1:06:34] or two
[1:06:36] he said one night old wesley took sick
[1:06:41] what is that that's god keeping his word
[1:06:45] so when he got sick he kept getting
[1:06:46] sicker he called the doctor the doctor
[1:06:49] come up and examined him he had a fever
[1:06:50] of 105 he couldn't find no reason for it
[1:06:52] just kept getting sicker
[1:06:53] the doctor said boy i don't know what's
[1:06:55] happened to you he didn't know what to
[1:06:56] do
[1:06:56] he said we'll call a specialist they
[1:06:58] called a specialist specialist come in
[1:07:00] here they took him over to the hospital
[1:07:01] examined him everything else and said
[1:07:03] i just can't tell you the boy just looks
[1:07:04] deathly his wife standing there crying
[1:07:07] everything like that and the children
[1:07:08] standing around the bed
[1:07:09] everywhere like that he said he's going
[1:07:11] that's all his pulse and respiration is
[1:07:13] just going down all the time
[1:07:15] he said call daddy he said oh yes that's
[1:07:18] the way to do it that's it call daddy
[1:07:20] now
[1:07:21] doing this doesn't mean that you won't
[1:07:22] answer a call when the person is ready
[1:07:24] to repent
[1:07:27] you have to answer that call right
[1:07:31] but but it'll you'll know if the person
[1:07:33] is really repentant they're ready
[1:07:35] they're ready i believe you'll know that
[1:07:37] and and so his daddy ran out to the
[1:07:38] hospital real quick to see him he said
[1:07:40] daddy i can't now he said but
[1:07:42] god hears my words he said i'll make
[1:07:44] everything right so he's laying on the
[1:07:45] hospital but he said but as soon as i
[1:07:47] can
[1:07:47] i'll make everything right i'll make it
[1:07:48] right yes i will yes sir brother right
[1:07:51] then his respiration began to come back
[1:07:52] to normal
[1:07:54] the following sunday he was up before
[1:07:55] the church he said i have sinned before
[1:07:57] god
[1:07:57] in the presence of this church he said i
[1:07:59] refuse to hear the pastor's words i
[1:08:01] refuse to hear the deacon
[1:08:02] he said i'm asking this church to
[1:08:03] forgive me for the evil that i've done
[1:08:05] like that he said god has spared my life
[1:08:07] i tell you he lined up right he said
[1:08:10] yeah he said that's what you got to do
[1:08:11] see
[1:08:12] he said see if you'll just do it god's
[1:08:14] way
[1:08:17] and good things will come from it but
[1:08:20] we've left this off and we want to come
[1:08:21] over here and just talk about it amongst
[1:08:23] themselves
[1:08:23] and a bunch of preachers decide what to
[1:08:25] do about it
[1:08:26] or a bunch of other people decide what
[1:08:28] to do that's not what he said brother
[1:08:29] branham even addresses that he said it's
[1:08:31] the nominational way
[1:08:32] he said for the board to get together
[1:08:34] and say we're going to deal with it
[1:08:35] that's not how it's dealt with
[1:08:38] we deal with it according to the
[1:08:39] scripture
[1:08:42] as much as we can
[1:08:46] brother branham it's interesting i
[1:08:48] couldn't find where he actually did this
[1:08:51] except one time and it's the time
[1:08:54] it's not sexual sin that caused him to
[1:08:56] do it it was when they made him god
[1:08:59] when they made brother branham god
[1:09:00] brother brown that sunday
[1:09:03] put him on notice and then the next
[1:09:05] sunday he told the church he said i put
[1:09:07] him on notice last week and he
[1:09:08] references this scripture
[1:09:09] turn them over to the devil that if they
[1:09:12] didn't repent and he said that week they
[1:09:13] come and repent
[1:09:15] you wonder how many of them repented
[1:09:18] but at least the ones that he had in his
[1:09:19] mind had repented and come to god but
[1:09:22] but he uses this scripture that's when
[1:09:25] he used it
[1:09:26] why because idolatry and fornication are
[1:09:28] tied together
[1:09:31] right and so it's the same it's the same
[1:09:34] spirit
[1:09:35] but now when you follow the word when i
[1:09:37] follow the word
[1:09:38] god will work on the individual we have
[1:09:41] to trust god to do that
[1:09:44] let god work sometimes it takes time
[1:09:49] for a year paul dealt with this
[1:09:51] corinthian church he
[1:09:53] he sent a letter and he sent timothy and
[1:09:56] then he sends titus
[1:09:59] and all this time this is going on we
[1:10:01] don't know
[1:10:03] paul doesn't tell us what happens
[1:10:04] exactly to the man other than that he
[1:10:06] repents
[1:10:08] we don't know how many hours he spent
[1:10:11] fighting it
[1:10:12] or how many days or whether he repented
[1:10:14] immediately we don't know
[1:10:17] we don't know how much of that year that
[1:10:19] it took for him to repent
[1:10:21] but we know by the next time paul wrote
[1:10:23] something had happened
[1:10:25] god kept his word
[1:10:29] and so in second corinthians 2 and 6
[1:10:33] i love the way paul writes this because
[1:10:36] there's a balance to everything so
[1:10:39] he wrote about what they should do and
[1:10:42] then in ii corinthians 2 6 he writes
[1:10:43] back and he says sufficient to such a
[1:10:45] man is this punishment
[1:10:46] which was inflicted of many and and what
[1:10:49] that means is if you go back and look at
[1:10:51] the original it
[1:10:52] not everybody did it but enough people
[1:10:53] did it to make it effective
[1:10:56] what that means is that they just cut
[1:10:57] him off enough people did it to make it
[1:11:00] effective
[1:11:02] but somehow they knew he had repented
[1:11:05] i'm so glad that
[1:11:07] god still has a way of bringing us to
[1:11:08] repentance may not be exactly this way
[1:11:10] but there's some way
[1:11:12] that god will bring us to repentance
[1:11:16] second corinthians 7 11 says for behold
[1:11:19] this self same thing that you sorrowed
[1:11:20] after a godly sort now
[1:11:22] paul is speaking to the entire church
[1:11:23] but i think it's applicable to the man
[1:11:25] in question as well
[1:11:26] he said when i sent you this letter
[1:11:28] before you sorrowed after a godly sort
[1:11:31] he said what carefulness it wrought and
[1:11:32] you yay what clearing of yourselves yay
[1:11:34] what indignation
[1:11:35] yeah what fear yeah what vehement desire
[1:11:38] yay what zeal yeah what revenge
[1:11:40] in all things you have approved
[1:11:42] yourselves to be clear in this matter
[1:11:45] huh they did good they did good why they
[1:11:49] were real christians
[1:11:52] just wrong-headed
[1:11:56] because they didn't do it as you know we
[1:11:59] we try to deal with things when it comes
[1:12:01] out but they didn't deal with it
[1:12:02] and a lot of people would write them all
[1:12:03] and say well they must not even be a
[1:12:04] real church
[1:12:06] no they didn't deal with it but when
[1:12:07] paul exposed them on it they did
[1:12:11] better late than never right there's
[1:12:14] attributes of godly sorrow look at the
[1:12:16] things paul talks about carefulness
[1:12:17] diligence to obey to the letter what
[1:12:19] paul had told them to do
[1:12:21] clearing which is self-vindication
[1:12:24] they were willing to prove that they
[1:12:26] were going to do
[1:12:27] what paul taught them to do and it also
[1:12:29] means full confession
[1:12:31] clearing what he said what what clearing
[1:12:33] of yourselves
[1:12:35] indignation is hatred of that sin
[1:12:38] you've known people probably who were
[1:12:40] smokers or alcoholics and they get to
[1:12:41] where they hate that
[1:12:44] because that's what they that's what
[1:12:45] they dealt with
[1:12:47] and so he said you have to have a hatred
[1:12:48] of that sin a fear
[1:12:50] a fear of repeating that sin or of it
[1:12:52] happening again as i've said never again
[1:12:55] there has to be a fear of that a
[1:12:58] vehement desire a desire to make things
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:02] a zeal to follow the word and revenge
[1:13:05] which is a bad word now and the old
[1:13:07] english word revenge didn't mean what it
[1:13:08] means today
[1:13:10] it meant justice justice to the offended
[1:13:14] parties
[1:13:14] they made sure everybody was made was
[1:13:17] made whole
[1:13:19] it's important you don't get just to
[1:13:22] mess with people's lives and then just
[1:13:24] just move on say well i'm sorry
[1:13:27] there has to be justice and god will see
[1:13:30] that it will be done in the right way
[1:13:31] now
[1:13:32] what that meant probably for this man
[1:13:34] was he had to
[1:13:35] give up his father his father's wife
[1:13:40] he couldn't do that anymore and he had
[1:13:42] to prove that he wasn't doing it anymore
[1:13:44] and when the people saw the depth of his
[1:13:46] sincerity paul said don't
[1:13:47] don't leave him don't hang him out there
[1:13:49] to dry
[1:13:51] and so in verse 7 of second corinthians
[1:13:53] 2 paul says so that contrary-wise you
[1:13:55] ought rather to forgive him
[1:13:57] and comfort him unless perhaps such a
[1:13:59] one would be swallowed up with over much
[1:14:01] sorrow
[1:14:03] see paul is dealing with people not
[1:14:05] robots
[1:14:07] we deal with people not robots that's
[1:14:09] why sometimes you get offended
[1:14:11] when i say something sometimes i get
[1:14:12] offended too you know
[1:14:15] you know a preacher has to be careful
[1:14:16] not to get offended by the way people
[1:14:18] look when he preaches
[1:14:20] but daryl told me he's preaching
[1:14:22] somewhere one time he knew the people
[1:14:23] wasn't going to agree with what he was
[1:14:24] going to say and
[1:14:25] he said that scripture just dropped in
[1:14:26] his heart don't be afraid of their faces
[1:14:31] it's hard you you have to you know you
[1:14:33] have to not be offended but
[1:14:36] but now we're dealing with people we're
[1:14:38] not dealing with a bunch of robots or
[1:14:40] machines we do have feelings
[1:14:43] but we come back to the word
[1:14:47] so verse 8 says wherefore i beseech you
[1:14:49] that you would confirm your love toward
[1:14:51] him
[1:14:52] let him know that you love him after
[1:14:54] repentance there's a time
[1:14:56] for this let him know now that you love
[1:14:58] him because you see
[1:14:59] what clearing what how the church has
[1:15:01] just made this right
[1:15:02] and he's made it right now go confirm
[1:15:04] your love toward him
[1:15:06] after repentance make sure he knows that
[1:15:08] you love him be sure that he shows
[1:15:09] fruits of repentance but when he does
[1:15:11] don't hold a grudge
[1:15:16] he said for this end also did i write
[1:15:19] that i might know the proof of you
[1:15:20] whether you be obedient in all things
[1:15:24] not just in getting rid of the sin but
[1:15:27] in bringing back the center
[1:15:31] but there's again there's a time for
[1:15:33] that don't don't push it because when
[1:15:35] you do
[1:15:36] what happens is you end up making
[1:15:37] twofold a child of hell because you
[1:15:39] proselyte somebody back into the church
[1:15:45] verse 10 to whom forgive to whom ye
[1:15:47] forgive anything i forgive also
[1:15:50] for if i forgave anything to whom i
[1:15:52] forgave it for your sakes forgave i had
[1:15:54] so he said i didn't do it for the sake
[1:15:55] of the man that
[1:15:56] i didn't just do it unilaterally for the
[1:15:58] sake he said but because the church
[1:16:00] forgave him i forgave him
[1:16:03] and i did that in the person of christ
[1:16:04] you're in the stead of christ
[1:16:06] in the place of christ that's the place
[1:16:08] we stand in today is the body of christ
[1:16:10] verse 11 he said lest satan should get
[1:16:13] an advantage of us
[1:16:15] for not we are not ignorant of his
[1:16:18] devices
[1:16:21] if you can't can't get you to be
[1:16:22] complicit with the sin he'll try to get
[1:16:24] you to hate somebody
[1:16:26] he'll try to get you to hold a grudge
[1:16:28] against somebody
[1:16:33] see if we do things god's way god will
[1:16:35] work on the sinner
[1:16:38] don't don't just hold it in your heart
[1:16:40] and say well i won't ever talk about it
[1:16:41] i won't ever will never go to the person
[1:16:43] about it you shouldn't talk about
[1:16:44] anybody else but go to the person
[1:16:47] until you've been to that person you
[1:16:48] don't have a right to talk about it to
[1:16:49] anybody else
[1:16:51] that's what the bible says now
[1:16:55] we need god's forgiveness don't we
[1:16:58] musicians go ahead and come
[1:17:01] the bible says if we don't forgive god
[1:17:03] won't forgive us
[1:17:06] and as individuals we do not wait
[1:17:10] god showed this to me one time and i've
[1:17:11] never forgotten it as individuals we do
[1:17:14] not
[1:17:14] wait for someone to repent to forgive
[1:17:17] them
[1:17:20] as individuals we don't wait i'm
[1:17:23] sticking my finger up there like perry
[1:17:24] green are reminding myself
[1:17:26] but he would do forgive me lord
[1:17:31] but as individuals we we have to forgive
[1:17:34] when you stand praying forgive no matter
[1:17:36] what the person does
[1:17:38] you forgive right as a church
[1:17:42] he says there's a time when you let them
[1:17:46] make sure they've filmed proof of
[1:17:47] repentance
[1:17:49] fruits of repentance before you forgive
[1:17:52] them as a church
[1:17:54] as a body does that make sense as an
[1:17:57] individual i have to forgive don't
[1:17:59] keep pulling the bell and letting the
[1:18:00] grudge sit there because as long as you
[1:18:02] let it sit there
[1:18:02] it's not going to damage the person it's
[1:18:04] going to damage you
[1:18:06] it's going to destroy you until that's
[1:18:08] you're consumed by it
[1:18:09] i've seen ministries destroyed by it
[1:18:11] i've seen people destroyed by
[1:18:12] it'll end up destroying your own
[1:18:14] testimony
[1:18:16] look at the grace of god that god shows
[1:18:18] us in this chapter isn't that wonderful
[1:18:20] here's a man who does so many bad things
[1:18:23] but god says
[1:18:24] i'm going to save him
[1:18:28] i'm going to save him that's grace
[1:18:32] let's bow our heads together you just
[1:18:34] play something softly
[1:18:37] heavenly father we love you tonight and
[1:18:40] we're so grateful for your grace
[1:18:46] lord there's a song i believe that says
[1:18:48] there's nothing greater than grace
[1:18:53] think of the way paul puts it in the
[1:18:54] visions he said with that
[1:18:56] great love wherewith he hath loved us
[1:19:01] so thankful for that love tonight lord
[1:19:06] so thankful that the times that i failed
[1:19:08] privately and publicly
[1:19:11] maybe not in a big way but just the
[1:19:12] little things
[1:19:14] you didn't just throw me away lord
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] but you maybe made things a little hard
[1:19:20] on me until i repented
[1:19:24] it's the way you do lord you have a way
[1:19:26] of correcting us you don't
[1:19:28] punish us because but you correct
[1:19:31] us it causes us to go through the
[1:19:34] judgment seat
[1:19:36] here so we don't have to go through it
[1:19:37] there lord i wouldn't want to stand on
[1:19:40] that day is
[1:19:41] your prophet told the story of the man
[1:19:43] of the evangelist who stood there
[1:19:46] and the great light that voice spoke and
[1:19:48] said have you ever told a lie
[1:19:50] i said i thought i'd been pretty
[1:19:52] truthful but as i stood there
[1:19:54] under that great light i realized i'd
[1:19:56] told a lie
[1:19:57] i thought that i'd been pretty honest
[1:20:00] that have you ever stolen but he said i
[1:20:01] realized i'd stolen god's time
[1:20:05] and i was about to he thought i was
[1:20:08] about to hear his voice
[1:20:09] saying go away into the
[1:20:13] into the depths go into hell and
[1:20:17] all of a sudden he said the sweetest
[1:20:19] voice that i ever heard
[1:20:22] father on earth he stood for me i'm
[1:20:25] standing for him
[1:20:27] lord we believe you've stood for us
[1:20:31] help us to take advantage of that grace
[1:20:32] lord help us lord we
[1:20:35] we wouldn't want to do anything to bring
[1:20:37] a reproach on your word
[1:20:41] lord but help us to take advantage of
[1:20:43] grace when it's offered
[1:20:44] god we look at this world that we live
[1:20:46] in today look at the signs of the time
[1:20:48] all around us
[1:20:49] and this church ought to be full of
[1:20:51] people
[1:20:53] lord speaking grace
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:56] we live in an hour when people are
[1:20:58] hardened
[1:21:00] lost touch with what it's like to know
[1:21:03] that they're a sinner
[1:21:05] lord may it never be so with us
[1:21:09] but may we have that assurance lord if
[1:21:12] the devil gets to beating us up and
[1:21:14] going in our minds and telling us you're
[1:21:16] not a christian you're not saved
[1:21:18] may we come back to the word and say
[1:21:20] lord i know that you saved me
[1:21:23] i know that you bought me and you didn't
[1:21:25] buy me to lose me
[1:21:26] i was yours before the foundation of the
[1:21:28] world it was in your mind and
[1:21:30] i believe lord you wouldn't have done
[1:21:31] this for me just to lose me
[1:21:35] may it be so in every one of our hearts
[1:21:37] give us confidence and assurance lord
[1:21:39] and
[1:21:40] also such a great sense of what you've
[1:21:43] done for us so we were sinners
