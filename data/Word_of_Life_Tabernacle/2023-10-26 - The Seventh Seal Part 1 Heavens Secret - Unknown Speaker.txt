bless them as well keep us Close to You Lord we pray in Jesus name amen amen I want to turn to Revelation chap 8 verse one tonight Revelation 8 and one we've been uh dealing with the Seven Seals Revelation chapter 6 and uh then we dealt with the uh God's plan for the Jews which is Revelation chapter 7 uh and then the seventh seal which is revelation CH 8 verse one and then it goes into the trumpets but uh we're just going to deal with the seventh seal and maybe uh stay here I'm not sure we may be here for a few weeks I think uh I think brother Seth coffee is going to going to be in uh next Wednesday night so we'll get a little bit of a break and I've been working uh pretty hard but I know you all do too so I don't want to uh want to sound like I you know I love to do it I love to preach and uh but sometimes I need some time to collect my thoughts so I think he's going to be in so it'll give me a week to where I can come back and be ready to preach now we're um we'll be here though we got that fall festival coming up on on Saturday so I'm sure you're looking forward to that and then one service is here on Sunday brother Gabe happy birthday seems like uh you're always running late on your birthday always things happening and it's good to have brother Gabe with us tonight and all of you that are here I know there's several that are sick and um tonight not able to come I talked to brother JT today and he's doing as well as could be expected with the procedure that he had but keep him in your prayers Revelation 8 And1 let's uh deal with the seventh seal we need open the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour well it don't give us much does it there's so much there pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this will probably be several parts so if you feel I'm leaving something out I probably am and uh I've tried not to go back and and and find what other men have taught uh as far as around the message on this I've tried to just stay right with the scripture and We Believe brother brandom taught about the seventh seal and uh so if you disagree with me tonight just spit that out and and uh keep on eating pie and we'll we'll agree on something I'll say this if you disagree with the message I know sometimes we try to witness to people and it seems like we're trying to push it on them that's not it at all we care about it because we believe it's true but if we uh if you disagree with that you just go live a Christian Life and do the very best that you can and get ready for the coming of the Lord because I think we can all agree we're in the end time and and and the Lord is coming how many believe that tonight and uh so we need to be ready for that in whatever way that we can and I believe we just try to live as close to the word as we can live I want to take this uh from the message of the hour I want to take a stand for what a prophet taught on these things and when there's so much confusion all around we don't want to misunderstand but we want to uh find out exactly what a prophet taught about these things now when you when you think about silence in heaven that's a big deal because since Elohim began creation there's never been silence in heaven heaven is Perpetual worship Perpetual worship I'll say this if you don't like Worship in church you aren't going to enjoy Heaven at all because heaven is Perpetual worship it's I it's constantly worship around the Throne of God and and and brother brandham talked about this breaking of the seal being so great that heaven was hushed by it that it was in silence for the space of a half hour it was Hush there wasn't a thing moved for a half hour now I tell you what now someone said that this is actually what this means is there won't be any women in heaven but I don't agree with that there was a half hour of Silence I don't agree with that at all actually Joel might be suspect if it was a half hour of literal silence but but it was something happened something so great that heaven was hushed for half an hour a and a half hour might not seem long if you're having a good time but in the suspense between death and life it seemed like a millennium the 4 and 20 Elders that stood before God that the Bible says were harping with their Harps they quit playing their Harps the Angels hushed they're singing if you go back to Isaiah chapter 6 you'll find that the cherubims flew around and they constantly flew and they they cried holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty constantly they cried that out and the the even the doors the posts of the temple moved when they cried and that stopped everything thing stopped at the opening of the seventh seal so all of Heaven There was deadly silence in heaven no Praises no Altra service for a half hour so all the host of Heaven Was silent for this when this seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open but it's broke the lamb breaks it he said you know what they were AED by it I believe they didn't know there it was they just stop what is it now none of us know he said but I'm going to tell you my revelation of it now this is something that would not be announced it would just happen and then we would see what it was so it's not something that would come out and and they'd say this is what's coming but it's something that would happen and then we would I will say this the part of it uh we're talking about the coming of the Lord tonight and and how we get ready for that now the part of it there's part of it we don't know what is that the part that we don't know today is the day and hour of his coming we don't know what day and if somebody tells you they do know they're wrong right because the Bible said no man knows the day or the hour only the Father in heaven and so we have to uh believe that tonight and so we don't know we just want to be ready but we do know that we see signs all around us and and we see that the times are here we believe that this is the end time time now this is something that again it would not be announced it would just happen and then we would see what it was are you with me so far tonight now we know and and we believe that it's the seventh angel messenger of Revelation 10:7 it's his job to finish the mystery of God Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished Heath declared to his servants the prophets so all that God wanted to do all of his Plan of Redemption everything uh that he had planned to do with the Jewish church with the Gentile Church all the mysteries of the Kingdom would be uh would be revealed or would be finished at that time and it had to be at the end time that that would happen we'll get to that after a while now we believe that that that was brother William Marian brandham that that was the man that God used he was the Earthly messenger that God sent at the end time to fulfill this scripture also Malachi 45 and6 and Luke 173 or 30 that his message would forerun the coming of Christ we know that this book contains the entire mystery of God how many believe that tonight everything that God uh wanted to be made known everything God wanted to God breathed the prophet spoke it by inspiration they wrote it down and this book is the inherent word of God this is the Bible if you can't tell what it is the Bible is the inherent uh completely accurate word of God yet many people have many different ideas about what the Bible is so we know that there's many different theories about the Bible and what the Bible is and what it does and and so the book is sealed in some sense that you could look in the Bible and people become all kinds of denomination they become all kind have all kinds of views all kinds of ideas but the Bible is still true right and and we learn many things about it by studying it but we know uh that many people even who study the book disagree about what it is so there's got to be something uh that comes to us that tells us what the truth is now what is that it's Revelation right it's God revealing To Us by the Holy Spirit who was his teacher and telling us these things that would come now uh there's no other book that we use other than the Bible to contain the mystery of God the mysteries of the Kingdom what's going to happen at the end time it's all in the scripture if it doesn't have its foundation in the scripture then it isn't true right because we believe that the scripture is the entire word of God now uh and but the scripture had Mysteries and that's what in Revelation chapter 5 there's a lamb uh there there's a book and that book I believe is the Bible it's the book of redemption uh it's a book you could say a book of names it's our identity it's who we are it's our Redemption it's the Plan of Redemption uh but it's actually the scriptures that were sealed up with Seven Seals and the lamb no one was found worthy to open the book but aren't you glad that the lamb is worthy the lamb was found worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and so he goes down and he begins to open up the book and and he opened Seven Seals one at a time one through seven now when he opened those seals it it brought a mystery it released a mystery and what was that it was a white horse rider a red horse rider a black horse rider a pale horse rider you could have many different ideas of what that was but he said at the end time that during the days of the seventh angel message that that would be revealed now uh God is going to do something he's going to he's going to tell us what he wants to do in this hour well I'm so glad that he did so God is making it so real now brother brandham was was told by the Holy Spirit to go to Tucson he was told uh to go west and God was making it look re so real to him uh and when he was out west he saw the seven angels which formed a cloud and then it was later a picture taken a sign in the heavens that showed us that Christ was in that cloud and and he saw seven angels which uh uh which actually were uh gave him the mysteries of the seals which revealed that to him now uh the seven angels brought forth the winding up of all the scriptures because all the mysteries of the entire Bible lay in the Seven Seals we know that's the book it's sealed with that even out it's the mystery of the entire book laid in those Seven Seals or let us bring so we believe I'm just going to clue you in on this I believe I don't want to speak for all of you but I think many of you do as well that the seven steel book has been opened and that we're now living in the time when it's our job to consume that and go prophesy again and to the earth now the Seven Seals were open opened up the entire Bible the Seven Seals was seal with seven Mysteries and in these Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it it was the book of redemption New Testament and if this is a little bit deep for you tonight just think about it pray about it like I said you may disagree with me but uh but just just pray about it because I believe it's something that's true now uh the message of the Seven Seals and they're closing brandom says that's the message of the entire Bible so we could say it opens it up but it also closes up the Seven Seals closes the New Testament sealed it up in other words it's it's all of it so that's all that there is now the the angel told Brother brother bandam that the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be open and fulfill Revelation 10 excuse me that in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled before our eyes I'm so glad a prophet could stand up there and say that this day this scripture is fulfilled somebody's got to say that now where do we take that from Jesus standing before the uh in the synagogue and reading in Isaiah where he talked about uh the Lord has anointed me to preach uh Glad Tidings and all of these things he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and a prophet of God came and preached that same thing now these are there were words in the scripture that were to be sealed up till the time of the end Daniel 12:9 I I know this is Elementary but I'm laying a foundation and when when the time comes tonight when it's my time to quit I'll just quit and we'll continue the next time we're here now uh he these words were to be sealed up to the time of the end and he and Daniel 12:9 we find that he said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till when till the time of the end well that's where we're at a time of the end now again brother brandom speaking said where are we in this abrahamic age where are we in this great time we're standing the great hour we're living in he said all the Visions has been fulfilled yes oh I like that all the Visions has been fulfilled now he's saying this in uh uh in 1965 all the Visions have been fulfilled he told about a dream that Junior Jackson had he talked about that dream and we'll get maybe in another service we'll get into that but he he talked about that and he said I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name all these things has been revealed but there's secrets that hid in side because the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals he said I must go there to find it and and so here comes the uh those seven angels that come down and and uh he said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from he said for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will be opened and and he goes on he said here we are today understanding serpent seed uh in a few days he said we understand the correctness of marriage and divorce all these things that God Us open every seal we we could just stop there every seal yeah mystery since the foundation of the world and we've been enjoy the presence of His blessings yes that's true this day this scripture so every Seal's been open yeah the mystery since the foundation of the world so and so I want us to look at at the opening of the seals as not uh seven sermons that are preached in Jeffersonville but something that opened up every sealed mystery of the entire book yeah and so brother brandom talked about how since the opening of The Seven Seals that this has become a new book not because anybody wrote anything new in it but Revelation had come he said the things that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right are you with me so far I know it's a lot of reading tonight it's I'm trying to uh uh trying to teach what brother brandom taught about the seventh seal so you're just going to have to pinch yourself to stay awake but I trust it'll be a blessing to you now so we're the privileged people proven uh not by science but by God that it's right yeah he said God as I've said before in a message God doesn't need anyone to interpret his word this and I've hammered this point but it's so true that God does his own interpreting and ultim whatever it is that we believe has to be interpreted by God all right and and the Rapture itself will be the final showdown like if if we leave here we're right right yeah does that make sense and if that's just that's just the way it is it's a final showdown there'll come a day we'll leave here and that that will prove uh that that that we were right and I trust that we are right I wouldn't stand up here and uh there's other things I could do I don't I wouldn't stand up here and preach if I didn't feel like we had the truth and we believe the truth and yet many other people believe they have the truth I say Seek it with all of your heart look for it with all of your heart but for me and for my house this is what God Said in our day so we find that uh God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass yes he interprets his word to us by that's the way he does with salvation is that right he interprets salvation To Us by saving us yeah right you could say that it's you know some people say well you go shake hands with the preacher others say you speak in tongues others say you do all sorts of things but how does he interpret salvation To Us by saving us yes and we realize that uh that that we are uh we're changed and our life has been changed we're different than what we used to be how many can say that's happened in your life that your life has completely changed from what it was what he has made it so what is that God interpreting his own word he promised to do it and then he did it in your life right well don't you think these end time events will be the same thing God interprets his word by bringing it to pass so somebody has a theory that doesn't come to pass and that theory is not the word of God it can't be because God's words are yay and amen they're always true do you believe that yes they're always true now God can't lie I'm glad I'm glad of that I I'm I rest in that yes because everything else can fall away but God can't lie he said I'm his child he can't lie he said if I would come to him if I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ that me and my house would be saved and I believed and he's not a liar amen that's simple isn't it but that's the truth yes so now brother brandom and and I'm just going to drop some things in tonight and then you chew on them for a couple weeks and we'll come back and and and maybe we'll go into more depth than each thing now brother brandom talks about uh in a sermon called exist the sign of the end sir brother Brandon tied Revelation 10 1:7 and and the revealing of the seven Thunders where it said there were seven Thunders that uttered their voice and John was about to write he said seal it up don't write it uh but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God will be finish so he ties that to his ministry and and then if you fast forward 3 years to 1965 he says three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir now it's history it's past so whatever he preach in is this a sign of the end sir this is important if you believe the message of the hour it's important to understand this whatever he preached in this the sign of the in sir is going to be uh come to pass by the time he preaches uh by the time he preaches what is the attraction on the mountain right it now and again I believe it was his job to reveal it and many of you do now we know uh we know it that was his job to do it and yet there's some controversy and it seems like a big secret surrounding the seventh seal and if you go into the seventh seal sermon the Bible doesn't say that much about it Jesus when he talks about the end time events in Matthew 24 he goes in he parallels six of the seals but when it comes time for the seventh seal there's nothing said about it yeah right he just it says learn a parable of the Fig Tree yeah which we know it's a Jewish nation that that begins to Bud and come back as we're seeing today the things that are going on there but it's a time of uh the seventh seal just a it's an hour and a half into the sermon when he begins to talk actually about the seal and he he begins to tell us about it but he does tell us several things about it he tells us and I think the scripture Bears this out the seventh seal is the end of all things yeah the seventh seal is the end of all things right seven is complete it's over yeah amen I love that he said the seven SE is the end of time it's the end of all things someone say all things the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it's the end of strug the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature the end end of everything and there's the end of the trumpets the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's even the end of time and you find that in Revelation 105 where he says there should be time no longer everything runs out in this time at the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials even in the ushering in of the Millennium is the seventh seal now brother brand said it was like a rocket that fires off and if you've looked at fireworks if you get the good ones you know i' I've got some actually in somewhere in my closet I've got some good fireworks that we didn't get to shoot off this year we didn't think our neighbors would appreciate it but I've got some good ones if you get the good ones the fireworks actually uh they'll go off right and then it'll there'll be an explosion and then there'll be several go off of that right and then it'll explode again and there'll be several go off of that so brother brandom taught us that the seven seal was a an explosion it was a it was an unveiling of a mystery but then off of that over here there's there's part of it over here there's part of it it's the end of this it's the end of that it's the end of all things right wrapped up in the seventh seal so you can talk about the seventh seal a long time and see part of it and not see all of it because it's just the coming of the lord it's just the end of everything so uh now he said now how is he going to do it he said that's what we don't know yeah how he's going to do it he said we don't know and that was at the time of the seven seal now so it's the end of all things he tells us that the seventh seal is the seven Thunders that's the remember it's a moment of it's a time of Silence seven Thunders were uh uh something that could not be understood and so he says I this one I will speak that is the mystery of the seven Thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery and if you wonder about the thunder brother brandham taught us that he that one of the jobs of the seventh angel messenger is to reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals I know this is a lot but just hang with me tonight it will be those divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers he's referencing Malachi 4 now so if uh the divinely revealed mystery truths turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers then I I would leave you with this if the Seven Seals are not revealed it means the seven Thunders are not revealed which means that our hearts have not been turned back and we got to wait on that to happen so he also tells us the seventh seal is the third pole the seventh steel is the third poll now brother brandom again I've explained that to you the third poll of his ministry there's three polls to it the first poll was a healing campaign the second pole was a discernment to know the thoughts and intents of the heart and the the third poll was the uh the opening of the word is what he taught us now the third poll is actually uh during this this time was the greatest of the three but it was the one that got uh it was the one that was hidden it was something that couldn't be impersonated something that uh was not a public show and so he said the seven FS the third poll he he talked about the things that happen and and I'm trying to skip through here so I can get done on time he said he said there was three things that unfolded one unfolded today is one I can't interpret because it's an unknown language but I stand right there and look right straight at it he said and this is the third poll coming up he said that's the reason all heaven was silent remember the third pole was something that we wouldn't understand are you okay tonight you still with me you said brother Ben how in the world does all this apply to my life you're going home one of these days I'm going home one of these days this is not all there is there's a better there's a better place we're going to and we believe this this is how we get here so well how how do we get here by learning it no by by receiving the power the anointing of God the the the uh the Life of Christ within us so we can live it what does that look like I'm getting ahead of myself here but it looks like us walking every day it looks like us doing our job it looks like us but in that we're overcoming in that we've got a revelation that tells us who we are and where we are and what we're doing on the Earth and we're not fatalists we're not just here we're not just some kind of animal or something just going through the motions but we belong to somebody who's had this all planned out all down through time and he's actually taking care of us even down to today so we're manifesting the the seventh seal if we can say it that way we're manifesting the end times We're manifesting The Life of Christ in our own lives and it's way simpler than what we thought it was it's not some great campaign somewhere it's not some great uh uh some even a prophet coming back a prophet is com and gone but that's not what the seventh steel is about the seven steel is us the seven steel is the bride living out until the moment that the body change comes we will not all sleep but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye right oh I'm so grateful for that today now why heaven was silent I mean that's pretty simple isn't it it would be so quiet and so unnoticed you said but God doesn't work like that if God was doing something everybody would know it the Rapture will come and some people won't even know what happened Jesus said you'd come like a thief in the night many people on the Earth won't even know the Rapture took place until the tribulation period starts right then some will look back and say we missed it remember how is that scripturally remember when Elijah when John the Baptist come on the earth in the spirit and the power of Elijah and the disciples who should have known because some of them had been John's disciples and they should have known what had happened but they come to Jesus they said well if you're the Christ they said shouldn't Elijah have come first and Jesus said he already came and you didn't know it and they did to him what they were supposed to do but he said Elijah will come and reveal all things speaking of the Elijah at the end time but he said Elijah already came don't you realize that's exactly how the Rapture will take place that it'll happen in such a minority group you realize Jesus was born and Satan didn't even know it he was hidden from Satan because he tried to kill all the babies but he was warned and went down into Egypt and and Satan didn't even know where he was till he began his ministry amen that's why he began to tempt him and and he went to withstand the Temptation for our sake Satan didn't even know where he was oh my don't you realize that this bride is hidden under the m hisory of the seven seal were hidden under the message of the hour and it's not just something you understand it's something you live right are you with me so far so it's the Seven Seals the third pole see he said that's the reason it was not revealed he said no one should know about it why he couldn't say anything about it and the seventh seal it's also the coming of Christ that's ultimately what it is now brother says there was some reason that God let the seven voices be thundered because must come we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand he opened that seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it right along with what he said no one would know his coming also would not know about the seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together brother Bram in 1963 later on that year he says this he said this book is already opened just waiting for the seventh seal to be identified of the coming of of Christ amen so four things again to to reiterate that tonight the end of all things the Thunders the third pole the coming of Christ everybody got it so far pH it's a lot when brother Brandon preaches this he does something he's never done before he edits the tape and he's very transparent about it he goes to the brothers that that took the tape he preaches a sermon and and then he goes the next day and he goes to the motel room of the brothers who were there making tapes and he told him he said I don't want this sent out the way it is and he goes and edits the tape we have both today we have both copies but he edits the tape to a certain point paragraph 261 and recorded a new portion of about 20 minutes in length he edits out most of what he said about the seven seal you think about that but there was silence in heaven right it wasn't time yet the recording was uh was only released in 1966 after brother brandom passes away now he he stops and he's got he said written on his note stop go no further and and but Joie does like we do sometimes and he goes a little further he had written on his notes don't go any further and he went a little further and then he goes back and takes it off I you know You' say why why would he do that well because again what are we what are we doing this this is a serious thing we're talking about the coming of the Lord we're talking about what God's doing in the end time God's going to do something he's not just going to educate people right he's going to do something he's going to get us ready for a Rapture so he's not going to tell Satan what he's going to do right so when he picks back up in the motel room the first thing he says is it will be a good thing he doesn't know anything about it because if he did then he would impr impersonate that that's his tricks in doing things you remember brother Brandon when he uh when he come out with the with the discernment he could discern the secret of the heart and uh people would come and it happened thousands of times it never failed it was never wrong no one's ever shown any scientific way that it could be done why how was he able to do that it wasn't a man we're not glorifying a man it was God just like any man is gifted to do anything or any man he he was a prophet just like in the Old Testament just like in uh John in the New Testament or Paul uh he was a prophet and so uh we find that uh he he did that but when he did that he tried to explain how it was done right and he said that's where I got in trouble because when he started explaining it that's how you ended up with the televangelist of today that's how you end up with the charismatic movement the entire charismatic movement today was started by the healing Revival of the 40s which is what brother brandham started you go look it up in history and so what was it it was something uh immediately began to be impersonated and you got guys standing up in the pulpit and saying well somewhere there's a headache somebody in the audience has a headache send me5 do and I'll tell you who you know and and and it was so generic and it was obviously false and what we've got today is laughable out there and I don't mean to hurt anybody there's a lot of nonsense out there a lot of nonsense on television today a lot of nonsense in Africa and all over the world just they get whole groups of people to follow them and it's just a a cult it's just nonsense but but that's not what we are we're not a we're not here to Rally around a man we're not here to Rally around a a Doctrine even we're here to to be Christians at the end time that that's what we are we believe what God Said and we're here to to manifest what God Said So uh when you begin to when you begin to realize how Satan immediately begin to impersonate that when he comes to the Third third poll of his ministry or the third phase of his ministry he says well we're we're not going to we're not going to tell anybody about this he said that's his tricks in doing things he said so therefore God has made it so hid to the whole world even to Heaven there's no way of understanding it only as God will reveal it himself oh I'm glad for that you see where where is that in the scripture Luke chap 10: 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things now If you deny the sovereignty of God you got a hard time with this verse because Jesus said his father hid it think about it for a minute God hid his coming you have hid these things from the wise and prudent when he came the first time God hid it from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight God has a right to have a family just like we have a right right to have a family he reveals it to who he wants to reveal it to what did he tell Moses I'll have mercy on whom I will have mercy I'll pardon who on whom I will pardon he he shows us that in Jacob and Esau and I don't want to get into election tonight but that's what God does he hides it from some reveals it to others so now Satan wouldn't know anything about it just like Jesus being born is what we said he doesn't know a thing about it but brother randam taught us he said it will be revealed uh in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in amen so he tells us he says the thing for us to do is be reverent before God and serve him and do all that we know how to do live good Christian lives I think that's good advice don't you he said here we find that the six seal has been open to us we see it and we know that this seven seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrive again he said now we have in completion now by the grace of God all the Myst the six seals that's been sealed up and we understand and know that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public notice the wording that he uses this is in that part that he adds on to the seal seventh seal again he said here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it again so we see it's a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet for the mystery to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride whatever takes place at that time he said now until that time let's just all pray live good straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming but we're this far he did tell us some things he told us it was the third poll he told us it was the Thunders he told us it was the coming of the Lord again what don't we know we don't know the day or the hour of his coming right we don't know when but we know it's it's it's going to happen now so far so good and I'm almost out of time now brother Brandon says now just be as patient as you can he said I feel in this here God will help me Will Reveal and bring into your mind all these other things I've talked on all through the days of the Tabernacle now this is three months after the seals brother Brandon preaches a sermon called Christ is the mystery of God revealed and if you go listen to it it's actually the second part of the seventh seal go listen to it and you'll find I think you'll find that that's true and he even begins exactly the same he said be as patient as you can he said you see why these things I've talked on through all the days of the Tabernacle why I've said what I've said I've done what I've done he said this is why he reads Colossians 1 or Colossians 1:1 15-29 talks about Christ having the preeminence in the church he might have the preeminence oh isn't that what we want him to have tonight we want him to have the preeminence in our lives and he said God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery he said I want to speak to the church this this morning the hidden Mystery of God and he had in his mind before the world ever be began he said how that has unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living so God was actually unfolding more even than what he had unfolded during the seals he said then you will understand clearly you see I believe in what is being done he said God's great mystery of how he said it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it remember there's two things you didn't know how or when but but now watch for just a moment he said Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen God has this all to himself it's a secret said that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to right it see the coming of the Lord he said that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come he said it's a good thing that he doesn't I'm gonna get ahead of myself here we know how right the Rapture message we know how the shout is a message right he comes re 1 Thessalonians 4 he descends with a shout a voice with a trumpet shout is a message Amen to get us ready get the bride ready now he he shown us how we just don't know when but he said he has showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible someone say the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible you want to know what the seals are about you want to know what the Bible's about this is it he said all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type an expressing of what God's Great goal is now in this last days he he's revealed it and shows it he said in God's help we'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it what was it the three-fold purpose God expressing himself in his son Jesus Christ God expressing himself in his church having the preeminence in the church and thirdly going back to the Garden of Eden again God expressing himself oh my oh don't you see what he was doing he was bringing about uh through the through the Revelation through the opening of the word he's bringing us back into a condition where we can give him preeminence again where we're not bound by domination we're not bound by uh by man's ideas we're not bound by what the world thinks about us we're not bound by all the filth and the nonsense of the world but we've come back to a place where we can be a bride to Jesus Christ for his coming right so that's his purpose today is to be preeminent in the church he said now he's Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed someone say every promise so he he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here in the last days by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the Seven Seals he said see he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then Express himself to the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them oh I hope you hear me tonight the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them what is the opening of the seals now think about it he said that's his purpose that's why he had to reveal the mystery of the Seven Seals in this hour was to be preeminent in the church to become the word in the bride so I can say it like this we are the manifestation of the seven seal we are the the one that's been prepared for his coming we are the ones who have the the we we are the mystery we are the bride Revival we are the big fish that was a attracted if you know what I'm talking about we are the bride's Revival we are the people he has preeminent in amen you say that that's big talk can you back it up listen you back it up every day in your life every day you overcome the slay to see and age you back that up every day and I challenge you because not everybody that says they believe this message or even believe what I'm talking about tonight would be even a Christian there's always a mixed multitude there's always three kinds of Believers but I challenge you to be a real believer tonight challenge you to live it to walk that's why it's it's more than an emotional Revival it's more than just shouting and that's part of it but that's not all there is it's more than healing that's part of it but that's not all there is it's more than all of these things what is it it's living it's just living and we show by becoming like Christ who we are we prove to the world not by going through the scripture and tying them up in the scriptures that's not how we're going to oh my it's not how we express Christ we don't express Christ just by preaching we don't express Christ just by yelling at people are you with me tonight but Jason you can express Christ uh Peter you can express Christ all of you can Emma you can express Christ somehow your life in the way that you conduct yourself around other young people you can express Christ to the world it's that simple that we've made it some great big intellectual thing it's not understanding it it's expressing it it's just living it it's just becoming the word for our day it's something that was so hidden from the world and so it's so simple that the world can't see it but he said God hides himself in Simplicity and then reveals himself in the same he hides himself in Simplicity he reveals himself in Simplicity in the simple bride living on the earth you are the people he has the preeminence in say thanks be to God for that and then that's not a book of rules it's not a cult or some guy standing up here beating you over the head telling you how to dress and how to live I I I very rarely have to preach to you about how you dress or what you do you realize why I very rarely have to do that because you want to serve God there's something in you that just wants to serve God you want to live for God you want to love God you want to do what the Bible says and and we'll talk about those things but you're not you don't do that just because I beat you over the head with it you do it because you love God that's the time we've got to live in church we got to go beyond the uh there's a time for the ABCs I believe we've got that but we've got to come up higher we've got to reach the place where we are that Ephesian church that's going back into the land that's taking our land this message is more than stories I've just laid a groundwork here tonight a a a platform for where we want to go in the seven seal but this message is more than stories it's the living bread of life bringing forth the bride we're not feeding on the words of a man we're feeding on the body word of the unfailing body word of the son of man I want to leave you with this because there's some that believe the seven seal is not open if the seven seal based on what we've read tonight and what we've already seen just in this short study tonight if the seventh seal is not open we cannot have rapturing faith I want to go in a Rapture I don't know about you our hearts can't be turned back think about it if it's not open we don't have rapturing faith our hearts have not been turned back because it'll be those revealed mystery truths that will do it the Greater Works cannot be done by the bride the manifestation of the third pole in the bride can can't be done right we cannot manifest the fullness of Christ and the word in our lives because there's some part missing look you realize what a what a great thing that is I believe it's open I believe the book is open I believe a mighty angel came down in our day wasn't a prophet Christ I believe came down in our day and it wasn't that man that man was a man like any other man but it was Christ in a man just like it's Christ in you the hope of glory as Paul says Christ in you and Christ in me oh I'm so glad for that today so glad he can reveal himself simply in our day but see it's so hard because we it's hid behind a veil of Flesh the seventh seal hid behind veil of Flesh he's always been hid behind flesh always hid himself that way they said that couldn't be God but it was God they said we know his his mother we know his brothers but he was God he was God In the Flesh amen the musicians would come when all the seals were open the silence was broken there was a half hour of Silence a short time half hour when the seals were open the silence was broken John shouted so loud everyone in Heaven could hear him Amen brother brandham calls that the worship time for the king lamb I'll say this he's the one we worship we worship the lamb the lamb that opened the seals not the prophet that showed us that that took the book and uh from the lamb that was already opened by the hands of the lamb but it was the lamb that we worship it's Christ that we worship I think we ought to do that tonight if we bow our heads together I think it's worship time brother bandam tells us now everything is worship every people that should be able to worship God it ought to be us say but brother Ben you don't know what I've been through I don't but I know what God's about to do I know what he's about about to do he said well when will it happen I don't know that but I know in a moment in a twinkling of an eye these bodies are going to be changed and we're going home and that makes everything look small doesn't it we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed he said the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain to the coming Lord shall not hinder them which are asleep oh my the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the trumpet of God the dead in Christ arise first I tell you what I believe we're living in those times in these times we're living in the manifestation of the son of man we're living the unfolding of the seven seal it's the end time and if we are then we ought to we ought to live like it we ought to believe it we ought to trust him with all of our Lives all of our heart we ought to worship him like never before let's just pray that way could we if you got something that maybe something you've been dealing with in your life you just want to talk to him for a minute say Lord I want to be ready I want to be ready to go I I I don't want to be left here for the tribulation period I I want to want to go home I want to go with Jesus I want to go with you would you just talk to him like that tonight maybe you don't understand all the things that I've said tonight but if you don't you just be as good a Christian as you can be you young people you you live for God with all of your heart trust him trust him in every moment of your life and he'll he'll do right by you he he'll never fail you'll never leave you never forsake you Heavenly Father we thank you we thank you for this night Lord Lord as I my heart is stirred tonight as we begin to preach on these things and just kind of laying a groundwork for where we want to go in the future but Lord I I pray that it would be helpful to somebody Lord to recognize that the seals are open and the lamb has taken the book and here we are we're living right here in the closing days of Time Lord one of these days that lamb will literally take the people home take us home Lord I'm looking forward to that I pray God that you'll move in our lives Lord if there's one that's not ready to meet you I pray that they would come to that place in you tonight and they would make themselves ready Lord I pray you'd bring Revelation to our hearts Lord give us humility with it Lord we know true Revelation brings humility Lord not arrogance or I'm better than you but Lord help us to live it help us to treat people the way that you treated people Lord to walk the way you walked to live like you to give you the preeminence in the body I pray you'd Grant it Lord Lord we thank you Lord for the church and the people Lord that have sacrificed to be here tonight I I pray you'd bless them I I pray you'd heal them I pray you'd walk in and and Lord with them all through their work and what they have to do Lord help us we we don't want want to fail you in any way we want to live right we want to do right pray you'd help us to do that we ask in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah oh we [Music] are the will hear the coming the Lord
