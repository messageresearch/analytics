[55:07] we pray and all the Believers says
[55:10] amen and amen God bless you this evening
[55:13] in Ephesians the second chapter we want
[55:15] to look here in the fourth verse of
[55:18] Ephesians 2. Paul here says
[55:21] but God who is rich in Mercy how many
[55:24] beliefs he's rich in Mercy for his great
[55:27] love wherewith he loved us
[55:29] for when we even when we were dead in
[55:32] sin hath quickened us together with
[55:34] Christ by Grace you are saved and hath
[55:37] raised us up together notice this hath
[55:40] raised us up together and made us sit
[55:43] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[55:46] Jesus
[55:47] so notice this he hath raised us up so
[55:49] he's not left us where we were but he's
[55:51] raised us up and where he's raised us to
[55:53] his Heavenly places
[55:55] that in the ages to come he might show
[55:58] the exceeding Riches of his grace in his
[56:01] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[56:04] now I also want to look in the book of
[56:06] Colossians the third chapter
[56:08] the book of Colossians the third chapter
[56:11] and in the first verse I want to pull a
[56:14] passage of scripture from there this
[56:16] evening in Colossians 3 and verse 1. I
[56:20] know you all know this verse by heart
[56:21] Paul here again writing he says if ye
[56:24] then be risen with Christ seek those
[56:27] things which are above so you've been
[56:29] raised up now seek those things which
[56:31] are up where you've been raised to seek
[56:33] those things which are above where
[56:35] Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
[56:37] notice this word set somebody say set
[56:41] set your affection on things above and
[56:44] not on things on the earth for ye are
[56:47] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[56:49] God and when Christ who is our life
[56:52] shall appear then shall ye also appear
[56:55] with him in glory amen we ask Lord this
[56:58] evening to add the blessing to reading
[57:00] of his word as you can be seated here
[57:02] this evening amen God bless you brother
[57:03] Vernon sure good to see you this evening
[57:05] buddy amen the the book of Ephesians in
[57:08] the book of Colossians I believe are two
[57:10] very very powerful books in the Bible
[57:12] and from those uh passages of scripture
[57:15] tonight I want to speak to you for just
[57:16] a few moments here and if I title this
[57:18] tonight I want to speak to you on
[57:19] Heavenly set Heavenly set I I believe
[57:23] that this is not the hour to be drifting
[57:26] I believe this is the hour to be set I
[57:28] don't believe this is the hour to be
[57:29] wondering or looking here or there
[57:31] trying to find something to believe
[57:33] trying to find something to get a part
[57:35] of but this is the hour to be said I
[57:37] believe this is the hour Amen to set our
[57:40] Spirits Amen to send our hearts to set
[57:42] our mind to set our Focus amen not on
[57:44] everything but on one thing and that is
[57:47] the Lord Jesus Christ now the pride of
[57:49] God said and presuming he said I put my
[57:51] choice with the Full Gospel many years
[57:52] ago he said and I'm happier every day
[57:55] about it I'm thankful to be one of them
[57:57] how many can say I'm thankful to be one
[57:59] of them and having this Grand experience
[58:01] of receiving Christ Just My Savior and
[58:04] in returns having him to fill me with
[58:06] his Holy Spirit and living in my heart
[58:08] daily as a witness to me that I have
[58:11] passed from Death unto life and testing
[58:13] my plan of my salvation each day as I
[58:15] take inventory see just the way the
[58:18] spirit in me what does it feel like how
[58:20] does it cooperate amen with the things
[58:22] of the world or is it so Heavenly Sent
[58:25] till the world seems dull dingy and
[58:28] dirty amen is the Heavenly spirit in you
[58:31] is your spirit so Heavenly said amen to
[58:34] the things of the world become dull they
[58:36] become dingy and they become dirty again
[58:38] Junction of time 56 he said Noah was
[58:41] right taking away Not only was he
[58:43] performing a miracle or looking for a
[58:45] miracle he said but the church today as
[58:47] it is laboring away under the task of
[58:49] the preaching of the Gospel with signs
[58:51] and wonders of following they are
[58:53] preparing for a miracle that's why we're
[58:55] here tonight as we are preparing for a
[58:58] miracle see and that Miracle is the
[59:00] rapture of the church he said and the
[59:02] going home amen the miracle that we're
[59:04] looking for amen is beyond just cancer
[59:07] being healed it's beyond just blind eyes
[59:09] being open it's beyond and then just the
[59:11] deaf hearing or the dumb speaking but
[59:13] the miracle that we are looking for amen
[59:15] is the miracle of the changing of our
[59:17] bodies listen amen we've got a right
[59:19] tonight amen to petition Our Father amen
[59:22] for the Fulfillment of his promise
[59:24] listen I didn't make the promise I will
[59:26] not fulfill the promise Amen brother
[59:28] Branham did not make the promise he will
[59:30] not fulfill the promise amen but God who
[59:32] is rich in Mercy made a promise that
[59:34] some morning had been between six and
[59:36] nine your body is going to come under
[59:38] the influence of a change amen from
[59:41] habited to immortality that's not going
[59:43] to be an emotion it's not going to be a
[59:45] feeling amen but it's going to be the
[59:47] greatest miracle that you've ever
[59:49] experienced amen is it the moment in the
[59:51] twinkling of the night amen you go from
[59:53] one dimension to another amen we are
[59:56] preparing people getting them live
[59:57] getting them unburdened amen from the
[1:00:00] things of the world and getting their
[1:00:02] soul set in the presence of God Amen
[1:00:04] that when Jesus does appear the second
[1:00:06] time in glory amen those who are ready
[1:00:09] for the Rapture will be caught up
[1:00:11] together Amen to meet him in the air and
[1:00:14] be with him amen we are our Spirits are
[1:00:16] becoming unfocused on the things of the
[1:00:18] world and they are becoming so Heavenly
[1:00:21] Sent amen took the things of this world
[1:00:23] are becoming dull they're becoming dingy
[1:00:25] and they're becoming dirty amen but
[1:00:28] there's a bride whose Soul has been said
[1:00:30] in the presence of God again he said
[1:00:32] don't be tossed about with every wind of
[1:00:34] Doctrine believe God's word amen get
[1:00:37] stable and get set amen believe God's
[1:00:40] word get table and get sent listen amen
[1:00:43] the days of playing church is over and
[1:00:45] then the days are being on fire one week
[1:00:47] and being cold the next them days are
[1:00:49] over hey then the days of entertaining
[1:00:51] the things of the world one day that
[1:00:53] entertaining the things of God the next
[1:00:54] them days are over amen but the Church
[1:00:57] of the Living God under the teaching of
[1:00:59] the message of the hour has come to a
[1:01:01] stability amen where we're not focused
[1:01:04] on the things of the world Amen but our
[1:01:06] Focus has been heavily since now I love
[1:01:08] that word Heavenly it means relating to
[1:01:10] Heaven or the heavens amen it is divine
[1:01:13] it is suggesting the Blessed state of
[1:01:16] Heaven now I've just got to give you a
[1:01:17] disclaimer of what I believe amen I
[1:01:20] don't believe we got to wait till we get
[1:01:21] to heaven to enjoy Heaven amen but I
[1:01:24] believe there's a bride on this side of
[1:01:26] Eternity amen that's already enjoying
[1:01:28] the Heavenly things amen because she has
[1:01:31] received the Heavenly experience Amen in
[1:01:34] her soul that has moved to her amen from
[1:01:36] the influence of corruption to the
[1:01:38] influence of immortality amen from the
[1:01:40] info words of sin Amen to the influence
[1:01:43] of Faith amen it's time to be looking
[1:01:45] towards heaven now when you look at this
[1:01:47] word saying I know it's a small word we
[1:01:49] use it every day but it packs a powerful
[1:01:51] definition it means to put lay or stand
[1:01:54] something in a specified place or
[1:01:57] position it means to be situated or
[1:01:59] fixed in a specified place or position
[1:02:01] it means to put a seed or a plant in the
[1:02:05] ground to grow it means to put a meant a
[1:02:07] sail up in position to catch the wind it
[1:02:10] needs to call someone or something Amen
[1:02:13] to start doing something so when you
[1:02:15] said something amen you're putting it in
[1:02:18] position Amen to start doing something
[1:02:20] it means to instruct someone Amen to do
[1:02:23] something it means to give someone a
[1:02:25] task a minute means to have a blossom or
[1:02:27] a tree it means to develop into or
[1:02:30] produce fruit amen so you don't just
[1:02:32] throw a plan out there amen but you set
[1:02:34] the plants amen you don't just throw an
[1:02:36] apple seed out there amen but you set
[1:02:39] the apple seed in hopes and then when
[1:02:41] the sun and the water and the and the
[1:02:43] elements that it takes to cause the seed
[1:02:45] to grow amen comes upon the seed you're
[1:02:48] going to see an influence amen of a
[1:02:50] fruit come out of that seed and I
[1:02:52] believe that it's the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ the prophet of God said amen that
[1:02:55] we are heavenlies in our soul he didn't
[1:02:58] say we're heavenlies in our flesh he
[1:03:00] didn't say we're heavenlies in our
[1:03:02] spirit amen but we are heavenlies in our
[1:03:05] soul and mother man emphatically teaches
[1:03:07] that the believer's position in Christ
[1:03:09] amen is in Heavenly places amen then the
[1:03:13] position that the believer has been set
[1:03:15] in amen is not in depression amen your
[1:03:18] position is not in anxiety and then your
[1:03:21] position is not in the Republican party
[1:03:23] or the Democrat Party or the Liberal
[1:03:26] Party amen but your heavenly given
[1:03:28] position amen is in Heavenly places amen
[1:03:31] and that is the only place that a
[1:03:33] Believer amen can grow and listen this
[1:03:36] bride will not grow in a cold and
[1:03:37] different atmosphere amen because she's
[1:03:40] not a layout of sin statement she will
[1:03:42] not grow in a society and then because
[1:03:44] she's not a citizen of this Kingdom amen
[1:03:46] but she's been claimed by eighteen seen
[1:03:49] amen from before the foundation of the
[1:03:51] world her life has been placed in
[1:03:53] Prophecy therefore the only place she
[1:03:55] can grow up is where the message of the
[1:03:58] hour has Supreme preeminence
[1:04:01] good this ride can grow is the place
[1:04:04] where the message has amen the supreme
[1:04:06] position the Supreme preeminence listen
[1:04:09] amen this is not a Pentecostal message
[1:04:11] this is an adoption message it is a
[1:04:15] message that is positionally placing us
[1:04:17] Amen in Heavenly places let me let me
[1:04:20] say this the bride by an adoption
[1:04:22] message has been positionally placed in
[1:04:25] the heavenlies now I can prove it to you
[1:04:27] about the message the prophet said the
[1:04:28] heavenlies amen is the position of the
[1:04:31] church he said the position of the
[1:04:33] church amen should be plum in the
[1:04:35] heavenlies amen not down here floating
[1:04:37] around through the clouds buzzing around
[1:04:39] like an airplane amen but something
[1:04:42] that's propelled by something amen that
[1:04:44] sends it beyond anything that an
[1:04:46] airplane can think of Amen it's an
[1:04:48] astronaut amen that's the age we're
[1:04:50] living in now amen is spiritual
[1:04:53] astronauts amen so through the countdown
[1:04:55] message we have come from the horse and
[1:04:57] buggy we have come from the automobile
[1:04:59] we have come from the airplane amen and
[1:05:02] we had broke out into the influence of
[1:05:04] outer space amen and the prophet of God
[1:05:06] said the age we're now living in amen is
[1:05:08] spiritual astronauts he said again live
[1:05:11] in the heavenlies and I propose to you
[1:05:13] tonight amen that we don't just visit
[1:05:15] the heavenlies they've been in a special
[1:05:17] meeting we don't just visit the
[1:05:18] heavenlies amen come on young people we
[1:05:21] don't just visit the heavenlies at Youth
[1:05:23] Camp amen but under the message of the
[1:05:25] hour amen we have been positionally
[1:05:27] placed in the heavenlies amen that no
[1:05:30] matter what's going on around us no
[1:05:32] matter what's going on about us amen we
[1:05:34] are in the heavenlies and the devil

[1:05:38] can't hold us come on there's a seed
[1:05:40] inside of you amen and that seed has
[1:05:43] been quickened amen by Heavenly
[1:05:45] influenced amen that's why the devil
[1:05:47] hates you amen because everything he
[1:05:49] throws at you amen you rise above it
[1:05:51] amen every sickness should rise above it
[1:05:54] you say well somebody got sick and they
[1:05:55] died amen but some morning between six
[1:05:58] and nine amen that dead in Christ shall

[1:06:08] living by the Earthly things amen we're
[1:06:10] living by the Heavenly amen we're not
[1:06:12] moving by the Earthly news we're living
[1:06:14] by the Heavenly news and it's the Gospel
[1:06:16] of Jesus Christ we are living in the
[1:06:19] heavenlies he said carry yourself away
[1:06:21] amen how many say oh God carry me away

[1:06:36] the spirit you know why every little
[1:06:37] thing's bothering us and afflicting us

[1:12:48] I'm going to beat that devil come out of

[1:12:52] EarthBound
[1:12:53] when I'm just here some might as well
[1:12:55] preach amen we're too Earthbound you say
[1:12:58] me yeah I'm saying me you every one of
[1:13:00] us we have come to Earthbound we're too
[1:13:03] worried about this and worried about man
[1:13:04] and what's the future hold and the
[1:13:07] American dollars losing value and the
[1:13:09] political worlds in an uproar and they
[1:13:11] can't produce a republican they can't
[1:13:13] produce a Democrat amen our eyes have
[1:13:15] become so Earthbound that the things of
[1:13:17] the world have become our Focus amen but
[1:13:20] God who is rich in Mercy has fulfilled
[1:13:23] his promised word and his sin and
[1:13:25] anointing in this age to lift your eyes
[1:13:27] off of these things Amen to see like
[1:13:29] Enoch they meant to see like Abraham
[1:13:31] come on church I want to see like David
[1:13:34] amen I want to be able to stand and say
[1:13:36] I once was young amen but now I'm old
[1:13:39] and I've never seen the righteous
[1:13:41] forsaken or his seed begging bread I
[1:13:43] want to see like Abraham I want to see
[1:13:46] that my father owns the Catalan of
[1:13:48] thousand healed I want to walk like
[1:13:50] Enoch I Want to Love Like Jesus I want
[1:13:53] to pray like Daniel and the only thing
[1:13:55] that can put me in position to do it is
[1:13:58] the word of the age I'm living
[1:14:01] now you say brother Andrew to Earth
[1:14:03] bound Prophet God said show us the
[1:14:04] father 55 he said they need their eyes
[1:14:07] open I said yes brother Adam that's
[1:14:09] right I do too they need their eyes open
[1:14:11] he said people become so Earthbound just
[1:14:15] like this was the only place there was
[1:14:18] but there's a Heavenly world too
[1:14:21] it's this it's all around us so notice
[1:14:24] brother Jeff he wasn't saying there's a
[1:14:26] Heavenly world coming he said there's a
[1:14:28] heaven Heaven world too and it's all
[1:14:31] around us listen you don't have to die
[1:14:33] to go see heaven
[1:14:35] Heaven has come into this Dimension
[1:14:37] Heaven is wherever Christ is yes things
[1:14:40] are to be there's a real heaven I
[1:14:42] believe that but what about the Father's
[1:14:44] prayer when he said Lord let thy will be
[1:14:47] done on Earth as it is in heaven that
[1:14:50] that was a prophecy that before the
[1:14:52] kingdom of God would come the Heavenly
[1:14:54] Kingdom there would be a spiritual
[1:14:56] Kingdom who would be operating according
[1:14:59] Amen to the code that they are operating
[1:15:01] in the Heavenly Kingdom there is a
[1:15:03] Heavenly world too and it's all around
[1:15:05] us now what catches my attention there
[1:15:07] brother brother Ben is it said they need
[1:15:09] their eyes open and this is the age the
[1:15:12] age where the astronauts would be born
[1:15:13] out of that the Bible said that he would
[1:15:16] anoint your eyes with eyes have that
[1:15:18] thou mayest be able to see look at this
[1:15:21] word see it means to look it means to
[1:15:23] discern it means to see with ones with
[1:15:26] the Mind's Eye it means to understand it
[1:15:29] means to discover it means to observe it
[1:15:31] means to contemplate it means to weigh
[1:15:34] carefully to examine now look at this
[1:15:36] other definition it means turning
[1:15:38] towards something it means to face it so
[1:15:41] when you actually see something you
[1:15:43] actually put your body in position
[1:15:44] you've turned towards it and you can see
[1:15:47] it listen amen somebody tell you to see
[1:15:49] something sometimes to really see it you
[1:15:51] got to change your position if you're
[1:15:53] going to see it amen if I say if I say
[1:15:55] look brother Harvey's in the back and
[1:15:57] you keep sitting there looking at me
[1:15:59] you're never going to see by the harmony
[1:16:01] amen because the only way you're going
[1:16:03] to see him is you've got to turn your
[1:16:05] body in the direction that the voice is
[1:16:07] announcing there's a sight to see a
[1:16:09] Church of the Living God Amen there's
[1:16:11] more on this world to see amen than just
[1:16:14] our jobs and our schools and our careers
[1:16:16] amen but there's a Heavenly world and
[1:16:19] then there's a Heavenly Dimension
[1:16:20] there's a Heavenly man I'm on church I
[1:16:23] see the resurrection I see the Rapture I
[1:16:25] see the future hold I see things that
[1:16:28] are to me I see a theophany I see a
[1:16:30] Brides Revival I hear the sounding of
[1:16:32] seven punders I see the revelation of
[1:16:35] the book of Revelation and the age I'm
[1:16:37] living and the only way I could see it
[1:16:39] was to be changed from the way I was
[1:16:41] sinning in the Earthly Dimension and
[1:16:43] raised the Heavenly places
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:47] if you're gonna see some things you're
[1:16:49] going to turn around and look at them
[1:16:51] hey y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[1:16:53] if you're gonna see it you're gonna turn
[1:16:55] sometimes people say well I don't know
[1:16:57] brother said may they understand he said
[1:16:59] anoint their eyes with ASAP he sent an
[1:17:02] anoint mind too
[1:17:04] that's a mouthful and it's a prophet of
[1:17:07] God didn't just want to tell you it was
[1:17:08] there he wanted to see it too brother
[1:17:10] Joe he wanted to see what he was telling
[1:17:12] you to look at he said anoint Man Too
[1:17:15] Lord that we might see the invisible God
[1:17:18] now that's a that's an all-night
[1:17:20] preaching point right there that we
[1:17:22] might see the invisible God who is
[1:17:25] working among his people as he promised
[1:17:28] look here that's almost a contradicting
[1:17:31] statement amen see the invisible God if
[1:17:34] something is invisible how are you going
[1:17:37] to see it unless it comes into the realm
[1:17:40] of his ability and the prophet of God
[1:17:42] said the word was invisible until it was
[1:17:45] made flesh and then the word become
[1:17:47] visible amen so now the Church of the
[1:17:51] Living God can receive the ice have Amen
[1:17:54] to see the invisible God in her age he
[1:17:57] said through his sacrificial death at
[1:17:59] Calvary and his resurrection amen
[1:18:01] positionally placed his church in that
[1:18:04] realm he said that the same invisible
[1:18:07] God could come into the individual and
[1:18:10] make the word visible oh my if you can
[1:18:12] see friends the invisible God is made
[1:18:15] visible so the connection or the job
[1:18:18] between invisible God and visible God is
[1:18:21] a word made flesh and when the word is
[1:18:23] made flesh amen the word is made flesh
[1:18:26] by the manifestation of the word and the
[1:18:28] prophet of God said the bride's Mage
[1:18:30] amen is the revealed word right the mate
[1:18:33] of the Bride is a revealed word he said
[1:18:35] that how shall he appear in the last
[1:18:38] days is to bring the bride back to the
[1:18:40] revealed word which is her mate he said
[1:18:43] and the word made flesh is the light of
[1:18:46] the age when you see it come on church
[1:18:48] amen that's why we can't hold our peace
[1:18:50] that's why we're preaching on a Tuesday
[1:18:52] night amen that's why we're gathered out
[1:18:54] here on a Tuesday night meeting they've
[1:18:57] been singing and that's the glory of God
[1:18:58] it's because we've seen him in the
[1:19:00] invisible God in hell he is no longer
[1:19:03] behind the fail a tradition he is no
[1:19:06] longer behind the veil amen if some men
[1:19:08] made denomination but the invisible God
[1:19:10] has been made visible in my age by the
[1:19:13] preaching of the message of the hour I
[1:19:15] can see Jesus I can hug his neck amen I
[1:19:18] can kiss his feet I can love on him
[1:19:21] tonight because the message has brought
[1:19:23] him visible
[1:19:24] yeah
[1:19:25] oh they say preacher won't you calm down
[1:19:28] you tell me how I can see what I see and
[1:19:31] be quiet about it
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] I can believe what I believe
[1:19:36] how this you tell me how I can live
[1:19:38] every day under the influence of some
[1:19:40] moment I could see my loved ones appear
[1:19:43] behind me and hold my peace about it
[1:19:45] listen I'm not Earthbound I'm not a
[1:19:48] chicken ass I'm in denominational
[1:19:50] chicken I have been released by The
[1:19:52] quickening Power of the mercy of God and
[1:19:55] the age I'm living in
[1:19:57] I can see things beyond the way the
[1:20:00] world sees him I can believe things
[1:20:02] beyond the way the denomination believes
[1:20:04] them because the Holy Spirit has
[1:20:06] anointed my eyes
[1:20:08] with the I said now people say well
[1:20:10] preacher you better be careful about
[1:20:12] this about this fourth line and this
[1:20:14] bright age well let's just say what a
[1:20:16] prophet says that okay
[1:20:19] he said without the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:22] Ghost you can never have your eyes open
[1:20:25] to a true spiritual revelation of the
[1:20:28] word
[1:20:29] now you tell me what was the baptism of
[1:20:31] the Holy Ghost it was the Pentecostal
[1:20:34] age what was the bride age it was the
[1:20:36] word itself
[1:20:38] the Holy Ghost itself so you can't go
[1:20:41] justification sanctification skip the
[1:20:44] baptism and go to the Holy Ghost itself
[1:20:47] but the justification pave the way for
[1:20:50] the sanctification and the
[1:20:51] sanctification paid way for the baptism
[1:20:53] of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[1:20:57] Holy Ghost paved the way for the Holy
[1:20:59] Ghost itself and that my friend is the
[1:21:01] spiritual revelation of the word and the
[1:21:04] age that you're living listen this eye
[1:21:06] thing it's more than just anointing your
[1:21:08] eyes to see remember the door of the
[1:21:10] soul is the eye the problem of God said
[1:21:12] the door of the Soul it is the eye now
[1:21:15] what age are we living in we're living
[1:21:17] in the laodicean age I get that I'm not
[1:21:19] ignorant I can read
[1:21:29] come on go look at your stature a
[1:21:31] perfect man pyramid and between the
[1:21:33] seventh age and the Capstone was a
[1:21:35] wreath feeling of the Holy Ghost which
[1:21:38] was the age when the son of man would be
[1:21:40] revealed between the Son of God and the
[1:21:43] son of David come on church he comes in
[1:21:45] three sins names Revelation series
[1:21:46] remember said he comes in four Sons he
[1:21:48] said Son of Man Son of God Son of David
[1:21:50] Son of Abraham he said Son of Abraham
[1:21:53] he's heir to the Royal Grant he's son of
[1:21:56] man he's heir to the Earth he said that
[1:21:57] Son of God he's heir to all things he
[1:21:59] said Son of David he's heir to the
[1:22:01] throne amen then watch a prophet showing
[1:22:03] you positionally where you are you're
[1:22:05] not under the Son of God you're not
[1:22:07] under the son of David you're not under
[1:22:09] the son of Abraham according to Luke 17
[1:22:12] 30 you are under the son of man which is
[1:22:15] the where he is the heir to the Earth
[1:22:17] come on church and it's in the rise of
[1:22:19] the sun he said for the first time he
[1:22:22] said the sheath must be waived amen over
[1:22:25] the Church of the Living God Amen to
[1:22:27] show amen that there's more to come
[1:22:29] after the one that has come to maturity
[1:22:31] then tell me where did you come from you
[1:22:34] didn't come from Pluto you didn't come
[1:22:36] from Neptune amen you come from the
[1:22:38] earth amen then when the son of man
[1:22:40] returned according to Luke 17 30 he was
[1:22:43] returning to take possession of what he
[1:22:46] was going to reign with in the
[1:22:48] Millennium come on Church you are the
[1:22:50] citizens of the future home you are the
[1:22:52] occupants of the Millennium you are the
[1:22:55] people who will sit at the marriage
[1:22:57] supper I'm the lamb and the son of man
[1:22:59] has been revealed in this generation to
[1:23:02] claim you from religion to claim you
[1:23:04] from certainty and to put you in a
[1:23:06] position with God where you can believe
[1:23:08] I never become a son I always was a son
[1:23:11] I never become a daughter of God I
[1:23:14] always was one
[1:23:16] I say oh God anoint our eyes to see
[1:23:19] anoint our eyes to see that we're not
[1:23:22] about your Pentecostals up and down in
[1:23:24] and out we have come to a mature
[1:23:26] revelation
[1:23:28] We Are Who the word says we are
[1:23:31] come on Church you know I'm preaching
[1:23:33] you the truth it's all through the
[1:23:34] message it's the son of man claiming his
[1:23:38] rights
[1:23:39] now the product God said there's two
[1:23:41] types of blindness he said there's
[1:23:42] physical blindness and there's spiritual
[1:23:45] blindness now watch this he said certain
[1:23:47] man told me that they said if you be a
[1:23:48] servant of Christ you have the Holy
[1:23:50] Ghost then strike me blind I said Paul
[1:23:52] he says Paul struck a man blind he said
[1:23:54] you strike me blind I said brother I
[1:23:56] can't do what the devil's already done
[1:23:59] do what the devil's already done you're
[1:24:02] blind now and don't know it brother
[1:24:04] Vernon that man could drive a car that
[1:24:06] man could pay his own bills that man
[1:24:08] could walk to the grocery Market
[1:24:09] unassisted but he was so blind he
[1:24:12] couldn't even see amen that God was
[1:24:14] standing before him veiled in a flesh
[1:24:16] body called a Vindicated prophet he said
[1:24:18] you're blind now and don't know it he
[1:24:20] said when the Bible speaks blind it
[1:24:22] means physical blind I said well then
[1:24:24] tell me how Elisha amen struck the whole
[1:24:26] Syrian Army blind and said are you
[1:24:29] looking for Elisha he struck the whole
[1:24:31] Syrian Army blind and brother Joe he
[1:24:34] turns and says are you looking for
[1:24:36] Elisha they said yes said well follow me
[1:24:39] I'm on church amen they could see but
[1:24:42] they couldn't see Elisha unless they
[1:24:44] followed a Vindicated prophet he said if
[1:24:46] you're looking for Elisha then follow me
[1:24:48] and I'll show you where he's at let me
[1:24:50] just go and say if you get before this
[1:24:52] message you're not going to find the
[1:24:54] future home you're not going to find a
[1:24:56] body change come on Church you're not
[1:24:58] going to find the marriage supper of the
[1:25:00] lamb but the leadership of this age is
[1:25:02] to follow the Vindicated word of the age
[1:25:06] that you're living in he said I'll show
[1:25:07] you where he's had he said gehaisa was
[1:25:09] blind and he was standing there and he
[1:25:12] come in and he said hey he said Elisha
[1:25:14] he said we're in a bad shape he said
[1:25:16] they're surrounding us out there he said
[1:25:18] Elisha went out there come back in and
[1:25:20] said there's more with us than there is
[1:25:22] with him nobody brother Jeff LED gehaza
[1:25:25] out there and let him back his physical
[1:25:27] eyesight conceived but his spiritual
[1:25:29] eyesight was blind but when Elisha
[1:25:31] walked out there and looked at the
[1:25:33] mountains looked at the hills he said

[1:27:07] privileges among church amen when the
[1:27:10] word is coming forth and the anointing
[1:27:12] is moving that's not the time to sit
[1:27:14] there and start calculating how many
[1:27:16] times you've heard a preacher preach
[1:27:17] that quote how many times you've heard
[1:27:19] him cover that scripture amen that's the
[1:27:21] time Amen to defy that Earthbound

[1:28:07] mine The Prodigal daughter is mine
[1:28:11] I'm on church that's the faith anointing
[1:28:13] you it meant to rise up out of this
[1:28:15] condition of laodicea of blindness and
[1:28:17] claim what God has opened your eyes to
[1:28:19] see
[1:28:21] what I'm talking that is your spiritual
[1:28:22] blindness yeah
[1:28:24] and the prophet of God said it's 10
[1:28:25] million times worse than physical
[1:28:27] blindness
[1:28:29] he said if I had to go blind let it be
[1:28:31] my physical eyes and God let me keep the
[1:28:33] eyes of my spirit he said I want to see
[1:28:35] his glory
[1:28:36] he said I want to see he's here here he
[1:28:39] said I want to say that Christ still
[1:28:41] lives I'm on Church what did they say to
[1:28:43] Fanny Crosby they said sell out your
[1:28:45] gift amen send out your gift she said I
[1:28:48] would rather sing this music she said
[1:28:50] with these blinded eyes and for the
[1:28:52] first time my eyes come open to look
[1:28:55] upon my savior I'm on church amen and
[1:28:58] that was under an anointing that's not
[1:28:59] even your anointing but she was so
[1:29:01] dedicated that she wanted to see Jesus
[1:29:04] what about a church of living God I
[1:29:06] think it's time to get our eyes off of
[1:29:08] all the problems all the disappears imma
[1:29:10] get your eyes off all the confusion and
[1:29:13] get your eyes back on the glory of the
[1:29:15] Lord you're going to see him if you can
[1:29:17] just get the Holy Ghost anoint your eyes
[1:29:20] now I know why the eyes get tightened up
[1:29:22] it's because there's a cold drift coming
[1:29:24] through the church early said Mama took
[1:29:26] that grease he said that matter in
[1:29:28] her eyes so thick he said we couldn't
[1:29:30] see nothing he said Mama come in there
[1:29:32] with that hot grease rub it in her
[1:29:33] eyes he said now that's not cool grease
[1:29:35] today will work he said but he said it
[1:29:38] worked in the natural but not today he
[1:29:39] said there's some cold grass and if the
[1:29:42] churches got into he said you're going
[1:29:43] to have to let the Holy Spirit I sound
[1:29:45] anoint the eyes of his church and get
[1:29:49] all the cold out of your eyes he said
[1:29:51] another place I'm afraid her eyes have
[1:29:53] sort of frozen shut and she is blind to
[1:29:56] what God has for her I'm on church amen
[1:29:59] he didn't say you're blind to what he's
[1:30:00] got for some other age amen but you're
[1:30:02] blind to what God's got for you but she
[1:30:05] needs some huddle or the spirit of God
[1:30:07] Amen to open her eyes unless she
[1:30:09] receives the spirit of God she will go
[1:30:12] on substituting program for power and
[1:30:14] Creed for word she counts numbers for
[1:30:17] Success amen rather than to look for
[1:30:19] fruit now watch what prophet of God says
[1:30:21] he says Lord that they might be awakened
[1:30:24] out of this slump that the churches get
[1:30:26] into their spiritual mind he said
[1:30:28] they've seen so many things that it's
[1:30:30] become numb like the little boy I spoke
[1:30:32] of he said but God let the numbness
[1:30:35] leave tonight
[1:30:37] I'm not a crazy man but I just felt the
[1:30:39] Holy Ghost run right through me that's
[1:30:41] the numbness leave tonight anoint our
[1:30:43] eyes what I said listen and anoint our
[1:30:46] hearts to Believe come on church this
[1:30:48] Holy Ghost is not just throwing your
[1:30:50] eyes to see but he's got to anoint your
[1:30:52] hearts Amen to believe what your eyes
[1:30:54] are seeing listen you can have your eyes
[1:30:56] anointed and you can see and see and see
[1:30:59] but if your heart is not anointed you
[1:31:01] will never believe what your eyes are
[1:31:03] seeing but if the anointing leaves your
[1:31:05] eyes then strikes your heart you will go
[1:31:07] from seeing the message to believe in
[1:31:09] the message you will go from reading the
[1:31:11] quotes to manifesting the clothes
[1:31:13] because they are sad as anointed your
[1:31:16] eyes it's anointed come on I say old
[1:31:19] Khan brother burden I say let the Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost amen anoint for church again
[1:31:23] anoint our eyes to see and on our mouth
[1:31:26] to confess and on our heart to believe
[1:31:28] and on our hands to raise anoint our
[1:31:30] feet to stomp on the head of that
[1:31:32] defeated devil oh God anoint us again

[1:31:43] than we need new sound systems we need
[1:31:45] it more than we need new buildings we
[1:31:46] need it more listen I'd rather be under
[1:31:48] a tree with a shiny somewhere and have
[1:31:51] this Holy Ghost hot oil to burn this
[1:31:53] layout of seeing us
[1:31:56] out of my eyes oh I want to see him

[1:48:42] I remember in 2005 when my

[1:48:46] United Methodist preacher served the
[1:48:48] United Memphis Church Faithfully for
[1:48:49] years
[1:48:50] first service he ever goes to in the
[1:48:53] message 2005. brother Eddie best school

[1:48:57] grandmother had invited him to come he
[1:48:59] comes with us we go to church and out of
[1:49:01] all the servants Brothers hope that
[1:49:03] brother mystical could have preached on
[1:49:04] he preaches a sermon called a holy
[1:49:06] resourceful Rich Nation
[1:49:09] and in that sermon he says now there is
[1:49:11] a mother and it's the Roman
[1:49:13] Catholic church and he said now she's
[1:49:15] got daughters and he said those are
[1:49:17] prostitute daughters he said they're
[1:49:19] hirlets he set their denominations he
[1:49:22] said their Baptist Methodist
[1:49:23] Presbyterian he goes thumb and out of
[1:49:26] all the heart that he could have focused
[1:49:28] on he focused on the one called the
[1:49:30] Methodist Church
[1:49:31] and said look how far they've come from
[1:49:34] John Wesley look how far they've come
[1:49:36] and he said like this he said now the
[1:49:38] pope just recently died and he said when
[1:49:41] he died he said your president went and
[1:49:44] knelt down by the Polk's body line and
[1:49:46] state he said when he knelt down by his
[1:49:48] body he said a prophet said the time
[1:49:51] would come that there would be an act
[1:49:52] committed that would lead the world back
[1:49:55] under amen a Roman Catholicism in person
[1:49:57] I don't have time to preach it but I'll
[1:49:59] say this look at your government look at
[1:50:00] your Supreme Court look at your white
[1:50:02] house it's Catholic from through and
[1:50:04] through come on Amen and brother bisco

[1:50:09] was the act that let him in he said but
[1:50:11] unto you whose names are on the Lamb's
[1:50:13] Book of Life you will never bow and need
[1:50:16] to this system you will never be
[1:50:18] abounded you will never stay in this if

[1:50:45] our names off the roll and my granddaddy

[1:58:23] I don't know
[1:58:25] I hear these things
[1:58:26] but I just don't know if they're for me
[1:58:30] well you remind me of an eagle that
[1:58:32] brother remember saw in the Cincinnati
[1:58:33] Zoo
[1:58:35] he said that eagle was caged in a
[1:58:37] horrible condition
[1:58:39] he said his Beak was about broke his
[1:58:41] head was bloody
[1:58:45] remember he said that thing would go
[1:58:47] over in the corner he said and take them
[1:58:48] little wings that had been soaked Bound
[1:58:50] for years and try to flop him he said he
[1:58:52] would fly said sister Vicki he gets so
[1:58:54] high hit his head come right back down
[1:58:56] remember said I watched him he turn and
[1:58:58] just walk right back over there and sit
[1:59:00] down he said I looked that and I thought
[1:59:02] you know what some wise achievement a
[1:59:04] man had put him in a cage
[1:59:09] what put him in that cage brother Harold
[1:59:12] was a wise achievement of some man put
[1:59:15] him in a cage that's the same word
[1:59:17] brother Branham uses to put you in an
[1:59:19] astronaut age as an achievement yeah
[1:59:22] yeah the same word to bind an eagle in a
[1:59:25] cage is the same word god used to profit
[1:59:27] to speak over you to release you from a
[1:59:30] cage and put you in the heavilies
[1:59:33] Robertson I'll watch that for a few
[1:59:35] minutes and he said I saw a zookeeper
[1:59:36] walk by he said brother Jeff I stopped
[1:59:39] the guy and I said sir I'll give you a
[1:59:41] hundred dollars to release this Eagle he
[1:59:43] said but I got to think and that was a
[1:59:45] sad sight but brother when I see men and
[1:59:47] women who were born to be Sons and
[1:59:49] Daughters of God and their case their
[1:59:51] old cage the nomination Theology and
[1:59:53] they say the days of Miracles has passed
[1:59:55] they say that to keep you away from the
[1:59:57] real thing of God he said walking around
[1:59:59] out here trying to satisfy that blessed
[2:00:02] hunger that God put in you to first
[2:00:03] after him and satisfied with wearing
[2:00:05] shorts and drinking and joining churches
[2:00:07] and all the Creeds and things that's the
[2:00:09] saddest side I ever seen listen you were
[2:00:12] born to be a man and women of God to

[2:00:18] unknown
