[32:49] music that we'll have if you want to be
[32:51] seated
[32:53] we've we've been through a rough trial
[32:56] and a hard time but God knows how to
[33:00] bring us out the way that it should be
[33:01] and to make things the way that they
[33:03] should be and so we thank God for what
[33:06] he's done I've seen God working and I
[33:09] wanted to say thanks to brother Danny
[33:11] and by the mark and their leadership in
[33:14] the church during a time when they
[33:16] didn't expect to have to do that so I
[33:18] wanted to say thanks for that and then
[33:20] also to do each one of the two brother
[33:29] David who does such a wonderful job here
[33:33] leading the sit the services and also
[33:36] serves as a trustee and about the bill
[33:37] white camp thank you for giving me the
[33:39] opportunity if you all and I know
[33:42] brother Danny early on felt like it was
[33:43] the will of the Lord and and I felt that
[33:45] way as well after a while and it seems
[33:50] like the Lord has worked it out for us
[33:52] but this is just the beginning we've got
[33:54] a lot of work to do and and we're going
[33:57] to continue on until the coming of the
[34:00] Lord that that's what we're looking for
[34:01] that's what we're striving for we want
[34:04] to be ready when he comes and we want to
[34:06] have a church that's solid and and ready
[34:10] and just approximates exactly the kind
[34:13] of church that he would want on the
[34:14] earth when he comes but thank you and I
[34:17] wanted to say thank you as well to the
[34:19] congregation you've been so kind to us
[34:22] good to see by the fill back this
[34:23] morning and and each one of you you've
[34:25] been kind to us and we've been through
[34:28] this coronavirus epidemic and we've been
[34:31] through not being able to meet together
[34:33] like we should but you have you have
[34:37] been exemplary in your Christian duty
[34:40] during this time and I want to thank you
[34:42] for that and if there's a plausible
[34:46] for for the fact that you've stuck with
[34:48] it you wanted to have a church and as
[34:50] long as you have a desire to have a
[34:52] church here and for there to be a body
[34:54] God will send you men to preach and a
[34:56] pastor and other ministry to do that and
[34:58] so we're thankful for that today and so
[35:00] I'm honored to be your pastor and I
[35:03] trust that God will always keep me where
[35:05] I should be and and help me to do the
[35:08] things that I should do because there's
[35:11] nothing greater than holding the
[35:12] purchase of God's blood in your hands
[35:15] and that's what I'm doing this morning
[35:17] what I speak to you is important and the
[35:21] way I treat you is important and I want
[35:23] to continue to be that I want to thank
[35:25] like I said each one of you and also the
[35:27] ministers that are here in the church by
[35:28] Stewart brother Alan thank you for
[35:30] sticking with us and and you're a part
[35:33] of this I want you to feel apart as much
[35:35] as you can be we'll be here in the area
[35:39] very soon we'll be moving into the area
[35:41] and so if you need anything I'm here
[35:44] that's what I'm here for us what I do
[35:46] and so if you have any need at all in
[35:49] physical or spiritual whatever that it
[35:52] is you just want me to pray for you you
[35:54] want somebody to talk to that's what I'm
[35:56] here for
[35:56] I'm available 24 hours a day if I don't
[35:59] if you don't get me right away I'll get
[36:01] back with you in and so that's we're
[36:04] here to care for you and in this church
[36:06] is about you and and we want to continue
[36:09] to do that I thank you as well to those
[36:11] of you that have come that are new here
[36:13] to the church and we pray that God will
[36:15] continue to bless you and there will
[36:17] continue to be growth and I'm not
[36:19] looking just at numbers but I'm looking
[36:22] at growth in our spiritual lives we want
[36:24] to see God formed inside of us we want
[36:27] to see ourselves we want to learn to
[36:29] love one another like we ought to and
[36:31] and then I'm including myself in that
[36:34] and and to treat one another right we
[36:36] want to learn to be real Christians so
[36:38] that the people in this area could say
[36:40] if there's we may not agree with them
[36:42] but if there's any real Christians in
[36:43] the world it's right there at the Word
[36:45] of Life Tabernacle it's not what you
[36:46] want this morning god bless you thank
[36:49] you for all you do and let's stand
[36:51] together you'll find that I don't change
[36:56] much for better or worse this is what
[37:00] I am and what you see is what you get
[37:01] and so we're just going to continue to
[37:05] preach the word of the Lord and if all
[37:07] else fails preach the word amen that's
[37:10] what we want to do amen also at the end
[37:13] of the service with Alan if you just
[37:15] bring paxton up at the end of the
[37:16] service a lot of prayer for him and we
[37:20] believe God is a healer don't we amen
[37:22] I want to title this this morning and
[37:24] we'll just talk about it I felt it was
[37:26] needful God's perfect plan for the
[37:29] church and we'll be reading from
[37:31] Colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 also
[37:34] from Matthew 16 and 18 I failed to
[37:36] mention my wife this morning and my kids
[37:40] I want to thank them for sticking with
[37:42] me through all of this melody did tell
[37:44] me that she wouldn't vote for me if she
[37:46] could vote so we made sure that she
[37:51] didn't get a slip of paper to be able to
[37:53] vote she said she would vote for brother
[37:57] Ivy's so whatever that's worth so we
[38:01] have to make sure she doesn't get Pross
[38:02] cited somewhere else but but we think
[38:06] the Lord I think the Lord for my family
[38:08] they've been really well God gave me the
[38:11] best and I'm sure you feel that way as
[38:14] with your family as well Colossians
[38:15] chapter 1 and verse 18 and he is the
[38:19] head of the body the church who is the
[38:22] beginning and we're seeing a beginning
[38:25] here this morning but he is the
[38:26] beginning of the church is the beginning
[38:29] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[38:32] things he might have the preeminence
[38:35] Matthew 16 and 18 and I say also unto
[38:42] thee that thou art Peter and upon this
[38:45] rock I will build my church and we know
[38:47] that spiritual revelation who Christ is
[38:50] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[38:54] against it I think we can say Amen this
[38:57] morning the gates of Hell shall not
[39:00] prevail against the true Church of the
[39:02] Living God let's bow our heads together
[39:04] Heavenly Father were so grateful to be
[39:08] able to be here this morning Lord with
[39:12] those
[39:13] some that have been here for many years
[39:15] and they've tried to make this their
[39:19] church and have a place where they their
[39:21] families could worship and some have
[39:23] went on to be with the Lord Lord and
[39:26] things happen in life we know that and
[39:28] people change the faces behind the
[39:31] pulpit and the people in the pews and
[39:34] the officers of the church change with
[39:36] time because none of us can continue
[39:38] forever but Lord is those that have went
[39:41] on and those that have continued Lord
[39:43] have been faithful and we thank you for
[39:46] that this morning Lord but they've
[39:48] wanted to to see a church continuing and
[39:52] therefore there to be some body of
[39:55] believers here that would just really
[39:56] worship you and believe your word and is
[39:59] pureness and in in its fullness and Lord
[40:03] we believe that we are that we have to
[40:06] be that and and so we thank you for what
[40:08] you've done for us thank you for this
[40:12] congregation of people Lord that Lord
[40:15] that choose to lay aside a part of their
[40:17] life to come and hear the word it's not
[40:19] a small thing I pray you would bless
[40:21] them abundantly lord I pray you to bless
[40:24] him physically and spiritually and in
[40:26] every area of their lives
[40:27] father that you they will know that
[40:30] you've been working in their lives we
[40:33] want you to have control of the church
[40:35] we want you to be in charge Lord as your
[40:39] prophet taught us that the Holy Spirit
[40:42] is the leader of the church and so we
[40:44] asked you to lead us father as we
[40:46] believe that you've already done through
[40:48] this time we ask you to move Lord in in
[40:51] a mighty way and just be present with us
[40:54] Lord every service every time we're
[40:57] together and we'll worship you and give
[40:59] you the praise and the glory in the
[41:00] honor in Jesus name Amen amen god bless
[41:05] you you could be seated this morning
[41:10] all of God's plans are perfect you know
[41:16] you get the vision of someone building
[41:17] something by the JT and and they're
[41:19] sitting there and they make a plan and
[41:21] they tear up the paper and throw it in
[41:23] the wastebasket and start over again or
[41:26] erase it on the computer or whatever
[41:28] that they might do but God never does
[41:30] that when God builds something the plans
[41:34] for it are right and we may not execute
[41:38] it correctly but God's plans are right
[41:41] his plan for the church is is right and
[41:45] we can have confidence in that and it
[41:48] governs our lives and we believe that
[41:50] the Word of God governs every area of
[41:53] our life that that it actually our lives
[41:57] conform to that word and we have to have
[42:00] confidence in that word to believe that
[42:02] so we believe that the Word of God is
[42:04] the ultimate rule in the church we
[42:07] believe it's not only that is the
[42:09] ultimate rule in our lives this is the
[42:11] Word of God if we can't find it in the
[42:13] word then we don't need it and so but
[42:17] God made a plan and he has a plan for
[42:20] the church and that plan was perfect
[42:22] we may not execute it perfectly but the
[42:24] plan is perfect a deacon may not always
[42:28] be a perfect deacon but God's plan for
[42:30] the church is perfect a pastor may not
[42:32] always be perfect but God's plan is
[42:34] perfect and even in our own lives but
[42:36] the random tells us that even the
[42:39] permissive will of God he uses that to
[42:41] glorify His perfect will now that's hard
[42:44] for me to even uneven comprehend but we
[42:46] know that it's true because we've seen
[42:48] it Experion chily in our own lives we've
[42:51] seen that God actually will go through a
[42:54] time when we're not sure what the will
[42:55] of God is and we come out on the end and
[42:57] realize that God used that time and you
[43:00] can look back into your own life and see
[43:02] there were moments and there were times
[43:03] when things were shaky and things were
[43:06] where your footing was unsure and you
[43:08] were unable to really grab ahold of
[43:11] something but God used that he wanted to
[43:13] make you search he wanted to make you
[43:15] look he wanted and so you'll use that
[43:17] like a tree when the wind blows and the
[43:20] storms come by and the tree is shaking
[43:22] the wind is actually making the roots go
[43:25] down stronger and God's plan is always
[43:31] perfect or he wouldn't be God now the
[43:37] church when we call it that and a lot of
[43:39] times the message we get kind of
[43:40] sidetracked by that because we said well
[43:42] we're not the church were the bride well
[43:44] the bride is the true church right and
[43:48] so God's church is called by different
[43:50] names in the scripture in extra 247 he's
[43:52] called the church in Revelations 21 9
[43:55] the bride in Revelations 19 7 the Lambs
[43:58] wife in Hebrews 12 23 the General
[44:02] Assembly in first corinthians 12 27 the
[44:05] body of christ and you'll find each of
[44:08] these in other places as well and Luke
[44:10] 12:32 he says the little flock so we
[44:14] could call you a flock or a body or a
[44:16] church or an assembly or the bride and
[44:19] it's the same thing right but but when
[44:22] we talk about the church it kind of
[44:24] gives us an idea of we talk more so
[44:27] about the body of Christ as a whole
[44:29] being the bride because we realize we're
[44:32] not all of the bride but here we are a
[44:34] local church or a local called out a
[44:37] local part of the of the body of that
[44:40] body of Christ of that universal body of
[44:42] Christ and so in the New Testament the
[44:47] word ecclesia is used for church it's
[44:49] 116 times in the New Testament it's the
[44:52] called out it's the summoned it was
[44:54] originally an assembly of citizens and
[44:56] it's used Jesus uses it to differentiate
[44:59] between the entire congregation of
[45:02] Israel and his disciples they were the
[45:04] church that called out right so he says
[45:07] upon this rock I'll build my called out
[45:10] my church and the gates of Hell will not
[45:13] prevail against it and so brother
[45:16] Branham makes this different
[45:18] differentiation though because the
[45:20] church if you go to the world they think
[45:22] of the church as being the Catholic
[45:24] Church or the universal Church everybody
[45:26] that calls themselves a Christian
[45:28] brother branham says that he said he
[45:31] said that much of the revelation is
[45:33] totally misunderstood because we have
[45:35] not formally
[45:36] known that the church spoken of and
[45:38] spoken to in this book does not refer to
[45:40] the pure ecclesia the elect
[45:43] so that's speaking of the church in
[45:44] Revelations in the Book of Revelations
[45:46] he said but the the body of Christ the
[45:49] bride but it speaks to the entire body
[45:51] of people who are called Christians so
[45:54] he speaks to the church when he speaks
[45:55] it says you're lukewarm and so I'll spew
[45:58] you out of my mouth he's not talking
[45:59] just to the bride he's talking to the
[46:03] church not what we would call the church
[46:05] nominal but now the true church is the
[46:08] ecclesia or the elect the body of Christ
[46:11] he says when so in the revelation when
[46:15] it speaks to the church it speaks of the
[46:16] entire body of people who are called
[46:18] Christians whether they're true or
[46:20] nominal so he says says all Israel is
[46:23] not Israel so all Christians are not
[46:24] Christians and that's just true and we
[46:29] have to be careful that we don't allow
[46:31] ourselves to be disappointed because
[46:33] somebody calls himself a Christian and
[46:35] they're not or somebody calls themselves
[46:37] a preacher and they're not somebody
[46:39] calls themselves a pastor or whatever
[46:41] that it might be and they're not we we
[46:43] have to be careful that because people
[46:45] can say what they're anything but it's
[46:48] the fruit that proves what you are the
[46:51] fruit that comes out of your life and so
[46:53] and so he said it's all Israel it's not
[46:55] Israel for all Christians are not
[46:56] Christians thus we learned that the
[46:58] church is made up of two vines the true
[47:01] and the false
[47:02] so and again brother Brennaman in the
[47:06] Raps tree said the very word church
[47:08] means called out earth as Moses called a
[47:10] nation out of a nation the Holy Spirit
[47:12] is calling a bride out of a church he
[47:15] said a church out of a church a church
[47:17] out of a church amen he said members
[47:21] from every denomination making up a
[47:23] bride a bride tree says in the tape a
[47:26] bride tree a bride coming out at Hall
[47:28] and he said that's the one that the
[47:31] bride tree is the bride he said rather
[47:33] is the one that's going to be in the
[47:34] rapture that alone nothing but the bride
[47:38] know what you want to be a part of the
[47:40] Hat nothing but the bride he said the
[47:42] elected ones for known by God from the
[47:45] beginning the father's spiritual genes
[47:48] so we want to have a place
[47:50] just got a place so make sense they've
[47:53] got buildings they've got program
[47:54] they've got we want a place for the
[47:56] bride we want a place for the bride and
[47:59] sure there will be others to come and go
[48:01] but we want the bride to be to have a
[48:03] home to be able to come and hear the
[48:06] word of God and be washed by the water
[48:07] of the word we want to bride that
[48:09] that'll be able to participate in a
[48:12] church that looks like that early church
[48:14] did right and so in order to do that
[48:17] we've got to have we've got to have a
[48:20] church that is called out or a bribe and
[48:22] we've got to be able to do what it takes
[48:25] to have that that's what we've done
[48:28] today it's what you've done today now
[48:31] and the registers of churches the type
[48:35] of the moon he said we're supposed to
[48:38] reflect the light during the absence of
[48:40] the Son of God because we're sons and
[48:43] daughters of God we were Lester line as
[48:46] long as we can see that moon reflects
[48:47] the same kind of light the Sun does he
[48:49] says oh it isn't the people it's God in
[48:52] the people and so how should we treat
[48:55] one another then it's God in the people
[48:59] right so we don't treat the people
[49:02] haphazardly whether we're in the pulpit
[49:05] or in the pew because it's gone in flash
[49:08] God sitting on a piece of God veiling
[49:10] himself in flesh so brother Branham says
[49:14] just like the moon is a shadow of the
[49:16] Sun it serves in the absence of the Sun
[49:18] just like the church is to serve in the
[49:20] absence of the sson of God in the
[49:23] absence of the Sun the lesser light the
[49:25] church the believers serve God and give
[49:28] light in the absence of the Sun but when
[49:32] the Sun rises you don't see the moon no
[49:35] more because it's gone down I'll be glad
[49:39] when we don't have to have church no
[49:40] more in the way that we do now there's
[49:43] coming a day we won't necessarily have
[49:45] to do the things that we do
[49:46] he said do these same speaking of
[49:48] communion he said do this until I come
[49:50] they don't come and day we won't have to
[49:52] do it anymore
[49:53] there's coming a day when we when we'll
[49:55] all be together anyway we'll be able to
[49:57] travel like a thought but for now we're
[50:00] living under God's
[50:01] provision for this age and this is God's
[50:04] perfect plan for now because we're the
[50:07] reflection of that but he said there's
[50:08] coming a time he said when the Sun rises
[50:10] you don't see the moon no more cuz it's
[50:12] gone down it doesn't need its light
[50:14] anymore because it only gets its light
[50:15] secondarily off the Sun he said now like
[50:18] husband and wife the Sun and Moon is the
[50:20] church and Christ so the church we know
[50:24] it's necessary until the bridegroom is
[50:26] present in a physical body right so it's
[50:30] necessary people say well I could go to
[50:33] church or not it doesn't matter the
[50:34] church is necessary until the bridegroom
[50:38] comes so God's perfect plan for the
[50:42] church is to have a perfect church a
[50:45] perfect Church and that would be a
[50:47] church that operates according to his
[50:49] plan that doesn't mean that the people
[50:51] will be perfect right or the ministers
[50:54] will be perfect or that the song leader
[50:57] or the Deacons for the officers will be
[50:59] perfect but it means that it'll operate
[51:01] according to that early pattern because
[51:04] that was a perfect church and then also
[51:06] a church that is protected because we
[51:09] live at a time when Satan goes about
[51:11] trying to devour those that are gods and
[51:13] so we want a church that's protected
[51:15] from the things that are out here in the
[51:17] world trying to destroy it because
[51:19] brother Mannis said that showed the
[51:20] gates of hell would be against the
[51:21] church because he said they won't
[51:24] prevail against it they'll be against it
[51:27] but they won't prevail against it they
[51:29] won't be able to overcome it and then he
[51:31] said we also want a powerful church or
[51:33] that's what God wants to see that's his
[51:35] plan for the church is to have a church
[51:38] with power in it amen so brother Branham
[51:42] says it started out as the original as
[51:45] Jesus said the Word of God is a seed
[51:46] that a sword sowed and he was the sower
[51:48] the seed was the word and any seed that
[51:51] abides alone never does nothing it's got
[51:53] to fall into the ground to bring forth
[51:55] its production again and this seed that
[51:58] perfect church fell to the ground at
[52:01] Nicaea
[52:02] he said when she became a denomination
[52:05] but if it fell into the ground it's got
[52:08] to come back up again and begin to come
[52:11] up we know with Luther and Wesley and
[52:13] then now we're
[52:14] reaching the time when the seed has come
[52:17] back into its right form again so
[52:21] Matthew and I'll go on and read that he
[52:25] said notice any seed that abideth alone
[52:26] it does nothing it's got to fall on the
[52:28] ground to bring forth reproduction again
[52:29] and this seed that perfect church fell
[52:33] to the ground that perfect church it was
[52:36] a perfect church and they had problems
[52:41] just like we have sure they did they had
[52:44] problems in that corinthian church that
[52:46] were crazy but even the ephesian church
[52:48] and the Galatian Church and different
[52:50] ones they all had problems Paul has to
[52:53] speak to them and tell them how to treat
[52:54] their wives how to treat their children
[52:56] how to treat their servants and all
[52:58] kinds of different things that Paul has
[53:00] to speak to them why but they were God's
[53:02] perfect church why because they were
[53:04] operating under that that administration
[53:07] that God had set out and God said this
[53:09] is the way I want you to run the church
[53:10] and that's the way that they did it and
[53:12] Paul corrected it into the way that it
[53:15] should be so now in Matthew 16 and 19 he
[53:18] said I will give unto thee the keys of
[53:20] the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou
[53:22] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[53:24] heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on
[53:26] earth shall be loosed in heaven and when
[53:29] they was asked about it the Apostle
[53:31] Peter who was given the keys to the
[53:32] kingdom
[53:32] brother Brown said they said what could
[53:34] we do to receive this and he said repent
[53:36] every one of you and I know I feel like
[53:39] I'm hurrying this morning because I know
[53:41] I've got a lot on my plate and I want to
[53:42] let you out of here today you know that
[53:45] I'm not that long-winded you've seen
[53:46] that by now but only in spurts some are
[53:52] I'm gonna try to not let this be one of
[53:54] those first this morning but he said he
[53:58] said I took those so-called believers to
[54:00] repent of their unbelief repent and be
[54:02] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[54:03] the remission of your sins you shall
[54:05] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[54:07] the promises unto you and to your
[54:09] children and to them that he said that
[54:12] are in Klamath Falls Oregon and I
[54:14] believe we could it wouldn't be out of
[54:15] the way to put Hardy Arkansas there or
[54:18] wherever you're from to them in Klamath
[54:22] Falls Oregon even as many as the Lord
[54:24] our God shall call the promise is to us
[54:27] and when someone tries
[54:28] to shut that door and say that was for
[54:30] another age the Holy Spirit isn't for
[54:33] this age they deny the word of the
[54:35] Living God
[54:36] now think about that the way the Holy
[54:39] Spirit operates in the local church
[54:41] given the keys to the kingdom whatever
[54:44] you bind on earth will be bound in
[54:46] heaven you realize what a powerful thing
[54:48] this is you realize what you're a part
[54:51] of you are God's hands you're God's
[54:55] hands God had needed a pair of hands he
[54:57] come down made himself a body and his
[54:59] hands touch people and we went through
[55:01] the other day how that every time he
[55:03] touched him they were made all just says
[55:05] he touched him and the band the blind
[55:07] were were able to see touch sniffing and
[55:09] the leper became cleansed and he touched
[55:11] him and they were they were cleaned from
[55:13] their iniquity you say they touched him
[55:15] but what where's his body today where's
[55:17] his body
[55:18] who's gonna touch him it's gonna be yes
[55:21] it's got to be s where his body and so
[55:25] it's a powerful thing he says when when
[55:28] somebody tries to tell you that was for
[55:29] another age the Holy Spirit isn't for
[55:31] this age they deny the word of the
[55:33] Living God so in if a Peter speaks this
[55:39] and given the keys to the kingdom he had
[55:41] the right to speak that and then in acts
[55:44] 2:41 it says then they that gladly
[55:46] received his word were baptized in the
[55:49] same day there were added unto them
[55:51] about 3,000 souls and we see the
[55:54] formation of that perfect church the
[55:58] Bible in acts 2:46 says they continuing
[56:01] daily with one Accord in the temple
[56:03] breaking bread from house to house did
[56:06] eat their meat with gladness and
[56:07] singleness of heart or having a purpose
[56:11] praising God and having favor with all
[56:14] the people so that tells me that the
[56:17] early church was not even though they
[56:19] were rejected by the authorities they
[56:22] didn't have to be a people who were just
[56:24] some little cult out in the woods
[56:26] somewhere but they praise God and had
[56:29] favor with all the people because there
[56:31] was just something about a Christian hey
[56:34] bet it makes you want to be around them
[56:36] that's right have favor with all the
[56:39] people and the Lord added to the church
[56:41] daily
[56:42] such as should be saved that's God's
[56:45] plan for the church my brother Brennan
[56:48] says he give Peter the keys to the
[56:50] kingdom what was bound at Pentecost is
[56:52] bound forever that's the reason the
[56:55] bride he's had coming to reprove you
[56:57] he said the second time there has to be
[57:00] a church called out of the latter-day
[57:02] like there was in the first day hey men
[57:06] then what kind of a church would it be a
[57:08] perfect Church or one that perfectly
[57:10] operates under that same administration
[57:13] now he he said there has to be one in
[57:18] the last stage of destruction wasn't the
[57:19] first day now as time went on you begin
[57:22] to see in order to this church in acts 6
[57:24] and 1 it says in those days when the
[57:26] number of the disciples was multiplied
[57:28] there arose a murmuring of the Grecians
[57:29] against the Hebrews because their widows
[57:32] were neglected in the daily ministration
[57:33] well that don't sound like too perfect
[57:36] of a church there was racial strife
[57:40] there was racial strife because the
[57:44] Hebrews didn't want to share with the
[57:47] Greeks and the Greeks probably didn't
[57:49] want to share with the Hebrews because
[57:52] they looked at each other as I was
[57:54] hearing a man not long ago and he told
[57:56] me that or he was telling this that
[57:59] there was their strife even in the
[58:01] country I ran you think about a country
[58:03] like that you think well they're Muslim
[58:04] but he said the ones that in the city
[58:06] have strife against those in the country
[58:08] and the Sunnis have strife with the
[58:11] Shiites and and the different tribes
[58:13] have strife with one another and just
[58:15] depending on where you're from
[58:16] he said the ones in the north of the
[58:17] country have a strife with those in the
[58:19] south part of the country well that
[58:21] sounds familiar doesn't it and so if
[58:24] we're not careful in that you go into a
[58:26] lot of those countries it's tribalism
[58:27] and it still exists and we've not had as
[58:30] much of that here because we were all or
[58:33] most of us came here not we weren't from
[58:35] here and so we came here and so people
[58:38] were able to get together and under our
[58:40] system of government have some harmony
[58:41] but now you're beginning to see there's
[58:43] still tribalism there's still strife but
[58:46] God had a plan for the church to even
[58:48] overcome that right where we didn't have
[58:52] to look at the color of each other's
[58:53] skin or where we were from or what our
[58:55] culture was but that we could be treated
[58:58] fairly and so in this order as he begins
[59:01] to set it out in acts 6 & 7 the twelve
[59:03] called the multitude of the disciples
[59:04] unto them and said it's not reason that
[59:07] we should leave the Word of God and
[59:08] serve tables so in other words the
[59:10] preacher can't do everything right
[59:13] there's things that you have to have
[59:14] other officers in the church to be able
[59:16] to do that it's not reason for us to
[59:18] leave the word and serve tables
[59:19] wherefore brethren look out among you
[59:22] seven men of honest report full the Holy
[59:24] Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint
[59:26] over this business we will give
[59:29] ourselves continually to prayer and to
[59:31] the Ministry of the word and you might
[59:33] say and and that was the first deacons
[59:35] down you might say well what did they
[59:37] have to be full the Holy Ghost for to
[59:39] serve tables
[59:40] well sometimes you need the Holy Ghost
[59:42] you really need the Holy Ghost to serve
[59:44] tables if you're gonna make peace
[59:47] between the Jews and the Greeks you've
[59:49] got work to do
[59:50] so I thank God for our brothers because
[59:53] that's part of what they do right that
[59:55] makes sure that people are served
[59:56] equally and and make sure that the
[59:58] church is comfortable for everybody and
[1:00:00] and so but he said we will give
[1:00:02] ourselves continually to prayer into the
[1:00:04] Ministry of the word so we find then
[1:00:07] that that was the pattern that was God's
[1:00:09] perfect church and we could go into many
[1:00:12] other areas of that church they met on
[1:00:15] the first day of the week there was
[1:00:16] there was certain things that they did
[1:00:18] and how they collected the money and all
[1:00:20] those things many things baptizing many
[1:00:23] things that we still do today and thank
[1:00:26] God that we've had a message it restored
[1:00:27] us back to those things well we find
[1:00:30] that that church wasn't just in God's
[1:00:33] pattern but it was protected by God and
[1:00:36] the way that he protected it God used a
[1:00:38] certain way of protecting that I know
[1:00:40] you've heard this before but just bear
[1:00:41] with me I'm going somewhere this morning
[1:00:43] he says in officiants 4:11 he gave some
[1:00:46] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[1:00:48] some pastors and teachers for the
[1:00:50] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:00:52] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:00:55] body of Christ brother Branham very
[1:00:58] clearly says that that perfecting is not
[1:01:00] sinless perfecting it's not making it
[1:01:02] perfect or sinless because he said we
[1:01:05] get fellowship one with another here at
[1:01:06] the church but the perfecting comes
[1:01:08] between us and go
[1:01:11] now he said the blood of Christ is what
[1:01:14] perfects us in the Holy Spirit so what
[1:01:16] kind of perfecting are we talking about
[1:01:18] was talking most of the time in the New
[1:01:20] Testament he talks about being perfect
[1:01:21] he's talking about being mature but here
[1:01:24] it that's also speaking of refitting
[1:01:26] something or it's the idea of taking a
[1:01:29] ship and they take all the stuff out of
[1:01:32] it kind of like you do if you've been on
[1:01:33] a trip with kids you know if you're
[1:01:35] going back-to-back vacation or
[1:01:37] back-to-back trips and we've done that a
[1:01:38] lot where you are going one weekend and
[1:01:42] you just work all week and then you're
[1:01:43] gone the next weekend somewhere else and
[1:01:45] so with us preaching but if you're just
[1:01:47] traveling or whatever the kids fill the
[1:01:49] car up with junk right that's that's the
[1:01:53] maybe some of you don't let your kids
[1:01:55] fill the car up with junk but but mine
[1:01:57] do and and so they put all their all the
[1:01:59] stuff in the car and so then somebody
[1:02:02] has to go stuff out of the car and the
[1:02:04] idea is you've got to put stuff back in
[1:02:06] there so you can go again and what they
[1:02:09] would they would do the same thing with
[1:02:10] a ship a ship would come in they'd
[1:02:11] unload the cargo going clean everything
[1:02:13] they'd go in and and fix everything that
[1:02:15] was broken and they'd come back in and
[1:02:17] put in all the necessary things that the
[1:02:19] ship needed and so it's equipping or
[1:02:22] refitting and that's what he's saying
[1:02:25] for the perfecting is is for the
[1:02:27] equipping of the church but also the
[1:02:29] word means to set a bone so we could say
[1:02:32] it's it's for the healing of the church
[1:02:35] for the healing of the church or you
[1:02:38] know and that's so much the the end
[1:02:41] result because ministry is a means to an
[1:02:44] end
[1:02:45] ministry is not in a bit in and of
[1:02:48] itself the end just because you hear a
[1:02:51] preacher you are a preacher doesn't mean
[1:02:53] that you've achieved what God wants you
[1:02:55] to achieve but at the end result is a
[1:02:59] church that's healthy a body that's
[1:03:02] healthy and so in order to have a
[1:03:04] healthy body it has to be ministered to
[1:03:08] in order for you to have a healthy body
[1:03:11] you go to the doctor every now and then
[1:03:13] in order for you to have a healthy body
[1:03:15] you go see the dentist you brush your
[1:03:16] teeth
[1:03:16] you're ministering to the body so in
[1:03:19] order for the body to be healthy the
[1:03:21] bone has to be set No
[1:03:23] now I can't make it come back together
[1:03:24] but you can set the bone right just like
[1:03:28] a doctor can't make it can't heal it but
[1:03:29] it can set the bone and that's what a
[1:03:31] ministry does that's what the fivefold
[1:03:35] ministry in its entirety does you're
[1:03:36] setting the bone you're presenting the
[1:03:38] word placing the word in its proper
[1:03:40] context in its proper place for the age
[1:03:42] and then God does two healing Ephesians
[1:03:48] 4:13 says till we all come in the unity
[1:03:50] of the faith the knowledge of the Son of
[1:03:53] God into a perfect man and to the
[1:03:55] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:03:57] of Christ now there's been some question
[1:04:02] about that because there's a doctrine
[1:04:04] called cessation and the Church of
[1:04:06] Christ believe it and some message
[1:04:08] people believe it that it still it still
[1:04:12] the church comes in unity and I said
[1:04:14] well now we have the message of the
[1:04:15] churches in unity well depends I guess
[1:04:19] but and I do believe we have unity more
[1:04:23] unity than we've ever had in that sense
[1:04:25] of doctrinal unity and we know what the
[1:04:28] word is but brother BAM tells us that he
[1:04:31] said he said some in the church teachers
[1:04:33] apostles prophets gifts of healing
[1:04:35] working of miracles all those things are
[1:04:36] sent in the church he said do you
[1:04:38] believe that so and what he's saying is
[1:04:41] there in the scriptures God put them in
[1:04:43] there and not only are they scriptural
[1:04:46] but we see them operate right you see
[1:04:49] them operate you you've benefited from
[1:04:51] the ministry of a pastor you benefit
[1:04:53] from the ministry of an evangelist
[1:04:54] you've you've seen that work right and
[1:04:58] so now he said all these things are said
[1:05:01] in the church he said I never did say
[1:05:04] where they'd be sent out of the church
[1:05:08] and I never did find where he said he
[1:05:12] said I never did say where they'd be
[1:05:14] sent out of the church
[1:05:15] so someone saying they're sent out of
[1:05:17] the church they're saying something
[1:05:18] different than brother Branham said
[1:05:19] because I never did say where they'd be
[1:05:21] sent out of the church he set them in
[1:05:23] the church for the perfecting of the
[1:05:25] church and to be in the church until he
[1:05:29] comes again
[1:05:31] Ephesians 4:14 this is the purpose of it
[1:05:34] that we be his forth
[1:05:36] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:05:39] and fro and carried about with every
[1:05:40] wind of doctrine so this fits again with
[1:05:43] the idea of a ship that were were
[1:05:45] grounded were anchored were refitted
[1:05:47] were able to withstand the winds that
[1:05:49] come we're anchored tossed he said no
[1:05:52] more children tossed to and fro and
[1:05:54] carried about with every wind of
[1:05:55] doctrine by the side of men cunning
[1:05:59] craftiness whereby they lie in wait to
[1:06:01] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:06:06] there's the job of a preacher that's our
[1:06:10] job of the Stuart speak the truth in
[1:06:12] love the truth is all good but we got to
[1:06:17] speak the truth in love may grow up into
[1:06:20] him in all things which is the head even
[1:06:24] Christ so the body matures into that now
[1:06:28] officials 4:16 from whom the whole body
[1:06:31] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:06:34] that which every joint supplieth so in
[1:06:37] other words what makes it work is not
[1:06:40] just the ministry but what every joint
[1:06:43] supplies every one of us are a joint if
[1:06:48] we could put it that way we're all a
[1:06:49] joint we we join with another member of
[1:06:52] the body somewhere right no Christian
[1:06:55] operates on their own they may think
[1:06:56] they do but they don't you join
[1:06:59] somewhere with another member of the
[1:07:00] body and so what happens when someone
[1:07:03] gets to a point where they they just
[1:07:06] can't get along with nobody what's
[1:07:07] happened is the same thing that happens
[1:07:09] if you need a knee replacement right and
[1:07:12] that that cartilage and all that stuff
[1:07:14] I'm not a doctor but all that what's
[1:07:15] supposed to be there it's not there
[1:07:17] anymore and so the bones are actually
[1:07:19] just rubbing against one another and it
[1:07:21] causes pain because all that what every
[1:07:25] joint supplieth all that sinew in the
[1:07:27] ball or the the muscle and all that's
[1:07:29] gone that's supposed to be there Oh
[1:07:31] church or we realize that when someone
[1:07:34] gives you grief like that it's not
[1:07:36] necessarily that they're not part of the
[1:07:37] body but the joint has just gone bad and
[1:07:41] so we need to replace the love and the
[1:07:43] kindness and and the fruits of the
[1:07:45] spirit that will enable us to to move
[1:07:47] smoothly together again
[1:07:49] right and so but he said every joint
[1:07:52] supplies something so when something is
[1:07:55] out of if we're find ourselves not where
[1:07:58] we should be and that includes then our
[1:08:00] walk with God in our prayer life if we
[1:08:02] find ourselves where we should not be it
[1:08:04] affects into our body but it's also the
[1:08:07] responsibility of the entire body to
[1:08:10] help us get back where we should be sure
[1:08:13] it's our responsibility but it's the
[1:08:14] body's responsibility it's not my
[1:08:17] responsibility to keep kicking out
[1:08:19] members of the body but it's to bring
[1:08:21] members of the body into a place where
[1:08:24] they can edify the body instead of
[1:08:26] causing pain write something every joint
[1:08:30] supplies something you may go and all
[1:08:34] you may be able to supply is cups for
[1:08:36] the fellowship hall but you supply you
[1:08:40] may just supply you may just supply in
[1:08:43] the spiritual you may supply prayer and
[1:08:44] let's see what all I do is pray well
[1:08:46] that's more than a whole lot of people
[1:08:47] can do because the Bible says the
[1:08:51] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:08:53] man availeth much so you may not be able
[1:08:57] to do anything else but just pray but if
[1:08:59] you can pray hey man that'll be more
[1:09:02] than than many other people can do so
[1:09:04] every joint supplies something every
[1:09:06] joint has a job every joint if they're
[1:09:09] not working correctly we feel it but if
[1:09:12] it's working correctly what a wonderful
[1:09:13] body of Christ that we have so we all
[1:09:18] have a responsibility to one another to
[1:09:21] work he said effectual working according
[1:09:23] to the effectual working in the measure
[1:09:24] of every part maketh increase of the
[1:09:27] body unto the edifying of itself for the
[1:09:29] building up of itself in love the body
[1:09:33] builds itself just like your body does
[1:09:37] just like your body does when there's a
[1:09:40] way if you would poke something to your
[1:09:42] skin you'd have a scar or wound your
[1:09:44] body would begin to heal itself why
[1:09:47] because if it the wound is left open and
[1:09:49] the other parts of the body don't begin
[1:09:51] to make up for that part of the body
[1:09:52] you'll die right an infection will set
[1:09:56] in and that's the way the body is now
[1:09:58] brother BAM said there's five officers
[1:10:01] elected of God God is setting
[1:10:03] Church apostles prophets teachers
[1:10:05] pastors and evangelists he said God did
[1:10:07] that man has deacons and so forth and
[1:10:10] everything else we have trustees which
[1:10:12] are not written in Scripture but brother
[1:10:14] Branham allowed trustees to be in the
[1:10:16] church for a reason because there's
[1:10:18] things that have to be taken care of
[1:10:20] with the government and there's things
[1:10:22] that have to be taken care of what the
[1:10:23] finances God has a part for that as well
[1:10:26] but it's not a necessarily a calling in
[1:10:30] the way now let me be careful with this
[1:10:32] because you can be called to do
[1:10:34] something and not be a spiritual gift in
[1:10:36] the way that a pastor or an evangelist
[1:10:38] but there could be something that you do
[1:10:39] that you're good at that's a gift if you
[1:10:44] could put it like that you could have a
[1:10:45] gift to be a trustee you're good with
[1:10:47] money or whatever that it is so good
[1:10:49] with keep of the upkeep and things like
[1:10:51] that but it doesn't necessarily mean
[1:10:53] that you are a that you have a gift like
[1:10:58] the fivefold ministry but remember the
[1:11:00] fivefold ministry is also part of the
[1:11:02] body so the the apostle needs the
[1:11:07] Prophet who needs the teacher who needs
[1:11:10] the pastor who needs the Evangelist
[1:11:14] right a pastor can't do it on his own
[1:11:17] and I've Angelus can't do it on his home
[1:11:21] a teacher can't do it on his own and I
[1:11:23] think we've made a mistake over the
[1:11:24] years by a pastor of a certain type of
[1:11:26] ministry and they'll just believe that
[1:11:28] that's all the church needs and that's
[1:11:29] not all the church needs I know it's not
[1:11:32] all the church needs I know that this
[1:11:34] church needs to hear other kinds of
[1:11:35] preaching and you've heard a lot of me
[1:11:37] lately because of the coronavirus thing
[1:11:39] but in which people have not been able
[1:11:41] to travel like they should but I believe
[1:11:42] the church needs all five of the
[1:11:44] fivefold ministry and thank God he sent
[1:11:47] a prophet in our hour thank God we have
[1:11:50] that and every one of us are under that
[1:11:52] because he's not just a prophet he was
[1:11:53] the messenger to the aged so we all
[1:11:56] operate under that so but the brown says
[1:11:59] he's set in the church apostles prophets
[1:12:00] teachers pastors and evangelists he said
[1:12:03] all that for the perfecting of the body
[1:12:04] and in this body every local body
[1:12:08] he gave nine spiritual gifts and those
[1:12:12] gifts are different kinds wisdom
[1:12:13] knowledge speaking in tongues gifts of
[1:12:15] healing
[1:12:16] interpretation of tongues and so forth
[1:12:18] nine spiritual gifts all to show his
[1:12:21] love towards the church he didn't put
[1:12:27] them in there just because he hates the
[1:12:29] church he wants to cause them problems
[1:12:31] he put them in there because he showed
[1:12:33] his love if God put a preacher in your
[1:12:35] life or a gift of healing or whatever
[1:12:37] that it is around you could put
[1:12:39] something in the church he did that to
[1:12:41] show his love toward you aren't you glad
[1:12:43] that he loves you he said that he wants
[1:12:47] you to stay in order the Great Holy
[1:12:49] Spirit Himself being the tutor of the
[1:12:54] church he said it's too bad we took a
[1:12:57] bishop until instead of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:00] to be our tutor it's too bad we took a
[1:13:04] bishop we've got some man somewhere else
[1:13:07] that tells us how the Holy Spirit should
[1:13:09] operate here in the church that's what a
[1:13:11] bishop is we don't have a man anywhere
[1:13:14] else are you hearing me Church there's
[1:13:17] got to be there's got to be leadership
[1:13:19] but we are led by the Holy Spirit and
[1:13:21] the Holy Spirit leads us locally and
[1:13:23] he's able to do that he's able to lead
[1:13:26] us locally without interference from
[1:13:28] anywhere else now we could get help we
[1:13:29] could have all there could be all kinds
[1:13:31] of benefit that we could get from other
[1:13:33] places but he we're led by the Holy
[1:13:35] Spirit and we were responsible to God
[1:13:38] our selves there's no denomination up
[1:13:43] there that if things don't work out
[1:13:45] that's just going to change out
[1:13:46] preachers there's no denomination that
[1:13:49] if things don't work out gonna change
[1:13:51] out song leaders you know or switch up
[1:13:54] the Deacons now we're responsible for
[1:13:58] what happens in the church we're
[1:13:59] responsible god help us to take our
[1:14:01] responsibilities seriously and say lord
[1:14:03] I want a church where the power of God
[1:14:05] can be there where this presence of God
[1:14:07] can where souls are added to the church
[1:14:09] where people can be baptized and come to
[1:14:11] God I want to place that's operating a
[1:14:14] body that's moving not one that's on the
[1:14:18] spiritual couch all the time are you
[1:14:22] with me now say where's this man going
[1:14:25] I'll tell you where I'm going I forgot
[1:14:27] my handkerchief
[1:14:30] the Lord was some up here
[1:14:32] it's too bad we took a bishop instead of
[1:14:35] the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit
[1:14:38] is the tutor that God gave the church to
[1:14:39] raise the church to bring it up in the
[1:14:40] admonition of God so the Holy Spirit
[1:14:43] freely sets those gifts to the church
[1:14:44] and they perfectly operate he said if
[1:14:46] you just won't get excited and try to
[1:14:49] just take what you think yourself let
[1:14:52] God do what God does if you see God
[1:14:57] moving in a certain direction you see
[1:14:59] God doing something let God do it
[1:15:01] haven't we seen God be good to us and I
[1:15:07] know we've been through a lot but we've
[1:15:09] not been through what we could have went
[1:15:10] through and that's not because of me is
[1:15:14] because of you but but because you you
[1:15:17] you got together and you had some unity
[1:15:19] to be able to let the church move
[1:15:21] through this time because there's
[1:15:22] churches that have closed their doors
[1:15:24] for good and we didn't have to because
[1:15:27] there was God had a plan that we didn't
[1:15:30] have see but God has a plan let God do
[1:15:33] what God does don't always be fighting
[1:15:35] against God but let God do if you just
[1:15:38] don't get excited
[1:15:39] try to take what you think yourself but
[1:15:40] let God do it and if you're not sure
[1:15:43] about it step back and watch it for a
[1:15:45] while yes he said judge nothing before
[1:15:48] the time let it let it go for a while
[1:15:50] see what God does because if it's God
[1:15:53] he'll do according to the scripture the
[1:15:56] things that he does it doesn't mean that
[1:15:58] it won't be hard doesn't mean that there
[1:16:01] won't be problems doesn't mean that
[1:16:02] there won't be times when we're
[1:16:03] frustrated but it means that God will do
[1:16:06] what God does and God will heal and God
[1:16:08] will save and gonna perform tore there's
[1:16:11] a local church that can operate the way
[1:16:12] it should I believe God is big enough to
[1:16:16] do that to have a local church that can
[1:16:20] operate the way should not that nobody
[1:16:21] else does everybody else might do it
[1:16:22] right but we want to do it right and we
[1:16:25] want to do it as much according to the
[1:16:26] Scriptures we can now brother Brent said
[1:16:29] God has set in the church God not the
[1:16:31] organization not the achievement of man
[1:16:34] to make bishops and so forth presbytery
[1:16:37] that in the church first apostles that's
[1:16:40] missionary secondarily prophets
[1:16:42] teachers pastors evangelists God set
[1:16:45] them in church and every bugle will blow
[1:16:48] the same I love that different
[1:16:53] administration's different callings but
[1:16:54] the word that comes is the same every
[1:16:58] bugle will blow the same the same gospel
[1:17:01] so we don't get an uncertain sound now
[1:17:04] he said God fortified his army and so
[1:17:07] this is what I was talking about for the
[1:17:08] protection for the healing for the
[1:17:09] equipping of the church God fortified
[1:17:13] his army what with himself in the form
[1:17:14] of prophets apostles teachers pastors
[1:17:17] what did he do what was God doing he
[1:17:19] said listen did you ever think what that
[1:17:20] officers of the church is it's God's
[1:17:22] dress inside dress an apostle of
[1:17:24] prophetess cr4 see before Satan ever
[1:17:27] gets to it done told it so he said it's
[1:17:29] this inside dress it's inside of that
[1:17:31] armor you see that's why I a minister
[1:17:34] can do more good or more harm than
[1:17:36] anybody else right because he's already
[1:17:41] on the inside people trust you God help
[1:17:46] us to keep that trust but he said that's
[1:17:50] the inside that's the protection you
[1:17:52] know if the guards on the wall turn on
[1:17:55] you you've got a problem that's why they
[1:17:57] always say if there's a bank job or
[1:17:59] something like that was there an inside
[1:18:00] man if there's someplace been robbed was
[1:18:03] there an Inside Man and we want to make
[1:18:05] sure we're not the inside man god help
[1:18:08] me that I would not be an injury to the
[1:18:09] church but a help to the church so it's
[1:18:13] God's dress inside dress an apostle of
[1:18:14] prophetess here fortune see before Satan
[1:18:16] ever gets to it done told it if you
[1:18:18] remove those gifts you lose that
[1:18:20] protection if those gifts do not stay
[1:18:23] with the word though again they're
[1:18:25] Wolf's will destroy the flock so brother
[1:18:29] Brown says God dressed up in his church
[1:18:31] what is it God dressed up in his church
[1:18:34] these officers is God's dress wear when
[1:18:36] you see those officers pastors teachers
[1:18:38] evangelists what is that
[1:18:39] that's God's dress where God's presence
[1:18:41] God's Spirit working through men and I
[1:18:45] know I'm reading more than I usually do
[1:18:47] but I want to get this to you this
[1:18:48] morning I want us to understand where
[1:18:50] we're going what we're doing every one
[1:18:53] of us are responsible to each one of you
[1:18:55] I'm rich
[1:18:56] possible to God but I'm also responsible
[1:18:58] to you I'm responsible to you you have a
[1:19:01] right to make me accountable right to
[1:19:05] the Word of God you don't have a right
[1:19:07] to make me accountable to just what you
[1:19:09] think but you have a right to make me
[1:19:11] accountable to the Word of God right and
[1:19:14] if I come up short something's got to be
[1:19:17] done in my life to make it right God
[1:19:21] dressed up in his church he said when
[1:19:23] you see these officers that's God's
[1:19:24] dress where God's presence God's Spirit
[1:19:26] working through man 2nd Corinthians 4
[1:19:29] and 1
[1:19:29] we'll see how Paul dealt with it he said
[1:19:33] therefore it's seeing we have this
[1:19:34] ministry seeing that we have this
[1:19:37] ministry as we have received mercy we
[1:19:39] think not
[1:19:40] and it takes mercy for any ministry it
[1:19:44] takes grace to be able to do what you do
[1:19:47] but he said as we've received mercy we
[1:19:50] think not but notice have renounced the
[1:19:53] hidden things of dishonesty and I want
[1:19:56] us to just really focus on that this
[1:19:58] morning ever announced two hidden things
[1:20:00] of dishonesty we do not preach one thing
[1:20:02] and live another our lives as ministers
[1:20:05] are an open book and that's hard to come
[1:20:08] to grips with especially if you're a
[1:20:09] private person I I am i I'm not a person
[1:20:12] who likes to if I put something on
[1:20:14] facebook I want it to be something
[1:20:15] positive you know I'm not I'm not going
[1:20:17] to tell you every every way every
[1:20:19] morning how I feel or something like
[1:20:21] that but I'm not feeling good I don't
[1:20:23] put something like that on social media
[1:20:25] I'm a much more private person but yet
[1:20:27] our lives as ministers are open books as
[1:20:30] a minister you live in a glass house and
[1:20:32] we speak of that reproachfully but it's
[1:20:33] just true it's just true you live in a
[1:20:37] glass house and so you've got to be able
[1:20:40] to live in that house in a careful way
[1:20:45] all right
[1:20:46] you lived out in the woods somewhere and
[1:20:48] you and you were walled off and you had
[1:20:50] high walls and everything you lived up
[1:20:51] there by yourself you you wouldn't have
[1:20:53] to be so careful but the way you live as
[1:20:55] a minister right you have to be careful
[1:20:57] cuz you live in that glass box and you
[1:21:00] got to be careful how you handle
[1:21:01] yourself and you'll make mistakes
[1:21:04] because people are watching and of
[1:21:06] course you make mistakes but that's when
[1:21:08] we come right back and come back to the
[1:21:09] word of god so he said we have renounced
[1:21:11] the hidden things of dishonesty
[1:21:13] we don't do thing one thing and preach
[1:21:15] another we don't get the luxury of
[1:21:17] hiding sin in our lives we pronounced
[1:21:21] those things two hidden things of
[1:21:22] dishonesty he's speaking of minister
[1:21:25] speaking of his own ministry said we do
[1:21:26] not deny the omniscience of God because
[1:21:30] if if we walk in hidden things we're
[1:21:33] denying that God knows that's what we're
[1:21:35] doing we're saying God doesn't know what
[1:21:37] I'm doing
[1:21:37] we've renounced the hidden things of
[1:21:39] dishonesty not walking in craftiness no
[1:21:43] that's in other words and he goes on to
[1:21:46] say not handling the Word of God
[1:21:47] deceitfully so in other words we do not
[1:21:50] use deceitful means to preach the gospel
[1:21:54] we don't use deceitful means to preach
[1:21:57] the gospel because when it comes to the
[1:21:59] gospel the the means are just as
[1:22:02] important as the end I hope you're with
[1:22:05] me the way we do things is just as
[1:22:08] important as our goals because Cain had
[1:22:13] good motives right he was sincere if
[1:22:17] that's all that mattered but it was the
[1:22:18] way he did it right he didn't have
[1:22:21] revelation to come God's provided way
[1:22:23] the way we do things matters Paul says
[1:22:26] we do not handle the Word of God
[1:22:28] deceitfully we don't make it fit one
[1:22:31] person not another we don't hold things
[1:22:35] or hide things back because it may be
[1:22:37] oily I don't want it to hurt somebody
[1:22:39] but we've got to declare the entire
[1:22:40] counsel of God we can't handle the Word
[1:22:43] of God deceitfully we can't handle it in
[1:22:45] such a way that people aren't sure of
[1:22:47] where they stand we can't handle it in
[1:22:50] such a way that it would you say well if
[1:22:52] I if I preach it this way people will
[1:22:54] stay closer to me and and be in the
[1:22:56] church but we have to preach the truth
[1:22:59] whether it's good for the weather it's
[1:23:01] good for our membership or not are you
[1:23:04] with me now we don't handle the Word of
[1:23:06] God deceitfully but by manifestation of
[1:23:08] the truth that's how we live and that's
[1:23:12] me and Stuart and Alan this morning rest
[1:23:15] you set your ears but when it comes to
[1:23:18] ministry how we live we commend
[1:23:20] ourselves to every man's conscience
[1:23:23] by manifestation of the truth by the way
[1:23:25] that we live and that means we'll raise
[1:23:27] families and make mistakes with them
[1:23:28] just like everybody else does but when
[1:23:30] people sees that they ought to be able
[1:23:32] to see God working in our family when
[1:23:36] people see that they ought to be able to
[1:23:37] see God working in the church god help
[1:23:39] us today
[1:23:41] now we're young men but we're I believe
[1:23:44] these are these are seasoned in ministry
[1:23:46] and able to preach you the Word of God
[1:23:48] and to live that way so that's that's as
[1:23:51] hard as I'll be on myself this morning
[1:23:53] and I'm brother Stuart mother Alan but
[1:23:58] our Paul said in acts 20:28 take heed
[1:24:01] therefore unto yourselves and all the
[1:24:04] flock and it tells us we've got to take
[1:24:06] care of our own spiritual lives as well
[1:24:08] maybe that wasn't as hard as I would
[1:24:11] take on ourselves
[1:24:12] I myself he said it to all the fog over
[1:24:14] the which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:24:15] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:24:18] which he had purchased with his own
[1:24:19] blood I know this that after my
[1:24:21] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[1:24:23] among you not sparing the flock also of
[1:24:26] your own social men arise speaking
[1:24:27] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:24:29] after them
[1:24:31] Satan would get into the structure that
[1:24:33] God created this perfect Church of God
[1:24:36] created Satan got into that in the
[1:24:38] leadership and then he made it into a
[1:24:41] Nicolay attend thing he deformed it in
[1:24:44] two nickel and his amount brother
[1:24:46] Branham said this when we see that the
[1:24:48] messengers are in his hand and let me
[1:24:50] let me take some time with that because
[1:24:52] every one of us are under something and
[1:24:54] we're responsible to something God has
[1:24:57] set in in the Book of Revelations the
[1:24:59] idea of seven messengers the stars in
[1:25:03] his hand those are in the hands of God
[1:25:06] and so those are not just ministries but
[1:25:11] those are messengers to the aged and the
[1:25:14] Lord identifies himself with those men
[1:25:16] and grants him his power and so he said
[1:25:19] it's not enough he's associated himself
[1:25:21] with the whole church he has by walking
[1:25:23] in the midst of the golden candlesticks
[1:25:25] but he has the stars in his hand
[1:25:27] he he is not enough that we see the
[1:25:29] fivefold ministry he says for in each
[1:25:32] age the church goes astray and is not
[1:25:34] just the laity but the clergy group
[1:25:35] shepherds are wrong as
[1:25:37] sheep then God brings himself on the
[1:25:39] scene as the chief shepherd in the
[1:25:41] ministries of those seven men the
[1:25:44] leaders people back to the truth and the
[1:25:46] abundant power of that truth then if God
[1:25:51] has done that that places me under the
[1:25:53] messenger of the age does that make
[1:25:56] sense that's why we will always and I
[1:25:58] will I will say this today and the way
[1:26:02] things have gone on the message it seems
[1:26:03] like over the past few years it seems
[1:26:04] like a bold statement but it's not it
[1:26:06] should be an easy statement to make
[1:26:08] always preach the message because he was
[1:26:13] the star in the hand of God I was not
[1:26:16] right so I don't I will always preach
[1:26:19] the message and brought people to the
[1:26:20] message not to a man but to the message
[1:26:26] and we should do that now
[1:26:28] he said God brings himself on the scene
[1:26:31] as the chief Shepherd in the ministries
[1:26:33] of these seven men lead his people back
[1:26:35] to the truth in the abundant power of
[1:26:36] that truth so but that was his
[1:26:39] protection if we could put it like this
[1:26:40] that was his protection to the age God
[1:26:43] protected the H by bringing a messenger
[1:26:47] to the head of the hour aren't you glad
[1:26:48] we have a messenger of the hour
[1:26:50] or we could believe anything but we have
[1:26:53] something that we believe in we have a
[1:26:54] an absolute which is the Word of God
[1:26:57] it's not who we know this it's not every
[1:26:59] word that a prophet speaks because the
[1:27:01] Prophet speaks in himself and he speaks
[1:27:03] us that the Lord but the absolute is a
[1:27:05] revealed Word of God we have an absolute
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:09] and that gives us protection because we
[1:27:12] know that this messenger was in the hand
[1:27:14] of God and brought us that absolute the
[1:27:16] way it ought to be understood in our
[1:27:18] hour so we have protection in that now
[1:27:21] we also have protection in the local
[1:27:23] church because in Titus one and five
[1:27:27] Paul speaking to Titus he says I left
[1:27:30] the in Crete that that should have said
[1:27:31] in order the things that are wanting
[1:27:33] something they lacked ordain elders in
[1:27:35] every city as I had appointed they
[1:27:38] needed somebody to stand there and be
[1:27:40] responsible to see that the word was
[1:27:43] preached and that the church was taking
[1:27:45] care of Titus 1:6 give us gives us the
[1:27:48] qualifications for that
[1:27:50] said if any be blameless the husband of
[1:27:52] one wife having faithful children I hope
[1:27:55] my children are listening faithful
[1:27:59] children that means children in the
[1:28:00] faith and what that means is that
[1:28:04] children if the children are at home see
[1:28:07] if a man if his family didn't believe a
[1:28:09] man couldn't be a pastor if his family
[1:28:13] didn't believe I'm not talking about
[1:28:14] adult children but his family in his
[1:28:16] house if they didn't believe he couldn't
[1:28:19] be a pastor he couldn't because he has
[1:28:22] to have faithful children that's what
[1:28:23] that means
[1:28:23] not accused of riot or unruly so if you
[1:28:28] see my kids out there on CNN with
[1:28:30] Molotov cocktails throwing stuff we got
[1:28:32] a problem
[1:28:36] not accused of riot or unruly he said
[1:28:41] for a bishop must be blameless and that
[1:28:45] means unyk used it's what that means
[1:28:48] unyk used you can't have a valid
[1:28:51] accusation if there is an accusation
[1:28:52] there's a proper way of dealing with
[1:28:54] that accusation and and then you find
[1:28:56] out whether it's true or not before you
[1:28:58] spread it right and then if it's true
[1:29:01] you got to deal with it a bishop must be
[1:29:03] blameless son accused as the steward of
[1:29:05] God not self-willed that means not one
[1:29:09] who's determined to have his own way and
[1:29:10] everything setting up his own judgment
[1:29:13] to that of everybody else expecting
[1:29:16] everybody else to pay homage to his
[1:29:18] understanding and it was Matthew Clarke
[1:29:22] that said such a governor in the Church
[1:29:24] of God can do little good maybe much
[1:29:26] mischief but he must be someone who's
[1:29:29] not self-willed not soon angry not given
[1:29:32] to wine no striker not given to filthy
[1:29:35] lucre or just greed for money lover of
[1:29:39] hospitality a lover of good men a lover
[1:29:43] of good men a pastor should be somebody
[1:29:45] who loves people all right what puts a
[1:29:49] lot on us doesn't it but there is a lot
[1:29:52] on us but I didn't do it just because I
[1:29:54] wanted to do it or chose to do it you
[1:29:57] don't you don't get to choose your field
[1:29:59] of service right God places you where he
[1:30:02] wants you in the church
[1:30:03] God does that you don't just get to
[1:30:05] choose and say well I'll pick from all
[1:30:06] the churches I'll choose the one I want
[1:30:08] to go to our I'll pick what kind of
[1:30:09] ministry I have you don't get it comes
[1:30:12] out of your own life and out of your the
[1:30:14] things you've been through and the gifts
[1:30:16] that God gives you and you preach a
[1:30:18] certain way and nobody else preaches
[1:30:20] like that if if you preach like
[1:30:21] everybody else does and there's a
[1:30:22] problem
[1:30:23] you're just an imitator anybody can be
[1:30:26] an imitator an actor but you have to be
[1:30:29] a lover of good men sober just holy
[1:30:31] temperate holding fast the faithful word
[1:30:37] it was so important as he has been
[1:30:41] taught
[1:30:42] you can't teach others if you can't be
[1:30:45] taught
[1:30:47] holding fast the faithful word as he
[1:30:51] hath been taught God help us today if
[1:30:53] there is another generation to teach
[1:30:55] that generation faithfully that he may
[1:30:58] be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
[1:31:00] and to convince the gainsayers that's
[1:31:04] part of my job is to convince you of
[1:31:06] what's true so I got to be sure about
[1:31:09] what's true I can't convince you that's
[1:31:12] why I can't preach as if I'm well it may
[1:31:14] be true and it may not be and I can't do
[1:31:16] that I have to declare the Word of God
[1:31:18] and I'm not doing that accusative Lior
[1:31:21] but but I have to declare the Word of
[1:31:22] God because I have to I have a mandate
[1:31:25] to convince you that it's true so book
[1:31:29] to exhort and to convince the gainsayers
[1:31:30] so as I said you must be faithfully
[1:31:33] taught or you're not going to be able to
[1:31:34] do that 2nd Timothy 4:2 Paul can in his
[1:31:37] expectation the preachers he said preach
[1:31:38] the word be instant in season out of
[1:31:40] season be able to preach sort at any
[1:31:43] time I was speaking to my brother
[1:31:45] yesterday and I talking to him about
[1:31:47] ministry and I said that you know and
[1:31:49] I'm I get used to a certain way that
[1:31:51] ministry should be in other words they
[1:31:53] call you out a certain way if you've
[1:31:55] ever noticed the preacher gets nervous
[1:31:56] if you do anything different right and
[1:31:59] so we like there to be an order we want
[1:32:00] there to be an order we get called out a
[1:32:02] certain way and these preachers probably
[1:32:03] back me up on this if everything is
[1:32:05] different you get nervous because you
[1:32:07] don't know what's going on and you learn
[1:32:10] how to come out and you even walk a
[1:32:11] certain way and you just there's just a
[1:32:12] certain thing that you've went through
[1:32:14] and you calm your nerves a certain
[1:32:16] but he said be instant in season and out
[1:32:19] of season and I've known men a minister
[1:32:22] ought to be able to convince people of
[1:32:24] truth even if he's not on the pulpit
[1:32:27] right ought to be able to reprove rebuke
[1:32:29] exhort with all long-suffering and
[1:32:31] doctrine not just from the pulpit but
[1:32:33] everywhere and that's a tall order but
[1:32:35] it's something that we have to do now
[1:32:37] brother Brown says let a man go where
[1:32:39] God leads him to go he said I like that
[1:32:43] if the people in the conference just say
[1:32:44] well here's a nice church this brother
[1:32:46] has built up a nice church we have a
[1:32:48] little pet and they'll send him over to
[1:32:50] this church they don't realize they're
[1:32:51] killing themselves and I can't tell you
[1:32:54] how many churches have done that and I'm
[1:32:55] so glad that I believe God led us I
[1:32:58] believe that I'm not the absolute I
[1:33:00] don't know all of the will of God but I
[1:33:02] believe God has led us to this place
[1:33:04] we've seen him do too much and so I have
[1:33:07] to believe that but but here he said
[1:33:09] they'll send him over this church they
[1:33:11] don't realize they're killing themselves
[1:33:12] and so many do that he said see first
[1:33:14] place if that man goes in there he can't
[1:33:16] feel that man's place you can never be
[1:33:18] somebody else he said then they only
[1:33:21] weak in the church to try to show favor
[1:33:23] to some pet it's always been that way he
[1:33:26] said but I believe in the supreme
[1:33:27] authority of the local assembly
[1:33:29] he said yes let each church be its own
[1:33:31] choose its pastors it sneaking's
[1:33:34] whatever it is and that's that's what
[1:33:36] you did this morning let each church
[1:33:38] choose its passengers it's deacons
[1:33:40] whatever it is and that way the man in
[1:33:42] there has no bishop over him the Holy
[1:33:45] Spirit wants to speak something to that
[1:33:46] church they don't have to ask anybody
[1:33:48] about whether they could do this or that
[1:33:50] it's the individual in contact with the
[1:33:53] Holy Spirit he said show me by the Bible
[1:33:55] was greater in the Bible than a local
[1:33:57] elder to a local church he said that's
[1:33:59] right yes for the sovereignty of the
[1:34:01] local church each church in itself and
[1:34:03] that church that scripture gets abused
[1:34:05] to or that that quote because there is
[1:34:09] nothing greater as far as bishops you
[1:34:12] know what's greater the people he
[1:34:14] preaches to brother Branham said that
[1:34:17] over and over again because the people
[1:34:20] you preach to are the purchase of God's
[1:34:21] blood he said and what's greater the
[1:34:24] purchase of the blood was the blood he
[1:34:26] said the purchase of the blood is
[1:34:28] greater so for me preaching to you
[1:34:30] you I'm a servant which is what a
[1:34:32] preacher a minister it's what the word
[1:34:34] ministry means a minister is a servant
[1:34:37] and so yes there's nothing higher as far
[1:34:40] as authorities in a local elder in a
[1:34:41] local church but it's because the church
[1:34:43] is God's purchase purchase of God's
[1:34:46] blood now I mean let me go here and I'm
[1:34:48] I'm not too far from being done so
[1:34:53] everybody said thank the Lord this is
[1:34:56] the point in which you get to start
[1:34:58] griping about how long I preach by the
[1:35:00] way you really couldn't do that up till
[1:35:03] now but now you get to gripe about it
[1:35:05] and it's okay I'm gonna get me a clock
[1:35:08] up there too but he said but now hath
[1:35:13] God set the members but do you believe
[1:35:17] God sets the ministry God sets the gift
[1:35:20] some of the rest do you believe that but
[1:35:22] now hath God set the members now hath
[1:35:26] God set the members every one of them in
[1:35:28] the body as it hath pleased him I don't
[1:35:34] get a say over where you go to church I
[1:35:36] hope you go here but I don't have a say
[1:35:41] in that I don't you can go into church
[1:35:44] anywhere you want to go to church
[1:35:46] anywhere you feel led to go to church I
[1:35:48] don't get a say in that any more than
[1:35:50] you get a say in the fact that I am a
[1:35:52] preacher now you get a say in the fact
[1:35:53] that I'm your pastor but you don't get a
[1:35:55] say in the fact that I am a minister and
[1:35:56] I don't get a say in where you go to
[1:35:59] church I don't get to vote you in or out
[1:36:04] all right I can't do that you can do
[1:36:08] that I can't do that God has set the
[1:36:11] members every one of them in the body as
[1:36:13] it hath pleased him and unless there
[1:36:17] would be some disorder in the church
[1:36:18] where you would have some drunken person
[1:36:21] or something that would come and disrupt
[1:36:23] the services then the Deacons and the
[1:36:25] authority in the church would have a
[1:36:26] right to ask them not to come back in
[1:36:28] some in some disruptive way but as far
[1:36:31] as being a part of this church God said
[1:36:33] huh God set the members every one of
[1:36:36] them in the body as it hath pleased him
[1:36:39] so you might say this morning you might
[1:36:41] be wondering where should I go to church
[1:36:44] well I think you should go here but look
[1:36:48] God said in the church God said in the
[1:36:52] church and that has to be something
[1:36:54] that's revealed to you you know where
[1:36:56] you should go to church at your local
[1:36:58] church that preaches the truth now
[1:37:03] that's a problem and I know what you're
[1:37:04] thinking there's a lot of local churches
[1:37:07] to preach the message but look and and
[1:37:11] there's nothing against those brothers
[1:37:12] because I believe and God help me you
[1:37:15] remind me of this if I ever don't if I
[1:37:18] ever get frustrated but God help me if
[1:37:20] God helps me I'm gonna try to have as
[1:37:21] much cooperation and fellowship as we
[1:37:23] can half with the other believers in the
[1:37:25] area but but this is our church we're
[1:37:27] responsible for our own church
[1:37:29] but you should go to your local church
[1:37:31] that preaches the truth you're free to
[1:37:34] go anywhere that preaches the truth if
[1:37:37] you have five churches locally you pick
[1:37:42] one but make sure you pray about it it
[1:37:48] don't decide up to me it's between you
[1:37:51] and God God put certain ministries
[1:37:54] certain pastors for some reason God
[1:37:56] thought she needed five different
[1:37:57] preachers I don't know in the area I
[1:37:59] don't know why things have happened the
[1:38:02] way that they have but they'd sit here
[1:38:03] for a reason so you go were you where
[1:38:07] you know is the right place for you
[1:38:08] that's where you go so you say well how
[1:38:13] can I know that
[1:38:14] but the Branham speaking of the choosing
[1:38:17] of a bride he talks about praying for
[1:38:19] your spouse he said the same applies
[1:38:21] about choosing a church and that's a
[1:38:24] choice you make every day by the way
[1:38:26] that's not just a one-time thing but you
[1:38:28] choose to support a local church every
[1:38:31] day and every week and when you work and
[1:38:32] you pay your tithe and you do the things
[1:38:34] that you do and you show up on work days
[1:38:36] or whatever that we do you show up and
[1:38:38] meetings and you you choose to support
[1:38:40] the church and if you choose to support
[1:38:43] the church and you must pray over that
[1:38:46] church before you choose to do that so
[1:38:49] you must constantly we should constantly
[1:38:51] be in prayer Lord I want my church to be
[1:38:53] right I want things to be right at the
[1:38:56] church I want you to lead my
[1:38:58] surely the Deacons lead the the trustees
[1:39:01] all the the officers of the church lead
[1:39:03] the the singing in the music and
[1:39:04] everything that's done I want you to be
[1:39:06] a part of it Lord
[1:39:07] we should pray over our church you must
[1:39:10] pray over the church that you were
[1:39:12] fellowshiping in he said because
[1:39:14] remember churches carry a spirit and he
[1:39:16] goes into that how a church acts like a
[1:39:18] pastor he said so if I was choosing a
[1:39:21] church I choose the genuine fundamental
[1:39:24] Full Gospel Bible Church so you found
[1:39:29] one this one right here but if you
[1:39:33] choose to go to another genuine Full
[1:39:35] Gospel fundamental Bible Church god
[1:39:38] bless you for that but we want to be
[1:39:41] responsible for our church here he said
[1:39:43] if I was choosing one to put my family
[1:39:45] in and we've got to think about that now
[1:39:48] it should be not only a perfect church
[1:39:51] not only a protected church but a
[1:39:54] powerful Church a powerful Church and we
[1:39:59] say that but do we really believe it do
[1:40:03] we really believe that God can do what
[1:40:05] he said in mark 16:17 these signs shall
[1:40:08] follow them that belief that's not just
[1:40:13] preachers but that's every one of us
[1:40:16] these signs shall follow them that
[1:40:18] belief so we can we can put all names in
[1:40:22] there these signs shall follow Benford
[1:40:23] these signs shall follow JD hice these
[1:40:25] signs shall follow every one of you then
[1:40:28] the belief in my name shall they cast
[1:40:32] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:40:36] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:40:40] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:40:41] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:40:45] the sick and they shall recover do we
[1:40:48] believe that today they shall lay hands
[1:40:51] on the sick Matthew 18 and 19 speaks of
[1:40:55] the church this body of Christ when he
[1:40:58] says again I say to you that if two of
[1:40:59] you shall agree on earth as touching
[1:41:02] anything that they shall ask it should
[1:41:06] be done for them my father which is in
[1:41:08] heaven
[1:41:09] to be so son just me praying for you but
[1:41:12] it's you
[1:41:12] agreeing with me and that's all it takes
[1:41:15] us to then what could happen if we can
[1:41:18] all agree together
[1:41:19] we'd be like they were in the upper room
[1:41:21] when they were all with one Accord in
[1:41:23] one place and the Holy Ghost begin to
[1:41:25] fall down on each one of them
[1:41:26] individually hey man if two of you
[1:41:29] showed up green you realize what God has
[1:41:31] done he says he sings and we hate I know
[1:41:33] it's hard on a church to go through
[1:41:35] votes and to go through times of change
[1:41:37] and things like that
[1:41:38] but we do that we have to do that so we
[1:41:40] can get to this so we can get to the
[1:41:43] purpose of the church what are we here
[1:41:45] for we're here to be Jesus Christ to the
[1:41:47] world that we live in we're here to be
[1:41:49] the hands on the and the feet that jesus
[1:41:51] walks in we're here to be Jesus Christ
[1:41:53] in order for us to do that we have to
[1:41:56] agree that these things are going to be
[1:41:58] done if two of you shall agree on earth
[1:42:01] as touching anything that they shall ask
[1:42:02] it should be done for them of my father
[1:42:04] which is in heaven power in that power
[1:42:08] in that God works on both ends of the
[1:42:10] line God worked with you as the church
[1:42:14] and you worked with me as a minister to
[1:42:15] bring us together here God works of two
[1:42:17] you will agree for two or three are
[1:42:22] gathered together in my name there am I
[1:42:26] in the midst of them what does that mean
[1:42:32] sister Victoria means he's here this
[1:42:34] morning he's walking in the midst of the
[1:42:38] seven golden candlesticks he's still
[1:42:41] there where two or three are gathered
[1:42:46] together in my name there am I in the
[1:42:49] midst of him I'm closing musicians come
[1:42:55] and if you get the back stand ready to
[1:42:58] come and we'll pray with him and brother
[1:43:00] Branham says now the power of the church
[1:43:01] I want you to get this now the power of
[1:43:05] the church you want to have to be a
[1:43:07] powerful Church this isn't the Church
[1:43:10] where the church we can make this
[1:43:13] beautiful but we can't make it powerful
[1:43:16] it is a nice sanctuary beautiful thank
[1:43:19] qu Airy but we can't make it powerful
[1:43:21] but this church
[1:43:24] this house of God these houses of God
[1:43:28] can be powerful and the power of the
[1:43:32] church is in what is it to debate and
[1:43:35] have strife and be the most perfect on
[1:43:38] every dot and everything though it's to
[1:43:40] come together and pray because I hardly
[1:43:44] touch when their leader was in prison
[1:43:46] when Peter was down there in prison he
[1:43:49] was all he's all shut up he's shackled
[1:43:50] up in that early church what did they do
[1:43:52] they didn't know anything else to do
[1:43:53] they just got together and prayed when
[1:43:58] they come together to praise as the
[1:43:59] walls begin to shake and when they did
[1:44:04] Peter an angel that's Peter out of
[1:44:06] prison and he shows up at the doorstep
[1:44:07] you talk about the answered prayers but
[1:44:11] the church is doing what the church does
[1:44:12] come together and pray you may not see
[1:44:14] results overnight it may not be instant
[1:44:16] but you come together and pray because
[1:44:18] that's the power of the church let's do
[1:44:22] that this morning could we let's stand
[1:44:24] together if you'd bring paxton up we're
[1:44:26] gonna pray for this young man that's
[1:44:27] been been sick they don't know what's
[1:44:30] wrong with him but we know that our God
[1:44:33] is a healer and sometimes these things
[1:44:36] bring uncertainty and fear when we don't
[1:44:38] know what it is that's going on but we
[1:44:40] know that God is a healer of every
[1:44:42] things and I am THE LORD thy God that
[1:44:44] heals all my diseases let's pray for
[1:44:47] this young man and this this family God
[1:44:49] would give them peace about it and that
[1:44:51] he would heal him and if you have a need
[1:44:53] feel free to come and I want every one
[1:44:54] of you to pray because he said the power
[1:44:58] of the church is to pray it's to come
[1:45:00] together and pray did you pray with me
[1:45:03] this morning you believe that God is a
[1:45:06] healer then I believe God is gonna do
[1:45:07] what God does hey man Heavenly Father
[1:45:11] for this young man this morning you know
[1:45:14] Lord his life and you know all about him
[1:45:17] you know Lord Jesus that's what his
[1:45:19] family's been through I pray God that
[1:45:21] you wouldn't move I pray that she Lord
[1:45:24] reach down his body whatever it is that
[1:45:25] may be incorrect I pray you'd make it
[1:45:27] correct or Jesus first brother Alan
[1:45:30] sister Deanie I pray God that you would
[1:45:32] just comfort them today and help them to
[1:45:34] know it'll be okay and whatever it is
[1:45:37] you've got control over it Lord we'd
[1:45:40] rather ourselves be sick than our
[1:45:41] children but I pray Heavenly Father that
[1:45:44] you come as this church comes and agrees
[1:45:45] together today Lord that healing will
[1:45:48] take place and this child's body or

[1:45:59] what you did we thank you for it Lord we
[1:46:01] believe Lord that it'll be healed
