God is so good to us it's been good to you today amen it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and I am I wanted to before brother Joel comes out to preach I wanted to personally apologize for how long the service was this morning that's my fault but I believe the spirit of the Lord was with us even so and and I I don't usually preach that long but I just had something on my heart I wish I could get it across to you the way that I had it on my heart but the Lord knows and by Revelation just put it down in your hearts and in your minds I there's a reason for every service but we're not gonna have brother Joel under strict instructions we have fixed the clock so it's 3 31 right now brother Joel and he said he's not going to go over his time tonight unless the spirit would break out and and move him to do that and then we're led by the spirit do you believe that and amen amen so we might as well have church tonight we're here so we might as well enjoy the presence of the Lord amen um uh let's sing um let's sing a happy song is brother Joel comes out and I got to think of a happy song now uh let's see I'm one of them I'm one of them so glad I can say I'm one of them aren't you glad to be one of them you heard your you heard from your theophany you heard from something Eternal that was the truth about you and you're one of them amen amen there's no one doing that devil can't get you because God's already got you aren't you glad for that today amen his brother Joel comes now there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all the flame with the fire that fell at Pentecost which cleansed made them clean it is burning now within my heart all glory to his name I'm so glad I can say that I'm one of them singing now I'm [Music] one of this [Music] well I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and all these people may not learn to be nor boast up worldly things they have all received their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and are telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them well I'm one of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh I want of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can say one more time with all your hearts now oh I'm one of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them yes I'm one of them I'm one of them and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Give the Lord a big hand of praise tonight aren't you thankful to be one of them amen I tell you I hadn't heard a song sister Anna sang that song I haven't heard that one in a long time saying in church it's on tape they sing that one on tape I believe it's brother Outlaws Church there in Phoenix and you know they just break out next thing you know you hear them shouting and screaming on that tape and I tell you what I was there when the spirit came we can all testify of that we should we we should be where the spirit of the Lord is moving and where the liberty of the spirit is and where he is there is Liberty aren't you thankful for that tonight so if you have your Bibles while you're standing we're going to uh well let's see if I even put it in here my goodness uh so you know what praise the Lord I lost my spot already and I hadn't got started and uh we're gonna go right here it's the Psalms uh uh well we're I you know what I completely lost it y'all look at that isn't that wonderful I was studying this and and it just it just completely left me but I've got it written down here I'll it's the one where brother Brandon was preaching in the Rapture and he uses that one for his text it's uh it huh Psalms 37 and 1. I believe that's I had 27 down and I knew that wasn't right well you know it's just home folks here tonight so we're all right and that I don't think that's right either it is a 27. that's what I had down buddy and I didn't see it on there I'll just read it to you how about that I don't have the scratch scripture but I've got it I've got the actual scripture on my screen I just don't know which one it is he that dwelleth in the secret place or the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust how many believes that tonight surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise some pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness for the destruction that wasteth that Noonday nor for the destruction that wasted the Noonday A thousand shall follow thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee aren't you thankful for that tonight amen you may you may be seated May Lord add His blessings to the word I'll try not to do that again how about that but I was reading this here and you have to excuse me it's hot up here let me take this off that does not preach that does not mean I'm going to preach a long time I just I'm just hot I won't hold you along let me start my timer here we're batting a thousands so far well praise the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight a little simple thought come to me and it was fulfilling the promise of the hour somebody's got to do it somebody's got to fulfill the promise of the hour right and so when you see a promise of a Rapture and it tells you how you're going to be you don't have to be afraid of the things that are going to happen around you you don't have to worry about the tens of thousands that's going to fall but there's going to be somebody in that time that is going to be making it all the way through and somebody's going to be sheltered and hid away in the palms of his hand aren't you thankful for that tonight and brother Branham said somebody has got to fulfill the promises of the hour and if you look back when you think back to to the time of of Jesus Christ he was prophesied there in Psalms that he would come a virgin would conceive and and somebody had to fulfill it and brother Brandon talked about the Jews would miss it because they were looking for it in an intellectual way but let me tell you today they're an intellectual faith has never worked and it will never work but you must provide but must prove to God that you're a Believer by faith in his word and believing from the heart not from something in your mind and not something that that that a person could try to talk you into or convince you into but you've got to believe from the heart and it comes by Revelation through the Vindicated word of the hour and so I think today if we could ever get ourselves hidden away from the things of the world and get away from the voices of the world today and realize that God has got a body today with a voice God has got somebody that is willing to hear the word for the hour and he sets you aside why because you are a promised generation you are somebody that will sit here and put on this Earth to overcome laodicea so that ought to make somebody shout because you are not just wanting a promise or needing a promise but you are actually living out a promise in this day can you say Amen brother Ram talks about in the beginning he said it must have been foggy and dismal and dark as the world was turning and when God knows that he had need of a light he said now his seed was already on the earth because he had planted it there he said now he needed light to bring forth that seed to make that seed live because the seed was already there remember God had a thought and the thought now had to be fulfilled and so he thought I'm going to have a son and I'm going to call his name Adam but now there had to come before become a fulfillment of that thought on the earth if the thought would have been taking place in God's mind and it would have never been fulfilled then God would not have been God but when he thought it then it had to come to pass and in this time he thought of a bride that would not fall and he saw you and he saw me and if he saw it then it has to be fulfilled in this hour and you are hidden away in the secret place today you believe that church can I get some more monitors up here I can't hear it myself at all and he said so just like it is in each age God has foretold us what would take place in each age the only thing he needs is the manifestation of the light of God upon the scripture to make it live for that age how many believes that today so you are the manifestation of the light of God from the scriptures you are the Fulfillment of the word for this day somebody's got to be it might as well be us I'm not willing to set in a dead cold formal church I'm not willing to sit and say that that my family can be lost or or you could just be another Christian or you can just be another Baptist or another Methodist no I am going in a Rapture and therefore I must be hid away in the things of the world in the word I must be hit by the Shadows of the almighty Wings because I'm not here just to be another person but I'm here to be a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this day or somebody can preach with me for just a minute we are not here just to be another another member of society we're not here to be affiliated with another party just another Democrat a republican but we're here to be Sons and Daughters of the almighty God we are here to be more than conquerors of the devil that is trying to overtake us and our family and our churches oh somebody preached with me this afternoon you are not here to just sit there and hear the word but we were made to be a fulfillment of the word and so that means we've got to do the word for our day we've got to be living and written Epistles rid of all men why because if you're just if you're just sitting there and you say well I'm a Christian I go to Word of Life Tabernacle and God's been good to us down there but if you don't live the word to that person they'll never believe your testimony but you've got to be a living testimony in the day that we're living in today because that is the Fulfillment of scripture there will be a called out people receive the Holy Ghost and they would be they would be a greater than they would be more than conquerors they would be something that would raise up an invincible army of the Lord Jesus would be here in the end time to overcome laodicea to overcome a generation of perverted and backslidden people there be people that sit in the church and they'll go along with Kay writes and and lesbians and and all these different things church that is not the bride and the bride will not be made up of that but the bride will be made up of a people that will believe the message of the hour and they will act upon the message of the hour we're not here just to play Church we're not here just to have another service but we are here to live out the Vindicated word for our day can you say amen I hope somebody's hearing me today I know it's simple but you need to know who you are you are not just another another believer even because there's been many believers who have decided it wasn't right there have been many who said well the cloud couldn't have taken place because science said it couldn't take place but we can look past science and see a promise of a Vindicated promise today and we can say that Prophet was Vindicated in Malachi 4 he lived out the promise he did what he was told to do Luke 17 30 was fulfilled in our day we can point to the scripture and say this day the scripture was fulfilled but what about a bride that was said to be set there in the book of Psalms he said he would be called out you would be sent under the under the Kings of the almighty and you would be set in a place where nothing could hinder you the pestilences could not come upon you but you are the living body of Christ today and you are the bride that has been made ready for the end time I hope you're hearing me today church we are not just another group of people he should be brides and brides and it'll be churches and churches but this bride is not going to fall this pride is not going to backslide you're not going nowhere but up Church thank you this is not just another time of excitement there's been Pentecostal excitement there's been a motion over this an emotion over that there's been all kinds of that but I think the bride ought to be excited over a revealed word of our day it's not just a glare but it is an actual real light of the time that we're walking in brother Graham said by the word of God the sun shines today because the very son that we're enjoying is God's word made manifest think about it the very Earth that you're living on is the very thought of God he created the heavens and the Earth by a thought you were created by a thought he said the very sunlight this hot weather was a thought when he said let there be light it created light and the Heat he said let there be light and there was he said what if he had said let there be light and there was no light then it wasn't God that spoke but when you say thus saith the Lord that must be a direct order from God it must be God speaking and if God speaks it if it is the saith the Lord it will come to pass every time exactly like it spoke it and he said when God says Let There be there will be when he said let there will be a bride at the end time that would not fall there will be all you have to do is believe that your position in Christ is safe and secure we're not wanting we don't say well there's only going to be two or three in Hardy so maybe this brother's it maybe that brother's it maybe this sister's one of them no I'm I'm claiming that promise for myself because I am an overcomer of a laodicea Satan has tried to get me he's trying to get a lot of young people there's a lot of things on the internet today that's going to try to get you and it's going to try to bring you down there's going to be Sports that'll try to take up your time but listen to me church if you've ever met the light of the hour then you'll recognize who you are you are an overcomer you are more than just another good athlete you are more than just another good preacher you are more than just another good singer but you are the Bride of Jesus Christ Living out the promise in this day can you say Amen brother Williamson we realize that God's light of the day is his son the one the s-u-n this one the is the son he said so in the Bible he said he was in the beginning was the word the word word was with God the Word was God Hebrews 13 18 is the same yesterday today and forever he said it's the word of God always it was Christ in Noah it was Christ and Moses it was Christ and David that looked up as a rejected King upon the city where 800 years later Christ would sit there weeping over a city being a rejected King just like David was it's always the spirit of Christ and the full manifestation of God's word was made known through Jesus Christ the spirit of God think about it that was the spirit of Christ in a rejected King and that same Spirit would come again in a rejected King and then that rejected king would go die and send a spirit to the church now who's going to have that same spirit you and I are going to have the same spirit somebody's got to have the same spirit that was in Christ today and it will be a manifestation of the same life that he lived through the spirit brother Graham said and only light can come by the word of God it is revealing it is a manifestation of something to come he said and God's word is the light when it's manifested now you could say well you could go back into Luther's day or Wesley's day and say I believe that the prophet of Malachi 4 came here but where was Delight in that age it was still upon Wesley and it was still upon Luther but what you'll see is when the light came in the days of brother Branham in the seventh angel messenger you could see it wasn't just a glare but the Fulfillment of scripture came with it you can see that all things were fulfilled right there in in the life of brother Branham in the ministry of brother random as the seventh angel can you say Amen brother random said our bodies was on Earth before there was any light here yeah he said or anything the calcium the potash the petroleum and cosmic-like whatever it was was here when God created the Earth it only taken his spoken word to bring it into existence oh I hope you're hearing this tonight see it was it was already here because he thought about it this is what's going to have to be there in order for me to have a son come forth from that Earth so it has to have the pot ash and the calcium and all these things must already be in the earth and so then when he can go to the Earth and he can speak a son why because he's already put the ingredients there and so what he did today is he thought there's got to be a people and so what he did was he sent a message to call you out of something so that he could have you ready to call you forth as Sons and Daughters of God just the same as he did then he had to speak and there would be somebody come and when the spoken word of our day went into the nominational systems and it started preaching to the people there was Sons and Daughters of God that were coming forth from something oh I hope you hear me now they were coming from a dead organized Sensational system into the light of the hour why because God had already placed the seed there but now the light was going to strike the seed and they couldn't sit there any longer but they had to come forth as Sons and Daughters of God because God already saw them as what they were and who they were and where they would be sitting and so he would send a prophet to a little woman in Memphis Tennessee because there was a seed there already and so he would send the prophet there and as soon as the light strikes I already knew he was going to be here the seed was already there and the light come along and the next thing you know it come to life why because God had planted the seed and God had sent the word along to put it put to to dramatize the seed and I hope you hear me tonight church God has not brought you out of a denomination just as another church member but he brought you out to be a living body of Christ on the Earth today I preached that a couple weeks ago here you are more than just another person you are more than just another church member and if you really realize who you are you can't sit there like you once did you can't say well I can just sit here and I can join church over here and I can be a part of this church or this denomination no sir if you've accepted God and if you've accepted the light of your hour it will come to life as soon as it meets the light God has given us the ability to meet the light for our hour and to raise us up the Sons and Daughters of God brother man talks about Jesus he had been prophesied for 4 000 years that he would come he said Messiah and when he come he manifested every promise of the Messiah but yet the people of the world didn't know the churches and so forth didn't know anything about him because they had done gotten some other thing that kept them away from knowing this they had already got their minds made up of how he was going to come instead of checking with the word and allowing the seed to be born and let the light touch the seed see if you want to have a birth you've got to have a seed there in order to have a birth and these people here they were dead and they'll always be dead because there was no seed there in the first place they could hear the message of the hour you think about it there was many of thousands of people that would sit there and watch the signs of Luke 17 30 pass them right over there was many people that would sit there and they would watch a prophet turn his back to the people and call out the People by name from behind him and tell you where you lived in your address people sit there and heard it but there was no seed there the light was there but there was no seed but when you sit there and there may have been somebody just as poor as a church mouse sitting there and they heard the word of God and they recognized that was the light of the day that was Malachi 4. that was Luke 17 30. that was Revelations 10 and 7. why because the light had struck a seed that was living and now it come to life because it had set there maybe they'd sat there unto the Baptist and they set there under the Pentecostal and they sat there and all the deadness of the of the time and and they said in every Church they can think of maybe they were looking for something but when they met the very light that God had sent church I hope you hear me now when you meet the light you can't stay like you were there's got to come a change why because that was fulfilling the promise of the hour and you have got to fulfill the promise of this hour we're not here just to fulfill our duties to the church but we are here to fulfill a promise of the hours that where two or three are gathered I am in the midst he promised it and if you'll come expecting the promise then when he is then when you come together expect him to be here and he's got to show up because you're fulfilling a promise do you love the Lord tonight brother man goes on and I'll try to hurry he said now Jesus was all the inspired prophet's testimonies and all their prophecy was brought to light in his age that had been prophesied for his age he lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible that was prophesied of him a virgin shall conceive and she did he said all right his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father he was the eyes of the blind shall see they did everything that was prophesied and happened when he come on the earth why because it was a true revelation of who he was and when he recognized that he went and did exactly and fulfilled the scriptures exactly as they come he said and why the people could not see that he said it seems strange to us now because we are looking back through a rearview mirror but did you ever know if you keep looking back that way you'll wreck he said let's look ahead what is for us we can look back and see that they missed it denominational people can tell you they missed the very coming of the Messiah but if you're not careful you'll fall in the same rut that they're in because we if we look back to that and keep our eyes focused well it's got to be something great happen it's got to be another man come through the city on a donkey no that was fulfilled but now there is another fulfilling today and I would like to stand here and I'd like to Proclaim to you that this day the message of the hour is fulfilled before your eyes because I'll tell you another promise a lot of people Overlook of another promise he said there'd be some young man that would pick this message up and take it on to the coming of the Lord I'm going to fulfill that promise your pastor is going to fulfill that promise we're not going to sit down we're not going to shut up we're not going to wait for somebody to tell us that we can't preach no more no we are going to fulfill brother Stewart the promise that we are going to go into all the world and preach the good news in the power and the demonstration of the Gospel these are all of our promises why give up on them now in a very time of Leo to see him in a time of dead cold lukewarm church members this is the day when you might as well stand on the Promises of God I'll tell you there's an old song Standing on the Promises brother it's not sitting on the premises only but we come here and we sit down and we hear the word of God and when the power of the Lord comes Upon Our Hearts and the light strikes the seed you can't help but move under the anointing of the Holy Ghost the anointing is not just for the preacher it's for the hearer as well because when the hearer will get anointed with the same spirit that the preachers got on him then they can become a doer of the same word we're not here just to preach we're not here just to have a three o'clock service on a Sunday afternoon but what we're here to do is to fulfill what we're promised to do because gathering together is not just something we do because there's more offerings taken up where there's more electricity used and it's not just something because we eat and it's a social Gathering no sir that's not what it is but the fulfilling of the scripture that said that much more as the days I don't care how many times a week you have church I'm not putting you out for having it once a week or twice a week but I'll tell you why not have it some more in an age where we can have too much time for this we can go fishing every day of the week we can go to a ball game every day of the week I'll tell you what somebody ought to preach with me now somebody who they might miss church for this or miss church for that let me tell you something if God is in your heart brother you can't wait for them Church doors to open if it was every night of the week if it was Monday through Saturday and twice on Sunday if thought it was in your heart if there was a way to be there you'd be there why because God has placed a desire in your heart to worship him in his hand House of God and if God has placed something in your heart I want to go hear the word of God I can't be the same sitting at home I get cold I get indifferent I get down on myself let me tell you something church we sit around long enough wondering why does the pastor do this why does the church do this I'll tell you why we do it because we want to see Souls saved we want to see a move of God in the church again we want to see Souls come back home that have been lost and they've wandered around from church to church let me tell you something they can be dead they can be cold but we want to sit here where the fire of the Living God is still moving upon the people I'll tell you somebody ought to testify with me we don't want a dead church here we want the word to move the people oh yes come on you wonder why churches get a little dried up I'll tell you because of preaching their complexes instead of the word of God we don't want that around here what we want is the word to be preached and you to be free to Worship in any way you want to because God has not given you a spirit of fear the pastor is not here saying well you can't say Amen in church you can't raise your hand up in church no he's saying let the word penetrate your heart and let it bring forth the Son and Daughter of God because that's what we need we need to be reborn we need something new the changes from the inside out that is a promise of the hour that there would be somebody that would have a new birth and make a Rapture you can't make it any other way program goes on down here I'm about to run out of time well then said certainly John had been prophesied by Isaiah 712 years before his birth and that voice of one would be crying in the wilderness and also Malachi the last of the prophets 400 years before his coming in the third chapter behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way he said here was John on the earth making that written word live he said he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and also was preparing the way before the Messiah Jesus said you love to walk in his light because he was that light bright and Shining Light and John he said now I must decrease my light must go out because I have served my time that's prophesied of me and he says hear ye him he is the one to to follow it living in that day he said it proved this now brother Brahm said the Jews thought that they were worshiping in the True Light and I wonder how many today in the Methodist and the and the Wesleyan churches think they're serving a True Light because they're walking in everything that they may know they don't see the light for the day because they're actually following what looks like a light and it is a glare from another day because there's still just a little bit of a light there what it is it's a light shining onto something it's a glare it's not the True Light of the hour but what they're doing is following a false light it's a mirage brother random calls it you're going out in the desert you're hot I know some of you are you're hot and you're sitting there and you're wondering you're like you're like like where am I going to go what am I going to do I want you to see something that looks almost real and you follow after it what is it it is a false light and when you get there you'll realize if you try to dive in there ain't no water there it's all dried up it's just a false light you go over there to the Pentecostal church and you'll see that Pentecostal church and they may have the speaking in tongues they may have the shouting they may have the dancing they may have the best music and all those things may be okay but you'll find out that they're missing the very word for the hour why because it's a false light now they may be walking in all the light they know they may be Christians but if they don't know the word for their hour they cannot walk in it but if there is a seed and then brother if there is a seed there and if the light ever strikes it then they can't stay there no longer they can have they may have to come out of that once they see the light why because the light is not the Pentecostal night it is not a Lutheran Life it is not a glare for another age but this light is an evening timeline with an evening time people who are going to overcome an end time period of tribulation listen we're not going to be here for it because what we're overcoming is almost a pre-tribulation you could say you'll see the squeeze it'll come on you'll see people that'll be trying to be pulled in to sports they'll be tried to be pulled in to a worldly entertainment they'll be trying to pull in the worldliness of the letters all around them it is going to be the Overcomers that do not fall to that they're going to go on a Rapture and completely miss the tribulation the ones that'll fall into that a little bit they wonder why did they do it why can they be pulled so far from the truth because maybe there wasn't a seed there for the light of this hour well it's just the truth sometimes but I believe if you're sitting here on a hot Sunday afternoon and you're sitting in a three o'clock service I don't believe that that could be just any ordinary Christian but I think that must be somebody who wants to hear the word of God and let it move upon their hearts and it changes us from the inside out we are no longer a wolf in sheep's clothing but we are a sheep from the inside out with the world that's growing on us brother it's from the inside it is a true thing it's not just a covering that we put on it's not brothers and sisters you see them sisters wearing their long dresses and her long hair they're not doing that just to look cool no they are doing it because they have sold out their own ideas they're sold out what they thought they were they don't want to be just another beauty queen but they want to be a daughter of God why because Beauty will only last so long but a daughter of God is eternal brother let me tell you something today we are not here just to be another member of society maybe you could be a president someday and you tell your kids maybe you could be a great quarterbacker maybe he could be a president or or a congressman or maybe you could be the the senator or the the governor or something like that but brother what I want him to do is that the Lord tarries is to be preachers in the house of God where I wanted to be grow up to be something maybe a deacon maybe they don't do nothing but sit there in the church but let me tell you I want to see him there every time the doors are open not because I'm a message believer but because they have experienced God for themselves and because they have a seed on the inside and the light that is of the age the light of the hour when it strikes them they won't sit there and just little kids anymore but they'll grow into sons of God they're not going to be just another Pruitts on the front row but they're going to be sons of God that'll fulfill scripture in this day the same as every one of us do this day this scripture must be fulfilled and it's got to be fulfilled by somebody why not us president said the hour is at hand now when the light is shining The Gospel Light in his power of the resurrection of Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever he lauded that for this day the things that he promised for this day must happen in this day if the church won't accept it God is able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham he'll get his message over because he's always done it and he always will somebody has got to accept the message of the hour If the message came there has to be a seed to respond to the word it did not come in vain God's word will never go out in vain but it will always go out and it will bring in all kinds there will be fish and there will be Turtles and brother Ram talks about it the net will catch all kinds but the true fish will stay there because they're feeding on something but brother Ben talked about it this morning they're feeding on the body word of the son of man and that's what we the bride of Christ are feeding on today we're not feeding on just another idea or another myth or or another denominational idea but brother we're feeding on the very word of God that has been fulfilled in this hour you ought to be the happiest people in the face of the Earth you say we don't need shouting in the church no more let me go and tell you something we're the only people that have anything to shout about yeah we're the only people that even have a right to shout because there's worshipers worshiping in vain all across the world but you have been called out a royal priesthood you have been set aside and called from the sin that you were in to say here today and you can say I am not just an abominational I'm not a chicken no more but remember the chicken will sit around there and cook and they'll find problems with each other we do that all the time as at this flesh sometimes I think it's chicken in the inside's eagle sometimes we get a little you know we start picking on one another a little bit we get a little dry in our experience but why don't we just let that go and forget about our daily work and forget who might have done us wrong and forget about those who maybe we say well this one here maybe you just misunderstood them maybe let's just let it go let's be brothers and sisters why don't we just love one another anyway because this pride is going to be a Capstone bride with love amongst them we are not going to be a hateful bunch of people always picking on one another we ever see a chicken at the in the barnyard and they peck on each other and they're pulling the feathers out yeah that's the way a bunch of chickens are they're sitting over there and they got some ladies sitting around talking about the soup supper and they kick some woman out because she cooked the wrong kind of soup but brother I'll tell you this you are not called to sit around with the things of the world it doesn't really matter so much about how nice of a facility you've got it doesn't matter how good the food was next door but what matters is the word being preached in the power in the demonstration are you sitting here in Heavenly places finding your position as sons and daughters of God how many can say I am an overcomer I am who God says I am I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle and you sound different you don't act like a chicken does you fly higher you see beyond military vehicles can see farther you see beyond the things of the world you know that when they start going over there trying to take over Putin let me go and tell you something we ain't got nothing to worry about because brother Branham said before the bomb would ever be released he said the bride would be picked up he said before one drop of fire ever fell on Sodom Abraham was already out anyway let me go ahead and tell you something you don't have to fear little pride because you are fulfilling scripture and the scripture said he wouldn't lose one of you so I think that's the age where to live in an age of promises an age of blessings an age of overcoming yes Satan's gonna fight you yes he's going to try to bring you down he's going to try to show you your faults with your brother and your sister that's his job he's always going to be there in your mind but you don't have to look at it you don't have to pay attention to it what you have to do is keep your eyes on the promise keep your eyes on the North Star and walk in the light of the hour because if you're walking in the light as he is in the light then you can have fellowship with God then you can have fellowship with your brother you can love one another more why because we're more than just another denominational chicken pin said the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the herodians and whatever might be they got the world so gummed up my iPad tried to correct that word it didn't recognize it in the English language but I think we know what a prophet meant when he was just pretty simple because we can look around now and see that the world is pretty gummed up like they did in all the ages they could not see the real light church if you could ever see the message and if you look at look back through history and you see the way it happened in Moses and Noah and with Jesus you'll see it as exactly the same program today and has happened in the same way it is so biblical that when a church tries to prove you wrong all you have to say Do you believe this this and this and walk them through the Bible most of the time what you'll find is they don't believe what really happened then what you're talking to is a make-believer that's really an atheist and so what you've got today brother Graham said Jesus Christ is just as real today to a human heart as he ever was that's right his power and his living presence is just as real today as it ever was he said Lo a little while in the world will see me tomorrow brother says Cosmos the order of the world won't see me no more yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world that's Bible how many believes that that's a promise it's not written there just to make you feel good it's a promise to you if you'll accept it as such he said and he said and then he said until the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also even greater than this shall you do because I go to my father he said that great promise is today he says all that and then he says that great promise is today period the world is as blind as they can be but there is a ye shall see me that's how he puts it in quote unquote there is a ye shall see me who's he's talking to a special group of people there is a called out people that will see him because he's living among them will this bless my heart it was in the message you ought to go listen to it turn on the light 1964. it's a powerful sermon brother but I'm talking about the life of the age and and all the different glares and the mirages of things most of the quotes I've taken today have been from that sermon and he said he said there will be there is a ye shall see me and that's what we're trying to get today what the Full Gospel is to express Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection and all the fullness of his promises that the Holy Ghost manifests these things and make them right that God has promised and he will do it now I think sometimes we Overlook the Simplicity of the message because it doesn't sound deep enough but there is a ye shall see me on earth now and the promise has got to happen because he said so period that's all there is to it do you need to know any more no you're going to see him you're going to feel him you're going to recognize him because his presence is living among you and in you and around you and you can't get away from him if you've ever accepted him because you can't be lost once you've accepted the very Spirit of Christ says now all we are today all we are today is the display of his attributes first he was not even God we would just call him the Eternal one because he wasn't God he had to be worshiped God is an object of worship how many knows that God is an object he couldn't even be God without you because you've got to worship God now let me tell you something you quit worshiping we got a problem because God has got to be worshiped by somebody because if you don't worship him he's going to make the stones worship him if you don't stop making worship the gravel out here is going to start worshiping somebody has got to worship God in spirit and Truth not just in spirit only maybe the Pentecostals could do a pretty good job of worshiping the spirit and somebody maybe can sit there and say I'm word only well that's okay if your word only then the word says spirit and Truth both together you can't have one without the other if you've got just the word and it's never been and it's never had the spirit upon it what you've got is a dead letter but what you've got to have is a spirit and Truth together why because it's biblical because it's true and when you have both together then brother that'll make you move on down the road you've heard the message it is a rising of the sun you take the two Cadillacs side by side and one of them is just as good as the other one they got the same Mechanical Devices I think brother Brandon calls them a 16 cylinder car and you got them sitting there and he said one of them you put water in the gas tank and one of them in the uh you put gas in the gas tank he said and you start them try to start them both up he said that one car with gas will take off and run right on down the highway but that car no matter how mechanically indoctrinally sound it is it'll set there with water in the tank it won't move a muscle try to tell me you're a living body of Christ and you put water in the gas tank brother I'll tell you what you need is you need another Soul Filling Station you need to meet God on his terms one time and lose your idea of how you're going to worship God and let him move through you and your Worship in ways that you never thought possible before because you're worshiping God not from the flesh but you're worshiping him because of what he's done for you you're worshiping because the truth has been revealed to you just you nobody else can be a part of this bride but you had a seed you are somebody that is beyond just listen Church you don't realize how blessed you are you are someone that has a seed you couldn't put it there nobody else could put a pair your mom and your dad can't put that seed there but because you have it you have recognized the light for the hour you are the only people who can go in a Rapture is you who have recognized the light of your age you have been hidden you've been set in a secret place the most high you're under the shadow of his wings why because you are the called out set aside predestinated body of Jesus Christ how do we know that a prophet came and fulfilled the scripture because he preached what the scripture says and the scripture said he would come you say well I don't have to believe that because I believe it's okay just to go to the Baptist Church well it may be if there's no seed there be the best Baptist you can be but let me tell you something if there's a seed there you can run as far as you want to try to run but it will not run far enough where the light can't find it you see these young people that once that they go out in the world they were in the message they might have had the most emotional experience you could ever find at a youth camp and I believe in it but that's not what's going to hold them until the end but when the word strikes the seed on the inside brother I don't care how much stuff on the internet I don't care how many people are trying to pull them to and fro once the word and the seed strike each other you can't pull them away you can't run them off you can't keep them away I'll tell you what they might go to church and there might be some correction come across the pulpit you can't run them off why because they are word-borne seed and when the word strikes it something is connected there and you can't get away from it I got two minutes is that all right I'm out of time I promise you brother Bram talks about the attributes being expressed and I'll just go this and I'll quit program said and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in Christ that's a paradox before there even was a world God thought of you he not only knew your end but he knew your beginning and he knew every moment in between you know I think we don't give enough credit where credit's due I wonder if sometimes we don't just completely forget Who We Are give yourself a little credit you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you don't have to be downtrodden you don't have to allow depression to stay you don't even have to allow sickness to stay in your body because you don't realize that God has already given you a spirit of authority in you oh I hope you're hearing me now I'll close with this the very spirit that was in Christ is the very Authority that is in the bride you can do the same Works everything he did is in you I know I preached this a couple weeks ago but I want to just remind you of something don't ever settle for second place when God has given you full authority to walk all over the devil brother Bill Satan might attack you in your body buddy but he cannot I said he cannot overtake you until it's your time nobody can take you out because you are a son of God predestinated he knew your beginning date he knows you're in pain nothing can happen between then that's not ordained of God brother let me tell you that'll take the fear of sickness that'll take the fear of all these diseases in the world away from you because not until God is done with you and exactly the date he saw you expire and leave this earth then he and nobody can take you out of here he said well the devil's trying to take me out he can't do it the devil's trying to he's trying to kill me he can't kill you because God has already seen you and in and he's already come to give you an end that he knows about I'll tell you brother let's give up on letting the devil have so much credit and let's give credit to the authority that is in the Bride of Jesus Christ we're more than conquerors because we believe the age we're living in is more than just a bunch of jellyfish well praise the Lord we have been put here on this Earth and we've been given a sword a sword we've been given that we've been given a helmet we've been given a full body armor and you might as well just go ahead and walk all over the devil one time and tell him Satan you might find you know the devil was fighting with a headache since last night and he's tried to fight me through this whole thing and I can stand here now and tell you the headache's gone and I praise the Lord for it listen to me Church Satan is nothing but a bluff he's going to try to hold you down he's going to tell you when you're when your kid makes their first mistake well maybe they're not seed don't ever think that put the token on that family put the token over that child and just believe God for it this is the day brother we need to be putting the blood back on the doorpost we need to be showing up and doing what God wants us to do to fulfill the scriptures and the word of our hour this is not a rule and a law this is not something that you have to do but brother just let the word of God let it guide you into the truth of the hour and it will make you manifest the son of the hour because you are fulfilling all the promises of the hour aren't you thankful for that we are the word made flesh today we are the only living body of Christ that there is today that's who we are my time's up musicians go ahead and come let's Stand Together I wonder I know we haven't been here that long but I want to ask you a question is there anybody here that just wants to just wants to praise the Lord for a minute would you like to give the devil a black eye for just a minute I wonder if we couldn't just tell the Devil he's defeated on this Sunday afternoon he don't have to stay around here you know the devil don't like no praising God around here but we don't care what the devil don't like do
