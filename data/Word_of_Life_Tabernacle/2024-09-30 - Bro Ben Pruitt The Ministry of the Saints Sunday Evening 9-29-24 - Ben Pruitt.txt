today and enjoy that service this morning morning my brother Stewart did a wonderful job and some things he preached there to the families and things maybe we go back and listen to those if you weren't here it was very very good and uh put my my full uh uh weight and Behind these brothers because they I believe they're men of God who preach the word of God and and uh we want to hear from them every chance we get 1 Corinthians 16 and 15 I want to speak to you tonight on something just on my heart as a pastor and I trust it'll be a blessing to you titled this the ministry of the Saints I beseech you Brethren you know the house of stefanus that it is the first fruits of aaya and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the Saints it's kind of a a different scripture I trust it'll be a blessing to you pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the the word you may be seated tonight enjoyed that song very much sister Emily I I really did I just I've been thinking about that lately uh sister Fritz my goodness it's good to see you back in the house of the Lord today God bless you it's been a several weeks since she's been with us I think or at least that I was here so I sure appreciate you being here today and and each one of you being with us sister Sophie uh being with us today I I think you were here Wednesday but it's good to see you back in the house of the Lord and doing better doing well amen we we believe God's our healer don't we amen amen the word uh Mi uh ministry here is service it's di is the is the original word is where we get our word Deacon refers to a Ministry or a service either waiting on others or a Ministry in the church it describes several different actions in its most basic form it can refer to the simple servitude that a person would provide when someone was visiting his or her house so you might say Hospitality Hospitality but it's more than that it's it's a waiting it's a attendance on someone it's literally attending to the Saints waiting on them service to them the way a waiter would at a restaurant and so you're watching to see uh if there's a need if you've been to a restaurant a nice restaurant one of the worst things you can do is pay good money for a meal and get terrible service because you're s you're sitting there and you're waiting and uh and you're waiting on uh the food and then it takes forever and no one checks on you you want somebody to check on you and that's what this means is that you're literally being checked on or checking on others the ministry of the Saints and this word comes from Acts chapter 6 and verse one as well when the uh number of disciples was multiplied and and of course whenever you get a bunch of people together people start to Grumble and because we're human beings and sometimes we get out of sorts and we get disgruntled and and things like that uh and they did in the early church they had the Holy Ghost but they were still humans and and so they uh as they begin to grow they there begin to be problems in the church because the widows were neglected or it seemed that the Greek widows were neglected because the Hebrews took care of their own first and and so what happened is that the 12 that's the the apostles called the multitude of disciples unto them and said it's not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables he said wherefore Brethren he said look you out among you uh seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business that was the first deacons now we know that deacons can actually be preachers as well as brother Stuart is a deacon and a preacher because you remember Stephen and how he got stoned for preaching the gospel he was a deacon he was a deacon but he was also an evangelist and and he preached the word and he got stoned for it and hopefully that won't happen to brother Stewart but but the first Deacon that was a preacher got stoned but but this was a uh this was a service or in their job as a deacon that were servants and and in act 64 it says but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word so there's a different Ministry the ministry of the word is different from the ministry of uh Ministry of the Saints now brother brandham taught us that if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach a and people have asked me brother Ben why do you preach why why bother preaching why not just play tapes because you read a lot of quotes anyway and I do read a lot of quotes I'm aware of that so why do you bother preaching well because a prophet of God told me a Vindicated Prophet told me that if I'm a preacher I'm called to the pulpit and this is a Pulpit to preach so I'm doing what God told me to do I'm doing what he told me to do through a Vindicated prophet and so I'm not going to listen to any minor Prophet any preacher any other thing tell me that I can't stand behind the pulpit and preach because that's exactly what a prophet called me to do so if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach a preacher also needs to know what he's talking about how many can say Amen to that tonight we need to know what we're talking about so so the apostles told the deacons they said we need somebody to help us because we need to get our spend our time studying the word and we need to spend our time in prayer and we need to have a uh we need to make sure that when we get up we've got something to say we're not just sitting up there stand up there talking but we've got something to say because we realize that the lives of the people that we preach to are held in the balance we realize that when people leave the church they're either going to be better or worse when they go out right they're either going to be better or worse every service and we realize that and so we recognize that we hold that in the balance and so we want to make sure that we've got something to say that's going to help somebody so we don't spend our time all of our time in entertainment we don't spend all of our time out in the woods we don't spend all our time although that'd be a good place sometimes to pray but we don't spend all our time doing other things we spend our time in the in studying the word and the reason we do that and praying is so we have something to say when we get behind the pulpit so we maximize our time behind the pulpit it's not how long you preach but it's what you got to say so brother Brandon said if you're a preacher get you a Pulpit and and you know the quote and I won't read it all tonight but if you're if you're not he said you need to live your sermon now how many non preachers do we have here today you're not a preacher at least not yet right and so what are you supposed to do live your sermon live your sermon you say well if we had better sermons then maybe we'd be more a church that's more on fire well that's probably true and God help me to preach better but I'll say this if we had better living we'd probably we we'd probably have a whole lot more better church as well and we we want to be the best we can be don't we and so we want to we want to live our sermons we want our life to be a a preaching to the people around us let my life preach to my family let my life let my my my lived life as a husband preached to my wife and my lived life as a father preached to my children so if you don't if you're not a preacher don't try to be a preacher just live your sermon and brother br tells us he said you Brethren do that in your churches do that do what preach he said remember he said sometimes a lady tries to explain things so brother brandom teaches us and I'm just going through some principles here before we get to really what we want to talk about brother brandom tells us that if a preacher uh is uh if you don't know what you're talking about that you need to let somebody that does know what they're talking about talk right so you know I like to join conversations I don't know about you but I I enjoy that I I go up to some you know conversation going on and sometimes y'all are talking about hunting bow hunting or something like that and I'll sit there and Nod let's see if I know what you're talking about and I really don't have a clue right because I've never hunted maybe I shouldn't admit that I've hunted squirrels but I've never been out in the woods looking for a for a deer you may disown me from the message after that but I've never done that I don't understand the passion I don't understand it so you know what you're talking about I don't know what I'm talking about and I can join the conversation but I can really mess it up too because it'll it won't take you long to figure out that I don't know what I'm talking about and so if there's something you don't understand don't try to teach that to somebody else right if you don't understand it yourself but you but every one of us has the option of saying I may not understand it but I believe every word that the Bible says so I'm going to take you to my pastor I'm going to take you to somebody else who actually understands the word and knows these things right if we don't if we can't explain it we don't need to try we just need to believe it right and study it ourselves now you know maybe brother B said you might make a bigger mess than you ever was in and make somebody worse off than ever if you do that and so he said let the pastor do that because people tie you in knots because you don't understand what you're talking about so you got to be called to the ministry of the word right there there there's a difference in the ministry of the Saints and the ministry of the word you've got to be called to the ministry of the word Full Gospel businessmen in Jamaica when brother Brandon was there they tried to put businessmen in the pulpit and as the main speakers in the meeting and brand said the business men was trying to preach the gospel he said he's out of his place he said we preachers have had enough time to keep it level and he said they use every little influence they can find and every little technique this way and that way and keep it so scrupled up you don't know what to do right and and we got a problem even even today pastors try to use influence and they try to use money and they try to use things like that why they're businessmen at heart right and they don't really care about the people it's not about that it's about how can I use this situation but I'm here to tell you if you get a god- calleded man and God called Men Behind the pulpit they'll care about you not about your money not about what you can do but about you God help us to be that way today so he said they keep it so scrupled up he said but the thing to do is protect the message and the way it's going stay right with it and knock everything away from it how many want to do that tonight I just want to I just want to block for the one carrying the ball I want to block for the message of the hour I I don't see myself as having a message I there's been a message coming my day and I want to block for it so brother brandom talked about these businessmen and he said Brethren there's something wrong you fellas are businessmen he said the first place you don't don't understand the approach because there's an approach to Ministry you don't understand the approach because the ministry is a god-called gift we don't just walk up here and start talking but it's hours of preparation hours of prayer are you with me now time spent with God time spent studying over what would help the church and I don't just walk up here and say something but it's time to that we spend in doing that and so it's a Ministry and it's a burden and sometimes I wish I didn't have to do it but I'm compelled to do it you might be able to talk real good but you don't understand the approach of the ministry without being gifted to that and so brother brandom taught us that God s in the church Apostles and Prophets and teachers evangelists and pastors where didd he get that Ephesians 4:11 he said God set them in there for the perfecting of the church but he told us that we could all testify right don't try to be a preacher live your message but if you want to if you want to help somebody be like the woman at the well and tell what God did for you and she may not have known everything but when the son of man was revealed to her she said I know one thing this is the one come see a man that told me the secrets of my heart listen if your life has ever been changed by the word of God you can testify and tell others come see a man every one of us ought to be able to do that that's not just reserved for the men that's not just reserved for the for the ones who've been in church for 50 years but that's each and every one of us can say come see a message come find the message that I found cuz it changed my life it made me different it brought me into a new place in Christ every one of us ought to do that that's what the house of stefanus was addicted to not to preaching but to Ministry of the Saints it didn't say they were addicted to the ministry of the word although that would be a good thing to be addicted to study and and to put your life into that but this was to the ministry of the Saints or the service of the Saints the Bible teaches us in 1 Corinthians 12:4 there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all and all what notice what Paul recognizes differences in gifts the word there is charisma that's where we get the word charismatic because they believe in the gifts so are are you with me this afternoon I know Sunday afternoon is hard that's why I've been trying to preach more of them because I'm trying to take the load off these other brothers that and I just got in from Branson this morning from that meeting so gifts are Charisma administrations is De it's deacons administrations operations is enima which is activity so there's a difference in how you're are gifted how you serve and with what effort you serve right and we've all seen that right this is just common sense stuff Paul says there's a difference in gifts right because even among evangelists there's different kinds of evangelists even among pastors there's one Pastor who's real quiet and one who's real loud and one who cries all the time and one who hardly ever cries and and and that's not what we judge it by we judge it by the word right and and the results the fruit that the man bears in his life but we don't judge it by the diversity of the gift but it's all the same spirit so there's a difference in gifts there's a difference in administrations there's a difference in uh in service so we're not all called to do the same thing but we are all called to do something right we're all called to do something but we're not all called to do the same something so then operations is is effort so even if you had somebody who was now who is gifted in a certain way and maybe they're gifted in a similar way to some somebody else then you look and see that they're not only gifted in a certain way but they serve in a certain capacity so say he's a pastor or an evangelist or a deacon so they're both gifted the same way they both have the same uh same gift they both have the same Administration but then there's a difference in effort right and the effort is what's going to make the difference in how the people are helped are you with me now I say we might as well give it all to Christ we might as well give everything that we've got because some people can be gifted and have uh administrations and have gifts like that but not put in the effort that's needed in that gift I say whatever gift it is that you've been given whatever calling that you have whatever way that you can serve you ought to give everything that you have it would be a shame to to whatever gift that we have to mail it in because we thought well it doesn't matter anyhow he wouldn't have given you the gift if it didn't matter he wouldn't have made you you if you didn't matter brother Landon he's got something for you to do he wouldn't have made you Landon if you if you didn't if there wasn't something you could do he put you he made you a certain way so that you would have a certain gift and we need to put all the effort we can into that right that's most what makes the difference many times in a successful Ministry and a failed Ministry is effort it's true there's nine spiritual gifts we know that five Ministry gifts countless other Ministries that keep the church going brother brandom says each one of us someone say each one each one of us has a different Ministry you ever think about you coming to church as a minister that gonna get real quiet after a while think about it see I come to church I pray all right I get here two hours early usually and I try to pray and I'm not saying that to brag it's just because I feel it's necessary cuz I tell you what I got to do is I got to get me out of the way right if I get too much in the way there's going to be problems in the service and I got a lot more to get out of the way than some other people do there's a lot more of me so I need I I need to work to get myself out of the way but if you ever thought about what you do in the church as a Ministry to the Saints a Ministry to the Saints so it's something that you do for the Saints and you might be a young person today say well I I don't really do anything but you do have some Ministry to the Saints you say well I don't even talk much you do have some Ministry to the Saints because there's a lot more Ministries than what you realize brother Brandon says he says each one of you is a Ministry a separate Ministry all that comes into Christ how many are in Christ tonight you believe you're in Christ then you have a Ministry all that are in Christ has a Ministry he said not all will have a Ministry all has a Ministry he said not only the preacher but you have a Ministry to something you have a Ministry to something something you can do he said and I hope this don't sound sacrilegious but usually God has to drive you into your correct Ministry so it's not usually you that's looking for it it's not you that's trying to be a pastor trying to be a teacher or trying to be a deacon or something like that but he said usually God has to drive you into your correct Ministry look what he had to do to Paul Paul didn't he wasn't looking for God he thought he had God he thought he he learned everything there was to learn and he knew everything there was to know and God put him in such a place where he had to cry out to God he said Lord is it you and God said Paul it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks he said I got something a Ministry for you in your life and it's it's hard for you to just keep sitting there and acting like you're you're a bump on a log it's hard for you to keep resisting my will Paul it's time for you to step into what God has called you to do and to do that Paul you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost so go up to a street called straight and meet a man named ananas so you can be filled with the Holy Ghost so you can do your ministry I think it's about time we get some people fill with the Holy Ghost so we can do our Ministries each individual I want you to make this very personal tonight has a specific and peculiar Ministry something only you can do now brother brandom tells us that we're not like the Catholic Church where somebody just tells us what to do and we do it right that's not who we are what we are is is we're son of God and he says The Great I Am the almighty God has come as Spirit to fill his true church he said he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men amongst us right so again I'm not the only Minister here tonight every one of us are ministers every one of us we may not be Ministers of the word but we're minister miners of something we're ministers to the body of Christ look he said we don't make any holy men but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is he the holy spirit that is Holy he said not the congregation of itself now I begin thinking about this and I begin to think what are some Ministries in the congregation whether there's a Ministry of giving right there are some people who are anointed to keep the lights on right they're anointed in business they're anointed in that way and again you can't look at somebody else who's anointed in that way and say I wish I was more that way I wish I had more money to give no you do what God's called you to do right but some people are anointed in that way and they may sit back and think well you know I never get to I never get to do this or that in the church but they're Anointed with something that help that they can help the body of Christ and they don't even realize how much they help the body of Christ but they're just anointing Ed with a Ministry of giving maybe not just giving to the church but giving to one another Anointed with the ability to see a need and go feel that need I pray there' be more of us Anointed with that Ministry today right and I've seen some of you and I don't want to start calling names because I'll I'll make you know you you tend to make people wonder well when is he going to call my name but I've seen some of you that have a Ministry of giving and you just know when it's when there's something that's needed and you give that something there's a Ministry of hospitality right some people can make people feel welcome and it's harder for others it's more difficult for others I think young men need to learn how to be hospitable you young people need to learn how to be hospitable something we learn right it's not something that comes naturally to everybody and yet there are some people gifted or that have a service a type of ministry that they do they just open up their home and they open up I believe my wife just I'll mention her uh because uh God gave me a good wife I believe she has a Ministry of hospitality that that she just wants to do and she knows how to take care of people and and take care of food and things like that and there's a Ministry of prayer how many believe that tonight A Ministry of prayer oh I pray there'd be more there'd be more Prayer Warriors come out of the church we got some but I've noticed a lot of the prayer warriors are getting older it's time for the young people to step up and be prayer warriors right be people who pray and cry out to God for the service that's coming what would we do without some of our elders who cry out to God and hold on the horns of the Altar and say Lord I want to see these young people help what would you do without that I pray God would raise up another generation of Prayer Warriors that could stand in the Gap and be and do their Ministry of prayer there's ministries of cleaning huh right we don't hand out titles because that's not what it's about but some people are just just have the neck and the ability and the time maybe to help clean the church some people have a ministry of food praise God for that and there's others who don't right and maybe that's not your ministry but you sure benefit from it right and so a person whose Ministry might be cleaning their Ministry is not cooking food but they can clean my Ministry is neither one but you know I'll do it but that's not my ministry right but but but some of y'all you know it's just there's something about it it's easy for you to clean you enjoy that but you hate to cook and some of you hate to clean but you love to cook my mother's like that she's not here so I can talk about her mom always kept a clean house but if she cooks it's a mess and and because she got a ministry of food are you with me now many of you do thank God for that we got Ministries with the youth it's a Ministry it's a burden that comes on your heart see I want to help our young people let me just talk about that for a minute we need more people to step up and realize what our young people are going through it's one thing to criticize them it's another thing to step there and say what can I do how can I open up my home say brother Ben we need to have more youth meetings while I'm waiting on somebody to call one are you with me now we can have the youth over to our house that'd be all right we we can we can help the young people we can we can give them an encouraging word there's people that have a Ministry for that they they understand young people I know there's some people don't like to be around young people make them nervous and that's okay but there's some who have a Ministry for it and thank God somebody opened up their home to you when you were young and somebody helped you if you were raised in the church when you were young thank God somebody did that that's a Ministry oh my it's a Ministry there's a Ministry of music here in the church that's a Ministry aren't you glad for our music that's a Ministry it's not something that just happens it's not something that you can just achieve if you've never practiced it's a Ministry of music and it has to be prayerful and it has to be uh somebody with a consecrated life we don't just throw anybody up here we put people up here that we believe are are just as consecrated as the minister as the pastor's consecrated as the associate as the Deacon as brother Stewart all the brothers are consecrated these Ministers of music are just as consecrated what are they doing they're ministering to the lord they're providing a service to God and to God's people hallelujah there's Ministries back there in the back right and our young people have taken the brunt of that over the last uh five years since I've been here my kids have been back there and then others have joined them the young people have joined them I say you know maybe some of us adults need to recogn ize that and sometimes we get we stay home on Wednesdays maybe because you're tired and that's sometimes you get sick and you can't come but you like to be able to stream don't you huh somebody does that these young men sitting up here do that those ladies in the back do that but Justin P's helping us uh whenever we can on on uh on sound here in the church somebody's got to do that but the Gabe when he when he's able to be here and he's here most of the time he helps us with that so there's there a Ministry of that there's Ministries in the uh in the sound booth Ministries the video he said that stuff doesn't matter we could just shut it all off well you'd appreciate it if you had to use it if you were shut in and not able to come to church you'd appreciate that Ministry being there oh that somebody had it on their heart and that's what we want it to be and that's why I want to present it this way I don't want it just to be a drudgery I don't want somebody to do it just because I asked them to do it or because they had to do it but something that's on your heart say you know what I think I'll help the Young people tonight I think I'll learn how to do something in the church so some of the young people can sit out front and say Amen loudly I think I'll just help out I think I'll I think I'll I think I'll help maybe the musicians or help do something on that and sometimes if we're not gifted to it we can't be much help but if you are gifted to it if you're gifted to singing special songs for goodness sake start singing are you with me now we need more music we need and and nobody's going to come to you and and beg you to do it right it's got to be something that you want to do in your heart there's got to be something in your heart says Lord I want this to be a good service listen you can have a good service or you can have a bad service you get to choose there's a Ministry of amens oh that God would call an army of Amen ERS I wish these young people you know some of them you know what happens is they get and that's why sometimes they come back from camp and they're all excited and then they get around us and they're like well come on Church there's a Ministry of amens there's something that that happens brother brandom says and I know people don't like it but brother random said that when he said he said that man come to him and said how can you preach with them people screaming like that he said that makes chills run up my back and brother Brandon said I can't hardly preach if they don't do it he said by the way if you make it to Heaven you'll freeze to death are you with me now he said I had an old dog named Fritz excuse me sister Fritz but he said I had an old dog named Fritz and he said I would he said I would send that dog after a skunk he said he tree just about anything go in after anything but a skunk and with a skunk he had to have a little bit of encouragement amen so so oh old Fritz would run down to the to the hole where the skunk he just stand there and brother brand said sick them boy what was he doing he's saying say Amen sick them boy it's not wrong for a preacher to do that to pull for amens why because that's what he was doing to the dog he had to give it some encouragement can anybody say Amen can can I get an amen what's he doing he's he's pulling that from the dog he's encouraging that dog and that dog go right in after him and and that's brother brandom actually tped the preacher to the dog in the way that he typed it actually the preacher is going in after it because the people are saying sick them boy oh we need a hundred more you know how much better Services would be if we' lift our voice every now and then and say go after that devil go get him I know somebody that needs that and it's [Applause] me not everybody's loud but some people have a Ministry of amens and they need to quit hiding their light under a bushel huh I can mention many more but you get the idea you might say brother Ben I'd like to do something but I don't know what to do do what you can do and do that until you find God's perfect will I I made some services I don't I don't do anything I I sit here and I watch everything just run so perfectly and I sitting there and think thank God I'm so happy to be here you know but I still try to back to preach whether I feel good or whether I don't whether I'm sick or whether I'm not still trying to back the preacher and I'll tell you what I can do I can pick up trash on the parking lot are you with me now somebody's got to do it and so when I'm not doing what I'm called to do let me do what I can do and be willing to volunteer when I see a need and I think of Simon and I've preached to you about him many times before but it's special to me Simon in the Bible had a Ministry of cross carrying but he didn't know what his ministry was going to be he had no clue he was probably a middle-aged man and he didn't have a clue what his ministry would be he had come to Jerusalem for some reason maybe he was a a prite from he was a black man from Africa maybe he was a prite to the Jewish religion and he'd come down there for the festival or maybe come down on some kind of business and he'd come down into the City and the Bible tells us that that he met Jesus at a Crossroads he met him at an intersection and when he saw him Jesus at that moment had fallen down because he was too weak to carry the cross and if he didn't carry the cross what would happen our sins wouldn't be forgiven nothing about us would be changed we'd be the same as we always were we'd still be a bunch of heathens out there the world as we know it wouldn't exist there would be no love and joy and peace flowing from the from the throne because the cross would not have paid for our sins but because Simon carried the cross he didn't know that would be his ministry but what did he do he saw a need and somebody asked him to do it and he did it why he could do it he was able he was compelled to do it a soldier doesn't fight because he wants to not often he fights because it's his duty and he fights for the person beside him listen to me young men fight for your brothers huh you young ladies fight for your sisters you said I don't feel like much going like going to church today fight for somebody sitting beside you I don't feel like getting into the service today fight for the person in the Pew beside you fight for the pastor fight for his family fight for the church are you with me now fight for somebody else cuz they say when it really gets down to it why do Marines run to the sound of gunfire it's not because they're all patriotic and running into their country what are they doing there were some of you are veterans you know what I'm talking about you're doing it for that guy beside you you don't want to let him down the Romans would actually set up their Legions in a what was called a Turtle formation and they would set him up and they each one would have a shield but he didn't hold the shield over himself he would hold it over his brother over his friend and so each one was interested in keeping his friend and his cohort there in the army he was interested in keeping him strong he was interested you know they they get together for breakfast and this one's asking the other one saying what did you eat your weed said did you get plenty to eat why because he knew that that would be the arm that held the shield that protected him oh God if we could only realize in the church many times when we help somebody else we're actually strengthening the arm that helps us we don't just go to church for ourselves where did we ever get that idea where we ever get the idea that church was just a place like a candy store where we went and bought some peace and some love and some joy and took it home and didn't share it church is a place of service service to God and service to one another see when you're when you're compelled you don't quit you don't just quit the Army and we're in the army of the Lord brother brandom you know you know how hard he fought who' he do that for read Malachi 4 behold I send you me that means a lot to me that God sent a prophet for me and he went through what he went through for me and that happened in our generation he couldn't die for you Jesus died for you but I'm glad for what he did do he did what could do he was called to be a prophet brother brandham said this at the end of his life story and I've probably read it to you before but it's just stirring in my heart today brother brand was praying and he got to where he couldn't talk no more because he was so broke up remembering his wife that had died and his daughter that had died you think God's people don't go through something just look at a prophet look what God let him go through what's he doing he's molding your character he's not God is way more interested in your character than he is your bank account he's way more interested in your character than he is something else going on and whether or not you're at ease and whether you're not you you got a new dishwasher or a new he's way more interested in your character so sometimes he allows those things to be held from us while he works on us and brother brandom remember he telling the story about how his baby had been there and and that that black sheet went down God had answered his prayers many times for babies but would not in that occasion and it touched him so much he saw his baby's eyes crossed with pain and he said that he said if ever a cross-eyed baby come in the prayer line he said they didn't even have to be prayed for they were healed because he had a little compassion in him because of what he'd been through he says oh God have mercy I just think back across the streaks of tears and heartaches and troubles oh father I'm ashamed of all my life he said why didn't I know you before other words he was so so broken by all of his life and things he and brother BR started serving God as a relatively young man but he said oh but in one place he said if I was raised in a Christian home he said I could have been a lot farther along some of you you don't know the opportunity that lays before you and brother Brandon says oh father he said I'm ashamed of all my life why didn't I know you before and I've tried with all all my heart dear Jesus to live for you I wonder how many of us can say that tonight I I hope it's me I hope it's you I've tried with all my heart dear that don't mean you've never made a mistake brother Brandon made mistakes everybody's made mistakes but Jesus but I've tried with all of my heart to live for you to do the thing what thing what needed to be done what I was called to do oh Church let me do it with all of my heart as a pastor I want to rededicate myself to doing everything that I can to preaching as hard as I can to to to to counseling as much as I can to working as much as I can for you to helping to studying as much as I can to picking up trash as much as I can what can I do what can I do let me have that kind of a heart God help us today we get caught up with friends we get caught up in with entertainment we call but Lord what can I do for you oh if you children could be raised if you young people could be raised with a harder service think what this church could be I love our church I love what it is but think how much better we could be what how much more we could be what how much we could grow I'm not talking about in numbers but I'm talking about in stature and in power as a Powerhouse of the Living God think what we could be if each one of us was addicted to the ministry of the Saints brother brandom says I don't care no matter what this cross is or how scornful it seems to be I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over here's the attitude to have church but I love you for it because without the Heartbreak I couldn't help people without being raised the way I was raised I might not be able to help people and if we ever get the attitude of receiving just to the point where we're just wait watching for people not to help us we're waiting and saying why don't anybody help me why don't anybody help me help somebody in the meantime while you're waiting on someone to help you do what you can say all I do is Tinker with engines find an engine to Tinker with that would help somebody all I can do is work well work with all of your heart I believe men ought to work with all of their heart huh not halfway it's a it's a sin to be lazy right because the Bible tells us a man won't provide for his own own is worse than an Infidel right but what do we do we do it with all our heart we may not be called to you know I don't know if anyone was ever called to work at McDonald's but I've been there and done it are you with me now that's not forever but do with all your heart why you work for the Lord the Bible says do it as unto the Lord you've broken my heart over and over but I love you for it oh Church the apostles one time come to Jesus and they they said 'lord increase our faith how many want to have more faith I think all of us do the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed right that would be uncompromised faith that won't mix with anything also very small it's a very small seed he said you might say unto this pamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you but he immediately goes into service because I think he recognizes that they're asking for something that would be you know where people could see that they had Faith right he said but which of you having a servant they they want to be thanked for their faith they want to be applauded for their faith he said' but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle we'll say unto him by and by when he's come from the field go and sit down to meet so other words you go sit down and I'll take care of the oxen he's the servant are you with me now you don't say oh I I'll just let you off early and I'll take care of it now you might do that out of the goodness of your heart but you won't do it very often what right that's his job and we not rather saying to him make ready wherewith I may Su so he just got in from the field go clean yourself up and be a waiter guard thyself and serve me till I have eaten and drunken and afterward Thou shalt eat and drink do he think that servant because he did the things that were commanded him he said I TR not he's talking about natural people right talking about carnal people the way they work you don't think people for doing that it's just what they do they're you're paying them for it huh he said so likewise ye I'm not saying you shouldn't thank them I'm saying it's the way people are so likewise ye said when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you I don't know if I've ever done that are you hearing me I don't know if I've ever done every single thing that God ever told me to do you said that's a shocking admission brother brandham didn't either that's why he didn't kill the brown bear go read the message he said he wasn't in the right place at the right time where God told him to be that's what he said right so what what was happening what's happening I don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever done everything but he said if you did do everything if you did everything to the letter that you've been commanded to do you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do listen to me I will not be rewarded simply for preaching I that's what I was born to do not very well but that's what I was born to do right it's a gift it's predestined I'm not rewarded just for that where do my rewards come from from going above and beyond right from excelling from helping from lifting up the weak from binding up the broken heart that's where my reward comes from it's from that I don't know about you did you realize that we're going to a rewards banquet how many if you've ever been to a high school awards banquet and and you've ever sat there or with or we've been to Elementary School Banquets you know and or or something like that you sit there and you wait on your name to be called I remember one year excuse me Peter I one year uh Peter was in a Awards deal ceremony and we were sitting in the stands you know and I was so proud because I thought well he's done pretty good this year I think so I thought he's gonna get his name called and so they called the you know but I kind of thought about what his grade would be because he'd had some stuff he didn't get done so I thought you know what he'd always made the honor rooll and I thought well he'll make the be on a roll and so they called the be on a roll and he wasn't on it Oh I thought my goodness there's all these kids you know half the glasses on be on a roll at least it's a good story Peter don't be worried you probably remember it you were there and and then they did something else then they called the the aonor roll and I thought well surely the aonor roll he'll be on that and they called it and he wasn't there I thought well I gave up I thought well he's just not going to win anything this year I kind of I'll be honest with you I was a little mad because I know what he can do right the boy's got a 4.0 GPA when he when he studies you know when he does his work when he just does the work and and I know that and I just irritates me you know some of you parents know what I'm talking about this was many several years ago but he you know he wasn't on that role and I just quit paying attention and I saw him get up thought what happened well they called the A+ honor roll I'll be honest with with you when I get to heaven that's the one I want to be on I may not be but that's the one I want to strive for I want to be on that one I I want to go I want to go to the eight plus on a roll even the people give up on me even if people don't believe I can do it let me serve God in such a way let me tell you there's going to be some mothers here that are on the A+ honor roll in heaven there's going to be some Elders here who prayed with all of their heart who going to be on the A+ honor roll in heaven maybe some preachers down there on the I don't know if there's a c on a roll or a d on a roll but down there at the bottom because they didn't go above and beyond to help God's people say God help us today see the house of stefanus was addicted to Ministry are you still with me I got just a few more minutes because they were the first Christians in that part of Asia they did it because there was no one else to do it which is why Peter learned sound and video and Esther learned to run video and I'm just opening it up to you but why we do the things that we do because there was just nobody else to do it right and not because people people are busy and or they're older and it's very hard for sorry but it's very hard to teach some people how to work on electronics you know some of y'all could want so badly to help in that area and you just couldn't help but young minds are adaptable to that and so they helped in that why because there was nobody else to do it doesn't mean that's the only gift in their lives it just means that's what they did these other young people who helped brother trip and brother Landon and noie and Levi and the ones that have helped us so many times what have they helped for because they're they needed to it felt the need to step in but I wonder if maybe somebody could get a burden and give them a break they were compelled listen I was compelled I didn't want to be a preacher but it's just what I could do I'm being honest with you I was preaching before I had the Holy Ghost proof you can do it without it it was a gift but Jesus is our sample in Ministry look look what he did he he said Jesus called them to him and said to them you know they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister a Ministry to the Saints and whosoever you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto he didn't come here to to be ministered unto but to minister to give his life for a ransom for many he did that and now we choose we want to minister to him because he came to minister oh church that kind of service is eternal life brother brand you say well I'm just not called to Ministry at all yes you are you're called to some kind of ministry everybody is because you have eternal life and brother brand said Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself you lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day that day on Calvary you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become Sons Hallelujah he said the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others listen who did he live and die for he lived and died for me for you he lived and died for the Gentiles who spat in his face the soldiers who beat him the Pharisees who crucified him said father forgive them they don't know they don't know what they did what they're doing what was it he he gave his life as a ransome for us oh my and brother brother we've got to follow that example the Bible says we must follow his example we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ he said that he made the way that we could sacrifice oursel to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he lived there's no other way he said I am the way the truth and the life in Hebrews 5'8 it says he even learned obedience by the things which he suffered I don't even fully understand that but I believe it's true you said to look at somebody who gives his life and Spins his life for God's people and again I don't want to talk about it but it's just something that you do you just give your life and your life is going to meetings and helping people helping churches and and preaching and going and preaching and helping as much as you can if there's something that you need help with that I'm not helping you it's because I don't know about it and if I know about it I'll do my best I really will I really will do my best I may not be able to fix it but I want to at least be there but what is that we're trying to spend our lives you say what that's stupid but do you realize that if you just set yourself on a shelf you're going to rot there's a story about a great violinist that he said no one else is GNA ever touch my violin that's the way the Bas is gonna be when Al whenever Allison retires because she's really good at it you know and she could be like just set it up there and put it in a glass case and we'll feel like that because there's hardly anybody that can play the bass like that aren't you glad for good musicians I'm serious about that I go to churches all the time they can't play the bass so I'm glad we got a bass player but but if you set it on the Shelf you know what happens to it it rots and when the man set the violin on the Shelf pretty soon no one could have played it anyhow because if it's not used it'll fall out of service and it'll die and it'll rot listen to me Church I'd rather be used than to be in a glass case somewhere I'd rather be abused even I'd rather have people laugh at me and mock at me and everything else that they want to do but let me be used Lord I might do something wrong might do something that's not that's not even wouldn't be necessarily be right or and God will correct me on that but let me be used let me be somebody who gets up and tries again brother BR says just a life that lives in you you don't do it for Applause I'm skipping through these things now brother Robert you don't need Applause brother Robert sat back there for years and done that and I know that's very difficult for him to do but it's just it's a service it's something he can do he told me he want to keep doing it because it's something he can do oh I pray that we get that kind of Revelation tonight he said Christ just completely surrendered his life to God gave himself as a public servant to the people he gave his life freely he didn't have to do it he didn't begrudged do it he didn't say now Brethren you all ought to think a whole lot of me because I come to die for you he never said a word about it he died anyhow because it was God in him amen I'm going to skip on down listen they were addicted to Ministry a man who was addicted to alcohol will spend all that he has for one more bottle the will to have a drink is so much greater than the will than his will that he has no self-control and he'll tell you I want to quit but I can't don't ever start that's the best way to quit same with cigarettes but Jesus so surrendered his will to the father's will what was it he was addicted to Ministry to service this household of Stefanos was addicted and look at the difference it makes in your house it wasn't just his house I've said that many times about Simon Simon's children were known to the early church by on a firstname basis because they're written about in the scriptures because Simon carried the cross he made his family servants because stefanus addicted himself to the ministry of the Saints because they were the first ones in that area and they were just doing what jobs needed to be done what happened the people of God looked at them and said hey there's somebody and they actually got written about in the scriptures sometimes you don't have to preach to get noticed all you have to do is help people but we don't do it to get notice we do it because we must we're addicted to it Hebrews 12 tells us we look to him for an example the author and the finisher of our faith listen church I want to hear him say what he said in Matthew 25:21 well done how many want to hear that tonight well done thou good and faithful servant if you if you have a Bible that you mark in highlight that word faithful faithful we will be rewarded for our faithfulness not for our talent let me be spent in your service Lord Brother Ben why do you do what you do because it has to be done that's why I'm here in this church because I I felt the need I felt like it was God's will but I felt a need listen to me Church brother brand said nothing but lost souls musicians go ahead and come nothing but lost souls is the only thing that's got any value in it money passes away homes Decay and go away everything in the Earth moves away the only lasting value I'd rather have one soul in glory that I won to Christ to know and see that light of God circles around that Soul through all eternity he said my name to be associated with that well Paul what was the man's name that that met you in Africa Kenny Maya something like that brother Kenny we'll call him I don't know brother Kenny I've never met brother Kenny but but brother Paul son told me today that there's a G that he gave him I guess and he he has that on a mantle because Brother Paul's here today got baptized today because of a testimony of brother Kenny Who come out of the jungles of Africa sometime you need to tell the whole testimony but he come out of the jungles of Africa and and and felt led of the Lord to show up at Brother Paul's Place where he was managing in an oil in an oil rig and show up there and say the Lord told me you'd give me a job and sat there till he got the job is that right brother Kenny witnessed to brother Paul and Brother Paul's in church in Hardy Arkansas because brother Kenny was a servant we don't know if he was a preacher I don't know what else he's done but I'll tell you this all of his life Brother Paul's name will be associated with brother Kenny's name when we get a million years into Glory into heaven and we're sitting there a million years from now those two names will still be Associated together why because somebody took the time to not only tell brother Paul but to live the life and say that man was a Christian brother Paul tell you he knew he was a Christian because the kind of work he did not just what he said but he was faithful to his duty at on the job oh God I made him an effective witness I want my name I want somebody I wanted to be Associated if it's just one that's all right but I wanted it to be associated with at least one person you say but all I have is my children that's all I have influence on that's a name that's a name your name will be associate with your children all through eternity because you had faith for them you believed for them you took care of them you were a Godly mother a Godly father you read the Bible to them you had prayer time with them you weren't too busy that's what I want I want to sing that song do we know all I want to see is Jesus do we know that we not to try it brother Bram tells a story about a a man who went to to heaven and or he was he was dying he was a black man he was dying and he said his friend said brother are you waiting on your robe and Crown aren't you going to be glad to receive it he said' don't tell me about no robe and Crown don't do what I do for a Rob and Crown he was a minister a preacher I don't do what I do for Rob and Crown I'm not doing what I'm doing for recognition I pray that we're not doing what we do for recognition we're still human we want to be recognized but that's not why we do it he said don't tell me about no no Rob and Crown I may not be on the A+ honor roll but I want to be in heaven because he said all I want to do is sit there and look at him he said just let me look at him for a million years what if we have that kind of attitude tonight what if we could that all I want to see is Jesus all I want to see is Jesus that's who I was working for that's what when I'm ministering to you see when you minister to the Saints you're have a Ministry to Christ because we are his body on the earth say God help us today let us do it with all all our heart if it's coming to church if it's sitting in the Pew if it's praying if it's paying our tithes if it's whatever it is that we do let us do it with all of our heart not begrudgingly but God loves a cheerful Giver I'm not

I can help my brother help my sister and I don't mean just financially that may be part of it but very few of us can do that sometimes we try to fix the situation we help or we hurtt more than we help but maybe you can pray maybe you can reach out send a a card or some encouragement some of our folks live all the way in Jonesboro it's hard sometimes for us to get down there and fellowship with them like we should but but maybe we can do that make that [Music] effort we live a long ways from each other and life gets busy but sometimes just sitting across the table from one another means something we get so wrapped up in our own lives church that's not what it's about I don't care how much you know about this message if you can't serve others it does others no good I don't think it does you much good either said but brother man I can't serve him the way I want to well serve him how you can serve him in the capacity that you can serve him in and I believe God will bless you for that Heavenly Father Lord we want to have a Ministry to the Saints Lord I believe you've given me a Ministry of the word but Lord would you also Lord I want a Ministry to the Saints Lord I I want to go
