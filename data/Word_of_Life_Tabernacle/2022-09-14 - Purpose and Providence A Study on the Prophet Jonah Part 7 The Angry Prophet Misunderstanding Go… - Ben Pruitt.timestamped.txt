[44:38] this evening i'm going to finish the
[44:40] lord willing our
[44:42] teaching on jonah tonight and
[44:44] i trust it's been a blessing to you i
[44:46] know it has been to me
[44:48] and but there's several things that uh
[44:50] we want to say tonight and kind of
[44:52] wrap it up and then there's some other
[44:54] things i've got on my heart
[44:56] for sunday
[44:57] and then going into next week
[44:59] i want to thank you for allowing us to
[45:01] go
[45:02] to oklahoma as we usually do every year
[45:05] thank you for letting me go and and for
[45:08] letting brother joel go as well and we
[45:10] take
[45:10] a lot of our uh sound people with us and
[45:14] of course you might have noticed that on
[45:15] sunday but
[45:16] it actually wasn't the people here's
[45:18] fault that we had something that
[45:20] actually went out in the wiring and the
[45:22] electrical so it was brother danny's
[45:24] fault from 22 years ago so
[45:27] but uh no it was uh just something that
[45:29] happened so it seems like something
[45:30] always happens when you're gone but but
[45:32] i'm so glad that
[45:34] that you allowed us to do that and i get
[45:36] feel guilty every time i don't know if
[45:38] guilty is the right word when we're not
[45:39] here i don't feel right unless i'm here
[45:42] with you and
[45:44] i believe the lord's put that in my
[45:45] heart and i trust that you feel the same
[45:47] way that you want to be with the people
[45:48] of god is that your desire tonight
[45:50] that's why you're here you don't have
[45:52] any other ulterior motive you just want
[45:54] to be fellowship with the people of god
[45:55] around the word of god and to hear the
[45:57] word and and so that's what i'm here for
[45:59] as well and i trust it'll be a blessing
[46:02] to you uh friday evening brother matt
[46:04] morris is having a youth service if you
[46:06] a young person or or not or feel like a
[46:09] young person you want to go to that i'd

[46:39] situation there the brother that's going

[46:42] and they asked me to announce that
[46:44] we have a kids day this saturday here at
[46:47] the church for the sunday school kids
[46:48] and they're taking care of that i
[46:50] haven't dealt with that at all so i
[46:51] assume that's still happening but
[46:54] we're thankful for those that are
[46:55] working on that and have worked on that
[46:57] it's for our our kids our sunday school
[46:59] children so you remember that
[47:01] make it a priority to be in and have
[47:03] your kids and stuff like that in church
[47:05] it matters and it shows them what where
[47:07] your priorities are
[47:09] and
[47:09] and then
[47:10] sunday we'll speak to you sunday morning
[47:12] the lord willing and brother george
[47:14] moore will be with us again in the
[47:15] evening service he'll be traveling
[47:17] through so we'll have him again you love
[47:19] the lord tonight
[47:21] we're all caught up now jonah chapter 4
[47:24] and verse 1
[47:26] it said but it displeased
[47:28] jonah
[47:29] exceedingly
[47:31] and he was very
[47:33] angry
[47:35] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[47:37] to the word you may be seated
[47:42] he was very angry
[47:46] you know tempering itself isn't the
[47:48] problem
[47:49] it's what he was displeased at
[47:53] in itself temper is a is an emotion
[47:56] given to us from god
[47:58] uh it said that it was actually henry
[48:00] ward beecher the great abolitionist said
[48:02] that a man that does not know how to be
[48:04] angry does not know how to be good
[48:07] a man that does not know how to be
[48:08] shaken to his heart's core with
[48:10] indignation over things evil is either a
[48:13] fungus or a wicked man
[48:16] you've got to have some amount of of
[48:18] temper and jesus showed us that even
[48:21] when he used the whip and we've talked
[48:23] about that before and i've told you i
[48:26] feel like i couldn't do that because i
[48:28] would be getting the flesh at some point
[48:30] and i would overdo that i i would just
[48:32] take that opportunity to punish my
[48:34] enemies and
[48:35] and maybe whip a little bit too hard or
[48:37] do something like that and i'm sure most
[48:39] of us are in that same boat tonight but
[48:41] jesus could do that without sin
[48:44] and so that was the difference in him
[48:46] and any other mortal but and so
[48:49] someone else has said anyone can become
[48:51] angry that's easy but to be angry with
[48:54] the right person to the right degree at
[48:57] the right time and in the right way
[48:59] that's not
[49:00] easy i tell you who you should be angry
[49:03] at most of the time as yourself
[49:07] the bible tells us be angry and sin not
[49:09] let not the sun go down
[49:11] upon your wrath
[49:13] and and and what that is paul is
[49:15] actually quoting the old testament
[49:17] that's psalms 4 4 he's quoting it from
[49:19] the greek translation of the scripture
[49:21] where it says stand in awe and sin not
[49:24] commune with your own heart upon your
[49:26] bed and be still
[49:28] and what that means that stand in all
[49:30] means to tremble so you can be so mad
[49:32] that you're shaking
[49:35] you say a christian could get that mad
[49:37] yes
[49:39] you could be so angry that you were
[49:40] trembling with anger but don't let it
[49:43] consume you
[49:46] be careful or anger will destroy you
[49:49] and so paul goes on to say in ephesians
[49:51] 4 27 neither give place to the devil so
[49:55] that's why what he's saying he said
[49:56] don't don't go to bed angry don't don't
[49:58] let it consume you at night don't don't
[50:00] let it don't wake up with it on your in
[50:02] your thoughts in the morning because all
[50:04] it'll do is cause you trouble yeah amen
[50:07] and he said don't give place to the
[50:09] devil don't give room for the devil let
[50:11] all bitterness and wrath and anger and
[50:13] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[50:16] from you with all malice and be kind one
[50:20] to another tenderhearted forgiving one
[50:22] another even as god for christ's sake
[50:24] hath forgiven
[50:26] you
[50:27] brother branham put it this way and i'm
[50:29] just building up then to our thought
[50:31] here tonight because as jonah was angry
[50:34] brandon said don't get in fusses he said
[50:36] don't like to get in fuss
[50:38] he said if you like to see somebody
[50:40] raise up in church and say you know what
[50:42] i'll tell you so and so did so and so
[50:45] you say now brother shame on you
[50:47] if you say oh is that so he said listen
[50:49] to that scandal
[50:51] watch out the holy spirit is not a
[50:53] cesspool he said no the heart is
[50:55] occupied by the holy spirit is full of
[50:57] holiness purity thinketh no evil doeth
[51:00] no evil is that us tonight it ought to
[51:02] be
[51:03] right he said thinketh no evil doeth no
[51:05] evil believeth all things endureth
[51:07] long-suffering don't fuss he said when
[51:10] the family gets in a fuss don't fuss
[51:12] with them
[51:14] right
[51:15] your mother said i ain't having you up
[51:16] there that old church anymore well he
[51:18] said all you think about now you're
[51:19] letting your hair grow out you look like
[51:20] someone grandma don't fuss with her say
[51:23] okay mother it's all right i love you
[51:25] just the same i'll be praying for you as
[51:27] long as i live
[51:30] that's what a prophet said
[51:32] he said now don't fuss
[51:33] temper breeds temper
[51:35] first thing you know you grieve the holy
[51:37] spirit away from you you'll be fussing
[51:39] back then the holy spirit takes his
[51:41] flight temper
[51:42] breeds temper and love breeds love be
[51:45] full of love
[51:46] jesus said this will all men know you're
[51:48] my disciples when you have loved one for
[51:50] another that's the fruit of the holy
[51:52] spirit is love amen isn't that what we
[51:55] want in our hearts and our lives
[51:57] and yet as i said anger at the wrong
[51:59] thing or at the right things that the
[52:01] things that are wrong
[52:03] don't that kind of anger is something
[52:05] that's necessary you got to get angry
[52:07] enough that you won't do it anymore
[52:10] and you don't want to see it you won't
[52:11] stand for it in your family
[52:14] you've got to get i i've seen situations
[52:16] where a person was so complacent that
[52:19] nothing upset them and it actually
[52:21] caused their families to be destroyed
[52:23] because they would not ever deal with
[52:26] sin and it's got to be dealt with
[52:28] somebody's got to get mad enough to deal
[52:30] with it
[52:32] right
[52:33] now
[52:34] why he why was jonah angry
[52:37] we find that he had finally obeyed god
[52:39] and went to nineveh
[52:41] in jonah three and one the word of the
[52:43] lord came unto jonah the second time
[52:45] aren't you glad god's a god of second
[52:47] chances
[52:48] so he's been through the he's been in
[52:50] the belly of the fish he's been
[52:52] all through there and
[52:53] and he finally reaches a place where the
[52:55] word of the lord came to him again and
[52:57] it said arise going into nineveh that
[52:59] great city preach unto it the preaching
[53:02] that i bid thee
[53:04] and i want to stop there just for a
[53:06] moment because it's not so much what you
[53:09] do
[53:10] that is the problem it's not so much the
[53:11] mistake that you make it's not so much
[53:13] the fall that you have because everybody
[53:16] makes mistakes but it's what you do with
[53:19] it
[53:20] it's how you react to it are you willing
[53:22] to get back up and get back into the
[53:24] harness and do what god tells you to do
[53:27] and so now
[53:28] he said go and preach the preaching that
[53:30] i bid thee
[53:32] so jonah arose and went into nineveh
[53:34] according to the word of the lord
[53:36] now nineveh was an exceeding great city
[53:38] of three days journey that means it was
[53:40] took three days to get through the city
[53:43] and jonah began to enter into the city
[53:45] of dave's journey and he cried and said
[53:48] yet forty days and nineveh shall be
[53:50] overthrown now notice jonah doesn't even
[53:53] give him a space to repent
[53:56] god didn't tell him to
[53:58] he just said preach
[54:01] right and he goes out and preaches and
[54:03] says there's judgment coming on this
[54:05] nation
[54:07] what did the prophet of god do in this
[54:09] hour
[54:10] there's judgment coming on this nation
[54:12] but yet we know in this nation cannot
[54:14] repent will not repent
[54:17] right it's gone past repenting
[54:19] yet the prophets still come out and
[54:21] preach
[54:23] amen he preached the same as as jonah
[54:26] did in nineveh the city should be
[54:28] overthrown as if it was going to happen
[54:30] that moment
[54:32] you realize people today will make fun
[54:34] and say well you know a prophet said
[54:36] that about uh about
[54:38] about los angeles and how it would fall
[54:40] in the sea and if you've listened to the
[54:41] tape of and listen to brother branham
[54:43] speak on uh on that uh sermon when he
[54:46] preached in los angeles choosing of a
[54:48] bride and he's and he says oh city of
[54:50] the angels and you feel like it's going
[54:52] to happen right then
[54:54] he tells the people to flee for their
[54:56] lives
[54:58] and yet all these years later we look
[55:00] back on and say well los angeles hasn't
[55:02] went in the ocean but it's going some
[55:04] day
[55:05] because a prophet cried out the words of
[55:07] the lord
[55:09] and here we find jonah cried out the
[55:11] word of the lord he said in 40 days
[55:13] nineveh will be overthrown
[55:16] and it goes into this great city now
[55:19] history agrees with the dimensions that
[55:21] it was three days journey across
[55:24] it took you three days to walk from one
[55:26] actually around the circumference of the
[55:28] city
[55:29] and those great big cities like that
[55:31] they're spread out especially in
[55:33] ancient times you experienced that some
[55:34] in cairo or city i've been in manila in
[55:37] the philippines those cities are spread
[55:39] out because of the way they build houses
[55:40] and they're spread out you can walk for
[55:42] seems like days and days to get through
[55:44] them
[55:45] and so it's a great city
[55:47] in jonah 3 and 5 it says so the people
[55:49] of nineveh
[55:51] believed god
[55:53] oh if the people of nineveh who knew
[55:55] nothing about god would hear the voice
[55:58] of a prophet and believe god
[56:00] what would it do for us if we could hear
[56:02] the message of the hour what would it do
[56:04] for us when we hear the word of god
[56:06] preach if we could just believe god
[56:09] and do what god says
[56:11] if we could just believe god it's not
[56:13] some great mystery somewhere he said
[56:15] well my family's struggling my i've got
[56:17] trouble in my family i've got trouble at
[56:19] home i got trouble in the church i got
[56:21] trouble at my work but remember if you
[56:23] just believe god god will take care of
[56:25] it
[56:26] if you just listen to the word of god
[56:28] and believe god but you've got to
[56:29] believe god
[56:31] or there's nothing the word can do for
[56:32] you
[56:33] the word cannot take effect in an
[56:35] unbelieving heart it's got to be given
[56:37] that that ability to that belief that
[56:40] that faith that allow it to grow that's
[56:42] the atmosphere that makes it grow
[56:44] believe god you say well i'm not where i
[56:46] think i should be i feel like i'm back
[56:48] sitting i feel like i've gone back how
[56:50] many have ever felt that way
[56:51] i'm not where i should be believe god
[56:54] the same way you did when you were saved
[56:56] believe god you say well i don't have
[56:58] the same people around me i'm not where
[57:00] i was but believe god anyway it's the
[57:02] word that saved you in the first place
[57:04] it'll be the word that keeps you believe
[57:06] god
[57:08] believe god and that atmosphere will
[57:09] begin to build around your life but then
[57:12] i wish we'd have the kind of services
[57:13] where i could believe god we can have
[57:15] those kind of services i believe we have
[57:17] those kind of services we can have more
[57:19] and more of those kind of services if
[57:21] you'll believe god
[57:22] if you'll just take god at his word when
[57:24] the word is being preached how many want
[57:26] to do that tonight
[57:29] amen the word is quick and powerful
[57:31] alive and powerful
[57:32] sharper than a two-edged sword
[57:35] the people of nineveh believed god
[57:37] and proclaimed the fast and put on
[57:39] sackoff from the greatest of them even
[57:41] to the least of them
[57:43] for word came into the king of nineveh
[57:46] and that's a very biblically accurate
[57:48] statement i want you to notice the
[57:50] accuracy of the bible says the king of
[57:52] nineveh notice he doesn't call him the
[57:53] king of assyria
[57:55] because the king of syria
[57:57] assyria had actually died
[57:59] and there was a revolt by one of his
[58:01] sons whose two sons were fighting for
[58:03] the kingdom
[58:04] one of his sons controlled 27 cities you
[58:06] can find this in history
[58:08] during that time
[58:10] and so the official master of assyria
[58:12] was uh
[58:13] i can't pronounce his name but his name
[58:15] is with pal we'll just call him powell
[58:18] old pal was king of nineveh
[58:21] he literally was king of nineveh during
[58:22] that time aren't you glad god gave us an
[58:24] accurate word
[58:26] so he was not the king of assyria he was
[58:27] the king of nineveh because of that
[58:29] situation the political situation that
[58:31] was there
[58:32] and so verse 7 he caused it to be
[58:35] proclaimed and published through nineveh
[58:37] by the decree of the king and his noble
[58:39] saying let neither man nor beasts heard
[58:41] nor flock tastes anything
[58:43] let them not feed nor drink water but
[58:46] let man and beast be covered with
[58:47] sackcloth cry mightily unto god yea let
[58:50] them turn everyone from his evil way
[58:52] from the violence that is in their hands
[58:54] who can tell if god will turn and repent
[58:57] and turn away from his fierce anger that
[58:59] we perish not
[59:01] now this man who knew nothing about god
[59:04] had a better idea of who god was than
[59:07] the prophet jonah did
[59:10] right it seems like that doesn't it here
[59:12] he knew nothing about god
[59:14] but he said i may not be the seed of god
[59:17] i may not be a i may not have been
[59:19] taught about god i may not know this god
[59:21] but i know he if he's got god he and
[59:24] that has the ability to destroy a nation
[59:26] he also has the ability to forgive a
[59:28] nation
[59:29] and to hold back that destruction
[59:32] oh church sometimes we get too too deep
[59:35] into well i i wonder if i'm a seed of
[59:37] god i wonder from that you just believe
[59:39] god's word and if you have the capacity
[59:42] to believe it there must be a seed
[59:43] somewhere
[59:44] if you've got the ability if you've got
[59:46] a desire to come to church brother
[59:47] branham told one young man he said i
[59:49] feel like i sinned away in my day of
[59:50] grace he said do you like gospel music
[59:54] he said yes i do he said that that's a
[59:56] sign that you haven't sent away your day
[59:58] of grace
[1:00:00] just hold on to what you can this king
[1:00:02] is grabbing hold of every every thought
[1:00:04] that he could have about the mercies of
[1:00:06] god well that's what we ought to do
[1:00:07] today
[1:00:09] rather than become a cynic
[1:00:12] say well it doesn't matter if i go to
[1:00:13] church or not it doesn't matter if i
[1:00:15] worship or not doesn't matter if i come
[1:00:17] to an altar or not
[1:00:19] don't be a cynic
[1:00:21] listen when when the spirit of god moves
[1:00:24] you to do something just do it don't
[1:00:26] become cynical about it who can tell
[1:00:28] that god might move through you to help
[1:00:30] somebody else
[1:00:31] who can tell that god won't move in your
[1:00:34] family when you set an example of doing
[1:00:36] the right thing to help some other
[1:00:38] family
[1:00:40] amen who can tell if god will turn and
[1:00:43] repent and turn away from his fierce
[1:00:44] anger that we perish not
[1:00:46] but brown said what we need today is
[1:00:48] some more men down on their knees
[1:00:50] not some of these dried professions but
[1:00:52] a real good birth of the holy
[1:00:54] spirit and you will go type that in dry
[1:00:57] eyed confession or dried profession or
[1:00:59] dried repentance and look what brother
[1:01:01] branham says about that
[1:01:02] from 47 to 65 but random constantly hits
[1:01:06] that why because it's just a it's a
[1:01:08] tradition a family tradition but it has
[1:01:11] no heart in it
[1:01:13] verse 10 god saw their works
[1:01:16] notice that they turned from their evil
[1:01:18] way wasn't just that they cried but they
[1:01:20] turned from their evil way
[1:01:22] and god repented of the evil that he had
[1:01:25] said he would do unto them
[1:01:27] and he did it not
[1:01:29] you say god you can't do that
[1:01:34] now
[1:01:35] look the first part of that sentence god
[1:01:40] god and can't
[1:01:42] don't go in the same sins
[1:01:46] right
[1:01:46] whenever you whenever you
[1:01:48] address him as god
[1:01:50] you don't get to say god you can't do
[1:01:53] that to me
[1:01:55] god you can't repent god you can't you
[1:01:58] can't let this nation live god you can't
[1:02:00] do that god you can't save so and so
[1:02:03] god you can't deal with so and so god
[1:02:04] you can't you can't do that you can't
[1:02:06] heal you can't whatever you don't get to
[1:02:08] god tell god what he can't do
[1:02:11] aren't you glad for that tonight
[1:02:14] if he's god he can do it
[1:02:16] we don't get to explain to god why he
[1:02:19] can't do things
[1:02:23] he turned from his evil that he thought
[1:02:25] he would do to them
[1:02:27] and he did it not of course being god he
[1:02:29] already knew that they would repent
[1:02:31] and we'll show you something wonderful
[1:02:33] about that here in just a moment now
[1:02:36] this is the same nineveh
[1:02:38] that had invaded israel previously if
[1:02:40] you go back when we first began
[1:02:42] preaching about this and how that they
[1:02:43] invaded it in
[1:02:45] israel and how jonah had prophesied and
[1:02:47] helped the king at that time jeroboam
[1:02:50] had helped him
[1:02:51] take back some of the land that the king
[1:02:52] of assyria had taken
[1:02:55] it's the same nation the same capital
[1:02:57] city of the same nation these were
[1:02:59] heathens
[1:03:00] worshipping
[1:03:01] false
[1:03:02] gods
[1:03:04] but you don't get to tell god
[1:03:06] what he's going to do god might bring
[1:03:08] somebody in off the street out of a
[1:03:10] denominational church
[1:03:13] bring them in and heal their body heal
[1:03:14] them of cancer use us to bless them they
[1:03:17] may never receive the message
[1:03:20] we don't get to tell god what to do with
[1:03:22] the change in his pocket
[1:03:25] he gets to use that how he wants to
[1:03:27] he might heal a dime or a penny and
[1:03:29] leave a silver dollar sick
[1:03:33] because he's trying to work something in
[1:03:35] his life
[1:03:36] but healing is already ours
[1:03:38] you understand we don't go by symptoms
[1:03:40] anyway
[1:03:42] but i mean god gets to do what he wants
[1:03:44] to do
[1:03:45] now
[1:03:46] you can tell a lot about people's
[1:03:48] spiritual condition
[1:03:50] by their response to people repenting
[1:03:54] and being forgiven
[1:03:57] you see the problem with jonah is that
[1:03:59] he was
[1:04:00] he was angry
[1:04:02] with god because people repented
[1:04:06] and god accepted it
[1:04:08] he was angry at god
[1:04:11] because god forgave people he didn't
[1:04:14] want
[1:04:14] to forgive
[1:04:17] brother madam said you know when i see
[1:04:18] personal workers going with people he
[1:04:20] said i want to say this about you people
[1:04:22] here he said that proves what you're
[1:04:24] made of
[1:04:25] i've went to places even in people who
[1:04:27] are supposed to be spirit-filled people
[1:04:30] and see altar calls made he said why you
[1:04:32] couldn't get people to go in with
[1:04:33] anybody to pray with them
[1:04:38] oh church it matters if we show concern
[1:04:42] it matters how we treat those who come
[1:04:44] to repentance
[1:04:46] it matters how we treat those who come
[1:04:47] to the house of god
[1:04:49] for the purpose of repentance there's
[1:04:50] some that don't come for the purpose of
[1:04:52] repentance
[1:04:53] there's some that come for the other
[1:04:54] reasons
[1:04:55] but if god would send somebody here i
[1:04:58] don't care what they've been what their
[1:05:00] past has been we ought to be able to say
[1:05:02] lord how would you want to use me help
[1:05:05] me lord to be used by you to help this
[1:05:08] person
[1:05:09] they may have had struggles in their
[1:05:11] life they may have had troubles but see
[1:05:13] it's how you view that tells a lot not
[1:05:15] about them but about you
[1:05:17] if you're not willing to be used as an
[1:05:19] instrument if i'm not willing to be used
[1:05:22] as an instrument to help somebody if
[1:05:24] we're not careful people become numbers
[1:05:27] i heard chuck swindoll the other day he
[1:05:29] said he was at a certain church and
[1:05:31] and
[1:05:32] he was talking to the janitor because
[1:05:34] they were waiting to talk to the pastor
[1:05:36] he said and he spoke to the janitor who
[1:05:38] was cleaning up after the sunday morning
[1:05:40] service
[1:05:41] and and he said it looks like y'all are
[1:05:43] doing well around here is a big church
[1:05:45] in a city
[1:05:46] he said yeah he said we processed 2 500
[1:05:48] units
[1:05:51] this morning
[1:05:53] 2500 units
[1:05:55] that's cynical isn't it
[1:05:57] those are people
[1:05:59] but we lose sight of that brother
[1:06:00] branham lost sight of that at some point
[1:06:03] go and listen to standing in the gap
[1:06:06] but the random say he lost the feeling
[1:06:07] for the people
[1:06:08] because we get to stand on the side it's
[1:06:10] like we get to stand you know it's one
[1:06:12] thing to go to mcdonald's and get a
[1:06:14] happy meal or get a burger it's another
[1:06:15] thing to have to serve it makes you feel
[1:06:18] completely different about mcdonald's
[1:06:22] it's true i've worked at mcdonald's i've
[1:06:25] worked at burger maybe i shouldn't admit
[1:06:26] that i worked at burger king for a while
[1:06:28] so i started getting this
[1:06:30] at burger king
[1:06:32] and i i've worked there i know what
[1:06:34] that's like it's completely different
[1:06:36] from the inside
[1:06:37] and sometimes and i'm speaking out to us
[1:06:40] elders who work in ministry we work as
[1:06:42] deacons we workers we've been in the
[1:06:44] church a long time
[1:06:46] maybe you're a song leader or or working
[1:06:49] the music and you get cynical if you're
[1:06:51] not careful
[1:06:52] it becomes units it becomes numbers
[1:06:55] it becomes we build a barrier between us
[1:06:57] and the people now those are god's
[1:06:59] people
[1:07:00] god sent them here for some purpose for
[1:07:03] some reason we don't have a right cult
[1:07:05] to call them a unit
[1:07:08] it's god's people
[1:07:11] oh my
[1:07:12] i don't know where that come from but
[1:07:13] that was free tonight
[1:07:16] now look
[1:07:17] it said he said see when you wouldn't go
[1:07:19] into people to go in with anybody to
[1:07:21] pray with them he said see it that shows
[1:07:23] it's ichabod
[1:07:26] you realize how serious that is
[1:07:29] just not
[1:07:30] god keep our hearts warm
[1:07:33] we read last wednesday night he said he
[1:07:35] said knowing what we're doing with the
[1:07:36] knowledge and understanding we want
[1:07:38] teaching so we can be stable in the word
[1:07:40] but we want to be warm enough in our
[1:07:41] hearts
[1:07:43] so we can feel the presence of god
[1:07:45] we can be warm enough to know that he's
[1:07:47] moving warm enough to know that when
[1:07:49] someone comes seeking god that we want
[1:07:50] to get right there with them help them
[1:07:52] out
[1:07:54] help them out he said well altar calls
[1:07:56] made he said well you couldn't get
[1:07:58] people to go into anybody it shows it's
[1:07:59] ichabod the spirit of the lord has
[1:08:01] departed but when you see that zeal and
[1:08:03] fire and longing and long for human
[1:08:05] souls
[1:08:07] you see the people of nina were in
[1:08:09] nineveh were in revival but the prophet
[1:08:11] wasn't
[1:08:15] and god had used him to bring revival
[1:08:18] and yet he was out of revival i said god
[1:08:20] help me
[1:08:22] he would become so cynical about the job
[1:08:24] he had to do that it actually he
[1:08:27] actually treated the people as numbers
[1:08:30] and just somebody that god was going to
[1:08:31] destroy cannon fodder
[1:08:34] as brother branham put it
[1:08:36] and he said god told him not to call him
[1:08:38] rickies and richards
[1:08:40] because he said those are my children
[1:08:43] they may not be bribed but they're my
[1:08:44] children he said and there's some bright
[1:08:46] out there
[1:08:47] or some of god's children just don't
[1:08:48] know any better
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:51] brother branham talked about how that he
[1:08:53] talked about a minister that said why
[1:08:55] don't we have these burdens don't have
[1:08:56] burdens for lost souls he said i believe
[1:08:58] that it's the lacking of the revival
[1:09:00] he said well brother ben that gives me a
[1:09:02] built-in excuse no revival anywhere i
[1:09:04] can just i think that's why some people
[1:09:05] don't like revival
[1:09:07] because it gives them an excuse for just
[1:09:09] living any way they want to and you
[1:09:11] don't have to be have a burden for souls
[1:09:12] but brother branham says this he said i
[1:09:14] believe he said that we should still try
[1:09:16] to pray to god to give us passions for
[1:09:19] lost souls until jesus comes
[1:09:22] amen isn't that what you want in your
[1:09:24] heart a passion for lost souls until
[1:09:26] jesus comes why don't christians do that
[1:09:28] today it's because we live in laodicea
[1:09:31] people are affected by that and i may
[1:09:34] get into it sunday i don't know yet i've
[1:09:36] been studying and pondering on it but
[1:09:39] you realize that all the plagues that
[1:09:40] struck egypt most of them were only on
[1:09:43] the egyptians
[1:09:44] but the last plague was death
[1:09:46] and the last effect didn't care if you
[1:09:48] were an egyptian or an israelite
[1:09:51] the only thing that would keep that
[1:09:52] plague of death off of you was blood on
[1:09:54] the door
[1:09:56] that was the only thing was the
[1:09:57] application of the token
[1:09:59] and see that that spiritual death
[1:10:02] you don't care whether you say you're a
[1:10:03] message believer
[1:10:05] it doesn't care whether you go to word
[1:10:06] of life tabernacle it's in the land
[1:10:10] it's everywhere it's creeping into every
[1:10:12] house into every church it's everywhere
[1:10:15] out there but thank god we have a
[1:10:16] message of life
[1:10:18] spiritual death is everywhere but we
[1:10:20] have the blood on display
[1:10:23] but that's why the church is that way
[1:10:25] it's why there's no burden for souls
[1:10:26] it's just a number because of laodicea
[1:10:28] is everywhere spiritual death he said oh
[1:10:32] sure they say you know what we used to
[1:10:33] that little church we used to use in the
[1:10:35] back part this is the big one now he
[1:10:37] said i tell you no burden for souls but
[1:10:39] they got to see all these things are
[1:10:40] taken care of
[1:10:42] the lady said and all these other things
[1:10:44] all has to be taken care of but no
[1:10:45] burden for lost souls he said oh man
[1:10:47] what this church has gotten into
[1:10:50] brother branham talked about how that
[1:10:52] when simon struck me as a young man i've
[1:10:54] always remembered it he talked about how
[1:10:56] simon the pharisee invited jesus to come
[1:10:58] he said but he got so busy with church
[1:11:00] matters
[1:11:01] that he forgot to invite he forgot
[1:11:04] to invite jesus and not just invite him
[1:11:06] but welcome him and wash his feet when
[1:11:09] he came and anoint him with oil he got
[1:11:11] so busy with church matters we it's so
[1:11:14] easy for us to do the same way and we
[1:11:16] get so busy with church matters we get
[1:11:18] so busy with the little fusses and
[1:11:19] things that we go through that we forget
[1:11:21] to welcome jesus when he comes
[1:11:23] right brother said you asked him you
[1:11:25] invited him then worship him when he
[1:11:27] comes
[1:11:29] oh my do you believe he's here tonight
[1:11:31] in the word
[1:11:32] if he's hearing his word he's hearing
[1:11:33] his spirit we ought to worship him with
[1:11:35] all that we have
[1:11:37] but they were not burdened for souls he
[1:11:40] said oh man what this church has gotten
[1:11:42] into they were not burdened for souls
[1:11:44] but they were burdened with wealth
[1:11:46] that's right they had the wrong burden
[1:11:48] well they had a burden just the wrong
[1:11:49] one
[1:11:51] they had a burden for their wealth but
[1:11:54] not a burden for lost souls
[1:11:56] how do you know that brother ben because
[1:11:57] they spend all their time trying to make
[1:11:59] money
[1:12:01] and not only the people i'm not trying
[1:12:03] to criticize you tonight it's not just
[1:12:05] the people of this age it's the
[1:12:06] churches right
[1:12:09] spent all of our time trying to make
[1:12:10] money
[1:12:12] instead of actually having a burden to
[1:12:14] see somebody saved
[1:12:16] it's the wrong burden he said the
[1:12:18] scripture said they didn't know that
[1:12:19] they were wretched miserable and blind
[1:12:21] they think that they could take money
[1:12:23] and convert the world or if we could
[1:12:25] just get a program on we could get a lot
[1:12:26] of money here i believe we could convert
[1:12:28] the world if some of the rich people in
[1:12:30] our church brother branham if we could
[1:12:31] just get them to dig out he said i
[1:12:33] believe we could start a society would
[1:12:34] go around convert the world we could
[1:12:36] take airplanes and drop literature all
[1:12:37] over africa things like that if we just
[1:12:39] had some money
[1:12:41] brother the world won't be converted by
[1:12:42] money the world will be converted by the
[1:12:45] holy ghost
[1:12:46] he said the powerful preaching of the
[1:12:48] holy ghost and the cross will be the
[1:12:49] only thing that will convert the world
[1:12:51] do we still believe that tonight
[1:12:53] god's program is not money it's the holy
[1:12:55] ghost
[1:12:56] that's what god's program is for the
[1:12:58] later seeing church age or any other
[1:13:00] church age
[1:13:01] jonah had the wrong burden he had a
[1:13:04] burden to see people destroyed
[1:13:06] god had a burden to see people live
[1:13:10] but there was a greater purpose in that
[1:13:12] we're going to see that in a moment
[1:13:14] jonah lost his feeling for the people
[1:13:17] verse one chapter four it displeased
[1:13:18] jonah exceedingly he was very angry
[1:13:21] verse two and he prayed unto the lord
[1:13:23] and said i pray thee o lord was not this
[1:13:25] my saying when i was yet in my country
[1:13:30] he said therefore i fled before unto
[1:13:32] tarshish
[1:13:33] truth is jonah did know something about
[1:13:35] god and that's why he was so upset
[1:13:38] he said i knew the thou art a gracious
[1:13:40] gracious god and merciful
[1:13:42] so to anger
[1:13:44] aren't you glad that he is aren't you
[1:13:46] glad he is to us gentiles
[1:13:48] but here was this jewish man who was one
[1:13:50] of god's chosen people this prophet of
[1:13:52] god but he said i knew you were a
[1:13:53] merciful god of great kindness
[1:13:55] repentancy of the evil
[1:13:57] therefore now o lord take i beseech thee
[1:14:01] my life from me
[1:14:03] for it is better for me to die
[1:14:05] than to live
[1:14:09] sometimes
[1:14:12] sometimes what we know becomes a burden
[1:14:14] to us
[1:14:17] because we know how
[1:14:18] how things are going to end up
[1:14:20] jonah knew more than the average man but
[1:14:23] lebron said you think you'd want to know
[1:14:24] things about people he said you don't
[1:14:27] because a lot of the people tell you
[1:14:28] that things are a certain way they're
[1:14:29] not that way
[1:14:31] and i'm glad i don't have
[1:14:33] it you say that makes things a lot
[1:14:35] easier wouldn't it
[1:14:36] in counseling and in preaching if you
[1:14:38] could just see people's hearts and and
[1:14:40] sometimes the lord will it just like
[1:14:42] it's plain before you but i'm glad i
[1:14:44] don't have that assurance of that and
[1:14:45] don't see visions and things like that
[1:14:47] because
[1:14:48] i can just preach and let it go out
[1:14:50] where it may
[1:14:52] and i don't necessarily know what you're
[1:14:53] thinking although some of you are easier
[1:14:55] to read than others
[1:14:57] but joel was before his glasses i don't
[1:14:58] know now
[1:15:01] but joel's wearing glasses in case
[1:15:02] anybody wondered tonight
[1:15:05] that's who that is on the front row
[1:15:08] but it's a burden
[1:15:11] because he knew what the ninevites would
[1:15:13] do
[1:15:19] he knew they were called
[1:15:21] the assyrians were called as a nation to
[1:15:24] be a scourge
[1:15:25] on israel
[1:15:28] he knew they would take the
[1:15:29] and they were so cruel they invented
[1:15:31] terror state terror
[1:15:33] they were so cruel they would take the
[1:15:34] skin of their enemies fillet them
[1:15:37] take the skin and and cover their their
[1:15:39] chairs with it
[1:15:40] they were like the nazis
[1:15:43] but god was using them
[1:15:47] they were so cruel that they would they
[1:15:49] would stick their enemies up on on on a
[1:15:51] stick on a pike and just leave them
[1:15:53] there
[1:15:55] and and line the the way to their
[1:15:57] banquets with their enemies
[1:15:59] naked on a stick
[1:16:03] cruel
[1:16:04] people godless people
[1:16:09] and jonah said you're going to give them
[1:16:10] another chance
[1:16:12] you don't get to tell god what to do
[1:16:16] because see what we know isn't
[1:16:17] everything
[1:16:20] we'll get to that in just a moment
[1:16:22] notice jonah was also angry and the
[1:16:24] reason he felt this way is because he
[1:16:26] was coming down out of the anointing and
[1:16:28] brother branham called it the monday
[1:16:29] morning blues
[1:16:31] and he talked about elijah how he dealt
[1:16:34] with that he said it's very strange he
[1:16:35] said pastor here knows at other
[1:16:36] ministers he said watch after your mount
[1:16:38] carmel's you're going to have a juniper
[1:16:40] tree
[1:16:41] whenever a man has a blessing and the
[1:16:43] power of god pours down and does
[1:16:45] something for you look out satan is on
[1:16:47] the track
[1:16:49] you watch that we watch it happen in our
[1:16:50] meetings this is a local church and
[1:16:53] it's everywhere it's not just us but we
[1:16:54] can apply the word to us we had a great
[1:16:56] meeting and immediately satan began to
[1:16:58] work
[1:16:59] begin to try to keep people apart i
[1:17:00] don't think we've had the whole church
[1:17:02] in one building since the meetings
[1:17:04] you think about that though satan he
[1:17:06] starts working in sickness and things
[1:17:07] like that why does he do that he wants
[1:17:09] to steal your blessing from you
[1:17:11] whenever a man has a blessing and the
[1:17:13] power of god pours down and does
[1:17:15] something for you look out satan is on
[1:17:17] the track
[1:17:18] he said just remember the next day that
[1:17:20] monday after a good day on sunday it's
[1:17:23] going to be a hard thing
[1:17:25] because he he does he's going to do
[1:17:27] everything he can to knock that
[1:17:29] confidence out of you that the holy
[1:17:31] spirit instilled in you the day before
[1:17:34] so the day before you sat back there and
[1:17:35] said hey i'm going to make it i'm a
[1:17:37] child of god you heard the preaching of
[1:17:39] the word and you were feeding on at the
[1:17:41] feast of the lord and you got defeating
[1:17:43] on it and you said i i'm a child of god
[1:17:45] i'm going to make it boy wasn't that a
[1:17:46] good service and you're so excited you
[1:17:48] go home and you get a phone call
[1:17:50] somebody's sick you hear about somebody
[1:17:52] that wants some money or somebody that
[1:17:54] that's dying somebody is sick in your
[1:17:56] family troubles begin to come up work
[1:17:58] people give you grief at work and and
[1:18:00] things happen in the home you have a
[1:18:02] disagreement with the wife or the
[1:18:03] husband and you begin it begins to take
[1:18:05] that confidence out of you why does
[1:18:07] satan do that because he wants to steal
[1:18:09] your blessing that's the time when you
[1:18:11] ought to stand up and say lord i know
[1:18:12] i'm still a child of god i know i'm
[1:18:15] still greatly blessed and highly favored
[1:18:17] i know i'm still the head and not the
[1:18:19] tale i'm still a believer and not an
[1:18:21] unbeliever i'm still a child of god i'm
[1:18:23] still the elect
[1:18:26] even though the devil is out to get me
[1:18:31] and
[1:18:33] now again
[1:18:35] jonah had a right to be angry about
[1:18:37] their sin yes
[1:18:38] but not about their forgiveness
[1:18:41] from sin
[1:18:44] be angry and sin not
[1:18:47] john 4 4 then said the lord does sow
[1:18:49] well to be angry
[1:18:51] ask him the question you do well to be
[1:18:53] angry
[1:18:55] so john went out of the city
[1:18:58] and sat on the east side of the city
[1:19:01] and there made him a booth
[1:19:03] and sat under it in the shadow until he
[1:19:05] might see what would become of the city
[1:19:06] he literally goes out sits on his little
[1:19:09] mountain us for no more
[1:19:11] builds himself a denomination a covering
[1:19:14] a booth
[1:19:16] and sits there and criticizes the
[1:19:18] ninevites
[1:19:19] having this great
[1:19:20] revival sure
[1:19:23] god don't want you to be critical of
[1:19:24] revival even if it's a shallow revival
[1:19:29] that won't last
[1:19:32] because that's the kind this was
[1:19:35] but god still said jonah you shouldn't
[1:19:36] be angry
[1:19:38] just because you know it won't last
[1:19:41] he said don't get angry
[1:19:43] god does what he does for a reason if
[1:19:45] god sends a blessing let's just receive
[1:19:47] the blessing
[1:19:48] not sitting criticize it but jonah got
[1:19:50] critical built himself a little
[1:19:51] denomination pulled off by himself
[1:19:55] and just preached at that let them
[1:19:57] preach to himself about nineveh
[1:20:00] oh god
[1:20:02] how how many how many of us in the
[1:20:04] message have done the same thing
[1:20:07] pull back from the denominations and
[1:20:09] everybody pulled out of the world that's
[1:20:11] good we got to separate ourselves but
[1:20:12] then you pull off and sit on your heel
[1:20:14] and criticize oh america america is so
[1:20:16] bad what have we done
[1:20:19] what have we done to help
[1:20:21] well he said well i can't i can't change
[1:20:23] the nation no you can't but you can
[1:20:25] change the atmosphere in your home
[1:20:27] you can change the atmosphere it's your
[1:20:29] work you know you're a creator
[1:20:31] you're a little a little messiah a
[1:20:33] little a little bit of deity
[1:20:35] on the earth
[1:20:37] you can change things
[1:20:39] but
[1:20:40] the human tendency is to withdraw like
[1:20:42] jonah did
[1:20:44] make it make a covering a fig leaf
[1:20:46] that's what that word booth means a
[1:20:47] covering
[1:20:48] a denomination a religion
[1:20:52] and and god blessed jonah sitting there
[1:20:55] because he wanted to teach him a lesson
[1:20:57] and jonah four and six notice the lord
[1:20:59] god
[1:21:00] prepared
[1:21:01] a gourd
[1:21:03] and it's not that he had a gourd like we
[1:21:05] would think of get around
[1:21:07] around halloween or the fall festival
[1:21:10] you have a gourd like that it's not that
[1:21:12] it was the gourd plant that would grow
[1:21:14] and it's got a great big leaf
[1:21:16] and so the gourd plant grow up and it
[1:21:18] could grow very quickly in a day it
[1:21:20] would grow up
[1:21:21] and cover jonah's little hut
[1:21:24] and jonah said well i must be right
[1:21:27] bless god
[1:21:28] here in my hut and i got me a gourd
[1:21:31] got everything i have need of right here
[1:21:33] don't need them ninovites
[1:21:35] don't sit here and watch god destroy
[1:21:37] them
[1:21:39] so he got a shadow over his head and
[1:21:42] delivered him from his grief so jonah
[1:21:44] was exceeding glad of the gourd his mood
[1:21:46] changed because now he's in the shade
[1:21:49] you ever been out in a really hot day
[1:21:50] and that sun just beating on your head
[1:21:52] and and that you get under a tree get in
[1:21:54] the shade and
[1:21:56] and you begin your mood begins to change
[1:21:58] and you begin to be happy because you're
[1:22:00] not sweating like you were and so he
[1:22:02] sits comfortably
[1:22:05] i think it's important for us to notice
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:07] god could control everything but jonah
[1:22:14] think about it
[1:22:16] he controlled the wind and the waves and
[1:22:18] the fish and the gourd and the worm
[1:22:20] we're going to read about in the wind
[1:22:23] but jonah had to surrender
[1:22:27] yeah
[1:22:28] everything in nature brother bradley
[1:22:29] said the heavens work in perfect order
[1:22:32] but the part that don't works down here
[1:22:35] the body of christ on the earth
[1:22:37] everything in nature obeys the word of
[1:22:39] god except human beings
[1:22:41] but we have the greatest reason to obey
[1:22:44] but so god's going to teach joan a
[1:22:46] lesson so he goes on and says god
[1:22:48] prepared
[1:22:49] a worm
[1:22:51] now watch the words god prepared a gourd
[1:22:55] one day
[1:22:56] and god prepared a worm
[1:22:59] now put that in your job
[1:23:02] god prepared the boss that likes
[1:23:04] you and god prepared the one that didn't
[1:23:11] think about it for a minute
[1:23:12] god prepared the co-worker that was
[1:23:14] efficient and got things done and then
[1:23:16] they left and god prepared
[1:23:18] the one who was lazy
[1:23:22] are you with me now
[1:23:24] god prepared the good day
[1:23:26] and the bad day
[1:23:30] and i already had them both set out on
[1:23:32] the calendar
[1:23:33] today
[1:23:34] jonah gets a gourd
[1:23:36] he's going to be happy
[1:23:38] tomorrow
[1:23:39] he gets the worm
[1:23:41] today may have been your worm day but
[1:23:43] remember god prepared it
[1:23:47] well it's hard on us didn't he
[1:23:51] god had a worm ready to eat the gourd
[1:23:53] that he prepared
[1:23:57] in verse 8 it came to pass when the
[1:23:59] verse 7 said god prepared a war a worm
[1:24:01] and it smote the gourd that it withered
[1:24:03] and then things got worse than they ever
[1:24:04] had been
[1:24:05] and verse 80 came to pass when the sun
[1:24:07] did arise god prepared a vehement east
[1:24:10] wind
[1:24:11] and the sun beat upon the head of jonah
[1:24:14] that he fainted and wished in himself to
[1:24:17] die
[1:24:18] and said it is better for me to die
[1:24:22] than to live
[1:24:24] god had prepared again
[1:24:26] when the sun arose god prepared god
[1:24:28] prepared a gourd a worm
[1:24:30] and an east wind
[1:24:33] brother branham said about that east
[1:24:34] wind he said one day the lord willing i
[1:24:35] want to come to the tabernacle and take
[1:24:37] a series just on jonah he said oh
[1:24:39] there's so many great you thought i was
[1:24:41] just doing that with jonah but that's
[1:24:42] what he said something he wanted to do
[1:24:45] he said oh there's so many great he said
[1:24:46] that east wind blowing and all he said
[1:24:48] oh my he said there's so many things in
[1:24:50] there it's thrilling them nuggets in
[1:24:52] there it all types right in fit it even
[1:24:54] brings jesus christ in it and everything
[1:24:57] else he said of course every line in the
[1:24:59] bible brings jesus christ do we believe
[1:25:01] that tonight
[1:25:02] so that east wind what is that that's
[1:25:04] that violent wind that blows from the
[1:25:05] east it's mentioned more frequently in
[1:25:07] the bible than other winds the east wind
[1:25:09] is described as a scorching wind and and
[1:25:12] it comes from the desert if you look at
[1:25:14] a map of palestine to the west is the
[1:25:16] mediterranean sea when the west wind
[1:25:18] blows off of the ever been in those
[1:25:19] desert countries the west wind blows off
[1:25:22] the ocean that's wonderful but when the
[1:25:23] east wind comes
[1:25:25] it's got nothing but deserts
[1:25:28] it's just coming out of the out of the
[1:25:29] arabian desert and out of all those
[1:25:31] deserts blowing across and when it does
[1:25:34] it kills everything it just it's such a
[1:25:36] dry wind that it actually dries up the
[1:25:38] plants
[1:25:39] dries everything up when we were in
[1:25:40] egypt i didn't have to comb my hair
[1:25:44] i'm serious because it there was no
[1:25:46] humidity
[1:25:47] everything was dry but if you didn't
[1:25:48] drink water because you didn't feel that
[1:25:50] hot when you were just out and about but
[1:25:52] if you didn't drink enough water you die
[1:25:54] you dry up
[1:25:56] oh sometimes when an east wind blows god
[1:25:58] prepared it but you better make sure
[1:25:59] you've got a source of water
[1:26:01] you better make sure you drink enough
[1:26:03] water or you're going to dry up when the
[1:26:05] time of the east wind
[1:26:08] see god doesn't think like we do the
[1:26:09] east wind serves its purpose
[1:26:12] the greeks called it euroclidon from
[1:26:14] pronouncing that correctly it's the same
[1:26:15] wind that drove paul's ship to the
[1:26:17] island of malta so he could be bitten by
[1:26:19] a snake
[1:26:22] so he could bring the gospel to that
[1:26:24] island on the way to rome
[1:26:26] and many times god has a purpose
[1:26:29] now can you bear with me for just a few
[1:26:31] more minutes i'm almost out of time just
[1:26:33] give me five more minutes
[1:26:34] and i only only take it from one or two
[1:26:36] of you
[1:26:38] but
[1:26:40] many times god has a purpose and then a
[1:26:41] hidden purpose
[1:26:44] are you with me tonight
[1:26:45] a purpose and then a hidden purpose
[1:26:48] so he has a purpose that he shows you
[1:26:50] maybe you're a deacon or a trustee or
[1:26:53] something like that he shows you that
[1:26:55] but he doesn't show you the hidden
[1:26:57] purpose
[1:26:58] so that route to becoming what you're
[1:27:01] going to be in life is you think it's
[1:27:03] like this but it's not it's like this
[1:27:07] right and over here is the hidden
[1:27:08] purpose
[1:27:10] that he doesn't show you so whenever you
[1:27:11] look at things brown said that scripture
[1:27:13] has compound meanings because there's a
[1:27:15] purpose there's a hidden purpose
[1:27:18] right and many many times there's other
[1:27:20] purposes along the way of your life
[1:27:23] and so now look at paul he only showed
[1:27:25] him the end result he said you'll stand
[1:27:26] before caesar but because he knew what
[1:27:28] his purpose was whatever happened in
[1:27:30] between wouldn't matter
[1:27:33] he couldn't die until he stood before
[1:27:34] caesar
[1:27:36] oh my if you could just recognize that
[1:27:38] today god has showed you your purpose
[1:27:40] and what it is you're to be the bride of
[1:27:42] jesus christ you're supposed to go in a
[1:27:43] rapture god showed you your purpose
[1:27:46] whatever happens in the meantime god
[1:27:48] will take care of it there's a hidden
[1:27:50] purpose in there but you're going to the
[1:27:52] same place
[1:27:53] the the things oh i hope you hear me
[1:27:55] tonight the things you went through did
[1:27:57] not do derail your purpose they were
[1:28:00] part of it yeah
[1:28:02] right the troubles that you face the the
[1:28:04] people that you faced at the job the the
[1:28:07] marriage problems the struggle at church
[1:28:09] the struggle everywhere you went that
[1:28:11] was a part of it
[1:28:14] oh god
[1:28:15] you thought that it was it was out of
[1:28:17] the will of god but it was actually a
[1:28:19] part of it when we step back and look at
[1:28:20] the bigger picture god had a hidden
[1:28:22] purpose for jonah his purpose was for
[1:28:24] him to go to nineveh but there was a
[1:28:25] hidden purpose of him to become a type
[1:28:27] of christ
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:30] paul's hidden purpose to go and get
[1:28:32] bitten by a snake bring the gospel to
[1:28:33] that island
[1:28:37] don't get angry at the east wind
[1:28:39] because it's blowing your ship into the
[1:28:41] perfect will
[1:28:42] of god
[1:28:44] jonah 4 9 god said to jonah to do us how
[1:28:46] well to be angry for the gourd he said i
[1:28:48] do well to be angry
[1:28:50] even unto death
[1:28:52] boy how we like to justify
[1:28:55] our actions
[1:28:57] despicable as they may be
[1:29:01] in our attitudes
[1:29:03] that's just human
[1:29:06] then said the lord
[1:29:08] thou hast pity on the gourd
[1:29:10] for the which thou hast not labored
[1:29:12] neither made us to grow which came up in
[1:29:14] a night and perished in a night
[1:29:17] should not i spare nineveh he said
[1:29:18] that's a plant you know why jonah had
[1:29:20] pity on it it fulfilled jonah's purpose
[1:29:24] it helped him along the way
[1:29:26] nineveh was going to help god
[1:29:29] fulfill his purpose
[1:29:32] oh my
[1:29:33] and there was a hidden purpose that
[1:29:34] jonah didn't know
[1:29:37] now look here here he said
[1:29:39] can you should not i spare nineveh where
[1:29:41] there's more than six scorers 120 000
[1:29:44] people that cannot discern between their
[1:29:46] right hand and their left hand and i
[1:29:48] love that he adds this in here god even
[1:29:49] cared about the animals
[1:29:52] he said all so much cattle
[1:29:57] my daughter's going to give me a hard
[1:29:58] time about that because i give them dogs
[1:29:59] a hard time but god even cared about the
[1:30:01] cows
[1:30:05] see god had a purpose for jonah he had a
[1:30:07] purpose for the ship to tarshish for the
[1:30:09] storm for the fish for the lord for the
[1:30:11] worm east wind for the ninevites
[1:30:14] but jonah's anger stemmed from his
[1:30:16] arrogance
[1:30:18] he thought he knew what god needed to do
[1:30:21] don't get angry jonah you don't know
[1:30:23] everything
[1:30:25] i got to remind myself of that sometimes
[1:30:27] don't get angry when that person says
[1:30:29] that you don't know everything
[1:30:32] not that person that don't know
[1:30:33] everything but you don't know everything
[1:30:35] and jonah tapped into the mind of god or
[1:30:37] rather david did when he said maybe the
[1:30:39] lord told him to do that
[1:30:42] man's out there spitting and throwing
[1:30:44] rocks
[1:30:45] and joab grabs his sword he's going to
[1:30:46] cut his head off he said maybe the lord
[1:30:48] told him to do it
[1:30:50] because there was a hidden purpose one
[1:30:51] day christ would walk up that same hill
[1:30:54] and be spit on yes
[1:30:58] you don't know everything i don't know
[1:31:00] everything committed to god jonah didn't
[1:31:02] know he said well why didn't jonah know
[1:31:03] because god didn't tell him
[1:31:07] see brother branham said god don't have
[1:31:08] to tell you everything see
[1:31:11] so he don't even tell his prophets
[1:31:13] everything
[1:31:14] he just does what he wants to do
[1:31:17] he's god
[1:31:20] oh my
[1:31:23] i want you to notice now as we're
[1:31:24] closing
[1:31:26] jonah was right
[1:31:28] the ninevites would ultimately turn back
[1:31:30] to their evil ways but would not be
[1:31:32] destroyed until they fulfilled their
[1:31:33] purpose 150 years later they would be
[1:31:37] destroyed
[1:31:38] the same prophet that prophesied to help
[1:31:41] jeroboam defeat assyria also preached
[1:31:44] repentance to nineveh that don't make
[1:31:45] sense to us but it does to god
[1:31:48] which kept them alive long enough to
[1:31:49] completely destroy the northern kingdom
[1:31:51] of israel you go back in history look in
[1:31:54] the book of kings
[1:31:55] second kings you begin to see it which
[1:31:58] kept them alive long enough to
[1:32:00] completely destroy the northern kingdom
[1:32:01] of israel jonah's prophecy did that
[1:32:04] had they been destroyed in 40 days
[1:32:08] they couldn't have been the adversary to
[1:32:10] israel
[1:32:11] but i told you there's a hidden purpose
[1:32:13] now watch
[1:32:14] watch closely and we'll close
[1:32:17] they made they destroyed israel they
[1:32:18] made judah a vassal state that would
[1:32:20] have finally fought to the babylonians
[1:32:22] when they were destroyed by the
[1:32:23] babylonians
[1:32:25] now
[1:32:26] what happened when the assyrians
[1:32:28] conquered israel
[1:32:29] and i told i gave joel a clue to this
[1:32:31] the other night and i don't know if he's
[1:32:32] found it or not
[1:32:34] but there's a direct link between jonah
[1:32:36] and the woman at the well
[1:32:41] jonah and the woman at the well
[1:32:44] when the assyrians conquered israel they
[1:32:46] resettled the lands with other conquered
[1:32:47] peoples and those peoples became
[1:32:50] the samaritans
[1:32:52] you find that in second kings 17 24.
[1:32:54] brother brown talked about the
[1:32:55] samaritans are half jew half gentile
[1:32:57] it's because of that resettlement
[1:32:59] that came in and the jews that were left
[1:33:02] they mixed with them and it became a
[1:33:03] different kind of religion that still
[1:33:05] held on to the jewish religion and
[1:33:06] second kings chapter 17 explains that
[1:33:08] i'll just read the one verse but you can
[1:33:10] go and read it for yourself later it
[1:33:11] explains how that happened second kings
[1:33:14] 17 24 the king of assyria brought men
[1:33:16] from babylon from qatar from eva from
[1:33:19] hamath from sephirovin and placed him in
[1:33:22] the cities of samaria instead of the
[1:33:24] children of israel
[1:33:26] now watch
[1:33:28] jonah's prophecy allowed nineveh to live
[1:33:31] so the king of assyria could come back
[1:33:35] and bring men from babylon and from
[1:33:37] qatar and from ava and from all these
[1:33:39] cities
[1:33:40] and bring them back into the land and
[1:33:42] put them in samaria
[1:33:45] josephus tells us that these are the
[1:33:47] samaritans who were there when jesus
[1:33:48] came came especially the ones from qatar
[1:33:51] that city that particular city those
[1:33:53] were the samaritans that were there
[1:33:55] when jesus came now watch
[1:33:58] 150 years after jonah's prophecy nineveh
[1:34:00] is destroyed
[1:34:01] hundreds of years later
[1:34:04] a samaritan woman with a life full of
[1:34:06] problems
[1:34:11] oh god i hope you can see the providence
[1:34:13] of god
[1:34:15] don't get angry at god he knows what
[1:34:17] he's doing
[1:34:19] i saw this a couple days ago for the
[1:34:21] first time in my life and i just about
[1:34:22] run around the room
[1:34:24] i thought oh god
[1:34:26] if you could do that for that woman yes
[1:34:29] a samaritan woman with a life full of
[1:34:31] problems
[1:34:34] comes to a well
[1:34:36] knowing nothing about the the nations
[1:34:40] that god has moved
[1:34:43] in order for her to be there because if
[1:34:46] there had never been donor's prophecy
[1:34:48] there would have never been any
[1:34:50] samaritans
[1:34:51] right there would have never been a
[1:34:53] samaritan woman
[1:34:56] but the sign of the messiah would not
[1:34:57] only be shown in the type in jonah's
[1:34:59] resurrection
[1:35:01] but jonah would have a direct link to it
[1:35:03] being shown by jesus at the well
[1:35:08] i've always wondered why did he have to
[1:35:09] go to that samaritan woman now watch
[1:35:11] here was a woman with a life full of
[1:35:13] problems coming to a well and a man said
[1:35:15] woman bring me a drink
[1:35:17] seemed like just a normal life event but
[1:35:19] god was closing a cycle
[1:35:22] that began hundreds of years earlier
[1:35:25] so you don't know what god's doing
[1:35:27] tonight
[1:35:29] you don't know what he's going to do
[1:35:30] next week you don't know other things
[1:35:32] happen the way that they did and why
[1:35:34] churches and things have we see the the
[1:35:36] minor details god sees the big picture
[1:35:41] woman bring me a drink
[1:35:43] and he showed her the sign of the
[1:35:44] messiah she believed it why did she
[1:35:46] believe it brother brown said look at
[1:35:47] that little woman she had fallen from
[1:35:50] god's thoughts
[1:35:53] she had fallen from god's thoughts
[1:35:56] she was a thought of god
[1:35:58] and because she was a thought of god
[1:36:01] god would move heaven and earth yes
[1:36:04] yes sir
[1:36:05] lord of god
[1:36:07] and in the end none of her five husbands
[1:36:09] mattered none of the sin that she was in
[1:36:11] none of the things oh god if you just
[1:36:13] see it today none of the problems that
[1:36:15] she'd had because hundreds of years
[1:36:17] before god made a prophet go to nineveh
[1:36:23] are you hearing me tonight this is
[1:36:24] scripture now
[1:36:26] so that the samaritans would resettle
[1:36:29] so so the assyrians would resettle in
[1:36:31] samaria
[1:36:32] so there would be a samaritan woman who
[1:36:34] was in an outcast tribe
[1:36:36] and an outcast herself
[1:36:38] oh god
[1:36:40] that would believe
[1:36:43] god
[1:36:44] he works in mysterious ways
[1:36:46] you know why the samaritans accepted the
[1:36:49] jewish religion or what parts of it they
[1:36:51] accepted go read second kings chapter 17
[1:36:54] i believe it is where it talks about
[1:36:56] that it talks about how that they they
[1:36:58] come in to the land and then there were
[1:37:00] actually lions that come out of the
[1:37:02] wilderness
[1:37:03] and they ate them up
[1:37:05] and they come back to the king and they
[1:37:06] said hey we don't know the gods of this
[1:37:09] land
[1:37:10] send us a priest to teach us because
[1:37:12] they just wiped the land clean
[1:37:15] so they brought a jewish priest back
[1:37:18] from assyria to come back into the land
[1:37:21] to teach the people about judaism
[1:37:25] so they could live there
[1:37:28] oh my so she would know
[1:37:31] say would god wouldn't do that for one
[1:37:32] person why not
[1:37:36] she was a thought of god and not one
[1:37:38] thought of god will ever be wasted
[1:37:41] not one thought of god will ever fall to
[1:37:43] the ground and so god moved heaven and
[1:37:46] earth
[1:37:47] yes to find one woman
[1:37:52] oh god
[1:37:53] why she could be redeemed
[1:37:55] she was a subject
[1:37:57] she had representation
[1:37:59] in heaven
[1:38:03] jonah had no hadn't gone to nineveh they
[1:38:05] would have never repented if they had
[1:38:06] not repented they would not have been
[1:38:08] destroyed in 40 days
[1:38:09] if they were they were or they would
[1:38:11] have been destroyed in 40 days if they
[1:38:12] were destroyed they would have never
[1:38:13] conquered israel never taken the tribes
[1:38:15] captive never replaced them with the
[1:38:17] samaritans there would have been no
[1:38:18] woman at the well
[1:38:24] let me read this to you as the musicians
[1:38:25] come
[1:38:28] venom said many times we get nervous
[1:38:30] remember i read this to you before but i
[1:38:32] hope we can understand it better now
[1:38:34] many times we get nervous when we begin
[1:38:36] to think well it ought to be this way
[1:38:38] we've got to make it this way or make it
[1:38:40] that way
[1:38:41] we don't have nothing to do into it
[1:38:44] just play our part that he leads us
[1:38:47] to play
[1:38:49] remember
[1:38:50] there's nothing
[1:38:52] out of cater
[1:38:54] god knows what he's doing
[1:38:56] do you believe that tonight
[1:38:59] oh that just makes me want to worship
[1:39:00] him
[1:39:02] a god that could move heaven and earth
[1:39:04] but he didn't just do that for the
[1:39:05] samaritan woman she was a type of you
[1:39:08] and i
[1:39:08] of the elect that would receive the sign
[1:39:10] of the son of man one who had
[1:39:12] representation in heaven god moved
[1:39:14] heaven and earth and your families to
[1:39:16] bring you here tonight
[1:39:18] so you could hear this message
[1:39:20] at this time
[1:39:23] quit blaming your circumstances quit
[1:39:25] quit spending your life worrying laying
[1:39:28] down on your bed and letting the
[1:39:29] thoughts overcome you of anger and fear
[1:39:33] don't get nervous god's got it
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:37] he knows why you're going through what
[1:39:38] you're going through
[1:39:40] it's his purpose his providence to bring
[1:39:42] it about he he knew why jonah would go
[1:39:44] through what he did jonah may have never
[1:39:47] understood till he got to heaven
[1:39:50] never understood thought he was a failed
[1:39:52] preacher
[1:39:54] a failed prophet
[1:39:56] who only got mad when he shouldn't have
[1:40:00] that's where the book of jonah ends by
[1:40:01] the way is the last one we read god
[1:40:03] rebuking jonah we don't even know what
[1:40:05] happened to jonah after that because
[1:40:06] when god's done with a man he just takes
[1:40:08] him off the earth he's done with him
[1:40:10] he didn't use stone anymore
[1:40:13] but he used him for a very great purpose
[1:40:15] god is using your life tonight for a
[1:40:17] very great purpose you may not see what
[1:40:19] it is but maybe that redemption arc is
[1:40:21] coming back
[1:40:22] that circle's coming around maybe you're
[1:40:24] the one that gets the benefit from
[1:40:26] something god did hundreds of years
[1:40:28] ago
[1:40:30] you just let god be god quit trying to
[1:40:32] play god
[1:40:33] let god be god
[1:40:35] i don't have to have my hands in every
[1:40:37] little thing that goes on in every
[1:40:38] church and then every little thing that
[1:40:40] goes on in this church god help me
[1:40:41] tonight
[1:40:42] i don't have to play god
[1:40:45] god knows what he's doing
[1:40:49] god plays himself quite well
[1:40:52] you don't have to
[1:40:54] oh god
[1:40:55] you don't have to act
[1:40:57] he knows what he's doing
[1:40:59] let's just let him be god can we do that
[1:41:01] tonight
[1:41:02] just let it rest in his hands

[1:41:38] we don't want to be impressed with our
[1:41:40] own abilities tonight but lord we are so
[1:41:43] impressed with yours
[1:41:45] we were your thoughts before the
[1:41:46] foundation of the world the prophet of
[1:41:48] god told us that that's why we could
[1:41:49] hear the message in our day
[1:41:51] that's why we had a desire to be here
[1:41:53] tonight we were your thoughts and we may
[1:41:56] have come down a hard path there may
[1:41:58] have been a lot of detours along the way
[1:42:01] but lord we know that there's a direct
[1:42:02] path
[1:42:04] of things that have been going on for
[1:42:05] many many years you've moved heavens and
[1:42:08] earth and we may not know till we get
[1:42:10] there

[1:42:35] jonah may have thought he had a great
[1:42:36] idea of what god should do
[1:42:38] but lord you knew better

[1:42:42] will and let you be god
