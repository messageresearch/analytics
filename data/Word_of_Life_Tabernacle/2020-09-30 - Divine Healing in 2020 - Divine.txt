for your presence thank you for your uh being there with us lord and the times when we needed you the most and so we're thankful father that you're still here you've not forsaken us during this time of trouble but you're still the same yesterday today and forever lord i thank you for those who you brought back among us lord that have been sick and i pray for those that are sick tonight lord we think of the family of sister sims lord and different ones that are in sick and in need tonight in need of comfort and need of healing father i pray that somehow your word would go out to them today and that there would be healing that it would inspire their faith to believe lord that you're still god i pray you grant it now and lord speak through me tonight i just this subject that i've taken lord tonight i believe that you gave it to me and for the church for our church and i pray god that you would just minister lord to every life and every heart will give you the praise and the glory and the honor in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to psalms chapter 103 verse 1. we're going to take a break from our corinthians series tonight and and this has been on my heart not only because so many have been sick but because the lord is dealing with me in this area you know i want to i want to title this divine healing in 2020 and you know we say god is a healer and we believe that but we need our faith to be inspired to that and you know that's what god does for us so many times and i the word that's the job of the word is to inspire our faith to that and so i want to just give you the the word tonight and there's some things here that just been on my heart and i pray that we would understand it and and be able not only to understand it with our minds but again to be inspired by it psalms chapter 103 and verse one of bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfyeth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening we don't hear as much about healing in 2020 even as much as i did when i was a kid divine healing but probably some of you are old enough to remember when divine healing was something that was talked about regularly in the church and we believe in healing but it seems like that maybe we forgot that we needed it and and i'm speaking broadly tonight as as a church as americans especially we begin to feel invincible because everything is is accounted for even if we don't have a cure for it we know what it does and how long we'll have it and if it's going to kill us or not and and all those things and and so you kind of have a general idea and you get a feeling it's bad and you go to the doctor and we thank god for doctors that we're able to do that but this year many of those things change that feeling of invincibility has kind of been lifted from us because uh we don't feel like that we have the answers for this coronavirus we don't feel like that we know exactly what it's going to do and how bad it is if it's good or bad or if it's political or apolitical if it only attacks republicans or democrats or we know that it don't only attack democrats because i had it and but you know but uh we don't bring post not supposed to bring politics in the pulpit but you know we don't know much about it and and we don't have there's no vaccine there's no cure that we know of and especially and no one has immunity to it unless you got it this year already and and those kind of diseases have always existed but in the last hundred years many of them were eradicated and people who grew up in my generation really weren't affected by any of it and so in 2020 something changed we realized we needed god as a healer and we we do need god as a healer and but it's this current crisis that's kept us from that and and yet there are ways that we have of inspiring people's faith and i guess the most frustrating thing for me and just being honest as a minister of the gospel is not being able to deal with it in the way you normally would a sickness because you normally would go and to the person who's sick and and you would go to their home and you would pray with them if they couldn't come or you'd have hands laid on them at the altar but this is a disease that when it strikes it it keeps them away from people and so it makes it very hard for a pastor to do his job it makes it very hard for a church to do what we would normally do usually if there's a lot of sickness going through the church you could have a brethren to preach and maybe it has a gift of healing in his life or or has a special ability to bring up faith among the people and you could have that that preacher in you could bring a group of people together and we our faith could be lifted and and those are ways that we have of dealing with with sickness and inspiring our faith to believe that we are that god's a healer and and yet this year it's hard to do that and if we call it a special meeting it might be a mistake because there you know we might spread the sickness and we uh you can't do it because the sickness spreads through human contact and so so we begin to wonder how do we deal with this but i like this quote that brother branham stated in in what here is now elijah he said god in all ages at all times has always had a way of divine healing always now that's pretty clear isn't it that all ages at all times he's always had a way of divine healing always he said all the way back in the old testament all the way through the new testament down to the new age right to this present time god's had a fountain open listen for those who believe amen and i trust that's us tonight we're the ones who believe for divine healing and and so there's a fountain open in 2020 and i want us to understand that tonight god did not leave us in 2020 he didn't pencil that out of his of his of his book he didn't just draw a line through that said no healing in 2020 but he's still a healer today just as much as he ever was we just realized we needed it more and so we begin to get desperate for it and and we begin to cry out for healing and that's the hour when he comes around during that darkest hour i think of the man and i mentioned him often but the man of the pool of bethesda how that he waited there and it becomes such a disappointment to him that he'd had this infirmity for 38 years and and the pool the angel would visit the pool and the waters would be troubled but he couldn't get down quick enough and brother madam even said that they would stab one another going down to to try to be the first one to get down fight with one another to get down to the pool and he couldn't get down quick enough and he laid there for 38 years disappointed but while he was in his disappointment christ came to him personally and and provided a way for healing when he couldn't get to the healing meeting he couldn't do what you would normally do like everybody else did to get to where the waters were troubled he provided a way and i believe that that same god that same jesus christ that came to him at the pool of bethesda is here tonight to come among in our midst and wherever you are if you're watching or wherever that you're hearing this he's there he's able to come in our midst even when we can't do what we would normally do he's still god and he come to the man and he said if you want to be well will thou be made whole do you want to be well if you want to be well there's a way for you to be well pick up your bed and walk why do we need divine healing today well we don't need divine healing because it's 20 20. we need divine healing because we're humans right and that's the human condition we get sick now genesis 2 17 stated that in the day thou eater thou shalt surely dying and so that's what caused all death but it's not that not god's fault it's the fault of the fall the human condition and the devil brings it now brother branham tells us that all sickness he said we have to find first that all sickness came from the devil god is not the author of sickness no sickness comes from god now he said god sometimes permits satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of god when you've disobeyed but sickness in its beginning come from the devil he said could you imagine a person that would believe that god our heavenly father would be the author of such a thing as sickness and death well no he said he isn't never was never will be god permits death because of disobedience you say well whose disobedience adam's disobedience he's disobedience he permits death because of disobedience god permits death as one writer said all that death can do god harnessed it to a buggy and paul says it pulls us into the presence of god now we know and and you've been taught that the cure for death and disease and sin or it's the same cure is the one for sin which is the atonement made by jesus christ on the cross that's the atonement for sin and when the cure for sin is there then the cure for sickness is there because sin is the root cause of sickness and so first peter 2 24 says who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins live unto righteousness by whose stripes were healed so we can say we're already healed it's in the atonement and and then if that's the case so why do christians get sick why do christians get sick well it's because the atonement does not affect us in the flesh in a permanent way now i hope you're hearing me because this is important when we get saved as well because you won't always feel saved right you can feel the effect of the atonement when you are saved you get down go down to an altar maybe you're maybe at home or wherever that it was you feel that effect on your flesh but that effect may leave but you're still saved right because that atonement goes down to the soul it takes care of the soul but now when you're healed you'll get sick again and that's just because you're human and it only has a passing effect on the flesh because it's still flesh it's still cursed now brother branham tells us as long as you're in this life he said you're going to be sticky he talked about that that sticky nature he said as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live he said but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up and you talk about the resurrection when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you he said that's the thing again in conferences he said not only to the healing of the body but healing of the soul also he said which is far more essential than healing the body he said it is possible if you live long enough you get sick again he said because the sickness the bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous but god delivereth them out of them all he said so we have many afflictions promised but a deliverance from them aren't you glad for that many afflictions promised he didn't promise it would be an easy road but he promised deliverance amen now it's something that i have to address because i've seen it and people have said it if someone tells you that if you believe a certain doctrine if you go to a certain church if you see things in the message a certain way that you won't get sick you won't catch covet they're lying to you right they're liars the church you go to has nothing to do with whether or not your flesh can catch coronavirus right or anything else for that matter huh and and you wait you would ask someone like that do you still catch colds because if you still have colds you're still susceptible to viruses right and and so and so they're just not telling the truth but we do have an atonement now in the old testament and i just love the way that this works because in the old testament god did offer to the israelites the ability to be protected from these diseases that come on the egyptians and i want to read that in exodus 15 26 he says and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god notice if thou wilt diligently hearken and we'll do that which is right in his sight and we'll give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes now that's asking a lot he said if you'll do all these things i will put none of these diseases upon me which i brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee now brother branham talked about that that i am the lord that healeth you that's the promise and that promise is apart from what he says i will put none of these diseases on these and i'm the lord that healeth thee brother branham talked about how dr moses had a one prescription and the lord that healeth he could go and whatever was wrong he said if somebody broke their leg if a mother had problem in childbirth whatever it was dr moses just wrote him a prescription i am the lord that healeth thee right and so we can still write that today but if you look at that first part where they he said if you'll do this if you'll do that if you'll do that no one ever kept that part of the bargain very good the israelites sure certainly didn't if you were diligently hearken they complained all the time would do what is right they did everything wrong huh keep all these statutes and they did everything they could to break them and so no one ever kept that part of the bargain and so you find in numbers 21 6 that after this that the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and and they bit the people and much people of israel died from a plague of serpents after he said if you'll keep these things but they didn't keep these things right they murmured and they complained and god allowed them to come because of their disobedience and but we find that's the general condition of man in ecclesiastes 7 and 20 says there's not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not paul said it this way he said all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so you say well i'm protected because of my works no you're not no one's ever been protected but just because of their works but look now but they needed something and i love that god provided them an atonement in spite of their disobedience so healing is not based on works right and many times we get a feeling that well if i could just do this and jump through these hoops and go no healing is based on the atonement not on what we do not even on how much we pray or how much we seek god although that's part of it but it's it's our faith that counts it's how much we can believe god's word how much faith we can have in that atonement now so moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent this is in numbers 21 9 if the serpent had bitten any man when he had beheld the serpent of brass he lived what was that an atonement speaking of christ on the cross that sin the serpent would be judged aren't you glad they're still in atonement today but it's not an atonement of works because if the atonement of works had worked they would have never needed the atonement are you with me now now there is a case and we know his message people we've heard you've heard brother branham say it many times that he said pray that there would not be a feeble one among them or he would speak of a church where there could not be a feeble one among them like israel when they entered the promised land he said they had not a feeble one among them in a church like that that's my prayer too i pray tonight that we would leave that way every one of us would leave here healed every one of us we pray that way and i do believe that god will have a church and i know that we we know that at the time of the rapture that there will be a group of people with such faith that they'll take a body change be more than just healing but their whole body is going to change right and that could happen tonight yes it could if it happened tonight then that would be the end of it we would never get sick again amen it could happen tonight but now if it may not happen tonight but you could be healed tonight and we could all be healed there could be such faith rise among us as our faith is inspired by the word that we could all go out healed but now if we did that we'd get sick again right but there's coming a day when it's over amen i'm so glad i'm looking forward to that day now brother madam says i may not have enough faith to make every word of it act he said but i certainly wouldn't stand in the way of anybody that did have that faith he said enoch had faith in us one day to take an afternoon stroll with god amen it's that next slide he said enoch had faith in us to take an afternoon stroll with god and just keep on walking went up home without dying amen that's the kind of faith we need everybody had enough faith that we could he could just walk on home he said now i think the church has got to come to that he said to a rapturing faith he said i may not have that faith just now but i sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that faith he said so we trust that god will give us great faith now watch how he takes this so we're looking for that but we trust that god will give us great faith and tomorrow amen he said that there will not be a feeble person left in the building when they come through for prayer he said we'll just believe that so how will we meet the challenge of 2020 with divine healing it's by faith in the atonement and that's the same way that we'll have faith for a rapture you can't work yourself into a rapture you make yourself ready because you have the token you have christ within you and he's working through you you're making yourself ready but you're not putting yourself you can't make a rapture happen are you with me now you can't force it to happen but it happens why because rapturing faith comes by rapturing grace brother brown speaks in the countdown of how that the astronauts he said are all wrapped up in christ he says what are they doing they are wrapped in christ in rapturing grace amen what is that that's the atonement they're wrapped in grace that's what he he protects them with don't you see you have that protection today it may not keep you from getting sick but there's healing there and if you ever get it on the soul you don't ever have to worry about it anymore amen so he he said nothing nothing they did themselves i love this this is the astronauts who are ready to blast off to go into another world he said nothing they did themselves christ took the uneducated the foolish things of the world wrapped his astronauts in it and empowered them with the holy ghost to take off amen now again brother branham talks about rapturing grace and three kinds of believers he said that's the reason i do believe when that bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing grace how do you have rapturing faith by faith in the same atonement right because it's rapturing grace how do we receive divine healing in 2020 we come god's provided way and brother branham preached a sermon in 1954 called god's provided way of healing if you're in need of healing or or maybe you you just need your faith to be inspired i recommend you listen to that it's not very long but it's an afternoon service but he said now and this i'm just pulling a few quotes from it but you can go back and listen to the whole thing or read it but he said now when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness it's that very hour that your healing has come now watch and brother branham deals with this that you can't just be uh you can't just believe but your faith has to be inspired right to believe in the right kind of way and brother branham talks about that how that you have mental faith and the subconscious faith he said if you don't have that subconscious faith then have that mental faith until you do have it right and so you never say anything negative you don't say oh i i i'm not healed but you say i am healed you claim that promise but one day then it it drops down with the jt and it's something different then it doesn't matter what what the symptoms are you know you're healed there's some things you just know and nothing could ever shake that amen oh my and so you know that you're healed now he said it's when you're when you receive the inspiration that jesus christ died for your sickness it's that very hour that your healing has come remember faith is a revelation he said that's right when you receive from heaven that jesus died for your sins and you have accepted it you don't need any prayer for you then you've already accepted it it's settled amen he said brother bannon goes into how people's faith is inspired he said now we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word he said that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation he said something slips out of the unseen world yonder i love the way he puts this comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it he said your eyes brighten you can you can look and see someone who can see jesus christ died for my sins not just to say it but to really know it the atonement's been made when you get a revelation of that atonement that's been made he said your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice why because you caught a revelation amen hallelujah if you catch that revelation it doesn't matter what the devil does to you and it doesn't matter how hard he tries to keep us apart how many church services he can shut down how many meetings that to get cancelled it doesn't matter why you caught a revelation of faith you caught a revelation that he died for you you caught a revelation i'm healed that inspiration strikes now he said something's going to happen you don't need to be in a prayer line then you've got it then and brother branham may think of in perfect faith brother branham said that he said people say they have perfect faith and then come in the prayer line if you had perfect faith you wouldn't need to we need our faith to be inspired that's why we come in a prayer line right but if we had perfect faith we wouldn't have to now he says now that's where if everybody in this building at this time with getting that kind of an attitude every person would be perfectly healed he said now how do we get people that way and that's what's so frustrating about 2020 it's hard to get people in that atmosphere he says how do we get people that way he said some can receive it some cannot receive it but those who can receive it they look at it and accept it and believe it he said others maybe in another meeting he said now that's one way he said of preaching it by the word that's what i'm doing tonight one way of preaching it by the word he said another way is maybe somebody speak with tongues he said they give an interpretation to reveal the secrets of their heart he said or maybe there'd be someone who was a prophet would stand and do something in the supernatural that you look up and say oh there it is there it is he said then something happens to you now again and this is farther down in the same message he said remember when god is making his revelation revealing himself to the to his people he said now that's the benefit of the meetings that's what god gave the gifts for was to magnify him and that's when healing can come is when we magnify him right we make him king not ourselves not our own ideas our own priorities but we make him king he said and that's when healing can come he said and he said that's what god gives the gifts for was to magnify him and to unify the people and to bring the body together he says and to help us to unite our efforts and our prayers he said a person sitting in a group of people like this where faith is gathered on every side it'll help you to get well and people want to draw away more and more from the house of god but look he said it'll help you get well why it inspires your faith you remember brother branham talking about how that he would he would discern and someone would have heart trouble and then that those demons would begin to cry out for help and they they'd receive strength from other demons all over the building right and the devil was dumb really because it really just identified where he was right so prophet could see it but now they would crowd and help one another but don't you realize faith works the same way and when we gather together and with people sitting on every side it helps you get well why because your faith inspired somebody else's faith maybe they didn't come with the faith that they needed and it's been a hard week and things have been rough and they've been coughing and and and everything's been going wrong and their body's sick but when they sit in the presence of god suddenly your faith inspired somebody else's faith inspires somebody else's faith pretty soon there's healing going on so we still believe in that right and so he said where faith is getting gathered on every side that'll help you to get well there there'll be people he said who listens at the word being taught amen in that kind of an atmosphere there'll be people who listen to the word being taught that'll never be in a prayer line yet they'll get well amen for something happens subconsciously maybe that they don't even realize what it's about he said they'll get well somebody sitting and watch one of the signs of the lord appear and they'll get well he said see when it's when faith anything he said that can stimulate that faith on down but the brother said now these meetings and people gathering he said that's what it's for it's to encourage faith to bring faith up we couldn't heal certainly not but we have a part in doing it he said that's preaching the gospel that's one part in doing it another part would be speaking in tongues that's in part if it's by revelation he said a gift of prophecy that's another of that he said then signs and wonders and everything is gifts and everything in the church to stimulate the church to keep the church together for every attribute of jesus life until he returns again in glory and how many times have we seen that you'll be in a meeting or at a place where god will be moving maybe it's just a regular church service but others are there and you see someone really get blessed by god and you watch it begin to spread right and that's why we do that to inspire our faith to stimulate our faith but how do we do that in 2020 look it's kind of a downer isn't it now we're doing that tonight but there's not people sitting all around you some of you sitting six feet away and more from everybody else and we try to be as careful as we can here and i'll say as a church i think we've we've done everything we can and you can't stop everything but we we've the lord has blessed us to keep it from just running roughshod through the church and and having to shut down again and i pray it'll continue that way of course it's helped that i already had it and and so it's you know i'd be the one and i feel i would feel terrible spreading it to anyone but haven't already had it i don't feel as bad about that although they say you could may be able to catch it again but you're human you'll get sick again right but every time we try to do something in 2020 it gets canceled do you see why i'm just preaching from my heart tonight but do you see why we try so hard to get people in the house of god and preachers if they don't watch it will get so careful about that and so bothered by the people that don't come that they it destroys their ministry they can't preach to people that are there and i strive not to do that but it's you don't want people to come just because you want them to hear you but you know if they come they can be inspired if they'll just come and that's why one of the best ways we can witness is just invite people to church come and see as the woman at the well said come and see amen and so there's something here among us that we believe god can move in our midst but many church services have been canceled meetings have been canceled but the atonement is still there you see these other things are just to inspire our faith but the atonement is still the same right it didn't get taken away and as i thought about these things and i won't hold you very long tonight but just just now think deeply with me for a moment why would god allow this to come where we couldn't maybe have our faith inspired the way we would want to during a time when we really needed it but you look at it and in matthew 8 and 8 it says the centurion and this is the one who come to jesus and he said my my servant is really sick and jesus said i'll come to him and the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only my servant shall be healed i want to deal with that for a moment because this is divine healing in 2020 we may not be able to we may be frustrated in our attempts sometimes to do all that we want to do and be able to gather together like we want but he says speak the word only now when brother branham he had third three polls in his ministry in his healing ministry in three polls in his ministry his first poll was the sign in the hand and the second poll was discernment and visions and the third poll was the opening of the word which was identified by the spoken word right i think we could all agree on that now so brother branham talks about that third poll and he speaks of how what it is in watchmen one of the night he said how many is in the building tonight that remember when i first come up the west coast he said down to the south and he said just had that one ministry of laying laying of hands he said can you remember that just look at the friends he said all right he said then did i tell you that the lord told me there would be another ministry he said you remember that which would be the discerning of the thoughts of the heart and so forth he said well then ministries have worked perfectly the world around see one went its day the other one lived its day now brother branham even up to the end of his life still used all three he would show the people that he still had the sign in the hand he still had saw the visions called the people out showed that the sign of the son of man and the sign of the resurrection he showed those things but now something more was coming on but here's what's interesting is that as it become more and more real and more and more powerful the greatest part of his ministry was also the part where the pentecostals thought he lost it and the greatest part of his ministry was when it seemed like less people were healed than ever before and a man who'd who'd seen thousands come by a prayer line in jonesboro all of a sudden he's talking about fish that got healed resurrected possums right and if you're a pentecostal mover and shaker of that day you you could be forgiven maybe for thinking man why don't you get focused you know and they said they said you do the prayers the prayer lines wrong and everything like that and brother random ask the angel of the lord how should i do it he said just as you feel led so brother branham would try different things and do it different ways but he always come back to that now watch the first one they had to be very close to him he had to touch him i believe was in his left hand he had to he had to grab hold of him with the visions he didn't have to grab hold of them in fact there were many and we've we've witnessed that with many people with testimonies that they'd be at the back of the church never met him and he'd call them out and tell them what their name was where they come from that they were healed and god used that to build their faith for divine healing right along with showing the sign of the son of man now he knows the secrets of our heart but the spoken word was different because it was in secret he said it won't be a public show so he says then he says them ministries worked perfectly the world round then that next quote he said now a little later on if i get a chance he said what i i want to tell you what happened just recently bringing in a new ministry he said i'll just speak the word listen what he says and it puts it right back into the lap of the people again now listen what he says if they will come with the right attitude and belief it's got to happen and so what instigated it with hattie wright was hattie wright said it's nothing but the truth what was it they said she said the right thing now if they will come with the right attitude and believe now brother branham speaks of a time when the third poll will be fully manifested and i want us to to look at this and sometimes we shy away from these quotes because they're so badly misunderstood but i want to read these tonight because because people will take this and they look for brother branham to come back and do it but look what god was doing he was moving from the sign of the hand to the visions a greater distance to the spoken word speak the word only the servants miles away right and and so he's moving a distance from the man and brother brown would say things like who did she touch who did he touch amen we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity right now brother branham speaks for that time he said now remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it can't be he said now it's in existence he said i've i've warned of this that soon he said right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up he said and when it does he said the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down he said then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power again in shalom but the brown says we all know that's the identification we know what the third poll is he said we all understand that he said now you've got you'll have the tape see he said i think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on he said that's when it be that it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly now if you look at the nature of it and we'll look at it in just a moment of that spoken word the thing about it is people say well then brother branham has to come back and and do that no because the thing about the third poll is it's in you the word is in you it's in me are you with me now yes it was in a prophet he said that's identifying him but it'll lay dormant for a while but there's something coming oh he said to be at a time of the squeeze and people misunderstand the squeeze i've always always thought this because of the nature of of the age that we live in we live in laodicea and if we look at a squeeze as just the persecution of people well there are some countries where they're being persecuted many countries and so you have to be careful when you draw a line and say well when the squeeze comes then they'll just shut us all up brother said before they shut us up we'll go up people misunderstand in daniel 11 32 it says such as do wickedly against the covenant should be corrupt by flatteries how will they be corrupt by flatteries that's how he gets them you know the remarkable thing about job was not all the trials he endured he said he was a rich man and was a perfect man do you ever think about that job was one of the wealthiest men in the world at that time and served god with a perfect heart no wonder god could trust him because a rich man will hardly even enter the kingdom of heaven but job was a rich man but he was a perfect man and so god knew when he took all that away he'd still serve him because he'd already been tested by the wealth are you with me now now he said he'll corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their god should be strong and do exploits and the feast of the trumpets brother brown says and and this is i've referenced lately so i wanted to bring the quote so that you don't you know and i know i've used it before he said notice there she is now she's loosed he's talking about the demons loosed in the ecclesiastical realm out of the euphrates river he said it was loosed in a in a natural way on the jews lost in an ecclesiastical realm on the bride but he said there there she is now she's loosed to do what to call all these little loose ends oh well don't make any difference anyhow no we're real close to that squeeze we still got money in the bank we still got most of us doing we still got things that that you know you might be poor there's poor and there's rich but but for the most part we live pretty good whenever we think we don't we need to take a trip to a third world country and you find out we do just look across the border to mexico and you'll find out we do live pretty good but we've seen this attitude it doesn't make any difference we've seen that we've seen that right among us no matter what i do don't make any difference what the message says don't make any difference with these little loose sins that a prophet of malachi 4 a prophet of revelation 10 7 come to tie those two sins together to finish the mystery of god it doesn't matter what anybody what what it says don't make any difference anyhow people say well he was just a lying prophet people that preached the message for years turn their backs on it we're close to that are you with me now and here's you can take this for what it's worth if it's a seed spit it out but i believe when it changes from flatteries to force because it will change we go home because he won't let his bride go through that persecution that tribulation period now when the squirrels were spoken into existence brother branham was thinking about this scripture in mark chapter 11 verse 23 he said for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that these things those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith he said whosoever shall say this is mark 11 23 whosoever shall say to this mountain you know there's no song that was taken that said whosoever includes me surely means me surely being with me you know you apply that to this whosoever is pretty broad whosoever that's the scripture that brother branham is pondering and he deals with that in perfect faith he's talking about those squirrels and things and during the sermon and then he says now he said when the same god comes to you he said and is pleased to dwell in you you're speaking how he's pleased to dwell in his son jesus christ he said he's pleased to dwell on you please to honor your word what your decision is he said what was joshua's decision stand still son and it stood there bad you remember the angel told brother branhammer that voice spoke to him and said make your decision he didn't tell him how many he said make your decision joshua's decision was stand still son and it stood there amen what was moses decision he held his stick over a river and called for it to open and it opened remember he said why cry speak he said see whatever you ask see that works in 2020. amen he said whatever you ask and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt see in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said now brother branham makes a remarkable statement here he said that puts you back in the word amen that puts you back in the word so the third poll was not about brother branham coming back and and and showing us the sign of the third poll he already showed it to us but it puts you back in the word he said now that's not skim milk it puts you back he said i know it's going to jump right over top of you maybe he said see because it can't anchor oh i'm so glad there's a people prepared today for it to anchor him there's got to be during this time he said but real genuine faith catches that right now puts you back in the word that night after preaching this was astounded me the other day when i realized this god didn't do anything by accident but iran preaches perfect faith and i was discussing that with my brother joel talking about how brother brandon preached that and he said well that night he preached he that is in you and it just hit me it just struck me brother branham is continuing on in the same thought he talks about it again and he that is in you he said when thou prayest believe that you receive what you ask for it shall be given to you if you say to this mountain be moved and no doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you can have what you say the father worketh and i worketh hitherto verily verily i send you the son could do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that do it the son likewise he said see and when the father showed him what to do walked out there without a failure of anything and said let it be and it was amen and that same christ amen the next slide i want you to see it that same christ lives in you very bad he makes it very clear he said he lives in us then his works will do because christ is the word and the promise of the word brings healing to you so to elevate your faith to inspire your faith what did he do in this hour he opened up the entire book he opened up the whole book and when we look at and realize who we are that that same christ lives in us our faith is inspired not just by people around us that's wonderful we still use that not by just a prayer line and a bunch of ministers laying hands on us that's wonderful we'll still use that we'll still continue those things as long as the lord let us those are biblical things not just by a prayer cloth but we'll be inspired to speak because that same christ lives in you it lives in us then his works will do because christ is the word and the promise of the word brings healing to you i wonder if in 2020 brother joe he wanted us to know what it was like to speak make a decision and walk in it without without any support at times when it seemed like the whole world's going crazy but you're walking right in the middle of the storm so you had to bring the storm where a prophet couldn't have stealed the storm you can't speak to the storm unless there's a storm there well i hope you're hearing me i'm not saying that 2020 is the year or that coronavirus is the storm now hear me i'm not saying that but what if it was then if it was he would inspire your faith to speak to that storm are you with me now there will be a storm there'll have to be a storm that comes that's why he said it'll happen during the squeeze there's got to be a storm that comes so you can speak to the storm there's got to be trials coming you'll never know what it's like just walk in faith you got to know what it's like sometimes to not have the money in the bank you got to know what it's like sometimes to not have the the health in your body you got to know what it's like why because you got to walk in it there's no storm you can't speak to it if there's no need the need can't be met i hope you're hearing it tonight now brother branham says the promise of the word brings healing to you he says i will not live leave you comfortless he said as i pray i asked a while ago in matthew 24 28 20 he said i will come to you be in you i the person christ in the form of the holy ghost will come and live in you he said then you won't be yourself no more i'll be in you and greater is he that's in you than he that sent the world greater is he that's in you than coronavirus because coronavirus couldn't even be here unless god had a meeting with the devil had a meeting with god and went before him and asked permission to send it right whether it come from a bat whether it comes from a chinese lab however it come from whatever the way the devil got it into the human race before it could come the devil had to go ask permission then if the devil asked permission then there must be a people who have proven during these the time like job that they would stand for and then he said if you take it all away they'll still stand for me amen amen what does it make you makes you a warrior it makes you somebody who can stand in spite of difficulty i'm closing with this what if he wants to prove to you that you have the power to speak the word and even the mountain of coronavirus or whatever else that it is will be moved he said well it took me two weeks to recover of it but you're healed you're healed what what you look at it and think i'm not trying to downplay it i know personally but i know how hard it is these other brothers can tell you how hard it is and the sisters that have had it could tell you it's nothing to laugh at something to respect but greater is he that's in you then he whoever he is that's in the world and if god can stop a storm he can stop the sickness but maybe he's waiting on a bride to speak let's bow our heads together musicians come maybe that's a little different than what you thought but that's divine healing in 2020. god has a way he always had a way brother brown said that always i believe four times in that quote he always has a way of bringing his people divine healing would you just talk to the lord for a moment we're going to have a a time of prayer together where there's a lot of sickness going on and you don't know how helpless it makes me feel as a pastor to not be able to address some of these things and i told brother joe the other day i said you know what i'm tired of you know we know god's a healer but i'm ready to see some healing i see god begin to move i'm ready for that i believe i believe our faith is ready for that let's let's take whatever steps are necessary and see that happen but i've seen god move i've seen him step up in many many ways but he's not we're not waiting on him the hour is here he's waiting on us let's just talk to him for a moment and you just in your own way just just talk to god and say lord lord i inspire my faith whatever it takes i want my faith to be inspired i may not be able to go to a meeting i may not be able to do that but but i have a word that's been opened to me in this hour you he spoke there's a voice that you can still listen to there's still a there's still a prophet in the land if you could say it that way the holy ghost is still here he's still inspiring his people then just ask him lord inspire my faith tonight quicken my faith bring it to life so that i can see healing in my body and in my friends and my family those around me heavenly father lord god we believe in healing we believe that you're the healer we believe that you're the savior of our souls lord we believe that you lord made the atonement for us oh god we're trusting in that atonement today we come not not by our own works lord but we come according to faith lord i i want to reach out and touch every person but lord it may inspire their faith if a man can touch them but how much more lord would it inspire our faith if we could feel that touch from you tonight if we could know that you're a high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmity oh god may we catch that revelation tonight of who you are may there be a reality in our lives lord has a church that you died for us some lord has said that that's too simple but they don't realize it's the very third poll itself lord to bring us to a place that we can see that you're still living you're still here you're not just the god of yesterday but until we have a revelation of what your atonement did we can't we can't go move on we can't have healing but lord we want that revelation today more so than we've ever had oh god would you just move in our midst lord i pray for those that are sick and in need i pray especially for those here in the church lord i pray that you'd move over every situation god you know where it's at lord if they're streaming tonight and lord maybe in pain or having sickness in her body fever whatever it is we believe that devil is defeated was defeated on the cross lord may we may we speak to that sickness tonight lord and it be gone i pray that it would be so help us to make a decision lord and step forward and speak your lord in your name we believe that it'll happen god i pray for those lord we see the attack on the ministry in this hour we've seen that that squeezed in that way lord come down how that different ones lord have caused so many problems but lord we know that you're still god you still have men that'll serve you god i pray for those men tonight i pray for especially for the aaron oglesby tonight lord in the hospital i pray god that you just continue to help him lord that you'd resurrect him from the hospital bed or different ones that have lost loved ones or different ones that are very sick god you know how to when the time comes we all have to die but i pray lord jesus said that the time would come whether we'd have so much faith we just walk off the earth god i pray that it would be so may it be even tonight lord maybe even tonight lord before we go to bed may there be such a reality in our hearts lord that we could just go home and be with you may it be so lord god we don't know the day or the hour but we know you're very close we see the signs appearing we see the things all around us but we know lord that you're still god lord we believe you lord we stand on your word i can't stand on anything that i can do but i can stand on your word lord in the atonement of the hour you made a way lord for the children of israel when when the snake was biting when the plague was in the land they could look if they would look they could live oh god if we could only look today and see the sin has been judged and see our redeemer lives and sees the same yesterday today and forever lord if we could look and see a lamb that's taken the book and opened the seals if we can look and see that he's come to redeem us and to claim us by his blood oh god if we look and see that today that we would know that you're here you're able lord you're bigger than any problem that we have help us to accept it lord to believe it to confess it lord until that faith becomes a reality in our hearts and lives grant it father we pray thank you for all that you do thank you for healing us lord thank you for bringing us back together oh god help us
