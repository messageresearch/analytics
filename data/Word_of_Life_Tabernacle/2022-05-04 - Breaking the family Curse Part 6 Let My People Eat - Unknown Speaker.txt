[Music] is [Music] i'm glad he's coming for you yeah thank you lord not for the person down the street or the just the pastor or the sunday school teacher but he's coming for you amen amen i believe that in this hour that we live in amen let's go to first samuel chapter 14 and verse 24 first samuel 14 24 and we'll continue tonight on on breaking the family curse speaking about king saul and i want to title this tonight let my people eat so the joel told me that should have been the title sunday morning let my people eat we've got a uh our kids are gonna have a birthday party this week i think we're gonna do that is it this friday night no next week next friday night so we'll do that then um we got the men's bible study saturday morning at eight o'clock some of you guys want to show up i really appreciated you showing up last month it's been a month now we'll be reading from daniel chapter 2 and studying that a little bit if you want to come to that it'll be from 8 to 9 o'clock on saturday morning and then sunday's mother's day if you're staying after church sunday after the morning service and if you're planning on staying on fellowship hall i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'll put it like this i'm going to cook for my wife now i may not do much of the cleaning but i'm sure that some of us could find oh some of that brother caleb raised his hand my goodness so if we do the cooking the cleanup at the fellowship all those of you that want to stay if you want to go and take your wife out that'd be fine as well but maybe better if some of you did that but but i can i can grill out at least so some that's what i'm going to do this weekend so if y'all want to join me in that you'd sure be welcome to do that and and we'll have some good food and try not to hold you so long this this sunday amen the lord's good to us so isn't he let's read first samuel 14 24 and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had endured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your house again so thankful to be one of your chosen few lord that are standing here not by our own efforts today but because you chose us before the foundation of the world we're thankful for that lord and we pray that you would just move in our midst or move me out of the way speak those things that you would have spoken lord and whatever i would say myself and my own human ability or to help me to keep that quiet lord and may you speak tonight because i know that only you can make a difference in the lives of the people i pray bless each and every one that came out tonight each one that's watching at home i pray that you just bless them abundantly we pray in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated this evening i appreciate that song the king is coming because the problem with saul and the children of israel doing what they did and rejecting the holy spirit and rejecting samuel the leadership of samuel they were rejecting god and his plan there was a king coming yes and they actually uh they actually were trying to set up a kingdom ahead of time when there was one coming and that's the true uh what's true of every denomination of every time there's a a movement that moves what it does is like sarah it sees that maybe things aren't what they're supposed to be or maybe what they think they shouldn't be and so they get in a hurry and anytime you get in a hurry you get in god's way and so the people got in a hurry and said we need a king they did need a king but they didn't need saul they needed david yes we do need a king today but we don't need assault we don't need a denomination we don't need a man we don't need somebody up in up in some city somewhere telling us what to do that's not what we need we need the king yes and the king is coming yes the bible says he's coming and and we find there's a parallel to that if you look in in daniel chapter 7 that there's a parallel to this that before the ancient of days could sit in judgment on the throne that the four beasts had to have their time there had to be a time the gentile kingdoms had to have their time the church ages had to have its time before the king the son of david could reign in the millennium and and so the gentile times had to come and so daniel 7 17 says these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earth but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom this is going to happen there's a king coming yes there's a kingdom coming you're going to reign one of these days as kings and priests but right now don't get ahead of god and try to do it by human effort because you'll mess up god's plan right the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever and he goes on to describe those beasts and that fourth beast and how that it would come and and that roman system and he and then in verse 26 he said but the judgment shall fit and they shall take away his dominion oh i love this oh i'm looking forward to this i believe it's happening right now and we're seeing the beginning of it but there's a kingdom coming and the judgment shall say they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end they shall take it away who's going to take it away not a single person not but but the king the people of the kingdom and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and who and all dominion shall serve and obey him now who's to him that we're talking about here go to the new testament philippians chapter 2 and verse 10 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow there's a king coming church we don't need to lose sight of that and begin to get in a hurry by the allen and begin to begin to try to change the message or change the scriptures to fit our own ideology there's a king coming don't lose heart don't give up don't give up hope because there's a king coming down the road and that king at that name of that king of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father aren't you glad you know the king today you see saul attempted to bring that by force the people of of israel attempted to bring that by force when they should have been watching and saw under his birth path you remember was to be a protector of that king and even down in the millennium you find that the tribe of benjamin is a protector of the king but now saul should have been a protector of david's rights yes are you hearing me now he should have been fighting to protect david's rights but he actually ended up fighting against david yes and we see the benjaminite coming out in him that he began to raven like a wolf now again denominations whether in or out of the message try to bring about a millennial reign by force through some important man somewhere or some sometimes even through a local pastor to try to set the kingdom into into motion but i'll tell you this there will always be a mixed multitude as long as we're here there will always be tares and wheat as long as we're here there will always be three kinds of believers as long as we're here and we don't like to hear that but there will always be good and bad in the church as long as we're here we'll be dealing with this old flesh as long as we're here and so as long as we do that we don't set a kingdom by force are you with me now so now and but this is what happens is and i just want to this is kind of building up to what i want to say tonight but but what saul had done is he'd gotten a messiah complex that he thought he was the only one that could help the people listen if i'm the only one that can help the people god's not doing very good probably his last hope he's not doing very good but there's got to be somebody else out there that can help him as well i believe there's people that are i'm called to and people that are called to listen to my preaching or god wouldn't have called me to preach but at the same time i'm not the only one that can help you there's a five-fold ministry not just one right there's a five-fold ministry and and so you don't just listen to your pastor although i'd appreciate it if you did listen to your pastor when your pastor is preaching but but there's other men that can help you there's men sitting right here in the church that can help you we don't want to get a messiah complex where we feel like we're the only one that can do that god's got people everywhere that they can help one another and if god forbids i would die in a car wreck tonight god would raise up another man to stand in this pulpit and preach the word he already knew it would happen before it ever takes place right so saul began to feel like the people didn't matter like it didn't matter what the deacon said or the trustee said or what the warriors did talk he would just take credit for it right brother branham said that on the rejected king saul would take credit for what jonathan did but notice how different different david was david inspired other mighty men to act and that's the kind of leaders that we want to be don't you want to be that kind of a leader in your home that kind of a leader in your community not that you would be it somebody who would lord be a lord over god's heritage but you'd be someone who who inspires other people to act by your own life and by the way that you live and so david by taking down goliath inspires mighty men to go down and take other giants down right but saul's always taking credit for what other men did so you see the difference those spirits don't die they still live on today so mighty men under saul had to sneak around to do anything for god and then if they did do something saul would take credit for it you'll find that men of god sometimes get this messiah complex elijah had it at the cave when he said lord i'm the only one left and the still small voice spoke to him and he walked out there and he said lord you don't know what's happened but i'm going to tell you god already knew what happened and it's interesting that god never he never responded to elijah's complaint right he just goes and he says now i want you to do this i want you to do that your ministry is not over he said and then i want to tell you this he said there are 7 amen not about their need of baal you're not the only one i've got others you don't even know about so but to saul everything in israel become about saul and what he could do and it gives him gave him a warped view of his own importance remember samuel told him when you were little in your own sight god could work through you but now you're important but really he was only a placeholder until the real king came and so now that's one of the great things brother branham said that man does when he tries to look he said because he looks like cain looked through the glasses he looked at personal achievement cain thought now if i can get abel out of the way then i'm the only one he said see there the other fellow's out of the way he said that's what man has tried to do down through the years is try to get the other fellow out of the way god forbid that that spirit would be around us we don't want to get the other man out of the way we want to promote the other man because the better the other man does the better i do right he said that's what man was trying to do down through the years trying to get the other fellow out of the way when he ought to be trying to bring the other fellow in the way with him and be a brother you see instead of trying to say oh that little group just raked them out and this over here oh well they're this or that we shouldn't do that he said we should be trying to bring the whole thing to one solid picture and that is jesus christ can you say amen to that tonight i'm trying to hurry through this so i don't hold you real long tonight so you just bear with me if i move a little fast go back and listen to it later let's look at saul and his methods and as we begin to look at this in first samuel chapter 13 and 14 we find the philistines had control such control that they actually had sword control or sword if you live in oklahoma they had sword control over the people they like gun control would be today they didn't let them make swords because they tried to keep the weapons out of the hands of the people and so in first daniel 13 21 it tells us though that the children of israel had filed for the maddox and for the cultures and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goats i've always loved that scripture because who would have thought the philistines would have never thought that an ox goat would be used by shamgar to defeat so they left a file there to sharpen the goats and god would use that amen what's in your hand use that yes hallelujah i don't have much use what you've got yes sir and so they left the file to sharpen the ghost but the point is there was no there was no sword nor spear in first samuel 13 22 in the day of battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that was with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found i want to look at jonathan for a moment because he appears suddenly in the narrative and he has saw a son but he's actually a greater warrior than saul and jonathan never loses his place i want you to watch jonathan's life you'll look at he never loses his place he knows that he's not going to be king jonathan knows it saul refuses to believe it but jonathan knows it and yet he's a much better man in many ways than saul was and yet it's a tragic story because he remains with his father and and really nothing else he could do but he remains with him and he's slain with saul because he has identified with his kingdom and every threat to david had to be taken out of the way because david was god's choice now look david didn't do it now remember david does not set himself up to be king by natural means but god does it yes right and that ought to be the way any uh any man of god when you take a position or or in the church for that matter whether it's a song leader or trustee or whatever you you don't go cutting other people down right or deacon i don't know that that's ever happened here god forbid that it would i'm not preaching at you i'm just saying this as a principle you don't cut other people down to elevate yourself that's saul's method but not david's so now he but jonathan has identified with this kingdom so he ends up dying with saul we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end but when you identify yourself with a backslidden ministry if we can say it that way or denominational ministry it's not your job to remove it or to cut it down simply to leave it brown said don't put your confidence in a man when that man leaves the word of god you leave the man he said brother ben if you preach that people will leave well if i leave the word they'll leave and if they leave for some other reason then that's between them and god right but but if i don't want to leave the word i want to stay with god god is the word and so but if i do leave the word and i'm human if i left the word and and stubbornly stubbornly state off of the path of the word then the people ought to leave me because when i leave the word i leave god and that's what the conundrum that jonathan was in being identified with that system he actually he actually died with it first samuel 14 and 1 let's look at this now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bear his armor come let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father now remember last time we preached about ruling by fear ruling by fear always results in deception yeah so jonathan says you know what i i've been in a meeting in a while i haven't seen any devils die in a while so i think it's about time we killed some devils and in first samuel 14 2 saul terried in the uttermost parts of gabia under a pomegranate tree which is in migrant and the people that were with him were about 600 men so notice here was saul here was saul tearing under a tree and jonathan gets to looking at his sword because remember only jonathan and saul had a sword and jonathan begins to look at his sword and said there's got to be something else i can do with this all right other than sit under a tree and gripe about what's coming if i have a sword there must be a reason there must be something listen to me every man ought to get his sword every woman ought to get her sword every one of you every man woman boy and girl ought to get their sword and do something with it and that's what jonathan did he said i got a sword might as well use it the other fellows don't have swords but they don't keep me back right so but he had to sneak out to do it because the pastor wouldn't have let him that's a shame isn't it yes i don't say that i don't say that again you stay jonathan stayed in his in his calling in doing that jonathan was a warrior so he stayed in his calling his warrior didn't try to be king he didn't try to take his sword and cut saul's head off with it right or david's for that matter he didn't try to play politics he went out to fight oh and that's what we ought to do is go out to fight right amen now he he told not his father and and saw terry then under the tree in a higher the son of a tub ichabod's brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord's priest and shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone now notice where saul is and he's in gibeah saul never takes jerusalem david does that later but now god's not speaking to saul i believe one of the reasons god's not speaking to saul is he's remaining in the mentality that this priest is somehow going to help him this priest come from a backslidden family a priest if you go back and run his lineage back he was uh the bible tells us he's the brother of ichabod ichabod means the lord is the glory is departed it was the time when the when the ark of the covenant was taken down into the philistine lands and because of the way that hoffney infinite house eli's sons were acting right and so this is the grandson and he's there in the uh there with them in in shiloh and saul thinks well surely the lord will speak because he's a priest but he doesn't recognize that god that god has changed over he's not working in that old denomination anymore but he's actually working through the prophet samuel yes right and but instead of waiting on the prophet samuel we're trying to find out what samuel had to say about it he actually goes and consults this backslidden priest now verse 6 jonathan said to the young man that bear his armor come let us go over into the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us oh my for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few sure amen god don't need big numbers to save people he don't need big numbers to have church you don't need big numbers to feel the presence of god you don't need big numbers to do the things that we need to do and and and have a the the power of god among us you don't need that you don't need big numbers to heal but what is it he actually he whatever number you are he with him is a majority is that right so he said there's no restraint to the lord god's not restrained because there's less there's only two of us amen why not that's what i would say tonight why not go out and fight yes why not stand for the gospel why not believe the message of the hour why not believe that god still does miracles why not believe god will save your children why not come to church happy yeah why not come with a smile on your face why not live for god why not give it everything you've got instead of coming in backslidden and cold sitting under a tree somewhere pick up your sword yes i might as well use it you've got one you might as well use it why not say well there's only a few of us i'll just sit back tonight why not believe god are you with me tonight yeah why not believe god and jonathan said to the young man he said there's no restraint it's no restraint that there's only two of us but god is able with god we have a majority so now jesus brother randall said counts character not members she said you know that he counts characters he got a few here doesn't he he counts characters god has always tried to get one man in his hand or can you say tonight i'll be that one man there may not be a bunch of people sitting around me tonight it may not be a huge crowd on a wednesday night but lord i know you don't count men you count characters yes he always tried to get one man in his hand he said that's all he needs is one man and he'll do his work through the years amen well i believe his work is continuing today verse 7 and his armor bearer said unto him i love the attitude of the armor bearer he said do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart it wasn't his idea to have the meeting or to go to the meeting but he said i'm with you i hope you're hearing me now i'm with you i thought of brother neville when i thought of this because brother neville was brother brandon's right-hand man behind in the shadows at jeffersonville and he would always always step aside for brother branham to come in and always support him even though he didn't have the gift of a prophet and i can imagine it must have hurt his feelings sometimes when the crowds would come in when brother branham was there and you can imagine what it would be like as a pastor when everybody calls and and you know we've got churches today like that you know his brother so and so preaching and sometimes they want to know what night so and so preaching so that they can come because if they're not preaching they might as well just stay at home it doesn't matter nothing nothing you'd be surprised what god can do yes you'd be surprised what god can do if you give him half a chance but brother neville just had a you know just a regular ministry just like mine or any other pastors would be and i thought about him and brother brown said this about him and christ is the mystery of god revealed he said you people here he said hold him up like joshua and caleb held up the hands of moses as he's bringing the word he said but not tonight's not my night to preach tonight's not my night to sing tonight's not my night to i'll just sit back and wait let somebody make me happy no hold up the hands of the minister hold up the hands of the pastor you may not be the one but you can be like the armored bearer and says i'm with you do what's in your heart yes hey man hold up his hands as he's bringing the word how do you do that you know how you keep my hands up you know how you keep my spirits up you know how you keep me from faltering you know how you keep these other brothers from faltering by saying amen so be it sick and boy that's how you keep my hands up right hold his hands there you say i don't feel like it but you're not doing it for yourself you're doing it for the others you're holding their hands up as long as moses hands were up the people had victory amen brother branham said this he said we can make ourselves nothing you can't make bishops and prophets and so forth you can't manufacture it it's got to be born in you got to be the spirit of god predestinated from the foundation of the world god said in the church god did what he did and when we try to impersonate we lose our influence how many times have i seen that when you try to be some other preacher you lose your influence he said it's like a ball game somebody at a football game somebody gets the ball and every one of his own players trying to take the ball right away from him he said you can't win the game be a guard oh can we could we grab ahold of this tonight the guard guard the ball i'll try to take it away from the next man glory to god if he can do it over here on this corner god bless him yes amen you say bye brother ben there will be a church on every corner my hell wouldn't that be wonderful wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a church or this message on every corner and there would be enough people for form to go to go to them amen i don't i don't have any interest in swapping people out but if there's enough people to keep a church going on every corner so be it amen he said i'm a oneness i can do it i'm a trinitarian i can do it or you say he ain't got no business doing that you're knocking the ball out of your own player's hands let's guard the ball this is the ball the holy spirit is trying to pack it it'll condemn communism it'll condemn sin it'll condem unrighteousness it will manifest and glorify jesus christ and bring his person into the midst of the people don't you know that's what we need tonight we need his person his presence in the midst of the people we need him to have the preeminence how are we going to get there he said it it'll it's the ball this is the ball and the holy spirit is packing the ball let's get behind it amen excuse me tonight i'm preaching about eating i get stirred up i haven't even got to my sermon yet for samuel 14 13 jonathan climbed up on his hands and upon his feet and his armor bearer after him they fell before jonathan as armor bearers slew after him i like it he wasn't the first one to go but he went he got some devils too and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armor bear made was about 20 men within as it were a half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow and there was a trembling in the host watch he only killed 20. but look at the effect that it had on the other devils or philistines right there was a trembling in the host in the field among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earthquake so it was a very great trembling now right now would have been a good time for saul to join in but instead he was trying to figure out who went to the meeting without being authorized by the pastor are you with me tonight my god what are they doing up there at the meeting the whole place is shaking they're making noise man that ain't right sitting here under my tree taking a nap and they're making noise and the earth's trembling and so the watchmen of saul and gabia benjamin looked they got on the internet and they looked at some of the services they said man the multitude's melting away the enemies are beating down on one another you always tell devils because they beat on one another god's people don't do that somebody's beating on somebody i don't care if it's a husband or wife i don't care if it's a pastor in the church i don't care whatever it is somebody's beating on somebody it's inspired by the devil that's right we don't beat down on people huh they now look they were they were beating down on one another and saul said unto the people that were with him number now and see who was gone from us who went up there come on until they begin to look down through the things and say who is it when the camera scanned the crowd this hasn't happened i'm just dramatizing it for you maybe it has i don't know look through the crowd and see who was there who went down to the meeting when they numbered behold jonathan and his armor bearer were not there oh my and miss church go to the meeting and saul said today hi i'll tell you what you could miss church for worse things i want you to beat your post of duty but you can miss church for worse things than to go kill some devils i mean if you're doubt killing some devils god bless you you keep killing them we need less of them and saul said unto bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel and it came to pass now listen he had the word yes but no dynamics to make it work yeah that's right but jonathan had the dynamics he might as well go do it and the ark of god was with him and it came to pass while saul talked to the priest the old backslidden priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased oh i love it and so why is there noise because jonathan caused some destruction he gotten through to god and saul said to the priest withdraw thy hand he said he finally realized i better go help this boy it's all loves again to gain credit or to get the credit and so saul and all the people that with him assembled themselves they came to the battle behold every man's sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time now watch this was such a great meeting think about this meeting that they had it was such a great man i want to have one of those kind of meetings in july that even the hebrews even the people that were in the world could look at it and say hey we better go to church we're killing some devils up there yeah the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went with up went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites all the old backs in hebrews that were running around with the philistines turned around why because jonathan took his sword out amen hallelujah when he began to preach they began to realize something was different about this even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves and played tapes at home in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled i feel good tonight they hid themselves when they heard that the philistines fled even they followed hard after them in the battle so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto beth haven what was it something peculiar had happened yes sir amen something different had happened god was moving all right but now we come to a very peculiar part of the story this is where my title comes from let my people eat because as the people were fighting that day they began to grow weary in the battle the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had endured the people saying cursed be the man that's while he's sitting under his tree cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food he says that i may be avenged on my enemies that tells you all you need to know about saul how many pastors i would say today and people and i won't just limit to pastors but but in different places that would starve god's people for the sake of their own complexes yes that i may be events on my enemies oh you can't eat nothing now notice you remember when they come over into the land there was something that was promised to them anybody remember what it was said it'd be a land flowing with milk and honey yes right that's a promise the promises of god were that the land would be flowing with milk and honey so that if you went out one day without eating and you got weary that there might be honey on the ground because the land was flown with it it was a promise of god and you might be able to eat some and get your strength back but the people couldn't eat because saul said nobody's going to eat until my bitterness my the cup of my bitterness is full until until i'm avenged on my enemies you said nothing about god's enemies yeah he said my enemies oh my there was honey on the ground they all they the land come to a wood and there was honey upon the ground and when they should have remembered oh it's a land flowing with milk and honey and when the people were coming to the wood behold the honey dropped it was dripping off everywhere but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath he's got him so controlled by fear god help us today yes that the people were afraid to enter in yes to the promises of god they were afraid of it because they were they had been walking on ground and it was sticky everywhere they went there was honey imagine what it must have been like their shoes were sticking to the ground but they couldn't eat it and they were starving to death they were starving to death but they couldn't they wouldn't do it because pastor saul said don't you shout yeah don't you go get hands late on you don't go in that prayer line that's pentecostal i'm being just as clear about it as i can be tonight pastor saul said you better not go they don't agree with us the people feared the oath but no god always provides food in due season do you believe that yes elijah was down there one time and it was a famine going to go on and god told him he said go up to the brook cherith he said i'm going to let crows bring you sandwiches bread and meat bring you a ham sandwich or a chicken sandwich or whatever that it was i prefer to think it was chicken myself it would be kind of funny though birds bringing a chicken sandwich but hopefully it wasn't crow but whatever it was it was good it kept him alive and so elijah's up there eating of it and so brother branham was talking about this one time and he said and he said i said he's talking to a person who who had told him he was crazy i said you told me i was crazy because i was shouting oh my i said you said i was excited and it was mental telepathy i said the only thing i know because he asked him he said how did god bring sandwiches to those people how did he bring sandwich to elijah the only thing i know the holy ghost brings it we eat it and get fat and round oh praise god i got message for it he said that's all that makes any difference to me now i may be fattening around in the natural but let me tell you what you you want to be fat and round when it comes to the spiritual i always say i don't know where it comes from i don't know what denomination it's a part of but i know this if it's a promise of god it belongs to me and i can pick it up in need of it if it's laying there on the ground let me pick it up and eat it let me eat it he said the only thing i know i don't know where it comes from i don't know how the crows carried the sandwiches i don't know if they use miracle whipper mayonnaise or peanut butter or what they used on the sandwich i don't know but i know this amen when i eat it i get fat and round hallelujah oh i'd like to have some fat and round christians in the house tonight i've been eating the good things of god heaven we're not going to go on a spiritual diet where i refuse to preach certain things because somebody else preaches them i don't care who preaches them yes or who don't let's preach the word we're going to preach you the whole counsel of god we'll preach the judgments of god and the blessings of god we'll preach against sin and we'll preach predestination we'll preach grace why because we preach the whole counsel of god preach me something let me hear something let me eat something that'll make me fat and round he said you can say we're crazy if you want to when we want a drink we go to the rock that was smitten on calvary there's honey found in that same rock amen and every man tonight that's born of the spirit of god has the right to go there and ask for it oh my that ought to be that's a promise church we have a right he said and the holy ghost brings down his spiritual dinner his spiritual supper his breakfast oh my and then say we're crazy all right listen to me the other day i ate something was so good oh i loved it it was a hamburger i'm gonna make you hungry it's about a half pound of hamburger meat on top of that it was seasoned perfectly everybody overcooked hamburger meat by the way this was cooked perfectly on top of that they piled about a half pound of barbecue beef and it had a seasoning in it that just made you want more of it on top of that they they had cheese on the hamburger it wasn't just american cheese it was good cheese i didn't investigate see what kind it was it's gone now but they had on top of that they had the the best bun and then it had sweet potato fries with it and i ate that whole thing i sit down i wasn't even really that hungry when i sat down but i sat down and ate that whole thing and all day long i was tasting that i was i could i could taste it i said man that's got to be the best thing you know what i did i advertised it i put it on the internet and i talked to people about it i'm still talking about it tonight i ate it days ago why it made me fat and round i had the fit and the holy ghost amen aren't you glad for the holy ghost tonight because it brings down your spiritual dinner and your spiritual suffering that's lunch and dinner by the way to us your spiritual dinner and spiritual supper your breakfast and then say we're crazy man we're just eating yes some people can't shout and i know there's people who shout without having nothing to eat i realize that but the reason we're shouting is because we've been eating yes sir yeah oh my brother said that's the way they say that the holy ghost was for another age he said that's what they think yes it's here he said we've been fine in the air for the last 40 50 years with it seeing things the intellectual people knows nothing about only thing they can do is sit down and just make fun of it he said like a little calf one time come out of a stall they said it was just fatten around i love that he was kicking up his heels and he had a very nice farmer that fed him good and he was all around and full of vitamins and another old lazy farmer over there that had a little cap of the brown calls him a pastor in a couple places a lazy pastor had a little calf also born in the barn that winter when the little fellow hadn't eaten nothing but weeds and when he come out he was so poor he couldn't hardly move and every time the wind would blow and shove him sideways what happened the winds are going to blow church you need to be fat and rounded up spiritually you don't blow over yes this little cat's wandering he's staggering out and he's he's so skinny that when the wind blew he just staggered like that he couldn't take it that's why people get worried they get scared oh russia's coming communism all these other things look at the democrats look at the republicans they get scared what's going to happen look at the riots going on around us people get scared you need to eat some more yes because there it says amen i got a seven course meal that says i am the god that heals all thy diseases i've never seen a seed forsaken or a seed begging bread amen he's still god he's still the same yesterday today and forever and when a man he said it's a little fat calf just kicking up his heels he's seeing this little fat calf kicking up his heels having a great time he said you know he looked at the crack in the fence got to looking on the internet and said such fanaticism he can't really stand up he's criticizing somebody else yes oh god help us today yes sir i don't say we have the most fanatic we don't have any fanaticism as far as i know i don't say we have the most spiritual church but if i can get a little fatter and a little rounder let me do it leave me alone quit peeking through the fence and saying it's fanaticism yeah i just got vitamins he said no wonder he could pick up his heels i wonder sometimes why people can't kick up their heels you know i just i wonder but is it there's no law against being happy in church there is no log is kicking up your heels in church there's nothing that says you have to sit there and look depressed in church it is not a virtue depression is not one of the nine spiritual gifts it's not a virtue and i don't mean to make light of it if you're going through something that i understand that but we have a burden bearer we have a load lifter we got something that can take your pressure take you take it off of you let off the pressure we've got something that can do that tonight we got vitamins so if you just eat amen if you'll just use what we say about horses they were off their feet when they wouldn't eat and they'd get skinny why something was wrong with them but if you could ever get an inoculation of the holy ghost if you could ever get god down on the inside of you you begin to eat again amen he said when a man is filled with the holy ghost there's something in him that's full of god's spiritual vitamin makes him praise god shout and act different because why he's no longer earthbound he's in the heavens sailing around in heavenly places in christ jesus brother branham goes on in that sermon that's countdown in 1964 he goes on to say that we have even more power now yes remember he said because they were shouting 50 years ago 100 years ago now at pentecost but he said we've even got more power now because the bible said matthew 24 28 wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together and then brother branham gets to talking about it in the sea does not air with the shut he said the higher you go the more you can see he said so it's time for eagles of this day to get to flying higher dig into god's promises not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago get out of it politics voting in and voting out saying this side or the other and the holy spirit has no more right of way in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever relies on half-rotten man-made theology where does he get it out of some man-made sunday school program sheet some educator people in the message want to go back to that i say god forbid yeah we don't need a man-made sunday school program see we need the holy ghost some educator killed for him back in some seminary tell him that the days of miracles has passed there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost all this is nonsense he said you mean to tell me an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it no sir neither will a christian eat on that dead karen from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of god fresh the promise of the hour god promised rabbits in the days of luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us yes can we say that tonight he promised us he promised us a full square meal you ever went into a place and the food looks so good on the menu and it's a promise yeah right i take that as a promise if you're gonna put that big beautiful hamburger up there on the menu or on the side you know the ones that burger king and and and hearties they look so good and the grease is just dripping off of them you know and it looks so good when you get it it don't look like that does it it don't look like what it does on the picture it's a false promise it's false advertising but when god promised you a full square meal you're going to get all of it amen he said he promised us a full square meal the full seven course menu for all someone say all all the seven seals are open yes argue with brother branham if you want to argue about that yeah and everything is ready amen for everything is ready for the word of god to those who can receive oh do we believe it tonight amen maybe i shouldn't have drank that gatorade before church oh don't you love to eat yes i'm not talking about the natural now i'm talking about the spiritual don't you love to eat he said it's all there a full seven course meal we can pick up any we could have chosen any we didn't have to choose daniel chapter two for the men's bible study we could choose any scripture in the bible and you find something in the message of the hour about it why because this is the opening of the book the book is open the word is open amen and we see christ in every word of it hallelujah amen now but jonathan heard not i hope there's some people that haven't heard the denominational decree not to eat jonathan heard not when his father charged the people the oath amen wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened yes amen amen he could see hallelujah and then after one of the people and said thy father strictly charged the people they looked at him said hey you can't have that pastor saul said no yeah he said cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people we're faint if the people are fainting our hour it's not the fault of this bible it's not the fault of the message it's our fault yes it's preachers we're not feeding the people i said no you can't feed them you're out of order he said but he said my father has troubled the land yes he says see i pray you have my eyes enlightened yes hallelujah because i tasted a little of this honey oh what a seven course me a lot to do to the people of god today that we could say look how my eyes have been enlightened look how my life has changed look how i've moved from one dimension and moving into another look at how i've changed look at my joy look at the piece that i have look at look how i've reacted to it hey man just like daniel and his friends they said let us see like we like to like the law says and then you come back and look and see if we're not fatter than everybody else that's right yes sir amen he said listen how much more it happened that people had eaten freely that's what we ought to we ought to put a sign on the door it says eat freely eat freely not on the fellowship paul in this building eat freely because the people had eaten freely of the spoil of their enemies which they found had there not been that been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines and they smote the philistines that day from mcmaster angelon and the people were very faint if you read on you find the people ate raw meat because they were so hungry they couldn't eat the honey that was provided for them because of pastor saul's decree so they went out to the animals that got killed in the battle and ate it with the blood which was against god's word to do but the brandon said a hungry child will eat from a garbage can the only reason he does is because he's not invited to a clean table yes how many young people have left messaged churches hear me tonight how many young people have left message churches because they were not invited to a clean table and so they go out to the world and they go out to romantic relationships that are against the word of god they go out to worldly pleasures yes because they were not invited to a clean table but i'm here to tell you church and into these young people that are here let's and to us as adults i challenge you let's set a clean table for them amen people that live the word and believe the full seven course meal and preach it yes they're not afraid to keep preaching it no matter what the culture does he said but listen you true believers in christ you true christians that believe in god in the supernatural all the times saul was training this big army all these intellectuals coming up god had a little david out there somewhere feeding his father's sheep on sheep food the word not on theological weeds i'm closing with this saul goes to ask the lord again he gets so frustrated because god won't speak to him yeah and so he begins to think it's because the people didn't obey him isn't it strange how preachers should get off the word always blame the people yes they always blame the people other people the people made me do it the people the people didn't care about me and so i had to go off into the world the people didn't do right it's not the people's fault people weren't being fed and saul he he said somebody went to a meeting they weren't authorized to so he runs it down through law by lot and they chose him and jonathan and then it come down to jonathan and saul said to jonathan tell me what thou has done and jonathan told him he said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand go ahead and kill me and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan he didn't know he was speaking prophecy the people saved jonathan then but jonathan would die on the same day his father did and saul probably thought that the whole reason he'd built his denomination and built up his church was to pass it on to jonathan and jonathan would end up dying with him because he stayed with him was under that same administration you'll surely die jonathan it was a prophecy and he didn't know it see the ravening wolf eats his own family he's mad yeah all he can think about is his bitterness yeah i want to bring it home tonight because i know the lasting services i preach about a lot of preachers and things like that think about yourself and your own life are you consumed with the passions of bitterness anger of lust of of something that controls your life or your ravening wolf you does that old nature cause you to eat your own family where you would you would cut off your own friends i've known pastors who would who would cut off friendships that they've known for years people who would do anything for them people who loved them and they cut them off because they didn't want they want they were protecting their own bitterness jonathan will eventually die an early death with his father in fact the entire the entire family of saul except for one mesh mephibosheth you can hardly say his name he was saved it was grace maybe we'll have time to get to that story i don't know it was grace david saved one out of that whole family but most of the family died because saul's bitterness and failure to break the cycle out of this civil war mentality out of this denominational mentality caused the death of his own son a man anointed with a benjaminite ravening wolf spirit will destroy his closest friends will destroy his family will destroy his marriage for the sake of his complexes yes and blame it on the word blame it on god i'll tell you tonight deal with your complexes deal with the problem deal with what's making you rage don't blame it on your family break that curse yes are you with me now i'm serious now you deal with it don't let it go on and on because eventually it'll destroy everybody around you if you let it bow your heads with me musicians come imagine a father speaking to his own son said jonathan you've got to die because i've got to be eventually my enemies my bitterness must prevail i i'm weak and i know i'm weak so i've got to act strong oh god it'd be better to acknowledge your weakness it'd be better to stand there and say i know i'm the man i know i'm the man like david did the lord i know i'm the one who did it be better when the word is preached to acknowledge it and say oh lord wash me with hyssop that i may be clean you see the difference in david david wasn't a better man than saul but david could repent david could repent david could lead could completely throw himself on the mercies of god and saul maintained that he was not the reason everything went wrong and so he blamed his wife and his children and david and everybody else maybe the lord is dealing with your heart tonight you just want to talk to him for a minute i you know i firmly believe that we don't give christians enough time sometimes to repent we want sinners to repent but we need to repent sometimes don't have that ravening wolf nature if that's coming out in you and you find yourself striking out in bitterness let go of that let god speak to you don't don't let that rule your life don't let those family complexes those stories that that ungodliness run your life don't let that bitterness run your church run your your office that you hold in the church deal with it let go of it break the family curse you can do it you and god are a majority take care of it don't don't justify it well we're just that way let it go i'm not supposed to be that way let me be different let my people eat gotta get a hold of the word of god and start eating from it instead of feeding on your prejudice and your the cancer of your bitterness let the word heal you let the honey they say honey has healing properties you can actually heal a number of diseases if you'd eat local honey we got some local honey if you just eat the honey in the wrong you can have healing tonight heavenly father lord jesus in this little crowd here tonight those that are watching different ones lord i i'm not just preaching at them i'm preaching it myself tonight lord we we don't want to be bitter god if there's something in my life that would keep me from where i ought to be in you let me let go of it lord no matter who caused it or i don't want to blame somebody else but lord i realize that i'm the man i have to be the one to lead my family i've got to be the one lord that's called to the pulpit to preach the word let me preach it lord let me feed the people a full seven course meal about leave some out because i'm not living it i pray you'd help me lord help me in every area of my life help these men lord are these leaders of families help these women these mothers lord are these these young women these the widows the widowers lord maybe just their own family and say well i i can just do whatever i want to because it doesn't matter and no i don't have a family anyway oh god help them to realize that everything that they do impacts the whole church it impacts the whole family of god whether they go to church or not they're still known as message people they're still known by the name of the people of god i pray you'd help them today lord break down every bitter spirit break down lord saul was never a worshiper he was never one he was just always a complainer he had the word but he never worshiped he never reached out to god with it oh god would you help us today to be worshippers help us to be like david or we may make mistakes but our hands are raised our lips are raised lord we we want to worship you in spirit and in truth when that presence that sweet spirit comes among us may we recognize that it's you lord and let that anointing oil come down and just cover every part of our life oh god may we worship you in spirit and in truth do those things that are right the lord not by intellectual knowledge but by the spirit of god that wants to live and reign in our hearts oh there's a king coming the king is coming lord let us wait and be patient and tarry until he comes and let you have complete control in our lives we pray in jesus name amen do you love him hey man i feel i feel convicted but i feel clean that's all it takes is a moment brother brandon put it this way he said i feel all scoured out if you
