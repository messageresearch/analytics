[34:46] i say unto thee whenever you see that in
[34:49] the scripture he's saying this is the
[34:50] truth
[34:52] this is the truth except a man be born
[34:55] again
[34:57] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[35:00] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[35:02] to the word you may be seated this
[35:03] evening
[35:08] i enjoyed that song service very much my
[35:12] entire sermon could be summed up in that
[35:14] song
[35:16] tis so sweet to trust in jesus
[35:19] have you ever looked at the words to
[35:20] that you sung them just a minute ago
[35:23] just so sweet to trust in jesus just to
[35:26] take him at his word
[35:28] that's a big thing
[35:32] just to rest on his promise just to know
[35:35] thus saith the lord oh we know it in
[35:37] this hour don't we
[35:40] and then it says i'm so glad i learned
[35:42] to trust him
[35:43] i learned to trust him precious jesus
[35:47] savior friend and i know that he's with
[35:49] me
[35:50] not just with me today but he'll be with
[35:51] me to the end
[35:54] i love it it says just so sweet to trust
[35:56] in jesus just to trust his cleansing
[35:58] blood
[35:59] and in simple faith to plunge me beneath
[36:02] the healing cleansing
[36:04] flood i i could listen to that all day
[36:11] i want to speak to you tonight on the
[36:12] birth of the word
[36:16] this is important so i want us to i know
[36:18] you say well brother ben i've been born
[36:20] again
[36:21] but none of us have made it yet
[36:25] all of us are still traveling because
[36:27] when you made it brother harvey you
[36:29] won't have them
[36:29] gray hairs right when we made it we'll
[36:33] look a little bit different than we do
[36:35] now and
[36:36] and act a little bit differently than we
[36:37] do now so we're on our way and
[36:40] jesus said unless you're born again you
[36:42] you can't even understand the kingdom of
[36:44] god
[36:47] and so the new birth or the birth
[36:50] what we call the birth of the word
[36:53] that's what i want to title this tonight
[36:54] the birth of the word
[36:56] it's that part of the process of
[36:58] redemption that manifests
[37:00] the potential of the seed that was in
[37:04] our father and he is the original owner
[37:07] he
[37:07] god is our father he is the one that the
[37:11] seed the thought
[37:12] the what we are if we're anything in god
[37:15] it come from him
[37:16] if we are going back to god we had to
[37:18] come from god
[37:21] and so that seed is is what was in him
[37:25] but being born again is when that seed
[37:28] begins to manifest
[37:29] its potentials and i won't say that it
[37:33] manifests all of its potentials because
[37:36] we won't see that until the culmination
[37:39] of it until we leave here
[37:41] until our work is over but it you begin
[37:43] to see a baby
[37:45] so it makes sense that you you've gone
[37:47] through the pregnancy and
[37:48] and and caleb and sophie could explain
[37:52] that to you better than i could right
[37:53] now because they've just been through
[37:54] that but you've gone through that and
[37:56] and you've been through the water and
[37:58] the blood and the spirit
[37:59] you get to the other end of that there's
[38:01] a baby there
[38:03] there's a reality to what you've been
[38:06] supposing there's a there's a realness
[38:08] to it that
[38:09] wasn't there before and that that's the
[38:11] new birth that
[38:13] it manifesting the potential of that
[38:15] seed
[38:16] that baby's alive it's outside the womb
[38:19] it's it's breathing on its own
[38:22] and and it's got it a life in it and
[38:24] that life we know is the holy spirit
[38:26] that
[38:27] that the spirit part of that of the
[38:29] water blood and the spirit
[38:30] is the holy spirit that's that's in you
[38:33] and
[38:34] then you grow from there you grow from
[38:37] there and
[38:38] we grow up into christ and so
[38:41] the seed that's in you anointed by the
[38:43] life of christ begins to manifest the
[38:45] word
[38:46] in your life and it manifests in in many
[38:48] different ways that
[38:50] people don't realize that just you
[38:52] coming to church
[38:53] tonight or you watching and listening to
[38:55] the word is a manifestation of the word
[38:58] in your life
[38:59] it's something that that you're doing
[39:01] something that a lot of people don't
[39:02] want to do but you do it because there's
[39:04] a hunger there for the word there's a
[39:06] desire there
[39:07] to hear the word and so it's a
[39:08] manifestation and
[39:10] yet that wouldn't be the only
[39:11] manifestation but there would be a
[39:13] change something
[39:14] take place in your life there's a baby
[39:17] you're born again and i think all of us
[39:21] that have been around for a long time
[39:23] and i say us
[39:24] i use that a little bit loosely because
[39:26] i've not been around as
[39:27] long as some of you but if you've been
[39:30] around for a long time you've seen a lot
[39:32] of people come and go
[39:35] and you've seen churches fill up and
[39:36] empty and you've seen preachers come and
[39:38] go and you've seen
[39:39] great revivals and lack of revival and
[39:42] you've seen a lot of things
[39:44] and some of you have been around a long
[39:45] time and we've got some elders here
[39:47] tonight and
[39:48] i see a different one sitting here and
[39:50] brother harvey and brother
[39:51] jt and brother danny and all of you that
[39:55] point them out just because they're old
[39:56] but really but harvey's not that old but
[39:58] but you've been around a long time
[40:01] and then some of you that aren't that
[40:02] old have been around a long time you
[40:04] know
[40:05] that not everybody that comes through
[40:07] and gets excited about the message
[40:09] sticks
[40:12] right you know that and not everybody
[40:16] that seems to be the best
[40:17] christian and i was talking with my
[40:19] brother about it the other day and i
[40:20] said you know it seems like that
[40:22] something to this effect that it seems
[40:24] like that the ones sometimes that that
[40:26] shout the most and are the most
[40:28] anointed and are the most uh excited
[40:32] are the ones that don't last and that's
[40:34] not always true
[40:36] because i've got my pentecostal
[40:38] credentials i like to shout
[40:41] i like to to speak in tongues i like to
[40:43] see the gifts of the spirit moving but
[40:45] but those are things that that don't
[40:47] necessarily tell you anything about how
[40:49] whether a person is going to stick
[40:53] because one person might do it and be
[40:55] saved another person might do it and be
[40:57] and never be saved never even live right
[41:03] and so there's something that does make
[41:05] a difference and that's the new birth
[41:07] and
[41:07] if you stuck around that that tells
[41:09] something it's a genuine new birth there
[41:12] and more than that that you've grown
[41:14] you're different than what you were
[41:16] right and and so you're different than
[41:17] what you were last week or
[41:20] or a year ago or 10 years ago and you go
[41:23] through something now and you look back
[41:24] at brother jt
[41:25] what the way you would have viewed that
[41:28] 10 years ago 20 years ago
[41:29] 50 years ago it had been different than
[41:31] what it is today
[41:33] because you've grown up in christ and
[41:36] you see it differently you see through
[41:38] different
[41:38] eyes than what you used to see
[41:41] it's a birth that's taken place in your
[41:43] life
[41:45] and what i want to see among us and i
[41:48] think what is lacking the most in our
[41:50] churches and
[41:51] all around us is a genuine new birth
[41:54] just a genuine birth of the word that
[41:57] people can say
[41:58] that there's a seed there and we can see
[42:01] the evidence of it in our lives
[42:03] not a a not a legalism not
[42:07] going back to a look looking at how long
[42:10] your dress is or how long your sleeves
[42:12] are
[42:13] but a genuine experience with god that
[42:16] you know that person changed
[42:19] when they come to god how long has it
[42:20] been since we said that about somebody
[42:22] who come to the house of god and see
[42:23] that person
[42:24] changed and i know that god still does
[42:28] that
[42:28] he still does that but it's not an
[42:30] overnight thing
[42:31] and that's what so many people are
[42:33] looking for but
[42:35] you might look at it tonight and
[42:36] sometimes the devil likes to play with
[42:38] their minds and
[42:39] say how do you know that you're born
[42:40] again
[42:42] how do i know that i've really gotten
[42:44] that birth of the word that i've
[42:46] really been changed because especially
[42:48] when people
[42:49] fall away or when different ones don't
[42:52] make it or maybe you see them doing
[42:53] things that are against the word
[42:54] and you think how could i could i do
[42:57] that is that
[42:58] what i am am i ain't no better than they
[43:00] are in that sense and
[43:01] we're not in the flesh but am i
[43:05] would i be able to do that and yet
[43:07] there's something in your heart that's
[43:08] real
[43:09] how do i know that i'm born again and in
[43:12] the roman catholic church
[43:14] they said well if you do these good
[43:15] works and you you you say these prayers
[43:18] and you take this wafer
[43:20] then you're that means that you're going
[43:22] to make it but it'll be just by the skin
[43:24] of your teeth
[43:26] you might have to go to purgatory for a
[43:27] while but you'll eventually get there if
[43:29] you do
[43:30] all of these things and we know that's
[43:31] not right
[43:33] but among the calvinists they said that
[43:35] well you're saved because you're the
[43:36] elected and you know it you confess it
[43:39] that makes you saved luther taught
[43:42] justification by faith if you believe on
[43:44] christ you're saved and then
[43:46] which was true which is true but then in
[43:49] the baptist church that that became
[43:50] shaking hands with the preacher
[43:53] and today it might be in in the message
[43:55] it might be that we
[43:57] uh we listen to our favorite preacher
[43:59] and that preacher because we see how
[44:01] anointed they are and
[44:02] and how wonderful they are that makes us
[44:04] saved it doesn't mean anything to
[44:06] salvation
[44:09] or our pastor is a certain level or
[44:11] something that respected among the
[44:13] people and that that makes us saved
[44:15] that doesn't mean that you're saved but
[44:18] the man is fine he's fine but it doesn't
[44:20] mean that you're saved
[44:21] you have to be saved no matter whether
[44:23] the man is standing on the pulpit is
[44:25] saved or not
[44:27] because the truth is if you're around
[44:28] for 30 40 50 years and if the lord
[44:30] tarries i don't know how many years we
[44:32] have left we may not have a year left we
[44:33] may not have a day
[44:35] but but if there's 30 years left you'll
[44:37] see you'll hear
[44:38] more preachers that aren't saved
[44:41] at some point there'll be somebody
[44:43] standing behind the pope and you all
[44:44] know it and they'll preach
[44:45] sometimes the real word but not have it
[44:47] themselves
[44:49] not be born again and so you can't base
[44:51] it on that if it's the word you you say
[44:53] amen to it
[44:55] but it doesn't affect our or what who i
[44:58] am and and so the holiness people where
[45:01] my family come from they
[45:03] took john wesley where he said his heart
[45:05] was strangely warmed in the in the
[45:07] meeting at alder's gate in england and
[45:09] and he said it felt like his heart was
[45:11] strangely warmed and so the holiness
[45:13] people said well that's a witness of the
[45:14] spirit
[45:16] and so they they said well if you shout
[45:19] that means you felt that
[45:22] right and so they'd say as brother
[45:23] brandon would put it if you shout you've
[45:24] got it
[45:26] and the pentecostal spoke with tongues
[45:28] and said well that must be the evidence
[45:29] of the holy ghost
[45:31] because in the new testament many times
[45:32] they spoke with in other tongues when
[45:34] they
[45:34] received the holy ghost so they said
[45:36] that's the evidence of it and
[45:38] to some of us it becomes if we believe a
[45:40] certain doctrine
[45:42] if we go to a certain church or if we
[45:44] you know can say
[45:45] certain words a certain way we're born
[45:48] again
[45:50] and it doesn't mean anything it really
[45:53] doesn't other than that you can read
[45:57] a parrot we could teach a parrot to say
[46:00] to say what the prophet said actually
[46:03] but he would still be a parrot
[46:06] right and that's where yes it's
[46:07] necessary to say what he said but you've
[46:09] got to be born again
[46:13] and so we today we see in the
[46:16] pentecostal church that become
[46:18] great things happening great emotions
[46:20] but we find in the scripture that there
[46:22] was a wind and an earthquake and a fire
[46:24] and they all come to elijah but he did
[46:26] not move
[46:28] until he heard a still small voice
[46:31] and sometimes as ministers and i'm just
[46:33] preaching to you from my heart today but
[46:35] sometimes we move people
[46:37] by our emotions and we move people by
[46:39] and i believe in those things and i
[46:41] i tend to get emotional myself but but
[46:44] that's we move people by that and we
[46:46] learn how to move people like that
[46:48] and the truth is you could work people
[46:50] up into a certain thing to where every
[46:52] service we had
[46:54] people that were worked up into an
[46:56] emotion but
[46:57] still the seed would be saved and the
[46:59] elect would be saved and the non-elect
[47:01] would not
[47:03] right it wouldn't change that
[47:06] but but sometimes what happens is even
[47:09] we'll give people
[47:11] and brother branham calls it a false
[47:13] birth that when we begin to pointing to
[47:15] those things instead of to the word
[47:18] we actually hinder the work of god we're
[47:20] not helping it
[47:21] and so elijah heard a wind and an
[47:23] earthquake and a fire
[47:25] but he did not move until he heard a
[47:26] still small voice and
[47:28] and those things were he said god was
[47:31] not in those things but those things
[47:32] were the effects of the presence of god
[47:35] where did they come from god allowed
[47:36] them to happen or caused them to happen
[47:38] but
[47:39] that wasn't god right and you've been
[47:43] around long enough that you know that
[47:44] there's times when
[47:46] you feel the effects of god's presence
[47:48] but
[47:49] that's not god what the god is in his
[47:52] word
[47:54] right and it's when that presence comes
[47:56] and settles down among us that we know
[47:57] that
[47:58] yes god is near us but when he's near us
[48:00] that's the time when we really need to
[48:02] buckle down and say lord
[48:03] what do you have for me today how can
[48:07] how can this word affect my life today
[48:10] and that's what we really need to grow
[48:12] in christ now brother branham kind of
[48:15] gets almost frustrated with the
[48:16] pentecostal people because they put all
[48:18] of it over on that
[48:20] and in a sermon called what does thou
[48:22] hear he says brother sister i've been
[48:24] back in a cave long enough
[48:26] and you have two to know there's been a
[48:27] lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot
[48:29] of noise and fusses and stews
[48:31] things like that in big meetings where
[48:34] has been god out of it he said that's
[48:35] the reason i said what i did this
[48:36] morning there's got to be something
[48:38] deeper than a healing service
[48:40] there's got to be something deeper than
[48:41] a gift to speak with tongues there's got
[48:43] to be something deeper
[48:44] than a rushing mighty wind the wind went
[48:46] forth but god wasn't in it
[48:48] we've had rushing mighty winds all over
[48:50] the country and sensations and blood in
[48:51] the face and the hands to all kinds of
[48:53] signs but where's god at
[48:55] and i think so many times we look at a
[48:56] special service we think well
[48:58] during that special service that's when
[49:00] god can really speak to me
[49:01] listen we we underestimate the ability
[49:03] of the word
[49:04] to speak to our hearts on a wednesday
[49:06] night
[49:07] when we're socially distanced not
[49:09] because we have to or want to be but
[49:11] because that's just the case
[49:14] but sometimes on that wednesday night
[49:16] service god steps in
[49:18] and begins to speak to our hearts
[49:20] something that will change us something
[49:22] real
[49:23] not just a a a rushing mighty wind he
[49:26] said we've had
[49:27] rushing mighty winds all over the
[49:29] country and all these sensations well
[49:31] where is god at
[49:33] and he says all the great fuss and
[49:34] america is guilty of listening to those
[49:36] noises
[49:37] oh we love noise but god is not in the
[49:40] noise
[49:41] and i know our minds will go to where
[49:43] brother branham said that where jesus is
[49:44] there's a lot of noise
[49:46] and those two things are both true but
[49:49] jesus wasn't making the noise
[49:53] he was the word we make the noise and we
[49:56] should
[49:58] all right but we're human beings we make
[50:01] the noise
[50:02] we say lord i'm so grateful to you for
[50:05] being here and we recognize his presence
[50:07] we should do that
[50:09] we should make the noise but it wasn't
[50:11] him making the noise he was moving
[50:14] fulfilling his father's will that's what
[50:17] he's doing today and so
[50:19] he says we love noise but god is not in
[50:21] the noise although as honorable in
[50:22] things as they are
[50:24] yet god isn't in noise he said if that
[50:26] would have been so when the africans
[50:27] beat the tom thomas you never heard such
[50:29] a noise and rhythm
[50:30] god wasn't in it and you know now
[50:34] you don't hear that just you say in the
[50:36] jungles but
[50:37] where we were at i was in this city in
[50:39] lomi togo
[50:40] in a hotel on a probably about three
[50:42] stories high and
[50:43] long building and i went in there one
[50:46] night and
[50:47] went to bed because you generally went
[50:48] to bed early because you're so tired
[50:50] i went to sleep and about an hour later
[50:52] i was awakened to the noise of the
[50:54] tomtoms
[50:56] and it sounded like a war party well
[50:58] i've never been in africa before
[51:01] i didn't know i thought well you know it
[51:03] could be they're coming to get me i mean
[51:04] i don't know
[51:06] it could be that it could be there's a
[51:08] war breaking out
[51:10] had no idea and what it was is there's
[51:12] tourists there at that hotel
[51:14] and the locals would come and dress up
[51:16] in their native dress
[51:17] and play their music and do their little
[51:19] dance and all for the tourists
[51:22] and then they go back and dress in their
[51:23] street clothes you know when they got
[51:25] done but they they were given their
[51:27] little dance and stuff for them and and
[51:30] and brother brandon said if that
[51:31] if god was in noise and i i concur with
[51:33] that boy you talk about noisy
[51:35] and there's nothing you could do about
[51:36] it and it just went on and on and on
[51:39] through the night but
[51:40] but if that was god then they would have
[51:43] god
[51:44] but they needed god same as we did
[51:47] he said you've never heard such a noise
[51:48] in rhythm god wasn't in it he said we've
[51:50] had rushing mighty winds we've had all
[51:51] kinds of fires and earthquakes and
[51:53] shakings
[51:53] and great revivals and things like that
[51:55] god wasn't in it if it had
[51:57] been it would have showed itself up but
[51:58] after that come a still small voice
[52:02] then god was in the voice oh i love that
[52:05] god was in
[52:07] the voice romans 10 17 tells us that
[52:11] faith cometh by hearing
[52:12] and hearing by the word of god so
[52:16] we hear the word of god and we get faith
[52:19] to be saved and that's what we call that
[52:23] light
[52:23] striking the seed and then the seed
[52:26] begins its transformation
[52:29] there may be a whole lot of effects and
[52:30] brother brown talks about how a birth is
[52:32] always a mess no matter where it's at
[52:34] and as i've said before you don't come
[52:36] to an altar to get anything
[52:38] you can get right where you're at you
[52:41] come to an altar to give up things
[52:43] right to surrender to die and so brother
[52:46] brown said talk about that pig nature he
[52:48] said you need to
[52:49] die until that pig is consumed at the
[52:51] altar
[52:52] and then that lamb nature can come in
[52:55] but now
[52:57] we are not saved because we come to an
[52:59] altar
[53:00] or how long we cried or anything like
[53:02] that but by faith
[53:03] after hearing the word but all those
[53:06] things come with it but now
[53:07] those things can be impersonated two
[53:10] people could come
[53:10] both cry two people could come both
[53:13] shout won't be right and one be wrong
[53:16] what cannot be impersonated listen this
[53:19] ought to give us comfort because you
[53:20] think and you look and say well
[53:21] maybe i could fall maybe i could be just
[53:23] like maybe i could be one who could
[53:25] go out and never want to come back
[53:27] obviously any of us could backslide
[53:29] because we do it all the time right but
[53:32] i mean
[53:32] fall away to the point where we reject
[53:34] the message of the hour and those things
[53:36] that we've helped
[53:37] most dear and we think maybe i could do
[53:39] that and you begin to think well
[53:41] all these things can be impersonated but
[53:43] what cannot be impersonated is the seed
[53:45] itself
[53:47] it's an original it's not
[53:51] hybrid and so the life
[53:54] that that seed produces cannot be
[53:56] impersonated
[53:59] oh my you may have somebody
[54:03] that looks just like you out there in
[54:05] the world
[54:06] you may have i believe it's called a
[54:08] doppelganger someone who looks just like
[54:10] you do
[54:11] you may walk around and see that person
[54:13] they look just like you i hope there's
[54:15] not one out there that looks like me
[54:17] i feel sorry for them but probably there
[54:19] is somewhere they say everyone in the
[54:21] world has a twin somewhere so there may
[54:24] be somebody just like you
[54:26] but if you hang around them long enough
[54:27] you would recognize or people that were
[54:29] with you would recognize that's not you
[54:32] no matter how much they look like you
[54:34] because the characteristics would be
[54:36] different
[54:38] and when we're born again we bear the
[54:40] characteristics of christ
[54:42] it's an original
[54:45] there's something about a life but you
[54:47] can't observe that all at once
[54:48] because they maybe look like you in
[54:50] church it may
[54:52] look like you for a while but eventually
[54:55] you realize that's not them that's not
[54:57] it
[54:59] so we judge nothing before the time now
[55:03] so we have to trust what god has done
[55:06] for us and
[55:06] in acts 4 13 this is when peter and john
[55:11] went and healed the men at the gate
[55:12] beautiful and spoke to him and
[55:15] and when they did the pharisees and the
[55:18] sadducees saw the boldness of peter and
[55:20] john and perceived
[55:22] that they were unlearned and ignorant
[55:23] men they were as i said before
[55:26] ignorant ignoramuses
[55:29] and it says they marveled and they took
[55:32] knowledge of them
[55:34] that they had been with jesus we
[55:37] remember somebody else who was bold like
[55:39] this
[55:41] we remember that these men have been
[55:44] with jesus and that boldness was in
[55:46] contrast to their previous behavior
[55:48] which was to hide and to deny
[55:51] but now they begin to step out what had
[55:53] happened pentecost had happened
[55:55] they've been born again
[55:59] and in acts 11 26
[56:02] we find that when paul and barnabas paul
[56:05] find some folks in antioch that need to
[56:07] be taught the word
[56:09] and so he goes to he goes to find
[56:13] paul and he brings him back barnabas
[56:15] goes to find paul
[56:16] brings him back and it says when he had
[56:18] found him he brought him into antioch
[56:20] and it came to pass to the whole year
[56:22] they assembled themselves with the
[56:24] church and taught much
[56:26] people and i just love the way this
[56:30] scripture reads because it tells us what
[56:32] happens
[56:32] when people hear the word
[56:35] when people hear the word the word
[56:37] itself is enough
[56:41] and we have to hold on to that because
[56:42] sometimes with allen it seems like that
[56:44] nothing is taking place nothing's
[56:46] happening but the word is
[56:47] sharper and powerful than more powerful
[56:49] than a two-edged sword
[56:50] it never said my ministry would be never
[56:54] said that another ministry would be but
[56:55] it said the word
[56:56] is more powerful the word is power the
[56:59] word has power the word is life and so
[57:01] as they assembled themselves with the
[57:03] church for a year all of a sudden the
[57:05] disciples
[57:06] were called christians
[57:11] why because paul and barnabas had been
[57:14] teaching them the word for a year
[57:16] and it began to bear fruit in their
[57:17] lives
[57:19] why they had a new birth it had an
[57:21] experience yes but it grew in their
[57:23] lives
[57:24] that's how you know the one from the
[57:25] other that's how we know we're born of
[57:27] god
[57:28] is because the word produces something
[57:30] in our lives
[57:32] now look acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it
[57:36] says then they that gladly receive his
[57:37] word received his word were baptized and
[57:39] this is when peter
[57:41] said that great statement when he talked
[57:43] about
[57:44] that if you repent and are baptized in
[57:46] the name of jesus christ for the
[57:47] remission of sins
[57:49] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[57:50] ghost and they that gladly receive that
[57:53] word were baptized
[57:55] in the same day they were added unto
[57:56] them about three thousand souls
[57:59] and notice and they continued
[58:01] steadfastly
[58:04] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[58:07] and in breaking a bread and a prayers
[58:10] and fear come upon every soul and many
[58:12] wonders and signs were done by the
[58:13] apostles now
[58:15] i don't want to go beyond i don't want
[58:16] to presume this but i believe this
[58:20] that if the experience at pentecost had
[58:21] not been followed by them continually
[58:24] continuing steadfastly in the apostles
[58:26] doctrine and fellowship
[58:28] it would have been shown that it was a
[58:30] false birth
[58:33] but the proof that this was that
[58:36] was the fact that they continued in the
[58:38] apostles doctrine
[58:39] that after they come according to dr
[58:41] peter's prescription
[58:42] how do we know that the prescription
[58:44] worked because they did it
[58:45] and they were changed right now
[58:51] excuse me for yelling at you i hate
[58:54] yelling at a few people
[59:01] oh brother branham in the rapture
[59:04] and you could take all of these things
[59:06] and go find and you'll find them not
[59:08] saying something brother branham didn't
[59:09] say
[59:10] in the rapture he's brother brown says
[59:11] when it comes to an oh glory i got the
[59:13] anointing and it's the genuine anointing
[59:16] he said remember kf has had it too and
[59:18] prophesied
[59:19] so did balaam have it in prophesied but
[59:22] that don't have nothing to do with this
[59:24] inside
[59:25] he said unless that was god's seed i
[59:28] like this
[59:30] he said it don't have anything to do
[59:31] with what's inside unless
[59:34] it's god's seed amen
[59:37] it's gene from the beginning
[59:38] predestinated you're finished
[59:40] so if it's not god's seed it doesn't
[59:42] matter he said i don't care how much you
[59:44] shout
[59:44] speak with tongues run shout that has
[59:46] nothing to do with it kokober can count
[59:48] just as much as any of the rest of them
[59:49] he said i've seen
[59:50] heathens raise and shout and speak in
[59:52] tongues drink blood out of a human skull
[59:54] calling the devil
[59:56] he said so he said any of them
[59:57] sensations and things forget it
[1:00:00] he said it's your heart in that word
[1:00:03] listen to this church this is enough
[1:00:05] right here to make us shout
[1:00:08] he said it's your heart in that word and
[1:00:11] that's
[1:00:11] christ bring in there he said and watch
[1:00:15] it
[1:00:15] make itself known and see you maybe
[1:00:19] you've got your family
[1:00:20] would act a certain way brother joe i
[1:00:22] don't know how your family acts but
[1:00:24] but i know a little bit about how you
[1:00:25] act and that's good
[1:00:28] and you you've gotta but there's
[1:00:29] something you're different maybe than
[1:00:30] even some what your family would
[1:00:32] naturally do
[1:00:34] and you've grown into that why because
[1:00:36] your heart is in the word and it's
[1:00:37] opened up it's made itself known
[1:00:40] in your life and you can see that in
[1:00:41] some little way and you think well
[1:00:43] you know my my grandfather or my uncle
[1:00:46] or someone in your family i don't know
[1:00:47] who it would be that
[1:00:48] that you would know that maybe they
[1:00:50] wouldn't have reacted like that
[1:00:52] and there was a time i wouldn't have
[1:00:54] reacted like that but now i can see that
[1:00:57] something's changed
[1:00:59] i'm different than what i was what is
[1:01:02] that the new birth
[1:01:05] and so brother branham says if your
[1:01:07] heart your heart and the word watch it
[1:01:09] make
[1:01:09] itself known just as it opens up
[1:01:12] like any other seed think about it from
[1:01:16] one you don't have to be a theologian to
[1:01:17] think about how the seed
[1:01:19] rots and dies and then the life that's
[1:01:22] inside of it is awaken and begins to
[1:01:23] grow
[1:01:24] when that moisture hits the seed and all
[1:01:26] the sudden and the light hits the seed
[1:01:27] all of a sudden it begins to grow it
[1:01:30] begins to open up what it is but it
[1:01:31] don't become that overnight
[1:01:33] it becomes that over the lifetime of the
[1:01:36] plant
[1:01:37] right until finally it reaches its full
[1:01:39] age
[1:01:41] he said just as it opens up like any
[1:01:43] other seed and declares itself
[1:01:45] for the age it's living in amen
[1:01:50] now i want to go to first peter chapter
[1:01:52] one and maybe this will
[1:01:53] help us tonight and if we have trouble
[1:01:57] understanding this and i know i have in
[1:01:58] the past so if you all haven't you bear
[1:02:00] with me
[1:02:01] but i've had trouble at times
[1:02:04] understanding why people act the way
[1:02:06] that they do it and i do believe in
[1:02:08] having an experience with god but
[1:02:10] there's more to it
[1:02:12] than just an experience because it's a
[1:02:15] continuation of your walk with god
[1:02:18] and the scripture tells us that if you
[1:02:20] endure to the end you'll be saved
[1:02:24] it tells us judge nothing before the
[1:02:25] time and you can't tell anything by
[1:02:28] watching somebody for 15 minutes in
[1:02:30] church
[1:02:31] and it's why we don't promote people
[1:02:33] just
[1:02:34] quickly to positions that's why we watch
[1:02:36] and try to
[1:02:37] pray and hold on to things you shouldn't
[1:02:39] marry somebody quickly because
[1:02:41] i guess i'll talk speak to my children
[1:02:43] there's not very many of marrying age
[1:02:45] but
[1:02:45] they're not either but i mean they will
[1:02:47] be
[1:02:50] and you shouldn't marry anyone before
[1:02:51] the time right
[1:02:54] because if you do you'll end up in
[1:02:56] trouble
[1:02:57] down the road and it may be years later
[1:02:59] but there'll be trouble
[1:03:00] and so and even in the best marriages we
[1:03:03] have problems
[1:03:05] i consider my marriage to be one of the
[1:03:07] best but we still have we've had
[1:03:08] problems not
[1:03:09] not anything that would because we're
[1:03:11] committed to one another but just the
[1:03:12] things of life
[1:03:14] it's hard enough if you've got the right
[1:03:16] one it's much harder if you get the
[1:03:18] wrong one and do it hastily
[1:03:21] so we should wait and we should pray for
[1:03:23] these things and
[1:03:24] and and the same thing is true of any
[1:03:26] life when we're watching somebody's life
[1:03:27] it's a process over time
[1:03:30] you won't know and and i know this and i
[1:03:33] know that
[1:03:34] sometimes i'm not easy to get to know
[1:03:36] but my purpose here is not to
[1:03:38] just make you my friend and i want you
[1:03:40] to be my friend okay
[1:03:42] but that's not my entire purpose here i
[1:03:44] want to bring the word
[1:03:46] and that's the main thing and but i want
[1:03:48] to be your friend too but you may not
[1:03:50] get to know me quickly
[1:03:51] but but don't judge it before the time
[1:03:53] you know let's walk down this road a
[1:03:55] little bit
[1:03:56] because sometimes it takes a long time
[1:03:58] to get to a point where you realize i
[1:04:00] can put confidence in in a ministry
[1:04:03] and that's okay i i get that
[1:04:06] but we always should have confidence in
[1:04:08] the word
[1:04:11] so now first peter 1 13 peter talks
[1:04:15] about this and he says wherefore gird up
[1:04:16] the loins of your mind
[1:04:19] be sober and hope to the end
[1:04:23] we're going to read down to verse 25 so
[1:04:26] if you
[1:04:26] if you have your bibles that would be
[1:04:28] good to to open up to that
[1:04:30] he says wherefore gird up the loins of
[1:04:32] your mind be sober
[1:04:33] hope to the end for the grace that is to
[1:04:36] be brought unto you
[1:04:37] at the revelation of jesus christ hope
[1:04:39] to the end
[1:04:41] as i begin reading that that stuck out
[1:04:43] at me as i was reading it just right
[1:04:45] before church
[1:04:46] you don't hope and say well well i've
[1:04:49] got it i've got everything i need but
[1:04:50] you keep that hope to the end right that
[1:04:54] expectation which is what biblical hope
[1:04:56] is not just maybe it'll happen but an
[1:04:58] expectation
[1:04:59] of the grace is to be brought unto you
[1:05:01] the revelation of jesus christ said
[1:05:03] i've got all the grace that i need he
[1:05:05] didn't he said you didn't
[1:05:07] but there's something to be brought into
[1:05:08] the revelation of jesus christ what is
[1:05:10] that the change of our bodies
[1:05:12] that's rapturing grace now he said gird
[1:05:15] up the loins of your mind and of course
[1:05:17] you know as
[1:05:17] people in those eastern countries they
[1:05:19] would when they were traveling or
[1:05:20] running would take their long garments
[1:05:22] and tie them up
[1:05:23] so they wouldn't get tripped up your
[1:05:26] mind is what will trip you up when it
[1:05:28] comes to the new birth
[1:05:30] huh because the devil will try to make
[1:05:32] you think you have it when you don't
[1:05:34] it'll try to make you think you don't
[1:05:35] have it when you do
[1:05:38] and people sometimes worry about that
[1:05:39] and sometimes the best clue that you've
[1:05:41] got it is when the devil tries to tell
[1:05:42] you you don't
[1:05:45] right because he's obviously going to
[1:05:47] lie to us
[1:05:49] he's the father of lies and so people
[1:05:53] would do that they would they would gird
[1:05:54] up their loins to keep from tripping and
[1:05:57] so wesley put it this way he said gather
[1:05:59] up all your thoughts and affections keep
[1:06:01] your mind always
[1:06:02] disencumbered prepared to run the race
[1:06:05] and we know in in second corinthians and
[1:06:07] i won't go there to save time but paul
[1:06:09] tells us to cast down imaginations
[1:06:13] and every high thing that exalts itself
[1:06:14] against the knowledge of god and bring
[1:06:16] into captivity every thought that's the
[1:06:18] same idea
[1:06:19] gird up the lord you say what does that
[1:06:20] have to do with the new birth well we'll
[1:06:22] see in a moment
[1:06:23] you've got to gird up the loins of your
[1:06:25] imagination to
[1:06:27] tie yourself to the word where you don't
[1:06:30] get tripped up by an emotion or a
[1:06:32] sensation
[1:06:34] but bring your mind into obedience to
[1:06:36] the word
[1:06:38] because today you may feel safe tomorrow
[1:06:40] you may not feel saved
[1:06:42] gird up the loins of your mind
[1:06:46] today you may make a mistake tonight and
[1:06:48] say well i'm not safe today i need to be
[1:06:49] re-saved no
[1:06:50] girl up the loins of your mind don't let
[1:06:52] your imagination tell you you're not
[1:06:54] what you are
[1:06:56] right gird up the loins of your mind
[1:06:58] like don't let your imagination run away
[1:07:00] with you and tell you well i'll just be
[1:07:02] like everybody else i'm just
[1:07:03] you know my family's this way or so and
[1:07:05] so this way i just got to do what they
[1:07:07] do know
[1:07:08] keep your mind girded up grab all those
[1:07:11] thoughts and bring them into captivity
[1:07:14] so that you can look at the word sanely
[1:07:16] and soberly
[1:07:17] and i am who the word says i am
[1:07:21] not because of how i feel because i know
[1:07:24] and as i said some of you young
[1:07:26] younger folks my age
[1:07:29] but my kids are getting older and i'm
[1:07:32] going to leave all the rest of the
[1:07:33] children to y'all
[1:07:35] but when it comes to having kids in
[1:07:38] church i never had to deal with that so
[1:07:39] much but my wife didn't get anything out
[1:07:40] of church for years
[1:07:43] because of that or very little but you
[1:07:46] know what
[1:07:47] sometimes you don't feel safe during
[1:07:49] that time
[1:07:52] all i do is take care of kids sometimes
[1:07:54] i don't feel safe dealing with kids now
[1:07:59] you can your imagination gets running
[1:08:01] away with you say well i don't always
[1:08:02] act like i should at home i don't always
[1:08:04] know
[1:08:04] what does the word say
[1:08:08] cast down those imaginations and bring
[1:08:09] into captivity every thought
[1:08:11] to the obedience of christ i said well
[1:08:15] if i went to this certain meeting or
[1:08:16] went heard a certain preacher no
[1:08:18] cast down imaginations what does the
[1:08:20] word say
[1:08:21] verse 14 has obedient children
[1:08:25] not fashioning yourselves notice that
[1:08:27] word fashioning not fashioning
[1:08:29] yourselves according to the former lust
[1:08:30] in your ignorance that
[1:08:31] word fashioning is the same word that's
[1:08:33] found in romans 12 2
[1:08:35] where he talks about not conforming be
[1:08:37] not conformed to this world
[1:08:39] it's the same greek word it's the only
[1:08:40] two times it's mentioned in the new
[1:08:41] testament
[1:08:42] don't be fashioned don't be conformed to
[1:08:45] the world
[1:08:46] but he says be transformed
[1:08:49] so the idea is not forming or modeling
[1:08:52] your life
[1:08:53] they were not to make their own former
[1:08:56] principles
[1:08:57] and conduct the model listen when we
[1:09:00] start a home sometimes we want to make
[1:09:01] our family the model for that home
[1:09:03] and there's some things that are good we
[1:09:04] can get from our family but the model
[1:09:06] has to be the word
[1:09:08] when we start a church we want the model
[1:09:10] to be some other great church but the
[1:09:11] model has to be the word
[1:09:13] so he said don't don't fashion yourself
[1:09:15] don't model yourselves according to the
[1:09:17] way you used to act
[1:09:19] you're to be different you're governed
[1:09:20] by new laws molding your life in a
[1:09:22] different way
[1:09:24] so paul tells us don't be conformed to
[1:09:26] the world but be transformed
[1:09:29] and that word transformed is
[1:09:31] metamorphosis it's a changing of a
[1:09:32] creature
[1:09:33] into something else so brother brown
[1:09:36] said
[1:09:37] it goes into that he said now this word
[1:09:38] transformed i'll come back to
[1:09:40] first peter chapter one in a moment this
[1:09:43] word
[1:09:43] transformed he said i looked up in the
[1:09:45] dictionary he said when i almost lost
[1:09:46] track of the time that i was to be up
[1:09:48] here
[1:09:48] he said i was looking for a text and he
[1:09:50] said i found the scripture in the
[1:09:52] dictionary it's something that's changed
[1:09:54] it's to be changed transform made
[1:09:57] different than what it was
[1:10:01] that's what god did for us isn't it made
[1:10:04] me different from what i was
[1:10:07] well you said when did he do that well
[1:10:09] it may have been at a certain time
[1:10:11] we can point back to but that's not when
[1:10:12] you were fully changed
[1:10:15] because you're different now than you
[1:10:16] were as i said 10 years ago
[1:10:19] and hopefully better as a child of god
[1:10:22] you change for the better but what's
[1:10:23] happened
[1:10:24] you're being transformed so he said
[1:10:27] don't be conformed but be transformed
[1:10:29] it's he said it's made different than
[1:10:31] what it was it's been his character and
[1:10:32] everything has been changed to transform
[1:10:35] and he said i was thinking this morning
[1:10:37] in genesis 1 that this world was without
[1:10:39] form and it was void
[1:10:41] darkness was upon the earth nothing but
[1:10:43] a complete chaos
[1:10:44] when this world was in that condition
[1:10:47] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[1:10:49] the water
[1:10:50] and the entire picture was changed from
[1:10:53] a total chaos
[1:10:54] to a garden of eden that
[1:10:58] is the transforming power of god
[1:11:01] i love this that can take something
[1:11:03] that's nothing
[1:11:04] and make something wonderful out of it
[1:11:07] so he says don't be
[1:11:08] fashioned according to this world don't
[1:11:10] be molded to this world but be
[1:11:12] transformed
[1:11:13] like he did at the beginning what did
[1:11:15] that at the beginning
[1:11:17] the word and then the spirit come down
[1:11:21] and brooded over the word and brought it
[1:11:24] to life
[1:11:26] amen oh aren't we grateful for the word
[1:11:30] of god today
[1:11:31] when the world is in that condition and
[1:11:33] think about it you say well my life
[1:11:35] right now is chaotic but think
[1:11:36] of the garden of eden and how it came
[1:11:38] out of that chaos how did it reach that
[1:11:40] place
[1:11:41] because somebody there was seed there
[1:11:44] that
[1:11:44] that manifested itself into a garden of
[1:11:46] eden
[1:11:48] it was the word of god god said let
[1:11:50] there be
[1:11:51] whatever god has spoken about you has
[1:11:53] already been spoken it's already been
[1:11:54] thought you realize that
[1:11:56] we've already been it's already been
[1:11:58] thought he's not going to change it now
[1:12:01] whatever he thought about you has
[1:12:02] already been thought
[1:12:04] and so the fact that he won't change it
[1:12:06] means you don't have to worry
[1:12:08] it's going to come out all right why
[1:12:11] because he's going to take a total chaos
[1:12:13] over here to a garden of eden he's
[1:12:15] transforming but he doesn't do that
[1:12:16] overnight
[1:12:18] it doesn't happen in one meeting doesn't
[1:12:21] happen there may be
[1:12:22] a time that it clicks but that won't be
[1:12:24] the end of it
[1:12:26] it'll continue to be transformed aren't
[1:12:28] you glad some of you have known
[1:12:30] 10 15 20 years some of you haven't i've
[1:12:32] just recently met
[1:12:34] but aren't you glad that you don't have
[1:12:35] to be the person you was when you met me
[1:12:38] and i don't have to be the person that i
[1:12:40] was when i met you
[1:12:47] glad i'm not the person that i was first
[1:12:48] time i think i i
[1:12:50] come here one of the first times i come
[1:12:52] here brother john lafontaine was here
[1:12:54] i'm glad i'm not that 16 year old
[1:12:56] anymore
[1:12:59] and i remember after that coming and
[1:13:00] allen was on the drums but i'm
[1:13:02] he's probably glad he's not the same
[1:13:04] person back then or
[1:13:05] now that he was back then
[1:13:09] all of us i think could say that what is
[1:13:12] that the transforming power of god
[1:13:15] amen it takes something that's nothing
[1:13:18] that's me
[1:13:20] make something wonderful out of it
[1:13:24] to be transformed is to be changed and
[1:13:26] made something different
[1:13:30] i love the way a prophet of god just
[1:13:31] explains this so simply he said like a
[1:13:33] tadpole
[1:13:34] it's transformed from a tadpole
[1:13:38] to a frog even our children can
[1:13:40] understand that
[1:13:42] it's a tadpole it doesn't look nothing
[1:13:44] like a frog
[1:13:45] but after a while you begin to see
[1:13:46] little legs sticking out
[1:13:48] after a while its body begins to change
[1:13:51] it loses that fat then
[1:13:52] it goes different places and it comes
[1:13:54] down it's got a little bug ice what is
[1:13:56] it it's a frog
[1:13:56] that's what it was all the time that's
[1:13:58] the potentials that it had
[1:14:00] but it has to become that so he says be
[1:14:03] transformed
[1:14:04] like a tadpole is transformed from a
[1:14:06] tadpole to a frog
[1:14:07] see once he looked like a catfish he
[1:14:10] swims around he's got a head on his tail
[1:14:12] everything looks just like a catfish
[1:14:15] after a while he begins
[1:14:16] to lose he loses the tail and he's
[1:14:18] transformed from one specie to another
[1:14:23] like a butterfly being changed from what
[1:14:26] he is and that's what
[1:14:27] metamorphosis is that's where we get
[1:14:29] that from that greek word we should be
[1:14:30] transformed
[1:14:31] be changed from a from a little
[1:14:33] caterpillar to a butterfly
[1:14:39] verse 15 says but as he which has called
[1:14:41] you is holy first peter 1 15
[1:14:44] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[1:14:46] that's lifestyle
[1:14:48] not just part of your life but all of
[1:14:50] your life all manner of
[1:14:52] lifestyle big manner of life because it
[1:14:53] is written
[1:14:55] be holy for i am holy and brother
[1:14:57] branham says this
[1:14:58] about this it's godliness sanctification
[1:15:01] he says you believe in sanctification be
[1:15:04] holy for i am holy now you cannot be
[1:15:06] holy
[1:15:09] well that's interesting he said be holy
[1:15:12] and the prophet of god says you can't be
[1:15:14] holy
[1:15:16] he said i'm not depending on my holiness
[1:15:18] that's why we need a new birth
[1:15:20] because it's something inside it's not
[1:15:22] us you can't
[1:15:24] be holy i'm not depending on my holiness
[1:15:25] i have none but i'm depending on his
[1:15:27] holiness
[1:15:28] it's his holiness that i'm looking at
[1:15:31] not with not what i was but what he
[1:15:33] is amen
[1:15:36] you don't have to tell a sheep to bear
[1:15:38] wool or you go up to a sheep as
[1:15:40] brother branham taught and he must be
[1:15:41] born again you don't sit there and tell
[1:15:43] it manufacture me some wool
[1:15:45] well it can't do it it bears wool
[1:15:49] and if you take that sheep and feed it
[1:15:51] the right diet and
[1:15:52] give it the right kind of care it'll
[1:15:53] always bear wool
[1:15:56] the same thing is true of our lives if
[1:15:59] you've been born again then
[1:16:01] you just take that sheep and you just
[1:16:03] you just put it in the right atmosphere
[1:16:04] it's going to do what sheep do
[1:16:09] other times it might act like a goat and
[1:16:10] usually it's because it's in the wrong
[1:16:12] atmosphere
[1:16:14] but that's not what's on the inside
[1:16:15] verse 17 he says
[1:16:17] if you call on the father who without
[1:16:18] respect of persons judges every
[1:16:20] according
[1:16:21] notice to every man's work without
[1:16:24] respect to persons whether it's a
[1:16:26] a pastor or or a laity whether it's
[1:16:29] a man that's been in the message for 40
[1:16:31] years or one that's been a message for a
[1:16:32] year
[1:16:33] or a man or a woman or a boy or a girl
[1:16:35] doesn't matter
[1:16:37] he judges according to every man's work
[1:16:40] so he said pass the time of your journey
[1:16:43] here in fear
[1:16:44] and that fear is not torment as we know
[1:16:45] but godly fear in proverbs it says happy
[1:16:48] is the man that feareth always
[1:16:51] happy is the man that feareth always now
[1:16:54] that's not to be afraid and you know
[1:16:56] that to be
[1:16:57] to be in terror all the time but it says
[1:16:59] he that hardeneth his heart shall fall
[1:17:01] into mischief
[1:17:02] so what is fearing is keeping a soft
[1:17:04] heart
[1:17:06] happy is the man that's always
[1:17:08] respectful and
[1:17:10] recognizes that god is watching
[1:17:14] and david says i'm paraphrasing but in
[1:17:16] the psalms he says everything i do
[1:17:18] is at the throne of god i know he sees
[1:17:21] me
[1:17:22] amen so
[1:17:25] in verse 18 first peter 1 18 says for as
[1:17:27] much as you know you were not redeemed
[1:17:29] with corruptible things
[1:17:31] silver and gold from your vain
[1:17:33] conversation or your vain manner of life
[1:17:36] received by tradition from your fathers
[1:17:39] you can't be saved by those works
[1:17:42] either good works or emotions so he said
[1:17:44] you had a
[1:17:46] a manner of life and they would dress a
[1:17:48] certain way and have a certain
[1:17:50] identity as jews but that doesn't make
[1:17:53] them born again
[1:17:55] and if we're not careful we get into
[1:17:56] that in the message where we have a
[1:17:57] certain way of doing things and we think
[1:17:59] well that
[1:18:00] saves us but he said you weren't saved
[1:18:02] by your vain manner of life
[1:18:04] received by tradition from your fathers
[1:18:05] you can't be saved by works
[1:18:07] you can't be saved by anything you do
[1:18:10] you
[1:18:10] saved verse 19 with the precious blood
[1:18:13] of christ
[1:18:15] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:18:17] spot
[1:18:18] who verily was foreordained before the
[1:18:20] foundation of the world but was manifest
[1:18:22] in these
[1:18:23] last times for you aren't you glad he
[1:18:25] was manifested for you
[1:18:27] that which was predestined listen he
[1:18:29] said he was fortunate for ordained
[1:18:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:18:32] but that which was predestined become a
[1:18:34] reality
[1:18:35] and predestination doesn't exist just in
[1:18:38] god's mind
[1:18:39] but he predestined us to be conformed to
[1:18:41] the image of his son
[1:18:42] to make it all the way through it's not
[1:18:46] just a concept but it's a reality
[1:18:49] first peter 1 21 who by him do believe
[1:18:52] in god
[1:18:53] that raised him up from the dead and
[1:18:54] gave him glory that your faith and hope
[1:18:55] might be in god
[1:18:57] seeing you have purified your souls and
[1:18:59] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:19:02] unto unfeigned love of the brethren you
[1:19:04] don't have to fake loving god's people
[1:19:07] why because you've been born again
[1:19:09] you're the same blood of the same spirit
[1:19:12] he said unto unfeigned love of the
[1:19:14] brethren see that you love one another
[1:19:16] with a pure heart fervently
[1:19:19] i like the way the god's word version
[1:19:21] puts this it says love each other with a
[1:19:23] warm love
[1:19:24] that comes from the heart after all you
[1:19:26] have purified yourselves by obeying the
[1:19:28] truth
[1:19:29] as a result you have a sincere love for
[1:19:32] each other
[1:19:33] verse 23 this is what i'm getting to
[1:19:36] tonight and
[1:19:36] all of this is peter writes it all
[1:19:39] together he's telling a story he's
[1:19:41] giving us an example
[1:19:43] some examples he says being born again
[1:19:46] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:19:49] incorruptible
[1:19:51] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:19:53] abideth forever
[1:19:55] what are you born again by by the word
[1:20:02] by the word brother brown says and i'm
[1:20:06] going to hurry through this because
[1:20:07] we're losing time and i know what time
[1:20:08] it is tonight so
[1:20:10] we're losing time but brother branham
[1:20:13] says if a man is born of the word
[1:20:16] being born again he quotes the scripture
[1:20:19] he says he will
[1:20:20] produce the word
[1:20:25] that makes us all check up doesn't it
[1:20:29] the fruit or works of his life will be a
[1:20:31] product of the kind of seed or life that
[1:20:33] is in him
[1:20:34] his works therefore will be scriptural
[1:20:37] he talks about what an indictment that
[1:20:39] will be to that pergamy and age
[1:20:43] and he goes on on the next quote he said
[1:20:45] in fact the word is judging even now
[1:20:48] it is the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:20:50] intents of the heart
[1:20:51] it cuts us under the cardinal from the
[1:20:53] spiritual it makes us living epistles
[1:20:55] read and known
[1:20:56] of all men to the glory of god he said i
[1:20:59] know your works
[1:21:01] i know that works and brother brahman
[1:21:04] says this if a man fears that he might
[1:21:05] not please god then let him fulfill the
[1:21:07] word
[1:21:08] he said well i can't be saved by works
[1:21:10] right but your works show if you are
[1:21:12] saved that's true
[1:21:15] you can't be saved apart from works in
[1:21:17] the sense that brother branham said
[1:21:19] it's like this that he said you'd say
[1:21:21] you have faith but after a while
[1:21:23] if you say you're married and the wife
[1:21:25] never shows up after a while people quit
[1:21:26] believing you
[1:21:29] you say you're married she don't ever
[1:21:31] show up and say every time i invite you
[1:21:32] over it's just you
[1:21:34] saying where's that wife at
[1:21:38] so that's the way works are they show up
[1:21:40] eventually because it's part of who you
[1:21:42] are he said if a man wonders if you'll
[1:21:45] hear those words well done
[1:21:46] good and faithful servant that's what i
[1:21:48] want to hear
[1:21:50] that's what i want to hear at the end i
[1:21:52] want that from you
[1:21:54] if i'm here for 20 years 50 years if god
[1:21:56] terry's
[1:21:57] if i'm here for a year i want to i want
[1:21:59] to hear from you that that
[1:22:00] i was faithful but most of all i want to
[1:22:02] hear from him
[1:22:05] isn't that your desire today if a man
[1:22:08] wants to hear those words let him
[1:22:09] fulfill
[1:22:10] the word of god in his life and
[1:22:11] assuredly he will hear those words of
[1:22:13] praise
[1:22:14] the word of truth was the criterion then
[1:22:16] it is the criteria now
[1:22:18] there isn't another standard there isn't
[1:22:20] another plumb line is the world is going
[1:22:22] to be judged by one christ jesus
[1:22:24] even so it is going to be judged by the
[1:22:26] word if a man wants to know how he is
[1:22:28] how he is making out let him do as james
[1:22:31] suggests
[1:22:32] look into the mirror of god's word
[1:22:36] verse 24 this is important for
[1:22:40] born of were born of corruptable seed he
[1:22:42] says not incorrupt
[1:22:43] or incorruptable seed not corruptable
[1:22:46] and this is why he said because
[1:22:47] why that's important because all flesh
[1:22:49] is grass
[1:22:50] is as grass and all the glory of man is
[1:22:53] the flower of grass
[1:22:55] the grass withers and the flower thereof
[1:22:58] falleth
[1:22:59] away and so if our works
[1:23:03] are what saves us or if an emotion is
[1:23:07] what saves
[1:23:08] us when that withers we're not saved
[1:23:10] anymore
[1:23:13] if we're saved because we trust a man
[1:23:15] any man
[1:23:17] even ourselves our own flesh
[1:23:20] we're saved because we trust anybody
[1:23:25] man if we say because we trust in any
[1:23:28] arm of flesh when that withers when that
[1:23:30] falls away
[1:23:31] we're not saved no more but he says
[1:23:33] verse 25 the word of the lord endures
[1:23:36] forever
[1:23:38] then if you're saved god didn't save you
[1:23:40] to lose you right
[1:23:41] he saved you to keep you he didn't bring
[1:23:44] you in to lose you so if you're saved
[1:23:46] not to be lost then what happens
[1:23:49] the word of the lord endures forever if
[1:23:51] you're saved to not be lost you have to
[1:23:53] be saved by the word
[1:23:56] and so this is the most important thing
[1:23:57] but it's the thing sometimes we give the
[1:23:59] least
[1:23:59] time in in our lives but the word is so
[1:24:02] important
[1:24:03] because this he said this is the word
[1:24:05] which by the gospel is preached unto you
[1:24:07] what word
[1:24:08] the word that saves you the word that
[1:24:11] keeps you to the end
[1:24:14] now if we're not careful
[1:24:17] as brother brown said you must be born
[1:24:19] again he talks about false teachers who
[1:24:21] bring false births
[1:24:22] god help us to not do this false
[1:24:25] teachers bring false births why because
[1:24:27] they point to something else other than
[1:24:28] the word that's why
[1:24:30] brother branham is so careful not to
[1:24:31] draw us away from the word
[1:24:33] and to tell us if he didn't have
[1:24:35] scripture for it that he didn't
[1:24:38] right because sometimes people take this
[1:24:40] both ways they'll tell the people you
[1:24:42] can do whatever you want to
[1:24:43] based on what their own word
[1:24:47] well then salvation comes from him and
[1:24:48] it produces false births
[1:24:51] and then on the other side people say
[1:24:52] well you can as long as you don't
[1:24:54] do this that makes you different it
[1:24:57] means you're saved
[1:24:58] we need to be careful about pointing out
[1:24:59] any one thing and calling out that the
[1:25:01] antichrist
[1:25:03] any one thing and calling that the the
[1:25:05] thing that'll no it's
[1:25:07] it's a life in christ that makes you
[1:25:09] saved that shows that you're saved
[1:25:12] but we call it one thing we say well
[1:25:13] that's the antichrist that's the wrong
[1:25:15] thing
[1:25:16] but the word of the lord endures forever
[1:25:18] and if you point out
[1:25:19] just if all you do is become against
[1:25:22] what that one thing
[1:25:23] you produce false births it's a lopsided
[1:25:27] teaching of the gospel
[1:25:30] and i say god help me to do that because
[1:25:32] so many people it's easy to
[1:25:33] differentiate yourself
[1:25:35] you realize that if you preach false
[1:25:36] doctrine more people come
[1:25:40] and i don't say that because i believe
[1:25:41] god's going to fill this church up
[1:25:43] so i don't say that because i want to
[1:25:44] have a small church but that's that's my
[1:25:46] faith to believe that
[1:25:48] empty pews never inspired anybody
[1:25:51] right but but but in reality you say
[1:25:54] well
[1:25:54] that's not true well look at the message
[1:25:56] and look at denominations
[1:25:58] who has the biggest churches the people
[1:26:00] that are that are the craziest
[1:26:03] when it comes to what they believe i
[1:26:06] mean you look at the huge
[1:26:07] mega churches in this country and they
[1:26:09] don't teach anything right
[1:26:11] they don't teach anything at all most of
[1:26:14] them why
[1:26:15] because people people will flock to that
[1:26:17] but the real
[1:26:18] bride has to hear the word and false
[1:26:21] teachers bring
[1:26:22] false verse but true prophets will bring
[1:26:24] the word
[1:26:25] the birth of the word christ false
[1:26:28] prophets will bring false birth
[1:26:29] the birth of churches the birth of
[1:26:31] creeds the birth of denominations
[1:26:33] that's where isms come from in the
[1:26:34] message false prophets producing false
[1:26:37] births to produce an ism that makes
[1:26:39] people think they're saved because they
[1:26:40] believe it
[1:26:45] and we're not over that it'll come again
[1:26:48] the lord tarries there'll be more
[1:26:50] there'll be more we've seen many come
[1:26:52] down the pike but there will be more
[1:26:54] people with
[1:26:54] with a special revelation or something
[1:26:56] different and people will flock to that
[1:26:58] because it makes them feel revelated
[1:27:00] but false teachers produce false births
[1:27:04] and it's a birth of denominationalism he
[1:27:06] said here you are a pentecostal brother
[1:27:08] he said false sensations tell a man he's
[1:27:11] got the holy ghost because he speaks
[1:27:12] with tongues
[1:27:13] i've seen devils speak with tongues
[1:27:15] pencils lay down write an unknown toast
[1:27:17] he said that don't mean a thing
[1:27:18] see it's got to be a life by their fruit
[1:27:20] so you know you shall know them
[1:27:22] brother branham do you believe in
[1:27:23] speaking in tongues yes sir do you
[1:27:24] believe in shouting yes sir
[1:27:25] to be a christian i believe that i
[1:27:27] believe god's word but if the life isn't
[1:27:29] there to back it up
[1:27:31] you see when mary left jesus at the
[1:27:33] temple but the realm talks about a birth
[1:27:35] of the word
[1:27:36] it's the birth of christ and he types
[1:27:38] that and he talks about how that
[1:27:40] it's been revealed in this hour that we
[1:27:42] understand that that birth was without
[1:27:44] sensation
[1:27:46] now why is that important it means that
[1:27:47] man didn't handle it
[1:27:50] man wasn't involved in it he was god
[1:27:55] it wasn't it wasn't joseph that did it
[1:27:58] it wasn't mary that did it but without
[1:28:01] sensation the seed was put there
[1:28:03] oh my now
[1:28:06] so mary when jesus becomes 12 years old
[1:28:09] she leaves jesus at the temple
[1:28:12] and then she comes back and she says
[1:28:13] your father and i have been looking for
[1:28:14] you for days
[1:28:18] and brother branham is kind of hard on
[1:28:19] mary if you go back and listen to it
[1:28:21] he really is he says he says she denied
[1:28:24] the word
[1:28:27] and i know what you know just if you
[1:28:30] think about her at that time
[1:28:32] you know thinking about that all she was
[1:28:33] thinking about man we found him
[1:28:35] she thought she lost what she'd been
[1:28:37] entrusted you know it's a big deal
[1:28:40] you lost the virgin born son of god
[1:28:43] at the in jerusalem somewhere it's one
[1:28:46] thing we leave one of our kids in
[1:28:48] in walmart or something but she lost god
[1:28:50] if we could put it like that
[1:28:53] and she went back to find him and when
[1:28:55] she found him she said your father and i
[1:28:57] have been doing that because peace you
[1:28:58] know people when they deny the word in
[1:29:00] their lives they usually do it in a
[1:29:01] stressful situation
[1:29:05] but by doing that she attributed the
[1:29:07] birth to a sensation
[1:29:09] father and i she pointed to something
[1:29:12] that they could do
[1:29:15] in other words we brought you into the
[1:29:17] world we can take you out
[1:29:18] no not in that situation
[1:29:25] why i can tell my kids that because it's
[1:29:27] true
[1:29:30] but they couldn't say that why because
[1:29:32] she was not
[1:29:34] his earth his mother in that sense she
[1:29:36] he was
[1:29:37] joseph was not his father but he was the
[1:29:40] created son of god
[1:29:42] amen and brother branham says
[1:29:46] that he said pentecost took speaking in
[1:29:48] tongues he said and they denied the
[1:29:49] birth of the word and this is what he's
[1:29:52] talking about he said that's exactly
[1:29:54] what it did
[1:29:54] he said it'll take so much of it but it
[1:29:56] won't take the rest of it it denied the
[1:29:58] birth of the word just like mary did
[1:30:01] he said but watch there will not be any
[1:30:02] more organizations after this
[1:30:04] why because this bride will have a birth
[1:30:06] in the word and will not deny it
[1:30:09] will not attribute it to any man well
[1:30:11] that gives me hope tonight
[1:30:13] that gives me faith as we're closing in
[1:30:15] just a moment that that
[1:30:16] this bride will not fall why because
[1:30:18] they will not attribute the new birth to
[1:30:20] something other
[1:30:21] than the work of god
[1:30:25] will not attribute it to any man and i
[1:30:28] don't care which man it is
[1:30:30] he had nothing to do with your birth
[1:30:34] because if he did you've got a problem
[1:30:36] you're only as saved as he is
[1:30:40] oh church and no flesh is saved
[1:30:43] only the seed so there has to be a birth
[1:30:46] of the word that will not deny
[1:30:49] that the word is all that it took
[1:30:52] visions 2 8 tells us for by grace that
[1:30:55] you saved through faith and that not of
[1:30:56] yourselves
[1:30:57] it is the gift of god not of works lest
[1:31:01] any man should boast and say
[1:31:02] i did that
[1:31:05] for we are his workmanship
[1:31:09] created in christ jesus
[1:31:13] so it wasn't that god got together with
[1:31:15] your pastor and produced you as the son
[1:31:17] of god no
[1:31:19] god got together with brother branham
[1:31:20] and produced you as the son of god
[1:31:22] that's not how it works
[1:31:26] we're his workmanship how
[1:31:30] by the word we're created in him
[1:31:33] what created him that word circled the
[1:31:35] earth for all of those years a virgin
[1:31:37] shall conceive
[1:31:38] and one day it dropped down into a
[1:31:39] predestined vessel
[1:31:41] what happens with us the word comes to
[1:31:44] us
[1:31:44] at a predetermined time and place and we
[1:31:47] become
[1:31:47] birthed by the word and no one had any
[1:31:51] part in it but god
[1:31:53] you say well it was when brother
[1:31:54] so-and-so was preaching but it's not him
[1:31:56] that did it
[1:31:57] he was just preaching the word it was a
[1:32:00] certain song that i heard
[1:32:02] it could be that a certain testimony but
[1:32:04] it was the word
[1:32:07] not just the emotion of the music but
[1:32:09] the word
[1:32:11] saved by the word
[1:32:15] we are his workmanship created in christ
[1:32:16] jesus unto good works
[1:32:18] which god hath before ordained we should
[1:32:20] walk and the musicians come
[1:32:24] how do i know i'm born again how do i
[1:32:27] know i'm saved
[1:32:29] because the word awakened that
[1:32:31] transforming power of christ in my life
[1:32:34] to change me from a tadpole to what i
[1:32:37] was meant to be
[1:32:39] i know this doesn't make everybody
[1:32:41] excited but
[1:32:42] i think it'll feed our souls i pray it
[1:32:45] will
[1:32:46] i'm changed from a tadpole
[1:32:50] that's what i was just a you ever if
[1:32:52] you've handled a tadpole just a gooey
[1:32:54] lump of
[1:32:55] cells swimming around in the dirt
[1:32:58] somewhere
[1:32:59] i remember my grandpa had a farm and out
[1:33:01] on the farm
[1:33:02] there would be holes where he got a
[1:33:04] tractor every
[1:33:06] little holes when it would rain there
[1:33:08] would be puddles of water and tadpoles
[1:33:10] coming in puddles of water and swim
[1:33:13] around in that muck and that fire
[1:33:15] that's what i was
[1:33:18] but i believe what god says is true
[1:33:22] amen i believe that the word is true
[1:33:25] you believe it tonight that his
[1:33:28] requirements
[1:33:29] have come god's provided way have come
[1:33:31] according to the word
[1:33:34] and and one day i began to look at the
[1:33:36] fruit of my life and i began to see
[1:33:37] evidence but i had to believe it first
[1:33:41] saved by faith through grace amen
[1:33:44] amen and then they're saved by grace
[1:33:46] through faith and then
[1:33:47] i believe what god says i met his
[1:33:49] requirements all of a sudden the
[1:33:50] evidence begins to show
[1:33:52] my faith this truth was true brother
[1:33:55] brandon put it this way god come down in
[1:33:56] that muck where
[1:33:57] what you were and sought you out and
[1:34:00] brought you out
[1:34:01] he said and then after creating a
[1:34:02] perfect love look what you was
[1:34:04] look what you are what did that what
[1:34:06] transformed you somebody that loves you
[1:34:09] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:34:10] promised you then real genuine love
[1:34:13] will create a confidence in his word
[1:34:17] we believe that tonight we should judge
[1:34:20] nothing before the time
[1:34:22] because this has changed yet even your
[1:34:26] own flesh
[1:34:28] because the body of this flesh is not
[1:34:30] saved
[1:34:31] because of that we'll always have to
[1:34:32] believe
[1:34:34] as long as we're in this body one day
[1:34:37] what we believe becomes reality
[1:34:41] one day i'll just look at my hands and
[1:34:43] they're different one day i look at my
[1:34:45] feet and they're different
[1:34:47] i'm in a new body i've endured to the
[1:34:49] end and either endures to the end to be
[1:34:51] safe
[1:34:54] i say well does that make you fearful no
[1:34:56] it makes me confident
[1:34:59] it makes me determined to keep on going
[1:35:03] there's nothing before the time don't
[1:35:04] judge me before the time but let me go
[1:35:07] on
[1:35:07] i might fall and and have problems here
[1:35:10] and
[1:35:10] things that you know maybe maybe i just
[1:35:13] misconstrue something or get something
[1:35:15] wrong
[1:35:15] but i'm coming back up i'll get back up
[1:35:17] why i'm a son of god
[1:35:19] the old flesh will do a lot of things
[1:35:21] but i have faith that what he promised
[1:35:23] will come to pass
[1:35:25] and one day i can say i've endured to
[1:35:28] the end
[1:35:29] that which is perfect is come
[1:35:33] that which is perfect is coming i can
[1:35:35] say it's sweet
[1:35:36] to trust in jesus just to take him at
[1:35:39] his word it just meant so much to me
[1:35:42] that just
[1:35:43] just to rest on that promise say thus
[1:35:47] saith the lord to know
[1:35:48] thus saith the lord bow your heads with
[1:35:50] me
[1:35:52] i apologize i've dragged it out a little
[1:35:55] bit tonight but
[1:35:57] i know you're tired but i i believe the
[1:35:59] word of god can change us
[1:36:03] we need our life rewritten
[1:36:07] we needed the story of our life to be
[1:36:09] rewritten and mercy did that
[1:36:11] i'm so grateful for that but we keep
[1:36:13] changing
[1:36:14] we don't stop so i try to give us an
[1:36:18] opportunity every service if i can
[1:36:22] just take a moment reflect on the word
[1:36:23] and say lord change me
[1:36:26] change me make me different what i was i
[1:36:28] was a tadpole
[1:36:31] i've come i've got to decide something
[1:36:32] in me i can see that there's part of me
[1:36:34] that still wants
[1:36:35] that world that flesh it's on me but
[1:36:37] there's something inside of me
[1:36:39] it's changing i'm not going to rest on
[1:36:41] emotion i'm not going to rest on
[1:36:42] something that happened
[1:36:44] at one point although those things are
[1:36:45] wonderful but i'm going to rest on the
[1:36:47] word
[1:36:47] you say i'm saved lord you say i belong
[1:36:50] to you and so i believe that
[1:36:52] i believe that with all of my heart and
[1:36:54] my faith i'm going to walk forward
[1:36:55] i'm going to keep growing let that be
[1:36:57] your prayer tonight heavenly father
[1:37:00] i'm so grateful for your mercy and your
[1:37:01] love so grateful for your presence that
[1:37:04] we feel among us
[1:37:06] lord maybe there's one on streaming
[1:37:08] tonight that
[1:37:09] lord they've heard this and maybe they
[1:37:12] realize
[1:37:13] i'm a son of god i don't belong to the
[1:37:14] world i don't have to live this way
[1:37:17] anymore
[1:37:18] you just grant that to them lord they'd
[1:37:20] be able to be saved to be changed to be
[1:37:22] cleansed
[1:37:24] oh god for us that are here and for
[1:37:26] those that are watching that are saved
[1:37:28] born again i pray heavenly father that
[1:37:30] you'd help them
[1:37:31] pray that you'd help me lord we want to
[1:37:34] grow
[1:37:34] we don't want to ever stop growing help
[1:37:37] me never be contented lord
[1:37:39] lord as we we're trying to work and fix
[1:37:41] up things around the church and do
[1:37:43] everything we can may we be that way
[1:37:45] spiritually lord
[1:37:46] may we be restless when it comes to
[1:37:48] these things and always though we rest
[1:37:50] in your promise but when it comes to our
[1:37:52] works may we always
[1:37:53] look and see lord i can do this better i
[1:37:55] can move forward
[1:37:57] i can build up those fortifications even
[1:37:59] when i'm not on the battle let me build
[1:38:01] up the fortifications because i know
[1:38:03] a battle is coming let me gird up the
[1:38:05] loins of my mind
[1:38:07] let me grab hold and take every thought
[1:38:09] captive because it begins as a thought
[1:38:11] and then it becomes
[1:38:12] something that'll make me do something
[1:38:14] that i wish i hadn't done
[1:38:16] oh god let me let me follow you with all
[1:38:19] of my heart
[1:38:21] god with my family tonight lord what i

[1:38:29] would you help me to be a better light
[1:38:31] to my family
[1:38:33] or when i am at home if i'm if i'm not

[1:38:46] be close to you
[1:38:48] we want to walk right we want to do the
[1:38:50] things we should do
[1:38:51] or we know it's not about our works it's
[1:38:53] what you did for us you it was your
[1:38:55] mercy
[1:38:55] and it continues to be your mercy lord
[1:38:57] but you give us little opportunities to
[1:38:59] clean things up and
[1:39:00] wash our feet that have been dirty and
[1:39:03] dusty because of the world that we live
[1:39:05] in
[1:39:05] help us to do that tonight lord forgive
[1:39:08] us

[1:39:35] where you are there's a lot of noise
[1:39:38] but you're working silently that still
[1:39:40] small voice

[1:39:42] lord maybe us to make some noise
[1:39:45] because you're worthy say worthy is the
[1:39:48] lamb
[1:39:48] was sane before the foundation of the
[1:39:50] earth pray you'd grant it lord god
[1:39:53] we thank you for all that you've done
[1:39:55] what you continue to do in our lives
[1:39:57] let us not be discouraged lord but let
[1:39:59] us be encouraged
