[46:55] name
[46:56] amen
[46:58] and God bless you tonight let's turn to
[47:00] Romans 8 11. I'll just read that one
[47:03] scripture and then you can have your
[47:05] seeds I got several other scriptures
[47:08] that we'll read as we go along tonight
[47:10] it's good to be here tonight on a
[47:12] Wednesday night and see this nice crowd
[47:14] brother Phil sister Corrine good to have
[47:17] you here tonight it's always good to see
[47:19] you guys and I know they probably had
[47:21] quite a time putting all that stuff back
[47:24] in the church didn't they back home so
[47:26] it's good to have you tonight we really
[47:28] enjoyed the meetings in fact tonight as
[47:31] you're turning to Romans 8 11
[47:33] I'm going to begin with the scripture
[47:36] and and quote the same one brother Wayne
[47:39] Lawson preached from last Friday night
[47:42] at the tent meetings if you haven't
[47:43] heard that sermon I recommend that you
[47:45] go and listen to it I had already had
[47:47] this planned for the Wednesday we we let
[47:49] go so the Lord knows what he's doing
[47:51] doesn't he he really does and so we're
[47:54] grateful to to be a part of the body of
[47:56] Christ all around the world and we
[47:58] believe the same holy spirit is
[48:00] preaching in the preachers wherever
[48:02] they're at amen Romans 8 11 but if the
[48:05] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[48:08] the dead dwell in you
[48:10] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[48:13] also quickened your mortal bodies by his
[48:17] spirit that dwelleth in you I pray the
[48:21] Lord without his Blessing to the word
[48:22] you may be seated this evening
[48:28] after his introduction and it is the
[48:31] rising of the Sun as we've been going
[48:33] through that sermon and I recommend that
[48:34] you listen to it if you haven't done
[48:36] that already
[48:37] uh brother Branham goes to Leviticus and
[48:40] begins to show a type in the Old
[48:42] Testament and he shows that the Old
[48:44] Testament is a shadow of the New
[48:47] Testament it's a type of the New
[48:50] Testament in Leviticus 23 and 10 Moses
[48:53] says speak or God speaking to Moses
[48:55] speaking to the children of Israel and
[48:57] saying to them when you become into the
[48:59] land which I give unto you and brother
[49:01] Branham stops there and he says unto the
[49:04] place the position that I have given
[49:07] unto you unto the place the position
[49:10] that I have given unto you he said now
[49:12] you speak to the children of Israel that
[49:15] when you get to this certain place that
[49:18] I promised you I'd take you when you get
[49:21] there in this land now you might say
[49:23] well brother Ben where is that land is
[49:25] that land in in Indiana is that land in
[49:28] in Missouri it's hot land in Arkansas
[49:30] it's that land in Hardy it's that land
[49:33] in Louisiana no that land is in Christ
[49:36] and he's our spiritual land it's a
[49:39] spiritual land that we're talking about
[49:41] today so when you get to that land he
[49:44] said now speaking natural here typing
[49:47] the spiritual now we realize that this
[49:49] message that we have is a Deliverance
[49:52] message how many know that tonight it's
[49:54] a message of Deliverance of calling out
[49:56] a message of Exodus to come out from her
[50:00] my people and be not partaker of her
[50:02] plagues and I'm so glad that it is it
[50:04] brings us out of the world out of the
[50:07] church world out of denominationalism
[50:09] out of all of those things but we
[50:11] realize it is also a message of going in
[50:13] it's a message of placing it's a message
[50:16] of positioning and what I'm talking
[50:19] about tonight is not just positioning in
[50:21] a church but it's positioned in Christ
[50:24] because if you can ever get positioned
[50:26] in Christ you'll find yourself
[50:28] positioned in church body right but you
[50:32] you'll first got to find what your
[50:33] position is in Christ and so brother
[50:36] Branham dwells on that and I'm not going
[50:38] to get very much further and it is the
[50:40] rising of the sun tonight because I want
[50:42] us to dwell on this for a moment and see
[50:44] what this positioning message is and
[50:46] brother Branham taught us that Ephesians
[50:48] parallel Joshua how many know that in
[50:51] fact he preached a sermon I believe on
[50:52] that titled that Ephesians parallels
[50:55] Joshua Joshua placed Israel in the land
[50:58] he was the one who had the opportunity
[51:00] or was given the responsibility of
[51:03] taking the people and placing them
[51:05] giving them their land what belong to
[51:07] them not just corporately but
[51:09] individually that there was something
[51:11] that belonged to them and I would tell
[51:13] you tonight there's something that
[51:14] belongs to you and I as the Believers
[51:17] there's a very particular promise that
[51:19] we have that we can grab a hold of for
[51:22] our day and it's to us individually it's
[51:24] not just for the preacher it's not just
[51:26] for the Sunday school teacher not just
[51:28] for the deacons but for every one of us
[51:30] there's a promise given to us in the
[51:32] word of what we should be and how we
[51:34] should act and and what the blessing
[51:37] things that God's going to give us
[51:39] and those promises are found in the book
[51:41] of Ephesians and Ephesians 1 3 it says
[51:43] blessed be the God and father of our
[51:45] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[51:47] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[51:50] places in Christ now Branham taught that
[51:54] we were in Christ when he walked the
[51:56] Earth
[51:57] how many know that tonight I'm not going
[51:59] to bring all of these quotes tonight but
[52:01] just to remind you of things that you
[52:03] know and then we'll move to where we
[52:04] want to go but the word was made flesh
[52:07] and that means that you walked with him
[52:09] you suffered with him
[52:12] right you you died with him
[52:15] on the cross and he was buried with him
[52:19] and now you're risen with him
[52:21] right you can't have one without the
[52:23] other if you walked with him if you died
[52:25] with him then you're buried you buried
[52:27] with him then you're raised with him
[52:29] and that's what we're talking about the
[52:31] quickening power the same quickening
[52:33] power that he had at The Same Spirit
[52:35] brother Branham deals with that he said
[52:37] if that same spirit and that's the
[52:39] question if he dwells in you it will
[52:41] also Quicken your Immortal body
[52:43] so now he said you were buried with him
[52:46] you're risen with him you're the
[52:47] manifested attributes of God sitting in
[52:50] Heavenly places now
[52:52] how many believe that tonight that's
[52:54] nothing new for us is it we understand
[52:56] that we're already raised resurrected to
[53:00] New Life and sitting in Heavenly places
[53:02] in Christ Jesus now when we are in
[53:04] Heavenly places where are we placed we
[53:06] are placed together
[53:09] I want you to watch this tonight
[53:11] Ephesians 2 and 4 says but God who is
[53:14] rich in Mercy for his great love we're
[53:17] with he loved us aren't you glad that he
[53:19] loves you tonight even when we were dead
[53:22] in sins hath quickened us notice hath
[53:25] quickened us together with Christ by
[53:28] Grace you're saved and hath raised us up
[53:31] together now he's quickened us together
[53:33] with Christ but he's raised us all of us
[53:36] up together and made us sit together in
[53:41] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are
[53:45] seated together
[53:46] no not just not out anywhere brother
[53:49] Brandon says but in Heavenly places we
[53:52] are assembled in Heavenly it means the
[53:54] position of the believer he said that if
[53:57] I'm prayed up and you're prayed up he
[54:00] said or the church is prayed up he's now
[54:03] this is the land that we have today this
[54:06] is the rights that we have as a church
[54:08] if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up
[54:10] the church is prayed up and we're ready
[54:13] for the message and we have assembled
[54:15] ourselves together as Saints called out
[54:18] baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with
[54:21] God's blessings called elected set
[54:24] together in Heavenly places now he said
[54:26] we are heavenlies in our souls

[54:31] tonight you might have ate too much for
[54:33] dinner or not enough
[54:35] you might not feel very Heavenly you
[54:38] might have had some problems during your
[54:39] day you
[54:40] the boss and the boss didn't agree maybe
[54:43] the boss is you and you couldn't agree
[54:45] with yourself
[54:46] but you couldn't get along with yourself
[54:48] and then sometimes that's the case isn't
[54:50] it maybe you don't feel very Heavenly
[54:52] but we're not talking about the flesh
[54:54] but we're talking about the inner man
[54:56] when you're called when you're elected
[54:58] when you're prayed up what are you doing
[54:59] you're sitting in Heavenly places
[55:02] in Christ yes
[55:05] yes oh aren't you glad to have that
[55:06] position
[55:07] you have that position whether you're
[55:08] struggling with the kids
[55:10] whether you're worried about work or
[55:12] finances no matter what's going on in
[55:15] your life that position is yours but
[55:18] you've got to claim it
[55:19] right you've got to walk on it you've
[55:22] got to you've got to be there and so
[55:25] that's what that's what you want to do
[55:26] now he said it's called out baptized
[55:29] with the Holy Ghost filled with God's
[55:30] blessing heavenlies in our souls our
[55:32] Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly
[55:34] atmosphere he said oh brother there you

[55:40] what could happen tonight
[55:42] if we would be sitting here see it
[55:44] sitting here Church where are we at the
[55:46] Word of Life Tabernacle sitting in a
[55:48] building but where we seated in Heavenly
[55:50] places if you're the called the elected
[55:53] I believe that you are tonight I believe
[55:55] that's why you're here on a Wednesday
[55:56] night he said then when you're sitting
[55:58] here in a Heavenly atmosphere and the
[56:00] Holy Spirit is moving over every heart
[56:02] that's been regenerated and become a new
[56:04] creature in Christ Jesus all sins under
[56:08] the blood someone say all sin
[56:10] all sins under the blood in perfect
[56:13] worship
[56:15] perfect worship now it may not feel like
[56:18] perfect worship all the time the song
[56:20] leader may come out and sing the song
[56:22] Twice
[56:24] and sometimes brother Joel We may come
[56:26] out and sing off key or or seeing the
[56:29] wrong thing or it may not feel like
[56:30] perfect worship but that's not what he's
[56:32] talking about when you're seated in
[56:34] Heavenly places in Christ if you make a
[56:36] Joyful Noise
[56:38] come on church are you with me tonight
[56:40] being hard on David tonight but he would
[56:43] point it out on me too if I did that but
[56:46] you know what you know what happens is
[56:48] we're seated in Heavenly places and so
[56:50] our work our worship is perfect yeah
[56:53] right and that ought to take all the
[56:56] stress off of it
[56:57] and all the performance off of it it's
[57:00] not a performance it's perfect worship
[57:03] when when a a woman who's lost
[57:05] everything and can still bow at the feet
[57:08] of Jesus and say Lord I worship you not
[57:10] because of what I have because I don't
[57:12] have anything but because of who you are
[57:15] not because of what I'm well with all my
[57:17] blessings but in spite of everything
[57:18] that's going on I'm still worshiping
[57:21] worshiping you that's perfect worship
[57:24] perfect work so don't don't you want to
[57:26] worship that way
[57:28] hey man he said worshiping together
[57:31] and he said all sins under the blood
[57:33] worshiping with our hands up to God and
[57:36] our hearts lifted sitting in Heavenly
[57:39] places in Christ Jesus worshiping
[57:41] together in the Heavenly places he said
[57:43] did you ever sat in one oh I have set
[57:46] till I would Weep For Joy and say God
[57:48] never let me leave here just Heavenly
[57:51] places in Christ Jesus that's what
[57:54] church ought to be like not just church
[57:56] but that's what our worship at home
[57:58] ought to be like Lord don't let it ever
[58:00] let me leave your presence
[58:02] and seated together in Heavenly places
[58:04] he said brother man why then or some
[58:06] Churches dead and cold even those some
[58:09] who have the word that we believe and
[58:10] believe the same thing why are some
[58:12] Churches dead and cold it's because they
[58:15] don't realize that they're in Heavenly
[58:16] places they never come into that
[58:19] atmosphere because the promises are
[58:21] never preached they don't know who they
[58:23] are or what they own but I'm so glad
[58:25] tonight we know who we are and we know
[58:27] what we have and so we can sit together
[58:30] and worship God in spirit and a truth
[58:32] not because of what happens to us not
[58:35] because of what's going on on the
[58:37] outside but it's perfect worship because
[58:39] we're seated in Heavenly places in
[58:41] Christ
[58:42] and we recognize that
[58:45] oh it's so important to recognize that
[58:48] our souls are lifted up together
[58:51] by the word
[58:53] now brother random says after the church
[58:55] takes its position I'm going somewhere
[58:57] tonight so just hang with me he said
[58:59] we're called to the adoption of sons by
[59:01] the Holy Spirit and when each man takes
[59:04] his position what God has called him to
[59:07] do
[59:08] and stand to the end of the road
[59:11] going after the Lost
[59:13] Now watch how he ties that in there now
[59:15] he's talking about Abraham and lot
[59:16] there's a lot of people who say they're
[59:19] Abraham and say well I'm separated from
[59:21] all unbelief I'm Abraham but when lot
[59:24] Falls when lot goes gets taken captive
[59:27] do you have a heart to go after it
[59:29] because if not you're not fitting that
[59:32] type
[59:34] right in order to fit the type of
[59:36] Abraham of being separated from all
[59:37] unbelief you also have to fit the type
[59:39] of the Brother who goes after his
[59:41] brother who goes out and Homa goes out
[59:44] and gets his brother
[59:46] amen
[59:48] now brother Branham says that first and
[59:51] is continue with this quote now he said
[59:53] first Paul takes all the scare out of it
[59:57] all the scare out of it
[59:59] so now if you're called if you're not
[1:00:02] just worked up in your mind but some
[1:00:04] kind of theology if you're really born
[1:00:06] of the spirit then God predestinated you
[1:00:10] before the foundation of the world puts
[1:00:13] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:16] praise God he said and now we come
[1:00:18] together to sit in Heavenly places in
[1:00:20] Christ Jesus holy people a holy nation A
[1:00:23] peculiar people a royal priesthood
[1:00:25] offering spiritual sacrifices unto God
[1:00:28] he said that is the fruit of our lips
[1:00:30] giving praises to his name people come
[1:00:32] in and say them people are crazy sure
[1:00:34] they are the wisdom of God is foolish to
[1:00:37] man and the wisdom of man is foolish to
[1:00:39] God they're contrary one to the other he
[1:00:41] said but a real Spirit-filled church
[1:00:43] full of power of God sitting together in
[1:00:46] Heavenly places offering spiritual
[1:00:48] sacrifices Praises of God
[1:00:50] now watch we've kind of taken the idea
[1:00:53] that a Spirit-filled church that knew
[1:00:56] their position and another place could
[1:00:58] kind of set back
[1:00:59] and wouldn't be a church that would
[1:01:01] necessarily be Pentecostal in its
[1:01:03] worship
[1:01:04] but that's not what he's telling us
[1:01:07] that this church that reaches its
[1:01:09] position would actually when they were
[1:01:12] sitting together in Heavenly places they
[1:01:15] would actually offer spiritual
[1:01:16] sacrifices
[1:01:18] why it's Kings and Priests they know who
[1:01:21] they are yes
[1:01:22] amen if you don't know who you are
[1:01:25] you'll be waiting on somebody else to
[1:01:28] offer your sacrifice yes right many
[1:01:31] people are waiting on a preacher to
[1:01:32] offer a sacrifice of praise they're
[1:01:34] waiting on him on an evangelist to offer
[1:01:36] a sacrifice they're waiting on some
[1:01:38] person but that's not who you are you're
[1:01:40] a king you're a priest it's your job to
[1:01:43] go in and offer the sacrifice the fruit
[1:01:46] of your lips offering him praise he
[1:01:48] don't want to just hear my praise he
[1:01:50] don't want to just hear my voice he
[1:01:52] wants to hear yours
[1:01:54] are you with me tonight
[1:01:57] the Holy Spirit he said moving among
[1:02:00] them
[1:02:01] Discerning sin so that's part of it too
[1:02:04] calling out the things that's among them
[1:02:06] that's wrong so straightened out and
[1:02:09] making it flat and level
[1:02:11] he said because why always in the
[1:02:13] presence of God is that Bloody sacrifice
[1:02:16] so he brings it right back around we
[1:02:17] could not be in our position only in
[1:02:19] Christ
[1:02:21] now let's watch this again Leviticus 23
[1:02:24] 10 speaking of the children of Israel
[1:02:26] I'm saying to them when you be coming to
[1:02:28] the land which I give unto you
[1:02:30] now watch and shall reap the Harvest
[1:02:33] thereof
[1:02:34] then you shall bring a Sheaf of the
[1:02:36] first fruits of your Harvest unto the
[1:02:38] priest but the brown said and shall reap
[1:02:40] the harvesterof he said you have
[1:02:42] received what I told you thereof
[1:02:47] oh I love this
[1:02:49] what did he tell them he said it's a
[1:02:51] land flowing with milk and honey it's
[1:02:53] vivid language isn't it in other words
[1:02:56] it's a land that's got food in it
[1:02:58] it's got lots of food plenty of food
[1:03:01] that you're going to be able to eat of
[1:03:03] that food
[1:03:04] and gonna be full
[1:03:06] and so when they come into the land he
[1:03:08] said I want you to take the first fruits
[1:03:10] the very first seeds were planted in the
[1:03:13] land the very first crop that comes up
[1:03:15] he said I want you to take that and make
[1:03:17] it a wave Sheaf
[1:03:19] he said because he said you're going to
[1:03:21] reap the Harvest of the land when you
[1:03:24] come into the land it's going to be
[1:03:25] Harvest time you're going to reap the
[1:03:27] Harvest of the land and the very first
[1:03:28] ones that come up that come to full
[1:03:30] maturity he said I want you to take that
[1:03:32] and wave it before the Lord
[1:03:34] now he said when you come in that means
[1:03:37] you've received what I told you so God
[1:03:39] said it's a good land he said there's a
[1:03:41] crop there he said there'll be something
[1:03:43] to eat
[1:03:44] right they get over there they find
[1:03:46] there's something to eat
[1:03:48] there's crops in the fields they come in
[1:03:49] at Harvest Time
[1:03:52] crossed over when they get to the place
[1:03:54] where he told them to go
[1:03:56] glory to God when you recognize who you
[1:03:59] are you're a son or daughter of God see
[1:04:01] that's not the end of it right
[1:04:03] just recognizing it's not an end in
[1:04:05] itself
[1:04:06] right but there's something that we have
[1:04:08] to do when we get there
[1:04:10] what are we going to do we're going to
[1:04:12] manifest the word we're going to see and
[1:04:14] we're going to reap the Harvest
[1:04:16] of the land so the word that was spoken
[1:04:18] to them now they see the manifestation
[1:04:21] of that word
[1:04:23] Joshua 5 and 11 tells us that when they
[1:04:26] come into the land they did eat of the
[1:04:27] old corn of the Lamb that word old corn
[1:04:29] just means the uh the produce they did
[1:04:33] eat what the land produced
[1:04:35] of the land on the morrow after the
[1:04:37] Passover unleavened cakes and parched
[1:04:39] corn in the South same day
[1:04:42] and the man of cease on the morrow after
[1:04:44] they had eaten of the old corn of the
[1:04:46] land neither had the children of Israel
[1:04:48] Manna anymore but they did eat of the
[1:04:50] fruit of the land of Canaan that year so
[1:04:53] they come in now they're seeing the
[1:04:55] fruit or the manifestation of what God
[1:04:58] told them don't miss this tonight Church
[1:05:00] I don't know whether I need to slow it
[1:05:02] down or speed it up but we don't need to
[1:05:03] miss this the manifestation of the
[1:05:06] promise comes to its maturity
[1:05:09] and right there is what the devil wants
[1:05:11] to steal away from you take away the
[1:05:12] increase take away the manifestation
[1:05:14] take away because you are a child of God
[1:05:17] you are a son or daughter of God but the
[1:05:19] devil's trying to take away that
[1:05:20] manifestation out of your life he's
[1:05:23] trying to get you to not believe it but
[1:05:25] if God kept his word and we see the
[1:05:27] fruit of the Lamb we might as well eat
[1:05:29] of it and and plant some more right
[1:05:32] right good
[1:05:34] so the manifestation of the promise
[1:05:36] comes to its maturity now
[1:05:40] hang with me for just a moment we're
[1:05:42] we're the bride how many know we're the
[1:05:43] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:46] but the bride you know at one time was a
[1:05:49] child a baby
[1:05:51] there was a there was a bride who was a
[1:05:53] baby
[1:05:54] my wife was not always uh Mrs Benjamin
[1:05:58] Pruitt she was a baby
[1:06:00] she had to grow up before I could marry
[1:06:02] her most of the way anyway
[1:06:05] so
[1:06:09] don't laugh Gabe you had to grow up most
[1:06:10] of the way too
[1:06:16] so so now we come to a she comes to a
[1:06:20] maturity in order to begin to manifest
[1:06:22] what was always in her
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:26] oh God now brother Branham said that
[1:06:28] when Christ was born he talks about how
[1:06:31] there's three stars that went together
[1:06:33] and he calls that the Trinity of God in
[1:06:35] one person becoming one God three and
[1:06:38] three becoming one the three offices of
[1:06:40] God becoming one office he said when the
[1:06:42] little baby Christ was born three stars
[1:06:44] went together and made one morning star
[1:06:47] that reflected the coming of an infant
[1:06:49] Christ a perfect one
[1:06:52] so now he was not the fullness in the
[1:06:55] sense that he was not mature at that
[1:06:58] time and yet all that he ever would be
[1:07:00] he was Jehovah crying in the manger
[1:07:05] all that would ever heal the sick all
[1:07:08] that would ever speak the word he
[1:07:10] couldn't even talk yeah
[1:07:13] right if you'd have went up to Jesus at
[1:07:15] that time and said Jesus heal me
[1:07:17] Jesus saved me
[1:07:19] Jesus lay your hands on me
[1:07:22] he never healed any sick
[1:07:24] he cried he nursed from his mother
[1:07:28] right he grew up like anybody else did
[1:07:32] and so but there's a word that spoke
[1:07:35] about him
[1:07:36] but now he had not reached the maturity
[1:07:39] of that word
[1:07:42] now we come through that in the message
[1:07:44] of the hour
[1:07:45] that actually there's a word that spoke
[1:07:48] of a mature bride that was speaking to a
[1:07:50] bride that was not mature
[1:07:53] that had just been born but it was
[1:07:55] speaking of something in the future and
[1:07:57] I believe that's the time we're living
[1:07:58] in right now
[1:07:59] so brother Branham talks about that and
[1:08:01] he talks about how the on the news at
[1:08:03] that time there was five stars he said
[1:08:05] that we're in line with the Earth
[1:08:07] and he said what's five he said a number
[1:08:09] of Grace he said every time those stars
[1:08:12] come then something happens on Earth
[1:08:13] what taken place five stars fell in what
[1:08:15] was it an introducing of what and he
[1:08:18] talks about earthquakes and floods and
[1:08:20] things that have taken place during that
[1:08:22] time he said what's happened an infant
[1:08:24] Church
[1:08:25] he said Hallelujah a bride infancy that
[1:08:29] the power of God has begun to fall on
[1:08:31] her
[1:08:33] now now again she's still the bride
[1:08:35] but it's in infancy
[1:08:37] she's taking form a bride for this
[1:08:40] bridegroom
[1:08:42] he said what happened now he said it's
[1:08:44] the Church of the Living God coming
[1:08:46] together under the word of God and the
[1:08:49] astronomic heaven is announcing her
[1:08:52] approach
[1:08:53] he said friends the church is coming
[1:08:55] forth God is going to have a church
[1:08:58] without spot or wrinkle and she is
[1:09:01] predestinated God said so he would have
[1:09:04] it he said that makes it right who is a
[1:09:07] member I don't know I'm trusting to be
[1:09:08] myself I'm trusting you're a member but
[1:09:11] he's going to have a body without spot a
[1:09:13] wrinkle he said as God in his word made
[1:09:15] manifest in a man a perfect man so is
[1:09:18] God and His word coming again
[1:09:22] I love this making himself manifested in
[1:09:25] a bride
[1:09:27] not will do like Eve did hybrid it to
[1:09:30] something else in other words she's not
[1:09:32] going to change it because she is the
[1:09:34] the bride for this perfect groom
[1:09:37] right but eve took it and took a part of
[1:09:40] the word but didn't take all of it it
[1:09:42] was hybrid you understanding what she
[1:09:44] produced was a cane and an Abel but this
[1:09:48] bride won't produce a cane
[1:09:49] she'll produce the full word of God
[1:09:52] so he said but the unadulterated word of
[1:09:55] God will be born into that church and
[1:09:58] she will stand like Jesus Christ did
[1:10:00] with his Spirit anointing in his word
[1:10:04] he said amen I believe it's the
[1:10:06] announcement now
[1:10:08] the announcement
[1:10:10] God was it was like he was sending out
[1:10:12] cards
[1:10:14] said it's a girl
[1:10:18] think about it's a girl
[1:10:20] and she's already in the mind of God the
[1:10:23] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] but she's in her infancy now how is the
[1:10:27] Bride of that time in her infancy well
[1:10:29] she hadn't grown fully into the word
[1:10:31] because you'll find that what brother
[1:10:33] random was preaching and what they
[1:10:35] understood and what they could manifest
[1:10:36] was very far apart
[1:10:39] right but it's getting closer yeah
[1:10:43] yeah I hope you see this tonight it's
[1:10:45] not getting farther apart there are
[1:10:47] people who will tell you that the bride
[1:10:49] was at its best then and it's getting
[1:10:52] closer or farther and farther away but
[1:10:54] how could that be
[1:10:56] whoever the bride is I believe I'm one
[1:10:59] of them do you believe that tonight
[1:11:00] whoever the bride is it's not getting
[1:11:02] worse it's getting better
[1:11:05] it's growing up yeah
[1:11:07] oh my
[1:11:09] now watch he said that won't do like he
[1:11:12] did but she will stand like Jesus Christ
[1:11:14] did he said I believe it's the
[1:11:15] announcement now he said in the same son
[1:11:17] that rises in the East is the same son
[1:11:18] that sets from the West the same sun and
[1:11:21] the same Son of God that comes to the
[1:11:22] Earth to take a bride on the Eastern
[1:11:24] people that bride polluted herself like
[1:11:26] Eve did like Jehovah's bride did the
[1:11:28] same Sun that shines there listen that
[1:11:31] shine there with his same power upon
[1:11:33] Pentecost to ripen the seed that he had
[1:11:35] planted that same Sun
[1:11:38] is shining now in the Western Hemisphere
[1:11:42] oh God to what ripen the seed that has
[1:11:46] been planted to bring forth a bride
[1:11:50] oh God the evening light of the Gospel
[1:11:53] will bring forth the bride you say what
[1:11:55] what what kind of what kind of evening
[1:11:57] light Zechariah 14 7 in the evening time
[1:12:00] it'll be light a light that day it'll be
[1:12:02] neither day or night but in the evening
[1:12:03] time
[1:12:04] he said now when truth comes forth he
[1:12:07] said what's happened now watch how he
[1:12:09] takes this
[1:12:10] he says not to shuck but the life goes
[1:12:13] right out from the shut right into the
[1:12:14] grain the real true life I want you to
[1:12:16] watch because brother Branham is seeing
[1:12:18] something now if you go back to 1963
[1:12:20] brother Brandon preaches the token
[1:12:22] and you'll find when he preaches in 1965
[1:12:25] it is the rising of the son he's
[1:12:26] preaching the same thing
[1:12:29] now think about it for a minute he's
[1:12:30] preaching the same thing you need the
[1:12:32] mechanics or you have the mechanics but
[1:12:34] you need the Dynamics
[1:12:36] you need the spirit to anoint the word
[1:12:39] that you have
[1:12:43] in order to come to that maturity he saw
[1:12:45] they were not in that mature place they
[1:12:48] were not in that ripened condition yeah
[1:12:50] and so he said you need something
[1:12:53] and what did he think they needed even
[1:12:55] at that time they knew far more than
[1:12:58] what the Pentecostals do they had far
[1:13:01] more Revelation than what the
[1:13:02] Pentecostal Church of the Baptist Church
[1:13:04] and yet they didn't know I don't think
[1:13:06] what we do today because there's been so
[1:13:08] much light not new light but the same
[1:13:10] thing that brother Brandon preached has
[1:13:12] been priests and we see it now in a way
[1:13:14] maybe that they didn't thin but even
[1:13:16] then they weren't walking even in all
[1:13:18] that they knew
[1:13:19] and I'm not condemning that generation
[1:13:21] but some of you lived back then and you
[1:13:23] know it was very simple it was very
[1:13:25] Elementary and brother Brown was telling
[1:13:27] him he's seeing a need among those
[1:13:29] people that have become the message
[1:13:31] people today yeah right you're seeing a
[1:13:34] need among those people he's saying you
[1:13:36] need to mature yeah yeah you need to
[1:13:38] grow up
[1:13:40] oh my
[1:13:41] you need to ripen
[1:13:43] so now he says the life goes right out
[1:13:45] from the truck right into the grain the
[1:13:47] real true life
[1:13:48] he said the organization stands there
[1:13:50] and dies just like it is done in every
[1:13:52] age it does the same he said you come
[1:13:54] out of that 50 years ago and went right
[1:13:55] back into it again now what I'm doing
[1:13:57] tonight is I'm laying a groundwork for
[1:13:59] this teaching on the wave Chief because
[1:14:01] brother Brandon's going to talk about it
[1:14:02] there's got to be a bride there's got to
[1:14:05] be a bride who comes back as wave loaves
[1:14:08] had Bread on his table
[1:14:11] and who's going to do that I I pray it's
[1:14:14] my generation
[1:14:15] somebody's got to do it but we've been
[1:14:18] maturing from that time till now
[1:14:21] right to come back in that in that form
[1:14:23] now watch he said the organization
[1:14:25] stands there and dies he said come out
[1:14:27] 50 years ago went right back into it
[1:14:29] again but real life follows the grain
[1:14:31] we're at the end time Brethren he says
[1:14:34] what did it pull away for so that it
[1:14:36] would bring the Grain in the presence of
[1:14:38] the Sun
[1:14:40] oh my see when they're shut on the corn
[1:14:43] it can't ripen to its fullest extent
[1:14:47] yeah yeah it can't come to its full
[1:14:49] maturity so what has to happen is the
[1:14:51] shot gets dry and it gets so dry it
[1:14:54] begins to crack and pull away
[1:14:56] and when it gets so dry and begins to
[1:14:58] crack and pull away the sun can reach
[1:15:00] the grain yeah
[1:15:01] yeah and once this oh my when
[1:15:03] everything's green the sun is protected
[1:15:06] from the Sun but now that it's now that
[1:15:09] everything's dry it the sun can finally
[1:15:11] reach the grain to bring it to its full
[1:15:13] maturity he said what did it pull away
[1:15:16] for
[1:15:16] so that it would bring the Grain in the
[1:15:18] presence of the sun to ripen the grain
[1:15:20] to a golden ripen for the master
[1:15:23] why has it pulled away
[1:15:25] now watch
[1:15:27] you think back
[1:15:28] some of you have been around for a while
[1:15:29] I've been around for a while but not
[1:15:31] nearly as long as some of you
[1:15:35] some of you have seen a lot happen
[1:15:39] you've seen the older generation come
[1:15:41] and go and maybe you are the older
[1:15:43] generation but many that you walk with
[1:15:44] don't walk no more
[1:15:46] with the word
[1:15:48] many fell off
[1:15:50] many fell away many if you come out of
[1:15:53] Pentecost perhaps there'll be a few here
[1:15:55] that would have most of us come right
[1:15:57] out of the message or out of the world
[1:15:58] but if you come out of Pentecost you you
[1:16:01] come out through that and you saw they
[1:16:03] didn't see what you saw right
[1:16:05] and so they they pulled back they pulled
[1:16:08] away they can't take the heat of it
[1:16:11] and that's why they say well it's a cult
[1:16:13] it's some kind of a and they try to
[1:16:15] point to everything that's going on but
[1:16:16] really it's just a shut pulling away
[1:16:19] right they can't reach the place that
[1:16:21] you've reached it wasn't meant for them
[1:16:23] big brother Brown said they were a good
[1:16:25] Chuck
[1:16:26] but it wasn't meant for them to reach
[1:16:28] that place of maturity
[1:16:29] it was meant for us
[1:16:32] amen he said so why is it pulled away he
[1:16:35] said so it causes heartaches
[1:16:38] tears
[1:16:42] the wheat never pulls away from the
[1:16:45] shuck
[1:16:46] are you hearing me the wheat the corn
[1:16:49] the grain never pulls away from the
[1:16:51] shuck or the husk it's the husk that
[1:16:55] pulls away
[1:16:57] right so if anybody's pulling away you
[1:16:59] got to watch that right
[1:17:00] because the wheat don't pull away
[1:17:03] the husk pulls away he said so it causes
[1:17:06] heartaches tears
[1:17:08] that they don't lay before the sun
[1:17:10] he said they don't lay before they s-u-n
[1:17:12] but the s-o-n to be ripened to the Full
[1:17:15] Gospel now watch to manifest everything
[1:17:17] that Jesus Christ promised in the Bible
[1:17:21] so watch brother branham's definition
[1:17:22] because this is one of those things that
[1:17:25] we've talked about before I think we
[1:17:26] misunderstood what does it mean to be
[1:17:29] ripe
[1:17:31] and I say we maybe some of you
[1:17:33] understood it perfectly but I'll say me
[1:17:36] I could preach a whole series of sermon
[1:17:38] things I've misunderstood
[1:17:41] maybe we all could
[1:17:43] yeah
[1:17:44] what does it mean to be ripe because a
[1:17:47] lot of people took that to mean well all
[1:17:49] the greenness or the Pentecostalism was
[1:17:52] baked out of us
[1:17:53] and so now we just sit in church with
[1:17:55] our arms folded bless God I'm ripe
[1:17:58] huh
[1:18:04] but look at brother Brown's definition
[1:18:06] and I'm going to read a couple of quotes
[1:18:07] here before I close in just a moment
[1:18:09] several to just show you what brother
[1:18:11] random's definition of ripening was he
[1:18:14] said it's to manifest if everything if
[1:18:15] you're writing it down write that down
[1:18:16] manifest everything that Jesus Christ
[1:18:19] promised in the Bible
[1:18:21] he said there's raising up a body today
[1:18:24] among the people and there will be no
[1:18:27] more organizations it goes right down
[1:18:29] into rich laodicea
[1:18:31] again he says that was in 1964 in
[1:18:34] December again he says I believe we have
[1:18:36] truth I'm satisfied of that
[1:18:39] and again brother random is watching
[1:18:41] this church in 1963 begins to preach the
[1:18:44] token he begins to preach in the rising
[1:18:46] of the sun it begins to reaches your
[1:18:47] life worthy of the Gospel it begins to
[1:18:49] preach sermons like that because he's
[1:18:51] trying to pull these message people yeah
[1:18:54] yeah right he's not just preaching to
[1:18:55] denominational people anymore but he's
[1:18:57] preaching to people who say they believe
[1:18:59] in a prophet they believe a message
[1:19:02] and he's saying you you need to ripen
[1:19:04] you need to come up higher
[1:19:06] now watch what he's saying he said I
[1:19:08] believe we have truth I'm satisfied of
[1:19:10] that I believe the wheat is absolutely
[1:19:12] the shark is pulling away from it you
[1:19:14] know he said but the wheat has to lay in
[1:19:17] the presence of the sun to ripen and
[1:19:19] that's what we're here for friend stay
[1:19:21] in the presence of the sun now watch his
[1:19:24] definition again till our little group
[1:19:26] of people here till it becomes so right
[1:19:29] to Christ
[1:19:31] it becomes Bread on his table
[1:19:34] oh it's so beautiful
[1:19:35] it comes red oh Lord I want to be bred
[1:19:38] on your table yes
[1:19:42] now again people are saying well if
[1:19:45] we're laying in the presence of the sun
[1:19:46] it just means we'll be dead
[1:19:49] well that's not what it means at all the
[1:19:51] only life there is is in the grain
[1:19:55] right that everything else is dead
[1:19:57] the only life that's left is in the
[1:19:59] grain
[1:20:00] what what what's happening is actually
[1:20:03] that if you lay in the presence of the
[1:20:05] Sun and you're dead completely it means
[1:20:08] you died before you had a mature crop
[1:20:10] you didn't come fully into the
[1:20:12] manifestation of what the seed ought to
[1:20:14] be
[1:20:15] now the seed doesn't look if the seed
[1:20:17] doesn't look like what went into the
[1:20:19] ground it's not a met fully manifested
[1:20:21] seed it's got to manifest itself and be
[1:20:24] proved by being waived over the people
[1:20:26] now watch the Pentecost will only but
[1:20:29] remember said Pentecost will only
[1:20:30] shelter the message give it an open door
[1:20:33] until it gets scattered he said and then
[1:20:35] the shuck will pull away and the wheat
[1:20:37] will lay in the presence of the sun see
[1:20:39] to ripen he said there won't be any
[1:20:41] denomination just remember there's never
[1:20:44] been a Revival but about three years
[1:20:45] after the Revival started they started a
[1:20:47] denomination on it and this last great
[1:20:49] miracle move of God in this last days he
[1:20:52] said this went 20 years it's a million
[1:20:54] miles from a denomination going further
[1:20:57] away all the time
[1:20:58] huh now watch he's talking about
[1:21:01] somebody getting better not getting
[1:21:02] worse
[1:21:03] farther away from denomination not going
[1:21:06] into it
[1:21:07] that bride has to be on the Earth
[1:21:09] it's got to be why don't we want to
[1:21:11] strive to be that
[1:21:13] right right
[1:21:14] so we're not preaching Doom and Gloom
[1:21:16] and saying well you know we're just
[1:21:18] surprised it's just hanging on by the
[1:21:20] skin of our teeth somebody is growing up
[1:21:22] somebody's becoming the weed again
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:27] he said a million miles from a
[1:21:29] denomination going further all the way
[1:21:32] all the time the Shucks pulling away no
[1:21:33] cooperation nothing with it again the
[1:21:36] shuck is the one with no cooperation
[1:21:38] always it pulls away from it there can't
[1:21:41] be no more it's a wheat now
[1:21:43] but we're plenty green
[1:21:46] look he's looking out the people he's
[1:21:48] preaching to we're plenty green
[1:21:50] yeah
[1:21:52] I think that's why there was so many
[1:21:53] splits
[1:21:56] so much division
[1:21:58] we were plenty green
[1:21:59] it's time to be mature
[1:22:03] yeah
[1:22:04] we were plenty green so we misunderstood
[1:22:06] a lot
[1:22:07] but we've been given a whole message
[1:22:09] that we can look at now we can see every
[1:22:12] we can see it we can search it we can
[1:22:14] preach it we can know what he said it's
[1:22:17] time to be mature
[1:22:19] foreign
[1:22:21] fighting anymore
[1:22:22] it's time to be my church time to raise
[1:22:24] Godly families it's time to have Christ
[1:22:27] in our homes it's time to have Christ in
[1:22:29] the church it's time to give him the
[1:22:31] preeminence
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:35] he said we're plenty green
[1:22:37] he said we have to lay in the presence
[1:22:39] of the sun to be mellowed up now here
[1:22:40] here's his definition of it
[1:22:43] he said that's all of it plenty green we
[1:22:46] haven't got the sincerity
[1:22:49] the sacredness
[1:22:52] oh God
[1:22:53] now remember before brother Branham
[1:22:55] could reach a maturity in his own life
[1:22:56] remember what the angel told him you
[1:22:58] must be more sincere
[1:23:01] what about us Church yes
[1:23:05] I know sometimes I push and I push and I
[1:23:07] but it and I don't mean to push you over
[1:23:10] I want you to know who you are you're
[1:23:11] children of God I I can't make you not a
[1:23:13] Christian I can't do that but I want to
[1:23:16] see a maturity I want to see it in my
[1:23:18] own life I want to see in my own family
[1:23:21] I want to see a maturity I want to see a
[1:23:23] sacredness
[1:23:25] yes I want to see a worship
[1:23:27] right I want to see something a life and
[1:23:29] also a worship not not the shouting
[1:23:32] without the ability to live but but
[1:23:34] having both and and the ability to
[1:23:37] worship but also the ability to live a
[1:23:39] sincerity of sacredness
[1:23:41] he said the thing we ought to have in
[1:23:43] our midst to know that the spirit of the
[1:23:46] Living God this is how brother random
[1:23:48] defined ripeness
[1:23:50] to know that the spirit of the Living
[1:23:52] God moving in his word and showing us
[1:23:56] the things yet
[1:23:59] again that was in 1965 and trying to do
[1:24:02] God of service without it being God's
[1:24:03] will brother random doesn't talk about
[1:24:05] this before 1964. by the way
[1:24:08] he said again he said think how long
[1:24:10] this has been going on 20 something
[1:24:12] years and no organization
[1:24:14] why it's the seed coming forming under
[1:24:16] the husk like this he said laying out he
[1:24:20] said now it's got to lay in the presence
[1:24:21] of the sun to ripen into the Glorious
[1:24:25] grain
[1:24:26] glorious crane I love that like the one
[1:24:30] again this is Brother Brandon's
[1:24:31] definition of ripeness to come like the
[1:24:34] one that went down
[1:24:36] yeah
[1:24:37] like the one that went into the first
[1:24:40] the real church that went down first is
[1:24:43] coming right back up through the stalk
[1:24:45] to come out another church when the
[1:24:47] combine comes to pick it up yeah he
[1:24:50] didn't say it come out a bunch of people
[1:24:51] pulled off to themselves and sitting and
[1:24:53] listened to a tape that's not what he
[1:24:54] said he said come out another church
[1:24:59] I can only say what the Bible says what
[1:25:00] the prophet said
[1:25:02] he said when the combine comes to pick
[1:25:04] it up he said the life that went down in
[1:25:05] Luther are you still with me tonight I
[1:25:07] hope I'm not boring you but this is what
[1:25:09] we want we want the truth we want the
[1:25:12] life we want the sincerity we want the
[1:25:14] sacredness we want something that'll
[1:25:16] change us something that will change our
[1:25:18] families something that'll that'll
[1:25:20] change our homes something that's real
[1:25:22] not just something we say we have but
[1:25:24] something we possess
[1:25:27] amen he says the life that went down and
[1:25:30] Luther the life that went down in meth
[1:25:32] in Methodist the life that went down in
[1:25:34] the Pentecostal will come into the grain
[1:25:37] he said it'll all go right into the
[1:25:39] Grain and go out forming the perfect
[1:25:42] body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:45] oh my
[1:25:47] again
[1:25:48] I'm just reading because I'm trying to
[1:25:50] stay with my notes so I can finish on
[1:25:51] time tonight I'm almost done
[1:25:53] he said the thing that's the matter with
[1:25:55] the message today
[1:25:57] yeah now look the prophet can see
[1:26:00] right he's looking at the people
[1:26:03] and he said the thing that's the matter
[1:26:04] with the message today
[1:26:06] is those who obtain it in their hearts
[1:26:09] must lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:26:11] get ripened
[1:26:13] he said you can pick up the message and
[1:26:14] then let the sun bake all the greenness
[1:26:17] out of you see making
[1:26:19] matured Christians
[1:26:22] he said see what I mean God is coming
[1:26:24] soon to receive his church and we must
[1:26:26] have that type of Christians for him to
[1:26:29] receive the wheat has got to get ripe
[1:26:33] again he says I believe the church is
[1:26:35] beginning to hear the message yeah
[1:26:37] and beginning to understand
[1:26:39] begin to understand but friends listen
[1:26:42] we've got to lay in the presence of the
[1:26:44] sun we've got to be ripened now watch is
[1:26:47] definition of right our faith isn't
[1:26:50] right
[1:26:51] yeah oh my our faith isn't ripe
[1:26:55] intellectually we're hearing the message
[1:26:58] oh God that God has given us and seeing
[1:27:02] the signs that he showed us and proving
[1:27:04] it by the Bible it's there but oh how
[1:27:06] the church needs to lay in his presence
[1:27:09] again you want to hear Brother Brown's
[1:27:11] definition of a ripe church till it
[1:27:14] tenders up
[1:27:16] oh God
[1:27:18] oh God don't let me have a hard heart
[1:27:20] don't let me have a hard Spirit don't
[1:27:23] let me become a thorn in the desert Let
[1:27:25] Me Tender up that's a prophet's
[1:27:27] definition of being ripened is not to
[1:27:29] become harder not to become drier but to
[1:27:32] get tendered up yeah
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:35] get tendered up oh God they get tendered
[1:27:39] up
[1:27:41] he said he said we're he said we're
[1:27:44] going to lay in the presence of the sun
[1:27:45] until it tenders up you know and gets
[1:27:48] sweet in the spirit
[1:27:50] so that it can bathe down
[1:27:54] oh my
[1:27:55] God oh my he said sometimes
[1:27:58] I love this
[1:28:00] now you remember the way it was some of
[1:28:01] you remember
[1:28:02] when you first come in I remember when I
[1:28:04] first started preaching well you saw
[1:28:06] something that happened you know some
[1:28:08] little thing in the church some little
[1:28:09] dress code violation or something boy
[1:28:11] you hammered it
[1:28:13] huh
[1:28:15] because you wanted to be like a prophet
[1:28:17] but watch what brother Brandon says
[1:28:19] sometimes in speaking the message you
[1:28:21] get harsh
[1:28:22] have to break it in like that now
[1:28:25] there's times we still have to do that
[1:28:27] you understand because everybody's in
[1:28:28] their own Journey
[1:28:29] but watch how the tenor of it changes as
[1:28:32] a whole look he said you have to break
[1:28:34] it in like that because you've got to
[1:28:35] clench a nail to make it hold but when
[1:28:37] the church once gets it yeah
[1:28:40] Glory
[1:28:42] he said the elected is called out and
[1:28:44] separated
[1:28:45] I've been in the presence of God
[1:28:48] he said I know it'll be something now
[1:28:51] here's brother branham's definition of
[1:28:53] ripeness again
[1:28:55] of ripening under the sun he said I know
[1:28:57] it'll be something when it gets it he
[1:28:59] said I know it'll be something like the
[1:29:01] people was there when it takes the
[1:29:04] Rapture Now where's he talking about
[1:29:05] he's talking about those he saw beyond
[1:29:07] the curtain of time he said only perfect
[1:29:09] love could enter there
[1:29:11] yes oh God it'll be something like the
[1:29:15] people was there
[1:29:17] when it takes its rapture
[1:29:19] and he said all that was there
[1:29:22] was perfect love
[1:29:24] all the virtues
[1:29:27] all the spiritual gifts now watch
[1:29:30] they were all there
[1:29:32] in the message of the hour
[1:29:34] but they had to come to maturity all of
[1:29:37] the Seven Virtues all the nine spiritual
[1:29:39] gifts all the fruits of the spirit
[1:29:41] everything that was promised all the
[1:29:43] promises of God they were laying in the
[1:29:45] message of the hour
[1:29:47] they were laying in the scriptures the
[1:29:49] light Shone on them by the message of
[1:29:50] the hour are you hearing me tonight but
[1:29:52] they had to come to maturity
[1:29:55] and each and every one of us has got to
[1:29:57] reach that place of maturity
[1:29:59] and somehow God speeds up the process in
[1:30:02] this end time so that we can reach it
[1:30:05] because we're very close to the end and
[1:30:07] then we go home it's got to serve Us
[1:30:10] full purpose because they without us
[1:30:11] cannot be made perfect so there's got to
[1:30:13] be a bride at the end time that comes to
[1:30:16] that full maturity
[1:30:17] oh God and it doesn't mean again it
[1:30:20] doesn't mean a Perfection because we're
[1:30:21] already Perfect by the blood we never
[1:30:23] did it in the first place
[1:30:25] we they were perfect then brother random
[1:30:27] spoke to them and said you are The
[1:30:29] Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:31] but it was an infant
[1:30:33] but now she's I believe we've grown up
[1:30:37] we need to grow up
[1:30:39] if we haven't grown up we need to grow
[1:30:41] up
[1:30:41] but what's the purpose of it now watch
[1:30:43] I'm closing with this musicians go ahead
[1:30:46] and come
[1:30:47] right on 45 minutes praise God
[1:30:51] I think I had that set on 45 minutes
[1:30:56] what's going to happen
[1:30:59] 23-11.
[1:31:00] he says here you when you come in he
[1:31:03] said there'll be a harvest you come into
[1:31:04] the place come into the position there's
[1:31:07] going to be a harvest there's going to
[1:31:09] be fruit there it's going to be wheat
[1:31:11] there he said I want you to cut it down
[1:31:14] I want you to harvest it I want you to
[1:31:17] take advantage of it I want you to
[1:31:19] listen to it
[1:31:20] and he said he shall wave the sheath
[1:31:23] before the Lord
[1:31:25] to be accepted for you
[1:31:27] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[1:31:29] priest shall wave it now brother Branham
[1:31:32] taught us that that happened and I'll
[1:31:33] just get barely into this and then we'll
[1:31:35] we'll close but brother Branham taught
[1:31:37] us that that happened with Christ when
[1:31:39] he raised from the dead how many believe
[1:31:40] that
[1:31:41] he said it happened again on the day of
[1:31:43] Pentecost
[1:31:44] which Pentecost actually would be the
[1:31:46] way of loath but brother Brown said that
[1:31:48] sheep was waived again and he said in
[1:31:50] the Holy Spirit he said and It produced
[1:31:53] a a mature Church
[1:31:55] right he said he'd come to its maturity
[1:31:58] so now it happened he said then he said
[1:32:01] but it has to happen again through the
[1:32:03] revealing of the son of man
[1:32:05] and it happened
[1:32:07] oh God hope we recognize you say brother
[1:32:10] Ben I won't ever come to this maturity
[1:32:12] don't say that
[1:32:14] because the crop has already been
[1:32:15] accepted
[1:32:21] oh god well he said it would be accepted
[1:32:24] for you
[1:32:25] Christ was accepted for you and in this
[1:32:27] day not a man
[1:32:29] right not a man but Christ in working in
[1:32:31] a Ministry working in the message of the
[1:32:33] hour Christ working in William Branham
[1:32:35] if we could say it that way but it was
[1:32:37] not the man it was the message but the
[1:32:40] brother said the message was the wave
[1:32:42] chief and the message oh God was
[1:32:45] accepted for you
[1:32:47] now when we used to run crops we used to
[1:32:50] go and run combines across the field and
[1:32:53] uh sorry I'm making you stand up there
[1:32:54] with Alan but I got to tell this
[1:32:56] we were we we used to haul our produce
[1:32:59] our grain to the market in an old 1970s
[1:33:03] for or 1980s Ford truck
[1:33:06] in the bed of a truck we'd line it with
[1:33:08] feed sacks that's how poor we were as
[1:33:10] Farmers we didn't have all these fancy
[1:33:12] trucks we just used the pickup truck and
[1:33:14] I remember we'd haul it up there and
[1:33:16] Grandpa's crops always had a problem he
[1:33:18] had he was lit he farmed in the wetlands
[1:33:20] and it was always the problem that they
[1:33:23] had moisture in them and so he was
[1:33:25] always going up there and what they
[1:33:26] would do is they would take a sample now
[1:33:28] they didn't test every grain
[1:33:30] in the truck
[1:33:32] but when Grandpa went up to the to the
[1:33:34] feed place where he sold the the seed
[1:33:37] the grain he would go up to the Silo and
[1:33:40] they would they would take a sample of
[1:33:42] it and they would take it in and test it
[1:33:44] for moisture and then he would be docked
[1:33:47] from the price however moist the grain
[1:33:49] was if it wasn't ready so he tried to
[1:33:52] wait until the perfect time to take it
[1:33:54] up so the sample could be accepted for
[1:33:58] the entire truck
[1:34:00] oh God you and I live in a day when the
[1:34:03] sample has already been accepted and it
[1:34:06] come to a full maturity
[1:34:09] I hope you hear me today it was not a
[1:34:12] man it was Christ revealing the son of
[1:34:14] man
[1:34:15] the revealing but it had to come to
[1:34:17] maturity in a body
[1:34:18] not to come to maturity so we could look
[1:34:21] at it and say oh that's wonderful but to
[1:34:23] come to maturity to tell us don't give
[1:34:25] up hope you will reach maturity if the
[1:34:28] first fruit of the crop reached maturity
[1:34:30] then the very last one that's planning
[1:34:32] will reach the same maturity well I hope
[1:34:35] you're hearing tonight he had to reach
[1:34:36] the maturity of a major prophet but you
[1:34:38] and I have to reach the maturity of
[1:34:39] whatever God's called us to do and we
[1:34:42] will
[1:34:43] and we will why because the wave sheath
[1:34:46] has been accepted yes
[1:34:48] he said how do you know God honored the
[1:34:49] message you've indicated it
[1:34:52] don't have to be Vindicated again
[1:34:54] Christ in this age the word has been
[1:34:57] accepted for you
[1:34:58] now it's time for the rest of the field
[1:35:00] to ripen
[1:35:01] become Bread on this table
[1:35:04] tender up
[1:35:05] become the loaves
[1:35:08] do you believe it tonight
[1:35:10] amen let's bow our heads together if
[1:35:12] you'd play something
[1:35:17] it's time to become red on the table
[1:35:21] that's when you don't
[1:35:24] the purpose of the of the sheath the
[1:35:26] purpose of the grain is not for itself
[1:35:30] but it's to be mixed up
[1:35:33] and a rising agent put in it
[1:35:36] and the ability and and pressed together
[1:35:38] and ground up
[1:35:40] oh God
[1:35:42] so that it becomes a loaf
[1:35:45] and then the loaf
[1:35:46] is on Christ's table
[1:35:49] oh my that's what I want to be
[1:35:52] it's not about me it's about
[1:35:54] becoming what God wants for me to be
[1:35:57] I want to be everything don't you in
[1:35:59] this hour of all hours and whatever that
[1:36:02] is I I don't want to push you into
[1:36:03] something that you're not but if you're
[1:36:06] the Bride of Jesus Christ and I believe
[1:36:07] that you are today then you can become
[1:36:11] you can become the manifestation
[1:36:13] of whatever gifts God has put in your
[1:36:16] life you can become the manifestation of
[1:36:19] a spiritual gift you can become the
[1:36:21] manifestation of what a preacher ought
[1:36:23] to be what a deacon ought to be you can
[1:36:25] become the manifestation of Love of joy
[1:36:28] peace
[1:36:30] this is the age for that
[1:36:32] I think we ought to just ask God tonight
[1:36:35] Lord help me as an individual I want to
[1:36:38] be bred on your table tender me up Lord
[1:36:40] let me lay in the presence of your word

[1:36:57] though I've read it many many times but
[1:36:59] Lord every time I look I begin to see
[1:37:01] things that and even some things tonight
[1:37:04] Lord I'll look at it again and I'll
[1:37:05] think well there was more to that and
[1:37:07] I'm so grateful for that Lord
[1:37:10] lord it's just that that word that
[1:37:12] you've given us in our hour was a mature
[1:37:14] word it wasn't a Pentecostal word or a
[1:37:17] Methodist word or or a Baptist word but
[1:37:20] it was a mature word an open book we're

[1:37:24] manifest that Lord as you as John took

[1:37:34] you must prophesy again to many people
[1:37:36] in Nations and tongues Lord may we
