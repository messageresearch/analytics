[42:40] in those sacrifices there is a
[42:42] remembrance again made of sins every
[42:46] year you may have your seats may the
[42:48] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[42:49] the word this evening and if I could
[42:52] speak on a thought tonight it would be
[42:53] the worshipper once purged and just to
[42:56] kind of deal with
[42:57] Perfection many times we wonder you know
[43:00] are we good enough to take communion are
[43:01] we good enough to are we good enough to
[43:04] uh to even go to church are we good
[43:05] enough to do a lot of things and the
[43:07] answer is no you're not good enough but
[43:09] through the blood you are perfect can
[43:11] you say amen and brother Brandon would
[43:13] say it like this God requires Perfection
[43:15] and he said we want to bear that in mind
[43:18] that there is nothing just part way that
[43:20] can go into the presence of God it must
[43:22] be perfect our worship everything now in
[43:25] the Garden of Eden God had had Adam and
[43:28] Eve in the garden and they sinned and
[43:29] transgressed the laws of God by sinning
[43:31] and Disobedience and when transgression
[43:34] comes disobedience is the transgression
[43:36] of the law and the law of God him being
[43:38] holy just unadulterated holy therefore
[43:41] no spot of unholiness can ever stand in
[43:43] his presence can you say Amen so if sin
[43:46] came in the world by transgression then
[43:49] sin must be dealt with before the sinner
[43:52] can ever stand in the presence of God so
[43:54] you're a sinner we're all a sinner we're
[43:56] saved by the grace of of God but every
[43:57] one of us were we were born in sin we
[43:59] were shapen in iniquity and we came to
[44:01] the world speaking lies can you say Amen
[44:03] so if you're if you're if you're
[44:05] thinking about well if if I was good
[44:06] enough or my family was good enough or
[44:09] if my dad or if my mom was good enough
[44:10] well that's just I'm just going to tell
[44:12] you right now it's a lost cause because
[44:13] that's never going to get you anywhere
[44:15] it doesn't matter how good your family
[44:17] tree was you were still born in sin and
[44:19] you were still shaped in iniquity
[44:22] doesn't matter about your history you
[44:23] could be a you could be the son of a
[44:24] prophet or you could be the son of a
[44:26] great king or you could be the son of
[44:27] you could be you could be a great person
[44:29] you could have a lot of money and and
[44:30] those are all good things but none of
[44:32] that can save you none of that can
[44:35] actually none of that can make you good
[44:37] enough to stand in the presence of a
[44:38] holy God that was without spot or
[44:40] wrinkle but what can make you stand in
[44:43] the presence of a holy God is nothing
[44:46] but the blood of Jesus can you say Amen
[44:48] so brother Brandon would go on to say it
[44:50] like this he said if there is no law
[44:51] then there is no justice but Law
[44:54] requires or or Justice requires a law
[44:57] and he said it projects Justice and now
[45:00] he said no flesh is saved now by the law
[45:02] no flesh is saved so the law cannot save
[45:04] you the law was just a thing that put us
[45:06] in the jail cell but he said the
[45:08] redeeming power the law only showed us
[45:10] that we were Sinners and condemned us
[45:12] but he said that's what the law is to do
[45:14] it's to tell you how how you did wrong
[45:15] what you did wrong or how bad you are
[45:17] that's what the law can tell you but he
[45:19] said that's what the law is to do it's
[45:21] to bring condemnation or to show you
[45:23] where your mistake is but he said the
[45:26] law in itself self could not save amen
[45:29] so Jesus said I didn't come to destroy
[45:31] the law but I come to magnify the law he
[45:33] come to come to do something with it it
[45:35] couldn't stay just a law because you
[45:37] couldn't live the law I couldn't live
[45:39] the law but there had to be something in
[45:41] us or something that would come that
[45:44] would be able to make you be able to
[45:46] stand in the presence of a just God and
[45:48] you could not do that on your own you
[45:50] could not do that you could not do that
[45:52] by your family history as we just said
[45:54] but you can only do that through the
[45:55] redeeming power of An Almighty God that
[45:58] would come down and put himself on your
[46:00] level in the flesh of a man he was
[46:02] tempted like you've been tempted he was
[46:04] tried just like you've been tried but
[46:06] yet he was perfect and that he could do
[46:08] no sin and though you would do sin all
[46:10] the sins of the world were placed upon
[46:13] him so that you wouldn't have to go to
[46:15] Calvary oh come on somebody I think that
[46:17] ought to make a shout today that because
[46:19] of the blood of Christ we don't have to
[46:21] taste death because of the blood of
[46:23] Christ we don't have to worry about our
[46:25] future because we know who holds holds
[46:27] the future we know that we know that
[46:29] he's got it all in control we know that
[46:31] we don't have to worry about nothing why
[46:33] because he came and he died and he bled
[46:35] and that blood is powerful enough to
[46:38] hold on to every one of us when I see
[46:40] the blood I will pass over you so
[46:43] brother Rand would go on to say like
[46:44] this every law has a penalty and the
[46:46] penalty of transgressing transgressing
[46:48] God's law is death and I better start my
[46:51] timer before everybody worries about
[46:54] that he said now when Adam and Eve had
[46:56] sinned there was no way no other remedy
[46:59] that they could ever stand in the
[47:00] presence of God again except sin be
[47:03] dealt with can you say Amen so no man
[47:05] can commit a sin of any type no matter
[47:08] how little or no matter how big that
[47:10] individual sin has to be dealt with
[47:13] therefore he said before the one who
[47:15] committed it can ever stand in the
[47:16] presence of a holy God so he said he
[47:18] said every man and every woman every
[47:20] child is included in the penalty of
[47:22] death by the transgression of the head
[47:25] of the human race Adam he said and by
[47:28] his transgression every one of us fell
[47:30] victim to sin can you say amen and I'm
[47:32] going to get on down here and try to
[47:33] hurry through this and and I see my son
[47:35] out here in the aisles amening me I'll
[47:37] tell you what you you can join him if
[47:38] you want to the Bible plainly tells us
[47:40] that God is love but he said yet being L
[47:43] he has to be just so love does not mean
[47:46] just a thing that can be petted and
[47:48] played with love is the justice of God
[47:50] can you say amen and so when God seen
[47:53] that this his children had transgressed
[47:55] his law and that they Must Die the death
[47:58] then Sovereign Love Somebody say love
[48:00] Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way
[48:03] for God seen that these children must be
[48:06] absolutely totally annihilated from his
[48:08] presence and there was nothing else to
[48:09] be done remember Adam ran from the
[48:12] presence of God why because he was he
[48:14] didn't want to stand in the presence of
[48:15] a holy God being a sinner and he didn't
[48:17] want he didn't want to have to face up
[48:18] to the consequences of what he had done
[48:21] but what he run from the presence of God
[48:22] but remember God did not leave him in
[48:24] that condition and God come running
[48:26] after Adam he said Adam where art thou
[48:28] brother Danny when you was running from
[48:29] God God come after you Danny where are
[48:32] you you're my son I don't care what
[48:33] you've done but I want you to come back
[48:35] to me God has come after every one of us
[48:37] in that way no matter how bad you've
[48:39] been and no matter what sins you done
[48:41] God sent his son so that his blood could
[48:44] cover that sin and he come calling Mercy
[48:46] come calling your name Mercy Came
[48:48] Calling My Name the grace of God is
[48:50] greater than any sin that you could
[48:52] commit can you say
[48:54] Amen brother bam said it like this he
[48:57] said amen too all right he said there
[49:00] was nothing else to be done they had
[49:02] transgressed his law and he goes on down
[49:03] he said when Divine love is projected
[49:05] Sovereign Grace produces the object of
[49:07] love and and so I'd say the object of
[49:10] love to us was a was a man that you
[49:12] could call Jesus and and he was he did
[49:14] nothing wrong he did nothing to deserve
[49:16] a cross but God in in his Sovereign
[49:19] Grace and his Sovereign Love would would
[49:21] choose to let his son die so Brother
[49:23] David you wouldn't have to die he would
[49:25] choose to let him die so that I wouldn't
[49:27] have to die because I deserve death he
[49:30] never deserved it but through that then
[49:32] God could look at us today and say I
[49:34] will have a bride that is perfect
[49:36] without spotter Rico washed in the blood
[49:38] of the lamb and through the blood he
[49:40] looks at you as though you never did it
[49:42] in the first place brother the bill it
[49:43] is God's Sovereign Grace over your life
[49:47] can you say amen God is good to us God
[49:50] is so great that he would come down and
[49:53] and make himself a man and and speak to
[49:55] Abraham and he would come down and make
[49:57] himself a man so that he could he could
[49:59] die on a cross he was so great that he
[50:01] could come down and make himself a man
[50:03] that he could eat with his disciples and
[50:05] he would come down and make himself a
[50:07] man so that he could wash feet with the
[50:09] men listen he was such a great God and
[50:11] he made himself so low that he would
[50:13] become a footwash flunky why because he
[50:15] knew that you needed Fellowship can you
[50:18] say
[50:19] amen and brother Brandon would go on
[50:21] like this and you forgive me but I'm
[50:23] reading a lot here tonight it's out of
[50:24] the message Perfection and I love this
[50:26] message I've dealt with it before and
[50:28] and I I took out all the quotes I'd read
[50:29] before to try to not do the same thing
[50:31] twice but he said all through the Old
[50:33] Testament they offered the blood of
[50:34] lambs and goats and sheep and Bulls and
[50:37] heers of substitutionary death but all
[50:39] in the great economy of God there was
[50:41] back in his mind the real object coming
[50:44] so all the time God saw this thing that
[50:46] was happening and he and he saw the
[50:48] sheep and he saw the Bulls and and he
[50:50] saw everything that was being offered
[50:52] and then he would say it like this he
[50:53] said but I know there's coming a day
[50:55] when you won't have to do this this no
[50:56] more there's coming a perfect sacrifice
[50:59] because you can't live the law and God
[51:02] already had this in the back of his mind
[51:03] and and so he said he would come down
[51:05] and he said there was a real object that
[51:07] was to come and the real object that
[51:09] came was his only begotten son all the
[51:12] Lambs that died was only a shadow a
[51:14] shadow is only the negative side of an
[51:16] object and they only spoke of a Calvary
[51:19] coming can you say Amen so we read in
[51:22] Hebrews there that that the law was only
[51:24] having a shadow of things that were to
[51:26] come it was only a shadow it was only it
[51:29] was an imperfect thing that would happen
[51:31] but there was coming a perfect sacrifice
[51:33] and so brother Ram deals with that
[51:34] scripture and says the law having a
[51:36] shadow of things to come could never
[51:38] make the worshipper perfect you get the
[51:40] picture he said now let's go at it again
[51:42] you'll you you'll sure not to miss it he
[51:43] said God requires perfect Holiness and
[51:46] no one no one can stand in His image
[51:48] with one little speck of sin Jesus
[51:50] witnessed the same he said be perfect
[51:52] just like God in heaven is perfect and
[51:54] and the Bible said that the law could
[51:56] never with sacrifices make the the comer
[51:58] perfect or the worshipper perfect and he
[52:00] said then the law could not perfect
[52:02] anything it was only a pointer he said
[52:04] these sacrifices made every year could
[52:06] only make the worshipper perfect and he
[52:08] said could never make the worshipper
[52:10] perfect so therefore no one under the
[52:12] law or the keeping of laws or under the
[52:14] shadows could be perfect and he said if
[52:17] there is anything that I can do to make
[52:19] myself perfect in the presence of God
[52:22] then Christ did not have to die for me
[52:25] but he had to die for me brother Bobby
[52:27] because we who were low down and nobody
[52:30] and we could never stand in the presence
[52:31] of a holy God but God thought enough of
[52:34] us to send somebody who could stand in
[52:37] my place aren't you glad about it here
[52:39] today I tell you I think we I think we
[52:41] get to look at ourselves so much and we
[52:43] get to thinking how bad we are and yes
[52:45] we're a low down bunch of creatures but
[52:47] God in his Rich grace and mercy he saw
[52:49] how low down you were and that's the
[52:51] very reason that he sent his savior
[52:54] because you couldn't live the law you
[52:56] couldn't I tell you what nothing can die
[52:58] in your place nothing nothing could die
[52:59] for you that would ever make you perfect
[53:01] but a perfect Son of God could and it
[53:04] would make you perfect and brother
[53:05] brandom goes on to say this he said when
[53:08] Christ died he said he said he didn't
[53:10] die in vain he said no he said you
[53:12] couldn't Merit anything in the presence
[53:13] of God he said but then if you could
[53:16] Christ would die he died in vain he said
[53:18] no lawke keeping no legalistic idea of
[53:20] yours none of your own Holiness somebody
[53:22] say Amen none of I don't care how holy
[53:24] you think you are or how great you think
[53:27] you are none of your Holiness is going
[53:29] to stand in the presence of God but
[53:31] listen he said it like this he said now
[53:33] he said none of your own Holiness no
[53:35] things that you could quit well I quit
[53:36] lying I quit stealing I quit smoking
[53:38] tobacco none of that he said he said
[53:40] it's going to the Picture Show still he
[53:42] said steal you're lost he said but
[53:44] nothing can do it joining churches and
[53:47] ceremonies and baptisms and Orders of
[53:49] the church and reading of Creeds and
[53:51] every he said sing a prayers well come
[53:52] on church all these things that we do
[53:55] that there's good things that we do but
[53:57] none of them mean that you're going to
[53:58] be saved you've got to have more than
[54:01] just going to church there's got to be
[54:02] more than just saying a prayer there's
[54:04] got to be more than just saying well I
[54:06] pay my tithe there's got to be more than
[54:07] that there's got to be something on the
[54:09] inside of you that has accepted the
[54:12] worship the worship you're the
[54:13] worshipper something on the inside of
[54:15] you has had to accept that God has done
[54:18] a work in your life and there's got to
[54:20] be something that that accepts the word
[54:22] and when when the word said to be
[54:24] baptized you went and be went and got
[54:26] baptized IED and and then you realize
[54:28] that after that then you had a promise
[54:29] of the Holy Ghost and and you would walk
[54:31] in these ordinance because of the blood
[54:33] you didn't walk over the blood to get to
[54:35] the ordinances the blood on your life
[54:37] has caused you to sit here in a
[54:39] communion service at 3:00 on a Sunday
[54:41] afternoon the blood over your life has
[54:44] caused you to say Amen to the word of
[54:45] God the blood over your life has caused
[54:48] you to claim your children why because
[54:50] thy in thy house and under that blood
[54:52] under that token it is a positive token
[54:55] and it is something you can hold on to
[54:57] it is not just a tape in Jeffersonville
[54:59] it is not just a brandom Tabernacle in
[55:01] Jeffersonville it is not how many tapes
[55:03] you listen to or how many times you read
[55:05] the Bible those are good things those
[55:07] are great things but none of that has
[55:09] the atonement in it but the blood of
[55:11] Jesus has the atonement for every sin
[55:14] and every mistake and every trespass
[55:17] that you've ever had nothing but the
[55:19] blood of Jesus can you say amen he said
[55:23] not of one thing can you do it in
[55:24] yourself for you're a sinner under
[55:27] condemnation and there is not no way
[55:29] within yourself there's no Creed nothing
[55:32] that you could do or think of that could
[55:35] Merit one thing in the presence of God
[55:38] because you're a sinner to start with
[55:41] you are a sinner when you were a cute
[55:43] little baby held in the hospital room
[55:45] you were born a sinner that's hard to
[55:48] say when you got a cute little kid like
[55:50] cat when right there that they're a
[55:51] sinner but they're born in sin they're
[55:53] shaped in iniquity they come to the
[55:55] world's people
[55:57] lies before they can talk they're lying
[55:59] to
[56:00] you in the presence of God he said the
[56:03] Archbishop born in this world was as
[56:05] guilty as the lowest Barfly in the
[56:08] city can you say
[56:10] Amen one cannot atone for the other he
[56:14] took an innocent life of an animal a
[56:16] little lamb and under the Old Testament
[56:19] the law he said was when a man sinned he
[56:23] brought the lamb to the altar say if he
[56:25] transgressed of The Commandments he
[56:27] brought the lamb and he laid it on the
[56:29] altar he laid his hands upon the lamb
[56:31] and he confessed his sins that he was
[56:34] wrong and he know he was guilty and he
[56:36] said the law would require death so he
[56:39] brought the lamb instead and and this
[56:41] lamb did nothing wrong this lamb didn't
[56:44] deserve that this lamb didn't deserve to
[56:46] have his throat slit this lamb did not
[56:49] deserve that but what but but but the
[56:51] but the sinner standing there killing
[56:53] the lamb deserved to have the same type
[56:55] of death can you say amen and he said
[56:58] this poor little fell was trying to
[56:59] bleed and and and and kick and and all
[57:02] this to straighten out and he said then
[57:04] he Quivers again and he bleats and the
[57:06] blood gushes out and and he says it like
[57:09] this he said when he walked down he said
[57:11] he was guilty person maybe not by desire
[57:15] but by Nature he was guilty and he had
[57:17] to recognize that this innocent little
[57:19] lamb died in his place and he felt sorry
[57:22] for the little thing but the man as soon
[57:25] as the lamb finally died died with the
[57:27] blood of the Lamb upon his hands he
[57:29] walked from the building with the same
[57:31] desire in his heart why because it was
[57:33] an imperfect shadow of something to come
[57:36] it was not something that could take
[57:37] away his sins it could not take away his
[57:39] transgressions it was a temporary fix
[57:42] can you say Amen sometimes as as a
[57:44] Christian you're a young person and you
[57:46] come to the Altar and you feel good and
[57:47] it's a temporary fix but you got to go
[57:49] farther than that with God you've
[57:51] actually got to commit your life to him
[57:53] so so that he can change you and and
[57:55] make you new and and and you've got to
[57:57] Just Surrender everything to him why
[57:59] because just a temporary fix ain't good
[58:01] enough a temporary fix ain't going to
[58:03] hold you in the time we're living a
[58:05] temporary fix is not going to cover you
[58:07] but there's got to be a perfect
[58:08] sacrifice that has come in your time and
[58:11] in your day to give you he said when I
[58:13] see the blood I'll pass over you and
[58:15] without the Holy Ghost token you're
[58:17] never going to make it come on church
[58:19] you've got to remember that the Holy
[58:21] Ghost token is the only thing that he's
[58:24] going to look at and say you're sealed
[58:26] until the day of your Redemption you've
[58:28] got to have that token on
[58:30] display can you say amen and so brother
[58:34] R would go on down and I'll I'll try to
[58:35] get down here just as far as I can
[58:38] running out of time he said the blood
[58:40] was pouring out of this lamb and he said
[58:43] he said the life went from the animal
[58:45] and it could not back come back to the
[58:46] man for one was an animal and one was a
[58:49] man an innocent animal not a guil and to
[58:51] a guilty man but he said oh one day some
[58:53] 2,000 years ago the Lamb of God was born
[58:56] can you say Amen down in a little manger
[58:58] in Bethlehem and he said he was led like
[59:00] a sheep to the slaughter they didn't
[59:02] drive him to the Cross but he he took
[59:04] the cross himself and was led that way
[59:06] why because God knew that you needed a
[59:09] sacrifice and God knew that you needed a
[59:12] a savior and so and so God in his
[59:15] Sovereign Grace and Mercy looked down
[59:16] and he thought you know what that's a
[59:18] worshipper that's someone who's trying
[59:20] but but they can't be saved by just
[59:21] coming to the house of God and
[59:22] worshiping and they can't come and just
[59:24] kill a lamb every year and be save no
[59:26] that's just a temporary fix but he gave
[59:28] the ultimate sacrifice and the blood
[59:31] that would last forever the blood that
[59:33] was shed on Calvary was not just good
[59:35] 2,000 years ago but it's good in 2024
[59:39] and it'll be good tomorrow and it'll be
[59:41] good at the end of the year and if the
[59:42] world stands another 50 years this blood
[59:45] will still work for you and your family
[59:47] can you say
[59:49] Amen brother Brandon would say it like
[59:51] this he said predes a predestinated god
[59:53] predestinated a church he predestinated
[59:55] a church to meet him Yonder without spot
[59:57] or wrinkle and if God required a church
[1:00:00] without spot or wrinkle he had to have
[1:00:02] something to make it that way can you
[1:00:03] say amen he could not require he said
[1:00:06] his Justice his judgments could not let
[1:00:08] him ask such a thing if there wasn't a
[1:00:10] way to make it happen and a man cannot
[1:00:13] do it in himself he's a total failure
[1:00:15] God let him see that through the law
[1:00:17] through the judges and through all the
[1:00:19] Old Testament he sent the prophets he
[1:00:21] sent the righteous man and they found
[1:00:23] that every one of them failed he said so
[1:00:25] God by his Sovereign Grace sent from the
[1:00:28] portals of Glory his only begotten son
[1:00:31] to take our place aren't you glad for it
[1:00:33] today amen remember he said he said for
[1:00:36] if if he would have said for a pope of
[1:00:38] Rome to take it he could have not done
[1:00:40] it he said if he would have said for an
[1:00:41] Archbishop of Canterbury to do it he
[1:00:43] could not have done it he said if he
[1:00:45] would have called on the most holy
[1:00:46] Reverend father a bishop of the world he
[1:00:48] could not have done it he would have
[1:00:50] been just as far rejected as judas's
[1:00:52] carot was he could not do it why a man
[1:00:54] can't do this and he said he was born in
[1:00:56] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:00:58] speaking lies he needed an atonement for
[1:01:00] himself but he said there came one from
[1:01:03] the portals of Glory none other than not
[1:01:05] a man not a good man not a Jew or a
[1:01:08] gentile he was nothing less than
[1:01:10] almighty God can you say amen he was hid
[1:01:13] in a human flesh and he came himself to
[1:01:15] offer his own blood for he did not come
[1:01:17] through sex and had nothing to do with
[1:01:19] it but he said he overshadowed a virgin
[1:01:21] and brought forth from a blood cell that
[1:01:22] he created and he said himself the
[1:01:24] innocent one he said my salvation and
[1:01:27] yours tonight does not hinge upon the
[1:01:29] merits of our own acts it hinges upon
[1:01:31] the positive Sovereign Grace Of An
[1:01:34] Almighty God can you say Amen it it's
[1:01:36] not our acts it's not how good we are
[1:01:39] what we're doing sitting in this service
[1:01:40] this afternoon it's not trying to be
[1:01:42] saved it's not trying to work oursel in
[1:01:45] but this today is just an act to show
[1:01:47] that we have met God and that there is a
[1:01:50] redeemer that has covered us and there
[1:01:52] is somebody who thought enough of us
[1:01:54] that he didn't want to leave us down
[1:01:55] here Sodom and gomorra but he wanted to
[1:01:57] raise us up and set together in Heavenly
[1:02:00] places can you say Amen brother Mar
[1:02:03] would go on to say it like this and he
[1:02:05] said how do we know that we get that he
[1:02:06] said when the worshiper puts his hands
[1:02:08] by faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:10] and feels the terror of sin and the mock
[1:02:13] of spit on his own face and feels the
[1:02:15] groanings of Gethsemane and the agonies
[1:02:17] of Calvary knows that he is guilty and
[1:02:20] confesses his sins correctly oh blessed
[1:02:22] Lord I'm guilty and I have no other way
[1:02:25] but you to help me
[1:02:26] he said by faith you're bidding the Holy
[1:02:28] Spirit has has to come and he bids come
[1:02:31] and he said I he said and I now by faith
[1:02:34] accept Jesus as my personal savior
[1:02:36] listen there's not a lot of Hoops to
[1:02:38] jump through there's not a lot of things
[1:02:40] you have to do this is not an obstacle
[1:02:42] course but he said if you'll just
[1:02:43] believe on the Son of God and if you'll
[1:02:45] just confess your faults and and just
[1:02:47] repent and and just be baptized that's
[1:02:49] all you got to do and you shall receive
[1:02:52] the very Spirit the very Life of Christ
[1:02:54] that was it is come back into the
[1:02:56] worshipper again so that you don't have
[1:02:58] to worry about where you're going you
[1:03:00] are sealed and you are ready to be
[1:03:02] delivered this is the time when there's
[1:03:04] going to be somebody leave this world
[1:03:06] and it might as well be you I say it
[1:03:08] might as well be us because why God has
[1:03:10] not left us here without a savior he has
[1:03:13] not left us here in a time when there's
[1:03:15] chaos everywhere and there's destruction
[1:03:18] everywhere but he had somebody that
[1:03:20] would rise above it all and say it
[1:03:22] doesn't matter what goes on over here it
[1:03:24] doesn't matter what goes on over there
[1:03:26] but God has called me for a time like
[1:03:29] this so that I could be raised up and
[1:03:31] and it's not my flesh that could be
[1:03:32] raised up but it is God and His Mercy
[1:03:35] that say sister Janie you might have
[1:03:37] experienced heartbreaking you might have
[1:03:39] been through all kind of things in your
[1:03:40] life but when I see the blood that death
[1:03:42] angel can never touch you in your house
[1:03:44] why because God has called you for this
[1:03:47] time he has sealed you with the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost and it could be any one of you
[1:03:50] brother Jeff God has not called you to
[1:03:53] lose your family but God has called you
[1:03:55] and said thy and thy house shall be
[1:03:58] saved we don't worry about what they're
[1:04:00] doing right now because we know the
[1:04:02] future by the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:04:05] already been oh come on somebody God has
[1:04:08] already he's already saw your future
[1:04:10] brother Bill and he and he said he has
[1:04:11] good thoughts of you he has thoughts of
[1:04:13] peace and not of evil and he came down
[1:04:16] he because he didn't want to leave you
[1:04:17] in this world he didn't want you to go
[1:04:19] to a sinner's grave and and and and go
[1:04:21] to hell he had to make a way of Escape
[1:04:23] for you in an hour of destruction and an
[1:04:26] hour when people would turn their backs
[1:04:28] on God and in an hour when people would
[1:04:30] look at God and mock his name and spit
[1:04:33] in his face but there would be somebody
[1:04:35] who would experience the resurrection of
[1:04:38] Jesus Christ and say mind my house as
[1:04:41] for us we are going to serve the Lord
[1:04:43] and we are going to put the blood on the
[1:04:44] doorpost and we're going to read the
[1:04:46] Bible why it's not because we're trying
[1:04:48] to get saved it's because I am saved and
[1:04:51] I'm going to show God that I love
[1:04:53] everything he did for me I'm going to
[1:04:55] show him I love that he went to Calvary
[1:04:57] for me I love that he saved my soul I
[1:05:00] love that he's got my family a promise
[1:05:02] over them I love it why because he first
[1:05:05] loved you and died for
[1:05:07] you he Lo he loved you so much why can't
[1:05:11] we just return the love to him now
[1:05:13] that's why we worship God it's not about
[1:05:15] you it's not about me it's not about
[1:05:18] listen church it's not about how you
[1:05:20] feel if you only worship when you feel
[1:05:22] good you never worship if you only
[1:05:24] praise him when you feel good you'll
[1:05:25] never praise him I tell you what I
[1:05:27] there's been some people I tell you what
[1:05:29] there's been men that have been martyred
[1:05:30] and they go down singing they go down
[1:05:32] praising I can tell you about a man that
[1:05:34] was sitting in a jail cell and he was
[1:05:36] sitting there with his life on the line
[1:05:39] and he could still sing so loud that the
[1:05:41] presence of the Lord would come along
[1:05:43] and break every chain I think sometimes
[1:05:45] we just need to go ahead and praise him
[1:05:47] in the storm that we're in praise God in
[1:05:49] the situation you're in Praise Him in
[1:05:52] the valley praise him on the Mountaintop
[1:05:54] praise God everybody here that has
[1:05:57] breath everything that has breath praise
[1:06:00] ye the Lord can you say
[1:06:03] amen God has not called us to
[1:06:05] destruction God has not called us to be
[1:06:08] cast down but God has called us to be
[1:06:11] sons and daughters in this time can you
[1:06:13] say Amen so in order to do that he had
[1:06:15] to give his life so that his life could
[1:06:18] come back on to the believer can you say
[1:06:20] Amen so the worshipper would come and
[1:06:22] the worshipper would not listen Church
[1:06:24] you won't get there just by wor
[1:06:25] worshiping but but God does inhabit the
[1:06:27] Praises of his people aren't you glad
[1:06:28] for that and so I'm thankful that when
[1:06:30] I'm praising I know that he's inhabiting
[1:06:32] he's inhabiting me I tell you because we
[1:06:34] are worshiping him not to get there
[1:06:37] that's not a work that we are trying to
[1:06:40] well Lord if I worship will you save me
[1:06:42] if I if if I worship will you you know
[1:06:44] will you come no God's already the
[1:06:46] promise to show up you're worshiping
[1:06:48] because you know he's here by faith and
[1:06:50] you're worshiping because he's already
[1:06:52] touched you you're worshiping because
[1:06:53] he's already put something in your heart
[1:06:55] that you can't deny him you can't turn
[1:06:58] your back on him God has given you the
[1:07:00] spirit of worship and true worshippers

[1:07:50] go preach and I'll skip on down here you
[1:07:52] know the story but he said he was going
[1:07:53] over there and he went into this place
[1:07:54] that he said just a just a little old
[1:07:57] restaurant off to the side and he said
[1:07:58] he walked in the door and there was a
[1:08:00] slot machine going and and there was a
[1:08:02] man of my age uh was married a married
[1:08:05] man he said with his arm around a woman
[1:08:06] playing a slot machine and he said the
[1:08:08] very law he said our very law the
[1:08:10] protection of our righteousness of our
[1:08:12] Goods was standing there violating a
[1:08:13] thing that was supposed to be protecting
[1:08:15] he said because it's illegal to gamble
[1:08:17] where that restaurant was in Ohio he
[1:08:19] said playing a slot machine and he said
[1:08:20] I turned and looked towards the back of
[1:08:22] the building and there was a bunch of
[1:08:24] teenage boys now I want you to just know
[1:08:26] that brother Brandon was condemning this
[1:08:27] situation brother Brandon didn't like
[1:08:29] what was going on here and it's a bad
[1:08:31] situation you would have a right to say
[1:08:32] this is not good this is not godly it's
[1:08:34] it's not holy but but but just watch
[1:08:36] where we go here he said he said there
[1:08:38] was a lady about 18 years old excuse me
[1:08:41] I'm going down here he said he said how
[1:08:43] he said he saw this person down here he
[1:08:44] said there was a a woman standing there
[1:08:46] he said uh and she was standing there
[1:08:49] with her dress hanging low in the front
[1:08:50] and one of those boys with his hands on
[1:08:51] the girl where they did not belong and
[1:08:53] he said there was smoking and drinking
[1:08:55] and he said 'I oh God how can you stand
[1:08:57] it and he said' I looked over to my
[1:08:59] right when I heard someone make out a
[1:09:00] big groan and he said there said an
[1:09:02] older woman about 60 years old aged
[1:09:04] woman about 60 or 70 years old that's
[1:09:07] not old by the
[1:09:09] way but mama said oh
[1:09:12] amen but he said those little vulgar
[1:09:14] clothes on just about halfway up her
[1:09:16] Limbs and poor little old wrinkled flesh
[1:09:18] just flabby as it could be just a bad
[1:09:21] just a bad scene if you can imagine it
[1:09:23] brother Brandon said she had her face
[1:09:25] painted
[1:09:27] her purple toenails and purple
[1:09:30] fingernails and her hair was cut real
[1:09:32] short and curled up and died blue and he
[1:09:35] said I looked over at her and across the
[1:09:37] table set two men and it was all this
[1:09:40] going on and he said God why don't you
[1:09:41] just destroy the whole thing why don't
[1:09:43] you just sink it beneath the Earth and
[1:09:45] he said I've got a little girl Sarah and
[1:09:46] Rebecca little girl Sarah and Rebecca
[1:09:48] are they going to have to grow up under
[1:09:50] such stuff as that he said how can you
[1:09:52] God and your great Holiness ever stand
[1:09:53] to look at such a thing like that and
[1:09:55] not send an earthquake and sink it this
[1:09:57] is a father speaking and you can just
[1:09:59] imagine how he feels and you don't want
[1:10:00] our little girls and our little boys to
[1:10:02] grow up in a situation like this and so
[1:10:04] he says he says I can't I don't want to
[1:10:06] see my little boy doing things that that
[1:10:08] he ought not do and maybe things like
[1:10:10] that and he said he said I seen that
[1:10:12] great black shadow go towards heaven
[1:10:14] which God would have killed me at that
[1:10:16] moment excuse me I skipped down I'm
[1:10:18] sorry he said I Ste behind the door and
[1:10:20] I seen something like whirling and he
[1:10:23] said it was in the vision it was the
[1:10:24] world turning around around and around
[1:10:26] and I noticed around the world was a
[1:10:27] Scarlet streak and around the world he
[1:10:29] said he said I got to the world I seen
[1:10:31] myself just a little boy doing things
[1:10:32] that I ought not do and maybe not not
[1:10:34] not like that but it was sin and every
[1:10:36] time I did anything I seen that great
[1:10:38] black shadow go towards heaven which God
[1:10:41] would have killed me at any minute and
[1:10:42] he said then I seen standing between me
[1:10:44] and God there was a perfect sacrifice
[1:10:46] can you say amen he said and I seen him
[1:10:49] standing there with the thorns on his
[1:10:50] head and the spit on his face and every
[1:10:52] time my sins would start towards God he
[1:10:54] would reach out and catch it like the
[1:10:56] bumper on the car and he was protecting
[1:10:58] me from death and every time I would do
[1:11:00] anything wrong God would have killed me
[1:11:02] this is a man who was told not to drink
[1:11:04] or smoke or defile his body this is a
[1:11:06] man that lived a good life this is a
[1:11:08] this is a good man this is a man who who
[1:11:10] said he never committed adultery this is
[1:11:11] a good man but he even stood there in
[1:11:13] the presence of God and realized that
[1:11:15] even his sins would deserve death and so
[1:11:18] he said he said certainly his Holiness
[1:11:20] requires it his Law requires it and
[1:11:23] every time I would do anything or or
[1:11:25] anything the blood of Jesus just acted
[1:11:27] like that bumper and he said I've seen
[1:11:28] that Scarlet streak he said and that
[1:11:30] blood still holds the Earth and he said
[1:11:32] as I stood there looking I got a little
[1:11:34] closer to him and I noticed him and I
[1:11:36] could hear him say father forgive him he
[1:11:38] doesn't know what he's doing and he said
[1:11:40] I look down and there laid a book and
[1:11:42] there was a recording Angel there
[1:11:43] Standing By My Side by his side and
[1:11:45] every time I sinned it was put down on
[1:11:47] the book and my name was on it and I
[1:11:49] realized that someday that the blood
[1:11:51] streak would be lifted and I would have
[1:11:53] to stand in the presence of God with my
[1:11:55] S sinful life but he said I seen by his
[1:11:57] Mercy he was holding off my judgment and
[1:12:00] he said I went by him humbly I knelt on
[1:12:02] my knees and I said oh Jesus thou Son of
[1:12:04] God I am unworthy to come in your
[1:12:06] presence but will you please forgive me
[1:12:09] for what I have done and he touched his
[1:12:11] side with his hand took a took the old
[1:12:13] book and wrote pardoned and he throwed
[1:12:15] it back behind him and he said my sins
[1:12:17] were gone and then he looked at me Stern
[1:12:19] in the face and he said now I have
[1:12:21] forgiven you but you want to condemn her
[1:12:24] now church I want to show you some mercy
[1:12:26] and Grace happening right here in a
[1:12:28] story from a prophet he said when I seen
[1:12:30] that what it meant he said I come out of
[1:12:32] the vision I walked over to her I said
[1:12:33] how do you do and she was drinking and
[1:12:35] she looked up at him and she talked to
[1:12:37] him and and he told her the story just a
[1:12:39] few minutes ago standing behind the door
[1:12:41] he said he began to tell her and as he
[1:12:42] began to look the tears begin to run
[1:12:43] down her cheeks and she said he said
[1:12:46] lady he said you don't mean to do those
[1:12:48] things but he said Jesus died and the
[1:12:51] judgments of God is held off by this
[1:12:52] Blood you didn't mean to do this and she
[1:12:55] said no sir my father was a deacon in
[1:12:57] the church I was raised in a Christian
[1:12:58] home my husband and I were charter
[1:13:00] members and I lived a Christian Life and
[1:13:02] she began to tell me after his death and
[1:13:04] and she told her a story and but but
[1:13:06] brother said God be merciful and those
[1:13:08] who has for knew he has called and she
[1:13:10] said are you Reverend brandom he said I
[1:13:12] am and she said I'm ashamed of myself to
[1:13:14] sitting here like this and he said do
[1:13:16] you she said do you think there would be
[1:13:17] a chance for me I tell you what I think
[1:13:19] some of us have been there do you think
[1:13:21] there would be a chance for me and and
[1:13:23] and brother Brandon would say about like
[1:13:24] this he
[1:13:26] he said he said yes he said I I said
[1:13:29] Jesus has his arm stretched out waiting
[1:13:31] for you to come lady and the other
[1:13:33] people be to take up and said would you
[1:13:34] walk out here on this floor with me and
[1:13:36] she said I will and he took her by the
[1:13:38] hand and said you're about the age of my
[1:13:39] mother would you kneel here with me on
[1:13:40] the floor and there in the floor they
[1:13:42] broke that place up with an oldfashioned
[1:13:44] meeting and God saved that woman by his
[1:13:46] grace and look look God didn't even see
[1:13:49] what she had done before that God didn't
[1:13:51] even look at the woman that was standing
[1:13:52] there 5 minutes before that then was
[1:13:55] that was doing every kind of unclean
[1:13:57] thing and was sitting there vulgar
[1:13:59] dressed and let me just go ahead and
[1:14:00] tell you something she didn't go get the
[1:14:02] nails cleaned and she didn't go grow the
[1:14:04] hair out and she didn't go change
[1:14:05] clothes to get saved she got saved and
[1:14:08] the rest of it took care of herself can
[1:14:10] you say Amen but I want you to notice
[1:14:12] that God in his ultimate infinite grace
[1:14:15] would come into a room that was filled
[1:14:17] with nothing but chaos and and and and
[1:14:19] just it was Sinners and filth and all
[1:14:22] these things and law breaking and all
[1:14:24] this and God would come into that room
[1:14:26] and speak directly to a woman that knew
[1:14:29] that she needed God and if you just know
[1:14:31] that you need God this afternoon if you
[1:14:33] know you need a savior if you know
[1:14:35] you're not good enough on your own but
[1:14:37] you say I just want what you've got for
[1:14:39] me and I I'll look at the blood and I'll
[1:14:42] never let anything come between me and
[1:14:44] the Lord there's going to be all kinds
[1:14:45] of sin in your life if you're not
[1:14:47] careful and there's going to be mistakes
[1:14:48] that you'll make as a Christian but let
[1:14:50] me just tell you one time in the
[1:14:51] presence of God and God can change every
[1:14:54] situation God can clean you up God can
[1:14:57] make you whole God can make you new why
[1:14:59] because everything you have need of is
[1:15:02] in the blood of Jesus Christ and when he
[1:15:04] sees the blood he doesn't see your sin
[1:15:07] when he sees your blood he doesn't see
[1:15:08] your mistakes when he sees your when he
[1:15:11] sees the blood everything else is clean
[1:15:14] he sees nothing but pure white on the
[1:15:16] believer can you say Amen brother bandam
[1:15:19] says I like this he says God requires
[1:15:23] Perfection he requires repentance he
[1:15:26] requires your loyalty to him but he's
[1:15:28] looking tonight no matter how much you
[1:15:32] sinned how little or how much you are
[1:15:36] still a
[1:15:37] sinner and cannot get in any other way
[1:15:41] but by Jesus Christ God's alls
[1:15:43] sufficient sacrifice can you say amen
[1:15:45] and in him you are perfected forever he
[1:15:49] said think of it it's not nothing you do
[1:15:51] it's not new pages you turn it's not new
[1:15:54] life you start heart it's a confession
[1:15:56] of your wrong and it's God's grace to
[1:15:59] you that brings you to Perfection he
[1:16:02] said then you are perfected in Jesus
[1:16:05] Christ can you say Amen my time's about
[1:16:09] up my time is up if you'd stand to your
[1:16:11] feet the musicians would come I know
[1:16:12] we've got communion this afternoon and I
[1:16:15] just want to say it like this if you
[1:16:17] have not accepted the blood of Jesus
[1:16:19] over your life today you can do that
[1:16:21] right here in this service if there's
[1:16:23] something between you and the the savior
[1:16:26] he said just repent make that thing
[1:16:28] right and the blood will cover it can
[1:16:31] you say Amen the blood of Jesus covers
[1:16:34] all your sins the blood of Jesus covers
[1:16:37] you it cleanses you from all iniquity so
[1:16:42] all you have to do today with your heads
[1:16:44] bowed I just want to take this moment
[1:16:46] before we take communion if there's
[1:16:48] something in your life that would stop
[1:16:50] you from taking communion this afternoon
[1:16:52] I wonder if You' just let the Lord know
[1:16:53] about it I believe all it takes is just
[1:16:56] just a sincere moment in the presence of
[1:16:59] God and then God can come in and and
[1:17:02] change that
[1:17:03] heart if you would just play something
[1:17:06] softly man if you have something on your
[1:17:08] your heart just put your hand up to him
[1:17:10] and just let him know about it right now
[1:17:12] just talk to him just for a moment if

[1:21:46] thankful for that so thankful that
[1:21:49] that's all all that he
[1:21:51] sees says for I have received of the
[1:21:53] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:21:55] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:21:58] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:22:01] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:22:03] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:22:06] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:22:09] me after the same manner also he took
[1:22:12] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[1:22:15] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:22:18] you as often as you drink it in
[1:22:20] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:22:23] eat this bread and drink this cup cup
[1:22:25] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:22:27] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:22:29] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:22:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:22:33] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:22:36] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:22:38] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:22:41] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:22:43] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:22:46] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:22:48] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:22:50] many sleep for if we would judge
[1:22:52] ourselves we should not be judged judged
[1:22:55] when we when we are judged we are
[1:22:57] chastened of the lord we should not be
[1:22:59] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:23:01] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:23:03] Terry one for another and if any man
[1:23:06] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:23:08] not together into
[1:23:10] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:23:12] order when I come we do this sometimes
[1:23:14] not all the time but I want us to just
