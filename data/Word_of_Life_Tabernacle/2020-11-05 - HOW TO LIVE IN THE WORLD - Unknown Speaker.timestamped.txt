[27:28] chapter 12 and verse 32.
[27:31] it's always good to be in the house of
[27:32] the lord and
[27:34] we know that the master of the wind
[27:36] aren't you glad for that tonight
[27:39] amen luke chapter 12 and verse 32. i
[27:42] want to
[27:43] title this this evening how to live in
[27:45] the world
[27:47] and it's not evident from the title what
[27:51] i want to say
[27:54] but i just kind of these things have
[27:55] been on my heart and i'd studied on
[27:57] these things before
[27:58] this election and then
[28:02] some of the things that have happened
[28:04] you know
[28:05] um you never know what world you're
[28:08] going to wake up in from one day to the
[28:09] next
[28:10] but aren't you glad you know who's in
[28:12] charge
[28:14] we know who the king is amen we may not
[28:18] know who the president
[28:19] is going to be but we know who the king
[28:20] is tonight and so we're grateful for
[28:22] that
[28:24] i want to read luke 12 32 fear not
[28:26] little flock
[28:29] for it is your father's good pleasure
[28:32] to give you the kingdom amen aren't you
[28:34] glad for that promise tonight
[28:36] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[28:37] to the word you may be seated
[28:42] i think jesus understood what we forget
[28:46] sometimes that
[28:47] his disciples his the people who he had
[28:51] called out
[28:52] the church called out of the church
[28:54] would be an extreme minority
[28:57] in the world that they lived in an
[28:59] extreme minority
[29:01] to the point where they couldn't affect
[29:04] politics very much and
[29:06] they wouldn't be very considered
[29:10] you know when when they go and look at
[29:11] the different groups and how to pander
[29:13] to the different groups in politics they
[29:15] don't
[29:15] look much at christians and then what
[29:18] they do they look at denominational
[29:20] christians they don't look much at
[29:21] message people they don't look much it
[29:23] they didn't look much at jesus disciples
[29:25] what they thought about things or
[29:27] or whether or not they were happy with
[29:29] the way the things were going
[29:31] and jesus knew that he knew that they
[29:33] would be hated by the existing world
[29:35] order not because they were bad people
[29:38] but because they were his sheep
[29:41] right and so there would be this
[29:43] conflict between the world order and
[29:45] that's what i mean by how to live in the
[29:46] world
[29:48] that's the cosmos the world order the uh
[29:51] the way things are in the world we have
[29:53] to live in that
[29:55] and we want the best for that we want to
[29:57] see the best come from that
[29:59] and yet knowing that there's going to be
[30:00] a conflict because we don't belong to
[30:02] this world
[30:03] we're in this world but we're not of it
[30:05] we don't belong to it and and so there's
[30:08] a persecution that comes by the world
[30:10] order
[30:11] that continues to this day you go go
[30:14] back to the founding of this country it
[30:15] was originally founded because a little
[30:17] flock of
[30:18] separatists fled the persecution of the
[30:21] english church and they became known to
[30:23] history as
[30:24] the pilgrims pilgrims because they just
[30:28] went from one place to another seeking a
[30:30] city
[30:31] a place a country where they could be
[30:33] have freedom
[30:34] to worship god and
[30:37] that's not why this country exists today
[30:40] this country
[30:41] for the most part people want freedom to
[30:43] do what they want
[30:45] not freedom to worship god but that's
[30:47] why they
[30:48] will come out to begin with and and so
[30:51] someone said that a fugitive is one who
[30:53] is running from home
[30:54] a vagabond is one who has no home a
[30:57] stranger is one away from home but a
[30:59] pilgrim
[31:00] is on his way home so we're pilgrims
[31:04] tonight
[31:05] this isn't home we need to remember that
[31:09] jesus knew the corn of wheat had to fall
[31:11] on the ground and die as we talked about
[31:13] sunday and he knew
[31:14] he would have to leave his disciples in
[31:16] the midst of this world order
[31:18] would be against him and so he tells
[31:19] them this in john 14
[31:21] 19 he says yet a little while and the
[31:24] world seeth me no more
[31:26] but you see me because i live he said
[31:29] you shall live also so
[31:31] he uses that word cosmos the world the
[31:34] world order the orderly arrangement of
[31:36] things
[31:37] and brother branham says this about that
[31:39] and i won't read very many quotes
[31:40] tonight i've only got i think two
[31:43] because i've got so many scriptures so
[31:45] we want to try to get really dig into
[31:47] the scripture this evening but
[31:48] brother branham says a little while in
[31:50] the world he said there's a greek word
[31:51] cosmos which means the world order
[31:53] he said it'll sink every world
[31:56] order must sink every nation that's
[31:59] dominated by satan
[32:01] always has been he said and always will
[32:03] be he said
[32:04] outside of israel when they become a
[32:06] nation now
[32:08] branham always ties that back to luke
[32:09] chapter four and verse five
[32:11] where the devil says took jesus up into
[32:13] a high mountain and showed him
[32:15] all the kingdoms of the world in a
[32:17] moment of time
[32:18] and the devil said unto him all this
[32:20] power will i give thee
[32:22] and the glory of them he said for that
[32:25] is delivered
[32:26] unto me notice what the devil says and
[32:28] brown said jesus didn't say anything to
[32:30] him about it
[32:32] he just let him talk because this was
[32:34] the truth at that time
[32:36] but jesus knew he was coming into power
[32:40] but now he said all this power will i
[32:41] give thee in the glory of them for that
[32:43] is delivered
[32:44] unto me and to whomsoever i will give it
[32:49] and you wonder why they have trouble
[32:50] counting the votes
[32:56] right you think about it the devil is is
[32:59] in the details if you
[33:00] say it that way right i mean he's
[33:03] involved in that
[33:05] and because he is the head of the world
[33:07] order
[33:09] and the bible even talks about how that
[33:10] one nation will fight against another
[33:12] nation but the brown said the demons
[33:14] over one nation will become jealous of
[33:16] the demons over another nation
[33:18] will actually fight against one another
[33:20] and we're actually seeing that in
[33:22] in our nation that there's two spirits
[33:24] in the nation today
[33:25] they're fighting with one another right
[33:28] but we're not
[33:29] part of that and yet we recognize it's
[33:31] there
[33:32] yet we participate because again there
[33:35] could be one
[33:36] world order that's better for us to live
[33:38] in than another
[33:40] but god has control over which one it
[33:42] will happen
[33:44] right because he sees better than we see
[33:46] now
[33:47] so he said all that's delivered unto me
[33:49] and to whomsoever i will give it
[33:52] so you say the devil counts the votes
[33:55] in luke 4 and 7 that next verse he said
[33:58] if thou therefore will worship me
[34:00] all shall be thine
[34:03] in other words he might say i i rule the
[34:06] cosmos
[34:07] by permission by permission it was given
[34:10] to me
[34:12] and i i i'm going to allow you to rule
[34:14] it
[34:15] but god had to allow him to rule it
[34:19] because as powerful as the devil is he's
[34:21] not powerful enough
[34:23] to do anything without permission from
[34:25] god
[34:27] you know that that's we need to keep
[34:29] that in mind sometimes
[34:30] because you look at the things that have
[34:32] went on this year and how
[34:34] everything seems like falls apart around
[34:36] us and remember
[34:37] no matter how powerful the devil is he's
[34:39] not more powerful than god
[34:42] and he said greater is he that is in you
[34:44] than he that is in the world he always
[34:46] wins that battle right and so god
[34:50] has to allow it in psalm 75 5. he said
[34:53] lift not up your horn on high
[34:55] speak not with a stiff neck don't get
[34:57] arrogant he said
[34:59] for promotion cometh neither from the
[35:01] east nor from the west nor from the
[35:03] south
[35:04] but god is the judge he put us down one
[35:08] setteth up another in the hand of the
[35:10] lord there is a cup and the wine is red
[35:12] is full of mixture
[35:13] he pours out the same but the drugs
[35:15] thereof all the wicked of the earth
[35:17] shall bring them out and drink them so
[35:18] he said
[35:19] what's coming to them they'll get that
[35:21] but sometimes god allows an evil
[35:23] government to come
[35:25] for his own purposes
[35:28] so we have to remember that god allows
[35:30] the governments that exists the world
[35:31] order
[35:32] that exists and you know we go down we
[35:35] don't like to pay taxes i don't know
[35:36] anybody that really loves to pay taxes
[35:40] and i don't know anybody that really
[35:42] loves to to uh
[35:45] obey some of the laws that they put on
[35:46] us that are kind of petty
[35:48] and some of them are useful some are
[35:50] good but some of them are kind of petty
[35:51] but we do it anyway
[35:52] we live in this world and as long as
[35:55] they don't contradict the word of god
[35:57] we have to go along with that and we'll
[35:59] get into that later but
[36:01] god could cast that government out and
[36:02] bring in another one
[36:05] but he might not cast out a good gov or
[36:07] an evil government bringing a good one
[36:08] he might do the reverse
[36:11] god might allow that right
[36:15] and because for his own purposes look at
[36:18] what he did
[36:19] you know israel was god's people and
[36:21] israel sinned against god and if you
[36:23] look at their captivity with
[36:24] nebuchadnezzar
[36:26] nebuchadnezzar was chosen by god to take
[36:29] israel in captivity
[36:31] you go look in the book of jeremiah and
[36:32] he talks about how he was chosen by god
[36:34] to do that
[36:36] but in daniel chapter 2 and you can read
[36:38] the whole thing maybe later but in
[36:40] daniel chapter two
[36:42] nebuchadnezzar is having his dream of
[36:44] these gentile world orders
[36:45] and daniel says this he said he changes
[36:48] speaking of god he changes the times and
[36:50] the seasons
[36:52] he removeth kings and setteth up kings
[36:56] he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[36:58] knowledge to them
[36:59] that no understanding god does that
[37:04] nebuchadnezzar had a dream of a tree
[37:06] that lifted up to the heavens and it was
[37:07] so beautiful
[37:08] and an angelic being he calls a watcher
[37:10] comes down and
[37:11] cuts it says cut it down and
[37:15] why is that in daniel 4 17
[37:18] nebuchadnezzar is telling his dream he
[37:19] said this matters by the decree of the
[37:21] watchers and
[37:22] the demand by the word of the holy ones
[37:24] to the intent that the living may know
[37:26] that the most high ruleth in the kingdom
[37:28] of men
[37:29] and giveth it to whomsoever he will and
[37:31] set us up over at the basest of men
[37:34] whereas god can bring someone out of out
[37:36] of nowhere and make him president make
[37:38] him king make him a ruler
[37:41] right god does that and nebuchadnezzar
[37:45] got lifted up
[37:47] and he warned him daniel warned him it
[37:49] would happen but he got lifted up and he
[37:50] walked out one day and looked around and
[37:52] said well
[37:52] things look pretty good i'm a great king
[37:55] and a voice spoke to him and said you're
[37:57] going to lose your mind
[38:00] and he lost his mind for a season lived
[38:02] like an animal
[38:03] out in the desert just so god could
[38:06] remind him who was in charge
[38:09] and we don't know that nebuchadnezzar
[38:11] was ever a christian
[38:12] at times he sympathized with daniel and
[38:14] put him up over the other princes and
[38:16] things but he
[38:17] he was never a godly man he still
[38:20] worshipped his idols and those things
[38:21] but god used him
[38:23] right and god can do that and and we can
[38:25] extrapolate that down to more than just
[38:28] governments more than just presidents
[38:29] but even you you've had
[38:31] maybe a boss at some point in your life
[38:33] that was a real help to you
[38:35] or someone that gave you a lot of
[38:36] trouble god allowed them to be there
[38:41] and you think of the story of david how
[38:42] that the man just happened to be the
[38:44] other side of the road and was throwing
[38:45] rocks at him and he said maybe
[38:47] maybe god told him to do that huh
[38:50] maybe the lord told him to do that and
[38:53] brother branham went through a similar
[38:54] experience and we go through that
[38:55] sometimes
[38:57] maybe god allowed us to be in the
[38:58] situation that we're in but remember
[39:00] it's he's got it in control
[39:03] see his election doesn't doesn't have
[39:06] you don't have to count no votes he
[39:07] already counted the votes
[39:09] and then when we were elected by god he
[39:12] already knew you before the foundation
[39:13] of the world he don't have any more
[39:14] counting to do
[39:16] he doesn't have to wait and and see
[39:18] who's going to win we know who's going
[39:20] to win
[39:22] so he said fear not little flop
[39:26] you look at belshazzar and darius who
[39:28] come in after
[39:29] nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar was
[39:33] giving the party as we know and then the
[39:35] the hand coming wrote on the wall
[39:38] and in daniel 5 18 daniel is
[39:40] interpreting it to him he says oh thou
[39:42] king the most high god gave
[39:44] nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom
[39:46] and majesty and glory and honor and for
[39:49] the majesty that he gave him all people
[39:51] nations and languages trembled and
[39:53] feared before him
[39:54] he says whom he would he slew and whom
[39:57] he would he kept alive
[39:59] whom he would he set up and whom he
[40:00] would he put down
[40:02] so he was a powerful king one of the
[40:05] most powerful kings that had ever been
[40:06] up to that time
[40:08] but god let him do that
[40:12] god let him do that
[40:15] but when his heart was lifted up and his
[40:18] mind
[40:19] hardened in pride he was deposed from
[40:21] his kingly throne
[40:23] and they took his glory from him it was
[40:25] driven from the sons of men his heart
[40:27] was made like the beast as well and was
[40:28] with the wild asses they fed him with
[40:30] the grass like ox and his body was wet
[40:31] with the dew of heaven
[40:33] he knew that the most high god ruled in
[40:34] the kingdom of men
[40:36] and that he appointed over it whosoever
[40:38] he will
[40:40] so nebuchadnezzar said i can set up
[40:42] whoever i want to he wasn't just a king
[40:45] the title for those kings was the king
[40:47] of kings
[40:48] so they called themselves the king of
[40:50] kings because they weren't just
[40:52] a king they were the king over an empire
[40:55] but here he said god appoints over at
[40:58] whomsoever he will
[41:00] and thou his son obelisar has not
[41:02] humbled thine heart
[41:03] though thou knowest all this but it's
[41:05] lifted up thyself against the lord of
[41:07] heaven they brought the vessels of his
[41:08] house before thee
[41:09] thou and thy lords and concubines have
[41:12] drunk wine in them and
[41:13] he talks about it and he says whose are
[41:15] all thy ways has
[41:16] not glorified in verse 24 he said then
[41:19] was the part of the hand sent from him
[41:21] and this
[41:21] writing was written and this is the
[41:24] writing that was written
[41:25] me nae mine tikel of farsin
[41:28] and this is the interpretation of the
[41:30] thing mene god
[41:31] numbered thy kingdom and finished it
[41:35] god counted some votes
[41:39] he says your weight in the balance is
[41:40] verse 27 aren't found wanting
[41:42] my kingdom is divided and given to the
[41:45] medes
[41:46] and persians and then belshazzar
[41:49] evidently decided he was going to
[41:50] prevent this from happening by making
[41:52] daniel rich
[41:54] and powerful and he did he made him the
[41:56] third ruler in the kingdom in verse 29
[41:58] but in verse 30 and that night
[42:00] was are the king of the chaldean slain
[42:04] that night and darius the median took
[42:06] the kingdom being about three score and
[42:08] two years old if you go back and look at
[42:09] that's when
[42:10] the medes and persians come in when
[42:11] cyrus come in and darius come in
[42:13] and they come in you know the walls of
[42:16] babylon were so high that nobody could
[42:18] even
[42:19] overcome them and history says that the
[42:21] babylonians
[42:22] laughed and continued their party
[42:26] when cyrus come to the gates and what he
[42:28] did is he just
[42:30] went through the water duct and come
[42:33] into the city
[42:34] who gave him the wisdom to do that god
[42:38] did
[42:39] right he stole the election we could say
[42:41] it that way
[42:43] right and i want us to take note because
[42:46] these things have happened before
[42:48] right we don't know what's going to
[42:49] happen tomorrow who's going to be
[42:50] president even and
[42:51] all those things you don't know what's
[42:52] going to happen but god knows
[42:55] hey man aren't you glad that he knows
[42:58] you don't know tomorrow you might you
[42:59] might be struck with some disease you
[43:01] might have some problem you might have
[43:02] an accident of some kind god forbid
[43:04] that that would happen but but you might
[43:06] you don't know what what tomorrow holds
[43:08] but you know
[43:08] who holds tomorrow and i know that all
[43:11] things work
[43:12] together for the good and then to love
[43:13] god who are called according to his
[43:14] purpose do we
[43:15] really believe that tonight amen
[43:20] so darius become king and
[43:24] cyrus was a king in isaiah 45 and 1. i
[43:27] love
[43:28] this is 150 years before cyrus took
[43:31] babylon
[43:32] and he says this he said thus saith the
[43:35] lord to his anointed desires whose right
[43:37] hand i have holden
[43:38] in other words i gave him his power to
[43:41] subdue nations before him
[43:43] i will loose the loins of kings to open
[43:45] up up before him the two leave the gates
[43:47] and the gates shall not be shut
[43:48] where the gates of babylon were closed
[43:50] to him but he just went in a different
[43:51] way
[43:52] god gave him the ability to do that he
[43:54] said i will go before thee make the
[43:55] crooked places straight
[43:56] i will break in pieces the gates of
[43:58] brass cuttings under the bars of iron i
[44:00] will give you the treasures of darkness
[44:02] hidden riches of secret places
[44:04] that thou mayest know that i the lord
[44:05] which called thee by thy name and the
[44:07] god of israel
[44:08] listen for whose sake for jacob my
[44:11] servants say
[44:12] and israel might elect amen
[44:16] i have even called thee by name i have
[44:18] surnamed thee though though has not
[44:20] known me so
[44:21] 150 years before he ever took the city
[44:24] he said i know who you are
[44:26] and it's going to be my power that
[44:28] allows you to do that he said i am the
[44:29] lord there's none else there's no god
[44:31] beside me
[44:31] i girded thee though that has not known
[44:33] me that they may know from the rising of
[44:36] the sun and from the west that there is
[44:37] none beside me
[44:39] i am the lord and there's none else do
[44:41] we believe that tonight
[44:42] he said i form the light and create
[44:45] darkness
[44:46] i make peace and create evil that word
[44:48] is calamity
[44:49] it's not that god creates sin but but he
[44:52] allows calamity to come
[44:54] i the lord do all these things
[44:58] amen you say well that's the old
[45:01] testament but look
[45:02] and there's a new testament example of
[45:04] god intervening
[45:06] in a king's life in acts chapter 12
[45:09] verse 21 herod the king
[45:11] you know it's strange that herod was
[45:14] allowed
[45:15] to do what he did to jesus and god
[45:18] didn't do anything
[45:21] the kings were allowed to do all the
[45:23] things pilate was allowed to do what he
[45:25] did nothing happened to him right away
[45:28] but now here a little while later he
[45:29] comes up and sits on his throne and
[45:31] begins to speak
[45:33] and then people gave a shout saying it's
[45:34] the voice of god not of a man
[45:36] which is a dangerous thing it's idolatry
[45:39] in verse 23 and immediately the angel
[45:41] the lord smote him because he gave not
[45:43] god the glory
[45:45] and he was eaten of worms and gave up
[45:47] the ghost
[45:48] but i love this next verse but the word
[45:50] of god grew
[45:52] and multiplied
[45:55] here's a king that was there god he
[45:57] served his purpose and he
[45:58] became arrogant and god brought him down
[46:02] right he was there he served his purpose
[46:03] become arrogant god brought him down but
[46:05] the word
[46:06] grew and multiplied and somehow while
[46:09] we're still here with isaac there has to
[46:11] be
[46:11] a people who can take advantage of that
[46:13] and say i'm not here i'm not subject
[46:16] in the sense of this political system
[46:18] doesn't own me
[46:19] but i'm going to use this as an
[46:21] opportunity as brother branham prayed if
[46:22] god gives us
[46:23] a few more years then let's take that to
[46:25] win souls for christ
[46:29] and if he doesn't then it's the end
[46:32] right now the devil so the devil is
[46:36] under permission
[46:36] but god does this he will he's not
[46:40] he doesn't have to seek permission from
[46:41] anybody not even us
[46:45] and we know that this nation this world
[46:47] order that we're in today this american
[46:49] world order
[46:50] will come down just like herod come down
[46:53] like nebuchadnezzar come down like
[46:55] belchers are come down darius come down
[46:57] all these others come down because this
[46:59] is the final
[47:01] of those gentile if you think about it
[47:03] the iron in the clay
[47:04] that's the the finality of the gentile
[47:06] world order
[47:07] is smitten by the stone that was made
[47:09] without hands daniel 2 42 let's just go
[47:12] there
[47:12] he said as the toes of the feet were
[47:14] part of iron part of clay
[47:16] so the kingdom should be partly strong
[47:18] and partly broken
[47:19] and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with
[47:21] miry clay they shall mingle themselves
[47:23] with the seed of men
[47:24] but they shall not cleave one to another
[47:26] even as iron is not mixed with clay and
[47:28] you remember
[47:29] random talked about khrushchev and
[47:30] eisenhower eisenhower means iron
[47:32] khrushchev means clay
[47:34] they won't cleave to one another but
[47:36] listen they're they're a world power
[47:38] together capitalism and communism
[47:42] together
[47:44] right is a world power a world order
[47:46] today
[47:48] and in the days of those kings it says
[47:51] in the days of these kings so the god of
[47:53] heaven set up a kingdom
[47:55] which shall never be destroyed and the
[47:57] kingdom shall not be left to other
[47:59] people
[47:59] but it shall break in pieces now think
[48:03] about that
[48:04] brother brown sees the fulfillment of
[48:05] that and the iron and the clay and the
[48:07] toast and the
[48:08] and daniel says the kingdom won't be
[48:10] left to other people
[48:12] so we're living in the last gentile
[48:13] world order
[48:16] this is it right the kingdom won't be
[48:19] left to other people but it shall break
[48:20] in pieces and consume
[48:22] all these kingdoms and it shall stand
[48:24] forever for as much
[48:26] as i saw us that the stone was cut out
[48:27] of the mountain without hands that break
[48:29] in pieces the iron the brass the clay
[48:31] the silver and the gold
[48:32] the great god hath made known to the
[48:33] king what shall come to pass thereafter
[48:35] and the dream is certain
[48:37] and the interpretation thereof sure
[48:40] amen it's got to happen and we could
[48:44] approach that many different ways the
[48:45] beasts and all these things the image to
[48:47] be
[48:47] all of these things we could approach
[48:49] that but we'll leave that alone for
[48:50] tonight now
[48:51] so the communist capitalist system these
[48:54] two systems come together the church and
[48:55] the state whatever you want to call it
[48:57] comes together and it never cleaves to
[49:00] one another
[49:02] but it will be destroyed together
[49:05] right and brother madam even talks about
[49:07] one destroying the other now
[49:08] paul teaches us what our attitudes
[49:11] towards these gentile powers will be
[49:13] because these are the powers that rule
[49:15] today
[49:17] what should our attitude be towards the
[49:19] powers that be i'm going to get into
[49:21] brother jt's favorite scripture
[49:24] romans chapter 13. years ago i
[49:27] was doing a series on romans and barack
[49:30] obama had just been elected as president
[49:32] i believe
[49:34] and uh brother jt wasn't too happy about
[49:36] that if i remember correctly and
[49:38] and i preached on this and this this
[49:41] romans chapter 13
[49:43] and he would always remembered that and
[49:44] i don't know why but
[49:47] he said let every soul be subject under
[49:49] the higher powers
[49:51] now so again how do we live in this
[49:53] world
[49:54] well he tells us how to live in this
[49:56] world what should our reaction be
[49:59] specifically to a change of powers
[50:02] or to a continuation of powers to
[50:04] whoever the powers
[50:06] are so he says there there is no power
[50:09] but of god
[50:10] the powers that be that's the powers
[50:12] that exist now
[50:15] are ordained of god
[50:18] right that is literally powers is the
[50:21] word means literally the existing order
[50:23] of things
[50:25] so paul legitimizes the authority and
[50:27] civil matters of that existing
[50:29] government
[50:30] that existing government was pagan rome
[50:34] now there's times you can't obey
[50:37] the current powers i just want to get
[50:39] into this because i think it's important
[50:41] there's some things you just can't do
[50:43] right if they tell us we have to
[50:45] bring two men here and allow them to
[50:46] marry here in the church we can't do
[50:48] that
[50:49] right we can't do that there's things
[50:51] that we can't do
[50:53] but there is everything that we can do
[50:56] we do why because the bible tells us to
[51:00] do that
[51:01] now brother branham are
[51:05] actually i looked at this in in history
[51:08] and it was not that there was a question
[51:11] that
[51:11] whether they should obey a magistrate
[51:14] but what they were saying is should they
[51:15] ever obey
[51:17] a power they were not saying well
[51:19] there's sometimes they do
[51:20] forces to do things that aren't right
[51:21] but they were saying we're christians
[51:23] why should we ever obey a roman power
[51:26] right and the apostle says yes we should
[51:30] because god has made government
[51:31] necessary he was arranged and ordered by
[51:33] his providence
[51:35] and there was something else going on
[51:37] during that time in history that
[51:39] during that time one emperor followed
[51:40] another in rapid succession you think
[51:42] we've got it bad now
[51:44] you ought to go back to first century
[51:46] rome
[51:48] right because one they had the stability
[51:50] of the uh the relative stability of the
[51:53] um the republic for so many hundreds of
[51:56] years
[51:57] longer the republic of rome lasted much
[51:59] longer than our democracy has
[52:02] and then at the end of that it just
[52:04] became dog-eat-dog
[52:06] the strongest man wins so whoever could
[52:10] kill the most people
[52:12] literally that's how they did it whoever
[52:15] could kill the most people actually
[52:16] become the emperor
[52:18] now you talk about a bad a bad time
[52:21] and there were all kinds of people in
[52:23] all kinds of
[52:24] ways trying to overthrow the government
[52:27] so you think politics are bad now
[52:29] back then everybody carried a dagger one
[52:31] to kill caesar
[52:34] right and so they're always there's all
[52:36] kinds of palace intrigue everything is
[52:37] going on the jews are in the romans and
[52:40] all the
[52:40] other ethnic groups out in the in the
[52:42] empire all
[52:43] want to override one another and paul
[52:46] says don't be a part of that
[52:48] the powers that be are ordained of god
[52:50] don't try to change the government
[52:53] right now he's not saying don't vote
[52:56] and get that out of the way real quick
[52:58] but don't try to go out and change the
[53:00] government by force
[53:02] and so there was a prevalent disposition
[53:05] in that time to rebel against
[53:06] tyranny because the emperor claudius had
[53:09] been put to death by poison
[53:11] caligula was put to death in a violent
[53:13] manner nero was a tyrant
[53:16] and amidst these agitations crimes
[53:18] revolutions the apostle
[53:20] wanted to guard christians from taking
[53:21] an active part
[53:23] in those political affairs don't be a
[53:26] part of that
[53:28] now we're coming to a place in this
[53:31] country where
[53:33] if if the country continues like it is
[53:35] people are mad enough that each other
[53:37] there could be civil war
[53:39] don't be a part of that see it's what he
[53:42] says the powers that be ordinated of god
[53:44] we don't go to overthrow the government
[53:47] right now seven years after paul wrote
[53:51] this the great persecution under nero
[53:53] began
[53:55] and there was a roman uh historian named
[53:58] tacitus and he was a young boy living in
[53:59] rome during the time of the persecutions
[54:01] and he wrote this
[54:03] and there had been a fire a great fire
[54:05] in rome and
[54:06] and there was a rumor that nero himself
[54:09] set rome
[54:10] on fire because he wanted to build his
[54:11] palace there which is what he did
[54:14] but he because he was charged with that
[54:16] he decided to charge the christians
[54:18] with that and during that time paul is
[54:21] living in rome
[54:22] under house arrest so
[54:25] he begins to charge the christians with
[54:28] these crimes and and historians believe
[54:30] that's when paul had his head cut off
[54:32] because he was one of the christians the
[54:34] leader of the christian so it would be a
[54:35] great
[54:36] thing for them to do that and so this
[54:40] roman historian began to write and he
[54:42] wrote this he said in their very deaths
[54:45] they were made the subjects of sport
[54:47] he's speaking of the christians
[54:49] they were covered with the heights of
[54:51] wild beasts and worried to death by dogs
[54:53] or nailed the crosses or set fire to
[54:57] when the day waned burnt to serve for
[55:00] the evening lights
[55:02] that's history nero who was the power
[55:06] that was the power that existed took
[55:09] christians stuck him on a pole
[55:11] covered him with tar and burnt them as
[55:12] lights in his garden
[55:16] that's hard to believe isn't it you know
[55:19] it could be worse
[55:21] thank god for the country that we do
[55:23] have
[55:25] huh not to say it couldn't get worse
[55:28] here
[55:29] but look i i really believe we're going
[55:31] home
[55:32] we're not going to go through that again
[55:34] we're going home now
[55:36] he would do that and he would stand
[55:37] there and and make support of them and
[55:39] even actually go out and kill people
[55:40] himself
[55:42] he was he was probably he's in the
[55:44] running for the worst
[55:45] leader of any kind in history
[55:49] paul lost his head to him a few years
[55:52] after this is written
[55:54] and paul says let every soul be subject
[55:55] to the higher powers and make you think
[55:57] won't it
[55:59] whoever therefore resisteth the power
[56:01] resisted the ordinance of god
[56:04] they that resist shall receive to
[56:05] themselves damnation
[56:07] he said for rulers are not a terror to
[56:10] good works but to the evil without them
[56:11] be afraid of the power
[56:13] do that which is good and i shall have
[56:14] praise are the same
[56:16] he said free is the minister of god to
[56:17] thee for good but if thou do that which
[56:19] is evil be afraid
[56:20] he beareth not the sword in vain he's
[56:22] the minister of god or avenger
[56:24] execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
[56:25] again in most cases if you follow the
[56:28] law you'll be left alone
[56:30] but not all because christians must
[56:31] suffer persecution
[56:35] he said wherefore you must need to be
[56:36] subject not only for wrath not because
[56:38] you get in trouble but also for
[56:39] conscience sake
[56:40] not because you might get a ticket but
[56:42] because it's the right thing to do
[56:44] he said for this cause pay your taxes
[56:49] so he says pay you tribute that word
[56:50] means taxes
[56:52] also he said they are god's ministers
[56:54] attending continually upon this very
[56:56] thing
[56:58] render therefore to all their dues
[56:59] tribute to whom tributes do custom to
[57:01] whom custom
[57:02] fear to whom fear honor to whom honor
[57:06] you look at that and think how can you
[57:08] respect a man like that but you know
[57:10] what paul did
[57:12] paul used the political system that
[57:15] existed the powers that be
[57:17] to promote the gospel he walked on the
[57:20] roads
[57:22] right that was during that time was the
[57:24] safest time in history until the last
[57:25] 100 years to travel
[57:27] because they built the roads and the
[57:29] army stood at the walls and
[57:31] they kept people robbers and things so
[57:33] paul was able to travel freely
[57:35] not only that but when he went into
[57:37] jerusalem and got into trouble he
[57:38] appealed to caesar
[57:40] that was his political right as a roman
[57:42] citizen
[57:43] he said i'm a citizen i'm appealing to
[57:46] caesar for what purpose
[57:48] not to free himself nero wasn't the kind
[57:51] of man that had pity on people
[57:54] he appealed to caesar he appealed to
[57:56] nero specifically
[57:59] because he wanted to preach the gospel
[58:00] to him
[58:03] think about that and so we we have to
[58:06] change our mindset from
[58:07] just being affected by politics to
[58:09] actually using
[58:10] the opportunity that we have to preach
[58:13] the gospel
[58:14] whatever that is if we're given freedom
[58:16] let's use it while we have it
[58:18] because we may not have it forever let's
[58:21] take advantage of this
[58:22] and and make sure that we're doing
[58:24] everything we can so that this gospel is
[58:26] preached in all nations now
[58:28] and again it doesn't mean that one might
[58:30] be better than another
[58:32] brother brandon mentioned three
[58:33] presidents you would be honored to have
[58:34] come to your house he mentions dwight
[58:36] eisenhower john kennedy
[58:37] lyndon johnson i have my own views about
[58:40] who's better out of that bunch
[58:46] and the latter two john kennedy linda
[58:49] johnson history says they weren't very
[58:50] good people just just as moral morally
[58:52] they were very
[58:54] not very good people but brother brown
[58:57] said if they come to your house
[58:58] and you were an american you would honor
[58:59] that
[59:01] he said though you might differ in
[59:03] politics again one might be far better
[59:05] than another you might vote for one over
[59:07] the other brother branham said he did
[59:09] just like augustus would have been
[59:11] better than nero nobody in their right
[59:12] mind would vote in nero
[59:15] right no christian is going to go if he
[59:16] had a vote if he had an ability to
[59:18] affect in any way he's not going to vote
[59:19] in nero
[59:21] but they're still run by the devil
[59:24] by permission from and ordained by god
[59:30] aren't you glad he's got it all in
[59:32] control you see we're not
[59:34] subject to the world order because we're
[59:36] its subjects
[59:37] we're subject to the world order because
[59:39] it is ordained by god
[59:41] or allowed by god to be
[59:45] we're not of this cosmos jesus said this
[59:47] about his disciples
[59:48] he said in john 17 9 i pray for them
[59:51] i pray not for the world the world order
[59:56] and i pray for them aren't you glad he
[59:58] prayed for you
[1:00:01] don't you feel good sister victoria when
[1:00:03] somebody's praying for you
[1:00:05] but he said i pray for them
[1:00:08] not only them only but those who believe
[1:00:10] on me through their word he said
[1:00:13] i pray for them i don't pray for the
[1:00:15] cosmos but for them
[1:00:16] which thou has given me for they are
[1:00:18] thine
[1:00:20] hallelujah these are special
[1:00:23] these may be insignificant to the world
[1:00:26] but they're special listen to me church
[1:00:27] you're special to god
[1:00:29] you may be insignificant to the world
[1:00:31] you may be insignificant at work you may
[1:00:33] be insignificant
[1:00:34] even in the church but you're special to
[1:00:36] god
[1:00:37] these are special he said all mine are
[1:00:40] thine
[1:00:40] and behind her mind and i am glorified
[1:00:42] in them
[1:00:44] he said and now i am no more in the
[1:00:46] world i'm not subject to this world
[1:00:48] order
[1:00:49] but these are in the world so he's
[1:00:51] leaving
[1:00:53] he's committing himself to death burial
[1:00:55] and resurrection he said and i come to
[1:00:56] thee holy father
[1:00:58] keep through thine own name those whom
[1:01:01] thou hast given me
[1:01:03] that they may be one as we are
[1:01:07] you know the sermon brother brandon
[1:01:09] preached that on oneness
[1:01:11] john 17 12 while i was with them the
[1:01:13] world i kept them in thy name
[1:01:16] those that thou gavest me i have kept
[1:01:18] and none
[1:01:20] i like that regardless what the world
[1:01:22] order did none of them is lost
[1:01:25] but the son of perdition that the
[1:01:27] scripture might be fulfilled
[1:01:30] none would be an insult to his character
[1:01:33] to accuse him of losing one of the elect
[1:01:37] he never loses politicians like to be
[1:01:41] winners
[1:01:42] jesus never lost
[1:01:46] john 17 13 says now i come out to thee
[1:01:48] and these things i speak in the world
[1:01:50] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:01:52] themselves
[1:01:54] speaking of that little flock he said i
[1:01:55] have given them thy word
[1:01:57] and the world hath hated them because
[1:01:59] they are not of the world
[1:02:01] even as i am not of the world why do
[1:02:03] they hate you because you're not a part
[1:02:05] of that cosmos
[1:02:07] you're not a subject of that cosmos
[1:02:09] verse 15 i pray not
[1:02:10] that thou should have taken them out of
[1:02:12] the world but that thou should escape
[1:02:14] them from the evil
[1:02:17] so in other words they're going to have
[1:02:18] to live here they're going to have to
[1:02:19] pay their taxes they're going to have to
[1:02:20] vote
[1:02:22] or they have the opportunity to vote if
[1:02:24] it's a democracy
[1:02:26] don't take them out of the world let
[1:02:29] paul
[1:02:30] demand his right as a citizen to appear
[1:02:32] before the emperor
[1:02:34] don't take them out of the world keep
[1:02:37] them from the evil
[1:02:39] oh my brother branham did say this and
[1:02:43] questions answers on the seals he they
[1:02:45] told him are asking the question should
[1:02:46] evangelists continue on the field
[1:02:49] he said in this hour of course what they
[1:02:51] mean certainly by all means don't change
[1:02:52] a thing
[1:02:54] he said if jesus is coming in the
[1:02:55] morning preach today like it was going
[1:02:56] to be 10 years from today
[1:02:58] he said but live like it's going to be
[1:03:00] at this hour and this is what i want to
[1:03:02] get to he said don't get scrupled up now
[1:03:05] that's what i'm trying to warn you about
[1:03:06] see just don't be odd peculiar
[1:03:09] don't change nothing jesus said don't
[1:03:11] take him out of the world
[1:03:12] he said but if you're doing something
[1:03:14] wrong or doing evil repent
[1:03:16] see come back to god continue on your
[1:03:18] evangelistic service
[1:03:19] just as you always did again what did
[1:03:21] paul do he used the world order that
[1:03:24] existed
[1:03:24] to promote the gospel john 17 16 they
[1:03:28] are not of the world
[1:03:30] even as i am not of the world sanctify
[1:03:33] them through thy truth
[1:03:34] thy word is truth in other words set
[1:03:36] them apart for service
[1:03:39] verse 18 as thou hast sent me into the
[1:03:40] world even so have i also
[1:03:43] sent them into the world notice he
[1:03:46] didn't send them out of the world he
[1:03:47] sent them into the world
[1:03:50] right and that's why i think it's a
[1:03:51] mistake when people hide from the
[1:03:53] community
[1:03:55] we're sent into the world for good or
[1:03:56] bad there's nothing we preach here that
[1:03:59] the world can't know
[1:04:01] or can't hear all right that's what paul
[1:04:04] believed
[1:04:05] paul goes to the foremost center of
[1:04:07] learning in that day maybe the oxford
[1:04:09] university of the day
[1:04:10] was mars hill in athens and he walks up
[1:04:13] there and he begins to preach to those
[1:04:15] people about an unknown god
[1:04:19] why because he even quoted some of their
[1:04:21] own poets to him because there was
[1:04:22] nothing that paul said
[1:04:24] he may have been persecuted for it sure
[1:04:26] sure you'll you'll get persecution for
[1:04:28] it but there's nothing that we have what
[1:04:29] we have they need
[1:04:31] right we don't have to hide it from them
[1:04:33] go off build a church somewhere way out
[1:04:34] in the woods where nobody can find us
[1:04:36] and
[1:04:36] with no windows and clothes off to
[1:04:38] everything no what we have the world
[1:04:40] needs
[1:04:43] and so i want to take every opportunity
[1:04:45] and people question sometimes what we do
[1:04:46] but i want to take every opportunity
[1:04:48] that i have to present
[1:04:50] christ to the world and for you maybe
[1:04:51] that'll just be the way you live
[1:04:53] but present christ to the world use this
[1:04:56] system if you have to work if you have
[1:04:57] to do that
[1:04:58] i know sometimes we have to do things
[1:04:59] that aren't that aren't perfect
[1:05:01] we wish we didn't have to work as much
[1:05:03] as we did sometimes maybe you have to
[1:05:04] work instead of
[1:05:06] and you wish you could be at church
[1:05:07] sometimes you wish you could do certain
[1:05:08] things but
[1:05:10] use the political system don't let it
[1:05:12] come and bring you away from the word
[1:05:14] but use it to promote the gospel
[1:05:19] walk up there to pay those taxes with a
[1:05:21] smile on your face
[1:05:27] it's hard to do isn't it
[1:05:33] i may not preach that way after this
[1:05:34] next year and get my tax bill but
[1:05:36] it's easier to preach oh at the end of
[1:05:38] the year instead of in april
[1:05:43] he becomes subject to the world order
[1:05:44] for the purpose of redemption that's
[1:05:46] what he did
[1:05:47] now think about this for a moment i know
[1:05:48] it's kind of slow and dry tonight you
[1:05:50] forgive me
[1:05:52] but what did jesus do jesus come down
[1:05:54] into the cosmos
[1:05:56] made himself subject to the world order
[1:06:01] even the very fact that he was born in
[1:06:02] bethlehem was because caesar
[1:06:04] ordered the whole world to be taxed made
[1:06:07] himself subject
[1:06:08] census was going on account of the
[1:06:11] people and he made himself subject to
[1:06:13] that
[1:06:13] come down on the body in a form of a
[1:06:15] baby
[1:06:17] out himself to be subject to the powers
[1:06:19] that be
[1:06:20] and even when they ask him what you have
[1:06:22] to pay your taxes he said yes
[1:06:24] this sermon is not about paying taxes
[1:06:25] brother helen forgive me
[1:06:29] but but he took the remember he got the
[1:06:32] fish he had peter fish and he pulled the
[1:06:34] fish out of the sea it's got a coin in
[1:06:35] his mouth he said
[1:06:36] whose image is on it he says caesar's
[1:06:38] give to caesar what's caesar's
[1:06:40] give to god what's god's the second part
[1:06:43] is what we have to really remember
[1:06:46] but he said i sent them into the world
[1:06:48] he sent us into the world
[1:06:50] he came into the world he said as you
[1:06:53] have sent me into the world i have sent
[1:06:54] them into the world to what to become
[1:06:57] subject to the world order for the
[1:06:58] purpose of redemption
[1:07:00] amen i've sent them into the world to be
[1:07:03] a public testimony
[1:07:06] they won't react like the world does
[1:07:08] their candidate loses they don't go burn
[1:07:10] buildings
[1:07:12] huh they don't react like the world does
[1:07:15] they don't
[1:07:16] they don't involve themselves in the
[1:07:17] things of the world but they're they're
[1:07:19] a
[1:07:19] shining light a city set on a hill that
[1:07:21] cannot be hid
[1:07:23] their lives will be a public testimony
[1:07:25] he said like mine was
[1:07:27] amen like jesus was paul told agrippa
[1:07:31] when he come and stood before him as he
[1:07:33] was on his way to caesar
[1:07:34] it was like an appeals court before you
[1:07:36] would go on to to the emperor
[1:07:39] and in acts 26 26 he said for the king
[1:07:41] knoweth of these things
[1:07:42] before whom also i speak freely for i am
[1:07:46] persuaded
[1:07:46] that none of these things are hidden
[1:07:48] from him for this thing was not done in
[1:07:50] a corner
[1:07:52] brother branham taught us and you can go
[1:07:54] look up the quotes but he said it's not
[1:07:55] shut up inside somewhere
[1:07:57] the whole world knows these things are
[1:07:58] going on he said the world is known the
[1:08:01] episcopalians the catholic the lutheran
[1:08:02] the denomination
[1:08:03] they knew that there's a god that works
[1:08:05] in his word in this day
[1:08:08] he said and keeps his signs and wonders
[1:08:10] moving it's not he said shut up in a
[1:08:12] corner
[1:08:13] another place he said oh it's not done
[1:08:14] in a corner he said it's only darkened
[1:08:16] conscience he said that's why the
[1:08:18] scientists couldn't even
[1:08:20] see that that was the face of christ
[1:08:23] they had to turn it a different
[1:08:24] direction they said what is it but they
[1:08:26] couldn't see
[1:08:27] and it was evident to us because a
[1:08:30] prophet come and made it evident
[1:08:33] right but he said it wasn't shut up in a
[1:08:34] corner they know but their conscience is
[1:08:36] darkened
[1:08:37] but they have to hear matthew 24 14 this
[1:08:40] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[1:08:42] in all the world
[1:08:43] and all the world order for a witness
[1:08:45] unto all nations and then shall the
[1:08:47] income
[1:08:51] don't be saddened by the world order use
[1:08:54] it as an opportunity to preach the
[1:08:56] gospel
[1:08:58] we don't have to be ashamed to publicly
[1:08:59] live and preach what we believe
[1:09:01] not ashamed paul says of the gospel of
[1:09:03] christ for the power of god and the
[1:09:05] salvation to everyone that believeth
[1:09:07] world order in acts 5 29 tried to
[1:09:09] command
[1:09:11] the apostles not to speak in jesus name
[1:09:13] and they said this
[1:09:14] he said we ought to obey god rather than
[1:09:16] men
[1:09:17] now watch here's something different
[1:09:19] when do you not obey the
[1:09:21] powers that be when they try to get you
[1:09:23] to quit
[1:09:24] preaching the gospel
[1:09:27] these governments have their place but
[1:09:28] jesus is king
[1:09:31] when is he going to be king he's already
[1:09:33] king
[1:09:34] amen he was already king he was king
[1:09:38] when he was laying in a manger he was
[1:09:39] king when he was on the cross
[1:09:41] he was king when he was laid in the
[1:09:43] grave he was king when he rose again but
[1:09:44] one day
[1:09:45] he was sit on the throne on the earth
[1:09:49] sit on the throne of david he'll be king
[1:09:53] in the earth and every kneel bound every
[1:09:54] tongue will confess
[1:09:56] luke 1 32 speaking of him when he was
[1:09:58] born he said he shall be great shall be
[1:09:59] called the son of the highest the lord
[1:10:01] god shall give unto him the throne of
[1:10:02] his father david
[1:10:03] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:10:04] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[1:10:06] shall be no end
[1:10:08] aren't you glad for that kingdoms come
[1:10:11] and go they
[1:10:12] always have they always will
[1:10:15] political systems rise and fall 10 years
[1:10:18] 20 years we'll be talking about
[1:10:20] something
[1:10:20] completely different as far as political
[1:10:23] systems go
[1:10:25] but look it looked like it was all over
[1:10:29] it looked like when he died and his
[1:10:31] disciples ran away it looks like
[1:10:32] in some ways it's all over today looks
[1:10:35] like there's not much going on
[1:10:36] it may even seem to some that the word
[1:10:38] has failed
[1:10:40] but he said not one word would go out
[1:10:42] void
[1:10:43] what has he come to tell us today fear
[1:10:45] not little flock
[1:10:49] there won't come a day when the king
[1:10:50] will come there will be no power but his
[1:10:54] he puts up with this right now but he
[1:10:56] said he's got a cup in his
[1:10:58] hand and he's gonna he's gonna feed the
[1:11:00] wicked the dregs out of the cup
[1:11:04] revelations 11 15 here we find when the
[1:11:06] seventh trumpeting angel sounds the
[1:11:08] seventh angel sounded there were great
[1:11:09] voices in heaven
[1:11:10] saying the kingdoms of this world are
[1:11:12] become the kingdoms of our lord of his
[1:11:14] christ and he shall reign
[1:11:15] how long forever and ever not for four
[1:11:19] years not for eight years not for 25
[1:11:20] years
[1:11:21] forever and ever listen brother brown
[1:11:24] says
[1:11:25] in revelation chapter 5 he said
[1:11:26] hallelujah one of these days
[1:11:28] the kingdoms of this world will fall and
[1:11:30] the legal owners
[1:11:32] will come in one of these days
[1:11:35] amen the legal owners will come in who's
[1:11:38] he talking about
[1:11:39] fear not little amen
[1:11:42] it's your father's pleasure it pleases
[1:11:45] god
[1:11:45] to give you the kingdom when it pleased
[1:11:48] god to give
[1:11:48] nebuchadnezzar the kingdom he gave it to
[1:11:50] him and then he took it from him when he
[1:11:52] plead when it please god to give cyrus
[1:11:53] the kingdom he'd give it to him he took
[1:11:55] it from him he pleased god to set up one
[1:11:57] kingdom or another
[1:11:58] one political system or another but now
[1:12:00] he said fear not little flock
[1:12:01] because it pleases him to give you the
[1:12:03] kingdom
[1:12:06] he won't take it away from you but
[1:12:09] you'll be there with him aren't you glad
