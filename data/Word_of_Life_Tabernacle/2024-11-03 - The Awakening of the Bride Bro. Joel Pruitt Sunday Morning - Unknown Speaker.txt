will be speaking for us and I know we're looking forward to everybody's welcome and encouraged to attend uh it be Friday the 22 uh but we really want to focus on the youth in that service so if you can come or if you have kids or grandkids just bring them on and I believe we're going to have a good time in the Lord don't you but if you have your Bibles this morning if you would turn to Psalms 85 and verse 4 Psalms 85 and 4 if you have it say amen amen turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever wil thou draw out thine anger to all generations wil thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation I will hear what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly and let's read one more place in Malachi 4 very familiar Malachi 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name how many we got here this morning that fear his name but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of host remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and you may be seated may the Lord At His blessings to the word this morning just for a background here this morning I just wanted to lay this quote in here and it says brother brandom says it like this High breeding first started in Eden started in Genesis it's the beginning we know that's a seed chapter can you say amen and he said that's where it ends up over here in Revelation at the second coming of Christ now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival aren't you thankful for that each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word then they hre it and instead of taking on they go somewhere else and that's in spoken word as the Original Seed 1962 if you go to Genesis CH 2 and: 15 just for the background this morning I'll try not to read too much and bore you Genesis 2:15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die now God didn't just uh God didn't say you can't do nothing he he gave him a whole entire Garden there's just one word that you can't go against there's just one thing that you can't do so you could have every fruit you could have every herb you could eat everything you wanted and there would be no death there would be a a continuous Revival if we could say it that way there would never be an end to this Perfection that was in Eden brother Bill and so we just but but but they just had to disobey the word of God they had to denominate if I could use the word there they had to do something outside of the word and and we know that that wasn't maybe in their hearts to do it but there was Satan and he's the he's the one that's always there trying to tell us tell us you know we need to do this we need to do that and listen if we ever recognize who he is and if we recognize his tricks then we can stop a whole lot of that nonsense that goes on in our lives can you say Amen but every fruit every tree you could have except for one every word you can believe it every promise is yours but you can't do this one thing and that's the one thing that caused death to the entire human race can you say man and he said so and so I was I was thinking there actually when I was reading that and I thought well that's where that was a Revival right there and that was the cycle of Revival that was Revival it all started it was Perfection and then there was death that followed it and brother brandom actually says that happened in every Revival but aren't you glad that this last Revival will not have that problem uh this will never denominate brother the bill we can just we can we can just feed on this word and we will never denominate and we will never die can you say Amen so I want to go on here just a little bit I believe there's a group of people that'll break that uh recy that cycle of Revival and death and so brother brand says it like this revival is not bringing in new members but it's to revive what you have can you say amen and brother Brandon talks about Revival and this is not really where I'm going but just for a background where you'll see there's differences in Revival there's sometimes a Revival in you there's sometimes a Revival we would call a Revival meeting in a church where we'd get together and have a meeting that's not really Revival although it does sometimes feel like it because when you get the licks of fire together uh you'll see people that'll just maybe they don't go to church all the time but they'll show up for Rev Ral meetings or uh maybe they don't they don't shout in church but they will at a Revival meeting brother Bill and so maybe they don't amen very often and I wish you would this morning but maybe they'll do it more in a Revival meeting so what what happens there is is it's it's a thrill more than anything and it's actually an emotion that you feed off from the other people and that's okay emotion's good if your religion doesn't have emotion the prophet told us to bury it is that right so we don't want to we don't want to do away with the enthusiasm brother brandham actually makes a statement we must never lose our enthusiasm and I would say this morning let us never let the message of the hour become common to us let us never let going to church become common to us let us never lose our enthusiasm but that's not the Revival that we are participating in in the end time the end time bride Revival is a word Revival it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll have the gifts every service it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll have an emotional time every service but what you will have is the word being preached every service because that is the focus in the bride's revival can you can you say Amen all these other things are good all the all the gifts are part of it the restoration was everything was restored everything was restored back in this age so I'm not discounting any of those things but we must have our eyes on the word because brother brandom said as that first Eve fell the second Eve would be the the the second bride to Adam the second bride to the second Adam would not fall Brother David why because she would receive the word in his fullness and she would not fall away from it aren't you glad about it this morning we will not fall away from the word that has been given to us so brother Ram talks about a Revival for our nation and he's pretty pretty Stern when he talks about that he says it ended in 1956 how many knows the quote there he says America has become condemned and what she did do according to the vision she elected the wrong person they might just do it again Brother David but but but according to the vision she elected the wrong person he said I don't know how long it'll ever take it to run out but it will someday he said that's thus sayith the Lord he said it will he said she's on her downward move right now she'll never come back again so America's America's Revival is is not here it's not present it can't happen again she turned down God as a nation for the last time and so now God has turned her back his back on her and he will speak to individuals that are still longing for Revival or he will speak to individuals that still want the word for the day but God will no longer deal with the nation of of USA as he once did he's actually now dealing with he's went back to the Jews as we know we know these things and I don't want to have time to go going into all of it because we will take an extra hour doing that all right Everybody's scared now I'm telling you you don't have to be scared when it's 12:00 I'm going to quit and then then brother Stuart can preach you happy tonight it's going to be good so all right well he said now that's thus sayith the Lord she's been gone since 1956 when she condemned and turned away God from the great Revival hours now he said and brother sister that's why you hear me cutting as hard as I can the American Revival is over it ended about 4 years ago so it's over and there's no more Revival in America we're only gleaning in the fields that's already been reaped and burned over you pick up a stock once in a while but very few can you say Amen some of you Old-Timers probably remember the time when there was revivals everywhere and maybe there was tents set up in fields and and there was just it was just a different time it was a different uh different age it is the same age but the beginning of the age before before started to run out and so you would see an enthusiasm among the people are you all still with me so far and so we're just dealing with just different stages of Revival here and we'll get past this and and I'm not preaching part two of last week's sermon I promise although it was good now that's what the reason today brother B talks about he goes on he said the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't he said oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere the bride now I want to lay this in here and I'll I'll show you where brother brandom actually later uh we'll actually take this up again and and and and he'll show you where the Revival is on but in the third seal 1963 he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see and we're looking for it now this is 1963 that's important to remember but he said it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again can you say Amen and now this messenger of Malachi 4 just goes a little bit further here he said in Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so let me just say that one more time he said he said he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so when brother brandham says that there has been no Revival yet for the bride but it will happen he said it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again we can find out in in the church age book he said now he said he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals brother brandom is preaching the Seven Seals telling you the Revival hasn't happened yet but he may not have realized it then but the Revival was taking place right then it was the bride's Revival being revealed in in the seven Thunders which were in the seven the in the Seven Seals so I just want you to know this morning that when there's people that tell you there's no Revival anywhere I say I am the bride's Revival when somebody tells you it's time that we can just sit down and shut our churches down and I just go ahead and tell them right now I am participating in the bride's Revival I'm not looking for a man to come back and open the seven Thunders the Thunders were revealed and those Seven Seals and I'm here to participate in that Revival but is a word revival can you say Amen so I'm not looking for something else to come and reveal more Mysteries the Mysteries have been opened the Mysteries have been revealed Malachi 4 has come to turn our hearts back and and we see all the restoration that has happened I am not here to to to just go back to another age or go back to Pentecost well can you say Amen because that's what every other Church did and they failed to live in the word of the hour because they would go backwards that's right well can you say Amen but what we have today is the true fullness and the revealing of the word of God and all we have to do is just accept it and believe it and I believe the real bride will she will not go back can you say Amen she will not go back to 1906 Pentecost and I I listen I believe in the gifts and I'm not here to preach against those things I believe every one of those things are still in order and still in action today but we're not focused on those things no more because the Pentecostal group he she would see those signs and she would see those remember the first poem they all loved brother Brandon when he was out there Discerning the heart hearts of the people and and he would just preach a A good sermon but when he started to turn and his ministry would change towards the word then the people would start to fall away why because they were not in the bride's Revival but they were a part of the Pentecostal Revival of 1906 now I don't say they're bad people I don't say that those people didn't make it but they were in another age but we are called out of leoda into a bride age to where we can understand the message of the hour and we can believe the message of the hour and we are we are here to say that nothing can separate me from the message that has been preached nothing is going to cause me to go over there and take a bite off of that denominational tree nothing is going to go over here and cause me to fall away like so many others have fallen away why because I am the bride's Revival today you are the bride's Revival it's not coming it's here can you say Amen brother brandom says it like this in recognizing your day in his message 1964 he said everywhere now there's no Revival everybody is complaining ministers crying and he was talking about the herald of his coming he said one of the he's one of the finest papers on the field he said but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pre fast pre sound a trumpet how many reads it he said you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all it's all you he fast pray he said we're going to have a great out great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray we're not too late yet and what do they do they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride in the seven Thunders there was an Awakening of the bride and oh come on somebody I I when I was reading this I just got excited because some people will take that quote over there in the in the third seal Brother David well we got to raise up somebody that can come and reveal the seven Thunders to us no just go ahead and read a little farther and you'll find out the prophet said they were already revealed we are in the time of Revival now we are in the time well nobody ought to Rejoice over it because we are participants in the bride's Revival this is the final Revival there's not going to be another Pentecostal Revival or another Baptist Revival but we are in the bride's Revival today can you say amen and in this revival I would say all things are possible can you say Amen in this revival everything has been restored everything that the Palmer worm and the canker worm and the caterpillar had eaten everything that the worms had eaten off of the tree that everything is restored back now but remember the main thing was Revelations 10 it was the opening of the word can you say Amen everything else has its place everything is important it's important I believe if you take out one thing that puts you right back there just like the first Eve but if you'll just recognize your day and its message then you'll recognize the Awakening of the Bride Can you say amen he said they have not recognized The Awakening Now The Awakening of the Bride the reev the bride's Revival happens when the true church the bride begins to line up with the word can you say Amen so she is not looking for another word for the pill she's not looking for another Prophet but she lines up with the word that's already been revealed can you say Amen now when Wesley's Revival came there was Wesleyan brother Bram talks about Wesleyan would speak for John Wesley because they raised up and they were the voice for the age can you say amen and so they were the voice of that age and so and and so the Wesleyan they they were they listen there was there was going to be a bride in that age there were they would they would stay with the True Light the true word that was open to them in their day but remember it was just a portion just an allotment Luther was the same way that just shall live by faith and and and remember they were not wrong in what they were doing the full light had not come yet because Revelations 10:7 and the messenger of Malachi 4 had not come yet but there was a truth to that and they would go ahead and but the problem is Brother Bill they would actually denominate around that truth it was a good truth it's a and it's Bible teaching but they would denominate there and they would completely say that what Wesley had was wrong the sanctification message is wrong but Wesley would come into more light and that would leave the lutherans in a day where they would end up dying in the age that they were in a true Revival but he would die can you say amen and so when Wesley comes along in a true Revival well can you say Amen are you still with me it's a true Revival I'm not we're not discounting another age we're not discounting these men and and what they did they were Messengers to the age but remember that age was not the fullness of the word it had not come yet and so Wesley would have a Revival a great Revival outpouring of the spirit and they would call him the shout Methodist at one point and and I remember some of the old-timers when I was a kid because we were raised around the Wesley and Methodist people and I will say this there were some prayer warriors there were some good Christians there and you couldn't you could your life couldn't match up with any of them they were just I mean they were just straight as an arrow there they were just great people but what happened was they would say oh if you spoke in tongues you were of the devil so what they would do they would they would say well sanctification is all we need we don't need the tongue talkers we oh they'd shout they'd scream they'd run the aisles but they didn't want that tongue talking Pentecostal Bunch well here comes the tongue talking Pentecostal Bunch with a little more light for their day but what do they do they do the same thing the lutherans did the same thing the weslan did and they say if you got the tongues then you got the Holy Ghost this is the evidence no what they did they failed to go on into the light for the age that they were in brother the bill and so what we have to do is quit looking back and saying well this is what we need to do and this is what need to denominate on or we don't have enough gifts in the church so we need to start focusing on the gifts again I say focus on the word and the gifts will happen in order if they're there in the church I believe in the gifts I believe in these things and I know sometimes when you say the word the word they say well your word only and you don't believe in shouting I tell you what I wish we had some runners in the church I wish we had some shouters in the church and maybe if the word is preached hard enough and long enough long enough maybe somebody will get up and run whether it's running out the back door or to the front but but what we're going to do is we're just got to preach the word Brother David and let the seed fall on fertile ground and it will raise up members of this body of Christ on the earth now the bride will be the same way except it's the final Revival and there is no end to it the bride will have the fullness of the light they will they will not do away with what Luther had they will not do away with what Wesley had they will not do away with what Pentecost had but they will walk in the fullness of the light can you say amen and we will not denominate the cycle of r rival and death has ceased can you say Amen now you may get into a church Revival or a church meeting Revival or even a personal Revival and you'll be on a mountain toop one day and in the valley the next have you ever been there I've been in meetings before where I felt so good I thought no devil could ever come against me and Monday morning come around next thing you know I thought well I don't even know if I can make it to Tuesday but what happens is is you've got to participate in the Revival of the age and don't look at the emotion of it well can you say Amen I I believe in Emotion I I hope I've said that enough times this morning that you know I believe in Emotion but I I but but that's not what we focus on because you can feel good and not have the real thing you can look good and not have the real thing what can you sayen you you can have all you can have all the you can have evidences in your life but if you've never met God face to face then you may not have anything on the inside I've I've seen people that dress good and and and and I grew up around a whole a church there where my dad pastored and and the women were you know he was strict you know and they had to dress a certain way and certain length sleeves and and all these things and well listen they they looked Holiness on the outside people would say well your your church looks good but it was just rules it was regulations on the inside when he died they all just went back out in the world so I'll just say it like this if you've got something on the inside it's staying power and it will not cease in this day it will not fall away to Le of sin it will not fall away to the things of the world but it will hold on to the word in this hour can you say Amen good to see the Jones family here this morning God bless you yet and so brother bandam says here he says nevertheless I have someone against he's quoting Revelations 2:4 he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone talking about the Ephesian church he said this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message and then is to all the generation in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel he said we reive Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next are you still with me in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of the original flame now we've seen that happen in families because what happens is there'll be somebody that comes to the message uh uh you know and and they'll really take hold of the word and then maybe their kids follow it and maybe they get into it a little bit and then maybe the third generation well we go to church and then maybe the fourth generation we don't have to go to church we're we're going to go in on Mom Dad and Grandpa's confession well what happens is that's that's a that's a cycle of death that is coming on can you say Amen so yes there was a Revival that started that family in the church but there was a there was a cycle of death that would end that family coming to the church eventually can you say amen and so we don't want to see that in our lives we don't want to see that cycle we've got to break that cycle can you say Amen we need to break the family curse in this day we need to break the time listen church we I I just wish I could preach to you here for a minute sometimes I think we get so we get so uh uh thinking so good about ourselves that well I you know I'm so sealed I'm so good well what about our family sometimes we need to put our Focus over on the family and say you know what I can't lose a one of them we need to put the the prayer altars back in the home again and God help me to have prayer back in the home again and maybe maybe we need to put the Bible back on the table again and maybe the TV should be shut off a little bit I tell you I think sometimes we just need to realize that participating in this bride's Revival is more than saying I'm a message believer it's more than saying well I I'm I'm just a good Christian listen that's not good enough to get you in a Rapture but this second Eve will not fall to the cuttingly devices of the world but she will look to Calvary and say that's all I want I don't want what this world's got to offer can you say Amen brother brandom said the Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be there may be no vestage whatsoever of the original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren can you say Amen your children are going to make it because you believe they're going to make it but you remember they still have to have an experience you believe that they're going to have an experience you don't believe that they're just going to make it no matter what condition they're in but you believe that somehow someway there will be a way back before they take their final breath can you say amen and he said then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren that is what starts the Revival and that is what starts the the cycle of death he said then it is simply the manifestation he said salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with the truly Born Again Believers and and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and they're now bapti Methodist and Etc he said that is exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man so I believe there are Christians in the denominations today but not everybody that says they're a Baptist is a Christian not everybody that says they're Methodist is Christian not everybody that says their Assembly of God is a Christian and not everybody that says their message is bride well can you say Amen I'm not counting anybody out I'm not putting anybody out but you got to check up yourselves sometimes and say what what's really in my heart and am I like that first Eve am I going over here am I flirting with the world over here and am I just saying well one word I won't surely die but what you're really going to do if you are that second Eve and I believe you are this morning can you say amen I believe you all are this morning I believe you are a part of the Bride of this last day I believe you are are a part of this end time Revival so if you are you are not looking for something else you're not looking for another denomination you're not looking for something to to to blend in with the World by but what you're looking at is saying Lord I'm looking to your word and that is my absolute can you say Amen so we're not looking at anything else we're looking at the word of God can you say Amen we have the Revelation and it has been open to us the opening of the book is here it's not a closed book now remember all these other ages had they had the opening of the word they could have maybe seen what we see today but it wasn't time yet there had to come a time where there was a certain man and and God had God knew before the foundation of the world exactly when he would come and he would be able to yield himself to the ministry of God so much that he would not make it about himself and point people to himself but he's pointing you back to the word at the beginning he's pointing you back to a Vindication he's not pointing you to brother William brandham but he's pointing you to Christ himself which is the word can you say amen I believe what a prophet said but you know why I believe this Prophet because he never one time said listen to me follow me he said no you follow me as I follow Christ you stay with the word you stay well come on somebody you believe what the Bible says you believe what's on them tapes when when he said thus sayth the Lord I say yes sir because it never failed one time it wasn't brother brandham speaking that was God speaking through a man can you say Amen so brother B goes on down he said it isn't in the word you start out with truly born- again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians they're methodists and Etc and he goes on down to say this and he says I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute he said th these folks are all coming together now by the will of man he said but I don't say they're not right with God not for a minute I do I say that but the original fire has died down there is no more Revival in denominational churches you sayen right you say well how can you say that have you been to one well I've been to a few especially growing up but I will say it like this there's a lot of emotion and many of them there's a lot of programs and a lot of them but there is no word being preached how can you say Amen they might get up there and say for God so loved the world I could say Amen to that if a Catholic priest told me that God loved me I'd say Amen to that I I can amen the word no matter who it comes from but I would like to say this that that is not what I'm looking for what I'm looking for is more than just Jesus Loves Me sermons I'm looking for a word that'll change my heart back just like it was in the beginning and I believe we have that word today can you say amen and brother Brandon would say it like this he said they are not the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal he said that is what's happening back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment of God to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them and they and they began to be careful about what the world thought of them well can you say Amen they they didn't think well godes does this please God well does this please my friend at school or does this please the world because if I can just look a little more like the world I don't have to suffer persecution but brothers and sisters I say get as far away from the world that you as you can get if the world's doing it do something else if the world's out here cutting their hair and wearing pants and and putting on makeup and well come on somebody I I think we need to run as far away from that Spirit as we can run I say we need to quit doing the things that the world's doing and come back to the in line with the word of God can you say Amen we've got young people and I'd say for the sake of the children let's line up with the word today and keep the Revival fires hot in our homes keep the Revival fires hot in our churches let the word have the preeminence and where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty for souls to be saved there is liberty for young people to come back to God there is Liberty I tell you there's old people that need to come back to God there's liberty where the spirit of the Lord is can you say Amen right brother said just like Israel what they did they demanded a king to be like the other nations they wanted to be like somebody else can you say Amen but what they in the world what the world thought of the second generation coming on was just like that but what they do they rejected God but what do they but they did it anyway and that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing things you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things that they wouldn't do initially so when you first get on fire for God and you hear that red hot sermon that makes you run to the Altar and you hear that red hot sermon that makes you just really fall in love with God again and You Weep and you cry and you go home and you kick all the nasty stuff out of your house and you make things right with God and then if you let that Revival Fire Die Brother David then you'll know six months for a year down the road a few of those things can come back in the house or you can start missing a few Services again or you well come on somebody what happens is you let the Revival fire die but I say keep the Revival fire burning don't let the devil blow it out keep it it on your hearts and keep it in your homes don't let the Revival fires die because we do need a personal Revival we do need a refilling of the Holy Ghost we don't do away with those things just because we're in the bride's Revival because if you're in this bride's Revival you long to have more of God if you're in this bride's Revival then you can't hardly help but get to church well come on somebody if the love of God is in your heart so I'm not going there this morning this ain't that go to church sermon I promise you that but what I would like to say this morning if God is in your heart the Revival fire fires will be in your heart if the love of God is there then there's nothing that can stop you from praising God if the Revival fires are there then there's nothing that can separate you from the love of God why because it's not something on the flesh but it's something on the inside it's something that'll make you love somebody it's something that'll make you treat people right brother Bill it's a it's something that'll make you put your arms around a center and say I know I I know God loves you and I know a word that'll bring you back but you've got to participate in the word for your day and that'll bring Revival instead of trying to get the Revival to bring the word let the word bring revival can you say Amen well that was too much word this morning well I'll just tell you right now if the word was preached Revival's there can you say Amen maybe you didn't feel it that morning but I believe it's coming because God will inhabit the Praises of his people and if you'll praise God and the word is being preached you're in a good atmosphere for Success you're in a good atmosphere to be changed you're in a good atmosphere to let the world fall off of you can you say amen he said now when it thinks more of the conforming of the world he said now they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get LAX that is what the Ephesus is means relaxed and drifting that cycle of Revival and death has never failed and all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians and went to church prayed all night took to the street corners and weren't ashamed of well I'd say we need to get back to some of those days every once in a while and he said they took the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit can you say Amen they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long time until they begin to get enough money to build fine new churches and they put in a choir instead of singing unto God well there ain't no choirs there amen he said they put in a choir instead of singing instead of singing themselves to God and so he said and what they did he said they he he said and and they put on gowns on the choir and they organized a movement and ran it by man and they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read can you say amen and they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone that's right well I think it's a bad day when the house of God has no cries of joy in it I think it's a bad time when we when we forget to worship God when we come to meet him I think it's a bad time if we don't entertain him while we're here well can you say man this is not just a place to come and sit it's not a place to come and just receive but let's participate in it let's participate in the bride's Revival that means if you need to come and Shout go ahead and shout if you need to come and let loose a little bit and just worship God in the house of God I say let loose and worship God in the house of God because we are participants amen we're not just here as Spectators Brother David but we are here as participants in this revival can you say Amen sir all right he said he said and they put their choir and go on now I got to get off that choir thing he said the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that's left what can you say Amen church I don't ever want to come to church and feel like all we've got is just another church I don't ever want to come to church and feel like all we've got is just another Wednesday night or just another Sunday morning or just another Sunday afternoon God help me if I ever get that complacent I want to believe that this is a time when I can actually meet God can you amen when I can actually let the Revival fire start again in my life when I can actually get in the presence enough to where the sins that have tried to bes set me throughout the week they can fall away Brother David I need the renewing and the refreshing in the house of God I'm not satisfied with yesterday's Revival I'm not satisfied with yesterday's meeting you young people don't be satisfied with yesterday's youth meeting but remember the next one needs to be the best one because you need to participate in it and say this revival is for me this meting is for me this word is for me can you say Amen sorry to yell at you but I'm enthused about what I got this morning I believe that God is absolutely wanting to do something for this church right here this morning but you've got to want it you've got to want what God's got for you you've got to want the Revival you can't say well I'm satisfied with what I got it's good to be satisfied with Jesus but I want to tell you this you need more of what you got yeah you don't need more cars you don't need more houses you don't need more money you need more of God God in your life can you say Amen you can have all this world and I tell you it's good to have it but you can have everything you want but let me just go ahead and tell you something all that ain't going to buy your way to heaven all that's not going to get you there if you're out of this revival you ain't making it because remember every other Revival every other eve they would fall and they would die it was recycle it was a cycle not recycle it was a cycle of Revival and death but what would happen at the end of all of this there will be a bride still on the Earth I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit but there'll be a bride still on the earth and she is not going to taste death can you say Amen she will not taste death there's going to be somebody that the Revival will start in and she cannot die can you say amen and I would say that even if you go by way of the Grave you can't die if you're in this bride's Revival because the dead in Christ shall rise first can you say Amen you well come on somebody that ought to make somebody happy you say well what about all these people that are dying well if they're in Christ they can't die well can you say Amen brother says it like this when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride oh I believe we've had the message can you say amen and I'm glad to be caught by the message Brother David I'm glad that the message caught I didn't go looking for the message but the message found me you say well wouldn't you raise in the message home I'll tell you what I ran just as hard as I could from the message but the but the but it wouldn't let me go I I tried to go out I tried to leave I I you I tried to do those things I tried to go UPC I tried I thought maybe they're right maybe no no when I come to find out this message was right the whole time but the devil was trying to get me away the devil was trying to say why don't you go over here with this move what about this move what about this group no no I'm not looking for a group I found the word can you say Amen not looking for nothing else I'm not looking for some group first time I was ever in a UPC Church they got up and talked about the evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues I had heard too much word to buy that there was something on the inside I thought I can't go that way because that's not even scriptural that's not even scriptural see the seed was there even when I didn't want it to be there the word was planted before I even had well come on somebody God will not leave you to just rot in this evil age but if the seed is there the word will find you can you say Amen well are y'all okay so far I know this is scattered and that's kind of what I do I guess but there's some good quotes in here if you don't get nothing else here's some of them brother Rand says it like this he said the message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect man can you say Amen how many we got in here that's elected this morning well you might as well say Amen because you are or you wouldn't be here just believe like that there's no reason to doubt it just believe like it God put me here for a reason I am the elected of God I'm not looking at my mistakes I'm not looking at my past I'm not looking at my family history Brother David I know I say that a lot because I have to my great grandpa had to leave Missouri because of our family history and I'm going to tell you right now I don't want to go back there and say well that murdering man I don't want to go back there no no I want to say right now well come on somebody I can't look to that I can't hold on to him for salvation my grandpa was a good Church of God Holiness man but I can't hold on to that for salvation I I can't hold on to what my daddy had for salvation because he didn't understand the word like I said even himself but I'll say this when the word found me I couldn't walk away no more when the word found me I could participate in the bride's Revival oh there's many isms in the message there's there's a thunder this and I was scared to death sometimes I thought well can I get up here and say that the Thunders was in this absolutely brother brandham said it I can say it I don't have to say well maybe the maybe the Revival hasn't started no no I remember those days of wondering which quotes can I believe well I learned I could just believe it all Brother David I can believe everything a prophet said I can say what a prophet said on those tapes I can't believe it because there's something on the inside that won't let me go can you say Amen brother said what we have now he said the world Satan and the deceiver who deceived the first bride so uh to sinning against God by misbelieving his word and now today as we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel going further and further away from the word in some social gospel we find that the women of the world on the streets members of such is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere oh come on somebody you see you ever see a modern you ever see see a modern a modern Church woman they say well I'm I'm modest and they've got their blue jeans on and so tight that if they bend over they'll bust them out and they they got a neckline so low that they leave I tell you what I I think we need to be thankful for The Godly women we have in this message I think well I'm glad I'm glad for them I tell you what the wor the worst of us is better than what they got out there I I I know sometimes we want to there maybe there's things we need to work on but I'm just going to say it right now there there may be some things we need to work on but we're better than what they've got going on I'm not saying we're better than they are as people because we're all Sinners saved by grace but do you realize what God has done for us in this day you don't dress good because you're scared to go to hell you dress good because something on the inside is revealing itself oh come on somebody this is a revealing of the Bride in this age there is a revealing of the word in this age it's a time for the bride to go ahead and put on the garments well can you say Amen it's time for the bride to realize who she is she is not somebody that's going to fall she is not a bride of yesterday but she is the bride the final voice to the final age the final Bride on the earth she's going to go in a Rapture she even listen church I told you a while ago we don't have to worry about death you say well what if you would drop dead tomorrow if I drop dead tomorrow I'll see you in a Rapture brother Bill I don't care which way we go whichever way we go we are going to come up with that generation we're going to come up with that bride generation the final bride why because the voice of the Resurrection is already in you to speak and call things as though they're not as though they are I say we need to just participate in it in the bride's Revival I say The Awakening is here the bride look listen I believe the bride is awake now he said those other groups failed to see The Awakening of the Bride why because it wasn't a show well can you say man this third poll was of no show it wasn't something where there was big campaigns anymore there was no more brother Brandon going out and putting his hand on people and the and the things on his hands no let me get to my point here this morning there was a third pull that came and the third pole was catching the the big fish it wasn't catching a denominational chicken it wasn't catching somebody out of this group or that group but it was catching the elect for the hour that they could come and see the message revealed in their day can you say amen I think we need to just go ahead and take the gloves off sometimes and just go ahead and say it like it is we don't have to worry about what our children are going to do because we believe that God has ordained us and our households to take the land in this day and I believe that we are in the land of promise that is the message of the hour can you say Amen I'm not well I know some of y'all say why do you preach the message I'm gonna tell you why I preach the message because according to the Bible this was what was to take place just before the burning right do you remember what we read there at the beginning there's going to be all there's going to be there won't be root nor Branch there'll be it'll be burned as an oven there'll be nothing left it'll be stubble it'll be nothing left but there is a people who will grow up as calves in the stall well can you say Amen why because they've been feasting on man from above you remember the story about the Cavs brother Bram talks about he said there was two barns there was a farmer on one side of the road and a farmer on the other and they had the two calvs and you had one that they had that that little calf that was just run down and starved to death and then there was that other calf that had been fed the alphalpha and the good things of God and it come out of the barn and he said it was fat and happy and he come out there and he said it was dancing and clicking its heels to well come on somebody we can have we can have church this morning it's okay with me so what he said that calf come out of there that calf had been eating good well can you say amen I think somebody here has been eating good this morning I'm not talking about physically although y'all are about to want me to quit so you can do that but let me go ahead and just say it like this if you've been eating on the things of God if you've been eating the open book well can you say Amen if you're eating the open book then I believe the open book will come back out of your mouth and you will speak as the Oracles of God you have a voice why because it's not a closed book anymore you can't speak as a denomination you can't speak as someone from the past but you are speaking speaking as the present tense body of Christ on the Earth today God is speaking through you God has raised up a body that could be his voice today can you say amen God has raised up you for such a time as this God has brought you to this moment because he knew you could overcome as I said Wednesday night to him that overcometh will I grant to sit in in my Throne not on it but in my Throne you'll be in the same throne room you are with him can you sayen but it's to the Overcomers it's to the ones how many's going to make it here this morning how manyan he's going all the way then go ahead and say I raise up a standard today I'll be the standard of the message of the hour I'm not going to let somebody else try to be my standard I'm not going to let somebody else try to be the voice but I'm going to be the voice today I'm going to be the standard today what can you say amen God has called you for a time as this such a time as this right brother B says it like this he said they're going further and further away from the word in a social gospel they've lost all sense of common decency the people have see now this is not to you but I want you to know that by prophecy of what the world will do you can see where you are I'm not trying to tell you you're going this way you're not going down you're going up can you say amen amen I'm not I I believe brother brand said keep the promises over the people I believe we're going to do that I'm not here to preach Doom and Gloom to you because I believe everyone in here is going to make it well can you sayen I I don't believe that this is a Time to tell all of our people well you may not be bride you may No Nonsense you are you wouldn't be here I say we might as well just go ahead and say you are the elect of this generation you are the called out you are the bride you are the final voice you are Mrs Jesus Christ in this day he said but then watch out he said again the spiritual church now he said how that group of people's called out and the elected through every Revival in Martin Luther it happened the same way in the Reformation it happened the same thing in the time of John Wesley it happened the the same thing when Pentecostal first started they dropped them women right back in line with the word and then they drift away and he said there she goes right back over in the chaos but then the time that the people are ready to line up there is a message that comes forth and they line with it can you say Amen there is a message that has come forth can I I I wanted to say this one more time so maybe you'll catch it with the time that the people are ready to line up so when you're ready the message comes forth and you will line up with it well can you say amen I I don't believe we have to the message is right on time brother Danny you say well why didn't they have it earlier in the it was right on time because there had to be a people that was willing to participate in a word revival can you say Amen there had to be a people to realize that this world's going down but I'm ready to go up this world's going down but I will not die I shall be changed can you say amen I believe that with all my heart yes sir we don't have to worry about going down in this tribulation that's coming can you say Amen but he said then watch again he said the spiritual church and then every time that the message comes they line with it now brother BR goes on down here and he says now friends go back with me where is the first where did the first Revival come after the death the days when the grain of wheat had to fall in the ground the body of the Bride the body the bride of Christ he said Christ organized his no excuse me Christ didn't organize his bride he said is that right his church he never organized it he just sets Apostles and Prophets and so forth in the church to keep it clean can you say Amen well so that means if you get somebody that comes in here and just kind of preaches it straight we can't we might as well just say Amen to it I remember a preacher that used to say he used to say say Amen or oh me but say something and so brother brother BR would go on like this he said he said he just sets things uh to to keep it in or in in order excuse me can't talk this morning he said he said he said just set Apostles and so forth and they organized it made an organization is that right he said and it died everything that didn't agree with that church was put to death now we know if you ever read read the fox's book of Martyrs you know some of this about how if you didn't agree with them man you were you were out you were you weren't in the church aren't you glad we're not that way now well is anybody that way now if you don't agree with me or my church we're out of here if you don't agree with me I'll tell you what I'll I'll skip town you know whatever you'll come back when you realize you line up with the word right that's right he said when you hear the message you will line up to it so brother R said and it died everything that didn't agree with that church was put to death and it laid still for hundreds of years in the dirt but after a while up she come in Luther the first little sprigs of corn come up the second it buted out from there and they went on they had zwingle and so forth and other organizations and he said so forth and after a while he come uh Anglican along and what happened he said here come Wesley and there was a Revival in the tossel and that looks a little more like the wheat and then what happened to that it organized and dried up and died the life went right into a Shook and the Shu come forth almost perfectly like the wheat but finally its Folly was made manifest in the last eight or 10 years especially in the last in the last three years he says he says now what does it do pull away from the wheat now why hasn't there been an organization start up in these last 20 years of this great Revival it's anointed prophets anointed teachers and so forth but why ain't there there is nothing Beyond The Grain well can you say Amen there's nothing more to come there's no this can't die because there's not going to be another Revival start up can you say Amen this cannot die so he said there's nothing Beyond The Grain see it's back without an organization he said oh my a blind man can see that it cannot organize it's so firmly against it it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again and the son of man in the last days there will come false impersonations of it in the last days that'll almost deceive the elected if possible look at their organizational Shucks pulling away now he said it only let the wheat be known to the elected which part of it now I know it's a lot of reading but I'm getting somewhere and then I'll close I'm out out of time almost notice how beautiful this is I'll never get this finished today but we'll be okay he said the anointed he said notice the anointed prophets will be false there will there will be among it will be true anointed how how how you going to tell it by the word well can you say Amen how you going to know it if you got a prophet over here prophesying and a prophet over here prophesying brother if it doesn't line up with the word leave it alone I don't care how anointed they are I don't care how right they look if they're off the word leave it alone say well I I appreciate you for trying but I'm going to stay with the word of God well don't listen to that deceiver that's trying to tell you to go ahead and eat a little bit of this tree let's go back here and just do a little bit no stay like that first Eve stay true to what God has given you in this day you've got a whole garden full you've got herbs everywhere you've got meat in the storehouse you've got everything you have need of but what you've got to do is eat of the true word that has been given and not something that is to come or something that has been you'll get sick to your stomach but if you'll believe on God and His word for this day you will be an overcomer in this Pride's revival can you say Amen now I believe that the signs follow them that believe can you say amen I I just don't believe that we follow the signs I believe that I believe that we follow that the word follows or the signs follow the word can you say amen I I I don't believe that that we should leave the word to follow a sign now if it's in the word then amen praise God for it but if it's outside the word I said leave it alone can you say Amen Mark 16:15 said go into all the world and preach the gospel Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe the Believers that's who the signs are following not somebody else but it's following you it's following the believer how many Believers are here this morning it's foll the signs are following you you're not following the signs can you say amen and these signs shall follow them they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I I know people say we don't need altar calls anymore I know people say we don't need prayer lines anymore I know some people say we don't need to lay hands on the sick anymore but I'd like to go ahead and just remind you that that is a commission to the Bride of Jesus Christ that is the commission to the people of this day if you have a need we lay hands on you and we believe that God is going to do what he promised in his word it's not an emotion it's not a workup well he didn't pray what I wanted him to pray but the Bible said he laid hands on him he may not even have to pray for you but if you'll just believe that the word is true you don't have to worry about what the man said when he was praying did he lay hands on you did the Bible say for him to do it then believe that the word still works in this revival can you say Amen sir he said they shall take up serpents drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them that don't mean you go pick up serpents and become a snake handling church Hallelujah we tried to go to one once when I was a kid we went there and they were closed is that yeah Sneedville Tennessee yeah we went there we were trying to go to this snake handling church because we want to try something new you know what I mean we want to try something different I guarantee it would have been be like Wendy Bagwell where's the back door there ain't one I'll make one but we'll but sorry but we didn't make it in because somebody was sick and couldn't be a church that night thank the Lord probably got snake bit you know and so we didn't get to go in and experience them taking the word and doing their thing with it but we don't have to tempt God in that way can you say Amen we don't go out here and look for trouble just to see we don't go out here and and and drink something bad for our bodies make ourselves sick and then say well now I I'm going to get healed because I I need a miracle in my life well that's that's pretty stupid sorry unfiltered this morning I apologize left over from last week now the signs follow them that believe we don't follow the signs is that okay is that okay I believe in the signs remember the word never said there would be no signs the word never said that we would we would we would not lay hands on the sick and I my brother said this before and I'll just go ahead and repeat it he said if brother Brandon was here and he had a prayer line we'd all be participating in it but if he but he's not here so we want to fight about it and say well we don't need prayer lines anymore I say that everything that God gave the church let's go ahead and and participate in it he come with a church order to set things in order but that didn't put things out of the church was to set things order in the church can you say Amen see he wasn't he was a word Prophet brother Bill so he couldn't take parts of the word and do away with it we had to keep the word but he just put it in order so so what it is you'll find that he was just like Paul in that regard he saw things were getting a little out of order and he needed to come back and set it in order in the church he was not unscriptural in any way and listen we don't follow brother Brandon because of the man he was I I believe he was a great man he didn't smoke or drink and and all these things he's a great man we don't follow the man we follow the message that he he sent he said don't don't look for me don't look to me look at the message it's it's God it's Christ it's it's Christ all the time he said it's not me it's not William Brandon that's doing these things but he said it's the one that's not standing 10 feet from me or what however far it was it's the one standing there with me he's the one doing the work brother Bill that same God if it had been brother brandom we would have no hope this morning because he's dead and buried in a grave in Jeffersonville but because it was God in brother brandom that same God could come right here this morning and do the same thing that that Prophet [Music] did not looking for the gift to come again we already saw the gift and it was Vindicated and and a word follow of the gift can you say Amen we're not looking at the gift even now I believe oh I love listening to prayer line tapes and I love to hear what brother random said on it and I love to hear the discernment it's faith building I do love to hear it but that's not what's going to get me ready for the Rapture that was just to get my attention to what the word would say that's just to get my attention to say come out I HT my people because if you can get somebody's attention they'll follow you for a little bit if you can get somebody's attention then maybe the word will have an effect on the people well are you hearing me this morning if you can get the people's attention that's all the first poll was to do but we see the third poll is the manifestation of the word in human lives today it is the opening of the word and the revealing of the word today well can you say Amen I've got five minutes left is that okay he said reminds me of a story there was a great Welsh Revival some great man here in the nation thought they would go over and see the Welsh Revival I hope this is okay I know I'm not a teacher I I'm not even much I'm not even a preacher but you'll get a good preacher tonight so just hang with me for five minutes and uh and if I save some some of my voice I'll pull on brother Stewart real hard tonight he said the great Welsh Revival was on and there was there was some great men here in the nation thought they would go over and see the Welsh Revival what would be taking place and as they went over to find out they see that what building it was H in when they got to Wales they went around and begin to ask about where the building was and they seen this happy little officer now I would like to underline happy because this was a person in revival can you say amen and he he was on the job so he may not have felt like he was in Revival he had to work that day but he's but he's happy can you say amen amen he's said well all right he said uh he said he said this happy little officer standing on the corner with his little Tommy hat on and was swinging his Club around and around like that these men walked up to him and said sir could you tell me what building the W Revival is held in he said yes sir I'm it I'm it I think that's what sometimes I wonder well can you tell me what church you belong to well I Church up here on the hill we don't even want to tell them what church we go to because we're scared to death of the mess that we're representing what can you say Amen but if you were Baptist you'd say well I go to the Baptist Church right y i when I ask people I work for where they go to church they always tell me but if I ask a message person they don't even want to tell me and I'm in the message well I go to brother so and so's Church well who is he well let me just go ahead and tell you something I'm not ashamed of the message of the hour I'm not ashamed of what I believe because it's the only reason I can stand here this morning listen you say well if you didn't have the message you wouldn't have nothing to preach you're exactly right I don't want to preach nothing but this message I don't want to preach what Dr Dobson said or somebody else I don't want to preach what even some other message preacher would say I want to say what the message of the hour says and then I'm under the authority to speak it and believe that the word will go to work and it will bring things to pass that need to come to pass in this church this morning if I come with my own opinion and try to tell you things listen God won't anoint that God won't back that up but what God will do is he'll say he'll say just preach the word brother said preach the word and the Bible says pre preach the word be instant in season and out of season and listen I I want to stay with what the word says because outside of the word brother Justin I have no reason to be standing in this Pulpit outside of the word I don't need to go to a church outside of the word there's nothing left for me but what I've got now is a hope because the word has come and it's manifesting itself in my life and it's manifesting itself in your life Amen brother the Jay it's manifesting itself through young men today it's manifesting itself through young preachers and if the Lord terries I hope that God raises up young men right out of this front row here to carry this gospel on to the coming of the Lord why because the message and the Revival will not die can you say Amen as long as this L as long as the Lord terries there's got to be somebody to preach this message and there will be because he brought the message in due season when you could accept it when there would be somebody to take it I'll tell you what it's like the old story they were putting them logs down in the river and he said I'm riding on it I tell you I'm riding on the message of the hour this morning morning I'm not here to just sit back and look at it I'm not here to sit back and say well that was good for brother brandham or that was good for for some somebody else or brother Perry or brother bcll or brother Donnie I don't listen it's good for me it's good for you this morning it's good for the bride why because we're riding on the message of the hour the Revival is on I believe that the bride is awakened now because those Thunders have been revealed the the Thunders and the re and the seals have been revealed and I believe that this is the hour we can participate in the bride's revival can you say Amen I'm almost done almost I just want to stop here with this and say the move is on for the bride now brother brandham says this in recognizing your day in this message 1964 he said some of you people that really believe this to be the truth how many's there how many's here this morning that really believes this message to be the truth not what I told you but what the message of the hour has said amen he said you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse that's a solemn thought it's a sober sobering statement he's making here but he goes on sir it's got to get worse and it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend can you say amen he said it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's the th sayith the Lord oh when a prophet speaks thus sayith the Lord why don't we just say what he said and believe it when a prophet said the move is on for the bride I say yes I'm going to participate in this bride's revival can you say amen I I believe the move is on for you Brother David I believe the move is on for you brother brother Mike I believe the move is on why because we are in the bride we don't look back to what has been but we're looking forward we're pressing towards the Mark we believe that all things are ready for the feast and we are participating in a Revival that is not going to leave us with our heads hung down but we're looking up because our Redemption draweth nigh can you say Amen brother Brandon says I like this musicians go ahead and come my time is up and I said I'd quit at 12:00 I'm 4 minutes late brother B says this that's thus sayith the Lord he said and and he goes on down actually earlier in the message he says this God created me a Revival how many's got that prayer this morning I wonder if we could stand together just in closing I want to say this and just listen closely if you can created in me Revival let me be the Revival how many can say Amen to that amen if any of this applies to you I want you to just put your hand up to him let each one of us be the revival can you sayen he said make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humble more kind more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press towards the mark of the High Calling well can somebody say praise the Lord let me press on this morning and keep on in this bride's Revival I'm riding on the message of the hour how about you I'm riding on it I believe this message is opening hearts and returning turning us back to the original faith I believe everything thing in this hour is turning us back to what we have need of if it's healing you need this morning it's all available in the bride's Revival if it's salvation you need this morning it's available in the brides Revival come on somebody if you have need of anything this morning you can have it in the bride's Revival how many's going to participate in it just say this revival is for me it's not just for the church it's not just during special meetings it's not just when there's a special preacher in town but the Revival is in me let me be the Revival with every head bowed every eye closed just want you to think about the things you've heard this morning I hope I hope there was something that helped you hope something was said that would help you this morning we know there National Revival is over but that doesn't cause any Gloom for the bride because we're not looking for a worldwide Revival we're looking for the Revival to be in me let the word that was opened by the opening of the word let the open book come in me and create the bride's word Revival Heavenly Father Lord you see every need in the building if there's a hand that would go up to you right now Lord if there's someone here that says I need a Revival in my heart I need the word to be made known in my life I want to participate in this end time Revival Lord God I pray that every person in this building today this morning would not look to things in the p past and think about their failures and their past mistakes but look to an elected seed that's got them in the house of God this morning and then would say I'm not what I used to be and maybe I'm not what I want to be but praise God I am the elect and I am writing on the message of the hour Lord if you could just talk to our hearts this morning reveal to us what you would have need of let us just grow in your word this
