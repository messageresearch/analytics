a privilege to be in the house of the lord thank you i know we've been dealing with this coronavirus thing again but i'm so thankful the lord has allowed us to continue having church and and no one in the church has it but it's in the area and so we're um we're thankful that god has helped us so far and will continue to help us acts chapter 2 and verse 14. i want to speak this morning on what is god doing today what is god doing today it's good to have all of you with us good to have my baby sister here this morning and my some of my family as well acts chapter 2 and verse 14 it says but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the lord shall be saved thank the lord for his word you may be seated this morning i spent this past thursday in mountain home with a friend who i hadn't seen in over a decade and i've been a little bit sad this week and kind of talking to him and catching up with him he may listen to this this morning i don't know but he is a couple years younger than me and we were buddies when i was a teenager and for several years and he's the most gifted musician i've ever been around very talented played the piano at my wedding and i helped officiate his been through a lot i took him out to eat and we caught up a little bit the other day and while i ran some errands from the for the church he he went with me and our conversation turned towards god and i knew that he hadn't been serving the lord for a while and we started talking about it and and he's done differently in his life then you know it seemed like you come to a certain spot and everybody grows up together and then you go your own way and and he looked at my life he said you know he said i know you've always wanted to serve people and you've always wanted to live for god he said i can see you've done that and i said i said you know what to my friend i said you know i've always wanted to be the same person no matter where i i was and and what i've done and i always wanted to have that same heart for god that i always did and we ran around together 20 years ago and he could see that was the same and i could see things in his life had changed and he had gotten to a point where now he what he does for a living is he plays in bars and clubs and trying to make it in the music industry and as we begin to talk he said you know he said based on what i've seen based on my experience with god or what i've seen god do he said i'd have to say i'm an atheist and it really made me think because he's not even sure that god exists and he told me as if it was an afterthought and it broke my heart because it was like an afterthought you know i'm i think i'm an atheist i'm not even sure that god still exists and you see if you if you can't see that god does anything then you if you can't see what he's doing then you don't know if he's real just saying what he did yesterday is not enough of a of a of an affirmation to your heart and your soul in your own life that he is real you have to be able to see what he is today and so forgive me for being personal there for a moment but it just really struck me i'm not even sure that god exists and and many people and i think all of us today would say we know god exists but at the same time it's important that we continue to see what he's doing because if we lose sight of what he's doing and who he is and and how he's working it's good to see you brother ronnie this morning as well but if we lose sight of that we become in some ways a de facto atheist and it's someone who who believes in god but you couldn't tell it by the way that they live right and you've known people like that they would never maybe come admit that like to you like my friend did but they would say i believe in god i believe god is real they may even say i believe the message but act as if the message never came right there by their life you you couldn't tell it by what they did and and so they would be a de facto atheist and in some ways that's worse because there's a deception in that when you don't know that you don't believe in god so and i'm not trying to say that to be harsh to you but to get to a point today we have to be able to see what god is doing today because if we if we can't see that we lose our understanding of our place and our position in christ and his work among us and we eventually begin to wonder does he even exist and so peter stood up on the day of pentecost and before god had been a something that happened to the israelites years before and they could tell you about the red sea they could tell you about everything that had happened but peter stood up on the day of pentecost he said this is what god is doing today what you see these these men and women that have come down out of an upper room speaking in in in tongues that they don't even know and the people hearing that was the miracle was in the hearing but the people hearing them speak in their own language he said this is that them staggering out like drunk men and all the things that happened that day he said this is that that was spoken of in the scripture he said here it is in the word and here it is in flesh right and so that's where we have to be here it is in the word here it is in flesh i have to be able to identify where i'm at i have to be able to identify what the word says about today in order to know that he's real you know people don't usually stay lukewarm forever eventually they lose their consciousness of god and and so for a while they'll say well i believe god but eventually you watch people that leave the message most of the time they end up atheists because once you've reasoned away the message you can also reason away the bible using the same methods and so they do that they end up atheists not even believing in god at all and so people lose their their consciousness of god and in romans chapter 1 paul talks about that in verse 20 he says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made he said you should be able to know just by nature itself that there is a god nature itself should teach you that that there is a god and i'm so grateful that god made these things that we know that he's real because we see it i told my friend the other day i don't have enough faith to not believe in god so paul indicts the gentile world who'd never heard the true gospel but he says just by the fact that they they should have known there was a god they should have known who he was because he said they're without excuse because the things that are made reveal him verse 21 because that when they knew god so they knew god at one time but they glorified him not as god and we could stop there and i could preach the rest of the service just on that because if you know god and you don't glorify him as god you eventually will deny that he is if you know the message and you won't do what the message says eventually you'll deny the message is real it's true and and so he said they knew god but then they they refused to glorify him as god in other words they they did not place him in his position where he should be of worship where he should be of glory where he should be on the throne room of their heart and because they did not put him in the place where he should be in their lives they eventually said he doesn't even exist or they changed him into something else that was less than god so he said they become vain they glorified him not as god neither were thankful just the fact that they were ungrateful for what he did well i pray that god would never let us become that way but that we would remain grateful lord i've been through a lot but i know that you've intervened in my life i know you've moved i know you've brought me to the place where i'm at today even after all these things have gone on but i know that you're real because i've seen you work in my life so he said they weren't thankful but become vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools so the more wise they become they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god and notice how it descends here first was the uncorruptable god they changed it into an image made like the corruptable man and to birds and the four-footed beasts and the creeping things they brought it all the way down from heavenly things until god could be no more than an ant or or a beast crawling across the ground a serpent wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own heart to dishonor their own bodies between themselves do you see how this happened it happened because of a loss of god consciousness because of a loss of understanding of what god is doing today that's how the world got where it's at right and so it says to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who was blessed forever so they knew god but denied his power paul puts it this way he said having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now we we want to know what god is doing today and god is doing something god is working in the earth today what is he doing today we have to know and we know that all the works of god are written in the word of god and they were revealed to us at the opening of the 7th field book of revelation 10 so we know we don't we're not looking at a partially revealed word but a but an open book and what a confidence that gives us today that we can we can say i can order my life according to the word i can i can have the holy spirit work in my life in such a way because because i know that the book is open and i don't have to have these questions anymore if there's a question i can find an answer to it because the book is open and so he he opened the seven seal book of revelations 10 which was opened by christ himself revealed to the prophet who the word comes to now is given to the bride to know right now brother brown says that he said being a believer in the scripture he said i think that there's no meeting complete without the reading of the word he said the word is god's foundation he said i believe all doctrines everything should come exactly from the word of god and i i recognize that one day and i use this a lot but brother brown said the reason that the beast come out of the bottomless pit in revelation was because there was no foundation to his doctrine because his doctrines were not biblical right so every bible doctrine has to be biblical right and so he says i believe that god can do things it's not written in the word because he's god but as long as i know that i'm just following what he said he would do then i know i'm right as long as he said he would do it amen i know i'm right when i'm preaching about the holy ghost i know i'm right when i preach about about the the prophet coming why because god interpreted his word i know i'm right when i preach about the things that that have happened in our hour and the things happening today because the word of god says so right and so now he said i believe he said he said then i know i'm right as long as he said he would do it now the bible tells us there would be a time of the end you'll find that in daniel 12 and 9 and i won't go back over all of this because we've been through it recently but daniel 12 9 says that these things would be sealed up to the time of the end and then in we find that two things were to happen the great falling away of sec of ii thessalonians 2 3 also a restoration prophet of malachi 4 5 and 6. so before that day comes there had to be a falling away we've seen that the church nominal falls into darkness and then there's a falling away even from the truth of the hour so we've seen that great falling away we've seen that church that that modern church go into utter darkness now if we if we you know if you just wonder what's got doing today and you begin to look and see what time is it where is the church at where is the world at brown said if you want to know how a church is doing look at the women and that's kind of an odd thing to say but he's typing it to a church look at the church look how they are look at the condition today of the church which is totally disassociated belief from practice they've completely removed it where it doesn't matter how you live anymore but they've gone into complete and utter darkness following a witch brother adam said down but it's during that same time that the bride is going up amen during that same time by the steward we have a promise that we can go up now so this has already taken place the prophets already came and did just like john when he come jesus said he's already come and they did to him what was written and he's already come and people have already accepted or rejected the message and and the world you know you can't say he wasn't a prophet today the world then said he was right the world of that day understood he was a prophet and they can't disprove that so they try to disprove what god is doing right now but look the falling away is is complete the prophet has come and gone now where are we now if you look at it scripturally it places us at the end just before and not just at the end but we can say the end of the end because the mystery's already been revealed and so now this we we find ourselves just before the the complete fulfillment of first corinthians 15 51 where he said behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed what a promise that is what a promise that is what a consolation we shall be changed and so brother branham talks about how that man can see what god is going to do because we know that that full fullness of that is in the future the change of the body we know that the prophet has come and gone in the past and yet his message is alive today the message that he brought which was a message from the throne of god the message is still alive but the prophet has come and gone so we know that we're living in that time and and we know that this is the time when and brother branham talks about this over and over he deals with how man is constantly praising god for what he has done and this is in the spirit of truth he said he's always saying what he will do and then at the same time ignoring what he's doing right and brother branham goes through this and gives us some examples and i'm going to read several places where he says this he said man will say oh god opened up the red sea yes glory to god that's right yes jesus is coming again hallelujah that's right but talk about him today he said oh that was for another day see always what he has done what he will do and ignore what he's doing and and in the sixth seal brother the rem says here we are these denominationals twisted up they take all the glory and power place it back with the apostles and the rest of it over in the millennium he said it's just like a man as i said before a man is always giving god praise for what he has done looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing right now that's exactly man it's still the same thing and if we continue to do that guess where you're putting yourself as a de facto atheist oh i believe in god but he doesn't do anything i believe in god but he doesn't know what i'm doing i believe in god but it just there's no movement there's nothing happening you know it's just we've seen it in the past we've seen it in the future but god is doing something today but i want to tell you right up front we're not looking for another prophet we're not looking for another denomination that's not what's promised in the word we're not looking for another time even a great worldwide revival we're not looking for that what are we what are we looking for we're looking for a rapture coming what's happening today something's happening god's moving he may be moving in a different way than we expected he may there may be things happening that's different than what we expected don't ever assume that god is not in control because you lost control we want to control the events of our lives and have everything set up the way we want and then things begin to spin out of our control but when it spins out of our control it's in his control and so brother branham says he's ignoring what he's doing he said that's exactly man always he said and he does the same thing today he always is that he said a man he said you've got to get out of that he said you've got to let the mind that was in christ be in you and then greater than solomon is here brother brown says listen to this remark listen to this remark man is constantly praising god for what he has done looking forward to what he uh what he will do and ignoring what he's doing he said that's the status of mankind he always did that and the same thing is tonight he says men look over and look back and see what god does and talk about a great god back yonder he says at pentecost and looking for a great day of millennium when he will come again and ignoring his very being he said in the presence of his people listen making ready for that millennium they ignore it it's just the nature of people to do that again in certain we would see jesus brother brown says it seems to be a spiritual condition of the church that they fail to see the hour that they're living they're looking for some sensation or something way off in the future man is forever doing that he always blesses god for what he has done looking forward for what he will do and ignoring what he's doing he said you failed to see the hour that we're living so what is he doing today what is happening according to the scripture what he's doing today and i'll bring you the scripture and the quotes on this but i want you to think with me think with me pinch yourself if you have to wake up a little bit and you're sitting at home the same because he is doing something today but what is he doing he's dressing the bride in the fullness of the word and he's bringing individuals to the same place of maturity that the word has already reached because the word doesn't have to mature anymore it's already come we've already been through all seven ages and that's why we don't have to go seeking another revelation or another thing coming because that's the word has come to maturity and we even saw it in an individual in our hour that god brought him to a place of maturity so that we could see an example of what god is doing i hope you're hearing me now we could see what god is doing and then he came and he left and then we said well where are we well we're coming to that same place of maturity right now we know and i didn't have time this morning maybe we'll get into it in the future but you could go and look at all the things brother branham said about the wheat and he said i hear the coming of the combine he said lay in the presence of the sun for the ripening and so that is the time or the hour that we live in is that it's this time if you look out at the country today i know brother bill this morning is they're working on harvesting their crops and i noticed the other day that the weatherman you know they've been calling wanting rain wanting rain wanting rain he said no he said don't look for rain no more we don't want no rain because the farmers are all harvesting and so they're they're saying we're hoping for no rain in the coming weeks why because they want to get the the crops out you don't want moisture in this hour you don't want greenness in this time are you with me now so god is dealing with us in a very mature way he's dealing with us in a very mature way i hope you're listening to me this morning he's allowing things maybe to happen and things to take place among us even this coronavirus everything happening he's dealing with us in a mature way in a way that maybe past ages and places maybe they couldn't have handled it but he's dealing with us in a very mature way because we've got to be ready amen so we've he wants us to reach that place of maturity so now we know that in this hour that the condition of the bride at the end time will be the opposite of that of the condition of those who have fallen away look they've committed adultery on christ but she is a true virgin bride washed for the bleeding word her sins so she never did it in the first place her old husband done away with everything it's done away with aren't you glad we serve a god like that so here she is a true virgin bride and but they have committed adultery on christ they go farther and farther into satan's eden we're going the other direction now and he foretold that in ephesians 5 25 this is what he's doing he said husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself i'm so glad he does that he might present it to himself oh that gives me hope because i don't have very many talents in the natural but he's going to present it to himself a glorious church not having spot he said a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy without blemish so he's saying that the bride is coming to her wedding which is a very important occasion and people don't just wear anything to a wedding people you know there are people who don't like to dress up really don't like to dress up and those people even those people will usually dress up for a wedding especially if you're the bride of the group most of the time not always i've seen some camouflage weddings and and some odd things but usually a man may only wear a tuxedo once in his life that'll be to his wedding a woman may only wear a long dress with a train once in her life what's it for for the wedding so paul says you're coming to this this one time event this place where you're going to be christ is going to present you to himself as a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle not having any blemish in the garments you've been washed with the washing of the water by the word so that there's oh my and brother madam puts it and you can go and listen to uh invisible union he talks about how the filth of these denominations has been washed away that's right that he might present it to himself a glorious church that should be holy without blemish now listen he will not fail amen he'll have his bride ready he will not fail in presenting to himself a glorious church if he had left it up to a man oh boy i hope you're listening to me this morning if he had left it up to a man he might have failed amen if you left it up to your pastor he might have failed if he left it up to another man he might have failed but he didn't leave it up to a man he said he might present it to himself so the word came down are you with me now the word came down the word came down and even showed himself manifested in a man and a prophet but he came down in our day the word came down the son of man came down on our day why because he had to get her ready himself can't leave that up to somebody else he did the laundry for the wedding hey man he did the laundry my wife wouldn't have wanted me to pick out her clothes for the wedding but jesus did the laundry washed the garments made them made them right and brought them up through justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost the restoration against all these things to come to this hour where he could dress his bride he will not fail and we know that because revelation 19 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready to her was granted i'm so glad the her was grounded he did the laundry and he brought it by he said here it is put it on but she still has to put it on but it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in the final inning clean and white for the final inning it's the righteousness of saints how many of you i've watched my daughters over the years and whenever there's something new in the closet they have to wear it right they have to wear it it can't just be put aside for future use they'll sneak in there they'll find it they'll wear it and if there's any princess costumes or anything that that's beautiful my daughters will wear it whether it fits or not especially my youngest you know she'll go find the prettiest thing and put it on just to wear it even if it's just just to try it on she wants to wear it oh my hair it's like the bride's sitting before the wedding and she's waiting and here here's the here's the wedding garment and and it's right there in the room and all you have is rags all you have is is dirty filthy rags he said why there it is is there no interest in putting it on is there no interest in picking it up and just letting it become a part of your life if not you just walk away from the wedding well it's not for me evidently not but there's something about the bride there's something about the bride it should be there and see i have to wear it i want to put it on i want to see what i look like in it and so paul tells us to put on as the elect of god all these these fruits of the spirit put on these things why because they're here for us today here we're in the room and they're here for us he said put it on that's what god is doing today what's he doing letting you put on your clothes and the truth is that we should have our clothes on because this is our knot of the marriage supper is in the future but not the wedding we'll read that in just a moment but most of you are familiar with that now he said she takes it exactly as it's offered now to he said the fine line is the righteousness of saints that's the manifestation of the word that proves what she is you know you may not know anything you may go to a wedding not not have ever seen the bride but you know who she is right because of what she wears and who she's close to you know who the bride is because of what she wears and who she's close to now she takes the pure word of god that came to her by the prophet of malachi 4 because that was what was his job brother said he had no certain mystery it was to tie up the loose sins so it become in its fullness in this hour so that he tied up all the loose sins that were left hanging from other ages all the things that we needed to know right and so he brings that message you realize that if he hasn't finished his message you can't get dressed yet you can't even be doing what god is doing today if he has not finished its message right because how could you be dressed how could you be married to him united with him and and him it not be complete you wouldn't wear something like that so thank you for for hanging with me this morning i i don't mean to but i'm taking this slowly for a reason now and so she takes it as it's offered like esther in the bible and dresses herself esther 2 and 13. let's look at that it says then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her look whatever she desired brother branham tells us by your desire you can tell what's on the throne room of your heart somebody has no desire to go to church in the house of god there's something wrong in the throne room somebody has no desire to fellowship with god's people there's something wrong why because that's how you can tell and so every maiden come to the king and whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women and to the king's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaskas the king's chamberlain i don't know how that's pronounced but most of us don't so which kept the concubine she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter when her turn amen what is this this is her turn that's a good way to understand the bride's bright age because it's not another age but it's her turn right and when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail's uncle mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what the hey guy the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed amen and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her now hey guy was a eunuch he had only the king's best interest at heart he wasn't in competition with the king very bad so he told her now this is what the king likes this is what he likes amen oh i think god has shown us in this hour what pleases the king amen and she had a right to wear whatever she wanted to she had a right to take in whatever she wanted to and their mother women did them other women come in with a trinitarian baptism they come in with a with a three gods they come in with a with a false uh revelation of the godhead they come in with false doctrines of all kinds they come in with man over man bishops they come in with that stuff but we can't come in with that stuff right they come in with extra biblical doctrines but she would only accept what he gave her so she was taken to the king amen when in the seventh year of his reign well if you can't see again it's just a type but you understand she was taken to the king in the seventh year of his reign now and the king it says love dexter above all the women and she obtained grace and favor oh i'm so glad was that song greatly blessed highly favored very bad i mean that's us why because we only wore we only put on what he gave us to put on amen hallelujah we didn't add anything to it we didn't take anything away from it and so the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of asking he meant her queen you see this is the time of the marriage you say what is god doing today he's uniting us with the word and proving his word brother branham talks about he said not no more as a church see no no more the bride is called and that's brother branham and he uses those terms interchangeably just as we do but and just as paul did but here he's making a difference because there is a nominal church and there is a bride not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church and here's he uses it interchangeably here but it's the true church to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call listen we'll come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together now he said the church again speaking of the true church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man so we had to see god real in our day and when we saw that it attracted our attention to the son of man right now watch he said not a clergyman he said do you see what i mean he said it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and we'll make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him that's one the bride he said and then she'll go home to the wedding supper he said she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage he said fill your flesh all the flesh of the mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper he said when the word here unites with the person and they too become one he said then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again amen hallelujah he said i know the son of man was revealed in my day but he said when the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing hallelujah hallelujah it manifests the son of man again and we know brother branham was not the son of man but the flesh is not the son of man the son of man is the word right he was a son of man revealing the son of man brother brown says that the angel was not the son of man that's pretty clear he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on he said you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man but god revealed himself through a prophet he did he revealed himself through flesh he revealed himself through flesh to reveal himself through flesh now i hope you're with me because many people don't follow it all the way through he revealed himself through flesh and i watch people and sometimes preachers are scared to preach about what brother branham said about those things and why would we be scared of that he did that to do this right he revealed himself in the flesh to reveal himself in flesh because he's also not only is he dressing his bride in the word but he is continuing his work of redemption and i want us to get that today because he's doing that in and through the bride now people say well redemption is over well brother branham said when he preached that sermon we said could it be he talked about how that it could be the last call it could be just preaching to the eternal lost and souls that are imprisoned now brother brown said if it is my kids can't be saved i'm so glad that it wasn't right because i wouldn't have been able to be saved but there is something something that happened right something happened but there's still redemption going on and i hope you follow me through this this morning but it manifests the son of man again there's got to be something that takes place for that to happen amen so he is continuing his work of redemption into the bride see after esther was made queen she had something to do that's right she wasn't done she was involved then i hope you hear me this morning she was then involved in a work of redemption amen amen why do we keep going don't give up on anybody no you have to deal with sin but don't give up on anybody because god works redemption through your life there should be nobody that we're afraid of in the sense of oh i'm afraid that if i go around him i'll just become like them no you you have to but but make sure you do things according to the word follow the word right there's certain things that we have to do as a church but there's nobody that we meet that we can't affect their life we have to believe that way now there may be eternal loss there who've rejected the message but look if that person is eternally lost he won't know it the person who's crossed the line doesn't know that he's crossed on i really believe that and brother branham said make several statements to that effect the person that's crossed the line would just not care in fact they may believe that they're a christian they absolutely believe it but they've crossed the line but a person who hasn't crossed the line feels conviction and so you take that and when we're dealing with people we deal with everybody because they're people right and i've said that recently but everybody is worth a conversation right everybody is and i'm not the best at conversating but the truth is everybody's worth a conversation everybody's worth a smile you say well that person might go to hell they might but that's a human being everybody's worth a smile everybody's worth setting an example too because you don't know who is and who isn't and the work of redemption is done in this hour through you esther had a work to do esther 14 mordecai is talking to esther he said foreign thou altogether listen if you hold your peace esther 4 14 if you hold your peace at this time then there shall enlargement of deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this you see the bride has the work to do after the coming of the mighty angel with an open book in revelation 10 john is told to prophesy again revelation 10 and 10 i took the little book out of the angel's hand i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings now watch and i'll go through this and and and we'll close in not too long but i just want us to get it this morning because the word will do something in our lives that's eternal what i say doesn't mean a whole lot but the word what the word says will mean a lot and if i speak the word then you can accept it as the word if it's not the word throw it away right i'll give you permission to do that i feel comfortable doing that because brother branham did that he said if you find a pit he said to throw the pit away don't throw away the whole pie right so now brother branham says this in the church age book he said from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas no man made creeps whether it's convenient or not say well it would be convenient for me to believe this it looks like i could help the church if i taught this but is it something that he taught right is it something that you've been given to dress yourself with how can we present the church garments other than that which we've been given in this hour to be dressed with right now she's a virgin because she knows no man made creature dogmas by and through now listen by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled say what is god doing today the work of redemption amen he might reveal something to you where you don't even realize it you get somebody on your heart you begin to pray for that person you begin to work and pray maybe that's all you do is pray but maybe you reach out maybe you talk to them maybe you deal with them in a certain way you're not realizing god is working redemption through you that's right buying through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin he said the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest amen that word of promise he said well i know he did that brother branham he did but he's doing that in us today because the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6. amen i heard an amen from joel in there must be good now look he said speaking of mayor he said he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because listen she accepted his word to her what did she say be it unto me be it unto me according to thy word could we do that today he said well i'm looking for something great to happen be unto me according to thy word whatever your word says that's what i want in my life if your word calls for these signs shall follow them that believe that's what i want in my life if your word calls me to prayer if your word calls me to study if your word caused me to reach out to those around me that's what i want in my life she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials amen for he is their head and all power belongs to him and they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads that's why i'm walking right now my body's subject to my head sometimes i trip because it's not all together subject right if you've ever had a stroke brother jt and then were watching this morning if they ever if you had a stroke or something like that and maybe some of the rest of you have dealt with things like that physically in your body your mind will tell you tell it what to do but the body just don't obey the body just don't work like it's supposed to but this body amen this body works like it's supposed to he said notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father amen he says john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary he said the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work well in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride this is what a prophet dressed us in right this is the hour we have to be dressed you've got to be dressed before you're united and if you're dressed in united then what is he doing what's he doing with you now you're dressed you're united with him with the word what are you doing you're doing what he would do amen you're fulfilling his own word he is fulfilling his own word in you he said he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry he works so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen what is that work it's his final work of redemption now watch redemption again is not over but it has changed something changed at the opening of the seals remember when christ came and hung on a cross the veil of the temple was rent many of you you know where i'm going this morning but when he hung on a cross the veil of the temple was rent and it showed that there was no mercy left in that place because the mercy seat come from the cross or come from come from the out of where it was the shekinah everything left there was just an altar there it left that place and the mercy seat was now hanging in plain view the mercy seat was christ right how many know that the mercy seat was christ right and brother branham tells us i didn't get the quote today but brother branham tells us that the mercy seat now is in the heart of his people so what he tells us go back to revelation chapter five number one i think it is he says the mercies in the heart of the people so what happened then he was hanging on a cross he leaves the cross the spirit that was in him there leaves and he and he goes on the day of pentecost and divides himself among the 120 and what happens they become the mercy seat that's right and so when when peter walked out and he said this is that that was god's mercy god's place of mercy right that's how you could obtain mercy you couldn't get it by following the law anymore you couldn't get it that way anymore there's no mercy left in that place amen now you find that when jesus was some mercy see he he cried when he was on on that cross he cried father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and one day a young man named steven is being stoned and paul is standing by listening watching holding the coats for the people who are doing it concurring with it going along with it they're stoning stephen and stephen cries out lord lay not this sin to their charge why the mercy seat moved from the cross amen amen why didn't paul cross the line amen when he stoned it was was right there with him stoning stephen why didn't he cross the line there was mercy where did it come from stephen said don't lay this thing to their charge so paul could later say i did it ignorantly very bad so he become the mercy seat what had happened when paul come down on that day i'm closing in just a moment what happened when paul when when he receives something from god and he sees the pillar of fire and gets knocked off his horse he is sent to ananias right why is he sent to ananias he needed mercy he said god could have given it to him just right there he could have but this was god's way of doing things through people god's always used man now brother branham says the unveiling of god and that's why i got excited the other day and brother joel posted a quote from the unveiling of god and i kind of got excited because i had been pondering these things and the unveiling of god was a highly misunderstood message in fact brother branham at first didn't want to let it out but it was highly misunderstood but one of the greatest sermons brother random ever preached because if we can see it for what it is he's not just talking about himself he's talking about us right now look he says oh church if this tape goes out he said can't you see ministers of the gospel where you're living can't you see the hour that we're in god's showing himself setting aside amen god's showing himself aren't you glad he did in this hour aren't you glad he still does see if you can't see that he's showing himself now you end up with de facto atheist say yeah i see that he come and revealed himself as the son of man but what is he doing today huh look he said showing himself look he took that temple veil and tore it to pieces that they might see god in plain view and they was too blind to see it listen and he's done the same thing today putting his word right out in front what he promised every promise in the word laying right before us in plain view very bad amen denominations that veiled it off that mercy that was available there on the day of pentecost denominations veiled it with creeds and dogmas but in this day the veils have been ran again and the mercy seat lay in front of us when he died brother brown says the god of heaven came down like he did on mount sinai with holy fire burnt that temple veil from top to bottom tore it apart what could they do look right there out of the temple window on calvary there was god in plain view the sacrifice but they don't see it yet today god in this last day has rent those traditions away and brought the word for this age right plain and view and they still don't know it they just don't know it it's so simple see it's just so simple it's so far away from the things of the world see god identified himself with his prophet in such a way that he not only spoke the word but he even manifested the word as a as with the fullness of the word present and i hope you're staying with me that's what we can be not with the gift that he had but with the same authority with the same with the same god that's living today amen now what does the mercy seat do what happens at the mercy seat god speaks all right number 789 when moses was going into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy it was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him you'll find that in that the mercy seat is called the oracle or the speaking place the speaking place amen amen don't you see why satan is trying to quieten the bride today don't you see why all this stuff has come try to try to stop church try to stop ministers but the brahms talked about it how that they would try to stop that mark of the beast would come and try to make it where the bride they couldn't give comfort right he talked about how they would stop preachers from giving comfort he talked about how that that there would be this mark of the beast so try to shut churches down and we know that we know that those things are in the future because brother branham says before they shut us up we'll go up right but look at it coming why is it coming in this hour because this is the speaking place not this pulpit this isn't the mercy seat this is the mercy seat you are the mercy right then what is the mercy see the speaking place right it's a speaking place moses went to the mercy seat and heard god speak hey ben what did esther do esther spoke said if you keep quiet during this time what will happen to god's people amen she spoke mercy to mordecai judgment to haman the rejecter brother branham and you so familiar with this quote musicians go ahead and come or i'm not going to quit but you're so familiar with this quote brother brown said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her why she doesn't speak from the mercy seat amen in this hour when they rejected christ and he hung there in plain view they rejected the word of this hour what happened the mercy seat come in hearts are you with me now amen he said so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her it's a speaking place how's god going to speak through the bride has to we can't say anything different from what the messenger said because that's the only thing she has to speak right but the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come amen once more the world will hear direct from god listen as at pentecost hallelujah you say brother ben these things you talk about these things and you don't understand what i'm going through right now but if you could just lift up above that for a moment if you could just look past the problems for just a few minutes if you're watching today and maybe you know i wish i could be at church there's just so many problems look just lift yourself up above that for a moment you're the speaking place you're the mercy seat of god it's in your heart you may have had failures and faults and everything else but you're the bride you've been washed for the bleeding word now you stand perfect unadulterated as if you've never done it in the first place you are the speaking place hallelujah oh then why are we speaking less than we've ever spoke in prayer we ought to be speaking with more confidence than we've ever spoken in church we ought to speak with more authority than we've ever speak spoken with before to our families we ought to speak peace to our homes we have to speak peace and safety and god moving among our among the people what is the antichrist system speaking there he's preaching peace and safety but it's a trick it's a lie but you are sheltered under his wings that's right you can speak that brother brown showed us that in his own life and through the word once more the world will hear direct from god as that pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first stage don't expect people to agree with you i remember let's go ahead and play something softly i remember when i first began to recognize some things about this message that were true i just being naive i guess i thought everybody would once they've learned it from me right once i told it to them they were going to get it i figured out brother ronnie it's just not that way not everybody's meant to receive it [Music] but listen they took an amalekite man one day and there was a bones of elisha i preached about it no longer ago it was the bones of elisha laying there in a grave and they threw a dead body onto those bones and this man got up [Music] it's the quickening power of god amen you know if you do that through those bones just being in proximity and i thought about this thursday as i was with my friend i thought if i could just get these bones into a place where they could be in proximity with someone who needed mercy amen if that person is ordained to life they will come to life amen amen if there's ever been an hour we should speak it's this hour if there's ever been an hour we should call out to god it's this hour we should not stop we should not let up we should not let the devil call us into submission he said well there's so much going on yes but this is the hour when the pride becomes a speaking place the place where god speaks what is god doing today speaking to the bride you speak with your life every sunday you speak where you're at whether you go to church or not it's true not just on sunday though on monday and tuesday wednesday thursday and friday and saturday you speak with your life your speaking place don't let the devil lie to you and say there's nothing going on speak be an instrument of mercy say god help me to do that is that your desire today let's just bow our heads and talk to him for a moment lord jesus i believe this is your masterpiece pride i had nothing to do with it but lord your bride not just in this place but all around the world oh god but you want your bride to speak amen oh lord help us to speak by our actions lord if we're brother said if you're a preacher preach your message live your preacher's sermon but if you're he said and live it too but if you're not a preacher live your sermon he said oh how jeffersonville needs thousands of lived voices or may it be so unhardy lord maybe so an ash flat and in the hot springs and there in mammoth spring wherever we're from lord oh god may it be so that it's a thunder to the enemy of mercy to those who will receive mercy judgment to those who will reject mercy oh god may we be your speaking place today we want mercy lord we want mercy with was listening brother man preaching that sermon so many years ago he said lord we don't want it to be to the eternally lost we we want mercy lord may it be so in our heart may that be our cry our desire we want mercy lord may i never get away from that oh god help us each one in our hearts help us to become that mercy see why do we love mercy so much because that's where the mercy seat is the giver of mercy is in our hearts with that giver of mercy with that blood sprinkled on our hearts that life of christ on the believer we only think of mercy oh god may it be so we know one day you'll lift your bride from the earth there'll be no more mercy then to the gentile world it'll all be gone but oh god i pray that you would move while mercy is still here lord if there's one that listens to this or is listening now are here present doesn't have that mercy seat speaking in their life oh god will they come to terms with you and may they wall off everything lord oh god my friend that i met this week oh god you know lord surely there's mercy for him you don't even know if he believes in you lord but surely there's mercy look around us and see people that lord that maybe they don't deserve it but surely there's mercy just once more lord may we become
