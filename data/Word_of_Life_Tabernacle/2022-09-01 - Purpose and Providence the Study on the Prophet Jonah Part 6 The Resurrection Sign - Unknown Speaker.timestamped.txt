[37:31] always try to pray about our service
[37:32] schedule and what to do and and how to
[37:35] have church when to have church and all

[37:40] in that as far as when you show up so we
[37:43] always appreciate that you coming
[37:45] we're a body we do things as a body and
[37:48] sometimes you may not agree with
[37:49] everything so well it should be done
[37:51] differently but when the body moves you
[37:53] move with it because you're part of the
[37:55] body and it all comes out all right and
[37:58] in the end and so we're grateful for
[38:00] that and and uh we'll have one service
[38:03] this sunday

[38:12] to spend with your families i recognize
[38:14] that these sundays are hard but it's
[38:16] also been very fruitful for us to have a
[38:18] sunday afternoon service and so
[38:21] we want to continue to do that and then
[38:24] but this sunday just one service because
[38:25] of the holiday and i'll be here this
[38:28] sunday the next sunday i won't be here

[39:27] rather have it that way than than
[39:29] nothing to do but we've got things to do
[39:31] we got something to do tonight let's get
[39:32] into the word matthew 12 and 38
[39:35] then certain of the scribes and of the
[39:36] pharisees answered saying master
[39:39] we would see a sign from thee but he
[39:42] answered and said unto them an evil and
[39:44] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[39:46] sign
[39:48] in other words prove to me
[39:50] that what you're saying is true
[39:52] he said an evil and adulterous
[39:54] generation seeks after that there shall
[39:56] no sign be given to it but the sign of
[39:58] the prophet jonas for as jonas was three
[40:01] days and three nights in the whale's
[40:02] belly
[40:03] so shall the son of man be three days
[40:05] and three nights in the heart of the
[40:07] earth
[40:08] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[40:10] judgment with this generation and shall
[40:12] condemn it because they repented at the
[40:15] preaching of jonas
[40:16] behold a greater than jonas is here
[40:20] amen don't you believe that greater one
[40:22] is here tonight
[40:23] amen
[40:24] let's bow our heads together for a word
[40:26] of prayer we've talked
[40:27] and and done different things let's just
[40:29] ask god to be with us tonight heavenly
[40:32] father we're so grateful for your
[40:33] presence that we've already felt in the
[40:35] song service lord i'm grateful for these
[40:37] people that have come together in unity
[40:39] lord on a wednesday night and lord and

[40:46] help us to
[40:48] lord that there would be signs of life

[40:52] sign of the resurrection in whatever way
[40:54] that you called for us to do it i pray

[41:04] would meet that need tonight or maybe
[41:06] someone that's watching i know several
[41:08] that couldn't be here or watching

[41:15] from the service but especially lord for
[41:18] these that are here i pray just a
[41:20] special blessing on a wednesday night as

[41:36] tonight
[41:40] jonah walks out of a fish's belly
[41:44] when he should have been dead
[41:47] i i wish i had time i'd just stop and
[41:49] preach on this the whole service
[41:52] brother branham said the fish goes up to
[41:54] the edge of the water goes up to the
[41:56] edge of the land and out of the water
[41:58] and sticks his tongue out
[42:00] that's a big fish jonah comes walking
[42:03] out you know walking out of a fishes but
[42:05] he's got seaweed around his neck he's
[42:07] got vomit and all kinds of stuff on him
[42:09] but he's alive
[42:12] he's the first man ever walked alive out
[42:14] of a fish's belly he should have been
[42:16] dead
[42:17] he should have been dead some of us know
[42:19] what that feels like
[42:20] we know what that's like we should have
[42:22] been dead
[42:23] every intellectual thought every
[42:25] everything that that we can think of we
[42:28] we could think like this that well i
[42:31] should have went uh the way my brother
[42:33] did or my sister did or my mother did or
[42:36] my father did or my family did that's
[42:38] what i should have been i should have
[42:40] been a drug addict i should have should
[42:41] have been an alcoholic i should have
[42:43] been
[42:44] whatever in sexual sin or whatever that
[42:46] it was but god protected me god kept me
[42:49] i come out of the belly of the well and
[42:51] some of you may have experienced what
[42:53] it's like to be spiritually dead but you
[42:56] walked out one day and you begin to show
[42:58] what was the sign of the resurrection in
[43:01] jonah he was alive
[43:03] he was alive and the fact that he was
[43:05] alive was assigned to those people who
[43:08] worshipped the fish god dagon that that
[43:10] this was assigned to them that the
[43:12] message that jonah brought was true
[43:15] and the sign that the message that we
[43:16] carry today do you believe we carry a
[43:18] message
[43:19] we carry this message we're we're
[43:21] responsible we didn't bring it but we're
[43:24] carrying it today we're responsible for
[43:26] carrying the message and then if we walk
[43:28] out alive we carry the message of people
[43:31] or we'll believe it if they're a seed of
[43:33] god
[43:34] but the reason many times people don't
[43:36] believe is because the body is still
[43:38] dead
[43:39] if there's been no resurrection of the
[43:41] body they're not going to believe what
[43:42] you have to say but if the body's alive
[43:45] that's why we want the church to be
[43:46] alive that's why we want the church to
[43:49] be lively
[43:50] it don't mean that you have to be
[43:51] running and shouting and screaming all
[43:53] the time it means they're signs of life
[43:56] signs of life in the church
[43:58] signs of life in the fellowship paul
[44:00] signs of life at home
[44:02] are you with me today signs of life in
[44:05] your prayer life in your in your time
[44:07] with god there needs to be signs of life
[44:10] evidence of a resurrection
[44:12] because if there's no evidence what
[44:13] difference are we than the baptist
[44:15] what difference is it then we could go
[44:17] to the pentecostal church or somewhere
[44:18] else but there needs to be signs it's
[44:20] more than just shouting in church but
[44:22] it's a sign
[44:24] a life that's there
[44:26] let there be life in the church
[44:28] are you with me tonight i don't want to
[44:30] settle for a dead religion
[44:32] something that has no movement to it you
[44:34] can't tell but when jonah come walking
[44:36] brother jt out of that fish the people
[44:39] knew that man's alive
[44:41] or you hear me tonight
[44:43] the people ought to know that this
[44:45] church is alive
[44:46] it shouldn't be something we have to say
[44:48] well we're a church that's alive i saw
[44:50] you know churches brand themselves all
[44:52] kinds of things i saw a church one time
[44:53] said the church alive well it ought to
[44:55] be that the people recognize that it's
[44:57] alive
[44:58] not because that's what's on the sign
[45:00] but because we are alive
[45:03] we're a living church
[45:05] the peter says you're lively stones
[45:08] we weren't called to death
[45:10] we're called to life and that evidences
[45:11] itself manifests itself in our everyday
[45:14] life in everything that we do not just
[45:16] in the church house but everywhere else
[45:18] but we're not
[45:19] we're not worried about you say well i i
[45:22] feel like that nothing's going right but
[45:23] if you're alive you're alive for a
[45:25] reason
[45:26] you come out of the belly of hell and
[45:28] you walked out carrying a message
[45:31] and so everything with jonah was exactly
[45:33] where god wanted it to be
[45:36] are you hearing me tonight but brown
[45:38] said many times we get nervous
[45:40] and we begin to think well it ought to
[45:42] be this way
[45:45] we get nervous and we begin to think
[45:47] well it ought to be this way
[45:49] well so they don't know what they're
[45:51] doing we we need to change this we need
[45:53] to we need to fix this no he said he
[45:55] said we've got to make it this way or
[45:57] make it that way he said we don't have
[45:59] nothing to do into it
[46:01] just play our part that he leads us to
[46:03] play
[46:05] right because we're part of that lively
[46:06] stone that lively body
[46:09] right we're a part of that body that's
[46:11] alive let me show you sometimes it's
[46:12] very simple in one way in another way
[46:14] it's very deep but we're a part of that
[46:17] sign of the resurrection
[46:19] because we're part of the body
[46:21] we have a we are partaker in a son of
[46:24] man ministry
[46:26] in the revealing of the son of man
[46:28] because we are part of that body
[46:31] so now
[46:32] he said we don't have nothing to do and
[46:34] into it you just play
[46:36] our part that he leads us to play if
[46:38] you're a deacon you play the part of a
[46:39] deacon if you're a trustee you play the
[46:41] part of a trustee if you're the pastor
[46:43] you play the part of the pastor and
[46:44] minister the part of the minister
[46:46] housewife the part of the housewife are
[46:48] you with me tonight you're playing the
[46:50] part you're not worried about what
[46:51] somebody else is doing what some of the
[46:53] church is doing what some of their
[46:55] family in the church is doing you don't
[46:57] spend all your time worrying about that
[46:59] but you're going to play your part
[47:02] you have a part right each one of you
[47:04] and i could call all of you out but each
[47:06] one of you has a part i get encouraged
[47:08] when i when i see some of you and just
[47:10] come into the house of god and i think
[47:12] what an effort that you put forth to
[47:14] come to the house of god you've got a
[47:16] part in the body of christ
[47:18] you've got a part in the resurrection
[47:20] some of you young families that are
[47:22] raising your children right and we see
[47:23] your children begin to grow up in the
[47:25] fear and admonition of the lord you've
[47:26] got a part in the life of the body of
[47:28] christ
[47:29] you older folks that have to get up and
[47:32] and really push yourself to come to
[47:33] church brother bill but that's you're
[47:35] part of the resurrection life
[47:37] you're part of that revealing of the son
[47:39] of man
[47:40] i'm getting ahead of myself but i'm
[47:42] going to show you here after a while
[47:43] you're a part of that
[47:45] we are the revelation of the word right
[47:49] i hope you're hearing me tonight
[47:51] but you try to make it work this way or
[47:53] make it work that way just play our part
[47:56] that he leads us to play
[47:58] don't worry about everybody else's part
[48:00] remember he said there's nothing out of
[48:02] cater
[48:04] well it's hard to swallow it but it's
[48:06] true
[48:07] there's nothing out
[48:09] of cater
[48:11] oh that makes some of us republicans
[48:13] because the republicans aren't in power
[48:15] right now we get we get upset when
[48:16] that's but there's nothing out of
[48:18] caterer
[48:20] god meant for it to be just like it is
[48:23] if there's insane people in power god
[48:25] put them there
[48:30] are you with me tonight
[48:32] well it ought to be this way or that way
[48:33] just just play our part
[48:36] the pharisees asked jesus for a sign
[48:40] and he told them he said the only sign
[48:41] they would get was the sign
[48:43] of the resurrection as jonah was three
[48:45] days and three nights in the whale's
[48:46] belly so shall the son of man be three
[48:48] days and three nights in the heart of
[48:50] the earth don't have to deal with this
[48:51] because i've been asked
[48:52] this question and you might be asking it
[48:54] usually by
[48:55] someone who maybe would be critical of
[48:57] the scripture and they'll tell you well
[48:59] he jesus wasn't in the grave three days
[49:01] and three nights
[49:02] i mean you have ever thought about that
[49:04] or heard that question
[49:06] and so i want to deal with that before
[49:07] we move on
[49:09] three days and three nights now in the
[49:11] jewish mind in the jewish reckoning
[49:14] three days and three nights would be
[49:16] was reckoned so if any part of a day was
[49:19] a day
[49:20] any part of a night was it was any part
[49:22] of a day was a part of a day and a night
[49:23] and the day began at sunset
[49:26] not in the morning like ours does
[49:28] so he was literally there in the jewish
[49:30] thought three days and three nights now
[49:33] brother branham was asked this question
[49:35] though and he brings in a little bit
[49:36] deeper thought on it
[49:38] and begins to talk about the scripture
[49:40] and it's very important because how we
[49:42] look at the scriptures many times we
[49:45] look at one scripture and we're trying
[49:46] to make that fit
[49:48] but first of all there's things that we
[49:50] know
[49:50] but we have a question about something
[49:52] else well don't move the things you know
[49:55] or give up the things you know
[49:57] for the question to try to make the
[49:58] question fit
[50:00] does that make sense you move what you
[50:01] have a question about towards the thing
[50:03] that you know
[50:05] right and that's the way we study the
[50:06] scripture so we we want to look at what
[50:09] we know there's some things we know
[50:11] right and that's where people make a
[50:13] mistake in the message they begin to
[50:14] think well brother branham was the son
[50:16] of man but the randoms coming back and
[50:17] all this stuff was because they they've
[50:19] forgotten the things we know
[50:22] right the things we know and they tried
[50:24] to move what we know over to what we
[50:26] what they imagine
[50:27] but so what we know is and this is what
[50:30] brother branham taught us
[50:31] the prophet said i will not suffer my
[50:33] holy one to see corruption
[50:35] brother branham said it's within three
[50:36] days and three nights within three days
[50:38] and three nights he said because you
[50:40] can't make the scripture lie
[50:42] and the prophet said i'll not suffer my
[50:44] holy one to see corruption some of us
[50:46] legalists would have liked for him to be
[50:47] there three days
[50:49] and three nights and come out one minute
[50:50] later but corruption would have set in
[50:54] right
[50:54] so this scripture says i will not suffer
[50:56] my holy one to see corruption over here
[50:58] we see three days and three nights again
[51:00] you got to move this
[51:02] to fit with this
[51:04] and because we know that he can't see
[51:06] corruption now
[51:07] he said sometime within
[51:09] its corruption sets in the human body in
[51:11] 72 hours sometime within that three days
[51:13] and three nights
[51:14] that he must come forth from the grave
[51:17] so being three days and three nights
[51:18] don't mean it has to be exactly that
[51:21] sometime within that three days and
[51:23] three nights he had to come forth
[51:24] because the prophecy cannot be broken he
[51:27] could not see corruption it would have
[51:29] corrupted if he had stayed exactly that
[51:31] time he'd say well
[51:32] couldn't god have reversed the
[51:33] corruption well the scripture says in
[51:35] acts 2 31 that he he did not see
[51:37] corruption
[51:38] he said he's seeing this before spake of
[51:40] the resurrection of christ that his soul
[51:43] was not left in hell neither his flesh
[51:45] did see corruption
[51:47] so he the prophecy when it was fulfilled
[51:49] was fulfilled exactly like it should
[51:51] have been
[51:52] so
[51:53] we began to look at that then and he
[51:55] said this was a sign
[51:57] this was a sign are you still with me
[51:59] tonight
[52:00] this is a sign it's a resurrected body
[52:04] what is the proof of resurrection
[52:07] remember joe somebody come to you and
[52:09] and you'd put somebody in the ground
[52:11] and and as as a funeral director and you
[52:14] you'd watch them go into the ground
[52:16] and somebody come to you and said
[52:17] so-and-so's raised from the dead
[52:19] and you would say
[52:21] i preached on not too long ago it kind
[52:23] of sounds bad but show me the body
[52:26] right produce the body
[52:28] right let me see a living body
[52:31] of that person
[52:32] right so the the live body
[52:35] is proof of a resurrection
[52:37] right that's a body with life in it
[52:41] but not just anybody with any life
[52:44] right because if someone told you that i
[52:46] had raised from the dead if i was put
[52:48] myself i'll just use myself so i don't
[52:49] hurt anybody's feelings or or put
[52:51] anybody prematurely in the grave tonight
[52:54] but i'll just use myself if i something
[52:56] would happen and i passed away in the
[52:57] next few days and you guys had a great
[53:00] big funeral and wept and cried and
[53:02] everything like that like i know that
[53:03] you would and you'd be so sad that i
[53:05] passed away and then
[53:07] and then a few days later people start
[53:09] you start hearing rumors brother ben's
[53:11] got up
[53:12] he's resurrected he's not in the grave
[53:14] anymore
[53:16] well you'd probably be skeptical
[53:18] right the first thing you'd say well i
[53:20] know he was a christian but man we're
[53:22] supposed to be a general resurrection
[53:24] right
[53:25] and where's our other loved ones so you
[53:27] begin to question that and say well what
[53:29] is it and say well i saw him down at the
[53:31] pool hall he was down there shooting
[53:32] pool and
[53:33] and he was down there
[53:35] down there playing cards and he was
[53:36] alive though but that's where he was
[53:39] now what would you think
[53:40] i hope you know me well enough
[53:44] to know number one i'm not very good at
[53:46] pool
[53:47] and i don't never even use playing cards
[53:50] the real ones
[53:52] we we're christians you know we use the
[53:54] ones without any
[53:58] no dice or anything you know so this way
[54:00] i was raised so
[54:01] so we uh uh we you wouldn't expect me to
[54:04] be there
[54:07] you know use another example you say
[54:08] well brother ben's raised from the dead
[54:10] i know it said how do you know he was
[54:12] down there running the 100 yard dash
[54:16] wasn't him
[54:22] it's not the same life
[54:25] right if i had the kind of body to run a
[54:27] 100 yard dash i wouldn't do it
[54:32] then i wouldn't need to right
[54:34] what's the point if you're already
[54:35] skinny
[54:38] so
[54:39] so the point is you've got to be the
[54:41] same life
[54:43] right for in order for you to believe in
[54:45] a resurrection you've got to not only
[54:47] see life but the same life
[54:50] oh church how are people going to
[54:51] believe what we're telling them about a
[54:53] restoration message
[54:55] about a resurrected jesus christ about a
[54:58] son of man ministry if the church is
[55:00] dead
[55:01] and it's not what it was at the
[55:02] beginning but if the church is alive
[55:05] and it has the same life as it did at
[55:07] the beginning then it proves that he's
[55:09] alive
[55:11] amen
[55:13] hallelujah
[55:15] you all have been so good to preach to
[55:17] lately i almost don't want to let
[55:18] anybody else preach
[55:22] what is it proof of a resurrection
[55:26] oh i'm running out of time and i'm not
[55:27] barely into it now
[55:29] look
[55:30] a body with life
[55:33] the same life that went in the grave now
[55:35] in acts 1 3 it says that he showed
[55:37] himself alive after his passion or after
[55:39] his crucifixion by many infallible
[55:42] proofs
[55:43] infallible proofs
[55:45] being seen of him 40 days and speaking
[55:48] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[55:50] of god so the infallible proof was that
[55:53] he was alive
[55:54] and he was doing the things that he did
[55:56] before
[55:58] right
[55:59] so now he convinced them that's what
[56:01] that word means infallible proof
[56:03] convincing evidence
[56:05] that he was alive he convinced him he
[56:07] was alive by doing the same things he
[56:09] did when he was on the earth
[56:11] now if you take jonah and we'll go back
[56:13] and forth from him tonight but when you
[56:15] take jonah you see that jonah showed the
[56:17] sign of the resurrection to a gentile
[56:19] nation
[56:20] right the ninevites were gentiles
[56:23] and when christ was on the earth he knew
[56:24] the secrets and of the heart and some of
[56:26] you know where i'm going with this but
[56:28] we'll just go through it and so we get
[56:30] to the end in order he said he re he
[56:32] revealed himself to the jews
[56:35] by that sign
[56:36] uh you find that in john 1 47 he saw
[56:38] nathanael coming to him he said behold
[56:40] an israelite indeed in humans no gal
[56:43] daniel says whis knoweth thou me and
[56:45] jesus answered before philip called you
[56:47] when you were under the fig tree i saw
[56:49] you
[56:51] what was it proof of his messiahship
[56:54] no the jews would understand he'd done
[56:56] this before
[56:57] when elohim come and sat under a tree
[57:00] and told sarah what the thoughts of her
[57:02] heart was
[57:04] amen
[57:05] so now nathanael said rabbi thou art the
[57:08] son of god
[57:09] thou art the king of israel
[57:11] now watch it was nathanael who said that
[57:13] now jesus is much more direct with the
[57:15] samaritan woman and part of the reason i
[57:18] believe that jesus wasn't very direct
[57:19] with the jews is because they wanted to
[57:22] anoint him as a king they did not
[57:23] understand they were looking for a
[57:25] political messiah
[57:27] when he went to the samaritans he could
[57:29] be a little bit more free actually with
[57:31] who he was because the samaritans were
[57:34] not looking for a political messiah they
[57:36] were actually looking for
[57:38] a savior they were looking for someone
[57:41] to come and reveal all things
[57:44] because they were looking for moses
[57:45] prophecy of a prophet like unto me to
[57:48] come to pass because they only believed
[57:49] the books of moses they rejected david
[57:52] so now here was the samaritan woman in
[57:54] john 4 25 the woman saith in him i know
[57:57] that messiah cometh which is called
[57:59] christ when he has come he will tell us
[58:02] all things
[58:03] and jesus is much more bold with her he
[58:05] said unto her i speak to thee am he
[58:09] amen so now but again he showed the sign
[58:12] by knowing the secret of her heart
[58:15] now the samaritans rejected david but
[58:18] believed moses they weren't looking for
[58:20] a king but for a prophet like in
[58:22] deuteronomy 18 15 the lord thy god will
[58:24] raise up unto the prophet from the midst
[58:25] of thee that brethren like unto me unto
[58:27] him you shall hearken
[58:29] so now
[58:30] and i'm moving fast because i've got
[58:32] somewhere i want to go and i want to get
[58:33] there in as short a time as possible
[58:35] tonight
[58:36] but
[58:37] some of you
[58:39] people that like to pull preachers over
[58:41] for going too fast you're just going to
[58:43] have to be patient tonight
[58:45] and send me a ticket
[58:47] but
[58:48] i said look if that was the sign of the
[58:50] messiah for the jews it was the sign of
[58:52] the messiah when he was here on earth
[58:54] for the samaritans there's only one left
[58:56] for the sign that's the gentiles
[58:58] remember jonah prefigured that
[59:01] by going to the gentiles and coming out
[59:03] alive
[59:05] out of a wealth belly but the gentiles
[59:06] never had the sign
[59:09] of knowing the secrets of the heart
[59:12] remember there was even a gentile woman
[59:14] that come to him
[59:16] and he said it's not worthy to take the
[59:18] children's bread and give it to dogs
[59:20] and she ended up getting her healing but
[59:22] the sign of the messiah was never shown
[59:23] to her
[59:24] they weren't looking for a messiah
[59:26] we weren't looking for a messiah
[59:29] now now the jews were the samaritans
[59:31] were but it was never shown to the
[59:33] gentiles you can find the greeks that
[59:35] come looking for him and brother brown
[59:36] uses that over and over in his ministry
[59:39] sirs we would see jesus
[59:42] they come looking for him but what was
[59:44] it he never showed them the sign of the
[59:46] messiah
[59:47] because to the gentiles that would come
[59:49] later
[59:50] they saw healing but not the not the
[59:52] secrets of the hearts revealed
[59:54] now watch the sign was shown to the old
[59:56] testament in the old testament
[59:58] potentially that's the word brother
[1:00:00] branham used i don't have time for all
[1:00:02] of the quotes tonight but that is the
[1:00:04] word that brother branham used he said
[1:00:05] it was a potential
[1:00:07] sign of the messiah he said it happened
[1:00:09] one time for a few minutes
[1:00:11] for just a few minutes before the
[1:00:13] destruction
[1:00:14] he said it was a potential sign of the
[1:00:17] messiah as the son of man he said
[1:00:19] and and that uh
[1:00:21] now that happened in the days of sodom
[1:00:23] and the days of lot in luke 17 and 28 he
[1:00:26] said likewise also as it was in the days
[1:00:29] of lot they'd eat they drank they bought
[1:00:30] they sold they planted they build it but
[1:00:32] the same day the lot went out of sodom
[1:00:34] and rain fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:00:35] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:00:37] it be in the day when the son of man is
[1:00:39] revealed so
[1:00:41] now the son of man is going to be
[1:00:43] revealed again
[1:00:45] to the gentiles how many understand that
[1:00:47] tonight
[1:00:48] that's not new doctrine right
[1:00:50] that's something we believe the son of
[1:00:51] man is to be revealed again to the
[1:00:53] gentiles at the end time and show the
[1:00:55] sign of knowing the secrets of the heart
[1:00:59] but again the son of man the revelation
[1:01:01] of the son of man and again i could
[1:01:02] prove it to you with quotes but we'll
[1:01:04] get to a few but
[1:01:06] the son when the son of man is revealed
[1:01:07] that's more than just discernment
[1:01:11] but it's the opening of the word
[1:01:14] it's more than just discernment it's the
[1:01:15] opening of the entire book
[1:01:17] but but it does include that because
[1:01:19] there had to be a part of the body
[1:01:22] that represented that sign of the son of
[1:01:24] man
[1:01:25] and it was in a prophet it was god's
[1:01:27] prophet that he chose to do that now
[1:01:30] as it was in the days of lot the lord
[1:01:32] the bible says the lord appeared unto
[1:01:34] abram in the plains of mamrie he sat in
[1:01:37] the tent door in the heat of the day oh
[1:01:40] that's the kind of day and age that we
[1:01:42] live in in a labor to see an age he sat
[1:01:44] in the tent door in the heat of the day
[1:01:46] and we could go through it but he made
[1:01:48] elohim and flesh welcome he brought him
[1:01:50] under the tree and fixed something for
[1:01:52] him to eat
[1:01:54] and they said unto him in verse 9 where
[1:01:57] is sarah thy wife he said behold in the
[1:01:59] tent
[1:01:59] and he said now this is elohim in flesh
[1:02:03] he said i will certainly return unto
[1:02:05] thee according to the time of life and
[1:02:08] lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:02:11] sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:02:12] was behind him
[1:02:14] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[1:02:16] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[1:02:17] sarah after the manner of women
[1:02:19] therefore sarah laughed within herself
[1:02:22] saying after i am waxed old shall i have
[1:02:24] pleasure my lord being old also i wonder
[1:02:27] how many times we've sat in church and
[1:02:29] laughed within ourself at the promise of
[1:02:31] god and thought surely not me
[1:02:35] surely not me but god knows what you're
[1:02:37] thinking
[1:02:39] he still does tonight the word is the
[1:02:40] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:02:42] the heart
[1:02:44] and so the lord said to abraham
[1:02:46] wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i
[1:02:48] have a surety bear a child which i'm old
[1:02:50] is anything too hard for the lord
[1:02:52] at the time appointed i will return unto
[1:02:54] thee according to the time of life and
[1:02:57] sarah shall have a son
[1:02:59] now brother branham and i'm going to
[1:03:00] pick up the quotes here for just a
[1:03:02] minute to to show you what i i want to
[1:03:04] want you to see tonight
[1:03:06] and brother branham picks this up he
[1:03:08] said the angel or the messenger the man
[1:03:09] with his back turned to the tent said
[1:03:11] why did sarah say that what was it now
[1:03:14] watch he said after the sacrifice was
[1:03:15] made he vanished
[1:03:17] he said now remember abraham called that
[1:03:19] man elohim how many readers know that
[1:03:21] now now watch who vanished after the
[1:03:24] sacrifice was made jesus christ
[1:03:27] right he's not talking here that was god
[1:03:30] wrapped in flesh
[1:03:32] there now there would be god in flesh at
[1:03:34] the end time a prophet don't let that
[1:03:35] stumble you
[1:03:37] because you're god in flesh
[1:03:39] right he was that prophet part of the
[1:03:41] body
[1:03:43] no one else can fulfill that part he was
[1:03:44] god in flesh
[1:03:48] right so are we
[1:03:51] the problem with the deity doctrine is
[1:03:53] not that they make brother branham god
[1:03:54] in flesh
[1:03:56] it's that they don't make you god in
[1:03:57] flesh
[1:04:00] right but that's why brother brown said
[1:04:02] it it's so close to the truth
[1:04:05] right now now watch now after the
[1:04:08] sacrifice was made he vanished he said
[1:04:10] now remember abraham called that man
[1:04:11] elohim he said that's right elohim
[1:04:13] that's almighty god in the form of a man
[1:04:14] he was the word because he could discern
[1:04:16] the thoughts god in flesh what does it
[1:04:18] testify that in the last days
[1:04:20] jesus said when the son of man is being
[1:04:22] revealed to his promised church he said
[1:04:25] the church that's not down yonder in
[1:04:26] babylon
[1:04:27] we got a babylon church he said you know
[1:04:29] that and denominations they're in
[1:04:31] babylon and we got a billy graham and
[1:04:33] oral roberts and him out there he said
[1:04:34] banging away at them too so in other
[1:04:36] words they're getting preached too god
[1:04:37] is
[1:04:39] right they're getting preached to but
[1:04:41] many of them is blinding their eyes
[1:04:44] right because that's the day and age
[1:04:45] that we live in
[1:04:46] and there's got to be many that are have
[1:04:48] their eyes minded and then go through
[1:04:49] the tribulation period and become the
[1:04:50] foolish virgin
[1:04:52] but there was one to the called out
[1:04:54] elected church aren't you glad to be a
[1:04:56] part of that tonight
[1:04:58] the elected church don't that make you
[1:04:59] feel special it ought to because you had
[1:05:02] nothing to do with that that was all god
[1:05:05] there was one who come to the elected
[1:05:07] church excuse me that was called that
[1:05:11] was showing the sign and begin to lose
[1:05:12] my voice i haven't done that in a while
[1:05:15] i'm a little bit excited about this
[1:05:16] tonight if you can't tell
[1:05:18] he said it was showing the sign that god
[1:05:20] was in flesh
[1:05:23] now watch
[1:05:24] you say i believe that brother ben i
[1:05:26] believe that god elohim came and
[1:05:28] tabernacled himself in that body there
[1:05:30] and stood in front of abraham and i
[1:05:32] believe that god tabernacled himself and
[1:05:34] william branham i believe that i believe
[1:05:37] that that was god in a measure and
[1:05:38] william branham i believe that that's
[1:05:40] wonderful
[1:05:42] but now
[1:05:43] look was the sign of the resurrection
[1:05:46] to be only in a prophet in this state
[1:05:48] was in jonah's day yeah sure right he
[1:05:51] was the body
[1:05:53] that was raised from the dead and come
[1:05:55] out
[1:05:56] it was in jesus day
[1:05:59] he was the body that was raised from the
[1:06:01] dead and come out but remember it didn't
[1:06:02] stay that way
[1:06:05] he was the wave sheath that was waved
[1:06:06] over them
[1:06:08] you remember at the end of the feast
[1:06:09] they waved the wave sheath and but then
[1:06:11] 50 days later
[1:06:12] they cooked amen the barley loaf and it
[1:06:15] come out
[1:06:17] at barley
[1:06:17] day of pentecost
[1:06:19] so now the son of man had distributed
[1:06:21] who he was all that god was he poured
[1:06:23] into christ all that christ was he
[1:06:25] poured into the church and now he's
[1:06:26] distributed himself in the church so
[1:06:28] from that time till this time the church
[1:06:30] the body is not a one body
[1:06:33] but it's a mini-membered body
[1:06:36] are you with me not that didn't change
[1:06:37] for a few years in 1960s and then come
[1:06:40] back
[1:06:42] right that's not what the son of man is
[1:06:44] it's a misunderstanding
[1:06:46] now the messenger gave the sign
[1:06:49] but the voice of the sign
[1:06:52] remember it was the messenger who gave
[1:06:54] the sign to abraham but where was the
[1:06:56] sign manifested
[1:06:58] it was in abraham's life
[1:07:00] it was in sarah's life
[1:07:02] that the voice of the sign was
[1:07:04] manifested in abraham and sarah's bodies
[1:07:06] i hope i'm not losing you i know it's a
[1:07:07] little bit deep tonight but i think i
[1:07:10] think you're we're mature enough we can
[1:07:11] we can grab a hold of something he said
[1:07:14] jesus was god in flesh
[1:07:16] it's a continuation of that same quote
[1:07:18] by the way
[1:07:20] he said and if jesus is in you tonight
[1:07:23] it's still god
[1:07:25] manifesting himself in the last days the
[1:07:28] son of man
[1:07:30] revealing himself in his church
[1:07:34] the human flesh
[1:07:36] making himself
[1:07:38] known
[1:07:39] he said you get it god down here in his
[1:07:42] church
[1:07:43] making himself again the word
[1:07:47] glory the son of man being revealed in
[1:07:50] the last days he said that was a prophet
[1:07:52] yes it was but he was part of the body
[1:07:56] amen so i have a part
[1:07:58] of the revealing of the son of man
[1:08:00] you have a part of the revealing of the
[1:08:02] son of man
[1:08:03] absolutely not that part
[1:08:06] because that was reserved for one man
[1:08:07] because it had to show that he had to do
[1:08:09] that in that body just like he did in
[1:08:11] his earthly body
[1:08:13] but that's part of the corporal of the
[1:08:15] the the body on earth the many membered
[1:08:17] body of christ
[1:08:19] so now he said the son of man being
[1:08:20] revealed in the last days says it wasn't
[1:08:22] the days of sodom again he said and
[1:08:24] jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:08:25] solomon so shall it be the coming of the
[1:08:27] son of man indeed he veiled again in
[1:08:29] human flesh he said over the men i
[1:08:31] believe that
[1:08:32] now watch he said now remember jesus
[1:08:34] didn't say when the son of god is being
[1:08:36] revealed he goes into that in luke
[1:08:38] 17 30 he said when the son of man is
[1:08:40] being revealed
[1:08:42] he said the son of man back in the
[1:08:43] church again
[1:08:45] notice where he puts the son of man he
[1:08:47] doesn't put him
[1:08:48] it's out here operating by himself
[1:08:51] but the son of man is back in the church
[1:08:53] again
[1:08:54] revealed in human beings
[1:08:58] not son of god but the son of man again
[1:09:01] back in his church again in the last
[1:09:04] days
[1:09:05] you realize what we believe by believing
[1:09:07] in the opening of the word and the
[1:09:08] revealing of the son of man
[1:09:09] now think about it you say well it's not
[1:09:11] important what you believe about that
[1:09:13] okay so if you don't believe that the
[1:09:14] opening of the son of man the opening of
[1:09:16] the word and revealing of the son of man
[1:09:17] has taken place and we're a part of it
[1:09:19] then you don't benefit from it
[1:09:24] and your body can't be changed
[1:09:28] that's pretty harsh
[1:09:29] but it's true because how could it
[1:09:31] because you the word's not open to you
[1:09:34] so you're waiting on the word to be open
[1:09:36] someday but the word is open now i
[1:09:39] believe that's what the message teaches
[1:09:40] i'm not trying to put anybody out but
[1:09:42] this is where we're at
[1:09:44] the word is open now that's why we have
[1:09:46] to come to this brother harvey there was
[1:09:47] a time we didn't understand these things
[1:09:49] but we had to come to this why because
[1:09:52] without coming to this we couldn't be
[1:09:54] abraham and sarah
[1:09:56] and have our bodies change
[1:09:58] are you with me tonight
[1:10:01] the son of man he said will be revealed
[1:10:04] in a body of flesh
[1:10:06] you just want to make it real plain
[1:10:09] you people
[1:10:11] yes sir
[1:10:13] this is one of the last sermons brother
[1:10:14] brandon preached
[1:10:16] you people the church
[1:10:20] you realize how seriously we ought to
[1:10:22] take this thing
[1:10:23] this isn't a you realize how serious
[1:10:25] brother branham took his ministry and
[1:10:27] and as serious as he was about it
[1:10:30] he told him when you come into this
[1:10:31] third pole ministry you've got to be
[1:10:33] more sincere
[1:10:35] he said more sincere to bind that
[1:10:36] serpent he said you've got to be more
[1:10:38] sincere than what you are now you
[1:10:40] realize how seriously we should take
[1:10:42] church
[1:10:43] how seriously we should take work
[1:10:45] how seriously we should take it this
[1:10:46] isn't the time to play around this isn't
[1:10:49] the time to take halfway measures this
[1:10:51] isn't the time to be halfway in and
[1:10:52] halfway out this is a time to be a
[1:10:54] believer but oh what a wonderful time it
[1:10:56] is what a wonderful time to be a
[1:10:58] believer to be assigned to your
[1:11:00] neighbors assigned to your friends
[1:11:02] assigned to your family a sign of the
[1:11:04] resurrection
[1:11:06] a revealing of the son of man
[1:11:09] hey man he said it said it's you people
[1:11:12] the church
[1:11:13] do we believe that tonight
[1:11:15] i wonder if we can grab a hold of that
[1:11:17] you see what's lacking is faith to be
[1:11:18] able to just grab a hold of that right
[1:11:21] we need that kind of faith to believe
[1:11:22] i'm i'm that i'm you people
[1:11:26] he might the people sitting there may
[1:11:28] not have understood it but when i heard
[1:11:30] him say it i'm you people
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] you people the church just exactly like
[1:11:36] it was before the days of sodom a called
[1:11:38] out group away from all of them setting
[1:11:40] out believing the promise of god is that
[1:11:43] us tonight
[1:11:44] glory
[1:11:45] he said but he promised
[1:11:47] just before the coming of the end time
[1:11:49] the world would get like it was in sodom
[1:11:51] when a man come down in human form three
[1:11:53] of them two angels and god himself
[1:11:55] he said that was god the bible said it
[1:11:57] was
[1:11:58] he came down and he manifested himself
[1:12:00] there by turning his back to the tent
[1:12:02] where sarah was and told abraham what
[1:12:04] sarah was thinking in the tent
[1:12:06] he said now jesus himself said that that
[1:12:08] day at the day when the son of man is
[1:12:10] being revealed in other words the son of
[1:12:11] man the ministry of jesus christ himself
[1:12:15] the church will come through
[1:12:16] justification through luther through
[1:12:17] sanctification through wesley the
[1:12:19] baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:12:21] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:12:23] perfection
[1:12:25] of the son of man
[1:12:28] you realize that without this
[1:12:31] without the perfection of the son of man
[1:12:32] without an open book we're still in
[1:12:34] pentecost identified with pentecostal
[1:12:38] chickens hawks
[1:12:40] right hawks he said that there was a
[1:12:41] brother to an eagle should have flown
[1:12:43] higher but didn't right
[1:12:45] right but couldn't fly where the eagles
[1:12:47] fly
[1:12:48] because they weren't called to be eagles
[1:12:49] but that's where we identify ourselves
[1:12:51] when we are not part of that son of man
[1:12:53] ministry
[1:12:54] who would want to go back to being a
[1:12:55] hawk if you've been an eagle
[1:12:57] that's the thing they always were a hawk
[1:12:59] and so they could only fly so high and
[1:13:00] that's why they went back where they
[1:13:02] come from
[1:13:03] but for you and i we're not going back
[1:13:05] we are not of them who go back we are of
[1:13:06] them who believe amen aren't you glad
[1:13:08] for that tonight
[1:13:10] hey man he said and go right on into the
[1:13:12] perfection of the son of man he said
[1:13:14] that's when husband and wife
[1:13:16] will be the same self-persons
[1:13:20] oh god he said god will be so manifested
[1:13:23] into his bride his church so they will
[1:13:26] both be the same
[1:13:29] they are one he said now you see where
[1:13:31] we're at
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:34] now you say well that can't be because
[1:13:36] brother branham was the son of man but
[1:13:37] the random was not the son of man we
[1:13:39] understand that
[1:13:40] they asked brother branham if he was the
[1:13:42] son of man and he wasn't just being
[1:13:44] humble he was a part of the son of man
[1:13:48] that makes sense part of the body
[1:13:50] but he was a son of man revealing the
[1:13:52] son of man he said some say brother
[1:13:54] branham is the son of man i thought the
[1:13:55] pillar of fire was the son of man am i
[1:13:57] mistaken he said well that's a good
[1:13:58] question very good but i am not the son
[1:14:01] of man but a son of man
[1:14:03] and yet there are churches all over the
[1:14:05] place still teach brother branham is the
[1:14:06] son of man
[1:14:08] and i don't know if you can't take what
[1:14:10] the prophet said plainly then you're
[1:14:11] just going to have to live with that
[1:14:13] i i can't help him if the prophet can't
[1:14:15] but that's just what it is he said this
[1:14:17] but a son of man there's quite a
[1:14:18] difference jesus christ was the son of
[1:14:21] man the son of god
[1:14:23] the son of man the son of david and
[1:14:25] brother brown goes on and explains the
[1:14:26] logos with the pillar of fire
[1:14:29] he said that wasn't the son of man
[1:14:30] either he said i'm not he i'm his
[1:14:32] servant and the pillar of fire is not he
[1:14:34] it's in spirit form which was upon the
[1:14:36] son of man and has come now to anoint
[1:14:39] sons of
[1:14:40] man amen to bring back a ministry
[1:14:45] just exactly like he said it would be
[1:14:46] you see how he always brings himself and
[1:14:49] his ministry back into the body of the
[1:14:51] church
[1:14:52] right he was a part of the body
[1:14:55] i'm glad we have a prophet in the body
[1:14:57] aren't you glad we have a prophet in the
[1:14:59] body we had to have a prophet on this
[1:15:00] day it wasn't enough it had to be a
[1:15:02] prophet to reveal the son of man to know
[1:15:04] the secrets of the hearts god had to
[1:15:06] have a prophet
[1:15:08] there had to be one but there was only
[1:15:10] one of those
[1:15:12] amen he said but now he said to bring
[1:15:15] back a ministry just exactly like he
[1:15:16] said it would be in order for the head
[1:15:18] and the rest of the body to connect
[1:15:20] together
[1:15:21] so again there was only one prophet
[1:15:23] fulfilling luke 17 30.
[1:15:25] one prophet
[1:15:27] and there were many anointed ones at the
[1:15:29] end time
[1:15:30] that come out and tried to mimic what
[1:15:32] that prophet did brother branham spoke
[1:15:33] about them he said that janice and james
[1:15:36] what stood moses the anointed word of
[1:15:38] the hour so will these men not man men
[1:15:40] anointed ones resist the truth
[1:15:43] you know how they do it
[1:15:44] and breaking from the quote for just a
[1:15:46] moment you know how they do that
[1:15:48] they do that by
[1:15:50] by saying
[1:15:51] that if you don't get with this you're
[1:15:52] going to miss it
[1:15:55] right well how can i miss what i already
[1:15:57] have
[1:15:58] again it's like i talked about the other
[1:16:00] day it's like someone coming to you and
[1:16:01] saying hey you're going to be late for
[1:16:02] the wedding
[1:16:05] you're going to be late you better hurry
[1:16:06] up
[1:16:07] i'm already married
[1:16:10] don't have to worry about being late for
[1:16:11] the wedding not anymore
[1:16:15] i had one day that i had to worry about
[1:16:17] being late for the wedding but now i'm
[1:16:18] the husband
[1:16:20] are you with me now now she's the wife
[1:16:22] we're the wife of jesus christ his wife
[1:16:25] has made herself ready
[1:16:27] that's the time that we're living in
[1:16:29] oh that ought to give us faith tonight
[1:16:31] to withstand any challenge the enemy
[1:16:33] would throw at us
[1:16:35] amen so now
[1:16:37] we we are the revealing of the son of
[1:16:39] man in in this hour not the part that he
[1:16:41] revealed but our part
[1:16:43] that's right
[1:16:45] now
[1:16:45] so as janice and james what said moses
[1:16:47] so here were these they say well you're
[1:16:49] missing something you're going to miss
[1:16:50] something you're going to miss something
[1:16:51] no they're anointed ones there was a son
[1:16:53] of man ministry
[1:16:54] there was a one-man ministry
[1:16:57] there was
[1:16:59] right not today
[1:17:01] i'm replaceable
[1:17:03] does that make sense
[1:17:05] god may use many pastors in your life to
[1:17:07] bring you where he wants you to be but
[1:17:09] only one messenger to the age
[1:17:11] he may use many evangelists to bring you
[1:17:13] where he wants you to be not only one
[1:17:15] messenger
[1:17:17] right he brought one messenger there was
[1:17:19] one
[1:17:20] one candlestick
[1:17:22] one lamp on each lampstand on the seven
[1:17:25] golden lampstands the the menorah that
[1:17:27] was there there was one lamp to each age
[1:17:30] that lamp that light has come and gone
[1:17:32] but what are we doing keeping it alive
[1:17:33] today we're carrying we're a part of
[1:17:35] that ministry
[1:17:37] but we're not that man we can't be that
[1:17:39] man and there won't be any others so you
[1:17:41] can't miss it if you accept what's
[1:17:43] already come
[1:17:44] so now they resist the truth he said in
[1:17:47] the very day that the son of man is
[1:17:49] revealed this is now watched they're
[1:17:51] resisting the truth by not accepting
[1:17:52] what's taken place
[1:17:54] he said on the very day that the son of
[1:17:56] man is revealed revelation 10 1-7 read
[1:17:58] it when you get home the seventh angel's
[1:18:00] message opening up the seals
[1:18:02] what is it not the angel is the son of
[1:18:04] man but the messenger is revealing the
[1:18:06] son of man he said can you get it
[1:18:08] separated now so that's where it seems
[1:18:10] to be so hard for you you see he said
[1:18:12] not the son of man himself but the
[1:18:14] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[1:18:16] revealing to the public the son of man
[1:18:19] hallelujah because it's left the shock
[1:18:22] he can't organize it it's the grain
[1:18:24] itself again what's the grain
[1:18:27] we are
[1:18:30] he was just the first one
[1:18:32] you understand he was the first one but
[1:18:34] we're the grain
[1:18:36] again he said i wasn't the one that
[1:18:37] appeared down on the river
[1:18:39] and this is later on you can go and read
[1:18:41] what's in between but later on he said i
[1:18:43] wasn't the only one that appeared down
[1:18:44] on the river i was only standing there
[1:18:46] when he appeared i'm not the one that
[1:18:48] performs these things and foretells
[1:18:49] these things that happens as perfect as
[1:18:51] they are i'm only one that's near when
[1:18:52] he does it it was only a voice that he
[1:18:54] used to say it he said it wasn't what i
[1:18:57] knew it's what i just surrendered myself
[1:18:59] to that he spoke through it isn't me it
[1:19:01] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:19:03] the manifestation of the son of man
[1:19:06] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:19:08] the mystery that god unfolded it's not a
[1:19:10] man it's god
[1:19:11] the angel was not the son of man he was
[1:19:13] the messenger from the son of man the
[1:19:15] son of man is christ you all know this
[1:19:17] quote as well as i do you could quote it
[1:19:19] with me but listen to it tonight he's
[1:19:21] the one that you're feeding on you're
[1:19:23] not feeding on a man
[1:19:25] you're not feeding on a man but his
[1:19:27] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:19:29] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:19:32] man
[1:19:33] glory
[1:19:34] more than a man if it was a man's
[1:19:36] ministry we could look back and critique
[1:19:38] it and run all the way through and say
[1:19:39] well we'll take this part and leave this
[1:19:41] part no we don't do that why because it
[1:19:43] was more than a man
[1:19:45] but god sent a prophet and he stood
[1:19:47] there while the son of man revealed
[1:19:49] himself
[1:19:53] why do you think it'll work any
[1:19:54] differently with you
[1:19:56] if the son of man is going to reveal
[1:19:58] himself through you as an
[1:20:00] as an elder in the church
[1:20:02] how's he going to do that you're just
[1:20:03] going to be standing there
[1:20:05] it's not what you know
[1:20:08] it's what you surrender yourself to
[1:20:11] oh god help me to realize that
[1:20:14] is the son of man going to reveal
[1:20:15] himself through me as a young person
[1:20:18] sister and only god he wants to reveal
[1:20:19] himself through you as a young person
[1:20:21] how is he going to do that
[1:20:23] some of you housewives how is he going
[1:20:24] to reveal himself through you as a
[1:20:26] housewife
[1:20:28] not by what you know
[1:20:30] not by what you can figure out
[1:20:32] but by standing there and surrendering
[1:20:35] to him
[1:20:36] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:20:38] man and he just does it
[1:20:41] we were just there
[1:20:45] are you hearing me today
[1:20:47] we're just there
[1:20:49] he was that he fulfilled that part of a
[1:20:51] son of man ministry but we have a part
[1:20:53] as well what is that part defeat on the
[1:20:55] word until we become the word and he
[1:20:57] tells john go and prophesy again
[1:21:01] it's the son of man ministry the same
[1:21:03] ministry he just we've just fed on the
[1:21:05] body word of the son of man
[1:21:07] it's absolutely the case again you can't
[1:21:09] replace the prophet
[1:21:11] but you can't replace you either
[1:21:13] sister fritz may be watching tonight
[1:21:15] can't replace sister fritz
[1:21:17] i said i was replaceable as a pastor but
[1:21:19] not as an individual
[1:21:22] that ought to give us confidence tonight
[1:21:25] you may be replaceable as a deacon but
[1:21:27] not as an individual
[1:21:29] because god had you he knew you before
[1:21:30] the foundation of the earth
[1:21:32] right and that gives you confidence
[1:21:34] so we're replaceable in our offices
[1:21:38] because there's more than one
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:41] there's more than one person called to
[1:21:42] sit in there and look pretty in church
[1:21:45] more than one person called to to sit
[1:21:47] back and amen the preacher
[1:21:50] for a bunch of them
[1:21:52] well not the amen part but sit there
[1:21:54] anyway
[1:21:56] there's more than one called to do that
[1:22:00] but as an individual you've got a part
[1:22:02] in the body of christ in the revealing
[1:22:04] of the son of man that no one else has
[1:22:07] you're part of the body
[1:22:09] you understand
[1:22:11] there's others that will fill those
[1:22:12] roles if the church continues and some
[1:22:15] of us die off there'll be another
[1:22:16] generation step up there has to be
[1:22:18] because the son of man has to be
[1:22:20] revealed
[1:22:21] it's open now you can't put it back in
[1:22:23] the box
[1:22:24] you can't take the book and shut it back
[1:22:26] up it's already open
[1:22:28] he's already revealing himself people
[1:22:30] say well you shouldn't you shouldn't
[1:22:31] have church that way you shouldn't get
[1:22:33] get excited and worship how can we not
[1:22:35] worship
[1:22:36] when we're in worship time when the book
[1:22:39] has been opened
[1:22:40] when when the seals have been revealed
[1:22:42] when the son of man is revealing himself
[1:22:44] how could we not worship brother said
[1:22:47] everything is worship now
[1:22:49] we didn't get that because some
[1:22:50] pentecostal preacher hyped us up we got
[1:22:52] that because that's what a prophet said
[1:22:54] that was the revealing of the son of man
[1:22:58] he said well it's not that way anymore
[1:23:00] god don't work like that no more he
[1:23:01] don't want us to act like they did on
[1:23:03] pentecost but the son of man
[1:23:05] when he was revealed showed us that they
[1:23:07] staggered like drunk men
[1:23:09] we could you could take that to any
[1:23:10] doctrine of the message
[1:23:12] anything that we believe
[1:23:13] when the son of man was revealed i'm
[1:23:15] going to feed on that
[1:23:16] because the problem the reason why
[1:23:19] people don't show signs of life and
[1:23:20] resurrection because they've been
[1:23:21] feeding on the wrong things
[1:23:24] if you're feeding on the son of man
[1:23:25] you're going to show life
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:28] hallelujah you're a part of it
[1:23:31] and profit in our day look jonah was the
[1:23:33] sign of the resurrection as i bring it
[1:23:34] down to a close jonah was the sign of
[1:23:36] the resurrection like gentile city
[1:23:38] jesus was the sign of the resurrection
[1:23:41] in his day a prophet in our day was a
[1:23:43] sign of the resurrection
[1:23:45] sure he was that's what he showed it in
[1:23:48] his own ministry revealed the secrets of
[1:23:50] the hearts not for a few minutes
[1:23:52] but for year after year decade after
[1:23:54] decade
[1:23:56] right thousands of times and i never
[1:23:58] missed
[1:23:59] showing the sign of the son of man and
[1:24:02] he thought at first even that it was a
[1:24:03] mistake
[1:24:04] watch brother branham as he grows
[1:24:06] through the 40s into the 50s i know you
[1:24:07] listened to tapes and you've heard this
[1:24:09] if you watch brother branham and the
[1:24:10] growth of his ministry in the 40s he
[1:24:13] says i don't he didn't really know which
[1:24:15] direction to go and he was laying hands
[1:24:17] on people the miracle line he knew that
[1:24:18] was a mistake to do it that way to try
[1:24:20] to force a miracle and so he moved on
[1:24:22] and he got in the second poll and he
[1:24:24] realized that well that that might be a
[1:24:25] mistake but look it's exactly where god
[1:24:27] wanted him to be
[1:24:29] just like moses he didn't even realize
[1:24:31] he was revealing the son of man
[1:24:35] maybe tonight you're in a position you
[1:24:37] think
[1:24:37] my life i can't see why i've done the
[1:24:40] things that i've done listen the prophet
[1:24:41] couldn't either
[1:24:43] but then later in his life he could look
[1:24:44] back and say we now have the perfect
[1:24:46] revelation
[1:24:49] are you with me now
[1:24:51] he didn't even know which way god would
[1:24:52] lead him
[1:24:53] neither do we
[1:24:55] jonah had no clue all he knew was he had
[1:24:57] been dead
[1:24:59] and he was alive yes
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] now he was that prophet part of the body
[1:25:05] but we are also part of the body the
[1:25:07] ephesians 5 30 says we are members of
[1:25:09] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[1:25:12] and i'll close with this but the brandon
[1:25:13] said if i can get myself out of the way
[1:25:16] so and william branham's not even
[1:25:18] thought of and you not even thought of
[1:25:21] we liked the first part
[1:25:24] he said if that was brother branham's
[1:25:26] job by the way was to get himself out of
[1:25:27] the way that's not our job to get
[1:25:29] william branham out of the way
[1:25:32] that was brother branham's job
[1:25:35] it's my job but i gave you getting
[1:25:37] myself out of the way
[1:25:40] he said if i could just get william
[1:25:41] branham out of not even thought of and
[1:25:43] you not even thought of till we can see
[1:25:46] jesus glorified among us
[1:25:48] see him that's our desire that gives us
[1:25:50] the quickening power and it gives us joy
[1:25:53] to know that we're already have joy
[1:25:54] tonight it gives us joy to know that we
[1:25:57] are with him both flesh and bone of him
[1:26:00] being the bride of him
[1:26:02] glory and seeing his same vindicated
[1:26:05] methods proving in us
[1:26:08] that he is now risen from the dead
[1:26:12] oh god
[1:26:15] jonah walked out of that trial
[1:26:19] and he was living proof musicians go
[1:26:21] ahead and come i'm over my time jonah
[1:26:23] walked out of that trial not knowing not
[1:26:25] recognizing what he was he was a
[1:26:28] manifestation of the resurrection of
[1:26:30] christ
[1:26:31] amen paul was the same when he said in
[1:26:34] galatians 1 15 he said it pleased god to
[1:26:36] separate me from my mother's womb and
[1:26:38] then he goes on to say and to reveal his
[1:26:40] son in me
[1:26:42] paul was a revealing of the son of man
[1:26:44] or the son of god we could say in that
[1:26:45] day
[1:26:46] he was a revealing of the son of god
[1:26:48] his resurrection from being a pharisee
[1:26:51] to being a preacher of the gospel to
[1:26:53] being a messenger of the age was a
[1:26:55] revealing of christ in his body
[1:26:58] our resurrection
[1:27:00] listen to me you've undergone a
[1:27:01] resurrection
[1:27:03] you were dead in trespasses and sin how
[1:27:05] many say amen to that tonight
[1:27:07] every one of us was
[1:27:09] but we've been washed we've been
[1:27:11] sanctified we've been cleansed by his
[1:27:12] blood but we were dead in trespasses and
[1:27:15] sin we've undergone a resurrection we
[1:27:17] came out of the belly of the fish
[1:27:20] we had seaweed wrapped around our neck
[1:27:22] but what does that make us
[1:27:25] he said well i've been through the trial
[1:27:27] of my life i know some of you have
[1:27:29] i know some of you've been through
[1:27:30] life-changing experiences that belly of
[1:27:32] a well is a life-changing experience
[1:27:36] oh god
[1:27:37] but just because you come through it
[1:27:39] don't mean god can't use you no more it
[1:27:41] may mean that the very reason god
[1:27:42] allowed you to go through it was to show
[1:27:44] a sign of a resurrection there was a
