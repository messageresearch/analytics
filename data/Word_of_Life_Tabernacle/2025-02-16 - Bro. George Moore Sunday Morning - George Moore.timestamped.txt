[56:13] privilege and appreciate brother Ben and
[56:15] and I even appreciate Joel pretty well
[56:18] and so and God bless you this morning
[56:20] while we're all standing we'll go right
[56:22] straight into the word this morning I
[56:23] don't want to take up much time but a
[56:25] little something on my heart and and uh
[56:27] St John the first chapter very familiar
[56:30] I'm sure we've all read it and can
[56:31] recite it without even Opening Our
[56:33] Bibles but uh just something that the
[56:35] Lord put on my heart today bring you
[56:37] greetings from Brother Israel and the
[56:39] Saints at Shalom Tabernacle and Tucson
[56:41] and just got moved in this is the very
[56:44] first service in a new church and so uh
[56:47] quite a testimony of what the Lord did
[56:49] there for us and and so we're happy for
[56:51] those things and God's a provider of all
[56:54] of our needs Saints and so yes St John
[56:57] the first chapter and the first verse
[57:00] we'll begin reading in the beginning was
[57:03] the and the was with God and the Word
[57:08] was God the same was in the beginning
[57:10] with God and all things were made by him
[57:13] and without him was not anything made
[57:16] that was made and in him was
[57:20] life and the life was the light of men
[57:25] and the light shineth in the darkness
[57:29] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[57:32] there was a man sent from God whose name
[57:34] was John the same came for a witness to
[57:36] Bear witness of the light that all men
[57:39] through him might believe he was not
[57:41] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[57:44] of that light so we see here Saints the
[57:46] proper placement of the prophet of the
[57:49] age uh that he was not that light but he
[57:52] was sent to Bear witness of that light
[57:56] and and if we try to make him more or
[57:58] less than that then we're we're putting
[57:59] him in a position God didn't put him in
[58:02] and the ninth verse says that was the
[58:04] True Light which lith every man notice
[58:07] it says it lith every man that cometh
[58:10] into the world he was in the world and
[58:12] the world was made by him and the world
[58:14] knew him not he came to his own and his
[58:16] own received him not but as many as
[58:19] received him to them gave he power to
[58:21] become the sons of God aren't you glad
[58:24] even to them that believe on his name
[58:26] which were born not of blood nor of the
[58:28] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[58:31] but of God can we bow our heads Heavenly
[58:35] Father we're so grateful today to be
[58:37] assembled in this church with the
[58:40] purchase of your blood and we're
[58:43] grateful that Lord Jesus that you called
[58:46] us out of this Darkness into this light
[58:49] and father we just ask that for the next
[58:52] few minutes Lord that you would Minister
[58:54] to the needs of the people Lord we
[58:56] invite you to come and walk up and down
[58:59] the aisles of this church Lord and Lord
[59:01] speak to us and Lord may we go like
[59:05] those from EMAs saying did not our
[59:07] hearts burn within us as he spoke to us
[59:09] along the way and opened to us the
[59:11] scripture Lord I pray that you'd just
[59:13] watch over me mind my lips before I'd
[59:15] speak anything unpleasing to you and
[59:17] we'll commit it into your hands in the
[59:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a
[59:21] church said amen God bless you may be
[59:24] seated and title of the message this
[59:26] morning is enlightened by the shikina
[59:29] glory enlightened by the shikina glory
[59:32] now we find in the scripture here that
[59:36] the the Bible said that in him Jesus
[59:38] Christ was
[59:41] life and that the life was the light of
[59:44] men not not that the light was the life
[59:47] but that the the life was the light and
[59:49] so we find brothers and sisters that
[59:52] it's the life of Jesus Christ the life
[59:56] it's it's it's the walking like Jesus
[59:58] and talking like G it's the life that
[1:00:01] Jesus represents that is the light of
[1:00:04] the world and and we find that that is
[1:00:08] the light that shines out into the
[1:00:10] darkness because if you're a Believer
[1:00:12] and the life of Jesus Christ is living
[1:00:15] in you you cannot hide it Saints it's
[1:00:18] it's something that's a part of you you
[1:00:20] don't have to broadcast it you don't
[1:00:22] have to tell everybody about it they're
[1:00:24] just going to figure it out if the life
[1:00:27] is in you you become the life of Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ and the life is the light and the
[1:00:33] light will shine in the darkness and
[1:00:36] Saints it's also true that the darkness
[1:00:38] don't like the light and so you're going
[1:00:41] to find yourself in situations where
[1:00:43] maybe you got pressures on you that you
[1:00:45] wouldn't have if it wasn't for the life
[1:00:47] that was in you but the life is the
[1:00:50] light can you say Amen this morning and
[1:00:53] that was the True Light it says which
[1:00:55] light every man that comes in the world
[1:00:58] and so it's not just the the good men
[1:01:00] that are lit by the by the Light it's
[1:01:02] the it's every seed is lit by the same
[1:01:06] light and so and whatever seed is in you
[1:01:09] will come to light when the light
[1:01:10] strikes it now is that right this
[1:01:13] morning Saints it's like the sunlight
[1:01:15] the Su n the trees out here and the
[1:01:17] grass out here they get their life by
[1:01:20] soaking up the energy from the Sun and
[1:01:24] every seed does it the weeds do it the
[1:01:26] briers do it the trees do it the grass
[1:01:29] does it it all gets its life from the
[1:01:31] same sun and so is it with that
[1:01:34] predestinated seed that's down in you
[1:01:36] Saints the light comes from the
[1:01:40] Sun and it's going to bring forth of its
[1:01:43] kind so that's why you see well how you
[1:01:45] got so much evil and different things
[1:01:47] some of it's even in the message well
[1:01:50] because it's a seed that's in there and
[1:01:53] this light brings forth the light that's
[1:01:55] in that
[1:01:56] seed now is that right
[1:02:02] Saints
[1:02:03] good because in him was light yes sir in
[1:02:07] him was light and and the Bible goes on
[1:02:10] to say that every man that receives him
[1:02:14] aren't you glad saints that you had the
[1:02:17] ability to receive him every seed that
[1:02:21] receives him to them he gave power to
[1:02:25] become the Son of God Amen now now think
[1:02:28] about this Saints we've talked about
[1:02:29] this before I know but if you are the
[1:02:32] Son of God what is your nature it's the
[1:02:36] nature of God am me if if a if a cow has
[1:02:40] a calf what nature is the calf it's it's
[1:02:44] a cow Saints amen and so if you're a Son
[1:02:47] of God what nature are
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:52] you come on see it's it's the love life
[1:02:56] that's the light not not not hearers of
[1:02:59] the word come on but doers of the word
[1:03:02] is that right it's not just it's just
[1:03:04] not listening to the tape or listening
[1:03:06] to the message or reading the Bible or
[1:03:09] listening to the preaching but it's it's
[1:03:11] doing what the message says do it's it's
[1:03:14] doing what the Bible says do it's doing
[1:03:17] what the ministry says do it's it's it's
[1:03:19] emulating it's living the
[1:03:22] light because the light is the life you
[1:03:25] can't say you got the life if you're not
[1:03:28] living it Saints now I know this is
[1:03:30] simple this morning but but the Bible is
[1:03:33] in book form it's almost completely
[1:03:35] powerless this is just a book but if I
[1:03:38] can open this book and I can receive
[1:03:41] come on somebody if I can receive what
[1:03:43] the book says and live what the book
[1:03:46] says then I become the Bible amen that's
[1:03:50] good you become the Bible we become the
[1:03:53] word as we receive the word
[1:03:56] and that's what we're looking to do
[1:03:57] today Saints I want to be more of the
[1:04:00] word than I was when I walked in here I
[1:04:02] want to walk out of here more of this
[1:04:04] Bible than I was when I came amen when
[1:04:07] you see me next month I want to be more
[1:04:08] of the Bible when you see me next year I
[1:04:10] want to be more of the
[1:04:13] Bible because it's in book form but I
[1:04:17] want it to be in my hearts and the sun
[1:04:20] brings life into the world and the light
[1:04:23] shows imperfection
[1:04:28] the light shows the OV see it's
[1:04:31] sisters come
[1:04:32] on Joel I know you
[1:04:35] paint and anybody ever painted a wall
[1:04:38] and thought it looked
[1:04:40] good until the light hit it see the
[1:04:44] light's what shows the imperfections if
[1:04:47] you do some Sheetrock work and you think
[1:04:49] you got it smooth and it looks good
[1:04:52] until the light hits it it's the light
[1:04:56] that shows the
[1:04:58] imperfections if you if you if your
[1:04:59] sisters clean the window and you think
[1:05:01] the window looks clean everything looks
[1:05:03] good you wash both sides of it
[1:05:06] everything looks good until the light
[1:05:08] hits it and you recognize the spots that
[1:05:12] got missed oh come on somebody today it
[1:05:15] looks good the floor looks good after
[1:05:18] you sweep it after you mop it it looks
[1:05:20] good until the light hits it and you
[1:05:25] realize oh I missed that over there oh I
[1:05:27] missed that over here the light shows
[1:05:30] the dirty places the light shows the
[1:05:36] imperfections even the air you breathe
[1:05:38] you think well this is good clean air
[1:05:39] that I'm breathing right here but if you
[1:05:41] ever watch it when the sun comes in you
[1:05:44] say look at all that junk floating
[1:05:45] around in the air that I'm breathing
[1:05:48] because the light shows the
[1:05:50] imperfections and Saints it's the same
[1:05:53] way with a child of God the more the
[1:05:55] light that you get the more
[1:05:57] imperfections you realize the closer to
[1:06:00] God you get the more you realize you
[1:06:02] need to work on come on Sir true that's
[1:06:07] right good come
[1:06:10] on that's good PR You Can't Hide to
[1:06:13] life the seed will
[1:06:16] produce after its kind yeah that's right
[1:06:20] no matter what you do it will produce
[1:06:21] after its own you can't help it Saints I
[1:06:24] don't care where you was when the light
[1:06:26] shined on you I know where I don't know
[1:06:28] where you was but I know where I was and
[1:06:31] I know what happened when the light
[1:06:32] shined on me I know it didn't matter
[1:06:35] what life I'd live it didn't matter how
[1:06:37] backslid I was it didn't matter my
[1:06:39] upbringing it didn't matter my family it
[1:06:41] didn't matter all the friends that I had
[1:06:43] it didn't matter my hobbies and my
[1:06:45] habits when the light shined on me
[1:06:47] Saints everything
[1:06:50] changed all of it changed I I was a new
[1:06:54] creature it didn't matter where I was at
[1:06:56] nobody in my church nobody went to F
[1:06:59] went to church in my family I'm the only
[1:07:01] one that went to church it didn't matter
[1:07:04] it wouldn't matter if I was on the back
[1:07:06] side of the desert it wouldn't have
[1:07:07] matter if I was in the jungles in Africa
[1:07:09] it wouldn't have matter where I was at
[1:07:11] when the light strikes it brings forth
[1:07:13] life
[1:07:16] Saints it doesn't me you can't hide it
[1:07:19] you can't stop it true that's right the
[1:07:24] seed produces that see there was a bunch
[1:07:26] of Pharisees that looked at Jesus and
[1:07:27] said he's be above he's a devil but a
[1:07:30] prostitute that had too many husbands
[1:07:32] saw him and said you're the Son of
[1:07:37] God because the seed that was in there
[1:07:39] was different it might have looked one
[1:07:42] way in the beginning you might have
[1:07:44] looked one way in the beginning but the
[1:07:46] seed that's in there produces the life
[1:07:48] of the
[1:07:50] seed Pharisees look good but they call
[1:07:54] Jesus a devil but this woman didn't look
[1:07:56] good but she knew he was the son of
[1:07:59] God that's right come on oh come on this
[1:08:02] morning Saints aren't you thankful for
[1:08:05] the seed that's inside of you thank that

[1:10:36] stopped Jesus in his tracks
[1:10:40] right Lord good Hallelujah yes cuz he
[1:10:44] was a seed yes thank you Lord he stuck
[1:10:48] his head up to the glory of God he said
[1:10:51] you can't hide life when a sun strikes
[1:10:54] botney like it's got to live and when
[1:10:57] the Holy Spirit strikes the SC spir
[1:11:00] scriptural life that's in a man he says
[1:11:02] it brings forth its fruit right there oh
[1:11:06] thank you Lord amen now that's not once
[1:11:09] and done on that's every time the Holy
[1:11:12] Spirit strikes the seed every time the
[1:11:15] life strikes the seed Saints it brings
[1:11:17] forth life oh I'm getting better you're
[1:11:21] getting better we're getting better
[1:11:24] Saints but because the holy spirit is
[1:11:27] striking the seed Amen on that's good
[1:11:30] and the closer you get to God the more
[1:11:33] faults you find out you got that's
[1:11:36] right that's true but the Bible said
[1:11:40] that when you receive the light you then
[1:11:43] become the light so then it's no longer
[1:11:46] Jesus no longer the word it's the light
[1:11:48] living in you are the light the bride is
[1:11:51] the final voice to the final age you
[1:11:53] become the light
[1:11:56] y want to read that Matthew 5:14 says ye
[1:12:00] that's you when it says ye that's you ye
[1:12:05] are the light of the
[1:12:06] world right yes
[1:12:09] sir see I know what God did 2,000 years
[1:12:13] ago right I know what he did in
[1:12:16] 1950 I know what he did in
[1:12:18] 1960 but ye are the light of the world
[1:12:21] that's right now that's right amen but
[1:12:25] because the light that lives in Jesus is
[1:12:28] living in you come
[1:12:31] on good City that's set on a hill cannot
[1:12:34] be hid neither do men light a candle put
[1:12:37] it under a bush but on a Candlestick to
[1:12:39] give light to all that's in the house
[1:12:42] let your light so shine before men that
[1:12:46] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:12:50] your father now see this is very
[1:12:53] important Saints because if you have
[1:12:55] good works it ain't
[1:13:02] you you didn't want to do
[1:13:04] it come on it wasn't your
[1:13:07] nature if there's anything good about
[1:13:09] you it ain't you so it ain't to glorify
[1:13:13] you if you got a gift to preach it ain't
[1:13:15] you if you can sing it ain't you if you
[1:13:18] can play an instrument it ain't you if
[1:13:20] you can help somebody it ain't you if
[1:13:23] there's Love in Your Heart It Ain't you
[1:13:25] it didn't come from you it came from
[1:13:28] him and it was given for you to glorify
[1:13:31] him with so if you can preach you
[1:13:34] glorify him with it if you can sing you
[1:13:36] glorify him with it see too many times
[1:13:39] people take the gifts of God and use it
[1:13:41] to glorify
[1:13:43] themselves come on but it was given to
[1:13:47] glorify him
[1:13:49] with so if we approach everything from
[1:13:51] the standpoint of how can I use the gift
[1:13:55] that God's G me to glorify
[1:14:00] him
[1:14:04] come good preach because the closer you
[1:14:07] get to God the more mistakes you realize
[1:14:10] you make that's right the more problems
[1:14:12] you realize you got the more faults you
[1:14:15] realize you have because the
[1:14:18] light shines on those Dark
[1:14:22] Places come on come on the more light of
[1:14:26] the word that shines in your
[1:14:28] life the
[1:14:30] dirtier things look to you but we don't
[1:14:34] complain about the dirt we thank God for
[1:14:37] the
[1:14:38] light yeah that's good amen if the if
[1:14:42] the kitchen floor is dirty don't
[1:14:44] complain about the dirt thank God you
[1:14:47] can see the dirt so you can take
[1:14:50] action
[1:14:52] amen otherwise you just have a dirty
[1:14:54] floor
[1:14:55] everybody else can see it but you can't
[1:14:57] see it thank God you can see it thank
[1:15:00] God he's revealing it to you and showing
[1:15:02] you what you need to work on because
[1:15:04] it's an opportunity to get it
[1:15:07] right I'm grateful for it Saints I'm
[1:15:10] glad that that he showing me because I
[1:15:12] don't want to be wrong I want to be
[1:15:16] right thank you
[1:15:18] Lord good
[1:15:20] buddy come on see we don't let the devil
[1:15:25] beat us up about God's program come on
[1:15:29] see the devil wants to get in there and
[1:15:31] Whisper see all this stuff that's wrong
[1:15:32] in your life see all the things you need
[1:15:35] to do see all the stuff you need to work
[1:15:37] on and you say yes I can see it why can
[1:15:40] you see it because God's showing you
[1:15:42] Glory Glory Hallelujah well the devil
[1:15:45] say well you're not a good enough
[1:15:46] Christian you're not good enough no
[1:15:47] that's a sign you are that's right
[1:15:50] because everybody can't repent Cain
[1:15:54] couldn't repent
[1:15:56] but you can you have the opportunity
[1:16:00] it's God working in you that's
[1:16:03] right that's good good that's real good
[1:16:06] knoweth it not he says the higher you
[1:16:08] rise in God the more sinful the whole
[1:16:11] thing looks right and then sometimes he
[1:16:14] says in prayer you can imagine when the
[1:16:16] Holy Spirit takes you into a spear then
[1:16:18] the whole thing looks chaos he said but
[1:16:21] if you ever climb into them Spears one
[1:16:23] time he says where you can be in the
[1:16:24] Pres of God not through emotion but
[1:16:27] through genuine Holy Spirit lifting up
[1:16:29] the whole thing is wrote hiab the glory
[1:16:31] of the Lord has departed from the whole
[1:16:33] denominational
[1:16:35] outfits he said there's none of them
[1:16:37] right now look here
[1:16:38] Saints we don't condemn The Sinner we
[1:16:42] condemn the sin we don't ever get so
[1:16:45] high and mighty that we can't talk to a
[1:16:48] sinner we don't ever get so religious or
[1:16:51] so messy that we don't want to see a
[1:16:53] sinner fall down at this Altar and be
[1:16:55] born again into the kingdom of God if he
[1:16:58] saved you he can save anybody that's
[1:17:01] right that's right we know we can't lose
[1:17:03] our heart for the people we can't lose
[1:17:05] our feeling for the people we can't lose
[1:17:07] our desire to see one more Soul come to
[1:17:10] the grace of God to see the blood change
[1:17:13] one more
[1:17:16] life yes sir good don't ever lose that
[1:17:19] we don't condemn The Sinner but we can't
[1:17:23] stand the sin
[1:17:25] but it's the light that's in you that's
[1:17:27] calling it out that's
[1:17:29] right amen come
[1:17:33] on good good preach
[1:17:36] conviction
[1:17:38] condemnation
[1:17:40] repentance it's all a tool in the hand
[1:17:43] of God the
[1:17:45] entire Christian walk is built on
[1:17:49] repentance that's right that's
[1:17:53] right on in Acts two everybody quotes 38
[1:17:57] but before that there was
[1:17:59] 37 that's right that's deep teaching
[1:18:02] ain't it Brother
[1:18:04] David y'all can get out of here say
[1:18:06] brother George said 37 come before
[1:18:11] 38 but Peter was preaching to them on
[1:18:15] that Jesus the Christ had come that the
[1:18:18] Son of God had
[1:18:20] come and that they had crucified him
[1:18:23] they had killed the son of
[1:18:25] God and the Bible said it's very
[1:18:27] important they were pricked in their
[1:18:29] hearts yes thank you Lord for amen thank
[1:18:33] thank you they were pricked in their
[1:18:36] hearts Saints that's a critical step to
[1:18:40] be pricked in your hearts to to be
[1:18:43] condemned to be to be convicted about
[1:18:46] something it's critical the another
[1:18:49] translation says they were cut to the
[1:18:52] heart that's right it cut
[1:18:56] God came his son came and we killed him
[1:18:58] and cut him to the hearts and then they
[1:19:01] cried out what must we do to be
[1:19:05] saved without that step Saints you're
[1:19:08] going down a wet Center a dry Center and
[1:19:10] coming up a
[1:19:14] w come on it's a dry High confession
[1:19:19] come
[1:19:21] on that's true Hebrews chapter 7 number
[1:19:24] two to he says the
[1:19:26] believer can't
[1:19:28] sin I'm going read it again I'm going
[1:19:32] read it again the believer can't
[1:19:35] sin certainly not the seed of God the
[1:19:39] blessings of God remains on
[1:19:42] him gy to God oh somebody ought to shout
[1:19:46] hallelujah to know that the blessings of
[1:19:50] God remains on
[1:19:53] you yes sir when you feel like it when
[1:19:56] you're doing good when you're doing
[1:20:01] bad the blessings of God remains on
[1:20:06] you so you say well why do we got to
[1:20:08] repent then brother George well he says
[1:20:09] cuz God can't see nothing but the blood
[1:20:13] of his own
[1:20:15] son you can't sin cuz he can't see it
[1:20:20] because there's an atonement laying
[1:20:21] there
[1:20:22] that's that's oh not C you're fantastic
[1:20:26] but because you got an atonement laying
[1:20:28] there and when he looks through he don't
[1:20:30] see it he sees the
[1:20:34] atonement you're perfect today because
[1:20:37] you got a blood sacrifice because you're
[1:20:40] you're your sacrifice was perfect he
[1:20:43] said in one place he says he he you pray
[1:20:46] he don't he don't see you he hears your
[1:20:49] voice but he sees the blood of Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ he said it's your voice and
[1:20:54] Christ
[1:20:56] blood on Sir the blood sacrifice is what
[1:20:59] makes you perfect the atonement is what
[1:21:02] makes you perfect the the blood
[1:21:04] sacrifice is what makes you sinless come
[1:21:07] on cuz he says this he says God can't
[1:21:10] see nothing but his own
[1:21:12] blood no matter what is in his church
[1:21:15] what it is God don't see it because
[1:21:17] Jesus is making intercessions constantly
[1:21:21] the high
[1:21:22] priest oh see in order for the to be
[1:21:24] sinless he's got to come under the
[1:21:27] blood now you might see my faults I
[1:21:30] might see your faults but Jesus is
[1:21:34] making an atonement so when God looks he
[1:21:36] can't see
[1:21:40] it that's a that's amazing
[1:21:46] Saints he says there's no way for him to
[1:21:49] sin when such a sacrifice is laying
[1:21:52] there for him see I don't count the
[1:21:55] blood of the Covenant an unclean thing
[1:21:57] I'm grateful that there's a sacrifice
[1:21:59] laying there for
[1:22:01] me he said now if you say well that
[1:22:03] gives me a good chance he said that
[1:22:04] shows you're not right to begin with you
[1:22:06] don't want to take advantage of that you
[1:22:09] hadn't got it to begin with if you want
[1:22:10] try to take advantage of it say I can
[1:22:12] live any way I want to I can do whatever
[1:22:13] I want to yes you can but the Nature's
[1:22:16] changed and what you want to do has
[1:22:22] changed not to take advantage all I want
[1:22:24] to live no but it's to say that if you
[1:22:27] make a mistake if you have a bad thought
[1:22:30] if you say something you shouldn't say
[1:22:32] if you say something you didn't want to
[1:22:33] do if have something going on in your
[1:22:35] life you have a
[1:22:37] sacrifice thank you Lord right thank you
[1:22:41] Lord he says this now you will do
[1:22:45] wrong right sir but you won't do it
[1:22:50] willfully on he says you're trapped and
[1:22:54] anything you're trapped into or do
[1:22:57] something you don't mean to do it's not
[1:22:58] sin
[1:22:59] yet you'll repent the minute you see
[1:23:04] that you're
[1:23:06] wrong oh so it ain't sin yet because
[1:23:09] when I recognize it I have the ability
[1:23:12] to repent of
[1:23:14] it see the devil has a way of putting
[1:23:17] thoughts in your mind and blaming you
[1:23:20] for having
[1:23:21] them yeah that's right good that's not
[1:23:26] you you're trapped into that and when
[1:23:29] you have that thought immediately you
[1:23:33] repent Lord forgive me come
[1:23:37] on that's good that's real good good yes
[1:23:41] sir on now he said
[1:23:45] now he said you'll turn quickly and say
[1:23:48] I didn't I didn't mean to do that that's
[1:23:51] right true he says you'll do that all
[1:23:53] through life
[1:23:56] so I've been in the message five years
[1:23:58] I'm going to do this 10 years I'm going
[1:24:00] to do it 20 years I'm going to do it 50
[1:24:04] years I'm still going to be doing it GL
[1:24:08] God all through
[1:24:10] life that's right but it's God's
[1:24:13] provided way that's
[1:24:16] right it's God's he said there's a blood
[1:24:19] atonement for us all the time to keep us
[1:24:21] covered he said now the legalist would
[1:24:23] say if somebody makes a mistake they'd
[1:24:25] say well I know bless God she
[1:24:28] backslid I know she backslid H bless God
[1:24:31] she done wrong I know she's backslid he
[1:24:34] said that's wrong that's right she's not
[1:24:37] backslid she made a
[1:24:39] mistake he said if she did it willfully
[1:24:41] she wasn't right to begin with but she
[1:24:44] made a mistake and and he says he said
[1:24:46] if she didn't mean to do it she walks
[1:24:49] before the Holy Church of God and
[1:24:51] confesses it and says I'm wrong and you
[1:24:53] forgive me he said your duty bound to do
[1:24:56] it he said if you don't do it in your
[1:24:59] hearts you ought to be at the altar
[1:25:02] yourself sir on
[1:25:06] right he said there's the real Holiness
[1:25:09] in the church there's the genuine
[1:25:11] Holiness not of you but of
[1:25:14] Christ he said I have no Holiness to
[1:25:17] present to him but I'm trusting in his
[1:25:19] grace thank you Lord oh
[1:25:22] God he said it's I've unmar it he said I
[1:25:26] make oh my come on he says I make
[1:25:32] thousands of mistakes each
[1:25:34] month each year surely I do but when I
[1:25:39] see that I'm wrong oh yeah I say God I
[1:25:42] didn't mean to do it you know my hearts
[1:25:45] I didn't mean to do that I was trapped
[1:25:47] into that I didn't mean to do it you
[1:25:48] forgive me Lord he said if I done wrong
[1:25:51] to my brother I say brother forgive me I
[1:25:53] didn't mean to do that he said there's
[1:25:56] the blood sacrifice there's the power of
[1:25:58] the Gospel that the holy church is
[1:26:00] moving on not because of something you
[1:26:02] done is something you had nothing to do
[1:26:04] with the atonement that's right so this
[1:26:07] life of daily repentance is is it's it's
[1:26:10] got to continue on Saints you can't

[1:27:22] up about that yeah it's the process that
[1:27:25] God's using that's right yeah it's good
[1:27:29] right repentance is a work of the holy
[1:27:33] ghost in a Believer that's right that's
[1:27:36] good
[1:27:38] right
[1:27:39] conviction is a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:43] aren you thank God you got it if it
[1:27:46] wasn't there you'd keep on going like

[1:27:55] to make it

[1:29:06] yes but I'll tell you
[1:29:09] this inside of him are
[1:29:12] attributes to be a Healer Amen to be a
[1:29:17] deliverer to be a
[1:29:19] savior to be a
[1:29:21] lord to be a god
[1:29:26] and the
[1:29:27] angels can't worship him that
[1:29:32] way
[1:29:33] only you can worship him oh the way he
[1:29:38] desires to be worshiped oh yeah only you
[1:29:41] an angel can't worship him as Savior
[1:29:43] because he never was lost but you can
[1:29:45] worship him as a savior because you were
[1:29:48] lost an angel can't worship him as a
[1:29:51] Healer because the angel ain't never
[1:29:52] been sick but you you can worship him as
[1:29:55] a Healer today an angel don't know what
[1:29:58] it's like to be hungry don't know what

[1:30:45] you're too done you're too far gone as
[1:30:47] long as there is a desire in your heart
[1:30:50] for more of Jesus Christ there's more of
[1:30:52] Jesus Christ to resp respond to that
[1:30:56] desire sir yeah you're blessed just to
[1:30:59] have the hunger and the thirst for
[1:31:02] righteousness that shows you there
[1:31:04] something in you pulling you drying you
[1:31:07] higher right thank you Lord very good
[1:31:11] yes
[1:31:13] sir true you're going to gone too far he
[1:31:15] said what about Abraham who lied about
[1:31:18] his wife he said he was backslid cuz any
[1:31:21] Jew that wasn't in Palestine was
[1:31:22] backslid and he said amch was a good man
[1:31:27] but God still came to him and said if
[1:31:29] you don't have my Prophet pray for
[1:31:30] you're as good as a dead
[1:31:32] man that's the seed of God remaining on
[1:31:35] you that's the Seed of
[1:31:38] Abraham Amen
[1:31:41] on see the
[1:31:43] message can't be done to you it's got to
[1:31:47] live through
[1:31:49] you you can't take a kid and do the
[1:31:52] message to them or a loved one that
[1:31:55] don't know the Lord and do the message
[1:31:57] to him that's a book of rules don't do
[1:32:00] this and don't do that and don't do this
[1:32:02] and don't that's trying to do the
[1:32:03] message to them it's got to live through
[1:32:06] them if you can get the message inside
[1:32:08] of them then they'll do the things the
[1:32:10] message says
[1:32:13] do on
[1:32:16] now come on
[1:32:22] see I I'm getting off subject
[1:32:25] here but you know the ma you know the
[1:32:28] word faith is in the Bible 247
[1:32:33] times so that's for those of you asking
[1:32:36] that's Faith 24/7 that's what it's going
[1:32:38] to take Faith 247 it's in the message
[1:32:41] it's in the Bible 247 times it's only
[1:32:45] mentioned twice though in the Old
[1:32:48] Testament that's right and mentioned
[1:32:51] 245 times in the New Testament
[1:32:54] because our faith the difference between
[1:32:56] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[1:32:58] was the atonement the blood
[1:33:01] sacrifice and the faith of us today has
[1:33:04] got to be in the atonement in the blood
[1:33:08] not in the man not in the pastor not in
[1:33:10] the church not in the bishop not in the
[1:33:13] general overseer but it's got to be in
[1:33:15] the
[1:33:16] blood it can't even be in the prophet
[1:33:19] it's got to be in the
[1:33:22] blood come on yeah right yeah and and
[1:33:26] and you think about faith Saints it's
[1:33:28] like the how many of you got how many of
[1:33:30] you got a favorite food somewhere
[1:33:33] favorite food brother Harvey what's your
[1:33:35] favorite
[1:33:37] food he likes it
[1:33:40] all he ain't no help at
[1:33:42] all sa his I ain't saying be of
[1:33:47] sausages how many of you like fried
[1:33:50] chicken oh God it's right let lunch time
[1:33:54] I'm preaching on fried
[1:33:56] chicken that's
[1:33:59] right in in order the Bible said that
[1:34:02] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:34:06] for and the evidence the evidence of
[1:34:10] Things Not
[1:34:11] Seen now in
[1:34:14] order for you I I if right now when I
[1:34:18] said that you said it's almost 12:00 and
[1:34:20] I leave at 12 brother George can preach
[1:34:22] as long as he wants to but 12 I'm
[1:34:25] leaving because I'm going to go get me
[1:34:27] some fried chicken because there's a
[1:34:29] desire in me for some fried chicken the
[1:34:32] desire that's in you for fried chicken
[1:34:36] is the evidence that Fried Chicken
[1:34:39] exists oh come on y'all going to get
[1:34:41] that in a minute you can't have a desire
[1:34:45] for something that don't
[1:34:47] exist the only way you can desire Fried
[1:34:50] Chicken brother Ben is if there's a
[1:34:52] piece of fried chicken
[1:34:55] somewhere it's the the desire that's in
[1:34:57] you is the evidence that it's there and
[1:35:01] you can't desire more of God in your
[1:35:04] life unless there's a God somewhere to
[1:35:07] respond to that
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:12] desire thank you Lord It's the evidence
[1:35:14] how do you know God's in it how do you
[1:35:16] know God's real cuz I feel him how do
[1:35:18] you know he's real cuz I want more of
[1:35:21] him cuz he's pulling on man oh I'm way
[1:35:25] off I'm way let me let me say it like
[1:35:29] this I'm just going to skip ahead here
[1:35:31] so we can close inside of Jesus now
[1:35:36] remember the first creation of
[1:35:38] God in the beginning was the word yeah
[1:35:42] and the first tangible creation of God
[1:35:45] was at
[1:35:46] logos the beginning of the creation go
[1:35:48] not not the beginning of God's creation
[1:35:51] but the beginning of God creating
[1:35:53] himself the beginning of God unfolding
[1:35:57] himself because in God were attributes
[1:36:00] and he had a desire to have fellowship
[1:36:03] with you and
[1:36:04] I come on he had a desire to he had a
[1:36:08] desire to be a Healer a desire to be a
[1:36:10] savior a desire to be a Lord but he was
[1:36:12] all by himself he was just God when did
[1:36:14] he start he never started how long's he
[1:36:16] been around he's always been where did
[1:36:18] it come from it didn't come from nowhere
[1:36:20] on that's right but the first part of
[1:36:24] God creating himself unfolding himself
[1:36:27] was the
[1:36:28] logos now if you want to see what that
[1:36:30] looks like we got a picture of it
[1:36:32] somewhere where it it it's the pillar of
[1:36:35] fire now is that right Saints the same
[1:36:38] one The Arc of the same one that led the
[1:36:41] children of Israel the same one that
[1:36:42] appeared over William brandham the same
[1:36:44] it was the logos in the beginning the
[1:36:46] first tangible creation of
[1:36:51] God on
[1:36:53] and inside of him were at but except
[1:36:56] from there outside of that come he just
[1:36:58] like a little white
[1:36:59] cloud and that was you that was
[1:37:03] man see you were your Beginnings are
[1:37:06] that logos you were in God in the
[1:37:09] beginning he said if you ever had
[1:37:11] eternal life you always had it now is
[1:37:13] that
[1:37:14] right and
[1:37:16] inside of inside of God were these
[1:37:20] attributes come on and and he he
[1:37:24] displayed them in the seven compound
[1:37:26] Redemptive names is that right yeah so
[1:37:28] so he was Jehovah Gyra the Lord will
[1:37:31] provide he he was Jehovah RFI the Lord
[1:37:34] who heals he was Jehovah Nasi the Lord
[1:37:36] is my banner he was Jehovah Shalom the
[1:37:38] Lord is my peace he was Jehovah Rah the
[1:37:41] Lord is my shepherd He he was Jehovah
[1:37:43] tadu the Lord is our righteousness he
[1:37:46] was Jehovah sha the Lord is there see it
[1:37:49] was actually it was God displaying his
[1:37:52] personality his attributes to his people
[1:37:55] come on he had a desire so when you go
[1:37:58] to God and you ask God for things you
[1:38:01] have to know that you're asking him for
[1:38:03] things that he already wants to give
[1:38:05] you right if you ask God for your
[1:38:08] healing it's in his nature to want to
[1:38:09] heal you if you ask God to provide for
[1:38:12] you it's his nature to provide for you
[1:38:15] if you ask God to help you through a
[1:38:16] tough time it's his nature to be your
[1:38:18] Shield it's his nature to give you peace
[1:38:21] it's his nature to heal your body it's
[1:38:23] his to provide for you you're not asking
[1:38:26] God for something he don't want to do
[1:38:28] you're asking God for something that's
[1:38:30] his nature to do
[1:38:31] it thank you Lord that he's went to all
[1:38:34] links to do for
[1:38:37] you
[1:38:39] good but I want you to
[1:38:41] recognize that those seven compound
[1:38:43] Redemptive
[1:38:45] names they didn't they weren't given to
[1:38:47] us by
[1:38:49] God yeah come on they were given to us
[1:38:53] by
[1:38:54] man see the Bible said
[1:38:57] he brother Brown said he took stoop
[1:38:59] degraded
[1:39:00] men and he lifted them up to a place to
[1:39:03] become sons of God see it wasn't God it
[1:39:08] was
[1:39:09] Abraham after that Ram appeared that
[1:39:12] cried out Jehovah
[1:39:16] Gyra yeah that's right Abraham did that
[1:39:19] yeah God didn't do that God provided and
[1:39:23] in Abraham said Jehovah gar oh yeah now
[1:39:27] how did Abraham recognize that attribute
[1:39:29] of God because he was a part of God he
[1:39:32] was made out of the same stuff that
[1:39:34] God's made out of his nature was the
[1:39:36] same nature that God had and when he
[1:39:39] seen God he recognized that
[1:39:42] attribute it was Moses when he saw the
[1:39:45] victory that the lord gave him over the
[1:39:47] amalekites they rose up and built an
[1:39:49] altar and cried Jehovah D say the Lord
[1:39:52] is my banner
[1:39:55] now God didn't say that Moses said that
[1:39:59] well how did he recognize it because he
[1:40:01] recognize the God that was inside of
[1:40:04] him thank you
[1:40:06] Lord that's what we got to recognize
[1:40:10] that we are a part of God it was Gideon
[1:40:13] that was all upset because he was going
[1:40:15] to have to go Smite the midianites and
[1:40:17] the Lord told him I'm with you go ahead
[1:40:19] and do it and he he said you'll save all
[1:40:21] Israel he built an altar and he cried
[1:40:24] out than Jehovah
[1:40:27] Shalom the lord gave me
[1:40:30] peace it was David after all he'd been
[1:40:35] through after all his
[1:40:38] battles that cried out Jehovah Rah the
[1:40:41] Lord is my shepherd how did these mortal
[1:40:45] men recognize the attributes of God
[1:40:49] because they were a part of God how do
[1:40:51] you recognize God in this message how do
[1:40:55] you recognize God in this Bible how do
[1:40:58] you recognize God when you hear because
[1:41:00] you're a part of
[1:41:04] god good sir come on now yes sir he said
[1:41:09] the only real
[1:41:11] difference between
[1:41:13] us and the Son of God was that we just
[1:41:17] bypass our
[1:41:18] theophany come
[1:41:20] on come on he said he was from the very
[1:41:25] beginning the word yeah that's right he
[1:41:28] said that's how he could know all things
[1:41:30] he said but you bypass that and come
[1:41:32] here to be tempted come on now is that
[1:41:35] right and he said this body is not the
[1:41:37] word formed body but it's subject to the
[1:41:39] word this body is subject to the word
[1:41:43] and he says the difference between him
[1:41:44] and you as a son is he was at the
[1:41:47] beginning the word an a morphal body
[1:41:49] right come on and he said he appeared in
[1:41:51] the form of MDC and in then we didn't
[1:41:53] hear nothing about him no more because
[1:41:55] he came in Jesus
[1:41:57] Christ he said you bypass that because
[1:42:00] in that form he knowed all things and
[1:42:03] you have never been able to know that
[1:42:05] yet right yet but there's coming a Time
[1:42:10] Saints there's coming an hour where you
[1:42:13] will he says you come like Adam like me
[1:42:16] you became from an attribute to the
[1:42:18] flesh to be tempted but when this life
[1:42:20] is finished here if this Earthly tab
[1:42:23] will be dissolved we have one already
[1:42:25] waiting there's an amorpha body already
[1:42:28] waiting on you Saints it's already there
[1:42:31] it's waiting on you and you may not
[1:42:33] understand that we don't understand
[1:42:35] these things but we know there's
[1:42:37] something more than what we're at right
[1:42:39] now we know there's something more that
[1:42:41] we're headed into we understand saints
[1:42:44] that there's a body calling to us and
[1:42:47] oh but I know it's there I can feel it I
[1:42:51] get a charge from it glory to God thank
[1:42:55] you
[1:42:56] Lord we're going back to what we was
[1:42:59] before the beginning oh
[1:43:02] yeah aren't you glad
[1:43:04] today it's waiting for us and we get a
[1:43:08] glimpse of it from time to time amen
[1:43:11] when you're in the presence of God when
[1:43:14] you're rejoicing in the things of God
[1:43:15] you can feel it calling to you right
[1:43:19] thank he said after you recognize the
[1:43:22] very word of God is Eagle food then you
[1:43:25] left off the other thing and you've been
[1:43:27] formed in the image of the Living God
[1:43:30] and you've heard from your theophany he
[1:43:32] said if this Earthly body be dissolved
[1:43:35] we have one waiting right Saints I can't
[1:43:38] understand all that but I do know this
[1:43:41] he said the greatest as musicians
[1:43:44] come he said the
[1:43:46] greatest of all
[1:43:48] Revelation was the Supreme deity of the
[1:43:51] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:53] he says you you can't get to first base
[1:43:55] without it brother Ben on the Supreme de
[1:43:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ now I used to
[1:44:01] think for years that that meant Jesus
[1:44:03] was
[1:44:05] God well sure Jesus was
[1:44:08] God absolutely Jesus was God but that's
[1:44:12] not the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:15] Christ see Supreme deity is it it's all
[1:44:19] Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ in the
[1:44:23] prophets in the bible it was Jesus
[1:44:26] Christ in Isaiah Jesus Christ in Paul
[1:44:29] Jesus Christ in William brandom Jesus
[1:44:32] Christ came in his own body flesh and
[1:44:35] dwelt among us but it's Jesus Christ in
[1:44:39] you it's Jesus in your brother it's
[1:44:43] Jesus in your sister it's Jesus in the
[1:44:47] pastor it's Jesus in the Evangelist it's
[1:44:50] Jesus in the teacher it's Jesus in the
[1:44:53] ly it's Jesus functioning in the body
[1:44:56] you are the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:44:58] Christ he's the one that controls all of
[1:45:01] this he's the one that's pushing and but
[1:45:03] the butt he's the one Saints that's
[1:45:05] orchestrating it all and if there's
[1:45:08] anything good about us it's him it's the
[1:45:10] deity of Christ oh thank you Lord
[1:45:13] working through the body of Jesus Christ
[1:45:15] he said the greatest the hardest thing
[1:45:17] on God was to get one mortal to believe
[1:45:21] another yes but God works through
[1:45:26] man God uses man come on God uses women
[1:45:31] God uses young people God uses old
[1:45:34] people God works through his body his
[1:45:37] Supreme
[1:45:38] deity working in you
[1:45:41] all aren't you glad for that today and
[1:45:45] Saints sees has a way that he brings us
[1:45:48] back into into the blood it's it's
[1:45:50] repentance it's it's it's it's it's it's
[1:45:53] condemnation it's conviction those are
[1:45:56] things that God is
[1:45:57] using to bring us back into the
[1:46:00] Perfection of the blood so don't let the
[1:46:02] devil use that against us recognize
