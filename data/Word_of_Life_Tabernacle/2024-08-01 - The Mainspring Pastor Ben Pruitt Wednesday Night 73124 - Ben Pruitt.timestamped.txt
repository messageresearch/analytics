[35:07] we thank you for coming and taking
[35:09] lordship in our lives we give you room
[35:12] to operate Lord how you would want to do
[35:15] Lord in this service or in our lives as
[35:17] a whole I pray that you would just

[35:34] Lord I know that you're a an ontime God
[35:37] so I pray that there would be something
[35:38] timely that would be said Lord that
[35:40] would help your people Lord move me out
[35:42] of the way and speak directly to some
[35:45] need we pray in Jesus name
[35:49] amen
[35:50] amen Ezekiel chapter 36 and verse 26
[35:55] I I want to
[35:58] uh take a little bit of a a different
[36:00] thought I haven't preached on this in a
[36:03] while I guess Ezekiel
[36:06] 3626 but it just come to my heart this
[36:08] week and Trust it'll be a blessing to
[36:11] you brother Brandon preached a series of
[36:14] uh of sermons in the late 50s he titled
[36:18] them uh what does it take to make a
[36:21] Christian Life or the impersonation of
[36:25] Christianity also why is it so many
[36:28] Christians find it so hard to live the
[36:30] Christian Life and then he finally he
[36:33] titled one why some people can't keep
[36:35] the Victory and all of those sermons
[36:38] were uh off of Ezekiel 36:26 and
[36:42] 27 so Ezekiel
[36:46] 36
[36:47] 26 says a new
[36:51] heart also will I give you and a new
[36:54] spirit will I put within you and I will
[36:57] take away the Stony heart out of your
[36:59] flesh I will give you a heart of Flesh
[37:04] and I will put my spirit within you and
[37:06] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[37:09] shall keep my judgments and do them amen
[37:13] I pray Lord would add his Blessing to
[37:14] the word you may be seated thank you for
[37:16] being here on a Wednesday
[37:19] night brother brandom when he preaches
[37:22] these sermons he he begins by let
[37:25] letting us know that God intended his
[37:28] church to be governed by the Holy Ghost
[37:31] he said God did not intend for the
[37:34] church to be governed by intellectual or
[37:37] by any Theology of man but the Holy
[37:40] Spirit was given to the church to govern
[37:43] and control the body of Christ and so he
[37:46] never intended his church to be a
[37:48] self-help program we're not we're not uh
[37:52] uh the AA or some kind of uh uh place
[37:55] that those things are good but that's
[37:57] not what we are what we are is a body
[38:00] governed by the Holy Spirit God uses men
[38:05] to govern he does do that but those men
[38:08] are to be led by the spirit in fact in
[38:11] Romans 8:14 Paul says for as many as are
[38:14] led by the spirit of God they are the
[38:17] sons of God so I trust that's all of us
[38:19] tonight that we are led by the spirit of
[38:22] God and you say well I don't feel like I
[38:25] I'm LED I don't feel like that God is
[38:27] working in my life but you're here
[38:29] tonight I believe you were led to this
[38:31] church by the spirit of God because you
[38:34] are the sons and daughters of God and so
[38:37] brother brandham tells us that he he's
[38:39] not placed his church in the hands of
[38:41] just an elected leadership that moves
[38:44] with political mindedness but he's
[38:46] placed his church in the care of God
[38:49] ordained spirit filled word living men
[38:52] who lead the people through feeding them
[38:55] the word and and so that's the way that
[38:57] we can lead now but it's not just the
[39:00] leadership but the people as well brand
[39:02] said God's Eternal Plan of Salvation for
[39:05] his people is the holy spirit in the
[39:08] church he said Born Again men and women
[39:11] operated by the Holy Spirit not them
[39:14] trying to operate the Holy Spirit but
[39:16] the Holy Spirit operating them so our
[39:20] job is to get out of the way and let the
[39:22] Holy Spirit operate within us in the way
[39:26] that he wants to do yes
[39:28] sir so the spirit reveals the word of
[39:32] the hour how many believe that he said
[39:34] he would lead us and guide us into all
[39:36] truth if you need to know something in
[39:39] your life then the spirit has to reveal
[39:41] that to you and and if I tell you
[39:44] that'll you can just take my word for it
[39:46] but if I speak it and then the Holy
[39:48] Spirit reveals it and then it becomes a
[39:50] revelation to you and when we receive
[39:53] Revelation we're stimulated by that
[39:55] revelation we we have the wine of
[39:58] stimulation in our lives and and brother
[40:01] brandom again he would take this to Mark
[40:03] 2:22 or he also says this in Matthew and
[40:06] in Luke as well Jesus said no man
[40:09] putteth new wine into Old bottles or the
[40:12] new wine will burst the bottles and the
[40:13] wine is spilled and the bottles will be
[40:16] marred but new wine must be put into new
[40:19] bottles so this Holy Ghost leadership
[40:21] has got to be put into something that is
[40:25] flexible right that is flexible enough
[40:29] to move when the stimulation of
[40:31] Revelation comes in
[40:34] right so the new wine is flexible new
[40:38] wine bottles are made of of cide or they
[40:40] were in that age and you can kind of see
[40:43] what they were they were actually not
[40:45] bottles like glass bottles what we would
[40:47] think of but they were made out of skin
[40:49] and so if they were new that means they
[40:52] meant they would move and when you got
[40:54] new wine it's still fermenting it's
[40:57] still expanding and so you got to have
[40:59] new skins to put the new wine in or
[41:02] it'll ruin both the wine and the skin so
[41:05] the new wine bottles are flexible and
[41:07] the new wine has life in it brother
[41:09] brand said the new bottles has still the
[41:11] animal oil in the skins and it's
[41:14] flexible so there's got to be oil in the
[41:17] skins and and they've got to be flexible
[41:19] that's the way God's Church must be for
[41:22] Revival flexible I'm glad I got somebody
[41:24] Amen in me tonight
[41:27] so the new bottle reacts positively to
[41:29] the word that's actually what I'm
[41:31] talking about now brother Jonah is is
[41:34] the new bottle will actually amen the
[41:36] word listen to this next quote brother
[41:38] BR said every time the word of God is
[41:40] preached in its power the new skin will
[41:43] holler
[41:45] amen it'll give away why because it's
[41:48] it's a new skin it it's not held in by
[41:51] Dogma it's not held in by Creed it'll
[41:54] respond to the word it's got to because
[41:56] it's a new new skin and the new wine the
[41:58] stimulation of Revelation makes it
[42:00] holler
[42:01] amen oh I want to be able to positively
[42:04] respond to the word said brother Ben I'm
[42:07] not able to well maybe it's because that
[42:10] that you got some old skin working there
[42:11] it needs to be oiled by the Holy Spirit
[42:14] needs to have some new skin so you'll
[42:16] have a way uh of receiving the
[42:19] stimulation of
[42:21] Revelation so brother brandom then tells
[42:24] the story and he does this tells us many
[42:26] many times in the message but he talked
[42:29] about going out and if you pull up that
[42:31] picture I think I put a picture on there
[42:33] he talks about going out in the woods
[42:34] and he's on a hunting trip and he goes
[42:37] out and what he calls a burnd down a
[42:39] burnd down or a burnover and he said
[42:42] that when he went through this place he
[42:44] said he he he stopped his horse and he's
[42:47] looking around and he said as he's
[42:49] looking there he sees these great big
[42:51] old spooky trees he said it was
[42:53] nighttime and he said you could see the
[42:56] sky the moon lit the sky and you could
[42:57] see down and he said it was spooky he
[43:00] said anybody riding through there would
[43:02] get scared because of the spookiness of
[43:05] the trees because the trees and and they
[43:07] had once been strong trees but it was
[43:10] just a spooky place and he said they
[43:12] were moaning In The Wind that they were
[43:14] they were actually making a noise in the
[43:16] wind and and so he he got in there he
[43:18] said Lord what are you trying to tell me
[43:20] he could feel there was something that
[43:22] God was trying to tell him and he said
[43:24] he began to think about the scripture
[43:25] that said what the Palmer word ate the
[43:28] the cankerworm what the P worm left the
[43:29] cankerworm ate and the caterpillar ate
[43:31] and all of those things and he said
[43:33] that's these trees they've been eaten
[43:34] back but he said I will restore sayith
[43:37] the Lord but these trees had had a uh
[43:41] there was something about them he said
[43:43] they were established they had the truth
[43:46] they had they were once what God was
[43:48] doing but when the the fire came through
[43:51] and the Holy Spirit then be to move they
[43:54] could no longer because of their
[43:56] condition they can no longer respond in
[43:58] a positive way instead they were
[44:01] responding with this moaning they were
[44:03] responding with this this groaning and
[44:06] and making a mournful
[44:08] noise and and brother BR said they could
[44:10] prove by their history that that they
[44:12] had great things at one time but now the
[44:15] life was gone and now they were dead
[44:17] attempting he said to scare their
[44:19] members into not attending
[44:22] meetings right so we we've all
[44:25] experienced that I'm sure that and he he
[44:28] typed that to the mainline churches of
[44:30] that day that said well you don't need
[44:32] to go to the healing meetings God don't
[44:34] do that no more but he said God does do
[44:37] that so brother Brandon he he gets in
[44:39] there and he says well there's no hope
[44:41] yeah he said that you get in the middle
[44:43] of all these burnover trees and maybe we
[44:46] feel like that some well there's just no
[44:48] hope but it's actually true that a fire
[44:51] when it gets into the woods like that
[44:53] there's certain trees that can only be
[44:56] re born by fire that they actually uh
[45:01] the the pods will come open and the only
[45:03] way that seed could ever drop into the
[45:05] ground is it's released by being burned
[45:08] off oh I just love that and so when the
[45:11] fire came through it didn't just stop
[45:13] with the old spooky trees he said but he
[45:15] noticed some undergrowth some some young
[45:18] trees sitting there where the fire had
[45:19] come through and he said these were not
[45:22] big old strong trees that that making a
[45:25] spooky noise but these were flexible
[45:28] moving in the wind and
[45:30] growing we always want to be growing
[45:32] don't we we don't want to ever stop we
[45:35] don't want to ever get to a place where
[45:37] we can't grow and so he said the wind
[45:39] loosened the roots and he said every
[45:41] time the wind come through he said why
[45:43] does God send a Revival because the wind
[45:45] loosens The Roots so it could grow
[45:47] deeper he talked about the disciples at
[45:50] Pentecost that they were flexible and
[45:52] they rejoiced in the rushing Mighty Wind
[45:54] of the spirit when it come through and
[45:56] we want to be like that Lord give us a
[45:58] flexible heart so so we can rejoice when
[46:01] the spirit of God is moving among us so
[46:04] we can we can we can respond to God's
[46:07] word when it's being preached give us a
[46:09] flexible heart to be led by the spirit
[46:11] of God and so that's what Ezekiel is
[46:14] trying to say he said a new heart will I
[46:16] give you and a new spirit will I put
[46:20] within you and I will take away the
[46:22] Stony heart out of your flesh so he's
[46:26] given you a new heart in place of the
[46:27] Stony heart and a new spirit in place of
[46:31] your old Spirit he said I will give you
[46:34] a heart of
[46:35] flesh but he doesn't stop there he said
[46:38] I will put my spirit within you and
[46:42] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[46:44] shall keep my judgments and do them
[46:46] notice the order a new heart a new
[46:49] spirit but then he says I'll put my
[46:51] spirit within
[46:52] you and brother BR said many people get
[46:56] mixed up there and and this is Brother
[46:58] brandom's solution to why people are so
[47:02] tossed about why people so hard for them
[47:04] to live a Christian Life why they're up
[47:06] today and down tomorrow why you know and
[47:10] I say as Christians all of us go through
[47:13] valleys but we all have hard
[47:16] times but but what keeps us going to
[47:19] church what keeps us if you look at an
[47:21] elder that's been around for a while and
[47:23] so I just admire their life well it's
[47:25] not because they didn't have any hard
[47:26] times
[47:27] it's not because they didn't struggle
[47:29] what kept them at the altar what kept
[47:31] them coming back to the house of God it
[47:33] wasn't because they never did anything
[47:34] wrong but it's because there was
[47:36] something inside of them that held them
[47:39] and so they didn't just have a new
[47:41] spirit but they had the his spirit and
[47:45] and this is Brother brandom's uh if you
[47:47] will it it was his remedy and and and if
[47:50] you find yourself and I'm not just
[47:52] preaching to you because just a small
[47:53] group tonight but but if you find
[47:55] yourself and in any of us and those that
[47:57] watch it or whatever if you find
[48:00] yourself in a place where you're up and
[48:02] down and in and out and always wondering
[48:04] whether you're a Christian or not and
[48:06] not knowing if you're going to make it
[48:07] or not you need to not just have a new
[48:10] spirit but you need to have his Spirit
[48:12] on the
[48:14] inside so that you could you could
[48:17] remain steady in that
[48:19] moment now he said that now the new
[48:23] spirit he said God had to give you a new
[48:24] spirit but that's the new spirit God
[48:26] give you so you could get along with the
[48:27] Holy Ghost see with that old Spirit you
[48:30] had you couldn't get along with your
[48:31] neighbor you couldn't get along with
[48:34] yourself so you know you couldn't get
[48:36] along with God so God gives you a a new
[48:39] spirit right but he said that's not the
[48:42] Holy Ghost and that's where many
[48:43] Pentecostals failed because they they
[48:45] had the new spirit the new heart but
[48:48] they didn't have the they didn't have
[48:50] his spirit so but once you have his
[48:54] Spirit he taught us you don't have to
[48:56] pretend to be a Christian you just do
[48:58] the works of
[49:00] Christ you don't have to force yourself
[49:02] or talk yourself into being a Christ
[49:05] because I'm supposed to but it's
[49:07] something that you want to do though you
[49:09] might fail though you might backside at
[49:12] times or get cold on God but yet there's
[49:14] some there's a desire in your heart
[49:15] that's not the way you want to be and so
[49:18] you don't have to have anybody come talk
[49:20] you in to being a Christian again you
[49:22] just you you you go right back where you
[49:24] come from because that's where you
[49:25] belong all right is in the house of
[49:29] God so uh you know brother random said
[49:32] it's like a main spring and that's not
[49:34] something we really think about today a
[49:36] mainspring but it would be in a
[49:38] mechanical watch so brother Bram said
[49:41] it's like a mainspring in a famous watch
[49:44] he said and it's self- winding that's
[49:46] important he said all right it sits
[49:48] right in the middle of that new spirit
[49:51] and the main spring so the main spring
[49:53] would be his Spirit it sits right in the
[49:55] middle of the new spirit the mainspring
[49:57] of a famous watch sits in the middle of
[50:00] the watch and makes every organ of that
[50:03] watch every little instrument tick just
[50:06] perfectly to
[50:08] time right so that the main Springs
[50:12] there Sunday morning it ticks to the
[50:16] house of God every time the doors are
[50:18] open it ticks right to the house of God
[50:22] that's not saying you'd never miss for
[50:24] vacation I'm not talking about that but
[50:25] when you have opportun it ticks you want
[50:28] to be in the house of God right cuz the
[50:31] main spring is there right and and and
[50:35] and and the it's the main spring it's
[50:36] something that keeps that controls you
[50:38] that keeps you moving and you might have
[50:41] a trial today but the main spring keeps
[50:44] ticking you might get dropped today and
[50:46] get thrown around today and get put in
[50:48] the bottom of a shelf somewhere but the
[50:50] mainstream is the main spring is still
[50:53] ticking and if you pick up that famous
[50:55] watch that well wellmade watch that you
[50:58] might pick it up years later if it's a
[51:00] self-winding watch you all you have to
[51:02] do is get a little bit of a shaking and
[51:05] and it'll come back again and that main
[51:07] Spring's still there and it'll just keep
[51:10] ticking right it keeps time now look
[51:15] brother brand said it's all done by a
[51:17] main spring and the little works out on
[51:18] the side move with this main spring it's
[51:21] the wheel in the middle of the wheel as
[51:24] Ezekiel said we'll come back to that in
[51:26] a moment so he said the mainspring is a
[51:27] famous
[51:28] watch what's a main spring I I got a
[51:31] picture of one I may have shown this to
[51:33] you before I don't know but I'm getting
[51:35] old so I can repeat myself and not worry
[51:37] about it because I can't
[51:39] remember that that's you could laugh at
[51:41] that it's all right but a mainspring
[51:46] this is an actual watch mainspring and
[51:48] it's just a piece of
[51:49] Steel and it's made by an artisan for
[51:52] many many years it was a great even
[51:54] great watch makers would not make their
[51:56] own main Springs only a few people in
[51:58] the world were qualified to make them
[52:01] because they were had to be made by with
[52:03] a certain mixture they would actually
[52:05] mix the iron and the alloy and all the
[52:07] different things together to make a
[52:09] flexible steel that then could be wound
[52:12] up really tight and put inside the watch
[52:15] and that looks like it's great big it's
[52:16] actually very long but if you maybe two
[52:20] feet long or something like that but
[52:22] when it's done it's put in just a little
[52:24] bitty spot in the watch if You' you got
[52:26] a mechanical watch you'll see inside of
[52:29] that there's a main spring so H the main
[52:33] spring is what keeps the watch ticking I
[52:35] think I've got yet that shows how it's
[52:37] coiled it's foot inside that little
[52:39] cylinder and it's coiled up real tight
[52:41] and that main spring will keep the watch
[52:43] ticking year after year after year and
[52:45] if you go to the next picture I think I
[52:48] that may be it I think I had a picture
[52:50] of a watch with the main spring in it
[52:51] but I don't think you could have seen it
[52:52] anyway because it's so small when it
[52:55] gets there to the end so Bram ties this
[52:57] to ezekiel's four living
[53:00] creatures so how many remember in the
[53:03] Book of Ezekiel there was four living
[53:04] creatures Ezekiel chapter 1:1 15 as I
[53:07] beheld the living creatures he said
[53:09] behold one wheel upon the Earth this is
[53:12] a strange Vision he said there was a
[53:14] wheel upon the Earth by the living
[53:15] creatures that had four faces the
[53:18] appearance of the wheels and their work
[53:20] was like in the color of a barrel a a
[53:23] barrel Stone and they had they four had
[53:25] one likeness their appearance and their
[53:27] work was as it were a wheel in the
[53:30] middle of a wheel so brother brandom
[53:32] says that's that's what this mainspring
[53:34] was he said it was Christ which was the
[53:38] Hub of the wheel the G the oh my the
[53:42] inside gear the main spring the wheel in
[53:46] the middle so he even goes out and gives
[53:49] a very colorful explanation he said it's
[53:51] like a wagon wheel going down the road
[53:53] he said the justification was the outer
[53:55] rim or the Tire he said the
[53:57] sanctification was that inner Rim he
[54:00] said and uh he said the Pentecostals got
[54:02] speaking in tongues he said they had one
[54:05] spoke yeah he said but there's nine
[54:07] spokes to the wheel right nine spiritual
[54:10] gifts but they they cabbage down on one
[54:13] he said and say that was that one spoke
[54:15] he said that's why it clunk down the
[54:17] road yeah right cuz it only had one
[54:19] spoke he said but he said but if they
[54:21] had all nine spokes in there he said
[54:24] then Christ would be the main SP or the
[54:26] center of that wheel what makes
[54:29] everything turn without the Hub nothing
[54:32] else works so he is the wheel in the
[54:35] middle of the wheel other words the
[54:37] wheel that moves all the other Wheels he
[54:40] said brother Ben what keeps you going
[54:42] what what keeps you moving if you'd ask
[54:44] one of these Elders what keeps you going
[54:46] when the times are tough and and and it
[54:48] seems like there's no reason to go on
[54:50] what keeps you moving the wheel in the
[54:52] middle of the
[54:53] wheel so that's what Ezekiel Saw when he
[54:56] saw Christ and the a when Christ emptied
[54:59] out paradise he said there's the wheel
[55:01] in the middle of the wheel there's the
[55:03] one who keeps us going so brother brand
[55:07] said we're in the last days and the last
[55:08] hours of the days he said do you see him
[55:11] now in his word all of his word someone
[55:14] say all all of his word made manifest
[55:18] right here before us oh Church of the
[55:20] Living God he said get to your feet
[55:22] believe him with all that's in you hold
[55:25] to that little wheel in the middle of
[55:28] the wheel let it stabilize every move
[55:31] and every motion that you
[55:35] make so if the wheel is in control the
[55:38] wheel in the middle of the wheel
[55:40] wherever it moves the outside wheel
[55:44] moves right so whatever wherever the
[55:46] wheel in the middle of the wheel moves
[55:49] is where the spirit moves and the flesh
[55:52] moves why it's in
[55:54] control it's in it's it's
[55:56] stabilizes that's what keeps a person
[55:58] coming
[55:59] back and this one might fail and that
[56:02] one might fail and this one might fall
[56:04] and even the person themselves might
[56:06] make a mistake or fall or do something
[56:08] wrong but but they you know in spite of
[56:11] themselves something inside keeps them
[56:14] moving I'll say this that that that's
[56:17] got to be the place that we come to and
[56:19] say Lord I I know I need you I I I may
[56:22] struggle understanding this and I may
[56:24] not I may not completely get all of this
[56:26] but I know I need you Lord You're the
[56:28] wheel in the middle of my wheel you're
[56:30] what you're what keeps me
[56:32] moving you're what gives me a reason
[56:35] yeah got to be something there yes got
[56:38] to hold to that every thought that you
[56:41] have may it be controlled by this tower
[56:44] on the inside of you because God is
[56:47] setting right in his word of this hour
[56:50] in the evening light showing forth the
[56:52] light what is he saying he is the wheel
[56:54] in the middle of the wheel the message
[56:56] of the hour was Christ and the message
[56:59] is the wheel that drives everything we
[57:01] do right are you with me
[57:05] now he said the holy spirit will make
[57:07] every movement like
[57:08] Christ it'll make you Christlike yes the
[57:12] fruits of the spirit is love joy peace
[57:16] longsuffering goodness meekness
[57:19] gentleness patience faith those things
[57:23] are what the Holy Spirit controls our
[57:26] emotions I know this is teaching tonight
[57:28] but it's Wednesday night so you just
[57:30] bear with me he said our emotions is not
[57:32] so much as jumping up and down you could
[57:34] do that brother random had a colorful
[57:37] way of doing this he said a shinig will
[57:38] bring that to
[57:40] you right you could jump in the spirit
[57:42] or jump out a shindig whatever that is
[57:45] but the Holy Spirit brings you into
[57:48] operation or in control of God that you
[57:52] walk in peace and in love and in Joy
[57:55] with a long suffer suffering goodness
[57:57] meekness gentleness patience you see it
[58:00] isn't something that you do it's
[58:03] something the Holy Spirit does in you
[58:06] right right you see it's no longer an
[58:08] intellectual thought of your own it's so
[58:11] important church we can't think it
[58:14] through and plan it through well enough
[58:17] right to make it
[58:18] work it'll never happen you'll never be
[58:21] able to to set your life up in such a
[58:24] way and so govern your own life by by
[58:27] even by taking the word you can take the
[58:28] scripture and say well I'm going to just
[58:30] live the scripture and I'm going to do
[58:31] all this but you don't know what's going
[58:33] to happen but the mainspring does the
[58:37] one on the inside does and he's able to
[58:40] take the surprises and turn them to your
[58:42] benefit turn them to your good he's able
[58:45] to do that but you can't do that on your
[58:47] own sir you can't think that through
[58:50] intellectually it's no longer an
[58:51] intellectual thought of your own it's a
[58:53] subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit
[58:57] he said oh I wish I could shout the
[58:58] Praises of God around the world to that
[59:00] so he wasn't against shouting or jumping
[59:03] but it was it was that mainspring
[59:05] controls more than
[59:07] that right so he said a Christian with
[59:11] the spirit of Christ in his heart now
[59:14] look it goes through the same things
[59:17] everyone else
[59:18] does right the Temptation that's taking
[59:20] you Paul says is common to men right it
[59:23] it it's something that every one of us I
[59:26] I guess that all of our lives are
[59:27] different here tonight and yet you can
[59:29] find somebody in the world going through
[59:31] what you go through there's somebody
[59:33] else going through what you go through
[59:35] if you get a big enough group together
[59:37] it's just that's what the Bible says but
[59:39] a Christian goes through the same things
[59:41] but you remains a
[59:43] Christian and I know some of you have
[59:45] been through some things but you're here
[59:46] tonight and you love the Lord with all
[59:48] of your heart and you're still worship
[59:50] and you still thank God even though
[59:52] you've been through all of that yet
[59:53] you're still in the house of God what
[59:55] does that mean There's Something There
[59:57] Brother Bruce it's not just you there's
[59:59] something inside of you and that's what
[1:00:02] our young people need that's what our
[1:00:03] elders that's what we all need we need
[1:00:05] that main spring on the inside that can
[1:00:08] that can just click every time with the
[1:00:11] clock and be right on time with the word
[1:00:13] of
[1:00:14] God see remember what he said it's a
[1:00:17] self- winding
[1:00:19] watch right a self-winding
[1:00:23] mainspring so he don't have to wind the
[1:00:25] main I don't have to whine the main
[1:00:27] spring the main spring whines
[1:00:30] itself amen Matthew 11 and 20 and
[1:00:34] brother brandom would go here and in the
[1:00:36] in that sermon he in Matthew 11:29 take
[1:00:39] my yoke upon you and learn of me for I
[1:00:41] am meek and lowly in heart you shall
[1:00:43] find rest to your souls for my yoke is
[1:00:46] easy my burden is light brother brand
[1:00:50] said when you get this spirit in you
[1:00:52] this mainspring he said then the burdens
[1:00:54] of Life become
[1:00:56] light you don't notice them anymore the
[1:01:00] Yol is lined with feathers they become
[1:01:03] so
[1:01:05] easy they say you say well brother Ben
[1:01:07] you have not lived my life lately but I
[1:01:10] the word applies to all of us right it
[1:01:13] just depends on how we're looking at it
[1:01:16] and then he says this he said then the
[1:01:18] people that pile things on you all right
[1:01:22] we could just stop there for a minute
[1:01:23] couldn't
[1:01:24] we right right sometimes people pile
[1:01:27] things on you right they don't make it
[1:01:29] right they shouldn't do that they
[1:01:31] shouldn't do that but look what you do
[1:01:33] with it that'll determine your outcome
[1:01:37] people are going to pile things on you
[1:01:39] sometimes it's your wife sometimes it's
[1:01:41] your husband sometimes it's people in
[1:01:43] the church sometimes it's somebody on
[1:01:44] the outside sometimes it's a person at
[1:01:46] the bank sometimes someone at the
[1:01:47] grocery store sometimes someone at work
[1:01:51] it may be a wife it may be a husband it
[1:01:52] may be a child it may be somebody else
[1:01:56] but people because they're people tend
[1:01:59] to love to add to your
[1:02:01] burden right and and the thing is like
[1:02:05] you can't just stay away from people it
[1:02:07] don't
[1:02:08] work right you got to have people in
[1:02:10] your life because it's a blessing that
[1:02:13] they can bring as well and you can't
[1:02:14] help nobody if you're not around people
[1:02:17] but brother BR said you know what to do
[1:02:19] he said you're like Samson at the gates
[1:02:21] of Gaza I love this who picked up the
[1:02:25] big grass gate and packed it up on the
[1:02:29] hill now you say brother Ben this isn't
[1:02:31] very deep but there's a great Revelation
[1:02:33] here we need to we need to get to a
[1:02:37] place where we can pick up those burdens
[1:02:38] that people pile on us and just carry
[1:02:41] them to the hill you say well I can't do
[1:02:43] it Samson couldn't do it either he
[1:02:46] couldn't by his natural strength pick up
[1:02:48] big old brass Gates and that were
[1:02:50] probably 20 foot tall and carry them up
[1:02:52] to the up the mountain he couldn't do
[1:02:55] that they thought thought they had him
[1:02:56] boxed in he couldn't carry that that the
[1:02:58] people had piled on him but he oh my but
[1:03:01] he still picked them up why because he
[1:03:03] had the spirit in him to do it with
[1:03:06] something inside of him that gave him
[1:03:08] strength and I believe there's a
[1:03:09] strength Giver here tonight yes amen you
[1:03:14] say I got the Holy Ghost brother Brandon
[1:03:16] said I don't think that should be said
[1:03:18] you must say the Holy Ghost got
[1:03:20] me and then when the Holy Ghost gets you
[1:03:22] the burdens the yoke is easy and you
[1:03:25] pick Pi up the big Gates of Gaza and
[1:03:28] pack them straight to
[1:03:30] Calvary and there on Mount Calvary you
[1:03:33] lay them at the feet of Jesus and pray
[1:03:35] for your enemies not with a grudge Lord
[1:03:38] if you'd bust him open no but with
[1:03:40] something from your heart dear God that
[1:03:42] man is a man like I
[1:03:45] am that's when you know the main
[1:03:47] Spring's working when people pile
[1:03:49] everything they can pile on you and you
[1:03:51] pick up that burden take it to Calvary
[1:03:52] and pray for the people who piled it on
[1:03:55] you
[1:03:58] see the mainspring controls our
[1:04:01] emotions brother Brown said when the
[1:04:03] Holy Spirit comes in there's something
[1:04:05] that moves you you can't understand what
[1:04:07] it is it's a supernatural being inside
[1:04:10] you moving controlling your emotions
[1:04:12] making you scream when actually you feel
[1:04:15] like running so in other words it's not
[1:04:17] worship should not be
[1:04:19] premeditated like in this service
[1:04:22] man I tell you what I'm going to find
[1:04:24] the right time and if they if they sing
[1:04:26] the right song I'm going to run well we
[1:04:29] love to see people run but that's not
[1:04:30] what it's
[1:04:31] about right we're not that's that's
[1:04:34] forethought that's just having a good
[1:04:35] time like you plan to dance at the
[1:04:38] dance right but that's not what the
[1:04:40] mainspring does he said sometimes you'll
[1:04:43] scream when you think about when you
[1:04:45] feel like running he said you'll shout
[1:04:47] when you don't know what you're doing
[1:04:49] yeah he said you'll praise God just
[1:04:51] automatically all right something
[1:04:54] happens and what what it what he's
[1:04:56] trying to tell us if you go and listen
[1:04:57] to those sermons it's not something
[1:04:59] that's premeditated just because there's
[1:05:01] music but you might be in the worst
[1:05:03] trial of your life and going through the
[1:05:05] hardest moment and waiting through the
[1:05:07] mud and all of a sudden you lift up your
[1:05:09] hands and you're sitting in the church
[1:05:10] and maybe a quiet night with just a few
[1:05:12] people but you lift up your hands anyway
[1:05:14] and you say I bless you oh Lord I BL I
[1:05:17] something in you responds you hear the
[1:05:19] word being preaching something in you I
[1:05:21] know that's right and you step up and
[1:05:23] you begin to worship God anyway oh that
[1:05:26] we'd have more mainspring worshippers
[1:05:28] that worship when God told them to
[1:05:30] worship not just when everybody else is
[1:05:32] but when they feel the presence of God
[1:05:34] they don't think about doing it they
[1:05:35] just do
[1:05:37] it every once in a while you hear an Old
[1:05:39] Saint cry out and see tears going down
[1:05:42] their face and you'll see people be why
[1:05:44] what is it there's a mainspring
[1:05:47] there Hallelujah you don't have to work
[1:05:49] that up it's a main
[1:05:52] spring he said it's that main spring the
[1:05:54] spring of God's Grace I love the way he
[1:05:56] put that in the middle of your heart
[1:05:58] controlling you making you shunn from
[1:06:00] evil accept life get away from doubt
[1:06:03] have faith that mainspring will make you
[1:06:06] cast down reasoning and accept God's
[1:06:10] word oh all of us need that it's a
[1:06:13] moving ticking going round and round
[1:06:17] making your whole emotion come right in
[1:06:20] control with
[1:06:22] God right now brother BR said when the
[1:06:26] holy spirit's in the middle of your
[1:06:28] spirit now remember you got to have a
[1:06:30] new new
[1:06:31] spirit the Holy Ghost won't ever come in
[1:06:35] you got to have a new heart which is a
[1:06:36] new desire to serve God the Holy Ghost
[1:06:39] won't ever come in but when you receive
[1:06:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the holy
[1:06:43] spirit is in the middle of your spirit
[1:06:45] makes every action of the Holy Spirit In
[1:06:47] You tick off just exactly according to
[1:06:50] God's time piece the Bible it's the main
[1:06:53] spring that does it it's the Holy Spirit
[1:06:55] that does it it isn't your church that
[1:06:57] does it it isn't your pastor that does
[1:07:00] it it isn't your shouting that does it
[1:07:02] it isn't your speaking with tongues that
[1:07:04] does it it isn't a healing service that
[1:07:06] does it it's the holy spirit that does
[1:07:08] it God's holy spirit in the middle of
[1:07:10] your new spirit it makes the whole
[1:07:13] church operate just exactly one big
[1:07:16] bundle of love you say what do we need
[1:07:18] to love one another more the
[1:07:21] mainspring right and that's what the
[1:07:23] Capstone was the the the the stone that
[1:07:26] was rejected by the builders was love it
[1:07:29] was actually it was actually Christ and
[1:07:31] he is love God is love was actually the
[1:07:34] most important Stone in the building he
[1:07:36] said the builders thought they could
[1:07:37] build the temple and this little old
[1:07:38] funny main spring didn't seem to fit in
[1:07:41] anywhere they kicked it out over in a
[1:07:42] weed pile where they kicked the Holy
[1:07:44] Ghost governing the church out in a weed
[1:07:46] pile but they come to find out it was
[1:07:48] the Chief Cornerstone he said my brother
[1:07:50] sister we've had all kinds of Sensations
[1:07:53] all kinds of evidences all kinds of
[1:07:54] everything else but until we come back
[1:07:56] to the main spring our church is only
[1:07:58] just as dry as the rest of them we've
[1:08:00] got to come back where there's something
[1:08:02] in the member it don't stop up here
[1:08:05] something in each one of the individual
[1:08:07] members that gives him peace and joy and
[1:08:10] and he's always on the Mountaintop
[1:08:12] shouting the Praises of
[1:08:14] God again that don't mean he doesn't go
[1:08:17] through anything but he's not
[1:08:19] dependent on the
[1:08:22] weather right he's not dependent s with
[1:08:25] a jol quote today brother Brandon said
[1:08:28] he said well I could go to church today
[1:08:30] but but it's just so hot and it was hot
[1:08:34] today but it's just so hot he said it's
[1:08:37] going to be a whole lot
[1:08:39] hotter where you
[1:08:41] going church I just you know we don't
[1:08:45] want to be like that do we we want to be
[1:08:47] rugged Christians what do we need the
[1:08:48] main
[1:08:50] spring something in the member that
[1:08:53] makes him on the mountain top not
[1:08:54] because he's always feels good or has
[1:08:57] money right CU if I was only on the
[1:08:59] mountain top when I had money I sure
[1:09:00] wouldn't spend much time
[1:09:02] there and we have to grow have valleys
[1:09:05] because in the valley brother brand said
[1:09:06] where the fruits grow right right the
[1:09:09] fruit don't grow on the mountain he said
[1:09:10] they get
[1:09:11] frostbit I love the way the prophet put
[1:09:14] things but he said in The Valleys where
[1:09:16] the fruit grows that's the area of your
[1:09:19] life when you're going through some
[1:09:20] things that's when God that's when your
[1:09:21] faith shows that's when your
[1:09:22] perseverance shows that's when you show
[1:09:24] whose side you're on but the way you're
[1:09:27] always on the mountain top shouting the
[1:09:28] Praises of God is you're going to shout
[1:09:30] the Praises of God whether you're going
[1:09:31] through the valley or wherever you're at
[1:09:33] you still love God
[1:09:35] anyway oh my well the B said I wish I
[1:09:38] could get you to see it he said then the
[1:09:40] Yoke becomes easy it doesn't shave
[1:09:43] around the collar have any of you ever
[1:09:46] ever uh drove horses or mules uh
[1:09:50] nobody's old enough to have done that we
[1:09:53] have they're of course you
[1:09:57] have if you've driven and and you know
[1:10:00] this when you put that that thing around
[1:10:02] the collar around their neck or you put
[1:10:05] it's got a collar you know if it was it
[1:10:08] wasn't just right it would shave the
[1:10:10] neck and you'd get a raw spot on the
[1:10:14] neck or on the shoulder where that where
[1:10:16] that was pulling and so you had to it
[1:10:19] had to have a padding on the
[1:10:21] inside and and I think that was the
[1:10:23] problem with some of them horses we had
[1:10:24] is that the there was no padding there
[1:10:26] on the old equipment we were using so it
[1:10:29] got to shaen them a little bit and it
[1:10:31] would actually bring draw blood and so
[1:10:33] you'd have to take care of it so you'd
[1:10:35] have to line that with something to keep
[1:10:38] it to where it doesn't shave the the the
[1:10:41] neck of the horse or the or the donkey
[1:10:43] or whatever it is that you're pulling
[1:10:44] with the mule I guess you wouldn't pull
[1:10:46] very far with a donkey but he said Oh my
[1:10:49] he said I wish you could get to see it
[1:10:51] he said then the Yol becomes easy it
[1:10:52] doesn't shave around the collar it's
[1:10:54] lined with With
[1:10:56] Love Oh my he said if it's only lined
[1:10:59] with emotion it'll soon shave around the
[1:11:02] collar so emotions are only temporary
[1:11:06] you're only going to feel you say I feel
[1:11:08] good tonight brother Ben you're only
[1:11:09] going to feel that good for a little
[1:11:11] while right when you get married some of
[1:11:14] you young people not very many of Youth
[1:11:16] here tonight but you listen to me when
[1:11:18] you get married or before you get
[1:11:19] married oh we just you know that feeling
[1:11:22] of Love better enjoy it while it lasts
[1:11:25] yeah yes and and and I believe you can
[1:11:27] be in love and be old but it becomes a
[1:11:30] choice becomes something you choose to
[1:11:32] do because sometimes you don't feel like
[1:11:35] it right so you get up and I made the
[1:11:37] statement before you get up and you
[1:11:39] choose to stay married every
[1:11:42] day it's just a
[1:11:44] choice right and and and
[1:11:47] because sometimes it shapes if I'm
[1:11:50] saying that
[1:11:51] correctly it will chafe around the
[1:11:53] collar now
[1:11:55] brother Brandon says now you can shout a
[1:11:58] little bit at church you go out on the
[1:11:59] street and somebody says you know you're
[1:12:00] a Holy Roller oh it chafes real
[1:12:04] bad somebody said well look why I seen
[1:12:06] you down the other night shouting till
[1:12:07] your hair fell down think we've had that
[1:12:10] problem lately
[1:12:11] but well John I suppose if that's the
[1:12:14] way you're going to do it we might as
[1:12:15] well get away from that group oh see
[1:12:17] that's not what we say it's chaing see
[1:12:20] but when the main spring is in there it
[1:12:23] lines it with love you Yol is easy you
[1:12:26] can bear anything they call you a Holy
[1:12:28] Roller call you a fanatic anything they
[1:12:30] want to the yolk is so easy you can lay
[1:12:32] it up on your shoulders when you're
[1:12:34] yolked up with the main spring and it's
[1:12:36] not you anymore it's him that's ticking
[1:12:38] it
[1:12:40] off right the clock keeps
[1:12:42] ticking no matter what happens whatever
[1:12:44] else is going on in your life the clock
[1:12:46] keeps ticking why the mainspring you
[1:12:49] might be driven to your last Wits
[1:12:53] End somebody might have stepped on your
[1:12:55] very last
[1:12:57] nerve that you walk in the house of
[1:13:01] God say well it's going to be a quiet
[1:13:04] service but the main Spring's still
[1:13:07] there right so you so you it's not you
[1:13:11] controlling your emotions well I you
[1:13:12] might sit there with every intention of
[1:13:14] being miserable but but but there's the
[1:13:16] mainspring something in your heart
[1:13:18] Springs up yes and and won't let you
[1:13:21] stay that way it's a mainspring brother
[1:13:25] BR said it's so easy just like Samson
[1:13:27] with the braz gates of Gaza he just
[1:13:29] packed them away when somebody calls you
[1:13:31] a Holy Roller and makes fun of you you
[1:13:33] just pack the old burden right up to a
[1:13:34] certain mountain called Calvary and pray
[1:13:37] for
[1:13:37] them again he said when the Yol is line
[1:13:40] with joy and peace and sweetness of
[1:13:42] Christ in your heart so what's it
[1:13:44] aligned with the fruits of the spirit
[1:13:46] it's aligned with love and joy and peace
[1:13:48] and sweetness he said then you just pick
[1:13:50] up all the burdens the World cast on you
[1:13:53] oh we get burdens don't we yeah we don't
[1:13:56] we we're not free from burdens but he
[1:13:58] said my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:14:00] light so we just pick up all the burdens
[1:14:03] the World cast on us and bear them to a
[1:14:05] certain Hill called Calvary and there
[1:14:07] you kneel down and pray for that one
[1:14:10] that was persecuting you not rain fire
[1:14:13] out of heaven and tear up the church but
[1:14:16] bring peace to them God be merciful to
[1:14:20] them God help us to be like that see the
[1:14:24] main spring keeps you on course and in
[1:14:27] God's
[1:14:29] time now do can I have just a few more
[1:14:32] minutes you're all doing good tonight
[1:14:33] haven't put anybody to sleep yet so
[1:14:35] we're all right now Paul the Apostle
[1:14:38] Paul faced an uncertain Journey at
[1:14:41] towards the end of his life he had to go
[1:14:44] to Rome he knew he had to go to Rome and
[1:14:46] he chose to go he didn't have to go but
[1:14:48] he had to go he had to go up to
[1:14:49] Jerusalem and then they were going to
[1:14:50] arrest him and they were going to go to
[1:14:52] Rome and he was told by prophecy that he
[1:14:55] was going to be
[1:14:56] arrested and that he was going to be
[1:14:59] imprisoned and he said I I don't know
[1:15:01] what is ahead of me he said only I've
[1:15:03] heard these prophecies but none of these
[1:15:06] things move me all
[1:15:08] right I love that not even the prophecy
[1:15:12] that come forth that said don't go up
[1:15:15] right cuz the prophesied were telling
[1:15:16] him the the prophets of that day were
[1:15:18] telling him don't go up and they were
[1:15:20] real prophets but he had a will of God
[1:15:23] in his life something that had to happen
[1:15:26] yeah he knew he would probably end up in
[1:15:28] Chains he knew he was going to get
[1:15:30] arrested but he had to go because he
[1:15:32] knew that God had called him to stand
[1:15:34] before Caesar all right and so he had to
[1:15:37] go he had an uncertain Journey but he
[1:15:39] had the main spring he said none of
[1:15:41] these things move me neither count I my
[1:15:43] life dear un myself so that I might
[1:15:45] finish my course with joy and the
[1:15:47] ministry which I have received of the
[1:15:49] Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the
[1:15:51] grace of God listen Paul wrote
[1:15:54] Philippians from a prison cell right the
[1:15:57] whole I I can't even imagine preaching a
[1:15:59] sermon from prison right because so many
[1:16:01] times we preach what we
[1:16:03] feel that's just true you you preach you
[1:16:06] know out of your own Spirit you preach
[1:16:09] and and you try not to do that every
[1:16:11] time you try to get in the spirit of
[1:16:13] Christ but many times we preach someone
[1:16:15] said don't get in the flesh well we're
[1:16:16] in the flesh but hopefully the main
[1:16:18] spring is what's controlling us
[1:16:20] controlling that flesh but Paul's in
[1:16:23] prison think about his his environment
[1:16:26] think about the the atmosphere of the
[1:16:28] prison that'll bring you down look it
[1:16:30] brought John the Baptist so far down
[1:16:32] that he didn't know if Christ was real
[1:16:34] or not if he was the one or not he was
[1:16:36] the one who told him who he was he was
[1:16:39] the one the Revelation came to and he
[1:16:40] said still still said are you the one or
[1:16:42] should we look for another why because
[1:16:44] he he his Eagle Eye got filmed over in
[1:16:47] the prison but Paul had something John
[1:16:49] didn't have John was the greatest of the
[1:16:52] Old Testament prophets but Paul had
[1:16:54] something John didn't have what did he
[1:16:55] have the
[1:16:56] mainspring he had the Holy Ghost and he
[1:16:59] writes Philippians from prison and in
[1:17:02] that book he acknowledges the difficulty
[1:17:04] he acknowledges the circumstances but
[1:17:07] the circumstances did not control who he
[1:17:10] was and look what he says towards the
[1:17:12] end of that letter Philippians 4:4 he
[1:17:14] said rejoice in the lord
[1:17:17] always yeah his feet are Shackled yeah
[1:17:21] his hands are are are bound he just
[1:17:24] maybe barely able to write or dictate to
[1:17:26] someone else to
[1:17:28] write his eyes had a problem with his
[1:17:31] eyes historians saying in his eyes it
[1:17:33] was hard to read he said you see how
[1:17:35] large a letter I'm writing to you words
[1:17:38] I write with big he wrote with big
[1:17:39] letters because all those words that he
[1:17:42] wrote that we have in the Bible I'm
[1:17:43] thankful he wrote it aren't you I'm
[1:17:45] thankful that he wrote this but he wrote
[1:17:47] it through great difficulty great
[1:17:50] physical difficulty and yet he wrote he
[1:17:54] said rejoice rejoice in the lord
[1:17:58] always amen we get to preach a whole
[1:18:01] sermon on that he said again I say
[1:18:03] rejoice see Paul knew what it was like
[1:18:06] to worship when he was physically bound
[1:18:09] but his Spirit was
[1:18:10] free he was physically in an atmosphere
[1:18:15] of torture an atmosphere of cold an
[1:18:18] atmosphere where they didn't take care
[1:18:19] of his physical needs but in in his
[1:18:22] Spirit he was still warm even though it
[1:18:24] might have been cold in the prison but
[1:18:26] it was warm on the inside and he said
[1:18:28] I'm telling you rejoice if I can write
[1:18:30] this from a prison you can sit on your
[1:18:32] on on a comfortable seat on a Wednesday
[1:18:34] night and
[1:18:35] rejoice rejoice in the lord always and
[1:18:39] again I say
[1:18:41] rejoice he knew what it was like to
[1:18:43] worship when he had no reason to worship
[1:18:46] but God was still
[1:18:47] worthy hey man why he had the main
[1:18:50] spring Philippians 4:6 again written
[1:18:52] from prison be careful for nothing but
[1:18:55] in everything by prayer and supplication
[1:18:58] with Thanksgiving let your request be
[1:18:59] made known unto God that word careful
[1:19:01] means anxious
[1:19:04] concerned don't
[1:19:05] worry people are so worried they're
[1:19:08] going to get deceived or somebody's
[1:19:09] going to misuse them or something's
[1:19:10] going to happen don't worry but God will
[1:19:13] take care of you be careful for nothing
[1:19:16] but in everything someone say everything
[1:19:19] by prayer and supplication with
[1:19:21] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[1:19:23] known unto God
[1:19:25] and the peace of God which passeth all
[1:19:28] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:19:30] Minds through Christ Jesus what was Paul
[1:19:32] doing he knew what he was writing about
[1:19:34] how did he know that there was peace
[1:19:36] that pass his understanding because he
[1:19:38] couldn't understand why he had the peace
[1:19:40] that he did in the prison but he had it
[1:19:43] anyway sometimes I don't understand why
[1:19:45] the peace of God floods my soul in a
[1:19:47] moment of trial but I know it has to be
[1:19:49] the main spring and I'm sure all of you
[1:19:51] have experienced the same thing why do
[1:19:53] we keep going to that House of God why
[1:19:55] do we keep pressing on because of the
[1:19:59] mainspring Hallelujah see people who
[1:20:01] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:03] they don't know what they're missing
[1:20:05] people who haven't been sealed by God by
[1:20:07] the spirit of God they don't know what
[1:20:08] they're missing they don't realize and
[1:20:11] sometimes I think we who have it we
[1:20:12] don't appreciate it enough because we
[1:20:15] know that that without it we would be
[1:20:17] just like everybody else we would we
[1:20:20] would be in and out and up and down not
[1:20:22] know who we were but the Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] revealed to us who we are sir amen and I
[1:20:28] don't mean the body can't question the
[1:20:29] flesh can't question the mind doesn't
[1:20:31] question sure it does but there's a
[1:20:33] mainspring now that keeps
[1:20:37] you Philippians 4:8 finally Brethren oh
[1:20:41] my after you've made your requests known
[1:20:45] and the peace of God will keep your
[1:20:47] hearts keep your
[1:20:49] minds finally Brethren whatsoever things
[1:20:51] are
[1:20:52] true whatever things are on honest
[1:20:55] whatever things are just whatever things
[1:20:57] are pure whatever things are lovely
[1:20:59] soever things are of good report if
[1:21:01] there be any virtue if there be any
[1:21:03] praise think on these
[1:21:05] things oh again how's he writing that
[1:21:09] well because he's sitting in
[1:21:11] prison casting
[1:21:13] down thoughts
[1:21:16] imaginations right actively casting down
[1:21:20] the fear of that rat that wanted to
[1:21:22] nibble on his toes
[1:21:25] right think about it he's sitting there
[1:21:29] actively having to put that out of his
[1:21:32] mind that rat was going to be
[1:21:36] back that that that the cold was still
[1:21:39] going to be there the dark the
[1:21:42] loneliness he's actively putting that
[1:21:44] out Roman prisons were no
[1:21:46] fun you can go to Rome and see and I
[1:21:48] think I may have showed it to you before
[1:21:50] but there's like a hole in the ground
[1:21:52] and that's where they say Paul was kept
[1:21:55] it's it's it's hard to even imagine it's
[1:21:59] hard to even imagine what he went
[1:22:01] through and it's during those times when
[1:22:03] he's writing to you see God put you
[1:22:05] through things for a reason he let you
[1:22:07] go through things for a reason why so
[1:22:09] you can help other people and so Paul's
[1:22:11] sitting there thinking I'm going to
[1:22:13] think the things that are true I'm going
[1:22:14] to think the things that are honest I'm
[1:22:16] going to trust God even though he knew
[1:22:17] he was probably going to get his head
[1:22:19] chopped off that was the best case
[1:22:21] scenario that could happen to Paul
[1:22:23] because Christians during that that time
[1:22:25] listen to me he could smell Christians
[1:22:29] burning right that's history Nero put
[1:22:34] took Christians alive covered them in
[1:22:36] oil and lit them on fire and used them
[1:22:38] as torches in his garden and Paul's
[1:22:41] sitting in the prison smelling the
[1:22:43] burning flesh of Christians he says
[1:22:46] Rejoice
[1:22:48] always whatever's
[1:22:51] true whatever's honest whatever's just
[1:22:55] whatever is pure you realize he wrote
[1:22:58] Romans 13 I believe it is from there 12
[1:23:01] or 13 where he says he says the the the
[1:23:05] the powers that be are only put there by
[1:23:09] God right and you should be subject to
[1:23:11] the higher power let every soul be
[1:23:13] subject to the higher power he wrote
[1:23:15] that when Nero was the higher
[1:23:19] power that takes a mainspring
[1:23:22] church right see brother BR said may you
[1:23:26] thoroughly understand that it isn't
[1:23:28] Church it isn't intellectuals it isn't
[1:23:31] knowing the Bible it isn't any of these
[1:23:33] things it's God's love the holy spirit
[1:23:36] in the middle of that spirit that you
[1:23:37] quit drinking and quit smoking and quit
[1:23:39] lying then God's holy spirit in that
[1:23:41] Spirit begins to make it work just
[1:23:43] exactly right he said then love then
[1:23:46] you're on the mountain top all the time
[1:23:47] whether things are coming right or going
[1:23:49] right you still got the victory he said
[1:23:52] live or die why when they was going to
[1:23:53] cut Paul's head off he said I fought a
[1:23:55] good fight finished the course kept the
[1:23:57] faith henceforth there's laid up for me
[1:23:58] a crown of righteousness or he said the
[1:24:01] the righteous judge will give me it that
[1:24:02] day not only me but all those that love
[1:24:04] his appearing and the grave looked back
[1:24:07] at him and death looked back at him and
[1:24:08] said Paul we're going to have you in a
[1:24:10] few minutes but that main spring was
[1:24:12] still ticking he's oh I feel like
[1:24:14] running and shouting tonight that main
[1:24:16] spring was still ticking he said death
[1:24:18] where is your sting grave where is your
[1:24:20] Victory show me where you can scare me
[1:24:24] yeah show me where you can make me
[1:24:25] listen to this important make me take
[1:24:28] the cross
[1:24:30] off because he wanted to get Paul if
[1:24:33] Paul all you'd have to do is say well I
[1:24:35] don't believe that no more I'm not part
[1:24:37] of that group and he could have walked
[1:24:39] away from all of his troubles how many
[1:24:42] people have done that how many people
[1:24:45] used to sit Among Us have done that just
[1:24:48] announce the message and you could walk
[1:24:51] away just say it it wasn't real
[1:24:54] or you just don't believe it no more and
[1:24:56] walk away come on and all the
[1:24:58] persecution
[1:25:01] leaves and suddenly you're just able to
[1:25:04] live and do Paul could have done that
[1:25:07] but he said death you can't scare me all
[1:25:09] right yeah show me where you can make me
[1:25:12] take the cross
[1:25:14] off why because I got the spirit of
[1:25:16] Christ in me and they beat him and they
[1:25:20] they tortured him and they they he
[1:25:22] dragged across he was so weak that
[1:25:24] someone else had to carry his cross but
[1:25:25] it's still he still made it to Calvary
[1:25:28] show me where you can make me take the
[1:25:30] cross
[1:25:32] off devil can do a lot of things but he
[1:25:35] can't make you give up yes only you can
[1:25:38] do
[1:25:38] that he can't make you give up I'm so
[1:25:41] glad of
[1:25:46] that he said show me where you can make
[1:25:48] me take the cross off but thanks be to
[1:25:50] God who gives us the victory through our
[1:25:52] Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to address
[1:25:54] this and we'll close the gifts in our
[1:25:56] lives will not operate correctly without
[1:25:58] the
[1:26:00] mainspring Romans 11:29 tells us the
[1:26:02] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:26:03] repentance in other words we had them
[1:26:05] before we were even
[1:26:07] saved right if it's a gift a predestined
[1:26:10] gift and there's other gifts that fall
[1:26:11] among the audience among people but a
[1:26:14] predestined gift or calling of God is
[1:26:16] without repentance but brand said your
[1:26:19] gift of tongues wonderful justification
[1:26:21] by faith wonderful sanctification fine
[1:26:24] speaking in tongues wonderful
[1:26:25] interpretation fine messages from God
[1:26:27] wonderful prophecy fine he said brother
[1:26:30] if it hasn't got no Hub in it what's it
[1:26:32] going to amount to your spokes will get
[1:26:35] across one another they'll cross up all
[1:26:38] those gifts right fuss fight isolate
[1:26:43] Chaw tear on up each one one another you
[1:26:46] said brother Ben but I'm spiritual God
[1:26:48] speaks to me but your maybe your spokes
[1:26:50] got crossed
[1:26:51] up are you with me now I I I I believe
[1:26:54] God speaks to me too but but but I I got
[1:26:56] to be careful to make sure there's love
[1:26:58] there or that gift can actually be a
[1:27:00] hindrance to me even the gift of a
[1:27:03] Preacher because I can use it in the
[1:27:05] wrong way right right it's just I have
[1:27:08] to stay humble to his will I've got to
[1:27:11] let the mainspring control it and so he
[1:27:14] said they'll cross up and fuss and fight
[1:27:16] and isolate and Chaw and tear on up each
[1:27:18] one another that's what's the matter he
[1:27:19] said we need the main spring what good
[1:27:21] does it do to have the little bitty
[1:27:22] Springs the little bitty gadgets in
[1:27:24] there and the winding Springs and the
[1:27:25] alarms and the faces and the big hands
[1:27:27] all this thing if there isn't something
[1:27:28] in there to make it operate listen to me
[1:27:30] love will make the video room operate
[1:27:32] right love will make the piano operate
[1:27:33] right love makes the organ operate right
[1:27:35] love makes the pews operate right love
[1:27:38] will make the Sunday School operate
[1:27:40] right what is it it takes love the
[1:27:42] mainspring The Hub on the
[1:27:45] inside takes the love of God to make
[1:27:48] things operate takes the love of God to
[1:27:49] make your home
[1:27:51] operate what good are all the little
[1:27:53] bitty gadgets what good as our our high
[1:27:55] dollar drum said if it's not for
[1:27:57] love if there's not somebody who loves
[1:27:59] God playing it are you with me now what
[1:28:02] good are any of the instruments what
[1:28:03] good is it if if we don't have the love
[1:28:05] of God what good are deacons and
[1:28:06] trustees in church order if we don't
[1:28:08] have a self-winding
[1:28:10] watch with love at the center of
[1:28:15] it that's good now watch he said the
[1:28:20] love of God God is love unless each one
[1:28:21] of these gifts is put right in the
[1:28:23] center of love it'll become selfish and
[1:28:25] indifferent and pull itself off listen
[1:28:29] brother BR said elect does not persecute
[1:28:32] elect John Wesley uh Martin Luther none
[1:28:36] of them they never pulled themselves off
[1:28:37] from the church they were kicked out
[1:28:39] they never pulled themselves off why
[1:28:42] because that's not the nature of Christ
[1:28:43] the nature of Christ is
[1:28:45] reconciliation but the brandom kept
[1:28:47] going back to the Pentecostal people but
[1:28:48] they closed the
[1:28:49] doors he said when it's anchored right
[1:28:52] in the middle of Love it'll Fellowship
[1:28:54] everywhere yes oh that's the way I want
[1:28:57] to be yes this watch is self-winding
[1:29:00] brother brand in one place calls it God
[1:29:02] winding he said you don't have to wind
[1:29:05] it every day God wound it once for all
[1:29:08] and it set right in the middle of your
[1:29:10] new life as a mainspring as it relieves
[1:29:12] and ticks away the watch it controls
[1:29:14] every little organism of that watch to
[1:29:16] perfect time when the Holy Spirit he
[1:29:18] said not the new degree not the new
[1:29:20] church not the new thought not the new
[1:29:21] emotion not the new oil not the new
[1:29:23] dance not the new lips not the new
[1:29:25] tongue not the new this not the new that
[1:29:27] hat he says but when God places his
[1:29:29] spirit in the middle of your new spirit
[1:29:31] you don't have to act Meek you don't
[1:29:33] have to act like a Christian it controls
[1:29:35] everything that's within you it puts you
[1:29:38] decent makes the church act orderly
[1:29:40] makes the gifts work perfect and if you
[1:29:42] have to be taken from a place oh this
[1:29:44] gets sticky now he said from where you
[1:29:46] think you should be and put down
[1:29:48] somewhere else it controls you huh
[1:29:52] that's when you see people when you have
[1:29:53] to to move people around positions in
[1:29:55] the church you begin to find out who has
[1:29:56] the main spring and I thank God I found
[1:29:59] many of people here have the mainspring
[1:30:01] because we've changed a lot of things
[1:30:03] but the mainspring still holds aren't
[1:30:06] you glad for that I'm so thankful for
[1:30:09] that I can't imagine pastoring a church
[1:30:11] full of a bunch of people with no love
[1:30:12] no Holy Ghost no seal it'd be
[1:30:17] awful I'm glad we got a main
[1:30:19] spring not flopping so in other words
[1:30:22] you take the main spring out there I
[1:30:23] watch just loose you know just go those
[1:30:26] all those gears go any direction he said
[1:30:29] not flopping I'll never come back again
[1:30:30] no sir that shows that main Spring's not
[1:30:33] in there he said when you blow up at
[1:30:34] every little thing that happens watch
[1:30:36] what he says poisons that disposition
[1:30:39] see you you have a disposition a new
[1:30:41] spirit but it's got to have his Spirit
[1:30:43] on the inside or you'll get poisoned by
[1:30:45] things that
[1:30:47] happen he said when the pastor happens
[1:30:49] to hit something that's in the word you
[1:30:51] I can't do it like brother brandom
[1:30:54] I don't believe that he said ' look out
[1:30:56] old cowhide he said that not me said see
[1:31:00] watch out the new main spring hasn't
[1:31:02] been set in there right
[1:31:05] yet oh my I'm closing musicians go ahead
[1:31:08] and come but the brand said the main
[1:31:10] Springs what kept Him when his wife and
[1:31:11] daughter
[1:31:13] died that's tough when you're a a
[1:31:16] preacher especially one who believes in
[1:31:17] Divine
[1:31:18] Healing and you lose your closest loved
[1:31:21] ones to sickness
[1:31:24] right but the main spring held you look
[1:31:26] at the tragedy in brother bram's
[1:31:28] family with his mother and father and
[1:31:30] with his siblings with with his wife and
[1:31:33] his daughter and finally in his own life
[1:31:37] and Pentecostals looked at that and said
[1:31:38] he was
[1:31:40] cursed I say the main spring
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:47] help the devil might be trying to tell
[1:31:49] you you're
[1:31:50] cursed might be trying to tell you that
[1:31:53] if you were a real see to God if you
[1:31:54] were really a Christian things wouldn't
[1:31:55] go the way they they've gone listen all
[1:31:58] that are in Christ Jesus will suffer
[1:32:01] persecution some of you have been
[1:32:03] through some things you've lost some
[1:32:04] loved ones you know what that's
[1:32:07] like but the main spring
[1:32:10] holds The Anchor
[1:32:13] Holds spite of every storm that come
[1:32:16] through he said he stood there and as
[1:32:18] his daughter died and he said it's like
[1:32:19] a black sheep come in between him and
[1:32:21] the devil come to him he said it was too
[1:32:23] late to tell me God wasn't real but he
[1:32:25] tried to tell me he said God don't love
[1:32:27] you don't you realize that devil trying
[1:32:29] to tell you the same thing he's trying
[1:32:31] to tell you God don't love you he's
[1:32:32] trying to tell you the people don't love
[1:32:33] you and it's the devil yeah it's the
[1:32:37] devil and and here here he's standing in
[1:32:41] that place and he says he he said I I
[1:32:44] had to agree with him
[1:32:47] intellectually he said but there was
[1:32:48] something on the
[1:32:50] inside that said though he slay me yet
[1:32:53] I'll TR trust
[1:32:54] him and he give his daughter to God his
[1:32:58] wife to God he said a a state senator
[1:33:00] asked him he talk by the side of the
[1:33:02] road as he was there in the cemetery and
[1:33:03] asked him he said Bill he said what held
[1:33:05] you he said did your religion hold he
[1:33:08] said he said uh did you hold your
[1:33:10] religion he said no I didn't hold my
[1:33:12] religion My Religion held me what was it

[1:33:17] wound on the inside that steel that you
[1:33:20] can't put there he has to put it there
[1:33:24] yes Paul asked the question what can

[1:33:31] nothing
[1:33:33] nothing we are we ought to hear it
[1:33:35] tonight nothing
[1:33:37] yeah nothing can separate what do he say

[1:33:43] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:33:45] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:33:48] nothing in all these things we are more
[1:33:52] than conquerors
