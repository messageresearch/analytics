oh he's a reality Jesus Jus is holding me AR you glad he's holding you tonight and let's bow our heads together Lord as I walked up here I thought how what a privilege it was to be able to come and preach to these people Lord who Lord I I believe that love you with all of their heart Lord I believe they're the purchase of your blood and I thank you for holding them Lord and for holding me Lord what would we do without you we could do nothing Lord and so we're thankful for your grace thankful for your mercy we want to express that to you in every way that we possibly can I pray you'd help us tonight to to learn from your word to or to just dig in and and receive something we know Lord that what you have spoken is true and we just want to say Amen to it tonight and believe it of our heart and I trust you'd move me out of the way and Speak Lord somehow to some situation of this service speak through your word heal the sick touch those that are in need or watching Lord and unable to be here pray bless him tonight thank you for it in Jesus name amen thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus uh 2 Chronicles 26 go to 2 Chronicles 26:21 and then Matthew 19:22 and I want to take two uh sermons that brother Brandon preached and tie them together tonight and know it won't be double length so don't be afraid but 2 Chronicles 26 I want to speak to you on influence and Leadership influence and Leadership and uh trust it'll be a blessing to you I don't want to uh keep you long tonight so we'll just try to get through it as quickly as we can uh how many you ready to learn from the word and hear the word I just have to be myself I'm not uh uh I wish I was Andrew Glover I wish I was Joel puit but uh but I'm just myself and so we'll just try to preach and but I feel so comfortable tonight and thank you for making the church that way and we want to all be able to sit here and just enjoy the presence of the Lord and and be able to worship God according to the dictates of our heart and so thank you for being here and making it a church like that you do that and I want to thank you for that 2 Chronicles 2621 Uzziah the King was a leper until the day of his death and dwelt D in a several house or a separate house being a leper where he was cut off from the house of the Lord and jotham his son was over the King's house judging the people of the land it's kind of a sobering uh text then in Matthew 1922 another sobering text says in speaking of the Rich Young Ruler but when the young man heard that saying and this is where Jesus told him tell all you have pick up your cross and follow me he said when he heard that saying he went away sorrowful where he had great possessions pray the Lord would bless his reading of the word the reading of the word you may be seated when a man named John Getty arrived in the island of an I am in 1848 the the natives wor no clothes practiced cannibalism in fanticide worshiped Idols when he left 24 years later they put a a plaque up and placed it behind the pulpit of the church that they built there and they said when he landed in 1848 there were no Christians here when he left in 1872 there were no Heathen that's influence good that's influence and I think sometimes we unell the amount of influence we have on other people because we think think that you know well my life hasn't meant much and I haven't you know maybe I'm not a preacher maybe you're not you're not a uh even a Sunday school teacher or something like that you say well I don't have any influence but you do have influence Beyond even your own life in fact the brandom many times would pray and you'd say Lord May our influence go beyond he said even our Lives May it outlive us and and that would be something that we would want now we want to influence people in the right way and so there's influence and there's leadership and it's nice when those two things come together right when influence and leadership are together because you can be in a position of of leadership and not have the influence that you should have for many reasons we want to be if we are in a position of leadership and we are all a leader to somebody in some way and so we want to have the right kind of influence if we're going to be in a position of leadership to be able to influence people so they ties these two together and you'll find that brandom deals with influence in the story of Uzziah he deals and and Isaiah and he deals with the Rich Young Ruler and the story of leadership and then he ties those two together now the the sermon on leadership he preaches to young people and the sermon on influence he's dealing more with uh people in positions and and and preachers and things like that but again I believe the two are tied together and when he deals with leadership the point of the leadership service is that you're going to reach a point where men can't lead you anymore and you got to be led by God God not that you wouldn't be led by a man but but that men can only take you so far so in other words he said when these men died they went beyond uh Earthly leadership and the only one that can give you eternal life is Jesus Christ that's it no human leadership no human ability can give you eternal life your parents can't give it to you your your pastor can't give it to you only Jesus Christ can do that and so if you listen to that and I encourage you to do that you young people you want something to do or something to listen to Listen to influence and listen to leadership brother Brandon preaches both those sermons multiple times now again they're tied together because the leadership in your life is what you're influenced by you can't have one really without the other an effective leader has got to have influence to lead by yeah but sometimes and I know all of you are thinking of some situation where you've had a you've seen somebody in a position of leadership but not a position of influence yeah sure or maybe they would influence somebody wrong but but maybe they just didn't have the influence take I was in a position in a title company here not long ago and and uh I had gotten our title company had gotten bought out by another title company and so I ended up working at Brill title in West Plains and the lady that was there is retired in fact it's changed hands again someone else has bought it out so I'm not speaking telling tales on people uh that are still there but uh I worked for bril title company compan and there was a man who come in a young man who come out of the uh property and casual insurance field and I'm going somewhere with this just just hang with me for a minute but he come out of the property and casually influence or Insurance field and he was become the president of the company he made up cards said president of Brill Title Company he knew nothing about title work nothing about title work but he he he said I've been to school he went to missou he graduated with a business degree business management you know nothing about title work now we had a a 78 or 80-year-old woman I think there in the office named Margaret and Margaret was uh a little bit of a title Savant and in fact I found out later she'd actually owned the company at one time and sold it to a bank made a lot of money and just stayed there because she liked it so she was an employee she had a she didn't have any title at all just an employee but I found out if you wanted if you wanted something done or wanted to know something talk to Margaret because she was a Fountain of Knowledge she'd done it for 50 years and she had a tremendous influence on me as a young person doing title she had a tremendous influence on me because she had she had experience she had everything that it would take to be the leader of a title company and this young man didn't have any of that and so I I you know he' tell us stuff and we just sit there nod at him and then we go do what we were going to do and and we don't want want that do we whatever leadership you have in your life you want you want to have some influence with that you want to be it needs to be to Be an Effective leader you've got to have influence now we don't want just titles you don't want to just be a dad you don't want to just be a father and say you people respect me I don't want to just be a pastor and and say well people demand respect there is a a certain amount of respect that goes with the office but you want the influence that that that that causes people to have respect you want to live in such a way that people would respect you and this is the age of what we call influencers an influencer is one who exerts influence a person who inspires or guides the actions of others and especially today in getting you to buy something right influencers are always trying to get you to buy something and we kind of got them around the message too but but but but in the in the in the world in the secular World there always got something they want you to buy they you don't even realize it you're you're scrolling through videos on Tik Tok I know of you people do that but or Instagram say or Facebook and you're on reals you're scrolling through there and and you say oh that's that's a that's a cute video you know and they make that video and they're doing something in their kitchen or something they're selling you something right they're that person just happens to always be at Sam's Club right or they're always they're always at the theme park they're always what are they doing they're influencing you and they always have a good time I I I yeah followed this person one time on on on social Med media that was in Branson and they were always uh I thought well they'll give a good re or you know idea where to go and what to do in Branson well the thing is she was always positive that's the best restaurant I've ever eaten at that's the best place I've ever been that's the most fun you can have in Branson it's was like well there's a reason for that she getting paid to do that right but they would influence that and the truth is if somebody tells you that you you begin to believe it right if you listen to it enough and and I want to challenge you tonight and I'm I'm trying not to make this boring but I feel it's on my heart so I want to get it across to us I want you and if you if you take notes I want you to write this down I want you to write this down and it'll go right under your picture right there that you're drawing who am I leading who am I leading while you're writing that down I I remember a man that used to take notes he was a preacher he sat on a platform and uh my father-in-law told me this story he said he said I always wondered because he was always keeping just deep detailed notes he just sitting there just just detailed notes every time preacher would preach and he said I one time he left his notebook up there and went up there and looked he had pictures of horses he was drawing on the platform so it's not just kids that do that who am I leading and then turn it this way who is leading me right and then who am I influencing and who is influencing me so who am I leading who is leading me who am I influencing who is influencing me and I think the answers might surprise us you kids if you ever see a turtle on a fence post what do you know about that Turtle right if you see a turtle on a fence post he did not get on the fence post by himself somebody put him up there if you're going to make it in life if you're going to do anything in life that goes for all of us somebody's got to put you on a fence post you you are a product of your influence you're a product of people that have influenced you and and and that have helped you and that have led you and so there's got to be now brother Brandon puts it this way he said somebody helped you when you made your first step right when you made your first step somebody helped you and your last step you ever make in life somebody will be leading you right so he said that's right I want you to remember that your first step somebody LED you and your last step somebody will be leading you we have to be led he said you know God likened us un sheep and you know a sheep can't lead itself he'll wander away and stray away and he just can't lead himself and he has to have somebody to lead him and the shepherd is supposed to lead the Sheep he said now that was back in the days of the Lord Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that led the Sheep but today you see we're living in another day everything is changed and perverted he said you know what man has to lead sheep today a goat and we were actually talking about this and the brothers didn't realize I had this in my notse we were talking about this during lunch they will actually take a goat and the Goat will will brother Joel's experienced it where he's seen the goat actually lead the Sheep up into the trailer to go to slaughter because the Sheep don't are not somebody said they're not curious and that that makes sense and they just they want they huddle together they'll just stay back but a goat will just lead them right up there and so brother B so what we have today is goats leading the Sheep to slaughter he said them sheep don't know where they're going so the goat goes up a pin up at the solder the Sheep don't know more no more than to follow a leader so it leads them right up into this Slaughter and the Goat jumps over the track and the sheep goes in gets killed see the goat a wrong leader but Jesus the Good Shepherd how many how many want to follow the Good Shepherd today Jesus the Good Shepherd who led the Sheep had he led them to life and held their hand he said but somebody has to lead the Sheep somebody has to lead the Sheep so brother brandom has a list of four leaders he said in the message leadership he said there's mother he said and then father he said and then teacher right so that's a big position isn't it you people that are teachers that's a big deal right and and many of you are parents that teach your children that's a big deal mother father teacher and then he said Jesus right mother father teacher Jesus Jesus it doesn't mean that other leaders cuz he said you'll be led all through your life right but this is the point he was trying to get to these young people these kids is that and and if you go back and study where brother Brandon was saying that in Prescott Arizona he's telling people in a caught in a bad situation that one day you may have to look beyond your current leadership and look to Christ you you may have to look to Christ and and and we want you to look to Christ because every other leadership can fail but he'll never fail you and he's the only one that can give you eternal life but it doesn't mean we'll reject other leaders or other influence but that we will follow leadership as they follow him so Paul puts it this way and I just want to do a little bible study for a minute we'll just look at it run through it real quickly 1 Corinthians 4 uh 14 says I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have you not many fathers in Christ Jesus have begotten you through the gospel wherefore I beseech you what did he say be ye followers of me that's a pretty strong statement but it's all through the New Testament Paul says be followers of me for this cause have I sent unto you timotheus now for what cause to make you followers of Paul he said I'm going to send you another preacher right to help you follow what I've taught you more closely that's the same thing brother brandom said Faithful Men will go out from the messenger and teach others to be faithful as well for this cause have I sent un you timotheus who was my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ you think well Paul you know if you if you just put in a vacuum and you don't know who Paul is you think he's being awful arrogant right but he's a messenger to the age he was the pattern for ages to come and so he's using his influence you see that he's using his influence he has messenger of the age to promote the leadership of Timothy yeah but he said follow me he said and then I'm going to send Timothy to you to remind you of my ways 1 Corinthians 11 uh he again he says be followers of me even as I also am of Christ see there's the key follow people who follow Christ if someone let me let me challenge you young people for a minute if someone just because someone in your POS in a position of leadership does something doesn't mean it's right right follow them as they follow Christ so you got to know the word well enough that you know when they get off of the word right follow them as they follow Christ it doesn't mean you question every decision and let me say this there's things that uh there's things a parent will deal with that it's not written in the word but they're just dealing with things and that's their job right to tell you to pick up your clothes we'll get to that in just a minute that's their job tell you clean your room right that's their job to do that but there things a pastor does that's like that that you just that that that you just got to take care of that's what they're that's what they're there for and I don't think we should question every decision like that but if they get off the word don't stay with them right and and and pray that God brings them back to the word right right so that's we have to follow Christ we must follow Christ he said now so be followers of me he said I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things right he said and keep ordinances is I delivered them to you and so when we talk about Brother brandham people don't understand that all the time see you're always saying brother brandham said brother brandham said why he was the Paul to this generation right he said follow me as I follow Christ and the ordinances the way that I set up the gifts and the way that I did this the way I told you to have church do that why because it works because it's the thoughts of God to Our Generation all right right he says I I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ now look where he's going with this he said follow me follow me but he said now here's the lead here's the headship the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God now he goes on to say and you know what that chapter is he deals with women cutting their hair right and he says if she cuts her hair she dishonors her head which is her husband but and and and so what is he doing now look at the the headship it's head of her man is Christ the head of the woman is the man the head of Christ is God and that doesn't mean a woman who is a woman who's not married is not without headship see she she got to submit to the headship of leadership of some kind she needs the influence of Godly men but can I take that a step further a man needs the influence of Godly men right you you need the influence of somebody but don't take influen that's wrong take influence that's right you need influence you need friends you need people to lean on you need somebody but just take what's right don't take the wrong take the right you need men and I'm thankful I'm just trying to be a a pastor tonight if you can say it that way but I'm thankful for Godly men that have led in this church in the right direction I I'm thankful for men like Danny Ward I'm thankful for men just throw a name out there brother Danny but I'm thankful for men who lead I'm thankful for some of you who have been here a long time brother Bill and Brother David and now we got brother Harvey with us and different ones brother JT was a leader for many years in the church at brandville you guys I'm thankful for you because of your influence we're able to do what we do today but us young people we got to pick that up and be leaders and sometimes leadership looks like cleaning up junk at the fellowship hall but it's just the way it is right somebody's got to do it somebody's got to step in and be that guy and let me be that and you say well I'm not that kind of leader but you're a leader somewhere in some way all of us are yeah I'm thankful for that leadership and so we all need the leadership of of men if we can say it that way God put men male leadership in the church we all need the leadership of men but we can't let that supplant the leadership of Christ he's the head of the man right and the man is the head of the woman Christ is the head of the church look and so a man who thinks he's above leadership will fall 100 times out of a 100 if he's got nobody to listen to he's going to fall if there's nobody that can tell him no all right there you need somebody in your life that can look at you and say that's not a good idea and you won't leave them right you won't get mad at them right somebody needs to be able to tell you that if there's nobody that can tell you that you don't have any leadership you got to have it and we all God does that for us he does that for us so a a man must lead in the right way in 1 Peter 3:7 he tells husbands I'm not preaching on husbands and wives tonight just fits in here uh husbands dwell with them according to knowledge so in other words he's telling you if you're going to lead your wife lead her with knowledge with knowledge what does that mean giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being HS together the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so he's saying be smart about it think about it huh think about it it lead your home by the influence of your life see and and I talk to us men for a minute if we don't put any thought into our marriage relationship our prayers will be ineffective you got to put thought into that you got to in other words you got to do that purposefully the Bible says a wife should reverence her husband how many believe that what the Bible says but that means he has to influence her in that way right right brother brandom says this a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God yes and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him now that doesn't excuse her but it does give us a reason yeah right why she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of when is a man that is reverent man that's the kind of man I want to be I want to be a reverent man I want to be a man who lives his life with reverence not not blows off the uh steam all the time and gets mad and and and uh loses my my temper all the time and people are scared to bring something up I don't want to be that I want to be a reverent man I don't want to be a man that's involved in every little thing in the world let me be a reverent man who doesn't try to hide and be somebody different home than I am at church let me be a reverent man how many men can say Amen to that tonight Reverend and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God he said then the women children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence Paul again says Brethren be followers together of me that's pretty Stark isn't it Mark them which walk so as again Watch what he says he said so so make a a distinction mark them which walk so as you have us for an example so in other words we set the example if you see people doing things like we did them look at that person and say hey there's a follower of Paul and follow that man he said for many walk of whom I've have told you often and I'll tell you even weeping that they're the enemies of the Cross of Christ just because they say they believe the message don't make them a good leader don't make them a good influence who's end is destruction whose God is their belly whose glory is their shame who God is their belly what that means is they just want what's good for them they they just want to Feast on the good on on the money they just want to Feast on uh who's God is their belly doesn't mean they're fat brother jooli the bellies worth the desire can I have to explain everything to you are yall with me tonight so whose God is just means their desires their desire just follow every whim whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly things Paul was the pattern for us he led by influence listen what brother BR said about him he said his manner of ministering set the pattern all someone say all future Messengers were to Aspire to and actually sets the patter pattern for every true minister of God he would not attain to such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul he said Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality and I'll just run through those there's more to this quote if you want to go read it yourself but this is what he said those three qualities were first of all Paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated from it no matter what the cost again he said secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word thirdly he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry so someone says well I have a Ministry but there's no fruit of it that's a problem right the ministry will produce fruit and it's not that it's not that I would have fruit or brother Joel would have fruit but if we're faithful to our post of Duty God will produce fruit right that Ministry so brother brandom is is dealing with his church on Church order and are youall still with me tonight I'm getting through this pretty quick but he's dealing with his church on Church order he said forgive me if I try to take the place of a boss I'm no boss but I feel to you like Paul said back about his congregation you're the stars in my crown when I cross over the land over on the other side Yonder and meet you in that glorified condition I want you to stand there to shine like the stars in my crown I want you to be there he said I want to be there and I remember he said in my vision when I seen the presence of the Lord or his people in that glorious land Yonder I looked around and I told them and they told me he would judge me first by the gospel that I preach I said just exactly the way Paul preached and then millions of people screamed out we're resting on that how many are we still resting on that tonight sir he saw us there we're resting on that he said no I want it to be so and we're going to meet there someday and God never sent brother Neville and I to be bosses not at all we're just your brothers instructors in the gospel so let's all work together I've had people ask me say brother Ben what kind you know would you would you be able to tell me what kind of car I ought to buy or what kind of house I sure I'll tell you but it may not be right I like Fords I've had terrible luck with Fords you know I like Fords but my car is always in the shop I may not be the best person to ask it's been in the shop for months and we just got it back out we hit a deer it took us two months to get it back but but see I I'm not always a a good judge of those things but what do I deal with I deal with the word that's what I deal with you want a question about that and now I can have a little more Authority right a little more Authority because that but where do my authority come from from the message of the age from my headship because as a local Pastor I'm under one Messenger to the age I'm not under any other pastor but I'm under a Messer and he was under Christ right and I have confidence in the messenger and I've Got Confidence in Christ the word and I've Got Confidence in the Bible I've Got Confidence in pastors today I believe God called them for a reason right and that's leadership that's what God calls but Lord help us to have the right kind of influence with our leadership God didn't send us to be boss but to be instructors he say so let's all work together what kind of people should have influence in leadership in our lives think about this because I ask you who who do I lead who leads me who do I influence who influences me well the first place God's gifts should have a position of leadership in our lives they are gifts to us Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers he gave those are predestined foraine gifts that God placed in the church and God put them there and then you say well I don't have confidence in the gift that that's in my church when you ought to go somewhere we have confidence in them yeah right right and I'm not saying that to be mean it's just the truth you've got to have confidence in the gift that realizing they're human and sometimes they'll say what bird's eye is and it's the wrong thing or something like that sometimes they don't know what they're talking about but but but but they stay they try to stay with the word right they're human beings but they try to stay with the word that's a gift right and we believe in God's gifts we still believe in the five-fold ministry here right as long as I'm here I'm going to try to preach Paul says as long as I'm in this body I'm declare to you the word of the Lord that's the pattern that we have so he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists pastors teachers for for the perfecting of the Saints for the maturity of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and cunning craftiness where by the lineweight deceived that's why we need leadership because there's winds blowing right and we weren't meant to respond to all that by ourselves God give us leadership right that's why sometimes leader will say something what is he preaching about that for well there's the wind blowing maybe you don't know about it but it's there right and so he's responding to that maybe he don't even know about it but it's the gift right but now look but but he said speaking the truth in love that's the key and grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint suppli every joint that's all of us he said according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love brother BR says now God fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors he protects himself with the ministry right he said what was God doing listen did you ever think what the offices of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seir foreseeing it before Satan ever gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelist what is that that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man he said but now watch where he takes this because leadership can only take you so far you need to know the word and not just have a head knowledge of the word you need to you need to have the word in your heart the Holy Ghost living in you because he said if that office denies any of this word it's not God's dressing right I don't mean that they'll be they'll know everything yes but it means they don't deny the word right he said he said no he said that's a wolf and sheep's clothing watch that fellow beware of him when he just takes what the word says remember that's God because he's speaking his word if he says well it isn't oh he said oh oh my get going sheep yeah all right get going we got to have confidence what we're being fed or we might you know there's no point in it and and and I want to address this and and we'll move on but and I want you young people to understand you're not bound to a pastor for life because if if I'm the only one that represents Christ to you I believe your parents should represent that I believe the elders in the church should represent that because God may call me off the scene then what do you do right I'm here for a season all of us are because if I get to be the age of 105 I probably won't be here whether the Rapture happened or not right I mean that's that's just the truth I'm looking for a body change but if I live that long I probably won't be here I'm here for a season and and so you got to have confidence in the word that he'll give you good leadership you're not bound to a pastor for life I'm not your husband yeah Christ is your Christ is your husband we ought to believe that church you don't divorce you know by leaving me you don't divorce Christ right we don't have to get a divorce for you to go some some other church right don't don't brother BR said don't put your confidence in a man right he said when that man leaves the word of God you leave the man right he you leave the man stay with God God is the word yeah God is the word you say brother Ben why would you say that don't don't that make you nervous say that no because I believe I stay with the word with all of my heart and if I was a charlatan if I was a wolf if I was preaching false Doctrine I'd want people to leave right because I I want to be open and honest about that God I don't want to be a a nickol brother brand called a nickan someone who conquers the Le that's the Greek word to conquer the Le nicolan and but but yet we have to use Authority yes right God uses Authority but it doesn't mean he's a nickol Anon he uses headship but it doesn't mean he's a nickol niolon is to conquer the Ley Le have no voice and Le have no worship and the Le have no ability uh you know to to do anything unless the man tells them what to do but that's not who we we are at all we're the word bride of Jesus Christ sir we're each one supposed to represent the word yes uh but in mark 1:22 it tells us that that they were astonished at Jesus Doctrine because he preached like he taught like one that had Authority he didn't say it like it well it could be this way and it could be that way he spoke as one with authority in 1 Peter 4:11 Peter says if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God means that an oracle was something that uh in in idolatry it was something that the idol would speak through that that image he said so if any man speak let him speak as if it's God speaking through his flesh let him speak as if it's God's word yes if any man Minister let him do it as the ability to whom which God giveth listen and I'm hurrying through this so we don't uh but some of it I think we ought to dwell on a little bit but I'm hurrying through it so we don't get bored this afternoon or get tired but he said he's placed his church in the care of God ordained Spirit-filled word living men let me be one of those men may each one of us I think as as husbands as Fathers as leadership we ought to say that let me be a word living man who lead the people through feeding them the word that's how we lead yes he has not separated the people into classes so the masss are led by a holy priesthood it is true the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation there's no place in the word where preach or ministers or such mediate between God and the people or is there a place where they're separated and the worship with the Lord God wants all to love and serve him together together do you want to serve him together and love him with all of your heart you don't have to come through me to pray right right I want you to ask me ask for prayer because that makes me feel good makes me feel like you got confidence in me but I'm not the mediator between you and God there's one man there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus and that's it but there is a pastor somewhere who'll feed and Shepherd you I want to be that kind of Pastor but there's one for you if you're a child of God and I believe you are all of you with all my heart listen Peter exhorted the elders in 1 Peter 5 1-3 he says I exhort you as an elder feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly and and and that that you can take that two ways you say don't don't constrain them to follow you but it also quite literally means don't have you don't have to be constrained to do it no one's forcing you to preach not for filthy lucer in other words not for money but of a ready mind yes not being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock yes being examples who should lead and have influence your parents should lead and have influence how many young people how many kids up here on the front can say I believe my parents should have influence on me some of you you can raise your hand be proud it's all right some of them like you don't know my parents you parents should have influence Proverbs 23:22 hearken unto thy father that begat thee despise not thy mother when she is old Mom Mom's like amen I don't know whether that's her calling herself old or or me needing to be more respectful to my mother Proverbs 13:1 a wise son hears his father's inst instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke all right yeah Ephesians 61 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right this is right when does that obligation end well you know I'll say this the world sets the age of 18 but God never set that age I'll say this I told my kids long as I'm long as I'm paying your light bill looks like that may be a while yet providing you Wheels you obey your parents but an influence like again that's not a demanded thing you can only demand that for so long and they'll leave yeah but if you influence them in such a way that they say Dad I need your I need your help with this that's what I want I want my kids to be able to come to me because I want to have influence not just leadership not just control not because not just a position but influence of my children he said honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with promise may be well with you now may us live long on the earth do you you want to live you kids want to live as long as brother Bill yes huh you want to live as long as brother Bill Curtis and sister Karen honor your father and mother they must have really treated their parents well that's what it says if you honor your father and mother you'll live a long life that's a pretty good pretty good deal I think but we'll influence our children I want to talk to you parents just to say this we want to be the right kind of influence we we want to be a mother like Timothy's mother if you're a mother you want to be a mother like Timothy's mother not like herodias who give her baggage to her children right right but but like Timothy's mother who taught her children the Bible yes to have confidence in it right and so Timothy could follow Paul because his mother taught him to have confidence in the scriptures right and and so we ought to be able we should influence our children to have confidence in the men of God and to have confidence in people of God we should influence them in that way Elders should have influence the Bible says Thou shalt rise up before the Hy head what that means is you should stand up before the gray-headed person that's what that means I sh rise up in other words be respectful to those who've lived a few years y huh honor the face of the old man and fear thy God I am the Lord Proverbs 16:31 the Hy head or the gry head is a Crown of Glory if it be found in the way of righteousness yes because old folks aren't always right now they do always deserve our respect they're not always right and job 32:7 job uh this is uh elu I believe it was that was speaking here cuz he waited till job's comforters got done speaking all their stuff and he said I said days should speak multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty gives them understanding old people are not always right but they always deserve respect I'm coming down to a close brother Bram used the example of the Rich Young Ruler whose parents taught him to make money and be moral but not to follow Jesus and he refused the ultimate leadership of the word influence of the word wasn't strong enough to overcome his desire for money and things Uzziah the example he gives there of influence was a little different he was taught correctly by Godly Parents he was a friend of prophets a mentor of the young prophet Isaiah but he tried to use influence to change his position of leadership yes he had a great position of leadership but he tried to take the influence he had in that position and make him something that he wasn't right right you know you can't make yourself something that you're not right right we don't we you can't if you're a mother and you got a great position of influence but you'll never be a preacher right and this age tries to mix that and we can't do that we need to stay in our lane we need to stay where God called us to be see Uzziah was a military genius a financial success a good administrator he wanted to be a preacher yeah he had great influence but he got to a place where he could not be led the Bible says he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father amiah did he sought God excuse me in the days of Zachariah understanding the visions of God he was a friend of multiple Major Prophets and as long as he sought the Lord God made him to prosper and and then go down to verse 15 said he made him Jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers upon the bworks to shoot arrows and great stones with all and his name spread far abroad and he was marvelously helped till he was strong but when he was strong oh church we want to be strong but we we don't want to think like that when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his Destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and Azariah the priest went in after him and with him four score Priests of the Lord that were Valiant men and they with stod Uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn incense unto the Lord they said this is not your place I say they were good men yes right who are doing their job to keep businessmen out of the pulpit yes all right right to keep people from from doing that listen we don't have to do that why would you want to to brother Joel told me earlier he said why can't I just run sound you know sometimes you people think they want a position but it's not all it's cracked up to be there's a lot of hardship there a lot of struggle there why would we want to go out of our our position and be something God has not called us to be we don't need to correct anybody else if God's not called us to do that let's just be what we are but God called these priests to correct a king but he wouldn't listen to it because he had too much influence too much so what does he do he he goes in and he gets angry he says then Uzziah was wroth and he had a sensor in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priest leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priest in the house of the Lord from beside the incence altar you talk about going down different than you come up he he he went out of that Temple a lot different with a lot different attitude than he came in but he never recovered he tried to take a place didn't belong to him I Lord I just want to be be where you called me to be I'm afraid of trying to be something that I'm not while he was angry with the people who trying to save him from himself he got leprosy leadership matters yes influence matters yes come a time when the Rich Young Ruler wish she'd followed Jesus and accepted the leadership of the word but he lifted up his eyes in hell and saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom yeah what brother brandom said right but and in Uzziah you find him how he spent the rest of his life Life as a leper year after year unable to help his people unable to sit on his throne but brother bam used the example of Moses he said Moses chose to follow Christ yes he chose to give up everything to follow Christ and what did he do because he accepted the leadership of Christ he was picked up by Angels when he died amen it was a huge blow to Isaiah the young Prophet when Uzziah died because Uzziah had such tremendous influence Isaiah 61 says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple Uzziah may have been banned from his Earthly throne but Jehovah was still on the throne of heaven and I want to tell you leadership May Fail but God don't fail and Isaiah realized this influence has SP in my life of a king he was a Godly King but he went wrong but but because he went wrong don't mean God went wrong right God's still for me yes amen yes God still loves me he's still on his throne he can still take care of me do you believe that tonight he can still meet my need why Isaiah submitted himself to the kingship of Jehovah he said Lord here I am send me influence was from heaven let me read this then we close brother BR said when you're playing a ball game as it's football season I was listen to the guys yesterday talk about football I thought yeah it's about that time of year as it's football season brother B said the thing we want to do is not everybody trying to take the ball away from the man that's got it yeah he's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal I like way he said that brother BR we're trying to make a goal a touchdown we're trying to score a goal we're trying to make a touchdown could you imagine a team he had so untrained as to find one man their own man with the ball running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the he's running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team he said to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it he said every man trying to take the ball out of his hand well you're bound to lose you imagine a football team I mean you're all standing up there and you guys you play football don't you started playing football can you imagine if you all lined up and them guys are looking at you them big old 300 lb linemen you know and they're like this and soon as that ball snapped here they go so what are you tackling me for well I wanted the ball you always get the ball well that's cuz you can't run when you're built like me you don't run with the ball you you you block for the runner right come on we're not all built the same spiritually and most of us are blockers there's 11 guys I think is that right 11 guys on a football team on one side there's 11 guys out there but Gabe is that right 11 guys on the football team Gabe teaches football coaches football sometimes and there's 11 guys on a football team and them guys none of them but one of them has the ball and he might throw it to one other one and then what happens if he throws it to one other one especially if he makes the interception then he becomes a blocker right and some times interceptions they they' saved touchdowns because the quarterback tackled somebody right because we're all on the same team oh Church look what team are we on he said he said he said you're bound to lose today we have the same thing when we see God come on the scene going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's use our influences our influences we all have an influence let me tell you when you get a 300 lb defensive tackle in your face that's an influence right that's an influence he's influencing the game he said let's use our influence as a tackle all right yes oh Church sir not Runners tackles could I could I could I be honest with you I feel like my position is not carrying the ball in this age it's a tackle right because we had a prophet who came and brought us a message and my position is to tackle for him tackle for the message let me let me be the very best I can be let me spend all the time in the waight room I can spend let me do the very best I can do to make sure that I'm blocking for the message and he said tackles let her let's use our influence as tackles not Runners tackles that protects the runner let's impact the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running why is there no opposition because we've taken opposition out of the way I think whoever's in this Pulpit everybody else here is a tackle right right whoever don't matter if it's me or brother Joel or somebody else when I'm sitting there I'm a tackle right it's not my job to carry the ball that night but it's my job to say Amen brother get that devil out of the way let me be a tackle let me be somebody who moves people moves Spirits aside for the for the work of the Lord we're all on the same team let's not attack one another let's tackle the devil so let's use our influence as tackles not Runners tackles that protects the runner let's impact the ball through because there's no opposition all he has to do is just keep running we should be tackles he talked about the Full Gospel businessmen how they put businessmen in the Pulpit he said those businessmen are trying to preach the gospel he's out of his place we preachers have a hard enough time to keep it level use every little influence they can find every little technique this way and that way keep it so scrupled up you don't know what to do we don't run the church like a network marketing program we don't run it like a business why and that don't mean we can't apply business techniques in the sense of we we want to make sure we keep money in the bank we want to keep sure we make sure we do those things but but we don't run it we don't think like businessmen because many times you said in a church a little church can have a revival going on someone don't want to go out there and lead a prayer meeting you said and then you got a different idea from what really the Bible says but he believes it this way anyhow he'll star to influence and draw others away from it think to do how many want to know what to do I'm closing the thing to do is protect this message let's protect we given our lives to it brother Bruce you talking about being in the meeting there all the year we given our lives to it might as well protect it yes might as well block for it brother JT how many years we spend just just just just working working working working what for this message might as well might as well block for it huh might as well block for it oh my protect the message how do you protect it by living a Godly life by going to church by supporting the ministry by by by by making your life where there's no mark on it by living above sin by doing the things you can do you think well I failed well do it better tomorrow I don't mean you're out of the game and just you might you might have missed a tackle but tackle the next one you don't want to lay down imagine if you missed a tackle and just laid down the rest of the game you want to do that keep tackling you say well I don't do anything in the church you're still a part of the team you ever you ever seen a fullback run the ball very few times said why does the that's a good question why does the halfback run the ball not the fullback don't make any sense but some of y'all know football can tell me that but but he fullback hardly ever he just blocks but what what is he he's in a position to block and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make the team win he says the thing to do is protect the message stay right with it and knock everything away from it if we're ever going to cross the go line musicians go ahead and come I want to ask us tonight Who's leading you who are you influenced by Let It Be the message of the hour that should be the very first one on your list who's influencing me Christ Christ who's leading me Christ you young people

be here today but they were sick I I pray you'd reach out where they're at tonight and give them that that Healing Touch Lord I pray you'd bless these Lord say go through their week maybe they'll be opposition but Lord may they realize they're not just blocking against Devils for no reason but the reason they run up against Devils is they're blocking for the message of the hour I pray you'd Grant
