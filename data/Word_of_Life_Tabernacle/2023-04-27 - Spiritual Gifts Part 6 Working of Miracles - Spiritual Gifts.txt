you for your constant presence with us Lord when there's so many times we don't acknowledge it but Lord tonight we want to and we just want to take these moments set them aside and let you take the preeminence in our lives and in this service I pray you bind every spirit that would be unlike you Lord every bit of carnality in me Lord that that would try to go my own way I pray that you'd find that tonight and speak directly to your people tonight those that are here those that are watching oh God me me just track a Revival of the word in our hearts tonight it means something to us Lord and we not just take it as another service but Lord may it be a reality in our lives you are a god of Miracles or we believe that tonight more than may you work miracles in the congregation Among Us Lord we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for every need Lord we believe that you'll meet those needs that were represented uplifted hand we pray and we ask in Jesus name [Music] First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 8 we'll read down through verse 11. I want to get back on a gift tonight and I want to speak to you tonight on the working of Miracles I enjoyed those specials so much and uh all of them and the bill I hadn't heard that song in a long time are you afraid to die but I've got good words if you go to that third verse and and uh really good words and we all need to take account of that especially in the day and hour we live in is coming is near and we don't have much time left we want to serve him with all of our hearts don't we and I think you know we don't we're not afraid to die because all of our hope is in Jesus and we're going to make it through so I thought that went together really well this Saturday we'll have a work day here at the church for whoever we won't set any certain time I don't guess we'll probably I'll probably be up here by 8 o'clock or so in the morning and the brother Harvey and some of the rest of them that'll help the trustees and different ones that are able to be here I know not everybody can be here on a Saturday but if you want to pitch in if you that's a desire in your heart to do that come on a different day and and we'll let you in and let you help but there's just some things that need to be done it's easier with more hands so I appreciate you helping us with that again First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse eight let's just get right on the word tonight night for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated the word Miracles that Paul uses is Dynamics which is a power a deed of power it literally describes the ability to perform an activity by extension it refers to someone in a position of power for the force of a person's uh person's action and so the action the person that we're talking about is the person of Jesus Christ and he is the worker of Miracles how many believe that tonight he is the worker of Miracles and so he is the one who has the uh who is The Giver of the gift to perform Miracles now the random differentiates this from Divine Healing he said you know many of you gets the wrong conception of Divine Healing he said now this is not a gift to perform Miracles Miracles is a separate and different gift from healing he said the Bible said do all have the gift of healing to all have the gift of Miracles see but Miracles are performed he said that's right it's a miracle every time he said somebody a vision that happens and tells people what's wrong with them he said that's a miracle It's Supernatural so any Supernatural event without explanation that is a miracle if I can tell some of you haven't found your seats yet that is a miracle I just love changing the seats up it's a miracle every time somebody a vision happens and tells people what's wrong with them that's a miracle It's Supernatural and we don't think about it like that but that what was working in brother Brown's life could be classified as a miracle because it's supernatural it's beyond explanation and so the difference in healing in America would be a healing God uh uses doctors to heal he uses medicine to heal he uses Divine Healing by laying on of hands that's your faith when when hands are laid on you if you go and listen to the message perfect faith brother Branham teaches us in there how to have hands laid on us and and how we should expect God to meet that need but that's healing right and yet God does Miracles as well where a cancer can be removed like that or a crippled person would stand up and walk that's a miracle that's beyond any kind of of understanding of human beings and I'll tell you this we need miracles in our church we mean miracle in our lives we need to believe in miracles we need to believe in miracles because there's going to be moments in your life when you need a supernatural God when when the natural doesn't work anymore when the theology doesn't work anymore when the psychology doesn't work anymore when you've gone as as far on the tree of knowledge as you can go you need to step over onto the tree of life and let Miracles take place in your life we need miracles amen it's somebody something beyond your comprehension if you look behind me there's a cross and I didn't intend to use it as an illustration tonight but isn't that wonderful brother brother Mark made that cross to me that's a miracle because it's beyond my ability to do right it's beyond my comprehension if I made one it wouldn't look like that so there's a superior intelligence that put it together and are you with me now a superior ability to work with wood listen to making this Pulpit took a superior ability to work with wood a superior intelligence I can't do that and so I have to I have to let someone do that for me that's the god that we serve today there's things in your life that you need somebody to step in and perform a miracle and that's God how many needs him tonight how many know that you need him tonight you need Miracles when counseling can only go so far when when a pastor's uh wisdom can only go so far right when your brother your sister can only say so much to help you you need a miracle in your life Hallelujah Moses brother Brandon said had two signs and I don't didn't bring the quote but just you can go find it he said miracles and healing one was a healing of leprosy in the hand and the other one was a miracle because it was a rod that he threw down and it become a serpent that's a miracle it's beyond human explanation according to Webster a paradox brother Brandon says is something that seems incredible but it's true therefore if Paradox would be the same as a miracle he said a paradox is when something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true now remember when we're teaching on the gifts that we can't teach you how to receive the gifts all we can do is tell you what it is and we can tell you that it's present and we can tell you those nine spiritual gifts are in the body that God does Miracles he's a worker of Miracles but what what is a gift to work miracles it's somebody who is able to believe that God is still God that he's still the same yesterday today and forever somebody who's able to reach out by simple faith and grab a hold of the fact that God does things beyond my explanation are you with me tonight it seems like it just couldn't be he said the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true he said now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens you cannot explain it he said that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth we believe in a god of Miracles our Miracle working God changed Abraham and Sarah's bodies and you don't know how he did it right I don't know how he did it but he did it hey man do you wear a grandma that that was too old to be to have children that was almost at the end of her life turned back and become such a desirable young woman beautiful young woman that a king tried to take her away from Abraham proud to be one of his wives and I have what would cause that it had to be a miracle-working god it was a miracle working God that brought plagues on the Egyptians frogs and and and and hail and darkness and the death of the firstborn a miracle working God it was a miracle working God that opened the Red Sea for Moses I'm just going through some things that I thought of and I put them down because well I want to remind you that we serve a miracle working God it was a miracle working God that caused that Red Sea to open it they said well he walked across on I walked across on uh just a little bit of water on a sea of reeds and brother said well that would be even more of a miracle because he drowned all the Egyptians in that water it was a miracle that stopped the Sun for Joshua unexplainable that's brother Raymond's Point by the way he's not trying to tell you that the that the Earth is flat or or that the Earth doesn't move when brother random talks about this it was the son that stood still because the Bible is true he said that's not that ball of gas out there that missile he calls it but he said somehow this son that you see Stood Still the reflection of the sun he said but that doesn't make sense because if the Earth stopped and it would all fall off because gravity would stop don't you see it's a miracle it's beyond explanation it's not supposed to make sense right stop the Sun for Joshua he raised the dead shunamite for Elisha the dead shunamites boy he delivered the three Hebrew children from the fire that don't make sense that they didn't even smell like smoke and the only thing the fire burned was the ropes off of their hands that don't make sense but he did it he delivered Daniel from the Lions turn the water to wine fed five thousand with the loaf and two fishes that don't make any sense that they took up 12 basket full of leftovers leftovers after they got done eating at the buffet and it was one little boy's lunch that's a miracle it was a miracle that opened bartimaeus's eyes miracle that Cath Legion the the demon Legion of demons out of the maniac of gadera we heard about on Sunday night it was a miracle that raised up Christ on the third day unexplainable but true it was a miracle that raised a lame man at the gate beautiful it was a miracle that delivered Peter from prison and we could go on and on and on speaking of miracles in the New Testament why because we serve a Jehovah of Miracles we still do tonight you don't want to get so carnal that you can't leave God any room to work brother Branham says that this lady said you need to get out of order just long enough to get saved and in preaching these gifts a lot of what we talk about is church order and we want that we we want to make sure we get it right and he said well how do we know if we get it right well the prophet was right about it and the Bible's right about it so we want to make sure that we get it right but at the same time we need to maintain our belief in a miracle-working God we need to understand that God can get out of the way and get us out of the way and move us in a different direction and make the service go away that we didn't intend who does that a miracle working God how many times has God spoken directly to you in the service talk to you some of you told me how God talked to you directly in the service and I'm not talking about like brother Branham with discernment I'm talking about the preaching of the word that spoke directly to your heart because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart how many times has he done that that's a miracle and you can either believe in a miracle working God or turn him down but I'd rather believe in the Jehovah of Miracles I'd rather believe in a lord Jesus Christ who's the same Hebrews 13 and ate the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah you might ask me tonight why does God do miracles you ever think about that you don't have to right now again in a way because of the atonement God is obligated to heal you based on your faith but he's not obligated to give you a miracle he is obligated to heal you you say well I I just let him heal me I won't ever believe for a miracle then think about this the obligation of healing wasn't extended to the Gentiles until after Jesus left the scene that's right because Jesus told the the South Phoenician woman he said the healing is the children's bread so it's not for you dogs but she had the right attitude amen but she said I know that it's not promised to me but I believe that even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table and that's the way we ought to be about miracles I understand that what I'm promised is healing what I'm promised is is God will heal me he didn't say when but he would heal me but yet I also believe in a miracle working God and sometimes I need a supernatural intervention and I'm gonna be like the South Phoenician woman he won't even discourage me right the word itself won't even discourage me from seeking a miracle are you with me now he let God do what he wants to but leave the option open right oh God I believe you're a Jehovah of Miracles why does God do Miracles brother random talks about the eagle and how she has a little nest full of of eaglets and she wants to show the eaglets her power and so she wants something the reason why she wants them to see who she is so they can recognize who they can be a miracle working God wants you to show you miracles so you think you can recognize that you are a miracle so brother bear said she gets up there before this little fellow because why she's going to take him on a flight he's never been out of that Nest some of us need to get out of the nest we need to get out of our comfort zone yeah yeah we need to get out of our comfortable chair and get into a place where we can receive from God he's going to take him on a flight he's never been out of that nest and she's going to take him way up in the heavens and Shake him off and let him up there to flock for himself to learn how to fly so she wants to show The Authority she has now watch this she spreads forth her big wings to the strutting of the feathers and she screams and then she fans them oh my the feathers fly out of the nest you realize Revival is uncomfortable there's never been a comfortable Revival you you said well brother Ben I want Revival I want to see God move for my family I want to see God move for my children it won't be comfortable it's not going to leave you sitting like you were when it came look Revival is uncomfortable Revival gets you thinking about your your sin Revival gets you thinking about where you've come up short Revival puts you under conviction and puts a desire in your heart a burning desire to serve God huh that's what Revival does and so now these are 10 these little eagles are in Revival oh my the feathers fly over the nest and everything else she's throwing wind in there like out of a Jet Plane knocks him backwards and he lays on his little back and he looks up and thinks mother How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art isn't that what he does to us so many times when we come and hear the preaching of the word when we're sitting in a service in the presence of God begins to move so supernaturally that we can we can just feel it all around us he doesn't have to do that he never has to let us feel it again but he does it anyway why does he do it because he wants us to be knocked back on our back and lay there and think oh God How Great Thou Art make you uncomfortable put you in a service makes you uncomfortable people talk bad about you people say you're Pentecostal people say you're nuts you just say there and say oh God How Great Thou Art but the JT Justin Hall at the presence of God and the power of God we need to know what that's like church we don't need to forget what it's like to be under the influence of a miracle working God see how strong my wings are I can pick you up and pack you anywhere I want to I'm powerful he said that's what God was doing to Israel you remember he told them he said I brought you out On Eagle's Wings he didn't have to do it that way he could have led him a different direction they would have never come up against the Red Sea but why did he lead Moses to the banks of the Red Sea why did he lead you right to the banks of a trial why did he put you here in laodicea he could have made it easy for you he could have made it easy for me but he didn't do it why didn't he do it but again because he wanted to show us how strong he was he wanted to show us his Deliverance power he could have made everything easy for you and your family he could have made the road paved it made it all easy but every time you have a victory it seems like you take another step back every time there's a Mountaintop there's also a valley why he's bringing you through a route that will cause you to understand how great he is he's bringing you through oh I I wonder if anyone's ever experienced that in your life he's brought you through a route that shows you I'm God I'm a great God I'm an awesome God good yes sir Hallelujah oh I wish I wasn't so fat sometimes I preach like him evangelist here but doesn't it stir your heart yeah doesn't this stir your heart look up and say you knocked me on my back you showed me your power that's what God was doing to Israel he said you know he said it's the eagle stirth of finesse that's the same thing he found Israel in a howling land down there he brought him up out of Egypt took him into the promised land on the wings of an eagle what was God doing these miracles what was God doing these Miracles he was trying to get to his people that he was the mighty Jehovah and that's what he's trying to do today he just doesn't heal people just because he can heal he's trying to get to you that he's the resurrection over to God so if you never got sick you would never understand what the resurrection means but because you were flat on your back one time in a hotel where in a hospital room because you knew what it was like to be at the verge of death because you had some sickness in your body and you've had to fight it over and over again God was showing you every time he heals you every time he lets you live another day he's shown you there's a resurrection somewhere every time he gives you the strength to come to the house of God sister friends he's shown you there's a resurrection yes Hallelujah I'm glad he does it he's trying to get to you that he's the resurrection that he can make you well he can raise up your body he can do whatever he wants to he's Jehovah Hallelujah miracles he's a miracle working God yet we understand Miracles are sovereign we know when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these stones to be made bread that would be a miracle he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's why we don't take up serpents at least on purpose all right because if I brought out a box of rattlesnakes today I I don't know how much faithful I know I wouldn't I wouldn't be around I'd let Billy Joel preach that service my brother Stewart one of the other brothers I I just don't think I could handle it me in a boxer rattlesnakes don't mix and we don't take up serpents because we don't tempt God but if I come in the line of duty like Paul was and I find myself over a campfire and one bites me in the hand I've got a miracle working God I serve a miracle working god brother Branham talks about the man who got bit by a rattlesnake down in Florida he was out here out fishing and it wasn't too long after he was after he was prayed for that he was completely well and the poison had left his body what was that a miracle working God showing us he's the same yesterday today and forever that's right most of the Miracles we see in scripture are associated with Deliverance so if you're keeping notes write that down Deliverance Miracles are associated with Deliverance that was the case with Giddy and I want us to look at Gideon for a moment in the time that we have left and we're going to look at Gideon and I brought these things to you before but maybe take just a little bit different a slant on it tonight Judges chapter six is where you'll find the story judges six and seven says it came to pass from the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus saith the Lord God of Israel how I love that he sends a prophet and he says I brought you up from Egypt brought you forth out of the house of bondage that delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians out of the hand of all that oppressed you and draved them out from before you and gave you their land so he's reminding them the prophet is reminding them of a miracle working God he's bringing Christ out of History making him present and I said it to you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice now brother Branham teaches us in a message that he titles if God be with us then where is all the Miracles he preached on the New Year's in a New Year's service and he titles uh that sermon if God is with us and where are all the Miracles and then he preaches that God always sends a prophet for deliverance for deliverance and I'm here to tell you tonight we're not waiting on that he has done that he has done that if you need Deliverance tonight take advantage of it you need Deliverance in your life and and yet you never pick up a tape you never read a book you never hear a prophet you don't know anything about the message you never study it you never if you need Deliverance you need to look to a Deliverance message that we had today what it was was a message of Deliverance to get us ready to deliver us from this age this message is a message of Deliverance if you need Deliverance you need to go back as as brother Andrew reminded us last week you need to get nosy in the message right I'm thankful I got some questions this week and different ones told me we're getting nosy I'm thankful for that I'm thankful for that because this message will is a message of Deliverance something in it that'll deliver you but I'm thankful also that when the messenger left he didn't just leave a void when the prophet left you didn't leave the void but he sent Christ when the angel left remember John said I must decrease that he might increase it was Christ that come and took his place and now when uh when this Angelus Prophet left uh Gideon and left that nation of Israel in Genesis 6 11 it says There came an angel of the Lord and said under an oak which was an offer the pertaining to joash yeah everybody's right his son Gideon fresh Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites now he later tells us that this was the Lord in a theophany body capital l o r d Angel the Lord is a pre-incarnation uh uh pre-incarnation theophany body of Jesus Christ so now and Gideon's down here afraid to take God in his word but here comes a prophet came and went and here come the angel of the Lord Hallelujah you may not believe it but I want to testify to you what I believe tonight that when a prophet gave his message Christ the word came down and come in this place and it's here today amen the same yesterday today and forever then what do you have to be afraid of today nothing come on why because Christ has come look he said I know there's going to be a Rapture a physical Rapture we'll see a physical Lord Jesus we believe that but we also believe that he has come in our day in word form and he says oh we're living in a grand time immediately when the prophet went off the scene what happened the Lord came on the seat as soon as John went off the scene the Lord came on the sea very strange how God works but he does it he works in mysterious ways and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor brother Jason he didn't think he was a mighty man of Valor right he's hiding from the enemy he don't know he he don't even he's even afraid to take God in his word just for their basic needs and how many times we find ourselves in that same position but he says you're a mighty man of Valor and Gideon said to him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us notice he identifies him as the Lord first you got to recognize who came in our day he identified the word the Lord being present he said oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this befall in us and where is this gift of Miracles that you talked about being in the church right where be all his miracles now this is a great question and watch how he backs it up he's scriptural he said where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up out from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us delivered us in the hands of the median ice but he's going back to the scripture and saying he should be the same today as he was then if he's still God he should still be the same do we still believe that today it's a valid question if God is with us why are we not delivered and I'll say this if you're living under bondage constantly in your life you need to question yes you need to question if God is with us where are all the Miracles and I'm here to tell you they're here they're here for you you don't have to live under bondage you don't have to live up and down and up and down and in and out and never know who you are and never know where you belong you can belong to him you can be one with the word in this day you can be a bride without spot or wrinkle you can be washed in the blood of the Lamb you can be a part of the bride's Revival you can be the bride's Revival that's the day we live in don't settle for anything less so he didn't just say well that's a good message praise God I believe a prophet he said if God is with us why are we not delivered you don't have to be in bondage to depression you don't have to be in bondage to pornography you don't have to be in bondage to fear yeah to nicotine to alcohol to drugs to a religious spirit you don't have to be in bondage you just need Jehovah of Miracles to come by your way he's still a miracle working God and when you need Deliverance you need to start asking questions you need to get a little uncomfortable and start asking questions Lord if you are with us where are the Miracles we need to start digging and that's that's the greatest sin of our time if I can say it that way it's complacency it's just drifting along with the tide it's becoming label to see it now if we if we don't see God in our own lives and I'm not talking about going out there and doing like he's going to do for the Jews and and bringing out a worldwide Revival I'm not talking about that I'm talking about miracles in your own life Supernatural unexplainable Revelation Supernatural unexplainable change in your life when if you don't see that you need to ask him for it yes sir and I'm preaching a little bit for a Wednesday night but it just struck me he's a god of Miracles and brother Branson those gifts are in the church today God where are you at I need you tonight where's that gift of Miracles I need that working of miracles in my life I need it in my family I need it in my home I needed in my church I need you to be a supernatural God need you to reveal yourself to me like you did to job when he said he said I've heard with my ears but now I see yeah amen now I know who you are oh how many can say Amen to that tonight I know who you are Lord I've seen you with my own eyes I know you're a worker of Miracles if you don't have that in your life you need to start digging where are my miracles if you did it for Joshua if he did it for Moses if he did it for shamgar he can do it for me too are you with me now if he delivered brother Ben I just use myself because I needed deliverance and the god of Miracles has come by my way not once not twice but many times and delivered me delivered me when I needed Deliverance or if you delivered if he delivered we think of the great evangelist brother Daryl Ward brother Andrew Glover people like that brother Ron Spencer if he delivered them I can think of people here in the church if you deliver brother JT if he delivered each and every one of you from every kind of a spirit that there was if he delivered you he can deliver our young people as well he can deliver our children as well he can deliver those that need it today foreign don't sit in complacency but believe in a god of Miracles do it for me where can I see this God In Action where is he at if he is for us he said the Mighty Man of Valor could refer back to the old word and know it's right because he knew this that God is a supernatural being and wherever a supernatural being is he'll do Supernatural signs because the Supernatural is in him you just can't get out of it he said how can you stand in the face of the wind without having wind blowing and I'm fixing I'm fixing to call I want to call the devil's Bluff because the devil sometimes will sip in and he'll tell you well you know I know you've never experienced God but you know it's really not like that anymore yeah and you just have to go through a 12-step program and someday you'll be okay it's the devil we want to call his bluff tonight right how can you get in water without being wet water is wet we know it's not all about emotion I preach that to you many times but how can you get in the presence of a supernatural miracle-working God and sit there like a bump on a log yeah are you with me now how can you do it yeah yeah there's got to be something when water is wet yeah when they come out of the upper room let me say this with all of you all the authority that I can muster according to a Vindicated Prophet they weren't out shaking hands on the parking lot but they were staggering like drunk men and the people said well they've drunk new wine and he said no they haven't they're drunk of the Holy Ghost this is that that was promised you can't get in water without being wet you can't face god without it changing you look what it did for Moses who saw God just the hindered part of God and it veiled him in glory changed him when he met the pillar of fire it changed his appearance what has it done for you and I it's done the same thing may not have changed the outside of this flesh that much although it it usually does it may not have changed the maybe the form of your face but it changed you on the inside something happened he said but brother Ben I'm not where I want to be but you're not where you used to be you were in the water and you got wet yeah you were in the wind and you felt the force of the wind blowing you can't be in the wind without it blowing you can't get in the water without being wet so that's the chemical of it is wet when you get in water you're going to get wet and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there is going to be Supernatural signs and Supernatural workings of a supernatural God you're not going to keep doing what you always do I say we should strive for a supernatural God to be present in every one of our services why because we need him we need him we need him we can't do it without him how dare we go without him like Moses said he said thy presence he said my presence will go before you he said if it doesn't go don't let me go we don't want to go without your presence we can't do it without you yeah yeah verse 14 judges 6 14 the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee and he said unto him oh my Lord where is shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manassa I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee Thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight show me a sign that thou talkest with me I want to know that it's you Lord I think every service we ought to ask God the same thing if this is you Lord speaking to my heart if this is your word show me something Lord it don't have to be some some great thing but the Lord somehow make it real to me make it real to me make your word real I want a supernatural element to it Hallelujah show me a sign said depart not hints I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and said it before thee he said I will tarry until Thou come again my brother Branham tells us it was probably two or three hours by the time Gideon came back but the Lord waited patiently well Gideon got down at the altar and went to work see Gideon didn't get down at the altar to get something yeah Gideon got down at the altar to get a sacrifice ready to present to God something that could be consumed Gideon went in made ready a kid unleavened cakes of an IFA of flower and the flesh you put in a basket you put the broth in a pot brought it out into him under the Oak and presented it many times people are waiting on God God's waiting on you to make a sacrifice start showing up in church start doing the hard stuff I know we harp on those things but churches so it's the elementary it's a little stuff he wants us to start giving of ourselves not sit there and wait oh God I know you're Supernatural God so I'll sit here and wait on you no Gideon said if you're a supernatural God if I do my part I know you'll do your part yes so he brought the sacrifice he brought it under the Oak and presented it when he got done at the altar the angel was still there he waited on him and the angel of God said unto him take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes lay them Upon This Rock pour out the broth and he did so and then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock I love I love how God works Supernatural There Rose up fire out of the rock Gideon didn't have to Kindle it he didn't have to work it up he didn't have to sing for search songs are you with me now he didn't have to worry well you know if we don't have a certain preacher we can't have Revival we don't have certain songs we can't ever Revival no Gideon knew that if he was a supernatural God God could come out of a dry Rock fire would come out of a drive oh God that he would give us on Wednesday night that this would be that rough that he could bring out of that rock some fire because we need it but what was the purpose of the fire to consume the flesh this is what's lacking this is what's lacking in me this is what's lacking in you yeah I'm just being honest with you we're children of God we're predestined children of God we're going to make it we believe that tonight but if we want to live a Victorious life and I know that you do because you are predestined children of God you need to let him consume the flesh consume it until you can be smote on one's cheek and turn the other one consume it until the carnality is gone and you don't care what position you feel in the church you just want to be a help consume it until everything is burned out are you with Me Now consume it until you know you say I don't care if I'm the pastor if you move Lord I'm going to move if you if you if there's if there's uh something that makes tears come out of my face I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to you Lord if there's a place something that needs to be done in the church is there some position needs to be filled if it's just me raising my hands and worshiping on a Wednesday night let me do it Lord till you make promises you can keep consumed until the old man is dead okay old story I think I've told you before but the man the old Holiness preacher and the man was said he was entirely Sanctified as what they called it back there and entirely Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and and they found he caught him stealing watermelons he said I thought you died the other night at the altar he said I did he said never seen a dead man steal watermelon the truth Paul said I died daily sanctification is an ongoing process but something the message of the hour taught us you don't quit striving for sanctification after you receive the Holy Ghost it just gives you the ability to remain Sanctified if you stay under the influence of the Holy Spirit but you don't quit striving for sanctification I say God help me today and that's more than just how you dress y'all dress good I'm so happy to have a group of people that that dress well and act one present themselves well but that's not all of it it's our attitudes towards one another it's how we treat strangers it's how we react to other people in the church you want to know if you're dead let somebody start poking you real good you know take a a cow you know Abraham offered a cow on the altar a two-year-old heifer and one of the ways you know if a cow is alive if you touch it there's a tender spot behind their leg if you touch that tender spot they'll kick huh boy got quiet you want to know if you're dead As Dead As you should be let somebody touch that tender spot see if you're dead yet or not I didn't plan on going this direction let's see if we're dead yet or not somebody take that cattle prod and just poke that tender spot oh you saw something that you didn't see before and then what do you do you go back and ask God God consume do a supernatural work I can't do it on my own my own some of you have been through horrible things you've seen preachers do horrible things you've seen you've seen people fall away you've gotten jaded against message people maybe because of the things that have went on and you get to the point where you don't even you don't even really like to be identified with the message because you've seen so much nonsense but be careful there's got to be a moment in your life where you sell out to the message of the hour you sell out to the word of the hour until they can poke that tendered spot where you've been hurt over and over again and you still lift your hands and say God you're still God this message is still true no matter what everybody else did [Applause] right it rolls up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Fletch and the unleaven Branham taught us that the greatest miracle was the new birth how many know he taught that over and over again so if God if there's a worker of Miracles I believe that's Christ today but if there's a gift of working in Miracles and there's got to be a new birth taking place because that's the greatest miracle brother Branch that's the one I talked of this morning when you lay your soul that morning he preached you must be born again he said when you lay your soul upon his brass altar of judgment what takes place if he's the same God he'll take the sacrifice you've offered it in sincerity upon his altar he'll consume that sacrifice and the world will be gone out of you just the smoke will fall away the sacrifice will be gone if you be God and you are the god of the Bible look where he takes he doesn't take it well if you really get down to business with God you have great Miracles and signs and wonders that's not where he takes it he said if you really get down the business of God and say God where are the Miracles he'll consume you can't do Miracles through you until he consumes you right and that in itself is the greatest miracle said if you be God you're the god of our Bibles our our fathers tell that before Miracles let me see you perform a miracle let me see some sort of miracle that I know God has met with me he said now may I say this if God Still Remains God if God is the same God he was in the days gone by you don't have to go up and shake hands with the preacher you don't have to go up and put your name on a book them things are all right nothing against it he explains how church members act going back and forth Pillar To Post he said if God remains God lay your sinful so on his Altar and he'll touch you with his word and his power and the world will be gone from you you'll be a new Creature if he remains God you believe he's still God tonight he was God of the Old Testament he was God of the New Testament he's the same God today yesterday today and forever and you know then down in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you want strength and smoked and lied and you women love the world so much you kept wearing your makeup and your short hair and doing other things you did and you find out that something happens all the devils in Hell couldn't make you do it again something happened a god of Miracles performed glory to God what did he do he changed your vile heart change your desires change your nature a supernatural word by a supernatural God made a creature of time to a creature of Eternity took the world out of you and put Christ in you the hope of glory and you're filled with the spirit ready to meet him if God be God where is his miracles if God is with us where is his miracles he said if God's with the Methodist Church why is all the women still wearing bobbed hair if God's with the Baptist Church was a pastor still smokes cigarettes many of them he said why do they still deny the power of God to heal the sick to raise the dead to speak in tongues interpretations Gifts of Prophecy why do they still deny it if the god of the Old Testament god of the New Testament is still the same God if the god of the New Testament the Holy Ghost is still the god Pentecostals claim oh now we're going to get down to the nitty-gritty before we go he said if he's still the god the Pentecostals claim why don't they break down their walls of petition and fussing at one another and become Born Again Christians you realize I know I'm talking about I've been to a lot of places in my life in a short few years I've been around a lot most people only go to One Church ever and some of them only ever hear one preacher and if that one preacher fails they're gone that one Church closes or no more because their whole religion is that and they're taught not to even speak to anybody else brother Brandon said if if God is still the god of Miracles you believe he is tonight why don't you break down those walls of protection that'd be a miracle in hearty wouldn't it fussing at one another become Born Again Christians said sure no one one won't even speak to the other one see the sacrifice hasn't been consumed they go through Sensations he said they've done that all their also the ages under Idols they've done Sensations but the god of the Bible That's the God the same yesterday today and forever burns up the world and all the difference makes us new creatures in Christ say brother Ben I don't like that very much I didn't say it remember that Prophet we talked about remember that Christ that came down in our age not the man but the word through opening of the word the revealing of the word taught us to tear down the walls of petition [Music] Jesus said these testify and tell you who I am what the works that I do because I serve a god of Miracles I want us to look as we're closing it Gideon's response to this miracle working God judges 6 22 when Gideon perceived that he he was an angel of the Lord Capital Lord Gideon said alas O Lord God because I've seen an angel or theophany of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die you realize what this message is and what that Supernatural power is that's been talking to you it's been working in your life he said I I might I'll die he said Don't Fear thou shall not die then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah shalom I love this Jehovah's shalom not Jehovah the one who brings confusion not Jehovah the one who who brings all kinds of differences and of opinions and and Jehovah the one who caused all kinds of problems but Jehovah shalom now when you come to this Jehovah Shalom it may separate you from all kinds of things but it won't separate you from the word and it won't separate you from God's people you you come at a place of peace he said Jehovah Shalom Yahweh is peace Yahweh is peace Brandon picks up on this he said the sun is always Shining the only thing that keeps us from seeing it is the clouds and this is what he's saying about miracles it's important about miracles it's they're there we serve a Jehovah of Miracles Gideon served the Jehovah of Miracles and if we're willing to step out in faith there you'll see miracles happen yes yes but what keeps us from seeing it is the clouds right he said take the clouds away what happens the sun is right there the only thing you have to do today musicians go ahead and come he said the only thing you have to do today say not oh Jesus come and heal me oh Jesus give me the Holy Ghost just take the clouds away he's already there he said God give me a great gift show me this great gift show me what I'm supposed to do just let the clouds go away you got the doubt go away let the fear go away that thing that you're doing that you know is wrong stop doing it let the power of God begin to work in your life let the clouds go away he's already there would you bow your heads with me maybe you got clouds in your life we all do at times or sunny days there's cloudy days there's days when you you don't feel good you don't feel like a Christian you don't you don't feel like a a servant a child of a miracle working God oh and yet you know that he is something inside of you knows that he is foreign I want to challenge you want to get outside your comfort zone you're gonna have to at some point let God be the Jehovah of Miracles just right where you're sitting tonight just the Lord I'm that dry Rock [Music] but Lord you made Fire come out of a dry Rock one time and out of another rock you've brought water oh God Lord consume me today consume me let me let me throw me back on my back lord and hit me with the wings of your power the wind and from those wings let me see oh God you're great God you're awesome if you haven't experienced him in that way in a long time maybe ever you need to tonight you need to you need to get down to business with God I needed to every day every day and you get busy you get busy with things we're doing projects we're doing around the church I get busy with good things but I'll never forget what a prophet of God in our day he come and preached a message about pride and about Jesus sitting here with unwashed feet and he said they had lots of good things to do they were busy with church problems busy with churchanity and they forgot to welcome Christ who sit in the corner with unwashed feet I don't want that to be me tonight I want them to come in Lord consume me if I've gotten picked on or something that's hurt my feelings consume my pride Lord consume my carnality consume the thing that makes me mad at people when they when they do treat me a little bit wrong consume that Lord I want to be like you God when when you were reviled you reviled not again consume me Lord make me more like you oh God would that be your prayer tonight let him do a miracle let him Break Down The Walls of partition those people you won't speak to those people that you've begun to hate let him take that out if you burn it out and just begin to work in your life Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I am I'm a candidate today oh for for a burning Lord a burning sacrifice a consuming fire oh God I'm a candidate Lord all of us pick up things through our lives we pick up we pick up worry we pick up stress we pick up things that maybe we wouldn't think of as ungodly but Lord it clouds the skies where we can't see a miracle working God would you take it out of the way Lord oh God consume us today may your fire come down in this service Lord consume us oh God we stand candidates today Lord where we are right in this place oh God may you consume every heart consume every Spirit consume all burn up all the atmospheres oh God as your Prophet taught us said when the earth is renovated you'll burn up all the atmospheres of sin Lord when where we have a new birth or it burns up all the atmosphere May there be a refilling of the Holy Spirit again today burn up all the drops in our spirit and in our flesh oh God consume us or the two were more like you we know Lord we'll have to ask time and time again because even when our soul is safe Lord there continues to be a building up of the old the old nature oh God that sticky nature maybe be consumed today God may we be free oh God a heart if there's any person within the sound of my voice Lord here we're watching tonight lord it's got some bondage in her life consume them o God oh God consume them tonight let them recognize that you are still God oh God take it away from him now oh Lord we pray we pray that you would do it as hard as we fill your presence here may we be free to build our altar in worship once our sacrifice has been
