TRANSCRIPT
========================================
welcome to our Bible study this evening we're coming to you from the church tonight we had some trouble with the internet last week at our house so we're trying to try to do this live if we can and then as many of yous can watch and we are doing an hour earlier so if you miss it it's no problem you can go back to it and get it later we won't be very long tonight but we're just trying to do some things a little bit differently and learn some new things I've got Peter and Esther on the video today and they'll also be bringing in the screen hopefully where you can see it on the video so we're figuring out how to do some stuff so just bear with us and and I'm thankful for you being able to join us tonight let's have a word of Prayer as we begin and we'll get started on this Heavenly Father Lord Jesus were so thankful to be in your presence here today and to know God that you're with us wherever we are father I pray that you would just move especially as we've heard the prayer requests today for brother Joel Forney I pray that you'd move where he's at today God and I haven't heard the results yet of the surgery if they're still in surgery but Lord we know that you're able to guide the doctors hand you're also able to touch our brother who's had faith for so many of us down through the years and so Lord were we're believing in agreeing father that these things will we'll be exactly what they should be god I pray that you'd help us tonight and as we're doing these things that there would be an ability that only you could give father I pray that you'd help us to to make take heed of the Word of God it's not important what I say but what the word says is important so I pray that you bless us tonight for every prayer request Lord that we've been we've been following as a church Lord and praying for that I pray that you just continue to meet those needs and I pray God that you would bless us Lord as we look forward in this coronavirus thing God you you knew this was coming we didn't know but I pray God that you'd help us to have the wisdom to know and what to do and as we go forward as we're nearing maybe perhaps the end of this and so we pray God that you'll help us help us as a church that we'd reach out during this time father whatever time that we have left here on the earth I pray father we would reach out and then we would help our community and those that are need all around us we know that we're much in need of prayer Lord and we want to not so much others praying for us but we're in need Lord that we would pray and that we would reach out to you and not that our situations would change God but that we would change I pray you granted tonight we pray in Jesus name Amen alright we're gonna read again from 1st Corinthians chapter 1 I want to read it as we go along tonight and just kind of save time but I do want to back up a little bit and go over a little bit of what we talked about the first time so that if you didn't get to listen to that you kind of get a chance to catch up with us we found in verses 1 through 9 that Paul in verse one defends his Apostleship in other words he's defending his right to say the things that he said and so he's defending that and his ability to to be the one to say it and we found out that we have a right to say certain things and we have to be able to defend that Paul in verse 1 also identifies himself as one of the ministry he he talks about being one with Sosthenes our brother and and so he identifies himself and Paul always did that and his greetings to the churches we found out that the Corinthians were Saints the Corinthians were not unbelievers they were not people who were lost but they were saved but yet at the same time they needed to toe the line they needed to get back in line as brother Branham tells us with the preview of the bride they needed to get back in line that fallen far from where they should be or had never come to what they should be they had been immature and carnal and but they were Saints they were Saints it didn't change who they were so he wrote to them as such we found out in verse 7 that they thought of themselves as a first-class church and thought of themselves is the best and I'll get to that in just a moment and then in verses 8 through 9 we found that God was faithful to them and I'm so grateful tonight for the faithfulness of God that God was faithful to confirm them through correction and through their ability to learn as they as they worked through these things and I believe God will be faithful with us as well to correct us and to bring us to where we need to be because every one of us need something from God we need God to move on our behalf we need we need God to correct us in a way that would be helpful and so that's what the book of Corinthians is about is correction that would be helpful and that would be that would be something that would not destroy us but something that would help us along life's journey so we want to make sure that we're able to do that tonight now I wanted to read this to you I wanted to read this last week and I never did get to it but Charles Spurgeon and I have a Spurgeon Study Bible here so I don't have it on the screen but Charles Spurgeon on the first corinthians said this he said the most gifted church is not always in the healthiest condition a church may have many rich influential or learned members yet that church may be in an unhealthy condition such was the case with the church at Corinth Paul in the opening of his letter told them that he think God always on their behalf for the grace of God given to them by Christ Jesus then in everything they were enriched in all speech and in all knowledge they did not lack in any spiritual gift they were waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the Corinthians this is Spurgeon again he says the Corinthians were what we would call a first-class church they had many who understood much of the learning of the Greeks they were people of classic taste people of good understanding people of profound knowledge and yet in spiritual health that church was one of the worst in all Greece and perhaps in the world among all the churches one could not find another church sunk so low as this one although it was the most gifted the opening of the letter Paul hinted that the purpose of the church was to confirm the testimony about Christ I want to get that because that's our purpose is to confirm the testimony of Christ with our lives it's not so much what we say how many gifts that we have but are we able to confirm with our lives the testimony of Christ if a church does not use its gifts and resources for that purpose it misses the entire point of its existence I thought that was good and that was the Corinthian church let's go to 1st Corinthians 1 in 10 first corinthians chapter 1 and verse 10 if you're following along in your Bible at home he says now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment and you'll find Paul using medical terms here you'd be perfectly joined together one body but he speaks of that you speak the same thing that's one and that there be no divisions among you so two things that he's speaking of speak the same thing notice he doesn't say to believe the same thing necessarily although it would be important to believe the same thing he doesn't say to have the same opinions but he says speak the same thing because what you say is what's going to have an impact on the world that you live in and so he says speak the same thing brother Branham deals with this in an immense meeting with ministers and deacons and and people like that and he says our Heavenly Father he's praying he said we have assembled here as a group of man Christian men who love you who believe in you and who is dedicated our lives and services to your service there's ministers here young men middle-aged men they got churches they're responsible before God there's deacons here that's responsible in their offices in different churches there's trustees there's responsibilities pastors evangelists whatever Lord we're responsible to you and that's why we come together that we might all speak the same thing as we were said that we must do in the scripture we must all speak alike we must all speak the same thing now why do some not speak the same thing and the same thing is not my idea of something or someone else's but it's the Word of God well why do why is that not always what we speak and brother Branham explains that and God hiding himself in simplicity he said now he said why can't people believe the same the simple simplicity of a humble bunch of people see and the voice of the signs of God which we know the voice of the sign is the message of the hour why can't they believe it just like it always been a true Word of God being made manifest it's they're too smart and too educated to believe the simple form of the written word they want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that see it does mean that he said listen may I say this right quick now even the visions that God gives here at the place it's so misunderstood he said that's the reason you hear me on the tapes say say what the tapes say so what brother Brown is saying when he says say what the tapes say is the same thing Paul said he's saying that we should all speak the same thing we should say what the tapes say he doesn't want you changing the meaning of what he said and misrepresenting it to the people and so he says that's the reason you hear me on the tapes say say what the tapes say say what the visions say said now if you're wide awake you'll see something he said see I hope I don't have to hold it in my hand and show you see it's here we're at the end yes sir smart educational miss it he said the simple visions when they were revealed in such simplicity till it just covers over the top of the people's heads and so many times we don't say the same thing because we miss the simplicity of what he's actually trying to say and many times we missed the the forest for the trees we get too involved in words and and certain ideologies and certain things well I'm of this camper and the other and we'll talk about that in a moment but we need to find out what the word is and and remember that we are called to declare the entire Council of God so the second thing he said that there would be no divisions no divisions there's no schism since the words the same word for schisms in the body a schism is Wesley called that an alienation of affection from each other I like that definition he said that there be no alienation of affection from each other in other words you can disagree but when you speak that there would be no no difference in what you're saying now from one another or rather there would be no difference in your love when you get down to a certain point that you're speaking and and you disagree with one another but then you still love one another even though you disagree about things and and Wesley says this word ever taken any other sense in scripture but that you'd be joined in the same mind in the same affection same desires do you have the same love one for another but the random put it this way said many times people want to judge the man who doesn't agree with them said we're not to do that we can disagree with one another we can disagree with one another yet be friendly I like that we can disagree with one another yet be friendly said if I couldn't disagree with the man and still love him and pray for him and disagree him up I like the way he puts that disagree him up if I couldn't disagree with a man disagree him up with him on the basis of the scripture and for better enlightenment then I won't say nothing to him so if I can't agree with him if I can't disagree with him rather and still love him and still pray for him up and up on the basis of the scripture then I won't say nothing to him give them a chance to change that he said I always want to disagree with him friendly now that would teach us something wouldn't it and that's what Paul is saying here not that there would be no alienation of affection no schism in the body you may disagree you may have a difference of opinion but we all speak the same thing we all have the same word of God he said I want to disagree with him friendly because I love him and I certainly don't want him to be lost and he should do the same thing with me we don't want to be lost and we must base our thoughts notice what he says we must base our thoughts upon what the word says and so he's telling us that we can't just have a we can't just do this with anybody but if it's a brother he's going to come with the Word of God and we may have a disagreement about the Word of God but we have the same book we're coming back to we have the same the same thing the same token the same the word that I'm looking for the same absolute as the word that I'm looking for that we have the same absolute and because of we have the same absent which is a revealed word of the hour we know that we can come back to that even though we disagree about certain points so he says we must base our thoughts upon what the word says let the word be true not our Creed or what our thoughts but what he says no private interpretation but just what the word said first Corinthians 1:11 if you're following along in your in your Bibles tonight 1st Corinthians 1:11 so we started with verse 10 tonight we went through 1 through 9 last time he says Fred have been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you there are contentions among you I like how Paul gets his knowledge and that's something that a minister has to do sometimes sometimes you just have to deal with what you know it can be a dangerous thing to do but Paul doesn't in the spirit of love contentions is quarrel or the definition definition is a quarrel wrangling yester if you've got that definition up there a quarrel wrangling contention debate strife or variance and I want to take that to Galatians chapter 5 if we could take that over to Galatians chapter 5 and I'll give you a minute to turn there Galatians chapter 5 verses 19 through 20 and keep in first Corinthians because we're going to go four through several more verses but Galatians 5:19 is when it's talking about the works of the flesh and it talks about one of the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness verse 20 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance variance is the same word as contention variance contentions emulations wrath strife seditions and heresies Underland heresies as well because I want to point out tonight the difference in a heresy and a variance or a contention because there is a difference let's go to Titus chapter 3 tie this chapter 3 in verse 10 and it kind of explained to you about a heretic a heresy a heresy is something someone who's completely left the body of truth completely left the body of truth they we've seen lately people who deny the message completely and say brother Browne was a false prophet or something like that it would be a heretic by the scriptural definition someone who's left the body of truth they may still say they're a Christian but they've left the revealed truth and and counted the things of God has nothing and and and there would be other ways that you could be a heretic but I won't go into that tonight but in Titus 3:10 it says a man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject so give him a chance but if he keeps continuing down that way he says to reject in other words you can't really have fellowship with him there's no fellowship on the basis of the word because there's no word there's no atonement that you agree on that you could fellowship around and so you just leave him alone knowing that he that as such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself there's no point in arguing with him about it it's just just move on and and so that's the difference now this is the difference in division or contention versus heresy the vision is a medical term that Paul uses and it's torn but still in the body so it's like it's still hanging on but it's torn if you see that is that up on the screen Esther that definition division versus Harris eats torn but still in the body I got my kids scrambling back here so hope I hope y'all can see this torn but still they're gonna know how to do everything before they get done and and so if you get that it's a medical term that maybe you're kind of gruesome but if your arm got chopped halfway off but it's still there it's still there and so you bind it up you put it back together it's not in a good place but you're putting it back together you're putting it back together and so heresy is different from that heresy is something that's completely divided from the body completely divided from the body it's something that just unable to be put back together it's unable to be to be brought back to the body and so that's what heresy is let's go to verse 12 first Corinthians and 1 and 12 first Corinthians 1:12 says now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul I have a policy and I have Cephas and I have Christ so he's identifying the entire church in a in a set of schisms or set of divisions that they're all in and all of them are actually creating discord and identifying themselves by different names so I want to deal with that now he says one says I'm of Paul another says I'm of Apollo's notice says I have Cephas notice says I have Christ so four divisions if you pull that side up four divisions Paul Paulus Cephas which is Peter the Aramaic name for Peter and Christ the first one was the party of Paul Paul had a party represented there who called themselves by the name of Paul and there were those who believed what Paul had presented they owed to him their own salvation which many times is what a person will hold to is what they come in under what they were saved under and they had experienced the gospel and they they could not believe that there was any other mode of presenting Christ to me in other the way Paul preached and that's wonderful but gradually they become more concerned about upholding Paul's authority than to help the cause of Christ they probably fell into the mistake it's on the next slide to which all partisans are liable and they become more Pauline than Paul and I like the way this commentator put this because this is what happens even today they become more Pauline than Paul himself in other words they they defended Paul we didn't need to be defended and they actually actually magnify these peculiarities and attach the importance to casual sayings private practices of his own which in themselves were indifferent perhaps the way that he carried his Bible or the way that he did something so there was some danger that they might become more Pauline than Christian might allow their indebtedness to Paul to obscure their debt to Christ well I pray that we would never do that and they might so pride themselves in the teacher as to neglect what he taught and so they could tell you everything about Paul but not anything about what Paul preached so that's the party of Paul the party of Apollo's was a group a nopales was a great gifted minister and this was a learned and eloquent Alexandrian that had come to corinth after paul left and what paul had planted he he so successfully watered that many seemed to owe everything to em and and so before he came maybe they didn't really understand what paul preached and then Apollo's came and and he fitted the gospel into their previous knowledge and showed them its relation to other faiths opened up to them it's ethical wealth and bearing on life and they had been unable to make full use of Paul's teaching he had sown the seed in their minds but they don't the truth of his statements and accepted them but they never really understood it until Paulus preached it people are like that today and that may be true that there could be a minister that would come along and break down these things in a way that you would understand it and and the teaching of a Paulist was not opposed to Paul's it was supplementary to it and Paul tells the Corinthians that he even asked Apollo's to visit them again so we find out that they weren't rivals to one another but Apollo's refused very possibly because he was aware that there was a party there that was called by his name he didn't want to be identified that so Paul and Apollo's preached the same thing and yet there was a division in the church because one followed Paul said I'm a Paul the other one said I'm of Apollo's third party was the party of Peter a third party Gloria in the name of Cephas or Peter the apostle of the circumcision these would have been those who leaned toward the Jewish law and maybe they followed Peters example and withdrawing from the Gentiles but Paul rebuked him for that but yet they believed that Peter had a better authority a better right to say the things that he would say then Paul did and so these were people who called themselves by Peters name and they even criticized and I'm going through this trying to save some time but they even criticized Paul for not marrying because they felt like he he was insecure while Peter was able to marry what about you and and so they were of Peter and then there was another party which is interesting to me because Paul does not speak of this party in in a positive way but he he puts them right with the other parties and this party says I'm of Christ I'm of Christ now when I whenever I've read this I don't know about you but whenever I've read it I've always kind of thought that I would like to be in the party of Christ if I want to be in the party I would say I'm of Christ you say you're a Methodist or a Baptist or a Presbyterian I'm of Christ but yet they were using this as a way to divide people and this is important for us because I think most of you that would listen to this you're not gonna say I'm of this one or that one you're gonna say I'm of Christ I'm a Christian I follow the teachings of Christ but yet it was a spiritually proud utterance they were using that to differentiate themselves from these others they had used the name of Christ in an a in the name of unity against the other factions but it merely added another party to those already existing and so you might find people like that today that they say well I don't follow any preacher I just follow Christ maybe I don't even go to church I follow Christ well that's fine you might be a fine Christian but you're right there in that division of the body of Christ you can't be a Christian outside of the body if you are outside of the body and you're a Christian you just cause harm to the body you need to come back together with the body of Christ somewhere you have to be a part of the body of Christ you have to work with those maybe just a few but there's got to be someone that you can work with so when you say I'm of Christ it's just just me in Christ just me and God I don't have to go to church I'm not to do these things you have to be careful with that even though you can see the error of the PAS lights and the and the Apollo sites and the Peter ice yet you have to be careful not to just name yourself something to separate from them but to just be a Christian so brother branham picks it up this way and I know I'm spending a long time on this verse we won't spend this long on every verse in first Corinthians but I just want to really bear down on this brother Branham says if you say Methodist that's just a blasphemous name you say Baptists that's a blasphemous name we can say amen to that but brother let me ask you something what about Pentecost if it's not a born-again experience it's still a blasphemous name patterned after the beginning he said that's right they don't know one another I want you to just really listen to this and so I'm trying hard not to preach this and just because I'm behind the pulpit but it's just the way we had to do it tonight but just to talk about it but he said they don't know one another and they don't know fellowship all they know is their Creed and so they automatically discount people in some other place under some other ministry they don't know those people they don't necessarily even know what's taught but they know their Creed and so they said we know we're not like them but we shouldn't do that whether it's a Baptist Methodist Pentecostals Catholic it doesn't matter what matters is do we know Christ that's what matters but the venom tells the story about the blood tag being on the on the cows ear that would it was the blood tag that got him into the pasture and that's what's gonna get us into heaven is whether or not we're covered by the blood but he said these people they don't know fellowship all they know is their Creed and we have to be careful that doesn't happened to us as well first Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 13 he said his Christ divided I love the way Paul puts this it's a rhetorical question that's Greek argument here he says Christ divided was Paul crucified for you were you baptized in the name Paul some may have been the paw lights might have gotten that far but they did for brother Branham and I'm just kind of paralleling brother branham's ministry here with Paul because he was also a messenger Paul being the first messenger but the brand being the last he says in an absolute he said I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass you by I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay any attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't you watch the messenger watch the message first Corinthians 1:14 he says Paul says I think God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius listen any should say verse 15 that I had baptized in mine own name and as I said brother branham dealt with these things he said the other day in Canada a prophet or a brother rather showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pocket and said william branham is our lord baptizing in the name of william branham so I'm still do that today he said a precious he said if it had been an enemy if it had been my enemy I would have knew it was a joke but a precious darling brother came up to confess his sins and his wrongs and say his faith in me as being Jesus Christ he says I got all kinds of letters come in the last few days and calls from different places so saying I was Christ so who were these people these were the the Paul lights and the people that would follow after brother Branham after the flesh and they would say it's so saying that it was Christ he said brethren that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil I don't want to repeat one of the devil's lies I don't know about you he said they were precious people we have to remember that it was precious people that had been my enemy I could understand it but they had been deceived and he said that's a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil see I am your brother he said now that would run any person from the feet that would make anyone that loves Christ run from the very thing and you can see Paul's frustration in first Corinthians 115 verse 16 first Corinthians 1:16 he said I'm not baptized also so Paul it's almost like he's remembering he says I baptized also the household household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other we're gonna close with verse 16 but i just want to kind of dwell on that for a minute because it's interesting that paul being a messenger to the age and he's writing or dictating this to be written and he says i didn't baptize anyone but Crispus and Gaius then he comes back and says but I also baptize the household was Stephanus he said and I don't know if I baptized anyone else at least he was honest with us because Paul wasn't infallible messengers are not personally infallible this Bible that was written as infallible but Paul personally as a messenger as a prophet was not infallible in his personal life neither was brother Brandon and the reason we know that is because brother Branham says it but the Branham says men are not infallible but God is he says man you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake and that's always gonna be the truth if you think there's a man you say well Apollo's feeds me in such a way that man I I can only get it from him or what happens if something happens to a Paulus are you gonna follow then you better do is as Jesus said come follow me come follow me that's what we want to do tonight he said you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake maybe not willfully but he'll do it God permits him to do it so that he can shake your faith away from man he says our faith is not in the wisdom of men but in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ but you know I want to tell you tonight and closing that God is infallible I hope we know that that make us really trust him wouldn't it to know that he's never wrong he never has to rethink anything never has to go back and see what he did wrong and try to learn from it he never learned anything he's Elohim the self-existing God he existed before time and he knew all things God is infallible so brother Branham tells us stay with the word God is infallible God is the infinite one who cannot change he's unchangeable the unchangeable God the same one that fell on the day of Pentecost and filled all the house with a rushing mighty wind and cloven tongues of fire set upon them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost he said that's the same God that we look to see today it depends on what you're looking for he says we talked about Easter expectations on Sunday this is what he says the infinite God I am God and I changed not he doesn't change he can't change if that's what he give those first expectance and I like that those first expectance back there if that's what he give those people that's what he gives the second expectance that's what it gives the third fourth everyone he calls will be the same thing so glad we serve an infallible God in times like these we need a God whose infallible we need a God who knows all about us God who is able to touch our hearts in a way that nobody else can as we continue to study the book of 1st Corinthians I pray that it'll be a help to you in some way we'll continue it in some way whether we do it at the church once we're able to open back up or whether we do it from in videos from time to time like this but I trust it would be a blessing to you the word of God is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and we believe it has purpose and power in your life tonight and will not go forth boy let's pray one more time Heavenly Father thank you for letting us come together tonight even if it's by way of the internet god I pray that your spirit would just rest on these words that's been spoken tonight Lourdes is a different format for me and I'm a little bit nervous but no God that you're the same yesterday today and forever and you never change and you're infallible so we know you don't make any mistakes father you called us to be here and be in this place tonight somehow was in your will for me to do this and for us to be here and for these that are listening to listen pray you'd bless the hearer Lord may they hear your word may they go and study at Lourdes and be like like I am tonight in my heart god I don't want to be like the ones who said I'm a Paul or I'm of Apollo's or I identify with this doctrine or that one but I want to be like you lord I want to be a real Christian I want to be one with the body of Christ I don't want to be separated hanging on by a thread but I want to be one with the body of Christ let those things that have been Lord hurt those that have been torn let them be healed tonight we pray in Jesus name Amen god bless you we'll see you Sunday
