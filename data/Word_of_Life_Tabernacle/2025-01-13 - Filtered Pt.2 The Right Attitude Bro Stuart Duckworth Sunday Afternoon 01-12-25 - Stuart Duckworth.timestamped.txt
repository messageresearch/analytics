[51:38] our attitude amen filtered by the spirit
[51:41] through the word of God filtered our
[51:43] desires everything filtered through the
[51:47] word that word filtered is to remove
[51:51] unwanted
[51:52] elements to be filtered is to be
[51:55] subjected to that process right to be
[51:59] made clean we must be subjected to that
[52:02] process and as we said before that
[52:05] process produces something or someone
[52:08] that can be desired for use God has has
[52:10] a use for you and I and and that is to
[52:13] be the pure word bride in this hour to

[52:44] I can say it how many times I
[52:48] want
[52:52] amen yes sir in the thinking man's
[52:55] filter this is kind of where I got the
[52:57] the idea or the thought from this sermon
[53:01] he says here when you come into this
[53:03] world you were born in sin you didn't
[53:06] even come with a Fighting Chance you
[53:09] love sin your your desire was to sin but
[53:12] he said but down inside of you somewhere
[53:16] here you come there was something in
[53:18] there that begin to draw come on yes sir
[53:20] so amen there was something in you to
[53:23] draw amen amen through that word that
[53:26] you heard there was something that could
[53:28] respond to that amen no no matter how
[53:31] bad you were no matter the condition
[53:33] that you were you and I no matter no
[53:35] matter what we were caught up in no
[53:37] matter how bad we got there was
[53:39] something that be to draw in US amen
[53:41] there was something when you even when
[53:44] you were doing wrong amen you knew you
[53:46] knew you were different you knew you
[53:47] weren't supposed to be doing that there
[53:49] was something drawing in you it was that
[53:51] Jing seed of life that was wanting to to
[53:54] come out and to be manifested and when
[53:56] you heard the word amen something drew
[53:59] you right something begin to draw out
[54:02] right amen something begin to draw out
[54:04] and and you could begin to draw amen
[54:07] from from what you
[54:09] heard good yes he said you didn't have a
[54:12] fighting chance but down inside you
[54:14] there was something something he said
[54:16] something told you there was a god
[54:18] somewhere and he said there was there's
[54:21] different filters there was there was a
[54:22] church filter when you tried to come to
[54:24] come to God there was this idea and this
[54:27] type of filter there was he said there
[54:28] was denominational filters and filters
[54:30] of men's ideas he said here but when you
[54:33] use God's filter which is a thinking
[54:35] man's filter and you should go and
[54:37] listen to that sermon there's so much in
[54:38] that he said because all the other
[54:40] filters will pass away but mine shall
[54:43] not and when you take God's filter and
[54:45] draw your life your desires if you draw
[54:48] your desires through God's filter a
[54:50] thinking man's filter he said there's
[54:51] nothing left but the Holy Ghost and
[54:54] that's what we're trying to do here
[54:55] tonight we're trying to draw from the
[54:57] word of God Amen to be everything that
[55:00] God has called us to be and if you'll
[55:02] draw if you'll if you'll draw if you'll
[55:04] hunger and seek after righteousness amen
[55:06] it'll produce the Holy Ghost in you
[55:10] nothing but the Holy Ghost yes if we
[55:14] spend our time feeding on other things
[55:16] that's what we manifest but the Holy
[55:18] Ghost feeds upon the word that's what
[55:21] gives you strength that's what gives you
[55:23] and I the strength in this hour when we
[55:25] can feed upon the word word and the
[55:27] spirit of God in you that's what it
[55:29] needs is to feed upon
[55:33] that so you to draw your desires he said
[55:36] there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost
[55:38] he said now if you want the evidence of
[55:39] the Holy Ghost there it is that your
[55:41] soul that soul of yours will line with
[55:43] the word of God in every respect it
[55:45] shows you've drawed your life through
[55:47] the thinking man's filter God's filter

[56:58] said you know that was the
[57:00] truth you were always the seed was in

[57:08] before the foundation of the world and
[57:10] the word and you come to it when you
[57:13] heard it you come to it because you and
[57:15] the word amen the word that you heard
[57:18] predestinated it was predestinated for
[57:20] this age and you were predestinated for
[57:23] this age and God placed that seed within
[57:25] you he placed that word deposit upon you

[57:31] word the word that was allotted for this
[57:33] age amen it struck something in you amen
[57:36] you could hear all kinds of things but
[57:38] when that word came when that word came

[1:04:17] calls you by his word cleans you up
[1:04:19] sanctifies you by his
[1:04:24] Spirit brother the ROM says here he says
[1:04:27] what kind of people would it be this
[1:04:30] morning if this Bram T Tabernacle this
[1:04:32] morning was so filled with the presence
[1:04:34] of God why when did you ever use your
[1:04:37] own mind and and ever use your own
[1:04:40] thoughts didn't have no uh ultimate
[1:04:42] ultimately of your own just to be led by
[1:04:44] the spirit is that what you want in this
[1:04:46] hour just to be led by the spirit amen
[1:04:50] amen to be led by the spirit of
[1:04:52] God yes sir myad just
[1:04:56] y'all know how these things
[1:05:01] go but brother BR said what the brandom
[1:05:04] Tabernacle does not take your own
[1:05:06] thoughts not take your own
[1:05:08] thoughts but to be so wrapped up in the
[1:05:12] mind of God to be so wrapped up amen
[1:05:15] that's what we want to be here tonight
[1:05:17] amen to be so wrapped up in him
[1:05:22] yes thank you brother Joel yes
[1:05:28] amen he says here when that human
[1:05:30] element goes out and the spirit of God
[1:05:33] fills that vacancy where you empty
[1:05:35] yourself amen then when the church amen
[1:05:38] when in the power of the resurrection of
[1:05:40] the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in
[1:05:43] his power in his thoughts in his being
[1:05:46] in his moving that's where he's trying
[1:05:47] to bring the church in this hour that's
[1:05:49] where he wants to bring you and I where
[1:05:51] our motives where our objectives is just
[1:05:54] to do the will of God where we can draw
[1:05:56] from the supernatural Amen to where we
[1:05:59] can be so cut off from this Earthbound
[1:06:02] from this Le Dean mentality and the of
[1:06:05] the material and the material things of
[1:06:07] this world Amen where our words aren't
[1:06:09] just for nonsense and for Fric amen but
[1:06:12] our thoughts can be his thoughts our
[1:06:14] words can be his words amen where you
[1:06:16] can as the scripture says when you can
[1:06:17] say to this mountain be thou removed yes
[1:06:22] amen he says here when then your
[1:06:24] thoughts will become his word words and
[1:06:26] words will become material and then
[1:06:27] that's when the church is in its power
[1:06:30] yes is that where you want to be tonight
[1:06:31] to draw amen so draw from the mind of
[1:06:34] God so draw from the word of God where
[1:06:37] is deity speaking through you
[1:06:40] yes and S we would see Jesus he says now
[1:06:43] we get ourselves worked in with a human
[1:06:45] element of time and the only thing we
[1:06:48] know is inches feet yards miles
[1:06:49] measurements hours months and years but
[1:06:52] God is eternal we have the limited
[1:06:54] powers and limited elligence but God is
[1:06:57] infinite in all things he knows all
[1:06:59] things he knew all things before the
[1:07:01] world began he knew this meeting would
[1:07:03] be here tonight he know all things was
[1:07:06] there because he could tell the end from
[1:07:08] the beginning that makes him God nothing
[1:07:10] else no one else no other being no other
[1:07:13] person could ever do that but God now we
[1:07:16] sometimes wonder why he's so great and
[1:07:17] yet we don't seem no more than we do oh
[1:07:20] if we could just draw amen from that
[1:07:23] tonight if we could draw from the
[1:07:25] Eternal if we can see him amen as he is
[1:07:28] as God and draw from his omnipotence
[1:07:30] draw from his power amen amen that our
[1:07:33] attitudes could be changed amen draw
[1:07:35] from a God that knows all things amen
[1:07:38] draw from a God that knows your
[1:07:40] situation that's already working
[1:07:42] everything for your good amen he's
[1:07:44] working everything he's got everything
[1:07:46] in control
[1:07:49] yes true we've got to correct our
[1:07:54] thinking yeah we got got to be willing
[1:07:56] to be subject to the filter yes amen we
[1:08:00] got to be willing to come and and and
[1:08:02] say I've been thinking about this wrong
[1:08:04] or I've been seeing this wrong
[1:08:07] right 2 Timothy 3
[1:08:12] and16 all scripture is given by
[1:08:14] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:08:17] Doctrine for Repro for correction for
[1:08:20] instruction in righteousness that the
[1:08:22] man of God may be perfect thorough
[1:08:25] furnished unto all good works so it's
[1:08:29] the it's the inspired word amen the
[1:08:32] scripture amen was given by inspiration
[1:08:35] it is to us the inspired word and
[1:08:38] brother R says salvation is not based
[1:08:40] upon what someone else thinks it's what
[1:08:43] it's what you think of him Divine
[1:08:45] Healing isn't based on what the critics
[1:08:47] say or what the church says it's based
[1:08:49] on your perfect faith in the inspired
[1:08:53] word of God and how your inspired to
[1:08:55] believe that's what brings the results
[1:08:58] is your inspiration by the word what
[1:09:01] does it do for you what does it do for
[1:09:04] you that that's the question that he ask
[1:09:05] what does it do for you and I amen is it
[1:09:08] where we draw our inspiration from is it
[1:09:11] is it where we draw our life and our
[1:09:13] breath from is it more is it more than
[1:09:16] life to you that's what it's got to
[1:09:18] become amen it's got to be more than
[1:09:20] food it's got to be more than drink it's
[1:09:22] got to be more than a good time amen but
[1:09:24] it's got to be something that that you
[1:09:26] need to sustain you something that's
[1:09:28] lifegiving Amen in this hour that's what
[1:09:31] we've got to have something that
[1:09:33] inspires us something that we can feed
[1:09:35] upon something that will lift us up out
[1:09:37] of our condition amen something that'll
[1:09:40] that'll make us say man a th 50 times
[1:09:43] whatever it takes amen amen amen
[1:09:45] something that we can enter into
[1:09:47] something that that rings a bell
[1:09:49] something that strikes inside of you it
[1:09:51] says amen that's for me amen that that's
[1:09:54] who I can be the the word the word has
[1:09:56] it amen and I can have it
[1:10:00] yes yes sir I'm just preaching
[1:10:05] tonight you love the
[1:10:07] Lord so we draw we draw from the
[1:10:11] inspired word yes and every bit of it's
[1:10:15] inspired you believe that yes every bit
[1:10:17] of it's inspired not all my words are
[1:10:20] inspired but you can bet every bit of
[1:10:22] that is inspired that is God and letter
[1:10:24] form and you can draw from that Jesus
[1:10:28] said my words are spirit and they are
[1:10:31] life and there's virtue that we can draw
[1:10:33] from those things amen we can receive
[1:10:36] from God's inspired word and that's what
[1:10:38] changes amen when when inspiration
[1:10:40] strikes the believer amen and taking God
[1:10:43] at his word amen it changes your
[1:10:45] attitude it changes your situation it
[1:10:48] changes your outcome do you believe that
[1:10:52] in his word he says if if by my stri
[1:10:55] you're healed I can be inspired by that
[1:10:58] amen that inspires me because I believe
[1:11:00] that's true I believe that's for me if
[1:11:03] he said I can be saved by his grace and
[1:11:06] then I can be saved you can be saved if
[1:11:08] he said he's the same yesterday today
[1:11:10] and forever amen that he's not the I am
[1:11:13] or the I was but he's the I am I can
[1:11:15] draw inspiration amen that he's the same
[1:11:18] yesterday today and forever and I can
[1:11:21] look for that in my situations I can
[1:11:23] look for that in my circumstances I can
[1:11:25] look for that in this service here amen
[1:11:27] and know that there's needs among us
[1:11:29] know that there's people that need God
[1:11:31] and know that he's the same if he ever
[1:11:33] healed if he ever saved amen he's still
[1:11:36] in the healing and saving
[1:11:41] business yes
[1:11:43] sir
[1:11:46] amen we're
[1:11:48] drawing inspiration from the inspired
[1:11:51] word it's life sustaining strength do
[1:11:54] you believe that amen he says
[1:11:57] here he says here that it's Prof
[1:12:01] profitable for Doctrine for reprove for
[1:12:04] correction amen we need all those things
[1:12:07] don't we we need to hear those things we
[1:12:09] need to hear Doctrine because we want to
[1:12:11] know what what the right kind of
[1:12:13] Doctrine is and Doctrine will give you
[1:12:16] instruction it'll give you direction
[1:12:18] that you know how to operate that you
[1:12:20] know what's right that you know how to
[1:12:22] believe that you know how to stand right
[1:12:25] yes amen we've got to be able to to
[1:12:27] follow
[1:12:29] instructions and and my son he likes to
[1:12:31] build Legos and if you're going to build
[1:12:33] those things you got to follow the
[1:12:35] instructions you can't just rip all the
[1:12:37] bags open maybe maybe some of y'all can
[1:12:39] but I can't you take one bag at a time
[1:12:43] one two three my son he likes to rip all
[1:12:46] of them open and and throw them together
[1:12:48] and you got a
[1:12:50] mess but you've got to follow the
[1:12:52] instructions and if we don't follow the
[1:12:54] instruction in of the word if we don't
[1:12:56] follow the instructions of what a
[1:12:58] messenger taught we're going to have a
[1:13:00] mess you're going to you're going to
[1:13:01] build you're going to build something
[1:13:03] and you're going to get so far up and
[1:13:05] you're going to realize that something's
[1:13:06] just a little bit off and if you would
[1:13:08] have taken your time and and followed
[1:13:10] the instructions you could have built
[1:13:12] the thing up as you went but what what
[1:13:15] we've got to do if we built something
[1:13:16] wrong we got to tear that thing down
[1:13:18] we've got to tear down we've got to come
[1:13:20] back to the right Doctrine we've got to
[1:13:22] come back in under correction of the
[1:13:23] word and build that hang up properly it
[1:13:26] can be done it can be done but you got
[1:13:28] to be willing we've got to be willing to
[1:13:31] break ourselves down amen when when we
[1:13:33] come confronted with something where
[1:13:34] we're wrong we got to be willing to be
[1:13:36] humble we've got to be willing to to
[1:13:38] tear ourselves apart to be built back up
[1:13:42] right
[1:13:43] right so we need these things we need we
[1:13:47] need the correction and the true
[1:13:49] teaching of the
[1:13:53] word and so he he said it's it's
[1:13:55] profitable for reprove something that
[1:13:58] would bring conviction correction that
[1:14:01] word correction restoration to an
[1:14:04] upright State a correction an
[1:14:08] improvement of life or
[1:14:10] character amen we need to be constantly
[1:14:14] reminded constantly reminded of these
[1:14:16] things you say I've heard these things
[1:14:18] over and over over and over well maybe
[1:14:20] the person next to you hasn't heard it
[1:14:23] maybe these young people haven't heard
[1:14:25] the things that we've heard through the
[1:14:26] years and so you think why is the
[1:14:27] preacher preaching about that why is he
[1:14:29] that's so Elementary well there's a lot
[1:14:31] of young people here right they've got
[1:14:34] to hear the things that we heard they've
[1:14:36] got to they've got to come and on the
[1:14:39] right foundation and I pray that we can
[1:14:41] give them the right kind of foundation
[1:14:43] the foundation that was laid by The
[1:14:45] Prophet by the apostles and our lord
[1:14:48] Jesus to be built up Amen to be the
[1:14:50] Oracles of God to be the household of
[1:14:52] God Amen where the Holy Ghost can come
[1:14:55] down and where the Holy Ghost can come
[1:14:57] down and indwell in that house that's
[1:15:00] the TR the kind of house we're trying to
[1:15:02] build I'm just preaching tonight Lord
[1:15:04] help
[1:15:07] me instruction and
[1:15:11] righteousness amen the state of him who
[1:15:14] is as he ought to be to be right with
[1:15:17] God that's what his righteousness is to
[1:15:20] make us right with God who wants to be
[1:15:22] right with God I don't want to be on the
[1:15:25] wrong side I want to be right so we've
[1:15:27] got to come under the correction of the
[1:15:29] word we've got to come under the
[1:15:30] teaching of the word yes to to bring us
[1:15:34] to a state approved of God to bring us a
[1:15:38] place of integrity and virtue a purity
[1:15:40] of Life a rightness and correctness of
[1:15:44] thinking brother R had a slogan he said
[1:15:47] think right that's your duty to
[1:15:49] yourself do right that's your duties to
[1:15:52] God so think his thoughts Bible says if
[1:15:55] there be any virtue if there be any
[1:15:57] praise think on these things Amen Let
[1:16:00] the Holy Spirit take the word and
[1:16:03] correct our human flaws the Bible says
[1:16:06] whatsoever you do in word or indeed do
[1:16:08] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen if
[1:16:11] you can't do it in his name then don't
[1:16:13] do it at all if there's a question where
[1:16:15] something's right or wrong then don't do
[1:16:17] it right Ain that what brother R
[1:16:21] Todd or we just say
[1:16:23] wwjd what would Jesus do right as simple
[1:16:28] as it is and what what would he
[1:16:32] do Lord help me to do that yeah Proverbs
[1:16:38] 3:11 my son despise not the chastening
[1:16:41] of the Lord neither be weary of his
[1:16:44] correction for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:16:45] corrected corrected even as a father the
[1:16:48] son in whom he delighted so love love is
[1:16:50] corrective right and we correct our
[1:16:53] children not because we hate them or
[1:16:55] because we want to be mean to them but
[1:16:56] because we love them if they're out
[1:16:58] playing in the street and where they
[1:17:00] ought not be we're not going to go out
[1:17:01] there and say well you can you can play
[1:17:03] out here if you want no we're going to
[1:17:04] be Stern we're going to say don't play
[1:17:06] in the street because we're trying to
[1:17:08] protect you so love is corrective am man
[1:17:11] if our children are harm In Harm's Way
[1:17:14] it constrains us to correct them we
[1:17:16] don't want to do it but but we must do
[1:17:18] it if they're doing something if they're
[1:17:19] doing something wrong you've got to show
[1:17:21] them where they're doing wrong by love
[1:17:25] and many times when when we as Sons and
[1:17:28] Daughters of God when we do wrong or sin
[1:17:30] it's because of a wrong
[1:17:33] attitude right it's because of a wrong
[1:17:36] attitude amen how many of us have ever
[1:17:39] found ourselves with just a such a
[1:17:41] Negative atmosphere and a bad attitude
[1:17:43] and that will drive the very spirit of
[1:17:46] God from your life a bad attitude of of
[1:17:50] of what somebody done done against you
[1:17:53] or just the way things are going or or
[1:17:55] you didn't like that this was said or
[1:17:56] whatever and a lot of times when
[1:17:59] something's done that person didn't mean
[1:18:01] to do it they didn't really know what
[1:18:02] they were saying but we took it just a
[1:18:04] little too far and we become in a bad
[1:18:06] attitude and we said things and we done
[1:18:09] things that we Lord help us Lord help us
[1:18:12] tonight but that will drive the very
[1:18:15] Holy Spirit from your life the holy
[1:18:17] spirit is gentle like a dove and it
[1:18:20] takes brother R said it takes acting
[1:18:22] like a lamb again for that Holy Spirit
[1:18:24] to come back Paul told the Ephesian
[1:18:27] Church grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:18:29] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[1:18:31] Redemption so you can grieve that
[1:18:35] away the dove will take its
[1:18:38] flight right yes Ephesians
[1:18:43] 4:31 he says let all bitterness and
[1:18:45] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:18:47] speaking be put away you from you with
[1:18:50] all
[1:18:51] malice and be ye kind one to another
[1:18:55] verse 32 tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:18:57] another even as Christ's sake ha
[1:19:00] forgiven you so let all bitterness leave
[1:19:05] and that bitter bitterness is like a
[1:19:07] like a bitter
[1:19:08] fruit any of you ever took a a Pon they
[1:19:13] looked real orange they look good they
[1:19:15] look mushy even but you bite down and
[1:19:18] it's still
[1:19:19] bitter it wasn't R yet it was
[1:19:22] bitter but the the bitterness and the
[1:19:25] sweetness has left him he said remove
[1:19:28] all malice and and that word malice is
[1:19:31] to do to have ill will to desire to
[1:19:36] injure amen that that uh he said it's
[1:19:39] wickedness that is not ashamed to break
[1:19:42] the law now Jesus wouldn't do that would
[1:19:43] he you can't do wwjd there Jesus is not
[1:19:47] going to do that he's not going to have
[1:19:49] ill will and if if you've got ill will
[1:19:51] towards somebody where you know I wish I
[1:19:54] could get by with this if I could just
[1:19:58] you got that ill will if I could just
[1:20:00] take them and you know that's not the
[1:20:04] spirit of
[1:20:06] Christ is it it's not boys beating up on
[1:20:09] each other like that come on
[1:20:13] now boys will be boys m fight all the
[1:20:17] time but that's a fallen nature and when
[1:20:21] they get that that nature it'll take
[1:20:23] that fight out of them amen it'll take
[1:20:26] that malish out of you we like to play
[1:20:29] around there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:30] playing around
[1:20:32] but I W take it too far
[1:20:36] now right a filter somebody says some to
[1:20:41] you somebody does some to you filter
[1:20:42] that thing out let it go let it go it is
[1:20:46] those things aren't Worth to and over
[1:20:49] it's not worth your time it's not worth
[1:20:51] the spirit of God being grieved from you
[1:20:54] right
[1:20:55] and Jesus said forgive amen and you can
[1:20:58] be forgiven and Peter asked one time he
[1:21:00] said how many how many times should I uh
[1:21:03] forgive my brother that that's offended
[1:21:05] me that's done wrong he said seven times
[1:21:08] and Jesus sitting there thinking his
[1:21:09] head I know what Peter's going to do
[1:21:11] seven times and he's done he's going
[1:21:14] to smack
[1:21:16] somebody that's what Peter's thinking
[1:21:18] and Jesus knew this he said no Peter 70

[1:24:49] that word humility there is humbleness
[1:24:51] of Mind loneliness of mind to have a
[1:24:54] humble opinion of oneself a deep sense
[1:24:57] of moral littleness modesty a loneliness
[1:25:00] of mind but God resists the proud and
[1:25:05] that word resist there is to ra to to
[1:25:07] range and and battle against to oppose

[1:26:05] thyself you know people want power and
[1:26:08] really they don't know what power is
[1:26:09] they don't know really what goes with it
[1:26:11] the Way Up Is Down always if you want

[1:27:09] Jesus he says here in expectation we
[1:27:11] always get what we expect when people
[1:27:13] expect anything well they usually get
[1:27:15] you usually get what you look for it's
[1:27:17] the mental attitude that you have
[1:27:19] remember this and never forget the right
[1:27:21] mental attitude towards any promise of
[1:27:24] God will bring it to pass the right
[1:27:26] mental attitude he says it doesn't take
[1:27:27] Gifts of healing to heal the sick people
[1:27:30] he says any person in here has a right
[1:27:32] to meet Satan anywhere if you're a
[1:27:34] Christian and to feed him on the grounds
[1:27:37] that he could stand on you believe that
[1:27:39] tonight he said if you can look right at
[1:27:41] it and believe it the way it's written
[1:27:44] and say God it's your word and take the
[1:27:46] right mental attitude that Divine
[1:27:48] promise it'll bring it to pass he said

[1:28:16] of
[1:28:16] that all right he said when the true
[1:28:19] spirit of God can come in on the word is
[1:28:21] being preached Faith cometh by hearing
[1:28:23] hearing the word of of God and the true
[1:28:25] spirit of God gets a hold of that word
[1:28:28] it'll manifest every promise that God
[1:28:30] has made it'll bring it to pass amen

[1:29:10] 15:21 and Jesus went then and departed
[1:29:13] in the coast of tiar and sidon Behold a
[1:29:16] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[1:29:19] coast and Cried unto him saying have
[1:29:22] mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my
[1:29:27] daughter is vexed grievously with the
[1:29:30] devil but he answered her not a word and
[1:29:34] his disciples came beside him saying
[1:29:36] send her away for she crith after us but
[1:29:39] he answered and said I am not sent but
[1:29:41] unto the lost sheep of the House of

[1:29:56] and said is it not meat to take the
[1:29:57] children's bread and cast it to the dogs
[1:29:59] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat
[1:30:02] of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:30:04] master's table then Jesus answered and
[1:30:06] said to her woman great is thy faith be
[1:30:09] it unto the even as thou Wilt and her
[1:30:11] daughter was made whole from that very
[1:30:14] hour this woman had a serious
