[8:37] we have we share the same inheritance
[8:40] because we are
[8:43] sons of god
[8:45] this morning i want to speak on the late
[8:47] topic
[8:48] knowing who you are
[8:51] knowing who we are
[8:53] it is very important to know who we are
[8:57] if a man knows who he is or she is
[9:01] it influence whatever he does
[9:06] his way of speaking
[9:08] his way of dressing
[9:10] his way of behaving among people
[9:14] shows who
[9:16] he or she is
[9:19] and this can only be done if he knows
[9:21] who he is
[9:24] if maybe
[9:26] a president comes here
[9:29] knowing that he is a president
[9:32] there are certain things he may not do
[9:35] because he knows that he's a president
[9:38] but if he
[9:39] is not
[9:40] or he he doesn't know who
[9:43] he is
[9:44] he may do things
[9:46] and people will start questioning is it
[9:48] not the president he's not this man
[9:51] why is he behaving this why is he doing
[9:53] this
[9:55] amen
[9:56] i understand there are many things we do
[9:58] as children of god today
[9:59] is because we forget who we are
[10:03] tonight i want us to know who we are
[10:06] if we know who we are then we know our
[10:08] position
[10:09] and the prophet said
[10:11] our position
[10:12] is our authority
[10:16] amen
[10:18] in a message
[10:20] entitled
[10:22] jesus
[10:24] christ the same
[10:27] the prophet
[10:29] made a statement here i want to ask to
[10:32] read
[10:33] he said i've often said
[10:35] i met two classes of people
[10:39] in my times around the world
[10:41] in mission work i met two classes of
[10:44] people
[10:45] one of them
[10:46] is pentecostal
[10:49] the other one is founder mentor
[10:52] the fundamentals positionally know
[10:56] where they stand
[10:58] he takes it by the word
[11:00] i am a son of god
[11:03] by my confession see
[11:06] he positionally
[11:08] takes
[11:09] the stand
[11:11] but he's got
[11:13] no faith in what
[11:15] he is talking about
[11:16] hallelujah
[11:18] they claim they are sons of gods
[11:21] their confesses yes but unfortunately
[11:25] they don't have faith
[11:27] in what they are confessing
[11:31] hallelujah
[11:32] if we don't have faith in what we are
[11:34] confessing
[11:36] then it means that
[11:38] we don't know what we are saying
[11:41] we must be able to have faith in
[11:44] whatsoever we confess we need to have
[11:46] faith in our position we need to have
[11:49] faith in whom we are
[11:51] then of course we can have authority
[11:54] to act to behave
[11:56] like that person
[11:59] but this class of people
[12:01] the prophet said
[12:04] they don't have faith but they confess
[12:06] yes
[12:10] amen
[12:13] there he got no faith in what
[12:15] he's talking about
[12:17] the pentecostal has no
[12:19] not
[12:20] has
[12:22] the pentecostal has a lot
[12:24] of faith but don't know where this where
[12:27] he stands
[12:29] he don't know who he is
[12:32] it's just like a man
[12:36] has got money in the bank
[12:38] and he don't know how to write a check
[12:43] and the other man write a check
[12:45] and and got money in the bank
[12:52] one class of
[12:54] people
[12:55] the prophet said
[12:58] they
[12:59] have money in the bank
[13:02] but unfortunately for them
[13:04] they don't know how to write the check
[13:07] the other people
[13:09] don't have money in the bank
[13:11] but they have
[13:13] they know how to write a cheque
[13:15] he's talking about the fundamentals
[13:18] and the pentecostals
[13:21] he said
[13:26] and the fundamentals and and fundamental
[13:29] doctrine
[13:31] or vice versa make the pentecostal
[13:33] realize who they are
[13:35] they are sons and doctors of god
[13:38] already
[13:39] dead buried rose again and sitting in
[13:42] heavenly places
[13:44] have healthy places in christ jesus
[13:47] not you would
[13:49] you are
[13:52] amen
[13:52] [Music]
[13:54] we need to know who we are
[13:57] even
[13:59] like the prophet said
[14:01] the fundamentals
[14:04] and the pentecostals
[14:07] there's something
[14:09] yes that is lacking
[14:10] lacking
[14:13] in the two of them
[14:15] they all lack something
[14:17] but i want to say this morning
[14:20] that
[14:21] we need
[14:22] to have a money in the bank
[14:24] and we need to know how to write a check
[14:27] yes
[14:28] amen is that if the two come together
[14:32] yes then we are sons
[14:34] and daughters of god and hate of the
[14:37] kingdom yes
[14:39] we have to claim our rights
[14:42] event
[14:44] we don't allow the devil to press us
[14:46] down
[14:48] we are
[14:50] the children of god
[14:53] god said it
[14:55] he made it
[14:57] and the devil has no right
[15:01] the prophet said
[15:03] he said
[15:04] there are many that are looking at signs
[15:08] or symptoms
[15:09] yes
[15:11] even though the pastor prayed for them
[15:14] they come back
[15:16] when they are asked how do you feel
[15:18] he said somehow i'm feeling better
[15:21] they are still looking at signs they are
[15:24] still looking at symptoms yes
[15:27] the devil
[15:29] always uses symptoms against us
[15:34] but symptoms have nothing to do
[15:37] once god said you are healed you are
[15:39] healed
[15:40] once god said you are delivered you are
[15:42] delivered yes one god says you are a son
[15:45] of god you are a son of god
[15:50] we need not to look at
[15:51] the symptoms
[15:53] the symptoms
[15:54] are deceitful
[15:57] the symptoms
[15:58] discourages us
[16:00] the symptoms
[16:04] take us from
[16:06] claiming the promises of god
[16:10] if we go to the days of jonah
[16:13] the scripture made us to know that
[16:16] god called jonah as his servant
[16:19] and sent him to the
[16:20] ninevites to go
[16:23] send a message to them
[16:26] pray to them
[16:28] that they should repent for god is going
[16:30] to destroy
[16:31] the land
[16:33] the scripture said
[16:35] not god ready
[16:37] he took off for the journey
[16:39] but unfortunately for jonah
[16:42] when he arrived
[16:44] at where he was going to take the boat
[16:48] the prophet said
[16:50] he thought of going to vacation
[16:55] in taxes instead of going to nineveh
[16:58] because jonah was a jew
[17:01] and he was sent to the gentiles
[17:04] so the brother said his intention was
[17:07] because god was changing
[17:10] them in 40 days
[17:11] he wait
[17:13] when the days are getting closer
[17:16] then he will go and then when he goes
[17:19] when he preaches
[17:20] they will believe it
[17:22] so when he arrive
[17:24] [Music]
[17:25] at the seaside
[17:27] or the riverside
[17:29] instead of going to take the boat going
[17:31] to
[17:33] to nineveh
[17:34] he took the bulls going to taxes
[17:37] and the scripture said
[17:39] along the line
[17:41] god started hunting him
[17:44] he was running from the presence of god
[17:46] we can run from the presence of god
[17:49] heaven is his throne
[17:51] earth is his fulfilled
[17:53] where can we run from
[17:56] where can we run to from the presence of
[17:58] god
[17:59] jonah thought he was running from the
[18:01] presence of god
[18:02] and the scripture said
[18:04] god started started hunting him
[18:07] and there was tom
[18:10] they did all they could
[18:13] but
[18:14] nothing happened
[18:16] finally they thought of casting a lot
[18:19] knowing very well that he was running
[18:21] from
[18:22] the presence of god he went and hit
[18:24] under the boat
[18:26] having a nice time there relaxing
[18:29] the scripture said
[18:31] they cast a lot in the front of that
[18:34] there's somebody
[18:36] and the lord felt on jonah
[18:39] when it fell on
[18:40] jonah
[18:42] jonah
[18:43] knew what
[18:45] was happening
[18:48] he could have prayed
[18:51] but he never prayed
[18:54] but because he knows that it is not a
[18:56] matter of praying
[18:58] it is a matter of restitution
[19:01] it is a matter of doing what god wanted
[19:04] him to do
[19:05] yes sir
[19:06] so all he told them was
[19:09] i am the cause
[19:10] and the only way we can
[19:12] save the situation
[19:14] is to throw me
[19:16] into the sea
[19:18] jonah was not a simon
[19:20] jonah may not know how to swim
[19:23] but they buy his hands
[19:25] they burn his feet
[19:27] and he threw him into the sea
[19:30] the scripture said
[19:32] in the sea
[19:34] he started praying
[19:36] hallelujah and when he prayed
[19:40] god sent
[19:41] a feast to come and swallowed him
[19:45] and in the feast bella
[19:48] the prophet said
[19:50] jonah could have looked
[19:52] to the symptoms
[19:55] or he could have looked into the belly
[19:57] of the fish
[20:00] but jonah did not look at this
[20:02] he looked at the promise of god
[20:05] he'll look at the word of god
[20:07] because
[20:08] when solomon
[20:10] was dedicating the temple he prayed that
[20:13] every jew that would be in trouble
[20:15] wherever he is
[20:17] if he can turn to the temple and pray
[20:20] god should answer him
[20:22] so jonah in the first ballet
[20:25] managed to turn to
[20:27] the direction of
[20:31] the temple
[20:32] hallelujah and the prophet said
[20:35] jonah could have looked at the symptoms
[20:38] he could have looked at the condition in
[20:40] which he was
[20:42] and this condition would have
[20:43] discouraged him
[20:44] but he did not look at the condition but
[20:47] you look at the promises of god
[20:49] he look at what god said
[20:52] brethren says the lord it is time we
[20:54] stop looking at the symptoms
[20:58] and look at the promises of god
[21:01] he that has made the promise he is able
[21:03] to fulfill it
[21:05] even though he carries he will surely do
[21:07] it because he is god
[21:12] praise the lord
[21:14] sojourner started praying
[21:17] and the prophet said
[21:19] god instructed the fish
[21:22] that he should send jonah to navy
[21:25] and at that time
[21:26] the
[21:29] uh fishermen
[21:30] the ninevites
[21:33] they were fishermen
[21:34] they were washing their nets out of
[21:36] seaside
[21:38] behold
[21:40] their fish came around
[21:42] and the prophet that fish was the feast
[21:45] that they worshiped
[21:47] and when he came informing jonah
[21:50] jonah preached
[21:52] they believed
[21:55] they prayed they
[21:56] fasted they were so close
[21:59] and god also repented from heaven
[22:03] god stopped
[22:04] what he was going to do
[22:07] brendan said lord
[22:09] the prophet said jonah could have looked
[22:11] at the symptoms
[22:13] he was bind
[22:16] his feet was burned
[22:18] his legs were bind
[22:20] his hands were burned
[22:22] but he never looked at the symptoms
[22:25] sometimes when we look at the symptoms
[22:28] it discourages us
[22:31] it makes us not to have faith
[22:34] it brings doubt into our life
[22:37] and as a result
[22:39] the promises of god cannot be made
[22:41] manifest in our life
[22:43] brethren say lord
[22:45] it depends on what we are looking at
[22:48] amen
[22:49] don't look at who you are but look at
[22:52] the promises of god
[22:54] look at the covenant that god has made
[22:57] with you
[22:59] amen
[23:01] he thought himself in calvary
[23:06] and he swore by himself
[23:11] he took his body to heaven
[23:14] and he returned his spirit upon us
[23:18] he gave us his spirit back
[23:21] the spirit of god is in the church
[23:24] to lead the church
[23:26] the same life that was in christ
[23:29] is in the church now
[23:31] it's in the church this morning
[23:33] in the form of the holy spirit
[23:37] growing to perform the very things that
[23:39] he performed where he was here on earth
[23:41] because he's the same yesterday today
[23:43] and forever
[23:46] we got a promise
[23:48] we got a covenant
[23:50] let us know that we are covenant men
[23:54] we are not just an ordinary people
[23:57] we are covenant people
[23:59] we are sons and doctors of god
[24:02] we need to know who we are
[24:04] we need to know our position
[24:07] we need to know our calling
[24:10] we need to know
[24:11] hallelujah what god is doing in our life
[24:15] that is what gives us the authority
[24:19] amend
[24:22] if you don't know who you are
[24:24] you continue to fail
[24:27] and the devil will torment you yes but
[24:30] if you know who you are you realize who
[24:32] you are it makes the devil mad
[24:36] when a child of god a daughter of god
[24:39] realize who he or she is
[24:42] it makes the devil mad
[24:44] hallelujah
[24:45] and it gives us faith
[24:47] it gives us authority

[25:14] position
[25:17] you know your power
[25:19] you can speak
[25:22] the prophet said we can create even
[25:23] another world
[25:25] we can create an
[25:26] atmosphere if we know who we are
[25:31] our problem
[25:33] is not the word of god our problem is
[25:35] not the message
[25:37] our problem is not our brother
[25:39] our problem is not our sister our
[25:42] problem is not our dickens
[25:44] our problem is not our pastor our
[25:46] problem is
[25:48] we do not know who we are
[25:52] let us pray
[25:54] that god give us revelation
[25:57] about who we are
[25:59] the prophet said
[26:02] when we have a revelation when the
[26:05] church gets a true revelation it becomes
[26:07] an invisible army that is why the devil
[26:11] doesn't like revelation but we like
[26:13] revelation
[26:14] because by revelation we defeat the
[26:16] enemy
[26:18] by revelation hallelujah we doubt every
[26:22] we reject every lie of the devil
[26:25] we need revelation we like revelation
[26:28] but the devil hates revelation because
[26:31] with revelation we know the tatties of
[26:34] the devil and the prophet said to
[26:36] overcome the devil is to know the
[26:39] tactics of the devil
[26:42] we are overcomers yes

[27:05] and down

[27:11] but when
[27:12] you move from there
[27:14] and you come to know who you are
[27:17] as a child of god it gives you faith
[27:22] and then you can now enjoy the blessings
[27:24] of god

[27:28] the deliverance you see the power of god
[27:31] in your life you see god moving in your
[27:33] life

[27:40] every unbelief
[27:42] will be taken away
[27:45] my brother my sister
[27:48] unbelievably sin

[27:54] then we live in sin
[27:55] yes and when we know who we are
[27:59] then
[28:00] hallelujah the devil
[28:04] cannot do anything
[28:06] or somebody asked brother abraham a
[28:08] question

[28:27] let us listen to what the prophet said
[28:30] or is it just
[28:32] is this the direction of the holy ghost
[28:36] the prophet said yes
[28:38] it is the direction of the holy ghost
[28:41] if you are a son of god or a doctor of
[28:44] god
[28:45] whatever you are
[28:48] when you have received the holy ghost
[28:51] then the holy ghost will direct you to
[28:54] do things
[28:56] hallelujah when we receive the holy
[28:59] ghost
[29:00] as sons and daughters of god
[29:03] the holy spirit will direct us to do
[29:06] things yes
[29:07] then we don't behave anyhow
[29:11] we wait upon the spirit of the lord
[29:13] the scriptures as many of us are led by
[29:15] the spirit of god they are sons and
[29:18] doctors of god
[29:20] we need the leadings of the spirit
[29:22] in this difficult time that we are
[29:24] living
[29:26] we need
[29:28] the holy ghost
[29:30] to lead us
[29:31] to direct us
[29:33] it is only by the holy ghost that we can
[29:35] please god

[29:51] we are living a time when there are many
[29:53] voices yes there are voices of jesus
[29:56] there are verses of men
[29:58] but to hear the
[30:00] voice of god it takes the holy spirit
[30:04] to hear the voice of god and the voice
[30:07] of god to the children of god
[30:09] is a special thing
[30:11] that is what we need
[30:13] amen
[30:15] therefore
[30:16] as children of god
[30:18] we will be led
[30:20] by the spirit of god
[30:22] we have to realize who we are
[30:25] amen

[30:37] our need
[30:38] he is here to do something special in
[30:41] our life
[30:42] and the only way he can do it is we have
[30:45] to give him the avenue
[30:48] we have to allow him we have to accept
[30:50] him we have to believe him we have to
[30:53] come out from every doubt
[30:56] and know who we are

[31:27] we share his power with him
[31:30] we share his authority with him

[31:36] because we are
[31:38] his wife
[31:40] our wife share our property with us
[31:43] i will share what we have
[31:47] they shared with us
[31:48] so it is with christ
[31:50] if we can recognize
[31:53] if we can know if we can realize
[31:56] that we are the bride of jesus christ
[32:00] living in this end time
[32:03] then we are special people
[32:05] we can live above sin
[32:08] sin can no longer influence us
[32:10] sin cannot dominate us
[32:13] we will be influenced from our path
[32:17] and we will know that
[32:19] we are from a different place that's
[32:21] right
[32:22] brethren this is the lord
[32:26] he promised us
[32:28] and he'll fulfill his promise
[32:31] let us now listen to what the devil is
[32:33] saying
[32:34] the devil is a liar
[32:37] he only bluffs
[32:38] right
[32:40] we are equal with jesus
[32:43] we are in his presence
[32:46] satan doesn't have any right
[32:49] of doing anything
[32:51] because in cavalry
[32:53] he was stripped of yes and the scripture
[32:56] said
[32:57] the last word that jesus said
[33:00] was it is finished
[33:01] yes
[33:03] it is finished
[33:04] i want to assure you this morning that
[33:07] your problem is
[33:08] finished when is that something is
[33:11] finished it means it is ended
[33:14] jesus said it is finished
[33:16] at the cross he says it is finished
[33:19] our sit next problem is finished
[33:22] our same problem is finished
[33:26] everything is finished
[33:28] the devil
[33:30] has no right
[33:32] the devil
[33:33] has no power
[33:36] the
[33:36] devil is just lying
[33:40] it is finished
[33:43] amen
[33:44] once it is finished
[33:46] the devil has no legal right
[33:49] anymore in our life
[33:51] no sir
[33:54] the only thing that is left for us
[33:56] is to believe
[33:58] is to know our position
[34:00] many a times
[34:02] we say it is the devil that has done
[34:04] this
[34:05] it is the devil that has done this
[34:07] it is the devil that has done it let us
[34:10] leave the devil alone
[34:12] for the devil cannot do anything
[34:15] in the life of a child of god no
[34:18] even though god permits the devil to do
[34:20] it
[34:22] god will give it a limit yes
[34:25] the prophet said god can use the devil
[34:27] against the disobedient children of god
[34:30] but god would give him a limit like god
[34:34] gave him a limit in the life of job
[34:37] he said you can destroy everything
[34:40] but you don't have right to his life
[34:42] so we saw the devil did everything to
[34:45] europe
[34:46] but the devil could not take job away
[34:50] because god has given it a limit
[34:53] my brother my sister
[34:55] the devil has no legal right in the life
[34:58] of a child of god
[35:00] therefore let us stop magnifying the
[35:02] devil
[35:03] it is the devil
[35:05] it is the devil no
[35:08] if you knew your position
[35:10] the devil can do nothing in your life
[35:16] and my sickness
[35:17] and my headache has come back again
[35:21] my body pain has come back again
[35:24] my whispering has come back again
[35:29] it shows that you are making that demon
[35:32] your possession
[35:36] the prophet said
[35:37] you see every sickness
[35:40] is a demon
[35:42] even though they might give it a
[35:44] scientific name
[35:46] at the end of the day is the devil in
[35:48] action
[35:49] therefore if we continue to say
[35:52] my sickness
[35:53] my headache
[35:55] my waistband
[35:56] my body pains
[35:59] [Music]
[36:00] then we are still
[36:03] maintaining the devil in our homes
[36:06] in our life
[36:07] now
[36:09] as children of god we have right to cast
[36:12] the devil away
[36:14] to speak yes and stop everything that
[36:17] the devil is doing in our life
[36:19] every sickness
[36:21] every trouble
[36:22] every demon every problem
[36:25] we can speak yes and it will be done
[36:29] hallelujah but before we can speak
[36:33] we need to know who we are
[36:36] amen
[36:38] we need to know we are believers
[36:41] we need to know that
[36:44] the sting
[36:46] of death
[36:49] that the devil god
[36:51] has gone
[36:52] the devil has no strength any longer
[36:56] amen
[36:57] oh my brother my sister
[37:00] let us look at calvary
[37:03] we can show the devil the resurrection
[37:08] the scripture says we reckon ourselves
[37:10] dead
[37:11] we are buried with him
[37:13] in the baptism
[37:15] into his death
[37:16] and we
[37:18] were raised with him in the resurrection
[37:22] now that we are going to be raised with
[37:24] him
[37:25] we are already raised with him
[37:28] and where are we now
[37:29] the scripture said
[37:31] we are with him
[37:33] in the heavenly places
[37:35] at the right hand of god
[37:38] and that is the authority of god
[37:41] amen
[37:43] we are sitting with him in the heavenly
[37:45] places in christ jesus
[37:48] we need to realize that
[37:51] heaven is our place even though we are
[37:53] sitting here this morning
[37:55] we are sitting in the heavenly places
[37:59] as believers
[38:01] we need to take our position in christ
[38:04] we need to stand by our position in
[38:06] christ
[38:08] we need to demonstrate the power of the
[38:10] resurrection
[38:13] and make the devil
[38:15] know that we know who we are
[38:17] and make the devil know we know our
[38:19] position
[38:20] and make the devil know that
[38:22] we know that it has no power
[38:26] amen
[38:27] oh my brother and sister
[38:29] the devil
[38:31] is defeated
[38:33] is defeated
[38:35] every form
[38:37] that is making itself manifest is
[38:39] defeated
[38:41] but our problem is
[38:43] we do not know
[38:46] you know in africa
[38:48] we do buy
[38:50] chickens
[38:52] say you go to the market to buy a
[38:53] chicken
[38:55] you buy the lake
[38:57] and when you buy the lake and you bring
[38:58] it back home
[39:00] you lose the leg
[39:03] but sometimes because the chicken has
[39:04] stayed so long
[39:06] in that rope even though you lose
[39:11] the rope
[39:12] the chicken things is still being bind
[39:16] and it will lie there quietly
[39:19] even though you push it it will not go
[39:22] in this mind
[39:24] i am still being blind
[39:27] that is the problem of many children of
[39:29] god today
[39:31] they've been delivered yeah but
[39:33] because
[39:34] they have suffered so much in
[39:37] in their life and
[39:38] it has created something in the their
[39:41] mentality
[39:43] they never knew that they has been
[39:44] delivered
[39:46] they have been lose
[39:48] they still
[39:49] stand as if they are still buying
[39:52] my brother my sister
[39:54] what the bride of christ needs today is
[39:56] to know who he is
[39:59] and the word that christ has done for us
[40:02] the prophet said
[40:05] he said
[40:06] to
[40:08] sin we know you'll not be condemned for
[40:11] that
[40:12] because sin is some believe
[40:15] he said we'll be condemned because
[40:18] the work that christ did for us
[40:20] we don't recognize it
[40:23] we don't accept it
[40:26] and because of that we crucify him the
[40:28] second time
[40:30] is because we are not conscious of what
[40:32] he has done for us
[40:34] we don't know he has delivered us
[40:37] we don't know he has made a sons and
[40:38] doctors of god
[40:40] that is where we are living under the
[40:43] privileges
[40:44] that god has given us
[40:46] instead of living above the privileges
[40:49] we are living
[40:51] area
[40:53] under the privileges
[40:56] oh what we need today
[40:58] is to know who we are
[41:01] to know our position in christ
[41:04] we should know that we have been
[41:05] delivered
[41:06] we should know that we have been saved
[41:09] we should know that the devil
[41:11] cannot do us anything any longer
[41:14] the devil
[41:16] will just bluff
[41:19] the devil is just like a lion
[41:22] that has no teeth in his mouth
[41:25] it can only rule
[41:29] but it cannot do anything
[41:31] and remember in africa there's a tribe
[41:35] there are cows
[41:37] but they have mouth
[41:40] when you have problems with them
[41:42] they'll be jumping
[41:44] going forward coming back if you don't
[41:46] take care i'll kill you now i'll stamp
[41:48] you i'll do you this
[41:50] and you'll be frightened it's only muff
[41:54] they are just boosting if you can stand
[41:58] they will run away from you
[41:59] that is what the devil is
[42:02] this morning the devil is a defeated
[42:04] fool
[42:06] if we can tell the devil you are
[42:08] defeated in my life
[42:10] you are defeated in my family you are
[42:13] defeated in my home you are defeated in
[42:15] my business
[42:16] you don't have any right again
[42:18] we will start enjoying the blessings of
[42:20] god
[42:24] amen
[42:26] hallelujah
[42:30] know your position
[42:34] praise the lord
[42:38] we have got
[42:40] the power of god in our life yes
[42:43] to do things
[42:45] we could speak the world into existence
[42:48] we have powers church
[42:51] the scriptures say what we buy on earth
[42:54] will be born in heaven
[42:56] god has given his church authority
[42:59] god has given us as children of god sons
[43:02] of god authority
[43:04] he has given us power
[43:06] if we can use them
[43:09] the devil
[43:10] will be defeated
[43:12] anywhere in the ground
[43:14] in any condition
[43:17] all things are possible to them that
[43:19] believe
[43:22] the prophet said we are not called to
[43:24] reason with the word of god
[43:27] we are called to believe the word of god
[43:30] and if we can believe what god says
[43:33] all things are possible
[43:36] and the child of god must be a believer
[43:39] must believe every promise of god
[43:42] must believe every word of god
[43:44] every promise in the bible is ours yes
[43:48] and we have to take it and hope
[43:51] and take god by his word yes
[43:56] it is only when we know who we are
[43:59] god promised joshua
[44:01] he said whatever the soul of your
[44:03] faithful truth
[44:04] will become yours
[44:06] and the prophet said that promise has
[44:09] not gone it has not ended up with jesus
[44:11] right it's still today
[44:13] that every son and doctor of god
[44:16] wherever our feet will truth will become
[44:19] ours
[44:20] amen
[44:22] once we are saved
[44:25] and we are children of god
[44:28] and we know who we are
[44:30] we can overcome the enemy
[44:33] and the scripture said
[44:35] faith
[44:37] is arbitrary
[44:39] and by faith
[44:41] we can overcome the world
[44:43] we're going to overcome
[44:45] the devil
[44:48] we can change things
[44:51] harry lawyer
[44:55] the prophet said
[44:57] he said entirety is not in heaven
[45:01] the entirety is in a believer
[45:05] and he went on to say
[45:07] the believer does not pray to god in
[45:09] heaven
[45:11] we pray to god that is in us
[45:14] and if the deity is in us
[45:17] and god is in us
[45:19] then whatsoever we pray for
[45:22] we need to believe that we have it
[45:25] and we need to realize that the almighty
[45:27] god
[45:28] lives in our life
[45:31] then we have right to life
[45:34] and we have right to everything
[45:36] we have right to every promise of god
[45:39] amen
[45:41] then we know who we are
[45:43] and if we know who we are then we can
[45:46] leave our best scene
[45:50] the prophet said we are loosed from sin
[45:54] and sin has no longer dominion over us
[45:58] we are our best sin
[46:02] sin has no power over us
[46:05] we can make mistakes anyway
[46:07] but thank god that the blood of jesus
[46:09] christ
[46:10] forgive us all our mistakes
[46:12] forgive us our sins
[46:14] a sinner that is one page
[46:16] has no more desire for sin
[46:20] he can make a mistake
[46:21] but he cannot
[46:24] uh sin
[46:25] hallelujah
[46:27] brethren said lord
[46:29] when christ came here
[46:32] he came according to the word of god
[46:35] but before he could exercise his
[46:37] authority
[46:39] he must believe all that the scripture
[46:42] said about him
[46:46] he must act upon the scripture
[46:48] he said i do nothing
[46:50] i said that which i see the father has
[46:52] done
[46:53] i do nothing
[46:55] except what the scriptures
[46:57] says about me
[46:59] told the pharisees and the sadducees
[47:01] you claim you know the bible and you
[47:03] read the bible
[47:05] and in them you have eternal life
[47:08] examine it
[47:10] examine what i'm doing
[47:12] and see
[47:13] if
[47:15] i'm not doing what the scripture said i
[47:16] would do
[47:18] none of you can condemn me
[47:21] he had faith
[47:23] in what the word of god says about him
[47:26] and that is what we need today
[47:29] if the word of god says you are a child
[47:30] of god you have to believe that you're a
[47:32] child of god
[47:34] no matter who you are no matter the
[47:35] condition in which you are once god has
[47:38] said it believe it
[47:40] and when you believe it
[47:42] when god says you are healed believe it
[47:44] and once you believe it and you go
[47:46] confessing it your body
[47:49] will obey it and you see it fulfilled
[47:54] in your life
[47:55] so jesus
[47:57] has to believe what the scripture says
[47:59] about him
[48:00] and we also need to believe what
[48:02] the scripture says about us
[48:04] even god himself the brother said in the
[48:07] message entitled the sixth sense
[48:09] is that when god spoke the word
[48:12] for the word to be fulfilled
[48:14] he delivered it
[48:17] he
[48:18] said
[48:20] be light and he believed it
[48:22] and it was light yes
[48:24] our problem
[48:26] today
[48:28] is that we are not seeing what god has
[48:30] done for us
[48:32] our problem today is
[48:34] we are not believing what god said about
[48:36] us
[48:39] oh
[48:40] there is power
[48:43] in what
[48:44] god says about us if only we can believe
[48:47] it
[48:48] if we can rely upon the word of god
[48:52] another compounds idea not of our idea
[48:56] but what the word of god says about
[48:58] ourselves
[48:59] what the word of god has made us if we
[49:02] can't believe it
[49:04] hallelujah
[49:05] we are always overcomers
[49:10] nothing of the devil
[49:13] can pull us down no
[49:16] as believers
[49:18] let us rely
[49:20] on what god has made us
[49:23] he has made the sons and daughters of
[49:25] god it is not our making
[49:28] it is not your making
[49:30] it is not my making
[49:32] the scripture said
[49:34] at the fullness of time
[49:36] he sent his son
[49:38] because we were sown
[49:41] we were in him before the foundation of
[49:43] the world
[49:44] and the prophet said
[49:45] once we are sung and we were him we have
[49:48] always been songs
[49:51] and at the right time
[49:53] he brought us up
[49:55] and nothing
[49:56] can change us a song is a song
[50:00] like the prodigal son
[50:03] he left
[50:05] he took
[50:06] his share of the inheritance
[50:08] he went and lived in a lie that he
[50:11] thought he could leave
[50:14] but he lose the properties but he could
[50:16] not lose his sonship
[50:19] when he came back
[50:20] when the father saw him after the
[50:22] scripture said he said this my son was
[50:25] dead
[50:26] but now he's alive
[50:29] he's come back again oh my brother my
[50:32] sister once you are a son and a doctor
[50:35] of god nothing can take you out of it
[50:39] if you back light at all at the
[50:41] appropriate time god will bring you back
[50:44] but the scripture said
[50:46] the father said
[50:48] let us feast
[50:51] let us make merry
[50:53] because our son
[50:55] was dead
[50:56] but now
[50:57] he's alive
[50:59] he couldn't lose his sonship
[51:01] you cannot lose your sonship
[51:04] stop listening to the devil
[51:06] stop listening to the life of the devil
[51:10] you cannot lose it once you are son
[51:13] you are a son once you are a doctor you
[51:16] are a daughter of god
[51:17] because you were part of him
[51:20] he knew you before the foundation of the
[51:21] world
[51:23] and at the right time the right
[51:25] disposition
[51:27] he brought you up
[51:29] amen
[51:31] and
[51:32] not only are we his sons
[51:35] but we are his wife
[51:38] we are married to him
[51:40] we are married to the word
[51:42] and we are living in the word
[51:45] we are living in christ and if we are
[51:47] living in christ
[51:49] who is perfect
[51:51] then we are also perfect
[51:54] oh my brother my sister
[51:57] there is nobody
[52:00] that can condemn you
[52:02] once you are in christ
[52:04] even the devil
[52:07] the prophet said
[52:08] before the devil
[52:10] can do you something
[52:13] the devil need to go through these
[52:14] processes
[52:17] the devil need to repent
[52:19] the devil needs to be justified
[52:23] the devil needs sanctification
[52:26] and the devil needs the baptism of the
[52:28] holy spirit before it can come to where
[52:31] you are and once the devil goes to this
[52:33] prophet these processes
[52:35] before he reaches you
[52:37] it becomes your brother
[52:39] he becomes your sister
[52:41] amen
[52:42] oh my brother my sister
[52:45] we need to know who we are
[52:49] that is our problems
[52:51] if we know who we are
[52:54] then we can be identified with jesus
[52:56] christ
[52:57] we can be identified with the word then
[53:00] we can stand in the word
[53:05] because we are sons
[53:07] the scripture said
[53:09] he sent the spirit of his son
[53:11] into our hearts
[53:14] because we are sons
[53:16] because we've been sons
[53:18] because we are always sounds
[53:21] he sent the spirit of his sons into our
[53:23] hearts
[53:24] christ came and died
[53:27] to have this purpose accomplished
[53:31] to restore it back to our original
[53:34] position
[53:35] our position of being sonship
[53:38] our possession of some
[53:40] being sons of god
[53:42] being the test of god
[53:44] he came
[53:45] and he paid the price
[53:48] hallelujah
[53:49] and he purchased us
[53:52] he redeem us
[53:54] back to
[53:55] our position as sons and doctors of god
[53:59] all we need is to accept it
[54:02] all we need is to believe it
[54:05] all we need is to walk into it
[54:07] all we need is to walk by it all we need
[54:10] is to confess it all we need is to
[54:13] believe it
[54:14] all we need is to see it
[54:17] oh brother sister
[54:19] a gift is not a gift
[54:22] until it is
[54:23] received yes
[54:26] amen
[54:28] the brothers a pardon is not pardoned
[54:30] until it is received as a pardon
[54:34] oh my brother my sister
[54:37] we need to recognize where we are
[54:40] we need to know our position we need to
[54:43] know who we are
[54:45] the scripture says
[54:47] because we were songs
[54:49] not because we are going to be songs
[54:52] because we were sung
[54:54] he sent the spirit of sonship into our
[54:56] hearts
[54:58] hallelujah
[54:59] oh
[55:02] this morning
[55:03] he has a purpose in your life yes
[55:06] whether you are small
[55:08] whether you are big
[55:10] whether you are important
[55:12] whether you are not important
[55:15] no matter who you are
[55:17] hallelujah
[55:19] he has a purpose in your life
[55:21] that is why he brings you here this
[55:23] morning
[55:26] there are people in the churches
[55:29] they think
[55:31] that we are nothing
[55:32] i want to tell you this morning that you
[55:34] are something
[55:37] god needed you here that is brought you
[55:39] here
[55:40] i remember there was
[55:42] i had a problem at home
[55:45] we left the key in the room
[55:49] and we locked the door
[55:52] there's no way we can
[55:54] get to the room
[55:56] and we didn't have the spare key
[55:59] but at
[56:00] home the windows we do it with bar and
[56:04] there are space inside
[56:06] just
[56:07] to avoid the teeth from breaking into it
[56:11] so finally what we thought was
[56:14] we have our little child
[56:17] we carried it
[56:19] we put the head through the bar
[56:22] and the head went through
[56:25] so we managed and put the child through
[56:27] the window through the bar and the child
[56:31] went
[56:32] there to go and pick the key where the
[56:33] key was that i went and picked the key
[56:36] brought it will receive it and we open
[56:38] the door
[56:41] i asked myself that day
[56:44] there is nobody
[56:47] that we can say is of no use
[56:51] this little child
[56:53] has saved us from this embarrassment
[56:56] this little child
[56:58] has saved us from breaking the door
[57:01] buying another lock
[57:05] we couldn't do it
[57:08] because we are too big to go through
[57:11] the window but that little child our
[57:13] child
[57:15] was small
[57:16] at that age
[57:18] and it could go through
[57:20] to go bring the key
[57:21] all i want to say this morning is
[57:24] don't look down upon yourself
[57:26] don't underestimate yourself
[57:29] don't say i am nothing you are something
[57:32] you are special to god
[57:34] he has your name written in the land
[57:37] book of life before the foundation of
[57:39] the world
[57:41] because of you he came down
[57:43] because of you he went to calvary
[57:45] he took your place
[57:50] instead of you being condemned
[57:52] instead of you being
[57:54] being crucified he said no
[57:56] let me take his place
[57:58] bring all his accusation upon me
[58:02] everything that he did
[58:04] put it into my account
[58:06] and he died for us
[58:09] oh my brother my sister
[58:11] paul looked at it and he said we are
[58:14] expensive
[58:16] because
[58:18] we are bought with the price
[58:23] recognize who you are
[58:25] recognize your position i always say if
[58:28] we recognize our position we recognize
[58:31] who we are
[58:33] that's not going to be fine there's no
[58:34] good quadrant
[58:36] there's not going to be a problem
[58:38] we will fit
[58:40] to where god
[58:42] wants us to be
[58:45] we will not start
[58:47] impersonation
[58:49] we will not
[58:50] start copying somebody
[58:53] because we know what we are able to do
[58:56] we know what our brother is able to do
[58:58] we know we need our brother
[59:01] and he also need us in a way
[59:03] that is how god made it
[59:05] therefore this morning
[59:06] no matter who you are
[59:08] whether you are little
[59:10] whether you are big
[59:12] whether you are poor whether you are
[59:14] rich whether you are important whether
[59:16] you are not important
[59:18] we are all sons and doctors of god
[59:25] jesus christ when he was here
[59:29] he
[59:31] spoke of
[59:32] a rich man
[59:35] who wanted
[59:38] to celebrate the feast
[59:41] marriage field
[59:42] for the doctor
[59:45] and what he did was
[59:48] he make sure
[59:50] that he has dresses
[59:53] packed at the gate
[59:56] whosoever
[59:58] comes to the feast must go through the
[1:00:00] gate
[1:00:02] you remove your dress
[1:00:04] whether it be expensive dress whether
[1:00:06] it's poor you remove it and they'll give
[1:00:08] you address there
[1:00:10] everyone that comes through the door
[1:00:13] has to receive
[1:00:15] address and the prophet said
[1:00:18] that dress is the holy spirit
[1:00:22] he wants everybody to be of the same
[1:00:28] the same position the same dress
[1:00:33] there's no there's not going to be
[1:00:35] discrimination
[1:00:37] there's not going to be a big man
[1:00:38] there's not going to be a small man
[1:00:40] but unfortunately for a man
[1:00:42] instead of passing through the gate
[1:00:45] he
[1:00:46] he climbed over
[1:00:48] and when the feast was
[1:00:50] at his peak
[1:00:54] this man
[1:00:55] went around
[1:00:58] and he saw him he said gentleman
[1:01:04] by which way did you come in
[1:01:07] he said i climb over
[1:01:10] he ordered his servants
[1:01:12] to bind him
[1:01:14] by leg
[1:01:16] by feet
[1:01:18] by hands
[1:01:20] and throw him into total
[1:01:22] darkness and the prophet said
[1:01:25] that there's only one way
[1:01:28] and that is jesus christ
[1:01:30] we cannot come by any other way
[1:01:33] he said i'm the life the truth
[1:01:36] i'm the way the life and the truth
[1:01:38] no one comes to the father except by me
[1:01:42] if we can go through the door
[1:01:45] then we are all going to be dressed
[1:01:47] alive
[1:01:49] don't
[1:01:51] underestimate yourself
[1:01:54] know who you are this morning
[1:01:57] live
[1:02:00] by
[1:02:01] your god-given privileges
[1:02:05] the brother said when we
[1:02:07] repented
[1:02:08] when we believed christ
[1:02:11] all that we need
[1:02:13] for the journey
[1:02:14] he gave it to us as a package
[1:02:17] all that we needed to
[1:02:19] to to travel the way he gave us to us as
[1:02:22] a package
[1:02:24] therefore
[1:02:26] let us recognize ourselves
[1:02:29] let us recognize who we are
[1:02:32] as i bring my meeting to an end
[1:02:34] of my sermon to an end
[1:02:39] my question is
[1:02:42] do we know who we are
[1:02:45] let
[1:02:46] us come
[1:02:48] out let us away from our slumber
[1:02:52] and let us
[1:02:54] know our position
[1:02:56] let us know who we are
[1:02:58] and let us believe who we
[1:03:00] are
[1:03:02] let us not allow the devil to deceive us
[1:03:05] in any way
[1:03:06] the devil is always a liar
[1:03:09] there has never been a liar like the
[1:03:10] devil
[1:03:11] it will continue to deceive and to lie
[1:03:14] yes it's a devil it's a liar to begin
[1:03:17] with

[1:03:49] morning

[1:03:52] one of these days won't see them again
[1:03:55] because
