[33:17] being so kind to us you'll notice my
[33:21] family is not here again this morning
[33:22] but the quarantine for them ends
[33:24] tomorrow and so we'll finally be out of
[33:27] that and you've been so kind and some of
[33:29] you have dropped off things at the house
[33:31] and done things for us like that and I
[33:34] really appreciate that you don't know
[33:36] how much that means to me and and if I
[33:38] don't get the chance to thank each one
[33:39] of you individually thank you for what
[33:41] you've done and for your prayers during
[33:43] this time and like we said Wednesday
[33:46] night we come out and got the head of
[33:48] Goliath and we've overcome this we we
[33:52] know what it's like to do battle and
[33:54] Paul said I fought the Beast at Ephesus
[33:56] but I've been there and the fact that
[33:58] I'm still alive means that God still
[34:01] heals and he still delivers and we're so
[34:04] grateful for that and grateful for his
[34:06] presence in our life
[34:07] and him doing what he does I wanted to
[34:11] say congratulations about the Caleb and
[34:13] sister Sophie not here this morning but
[34:14] with their baby and being born and so if
[34:17] they watch this congratulations and to
[34:19] them little Henry I believe his name is
[34:22] and we're always grateful Lord adds to
[34:24] the church the way he wants to so but no
[34:28] that's a wonderful time for them and
[34:30] then next Sunday just so everyone knows
[34:36] next Sunday we're going to have
[34:38] communion the Lord willing at 3 o'clock
[34:41] so we'll have a service at 10:00 our
[34:43] regular service at 10:00 and then
[34:45] communion 2 3 we won't have foot a foot
[34:47] washing service at this time we couldn't
[34:49] think of a way to do that and do it obey
[34:52] the rules of social distancing and
[34:54] things that we need to obey we will do
[34:57] foot washing again in the future we're
[34:58] not cutting that out but we're just
[35:00] gonna do communion this time next Sunday
[35:02] at 3 o'clock brother Darrell Ward was
[35:05] thinking about being able to be here but
[35:07] something come up for him and you pray
[35:10] for the Evangelist out there and the
[35:11] minister say they don't already know
[35:14] what to do their schedules are all
[35:15] messed up and you schedule something and
[35:17] then cancels I've had to cancel on
[35:19] ministers they've had to cancel on me
[35:21] and I know every church is like that
[35:23] every church is going through that
[35:24] because it's just hard to have a meeting
[35:27] right now and so pray for those brothers
[35:28] that are having to go through that and
[35:30] having to try to figure out what they're
[35:31] gonna do and and for those brothers
[35:33] overseas that are used to having
[35:35] missionaries come and people come to
[35:36] help and that's just not they're not
[35:38] able to do that right now but we know
[35:40] there's got to be a purpose for that so
[35:42] be praying for them but again communion
[35:45] next Sunday at 3 o'clock and but no foot
[35:48] washing there's a church survey is what
[35:52] I called it but there's a piece of paper
[35:54] out there in the foyer near the offering
[35:57] baskets and if you will take one of
[35:59] those and fill it out and what all that
[36:01] it is is some questions about what you'd
[36:04] like to have in the church and this is
[36:06] your church right this is not brother
[36:10] Ben's church this is your church you go
[36:12] to church here and and so there's some
[36:15] questions on there about the carpet and
[36:19] whether or not we should replace it and
[36:21] if so what color that you'd like to have
[36:23] and about the pews whether or not we
[36:25] should replace the pews and I'm not
[36:27] asking you for money we have the money
[36:30] to do it right now if we wanted to do it
[36:32] but it's just a matter of knowing what
[36:34] to do and and so that it would be
[36:36] helpful to the brothers and to me if you
[36:37] kind of put your input in and again it's
[36:40] your church and it's not a vote there's
[36:42] nothing binding but it just lets you be
[36:44] able to do that and also I put a
[36:45] question on there about service on
[36:48] Sunday night and if we have it should we
[36:50] have it if not or if so what time would
[36:54] be best for you and we'll try to get an
[36:55] idea again not a vote will have to do as
[36:58] we feel led to do but but I just want to
[37:01] get your input on it and God bless you
[37:03] and doing that thank you in advance for
[37:05] doing that for us again we're not asking
[37:07] for money but we would like to do some
[37:10] things and we like to you to be part of
[37:12] that
[37:13] all right let's stand together this
[37:15] morning do you love the Lord amen I
[37:18] trust that you do was so thankful that
[37:20] we're able to gather together this
[37:21] morning and have this good congregation
[37:23] here and some others that are unable to
[37:25] come that are watching this morning so
[37:27] we're grateful for that John chapter
[37:30] five and verse one start reading in
[37:33] verse one and we'll read down through
[37:34] verse eight good to have my brother here
[37:37] again this morning and I know he had a
[37:39] rough night their air went out and I
[37:42] ended up getting up at 3 o'clock in the
[37:43] morning electricity went out and they
[37:44] come to church so I know he didn't
[37:48] probably want me to tell that but but I
[37:50] appreciate that and and it means
[37:52] something and I'm sure God will reward
[37:53] them for their for their dedication to
[37:56] that and for you as well all of you that
[37:58] come Satan fights you to keep you out of
[38:01] the house of God we know it's good for
[38:04] you because of how hard he fights you to
[38:06] keep you out of here so we're gonna do
[38:08] everything we can to have church
[38:09] whenever we can and there'll be times
[38:11] things will come up but we know that God
[38:13] is faithful and we'll be able to meet
[38:15] together again amen John chapter five
[38:18] and verse one after this there was a
[38:20] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[38:23] Jerusalem there is at Jerusalem by the
[38:26] Sheep market a pool which is called in
[38:28] Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five
[38:30] porches
[38:32] in these lay a great multitude of
[38:34] impotent folk of blind all withered
[38:37] waiting for the moving of the water
[38:40] angel went down with a certain season
[38:43] into the pool and troubled the water so
[38:46] ever then first after the troubling of
[38:48] the water stepped in was made whole
[38:50] whatsoever disease he had and I want you
[38:52] to think this morning how disappointing
[38:55] that must have been to the rest of them
[38:56] because just the fastest one to be able
[38:59] to get down there was healed and no one
[39:01] else so in verse five it says a certain
[39:05] man was there which had an infirmity
[39:06] thirty and eight years Jesus saw him
[39:10] lying knew that he had been now a long
[39:12] time in that case he saith unto Him wilt
[39:15] thou be made a hole wilt thou be made a
[39:18] hole the impotent man answered him sir I
[39:21] have no man when the water is troubled
[39:23] to put me into the pool while I am
[39:25] coming another step is down before me
[39:27] and random talks about this how that he
[39:29] was able to walk able to get up but he
[39:32] just wasn't able to get down fast enough
[39:35] jesus saith unto Him arise take up thy
[39:38] bed and walk
[39:41] Amen let's approach the Lord one more
[39:43] time Heavenly Father I'm so grateful to
[39:45] be in your house again and father I pray
[39:48] that you'd move me out of the way this
[39:50] morning and speak us I know you want to
[39:52] you've done so many times before thank
[39:55] you for it we pray in Jesus name Amen
[39:57] amen to ask a man you may be seated to
[40:08] ask a man who was waiting at the Pool of
[40:11] Bethesda if he wanted to be well it's
[40:16] like asking a person in the drive-thru
[40:18] line at McDonald's if they want to eat I
[40:23] was in Walmart the other day and and
[40:26] there were several kids going through
[40:28] there about my kids age with fishing
[40:29] poles and they were coming out the door
[40:31] and I almost turn around to him and said
[40:33] are you going fishing that would be the
[40:38] reason why you bottled you know it and
[40:41] and so it almost seems silly to us that
[40:44] Jesus would talk to
[40:46] man who'd been sick for 38 years and he
[40:49] knew that the Bible says he knew how
[40:52] long he'd been sick and he approached
[40:55] him by the salmon you talked to him he
[40:56] said do you want to be well wilt thou be
[41:00] made whole and he's not just saying do
[41:06] you wish to be well or you hope to be
[41:08] well but if you go back and look at the
[41:09] original word its are you in earnest of
[41:12] being well Jesus appeals to the energy
[41:16] of his will do you have a desire a
[41:20] strong desire to be well to behold and
[41:26] we know that this man was predestined by
[41:29] God to have his healing we know this
[41:32] because Jesus said in John 5:17 he said
[41:35] my father worketh hitherto and I work
[41:37] and verse 19 then answered Jesus and
[41:40] said unto them verily verily I say unto
[41:42] you the son can do nothing of himself
[41:44] but what he seeth the father do for what
[41:47] things soever he doeth there also do
[41:49] it's a son likewise you can't get a
[41:52] better model of election of
[41:54] predestination than this man sitting
[41:56] among five or ten thousand people he's
[42:00] sitting among the multitude and he sees
[42:02] there and all the people are around
[42:04] surrounding this pool this disappointing
[42:07] pool which is a type of
[42:10] denominationalism that they're sitting
[42:11] there waiting on a revival waiting on
[42:14] something to happen here comes Christ
[42:16] himself walking among them when he comes
[42:19] down and walks among the people he
[42:21] begins to walk through pass little
[42:23] babies that are crying and and bout to
[42:26] die he walks past lame people and blind
[42:28] people and many impotent folk as the
[42:30] Bible says but he was he did not heal
[42:33] any of those he did not he did not touch
[42:37] any of those but he he winds his way
[42:39] through the crowd unnoticed by the
[42:41] multitude and speaks to a man who didn't
[42:44] know he was coming and had no idea that
[42:47] he would be healed that day and he
[42:49] speaks to him and says do you want to be
[42:51] well 30-man and every one of us could
[42:55] look back at our own life or the JD and
[42:56] see that there was a time when God
[42:58] his way through the crowd and he made
[43:01] his way in our generation through
[43:02] through family and through people and
[43:05] through others that maybe were worse off
[43:07] than we were but he comes to our town he
[43:10] comes to our family he comes to our
[43:12] church whatever that it is and he said
[43:14] do you want to be well here's a message
[43:18] that you can be well here's a word that
[43:20] you can follow it you can be whole amen
[43:25] aren't you grateful for God's election
[43:27] today so he was predestined to that and
[43:31] and brother Branham says notice him we
[43:33] found a man laying on a pallet that
[43:35] would walk and he said to him wilt thou
[43:37] be made whole wide that one I thought a
[43:43] lot about that but the Bobby wide that
[43:45] one now watch he said he'll tell you
[43:49] Jesus knew this man had been there in
[43:51] this time you see all these years he
[43:53] healed him he told him to take up this
[43:56] bed and go home and he did in other
[43:58] words we saw a vision he entered he the
[44:00] father showed him that this man would be
[44:04] well so it takes predestination to be
[44:08] what we are in and here this morning you
[44:11] you have to have that election in your
[44:13] life but I want to tell you today that
[44:17] and I know you know this but I want to
[44:20] remind us I feel like the Spirit wants
[44:22] to remind us today that you cannot be
[44:25] healed saved or delivered unless you
[44:27] want to be many times in dealing with
[44:32] people that you know maybe you've got it
[44:35] family that's addicts maybe you've got
[44:38] family that's out in the world and they
[44:40] become addicted to substances or things
[44:42] like that and you deal with people like
[44:43] that and it it seems like that there's
[44:45] very little movement in their lives they
[44:48] say they speaks the right things they
[44:49] they tell you they want to be right and
[44:52] they tell you they want to quit drink
[44:53] you know JD they want to quit smoking
[44:54] they want to do all of these things but
[44:56] there's just no will there to do it it
[44:58] seems like and when they J that they're
[45:00] telling you the truth they don't intend
[45:02] to go back and but something just keeps
[45:04] pulling them back they just can't seem
[45:05] to be delivered but there's got to be a
[45:08] strong desire that God places in them
[45:13] to want to be well or they can't be and
[45:17] we have to be careful that we don't take
[45:20] and look at our own failure look at it
[45:23] as a failure of ours because it was not
[45:25] a failure of Christ being who he was
[45:29] that he passed all of those other people
[45:33] it was not a failure of that we look at
[45:36] our family we want so badly to help we
[45:39] look at people around us we want so
[45:40] badly to be able to help them but it's
[45:42] not a failure of that but it's gone
[45:45] choosing who he will and all we can do
[45:50] is offer the gospel to them all we can
[45:52] do is is offer them help and we should
[45:54] and we should as I said go after that
[45:57] one with the one that's lost from the
[45:59] fold the one the ninety and nine are
[46:01] safe let's go after the one but when we
[46:02] go we have to remember that our part is
[46:05] just setting the line it's just reading
[46:07] the gospel we can't make them sheep so
[46:13] you cannot be healed saved or delivered
[46:15] as you want to be the maniac in Portland
[46:19] could not be delivered
[46:21] it could be bound but he could not be
[46:23] delivered because there was no desire
[46:26] there but the bound says that the police
[46:28] said is that man dead I said no sir said
[46:30] he's He healed I said no sir he worships
[46:33] that spirit see he'd bring it right back
[46:36] to him because he thinks listen he's
[46:39] right if you ever want to be delivered
[46:45] if you ever want to be saved if you ever
[46:47] want to be healed
[46:48] you've got to recognize that you're not
[46:50] right jesus said the sick not or the
[46:55] whale don't need a physician but the
[46:59] sick do and that's why sometimes kids
[47:02] will leave and they get to a certain age
[47:04] and they're leaving why in the world but
[47:05] after a while they realize I'm sick I
[47:07] need what my parents had I need what the
[47:10] church had I need what that I was
[47:12] exposed to as a child they have to
[47:14] realize sometimes that they're sinners
[47:17] and that has to come to you whether you
[47:20] go out in the world or whether you stay
[47:21] in the church it's got to come to you
[47:22] got to recognize that you're a sinner
[47:24] and you need gray
[47:27] and so that where does that desire comes
[47:30] from come from if you have it today
[47:33] you're blessed by it where does it come
[47:35] from Romans nine eleven it says for the
[47:39] children being not yet born neither
[47:40] haven't done any good or evil that the
[47:43] purpose of God according to election
[47:44] might stand not of works but of him that
[47:46] calleth it was said unto her the elder
[47:49] shall serve the younger
[47:50] remember this is Isaac and Rebekah in
[47:53] and they're both godly parents both have
[47:56] their faults with their godly parents
[47:58] and elders shall serve the younger as it
[48:01] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[48:03] have I hated
[48:05] no but the rabbit says he hated Esau and
[48:08] loved Jacob before either boy was born
[48:09] for his foreknowledge allows him to
[48:11] predestinate all things to work together
[48:13] to his glory he said that's the great
[48:15] Jehovah it isn't him that Willis there
[48:17] he that run it's this God that show us
[48:19] mercy he said that's what the scripture
[48:22] says so it isn't how much you try it's
[48:24] how much God has done for you if you've
[48:27] got enough of God let's do this to come
[48:28] out here tonight a desire to come hear
[48:31] the message you ought to be the happiest
[48:34] person in the city hey man if you got an
[48:38] F of God to come out and hear the
[48:40] message of the hour you ought to be the
[48:42] happiest person in the city because God
[48:44] is moving in your life he's trying to
[48:47] lead you to the fountain he loves you oh
[48:50] do we believe that this morning then we
[48:53] shouldn't give up we said well my life
[48:55] is such now we shouldn't give up because
[48:57] if you have a desire He loves you now
[49:01] this elective love manifested itself in
[49:04] Jacobs life in an overwhelming desire I
[49:08] hope you get this this morning election
[49:12] is not a dormant thing it's not
[49:15] something that just is there and it's
[49:17] separate from who you are
[49:20] election manifested itself in such an
[49:22] overwhelming desire for the things of
[49:25] God and for the best thing and for the
[49:27] birthright that Jacob when he was in his
[49:30] mama's womb and he was about to be born
[49:33] grabbed hold of the heel of Esau we know
[49:36] that selection because he could never
[49:38] even think
[49:39] to do that he couldn't it wasn't a plan
[49:42] that he's inside the womb sitting there
[49:44] thinking well you know when I come out
[49:45] I'm gonna grab hold so I'll be named
[49:47] Jacob and and then later on I'll get the
[49:49] blessing know all these things seem to
[49:51] happen almost by accident they happened
[49:54] to him seemed seemingly randomly but
[49:56] what happened was there was an
[49:58] overwhelming desire even as a baby to
[50:02] change his status and in doing that he
[50:06] made many mistakes but the desire was
[50:08] still there and the desire come from God
[50:12] so was a desire to attain to a higher
[50:15] status than what he was born to and
[50:19] every Christian the Stuart has to come
[50:21] to that that there's a desire or heart
[50:22] that we want to be more than what our
[50:24] flesh is we want to be more than what
[50:28] our weaknesses are we want to be more
[50:30] than what we were born in sin shapen in
[50:32] iniquity come in the world speaking lies
[50:33] but I want to attain to a status of a
[50:36] son or daughter of God so if I'm going
[50:38] to attain to that status
[50:40] there must be an overwhelming desire
[50:41] that God places in my heart
[50:44] I never sought God I can't seek God the
[50:48] condition of man you look at the world
[50:49] today they're not seeking God for the
[50:52] most part man doesn't seek God he wants
[50:54] to worship but he just he worships
[50:56] anything who worship a tree or or
[50:58] anything a worshiper Clare job but but
[51:01] there's something in you that wants the
[51:03] real God wants the Living God who put
[51:07] that desire there he did amen
[51:12] so there's an overwhelming desire and
[51:17] yet that desire lays dormant in our
[51:19] lives and this man had been there for 38
[51:23] years and maybe for much of that he'd
[51:26] been at the Pool of Bethesda and said in
[51:29] his denominational circle or maybe his
[51:33] message church and sit there and and
[51:38] every time there was a revival or a
[51:41] movement of the Spirit of God he tried
[51:44] he attempted it but he just couldn't
[51:48] make it to the water for 38 years
[51:52] he struggled with it and you would think
[51:56] at the end of that 38 years that he
[51:58] would have gotten to a point where he
[52:00] was desperate but actually what happens
[52:03] is we get used to things and the man
[52:07] must have gotten used to his condition
[52:10] and he says well I would go but before I
[52:14] can get there somebody gets there ahead
[52:15] of me I would go to church but every
[52:19] time I do something happens so it must
[52:21] not be meant for me
[52:22] I would I would pray but every time I do
[52:26] it doesn't see my my prayers were
[52:27] answered so it must not have been for me
[52:31] and so Jesus comes to him but Robert in
[52:33] that conditioner says do you want to be
[52:35] well are you ready to shake yourself out
[52:39] of your complacency and realize what
[52:41] you're doing that you just lived with
[52:44] this all of your almost all of your life
[52:46] you've lived with this problem and for
[52:49] 38 years you sit there and and and
[52:53] thought well it must just not be for me
[52:55] see he hung around he headed up society
[52:58] to hang around
[53:00] but Jesus still had to awake that desire
[53:03] it is hard to say do you ought to be
[53:05] well been you really want to be well do
[53:11] you want to be well bad enough to do
[53:12] what it takes to be well you see says if
[53:17] you want to be well pick up your bed on
[53:19] the Sabbath day which is a bigger thing
[53:22] than we think and walk with it if you
[53:27] want to be well do something that your
[53:29] denomination recognizes as wrong believe
[53:35] something that the people around you
[53:37] will look at and say he's a sinner he's
[53:40] not right if you want to be well
[53:43] acknowledge that the word Christ was the
[53:48] word in flesh acknowledged that the word
[53:51] is true if you want to be well pick up
[53:56] your bed on the Sabbath day and walk
[54:00] it's might get a little heavy for a
[54:03] minute but I want you to bear with me
[54:04] because
[54:05] really wonderful the grace of God to us
[54:08] but you know we live in a day where we
[54:11] want no obstacles between us and mercy
[54:14] we want free grace we want a heaven with
[54:19] no entrance requirements where if you go
[54:22] and you're a drug dealer go on in if you
[54:25] go if you're a prostitute going in but
[54:30] see Jesus wants to save the drug dealer
[54:31] in the prostitute but he can't go in
[54:34] that way
[54:37] revelation 22 and 14 tells us there's
[54:40] some requirements that blessed are they
[54:41] that do His commandments that they may
[54:43] have right to the Tree of Life and that
[54:45] word literally is authority over the
[54:47] tree of life may enter through the gates
[54:50] into the city without are dogs and
[54:53] sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers
[54:55] and idolaters and whosoever loveth and
[54:58] maketh a lie these don't make it in C it
[55:04] doesn't matter what you were you may
[55:05] have been a dog or a sorcerer
[55:07] whoremonger a murderer an idolaters or
[55:10] you may have loved and made a lie but no
[55:13] matter what you were but you have to be
[55:16] clothed in the wedding garment you see
[55:19] when they come into the wedding in
[55:20] Matthew chapter 22 the Bible says that
[55:23] the servants went out into the highways
[55:24] and gathered together all as many as
[55:27] they found both bad and good and the
[55:29] wedding was furnished with guests and
[55:32] the king come in to see the guests
[55:34] because the logs remember that were
[55:36] invited didn't come so he goes to the
[55:39] Gentiles and he goes out and he he calls
[55:42] me and he calls you the ones who didn't
[55:45] maybe have a right to be there but we
[55:47] would come and so he come and he called
[55:49] us the bad and the good and when the
[55:52] king came in to see the guests he saw
[55:53] there a man which had not on a wedding
[55:55] garment and he says unto Him friend how
[55:58] camest thou in hither not having a
[56:01] wedding garment and he was speechless he
[56:05] didn't have an excuse because if he'd
[56:08] come through the door you can't come to
[56:13] Christ without receiving the token
[56:15] receiving the Holy Ghost without you
[56:17] can't be
[56:18] you may come and assimilate around all
[56:20] the other people but you won't have the
[56:22] wedding garment on and he says he was
[56:25] speechless since that the King to the
[56:26] servants bind him hand and foot
[56:28] take him away cast him into outer
[56:30] darkness there shall be weeping and
[56:31] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[56:33] but few were chosen
[56:34] he said I'm willing for anybody the bad
[56:36] and the good to come but they must put
[56:38] on the wedding garment they must come to
[56:41] the door
[56:45] over the last 25 or so years the new
[56:48] type of churches was created which
[56:50] identified itself as seeker sensitive
[56:54] seeker sensitive and and that's why so
[56:57] many churches changed their names you
[56:59] could grab by a church it wasn't
[57:00] Assembly of God Church for many years
[57:02] and all sudden it's got a new name it's
[57:04] because they want to be seeker sensitive
[57:06] they don't want to say anything maybe
[57:08] somebody had a bad experience that is
[57:09] Assembly of God Church so they'll just
[57:11] make up a name that would be harmless so
[57:15] I was driving the other day and I saw a
[57:17] church that said the name of the church
[57:18] was the brand-new church not sure I want
[57:23] to go to that church and I'm not sure
[57:26] how often they'll have to change their
[57:27] sign because it won't be long it won't
[57:30] be the brand-new Church but the point is
[57:34] that they don't want to offend nobody
[57:36] you want to late let down to where
[57:38] everybody could come regardless of you
[57:41] wouldn't be suspicious that it might be
[57:42] Pentecostal or Baptist or whatever you
[57:44] wouldn't know so they want to lower the
[57:47] obstacles to people for people to come
[57:49] and and the problem with that is that
[57:52] there's no biblical precedent for it
[57:55] none at all and so that kind of Church
[57:59] in when it they're talking about that
[58:02] kind of a church and I saw this in a
[58:04] news article they talked about this
[58:07] certain church instead of Sunday service
[58:08] to this park their apiece ession part
[58:11] stand-up comedy routine part live
[58:13] concert this is not your grandmother's
[58:16] idea of church it's how PBS newshour
[58:19] began their recent segment on new Abbey
[58:21] Church in Pasadena California this
[58:24] church is called an LGBTQ affirming
[58:27] Church so it's not just accepting but
[58:30] affirming
[58:32] Church shows a stand-up comedian who
[58:35] opens for a female pastor who talks
[58:39] about her life to a crowd of hipster
[58:41] congregants and the church was founded
[58:46] by a pastor who left a large evangelical
[58:48] church when he realized why young people
[58:49] weren't coming he said they didn't find
[58:52] it relevant to their needs I hate to
[58:55] break this to you but that's not why we
[58:56] go to church we go to church because God
[59:01] deserves to be worshipped we go to
[59:04] church because the word is true we go to
[59:07] church because God's Word works in our
[59:09] life but and so they said well if it
[59:13] doesn't meet your needs if the content
[59:15] in this man says if the content of what
[59:17] is preached doesn't meet the needs of
[59:19] the people you have to change the
[59:20] content but what we're telling you is
[59:25] that the content of the gospel will
[59:26] never meet the needs of the majority it
[59:30] will meet the needs of the elect and
[59:32] it'll meet the needs of whosoever will
[59:35] but it won't meet the needs of the
[59:37] majority look you see the
[59:43] boyfriend-girlfriend relationship is
[59:45] seeker-sensitive
[59:46] you ever thought about that when you're
[59:49] someone when you're a boyfriend some of
[59:51] you have to think back many many years
[59:54] but if you are a boyfriend or a
[59:56] girlfriend you had a crush on somebody
[59:58] you'd want to do everything you could to
[1:00:01] make sure that you didn't offend them
[1:00:03] it's seeker-sensitive right and so you
[1:00:07] always show up and your breath is clean
[1:00:09] and your hair's combed in and you've got
[1:00:12] the flowers with you every time and
[1:00:15] you're you try to get this girl to have
[1:00:17] an interest in you or this boy have an
[1:00:19] interest in you and in that situation
[1:00:22] the girl can say hey if you don't make
[1:00:24] me happy I'll find someone who will and
[1:00:29] the church today it's like wanting to be
[1:00:34] a girlfriend to the word if the world
[1:00:37] makes me happy as long as it keeps
[1:00:38] bringing me flowers as long as it keeps
[1:00:40] as long as it keeps coming by on certain
[1:00:43] times and healing and doing what it
[1:00:45] I'm okay with it but if it ever crosses
[1:00:47] me we're done the church today says make
[1:00:53] me happy heal me guarantee heaven Jimmy
[1:00:55] or I'll find happiness somewhere else
[1:00:57] and all the time Christ the word it's
[1:01:00] looking for a bride looking for a wife
[1:01:03] he's not looking for a girlfriend he's
[1:01:06] not looking for just somebody to bring
[1:01:07] flowers to he's not looking just for
[1:01:10] somebody but there's a deeper
[1:01:11] relationship beyond just showing up and
[1:01:14] and say well I'm so glad God showed up
[1:01:16] today no way it's a communion that you
[1:01:19] have with somebody that you love
[1:01:21] somebody you have a relationship with
[1:01:23] you'll say if I don't find my happiness
[1:01:26] here in the world I'll find it somewhere
[1:01:28] else
[1:01:28] no it's II don't want someone who brings
[1:01:30] flowers till he brings flowers to him
[1:01:32] Saturday night but he wants someone to
[1:01:34] be flesh from his flesh bone of his bone
[1:01:36] power of his power
[1:01:38] hey man he wants somebody to be the Lord
[1:01:41] that's why I sent the message in our if
[1:01:43] he wanted us just to be like everybody
[1:01:44] else why would he bother sending the
[1:01:46] message why bother having a bringing
[1:01:50] elijah at the end time if he doesn't
[1:01:52] want us to be different he wants
[1:01:54] somebody who will fulfill the the bride
[1:01:57] type in this hour to be the bride of
[1:02:00] Jesus Christ listen Jesus told the woman
[1:02:04] at the well but the hour cometh and now
[1:02:06] is when the true worshipers shall
[1:02:08] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:02:10] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:02:12] worship Him you don't want to just be
[1:02:16] their boyfriend you don't want to just
[1:02:17] be somebody who shows up now in the end
[1:02:19] but he seeks such to worship Him amen
[1:02:23] he's looking for a worshiper he's
[1:02:25] looking for somebody who he's in a
[1:02:27] relationship with somebody who will obey
[1:02:29] his word
[1:02:30] somebody will stay right there with him
[1:02:36] you see you have to want that kind of a
[1:02:39] relationship the spirit and the bride
[1:02:43] the Bible says come say come and let him
[1:02:46] that heareth say come so we find herself
[1:02:48] identified with that as we've heard
[1:02:49] before let him that is athirst come
[1:02:51] where the Spirit of the bride are
[1:02:53] speaking come and then whosoever will
[1:02:56] let him take of the water of life freely
[1:02:58] so every was able to take advantage of
[1:03:01] that but even they even those who will
[1:03:04] not be in the bride have to want to be
[1:03:05] saved and it's got to be a desire strong
[1:03:11] enough to overcome the obstacles that
[1:03:14] God of the house to be placed between us
[1:03:17] and mercy now hear me
[1:03:21] the desire to serve God must be strong
[1:03:24] enough that it will overcome the
[1:03:25] obstacles that God allows to be placed
[1:03:29] between you and mercy so that if you
[1:03:33] find yourself in a situation like job
[1:03:35] where you're serving God doing
[1:03:36] everything right and God says I'm gonna
[1:03:39] let Satan take the hedge around about
[1:03:41] him out from around about him and I'm
[1:03:42] all that Satan attack his body and
[1:03:44] attack his family and attack him
[1:03:47] financially and he'll still serve me
[1:03:54] he'll still serve me that's the kind of
[1:03:57] person God wants that's the kind that
[1:04:00] the bride is a man that's the son or
[1:04:03] daughter of God you see God places
[1:04:07] obstacles when in front of the mercy the
[1:04:10] throne of mercy when John saw the throne
[1:04:11] in heaven he saw four beasts surrounding
[1:04:13] the throne the first beast was like a
[1:04:15] lion the second beast like a calf and
[1:04:17] it's in Revelations 4 7 the third beast
[1:04:20] had a face as a man and the fourth beast
[1:04:22] was like a flying eagle and the four
[1:04:25] beasts as we know or the four standards
[1:04:27] of the tribes of Israel that were
[1:04:28] guarding the mercy seat in the
[1:04:29] wilderness they were guards around said
[1:04:33] their regards to the mercy seat he
[1:04:35] taught us that you can go and I won't
[1:04:36] read the quotes I had some of them in
[1:04:38] here I took them out to save time but
[1:04:40] you can go back and look at Revelation
[1:04:42] chapter 4 Revelation chapter 5 go and
[1:04:44] listen to those those messages that
[1:04:45] brother Brandon preached he taught that
[1:04:47] Matthew 28:19 was a guard to acts 2:38
[1:04:52] in Matthew 28:19 says baptize them in
[1:04:55] the name of the Father Son and the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost it doesn't say anything wrong but
[1:05:00] it backs up acts 2:38 but what it does
[1:05:04] is it takes the majority of the church
[1:05:07] world today is baptized wrong reading
[1:05:10] the same Bible that we
[1:05:12] why because God put an obstacle there so
[1:05:17] that only those that were elected would
[1:05:18] see it are you with me now those and
[1:05:21] it's plain it's right there brother Ram
[1:05:23] said you wouldn't even need a revelation
[1:05:24] to see that and yet
[1:05:26] 99% of the church wall doesn't teaches
[1:05:28] and so the person with revelation we say
[1:05:33] well that's he said the name of the
[1:05:37] Father Son and Holy Ghost that makes
[1:05:38] sense makes perfect sense Peter wouldn't
[1:05:41] know the first time that God ever had a
[1:05:44] church on the earth they wouldn't have
[1:05:45] done it wrong so it makes sense that
[1:05:49] that Peter under the inspiration of the
[1:05:51] Holy Spirit would would repeat what
[1:05:52] Jesus said but do it in the right way
[1:05:55] but now people don't understand that the
[1:05:58] carnal mind wrestles with it
[1:06:00] and this is what Jesus is talking about
[1:06:02] a Luke 10 21 when it says in that hour
[1:06:04] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:06:06] thank the old Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:06:08] Earth that that was to hid these things
[1:06:09] from the wise and prudent and hast
[1:06:12] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:06:15] for so it seemed good in thy sight so
[1:06:21] when the Gentile woman come to the word
[1:06:23] come to Christ seeking healing the South
[1:06:26] Phoenician woman for her daughter Jesus
[1:06:30] said it's not right to give the
[1:06:32] children's bread to dogs where the
[1:06:38] branch says in perseverance which he
[1:06:39] takes from the text there were in the
[1:06:42] Bible or it talks about the South
[1:06:43] Phoenician woman he said this woman here
[1:06:45] our little Greek friend and we have here
[1:06:47] before us he said when she arrived at
[1:06:49] Jesus like Jesus would arrive here with
[1:06:52] us tonight we arrive and he comes here
[1:06:55] improves here he is among us well she
[1:06:58] thought that settled it see she had much
[1:07:00] difficulty brother Ram talked about that
[1:07:02] getting to him when she got to him she
[1:07:04] said well that settles it he said that
[1:07:06] don't settle it no sir that's when you
[1:07:08] begin to fight he said that's when you
[1:07:12] just start your real battle when she
[1:07:14] arrived at Jesus and Jesus said he was
[1:07:16] not set to her race and how many times
[1:07:20] do people start coming to the house of
[1:07:22] God and coming to church and when they
[1:07:23] first come they feel that the president
[1:07:25] god of the people are friendly and it's
[1:07:26] nice and everything's going good and
[1:07:28] maybe three or four weeks later you see
[1:07:30] them start to miss church sometimes and
[1:07:34] you see them start to go back out you
[1:07:36] see them go from the front to the back
[1:07:37] and then out the door and you begin to
[1:07:39] wonder what what's going on and in her
[1:07:41] life and you begin to realize that but a
[1:07:44] Joe they they had come to the word and
[1:07:47] then the word offended them a little bit
[1:07:49] they begin to find out wait a minute
[1:07:52] this isn't like the Baptist Church this
[1:07:56] doesn't like the Pentecostal church I
[1:07:57] have their standards that have to be met
[1:08:00] and it's not a legalism but it's it's an
[1:08:04] expectation of the word in my life that
[1:08:07] if the word is working certain things
[1:08:08] will take place and so you see some that
[1:08:11] will hold on and some that'll stain
[1:08:13] become real Christians and others will
[1:08:15] go right back because they were caught
[1:08:17] in the net but there was nothing in
[1:08:19] there no real desire because the word
[1:08:21] become an obstacle to them and now this
[1:08:25] woman arrives to Jesus and Jesus said he
[1:08:27] was not sent to her race but the man who
[1:08:30] said still she held on he said I like
[1:08:32] that hold on to it
[1:08:34] she was perseverance she was not a
[1:08:35] hotbed plant had to be baby no sir she
[1:08:39] was not a hybrid article like a big part
[1:08:40] of the crop today you didn't have to beg
[1:08:42] her and say now sister I'll tell you I
[1:08:44] would encourage you to go on he said no
[1:08:46] sir there wasn't nobody there to
[1:08:48] encourage her even Jesus himself tried
[1:08:50] to discourage her he said now I feel
[1:08:53] like holy rollers sure enough even
[1:08:54] Christ himself standing there trying to
[1:08:57] discourage her but she held on she had
[1:08:59] arrived at something she knew it Ben
[1:09:03] Allen and she said Lord you're that's
[1:09:08] true that's true whatever you say it's
[1:09:11] true but even the dogs eat the crumbs
[1:09:13] that fall from the master's table when
[1:09:16] naman came to Elijah's house he left
[1:09:20] disappointed because the lie she says
[1:09:23] okay you want to be well do you want to
[1:09:26] be well go to Jordan dip seven times and
[1:09:32] the man says wait a minute I got fifty
[1:09:36] rivers better than that one
[1:09:38] why do I have to go to that one he
[1:09:41] starts to leave and this servant told
[1:09:43] him said hey if he'd asked you to done a
[1:09:45] big to do a big thing you'd have done it
[1:09:47] but he asked you to do a small thing go
[1:09:49] go go nup dunk yourself in a in a muddy
[1:09:53] river it's a small thing it's just a
[1:09:55] little thing but he asked you to do it
[1:09:57] and so he said okay I'll I'll do it and
[1:09:59] when he goes he dips himself seven times
[1:10:01] he comes back clean why did he have to
[1:10:04] go to Jordan he had to want to be
[1:10:07] cleaned when they a blind man came to
[1:10:12] Jesus actually Jesus was walking along
[1:10:16] and sees him and his disciples say was
[1:10:19] this man born blind or was it his
[1:10:21] parents or what was it that caused this
[1:10:23] who sinned because he was born blind he
[1:10:24] said who sinned him or his parents and
[1:10:27] Jesus said neither one of them but he
[1:10:30] said this was done that God might give
[1:10:32] glory
[1:10:33] so he comes up to him and and he spits
[1:10:37] on the ground there's a strange thing
[1:10:40] for a preacher to do talk about breaking
[1:10:44] kovat requirements right there he goes
[1:10:49] spits on the ground makes the the clay
[1:10:52] muddy picks it up puts it on his eyes
[1:10:56] what a strange thing to do and he puts
[1:11:03] the mud on him and he said go wash in
[1:11:05] the pool of Siloam which means sent and
[1:11:08] he never led him there he just sent him
[1:11:11] away
[1:11:13] now but the brand picks that up and he
[1:11:16] says go to the pool of Siloam and wash
[1:11:18] so what was its face to contact see as
[1:11:21] soon as he could find the pool he said
[1:11:23] well which way to the pool of sent you
[1:11:30] could imagine he's blind Jesus didn't
[1:11:33] tell him where it was he just said go to
[1:11:34] Siloam
[1:11:36] he was since he's blind he's wandering
[1:11:40] around he's walking around the area and
[1:11:42] he's blind he's he's trying to see could
[1:11:45] someone help me if someone help me say
[1:11:48] well what do you need I need to get to
[1:11:50] the pool of Siloam well there's
[1:11:51] the pool over here no he told me to go
[1:11:53] to the pool of siloam well there's
[1:11:57] something else sir there's one that's a
[1:11:59] whole lot closer no he said he told me
[1:12:01] to go to the pool of siloam and he says
[1:12:06] why do you want to go to the pool he
[1:12:07] says it doesn't make any difference help
[1:12:08] me get to the pool cuz I know when I get
[1:12:11] to the pool brother man typed it this
[1:12:14] way said somebody help me to the meeting
[1:12:18] let me get in the presence of God I
[1:12:21] realized God has revealed to me the word
[1:12:23] has told me that if they lay hands on
[1:12:24] the sick they shall recover so I've got
[1:12:26] to get to the pool help me get there
[1:12:28] you've been there at some point in your
[1:12:30] life you know what that's like to to
[1:12:33] felt that the behind is coming and
[1:12:36] you're groping in darkness but the word
[1:12:38] speaks to you and says if you could just
[1:12:40] get in the presence of God if you could
[1:12:43] just get into a place where God can
[1:12:45] speak to you again
[1:12:46] and so the word tells you that and and
[1:12:50] you have to follow the word it may look
[1:12:53] stupid you may have mud all over your
[1:12:56] eyes but if he said go to the pool of
[1:12:58] Siloam that's the only place I can be I
[1:13:04] hope you hear me today you have to hit
[1:13:08] the wall to be well you had to want it
[1:13:11] bad enough but he groped through the
[1:13:14] darkness until he found the pool where
[1:13:21] are you going
[1:13:22] you know what I mean he said you
[1:13:24] wouldn't go over that bunch would you
[1:13:26] will just help me get over there that's
[1:13:29] all I want to know get me there and
[1:13:34] think spiritually now because no certain
[1:13:37] church but it's getting me to where
[1:13:40] Jesus is let me get into its presence I
[1:13:44] mean let me come to the Shekinah the
[1:13:47] word has told me that if I go and loss
[1:13:50] shall be well the word has told me that
[1:13:55] there's a place where Christ is living
[1:13:58] in people he said that's all I want to
[1:14:00] know get me there said I like that get
[1:14:02] me to a bunch of people where I can see
[1:14:04] the Bible live
[1:14:05] where I can see Christ living in the
[1:14:07] people give me amongst that group help
[1:14:10] me to get over to the pool of fent
[1:14:14] hey Ben and as soon as I said well here
[1:14:17] you are some kind lady or something
[1:14:20] another come by got him in her hand took
[1:14:22] him over to the pool say old fellow
[1:14:25] here's the pool why is it oh I've just
[1:14:27] got the Word of God that told me when I
[1:14:29] washed I'd see and it might be difficult
[1:14:34] it might it might be struggles there
[1:14:36] might be obstacles and even the very
[1:14:38] word itself was an obstacle the word
[1:14:41] said you've got to go find the pool the
[1:14:43] word said you you're not gonna be well
[1:14:45] until you go now Jesus could have spoken
[1:14:47] he could have been well but he had to
[1:14:49] had to want to be well and so he
[1:14:53] stumbled out through the city looking
[1:14:55] for the pool but he was at a single mind
[1:14:59] and a single heart that he was gonna
[1:15:01] reach it he said I've got the Word of
[1:15:03] God that told me when I wash that seat
[1:15:05] well my eyesight came to him and then he
[1:15:09] come back rejoicing it was the pool for
[1:15:12] him oh I remember when I found that pool
[1:15:16] can you remember can you remember when
[1:15:19] the word directed you to that place and
[1:15:20] you found that pool and you found a
[1:15:22] place where there was healing you found
[1:15:24] a place where you can see you've found a
[1:15:26] place but you had to obey the word to
[1:15:28] get there and brother Adam tells us that
[1:15:33] for obedience to the word entitles us to
[1:15:35] the token it's not how much you jump and
[1:15:39] how much you shout how much you cry but
[1:15:40] it's when God when he puts that mud on
[1:15:43] your eyes he says go to the pool you go
[1:15:44] to the pool people wait on something to
[1:15:50] happen something supernatural and they
[1:15:52] don't realize if they just obey the word
[1:15:55] there's healing but you got to obey the
[1:15:58] word there's there's restoration or
[1:16:01] salvation but you've got to obey the
[1:16:03] word you can't come to God and bring
[1:16:05] your your limitations and bring your
[1:16:08] expectations to God and say God I'll
[1:16:10] come if this is man I'll come but you
[1:16:12] gotta take me as I am no God don't do
[1:16:13] things like that he said you come my
[1:16:16] provided way
[1:16:20] in Matthew chapter 3 when John was
[1:16:24] preaching his message the wilderness of
[1:16:27] Judea and the Pharisees came to be
[1:16:30] baptized John stopped them
[1:16:32] it's a strange thing to do Don was a
[1:16:36] Baptist he'd take about anybody he was
[1:16:40] known as John the Baptist's not because
[1:16:41] he stopped people from being baptized
[1:16:43] but because he wanted to baptize people
[1:16:47] the people come here come some Pharisees
[1:16:50] for what would be part of the revival
[1:16:51] will come be baptized said wait a minute
[1:16:55] Matthew 3 and 1 in those days Came John
[1:16:57] the Baptist preaching in the wilderness
[1:16:58] of Judea saying repent ye for the
[1:17:02] kingdom of heaven is at hand this is he
[1:17:05] that was spoken about the prophet Isaiah
[1:17:07] saying the voice of one crying in the
[1:17:08] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:17:10] Lord make his paths straight the same
[1:17:13] John had his raiment of camels hair a
[1:17:15] leathern girdle about his loins his meat
[1:17:17] was locusts and wild honey doesn't
[1:17:19] doesn't sound very secret sensitive does
[1:17:21] it he was Elijah
[1:17:27] and he come out of the wilderness and
[1:17:29] they when they went out to him Jerusalem
[1:17:31] and all Judea in the region around about
[1:17:34] Jordan were baptized of him in Jordan
[1:17:36] confessing their sins and when many when
[1:17:40] he saw many of the Pharisees and
[1:17:42] Sadducees come to his baptism he said
[1:17:43] unto them o generation of vipers who
[1:17:46] hath warned you to flee from the wrath
[1:17:48] to come will you talk about the word
[1:17:50] coming on strong wait a minute
[1:17:55] generation of vipers coming to be
[1:17:57] baptized you're coming to be baptized
[1:17:59] but do you really want to be well
[1:18:04] because if you really want to be well
[1:18:07] there'll be certain things that will
[1:18:09] take place in your life listen he said
[1:18:13] bring bring forth therefore fruits meet
[1:18:18] for repentance and he didn't require
[1:18:22] that necessarily of everyone but he did
[1:18:24] of the Pharisees because they already
[1:18:26] had an idea that they were saved they
[1:18:29] thought they were ready to meet the
[1:18:31] Messiah
[1:18:32] they thought that their legalistic idea
[1:18:35] gave them the ability well I believe
[1:18:38] message Moses brought I can quote it
[1:18:42] word for word I I dressed right I'd do
[1:18:46] right and John said don't come be
[1:18:48] baptized don't come to a place of
[1:18:51] repentance until you bring forth fruit
[1:18:56] fruits meet for repentance he says a
[1:19:00] thing not to say within yourselves were
[1:19:03] predestinated we have Abraham to our
[1:19:06] Father for I say to you that God is able
[1:19:09] of these stones to raise up children
[1:19:10] unto Abraham now also the axis later to
[1:19:14] the root of the trees earth therefore
[1:19:16] every tree which bringeth not forth good
[1:19:18] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[1:19:20] fire I indeed baptize you with water
[1:19:23] unto repentance me he that cometh after
[1:19:25] me is mightier than I whose shoes I am
[1:19:27] not worthy to bear he shall baptize you
[1:19:30] with the Holy Ghost with fire whose fan
[1:19:32] is in his hand and he will thoroughly
[1:19:34] purge his floor and gather his wheat
[1:19:37] into the garner but he will burn up the
[1:19:39] chaff with unquenchable fire he says you
[1:19:41] think my message is strong wait till he
[1:19:43] comes you see they had to come the way
[1:19:49] of repentance and I've read this
[1:19:51] recently and better it fit here but the
[1:19:53] random and the efficient church age sees
[1:19:55] just what is the way back the way is the
[1:19:57] way of repentance you don't come to God
[1:20:00] telling God how you're going to come to
[1:20:01] him the blind men didn't have any
[1:20:04] options but to go to the pool the sick
[1:20:08] men didn't have any options but to pick
[1:20:09] up his bed on the Sabbath day and take
[1:20:11] the criticism you'll come to God and
[1:20:14] tell him this is what I'll do well
[1:20:17] pastors it's all over it's you know we I
[1:20:20] don't have to it's just you know
[1:20:22] something that I've dealt with and and I
[1:20:25] don't have to know you have to repent
[1:20:28] well it's just it's all over it it
[1:20:30] doesn't matter it doesn't matter it
[1:20:35] doesn't matter you got to come to God
[1:20:38] and be willing to open up and bare
[1:20:40] yourself before him and say Lord I'm
[1:20:42] done
[1:20:42] I'm tired of leaving myself
[1:20:45] I'm tired of laying at this pool you
[1:20:48] have to want to be well I'm tired of
[1:20:51] being in this situation everybody says
[1:20:52] around the message we need revival but
[1:20:54] are we gonna get to the point where we
[1:20:56] can say Lord we know we'll be a
[1:20:59] worldwide check you if I have a let it
[1:21:00] be in me I'm tired of just going to
[1:21:03] church at Sunday after Sunday and coming
[1:21:06] out the same person I was I want to be
[1:21:08] different I want to be changed if I want
[1:21:09] to do that how am I gonna do it I've got
[1:21:12] to come according to God's Word brother
[1:21:14] Brown says what is the way back the way
[1:21:16] is the way of repentance if a sinner has
[1:21:18] to come to God by way of repentance then
[1:21:20] the lukewarm or backslider will have to
[1:21:21] repent that much more he said repent
[1:21:25] bring forth fruits meet for repentance
[1:21:26] prove it by your life you take a person
[1:21:33] that says they are he says I'm a
[1:21:36] believer I believe let the gospel light
[1:21:39] strike them brother
[1:21:40] they take it right now brother Browns
[1:21:44] preaching a sermon called he cares do
[1:21:45] you care do you want to be well you have
[1:21:49] to care and that's to be well he cares
[1:21:53] as we said the other day if it's if
[1:21:56] there if it's the blood of the Lamb in
[1:21:57] the word of your testimony the blood of
[1:21:59] the lamb is there blood of the Lambs
[1:22:02] doing what it's supposed to do but it's
[1:22:04] the word of our testimony if there's a
[1:22:05] problem that's where it is we're not
[1:22:07] overcoming that's what's wrong oh he
[1:22:11] said let the gospel light strike them
[1:22:13] brother they take it right now and those
[1:22:17] show results they say well I know this
[1:22:22] is the right thing to do but I'm not
[1:22:23] going to do that I'm just gonna go on
[1:22:25] you haven't repented I know it be right
[1:22:30] but I just for me it's not right the
[1:22:35] word doesn't fit you the word doesn't
[1:22:38] fit me Oh God listen I know it's a
[1:22:43] little bit hard you bear with me for a
[1:22:45] minute he said certainly you'll not see
[1:22:48] that man anymore pool rooms you'll not
[1:22:52] see him out here with a cigarette in his
[1:22:53] hand you won't see him drinking you
[1:22:56] won't see him flirting with other women
[1:22:58] said no
[1:22:59] okay how much they throw their female
[1:23:01] flesh before him he'll turn his head
[1:23:02] towards the skies and look towards
[1:23:04] Christ you do that every time you go in
[1:23:07] Walmart by the way or anywhere where
[1:23:10] there's people at what is it it shows
[1:23:13] that the remedy took effect and if it
[1:23:15] don't take effect you say well I know I
[1:23:18] took it well then where are you at today
[1:23:21] then I hope this is just going down and
[1:23:24] for you that are sitting here for those
[1:23:26] that would listen for me let it sink
[1:23:28] down in your heart this is the Word of
[1:23:30] God he said it'll turn its head til the
[1:23:35] skies look towards Christ he shows the
[1:23:36] remedy took effect if it don't take
[1:23:38] effect you say well I know I took it
[1:23:39] well then where are you at today then
[1:23:42] you're dying you show I'm looking at you
[1:23:48] as diagnosing your case by the Bible
[1:23:50] that you're still in sin and the wages
[1:23:52] of sin is death don't think it has to be
[1:23:54] made any plainer see your own actions
[1:23:57] prove that you didn't take it because if
[1:24:02] you took it you had me afraid of counsel
[1:24:03] you wouldn't be afraid of repentance you
[1:24:06] wouldn't be afraid of doing what you're
[1:24:11] required to do as a believer but you
[1:24:14] hang back and say while I'm waiting on
[1:24:15] God to do something do you want to be
[1:24:17] well he said yet you try to make
[1:24:24] yourself before your fellow man will go
[1:24:27] back he said see your own actions prove
[1:24:29] that you didn't take it you thought you
[1:24:31] did you might have been all sincere in
[1:24:34] doing it but she didn't do it for if you
[1:24:36] did God promised it would take effect on
[1:24:38] you you know what one of the things that
[1:24:42] a doctor has to do some of you that take
[1:24:45] medicine you know this sqr you taking
[1:24:47] your medicine my pastor but I have you
[1:24:52] had when I was there he had problems he
[1:24:55] had some real problems on time with his
[1:24:58] he had a heart surgery and then he
[1:24:59] started having real problems we thought
[1:25:02] well it's his heart is blocked again he
[1:25:03] can't breathe and all this stuff he'd
[1:25:05] been given medicine to keep his arteries
[1:25:07] open and he thought he didn't need it
[1:25:09] and he'll tell you thought he knew
[1:25:11] better than the doctor did
[1:25:13] so he didn't take the medicine so he
[1:25:15] goes to the doctor and they looking on
[1:25:17] they do all the tests and stuff and the
[1:25:18] doctors did you take your medicine no
[1:25:21] well shouldn't the doctor got rough with
[1:25:24] him he did he said he was rude he said
[1:25:28] if you don't take it I can't help you
[1:25:31] don't you see how that works with the
[1:25:33] gospel if you won't do yourself what you
[1:25:36] would require others to do in your
[1:25:38] situation how can you be helped you want
[1:25:44] you know the person who comes in church
[1:25:46] you look at them and say well they need
[1:25:47] to dress fried they need that trait but
[1:25:49] what about us
[1:25:51] you say you might have been all sincere
[1:25:55] and doing it but you didn't do it for if
[1:25:56] you did God promised it would take
[1:25:57] effect on you and the old sin is still
[1:25:59] there the old Adam nature still lingers
[1:26:01] there the old unbelief yet you try to
[1:26:03] make yourself before your fellow man to
[1:26:04] say well I'm a believer all glory to God
[1:26:06] yes I'm a believer but you see it didn't
[1:26:08] help you any maybe the patient itself he
[1:26:10] said wasn't even predestinated to the
[1:26:12] medicine that's a sobering thought if it
[1:26:17] did it'll never take effect you see but
[1:26:19] look at the little immoral woman God
[1:26:22] didn't care what you did or what you
[1:26:23] were just did you come to the door look
[1:26:29] at that little bit more a woman on the
[1:26:30] light struck her there was something
[1:26:32] laying there to take care of her
[1:26:33] condition see if we believe and
[1:26:35] sincerely confess this remedy of God's
[1:26:38] Way takes effect God hasn't provided way
[1:26:42] for these things now see men will go say
[1:26:44] well I joined the church that settles it
[1:26:46] with me that isn't God provided way
[1:26:48] God's provided ways repentance
[1:26:51] confessions and showing results bringing
[1:26:55] forth fruit meat for repentance showing
[1:26:57] sincerity if you people he said we'll
[1:27:00] just do that this morning this going to
[1:27:02] be prayed for
[1:27:03] you said you people to hear this tape
[1:27:05] all over the world after this tape was
[1:27:07] played and the minister the person is
[1:27:09] playing it in congregation groups out in
[1:27:10] the jungles or wherever you are this
[1:27:12] playing it will first make your
[1:27:13] confession clear and then come with
[1:27:15] nothing in your heart and all but faith
[1:27:16] and be prayed for there the medicine
[1:27:18] will take place he never said you had to
[1:27:22] play a tape in a congregation group but
[1:27:23] what he said if you do make sure you're
[1:27:25] applying it
[1:27:28] read it if you do make sure that you
[1:27:32] make your confession clear because it
[1:27:34] won't do you no good if you don't and
[1:27:36] then come with nothing your heart at all
[1:27:38] but faith and be prayed for there's the
[1:27:39] medicine will take place I'm closing
[1:27:43] with this it's a little bit of a long
[1:27:48] story but I read it and there's a
[1:27:51] parable delightful bit of country early
[1:27:56] one summer morning I walked out to be
[1:27:59] refreshed by the pure sweet air side of
[1:28:02] fields in the woods and grasses and
[1:28:04] flowers beasts and birds when presently
[1:28:08] I came upon an orchard into which I
[1:28:10] entered the trees were beautiful to
[1:28:13] behold the air was fragrant fruit was
[1:28:15] abundant I wandered on almost enchanted
[1:28:18] until to my great wonder I came upon a
[1:28:21] tree having neither bloom nor fruit so
[1:28:26] painfully impressed without any thought
[1:28:28] of hurting or giving offence and as to
[1:28:31] myself I said you poor lost tree what
[1:28:36] can you be doing here
[1:28:37] I'm Marvel you are not removed upon
[1:28:42] which to my astonishment the tree
[1:28:44] replied not without tartness Oh indeed
[1:28:48] sir indeed no doubt you think you're a
[1:28:51] wise wise above your father's you think
[1:28:53] you know about much about things I dare
[1:28:55] say but you're in a great mistake
[1:28:56] I am neither poor nor lost well I said
[1:29:00] you have neither leaves or fruit and
[1:29:02] probably no SAP and the tree says what
[1:29:06] does that have to do with it your
[1:29:09] ignorance is inexcusable he seemed not
[1:29:11] to know that a great Saviour of trees
[1:29:12] has been down here and I believed his
[1:29:14] gospel and it was saved by grace I've
[1:29:17] accepted salvation is a free gift and
[1:29:19] though I haven't either leaves no fruit
[1:29:21] I'm saved all the same I looked at it
[1:29:24] with pity and I said you're a poor
[1:29:25] deluded tree you're not saved at all
[1:29:28] you're only a dead tree despite all your
[1:29:32] talk about grace and redemption the only
[1:29:34] salvation you can ever know is to be
[1:29:35] made living
[1:29:38] and fruit-bearing listen life that is
[1:29:42] salvation you show signs of life you may
[1:29:52] be rough maybe an exterior that's hard
[1:29:55] to show signs of life
[1:29:57] oh so grateful I'm glad when the church
[1:30:01] shows signs of life I'm glad to see in
[1:30:04] your lives but you show signs of life
[1:30:06] you won't be just dead but there'd been
[1:30:08] something happened there's been
[1:30:10] something to take place you show signs
[1:30:12] of life it says life that is salvation
[1:30:16] when I come and see you Layton with
[1:30:18] fruit or even showing signs of leaves
[1:30:20] I'll say oh that poor tree that's safe
[1:30:22] that's the only way we know we don't
[1:30:25] know what's happening on the inside but
[1:30:26] if you see those signs of life and the
[1:30:30] tree says though you are not sound you
[1:30:31] don't understand the gospel and I
[1:30:34] thought so it is as with trees so with
[1:30:37] men they talked as if grace and
[1:30:39] salvation were something God keeps for
[1:30:41] them outside themselves will not
[1:30:45] understand or believe that he who has
[1:30:46] saved he who takes Christ fully and rest
[1:30:49] on his atoning work alone is made free
[1:30:53] from sin it has fruit to holiness
[1:30:58] musicians come do you want to be well
[1:31:03] Jesus found that man in the temple and
[1:31:08] said unto Him behold thou art made whole
[1:31:11] he didn't go through the process of
[1:31:14] picking up his bed walking in getting in
[1:31:17] an argument with his denomination said
[1:31:21] behold our made whole sin no more that's
[1:31:24] the worst thing coming to thee do you
[1:31:30] want to attain holiness it's the word we
[1:31:32] don't hear much anymore but it's still
[1:31:35] the truth we didn't throw that away you
[1:31:39] feel a real desire to be holy in your
[1:31:41] life would you be a partaker of the
[1:31:43] divine nature what holiness means it's
[1:31:44] not long sleeves and long dresses but
[1:31:47] it's a particular to be a partaker of
[1:31:48] the divine nature then go to Christ
[1:31:54] don't think about making yourself ready
[1:31:57] see because that's not it's not giving
[1:31:58] up all these things it's if you go
[1:32:00] through the door you show signs of life
[1:32:05] don't think about making yourself ready
[1:32:07] but say like this like to him says
[1:32:09] nothing in my hand I bring simply to thy
[1:32:12] cross I cling naked flee to thee for
[1:32:15] dress helpless look to thee for grace
[1:32:19] you see he said as many as received him
[1:32:22] to them he gave power to become the sons
[1:32:24] of God even to them that believe on his
[1:32:29] name could we sing amazed that he loved
[1:32:33] me loves me I'm amazed that he cares did
[1:32:35] you bow your heads together and the
[1:32:41] presence of God
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] Moses took Aaron's stick just an old
[1:32:49] dead dry stick that had been cut up and
[1:32:55] hadn't been attached to the life in a
[1:32:57] long time but there's something about
[1:33:02] the presence of this kind of God that
[1:33:08] when you take that stick and he put it
[1:33:13] down inside of the Holy of Holies down
[1:33:17] inside inside of the Ark of the Covenant
[1:33:23] under the influence of that Shekinah
[1:33:25] presence of God so the word never works
[1:33:31] just as a letter alone letter alone
[1:33:34] kills but the Spirit brings life in that
[1:33:38] life and in that light that dry stick it
[1:33:42] hadn't been attached to the vine for
[1:33:44] years so dusty and dead it began to
[1:33:49] bring forth fruit almonds begin to come
[1:33:53] out of it the life that was in it began
[1:33:56] to be produced overnight and I'm not
[1:33:59] saying that you become a full tree
[1:34:01] overnight but there's life where there
[1:34:04] was once only death where there was once
[1:34:05] only heartache where it was what you
[1:34:08] just couldn't overcome but all the
[1:34:10] sudden there's grace to overcome all of
[1:34:12] a sudden there's something in your life
[1:34:13] that makes you different I'm not
[1:34:15] preaching legalism this morning I want
[1:34:17] to see life I want to see life you don't
[1:34:21] set conditions for that life you don't
[1:34:24] get to come and say now come if I can
[1:34:26] come this way I'll come I'll do it if I
[1:34:28] can if I if you let me come this way no
[1:34:31] it's not me to let you come you've got
[1:34:34] to come God's provided way there's
[1:34:36] guards at the door the mercy you've got
[1:34:39] to come according to God's provided way
[1:34:41] which is his word his word speaks to you
[1:34:44] this morning it says I want you to do
[1:34:46] this so would you go wash in the pool
[1:34:47] just go
[1:34:50] let's go wash dodo back if you hold back
[1:34:55] you'll never be healed if you hold back
[1:34:57] you'll never be held we want to behold
[1:35:00] this morning you're listening this
[1:35:02] morning if you're watching would you
[1:35:04] just make your heart make the place
[1:35:06] where you're seated an altar so lord I
[1:35:09] want to be whole I'm so amazed that you
[1:35:11] found me among all those people and you
[1:35:13] walked down through the crowd and you
[1:35:15] you made your way through all the people
[1:35:17] you come to me Lord
[1:35:19] you put an overwhelming desire in my
[1:35:22] life to be whole that's that's what I
[1:35:24] want to follow Lord that's what I want
[1:35:26] to be I want to be well I want to be
[1:35:28] whole I want to be redeemed I want
[1:35:30] everything to come out of my life you
[1:35:32] say well I've been a Christian a lot of
[1:35:33] years for the bed but remember you can
[1:35:35] be tried and brother Brad resentful if a
[1:35:37] sinner needs to repent then a Christian
[1:35:39] needs to repent that much more oh how we
[1:35:42] need God to move in our lives you say oh
[1:35:44] wait I see circumstances ahead I see
[1:35:46] problems we can't overcome we can
[1:35:48] overcome them through the power of the
[1:35:50] blood we can overcome them nothing is
[1:35:52] too hard for God
[1:35:53] he won't God to move then you open up to
[1:35:55] him today say Lord whatever it is take
[1:35:58] it out of me cleanse me God I want life
[1:36:00] in my life

[1:36:06] be able to see that you're still the
[1:36:08] same yesterday today and forever I just
[1:36:11] talked to him for a moment let he was
[1:36:13] speaking your life all his presence is
